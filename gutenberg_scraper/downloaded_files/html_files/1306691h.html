  <h2>I. &mdash; WALTER&rsquo;S HOME</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>The merry homes of England!<br>
    Around their hearths by night,<br>
    What gladsome looks of household love,<br>
    Meet in the ruddy light!</i><br>
    &mdash;Mrs Hemans.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Good-bye, Walter; good-bye, Walter dear! good-
  bye!&rdquo; and the last note of this chorus was &ldquo;Dood-bye,&rdquo; from
  a blue-eyed, fair-haired girl of two years, as Walter disengaged his arms
  from his mother&rsquo;s neck, and sprang into the carriage which had already
  been waiting a quarter of an hour to convey him and his luggage to the
  station.</p>

  <p>It is the old, old story: Mr Evson was taking his son to a large public
  school, and this was the first time that Walter had left home. Nearly every
  father who deigns to open this little book has gone through the scene
  himself; and he and his sons will know from personal experience the thoughts,
  and sensations, and memories, which occupied the minds of Walter Evson and
  his father, as the carriage drove through the garden gate and the village
  street, bearing the eldest boy of the young family from the sacred and quiet
  shelter of a loving home, to a noisy and independent life among a number of
  strange and young companions.</p>

  <p>If you have ever stood on the hill from which Walter caught a last glimpse
  of the home he was leaving, and waved his final farewell to his mother, you
  are not likely to have forgotten the scene which was then spread before your
  eyes. On the right-hand side, the low hills, covered with firs, rise in
  gentle slopes one over the other, till they reach the huge green shoulder of
  a mountain, around whose summits the clouds are generally weaving their awful
  and ever-changing diadem. To the left, between the road and a lower range of
  wooded undulations, is a deep and retired glen, through which a mountain
  stream babbles along its hurried course, tumbling sometimes in a noisy
  cataract and rushing wildly through the rough boulder stones which it has
  carried from the heights, or deepening into some quiet pool, bright and
  smooth as glass, on the margin of which the great purple loosestrife and the
  long fern-leaves bend down as though to gaze at their own reflected beauty.
  In front, and at your feet, opens a rich valley, which is almost filled as
  far as the roots of the mountains by a lovely lake. Beside this lake the
  white houses of a little village cluster around the elevation on which the
  church and churchyard stand; while on either shore, rising among the
  fir-groves that overshadow the first swellings of the hills, are a few
  sequestered villas, commanding a prospect of rare beauty, and giving a last
  touch of interest to the surrounding view.</p>

  <p>In one of these houses&mdash;that one with the crowded gables not a
  hundred feet above the lake, opposite to which you see the swans pluming
  their wings in the sunlight, and the green boat in its little
  boathouse&mdash;lived the hero of our story; and no boy could have had a
  dearer or lovelier home. His father, Mr Evson, was a man in easy, and almost
  in affluent circumstances, who, having no regular occupation, had chosen for
  himself this quiet retreat, and devoted all his time and care to the
  education of his family, and the ordinary duties of a country gentleman.</p>

  <p>Walter was the eldest child, a graceful, active, bright-eyed boy. Up to
  this time&mdash;and he was now thirteen years old&mdash;he had had no other
  teaching but that of his father, and of a tutor, who for the last year had
  lived in the house. His education, therefore, differed considerably from that
  of many boys of his own age, and the amount of book knowledge which he had
  acquired was small as yet; but he was full of that intelligent interest in
  things most worth knowing, which is the best and surest guarantee for future
  progress.</p>

  <p>Let me pause for a moment to relate how a refined and simple-hearted
  gentleman had hitherto brought up his young boys. I do not pronounce whether
  the method was right or wrong; I only describe it as it was, and its success
  or failure must be inferred from the following pages.</p>

  <p>The positive teaching of the young Evsons did not begin too early. Till
  they were ten or twelve years old nearly all they did know had come to them
  either intuitively or without any conscious labour. They were allowed almost
  to live in the open air, and nature was their wise and tender teacher. Some
  object was invented, if possible, for every walk. Now it was to find the shy
  recesses of the wood where the wild strawberries were thickest, or where the
  white violets and the rarest orchis flowers were hid; or to climb along the
  rocky sides of the glen to seek the best spot for a rustic meal, and find
  mossy stones and flower-banks for seats and tables near some waterfall or
  pool.</p>

  <p>When they were a little older their father would amuse and encourage them
  until they had toiled up even to the very summit of all the nearest hills,
  and there they would catch the fresh breeze which blew from the far-off sea,
  or gaze wonderingly at the summer lightning flashing behind the chain of
  hills, or watch, with many playful fancies, the long gorgeous conflagration
  of the summer sunset. And in such excursions their father or mother would
  teach them without seeming to teach them, until they were thoroughly familiar
  with the names and properties of all the commonest plants, and eagerly
  interested to secure for their little collections, or to plant in their
  gardens, the different varieties of all the wild flowers that were found
  about their home. Or, again, when they sat out in the garden, or wandered
  back in the autumn twilight from some gipsy party, they were taught to
  recognise the stars and planets, until Mars and Jupiter, Orion and
  Cassiopeia, the Pleiads and the Northern Crown, seemed to look down upon them
  like old and beloved friends.</p>

  <p>It was easy, too, and pleasant, to teach them to love and to treat
  tenderly all living things&mdash;to observe the little black-eyed squirrel
  without disturbing him while he cracked his nuts; to watch the mistle-
  thrush&rsquo;s nest till the timid bird had learned to sit there fearlessly,
  and not scurry away at their approach; and to visit the haunts of the moorhen
  without causing any consternation to her or her little black velvet progeny.
  Visitors who stayed at the house were always delighted to see how all
  creatures seemed to trust the children: how the canary would carol in its
  cage when they came into the room; how the ponies would come trotting to the
  boys across the field, and the swans float up and plume their mantling wings,
  expecting food and caresses, whenever they came in sight.</p>

  <p>The lake was a source of endless amusement to them; summer and winter they
  might have been seen bathing in its waters, till they were bold swimmers, or
  lying to read their books in the boat under the shade of the trees, or rowing
  about till the little boy of six years was allowed to paddle himself alone to
  the other side, and even when the waves were rough, and the winds high, the
  elder ones were not afraid to venture out. In short, they were healthy and
  manly mountain-boys, with all their senses admirably exercised, and their
  powers of observation so well trained, that they sometimes amazed their
  London cousins by pointing to some falcon poised far-off above its prey,
  which was but a speck to less practised eyes, or calling attention to the
  sweetness of some wood-bird&rsquo;s note, indistinguishable to less practised
  ears.</p>

  <p>Even in such lessons as these they would have made but little progress if
  they had not been trained in the nursery to be hardy, modest, truthful,
  unselfish, and obedient. This work had effectually been done when alone it
  <i>can</i> be effectually done, in the earliest childhood, when the sweet and
  plastic nature may acquire for all that is right and good the powerful aid of
  habit, before the will and the passions are fully conscious of their
  dangerous and stubborn power.</p>

  <p>Let no one say that I have been describing some youthful prodigies. There
  are thousands such as I describe in all happy and well-ordered English homes;
  there might be thousands more if parents spent a more thoughtful care upon
  the growth of their children; there will be many, many thousands more as the
  world, &ldquo;in the rich dawn of an ampler day,&rdquo; in the gradual yet
  noble progress of social and moral improvement, becomes purer and holier, and
  more like Him Who came to be the ideal of the loftiest, yet the lowliest, of
  the most clear-sighted, yet the most loving, of the most happy, and yet the
  most humble manhood.</p>

  <h2>II. &mdash; SAINT WINIFRED&rsquo;S</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Gay Hope is theirs by Fancy led,<br>
    Less pleasing when possess&rsquo;d,<br>
    The tear forgot as soon as shed,<br>
    The sunshine of the breast.</i><br>
    &mdash;Grey.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">WALTER&rsquo;S destination was the school of Saint Winifred.
  Let me here say at once that if any reader set himself to discover what and
  where the school of Saint Winifred is, he will necessarily fail. It is
  impossible, I suppose, to describe <i>any</i> school without introducing
  circumstances so apparently special as to lead some readers into a supposed
  identification. But here, and once for all, I distinctly and seriously
  repudiate all intention of describing any particular foundation. I am well
  aware that for some critics this disclaimer will be insufficient. But every
  <i>honourable</i> reader and critic may rest assured that in describing Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s I have not intended to depict any one school, and that no
  single word dictated by an unworthy personality will find a place in the
  following pages.</p>

  <p>Saint Winifred&rsquo;s School stands by the seaside, on the shores of a
  little bay embraced and closed in by a range of hills whose sweeping
  semicircle is only terminated on either side by the lofty cliffs which, in
  some places, are fringed at the base by a margin of sand and shingle, and in
  others descend with sheer precipices into the ever-boiling surf. Owing to the
  mountainous nature of the country, the railroad cannot approach within a
  distance of five miles, and to reach the school you must drive through the
  dark groves which cover the lower shoulder of one of the surrounding
  mountains. When you reach the summit of this ascent, the bay of Saint
  Winifred lies before you; that line of white houses a quarter of a mile from
  the shore is the village, and the large picturesque building of old grey
  stone, standing in the angle where the little river reaches the sea, is Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s School.</p>

  <p>The carriage stopped at the grand Norman archway of the court. The school
  porter&mdash;the Famulus as they classically called him&mdash;a fine-looking
  man, whose honest English face showed an amount of thought and refinement
  above his station, opened the gate, and, consigning Walter&rsquo;s play-box
  and portmanteau to one of the school servants, directed Mr Evson across the
  court and along some cloisters to the house of Dr Lane, the headmaster. The
  entering of Walter&rsquo;s name on the school books was soon accomplished,
  and he was assigned as private pupil to Mr Robertson, one of the tutors. Dr
  Lane then spoke a word of encouragement to the young stranger, and he walked
  back with his father across the court to the gate, where the carriage was
  still waiting to take Mr Evson to meet the next train.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please let us walk up to the top of the hill, papa,&rdquo; said
  Walter; &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be wanted till tea-time, and I needn&rsquo;t
  bid good-bye to you here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Evson was as little anxious as Walter to hasten the parting. They had
  never been separated before. Mr Evson could look back for the rare period of
  thirteen years, during which they had enjoyed, by God&rsquo;s blessing, an
  almost uninterrupted happiness. He had begun life again with his young
  children; he could thoroughly sympathise alike with their thoughts and with
  their thoughtlessness, and by training them in a manner at once wise and
  firm, he had been spared the greater part of that anxiety and disappointment
  which generally spring from our own mismanagement. He deeply loved, and was
  heartily proud of, his eldest boy. There is no exaggeration in saying that
  Walter had all the best gifts which a parent could desire. There was
  something very interesting in his appearance, and very winning in his modest
  and graceful manners. It was impossible to see him and not be struck with his
  fine open face, and the look of fearless and noble innocence in his deep blue
  eyes.</p>

  <p>It was no time for moral lectures or formal advice. People seem to think
  that a few Polonius-like apophthegms delivered at such a time may be of great
  importance. They may be, perhaps, if they be backed-up and enforced by
  previous years of silent and self-denying example; otherwise they are like
  seed sown upon a rock, like thistle-down blown by the wind across the sea. Mr
  Evson spoke to Walter chiefly about home, about writing letters, about his
  pocket-money, his amusements, and his studies, and Walter knew well
  beforehand, without any repetitions <i>then</i>, what his father wished him
  to be, and the principles in accordance with which he had endeavoured to
  mould his thoughts and actions.</p>

  <p>The time passed too quickly for them both; they were soon at the top of
  the hill where the carriage awaited them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Walter. God bless you,&rdquo; said Mr Evson, shaking
  hands for the last time, and throwing deep meaning into those simple
  words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, papa. My best love to all at home,&rdquo; said Walter,
  trying to speak cheerfully, and struggling manfully to repress his rising
  tears.</p>

  <p>The carriage drove on. Walter watched it out of sight, and, turning round,
  felt that a new phase of his life had begun, and that he was miserably alone.
  It was natural that he should shed a few quiet tears as he thought of the
  dear friends with whom he had parted, and the four hundred strangers into
  whose society he was about to enter. Yet being brave and innocent he feared
  nothing, and, without any very definite religious consciousness, he had a
  clear and vivid sense that One Friend was ever with him.</p>

  <p>The emotions of a boy are as transient as they are keen, and
  Walter&rsquo;s tears were soon dried. As he looked round, the old familiar
  voice of the mountains was in his ears. He gazed with the delight of
  friendship on their towering summits, and promised himself, many an
  exhilarating climb up their steep sides. And now, too, for the first
  time&mdash;for hitherto he had not much noticed the scenery around
  him&mdash;a new voice, the great voice of the sea, broke with its grand but
  awful monotony upon his listening ear. As he gazed upon the waves, glowing
  and flashing with the golden network of autumnal sunbeams, it seemed to dawn
  upon him like the discovery of a new sense, and he determined to stroll down
  to the beach before re-entering the gates of Saint Winifred.</p>

  <p>He wandered there not only with a boy&rsquo;s delight, but with the
  delight of a boy whose eyes and ears have always been open to the beauty and
  wonder of the outer world. He longed to have his brother with him there. He
  picked up handfuls of the hard and sparkling sand; he sent the broad flat
  pebbles flying over the surface, and skimming through the crests of the
  waves; he half-filled his pockets with green and yellow shells, and crimson
  fragments of Delessaria Sanguinea for his little sisters; and he was full of
  pleasurable excitement when the great clock of Saint Winifred&rsquo;s,
  striking five, reminded him that he had better go in, and learn something, if
  possible, about the order of his future life.</p>

  <h2>III. &mdash; NEW BOYS</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Parolles.&mdash;I find my tongue is too foolhardy.</i><br>
    &mdash;All&rsquo;s Well that Ends Well, Act four, scene 1.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">THE Famulus&mdash;&ldquo;familiar&rdquo;&mdash;as the boys
  called him, directed Walter across the court to the rooms of his housekeeper,
  who informed him about the places where his clothes and his play-boxes would
  be kept, and the dormitory where he was to sleep. She also gave him a key of
  the desk in the great schoolroom, in which he might, if he chose, keep his
  portable property. She moreover announced, with some significance, that she
  should be glad to do anything for him which lay in her humble power, and that
  the day after to-morrow was her birthday. Walter was a little puzzled as to
  the relevancy of the latter piece of information. He learnt it at a
  subsequent period, when he also discovered that Mrs Higgins found it to her
  interest to have periodical birthdays, recurring two or three times at least
  every half-year. The years which must have passed over that good lady&rsquo;s
  head during Walter&rsquo;s stay at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s&mdash;the premature
  rapidity with which old age must have subsequently overtaken her, and the
  vigour which she displayed at so advanced a period of life&mdash;were
  something quite extraordinary of their kind.</p>

  <p>Towards the great schoolroom Walter accordingly directed his steps. The
  key turned out to be quite superfluous, for the hasp of the lock had been
  broken by Walter&rsquo;s predecessor, who had also left the trace of his
  name, his likeness, and many interesting though inexplicable designs and
  hieroglyphics, with a red-hot poker, on the lid. The same gentleman, to judge
  by appearances, must have had a curious entomological collection of spiders
  and earwigs under his protection, and had bequeathed to Walter a highly
  miscellaneous legacy of rubbish. Walter contemplated his bequest with some
  dismay, and began busily to dust the interior of the desk, and make it as fit
  a receptacle as he could for his writing materials and other personal
  possessions.</p>

  <p>While thus engaged he could not help being secretly tickled by the
  proceedings of a group of boys standing round the large unlighted stove, and
  amusing themselves, harmlessly for the most part, with the inexperience and
  idiosyncrasies of various newcomers. After tiring themselves with the freaks
  of a mad Irish boy who had entered into the spirit of his own
  cross-examination with a high sense of buffoonery which refused to grow
  ill-tempered, they were now playing on the extreme gullibility of a heavy,
  open-mouthed, bullet-headed fellow, named Plumber, from whom the most
  astounding information could extract no greater evidence of sensation than a
  little wider stare of the eyes, and an unexcited drawl of &ldquo;Really
  though?&rdquo; One of the group, named Henderson, a merry-looking boy with a
  ceaseless pleasant twinkle of the eyes, had been taxing his own invention to
  the uttermost without in the least exciting Plumber&rsquo;s credulity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw the fellow who let you in at the school gates,
  Plumber?&rdquo; said Henderson. &ldquo;Yes; I saw someone or
  other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But did you notice him particularly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t notice him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you should have done. That man&rsquo;s called &lsquo;the
  Familiar.&rsquo; Ask anyone if he isn&rsquo;t? But do you know
  why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Plumber.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s got a familiar spirit which waits on
  him,&rdquo; said Henderson mysteriously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really though,&rdquo; said Plumber, and this time he looked so
  frightened that it was impossible for the rest to avoid bursting into a fit
  of laughter, during which Plumber, vaguely comprehending that he was
  considered a very good joke, retired with discomfiture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You fools,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d only given
  me a little more time I&rsquo;d have made him believe that Lane had a tail,
  and wore his gown to conceal it, except when he used it to flog with; and
  that before being entered he would have to sing a song standing on his head.
  You&rsquo;ve quite spoilt my game by bursting out laughing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another new fellow,&rdquo; said Kenrick, one of the
  group. &ldquo;Come here, you new fellow!&rdquo; called two or three of
  them.</p>

  <p>Walter looked up, thinking that he was addressed, but found that the
  summons was meant for a boy, rather good-looking but very slender, whose
  self-important attitude and supercilious look betrayed no slight amount of
  vanity, and who, to the apparent astonishment of the rest, was surveying the
  room and its appurtenances with a look of great affectation and disdain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t much seem to like the look of Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Kenrick to him, as the boy walked up with a
  delicate air. &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; lisped the new boy; &ldquo;everything
  looks so very common.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Common and unclean to the last degree,&rdquo; said Henderson,
  imitating his manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And is this the only place you have to sit in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, by no means,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;each of us has a
  private apartment furnished in crimson and gold, according to the simple yet
  elegant taste of the owner. Our meals are there served to us by kneeling
  domestics on little dishes of silver.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you intend that for wit,&rdquo; said the new boy
  languidly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; to do you, to wit,&rdquo; answered Henderson; &ldquo;but
  seriously though, that would be a great deal more like what you have been
  accustomed to, wouldn&rsquo;t it, my friend?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very much more,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And would you politely favour this company,&rdquo; said Henderson,
  with obsequious courtesy, &ldquo;by revealing to us your name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name is Howard Tracy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said Henderson, with an air of great
  satisfaction, and making a low bow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am called Howard Tracy because I am descended lineally from both
  those noble families.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My goodness! are you really!&rdquo; said Henderson, clasping his
  hands in mock transport. &ldquo;My dear sir, you are an honour to your race
  and country! you are an honour to this school. By Jove, we are proud, sir, to
  have you among us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you may not know that my uncle is the Viscount Saint
  George,&rdquo; said Tracy patronisingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he, though, by George!&rdquo; said Henderson yawning. &ldquo;Is
  that Saint George who&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Swinged the dragon, and e&rsquo;er since<br>
    Sits on his horseback at mine hostess&rsquo; door?&rsquo;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But finding that the boy&rsquo;s vanity was too obtuse to be amusing any
  longer, he was about to leave him to the rest, when Jones caught sight of
  Walter, and called out:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Halloa, here&rsquo;s a new fellow grinning at the follies of his
  kind. Come here, you dark-haired chap. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Evson,&rdquo; said Walter, quietly approaching them. Before getting
  any fun out of him it was necessary to see what kind of boy he was; and as
  Jones hardly knew what line to take, he began on the commonest and most
  vulgar tack of catechising him about his family and relations.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father is a gentleman,&rdquo; said Walter, rather surprised at
  the rudeness of the question. &ldquo;And where do you live?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At Semlyn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And how old are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just thirteen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And how many sisters have you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter rather thought of asking, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;
  but as he saw no particular harm in answering the question, and did not want
  to seem too stiff-backed, he answered, &ldquo;Three.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And are they very beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I never asked them. Are yours?&rdquo; This last
  question was so perfectly quiet and unexpected, and Jones was so evidently
  discomfited by it, that the rest burst into a roar of laughter, and Henderson
  said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve caught a tartar, Jones. You can&rsquo;t drop salt
  on this bird&rsquo;s tail. You had better return to Plumber, or Saint George
  and the dragon. Here, my noble Viscount, what do you think of your coeval? Is
  he as common as the rest of us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything about him, if you mean me by
  Viscount,&rdquo; said Tracy peevishly, beginning at last to understand that
  they had been making a fool of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite right, Saint George; he&rsquo;s beneath your notice.&rdquo;
  Tracy ran his hand through his scented hair, as if he rather Implied that he
  was; and being mortified at the contrast between his own credulous vanity and
  Walter&rsquo;s manly simplicity, and anxious if possible to regain his
  position, he said angrily to Walter, &ldquo;What are you looking at me
  for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not wishing to be rude, Walter turned away, while someone observed,
  &ldquo;A cat may look at a king.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, a cat at a king, I grant you,&rdquo; answered Henderson;
  &ldquo;but not a mere son of Eve at any Howard Tracy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are laughing at me,&rdquo; said Tracy to Walter again, in a
  still angrier tone, seeing Walter smile at Henderson&rsquo;s remark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not the slightest wish to laugh at you,&rdquo; said
  Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes he has. Shy this at him,&rdquo; said Jones, putting a great bit
  of orange peel into Tracy&rsquo;s hand.</p>

  <p>Tracy threw it at Walter, and he without hesitation picked it up, and
  flung it back in Tracy&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A fight! a fight!&rdquo; shouted the mischief-making group, as
  Tracy made a blind blow at Walter, which his antagonist easily parried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make him fight you. Challenge him,&rdquo; said Jones. &ldquo;Invite
  him to the milling-ground behind the chapel after first school to-morrow
  morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pistols for <i>two</i>, coffee for four, at eight to-
  morrow,&rdquo; said Henderson. &ldquo;Trample on the Dragon&rsquo;s tail,
  someone, and rouse him to the occasion. What! he won&rsquo;t come to the
  scratch? Alack! alack!</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;What can ennoble fools or cowards<br>
    Not all the blood of all the Tracys, Dragons, and
    Howards!&rsquo;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>He continued mischievously, as he saw that Tracy, on taking note of
  Walter&rsquo;s compact figure, showed signs of declining the combat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Henderson,&rdquo; said Kenrick, one of the group who had
  taken no part in the talk; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a shame to be setting two new
  fellows fighting their first evening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Henderson&rsquo;s last remark had been too much for Tracy. &ldquo;Will
  you fight?&rdquo; he said, walking up to Walter with reddening cheeks. For
  Tracy had been to school before, and was no novice in the ways of boys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Walter coolly, to everybody&rsquo;s
  great surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! the other chap showing the white feather, too. <i>All</i> the
  new fellows are cowards it seems this time,&rdquo; said Jones.
  &ldquo;This&rsquo;ll never do. Pitch into him, Tracy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s hear first why he
  won&rsquo;t fight?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because I see no occasion to,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;and
  because, in the second place, I never could fight in cold blood; and because,
  in the third place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what in the third place?&rdquo; said Kenrick, interested to
  observe Walter&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the third place,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it
  from conceit&mdash;but that boy&rsquo;s no match for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To anyone who glanced at the figures of the two boys this was obvious
  enough, although Walter was a year the younger of the two. The rest began to
  respect Walter accordingly as a sensible little man, but Tracy was greatly
  offended by the last remark, and Jones, who was a bully and had a grudge
  against Walter for baffling his impertinence, exclaimed, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  you be afraid, Tracy. I&rsquo;ll back you. Give him something to heat his
  cold blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Fired at once by taunts and encouragements, Tracy did as he was bid, and
  struck Walter on the face. The boy started angrily, and at first seemed as if
  he meant to return the blow with compound interest, but suddenly changing his
  intention, he seized Tracy round the waist, and in spite of all kicking and
  struggling, fairly carried the humiliated descendant of the Howards and
  Tracys to a far corner of the room, where, amid a shout of laughter, he
  deposited him with the laconic suggestion, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be a
  fool.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter&rsquo;s blood was now up, and thinking that he might as well show,
  from the very first, that he was not to be bullied, or made a butt with
  impunity, he walked straight to the stove, and looking full at Jones (who had
  inspired him already with strong disgust), he said, &ldquo;You called me a
  coward just now; I&rsquo;m not a coward, though I don&rsquo;t like fighting
  for nothing. I&rsquo;m not a bit afraid of <i>you</i>, though you forced that
  fellow to hit me just now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you? Saucy young cub! Then take that,&rdquo; said
  Jones, enforcing the remark with a box on the ear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you take that,&rdquo; said Walter, returning the compliment
  with as much energy as if he had been playing at the game of <i>Gif es
  wetter</i>.</p>

  <p>Jones, astonished beyond measure, sprang forward, clenched his two fists,
  squared, and blustered with great demonstrativeness. He was much
  Walter&rsquo;s senior, and was utterly taken by surprise at his audacity; but
  he seemed in no hurry to avenge the insult.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Walter, heaving with indignation, &ldquo;why
  don&rsquo;t you hit me again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jones looked at his firm and determined little assailant with some alarm,
  slowly tucked up the sleeves of his coat, turned white and red,
  and&mdash;didn&rsquo;t return the blow. The tea-bell beginning to ring at
  that moment gave him a convenient excuse for breaking off the altercation. He
  told his friends that he was on the point of thrashing Walter when the bell
  rang, but that he thought it a shame to fight a new fellow&mdash;&ldquo;and
  in cold blood, too,&rdquo; he added, adopting Walter&rsquo;s language, but
  not his sincerity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me a coward again then,&rdquo; said Walter to him
  as he turned away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Evson, you&rsquo;re a regular brick, a regular
  stunner,&rdquo; said young Kenrick, delighted, as he showed Walter the way to
  the Hall where the boys had tea. &ldquo;That fellow Jones is no end of a
  bully, and he won&rsquo;t be quite so big in future. You&rsquo;ve taken him
  down a great many pegs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Kenrick,&rdquo; shouted Henderson after them, &ldquo;I bet
  you five to one I know what you&rsquo;re saying to the new fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I bet you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Kenrick, laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying&mdash;it&rsquo;s a quotation, you know, but
  never mind&mdash;you&rsquo;re saying to him, &lsquo;A sudden thought strikes
  me: let&rsquo;s swear an eternal friendship.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re quite out,&rdquo; answered Kenrick. &ldquo;I was
  saying come and sit next me at tea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And go shares in jam,&rdquo; added Henderson: &ldquo;exactly what I
  said, only in other words.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>IV. &mdash; FRIENDS AND FOES</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;He who hath a thousand friends hath not one friend to spare,<br>
    And he who hath one enemy shall meet him everywhere.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">ALREADY Walter had got someone to talk to, someone he knew;
  for in spite of Kenrick&rsquo;s repudiation of Henderson&rsquo;s jest, he
  felt already that he had discovered a boy with whom he should soon be
  friends. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how he had discovered it; it was by animal
  magnetism; it was by some look in Kenrick&rsquo;s eyes; it was his
  light-heartedness; it was by the mingled fire and refinement of his face
  which spoke of a wilful and impetuous, yet also of a generous and noble
  nature. Already he felt a sense of ease and pleasure in the certainty that
  Kenrick&mdash;evidently no cipher among his schoolfellows&mdash;was inclined
  to like him, and to show him the ways of the school.</p>

  <p>They went into a large hall, where the four hundred had their meals. They
  sat at a number of tables arranged breadth-wise across the hall; twenty or
  thirty sat at each table, and either a master or a monitor (as the sixteen
  upper boys were called) took his place at the head of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, mind you don&rsquo;t begin to smoke,&rdquo; said Henderson, as
  Walter went in, and found most of the boys already seated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Smoke?&rdquo; said Walter, taking it for a bit of good advice;
  &ldquo;do fellows smoke in Hall? I never have smoked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re smoking now,&rdquo; said Henderson, as Walter,
  entering among the crowd of strange faces and meeting so many pairs of eyes,
  began to blush a little.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t teaze him, Flip,&rdquo; said Kenrick. &ldquo;Smoking is
  the name fellows give to blushing, Evson; and if they see you given to
  blushing, they&rsquo;ll stare at you for the fun of seeing the colour mount
  up in your cheeks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Accordingly, as he sat down, he saw that numerous eyes were turned upon
  him and upon Tracy, who happened to sit at the same table. Tracy,
  unaccustomed to such very narrow scrutiny, blushed all over; and, as he in
  vain looked up and down, this way and that, his cheeks grew hotter and
  hotter, and he moved about in the most uneasy way, to the great amusement of
  his many tormentors, until at last his eyes subsided finally into his teacup,
  from which he did not again venture to raise them until tea was over. But
  Walter was at once up to the trick, and felt thoroughly obliged to Henderson
  and Kenrick for telling him of it. So he waited till he saw that a good dozen
  fellows were all intently staring at him; and then, looking up very simply
  and naturally, he met the gaze of two or three of them steadily in
  succession, and stared them out of countenance with a quiet smile. This
  turned the laugh against them; and he heard the remark that he was &ldquo;up
  to snuff, and no mistake.&rdquo; No one ever tried to make Walter smoke
  again, but for some time it used to be a regular joke to pass round word at
  tea-time, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make Tracy smoke,&rdquo; and as Tracy always
  <i>did</i> smoke till he got thoroughly used to it, he was generally glad
  when tea-time was over.</p>

  <p>In spite of Henderson, who poked fun at them all tea-time (till he saw
  that he really embarrassed them, and then he desisted), Kenrick sat by
  Walter, and took him more or less under his protection; for an &ldquo;old
  boy&rdquo; can always patronise a newcomer at first, even if they are of the
  same age.</p>

  <p>From Kenrick Walter learnt, rather to his dismay, that he really would
  have no place to sit in except the big schoolroom, which he would share with
  some fifty others, and that he would be placed in a dormitory with at least
  five or six besides himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you been examined yet?&rdquo; asked Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; but Dr Lane asked me what books I had read, and he told me that
  I was to go and take my chance in Mr Paton&rsquo;s form. What form is
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what we call the Virgil form. Have you ever read
  Virgil?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; at least only a few easy bits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish you joy, then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why? what sort of a fellow is Mr Paton?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr Paton? he&rsquo;s not a man at all; he&rsquo;s a machine;
  he&rsquo;s the wheel of a mill; he&rsquo;s a cast-iron automaton;
  he&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the
  prophet,&rdquo; observed Henderson, who had caught a fragment of the
  conversation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in his form, too, worse luck!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush! shut up, Henderson, and don&rsquo;t be profane,&rdquo; said
  Kenrick. &ldquo;Well, Evson, you&rsquo;ll soon find out what Paton&rsquo;s
  like; anything but &lsquo;a patten of bright gold&rsquo; at any
  rate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! turn him out for his bad pun,&rdquo; said Henderson,
  hitting him with a pellet of bread, for which offence he immediately received
  &ldquo;fifty lines&rdquo; from the master at the other end of the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abuse Paton,&rdquo; said a boy named Daubeny, which
  name Henderson had long ago contracted into Dubbs. &ldquo;I always found him
  a capital master to be under, and really very kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i>&mdash;yes,&rdquo; answered Kenrick; &ldquo;if we
  were all gifted with your mouselike stillness in school, my dear old
  Dubbs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And your metallic capacity of grind, my dear old Dubbs,&rdquo;
  added Henderson.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And your ostrich-like digestion of crabbed rules, my dear old
  Dubbs; why, then,&rdquo; said Kenrick, &ldquo;we should all be boys after
  Paton&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or Paton&rsquo;s pattern,&rdquo; suggested Henderson; so it was now
  Kenrick&rsquo;s turn to shudder at a miserable attempt at a pun, and return
  Henderson&rsquo;s missile, whereupon he got a <i>hundred</i> lines, which
  made him pull a very long face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to be your tutor, Evson?&rdquo; he asked after this
  interlude.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re going to pick him to pieces, now,&rdquo;
  said Daubeny, smiling; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you believe half they say of him,
  Evson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, if you&rsquo;re sharp, and successful, and polite, and
  gentlemanly, and jolly, and all that sort of thing, he&rsquo;ll like you very
  much, and be exceedingly kind to you; but if you are lazy, or mischievous, or
  stupid, or at all a pickle, he&rsquo;ll ignore you, snub you, won&rsquo;t
  speak to you. I wish you&rsquo;d been in the same pupil-room with
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Depends on who he is, O virtuous Dubbs,&rdquo; said Henderson.
  &ldquo;His end shall be &lsquo;pieces,&rsquo; as <i>Punch</i> says, if he
  deserves it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He told me I was to be Mr Robertson&rsquo;s pupil,&rdquo; said
  Walter. &ldquo;Hum-m!&rdquo; observed Kenrick. &ldquo;Why, what sort of a
  person is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some of his pups detest him, others adore him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your tutor, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Percival; there, the master who is chatting and laughing with those
  monitors. He&rsquo;s a regular brick. <i>Plinthos estin</i> as we say in
  Greek,&rdquo; said Kenrick. &ldquo;Halloa! tea&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been chattering so much that the new
  fellow&rsquo;s had none,&rdquo; said Henderson, as a bell rang and one of the
  monitors read a short Latin grace.</p>

  <p>The boys streamed out, and Kenrick helped his new friend to unpack his
  books and other treasures, and put them in his desk, for which they ordered a
  new lock. The rest of the evening was occupied with &ldquo;Evening
  Work,&rdquo; a time during which all the boys below a certain form sat in the
  schoolroom, and prepared their lessons for the next day, while a master
  occupied the desk to superintend and keep order. As other boys who were in
  the same form with himself were doing no work, Walter did not suppose that
  any work would be expected of him the next morning, and he therefore occupied
  his time in writing a long letter home. When this was over he began talking
  to Henderson, of whom he had a thousand questions to ask, and whose chief
  amusement seemed to consist in chaffing everybody, and whom, nevertheless,
  everybody seemed to regard as a friend. At nine a bell rang, the whole school
  went to chapel, where a short evening service was held, and then all but the
  higher forms, and the boys who had separate rooms, went to bed. As Walter lay
  down to sleep, he felt at least a century older than he had done that
  morning. Everything was marvellously new to him, but on the whole he was
  inclined to take a bright view of things. Two of the things which had
  happened to him gave him special delight: the sight of the sea, and the happy
  dawn&mdash;for as such he regarded it&mdash;of a genuine, hearty, boyish
  friendship, both with Henderson and Kenrick. When the gas was turned off,
  tired out with his journey and his excitement, he quickly fell asleep.</p>

  <p>And, falling asleep, he at once passed into the land of dreams. He was out
  on the sea with Kenrick and Henderson in a row-boat, and all three of them
  were fishing. First there was a pull at Henderson&rsquo;s line, and, tugging
  it up, he caught not a fish, but Jones, who, after a few flounderings, lay
  down in the fish-basket. As this did not in the least surprise any of them,
  and excited no remark whatever, they set to work again, and Kenrick had a
  bite this time, which proved to be Howard Tracy, whom they laid quietly in
  the bottom of the boat, Jones assisting. The third time Walter himself had a
  tug, and was in the act of hauling up Dubbs, when he became conscious that
  the boat was rocking very violently, and he felt rather surprised that he was
  not seasick. This seemed to give a new current to his thoughts, for all of a
  sudden he was out riding with someone, and his horse began to rear in the
  most uncomfortable manner, right on his hind legs. He kept his seat
  manfully&mdash;but no! that last rear was too much, and, suddenly waking, he
  was at once aware that his bed was rising and falling in a series of heavy
  shakes and bumps, whereby he was nearly flung off the mattress. He instantly
  guessed the cause, for indeed, Kenrick had given him a hint of such a
  possibility. He knew that someone, wishing to frighten him, had got under the
  bed, and was heaving it up and down with his back. All that he had noticed
  when he undressed was, that there were several big fellows in the dormitory,
  and he knew that the room had rather a bad reputation for disorder and
  bullying.</p>

  <p>Being a strong little fellow, brave as a lion, and very active, Walter was
  afraid of no one; so springing up during a momentary cessation of the
  mysterious upheavals, he instantly made a dash under the bed, and seized
  someone by the leg. The leg kicked violently, and as a leg is a particularly
  strong limb, it succeeded in disengaging itself from Walter&rsquo;s hands,
  not, however, till it had left a slipper as a trophy; and with this slipper
  Walter pursued a dim white figure, which he could just see scuttling away
  through the darkness to the other side of the room. This figure he overtook
  just in time to give it some resounding smacks with the sole of the slipper;
  when the figure clutched a counterpane off the nearest bed, flung it over
  Walter, and made good an escape, while Walter was entangled, Agamemnon-like,
  in the voluminous folds. Walter, however, still kept possession of the
  slipper, and was determined next morning to discover the owner. He knew that
  it was probably some bigger fellow who had been playing this game, and his
  common sense told him that it was best to take it good-humouredly as a joke,
  and yet at the same time to make it as little pleasant as possible for the
  perpetrator, even if he got thrashed himself. A bully or a joker of practical
  jokes is not likely to do things which cause himself a certain amount of
  discomfort, even if he succeeds in causing a still greater amount to someone
  else.</p>

  <p>Walter cared very little for this adventure. It certainly annoyed him a
  little, and it showed him that some of the others in his dormitory must be
  more or less brutes, if they could find it amusing to break the sleep and
  play on the fears of a new boy the very night of his arrival among them. But
  he thought no more about it, and was quite determined that it should not
  happen often.</p>

  <p>Far different was the case with poor little Arthur Eden, another new boy,
  who, as Walter had observed, occupied the bed next to him. He had been roused
  from his first sweet sleep in the same way, about the same time as Walter.
  But no one had prepared him for this annoyance, and as he was a very timid
  child, it filled him with terror; he was even so terrified that he did not
  know what it was. He lay quite still, not daring to speak, or make a sound,
  only clinging to his mattress with both hands in an agony of dread. He was
  already worn and bewildered with the events of the day. He had fallen amongst
  the Philistines; at the very moment of his arrival he had got into bad hands,
  the hands of boys who made sport of his weakness, corrupted his feelings, and
  lacerated his heart. He was very young&mdash;a mere child of twelve&mdash;and
  in the innocence of his simplicity he had unreservedly answered all their
  questions, and prattled to them about his home, about his twin sister, about
  nearly all his cherished secrets. In that short space of time he had afforded
  materials enough for the coarse jeers of the brutal, and the poignant
  ridicule of the cruel for many a long day. Something of this derision had
  begun already, and he had found no secret place to hide his tears. That they
  would call him a milksop, a molly-coddle, and all kinds of horrid names, he
  knew, and he had tried manfully to bear-up under persecution. It was not
  until after many hot and silent drops had relieved the fever of his
  overwrought brain, that sleep had come to him, and now it was broken
  thus.</p>

  <p>O parents and guardians&mdash;anxious, yet unwise class&mdash;why, tell me
  why, knowing all that you must know, do you send such children as this to
  school? Eden&rsquo;s mother, indeed, had opposed the step, but his guardian
  (for the boy&rsquo;s father was dead), seeing that he was being spoilt at
  home, and that he was naturally a shrinking and timid lad, had urged that he
  should be sent to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, with some vague notion of making a
  man of him. He might as well have thrown a piece of Brussels lace into the
  fire with the intention of changing it into open iron-work. The proper place
  for little Eden would have been some country parsonage, where care and
  kindliness might have gradually helped him, as he grew older, to acquire the
  faculties which he had not; whereas, in this case, a public school only
  impaired for a time in that tender frame the bright yet delicate qualities
  which he had.</p>

  <p>The big, clumsy ne&rsquo;er-do-well of a boy, Cradock by name, who was
  choking with secret laughter as he tilted little Eden&rsquo;s
  bed&mdash;leaving a pause of frightful suspense now and then to let him
  recover breath and realise his situation&mdash;was as raw and ill-trained a
  fellow as you like, but he had nothing in him wilfully or diabolically
  wicked. If he had been similarly treated he would have broken into a great
  guffaw, and emptied his water-jug over the intruder; and yet if he could have
  seen the new boy at that moment, he would have seen that pretty little
  face&mdash;only meant as yet for the smiles of childhood&mdash;white with an
  almost idiotic terror, and he would have caught a staring and meaningless
  look in the glassy eyes which were naturally so bright and blue. But he
  really did not know&mdash;being merely an overgrown stupid fellow&mdash;the
  mischief he was doing, and the absolute horrible torment that his jest (?)
  was inflicting.</p>

  <p>Finding that his joltings produced no apparent effect, and thinking that
  Eden might, by some strange somnolence peculiar to new boys, sleep through it
  all, he tilted the bed a little too high, and then indeed a wild shriek rang
  through the room as the mattress and clothes tumbled right over at the foot
  of the bed, and flung the child violently on the floor. Fortunately the heap
  of bed-clothes prevented him from being much hurt, and Cradock had just time
  to pick him up and huddle him into bed again, and jump back into his own bed,
  when the lamp of one of the masters, who had been attracted by Eden&rsquo;s
  cry, appeared through the door. The master, finding all quiet, and having
  come from a distant room, supposed that his ears had deceived him, or that
  the cry was some accidental noise outside the building. He merely walked
  round the room, and seeing Eden&rsquo;s bed-clothes rather tumbled, kindly
  helped the trembling child to replace them in a more comfortable order, and
  left the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, that&rsquo;s quite enough for one night,&rdquo; said the
  voice of one of the boys, when the master had disappeared. &ldquo;You new
  fellows can go to sleep. Nobody&rsquo;ll touch you again to-night.&rdquo; The
  speaker was Franklin, rather a scapegrace in some respects, but a boy of no
  unkindly nature.</p>

  <p>The light and the noise had revealed to Walter something of what must have
  taken place. In his own case, he cared very little for the assurance that he
  would not be molested again that night, feeling quite sure that he could hold
  his own against anyone, and that his former enemy, at any rate, would not be
  likely to assault him again. But he was very, very glad for poor little
  Eden&rsquo;s sake, having caught a momentary glimpse of his scared and
  pitiable look.</p>

  <p>Walter could not sleep for a long time, not till long after he heard from
  the regular breathings of the others that they were all in deep slumber. For
  there were sounds which came from Eden&rsquo;s bed which disturbed his heart
  with pity. His feelings bled for the poor little fellow, so young and fresh
  from home, a newcomer like himself, but evidently so little accustomed to
  this roughness and so little able to protect his own interests. For a long
  time into the night he heard the poor child crying and sobbing to himself,
  though he was clearly trying to stifle the sound. At last Walter could stand
  it no longer, and feeling sure that the rest were sound asleep, he whispered
  in his kindest tone, for he didn&rsquo;t know his neighbour&rsquo;s
  name&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, you little new fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sound of sobbing was hushed for a moment, but the boy seemed afraid to
  answer; so Walter said again&mdash;&ldquo;Are you awake?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a weak, childish voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; I&rsquo;m a new fellow, too. Tell me your
  name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eden,&rdquo; he whispered tremulously, though reassured by the
  kindly tone of voice. &ldquo;Hush! hush! you&rsquo;ll awake
  someone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll come
  and speak to you;&rdquo; and stepping noiselessly out of bed, he whispered in
  Eden&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Never mind, my poor little fellow; don&rsquo;t be
  frightened; the boy didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you; he was only shoving your
  bed up and down for a joke. Someone did the same to me, so I jumped up and
  licked him with a slipper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I got so frightened. Oh, do you think they&rsquo;ll do it again
  to-night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, certainly, not again to-night,&rdquo; said Walter;
  &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all asleep; and if anyone does it again another night,
  you must just slip out of bed and not mind it. It doesn&rsquo;t
  hurt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; whispered Eden; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re very kind,
  and nobody else has been kind to me here. Will you tell me <i>your</i>
  name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Walter Evson. Do you know, your voice and look
  remind me of my little brother. There,&rdquo; he said, tucking him up in bed,
  &ldquo;now good-night, and go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The little fellow pressed Walter&rsquo;s hand hard, said good-night, and
  soon forgot his misery in a sleep of pure weariness. I do not think that he
  would have slept at all that night, but for the comforting sense that he had
  found, to lean upon, a stronger nature and a stronger character than his own.
  Walter heard him breathing peacefully, and then he too fell asleep, and
  neither woke nor dreamt (that he was aware of), until half-past seven the
  next morning, when a servant roused the boys by ringing a large hand-bell in
  their ears.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2>V. &mdash; SCHOOL TROUBLES</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>The sorrows of thy youthful day Shall make thee wise in coming years!
    The brightest rainbows ever play Above the fountains of our tears.</i><br>
    &mdash;Mackay.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">WALTER jumped up and began to dress at once; Eden, still
  looking pale and frightened, soon followed his example, and recognised him
  with a smile of gratitude. None of the other five boys who occupied the room
  thought of stirring until the chapel-bell began to ring, which left them the
  ample space of a quarter of an hour for their orisons, ablutions, and all
  other necessary preparations!</p>

  <p>Walter, who was now half-dressed, glanced at them as they got up, to
  discover the owner of the slipper, which he still kept in his possession. He
  watched for the one-sandalled enemy as eagerly as Pelias may be supposed to
  have done. First Jones tumbled out of bed, not even deigning a surly
  recognition, but Jones had his right complement of slippers. Then two other
  fellows, named Anthony and Franklin, not quite so big as Jones; their
  slippers were all right. Then Cradock, who looked a little shyly at Eden,
  and, after a while, told him that he was only playing a joke the night
  before, and was sorry for having frightened him; and last, Harpour, the
  biggest of the lot. Harpour was one of those fellows who are to be found in
  every school, and who are always dangerous characters: a huge boy, very low
  down in the forms, very strong, very stupid in work, rather good-looking,
  generally cut by the better sort, unredeemed by any natural taste or
  accomplishment, wholly without influence except among little boys (whom he
  alternately bullied and spoilt), and only kept at school by his friends,
  because they were rather afraid of him, and did not quite know what to do
  with him. They called it &ldquo;keeping him out of mischief,&rdquo; but the
  mischief he did at school was a thousandfold greater than any which he could
  have done elsewhere; for, except at school, he would have been comparatively
  powerless to do any positive harm.</p>

  <p>By the exhaustive process of reasoning, Walter had already concluded that
  Harpour must have been his nocturnal disturber; and, accordingly, after
  thrusting a foot into a slipper, Harpour began to exclaim, &ldquo;Hallo!
  where&rsquo;s my other slipper? Confound it, I shall be late; I can&rsquo;t
  dress; where&rsquo;s my other slipper?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Wishing to leave him without escape from the necessity of betraying
  himself to have been the author of last night&rsquo;s raid, Walter made no
  sign, until Harpour, who had not any time to lose, said to him&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hi! you new chap, have you got my slipper?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got <i>a</i> slipper,&rdquo; said Walter, blandly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The deuce you have. Then give it here, this minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I captured it off someone&rsquo;s leg, who was under my bed last
  night,&rdquo; said Walter, giving it into Harpour&rsquo;s hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The deuce you did!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and I smacked the fellow with it, as I will do again, if he
  comes again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The deuce you will! Then take that for your impudence,&rdquo; said
  Harpour, intending to bring down the slipper on his shoulder; but Walter
  dodged down, and parrying the blow with his arm, sent the slipper in a
  graceful parabola across the wash-hand-stand into Jones&rsquo;s basin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; said Harpour, &ldquo;<i>you&rsquo;re</i> a pretty
  cool hand, you are! Well, I&rsquo;ve no time to settle accounts with you now,
  or I should be late for chapel. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A significant pantomime explained the remainder of the sentence, and then
  Harpour, standing in his one slipper, hastily adjourned to his toilet.
  Walter, being dressed in good time, knelt down for a few moments of hearty
  prayer, helped poor Eden, who was as helpless as though he had been always
  dressed by a servant, to finish dressing, and ran across the court into the
  chapel just as the bell stopped. There were still two minutes before the door
  was shut, and he occupied them by watching the boys as they streamed in, many
  of them with their waistcoats only half buttoned, and others with the water-
  drops still dangling from their hastily combed hair. He saw Tracy saunter in
  very neat, but with a languid air of disapprobation, blushing withal as he
  entered; Eden, whose large eyes looked bewildered until he caught sight of
  Walter and sat down beside him; Kenrick, beaming as ever, who nodded to him
  as he passed by; Henderson, who, notwithstanding the time and place, found
  opportunity to whisper to him a hope that he had washed his desirable person
  in clear water; Plumber looking as if his credulity had been gorged beyond
  endurance; Daubeny, with eyes immovably fixed in the determination to know
  his lessons that day; and lastly, Harpour, who had just time to scuffle in
  hot, breathless, and exceedingly untidy, as the chaplain began the opening
  sentence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where am I to go now?&rdquo; asked Eden, when chapel was over.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Eden, I know as little as you. You&rsquo;d better ask your
  tutor. Here, Kenrick,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;which of those black gowns
  is Mr Robertson?&mdash;this fellow&rsquo;s tutor and mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick pointed out one of the masters, to whom Eden went; and then Walter
  asked, &ldquo;Where am I to go to Mr Paton&rsquo;s form?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here, let me lead the victim to the sacrifice,&rdquo; said
  Henderson. &ldquo;O for a wreath of cypress or funeral yew,
  or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nettles?&rdquo; suggested Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Observe, new boy,&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;your eternal
  friend&rsquo;s delicate insinuation that you are a donkey. Here, come with me
  and I&rsquo;ll take you to be patted on.&rdquo; Henderson&rsquo;s exuberant
  spirits prevented his ever speaking without giving vent to slang, bad puns,
  or sheer good-humoured nonsense.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you in that form, Kenrick?&rdquo; asked Walter, as he
  saw him diverging to the right.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no! dear me, no!&rdquo; said Henderson. &ldquo;<i>I</i> am, but
  the eternal friend is at least two forms higher; he, let me tell you, is a
  star of no ordinary magnitude; he&rsquo;s in the
  Thicksides&rdquo;&mdash;meaning the Thucydides&rsquo; class.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll require no end of sky-climbing before you reach
  <i>his</i> altitude. And now, victim, behold your sacrificial priest,&rdquo;
  he said, placing Walter at the end of a table among some thirty boys who were
  seated in front of a master&rsquo;s desk in the large schoolroom, in various
  parts of which other forms were also beginning work under similar
  superintendence. When all the forms were saying lessons at the same time it
  may be imagined that the room was not very still, and that a master required
  good lungs who had to teach and talk there for hours.</p>

  <p>Not that Mr Paton&rsquo;s form contributed very much to the quota of
  general noise. Although Henderson had chaffed Daubeny on his virtuous
  stillness, yet all the boys sat very nearly as quiet as Dubbs himself during
  school hours. Even Henderson and such mercurial spirits were awed into
  silence and sobriety. You would hardly have known that in that quarter of the
  room there <i>was</i> a form at all. Quicksilver itself would have lost its
  volatility under Mr Paton&rsquo;s manipulation.</p>

  <p>It was hard at first sight to say why this was. Certainly Mr Paton set
  many punishments, but so did other masters, who had not half his success. The
  secret was that Mr Paton was something of a <i>routinier</i>, and that was
  the word which, if he had known it, Kenrick would have used to describe him.
  If he set an imposition, the imposition must be done, and must be done at a
  certain time, without appeal, and <i>causa indicta</i>. Mr Paton was as deaf
  as Pluto to all excuses, and as inexorable as Rhadamanthus in his retributive
  dispensations. Neither Orpheus nor Amphion would have moved him. Orpheus
  might have made all the desks and forms dance round as they listened to his
  song, but he could never have got Mr Paton to let off fifty lines; and
  Amphion would have been equally unsuccessful even if the walls of the court
  had come as petitioners in obedience to his strains. As for remitting a
  lesson, Mr Paton would not have done it if Saint Cecilia had offered him the
  whole wreath of red and white roses which the admiring angels twined in her
  golden hair.</p>

  <p>Mr Paton&rsquo;s rule was not the leaden rule of Lesbos (Aristophanes,
  Nic. Eth., v. 14.); it could not be bent to suit the diversities of
  individual character, but was a rule iron and inflexible, which applied
  equally to all. His measure was that of Procrustes; the cleverest boys could
  not stretch themselves beyond it, the dullest were mechanically pulled into
  its dimensions. Hence some fared hardly under it; yet let me hasten to say
  that, on the whole, with the great number of average boys, it was a success.
  The discipline which he established was perfect, and though many boys winced
  under it at the time, it was valuable to all of them, especially to those of
  an idle or sluggish tendency; and as it was rigid just as well as severe,
  they often learned to look back upon it with gratitude and respect.</p>

  <p>After a time the form went up to say a lesson. Each boy was put on in
  turn. When it came to Walter&rsquo;s turn Mr Paton first inquired his name,
  which he entered with extreme neatness in his class-book&mdash;a book in
  which there was not a single blot from the first page to the last. He then
  put him on as he had put on the rest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had no book, sir, and didn&rsquo;t know what the lesson
  was,&rdquo; said Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuses, sir, excuses!&rdquo; said Mr Paton sternly. &ldquo;You
  mean that you haven&rsquo;t learnt the lesson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A bad beginning, Evson; bring me no excuses in future. You must
  write the lesson out.&rdquo; And an ominous entry implying this fact was
  written by Walter&rsquo;s freshly-entered name. Most men would have excused
  the first punishment, and contented themselves with a word of admonition; but
  this wasn&rsquo;t Mr Paton&rsquo;s way. He held with Escalus that&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Mercy is not itself that oft looks so!<br>
    Pardon is still the nurse of second woe.&rdquo;<br></i> &mdash;(Measure for
    Measure, act two, scene 1.)<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Now it happened that Walter hated excuses, and had always looked on them
  as first cousins to lies, and he determined never again to render to Mr Paton
  any reason which could by any possibility be construed into an excuse. He
  therefore had to undergo a large amount of punishment, which he flattered
  himself could not by any possibility have been avoided.</p>

  <p>On this occasion Henderson was also turned, and with him a boy named
  Bliss. It was quite impossible for Henderson to be unemployed on some
  nonsense, and heedless of the fact that he was himself Bliss&rsquo;s
  companion in misfortune, he opened a poetry-book, and taking Lycidas as his
  model, sat unusually still, while he occupied himself in composing a
  &ldquo;Lament for Blissidas,&rdquo; beginning pathetically&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Poor Blissidas is turned; turned ere his prime<br>
    Young Blissidas, and hath not left his peer;<br>
    Who would not weep for Blissidas? He knew<br>
    Himself to say his Rep.&mdash;but give him time&mdash;<br>
    He must not quaff his glass of watery beer<br>
    Unchaffed, or write, his paper ruled and lined,<br>
    Without the meed of some melodious jeer.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lick you, Flip, after school,&rdquo; said the wrathful
  Bliss, shaking his fist, as Henderson began to whisper to him this
  monody.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do they call you Flip?&rdquo; asked Walter laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Short for Flibberty-gibbet,&rdquo; said Bliss.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bliss, Henderson, and Evson, do me two hundred lines each,&rdquo;
  said Mr Paton; and so on this, his first morning in school, a second
  punishment was entered against Walter&rsquo;s name.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whew-w-w... abomination of... spoken of by... hush!&rdquo; was
  Henderson&rsquo;s whispered comment. &ldquo;I call that hard lines.&rdquo;
  But he continued his &ldquo;Lament for Blissidas&rdquo; notwithstanding,
  introducing Saint Winifred and other mourners over Bliss&rsquo;s fate, and
  ending with the admonition that in writing the lines he was&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;To touch the tender tops of various quills,<br>
    And mind and dot his quaint enamelled i&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When Walter asked his tutor for the paper on which to write his
  punishment, Mr Robertson said to him, &ldquo;Already, Evson!&rdquo; in a tone
  of displeasure, and with a sarcasm hardly inferior to that of
  Talleyrand&rsquo;s celebrated &ldquo;Dj.&rdquo; &ldquo;Two hundred lines
  and a lesson to write out <i>already</i>!&rdquo; Bitter; with no sign of
  sympathy, without one word of inquiry, of encouragement for the future, or
  warning about the past; no advice given, no interest shown; no wonder that
  Walter never got on with his tutor.</p>

  <p>The days that began for Walter from this time were days of darkness and
  disappointment. He was not deficient in natural ability, but he had undergone
  no special training for Saint Winifred&rsquo;s School, and consequently many
  things were new to him in which other boys had been previously trained. The
  practice of learning grammar by means of Latin rules was particularly trying
  to him. He could have easily mastered the facts which the rules were intended
  to impress, but the empirical process suggested for arriving at the facts he
  could not remember, even if he could have construed the crabbed Latin in
  which it was conveyed. His father, too, had never greatly cultivated his
  powers of memory, and hence he felt serious difficulty at first with the long
  lessons that had to be learnt by heart.</p>

  <p>Mr Paton&rsquo;s system was simply this. If a boy failed in a lesson from
  any mundane cause whatever, he had to write it out; if he failed to bring it
  written out, he had to write it twice; if he was turned in a second lesson he
  was sent to detention, <i>i.e.</i>, he was kept in during play hours; if this
  process was long-continued he was sent to the headmaster in disgrace, and ran
  the chance of being flogged as an incorrigible idler. Mr Paton, who was
  devoted to a system, made no allowance for difference of ability, or for
  idiosyncrasies of temperament; he was a truly good man, at bottom a really
  kind-hearted man, and a genuine Christian; but the system which he had
  adopted was his &ldquo;idol of the cave,&rdquo; and, as we said before, the
  <i>Kavwv molubdinos</i> was unknown to him.</p>

  <p>Now, the way the system worked on Walter was this: he failed in lessons
  because they were so new to him that he found it impossible to master them.
  He was not accustomed to work in such a crowded and noisy place as the great
  schoolroom, and the early hour for going to bed left little time for evening
  work. Accordingly he often failed, and whenever he did, the impositions, or
  detentions, or both, took away from his available time for mastering his
  difficulties, and as this necessitated fresh failures, every single
  punishment became frightfully accumulative, and, alas! before three weeks
  were over, Walter was &ldquo;sent up for bad&rdquo; to the headmaster. By
  this he felt degraded and discouraged to the last degree. Moreover, harm was
  done to him in many other ways. Conscious that all this disgrace had come
  upon him without any serious fault of his own, and even in spite of his
  direct and strenuous efforts, he became oppressed with a sense of injustice
  and undeserved persecution. The apparent uselessness of every attempt to
  shake himself free from these trammels of routine rendered him desperate and
  reckless, and the serious diminution of his hours for play and exercise made
  him dispirited and out-of-sorts. And all this brought on a bitter fit of
  homesickness, during which he often thought of writing home and imploring to
  be removed from the school, or even of taking his deliverance into his own
  hands, and running away himself. But he knew that his father and mother were
  already distressed beyond measure to hear of the mill-round of punishment and
  discredit into which he had fallen, and about which he frankly informed them;
  so for their sakes he determined to bear-up a little longer.</p>

  <p>Walter was getting a bad name as an idler, and was fast losing his self-
  respect. And when that sheet-anchor is once lost, anything may happen to the
  ship; however gay its trim, however taut its sides, however delicate and
  beautiful the curve of its prow, it may drive before the gale, it may be
  dashed pitilessly among the iron rocks, or stranded hopelessly upon the
  harbour bar. A little more of this discipline, and a boy naturally
  noble-hearted and capable, might have been transformed into a mere moon-calf,
  like poor Plumber, or a cruel and vicious bully, like Harpour or Jones.</p>

  <p>Happily our young Walter was saved by other influences from losing his
  self-respect. He was saved from it by one or two kindly and genial
  friendships; by success in other lines, and by the happy consciousness that
  his presence at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s was a help and comfort to some who
  needed such assistance with sore need.</p>

  <p>One afternoon he was sitting disconsolately on a bench which ran along a
  blank wall on one side of the court, doing absolutely nothing. He was too
  disgusted with the world and with himself even to take up a novel. It was
  three o&rsquo;clock, and the court was deserted for the playground, as a
  match had been announced that afternoon between the sixth-form and the
  school, at which all but a very few (who never did anything but loaf about),
  were either playing or looking on. To sit with his head bent down, on a bench
  in an empty court doing nothing while a game was going on, was very unlike
  the Walter Evson of six weeks before; but at that moment Walter was weary of
  detention, which was just over; he was burdened with punishments, he was half
  sick for want of exercise, and he was too much out of spirits to do anything.
  Kenrick and Henderson had noticed and lamented the change in him. Not exactly
  knowing the causes of his ill-success, they were astonished to find so
  apparently clever a boy taking his place among the sluggards and dunces. With
  this, however, they concerned themselves less than with the settled gloom
  which was falling over him, and which rendered him much less available when
  they wanted to refresh themselves by talking a little nonsense, or amusing
  themselves in any other way. On this day, guessing how it was likely to be,
  Kenrick had proposed not to join the game until detention was over, and then
  to make Evson come up and play; and Henderson had kindly offered to stay with
  him, and add his persuasions to his friend&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>As they came out ready dressed for football, they caught sight of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come along, old fellow; you&rsquo;re surely going to fight for the
  school against the sixth,&rdquo; said Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too late?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; anyone is allowed a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s
  grace.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse number one bowled down,&rdquo; said Henderson.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not dressed; I shan&rsquo;t have time to put on my
  Jersey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, you&rsquo;ll only want your cap and belt, and can play
  in your shirt-sleeves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There goes excuse number two; so cut along,&rdquo; said Henderson,
  &ldquo;and get your belt. We&rsquo;ll wait for you here. Why, the eternal
  friend&rsquo;s getting as wasted with misery as the daughter of
  Babylon,&rdquo; said Henderson, as Walter ran off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kenrick. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see that
  glum look instead of the merry face he came with. Never mind; the
  game&rsquo;ll do him good; I never saw such a player; he looks just like the
  British lion when he gets into the middle of the fray; plunges at everything,
  and shakes his mane. Here he is; come along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They ran up and found a hotly-contested game swaying to and fro between
  the goals; and Walter, who was very active and a first-rate runner, was soon
  in the thick of it. As the evenness of the match grew more apparent the
  players got more and more excited. It had been already played several times,
  and no base had been kicked, except once by each side, when the scale had
  been turned by a heavy wind. Hence they exhibited the greatest eagerness, as
  school and sixth alike held it a strong point of honour to win, and a shout
  of approval greeted any successful catch or vigorous kick.</p>

  <p>Whenever the ball was driven beyond the bounds, it was kicked straight in,
  generally a short distance only, and the players on both sides struggled for
  it as it fell. During one of these momentary pauses Kenrick whispered to
  Walter, &ldquo;I say, Evson, next time it&rsquo;s driven outside I&rsquo;ll
  try to get it, and if you&rsquo;ll stand just beyond the crowd I&rsquo;ll
  kick it to you, and you can try a run.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Walter eagerly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my
  best.&rdquo; The opportunity soon occurred. Kenrick ran for the ball; a
  glance showed him where Walter was standing; he kicked it with precision, and
  not too high, so that there was no time for the rest to watch where it was
  likely to descend. Walter caught it, and before the others could recover from
  their surprise, was off like an arrow. Of course, the whole of the opposite
  side were upon him in a moment, and he had to be as quick as a deer, and as
  wary as a cat. But now his splendid running came in, and he was, besides,
  rather fresher than the rest. He dodged, he made wide dtours, he tripped
  some and sprang past others, he dived under arms and through legs, he shook
  off every touch, wrenched himself free from one capturer by leaving in his
  hands the whole shoulder of his shirt, and got nearer and nearer to the goal.
  At last he saw that there was one part of the field comparatively undefended;
  in this direction he darted like lightning&mdash;charged and spilt, by the
  vehemence of his impulse, two fellows who stood with outstretched arms to
  stop him&mdash;seized the favourable instant, and by a swift and clever
  drop-kick, sent the ball flying over the bar amid deafening cheers, just as
  half the other side flung him down and precipitated themselves over his
  body.</p>

  <p>The run was so brilliant and so plucky, and the last burst so splendid,
  that even the defeated side could hardly forbear to cheer him. As for the
  conquerors, their enthusiasm knew no bounds; they shook Walter by the hand,
  patted him on the back, clapped him, and at last lifted him on their
  shoulders for general inspection. As yet he was known to very few, and
  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that nice-looking little fellow who got the school a
  base?&rdquo; was a question which was heard on every side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Evson; Evson; Evson, a new fellow,&rdquo; answered
  Kenrick, Henderson, and all who knew him, as fast as they could, in reply to
  the general queries. They were proud to know him just then, and this little
  triumph occurred in the nick of time to raise poor Walter in his own
  estimation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Kenrick, thanks,&rdquo; he said, warmly grasping his
  friend&rsquo;s hand, as they left the field. &ldquo;They ought to have
  cheered <i>you</i>, not me, for if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you I should not
  have got that base.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have got it
  myself under any circumstances; and even if I could, it is at least as much
  pleasure to me that <i>you</i> should have done it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Of all earthly spectacles few are more beautiful, and in some respects
  more touching, than a friendship between two boys, unalloyed by any taint of
  selfishness, indiscriminating in its genuine enthusiasm, delicate in its
  natural reserve. It is not always because the hearts of men are wiser, purer,
  or better than the hearts of boys, that &ldquo;summae puerorum amicitia:
  saepe cum toga deponuntur.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>VI. &mdash; A BURST OF WILFULNESS</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&mdash;Nunquamne reponam<br>
    Vexatus toties?</i><br>
    &mdash;Juvenal i. i.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH Walter&rsquo;s football triumphs prevented him from
  losing self-respect and sinking into wretchlessness or desperation, they did
  not save him from his usual arrears of punishment and extra work. Besides
  this, it annoyed him bitterly to be always, and in spite of all effort,
  bottom, or nearly bottom, of his form. He knew that this grieved and
  disappointed his parents nearly as much as himself, and he feared that they
  would not understand the reason which, in his case, rendered it
  excusable&mdash;viz., the enormous amount of purely routine work for which
  other boys had been prepared by previous training, and in which, under his
  present discouragements and inconveniences, he felt it impossible to recover
  ground. It was hard to be below boys to whom he knew himself to be superior
  in every intellectual quality; it was hard for a boy really clever and
  lively, to be set down at once as an idler and dunce. And it made Walter very
  miserable. For meanwhile Mr Paton had taken quite a wrong view of his
  character. He answered so well at times, construed so happily, and showed
  such bright flashes of intelligence and interest in parts of his work, that
  Mr Paton, making no allowances for new methods and an untrained memory, set
  him down, by an error of judgment, as at once able and obstinate, capable of
  doing excellently, and wilfully refusing to do so. This was a phase of
  character which always excited his indignation; and it was for the
  boy&rsquo;s own sake that he set himself to correct it, if possible. On both
  sides, therefore, there was some misunderstanding, and a consequent
  exacerbation of mind which told injuriously on their daily intercourse.</p>

  <p>Walter&rsquo;s vexation and misery reached its acme on the receipt by his
  father of his first school character, which document his father sent back for
  Walter&rsquo;s own perusal, with a letter which, if not actually reproachful,
  was at least uneasy and dissatisfied in tone.</p>

  <p>For the character itself Walter cared little, knowing well that it was
  founded throughout on misapprehension; but his father&rsquo;s letter stirred
  the very depths of his heart, and made them turbid with passion and sorrow.
  He received it at dinner-time, and read it as he went across the court to the
  detention-room, of which he was now so frequent an occupant. It was a bright
  September day, and he longed to be out at some game, or among the hills, or
  on the shore. Instead of that, he was doomed for his failures to two long
  weary hours of mechanical pen-driving, of which the results were torn up when
  the two hours were over. He had had no exercise for the last week; all his
  spare time had been taken up with impositions; Mr Robertson had given him a
  severe and angry lecture that morning; even Mr Paton, who rarely used strong
  language, had called him intolerable and incorrigible, and had threatened a
  second report to the headmaster, because this was the tenth successive Greek
  grammar lesson in which he had failed. Added to all this, he was suffering
  from headache and lassitude. And now his father&rsquo;s letter was the
  cumulus of his misfortunes. A rebellious, indignant, and violent spirit rose
  in him. Was he always, for no fault of his own, to be bullied, baited,
  driven, misunderstood, and crushed in this way? If it was of no use trying to
  be good, and to do his duty, how would it do to try the other
  experiment&mdash;to fling off the trammels of duty and principle altogether;
  to do all those things which inclination suggested and the moral sense
  forbade; to enjoy himself; to declare himself on the side of pleasure and
  self-indulgence? Certainly this would save him from much unpleasantness and
  annoyance in many ways. He was young, vigorous, active; he might easily make
  himself more popular than he was with the boys; and as for the authorities,
  do what he would, it appeared that he could hardly be in worse disrepute than
  now. Vice bade high: as he thought of it all, his pen flew faster, and his
  pulse seemed to send the blood bounding through his veins as he tightened the
  grasp of his left-hand round the edge of the desk.</p>

  <p>Hitherto the ideal which he had set before him, as the standard to be
  attained during his school-life, had been one in which a successful devotion
  to duty, and a real effort to attain to &ldquo;godliness and good
  learning,&rdquo; had borne the largest share. But on this morning a very
  different ideal rose before him; he would abandon all interest in school
  work, and only aim at being a gay, high-spirited boy, living solely for
  pleasure, amusement, and self-indulgence. There were many such around
  him&mdash;heroes among their schoolfellows, popular, applauded, and proud.
  Sin seemed to sit lightly and gracefully upon them. Endowed as he was with
  every gift of person and appearance, to this condition at least he felt that
  he could easily attain. It was an ideal not, alas! unnatural to the perilous
  age:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Which claims for manhood&rsquo;s vice the privilege<br>
    Of boyhood&mdash;when young Dionysius seems<br>
    All joyous as he burst upon the East<br>
    A jocund and a welcome conqueror;<br>
    And Aphrodite, sweet as from the sea<br>
    She rose, and floated in her pearly shell<br>
    A laughing girl; when lawless will erects<br>
    Honour&rsquo;s gay temple on the Mount of God,<br>
    And meek obedience bears the coward&rsquo;s brand;<br>
    While Satan in celestial panoply<br>
    With Sin, his lady, smiling by his side,<br>
    Defies all heaven to arms.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Yes; he would follow the multitude to do all the evil which he saw being
  done around him; it looked a joyous and delightful prospect. He gazed on the
  bright vision of sin, on the iridescent waters of pleasure; and did not know
  that the brightness was a mirage of the burning desert, the iridescence a
  film of corruption over a stagnant pool.</p>

  <p>The letter from home was his chief stumbling-block. He loved his father
  and mother with almost passionate devotion; he clung to his home with an
  intensity of concentrated love. He really had tried to please them, and to do
  his best; but yet they didn&rsquo;t seem to give him credit for it. Look at
  this cold reproachful letter; it maddened him to think of it.</p>

  <p>There was only one thing which checked him. It was a little voice, which
  had been more silent lately, because other and passionate tones were heard
  more loudly; but yet even from a child poor Walter had been accustomed to
  listen with reverence to its admonitions. It was a voice behind him
  saying&mdash;&ldquo;This is the way, walk ye in it,&rdquo; now that he was
  turning aside to the right-hand or to the left. But the noble accents in
  which it whispered of patience were drowned just now in the clamorous
  turbulence of those other voices of appeal.</p>

  <p>The two hours of detention were over, and the struggle was over too.
  Walter drew his pen with a fierce and angry scrawl over the lines he had
  written, showed them up to the master in attendance with a careless and
  almost impudent air, and was hardly out of the room before he gave a shout of
  emancipation and defiance. Impatience and passion had won the day.</p>

  <p>He ran up to the playground as hard as he could tear to work off the
  excitement of his spirits, and get rid of the inward turmoil. On a grass bank
  at the far end of it he saw two boys seated, whom he knew at once to be
  Henderson and Kenrick, who, for a wonder, were reading, not green novels, but
  Shakespeare!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Henderson,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
  <i>can&rsquo;t</i> and I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> stand this any longer. It&rsquo;s
  the last detention breaks the boy&rsquo;s back. I hate Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s, I hate Dr Lane, I hate Robertson, and I <i>hate, hate,
  hate</i> Paton!&rdquo; he said, stamping angrily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hooroop!&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;so the patient Evson is on
  fire at last. Tell it not to Dubbs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Walter, what&rsquo;s all this about?&rdquo; asked Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Ken,&rdquo; said Walter, more quietly, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a
  history of my life: Greek grammar, lines, detention, caning&mdash;caning,
  detention, lines, Greek grammar. I&rsquo;m sick of it; I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
  and I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> stand it any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whether,&rdquo; spouted Henderson, from the volume on his
  knee&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whether &rsquo;twere nobler for the mind to suffer<br>
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles.<br>
    And by opposing end them!&rsquo;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;End them I will,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;somehow, I&rsquo;ll pay
  him out, depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Recte si possis si non quocunque modo,&rdquo; said Somers, the head
  of the school, whose fag Walter was, and who, passing by at the moment,
  caught the last sentence; &ldquo;what is the excitement among you small
  boys?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The old story&mdash;pitching into Paton,&rdquo; said Kenrick
  indifferently, and rather contemptuously; for he was a <i>protg</i> of
  Somers, and felt annoyed that he should see Walter&rsquo;s unreasonable
  display, the more so as Somers had asked him already, &ldquo;why he was so
  much with that idle new fellow who was always being placed lag in his
  form?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; asked Somers of Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because he gets lines for missing his grammar, I suppose.&rdquo;
  There was something in the tone which was especially offensive to Walter; for
  it sounded as if Kenrick wanted to show him the cold shoulder before his
  <i>great</i> friend, the head of the school.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i> all? Well, my dear fellow, the remedy&rsquo;s easy;
  work at it a little harder;&rdquo; and Somers walked on, humming a tune.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder what he calls <i>harder</i>,&rdquo; said Walter, shaking
  his fist; &ldquo;when I first came I used to get up quite early in the
  morning, and learn it till I was half-stupid; I wonder whether he ever did as
  much?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, but it&rsquo;s no good abusing Paton,&rdquo; said Kenrick;
  &ldquo;of course, if you don&rsquo;t know the lesson, he concludes you
  haven&rsquo;t learnt it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you for nothing, Kenrick,&rdquo; said Walter curtly;
  &ldquo;come along, Flip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick was vexed; he was conscious of having shown a little coolness and
  want of sympathy; and he looked anxiously after Henderson and Walter as they
  walked away.</p>

  <p>Presently he started up, and ran after them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
  offended, Walter, my boy,&rdquo; he said, seizing his hand. &ldquo;I
  didn&rsquo;t mean to be cold just now; but, really, I don&rsquo;t see why you
  should be so very wrathful with Paton; what can a master do if one fails in a
  lesson two or three times running? he must punish one, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hang Paton,&rdquo; said Walter, shaking off his hand rather
  angrily, for he was now thoroughly out of temper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, very well, Evson,&rdquo; said Kenrick, whose chief fault was an
  intense pride, which took fire on the least provocation, and which made him
  take umbrage at the slightest offence; &ldquo;catch me making an advance to
  you again. Henderson, you left your book on the grass;&rdquo; and turning on
  his heel, he walked slowly away&mdash;heavy at heart, for he liked Walter
  better than any other boy in the school, and was half ashamed to break with
  him about such a trifle.</p>

  <p>Henderson, apart from his somewhat frivolous and nonsensical tone, was a
  well-meaning fellow. When he was walking with Walter, he had intended to
  chaff him about his sudden burst of ill-temper, and jest away his spirit of
  revenge; but he saw that poor Walter was in no mood for jokes, and he quite
  lacked the moral courage to give good advice in a sober or serious way, or to
  recommend any course <i>because</i> it was right. This, at present, was
  beyond Henderson&rsquo;s standard of good, so he left Walter and went back
  for his book.</p>

  <p>And Walter, flinging into the schoolroom, found several spirits seven
  times more wicked than himself, and fed the fire of his wrath with the fuel
  of unbounded abuse, mockery, and scorn of Mr Paton, in which he was heartily
  abetted by the others, who hailed all indications that Walter was likely to
  become one of themselves. And that evening, instead of attempting to get up
  any of his work, Walter wasted the whole time of preparation in noise, folly,
  and turbulence; for which he was duly punished by the master on duty.</p>

  <p>He got up next morning breathing, with a sense of defiance and enjoyment,
  his new atmosphere of self-will. He, of course, broke down utterly, more
  utterly than ever, in his morning lessons, and got a proportionately longer
  imposition. Going back to his place, he purposely flung down his books on the
  desk, one after another with a bang; and for each book which he had flung
  down, Mr Paton gave him a hundred lines, whereupon he laughed sarcastically,
  and got two hundred more. Conscious that the boys were watching with some
  amusement this little exhibition of temper and trial of wills, he then took
  out a sheet of paper, wrote on it, in large letters, the words Two Hundred
  Lines for Mr Paton, and, amid the tittering of the form, carried it up to Mr
  Paton&rsquo;s desk.</p>

  <p>This was the most astoundingly impudent and insubordinate act which had
  ever been done to Mr Paton for years, and it was now his turn to be angry.
  But mastering his anger with admirable determination, he merely said,
  &ldquo;Evson, you must be beside yourself this morning; it is very rarely,
  indeed, that a new boy is so far gone in disobedience as this. I have no
  hesitation in saying that you are the most audacious and impertinent new boy
  with whom I have ever had to deal. I must cane you in my room after
  detention, to which you will of course go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Walter, with a smile of impudent
  <i>sang froid</i>; and the form tittered again as he walked noisily to his
  seat. But Mr Paton, allowing for his violent frame of mind, took no notice of
  this last affront.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Walter, taking another large piece of paper, and a spluttering
  quill pen, wrote on it, with a great deal of scratching&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Due from Evson to Mr Paton.<br>
    For missing lesson... 100 lines.<br>
    For laying down books... 300 lines.<br>
    For laughing... 200 lines.<br>
    For writing 200 lines... A caning.<br>
    Detention, of course. Thank you for nothing.</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And on the other side of the sheet he wrote in large
  letters&mdash;&ldquo;No Go!&rdquo; Which, being done, he passed the sheet
  along the form <i>pour encourager les autres</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Evson,&rdquo; said Mr Paton, quietly, &ldquo;bring me that
  paper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter took it up&mdash;looking rather alarmed this time&mdash;but with
  the side &ldquo;<i>No go</i>!&rdquo; uppermost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is this, Evson?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Number ninety, sir,&rdquo; said Walter, amid the now unconcealed
  laughter of the rest, who knew very well that he had intended it for
  &ldquo;No go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Paton looked curiously at Walter for a minute, and then said,
  &ldquo;Evson, Evson, I could not have thought you so utterly foolish. Well,
  you know that each fresh act <i>must</i> have its fresh punishment. You must
  leave the room now, and <i>besides all your other punishments</i> I must also
  report you to the headmaster. You can best judge with what result.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was a mistake of Mr Paton&rsquo;s&mdash;a mistake of judgment
  only&mdash;for which he cannot be blamed. But it was a disastrous mistake.
  Had he been at all a delicate judge or reader of the phenomena of character,
  he would have observed at once that at that moment there was a wild spirit of
  anger, a rankling sense of injustice and persecution in Walter&rsquo;s heart,
  which no amount of punishment could have cowed. Walter just then might
  without the least difficulty have been goaded into some act of violence which
  would have rendered expulsion from the school an unavoidable consequence. So
  easy is it to petrify the will, to make a boy bad in spite of himself, and to
  spoil, with no intentions but those of kindliness and justice, the promise of
  a fair young life. For when the will has once been suffered to grow rigid by
  obstinacy&mdash;a result which is very easy to avoid&mdash;no power on earth
  can bend it <i>at the time</i>. Had Mr Paton sent Walter out of the room
  before; had he at the end said, &ldquo;Evson, you are not yourself to-day,
  and I forgive you,&rdquo; Walter would have been in a moment as docile and as
  humble as a child. But as it was, he left the room quite coolly, with a sneer
  on his lips, and banged the door; yet the next moment, when he found himself
  in the court alone, unsupported by the countenance of those who enjoyed his
  rebelliousness, he seated himself on a bench in the courtyard, hung his head
  on his breast, and burst into a flood of tears. If any friend could have seen
  him at that moment, or spoken one word in season, how much pain the poor boy
  might have been saved! Kenrick happened to cross the court; the moment Walter
  caught sight of him he sat with head erect and arms folded, but Kenrick was
  not to be deceived. He had caught one glimpse of Walter first; he saw his
  eyes wet with tears, and knew that he was in trouble. He hung on his foot
  doubtfully for one moment&mdash;but then his pride came in; he remembered the
  little pettish repulse in the playground the day before; the opportunity was
  lost, and he walked slowly on. And Walter&rsquo;s heart grew as hard within
  him as a stone.</p>

  <h2>VII. &mdash; VOGUE LA GALRE</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Ah! Diamond, thou little knowest what mischief thou hast done.</i><br>
    &mdash;Life of Sir I. Newton.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">THAT afternoon Mr Paton, going into the Combination Room,
  where the masters often met, threw himself into one of the armchairs with an
  unwonted expression of vexation and disgust on his usually placid
  features.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with you, Paton?&rdquo; asked Mr
  Robertson. &ldquo;Is to-day&rsquo;s <i>Times</i> too liberal for your
  notions, or what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr Paton; &ldquo;but I have just been caning Evson,
  a new boy, and the fellow&rsquo;s stubborn obstinacy and unaccountable
  coolness annoy me exceedingly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O yes; he&rsquo;s a pupil of mine, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, and he
  has never been free from punishment since he came. Even your Procrustean rule
  seems to fail with him, Paton. What have you been obliged to cane him
  for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Paton related Walter&rsquo;s escapade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, of course you had no choice but to cane him,&rdquo; replied
  his colleague, &ldquo;for such disobedience; but how did he take
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the oddest way possible. He came in with punctilious politeness,
  obviously assumed, with sarcastic intentions. When I took up the cane he
  stood with arms folded, and a singularly dogged look; in fact, his manner
  disarmed me. You know I detest caning, and I really could not do it, never
  having had occasion for it for months together. I gave him two cuts, and then
  left off. &lsquo;May I go, sir?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said,
  and he left the room with a bow and a &lsquo;Thank you, sir.&rsquo; I am
  really sorry for the boy; for as I was obliged to send him to Dr Lane, he
  will probably get another flogging from him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a worthless boy he must be,&rdquo; answered Mr Robertson.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not exactly worthless; there&rsquo;s something about him I
  can&rsquo;t help liking; but most impudent and stubborn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Mr Percival, another of the masters, who had
  been listening attentively to the conversation; &ldquo;I humbly venture to
  think that you&rsquo;re both mistaken in that boy. I like him exceedingly,
  and think him as promising a lad as any in the school. I never knew any boy
  behave more modestly and respectfully.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, how do you know anything of him?&rdquo; asked Mr Robertson in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only by accident. I had once or twice noticed him among the
  <i>detenus</i>, and being sorry to think that a new boy should be an
  <i>habitu</i> of the extra schoolroom, I asked him one day why he was sent.
  He told me that it was for failing in a lesson, and when I asked why he
  hadn&rsquo;t learnt it, he said, very simply and respectfully, &lsquo;I
  really did my very best, sir; but it&rsquo;s all new work to me.&rsquo; Look
  at the boy&rsquo;s innocent, engaging face, and you will be sure that he was
  telling me the truth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; continued Mr Percival, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
  think this very slight ground for setting my opinion against yours; but I was
  pleased with Evson&rsquo;s manner, and asked him to come and take a stroll on
  the shore, that I might know something more of him. Do you know, I never
  found a more intelligent companion. He was all life and vivacity; it was
  quite a pleasure to be with him. Being new to the sea, he didn&rsquo;t know
  the names of the commonest things on the shore, and if you had seen his face
  light up as he kept picking up whelk&rsquo;s eggs, and mermaid&rsquo;s
  purses, and zoophytes, and hermit-crabs, and bits of plocamium or coralline,
  and asking me all I could tell him about them, you would not have thought him
  a stupid or worthless boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Percival; <i>you</i> are a regular conjuror.
  All sorts of ne&rsquo;er-do-wells succeed under your manipulation.
  You&rsquo;re a first-rate hand at gathering grapes from thorns, and figs from
  thistles. Why, even out of that Caliban, old Woods, you used to extract a
  gleam of human intelligence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t a Caliban at all. I found him an excellent fellow
  at heart; but what could you expect of a boy who, because he was big,
  awkward, and stupid, was always getting flouted on all sides? Sir Hugh Evans
  is not the only person who disliked being made a &lsquo;vlouting-
  stog.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must have some talisman for transmuting boys if you consider
  old Woods an excellent fellow, Percival. I found him a mass of laziness and
  brute strength. Do give me your secret.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Try a little kindness and sympathy. I have no other
  secret.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not conscious of failing in kindness,&rdquo; said Mr
  Robertson drily. &ldquo;My fault, I think, is being too kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To clever, promising, bright boys&mdash;yes; to unthankful and evil
  boys (excuse me for saying so)&mdash;no. You don&rsquo;t try to descend to
  their dull level, and so understand their difficulties. You don&rsquo;t
  suffer fools gladly, as we masters ought to do. But, Paton,&rdquo; he said,
  turning the conversation, which seemed distasteful to Mr Robertson,
  &ldquo;will you try how it succeeds to lay the yoke a little less heavily on
  Evson?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Percival, I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ve consciously
  bullied him. I can&rsquo;t make my system different to him and other
  boys.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Paton, forgive my saying that I don&rsquo;t think that a
  rigid system is the fairest; <i>summa lex summa crux</i>. Fish of very
  different sorts and sizes come to our nets, and you can&rsquo;t shove a
  turbot through the same mesh that barely admits a sprat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of what you say; but I must leave him in Dr
  Lane&rsquo;s hands now,&rdquo; said Mr Paton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who, I heartily hope, won&rsquo;t flog him,&rdquo; said Mr
  Percival.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why? I don&rsquo;t see how he can do otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because it will simply drive him to despair; because, if I know
  anything of his character, it will have upon him an effect incalculably
  bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Mr Paton.</p>

  <p>The conversation dropped, and Mr Percival resumed his newspaper.</p>

  <p>When Walter went to Dr Lane in the evening, the Doctor inquired kindly and
  carefully into the nature of his offence. This, unfortunately, was clear
  enough, and Walter was far too ingenuous to attempt any extenuation of it.
  Even if he had not been intentionally idle, it was plain, on his own
  admission, that he had been guilty of the greatest possible insubordination
  and disrespect. These offences were rare at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, and
  especially rare in a new boy. Puzzled as he was by conduct so unlike the
  boy&rsquo;s apparent character, and interested by his natural and manly
  manner, yet Dr Lane had in this case no alternative but the infliction of
  corporal punishment.</p>

  <p>Humiliated again, and full of bitter anger, Walter returned to the great
  schoolroom, where he was received with sympathy and kindness by the others in
  his class. It was the dark part of the evening before tea-time, and the boys,
  sitting idly round the fire, were in an apt mood for folly and mischief. They
  began a vehement discussion about Paton&rsquo;s demerits, and called him
  every hard name they could invent. Walter took little part in this, for he
  was smarting too severely under the sense of oppression to find relief in
  mere abuse; but, from his flashing eyes and the dark scowl that sat so ill on
  his face it was evident that a bad spirit had obtained the thorough mastery
  over all his better and gentler impulses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we do something to serve the fellow out?&rdquo; said
  Anthony, one of the boys in Walter&rsquo;s dormitory.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But <i>what</i> can we do?&rdquo; asked several.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, indeed?&rdquo; asked Henderson, mockingly; and as it was his
  way to quote whatever he had last been reading, he began to spout from the
  peroration of a speech which he had seen in the
  paper&mdash;&ldquo;Aristocracy, throned on the citadel of power, and strong
  in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a fool you are, Henderson,&rdquo; observed Franklin, another
  of the group; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we can do: we&rsquo;ll burn
  that horrid black book in which he enters the detentions and
  impositions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor book!&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;what pangs of conscience
  it will suffer in the flames! Give it not the glory of such martyrdom.
  Walter,&rdquo; he continued, in a lower voice, &ldquo;I hope that
  you&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with this humbug?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will though, Henderson; if I&rsquo;m to have nothing but canings
  and floggings, I may just as well be caned and flogged for <i>something</i>
  as for <i>nothing</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The desk&rsquo;s locked,&rdquo; said Anthony; &ldquo;we
  shan&rsquo;t be able to get hold of the imposition-book.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle that,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;here, just hand
  me the poker, Dubbs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall do no such thing,&rdquo; said Daubeny quietly, and his
  reply was greeted with a shout of derision.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, you poor coward, Dubbs,&rdquo; said Franklin, &ldquo;you
  <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> get anything for handing the poker.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never supposed I could, Franklin,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;and
  as for being a coward, the real cowardice would be to do what&rsquo;s absurd
  and wrong for fear of being laughed at or being kicked. Well, you may hit
  me,&rdquo; he said quietly, as Franklin twisted his arm tightly round, and
  hit him on it, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t make me do what I don&rsquo;t
  choose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Franklin, twisting his arm still more
  tightly, and hitting harder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll try in vain,&rdquo; answered Daubeny, though the tears
  stood in his eyes at the violent pain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drop his arm, you Franklin,&rdquo; indignantly exclaimed Henderson,
  who, though he was always teasing Daubeny, was very fond of him; &ldquo;drop
  his arm, or, by Jove! you&rsquo;ll find that two can play at that. Dubbs is
  quite right, and you&rsquo;re a set of asses if you think you&rsquo;ll do any
  good by burning the punishment book. I&rsquo;ve got the poker, and you
  shan&rsquo;t have it to knock the desk open. I suppose Paton can afford
  sixpence to buy another book; and enter a tolerable fresh score against you
  for this besides.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t remember my six hundred lines, and four or five
  detentions,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;Here, give me the poker.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh! pooh! Evson, of course he&rsquo;ll remember them. Here,
  I&rsquo;ll help you with the lines; I&rsquo;ll do a couple of hundred for
  you, and the rest you can write with two pens at a time; it won&rsquo;t take
  you an hour. I&rsquo;ll show you the two-pen dodge; I&rsquo;ll admit you into
  the two-pen-etralia. Like Milton, you shall &lsquo;touch the slender tops of
  various quills.&rsquo; No, no,&rdquo; he continued, in a playful tone in
  order not to make Walter in a greater passion than he was, &ldquo;you
  can&rsquo;t have the poker; anyone who wants that must take it from me <i>vi
  et armis</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter; this&rsquo;ll do as well; and here
  goes,&rdquo; said Walter, seizing a wooden stool. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
  desk open for you,&rdquo; he said, as he brought the top of the stool with a
  strong blow against the lid, and burst the lock with a great crash.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My eyes! we <i>shall</i> get into a row,&rdquo; said Franklin,
  opening his eyes to illustrate his exclamation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s done&rsquo;s done; let&rsquo;s all take our
  share,&rdquo; said Anthony, diving his hand into the desk.
  &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the imposition-book for you, and here goes leaf number
  one into the fire; you can tear out the next if you like,
  Franklin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Franklin; &ldquo;in for a penny in for a
  pound; there <i>goes</i> the second leaf.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And here the third; over ankles over knees,&rdquo; said Barton,
  another of those present.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Proverbial Fool-osophy,&rdquo; observed Henderson, contemptuously,
  as Burton handed him the book. &ldquo;Shall I be a silly sheep like the rest
  of you, and leap over the bridge because your leader has? I suppose I must,
  though it&rsquo;s very absurd.&rdquo; He wavered and hesitated; sensible
  enough to disapprove of so useless a proceeding, he yet did not like to be
  thought afraid. He minded what fellows would <i>think</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do what&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Daubeny, &ldquo;and shame the
  devil. Here, give me the book. Now, you fellows, you&rsquo;ve torn out these
  leaves, and done quite mischief enough. Let me put the book back, and
  don&rsquo;t be like children who hit the fender against which they&rsquo;ve
  knocked their heads.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or dogs that bite the stick they&rsquo;ve been thrashed
  with,&rdquo; said Henderson. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Dubbs, and I respect
  you; ay, you fellows may sneer if you like, but I advised you not to do it,
  and I won&rsquo;t make myself an idiot because you do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; drawled Howard Tracy. &ldquo;I hate Paton, and
  I&rsquo;ll do anything to spite him,&rdquo; whereupon he snatched the book
  from Daubeny, and threw it entire into the flames. Poor Tracy had been even
  in more serious scrapes with Mr Paton than Walter had; his vain manner was
  peculiarly abhorrent to the master, who took every opportunity of snubbing
  him; but nothing would pierce through the thick cloak of Tracy&rsquo;s
  conceit, and fully satisfied with himself, his good looks, and his
  aristocratic connections, he sat down in contented ignorance, and despised
  learning too much to be in the least put out by being invariably the last in
  his form.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, is there nothing left for me to burn?&rdquo; said Walter, who
  sat glowering on the high iron fender, and swinging his legs impatiently.
  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what else there is in the desk. Here are a pack of old
  exercises, apparently; they&rsquo;ll make a jolly blaze. Stop, though,
  <i>are</i> they old exercises? Well, never mind; if not, so much the better.
  In they shall go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop! what <i>are</i> you doing, Walter?&rdquo; said Henderson,
  catching him by the arm; &ldquo;you know these can&rsquo;t be old exercises.
  Paton always puts <i>them</i> in his waste-paper basket, not in his desk. Oh,
  Walter, what <i>have</i> you done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The outside sheets were exercises anyhow,&rdquo; said Walter
  gloomily. &ldquo;Here, it&rsquo;s no good trying to save them now, whatever
  they were&rdquo; (for Henderson was attempting to rake them out between the
  bars); &ldquo;they&rsquo;re done for now,&rdquo; and he pressed down the
  thick mass of foolscap into the reddest centre of the fire, and held it there
  until nothing remained of it but a heap of flaky crimson ashes.</p>

  <p>A dead silence followed, for the boys felt that now, at any rate, they
  were &ldquo;in for it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sound of the tea-bell prevented further mischief; and as Henderson
  thrust his arm through Walter&rsquo;s, he said, &ldquo;Oh, Evson, I wish you
  hadn&rsquo;t done that! I wish I&rsquo;d got you to come away before. What a
  passionate fellow you are!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s done now,&rdquo; said Walter, already beginning to
  soften, and to repent of his fatuity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; said Henderson anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take the consequences, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; answered
  Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better go and tell Paton about it at once instead
  of letting him find it out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s done nothing but bully
  me, and I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then let me go,&rdquo; said his friend earnestly. &ldquo;I know
  Paton well; I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d be ready to forgive you, if I explained
  it all to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very good, Flip; but don&rsquo;t go:&mdash;it&rsquo;s
  too late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Walter, you mustn&rsquo;t think that I had no share in this
  because of being afraid. I was one of the group, and I&rsquo;ll share the
  punishment with you, whatever it is. I hope for your sake it won&rsquo;t be
  found out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But if Henderson had seen a little deeper he would have hoped that it
  would be found out, for there is nothing that works quicker ruin to any
  character than undiscovered sin. It was happy for Walter that his wrong
  impulses did <i>not</i> remain undiscovered; happy for him that they came so
  rapidly to be known and to be punished.</p>

  <p>It was noised through the school in five minutes that Evson, one of the
  new fellows, had smashed open Paton&rsquo;s desk and burned the contents.
  &ldquo;What an awful row he&rsquo;ll get into!&rdquo; was the general
  comment. Walter heard Kenrick inquiring eagerly about it as they sat at tea;
  but Kenrick didn&rsquo;t ask <i>him</i> about it, though they sat so near
  each other. After the foolish, proud manner of sensitive boys, Walter and
  Kenrick, though each liked the other none the less, were not on speaking
  terms. Walter, less morbidly proud than Kenrick, would not have suffered this
  silly alienation to continue had not his attention been occupied by other
  troubles. Neither of them, therefore, liked to be the first to break the ice,
  and now in his most serious difficulty Walter had lost the advice and
  sympathy of his most intimate friend.</p>

  <p>The fellows seemed to think that he must inevitably be expelled for this
  <i>fracas</i>. The poor boy&rsquo;s thoughts were very, very bitter as he
  laid his head that night on his restless pillow, remembered what an
  ungovernable fool he had been, and dreamt of his happy and dear-loved home.
  How strangely he seemed to have left his old, innocent life behind him, and
  how little he would have believed it possible, two months ago, that he could
  by any conduct of his own have so soon incurred, or nearly incurred, the
  penalty of expulsion from Saint Winifred&rsquo;s School.</p>

  <p>He had certainly yielded very quickly to passion, and he felt that in
  consequence he had made his position more serious than that of other boys who
  were in every sense of the word twice as bad as himself. But what he laid to
  the score of his ill-luck was in truth a very happy providence by which
  punishment was sent speedily and heavily upon him, and so his evil
  tendencies, mercifully nipped in the bud, crushed with a tender yet with an
  iron hand before they had expanded more blossoms and been fed by deeper
  roots. He might have been punished less speedily had his faults been more
  radical, or his wrong-doings of a deeper dye.</p>

  <h2>VIII. &mdash; THE BURNT MANUSCRIPT</h2>

  <blockquote>
    ... All<br>
    <i>All my poor scrapings, from a dozen years<br>
    Of dust and desk-work.</i><br>
    &mdash;Sea Dreams.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">IT may be supposed that during chapel the next morning, and
  when he went into early school, Walter was in an agony of almost unendurable
  suspense; and this suspense was doomed to be prolonged for some time, until
  at last he could hardly sit still. Mr Paton did not at once notice that his
  desk was broken. He laid down his books, and went on as usual with the
  morning lesson.</p>

  <p>At length Tracy was put on. He stood up in his usual self-satisfied way,
  looking admiringly at his boots, and running his delicate white hand through
  his scented hair. Mr Paton watched him with a somewhat contemptuous
  expression, as though he were thinking what a pity it was that any boy should
  be such a little puppy. Henderson, with his usual quick discrimination, had
  nicknamed Tracy the &ldquo;Lisping Hawthornbud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your fifth failure this week, Tracy; you must do the usual
  punishment,&rdquo; said Mr Paton, taking up his key to unlock the desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now for it,&rdquo; thought all the form, looking on with great
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>The key caught hopelessly in the broken lock. Mr Paton&rsquo;s attention
  was aroused; he pushed the lid off the desk, and saw at once that it had been
  broken open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who has broken open my desk?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>He looked very grave, but said nothing, looking for his imposition-
  book.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is my imposition-book?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And where is my&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Paton stopped, and looked with the greatest eagerness over every corner
  of the desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is the manuscript I left here with my imposition-
  book?&rdquo; he said in a tone of the most painful anxiety.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do hope and trust,&rdquo; he said, turning pale, &ldquo;that none
  of you have been wicked enough to injure it,&rdquo; and here his voice
  faltered. &ldquo;When I tell you that it was of the utmost value, I am sure
  that if any of you have concealed or taken it, you will give it back at
  once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was deep silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Once again,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;where is my imposition-
  book?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Burnt, sir; burnt, sir,&rdquo; said one or two voices, hardly above
  a whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And my manuscript?&rdquo; he asked, in a louder voice, and in still
  greater agitation. &ldquo;Surely, surely, you cannot have been so
  thoughtless, so incredibly unjust as to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter stood up in his place, with his head bent, and his face covered
  with an ashy whiteness. &ldquo;I burnt it, sir,&rdquo; he said, in an almost
  inaudible voice, and trembling with fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; said Mr Paton impetuously; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
  hear what you say. Now, then,&rdquo; he continued, as Walter crept up beside
  his desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I burnt it, sir,&rdquo; he said, in a whisper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;burnt&mdash;it!&rdquo; said Mr Paton, starting up in
  uncontrollable emotion, which changed into a burst of anger as he gave Walter
  a box on the ear which sounded all over the room, and made the boy stagger
  back to his place. But the flash of rage was gone in an instant; and the next
  moment Mr Paton, afraid of trusting himself any longer, left his desk and
  hurried out, anxious to recover in solitude the calmness of mind and action
  which had been so terribly disturbed.</p>

  <p>Mr Percival, who taught his form in another part of the room, seeing Mr
  Paton box Walter so violently on the ear, and knowing that this was the very
  reverse of his usual method, since he had never before touched a boy in
  anger, walked up to see what was the matter, just as Mr Paton, with great
  hurried strides, had reached the door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter with Mr Paton?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>There was a general murmur through the form, out of which Mr Percival
  caught something about Mr Paton&rsquo;s papers having been burnt.</p>

  <p>Anxious to fend him, to ask what had happened, Mr Percival, leaving the
  room, caught sight of him pacing with hasty and uneven steps along a private
  garden walk which belonged to the masters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope nothing unpleasant has occurred,&rdquo; he said, overtaking
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, nothing,&rdquo; said Mr Paton, with quivering lip, as
  he turned aside. And then, suppressing his emotion by a powerful effort of
  self-control, &ldquo;It is only,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the hard results
  of fifteen years&rsquo; continuous labour are now condensed into a heap of
  smut and ashes in the schoolroom fire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that your Hebrew manuscripts are
  burnt?&rdquo; asked Mr Percival in amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know how I have been toiling at them for years, Percival; you
  know that I began them before I left college, that I regarded them as the
  chief work of my life, and that I devoted to them every moment of my leisure.
  You know, too, the pride and pleasure which I took in their progress, and the
  relief with which I turned to them from the vexations and anxieties of
  one&rsquo;s life here. To work at them has been for years my only recreation
  and delight. Well, they were finished at last; I was only correcting them for
  the press; they would have gone to the printer in a month, and I should have
  lived to complete a toilsome and honourable task. Well, the dream is over,
  and a handful of ashes represents the struggle of my best years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Percival knew well that his coadjutor had been working for years at a
  commentary on the Hebrew text of the Four Greater Prophets. It had been the
  cherished and chosen task of his life; he had brought to it great stores of
  learning, accumulated in the vigour of his powers, and the enthusiasm of a
  youthful ambition, and he had employed upon it every spare hour left him from
  his professional duties. He looked to it as the means of doing essential
  service to the church of which he was an ordained member, and, secondarily,
  as the road to reputation and well-merited advancement. And in five minutes
  the hand of one angry boy had robbed him of the fruit of all his hopes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If they wanted to display the hatred which I well know that they
  feel,&rdquo; said Mr Paton bitterly, &ldquo;they might have chosen any way,
  literally <i>any way</i>, but that. They might have left me, at least, that
  which was almost my only pleasure and object in life, and which had no
  connection with them or their pursuits.&rdquo; And his face grew haggard as
  he stopped in his walk, and tried to realise the extent of what he had lost.
  &ldquo;I would rather have seen everything I possess in the whole world
  destroyed than that,&rdquo; he said slowly, and with strong emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And was it really Evson who did this?&rdquo; asked Mr Percival,
  filled with the sincerest pity for his colleague&rsquo;s wounded
  feelings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It matters little who did it, Percival; but, yes, it was your
  friend Evson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The little, graceless, abominable wretch!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr
  Percival with anger, &ldquo;he must be expelled. But can&rsquo;t you
  recommence the task?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Recommence?&rdquo; said Mr Paton, in a hard voice; &ldquo;and who
  will give me back the hope and vigour of the last fifteen years? how shall I
  have the heart again to toil through the same long trains of research and
  thought? where are the hundreds of references which I had sought out and
  verified with hours of heavy midnight labour? how am I to have access again
  to the scores of books which I consulted before I began to work? The very
  thought of it sickens me. Youth and hope are over. No, Percival, there is no
  more to be said. I am robbed of a life&rsquo;s work. Leave me, please, alone
  for a little, until I have learnt to say less bitterly, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s
  will be done.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;... He needeth not<br>
    Either man&rsquo;s work or his own gifts; who best<br>
    Bear his mild yoke they please him best,&rsquo;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">said Mr Percival, in a tone of kind and deep sympathy, as he
  left him to return to the schoolroom.</p>

  <p>But once in sight of Mr Paton&rsquo;s open and rifled desk, Mr
  Percival&rsquo;s pent-up indignation burst forth into clear flame. Stopping
  in front of Mr Paton&rsquo;s form, he exclaimed, in a voice that rang with
  scorn and sorrow&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You boys do not know the immense mischief which your thoughtless
  and worthless spite and folly have caused. I say &lsquo;boys,&rsquo; but I
  believe, and rejoice to believe, that one only of you is guilty, and I
  rejoice too, that <i>that</i> one is a new boy, who must have brought here
  feelings and passions more worthy of an ignorant and ill-trained plough-boy
  than of a Saint Winifred&rsquo;s scholar. The hand that would burn a valuable
  manuscript would fire a rick of hay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O sir,&rdquo; said Henderson, starting up and interrupting him,
  &ldquo;we were all very nearly as bad. It was the rest of us that burnt the
  imposition-book; Evson had nothing to do with that.&rdquo; Henderson had
  forgotten for the moment that he at least had had no share in burning the
  imposition-book, for his warm quick heart could not bear that these blows
  should fall unbroken on his friend&rsquo;s head.</p>

  <p>But his generous effort failed; for Mr Percival, barely noticing the
  interruption, continued, &ldquo;The imposition-book? I know nothing about
  that. If you burnt it you were very foolish and reckless; you deserve no
  doubt to be punished for it, but that was <i>comparatively</i> nothing. But
  do you know, bad boy,&rdquo; he said, turning again to Walter, &ldquo;do you
  know what <i>you</i> have done? Do you know that your dastardly spitefulness
  has led you to destroy writings which had cost your master years and years of
  toil that cannot be renewed? He treated you with unswerving impartiality; he
  never punished you but when you deserved punishment, and when he believed it
  to be for your good, and yet you turn upon him in this adder-like way; you
  break open his desk like a thief, and, in one moment of despicable
  ill-temper, you rob him and the world of that which had been the pursuit and
  object of his life. You, Evson, may well hide your face&rdquo;&mdash;for
  Walter had bent over the desk, and in agonies of shame and remorse had
  covered his face with both hands&mdash;&ldquo;you may well be ashamed to look
  either at me or at any honest and manly and right-minded boy among your
  companions. You have done a wrong for which it will be years hence a part of
  your retribution to remember that nothing you can ever do can repair it, or
  do away with its effects. I am more than disappointed with you. You have done
  mischief which the utmost working of all your powers cannot for years
  counterbalance, if, instead of being as base and idle as you now appear to
  be, you were to devote your whole heart to work. I don&rsquo;t know what will
  be done to you; I, for my part, hope that you will not be suffered to remain
  with us; but, if you are, I am sure that you will receive, as you richly
  deserve, the reprobation and contempt of every boy among your schoolfellows
  who is capable of one spark of honour or right feeling.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Every word that Mr Percival had said came to poor Walter with the most
  poignant force; all the master&rsquo;s reproaches pierced his heart and let
  blood. He sat there not stirring, stunned and crushed, as though he had been
  beaten by the blows of a hammer. He quailed and shuddered to think of the
  great and cruel injustice, the base and grievous injury into which his blind
  passion had betrayed him, and thought that he could never hold up his head
  again.</p>

  <p>Mr Percival&rsquo;s indignant expostulation passed over the other culprits
  who heard it like a thunderstorm. There was a force and impetuosity in this
  gentleman&rsquo;s manner, when his anger was kindled, which had long gained
  for him among the boys, with whom he was the most popular of all the masters,
  the half-complimentary soubriquet of &ldquo;Thunder-and-lightning.&rdquo;
  But none of them had ever before heard him speak with such concentrated
  energy and passion, and all except generous little Henderson were awed by it
  into silence. But Henderson at that moment was wholly absorbed in
  Walter&rsquo;s sorrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said he in Walter&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;tell him it
  was all a mistake, that you thought the papers were old exercises. Dear
  Walter, tell him before he goes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Walter still rested with his white cheeks on his hands upon the desk,
  and neither moved nor spoke. And Mr Percival, turning indignantly upon his
  heel, with one last glance of unmitigated contempt, had walked off to his own
  form.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walter, don&rsquo;t take it to heart so,&rdquo; said Henderson,
  putting his arm round his neck; &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t help it; you made a
  sad mistake, that&rsquo;s all. Go and tell Paton so, and I&rsquo;m sure
  he&rsquo;ll forgive you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A slight quiver was all that showed that Walter heard. Henderson would
  have liked to see his anguish relieved by a burst of tears; but the tears did
  not come, and Walter did not move.</p>

  <p>At last a hand touched him, and he heard the voice of the head boy say to
  him, &ldquo;Get up, Evson; I&rsquo;m to take you to Dr Lane with a note from
  Mr Percival.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He rose and followed mechanically, waiting in the headmaster&rsquo;s porch
  while the monitor went in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dr Lane won&rsquo;t see you now,&rdquo; said Somers, coming out
  again. &ldquo;Croft,&rdquo; (addressing the school Famulus), &ldquo;Dr Lane
  says you&rsquo;re to lock up Mr Evson by himself in the private
  room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter followed the Famulus to the private room, a little room at the top
  of the house, where he knew that boys were locked previous to expulsion, that
  they might have no opportunity for doing any mischief before they went.</p>

  <p>The Famulus left him here, and returned a few minutes after with some dry
  bread and milk, which he placed on the deal table, which, with a wooden
  chair, constituted the sole furniture of the room; he then locked the door,
  and left Walter finally to his own reflections.</p>

  <p>Then it was that flood after flood of passionate tears seemed to remove
  the iron cramp which had pained his heart. He flung himself on the floor, and
  as he thought of the irreparable cruelty which he had inflicted on a man who
  had been severe indeed, but never unkind to him, and of the apparent
  malignity to which all who heard it would attribute what he had done, he
  sobbed and sobbed as though his heart would break.</p>

  <p>At one o&rsquo;clock the Famulus returned with some dinner. He found
  Walter sitting at a corner of the room, his head resting against the angle of
  the wall, and his eyes red and inflamed with long crying. The morning&rsquo;s
  meal still lay untasted on the table.</p>

  <p>He looked round with a commiserating glance. &ldquo;Come, come, Master
  Evson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve no call to give way so, sir. If
  you&rsquo;ve done wrong, the wrong&rsquo;s done now, and frettin&rsquo;
  won&rsquo;t help it. There&rsquo;s them above as&rsquo;ll forgive you, and
  make you do better next time, lad, if you only knew it. Here, you must eat
  some of this dinner, Master Evson, and leave off cryin&rsquo; so;
  cryin&rsquo;s no comfort, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stood by and waited on Walter with the greatest kindness and respect,
  till he had seen him swallow some food, not without difficulty, and then with
  encouraging and cheerful words left him, and once more locked the door.</p>

  <p>The weary afternoon wore on, and Walter sat mournfully alone with nothing
  but miserable thoughts&mdash;miserable to whatever subject he turned them,
  and more miserable the longer he dwelt on them. As the shades of evening drew
  in he felt his head swimming, and the long solitude made him feel afraid as
  he wondered whether they would leave him there all night. And then he heard a
  light step approach the door, and a gentle tap. He made no answer, for he
  thought he knew the step, and he could not summon up voice to speak for a fit
  of sobbing which it brought on. Then he heard the boy stoop down, and push a
  note under the door.</p>

  <p>He took it up when he heard the footsteps die away, and by the fast
  failing light was just able to make it out. It ran thus&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Dear Walter,&mdash;You can&rsquo;t think how sorry, how very,
    very sorry I am for you. I wish I could be with you and take part of your
    punishment. Forgive me for being cold and proud to you. I have been longing
    to speak to you all the time, but felt too shy. It was all my fault. I will
    never break with you again. Good-bye, dear Walter, from your ever and truly
    affectionate, Harry Kenrick.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;He will never break with me again,&rdquo; thought Walter. &ldquo;If
  I&rsquo;m to go to-morrow I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll never have the
  chance.&rdquo; And then his saddest thoughts reverted to the home which he
  had left so recently for the first time, and to which he was to return with
  nothing but dishonour and disgrace.</p>

  <p>At six o&rsquo;clock the kind-hearted Famulus brought him a lamp, some
  tea, and one or two books, which he had no heart to read. No one was allowed
  to visit the private room under heavy penalties, so that Walter had no other
  visitor until eight, when Somers, the monitor who had taken him to Dr Lane,
  looked in and icily observed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to sleep in the sickroom,
  Evson; come with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I expelled, Somers?&rdquo; he faltered out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Somers in a freezing tone;
  &ldquo;you deserve to be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>True! oh lofty and pitiless Somers. But is that all which you could find
  to say to the poor boy in his distress? And if we <i>all</i> had our
  deserts...?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; Somers added, &ldquo;I for one won&rsquo;t have
  you as a fag any longer, and I shouldn&rsquo;t think that anyone else would
  either.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With which cutting remark he left Walter to his reflections.</p>

  <h2>IX. &mdash; PENITENCE</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>...If hearty sorrow<br>
    Be a sufficient ransom for offence,<br>
    I tender it here; I do as truly suffer<br>
    As e&rsquo;er I did commit.&rdquo;</i><br>
    &mdash;Two Gentlemen of Verona.&mdash;Act five, scene 4.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning Walter was reconducted to the private room, and
  there, with a kind of dull pain in head and heart, awaited the sentence which
  was to decide his fate. His fancy had left Saint Winifred&rsquo;s altogether;
  it was solely occupied with Semlyn, and the dear society at home. Walter was
  rehearsing again and again in his mind the scene of his return; what he
  should say to his father; how he should dry his mother&rsquo;s tears; and how
  he should bear himself, on his return, towards his little brothers and
  sisters. Would he, expelled from Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, ever be able to look
  anyone in the face again at home?</p>

  <p>While he was brooding over these fancies, someone, breathless with haste,
  ran up to his room, and again a note was thrust underneath the door. He
  seized it quickly, and read&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Dear Walter,&mdash;I am so glad to be the first to tell you that
    you are not to be expelled. Paton has begged you off. No time for more. I
    have slipped away before morning school to leave you this news, and
    can&rsquo;t stay lest I should be caught. Good-bye, from your ever
    affectionate friend, &mdash;H.K.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The boy&rsquo;s heart gave one bound of joy as he read this. If he were
  not expelled he was ready to bear meekly any other punishment appointed to
  his offence. But his banishment from the school would cause deep affliction
  to others besides himself, and this was why he had dreaded it with such a
  feeling of despair.</p>

  <p>Alone as he was in the little room, he fell on his knees, and heartily and
  humbly thanked God for this answer to his earnest, passionate, reiterated
  prayer; and then he read Kenrick&rsquo;s note again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Paton has begged you off.&rdquo; He repeated this sentence over and
  over again, aloud and to himself, and seemed as if he could never realise it.
  Paton&mdash;Paton, the very man whom he had so deeply and irreparably
  injured&mdash;had begged him off, and shielded him from a punishment which no
  one could have considered too severe for his fault. Young and inexperienced
  as Walter Evson was, he could not, of course, fully understand and appreciate
  the <i>amount</i> of the loss, the nature and degree of the injury which he
  had inflicted; but yet, he <i>could</i> understand that he had done something
  which caused greater pain to his master than even the breaking of a limb, or
  falling ill of a severe sickness. And he never prayed for himself without
  praying also that Mr Paton&rsquo;s misfortune might in some way be
  alleviated; and even, impossible as the prayer might seem, that he, Walter,
  might himself have some share in rendering it more endurable.</p>

  <p>It may seem strange that Walter should be apparently excessive in his own
  self-condemnation. A generous mind usually is; but Walter, it may be urged,
  never intended to do the harm he had done. If he mistook the packet for a
  number of exercises the fault was comparatively venial,
  comparatively&mdash;yes; for though it will be admitted that to break open a
  private desk and throw its contents into the fire is bad enough in a
  schoolboy under any circumstances, still it would be a far less aggravated
  sin than the wilful infliction of a heavy damage out of a spirit of revenge.
  But here lay the gravamen of Walter&rsquo;s fault; he knew&mdash;though he
  had not said so&mdash;in his inmost heart he <i>knew</i> that the packet did
  not, and could not, consist merely of old exercises, like the outer sheets,
  which were put to keep it clean. When he threw it into the fire and thrust it
  down until it blazed away, he felt sure&mdash;and at that wicked moment of
  indulged passion he rejoiced to feel sure&mdash;that what he was consuming
  was of real value. Henderson&rsquo;s voice awoke in a moment his dormant
  conscience; but then, however keen were the stings of remorse, what had been
  done could never be undone. And &ldquo;Paton had begged him off&rdquo;! It
  was all the more wonderful to him, and he was all the more deeply grateful
  for it, because he knew that, in Mr Paton&rsquo;s views, the law of
  punishment for every offence was as a law of iron and adamant&mdash;a law as
  undeviating and beneficial as the law of gravitation itself.</p>

  <p>A slow and hesitating footstep&mdash;the sound of the key turning in the
  door&mdash;a nervous hand resting on the handle&mdash;and Mr Paton stood
  before him.</p>

  <p>In an instant Walter was on his knees beside him, his head bent over his
  clasped hands. &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;please forgive me!
  I have been longing to see you, sir, to implore you to forgive me; for when
  you have forgiven me I shan&rsquo;t mind anything else. Oh, sir, forgive me,
  if you can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know, Evson, the extent of what you have done?&rdquo; said
  Mr Paton, in a constrained voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, indeed I do,&rdquo; he exclaimed, bursting into tears.
  &ldquo;Mr Percival said I had destroyed years and years of hard work, and
  that I can never, never, never make up for it, or repair it again. Oh, sir,
  indeed I didn&rsquo;t know how much mischief I was doing; I was in a wicked
  passion then, but I would give my right-hand not to have done it now. Oh,
  sir, can you ever forgive me?&rdquo; he asked, in a tone of pitiable
  despair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you asked God&rsquo;s forgiveness for your passionate and
  revengeful spirit, Evson?&rdquo; said the same constrained voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, I have, and I know God has forgiven me. Indeed I never
  knew, I never thought before, that I could grow so wicked in a day. Oh, sir,
  what shall I do to gain your forgiveness; I would do anything, sir,&rdquo; he
  said, in a voice thick with sobs; &ldquo;and if you forgave me, I could be
  almost happy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All this while Walter had not dared to look up in Mr Paton&rsquo;s face.
  Abashed as he was, he could not bear to meet the only look which he expected
  to find there, the old cold unpitying look of condemnation and reproach. Even
  at that moment he could not help thinking that if Mr Paton had understood him
  better, he would not have seemed to him so utterly bad as then he must seem,
  with so recent an act of sin and folly to bear witness against him.</p>

  <p>He dared not look up through his eyes swimming with tears; but he had not
  expected the kind and gentle touch of the trembling hand that rested on his
  head as though it blessed him, and that smoothed again and again his dark
  hair, and wiped the big drops away from his cheeks. He had not expected the
  arm that raised him up from his kneeling position, and the fingers that
  pushed back his hair from his forehead, and gently bent back his head; or the
  pitying eyes, themselves dim, as though they were about to well over with
  compassion&mdash;that looked so sorrowfully, yet so kindly, into his own. He
  could not bear this. If Mr Paton had struck him, as he did in the first
  moment of overwhelming anger; if he had spurned him away, and ordered him any
  amount of punishment, it would have been far easier to bear than this
  Christian gentleness; this ready burying in pity and oblivion of the heaviest
  and most undeserved calamity which the master had ever undergone at the hands
  of man. Walter could not bear it; he flung himself on his knees again in a
  passion of weeping, and clasped Mr Paton&rsquo;s knees, uttering in broken
  sentences, &ldquo;I can never make up for it, never repair it as long as I
  live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For a moment more the kind hand again rested on the boy&rsquo;s head, and
  gently smoothed his dark hair; and then Mr Paton found voice to speak, and
  lifting him up, and seating him upon his knee, said to him&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I forgive you, Walter, forgive you freely and gladly. It was hard,
  I own, at first to do so, for I will not disguise from you that this loss is
  a very bitter thing to bear. I have been sleepless, and have never once been
  able to banish the distress of mind which it has caused since it occurred.
  And yet it is a loss which I shall <i>not</i> feel fully all at once, but
  most and for many a long day when I sit down again, if God gives me strength
  to do so, to recover the lost stores and rearrange the interrupted thoughts.
  But I, too, have learnt a lesson, Walter; and when you have reached my age,
  my boy, you too, I trust, will have learnt to control all evil passions with
  a strong will, and to bear meekly and patiently <i>whatever</i> God sends.
  And you too, Walter, learn a lesson. You have said that you would give
  anything, do anything, to undo this wrong, or to repair it; but you can do
  nothing, my child, give nothing, for it cannot be undone. Wrong rarely can be
  mended. Let this very helplessness teach you a truth that may remain with you
  through life. Let it check you in wilful impetuous moments; for what has once
  been done remains irrevocable. You may rue for years and years the work of
  days or of moments, and you may <i>never</i> be able to avoid the
  consequences, even when the deed itself has been forgotten by the generous
  and forgiven by the just.&rdquo; And all this so kindly, so gently, so
  quietly spoken; every word of it sank into Walter&rsquo;s heart never to be
  forgotten, as his tears flowed still but with more quiet sadness now.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter, this occurrence,&rdquo; continued Mr Paton in a calm,
  low voice, &ldquo;may do us both good, miserable as it is. I will say no more
  about it now, only that I have quite forgiven it. Man is far too mean a
  creature to be justified in withholding forgiveness for any personal wrong.
  It is far more hard to forgive one&rsquo;s-self when one has done wrong. I
  have determined to bury the whole matter in oblivion, and to inflict no
  punishment either on you or on any of the other boys who were concerned in
  this folly and sin. I will not forgive by halves. But, Walter, I will not
  wrong you by doubting that from this time forward you will advance with a
  marked improvement. You will have something to bear, no doubt, but do not let
  it weigh on you too heavily; and as for me, I will try henceforth to be your
  friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What could Walter do but seize his hand and clasp it earnestly, and sob
  out the broken incoherent thanks which were more eloquent than connected
  words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now, Walter, you are free,&rdquo; said Mr Paton. &ldquo;From
  <i>us</i> you will hear no more of this offence. It is nearly dinner-time.
  Come; I will walk with you to hall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laid his hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulder, and they walked downstairs
  and across the court. Walter was deeply grateful that he did so, for he had
  heard rumours of the scorn and indignation with which the news of his conduct
  had been received by the elder and more influential portions of the school.
  He had dreaded unspeakably the first occasion when it would be necessary to
  meet them again, but he felt that Mr Paton&rsquo;s countenance and kindness
  had paved the way for him, and smoothed his most formidable trial. It had
  been beyond his warmest hopes that he should be able to face them so. He had
  never dared to expect this open proof, that the person who had suffered
  chiefly from this act would also be the first to show that he had not cast
  him off as helpless or worthless, but was ready to receive him into favour
  once again.</p>

  <p>The corridor was full of boys waiting for the dinner bell, and they
  divided respectfully to leave a passage for Mr Paton, and touched their hats
  as he passed them with his hand still on Walter&rsquo;s shoulder, while
  Walter walked with downcast eyes beside him, not once daring to look up. And
  as the boy passed them, humbled and penitent, with Mr Paton&rsquo;s hand
  resting upon him, there was not one of those who saw it that did not learn
  from that sight a lesson of calm forgiveness as noble and as forcible as any
  lesson which they could learn at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s School.</p>

  <p>Walter sat at dinner pale and crying, but unpitied. &ldquo;Alas for the
  rarity of Christian charity under the sun!&rdquo;&mdash;the worst
  construction had assiduously been put upon what he had done, and nearly all
  the boys hastily condemned it, not only as an ungentlemanly, but also as an
  inexcusable and unpardonable act. One after another, as they passed him after
  dinner, they cut him dead. Several of the masters, including Mr Percival,
  whom Walter had hitherto loved and respected more than any of them, because
  he had been treated by him with marked kindness, did the same. Walter met Mr
  Percival in the playground and touched his cap; Mr Percival glanced at him
  contemptuously for a moment, and then turned his head aside without noticing
  the salute. It may seem strange, but we must remember that to all who hear of
  any wrong act by report only, it presents itself as a mere naked fact&mdash;a
  bare result without preface or palliation. The subtle grades of temptation
  which led to it&mdash;the violent outburst of passion long pent-up which thus
  found its consummation&mdash;are unknown or forgotten, and the deed itself,
  isolated from all that rendered it possible, receives unmitigated
  condemnation. All that anyone took the trouble to know or to believe about
  Walter&rsquo;s scrape was, that he had broken open a master&rsquo;s private
  desk, and in revenge had purposely burnt a most valuable manuscript; and for
  this, sentence was passed upon him broadly and in the gross.</p>

  <p>Poor Walter! those were dark days for him; but Henderson and Kenrick stuck
  fast by him, and little Arthur Eden still looked up to him with unbounded
  gratitude and affection, and he felt that the case was not hopeless. Kenrick,
  indeed, seemed to waver once or twice. He sought Walter and shook hands with
  him at once, but still he was not with him, Walter fancied, so much as he had
  been or might have been, till, after a short struggle, his natural impulse of
  generosity won the day. As for Henderson, Walter thought he could have died
  for him, so much he loved him for his kindness in this hour of need; and Eden
  never left his side when he could creep there to console him by merry
  playfulness, or to be his companion when he would otherwise have been
  alone.</p>

  <p>The boys had been truly sorry to hear of Mr Paton&rsquo;s loss; it roused
  all their most generous feelings. That evening as they came out of chapel
  they all gathered round the iron gates. The intention had been to groan at
  poor Walter. He knew of it perfectly well, for Henderson had prepared him for
  it, and expressed his determination to walk by his side. It was for him a
  moment of keen anguish, and that anguish betrayed itself in his scared and
  agitated look. But he was spared this last drop in the cup of punishment. The
  mere sight of him showed the boys that he had suffered bitterly enough
  already. When they looked at him they had not the heart to hurt and shame him
  any more. Mr Paton&rsquo;s open forgiveness of that which had fallen most
  severely on himself changed the current of their feelings. Instead of
  groaning Walter they let him pass by, and waited till Mr Paton came out of
  the chapel door, and as he walked across the court the boys all followed him
  with hearty cheers.</p>

  <p>Mr Paton did not like the demonstration, although he appreciated the
  kindly and honourable motives which had given rise to it. He was not a man
  who courted popularity, and this external sign of it was, as he well knew,
  the irregular expression of an evanescent feeling. So he took no further
  notice of the boys&rsquo; cheers than by slightly raising his cap, and by one
  stately inclination of the head, and then he walked on with his usual quiet
  dignity of manner to his own rooms. But after this he every now and then took
  an opportunity to walk with Walter; and almost every Sunday evening he might
  have been seen with him pacing, after morning chapel, up and down the broad
  walk of the masters&rsquo; garden, while Walter walked unevenly beside him,
  in vain endeavours to keep step with his long slow stride.</p>

  <p>A letter from Dr Lane brought Walter&rsquo;s father to Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s the next day. Why dwell on their sad and painful meeting?
  But the pain of it soon wore off as they interchanged that sweet and frank
  communion of thoughts and sympathies that still existed as it had ever done
  between them. They had a long, long walk upon the shore, and at every step
  Walter seemed to in-breathe fresh strength, and hope, and consolation, and Mr
  Evson seemed to acquire new love for, and confidence in, his unhappy little
  son, so that when in the evening he kissed him and said
  &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; at the top of the same hill where they had parted
  before, Mr Evson felt more happily and gratefully secure of his radical
  integrity, now that the boy had acquired the strength which comes through
  trial, through failure, and through suffering, than he had done before when
  he had left him only with the strength of early principle and untested
  innocence of heart.</p>

  <p>But long years after, when Walter was a man, and when he had been
  separated for years from all intelligence of Mr Paton, there emanated from a
  quiet country vicarage a now celebrated edition of the &ldquo;Major
  Prophets,&rdquo; an edition which made the author a high reputation, and
  secured for him in the following year the Deanery of &mdash;. And in the
  preface to that edition the reader may still find the following passage,
  which, as Walter saw even then, those long years after, he could not read
  without a thrill of happy, yet penitent emotion. It ran thus&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote style="text-align:justify">
    &ldquo;This edition of the &lsquo;Major Prophets&rsquo; has been the chosen
    work of the author&rsquo;s leisure, and he is almost afraid to say how many
    of the best years of his life have been spent upon it. A strange fortune
    has happened to it. Years ago it was finished, and it was written out, and
    ready for the press. At that time it was burnt&mdash;no matter under what
    circumstances&mdash;by a boy&rsquo;s hand. At first, the author never hoped
    to have the courage or power to resume and finish the task again. But it
    pleased God, Who sent him this trial, to provide him also with leisure, and
    opportunity, and resolution, so that the old misfortune is now at last
    repaired. It is for the sake of one person, and one person only, that these
    private matters are intruded on the reader&rsquo;s notice; but that person,
    if his eye should ever fall on these lines, will know also why the word
    &lsquo;repaired&rsquo; has been printed in larger letters. And I would also
    tell him with all kindness, that it has pleased God to bring out of the
    rash act of his boyhood nothing but good. The following commentary is, I
    humbly trust, far more worthy of its high subject, now that it has received
    the maturer consideration of my advancing years, than it would have been
    had it seen the light at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s long ago. I write this for
    the sake of the boy who then wept for what seemed an <i>irreparable</i>
    fault; and I add thankfully, that never for a moment have I retracted my
    then forgiveness; that I think of his after efforts with kindliness and
    affection; and that he has, and always will have, my best prayers for his
    interest and welfare. &mdash;H. Paton.&rdquo;

  <h2>X. &mdash; UPHILLWARDS</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;But that Conscience makes me firm.<br>
    The boon companion, who her strong breastplate<br>
    Buckles on him that feels no guilt within,<br>
    And bids him on and fear not.&rdquo;</i><br>
    &mdash;Dante, c. xxviii.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;QUI s&rsquo;excuse s&rsquo;accuse.&rdquo; &ldquo;If a
  character can&rsquo;t defend itself, it&rsquo;s not worth defending.&rdquo;
  &ldquo;No one was ever written down, except by himself.&rdquo; These, and
  proverbs like these, express the common and almost instinctive feeling, that
  self-defence under calumny is generally unsuccessful, and almost always
  involves a loss of dignity. Partly from this cause, and partly from penitence
  for his real errors, and partly from scorn at the malice that misrepresented
  him, and the Pharisaism of far worse offenders that held aloof from his
  misfortune, Walter said nothing to exculpate his conduct, or to shield
  himself from the silent indignation, half real and half affected, which
  weighed heavily against him.</p>

  <p>The usual consequences followed; the story of his misdoing was repeated
  and believed in the least mitigated form, and this version gained credence
  and currency because it was uncontradicted. The school society bound his sin
  upon him; they retained it, and it was retained. It burdened his conscience
  with a galling weight, because by his fellows it remained long unforgiven. At
  the best, those were days of fiery trial to that overcharged young heart. He
  had not only lost all immediate influence, but as he looked forward through
  the vista of his school-life, he feared that he should never entirely regain
  it. Even if he should in time become a monitor, he felt as if half his
  authority must be lost while this stigma was branded so deeply on his
  name.</p>

  <p>Yet it was a beautiful sight to see how bravely and manfully this young
  boy set himself to re-establish the reputation he had destroyed, and since he
  could not &ldquo;build upon the <i>foundations</i> of yesterday,&rdquo; to
  build upon its <i>ruins</i>; to see with what touching humility he accepted
  undeserved scorn, and with what touching gratitude he hailed the scantiest
  kindness; to see how he bore up unflinchingly under every difficulty,
  accepted his hard position among unsympathising schoolfellows, and made the
  most of it, without anger and without complaint. He could see in after years
  that those days were to him a time of unmitigated blessing. They taught him
  lessons of manliness, of endurance, of humility. The necessity of repairing
  an error and recovering a failure became to him a more powerful stimulus than
  the hope of avoiding it altogether. The hour of punishment, which was bitter
  as absinthe to his taste, became sweet as honey in his memory. Above all,
  these days taught him, in a manner never to be forgotten, the invaluable
  lesson that the sense of having done an ill deed is the very heaviest
  calamity that an ill deed ensures, and that in life there is no single secret
  of happiness comparable to the certain blessing brought with it by a
  conscience void of all offence.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the strain would have been too great for his youthful spirits, and
  might have left on his character an impress of permanent melancholy, derived
  from thus perpetually being reminded that he had gone wrong, but for a school
  sermon which Mr Paton preached about this time, and which Walter felt was
  meant in part for him. It was on the danger and unwisdom of brooding
  continually on what is over; and it was preached upon the text, &ldquo;I will
  restore to you the years which the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, the
  caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The past is past,&rdquo; said the preacher; &ldquo;its sins and
  sorrows are irrevocably over; why dwell upon it now? Do not waste the
  present, with all its opportunities, in a hopeless and helpless retrospect.
  The worst of us need not despair, much less those who may have been betrayed
  into sudden error by some moment of unguarded passion. There lies the future
  before you; onwards then, and forwards! it is yet an innocent, it may be a
  happy, future. Take it with prayerful thankfulness, and fling the withered
  part aside. Thus, although thus only, can you recover your neglected
  opportunities. Do this in hope and meekness, and God will make up to you for
  the lost past; He Who inhabiteth eternity will stretch forth out of His
  eternity a forgiving hand, and touch into green leaf again the years which
  the locust hath eaten.&rdquo; How eagerly Walter Evson drank in those words!
  That day at least he felt that man doth not live by bread alone, but by every
  word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>

  <p>If Walter had been old enough to be an observer of character, he might
  have gathered out of his difficulties the materials for some curious
  observation on the manner in which he was treated by different boys. Many,
  like Harpour and Cradock, made, of course, no sort of difference in their
  behaviour towards him, because they set up no pretence of condemnation;
  others, like Anthony and Franklin, had been nearly as bad as himself in the
  matter, and therefore their relations to him remained quite unaltered. But
  there were many boys who, like Jones, either cut him or were cold to him, not
  because they really felt any moral anger at a fault which was much less
  heinous in reality than many which they daily committed, but because he was,
  for the time, unpopular, and they did not care to be seen with an unpopular
  boy. On the other hand, through a feeling, which at the time they could not
  understand, a few of the very best boys, some of the wisest, the steadiest,
  the noblest, seemed drawn to him by some new tie; and in a very short time he
  began to know friends among them in whose way he might not otherwise have
  been thrown. Daubeny, for instance, than whom, although the boys chose to
  make him something of a butt, there was no more conscientious fellow at Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s, sought Walter out on every possible occasion, and when they
  were alone spoke to him, in his gentle and honest way, many a cheering and
  kindly word. Another friend of this sort (whom Walter already knew slightly
  through Kenrick, who was in the form below him), was a boy named Power. There
  was something in Power most attractive: his clear eyes, and innocent
  expression of face, his unvarying success in all school competitions, his
  quiet and graceful manners, and even the coldness and reserve which made him
  stand somewhat aloof from the herd of boys, mixing with very few of them,
  firmly and unobtrusively assuming an altogether higher tone than theirs, and
  bestowing his confidence and friendship on hardly any&mdash;all tended to
  make him a marked character, and to confer on his intimacy an unusual value.
  Walter, to whom as yet he had hardly spoken, thought him self-centred and
  reserved, and yet saw something beautiful and fascinating even in his
  exclusiveness; he felt that he could have liked him much, but, as he was
  several forms lower than Power, never expected to become one of his few
  associates. But during his troubles Power so openly showed that he regarded
  him with respect and kindness, and was so clearly the first to make advances,
  that Walter gladly and gratefully accepted the proffered friendship.</p>

  <p>It happened thus: One day, about a fortnight after his last escapade,
  Walter was amusing himself alone, as he often did, upon the shore. The shore
  was very dear to him. I almost pity a boy whose school is not by the seaside.
  He found on the shore both companionship and occupation. He never felt lonely
  there. He could sit there by the hour, either in calm or storm, watching the
  sea-birds dip their wings which flashed in the sunlight, as they pounced down
  on some unwary fish; or listening to the silken rustle and sweet monotony of
  the waves plashing musically upon the yellow sands on some fine day. On this
  evening the tide was coming in, and Walter had amused himself by standing on
  some of the lumps of granite tossed about the shore until the advancing waves
  encroached upon and surrounded his little island, and gave him just room to
  jump to land. He was standing on one of these great stones watching the
  sunset, and laughing to himself at the odd gambols of two or three porpoises
  that kept rolling about in a futile manner across the little bay, when he
  heard a pleasant voice say to him&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Evson, are you going to practise the old style of
  martyrdom&mdash;tie yourself to a stake and let the tide gradually drown
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Looking round he was surprised to see Power standing alone on the sands,
  and to see also that his little island was so far surrounded that he could
  not get to shore without being wet up to the knees.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I see I must take off my shoes and
  stockings, and wade.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But on the slippery piece of rock upon which he was standing he had no
  room to do this without losing his balance and tumbling over; so Power had in
  a moment taken off his own shoes and stockings, turned up his trousers above
  the knees, and waded up to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get on my back, and I&rsquo;ll carry
  you in unwetted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Power,&rdquo; he said, as Power deposited him on the sand;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not knowing whether Power would like to be seen with him <img src=
  "1306691h-images/wnfrd078.jpg"
       alt=""> or not, he looked at him shyly, and was walking off in another
       direction, when Power, who was putting on his stockings again, said to
       him playfully&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, Walter; haven&rsquo;t you the grace to wait for me, after my
  having delivered you from such a noyade? Excuse my calling you Walter; I hear
  Kenrick and Henderson do it, and somehow you&rsquo;re one of those fellows
  whom one meets now and then, whose Christian name seems to suit them more
  naturally than the other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means call me Walter, Power; and I&rsquo;ll wait for you
  gladly if you like,&rdquo; said Walter, blushing as he added, &ldquo;I
  thought you might not like to walk with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not like? Nonsense. I should like it particularly. Let&rsquo;s take
  a turn along the shore; we shall just have time before roll-call.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter pointed out to him the droll porpoises which had absorbed his
  attention, and while they stood looking and laughing at them, Henderson came
  up unobserved, and patting Walter on the back, observed poetically&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Why are your young hearts sad, oh beautiful children of
    morning?<br>
    Why do your young eyes gaze timidly over the sea?&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Where <i>did</i> you crib that quotation from, Flip,&rdquo; asked
  Power laughing; &ldquo;your mind&rsquo;s like a shallow brook, and the colour
  of it always shows the stratum through which you have been flowing
  last.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shallow brook, quotha?&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;a deep and
  mighty river, sir, you mean; irresistible by any Power.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i> shut up. Why was I born with a name that could be
  punned on? No more puns, Flip, if you love me,&rdquo; said Power; and they
  all three walked under the noble Norman archway that formed the entrance to
  the school.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By the powers,&rdquo; said Henderson to Walter, as the other left
  them, &ldquo;you <i>have</i> got a new friend worth having, Walter. <i>He</i>
  doesn&rsquo;t make himself at home with every one, I can tell you; and if he
  and Dubbs cultivate you, I should think it&rsquo;s about time for anyone else
  to be ashamed of cutting you, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite happy now,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;with you and
  Kenrick and him for friends. I don&rsquo;t care so much for the rest. I
  wonder why he likes me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, because he thinks the fellows a great deal too hard on you
  for one thing. How very good and patient you&rsquo;ve been, Walter, under it
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is hard sometimes, Flip, but I deserve it. Only now and then
  I&rsquo;m afraid that you and Ken will get quite tired of me, I&rsquo;ve so
  few to speak to. Harpour and that lot would be glad enough that I should join
  them, I know, and but for you and Ken I should have been driven to do
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Walter, my boy; the fellows&rsquo;ll come round in
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So, step by step, with the countenance of some true and worthy friends,
  and by the help of a stout and uncorrupted heart, by penitence and by
  kindliness, did our brave little Walter win his way. He was helped, too,
  greatly, by his achievements in the games. At football he played with a
  vigour and earnestness which carried everything before it. He got several
  bases, and was the youngest boy in the school who ever succeeded in doing
  this. Gradually but surely his temporary unpopularity gave way; and even
  before he began to be generally recognised again, he bade fair
  <i>ultimately</i> to gain a high position in the estimation of all his
  schoolfellows.</p>

  <p>There was one scene which he long remembered, and which was very trying to
  go through. One fine afternoon the boys&rsquo; prize for the highest jump was
  to be awarded, and as the school were all greatly interested in the
  competition, they were assembled in a dense circle in the green playground,
  leaving space for the jumpers in the middle. The fine weather had also
  tempted nearly all the inhabitants of Saint Winifred&rsquo;s to be spectators
  of the contest, and numbers of ladies were present, for whom the boys had
  politely left a space within the circle. When the chief jumping prize had
  been won by an active fellow in the sixth-form, another prize was proposed
  for all boys under fifteen.</p>

  <p>Bliss, Franklin, and two other boys at once stepped into the circle as
  competitors, and threw off their jackets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must go in for this, Walter,&rdquo; said Henderson.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure to get it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not I. I won&rsquo;t go in, Flip,&rdquo; said Walter, who was
  naturally in a desponding mood, as he looked round on those four hundred
  faces, and saw among them all scarcely one sympathising glance.
  &ldquo;<i>You</i> go in and win. And never mind talking to me up here,
  Henderson; it can&rsquo;t be pleasant for you, I know, when all the other
  fellows are cutting me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh! Walter. <i>They&rsquo;re</i> in the wrong box; not you and I.
  &lsquo;Athanasius contra mundum,&rsquo; as Power says. Do go in for the
  prize.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter shook his head gloomily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to, before all
  these fellows. They&rsquo;d hiss me or something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, if <i>you</i> won&rsquo;t, <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t; that&rsquo;s
  flat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O do, Henderson. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d get it. Don&rsquo;t ask
  me to go in, that&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None but these four going in for the little jump? What, only
  four?&rdquo; said one of the young athletes, who carried little blue flags,
  and arranged the preliminaries. &ldquo;Come in some more of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here are two more,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;stick down our
  names&mdash;Henderson and Evson&rdquo;; and pulling Walter forward with him
  inside the circle, he sat down and began to take off his shoes, that he might
  run and jump more easily on the turf.</p>

  <p>Thus prominently mentioned, Walter could hardly draw back, so putting the
  best face on it he could, he, too, flung off his jacket and shoes.</p>

  <p>The movable spar of wood over which the boys jumped was first put at a
  height of three feet, which they could all easily manage, and the six, one
  after another, cleared it lightly. Even then, however, it was pretty easy to
  judge by their action which was the best jumper, and the connoisseurs on the
  field at once decided that the chance lay between Henderson and Walter;
  Walter was by far the most active and graceful jumper, but Henderson had the
  advantage of being a little the taller of the two.</p>

  <p>The spar was raised half an inch each time, and when it had attained the
  height of three feet and a half, two of the candidates failed to clear it
  after three trials.</p>

  <p>Bliss was the next to break down. His awkward jumps had excited a great
  deal of laughter, and when he finally failed, Henderson found time even then
  to begin a line or two of his monody on Blissidas, which was a standing joke
  against poor Bliss, who always met it by the same invariable observation of
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lick you afterwards, Flip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Only three competitors were now left&mdash;Franklin, Henderson, and
  Walter&mdash;and they jumped on steadily till they had reached the height of
  four feet and one inch, and then Franklin broke down, but recovered himself
  in the second chance.</p>

  <p>The struggle now became very exciting, and as Franklin and Henderson again
  cleared the bar at the height of four feet four, each of them were loudly
  clapped. But Walter&mdash;who jumped last always, because he had been the
  last candidate to come forward&mdash;although he cleared it with an easy
  bound, received no sign of encouragement from any of the boys. He cleared it
  in perfect silence, only broken by Mr Paton, who was looking on with a group
  of other masters, and who said encouragingly, &ldquo;Very well done, Evson;
  capital!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The bar was raised an inch, and again the three boys cleared it, and again
  the first two were greeted with applause, and Walter was left unnoticed
  except by Power and Kenrick, who applauded him heartily, and patted him on
  the back. But indeed their clapping only served to throw into stronger relief
  the loud applause which the others received. Walter almost wished that they
  would desist. He was greatly agitated; and his friends saw that he was
  trembling with emotion. He had been much mortified the first time to be thus
  pointedly scorned in so large a crowd of strangers, and made a marked object
  of reprobation before them all; but that this open shame should be thus
  <i>steadily</i> and <i>continuously</i> put upon him, made his heart swell
  with sorrow and indignation at the ungenerous and unforgiving spirit of his
  schoolfellows.</p>

  <p>Once more the bar was raised an inch. The other two got over it amid a
  burst of applause, and this time Walter, who was unnerved by the painful
  circumstances in which he found himself, brushed against it as he came over,
  and knocked it off. The bar was replaced, and at his second trial (for three
  were allowed) he jumped so well that he flew easily over it. Always before, a
  boy who had recovered himself after a failure had been saluted with double
  cheering, but again Walter&rsquo;s proceedings were observed by that large
  crowd in dead silence, while he could not help overhearing the whispered
  queries which asked an explanation of so unusual a circumstance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they cheer him as well as the others?&rdquo; asked
  a fair young girl of her brother. &ldquo;He looks such a nice boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because he did a very shabby thing not long ago,&rdquo; was the
  reply.</p>

  <p>He could stand it no longer. He glanced round at the speakers more in
  sorrow than in anger, and then, instead of returning to the starting-point,
  he turned hastily aside, and, declining the contest, plunged into the
  thickest of the crowd. &ldquo;Evson&rsquo;s giving it up. What a pity!&rdquo;
  said several boys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No wonder he&rsquo;s giving it up,&rdquo; said Power indignantly,
  &ldquo;after the way you fellows treat him. Never mind them, Walter,&rdquo;
  he said, taking him by the arm; &ldquo;they will be ashamed of themselves by
  and by.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to withdraw, Evson?&rdquo; asked one of the
  chief athletes, in a kind tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Walter, retiring still farther to hide himself
  amid the crowd.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Henderson, who had heard the answer;
  &ldquo;come, Walter, it&rsquo;ll spoil all the fun if you don&rsquo;t go
  on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Flip,&rdquo; said Walter, turning aside, and hastily
  brushing away the tears which <i>would</i> come into his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do, Walter, they all wish it,&rdquo; whispered Henderson; &ldquo;be
  brave, and get the prize in spite of all; here&rsquo;s Paton coming round;
  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s to cheer you up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Flip, I will, if it pleases you; but it&rsquo;s rather
  hard,&rdquo; he said, fairly bursting into tears. &ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s
  only for your sake I do it, Flip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Walter; don&rsquo;t give way,&rdquo; said Mr Paton aloud, in
  his gentlest and most encouraging voice, as the boy hastily re-entered the
  arena, and took his place.</p>

  <p>This time Franklin finally broke down, Henderson barely scrambled over,
  and Walter, nerved by excitement and indignation, cleared the bar by a
  brilliant flying leap. There was no mistake about the applause this time. The
  boys had seen how their coolness had told on him. They were touched by the
  pluck he showed in spite of his dejected look, and as though to make up for
  their former deficiency, they clapped him as loud as either of the
  others.</p>

  <p>And now a spirited contest began between Henderson and Walter. Four feet
  six and a half they both accomplished&mdash;Walter the first time, and
  Henderson the third. When Henderson, at his last trial, barely succeeded, a
  loud shout rose from the field, quite enthusiastic enough to show that the
  wishes of the school were on his side. This decided Walter, for he too was
  anxious that Henderson, who had set his heart upon the prize, and was now
  quite eager with emulation, should be the successful competitor. At four feet
  seven, therefore, he meant to break down, but, at the same time, to clear the
  bar so nearly each time of trial, that it might not be <i>obvious</i> to any
  one that he was not putting forth his best strength. The first time, however,
  he jumped so carelessly that Henderson suspected his purpose, and, therefore,
  the second time he exerted himself a little more, and, to his own
  astonishment, accomplished the leap without having intended to do so.
  Henderson also just succeeded in managing it, and as Walter refused to try
  another half inch, the prize was declared, amid loud cheers, to be equally
  divided between them, after the best competition that ever had been
  known.</p>

  <p>The boys and the spectators now moved off to the pavilion, where the
  prizes were to be distributed by Mrs Lane. But when Walter&rsquo;s name was
  called out with Henderson&rsquo;s, only the latter stepped forward. Walter
  had disappeared; and the boys were again made to feel, by his voluntary
  absence, what bitterness of heart their unkind conduct caused him.</p>

  <p>Henderson took the prize for his friend, when he received his own. The
  prizes were a silver-mounted riding-whip, and a belt with a silver clasp, and
  Mrs Lane told Henderson that she was sorry for the other victor&rsquo;s
  absence, and that either of them might choose whichever prize he liked best.
  When the crowd had dispersed Henderson, knowing Walter&rsquo;s haunts,
  strolled with Kenrick to a little fir-grove on the slope of Bardlyn Hill, not
  far above the sea. Here, as they expected, they found Walter. He was sitting
  in a listless attitude, with his back towards them, and he started as he
  heard their footsteps.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;You let yourself be beaten, Evson Walter,<br>
    And afterwards you proved a base defaulter,&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>said Henderson, who was in high spirits, as he clapped his hands on
  Walter&rsquo;s shoulders, and continued&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Behold I bring you now the silver prizes,<br>
    Meant to reward your feets and exercises.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Even Walter could not help smiling at this sally, but he said at once,
  &ldquo;You must keep both prizes, Flip; I don&rsquo;t mean to take
  either&mdash;indeed I won&rsquo;t; I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone in at all but
  for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, do take one,&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;the fellows will think
  you too proud if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they think of me, Ken; you saw how they
  treated me. Flip, I&rsquo;d take the prize in a minute to please you, but,
  indeed, it would only remind me constantly of this odious jumping, and
  I&rsquo;d much rather not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take <i>both</i> prizes, Walter,&rdquo; said
  Henderson.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what&mdash;give one to Franklin; he
  jumped very well, and he&rsquo;s not half a bad fellow. Don&rsquo;t press me,
  Flip; I can&rsquo;t refuse you anything if you do, because you&rsquo;ve been
  so very, very kind; but you don&rsquo;t know how wretched I feel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Henderson, who had looked annoyed, cleared up in a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Walter; it shall be as you like. Franklin shall have it.
  You&rsquo;ve had quite enough to bear already. So cheer up, and come
  along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was soon known in the school how Walter had yielded the prize to
  Franklin, and it was known, too, that next day he had gone to jump with
  Henderson, Franklin, and some others, and had cleared the bar at four feet
  eight, which none of them had been able to do. The boys admired his conduct
  throughout; and from that day forward many were as anxious to renew an
  acquaintance with him as they had previously been to break it off.</p>

  <p>And there was an early opportunity of testing this; for a few days after
  the scene just described the champion race for boys under fifteen was tried
  for, and when Walter won it by accomplishing the distance in the shortest
  time that had yet been known, and by distancing the other runners, he was
  received with a cheer, which was all the more hearty because the boys were
  anxious to do him a tardy justice. If Walter had not been too noble to be
  merely patronised, and too reserved to be &ldquo;hail-fellow-well-met&rdquo;
  with every one, he would have fallen more easily and speedily into the
  position which he now slowly but honourably recovered.</p>

  <p>It need hardly be said that, in his school work, Walter struggled with all
  his might to give satisfaction to Mr Paton, and to spare him from all pain.
  There was something really admirable in the way he worked, and taxed himself
  even beyond his strength, to prove his regret for Mr Paton&rsquo;s loss, by
  doing all that was required of him. Naturally quick and lively as he was, he
  sat as quiet and attentive in school, as if he had been gifted with a
  disposition as unmercurial as that of Daubeny himself. In order to make sure
  of his lessons, he went over them with Henderson (who entered eagerly into
  his wishes) with such care, that they, both of them, astonished themselves
  with their own improving progress. If they came to any insuperable
  difficulties, Kenrick or Power gladly helped them, and explained everything
  to them with that sympathetic clearness of instruction which makes one boy
  the best teacher to another. The main difficulty still continued to be the
  repetition, and grammar rules; but in order to know them, at least by rote,
  Walter would get up with the earliest gleam of daylight, and would put on his
  trousers and waistcoat after bed-time, and go and sit, book in hand, under
  the gaslight in the passage. This was hard work, doubtless; but it brought
  its own reward in successful endeavour and an approving conscience. Under
  this discipline his memory rapidly grew retentive; no difficulty can stand
  the assaults of such batteries as these, and Walter was soon free from all
  punishments, and as happy as the day was long.</p>

  <p>One little cloud alone remained&mdash;the continued and obvious
  displeasure of his tutor, and one or two of Mr Paton&rsquo;s chief friends
  among the masters. One of these was Mr Edwards, who, among other duties, had
  the management of the chapel choir. But at length Mr Edwards gave him a
  distinguished proof of his returning respect. He sat near Walter in chapel,
  and the hymn happened to be one which came closely home to Walter&rsquo;s
  heart after his recent troubles. This made him join with great feeling in the
  singing, and the choirmaster was struck with the strength and rare sweetness
  of his voice. As he left the chapel, Mr Edwards said to him, &ldquo;Evson,
  there is a vacancy for a treble in the choir; I heard you sing in chapel
  to-day, and I think that you would supply the place very well. Should you
  like to join?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter very gladly accepted the offer, partly because he hailed the
  opportunity of learning a little about music, and because the choir boys were
  allowed several highly-valued and exceptional privileges; but chiefly because
  they were always chosen by the masters with express reference to character,
  and therefore the invitation to join their number was the clearest proof that
  could be given him that the past was condoned.</p>

  <p>The last to offer him the right-hand of forgiveness, but the best and
  warmest friend to him when once he had done so, was Mr Percival. He still
  passed him with only the coldest and most distant recognition, for he not
  only felt Mr Paton&rsquo;s loss with peculiar sorrow, but was also vexed and
  disappointed that a boy whose character he had openly defended should have
  proved so unworthy of his encomium. It happened that the <i>only</i> time
  that Walter was ever again sent to detention was for a failure in a long
  lesson, including much which had been learnt on the morning that he was out
  of school, which, in consequence, he found it impossible, with all his
  efforts, to master. Mr Paton saw how mortified and pained he was to fail, and
  when he sent him to detention, most kindly called him up, and told him that
  he saw the cause of his unsuccess, and was not <i>in the least</i> displeased
  at it, although, as he had similarly punished other boys, he could not make
  any exception to the usual rule of punishment. On this occasion, it was again
  Mr Percival&rsquo;s turn to sit with the <i>detenus</i>, and seeing Walter
  among them, he too hastily concluded that he was still continuing a career of
  disgrace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! you here again?&rdquo; he said with chilling scorn, as he
  passed the seat where Walter sat writing. &ldquo;After what has happened, I
  should have been ashamed to be sent here, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After his days and nights of toil, after his long, manly, noble struggle
  to show his penitence, after his heavy and disproportionate punishment, it
  was hard to be so addressed by one whom he respected, in the presence of all
  the idlest in the school, and in consequence of a purely accidental and
  isolated failure. Walter looked up with an appealing look in his dark blue
  eyes; but Mr Percival had passed on, and he bent his head over his paper with
  the old sense that the past could <i>never</i> be forgotten, the recollection
  of his disgrace <i>never</i> obliterated. No one was observing him; and as
  the feeling of despair grew in him, a large tear dropped down upon his paper;
  he wiped it quietly away, and continued writing, but another and another
  fell, and he could not help it. For Mr Percival was almost the only master
  whose goodwill he very strongly coveted, and whose approval he was most
  anxious to attain.</p>

  <p>When next Mr Percival stopped and looked at Walter, he saw that his words
  had wounded him to the heart, and knew well why the boy&rsquo;s lines were
  blurred and blotted, when he showed them up with a timid hand and downcast
  look.</p>

  <p>He was touched. &ldquo;I have been too hard on you, Evson,&rdquo; he said;
  &ldquo;I see it now. Come to tea with me after chapel this evening; I want to
  speak with you.&rdquo;</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">WHEN chapel was over, Walter, having brushed his hair, and
  made himself rather neater and more spruce than a schoolboy usually is at the
  middle of a long half, went to Mr Percival&rsquo;s room. Mr Percival, having
  been detained, had not yet come in; but Henderson, Kenrick, and Power, who
  had also been asked to tea, were there waiting for him when Walter arrived,
  and Henderson, as usual, amusing the others and himself with a flood of
  mimicry and nonsense.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know that mischievous little Penkridge,&rdquo; said Kenrick;
  &ldquo;he nearly had an accident this morning. We were in the classroom, and
  Edwards was complaining of the bad smell of the room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad smell!&rdquo; interrupted Henderson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you
  what you like Edwards didn&rsquo;t say bad smell. <i>He&rsquo;s</i> not the
  man to call a spade a spade; he calls it an agricultural implement for the
  trituration of the soil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what <i>should</i> he say?&rdquo; asked Kenrick, &ldquo;if he
  didn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;bad smell&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, &lsquo;What a malodorous effluvium!&rsquo;&rdquo; said
  Henderson, imitating exactly the master&rsquo;s somewhat drawling tone;
  &ldquo;&lsquo;what a con-cen-trra-ted malarious miasma; what an
  unendurable&rsquo;&mdash;I say Power, give us the Greek, or Hebrew, or
  Kamschatkan, for &lsquo;smell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Odwde,&rdquo; suggested Power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it to a T,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;I bet you he
  observed, &lsquo;What an un-en-duu-rrable osus.&rsquo; Now, didn&rsquo;t he?
  Confess the truth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I believe he did say something of the kind,&rdquo; said
  Kenrick, laughing; &ldquo;at least I know he called it Stygian and Tartarean.
  But, as I was saying, he set Penkridge (who happened to be going round with
  the lists) to examine the cupboards, and see if by chance some inopportune
  rat had died there; and Penkridge, opening one of them where the floor was
  very rotten, and poking about with his foot, knocked a great piece of plaster
  off the great schoolroom ceiling, and was as nearly as possible putting his
  foot through it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fancy if he had,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;how astonished we
  should have been down below. I say, Henderson, what <i>would</i> Paton have
  said?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Paton,&rdquo; said Henderson, delighted with any opportunity
  for mimicry, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d have whispered quietly, in an emotionless
  voice, &lsquo;Penkridge, Penkridge, come here&mdash;come here, Penkridge.
  This is a very unusual method, Penkridge, of entering a room&mdash;highly
  irregular. If you haven&rsquo;t broken your leg or your arm, Penkridge, you
  must write me two hundred lines.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Robertson?&rdquo; asked Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Robertson&mdash;he&rsquo;d have put up his eye-glass,&rdquo;
  said Henderson, again exactly hitting off the master&rsquo;s attitude,
  &ldquo;and he&rsquo;d have observed, &lsquo;Ah! Penkridge has fallen through
  the floor; probably fractured some bones. Slippery fellow, he won&rsquo;t be
  able to go to the Fighting Cocks <i>this</i> afternoon, at any rate.&rsquo;
  Whereupon Stevens would have gone up to him with the utmost tenderness, and
  asked him if he was hurt; and Penkridge, getting up, would, by way of
  gratitude, have grinned in his face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better finish the scene,&rdquo; said Power;
  &ldquo;what would Percival have said?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thunder-and-lightning? Oh! that&rsquo;s easy to decide; he&rsquo;d
  have made two or three quotations; he&rsquo;d have immediately called the
  attention of the form to the fact that Penkridge had been:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Flung by angry Jove<br>
    Sheer o&rsquo;er the crystal battlements; from morn<br>
    Till noon he fell, from noon till dewy eve;<br>
    A winter&rsquo;s day, and as the tea-bell rang,<br>
    Shot from the ceiling like a falling star<br>
    On the great schoolroom floor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Would he, indeed?&rdquo; said Mr Percival, pinching
  Henderson&rsquo;s ear, as he came in just in time to join in the laugh which
  this parody occasioned.</p>

  <p>Tea at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s is a regular and recognised institution.
  There are few nights on which some of the boys do not adjourn after chapel to
  tea at the masters&rsquo; houses, when they have the privilege of sitting up
  an hour and a half later. The masters generally adopt this method of seeing
  their pupils and the boys in whom they are interested. The institution works
  admirably; the first and immediate result of it is, that here boys and
  masters are more intimately acquainted, and being so, are on warmer and
  friendlier terms with each other than perhaps at any other
  school&mdash;certainly on warmer terms than if they never met except in the
  still and punishment-pervaded atmosphere of the schoolrooms; and the second
  and remoter result is, that not only in the matter of work already alluded
  to, but also in other and equally important particulars, the tone and
  character of Saint Winifred&rsquo;s boys is higher and purer than it would
  otherwise be. There is a simplicity and manliness there which cannot fail to
  bring forth its rich fruits of diligence, truthfulness, and honour. Many are
  the boys who have come from thence, who, in the sweet yet sober dignity of
  their life and demeanour, go far to realise the beautiful ideal of Christian
  boyhood. Many are the boys there who are walking, through the gates of
  humility and diligence, to certain, and merited, and conspicuous honour.</p>

  <p>I know that there are many who believe in none of these things, and care
  not for them; who repudiate the necessity and duty of early godliness; who
  set up no ideal at all, because to do so would expose them to the charge of
  sentiment or enthusiasm, a charge which they dread more than that of villainy
  itself. These men regard the heart as a muscle consisting of four cavities,
  called respectively the auricles and the ventricles, and useful for no other
  purpose but to aerate the blood; all other meanings of the word they despise
  or ignore. They regard the world not as a scene of probation, not as a
  passage to a newer and higher life, but as a &ldquo;convenient
  feeding-trough&rdquo; for every low passion and unworthy impulse; as a place
  where they can build on the foundation of universal scepticism a reputation
  for superior ability. This degradation of spirit, this premature cynicism,
  this angry sneering at a tone superior to their own, this addiction to a low
  and lying satire, which is the misbegotten child of envy and disbelief, has
  infected our literature to a deplorable and almost hopeless extent. It might
  be sufficient to leave it, in all its rottenness and inflation, to every good
  man&rsquo;s silent scorn, if it had not also so largely tainted the intellect
  of the young. If, in popular papers or magazines, boys are to read that, in a
  boy, lying is natural and venial; that courtesy to, and love for, a master,
  is impossible or hypocritical; that swearing and corrupt communication are
  peccadilloes which none but preachers and pedagogues regard as
  discreditable&mdash;how can we expect success to the labours of those who
  toil all their lives, amid neglect and ingratitude, to elevate the boys of
  England to a higher and holier view? I have seen this taint of <i>atheistic
  disregard for sin</i> poison article after article, and infuse its bitter
  principle into many a young man&rsquo;s heart; and worse than
  this&mdash;adopted as it is by writers whom some consider to be mighty in
  intellect and leaders of opinion, I have seen it corrode the consciences and
  degrade the philosophy of far better and far worthier men.</p>

  <p>It is a solemn duty to protest, with all the force of heart and
  conscience, against this dangerous gospel of sin, this &ldquo;giving to
  manhood&rsquo;s vices the privilege of boyhood.&rdquo; It was <i>not</i> the
  gospel taught at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s; there we were taught that we were
  baptised Christian boys, that the seal of God&rsquo;s covenant was on our
  foreheads, that the oath of His service was on our consciences, that we were
  His children, and the members of His Son, and the inheritors of His kingdom;
  that His laws were our safeguard, and that our bodies were the temples of His
  Spirit. We were not taught&mdash;<i>that</i> was left for the mighty
  intellects of this age to discover&mdash;that as we were boys, a Christian
  principle and a Christian standard were above our comprehension, and alien
  from our possible attainments; we did not believe then, nor will I now, that
  a clear river is likely to flow from a polluted stream, or a good tree grow
  from bitter fibres and cankered roots.</p>

  <p>Walter and the others spent a very happy evening with Mr Percival. When
  tea was over they talked as freely with him, and with each other in his
  presence, as they would have done among themselves; and the occasional
  society of their elders and superiors was in every way good for them. It
  enlarged their sympathies, widened their knowledge, and raised their moral
  tone.</p>

  <p>Among many other subjects that evening they talked over one which never
  fails to interest deeply every right-minded boy&mdash;I mean their homes. It
  was no wonder that, as Walter talked of the glories of Semlyn lake and its
  surrounding hills, his face lighted up, and his eyes shone with pleasant
  memories. Mr Percival, as he looked at him, felt more puzzled than ever at
  his having gone wrong, and more confirmed than ever in the opinion that he
  had been hard and unjust to him of late, and that his original estimate of
  him was the right one after all.</p>

  <p>Power&rsquo;s home was a statelier one than Walter&rsquo;s. His father,
  Sir Lawrence Power, was a baronet, the owner of broad acres, whose large and
  beautiful mansion stood on one of the undulations in a park shadowed by
  ancestral trees, under whose boughs the deer fed with their graceful fawns
  around them. Through the park flowed a famous river, of which the windings
  were haunted by herons and kingfishers, and the pleasant waters abounded in
  trout and salmon. And to this estate and title Power was heir; though of
  course he did not tell them this while he spoke of the lovely scenery around
  the home where his fathers had so long lived.</p>

  <p>Henderson, again, was the son of a rich merchant, who had two
  houses&mdash;one city and one suburban. He was a regular little man of the
  world. After the holidays he had always seen the last feats of Saltori, and
  heard the most recent strains of Tiralirini. He always went to a round of
  entertainments, and would make you laugh by the hour while he sang the songs
  or imitated the style of the last comic actor or Ethiopian minstrel.</p>

  <p>While they were chatting over their holiday amusements and occupations,
  Kenrick said little; and, wondering at his silence, Mr Percival asked him in
  what part of the world he lived.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I, sir?&rdquo; he said, as though awaked from a reverie; &ldquo;Oh,
  I live at Fuzby, a village on the border of the fens, and in the very middle
  of the heavy clays.&rdquo; And Kenrick turned away his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abuse the clay,&rdquo; said Walter to cheer him up;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of the clay; it produces good roses and good
  strawberries&mdash;and those are the two best things going, in any
  soil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Half-past ten, youngsters,&rdquo; said Mr Percival, holding up his
  watch; &ldquo;off with you to bed. Let yourselves in through the grounds;
  here&rsquo;s the key. Good-night to you. Walter,&rdquo; he said, calling him
  back as he was about to leave, &ldquo;one word with you alone; you three wait
  for him a moment outside. I wanted to tell you that, although I have seemed
  harsh to you, I dare say, of late, yet now I hear that you are making the
  most honourable efforts, and I have quite forgotten the past. My good opinion
  of you, Walter, is quite restored; and whenever you want to be quiet to learn
  your lessons, you may always come and sit in my room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Percival was not the only Saint Winifred&rsquo;s master who thus
  generously abridged his own leisure and privacy to assist the boys in what he
  felt an interest. Walter thanked him with real gratitude, and rejoined the
  other three. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s let me sit in his room,&rdquo; said
  Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;so he has me. How jolly! we
  shall get on twice as well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Power, pointing upwards, as they
  walked through the garden to their house door.</p>

  <p>Glancing in the direction, Walter saw a light suddenly go out in his
  dormitory, and a great bundle (apparently) disappear inside the window, which
  was then shut down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good-night, you
  fellows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All was quiet when he reached his room, but one of the candles,
  ineffectually extinguished, was still smoking, and when he looked to
  Eden&rsquo;s bed he saw by the gaslight that shone through the open door,
  that the child was awake, and crying bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Eden?&rdquo; he said kindly, sitting down
  upon his bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you peach,&rdquo; said Harpour and Jones together; &ldquo;you
  know what you&rsquo;ll get.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you fellows been bullying poor little Eden?&rdquo; asked
  Walter indignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not,&rdquo; said
  Anthony and Franklin, who were better than the rest in every way; and
  &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t touched the fellow, Evson,&rdquo; said Cradock, who
  meant no harm, and at Walter&rsquo;s earnest request had never again annoyed
  Eden since the first night.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor little Eden&mdash;poor little fiddlestick,&rdquo; said Jones,
  &ldquo;it does the young cub good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Send him home to his grandmamma, and let him have his bib and his
  night-cap,&rdquo; growled Harpour; &ldquo;is he made of butter, and are you
  afraid of his melting, you Evson, that you make such a fuss with him? You
  want your lickings yourself, and shall have them if you don&rsquo;t look
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you do to <i>me</i>, Harpour,&rdquo;
  rejoined Walter, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll do very much.
  But I do tell you that it&rsquo;s a blackguard shame for a great big fellow
  like you to torment a little delicate chap like Eden; and what&rsquo;s more,
  you shan&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t! my patience. I like that I why, who is to prevent
  me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll turn sneak, and peach,&rdquo; said Jones;
  &ldquo;he&rsquo;d do anything that&rsquo;s mean, we all know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter was always liable to that taunt now. It was a part of his
  punishment, and the one which lasted longest. From any other boy he might
  have winced under it; but really, coming from Jones, it was too contemptible
  to notice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shut up, Jones,&rdquo; he said angrily; &ldquo;you shan&rsquo;t
  touch Eden again, I can tell you, whatever Harpour does, and he&rsquo;d
  better look out what he does.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look out yourself,&rdquo; said Harpour, flinging a football boot at
  Walter&rsquo;s head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find your boot on the grass outside to-morrow
  morning,&rdquo; said Walter, opening the window, and dropping it down. He
  wasn&rsquo;t a bit afraid, because he always went on the instinctive and
  never-mistaken assumption, that a bully must be a coward in his inmost
  nature. Cruelty to the weaker is incompatible with the generosity of all true
  courage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Jove, I&rsquo;ll thrash you for that to-morrow,&rdquo; shouted
  Harpour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>To-morrow</i>!&rdquo; said Walter with great contempt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t make him angry, Walter,&rdquo; whispered Eden;
  &ldquo;you know what a strong fellow he is,&rdquo; (Eden shuddered, as though
  <i>he</i> had reason to know); &ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t fight him; and you
  mustn&rsquo;t get a thrashing for my sake. I&rsquo;m not worth that.
  I&rsquo;d rather bear it myself, Walter&mdash;indeed I would.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, poor little Eden,&rdquo; said Walter;
  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re safe to-night at any rate. Why, how cold you are! What
  <i>have</i> they been doing to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t tell you to-night, Walter; I will to-
  morrow,&rdquo; he answered in a low tone, shivering all over.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, go to sleep now, my little man; and don&rsquo;t you be
  afraid of Harpour or any one else. I won&rsquo;t let them bully you if I can
  help it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eden squeezed Walter&rsquo;s hand tight, and sobbed his thanks, while
  Walter gently smoothed the child&rsquo;s pillow and dried his tears.</p>

  <p>Poor Eden! as I said before, he was too weak, too delicate, too tenderly
  nurtured, and far, far too young for the battle of life in a public school.
  For even at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, as there are and must be at all great
  schools, there were some black sheep in the flock undiscovered, and therefore
  unseparated from the rest.</p>

  <h2>XII. &mdash; MY BROTHER&rsquo;S KEEPER</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.<br>
    Our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners.&rdquo;</i><br>
    &mdash;Othello, Act One Scene 3.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">AS Walter lay awake for a few quiet moments before he sent
  his thoughts to rest, he glanced critically, like an Indian gymnosophist,
  over the occurrences of the day. He could not but rejoice that the last
  person for whom he felt real regard had forgiven him his rash act, and that
  his offence had thus finally been absolved on earth as in heaven. He
  rejoiced, too, that Mr Percival&rsquo;s kind permission to learn his lessons
  in his room would give him far greater advantages and opportunities than he
  had hitherto enjoyed. Yet Walter&rsquo;s conscience was not quite at ease.
  The last scene had disturbed him. The sobs and shiverings of little Eden had
  fallen very reproachfully into his heart. Walter felt that he might have done
  far more for him than he had done. He had, indeed, even throughout his own
  absorbing troubles, extended to the child a general protection, but not a
  special care. It never occurred to him to excuse himself with the thought
  that he was &ldquo;not his brother&rsquo;s keeper.&rdquo; The truth was that
  he had found Eden uninteresting, because he had not taken the pains to be
  interested in him, and while one voice within his heart reproved him of
  neglect and selfishness, another voice seemed to say to him, in a firm yet
  kindlier tone, &ldquo;Now that thou are converted, strengthen thy
  brethren.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For indeed as yet Eden&rsquo;s had been a very unhappy lot. Bullied,
  teased, and persecuted by the few among whom accident had first thrown him,
  and judged to belong to their set by others who on that account considered
  him a boy of a bad sort, he was almost friendless at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s.
  And the loneliness, the despair of this feeling, weighing upon his heart,
  robbed him of all courage to face the difficulties of work, so that in school
  as well as out of it, he was always in trouble. He was for ever clumsily
  scrawling in his now illegible hand the crooked and blotted lines of
  punishment which his seeming ignorance or sluggishness brought upon him; and
  although he was always to be seen at detention, he almost hailed this
  disgrace as affording him at least some miserable shadow of occupation, and a
  refuge, however undesirable, from the torments of those degraded few to whom
  his childish tears, his weak entreaties, his bursts of impotent passion,
  caused nothing but low amusement. Out of school his great object always was
  to hide himself; anywhere, so as to be beyond the reach of Jones, Harpour,
  and other bullies of the same calibre. For this purpose he would conceal
  himself for a whole afternoon at a time up in the fir-groves, listlessly
  gathering into heaps the red sheddings of their umbrage, and pulling to
  pieces their dry and fragrant cones; or, when he feared that these resorts
  would be disturbed by some little gang of lounging smokers, he would choose
  some lonely place, under the shadow of the mountain cliffs, and sit for hours
  together, aimlessly rolling white lumps of quartz over the shingly banks.
  Under continued trials like these he became quite changed. The childish
  innocence and beauty of countenance, the childish frankness and gaiety of
  heart, the childish quickness and intelligence of understanding, were
  exchanged for vacant looks, stupid indifference, and that half-cunning
  expression which is always induced by craven fear. Accustomed, too, to be
  waited upon and helped continually in the home where his mother, a gay young
  widow, had petted and spoiled him, he became slovenly and untidy in dress and
  habits. He rarely found time or heart to write home, and even when he did, he
  so well knew that his mother was incapable of sympathy or comprehension of
  his suffering, that the dirty and ill-spelt scrawl rarely alluded to the one
  dim consciousness that brooded over him night and day&mdash;that he
  couldn&rsquo;t understand life, and only knew that he was a very friendless,
  unhappy, unpitied little boy. If he could have found even one to whom to
  unfold and communicate his griefs, even one to love him unreservedly, all the
  inner beauty and brightness of his character would have blown and expanded in
  that genial warmth. He once thought that in Walter he had found such an one,
  but when he saw that his dullness bored Walter, and that his listless manners
  and untidy habits made him cross, he shrank back within himself. He was
  thankful to Walter as a protector, but did not look upon him as a friend in
  whom he could implicitly confide. The flower without sunshine will lose its
  colour and its perfume. Six weeks after Arthur Eden, a merry, bright-eyed
  child, alighted from his mother&rsquo;s carriage at the old gate of Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s school, no casual stranger would have recognised him again
  in the pale and moping little fellow who seemed to be afraid of every one
  whom he met.</p>

  <p>Oh, if we knew how rare, how sweet, how deep human love can be, how
  easily, yet how seldom it is gained, how inexpressible the treasure is when
  once it <i>has</i> been gained, we should not trample on human hearts as
  lightly as most men do! Any one who in that hard time had spoken a few kindly
  words to Eden&mdash;any one who would have taken him gently for a short while
  by the hand, and helped him over the stony places that hurt his unaccustomed
  feet&mdash;any one who would have suffered, or who would have invited him, to
  pour his sorrows into their ears and assist him to sustain them&mdash;might
  have won, even at that slight cost, the deepest and most passionate love of
  that trembling young heart. He might have saved him from hours of numbing
  pain, and won the rich reward of a gratitude well-deserved and generously
  repaid. There were many boys at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s gentle-hearted,
  right-minded, of kindly and manly impulses; but all of them, except Walter,
  lost this golden opportunity of conferring pure happiness by disinterested
  good deeds. They did not buy up the occasion, which goes away and burns the
  priceless books she offers, if they are not purchased unquestioningly and at
  once.</p>

  <p>And Walter regretfully felt that he was very very nearly too late; so
  nearly, that perhaps in a week or two more Eden might have lost hopelessly,
  and for ever, all trace of self-respect&mdash;might have been benumbed into
  mental imbecility by the torpedo-like influence of helpless grief. Walter
  felt as if he had been selfishly looking on while a fellow-creature was fast
  sinking in the water, and as if it were only at the last possible moment that
  he had held out a saving hand. But, by God&rsquo;s grace, he <i>did</i> hold
  out the saving hand at last, and it was grasped firmly, and a dear life was
  saved. Years after when Arthur Eden had grown into&mdash;but stop, I must not
  so far anticipate my story. Suffice it to say, that Walter&rsquo;s kindness
  to Eden, helped to bring about long afterwards one of the chief happinesses
  of his own life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come a stroll, Eden, before third school, and let&rsquo;s have a
  talk,&rdquo; he said, as they came out from dinner in hall the next day.</p>

  <p>Eden looked up happily, and he was proud to be seen by Walter&rsquo;s side
  in the throng of boys, as they passed out, and across the court, and under
  the shadow of the arch towards Walter&rsquo;s favourite haunt, the seashore.
  Walter never felt weak or unhappy for long together, when the sweetness of
  the sea-wind was on his forehead, and the song of the sea waves in his ear. A
  run upon the shore in all weathers, if only for five minutes, was his daily
  pleasure and resource.</p>

  <p>They sat down; the sea flashed before them a mirror of molten gold, except
  where the summits of the great mountain of Appenfell threw their deep broad
  shadows, which seemed purple by contrast with the brightness over which they
  fell. Walter sat, full of healthy enjoyment as he breathed the pure
  atmosphere, and felt the delicious wind upon his glowing cheeks; and Eden was
  happy to be with him, and to sit quietly by his side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eden,&rdquo; said Walter, after a few moments, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  afraid you&rsquo;ve not been happy lately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The poor child shook his head, and answered, &ldquo;No one cares for me
  here; every one looks down on me, and is unkind; I&rsquo;ve no
  friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, don&rsquo;t you count me as a friend, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter, you&rsquo;re very kind; I&rsquo;m sure I
  <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have lived here if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you; but
  you&rsquo;re so much above me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter would not press him to fill up the omission, he could understand
  the rest of the sentence for himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t feel how good you&rsquo;ve
  been to me, Walter,&rdquo; said the boy, drawing near to him, and taking his
  hand; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;I understand it all. Well,
  never mind, I <i>will</i> be a friend to you now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A tear trembled on Eden&rsquo;s long eyelashes as he looked up quickly
  into Walter&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Will you, Walter? thank you, I have no other
  friend here; and please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you call me Arthur, as they do at home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter smiled. &ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me what they
  were doing to you last night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell them I told you, Walter,&rdquo; he answered,
  looking round, with the old look of decrepit fear usurping his face, which
  had brightened for the moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Walter, impatiently; &ldquo;why, what a little
  coward you are, Eden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boy shrank back into himself as if he had received a blow, and relaxed
  his grasp of Walter&rsquo;s hand; but Walter, struck with the sensitive
  timidity which unkindness had caused, and sorry to have given him pain in all
  his troubles, said kindly&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, Arty, never mind; I didn&rsquo;t mean it; don&rsquo;t be
  afraid; tell me what they did to you. I saw a light in our dormitory as I was
  coming back from Percival&rsquo;s, and I saw something dragged through the
  window. What was it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was me,&rdquo; said Eden navely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; poor me. They let me down by a sheet which they tied round my
  waist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, from that high window? I hope they tied you tight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only one knot; I ever so nearly slipped out of it last night, and
  that&rsquo;s what frightened me so, Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How horribly dangerous,&rdquo; said Walter indignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know it is horribly dangerous,&rdquo; said Eden, standing up, and
  gesticulating violently, in one of those bursts of passion which flashed out
  of him now and then, and were the chief amusement of his persecutors;
  &ldquo;and I dream about it all night,&rdquo; he said, bursting into tears,
  &ldquo;and I know, I know that some day I shall slip, or the knot will come
  undone, and I shall fall and be smashed to atoms. But what do they care for
  that? and I sometimes wish I were dead myself, to have it all
  over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Arty, don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; said Walter, as he
  felt the little soiled hand trembling with passion and emotion in his own.
  &ldquo;But what on earth do they let you down for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To go to&mdash;but you won&rsquo;t tell?&rdquo; he said, looking
  round again. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot, you didn&rsquo;t like my saying that. But
  it&rsquo;s they who have made me a coward, Walter; indeed it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And no wonder,&rdquo; thought Walter to himself. &ldquo;But you
  needn&rsquo;t be afraid any more,&rdquo; he said aloud; &ldquo;I promise you
  that no one shall do anything to you which they&rsquo;d be afraid to do to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m safe,&rdquo; said Eden, joyfully. &ldquo;Well, they
  made me go to&mdash;to Dan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s? what, the fisherman&rsquo;s just near the
  shore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; ugh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know, Arty, that Dan&rsquo;s a brute, and a
  regular smuggler, and that if you were caught going there, you&rsquo;d be
  sent away?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; you can&rsquo;t think, Walter, how I <i>hate</i>, and how
  frightened I am to go there. There&rsquo;s Dan, and there&rsquo;s that great
  lout of a wicked son of his, and they&rsquo;re always drunk, and the
  hut&mdash;ugh! it&rsquo;s so nasty; and last night Dan seized hold of me with
  his horrid red hand, and wanted me to drink some gin, and I shrieked.&rdquo;
  The very remembrance seemed to make him shudder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, after that I was nearly caught. I think, Walter, that
  even you would be a coward if you had such long long frights. You know that
  to get to Dan&rsquo;s, after the gates are locked, the only way is to go over
  the railing, and through Dr Lane&rsquo;s garden, and I&rsquo;m always
  frightened to death lest his great dog should be loose, and should catch hold
  of me. He did growl last night. And then as I was hurrying back&mdash;you
  know it was rather moonlight last night, and not very cold&mdash;and who
  should I see but the Doctor himself walking up and down the garden. I
  crouched in a minute behind a thick holly-tree, and I suppose I made a
  rustle, though I held my breath, for the Doctor stopped and shook the tree,
  and said &lsquo;shoo,&rsquo; as though he thought a cat were hidden there. I
  was half dead with fright, though I did hope, after all, that he would catch
  me, and that I might be sent away from this horrid place. But when he turned
  round, I crept away, and made the signal, and they let down the sheet, and
  then, as they were hauling me up, I heard voices&mdash;I suppose they must
  have been yours and Kenrick&rsquo;s; but they thought it was some master, and
  doused the glim, and oh! so nearly let me fall; so, Walter, please
  don&rsquo;t despise me, or be angry with me because you found me crying and
  shivering in bed. The cold made me shiver, and I couldn&rsquo;t help crying;
  indeed I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Arty, poor Arty,&rdquo; said Walter, soothingly. &ldquo;But
  have they ever done this before?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, once, when you were at the choir-supper, one night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They never shall again, I swear,&rdquo; said Walter, frowning, as
  he thought how detestably cruel they had been. &ldquo;But what did they send
  you for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For no good,&rdquo; said Eden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; I knew it would be for no good, if it was to Dan&rsquo;s that
  they sent you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Walter, the first time it was for some drink; and the second
  time for some more drink,&rdquo; he said, after a little hesitation.</p>

  <p>Walter looked serious. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know, Arty,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s very wrong to get such things for them? If they
  want to have any dealings with that beast Dan, who&rsquo;s not fit to speak
  to, let them go themselves. Arty, it&rsquo;s very wrong; you mustn&rsquo;t do
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But how can I help it?&rdquo; said the boy, looking frightened and
  ashamed. &ldquo;Oh, must I always be blamed by every one,&rdquo; he said,
  putting his hands to his eyes. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my sin, Walter,
  it&rsquo;s theirs. They made me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Nobody can ever make anyone else do what&rsquo;s wrong</i>,
  Arty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; it&rsquo;s all very easy for <i>you</i> to say that,
  Walter, who can fight anybody, and who are so strong and good, and whom no
  one dares bully, and who are not laughed at, and made a butt of, as I
  am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look at Power,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;or look at Dubbs. They
  came as young as you, Arty, and as weak as you, but no one ever made
  <i>them</i> do wrong. Power somehow looks too noble to be bullied by anyone;
  they&rsquo;re afraid of him, I don&rsquo;t know why. But what had Dubbs to
  protect him? Yet not all the Harpours in the world would ever make him go to
  such a place as Dan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Poor Eden felt it hard to be blamed for this; he was not yet strong enough
  to learn that the path of duty, however hard and thorny, however hedged in
  with difficulties and antagonisms, is always the easiest and the pleasantest
  in the end.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;d half kill me, Walter,&rdquo; he said
  plaintively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have much more chance of doing that as it is,&rdquo;
  said Walter. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d thrash you a little, no doubt, but respect
  you more for it. And surely it would be better to bear one thrashing, and not
  do what&rsquo;s wrong, than to do it and to go two such journeys out of the
  window, and get the thrashings into the bargain? So even on <i>that</i>
  ground you ought to refuse. Eh, Arty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter,&rdquo; he said, casting down his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well; next time either Harpour, or any one else, tries to make you
  do what&rsquo;s wrong, remember they <i>can&rsquo;t</i> make you, if you
  don&rsquo;t choose; and say flatly &lsquo;<i>No</i>!&rsquo; and stick to it
  in spite of everything, like a brave little man, will you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did say &lsquo;No!&rsquo; at first, Walter; but they threatened
  to frighten me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They knew I daren&rsquo;t hold
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yes; there was the secret of it all. Walter saw that they had played on
  this child&rsquo;s natural terrors with such refinement of cruelty, that fear
  had become the master principle in his mind; they had only to touch that
  spring and he obeyed them mechanically like a puppet, and because of his very
  fear, was driven to do things that might well cause genuine fear, till he
  lived in such a region of increasing fear and dread, that Walter&rsquo;s only
  surprise was that he had not been made an idiot already. Poor child! it was
  no wonder that he was becoming more stupid, cunning, untidy, and
  uninteresting, every day. And all this was going on under the very eyes of
  many thoroughly noble boys, and conscientious masters, and yet they never saw
  or noticed it, and looked on Eden as an idle and unprincipled little sloven.
  O our harsh human judgments! The Priest and the Levite still pass the wounded
  man, and the good Samaritans are rare on this world&rsquo;s highways.</p>

  <p>What was Walter to do? He did not know the very name of psychology, but he
  did know the unhinging, desolating power of an overmastering spirit of fear.
  He knew that fear hath torment, but he had no conception by what means that
  demon can be exorcised. Yet he thought, as he raised his eyes for one instant
  to heaven in silent supplication, that there were few devils who would not go
  out by prayer, and he made a strong resolve that he would use every endeavour
  to make up for his past neglectfulness, and to save this poor unhappy
  child.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming you, Arthur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I
  like you, and don&rsquo;t want to see you go wrong, and be a tool in bad
  boys&rsquo; hands. I hope you ask God to help you, Arthur?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eden looked at him, but said nothing. He had been taught but little, and
  by example he had been taught <i>nothing</i> of the Awful Far-off Friend Who
  is yet so near to every humble spirit, and Who even now had sent His angel to
  save this lamb who knew not of His fold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Arthur&mdash;ah! there I hear the third school-bell,
  and we must go in&mdash;but listen! I&rsquo;ll be your friend; I want to be
  your friend. I&rsquo;ll try and save you from all this persecution. Will you
  always trust me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eden&rsquo;s look of gratitude more than repaid him, and Walter added,
  &ldquo;And, Arty, you must not give up your prayers. Ask God to help you, and
  to keep you from going wrong, and to make you brave. Won&rsquo;t you,
  Arty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The little boy&rsquo;s heart was full even to breaking with its weight of
  happy tears; it was too full to speak. He pressed Walter&rsquo;s hand for one
  moment, and walked in by his side, without a word.</p>

  <h2>XIII. &mdash; DAUBENY</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>La Gnie c&rsquo;est la Patience.</i><br>
    &mdash;Buffon.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">I SUPPOSE that no days of life are so happy as those in
  which some great sorrow has been removed. Certainly Walter&rsquo;s days as
  his heart grew lighter and lighter with the consciousness that Mr Paton had
  forgiven him, that all those who once looked on him coldly had come round,
  that his difficulties were vanishing before steady diligence, and that, young
  as he was, he was winning for himself a name and a position in the school,
  were very full of peace. O pleasant days of boyhood! how mercifully they are
  granted to prepare us, to cheer us, to make us wise for the struggles of
  future life. To Walter at this time life itself was an exhilarating
  enjoyment. To get up in the morning bright, cheerful, and refreshed, with
  thoughts:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Pleasant as roses in the thickets blown,<br>
    And pure as dew bathing their crimson leaves;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>to get over his lessons easily and successfully, and receive Mr
  Paton&rsquo;s quiet word of praise; to shake with laughing over the flood of
  nonsense with which Henderson always deluged everyone who sat near him at
  breakfast-time; to help little Eden in his morning&rsquo;s work, and to see
  with what intense affection and almost adoration the child looked up to him;
  to stroll with Kenrick under the pine woods, or have a pleasant chat in
  Power&rsquo;s pretty little study, or read a book in the luxurious retirement
  of Mr Percival&rsquo;s room, or, if it were a half-holiday, to join in the
  skating, hare and hounds, football, or whatever game might be on
  hand&mdash;all these things were to Walter Evson one long unbroken pleasure.
  At this time he was the brightest, and pleasantest, and happiest of all
  light-hearted and happy English boys.</p>

  <p>The permission to go whenever he liked to Mr Percival&rsquo;s room was his
  most valued privilege. There he could always secure such immunity from
  disturbance as enabled him to learn his lessons in half the time he would
  otherwise have been obliged to devote to them; and there too he could always
  ask the master&rsquo;s assistance when he came to any insuperable difficulty,
  and always enjoy the society of Henderson and the one or two other boys who
  were allowed by Mr Percival&rsquo;s kindness to use the same retreat. From
  the bottom of his form he rapidly rose to the top, and at last was actually
  placed first. A murmur of pleasure ran through the form on the first Sunday
  when his name was read out in this honourable position, and it gave Walter
  nearly as much satisfaction to hear Henderson&rsquo;s name read out
  <i>sixth</i> on the same day; for before Walter came, Henderson was too
  volatile ever to care where he stood in form, and usually spent his time in
  school in drawing caricatures of the masters, and writing parodies of the
  lesson or epigrams on other boys; up till this time Daubeny had always been
  first in the form, and he deserved the place if any boy did. He was not a
  clever boy, but nothing could exceed his well-intentioned industry. Like Sir
  Walter Raleigh he &ldquo;toiled terribly.&rdquo; It was an almost pathetic
  sight to see Dubbs set about learning his repetitions; it was a noble sight,
  too. There was a heroism about it which was all the greater from its being
  unnoticed and unrecorded. Poor Dubbs had no privacy except such as the great
  schoolroom could afford, and there is not much privacy in a room, however
  large, which is the common habitation of fifty boys. Nevertheless, the
  undaunted Daubeny would choose out the quietest and loneliest corner of the
  room, and with elbows on knees and hands over his ears to shut out the
  chaotic noises which surrounded him, would stay repeating the lines to
  himself with attention wholly concentrated and absorbed, until, after perhaps
  an hour&rsquo;s work, he knew enough of them to enable him to finish
  mastering them the next morning. Next morning he would be up with the
  earliest dawn, and would again set himself to the task with grand
  determination, content if at the end of the week he gained the distinguished
  reward of being head in his form, and could allow himself the keen pleasure
  of writing home to tell his mother of his success.</p>

  <p>When Daubeny had first come to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, he had been forced
  to go through very great persecution. As he sat down to do his work he would
  be pelted with orange peel, kicked, tilted off the form on which he sat,
  ridiculed, and sometimes chased out of the room. All this he had endured with
  admirable patience and good humour; in short, so patiently and
  good-humouredly that all boys who had in them a spark of sense or honour very
  soon abandoned this system of torment, and made up for it as far as they
  could by respect and kindness, which always, however, took more or less the
  form of banter. It is not to be expected that boys will ever be made to see
  that steady, strenuous industry, even when it fails, is a greater and a
  better thing than idle cleverness, but those few who were so far in advance
  of their years as to have some intuition of this fact, felt for the character
  of Daubeny, a value which gave him an influence of a rare and important kind.
  For nothing could daunt this young martyr&mdash;not even failure itself. If
  he were too much bullied and annoyed to get up his lesson overnight, he would
  be up by five in the morning working at it with unremitting assiduity. Very
  often he <i>overdid</i> it, and knew his lesson all the worse in proportion
  as he had spent upon it too great an amount of time. Without being positively
  stupid, his intellect was somewhat dull, and as his manner was shy and
  awkward he had not been quite understood at first, and no master had taken
  him specially in hand to lighten his burdens. His bitterest trial, therefore,
  was to fail completely every now and then, and be reproached for it by some
  master who little knew the hours of weary work which he had devoted to the
  unsuccessful attempt. This was particularly the case during his first
  half-year, during which he had been in Mr Robertson&rsquo;s form. It happened
  that, from the very weariness of brain induced by his working too hard, he
  had failed in several successive lessons, and Mr Robertson, who was a man of
  quick temper and stinging speech, had made some very cutting remarks upon
  him, and sent him, moreover, to detention&mdash;a punishment which caused to
  his sensitive mind a pain hardly less acute than the master&rsquo;s pungent
  and undeserved sarcasm. This mishap, joined to his low weekly placing, very
  nearly filled him with despair, and this day might have turned the scale, and
  fixed him in the position of a heavy and disheartened boy, but for Power, who
  had come to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s at the same time with Daubeny, and who,
  although in his unusually rapid progress he had long left Daubeny behind, was
  then in the same form and the same dormitory with him, and knew how he
  worked. Power used always to say to his friends that Dubbs was the worthiest,
  the bravest, the most upright and conscientious boy in all Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s school. Daubeny, on the other hand, had for Power the kind
  of adoration of the savage for the sun; he was the boy&rsquo;s beau-ideal of
  a perfect scholar and a perfect being.&mdash;It was a curious sight to see
  the two boys together Power with his fine and thoughtful face beaming with
  intelligence, Dubbs with large, heavy features and awkward gait; Power
  sitting down with his book and perfectly mastering the lesson in a quarter of
  an hour, and then turning round to say, with a bright arch look, &ldquo;Well,
  Dubbs, I&rsquo;ve learnt the lesson; how far are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Learnt the lesson? O, lucky fellow. I only know one stanza and that
  not perfectly; let me see&mdash;&lsquo;Nam quid Typhoeus et validus Mimas nam
  quid&rsquo;&mdash;no; I don&rsquo;t know even that, I see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here, let me hear you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon Dubbs would begin again, and flounder hopelessly at the end of
  the third line, and then Power would continue it all through with him, fix
  the sense of it in his memory, read it over, suggest little mnemonic dodges
  and associations of particular words and lines, and not leave him until he
  knew it by heart, and was ready with gratitude enough to pluck out his right
  eye and give it to Power, if needed, there and then.</p>

  <p>The early failures we have been speaking of took place when Power had been
  staying out of school with a severe cold, and being in the sickroom had not
  seen Daubeny at all. He had come out again on the morning when, after
  Daubeny&rsquo;s failure, Mr Robertson had called him incorrigibly slothful
  and incapable, and after muttering some more invectives had said something
  about his being hopeless. As he listened to the master&rsquo;s remarks,
  although he knew that they only arose from misconception, Power&rsquo;s
  cheeks flushed up with painful surprise, and his eyes sparkled with
  indignation for his friend. He wanted Daubeny to tell Mr Robertson how many
  hours he had spent in being &ldquo;incorrigibly slothful&rdquo; over that
  particular lesson, but this at the time he could not get him to do.
  &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Daubeny, &ldquo;if he knows me to be quite
  hopeless&rdquo;&mdash;and here the poor boy grew scarlet as he recalled the
  undeserved insult&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s no disgrace to me to
  fail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When detention was over, Power sought out his friend, and found him
  sitting on the top of a little hill by the side of the river, alone, and with
  a most forlornly disconsolate air. Power saw that he had been crying
  bitterly, but had too much good taste to take any notice of the fact.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Power, you see what credit I get, and yet you know how I try.
  I&rsquo;m a &lsquo;bad, idle boy,&rsquo; it seems, and &lsquo;incorrigibly
  slothful,&rsquo; and &lsquo;hardly fit for the school,&rsquo; and &lsquo;I
  must be put down to a lower form if I don&rsquo;t make more
  effort&rsquo;&mdash;oh! I forgot though, you heard it all yourself. So you
  know my character,&rdquo; he said, with a melancholy smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, old fellow. You&rsquo;ve done your best, and none of us
  can do more. You know the soldier&rsquo;s epitaph&mdash;&lsquo;Here lies one
  who tried to do his duty&rsquo;&mdash;a prince could not have better, and you
  deserve that if anyone ever did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I were you, Power,&rdquo; said Daubeny; &ldquo;you are so
  clever, you can learn the lessons in no time; everyone likes you, and you get
  no end of credit, while I&rsquo;m a mere butt, and when I&rsquo;ve worked
  hard it&rsquo;s a case of <i>Kathedeitai honos</i>, as the lesson-book
  says.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh, Dubbs,&rdquo; said Power, kindly putting his arm on his
  shoulder; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just as happy as I am. A fellow with a clear
  conscience <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be in low spirits very long. Don&rsquo;t you
  remember the pretty verse I read to you the other day, and which made me
  think of you while I read it&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Days that, in spite<br>
    Of darkness, by the light<br>
    Of a clear mind are day all night?&rsquo;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I <i>envy</i> you, Power&mdash;you won&rsquo;t
  think that, will you?&rdquo; said Dubbs with the tears glistening in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, my dear old boy. Such a nature as yours can&rsquo;t envy, I
  know; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re as happy when I succeed as when you succeed
  yourself. I think I&rsquo;ve got the secret of it, Dubbs. You work <i>too</i>
  much; you must take more exercise&mdash;play games more&mdash;give less time
  to the work. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll do better then, for half is better
  than the whole sometimes. And Dubbs, I may say to you what I wouldn&rsquo;t
  say to any other boy in the whole school&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve found it
  <i>so</i> true, and I&rsquo;m sure you will too, and that is, Bene orasse est
  bene studuisse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dubbs pressed his hand in silence. The hard thoughts which had been
  gathering were dissipated in a moment, and as he walked back to the school
  and to new heroic efforts by Power&rsquo;s side, he felt that he had learnt a
  secret full of strength. He did better and better. He broke the neck of his
  difficulties one by one, and had soon surpassed boys who were far more
  brilliant, but less industrious, than himself. Thus it was that he fought his
  way up to the position of one of the steadiest and most influential boys
  among those of his own standing, because all knew him to be sterling in his
  virtues, unswerving in his rectitude, most humble, and most sincere. During
  all his school career he was never once overtaken in a serious fault. It may
  be that he had fewer temptations than boys more gifted and more mercurial; he
  was never exposed to the singularly powerful trials which compensated for the
  superiority of others to him in good looks, and popular manners, and quick
  passions; but yet his blamelessness had something in it very beautiful, and
  his noble upward struggles were remembered with fond pleasure in after
  days.</p>

  <p>Walter, like all other sensible boys, felt for Daubeny a very sincere
  admiration and regard. Daubeny&rsquo;s fearless rectitude, on the night when
  his own indulged temper led him into such suffering, had left a deep
  impression on his mind, and, since then, Dubbs had always been among the
  number of his more intimate friends. Hence, when Walter wrested from him the
  head place, he was half sorry that he should cause the boy to lose his
  well-merited success, and almost wished that he had come out second, and left
  Daubeny first. He knew that there was not in his rival&rsquo;s nature a
  particle of envy, but still he feared that he might suffer some
  disappointment. But in this he was mistaken; Daubeny was a firm believer in
  the principle of <i>La carrire ouverte aux talons</i>; he was, under the
  circumstances, quite as happy to be second as to be first; and among the many
  who congratulated Walter, none did so with a heartier sincerity than this
  generous and single-minded boy.</p>

  <p>People still retain the notion that boyish emulation is the almost certain
  cause of hatreds and jealousies. Usually, the fact is the very reverse. An
  <i>ungenerous</i> rivalry is most unusual, and those schoolfellows who
  dispute with a boy the prizes of a form are commonly his most intimate
  associates and his best friends. Certainly, Daubeny liked Walter none the
  less for his having wrested away from him with so much ease a distinction
  which had caused himself such strenuous efforts to win.</p>

  <p>The pleasant excitement of contending for a weekly position made Daubeny
  work harder than ever. Indeed, the whole form seemed to have received a new
  stimulus lately. Henderson was astonishing everybody by a fit of diligence,
  and even Howard Tracy seemed less totally indifferent to his place than
  usual. So willingly did the boys work, that Mr Paton had not half the number
  of punishments to set, and perhaps his late misfortune had infused a little
  more tenderness and consideration into a character always somewhat stern and
  unbending. But, instead of rising, Daubeny only lost places by his increased
  work; he was making himself ill with work. At the end of the next week,
  instead of being first or second, he was only fifth; and when Mr Percival,
  who always had been his friend, rallied him on this descent, he sighed
  deeply, and complained that he had been suffering lately from headaches, and
  supposed that they had prevented him from doing so well as usual.</p>

  <p>This remark rather alarmed the master, and on the Sunday afternoon he
  asked the boy to come a walk with him, for the express purpose of
  endeavouring to persuade him to relax efforts which were obviously being made
  to the injury of his health.</p>

  <p>When they had once fairly reached the meadows by the riverside, Mr
  Percival said to him&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are overdoing it, Daubeny. I can see myself that your mind is
  in a tense, excited, nervous condition from work; you must lie fallow, my
  dear boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O! I&rsquo;m very strong, sir,&rdquo; said Daubeny;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a cast-iron constitution, as that amusing plague of mine,
  Henderson, always tells me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, you must really work less. I won&rsquo;t have that
  getting up at five in the morning. If you don&rsquo;t take care, I shall
  <i>forbid</i> you to be higher than twentieth in your form under heavy
  penalties, or I shall get Dr Keith to send you home altogether, and not let
  you go in to the examination.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O! no, sir, you really mustn&rsquo;t do that. I assure you that I
  enjoy work. An illness I had when I was a child hindered and threw me back
  very much, and you can&rsquo;t think how eager I am to make up for that lost
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The time is not lost, my dear Daubeny, if God demanded it in
  illness for His own good purposes. Be persuaded, my boy; abandon, for the
  present, all struggle to take a high place until you feel quite well again,
  and then you shall work as hard as you like. Remember, knowledge itself is
  valueless in comparison with health.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Daubeny felt the master&rsquo;s kind intention; but he could not restrain
  his unconquerable eagerness to get on. He would have succumbed far sooner, if
  Walter and Power had not constantly dragged him out with them almost by
  force, and made him take exercise against his will. But, though he was
  naturally strong and healthy, he began to look very pale, and his best
  friends urged him to go home and take a holiday.</p>

  <p>Would that he had taken that good and kind advice!</p>

  <p class="first">IT was some weeks before the examination, and the close of
  the half-year, when one day Walter, full of glee, burst out of the
  schoolroom at twelve, when the lesson was over, to tell Kenrick an
  announcement just made to the forms, that the next day was to be a whole
  holiday.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; said Kenrick, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O! Somers has got no end of a scholarship at Cambridge&mdash;an
  awfully swell thing&mdash;and Dr Lane gave a holiday directly he got the
  telegram announcing the news.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well done, old Somers!&rdquo; said Kenrick. &ldquo;What shall we
  do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O! I&rsquo;ve had a scheme for a long time in my head, Ken; I want
  you to come with me to the top of Appenfell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whew-w-w! but it&rsquo;s a tremendous long walk, and no one goes up
  in winter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, all the more fun and glory, and we shall have the whole
  day before us. I&rsquo;ve been longing to beat that proud old Appenfell for a
  long time. I&rsquo;m certain we can do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But do you mean that we two should go alone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, no; we&rsquo;ll ask Flip, to amuse us on the way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And may I ask Power?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said Kenrick, who was, I am sorry to say, not a
  little jealous of the friendship which had sprung up between Power and
  Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And would you mind Daubeny joining us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all; and he&rsquo;s clearly overworking himself. It&rsquo;ll
  do him good. Let me see&mdash;you, Power, Flip, Dubbs, and me; that&rsquo;ll
  be enough, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I should like to ask Eden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eden!&rdquo; said Kenrick with the least little touch of contempt
  in his tone of voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor little fellow,&rdquo; said Walter smiling sadly; &ldquo;so
  you, too, despise him. No wonder he doesn&rsquo;t get on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O! let him come by all means, if you like,&rdquo; said Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Ken&mdash;but now I come to think of it, it&rsquo;s too far
  for him. Never mind; let&rsquo;s go before dinner, and order some sandwiches
  for to-morrow, and forage generally, at Cole&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Power and Daubeny gladly consented to join the excursion. At tea, Walter
  asked Henderson if he&rsquo;d come with them, and he, being just then in a
  phase of nonsense which made him speak of everything in a manner intended to
  be Homeric, answered with oracular gravity&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Him addressed in reply the laughter-loving son of Hender:<br>
    Thou askest me, oh Evds, like to the immortals,<br>
    Whether thee I will accompany, and the much-enduring Dubbs,<br>
    And the counsellor Power, and the revered ox-eyed Kenrick,<br>
    To the tops of thousand-crested many-fountained Appenfell.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Grotesque idiot,&rdquo; said Kenrick, laughing; &ldquo;cease this
  weak, washy, everlasting flood of twaddle, and tell us whether you&rsquo;ll
  come or no.&rdquo;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Him sternly eyeing, addressed in reply the mighty Henderides,<br>
    Heavy with tea, with the eyes of a dog, and the heart of a reindeer!<br>
    What word has escaped thee, the barrier of thy teeth?<br>
    Contrary to right, not according to right, hast thou spoken.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake shut up before you&rsquo;ve driven us
  stark raving mad,&rdquo; said Walter, putting his hand over Henderson&rsquo;s
  lips. &ldquo;Now, yes or no; will you come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thee will I accompany&mdash;&rdquo; said Henderson, struggling to
  get clear of Walter, &ldquo;to many-fountained Appenfell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah! that&rsquo;ll do. We have got an answer out of you at last;
  and now go on spouting the whole Iliad if you like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Full of spirits they started after breakfast the next morning, and as they
  climbed higher and higher up the steep mountainside, the keen air exhilarated
  them, and showed, as through a crystal glass, the exceeding glory of the
  hills flung on every side around them, and the broad living sparkle of the
  sea caught here and there in glimpses between the nearer peaks. Walter,
  Henderson, and Kenrick, were in front, while at some distance behind them,
  Power helped on Daubeny, who soon showed signs of fatigue.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look at that pappy fellow, Evson,&rdquo; said Daubeny, sighing;
  &ldquo;how he is bounding along in front. How active he is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem out of spirits,&rdquo; said Power kindly;
  &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. A little tired, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely not fretting about having lost the head
  place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no. &lsquo;Palmam qui meruit ferat.&rsquo; As Robertson said
  the other day in his odd, fantastic way of expressing his
  thoughts&mdash;&lsquo;In the amber of duty you must not always expect to find
  the curious grub success.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, you&rsquo;d be higher if you worked less, my dear
  fellow. Let me persuade you&mdash;don&rsquo;t work for examination any
  more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You all mistake me. It&rsquo;s not for the <i>place</i> that I
  work, but because I want to <i>know</i>, to <i>learn</i>; not to grow up
  quite stupid and empty-headed as I otherwise should do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a love for work you have, Daubeny.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have now; but do you know it really wasn&rsquo;t natural to
  me. As a child, I used to be idle and get on very badly, and it used to vex
  my poor father, who was then living, very much. Well, one day, not long
  before he died, I had been very obstinate, and would learn nothing. He
  didn&rsquo;t say much, but in the afternoon, when we were taking a walk, we
  passed an old barn, and on the thatched roof was a lot of grass and
  stonecrop. He plucked a handful, and showed me how rank and useless it was,
  and then, resting his hand upon my head, he told me that it was the type of
  an idle, useless man&mdash;&lsquo;grass upon the housetops, withered before
  it groweth up, wherewith the mower filleth not his hand, nor he that
  gathereth the sheaves his bosom.&rsquo; Somehow, the circumstance took hold
  of my imagination; it was the last scene with my poor father which I vividly
  remember. I have never been idle since then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Power mused a little, and then said&mdash;&ldquo;But, dear Dubbs,
  you&rsquo;ll make your brain heavy by the time examination begins; you
  won&rsquo;t be able to do yourself justice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not answer; but a weary look, which Power had often observed, with
  anxiety, came over his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I must turn back, Power,&rdquo; he said;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite tired&mdash;done up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking so, too. Let me turn back with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no! I won&rsquo;t spoil your day&rsquo;s excursion. Let me go
  alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hi! you fellows,&rdquo; said Power, shouting to the three in front.
  They were too far in advance to hear him, so he told Daubeny to sit down
  while he overtook them, and asked if any of them would prefer to turn
  back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dubbs is too tired to go any farther,&rdquo; he said, when he
  reached them, breathless with his run. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s
  very well, and so I&rsquo;ll just go back with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, no; you really mustn&rsquo;t, <i>I</i> will,&rdquo; said each of
  the other three almost in a breath. Every one of the four was most anxious to
  get on, and reach the top of Appenfell, which was considered a very great
  feat among the boys even in summer, as the climb was dangerous and severe;
  and yet each generously wished to undergo the self-denial of turning back. As
  their wills were about equally strong, it would have ended in <i>all</i> of
  them accompanying Daubeny, had he not, when they reached him, positively
  refused to turn on such conditions, and suggested that they should decide it
  by drawing lots.</p>

  <p>Power wrote the names on slips of paper, and Walter drew one at hazard.
  The lot fell on Henderson, so he at once took Daubeny&rsquo;s arm, relieving
  his disappointment by turning round, shaking his fist at the top of
  Appenfell, and saying, &ldquo;You be hanged! I wish you were rolled out
  <i>quite flat</i> and planted with potatoes!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Power laughing, &ldquo;I should think that was
  about the grossest indignity the Genius of Appenfell ever had offered to him;
  so now you&rsquo;ve had your revenge, take care of Dubbs. Good-
  bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How very kind it is of you to come with me, Flip,&rdquo; said
  Daubeny; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could manage to get home without your
  help; but I&rsquo;m quite vexed to drag you back. Good-bye, you
  fellows.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter, Power, and Kenrick, found that to reach the cairn on the top of
  Appenfell taxed all their strength. The mountain seemed to heave before them
  a succession of huge shoulders, and each one that they surmounted showed them
  only fresh steeps to climb. At last, they reached the piled confusion of
  rocks, painted with every gorgeous and brilliant colour by emerald moss and
  golden lichen, which marked the approach to the summit; and Walter, who was a
  long way the first to get to the top, shouted to encourage the other two,
  and, after resting a few minutes, clambered down to assist their progress.
  Being accustomed to the hills, he was far less tired than they were, and
  could give them very efficient help.</p>

  <p>At the top they rested for some time, eating their scanty lunch, chatting,
  and enjoying the matchless splendour of the prospect which stretched in a
  cloudless expanse before them on every side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Power,&rdquo; said Walter, in a pause of their talk,
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long been meaning to ask you a favour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s granted, then,&rdquo; said Power, &ldquo;if <i>you</i>
  ask it, Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure; it&rsquo;s a very serious favour, and it
  isn&rsquo;t for myself; moreover, it&rsquo;s very cool.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The greater it is, the more I shall know that you trust my
  friendship, Walter; and, if it&rsquo;s cool, it suits the time and
  place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet, I bet you that you&rsquo;ll hesitate when I propose
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, out with it; you make me curious.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is that you&rsquo;d give little Eden the run of your
  study.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Little Eden the run of my study! O, yes, if you wish it,&rdquo;
  said Power, not liking to object after what he had said, but flushing up a
  little, involuntarily. It was indeed a great favour to ask. Power&rsquo;s
  study was a perfect sanctum; he had furnished it with such rare good taste,
  that, when you entered, your eye was attracted by some pretty print or neat
  contrivance wherever you looked. It was Power&rsquo;s peculiar pride and
  pleasure to beautify his little room, and to sit there with any one whom he
  liked; but to give up his privacy, and let a little scapegrace like Eden have
  the free run of it, was a proposition which took him by surprise. Yet it was
  a good deal for Power&rsquo;s own sake that Walter had ventured to ask it.
  Power&rsquo;s great fault was his over-refinement; the fastidiousness which
  marred his proper influence, made him unpopular with many boys, and shut him
  up in a reserved and introspective habit of mind. By a kind of instinct,
  Walter felt that it would be good to disturb this epicurean indifference to
  the general interests of the school, and the kind of intellectualism which
  weakened the character of this attractive and affectionate, yet shy and
  self-involved boy. &ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; said Walter archly;
  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re as bad as Kenrick; you Priests and Levites won&rsquo;t
  touch my poor little wounded traveller.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see what I could do for him,&rdquo; said Power;
  &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t know what to talk to him about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, yes, you would; you don&rsquo;t know how his gratitude would pay
  you for the least interest shown in him. He&rsquo;s been so shamefully
  bullied, poor little chap, I hardly like to tell you even the things that
  that big brute Harpour has made him do. He came here bright and neat, and
  merry and innocent; and now&mdash;&rdquo; He would not finish the sentence,
  and his voice faltered; but checking himself, he added, more
  calmly&mdash;&ldquo;This, remember, has been done to the poor little fellow
  <i>here</i>, at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s; and when I remember what I might have
  been myself by this time, but for&mdash;but for one or two friends, my heart
  quite bleeds for him. Anyhow, I think one ought to do what one can for him. I
  wish I&rsquo;d a study, I know, and he shouldn&rsquo;t be the only little
  fellow who should share it. I&rsquo;ve got so much good from being able to
  learn my own lessons in Percival&rsquo;s room, that I&rsquo;d give anything
  to be able to do as much for some one else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He shall come, Walter,&rdquo; said Power, &ldquo;with all my heart.
  I&rsquo;ll ask him directly we get back to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you? I thank you. That <i>is</i> good of you; I&rsquo;m sure
  you won&rsquo;t be sorry in the long-run.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Power and Kenrick were both thinking that this new friend of theirs,
  though he had been so short a time at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, was teaching
  them some valuable lessons. Neither of them had previously recognised the
  truth which Walter seemed to feel so strongly, that they were to some extent
  directly responsible for the opportunities which they lost of helping and
  strengthening the boys around them. Neither of them had ever done anything,
  worth speaking of, to lighten the heavy burden laid on some of the little
  boys at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s; and now they heard Walter talking with
  something like remorse about a child who had no special claim whatever on his
  kindness, but whom he felt that he might more efficiently have rescued from
  evil associates, evil words, evil ways, and all the heart-misery they cannot
  fail to bring. The sense of a new mission, a neglected duty, dawned upon them
  both.</p>

  <p>They sat for a time silent, and then Kenrick, shaking off his reverie,
  pointed down the hill and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do look at those magnificent clouds; how they come surging up the
  hill in huge curving masses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Power; &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t it look like a grand
  charge of giant cavalry? Why, Walter, my dear fellow, how frightened you
  look.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;not frightened. But I say, you
  two, supposing those clouds which have gathered so suddenly don&rsquo;t clear
  away, do you think that you could find your way down the hill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I almost think so,&rdquo; said Kenrick
  dubiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Ken, I suspect you haven&rsquo;t had as much experience of
  mountain-mists as I have. We <i>may</i> find our way somehow;
  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Power, with strange calmness, &ldquo;that
  there are lots of precipices about, and that shepherds have several times
  been lost on these hills?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope that the mist will clear away, then,&rdquo; said
  Walter; &ldquo;anyhow, let&rsquo;s get on the grass, and off these awkward
  boulders, before we are surrounded.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;charges of cloud-cavalry
  are all very well in their way; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XV. &mdash; IN THE CLOUDS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE three boys scrambled with all their speed, Walter
  helping the other two down the vast primeval heap of many-tinted
  rock-fragments which form the huge summit of Appenfell, and found themselves
  again on the short slippery grass, hardened with recent frosts, that barely
  covered the wave-like sweep of the hill-side. Meanwhile, the vast dense
  masses of white cloud gathered below them, resting here and there in the
  hollows of the mountains like gigantic walls and bastions, and leaning
  against the abrupter face of the precipice in one great unbroken barrier of
  opaque, immaculate, impenetrable pearl. As you looked upon it the chief
  impression it gave you was one of immense thickness and crushing weight. It
  seemed so compressed and impermeable that one could not fancy how even a
  thunderbolt could shatter it, or the wildest blast of any hurricane dissipate
  its enormous depth. But as yet it had not enveloped the peaks themselves. On
  them the sun yet shone, and where the boys stood they were still bathed in
  the keen yet blue and sunny air, islanded far up above the noiseless billows
  of surging cloud.</p>

  <p>This was not for long. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, the clouds stole
  upon them&mdash;reached out white arms and enfolded them in sudden whirls of
  thin and smoke-like mist; eddied over their heads and round their feet;
  swathed them at last as in a funeral pall, blotting from their sight every
  object save wreaths of dank vapour, rendering wholly uncertain the direction
  in which they were moving, and giving a sense of doubt and danger to every
  step they took. Kenrick had only told the master who had given them leave of
  absence from dinner that they meant to go a long walk. He had not mentioned
  Appenfell, not from any want of straightforwardness, but because they thought
  that it might sound like a vainglorious attempt, and they did not want to
  talk about it until they had really accomplished it. But in truth if they had
  mentioned this as their destination, no wise master would have given them
  permission to go, unless they promised to be accompanied by a guide; for the
  ascent of Appenfell, dangerous even in summer to all but those who well knew
  the features of the mountain, became in winter a perilous and foolhardy
  attempt. The boys themselves, when they started on their excursion, had no
  conception of the amount or extent of the risk they ran. Seeing that the
  morning gave promises of a bright and clear day, they had never thought of
  taking into account the possibility of mists and storms.</p>

  <p>The position in which they now found themselves was enough to make a stout
  heart quail. By this time they were hopelessly enveloped in palpable clouds,
  and could not see the largest objects a yard before them. In fact, even to
  see each other they had to keep closely side by side; for once, when Kenrick
  had separated from them for a little distance, it was only by the sound of
  his shouts that they found him again. After this, they crept on in perfect
  silence, each trying to conceal from the other the terror which lay like
  frost on his own spirits; unsuccessfully, for the tremulous sound which the
  quick palpitation of their hearts gave to their breathing showed plainly
  enough that all three of them recognised the frightfulness of their
  danger.</p>

  <p>Appenfell was one of those mountains, not unfrequent, which is on one side
  abrupt and bounded by a wall of almost fathomless precipice, and on the other
  descends to the plain in a cataract of billowy undulations. It had one
  feature which, although peculiar, is by no means unprecedented. At one point,
  where the huge rock wall towers up from the ghastly depth of a broad ravine,
  there is a lateral ridge&mdash;not unlike the Mickeldore of Scawfell
  Pikes&mdash;running right across the valley, and connecting Appenfell with
  Bardlyn, another hill of much lower elevation, towards which this ridge runs
  down with a long but gradual slope. This edge was significantly called the
  Razor, and it was so narrow that it would barely admit the passage of a
  single person along its summit. It was occasionally passed by a few
  shepherds, accustomed from earliest childhood to the hills, but no ordinary
  traveller ever dreamed of braving its real dangers, for, even had the path
  been broader, the horrible depth of fall on either side was quite sufficient
  to render dizzy the steadiest head, and if a false step were taken, the
  result, to an absolute certainty, was frightful death. For so nearly
  perpendicular were the sides of this curious partition, that the narrow
  valley below, offering no temptation to any one to visit it, had not, within
  the memory of man, been trodden by any human foot. To add to the honour
  inspired by the Razor, a shepherd had recently fallen from it in a summer
  storm; his body had been abandoned as unrecoverable, and the ravens and wild
  cats had fed upon him. Something&mdash;a dim gleam of uncertain white among
  the rank grass&mdash;was yet visible from one point of the ledge, and the
  bravest mountaineer shuddered when, looking down the gloomy chasm, he
  recognised in that glimpse the mortal remains of a fellow-man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure that we are on the right path, Walter?&rdquo; asked
  Power, trying to speak as cheerfully and indifferently as he could.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; said Walter, pulling out of his pocket the little
  brass pocket-compass which had been his invariable companion in his rambles
  at home, and which he had fortunately brought with him as likely to be useful
  in the lonely tracts which surrounded Saint Winifred&rsquo;s. &ldquo;The bay
  lies due west from here, and I&rsquo;m sure of the <i>general</i>
  direction.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I think we&rsquo;re keeping too much to the right,
  Walter,&rdquo; said Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Walter, stopping; &ldquo;the truth
  is&mdash;and we may just as well be ready for it&mdash;that we&rsquo;re
  between two dangers. On the right is Bardlyn rift; on the left we have the
  sides of Appenfell, and no precipices, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking of&mdash;the old
  mines.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been keeping to the right. I think
  even in this mist we could hardly go over the rift, for I fancy that we could
  at least discover when we were getting close to it; but there are three or
  four old mines; we don&rsquo;t knew in the least where they lie exactly, and
  one might stumble over one of the shafts in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What in the world shall we do?&rdquo; said Power, stopping, as he
  realised the full intensity of peril. &ldquo;As it is we can&rsquo;t see
  where we&rsquo;re going, and very soon we shall have darkness as well as
  mist. Besides, it&rsquo;s so frightfully cold, now that we are obliged to go
  slowly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop and consider what we&rsquo;d best do,&rdquo; said
  Kenrick. &ldquo;Walter, what do <i>you</i> say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can only do one of two things. Either go on, and trust to
  God&rsquo;s mercy to keep us safe, or sit still here and hope that the mist
  may clear away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That last&rsquo;ll never do,&rdquo; answered Kenrick;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the mist rest on Appenfell for days and
  days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Power, &ldquo;unless we move on, at all
  hazards, night will be on us. A December night on Appenfell, without food or
  extra coverings, and the chance of being kept indefinitely
  longer&mdash;&rdquo; the sentence ended in a shudder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I don&rsquo;t know what we should look like in the
  morning,&rdquo; said Kenrick. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move on, at all events;
  better that than the chance of being frozen and starved to death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They moved on again a little way through the clouds with uncertain and
  hesitating steps, when suddenly Walter cried out in an agitated voice,
  &ldquo;Stop! God only knows where we are. I feel by a kind of instinct that
  we&rsquo;re somewhere near the rift. I don&rsquo;t know what else should make
  me tremble all over as I am doing; I seem to <i>hear</i> the rift somehow.
  For God&rsquo;s sake stop. Just let&rsquo;s sit down a minute till I try
  something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s now nearly four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said
  Kenrick in a querulous tone, as he halted and pulled out his watch, holding
  it close to his face to make out the time. &ldquo;An hour more and all
  daylight will be gone, and with it all chance of being saved. Surely,
  we&rsquo;d better press on. That&rsquo;s <i>uncertain</i> danger, but to stop
  is certain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certain death,&rdquo; whispered Power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just listen then, one second,&rdquo; said Walter, and, disembedding
  a huge piece of stone, he rolled it with all his force to their right,
  listening with senses acutely sharpened by danger and excitement. The stone
  bounded once, then they heard in their ears a rush, a shuffling of loose and
  sliding earth, the whirring sound of a heavy falling body, and then for
  several seconds a succession of distant crashes, startling with fright the
  rebounding mountain echoes, as the bit of rock whirled over the rift and was
  shattered into fragments by being dashed against the sides of the
  precipice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Walter, clutching both the boys and dragging
  them hurriedly backwards, &ldquo;we are standing at this moment on the very
  verge of the chasm. It won&rsquo;t do to go on; every step may be
  death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A pause of almost unspeakable horror followed his words; after the fall of
  the rock had revealed to them how frightful was the peril which they had
  escaped, all three of them for a moment felt paralysed in every limb, and
  after looking close into each other&rsquo;s faces, blanched white by a deadly
  fear, Kenrick and Power sat down in an agony of despair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give way, you fellows,&rdquo; said Walter, to whom they
  both seemed to look for help; &ldquo;our only chance is to keep up our hope
  and spirits. I think that, after all, we must just stay here till the mist
  clears up. Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Ken,&rdquo; he said, taking the
  boy&rsquo;s hand; &ldquo;nothing can happen to us but what God
  intends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the night,&rdquo; whispered Kenrick, who was most overpowered
  of the three; &ldquo;fancy a night spent here. Mist and cold, hunger and
  dark. O this horrible uncertainty and suspense. O for some light,&rdquo; he
  cried in an agony; &ldquo;I could almost die if we had but light.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O God, give us light,&rdquo; murmured Walter, echoing the words,
  and uttering aloud unconsciously his intense prayer; and then he fell on his
  knees, and the others, too, hid their faces in their hands as they stood upon
  the bleak mountainside, and prayed to Him Whom they knew to be near them,
  though they were there alone, and saw nothing save the ground they knelt
  upon, and the thick clammy fog moving slowly around and above them in aimless
  and monotonous change. To their excited imagination that fog seemed like a
  living thing; it seemed as though it were actuated with a cold and deathful
  determination, and as though it were peopled by a thousand silent spirits,
  leaning over them and chilling their hearts as they shrouded them in the
  gigantic foldings of their ghostly robes.</p>

  <p>And soon, as though their passionate prayer had been heard, and an angel
  had been sent to rend the mist, the wind, rushing up from the ravine, tore
  for itself a narrow passage&mdash;and a gleam of wavering light broke in upon
  them through the white folds of that deathful curtain, showing them the wall
  of sunken precipice, and the dark outline of Bardlyn hill. If this had been a
  moment in which they could have admired one of Nature&rsquo;s most awfully
  majestic sights, they would have gazed with enthusiastic joy on the diorama
  of valley and mountain revealed through this mighty rent in the side of their
  misty pavilion, filled up by the blue far-off sky; but at this moment of
  dominant terror they had no room for any other thoughts but how to save their
  lives from the danger that, surrounded them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Light,&rdquo; cried Walter, springing up eagerly; &ldquo;thank God!
  Perhaps the mist is going to clear away.&rdquo; But the hope was fallacious,
  for in the direction where their path lay all was still dark, and the chilly
  mist soon closed again, though not so densely, over the wound which the
  breeze from the chasm below them had momentarily made.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see that we are <i>close to the Razor</i>?&rdquo; said
  Walter, who alone of the three maintained his usual courage, because custom
  had made him more familiar with the danger of the hills. &ldquo;Now, a
  thought strikes me, Ken and Power. If you like we&rsquo;ll make an attempt to
  cross the Razor. The only thing will be not to lose one&rsquo;s footing; one
  can&rsquo;t <i>miss</i> the way, at any rate, and when once we get to Bardlyn
  it&rsquo;s as easy to get down to the road which runs round it to Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s as it is to walk across the school court.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cross the Razor?&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;why, none but some few
  shepherds ever dare to do that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, but what man has done, man can do. I&rsquo;m certain
  it&rsquo;s our best chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not for me;&rdquo; &ldquo;Or for me,&rdquo; said the other two.
  &ldquo;Well, look here,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;it would be very dangerous
  of course, but while we talk our chance of safety lessens. You two stay here.
  I&rsquo;ll try the Razor; if I get safe across I shall reach Bardlyn village
  in no time, and there I could get some men to come and help you over. Do you
  mind? I won&rsquo;t leave you if you&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Walter, Walter, don&rsquo;t run the risk,&rdquo; said Power;
  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too awful.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lighter than ever on that side,&rdquo; said Walter;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit afraid. I&rsquo;m certain we could not get safe
  down, the other way, and we should die of exposure if we spent the night
  here. Remember, we&rsquo;ve only had one or two sandwiches apiece. It&rsquo;s
  the last chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you really shan&rsquo;t, dear Walter. You don&rsquo;t know
  how terrific the Razor is. I&rsquo;ve often heard men say that they
  wouldn&rsquo;t cross it for a bag of gold,&rdquo; said Power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hinder me, Power; I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. Good-
  bye, Power; good-bye, Ken,&rdquo; he said, wringing their hands hard.
  &ldquo;If I get safe across the Razor, I shan&rsquo;t be more than an hour
  and a half at the very latest before I stand here with you again, bringing
  help. Good-bye; God bless you both. Pray for me, but don&rsquo;t
  fear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So saying, Walter tore himself away from them, and with an awful sinking
  at heart they saw him pass through the spot where the mist was thinnest, and
  plant a steady step on the commencement of the Razor path.</p>

  <h2>XVI. &mdash; ON THE RAZOR</h2>

  <p class="first">THE brave boy knew well that the fate of the others, as well
  as his own, hung on his coolness and steadiness, and stopping for one moment
  to see that he would have light enough to make sure of his footing all along
  the path, he turned round, shouted a few cheery words to his two friends, and
  stepped boldly on the ledge.</p>

  <p>He was accustomed to giddy heights, and his head had never turned as he
  looked down the cliffs at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, or the valleys at home. But
  his heart began to beat very fast with the painful sense that every step
  which he accomplished was dangerous, and that the nerve which would readily
  have borne him through a brief effort would here have to be sustained for
  fully twenty minutes, which would be the least possible time in which he
  could make the transit. The loneliness, too, was frightful; in three minutes
  he was out of sight of his friends; and to be there without a companion, in
  the very heart of the mighty mountains, traversing this haunted and terrible
  path, with not an eye to see him if he should slip and be dashed to atoms on
  the unconscious rocks&mdash;this thought almost overmastered him, unmanned
  him, filled him with a weird sense of indescribable horror. He battled
  against it with all his might, but it came on him like a foul harpy again and
  again, sickening his whole soul, making his forehead glisten with the damp
  dews of anticipated death. At last he came to a stunted willow which had
  twisted its dry roots into the thin soil, and, clinging to the stem of it
  with both arms, he was forced to stop and close his eyes, and praying for
  God&rsquo;s help, he summoned together all the faculties of his soul, and
  buffeted this ghastly intruder away so thoroughly that it did not again
  return. As a man might shoot a vulture, and look at it lying dead at his
  feet, so with the arrow of a heartfelt supplication Walter slew the hideous
  imagination that had been flapping its wings over him; nor did he stir again
  till he was sure that it had lost its power. And then, opening his eyes, he
  bore steadily and cautiously on, till all of a sudden, in the fast fading
  sunlight, something glinted white in the valley beneath his feet. In a moment
  it flashed upon him that this was the unreached skeleton a thousand feet
  below, the sight of which imparted a superstitious horror to the
  Devil&rsquo;s Way, as the peasants called the narrow path along the Razor.
  Nor was this all: for some rags of the man&rsquo;s dress, torn off by his
  headlong fall, still fluttered on a stump of blackthorn not thirty feet
  below. And now, again, the poor boy&rsquo;s heart quailed with an
  uncontrollable emotion of physical and mental fear. For a moment he tottered,
  every nerve was loosened, his legs bent under him, and, dropping down on his
  knees, he clutched the ground with both hands. It was just one of those swift
  spasms of emotion on which, in moments of peril, the crisis usually depends.
  Had Walter&rsquo;s will been weak, or his conscience a guilty one, or his
  strength feeble, or his body unstrung by ill-health, he would have succumbed
  to the sudden terror, and, fainting first, would the next instant have rolled
  over the edge to sudden and inevitable death.</p>

  <p>All these results were written before him as with fire, as he shut his
  eyes and clung with tenacious grasp to the earth. But happily his mind was
  strong, his conscience stainless, his powers vigorous, his body in pure
  health, and in a few moments, which seemed to him an age, he had recovered
  his presence of mind by one of those noble efforts which the will is ever
  ready to make for those who train it right. Before he opened his eyes he had
  braced himself into a thorough strength, and once more commending himself to
  God, he rose firm and cool to continue his journey, averting his glance from
  the spectacle of death which gleamed below.</p>

  <p>He found that his best plan was to fix his eyes rigidly on the path, and
  not suffer them to swerve for a moment to either side. Whenever he did so,
  the wavering sensation came over him again, but so long as he trod carefully
  and never let his eyes wander off the place of his footsteps, he found that
  he got along securely and even swiftly. He had only one more difficulty with
  which to contend. In one place the sort of path which the Razor presented was
  broken and crumbled away, and here Walter&rsquo;s heart again sank
  despairingly within him, as his attention was suddenly arrested by the
  additional and unexpected peril. But to turn back was now out of the
  question, and as it seemed impossible to walk for these few feet, he again
  knelt down, and crawled steadily along on hands and knees, about the length
  of two strides, until the path was hard and firm enough for him to proceed as
  before. The end was now accomplished; in five minutes more he sprang on the
  broad firm side of Bardlyn hill, and shouting aloud to relieve his spirits
  from their tumult of joy and thankfulness, he raced down Bardlyn, gained very
  quickly the mountain road, and ran at the top of his speed till, just as the
  sun was setting, he reached the group of cottages which took their name from
  the hill on which they stood.</p>

  <p>Knocking at the first cottage, he inquired for some guide or shepherd who
  was thoroughly acquainted with all the mountain paths, and was directed to
  the house of a man named Giles, who had been occupied for years among the
  neighbouring sheep-walks.</p>

  <p>Giles listened to his story with open eyes. &ldquo;Thee bi&rsquo;st coom
  over t&rsquo; Razor along Devil&rsquo;s Way,&rdquo; said he in amazement;
  &ldquo;then thee bi&rsquo;st just the plookiest young chap I&rsquo;ve seen
  for many a day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must get back over it, too, to reach them,&rdquo; said
  Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O ay; I be&rsquo;ant afear&rsquo;d of t&rsquo; Razor; I&rsquo;ve
  crossed him many a time, and I&rsquo;ll take a bit rope over and help they
  other chaps. We&rsquo;ll take a lantern, too. Don&rsquo;t you be afeared,
  sir, we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em all right,&rdquo; he said, observing how
  anxious and excited Walter seemed to be.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;quick, quick! I promised to
  come back to them at once. You shall be well paid for your
  trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;the pay&rsquo;s naught. Why,
  I&rsquo;d come if it were only a dumb sheep in danger, let alone a brace of
  lads like you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They set off with a lantern, a rope, and some food, and Giles was
  delighted at the quick and elastic step of the young mountaineer. The lantern
  they soon extinguished. It was not needed; for though the sun had now set, a
  glorious full moon had begun to pour her broad flood of silver radiance over
  the gloomy hills by the time they had reached Bardlyn rift.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no call for <i>you</i> to cross again,
  sir,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go over by myself, and look
  after the young gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, let me come, I must come!&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;The
  mist&rsquo;s quite off it now, so that it&rsquo;s just as easy under this
  moonlight as when I came; and, besides, if you take a coil of the rope in
  your hand I&rsquo;ll take hold of the other end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the right sort, and no mistake,&rdquo; said the
  man. &ldquo;God bless you for a brave young heart! And, truth tell,
  I&rsquo;ll be very glad to have ye with me, for they do say as how poor old
  Waul&rsquo;s ghost haunts about here, and it &rsquo;ud be fearsome at night.
  I know that there&rsquo;s One as keeps them as has a good conscience, but yet
  I&rsquo;ll be glad to have ye all the same.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The moonlight flung on every side the mysterious and gigantic shadows of
  rocks and hills, seeming to glimmer with a ghastly hue as it fell and
  struggled into the black depths of the untrodden rift; but habit made the
  Devil&rsquo;s Way seem nothing to the mountain shepherd, and he protected
  Walter (who twined round his wrist one end of the rope) from the danger of
  stumbling, as effectually as Walter protected him from all ghostly fears.
  When they reached the broken piece, the only difference he made was to walk
  with great caution, and plant his feet deeply into the earth, bidding Walter
  follow in the traces he made, and supporting him firmly with his hand. They
  got across in much less time than Walter had occupied in his first passage,
  and as they reached Appenfell they saw the two boys standing dimly on the
  verge of the moonlit mist, while all below them the rest of Appenfell was
  still wrapt, as in some great cerecloth, by the snowy folds of seething
  cloud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens! but who are those?&rdquo; said Walter, pointing to
  two shadowy and gigantic figures which also faced them. &ldquo;O, <i>who</i>
  are those?&rdquo; he asked wildly, and in such alarm that if the shepherd had
  not seized him firmly he must have fallen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, there&mdash;don&rsquo;t be frighted,&rdquo; said Giles;
  &ldquo;those be&rsquo;ant no ghosts, but they be just our own shadows on the
  mist. It&rsquo;s a queer thing, but I&rsquo;ve seen it often and often on
  these hills, and some scholards have told me as how that kind of thing
  be&rsquo;ant uncommon on mountains.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a goose I was to be so horribly frightened,&rdquo; said
  Walter; &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know that there were any spectres of that
  sort on Appenfell. All right, Giles; go on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Till Walter and the shepherd had taken their last step from the
  Devil&rsquo;s Way on to the side of Appenfell, the boys stood watching them
  in intense silence; but no sooner were they safe, than Power and Kenrick ran
  up to Walter, poured out their eager thanks, and pressed his hands in all the
  fervour of affectionate gratitude. They felt that his courage and readiness
  had, at the risk of his own life, saved them from such a danger as they had
  never in their lives experienced before. Already they were suffering with
  hunger and shuddering with the December air, their limbs felt quite benumbed,
  their teeth were chattering lugubriously, and their faces were blue and
  pinched with cold. They eagerly devoured the brown bread and potato-cake
  which the man had brought, and let him and Walter chafe a little life into
  their shivering-bodies. By this time fear was sufficiently removed to enable
  them to feel some sort of appreciation of the wild beauty of the scene, as
  the moonlight pierced on their left the flitting scuds of restless mist, and
  on their right fell softly over Bardlyn hill, making a weird contrast between
  the tender brightness of the places where it fell, and the pitchy gloom that
  hid the depths of the rift, and brooded in those undefined hollows over which
  the precipices leaned.</p>

  <p>To return down Appenfell was (the experienced shepherd informed them)
  quite hopeless. In such a mist as that, which might last for an indefinite
  time, even <i>he</i> would be totally unable to find his way. But now that
  they were warm and satisfied with food, and confident of safety, they even
  enjoyed the feeling of adventure when Giles tied them together for their
  return across the Devil&rsquo;s Way. First he tied the rope round his own
  waist, then round Power&rsquo;s and Kenrick&rsquo;s, and finally, as there
  was not enough left to go round Walter&rsquo;s waist, he tied the end round
  his right arm. Thus fastened, all danger was tenfold diminished, if not
  wholly removed, and the two unaccustomed boys felt a happy reliance on the
  nerve and experience of Giles and Walter, who were in front and rear. It was
  a scene which they never forgot, as the four went step by step through the
  moonlight along the horrible ledge, safe only in each other&rsquo;s help, and
  awe-struck at their position, not daring to glance aside or to watch the
  colossal grandeur of their own shadows as they were flung here and there
  against some protruding rock. Power was next to Walter, and when they reached
  the spot beneath which the whiteness glinted and the rags fluttered in the
  wind, Walter, in spite of himself, could not help glancing down, and
  whispering &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; in a voice of awe. Power unhappily did look,
  and as all the boys at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s were familiar with the story of
  the shepherd&rsquo;s fate, and had even known the man himself, Power at once
  was seized with the same nervous horror which had agitated Walter&mdash;grew
  dizzy, stumbled, and slipped down, jerking Kenrick to his knees by the sudden
  strain of the rope. Happily the rope checked Power&rsquo;s fall, and
  Kenrick&rsquo;s scream of horror startled Giles, who, without losing his
  presence of mind, instantly seized Kenrick with an arm that seemed as strong
  and inflexible as if it had been hammered out of iron, while at the same
  moment Walter, conscious of his rashness, clutched hold of Power&rsquo;s hand
  and raised him up. No word was spoken, but after this the boys kept close to
  their guides, who were ready to grasp them tight at the first indication of
  an uneven footstep, and who almost lifted them bodily over every more
  difficult or slippery part. The time seemed very long to them, but at last
  they had all reached Bardlyn hill in safety, and placed the last step they
  ever meant to place on the narrow and dizzy passage of the Razor&rsquo;s
  edge.</p>

  <p>And stopping there they looked back at the dangers they had
  passed&mdash;at Appenfell piled up to heaven with white clouds; at Bardlyn
  rift looming in black abysses beneath them; at the thin broken line of the
  Devil&rsquo;s Way. They looked:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;As a man with difficult short breath,<br>
    Forespent with toiling, &rsquo;scaped from sea to shore<br>
    Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands<br>
    At gaze.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>They stood silent till Power said, in ejaculations of intense emphasis,
  &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;&mdash;and then pointing downwards with a shudder,
  &ldquo;Oh, Walter!&rdquo; and then once again, &ldquo;Thank
  God!&rdquo;&mdash;which Walter and Kenrick echoed; and then they passed on
  without another word. But those two words, so uttered, were enough.</p>

  <p>The man, who was more than repaid by the sense that he had rendered them a
  most important aid, and who had been greatly fascinated by their <i>manly</i>
  bearing, entirely refused to take any money in payment for what he had
  done.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we poor folks are proud too, and I
  won&rsquo;t have none of your money, young gentlemen. But let me tell you
  that you&rsquo;ve had a very narrow escape of your lives out there, and I
  don&rsquo;t doubt you&rsquo;ll thank the good God for it with all your hearts
  this night; and if you&rsquo;ll just say a prayer for old Giles, too,
  he&rsquo;ll vally it more than all your monies. So now, good-night to you,
  young gentlemen, for you know your way now easy enough. And if ever you come
  this way again, maybe you&rsquo;ll come in and have a chat for remembrance
  sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Giles, that we will,&rdquo; said the boys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And since you won&rsquo;t take any money you&rsquo;ll let me give
  you this,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;You <i>must</i> let me give you this;
  it&rsquo;s not worth much, but it&rsquo;ll show you that Walter Evson
  didn&rsquo;t forget the good turn you did us.&rdquo; And he forced on the old
  shepherd&rsquo;s acceptance a handsome knife, with several strong blades,
  which he happened to have in his pocket; while Power and Kenrick, after a
  rapid whispered consultation, promised to bring him in a few days a
  first-rate plaid to serve him as a slight reminder of their gratitude for his
  ready kindness. Then they all shook hands with many thanks, and the three
  boys, eager to find sympathy in their perils and deliverance, hastened to
  Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, which they reached at eight o&rsquo;clock, just when
  their absence was beginning to cause the most serious anxiety.</p>

  <p>They arrived at the arched gateway as the boys were pouring out of evening
  chapel, and as every one was doubtfully wondering what had become of them,
  and whether they had encountered any serious mishap. When the Famulus
  admitted them, the fellows thronged round them in crowds, pouring into their
  ears a succession of eager questions. The tale of Walter&rsquo;s daring act
  flew like wildfire through the school, and if any one still retained against
  him a particle of ill-feeling, or looked on his character with suspicion, it
  was this evening replaced by the conviction that there was no more noble or
  gallant boy than Walter among them, and that if any equalled him in merit it
  was one of those whose intimate friendship for him had on this day been
  deepened by the grateful knowledge that to him, in all human probability,
  they owed their preservation from an imminent and overpowering peril. Even
  Somers, in honour of whose academic laurel the whole holiday had been given,
  and who that evening returned from Cambridge, was less of a hero than either
  of the three who had thus climbed the peak of Appenfell and braved so serious
  an adventure; far less crowned with schoolboy admiration than the young boy
  who had thrice crossed and recrossed the Devil&rsquo;s Way, and who had
  crossed it first unaided and with full knowledge of its horrors, while the
  light of winter evening was dying away, and the hills around him reeked like
  a witch&rsquo;s caldron with wintry mists.</p>

  <p>Walter, grateful as he was for each pat on the back and warm pressure of
  the hand, which told him how thoroughly and joyously his doings were
  appreciated, was not intoxicated by the enthusiasm of this boyish ovation. It
  was indeed a proud thing to stand among those four hundred schoolfellows, the
  observed of all observers, greeted on every side by happy, smiling, admiring
  faces, with every one pressing forward to give him a friendly grasp, every
  one anxious to claim or to form his acquaintance, and many addressing him
  with the kindliest greetings whose very faces he hardly knew; but the deeper
  and more silent gratitude of his chosen friends, and the manly sense of
  something bravely and rightly done, was more to him than this. Yet this was
  something very sweet. When the admiration of boys is fairly kindled it is the
  brightest, the most genial, the most generously hearty in the world. Few
  succeed in winning it; but he who has been a hero to others in manhood only,
  has had but a partial taste of the rich triumph experienced by him who has
  had the happiness in boyhood of being a hero among boys.</p>

  <p>Here let me say how one or two people noticed Walter when first they saw
  him that evening.</p>

  <p>While numbers of boys were shaking hands with him, whom he hardly saw or
  recognised in the crowd by the mingled moonlight and lamplight that streamed
  over the court where they stood, Walter felt one squeeze that he recognised
  and valued. Looking among the numerous faces, he saw that it was Henderson
  who was greeting him without a word. No nonsense or joke this time, and
  Walter noticed that the boy&rsquo;s lips were trembling with emotion, and
  that there was a light as of tears in his laughter-loving eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Henderson!&rdquo; said Walter, in that tone of real regard and
  pleasure which is the truest sign and pledge of friendship, and which no art
  can counterfeit, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to see you again: how did you and
  Dubbs get on?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Walter,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s
  gone to bed with a bad headache. Come in and see him before you go to bed. I
  know he&rsquo;d like to say good-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well done. Evson&mdash;well done indeed,&rdquo; was the remark of
  Somers, as he noticed Walter for the first time since the scene of the
  private room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excellent, my gallant little Walter,&rdquo; said Mr Percival, as he
  passed by. Mr Paton, who was with him, <i>said</i> nothing, but Walter knew
  all that he would have expressed when he caught his quiet approving smile,
  and felt his hand rest for a moment, as with the touch of Christian blessing,
  on his head.</p>

  <p>It is happiness at all times to be loved, and to deserve the love; but
  happiest of all to enjoy it after sorrow and sin. But we must escape from
  this ordeal of prosperity, of flattering words and intoxicating fumes of
  praise, as soon as we can. Who would not soon be enervated in that tropical
  and luxurious atmosphere? If it be dangerous, happily it is not often that he
  or we shall breathe its heavy sweetness, but far other are the dangers we
  shall mostly undergo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dr Lane wants you,&rdquo; said the Famulus, just in time to save
  the tired boys from their remorseless questioners. They <i>went</i> at once
  to the headmaster&rsquo;s house. He received them with a stately yet sincere
  kindness; questioned them on the occurrences of the day; warned them for the
  future against excursions so liable to accident as the winter ascent of
  Appenfell; and then spoke a few friendly words to each of them. For both
  Kenrick and Power he had a strong personal regard, and for the latter
  especially a feeling closely akin to friendship and affection. After they
  were gone he kept Walter behind, and said, &ldquo;I am indeed most sincerely
  rejoiced, Evson, to meet you again under circumstances so widely different
  from those in which I saw you last. I have heard for some time past how
  greatly you have improved, and how admirably you are now doing. I am glad to
  have the opportunity of assuring you myself how entirely you have succeeded
  in winning back my approbation and esteem.&rdquo; Walter attended with a
  glistening eye, and the master shook hands with him as he bowed and silently
  withdrew.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tea has been ordered for you in Master Power&rsquo;s study,&rdquo;
  said the footman, as they left the master&rsquo;s house.</p>

  <h2>XVII. &mdash; THE GOOD RESOLVE</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?&rdquo;</i> &mdash;Genesis chapter
    4, verse 9.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;LET&rsquo;S come and see Dubbs before tea,&rdquo;
  said Walter, on rejoining the other two. &ldquo;Henderson told me he was ill
  in bed, poor fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went at once to the cottage, detached from the rest of the school
  buildings, to which all invalids were removed, and they were allowed to go to
  Daubeny&rsquo;s room; but although he was expecting their visit he had fallen
  asleep. They noticed a worn and weary expression upon his countenance, but it
  was pleasant to look at him; for although he was a very ordinary-looking boy,
  with somewhat heavy features, yet whatever beauty can be infused into any
  face by honesty of purpose and innocence of heart, was to be found in his,
  and you could not speak to Daubeny for five minutes without being attracted
  by the sense that you were talking to one whose character was singularly free
  from falsehood or vanity, and singularly unstained by evil thoughts.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There lies one of the best and worthiest fellows in the
  school,&rdquo; whispered Power, as he raised the candle to look at him.</p>

  <p>Low as he had spoken, the sound awoke the sleeper. He opened his eyes
  dreamily at first, but with full recognition afterwards, and said, &ldquo;O,
  you fellows, I&rsquo;m so delighted to set you; when I saw Henderson last, he
  told me that you hadn&rsquo;t come back, and that people were beginning to
  fear some accident; and I suppose that&rsquo;s the reason why I&rsquo;ve been
  dreaming so uneasily, and fancying that I saw you tumbling down the rift, and
  all kinds of things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we were very near it, Dubbs, but, thanks to Walter, we
  escaped all right,&rdquo; said Power.</p>

  <p>Daubeny looked up inquiringly. &ldquo;We must tell you all about it to-
  morrow,&rdquo; said Power. &ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know; not very well, but it&rsquo;s no matter; I
  daresay I shall be all right soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, you young gentlemen,&rdquo; said the nurse;
  &ldquo;this&rsquo;ll never do; you oughtn&rsquo;t to have awoke Master
  Daubeny just as he was sleeping so nice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very sorry, nurse; good-night, Dubbs; hope you&rsquo;ll be all
  right to-morrow,&rdquo; said they, and then adjourned to Power&rsquo;s
  study.</p>

  <p>The gas was lighted in the pretty little room, and the matron, regarding
  them as heroes, had sent them a very tempting tea. They ate it almost in
  silence, for they were quite tired out. It seemed an age since they had
  started in the morning with Henderson and Daubeny. Directly tea was finished,
  Kenrick, exhausted with fatigue and excitement, fell asleep in his chair,
  with his head thrown back and his lips parted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, I think that&rsquo;s a sign that we ought to be going to
  bed,&rdquo; said Walter, laughing as he pointed at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O no,&rdquo; said Power, &ldquo;not yet; it&rsquo;s so jolly
  sitting here; don&rsquo;t wake him, but come and draw your chair next to mine
  by the fire and have a chat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter obeyed the invitation, and for a few minutes they both sat gazing
  into the fire, reading faces in the embers, and pursuing their own thoughts.
  Each of them was happy in the other&rsquo;s presence; and Walter, though more
  than a year Power&rsquo;s junior, and far below him in the school, was
  delighted with the sense of fully possessing, in the friendship of this most
  promising and gifted boy, a treasure which any one in the world might well
  have envied him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a strange day, hasn&rsquo;t it, Walter?&rdquo; said
  Power at last, laying his hand on Walter&rsquo;s, and looking at him.
  &ldquo;I shall never forget it; you have thrown a new light on one&rsquo;s
  time here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have I, Power? How? I didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, on the top of Appenfell there, you opened my eyes to the fact
  that I&rsquo;ve been living here a very selfish life. I know that I get the
  credit of being very conceited and exclusive, and all that sort of thing; but
  being naturally shy, I thought it better to keep rather aloof from all but
  the very few towards whom I felt at all drawn. I see now,&rdquo; he said
  sadly, &ldquo;that at the bottom this was mainly selfishness. Why, Walter,
  all the time I&rsquo;ve been here, I haven&rsquo;t done as much for any
  single boy as you, a new fellow, have done for little Eden this one
  half-year. But there&rsquo;s time to do better yet; and by God&rsquo;s help
  I&rsquo;ll try. I&rsquo;ll give Eden the run of my study to-morrow; and as
  there&rsquo;s plenty of room, I&rsquo;ll look out for some other little chap
  who requires a refuge for the destitute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, for Eden&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Walter;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll soon begin to like him, if he gets at home
  with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rdquo; continued Power; &ldquo;so
  few ever do get at home with me. I suppose my manner&rsquo;s awkward&mdash;or
  something; but I&rsquo;d give anything to make fellows friendly in five
  minutes as you do. How do you manage it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know; I never think about my own manner or
  anything else. I suppose if one feels the least interest in any fellow, that
  he will probably feel some interest in me; and so, somehow, I&rsquo;m on the
  best terms with all I care to know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Ken and I had a long talk after you left us, to cross the
  Devil&rsquo;s Way; and I hope that the memory of that may make us three
  friends firm and fast, tender and true, as long as we live. We were in a
  horrible fright about you, and I suppose that, joined to our own danger, gave
  a solemn cast to our conversation; but we agreed that if we three, as
  friends, were united in the silent resolution to help others, and especially
  new fellows and young, as much as ever we can, we might do a great deal. Tell
  me, Walter, didn&rsquo;t you find it a very hard thing when you first came,
  to keep right among All sorts of temptations?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, Power, very hard; and I confess, too, that I sometimes
  wondered that not one boy, though there are, as I see now, lots of thoroughly
  good and right fellows here, ever said one word, or did one thing to help
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all wrong, all wrong,&rdquo; said Power; &ldquo;but it
  was you first who made me see it. Walter, I shall pray to-night that God, Who
  has kept us safe, may teach and help us here to live less for ourselves. Who
  knows what we might not do for the school?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both sat for a short time in thoughtful silence. Boys do not often
  talk openly together about prayer or religion, though perhaps they do so even
  more than men do in common life. It is right and well that it should be so;
  it would be unnatural and certainly harmful were it otherwise. And these boys
  would probably never have talked to each other thus, if a common danger had
  not broken down completely the barriers of conventional reserve. Never again
  from this day did they allude to this sacred resolution; but they acted up to
  it, or strove to do so, not indeed unwaveringly, yet with manful courage, in
  the strength of that pure, strong, beautiful unity of heart and purpose which
  this day had cemented between them for the rest of their school-life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you seem to aim higher than I do, Power,&rdquo; said Walter;
  &ldquo;I certainly found lots of wickedness going on here, but I never hoped
  to change that. All I hoped to do was to save one or two fellows from being
  cruelly bullied and spoiled. We can&rsquo;t alter the wrong tone which nearly
  all the fellows have on some matters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Power, &ldquo;there was once a man, a single man,
  in a great corrupted host, who stood between the living and the dead, and the
  plague was stayed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then rose up Phinees and prayed, and so the plague ceased,&rdquo;
  whispered Walter to himself.</p>

  <p>All farther conversation was broken by Kenrick, who at this moment awoke
  with a great yawn, and looking at his watch, declared that they ought to have
  been in bed long ago.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, Ken; I hope we shall sleep as sound as you,&rdquo; said
  Power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walter here will dream of skeletons and moonlit precipices, I
  bet,&rdquo; said Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not I, Ken; I&rsquo;m far too tired. Good-night, both.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sleepy as they were, <i>two</i> of those boys did not fall asleep that
  night till they had poured out with all the passion of full hearts, words of
  earnest supplication for the future, of trembling gratitude for the past. Two
  of them&mdash;for Kenrick, with all the fine points of his character, was
  entirely destitute of any sense of religion, and had in many points the
  standard of a schoolboy rather than that of a Christian.</p>

  <p>When Walter reached his room, the rest were asleep, but not Eden. He sat
  up in his bed directly Walter entered, and his eyes were sparkling with
  animation and pleasure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go to sleep for
  joy; Every one&rsquo;s praising you to the skies. I am so proud of you, and
  it is so very good of you to be friends with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tush, Arty,&rdquo; said Walter smiling; &ldquo;one would think
  I&rsquo;d done something great to hear you talk, whereas really it was
  nothing out of the way. I meant to have taken you with us, but I thought it
  would be too far for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Taken me with you, and Kenrick, and Power!&rdquo; said Eden,
  opening his large eyes; &ldquo;how kind of you, Walter! but only fancy Power
  or Kenrick walking with me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not, Arty? Power&rsquo;s going to ask you to-morrow to sit in
  his study, and learn your lessons there whenever you like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Power ask <i>me</i>!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You! Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s <i>such</i> a swell.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, you must try and be a swell too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Walter; I&rsquo;m doing ten times as well as I did, but I
  shall never be a swell like Power,&rdquo; said the child simply. &ldquo;And I
  know it&rsquo;s all your doing, not his. O, how shall I ever learn to thank
  and pay you for all you do for me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By being a good and brave little boy, Arty. Good-night, and God
  bless you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XVIII. &mdash; THE MARTYR-STUDENT</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Impositique rogis juvenes ante ora parentum.</i><br>
    &mdash;Georgic Four, 1 71.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">THE days that followed, as the boys resumed the regular
  routine of school work, passed by very rapidly and pleasantly&mdash;rapidly,
  because the long-expected Christmas holidays were approaching; pleasantly,
  because the boys were thoroughly occupied in working up the subjects for the
  final examination. For Walter especially, those days were lighted up with the
  warm glow of popularity and success. He was aiming with boyish eagerness to
  win one more laurel by gaining the first place in his form, and whenever he
  was not taking exercise, either in some school game or by a ramble along his
  favourite cliffs and sands, he was generally to be found hard at work in Mr
  Percival&rsquo;s rooms, learning the voluntary repetitions, or going over the
  trial subjects with Henderson, who had now quite passed the boundary line
  which separated the idle from the industrious boys.</p>

  <p>One morning Henderson came in chuckling and laughing to himself. &ldquo;So
  Power&rsquo;s taking a leaf out of your book, Walter. I declare he&rsquo;s
  becoming a regular sociable grosbeak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sociable grosbeak? what <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t you know that I&rsquo;m writing a drama called the
  &lsquo;Sociable Grosbeaks,&rsquo; in which you and Ken and I are introduced?
  I didn&rsquo;t mean to introduce Power, he wasn&rsquo;t gregarious enough;
  but I <i>shall</i> now, and he shall prologise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why is he more sociable now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s actually let one of the&mdash;oh, I forgot, I
  mustn&rsquo;t call names&mdash;well, he&rsquo;s given Eden the run of his
  study.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O yes; I knew that,&rdquo; said Walter smiling. &ldquo;At first, it
  was the funniest thing to see them together, they were both so shy; but after
  a day or two they were quite friends, and now you may find Eden perched any
  day in Power&rsquo;s window-seat, grinding away at his Greek verbs, and as
  happy as a king. Power helps him in his work, too. It&rsquo;ll be the making
  of the little fellow. Already he&rsquo;s coming out strong in
  form.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the grosbeaks,&rdquo; said Henderson. &ldquo;I
  <i>did</i> mean to chaff Power about it, but I won&rsquo;t, for it really is
  very kind of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and so it is of Percival to let us sit here; but I wish that
  dear old Dubbs could be doing trial-work here with us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very ill,&rdquo; said Henderson, looking serious;
  &ldquo;<i>very</i> ill, I&rsquo;m afraid. I saw him to-day for a minute, but
  he seemed too weak to talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he? poor fellow! I knew that he was staying out, but I&rsquo;d
  no notion that it was anything dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about <i>dangerous</i>, but he&rsquo;s quite
  ill. Poor Daubeny! you know how very very patient and good he is, yet even he
  can&rsquo;t help being sad at falling ill just now. You know he was to have
  been confirmed to-morrow week, and he&rsquo;s afraid that now he won&rsquo;t
  be well enough, and will have to put it off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s mentioned his confirmation to me several times.
  Lots of fellows are going to be confirmed this time&mdash;about a hundred, I
  believe&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t suppose one of them thinks of it so solemnly
  as dear old Dubbs&mdash;unless, indeed, it&rsquo;s Power, who also is to be
  confirmed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The confirmation was to take place on a Sunday, and the candidates had
  long been engaged in a course of preparation. The intellectual preparation
  was carefully undertaken by Dr Lane and the tutors of the boys; but this
  answer of the lips was of comparatively little value, except in so far as it
  tended to guide, and solemnise, and concentrate the preparation of the heart.
  In too many this approaching responsibility produced no visible effect in the
  tenor of outward life&mdash;they talked and thought as lightly as before, and
  did not elevate the low standard of schoolboy morality; but there were
  <i>some</i> hearts in which the dreary and formless chaos of passion and
  neglect then first felt the divine stirring of the brooding wings, and some
  spiritual temples were from that time filled more brightly than before with
  the Shechinah of the Presence, and bore, as in golden letters on a new
  entablature, the inscription, &ldquo;Holiness to the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To this confirmation some of the best boys, like Power and Daubeny, were
  looking forward, not with any exaggerated or romantic sentimentality, but
  with a deep humility, a manly exultation, an earnest hope. They were ready
  and even anxious to confirm their baptismal vow, and to be confirmed in the
  sacred strength which should enable them for the future more unswervingly to
  fulfil it. Of these young hearts the grace of God took early hold, and in
  them reason and religion ran together like warp and woof to frame the web of
  a sweet and exemplary life. Bound by the most solemn and public recognition
  of, and adhesion to, their Christian duty, it would be easier for them
  thenceforth to confess Christ before men&mdash;easier to do justice, and to
  love mercy, and to walk humbly with their God.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think it would be possible to see Dubbs? I should so like to
  see him,&rdquo; said Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask Percival, he&rsquo;s in the next room; and if Dubbs
  is well enough I know he&rsquo;d give anything to see you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; said Walter, after knocking for admission at
  the door of the inner room, &ldquo;do you think that Henderson and I might go
  to the cottage and see Daubeny?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Walter. But I want very much to see him myself,
  if Dr Keith will let me, so I&rsquo;ll come with you and enquire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Percival walked with the two boys to the cottage, and, after an
  injunction not to stay too long, they were admitted to the sick boy&rsquo;s
  bedside. At first, in the darkened room, they saw nothing; but
  Daubeny&rsquo;s voice&mdash;weak and low, but very cheerful&mdash;at once
  greeted them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, thank you, sir, for coming to see me. Hallo! Walter, and Flip,
  too; I&rsquo;m so glad to see you&mdash;you in a sickroom again,
  Flip!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We would have come before if we had known that we might see
  you,&rdquo; said the master. &ldquo;How are you feeling, my dear
  boy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not very well, sir; my head aches sadly sometimes, and I get so
  confused.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Daubeny, it&rsquo;s the overwork. Didn&rsquo;t I entreat you,
  my child, to slacken the bent bow a little? You&rsquo;ll be wiser in future,
  will you not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In future&mdash;O yes, sir; if ever I get well, I&rsquo;m
  afraid,&rdquo; he said, with a faint smile, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ll find me
  stupider than ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stupid, my boy! none of us ever thought you that. It is not the
  stupid boys that get head removes as you have done the last term or two. I
  should very much enjoy a talk with you, Daubeny, but I mustn&rsquo;t stay now
  the doctor says, so I&rsquo;ll leave these two fellows with you, and give
  them ten minutes&mdash;no longer&mdash;to tell you all the school
  news.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In future wiser&mdash;in future,&rdquo; repeated Daubeny in a low
  voice to himself once or twice; &ldquo;ah, yes, too late now. I don&rsquo;t
  think he knows how ill I am, Walter. My mother&rsquo;s been sent for; I
  expect her this evening. I shall at least live to see her again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Henderson, whose quick and sensitive
  nature was easily excited; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk like that, Daubeny; we
  can&rsquo;t spare you; you must stay for our sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear old fellow,&rdquo; said Daubeny, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have
  nobody left to chaff; but you can spare me easily enough,&rdquo; and he laid
  his fevered hand kindly on Henderson&rsquo;s, who immediately turned his head
  and brushed away a tear. &ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he added, in a
  pained tone of voice, &ldquo;I never meant to make you cry. I&rsquo;m quite
  happy, Flip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Daubeny! we can&rsquo;t get on without you!&rdquo; said
  Henderson.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daubeny! I hardly know the name,&rdquo; said the sick boy, smiling.
  &ldquo;No, Flip, let it be Dubbs, as of old&mdash;a nice heavy name to suit
  its owner; and you gave it me, you know, so it&rsquo;s your property, Flip,
  and I hardly know myself by any other now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Dubbs, I&rsquo;ve plagued you so,&rdquo; said Henderson, sobbing
  as if his heart would break; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done anything but teaze
  you, and laugh at you, and you&rsquo;ve always been so good and so patient to
  me. Do forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Daubeny, trying to rally him. &ldquo;Listen to
  him, Walter; who&rsquo;d think that Flip was talking? Teased me, Flip?&rdquo;
  he continued, as Henderson still sobbed at intervals, &ldquo;not you! I
  always enjoyed your chaff, and I knew that you liked me at heart.
  You&rsquo;ve all been very kind to me. Walter, I&rsquo;m so glad I got to
  know you before I&mdash;. It&rsquo;s so pleasant to see you here. Give me
  your hand; no, Flip, let me keep yours too; it&rsquo;s getting dark. I like
  to have you here. I feel so happy. I wish Power and Ken would come too, that
  I might see all my friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-night, Daubeny; I can&rsquo;t stay, I mustn&rsquo;t
  stay,&rdquo; said Henderson; and, pressing his friend&rsquo;s hand, he
  hurried out of the room to indulge in a burst of grief which he could not
  contain; for, under his trifling and nonsensical manner, Henderson had a very
  warm and susceptible and feeling heart, and though he had always made Daubeny
  a subject of ridicule, he never did it with a particle of ill-nature, and
  felt for him&mdash;dissimilar as their characters were&mdash;a most fervent
  and deep regard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look after him when I am gone, Walter,&rdquo; said Daubeny sadly,
  when he had left the room. &ldquo;He is a dear good fellow, but so easily
  led. Poor Flip; he&rsquo;s immensely changed for the better since you came,
  Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have been very fond of him all along,&rdquo; said Walter;
  &ldquo;he is so full of laughter and fun, and he&rsquo;s very good with it
  all. But, Dubbs, you are too desponding; we shall have you here yet for many
  pleasant days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; perhaps so, if God wills. I am very young. I
  should like to stay a little longer in the sunshine. Walter, I should like to
  stay with <i>you</i>. I love you more, I think, than any one except
  Power,&rdquo; and as he spoke, a quiet tear rolled slowly down
  Daubeny&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>Walter only pressed his hand. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think how I pitied
  you, Walter, in that accident about Paton&rsquo;s manuscript. When all the
  fellows were cutting you, and abusing you, my heart used to bleed for you;
  you used to go about looking so miserable, so much as if all your chances of
  life were over. I&rsquo;m afraid I did very little for you then, but I
  <i>would</i> have done anything. I felt as if I could have given you my
  right-hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Dubbs, you were the first who spoke to me after that happened,
  the first who wasn&rsquo;t ashamed to walk with me. You can&rsquo;t think how
  grateful I felt to you for it; it rolled a cold weight from me. It was like
  stretching a saving hand to one who was drowning; for every one knew how good
  a fellow <i>you</i> were, and your countenance was worth everything to me
  just then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You really felt so?&rdquo; said Daubeny, brightening up, while a
  faint flush rested for a moment on his pale face; &ldquo;O Walter, it makes
  me happy to hear you say so.&rdquo; There was a silence, and, with
  Walter&rsquo;s hand still in his, he fell into a sweet sleep, with a smile
  upon his face. When he was quite asleep, Walter gently removed his hand,
  smoothed his pillow, looked affectionately at him for a moment, and stole
  silently from the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How did you leave him?&rdquo; asked Henderson eagerly, when Walter
  rejoined him in Mr Percival&rsquo;s room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sleeping soundly. I hope it will do him good. I did not know how
  much you cared for him, Flip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I always made him a butt,&rdquo; said
  Henderson, remorsefully; &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t really think he minded it,
  or I wouldn&rsquo;t have done so. I hardly knew myself that I liked him so.
  It was a confounded shame of me to worry him as I was always doing. Conceited
  donkey that I was, I was always trying to make him seem stupid; yet all the
  while I could have stood by him cap in hand. O Walter, I hope he is not going
  to die!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O no, I hope not; and don&rsquo;t be miserable at the thought of
  teasing him, Flip; it was all in fun, and he was never wounded by any word of
  yours. Remember how he used to tell you that he was all the time laughing at
  you, not you at him. Come a turn on the shore, and let&rsquo;s take Power or
  Ken with us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sociable grosbeaks, again,&rdquo; said Henderson, laughing in the
  midst of his sorrow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;never mind. There are but few birds
  of the sort after all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They found Eden with his feet up, and his hands round his knees, on the
  window-seat, perfectly at his ease, and chattering to Power like a young
  jackdaw. A thrill of pleasure passed through Walter&rsquo;s heart as a glance
  showed him how well his proposal had succeeded. Power evidently had had no
  reason to repent of his kindness, and Eden looked more like the bright and
  happy child which he had once been, than ever was the case since he had come
  to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s. He was now clean and neat in dress, and the
  shadows of fear and guilt which had begun to darken his young face were
  chased away.</p>

  <p>Power readily joined them in their stroll along the shore, and listened
  with affectionate sympathy to their account of Daubeny.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it that has made him ill?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about that,&rdquo; answered Walter;
  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s overwork which has brought on a tendency to brain
  fever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was afraid so, Walter,&rdquo; and then Power repeated half to
  himself the fine lines of Byron on Kirke White&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;So the struck eagle stretched upon the plain,<br>
    No more through rolling clouds to soar again,<br>
    Viewed his own feather on the fatal dart,<br>
    And winged the barb that quivered in his heart;<br>
    Keen were his pangs, but keener far to feel.<br>
    He nursed the pinion that impelled the steel;<br>
    While the same plumage that had warmed his nest,<br>
    Drank the last life blood of his bleeding breast.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;What grand verses!&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;Poor, poor
  Daubeny!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had but one feeling about him myself,&rdquo; said
  Power, &ldquo;and that was a feeling almost like reverence. I hope and trust
  that he&rsquo;ll be well enough for to-morrow week. I always looked forward
  to kneeling next to him when we were confirmed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All, you loved him, Power,&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;because
  your tastes were like his. But I owe a great deal to him&mdash;more than I
  can ever tell you. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I could tell you now, while he
  lies there so ill, poor fellow. He has saved me more than once from vigorous
  efforts to throw myself away. But for him I should have gone to the devil
  long, long ago. I was <i>very</i> near it once.&rdquo; He sighed, and as they
  walked by the violet margent of the evening waves, he offered up in silence
  an earnest prayer that Daubeny might live.</p>

  <p>The blind old poet would have said that the winds carried the prayer away
  and scattered it. But no winds can scatter, no waves can drown, the immortal
  spirit of one true prayer. Unanswered it <i>may</i> be&mdash;but scattered
  and fruitless, <i>not</i>!</p>

    &mdash;Longfellow&rsquo;s Golden Legend.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I&rsquo;VE got a good piece of news for you, Master
  Daubeny,&rdquo; said the kind old school-nurse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it? is my mother here?&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;O!
  let her come and see me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was at the door, and the next moment his arms were round her neck in a
  long embrace. &ldquo;Darling, darling mother,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;now
  I shall be happy, now that you have come. Nay, you mustn&rsquo;t cry,
  mother,&rdquo; he said, as he felt one of her fast flowing tears upon his
  forehead; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve come to help me in bearing up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dearest Johnny,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I trust yet that God will
  spare the widow&rsquo;s only son; He Who raised the son of the widow of Nain
  will pity us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His ways are not ours, mother dear; I do not think that I shall
  recover. My past life hangs before me like a far-off picture already; I lie
  and look at it almost as if it were not mine, and my mind is quite at peace;
  only sometimes my head is all confused.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done, Johnny,&rdquo; sobbed the poor lady.
  &ldquo;But I do not think I can live, if you be taken from me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Taken&mdash;but not for ever, mother,&rdquo; he said, looking up
  into her face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Johnny, <i>why, why</i> did you not spare yourself, and work
  less? It is the work which has killed you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only because it fell heavier on me than on other boys. They got
  through it quickly, but I was not so clever, and it cost me more to do my
  duty. I tried to do it, mother dear, and God helped me. All is well as it is.
  O my head, my head!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must rest, darling. My visit and talk has excited you. Try to
  go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then sit there, mother, opposite me, so that I may see you when I
  wake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She kissed his aching brow, and sat down, while he composed himself to
  rest. She was a lady of about fifty, with bands of silver hair smoothed over
  her calm forehead, and in appearance not unlike her son. But there was
  something very sweet and matronly about her look, and it was impossible to
  see her without feeling the respect and honour which was her due.</p>

  <p>And she sat there, by the bedside, looking upon her only son, the boy who
  had been the light of her life; and she knew that he was dying&mdash;she knew
  that he was fading away before her eyes. Yet there was a sweet and noble
  resignation in her anguish; there was a deep and genuine spirit of submission
  to the will of heaven, and a perfect faith in God&rsquo;s love, whatever
  might be the issue, in every prayer she breathed, as with clasped hands, and
  streaming eyes, and moving lips, she gazed upon his face. He might appear
  dull and heavy to others, but to her he was dear beyond all thought; and now
  she was to lose him. In her inmost heart she knew that she <i>must</i> suffer
  that great pang; that God was taking to Himself the son who had been so good
  and true to her, so affectionate, so sweet-tempered, so unselfish, that even
  from his gentle and quiet infancy he had never by his conduct caused her a
  moment&rsquo;s pain. She had long been looking forward to the strong and
  upright manhood which should follow this pure boyhood; but that dear boy was
  not destined to be the staff of her declining years; <i>her</i> hands were to
  close his eyes in the last long sleep, and she was to pass alone under the
  overshadowing rocks that close around the valley of human life. God help the
  mother&rsquo;s heart who must pass through scenes like this!</p>

  <p>Poor Daubeny could not sleep. Brain fever is usually accompanied by
  delirium, and as he turned restlessly upon his pillow, his mind began to
  wander away to other days and scenes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stupid, sir? yes, I know I am, but I can&rsquo;t help it;
  I&rsquo;ve really done my best. I was up at five o&rsquo;clock this morning,
  trying, trying so hard to learn this repetition. Indeed, indeed, I&rsquo;m
  not idle, sir. I&rsquo;ll try to do my duty if I can. O Power, I wish I were
  like you; you learn so quickly, and you never get abused as I do after it
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then the poor boy fancied himself sitting under the gas-lamp in the
  passage as he had so often done, and trying to master one of his repetition
  lessons, repeating the lines fast to himself as he used to do&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hac arte Pollux et vagus Hercules,<br>
    Enisus&mdash;enisus arces&mdash;enisus arces attigit igneas,<br>
    Quos inter Augustus&mdash;&rsquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;How <i>does</i> it go on?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hac arte Pollux et vagus Hercules,<br>
    Enisus arces attigit igneas, attigit igneas,<br>
    Quos inter Augustus recumbens&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what <i>does</i> come next?&rdquo; and he stopped with an
  expression of pain on his face, pressing his hands tight over his brow.
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go on with the repetition, Johnny, dear,&rdquo; said the
  poor mother. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you know it enough now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, no! not yet, mother; I shall be turned, I know I shall to-
  morrow, and it makes him so angry; he&rsquo;ll call me idle and incorrigible,
  and all kinds of things.&rdquo; And then he began again&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sed quid Typhoeus aut validus Mimas,<br>
    Aut quid minaci Porphyrion statu,<br>
    Quid Rhoetus&mdash;Rhoetus&mdash;quid Rhoetus&mdash;&rsquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall break down here, I know I shall,&rdquo; and he burst
  into tears. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good trying to help me, Power, I
  <i>can&rsquo;t</i> learn it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leave off for to-night at least, Johnny,&rdquo; said his mother, in
  a tone of anguish; &ldquo;you can learn the rest to-morrow. Oh, what shall I
  do?&rdquo; she asked, turning to the nurse; &ldquo;I cannot bear to hear him
  go on like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be comforted, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the nurse, wiping away her
  own tears. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dear good lamb, and he&rsquo;ll come to
  hisself soon afore he goes off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Must</i> he die, then?&rdquo; she asked, trembling in every
  limb.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, good lady! we never know what God may please to do in His
  mercy. We must bow to His gracious will, ma&rsquo;am, as you knows well, I
  don&rsquo;t doubt. He&rsquo;s fitter to die than many a grown man is, poor
  child, and that&rsquo;s a blessing. I wish though he wasn&rsquo;t a repeating
  of that there heathenish Latin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Daubeny&rsquo;s voice was still humming fragments of Horace lines,
  sometimes with eager concentration, and then with pauses at parts where his
  memory failed, at which he would grow distressed and anxious&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quid Rhoetus... quid Rhoetus evulsisque truncis,
  Enceladus.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I <i>cannot</i> learn this; I think I&rsquo;m getting more
  stupid every day. Enceladus&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you love me, Johnny, give it up for to-night, that&rsquo;s a
  darling boy,&rdquo; said his mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, mother, it&rsquo;s my <i>duty</i> to know it; you
  wouldn&rsquo;t have me fail in duty, mother dear, would you? Why, it was you
  who told me to persevere, and do all things with my might. Well, I will leave
  it for to-night.&rdquo; Then, still unconscious of what he was doing, the boy
  got up and prayed, as it was evident that he <i>had</i> done many a time,
  that God would strengthen his memory and quicken his powers, and enable him
  to do his duty like a man. It was inexpressibly touching to see him as he
  knelt there&mdash;thin, pale, emaciated, the shadow of his former self,
  kneeling in his delirium to offer up his old accustomed prayer.</p>

  <p>And when he got into bed again, although his mind still wandered, he was
  much calmer, and a new direction seemed to have been given to his thoughts.
  The prayer had fallen like dew on his aching soul. He fancied himself in
  Power&rsquo;s study, where for many a Sunday the two boys had been used to
  sit, and where they had often learnt or read to each other their favourite
  hymns. Fragments of these hymns he was now repeating, dwelling on the words
  with an evident sense of pleasure and belief&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;A noble army&mdash;men and boys,<br>
    The matron and the maid,<br>
    Around the Saviour&rsquo;s throne rejoice,<br>
    In robes of light arrayed.<br>
    They climbed the steep ascent of heaven,<br>
    &rsquo;Mid peril, toil, and pain;<br>
    O God, to us may strength be given,<br>
    To follow in their train.&rsquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that beautiful, Power?</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;And when on upward wing.<br>
    Cleaving the sky,<br>
    Sun, moon, and stars forgot,<br>
    Upwards I fly;<br>
    Still all my song shall be,<br>
    Nearer, my God, to Thee,<br>
    Nearer to Thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And as he murmured to himself in a soothed tone of voice these verses, and
  lines of &ldquo;Jerusalem the Golden,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O for a closer walk
  with God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rock of Ages,&rdquo; the wearied brain at last
  found repose, and Daubeny fell asleep.</p>

  <p>He lingered on till the end of the week. On the Saturday he ceased to be
  delirious, and the lucid interval began which precedes death. It was then
  that he earnestly entreated to be allowed to see those school friends whose
  names had been so often on his lips&mdash;Power, Walter, and Henderson. The
  boys, who had daily and eagerly inquired for him, entered with a feeling of
  trembling solemnity the room of sickness. The near presence of death filled
  them with an indescribable awe, and they felt desolate at the approaching
  loss of a friend whom they loved so well.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I sent to say good-bye,&rdquo; he said, smiling sweetly. &ldquo;You
  must not cry and grieve for me. I am happier than I ever felt before.
  Good-bye, Walter. It&rsquo;s for a long, long, long time, but not for ever.
  Good-bye, my dear old Flip&mdash;naughty fellow to cry so, when I am happy;
  and when I am gone, Flip, think of me sometimes, and of talks we&rsquo;ve had
  together, and take your side manfully for God and Christ. Good-bye, Power,
  my best friend; we meant to be confirmed together, you know, but God has
  ordered it otherwise.&rdquo; And then he whispered low&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lord shall we come? come yet again?<br>
    Thy children ask one blessing more;<br>
    To come not now alone, but then<br>
    When life, and death, and time are o&rsquo;er;<br>
    Then, then, to come, O Lord, and be<br>
    Confirmed in heaven&mdash;confirmed by Thee.&rsquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;O Power, that line fills me with hope and joy; think of it for me
  when I am dead,&rdquo; and his voice trembled with emotion as he again
  murmured, &ldquo;&lsquo;Confirmed in heaven&mdash;confirmed by Thee.&rsquo;
  I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m too weak to talk any more. O, what a long, long
  good-bye it will be&mdash;for years, and years, and years; to think that
  when you have gone out of the room we shall never meet in life again, and I
  shall never hear your pleasant voices. O Flip, you make me cry against my
  will by crying so. It&rsquo;s hard to say, but it must be said at last.
  Good-bye, God bless you, with all my heart.&rdquo; He laid his hand on their
  heads as they bent over him, and once mere whispering the last
  &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; turned away his face, and made the pillow wet with
  his warm tears.</p>

  <p>The sound of his mother&rsquo;s sobs attracted him. &ldquo;Ah, mother,
  darling, we are alone now; you will stay with me till I die. I am
  tired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I feared that their visit would excite you too much, my
  child.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O no, mother; I couldn&rsquo;t bear to die without seeing them, I
  loved them so much. Mother, will you sing to me a <i>little</i>&mdash;sing me
  my favourite hymn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She began in a low, sweet voice,&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;My God, my Father, while I stray,<br>
    Far from my home in life&rsquo;s rough way,<br>
    O teach me from my heart to say,<br>
    Thy will be done,<br>
    Thy will be&mdash;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>She stopped, for sobs choked her voice. &ldquo;I am sorry I cannot,
  Johnny. But I cannot bear to think how soon we must part.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only for a short time, mother, a short time. I said a long time
  just now, but <i>now</i> it looks to me quite short, and I shall be with God.
  I see it all now so clearly. Do you remember those lines&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;The soul&rsquo;s dark cottage, battered and decayed,<br>
    Lets in new light through chinks that time has made.&rsquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;How true they are! Oh, darling mother, how very, very good you have
  always been to me, and I pay you with all my heart&rsquo;s whole love.&rdquo;
  He pressed upon her lips a long, long kiss, and said, &ldquo;Good-night,
  darling mother. I am falling asleep, I think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His arms relaxed their loving embrace, and glided down from her shoulder;
  his head fell back; the light faded from his soft and gentle eyes, and he was
  asleep.</p>

  <p>Rightly he said &ldquo;asleep&rdquo;&mdash;the long sleep that is the
  sweetest and happiest in that it knows no waking here; the long sweet sleep
  that no evil dreams disturb; the sleep after which the eyes open upon the
  light of immortality, and the weary heart rests upon the bosom of its God.
  Yes, Daubeny had fallen asleep.</p>

  <p>God help thee, widowed mother; the daily endearments, the looks of living
  affection, the light of the boy&rsquo;s presence, are for thee and for thy
  home no more. There lies the human body of thy son; his soul is with the
  white-robed, redeemed, innumerable multitude in the Paradise of God.</p>

  <p>For hours, till the light faded into darkness, as this young life had
  faded into death, she sat fixed in that deep grief which finds no utterance,
  and knows of no alleviation, with little consciousness save of the dead
  presence, and of the pang that benumbed her aching heart. And outside rang
  the sound of games and health, and the murmur of boy-voices came to her
  forlorn ear. There the stream of life was flashing joyously and gloriously in
  the sunshine, while here, in this darkened room, it had sunk into the sands,
  and lost itself under the shadow of the dark boughs. But she was a Christian;
  and as the sweet voices of memory, and conscience, and hope, and promise
  whispered to her in her loneliness their angel messages, her heart melted and
  the tears came, and she knelt down and took the dead hand of her son in hers,
  and said, between her sobs, while her tear-stained eyes were turned to
  heaven, &ldquo;O God, teach me to understand Thy will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And through the night the great bell of the church of Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s tolled the sound of death; and, mingled with it stroke for
  stroke, in long, tremulous, thrilling notes that echoed through the silent
  buildings, rang out the thin clear bell of Saint Winifred&rsquo;s School. The
  tones of that school-bell were usually only heard as they summoned the boys
  to lessons with quick and hurried beatings. How different now were the slow
  occasional notes&mdash;each note trembling itself out with undisturbed
  vibrations which quivered long upon the air&mdash;with which it told that for
  one at least whom it had been wont to warn, hurry was possible no longer, and
  there was boundless leisure now! There was a strange pulse of emotion in the
  hearts of the listening boys, when the sound of those two passing bells
  struck upon their ears as they sat at evening work, and told them that the
  soul of their schoolfellow had passed away, and that God&rsquo;s voice had
  summoned His young servant to His side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You hear it, Henderson?&rdquo; said Walter, who sat next to
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Henderson in an awe-struck voice,
  &ldquo;Daubeny is dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The rest of that evening the two boys sat silent and motionless, full of
  the solemn thoughts which can never be forgotten. And for the rest of that
  evening the deep church-bell tolled, and the shrill school-bell tolling after
  it, shivered out into the wintry night air its tremulous message that the
  soul of Daubeny had passed away.</p>

  <h2>XX. &mdash; FAREWELL</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Be the day weary or be the day long<br>
    At last it ringeth to even-song.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">THERE was a very serious look on the faces of all the boys
  as they thronged into chapel the next morning for the confirmation service.
  It was a beautiful sight to see the subdued yet noble air, full at once of
  humility and hope, wherewith many of the youthful candidates passed along the
  aisle, and knelt before the altar, and with clasped hands and bowed heads
  awaited the touch of the hands that blessed. As those young soldiers of
  Christ knelt meekly in their places, resolving with pure and earnest hearts
  to fight manfully in His service, and praying with child-like faith for the
  aid of which they felt their need, it was indeed a spectacle to recall the
  ideal of virtuous and Christian boyhood, and to force upon the minds of many
  the contrast it presented with the other too familiar spectacle of a boyhood
  coarse, defiant, brutal, ignorant yet conceited, young in years but old in
  disobedience, in insolence, in sin.</p>

  <p>When the good bishop, in the course of his address, alluded to
  Daubeny&rsquo;s death, there was throughout the chapel instantly that silence
  that can be felt&mdash;that deep, unbroken hush of expectation and emotion
  which always produces so indescribable an effect.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who should have been
  confirmed to-day, who is not here. He has passed away from us; he will never
  be present at an earthly confirmation; he is &lsquo;confirmed in
  heaven&mdash;confirmed by God.&rsquo; I hear, and I rejoice to hear, that for
  that confirmation he was indeed prepared, and that he looked forward to it
  with some of his latest thoughts. I hear that he was pre-eminent among you
  for the piety, the purity, the amiability of his life and character, and his
  very death was caused by the intense earnestness of his desire to use aright
  the talents which God had entrusted to him. O! such a death of one so young
  yet so fit to die is far happier than the longest and most prosperous of
  sinful lives. Be sobered but not saddened by it. It is a proof of God&rsquo;s
  merciful and tender love that this one of your schoolfellows was taken in the
  clear and quiet dawn of a noble and holy life, and not some other in the
  scarlet blossom of precocious and deadly sin. Be not saddened therefore at
  the loss, but sobered by the warning. The fair, sweet, purple flower of youth
  falls and fades, my young brethren, under the sweeping scythe of death, no
  less surely than the withered grass of age. O! be ready&mdash;be ready with
  the girded loins and the lighted lamp&mdash;to obey the summons of your God.
  Who knows for which of us next, or how soon, the bell of death may toll? Be
  ye therefore ready, for you know not at what day or at what hour the voice
  may call to you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The loss of a well-known companion whom all respected and many
  loved&mdash;the crowding memories of school-life&mdash;the still small voice
  of every conscience, gave strange meaning and force to the bishop&rsquo;s
  simple words. As they listened, many wept in silence, while down the cheeks
  of Walter, of Power, and of Henderson, the tears fell like summer rain.</p>

  <p>In the evening Walter was seated thoughtfully by the fire in Power&rsquo;s
  study, while Power was writing at the table, stopping occasionally to wipe
  his glistening eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was my earliest friend here,&rdquo; he said to Walter, almost
  apologetically, as he hastily brushed off the drop which had fallen and
  blurred the paper before him. &ldquo;But I know it is selfish to be
  sorry,&rdquo; he added, as he pushed the paper towards Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I read this, Power?&rdquo; asked Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like,&rdquo; and he drew his chair by his, while Walter
  read in Power&rsquo;s small clear handwriting&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>A FAREWELL.<br>
    <br>
    Never more!<br>
    Like a dream when one awaketh<br>
    Vanishing away;<br>
    Like a billow when it breaketh<br>
    Scattered into spray;<br>
    Like a meteor&rsquo;s paling ray,<br>
    Such is man, do all he can;&mdash;<br>
    Nothing that is fair can stay.<br>
    Sorrow staineth, man complaineth.<br>
    &mdash;Sin remaineth ever more;<br>
    Like a wake upon the shore<br>
    Soundeth ever from the chorus<br>
    Of the spirits gone before us,<br>
    &ldquo;Ye shall meet us, ye shall greet us<br>
    In the sweet homes of earth, in the places of our birth,<br>
    Never more again, never more!&rdquo;<br>
    So they sing, and sweetly dying<br>
    Faints the message of their voices,<br>
    Dying like the distant murmur, when a mighty host rejoices,<br>
    But the echoes are replying with a melancholy sighing<br>
    Never more again! never more!<br>
    <br>
    Far-away<br>
    Far far-away are the homes wherein they dwell,<br>
    We have lost them, and it cost them<br>
    Many a tear, and many a fear<br>
    When God forbade their stay;<br>
    But their sorrow, on the morrow<br>
    Ceased in the dawning of a lighter, brighter day;<br>
    And our bliss shall be certain, when death&rsquo;s awful curtain.<br>
    Drawn from the darkness of mortal life away,<br>
    To happy souls revealeth what it darkly now concealeth,<br>
    Yielding to the glory of heaven&rsquo;s eternal ray.<br>
    Far far-away are the homes wherein they dwell,<br>
    But we know that they are blest, and ever more at rest,<br>
    And we utter from our hearts, &ldquo;It is well.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;May I keep them, Power?&rdquo; he asked, looking up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do, Walter, as a remembrance of to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And may I make one change, which the bishop&rsquo;s sermon
  suggested?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Power; and Walter, taking a pencil, added
  after the line &ldquo;Nothing that is fair can stay,&rdquo; these words,
  which Power afterwards copied, writing at the top, &ldquo;In memoriam,
  J.D.&rdquo;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Nothing that is fair can stay<br>
    But while Death&rsquo;s sharp scythe is sweeping,<br>
    We remember &rsquo;mid our weeping,<br>
    That a Father-hand is keeping<br>
    Every vernal bloom that falleth underneath its chilly sway.<br>
    And though earthly flowers may perish<br>
    There are buds His hand will cherish<br>
    And the things unseen Eternal&mdash;these can never pass away;<br>
    Where the angels shout Hosanna,<br>
    Where the ground is dewed with manna,<br>
    These remain and these await us in the homes of heaven for
    ay!&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The lines are in Walter&rsquo;s desk; and he values them all the more for
  the tears which have fallen on them, and blurred the neatness of the fine
  clear handwriting.</p>

  <p>On the following Tuesday our boys saw the dead body of their friend. The
  face of poor Daubeny looked singularly beautiful with the placid lines of
  death, as all innocent faces do. It was the first time they had seen a
  corpse; and as Walter touched the cold cheek, and placed a spray of evergreen
  in the rigid hand, he was almost overpowered with an awful sense of the sad
  sweet mystery of death.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is God who has taken him to Himself,&rdquo; said Mrs Daubeny, as
  she watched their emotion. &ldquo;I shall not be parted from him long. He has
  left you each a remembrance of himself, dear boys, and you will value them, I
  know, for my poor child&rsquo;s sake, and for his widowed mother&rsquo;s
  thanks to those who loved him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For each of them he had chosen, before he died, one of his most prized
  possessions. To Power he left his desk; to Henderson, his microscope; to
  Kenrick, a little gold pencil-case; and to Walter, a treasure which he deeply
  valued, a richly-bound Bible, in which he had left many memorials of the
  manner in which his days were spent; and in which he had marked many of the
  rules which were the standard of his life, and the words of hope which
  sustained his gentle and noble mind.</p>

  <p>The next day he was buried; only the boys in his own house, and those who
  had known him best, followed him to the grave. They were standing in two
  lines along the court, and the plumed hearse stood at the cottage door. Just
  at that moment the rest of the boys began to flock out of the school, for
  lessons were over. Each as he came out caught sight of the hearse, the plumes
  waving and whispering in the sea-wind, and the double line of mourners; and
  each, on seeing it, stood where he was, in perfect silence. Their numbers
  increased each moment, till boys and masters alike were there; and all by the
  same sudden impulse stopped where they were standing when first they saw the
  hearse, and stood still without a word. The scene was the more strangely
  impressive because it was accidental and spontaneous. Meanwhile, the coffin
  was carried downstairs, and placed in the hearse, which moved off slowly
  across the court between the line of bareheaded and motionless mourners. It
  was thus that Daubeny left Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, and passed under the
  Norman arch; and till he had passed through, the boys stood fixed to their
  places, like a group of statues in the usually noisy court. He was buried in
  the churchyard under the tower of the grand old church. It was a lovely spot;
  the torrent murmured near it; the shadows of the great mountains fell upon
  it; and as you stood there in the sacred silence of that memory-haunted
  field, you heard far-off the solemn monotone of the everlasting sea. There
  they laid him, and the stream of life, checked for a moment, flashed on again
  with turbulent and sparkling waves. Ah me!&mdash;yet why should we sigh at
  the merciful provision, which causes that the very best of us, when we die,
  leaves but a slight and transient ripple on the waters, which a moment after
  flow on as smoothly as before?</p>

  <p>Mrs Daubeny left Saint Winifred&rsquo;s that evening; her carriage looked
  strange with her son&rsquo;s boxes and other possessions piled up in it. Who
  would ever use that cricket-bat or those skates again? Power and Walter shook
  hands with her at the door as she was about to start; and just at the last
  moment, Henderson came running up with something, which he put on the
  carriage seat without a word. It was a bird-cage, containing a little
  favourite canary, which he and Daubeny had often fed.</p>

  <p class="first">IT was the last evening. The boys were all assembled in the
  great schoolroom to hear the result of the examination. The masters in their
  caps and gowns were seated round Dr Lane on a das in the centre of the room;
  and every one was eager to know what places the boys had taken, and who would
  win the various form prizes. Dr Lane began from the bottom of the school, and
  at the <i>last</i> boy in each form, so that the interest of the proceedings
  kept on culminating to the grand climax. The first name that will interest us
  was Eden&rsquo;s, and both Walter and Power were watching anxiously to see
  where he would come out in his form. Power had been so kindly coaching him in
  his work that they expected him to be high; but it was as much to <i>his</i>
  surprise as to their gratification, that his name was read out <i>third</i>.
  Jones and Harpour were, as was natural, last in their respective forms.</p>

  <p>At length Dr Lane got to Walter&rsquo;s form. Last but one came Howard
  Tracy, who was listening with a fine superiority to the whole announcement.
  Anthony and Franklin were not far from him. Henderson expected himself to be
  about tenth; but the tenth name, the ninth, and the eighth, all were read,
  and he had not been mentioned; his heart was beating fast, and he almost
  fancied that there must have been some mistake; but no; Dr Lane read on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seventh, Grey;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sixth, Mackworth;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fifth, Whalley;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fourth, Henderson;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>and Walter had hardly done patting him on the back, and congratulating
  him, when Dr Lane had read&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Third, Manners;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Second, Carlton;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>First</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the Doctor always read the word
  &ldquo;first&rdquo; with peculiar emphasis, and then brought out the name of
  the boy who had attained that distinction with great
  empressement&mdash;&ldquo;<i>First, Evson</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon it was Henderson&rsquo;s turn to pat him on the back, which he
  did very vigorously; and not only so, but in his enthusiasm began to
  clap&mdash;a demonstration which ran like wildfire through all the ranks of
  the boys, and before Dr Lane could raise his voice to secure
  silence&mdash;for approbation on those occasions in the great schoolroom was
  not at all <i>selon rgle</i>&mdash;our young hero had received a regular
  ovation. For since the day on Appenfell, Walter had been the favourite of the
  school, and they were only too glad to follow Henderson in his irregular
  applause. There was an intoxicating sweetness in this popularity. Could
  Walter help keenly enjoying the general regard which thus, defiant of rules,
  broke out in his honour into spontaneous acclamations?</p>

  <p>Dr Lane&rsquo;s stern &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; heard above the uproar, soon
  reduced the boys to order, and he proceeded with the list. Kenrick was read
  out first in his form, and Power, as a matter of course, again first in the
  second fifth, although in that form he was the youngest boy. Somers came out
  head of the school, by examination as well as by seniority of standing; and
  in his case, too, the impulse to cheer was too strong to be resisted. The
  head of the school was, however, tacitly excepted from the general rule, and
  Dr Lane only smiled while he listened to the clapping, which showed that
  Somers was regarded with esteem and honour by the boys, in spite of his cold
  manners and stern regime.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the Sociable Grosbeaks!&rdquo; said Henderson, as the
  boys streamed out of the room. &ldquo;Why, we carry all before us! And only
  fancy me fourth! Why, I&rsquo;m a magnificent swell, without ever having
  known it. You look out, Master Walter, or I shall have a scrimmage with you
  for laurels.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;Meanwhile, come and help me to
  pack up my laurels in my box. And then for home! Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he began to sing the exquisite air of:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Domum, domum, dulce domum,<br>
    Dulce, dulce, dulce domum;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">in which Power and Henderson joined heartily; while Kenrick
  walked on in silence.</p>

  <p>Next day the boys were scattered in every direction to their various
  homes. It need not be said that Walter passed very happy holidays that
  Christmas time. Power came and spent a fortnight with him; and let every boy
  who has a cheerful and affectionate home imagine for himself how blithely
  their days passed by. Power made himself a universal favourite, always
  unselfish, always merry, and throwing himself heartily into every amusement
  which the Evsons proposed. He and they were mutually sorry when the time came
  for them to part.</p>

  <p>From Semlyn Lake, Walter&rsquo;s home, to Fuzby, Kenrick&rsquo;s home, the
  change is great indeed; yet I must take the reader there for a short time,
  before we return to the noisy and often troubled precincts of Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s School.</p>

  <p>Before Power came to stay with the Evsons, Walter, with his father&rsquo;s
  full permission, had written to ask Kenrick to join them at the same time,
  and this is the answer he got in reply&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;My Dear Walter,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you how much your letter
    tempted me. I should so like to come; I would give <u>anything</u> to come
    and see you. To be with you and Power at such a place as Semlyn must
    be&mdash;O Walter, it almost makes me envious to think of you there. But I
    can&rsquo;t come, and I&rsquo;ll tell you frankly the reason. I can&rsquo;t
    afford, or rather I mean that my mother cannot afford, the necessary
    travelling expenses. I look on you, Walter, as my best school friend, so I
    may as well say at once that we are <u>very, very</u> poor. If I could even
    get to you by walking some of the way, and going third-class the rest, I
    would jump at the chance, but&mdash;. Lucky fellow, <u>you</u> know nothing
    of the res angusta domi.</i><br>
    <br>
    <i>&ldquo;You must be amused at the name of this place, Fuzby-le-Mud. What
    charming prospects the name opens, does it not? I assure you the name fits
    the place exactly. My goodness! how I do hate the place. You&rsquo;ll ask
    why then we live here? Simply because we <u>must</u>. Some misanthropic
    relation left us the house we live in, which saves rent.</i><br>
    <br>
    <i>&ldquo;Yet, if you were with me, I think I could be happy even here. I
    don&rsquo;t venture to ask you. First of all, we couldn&rsquo;t make you
    one-tenth part as comfortable as you are at home; secondly, there
    isn&rsquo;t the ghost of an amusement here, and if you came, you&rsquo;d go
    back to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s with a fit of blue devils, as I always do;
    thirdly, the change from Semlyn to Fuzby-le-Mud would be like walking from
    the Elysian fields and the asphodel meadows, into mere borboros as old
    Edwards would say. So I <u>don&rsquo;t</u> ask you; and yet if you could
    come&mdash;why, the day would be marked with white in the dull calendar
    of&mdash;Your ever affectionate&mdash;</i><br>
    <br>
    <i>&ldquo;Harry Kenrick.</i>&rdquo;<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As Fuzby lay nearly in the route to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, Walter,
  grieved that his friend should be doomed to such dull holidays, determined,
  with Mr Evson&rsquo;s leave, to pay him a three-days&rsquo; visit on his way
  to school. Accordingly, towards the close of the holidays, after a hopeful, a
  joyous, and an affectionate farewell to all at home, he started for Fuzby,
  from which he was to accompany Kenrick back to school; a visit fraught, as it
  turned out, with evil consequences, and one which he never afterwards ceased
  to look back upon with regret.</p>

  <p>The railroad, after leaving far behind the glorious hills of Semlyn,
  passes through country flatter and more uninteresting at every mile, until it
  finds itself fairly committed to the fens. Nothing but dreary dykes, muddy
  and straight, guarded by the ghosts of suicidal pollards, and by rows of
  dreary and desolate mills, occur to break the blank grey monotony of the
  landscape. Walter was looking out of the window with curious eyes, and he was
  wondering what life in such conditions could be like, when the train uttered
  a despairing scream, and reached a station which the porter announced as
  Fuzby-le-Mud. Walter jumped down, and his hand was instantly seized by
  Kenrick with a warm and affectionate grasp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re really here, Walter. I can hardly believe it. I
  half repent having brought you to such a place; but I was <i>so</i>
  dull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall enjoy it exceedingly, Ken, with you. Shall I give my
  portmanteau to some man to take up to the village?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, no; here&rsquo;s a&mdash; well, I may as well call it a
  <i>cart</i> at once&mdash;to take it up in. The curate lent it me, and he
  calls it a pony-carriage; but it is, you see, nothing more or less than a
  cart. I hope you won&rsquo;t be ashamed to ride in it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said Walter gaily, mounting into the
  curious little oblong wooden vehicle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very far,&rdquo; said Kenrick, &ldquo;and I daresay
  you don&rsquo;t know any one about here; so it won&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh! Ken, as if I minded such nonsense.&rdquo; Indeed, Walter
  would not have thought twice about the conveyance, if Kenrick had not harped
  upon it so much, and seemed so much ashamed of it, and mortified at being
  obliged to use it. &ldquo;Shall I drive?&rdquo; asked Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drive? Why, the pony is stone blind, and as scraggy as a scarecrow,
  so there&rsquo;s not much driving to be had out of him. Fancy if the
  aristocratic Power, or some other Saint Winifred&rsquo;s fellow saw us! Why,
  it would supply Henderson with jokes for six weeks,&rdquo; said Kenrick,
  getting up and touching the old pony with his whip. Both he and Walter were
  wholly unconscious that their equipage <i>had</i> been seen, and
  contemptuously scrutinised by one of their schoolfellows. Unknown to Walter,
  Jones was in the train; and, after a long stare at the pony-chaise, had flung
  himself back in his seat to indulge in a long guffaw, and in anticipating the
  malicious amusement he should feel in retailing at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s the
  description of Kenrick&rsquo;s horse and carriage. Petty malignity was a main
  feature of Jones&rsquo;s mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is Fuzby,&rdquo; said Kenrick laconically, pointing to a
  straggling village from which a few lights were beginning to glimmer;
  &ldquo;and I wish it were buried twenty thousand fathoms under the
  sea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ungracious as the speech may seem, it cannot be wondered at. A single
  muddy road runs through Fuzby. Except along this road&mdash;muddy and rutty
  in winter, dusty and rutty in summer&mdash;no walk is to be had. The fields
  are all more or less impassable with ditches and bogs. Kenrick had christened
  it &ldquo;The Dreary Swamp.&rdquo; Nothing in the shape of a view is to be
  found anywhere, and barely a single flower will deign to grow. The air is
  unhealthy with moisture, and the only element to be had there in perfection
  is earth.</p>

  <p>All this, Kenrick&rsquo;s father&mdash;who had been curate of the
  village&mdash;had fancied would be at least endurable to any man upheld by a
  strong sense of duty. So when he had married, and had received the gift of a
  house in the village, he took thither his young and beautiful bride,
  intending there to live and work until something better could be obtained. He
  was right. Over the mere disadvantages of situation he might easily have
  triumphed, and he might have secured there, under different circumstances, a
  fair share of happiness, which lies in ourselves and not in the localities in
  which we live. But in making his calculation he had always assumed that it
  would be easy to get on with the inhabitants of Fuzby; and here lay his
  mistake.</p>

  <p>The Vicar of Fuzby, a non-resident pluralist, only appeared at rare
  intervals to receive the adoration which his flock never refused to any one
  who was wealthy. His curate, having a very slender income, came in for no
  share at all of this respect. On the contrary, the whole population assumed a
  right to patronise him, to interfere with him, to annoy and to thwart him.
  There was at Fuzby one squire&mdash;a rich farmer, coarse, ignorant, and
  brutal. This man, being the richest person in the parish, generally carried
  everything in his own way, and among other attempts to imitate the
  absurdities of his superiors, had ordered the sexton never to cease ringing
  the church-bell, however late, until he and his family had taken their seats.
  A very few Sundays after Mr Kenrick&rsquo;s arrival the bell was still
  ringing eight minutes after the time for morning service, and sending to
  desire the sexton to leave off, he received the message that&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr Hugginson hadn&rsquo;t come yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not have the congregation kept waiting for Mr Hugginson or
  any one else,&rdquo; said the curate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O zurr, the zervus haint begun afore Muster Hugginson has come in
  this ten year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then the sooner Mr Hugginson is made to understand that the hours
  of service are not to be altered at his convenience the better. Let the bell
  cease immediately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the sexton, a dogged, bovine, bullet-headed labourer, took no notice
  whatever of this injunction, and although Mr Kenrick went into the
  reading-desk, continued lustily to ring the bell until the whole Hugginson
  family, furious that their dignity should thus be insulted, sailed into
  church at the beginning of the psalms.</p>

  <p>Next morning Mr Kenrick turned the sexton out of his place, and received a
  most wrathful visit from Mr Hugginson, who, after pouring on him a torrent of
  the most disgusting abuse, got scarlet in the forehead, shook his stick in Mr
  Kenrick&rsquo;s face, flung his poverty in his teeth, and left the cottage,
  vowing eternal vengeance.</p>

  <p>With him went all the Fuzby population. It would be long to tell the
  various little causes which led to Mr Kenrick&rsquo;s unpopularity among
  them. Every clergyman similarly circumstanced may conjecture these for
  himself; they resolved themselves mainly into the fact that Mr Kenrick was
  abler, wiser, purer, better, more Christian, than they. His thoughts were not
  theirs, nor his ways their ways.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;He had a daily beauty in his life<br>
    That made them ugly.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And so, to pass briefly and lightly, over an unpleasant subject, Fuzby was
  brimming over with the concentrated meanness of petty malignant natures,
  united in the one sole object of snubbing and worrying the unhappy curate. To
  live among them was like living in a cloud of poisonous flies. If Dante had
  known Fuzby-le-Mud, he could have found for a really generous and noble
  spirit no more detestable or unendurable inferno than this muddy English
  village.</p>

  <p>The chief characteristic of Fuzby was a pestilential spirit of gossip.
  There was no lying scandal, there was no malicious whisper, that did not
  thrive with rank luxuriance in that mean atmosphere, which, at the same time,
  starved up every great and high-minded wish. There was no circumstance so
  minute that calumny could not insert into it a venomous claw. Mr Kenrick was
  one of the most exemplary, generous, and pure-minded of men; his only fault
  was quickness of temper. His noble character, his conciliatory manners, his
  cultivated mind, his Christian forbearance, were all in vain. He was poor,
  and he could not be a toady: these were two unpardonable sins; and he, a true
  man, moved like an angel among a set of inferior beings. For a time he
  struggled on. He tried not to mind the lies they told of him. What was it to
  him, for instance, if they took advantage of his hasty language to declare
  that he was in the constant habit of swearing, when he knew that even from
  boyhood no oath had ever crossed his lips? What was it to him that these
  uneducated boors, in their feeble ignorance, tried constantly to entrap him
  into something which they called unorthodox, and to twist his words into the
  semblance of fancied heresy? It was more painful to him that they opposed and
  vilified every one whom he helped, and whose interests, in pity, he
  endeavoured to forward. But still he bore on, he struggled on, till the
  <i>dnouement</i> came. It is not worth while entering into the various
  schemes invented for his annoyance, but at last an unfortunate, although
  purely accidental, discrepancy was detected in the accounts of one of the
  parish charities which Mr Kenrick officially managed. Mr Hugginson seized his
  long-looked-for opportunity: he went round the parish, and got a large number
  of his creatures among the congregation to affirm by their signatures that Mr
  Kenrick had behaved dishonestly. This memorial he sent to the bishop, and
  disseminated among all the clergy with malicious assiduity. At the next
  clerical meeting Mr Kenrick found himself most coldly received. Compelled in
  self-defence to take legal proceedings against the squire, he found himself
  involved in heavy expenses. He won his cause, and his character was cleared;
  but the jury, attending only to the technicalities of the case, and
  conceiving that there was enough <i>prima facie</i> evidence to justify Mr
  Hugginson&rsquo;s proceedings, left each side to pay their own costs. These
  costs swallowed up the whole of the poor curate&rsquo;s private resources,
  and also involved him in debt. The agony, the suspense, the shame, the cruel
  sense of oppression and injustice, bore with a crushing weight on his
  weakened health. He could not tolerate that the merest breath of suspicion,
  however false, should pass over his fair and honourable name. He pined away
  over the atrocious calumny; it poisoned for him the very life-springs of
  happiness, and destroyed his peace of mind for ever. This young man, in the
  flower of youth&mdash;a man who might have been a leader and teacher of
  men&mdash;a man of gracious presence and high power&mdash;died of a broken
  heart. He died of a broken heart, and all Fuzby built his conspicuous tomb,
  and shed crocodile tears over his pious memory. Truly, as some one has said,
  very black stains lie here and there athwart the white conventionalities of
  common life!</p>

  <p>This had happened when our little Kenrick was eight years old; he never
  forgot the spectacle of his poor father&rsquo;s heartbreaking misery during
  the last year of his life. He never forgot how, during that year, sorrow and
  anxiety had aged his father&rsquo;s face, and silvered his hair, young as he
  was, with premature white, and so quenched his spirits, that often he would
  take his little boy on his knee, and look upon him so long in silence, that
  the child cried at the intensity of that long, mournful, hopeless gaze, and
  at the tears which he saw slowly coursing each other down his father&rsquo;s
  careworn and furrowed cheeks. Ever since then the boy had walked among the
  Fuzby people with open scorn and defiance, as among those whose slanders had
  done to death the father whom he so proudly loved. In spite of his
  mother&rsquo;s wishes, he would not stoop to pay them even the semblance of
  courtesy. No wonder that he hated Fuzby with a perfect hatred, and that his
  home there was a miserable home.</p>

  <p>Yet, if any one <i>could</i> have made happy a home in such a place, it
  would have been Mrs Kenrick. Never, I think, did a purer, a fairer, a sweeter
  soul live on earth, or one more like the angels of heaven. The winning grace
  of her manners, the simple sweetness of her address, the pathetic beauty and
  sadness of her face, would have won for her, and <i>had</i> won for her, in
  any other place but Fuzby, the love and admiration which were her due.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;She had a mind that envy could not but call fair.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>But at Fuzby, from the dominant faction of Hugginson, and the small
  vulgar-minded sets who always tried to brow-beat those who were poor,
  particularly if their birth and breeding were gentle, she found nothing but
  insulting coldness, or still more insulting patronage. When first she heard
  the marriage-bells clang out from the old church tower of her home, and had
  walked by the side of her young husband, a glad and lovely bride, she had
  looked forward to many happy years. With <i>him</i>, at any rate, it seemed
  that no place could be very miserable. Poor lady! her life had been one long
  martyrdom, all the more hard to bear because it was made up for the most part
  of small annoyances, petty mortifications, little recurring incessant
  bitternesses. And now, during the seven years of her widowhood, she had
  gained a calmer and serener atmosphere, in which she was raised above the
  <i>possibility</i> of humiliation from the dwarfed natures and malicious
  hearts in the midst of which she lived. They could hurt her feelings, they
  could embitter her days no longer. To the hopes and pleasures of earth she
  had bidden farewell. Still young, still beautiful, she had reached the full
  maturity of Christian life, meekly bearing the load of scorn, and
  disappointment, and poverty, looking only for that rest which remaineth to
  the people of God. In her lonely home, with no friend at Fuzby to whom she
  could turn for counsel or for consolation, shut up with the sorrows of her
  own lonely heart, she often mused at the slight sources, the <i>little
  sins</i> of others, from which her misery had sprung; she marvelled at the
  mystery that man should be to man &ldquo;the sorest, surest ill.&rdquo;
  Truly, it <i>is</i> a strange thought! O! it is pitiable that, as though
  death, and want, and sin were not enough, we too must add to the sum of human
  miseries by despising, by neglecting, by injuring others. We wound by our
  harsh words, we dishonour by our coarse judgments, we grieve by our untender
  pride, the souls for whom Christ died; and we wound most deeply, and grieve
  most irreparably, the noblest and the best.</p>

  <p>The one tie that bound her to earth was her orphan son&mdash;her hope, her
  pride; all her affections were centred in that beautiful boy. Now, if I were
  writing a romance, I should of course represent that yearning mother&rsquo;s
  affection as reciprocated with all the warmth and passion of the boy&rsquo;s
  heart. But it was not so. Harry Kenrick did indeed love his mother; he would
  have borne anything rather than see her suffer any great pain; but his
  manners were too often cold, his conduct wilful or thoughtless. He did not
  love her&mdash;perhaps no child can love his parents&mdash;with all the
  <i>abandon</i> and intensity wherewith she loved him. The fact is, a blight
  lay upon Kenrick whenever he was at home&mdash;the Fuzby blight he called it.
  He hated the place so much, he hated the people in it so much, he felt the
  annoyances of their situation with so keen and fretful a sensibility, that at
  Fuzby, even though with his mother, he was never happy. Even her society
  could not make up to him for the detestation with which he not unnaturally
  regarded the village and its inhabitants. At school he was bright,
  warm-hearted, and full of life; at home he seemed to draw himself into a
  shell of reserve and coldness; and it was a deep unspoken trial to that
  gentle mother&rsquo;s heart that she could not make home happy to the boy
  whom she so fondly loved, and that even to her he seemed indifferent; for his
  manners&mdash;since he had been to school and learned how very differently
  other boys were circumstanced, and what untold pleasures centred for them in
  that word &ldquo;home&rdquo;&mdash;were to her always shy and silent,
  appeared sometimes almost harsh.</p>

  <p>I wish I could represent it otherwise; but things are not often truly
  represented in books; and is not this a very common as well as a very tragic
  case? Not even in her son could Mrs Kenrick look for happiness; even his
  society brought with it trials almost as hard to bear as those which his
  absence caused. Yet no mother could have brought up her child more wisely,
  more tenderly, with more undivided and devoted care. Harry&rsquo;s
  <i>heart</i> was true could she have looked into it; but at Fuzby a cold,
  repellent manner fell on him like a mildew. And Mrs Kenrick wept in silence,
  as she thought&mdash;though it was not true&mdash;that even her own son did
  not love her, or at least did not love her as she had hoped he would. It was
  the last bitter drop in that overflowing cup which it had pleased God that
  she should be called upon to drink.</p>

  <p>The boys drove up to the door of the little cottage. It stood in a garden,
  but as the garden was overlooked by Fuzbeians on all sides, it offered few
  attractions, and was otherwise very small and plain. They were greeted by Mrs
  Kenrick&rsquo;s soft and pleasant voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, dear Harry, I am delighted that you have brought back your
  friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harry&rsquo;s mind was pre-occupied with the poverty-stricken aspect which
  he thought the house must present to his friend, and he did not answer her,
  but said to Walter&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Walter, here is the hut we inhabit. We have only one girl, as
  servant. I&rsquo;ll carry up the box. I do pretty nearly everything but clean
  the shoes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mrs Kenrick&rsquo;s eyes filled with sad tears at the bitter words; but
  she checked them to greet Walter, who advanced and shook her by the hand so
  cordially, and with a manner so respectfully affectionate, that he won her
  heart at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Harry has not yet learned,&rdquo; she said playfully, &ldquo;that
  poverty is not a thing to be ashamed of; but I am sure, Walter&mdash;forgive
  my using the name which my boy has made so familiar to me&mdash;that you will
  not mind any little inconveniences during your short stay with us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mrs Kenrick,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;to be with you and
  him will be the greatest possible enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t flap our poverty in every one&rsquo;s
  face, mother,&rdquo; said Kenrick, almost angrily, when Walter had barely
  left the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Harry, Harry,&rdquo; said Mrs Kenrick, speaking sadly, &ldquo;you
  surely forget, dear boy, that it is your mother to whom you are speaking. And
  was it I who mentioned our poverty first? O Harry, when will you learn to be
  contented with the dispensations of God? Believe me, dearest, we might make
  our poverty as happy as any wealth, if we would but have eyes to see the
  blessings it involves.&rdquo; The boy turned away impatiently, and as he ran
  upstairs to rejoin his friend, the lady sat down with a deep sigh to her
  work. It was long ere Kenrick learnt how much his conduct was to blame; but
  long after, when his mother was dead, he was reminded painfully of this
  scene, when he accidentally found in her handwriting this extract from one of
  her favourite authors&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It has been reserved for this age to perceive the blessedness of
  another kind of poverty; not voluntary nor proud, but accepted and
  submissive; not clear-sighted nor triumphant, but subdued and patient; partly
  patient in tenderness&mdash;of God&rsquo;s will; partly patient in
  blindness&mdash;of man&rsquo;s oppression; too laborious to be thoughtful,
  too innocent to be conscious; too much experienced in sorrow to be
  hopeful&mdash;waiting in its peaceful darkness for the unconceived dawn; yet
  not without its sweet, complete, untainted happiness, like intermittent notes
  of birds before the daybreak, or the first gleams of heaven&rsquo;s amber on
  the eastern grey. Such poverty as this it has been reserved for this age of
  ours to honour while it afflicted; it is reserved for the age to come to
  honour it and to spare.&rdquo;</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">WALTER could not help hearing a part of this conversation,
  and he was pained and surprised that Kenrick, whom he had regarded as so fine
  a character, should show his worst side at home, and should speak and act
  thus unkindly to one whom he was so deeply bound to love and reverence. And
  he was even more surprised when he went downstairs again and looked on the
  calm face of his friend&rsquo;s mother, so lovely, so gentle, so resigned,
  and felt the charm of manners which, in their natural grace and sweetness,
  might have shed lustre on a court. All that he could himself do was to show
  by his own manner to Mrs Kenrick the affection and respect with which he
  regarded her. When he hinted to Kenrick, as delicately and distantly as he
  could, that he thought his manner to his mother rather brusque, Kenrick
  reddened rather angrily, but only replied, &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s all very
  well for you to talk; but you don&rsquo;t live at Fuzby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my visit very much, Ken; you can&rsquo;t
  think how much I love your mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Walter, for saying so. But how would you like to <i>live
  always</i> at such a place?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I did I should do my best to make it happy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make it <i>happy</i>!&rdquo; said Kenrick; and as he turned away he
  muttered something about making a silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear. Soon
  after he told Walter some of those circumstances about his father&rsquo;s
  life which we have recently related. When the three days were over the boys
  started for Saint Winifred&rsquo;s. They drove to the station in the
  pony-chaise before described, accompanied, against Kenrick&rsquo;s will, by
  his mother. She bore up bravely as she bade them good-bye, knowing the
  undemonstrative character of boys, and seeing that they were both in the
  merriest mood. She knew, too, that their gaiety was natural: the world lay
  before <i>them</i>, bright and seductive as yet, with no shadow across its
  light; nor was she all in all to Harry as he was to her. He had other hopes,
  and another home, and other ties; and remembering this she tried not to
  grieve that he should leave her with so light a heart. But as she turned away
  from the platform when the train had started, taking with it all that she
  held dearest in the world, and as she walked back to the lonely home which
  had nothing but faith&mdash;for there was not even hope&mdash;to brighten it,
  the quiet tears flowed fast over the fair face beneath her veil. Yet as she
  crossed over her lonely threshold her thoughts were not even then for
  herself, but they carried her on the wings of prayer to the throne of mercy
  for the beloved boy from whom she was again to be separated for nearly five
  long months.</p>

  <p>The widowed mother wept; but the boy&rsquo;s spirits rose as he drew
  closer to the hills and to the sea, which told him that Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s was near. He talked happily with Walter about the coming
  half&mdash;eager with ambition, with hope, with high spirits, and fine
  resolutions. He clapped his hands with pleasure when they reached the top of
  Bardlyn Hill and caught sight of the school buildings.</p>

  <p>Having had a long distance to travel they were among the late arrivals,
  and at the great gate stood Henderson and Power ready to greet them and the
  other boys who came with them in the same coach. Among these were Eden and
  Bliss.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Eden,&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been writing a
  poem about you&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a shrimp, I&rsquo;m a shrimp of diminutive size,<br>
    Inspect my antennae and look at my eyes;<br>
    Quick, quick, feel me quick, for cannot you see<br>
    I&rsquo;m a shrimp, I&rsquo;m a shrimp, to be eaten with
    tea?&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s this?&mdash;why,&rdquo; he said clasping his hands
  and throwing up his eyes in mock rapture, &ldquo;this indeed is
  Bliss!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lick you, Flip,&rdquo; said Bliss, only in a more
  good-humoured tone than usual, as he hit at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve heard that observation before,&rdquo; said
  Henderson, dodging away. &ldquo;Ah, Walter, how do you do, my dear old
  fellow? I hope you&rsquo;re sitting on the throne of health, and reclining
  under the canopy of a well-organised brain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More than you are, Flip,&rdquo; said Walter laughing. &ldquo;You
  seem madder than ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That he is,&rdquo; said Power; &ldquo;since his return he&rsquo;s
  made on an average fifteen thousand bad puns. You ought to be grateful,
  though, for he and I have got some coffee going for you in my study. Come
  along; the Familiar will see that your luggage is all right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and I shall make bold to bring in a shrimp to tea,&rdquo; said
  Henderson, seizing hold of Eden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. I meant to ask you, Eden,&rdquo; said Power, shaking the
  little boy affectionately by the hand; &ldquo;have you enjoyed the
  holidays?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; said Eden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not looking as bright as I should like,&rdquo; said
  Power; &ldquo;never mind; if you didn&rsquo;t enjoy the holidays you must
  enjoy the half.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I shall. I hope, Walter, you&rsquo;ll be in the same dormitory
  still. What shall I do if you&rsquo;re not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, how&rsquo;s that to be, Flip?&rdquo; asked Walter; &ldquo;you
  said you&rsquo;d try to get some of us put together in one dormitory. That
  would be awfully jolly. I don&rsquo;t want to leave you, Eden, and would like
  you to be moved too; but I can&rsquo;t bear Harpour and that lot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve partly managed it and partly failed,&rdquo; said
  Henderson. &ldquo;You and the shrimp still stay with the rest of the set in
  Number 10, but as there was a vacant bed I got myself put there
  too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; said Walter and Eden both at once;
  &ldquo;that&rsquo;s capital.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;there are Jones and
  Harpour&mdash;brutes certainly both of them; and Cradock&mdash;well,
  he&rsquo;s rather a bargee, but he&rsquo;s not altogether bad; and Anthony,
  and Franklin, who are both far jollier than they used to be; indeed I like
  old Franklin very much; so with you and Eden we shall get on
  famously.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The first few days of term passed very pleasantly. The masters met the
  boys in the kindliest spirit, and the boys, fresh from home and with the
  sweet influences of home still playing over them, did not begin at once to
  reweave the ravelled threads of evil school tradition. They were all on good
  terms with each other and with themselves, full of good resolutions,
  cheerful, and happy.</p>

  <p>All our boys had got their removes. Walter had won a double remove and was
  now under his friend Mr Percival. Kenrick was in the second fifth, and Power,
  young as he was, had now attained the upper fifth, which stands next to the
  dignity of the monitors and the sixth.</p>

  <p>The first Sunday of term was a glorious day of early spring, and the boys,
  according to their custom, scattered themselves in various groups in the
  grounds about Saint Winifred&rsquo;s School. The favourite place of resort
  was a broad green field at the back of the buildings, shaded by noble trees,
  and half encircled by a bend of the river. Here, on a fine Sunday, between
  dinner and afternoon school, you were sure to find the great majority of the
  boys walking arm in arm by twos and threes, or sitting with books on the
  willow trunks that overhung the stream, or stretched out at full length upon
  the grass, and lazily learning Scripture repetition.</p>

  <p>It was a sweet spot and a pleasant time; but Walter generally preferred
  his beloved seashore; and on this afternoon he was sitting there talking to
  Power, while Eden, perched on the top of a piece of rock close by, kept
  murmuring to himself his afternoon lesson. The conversation of the two boys
  turned chiefly on the holidays which were just over, and Power was asking
  Walter about his visit to Kenrick&rsquo;s house.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How did you enjoy the visit, Walter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very much for some things. Mrs Kenrick is the sweetest lady you
  ever saw.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Ken is always abusing Fuzby&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that the
  name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; it isn&rsquo;t a particularly jolly place, certainly, but he
  doesn&rsquo;t make the best of it; he makes up his mind to detest
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know. They didn&rsquo;t treat his father well. His
  father was curate of the place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;ve seen, Fuzby isn&rsquo;t singular in that
  respect. It&rsquo;s no easy thing in most places for a poor clergyman to keep
  on good terms with his people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but Ken&rsquo;s father does seem to have been abominably
  treated.&rdquo; And Walter proceeded to tell Power the parts of Mr
  Kenrick&rsquo;s history which Kenrick had told him.</p>

  <p>When he had finished the story he observed that Eden had shut up his book
  and was listening intently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hallo, Arty,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean you to
  hear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m so sorry. I really didn&rsquo;t know
  you meant to be talking secrets, for you weren&rsquo;t talking particularly
  low.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The noise of the waves prevents that. But never mind; I don&rsquo;t
  suppose it&rsquo;s any secret. Ken never told me not to mention it. Only, of
  course, you mustn&rsquo;t tell any one, you know, as it clearly isn&rsquo;t a
  thing to be talked about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Eden; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t mention it, of course.
  So other people have unhappy homes as well as me,&rdquo; he added in a low
  tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, isn&rsquo;t your home happy, Arty?&rdquo; asked Power.</p>

  <p>Eden shook his head. &ldquo;It used to be, but this holidays mamma married
  again. She married Colonel Braemar&mdash;and I <i>can&rsquo;t bear</i>
  him.&rdquo; The words were said so energetically as to leave no doubt that he
  had some grounds for the dislike; but Power said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Arty, you must try to like him. Are you sure you know your
  Rep. perfectly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s take a turn till the bell rings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While this conversation was going on by the shore, a very different scene
  was being enacted in the Croft, as the field was called which I above
  described.</p>

  <p>It happened that Jones, and one of his set, named Mackworth, were walking
  up and down the Croft in one direction, while Kenrick and Whalley, one of his
  friends, were pacing up and down the same avenue in the opposite direction,
  so that the four boys passed each other every five minutes. The first time
  they met, Kenrick could not help noticing that Jones and Mackworth nudged
  each other derisively as he passed, and looked at him with a glance
  unmistakably impudent. This rather surprised him, though he was on bad terms
  with them both. Kenrick had not forgotten how grossly Jones had bullied him
  when he was a new boy, and before he had risen out of the sphere in which
  Jones could dare to bully him with impunity. He was now so high in the school
  as to be well aware that Jones would be nearly as much afraid to touch him as
  he always was to annoy any one of his own size and strength; and Kenrick had
  never hesitated to show Jones the quiet but quite measureless contempt which
  he felt for his malice and meanness. Mackworth was a bully of another stamp;
  he was rather a clever fellow, set himself up for an aristocrat on the
  strength of being second cousin to a baronet, studied &ldquo;De Brett&rsquo;s
  Peerage,&rdquo; dressed as faultlessly as Tracy himself, and affected at all
  times a studious politeness of manner. He had been a good deal abroad, and as
  he constantly adopted the airs and the graces of a fashionable person, the
  boys had felicitously named him French Varnish. But Mackworth was a dangerous
  enemy, for he had one of the most biting tongues in the whole school, and
  there were few things which he enjoyed more than making a young boy wince
  under his cutting words. When Kenrick came to school, his wardrobe, the work
  of Fuzbeian artists, was not only well worn&mdash;for his mother was too poor
  to give him new clothes&mdash;but also of a somewhat odd cut; and accordingly
  the very first words Mackworth had ever addressed to Kenrick were&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You new fellow, what&rsquo;s your father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My father is dead,&rdquo; said Kenrick in a low tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what <i>was</i> he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was curate of Fuzby.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curate was he; a slashing trade that,&rdquo; was the brutal reply.
  &ldquo;Curate of Fuzby? are you sure it isn&rsquo;t Fusty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick looked at him with a strange glowing of the eyes, which, so far
  from disconcerting Mackworth, only made him chuckle at the success of his
  taunt. He determined to exercise the lancet of his tongue again, and let
  fresh blood if possible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, glare-eyes! so you didn&rsquo;t like my remark?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick made no answer, and Mackworth continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What charity-boy has left you his off-cast clothes? May I ask if
  your jacket was intended to serve also as a looking-glass? and is it the
  custom in your part of the country not to wear breeches below the
  knees?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a corrosive malice in this speech so intense that Kenrick never
  saw Mackworth without recalling the shame and anguish it had caused. Fresh
  from home, full of quick sensibility, feeling ridicule with great keenness,
  Kenrick was too much pained by these words even for anger. He had hung his
  head and slunk away. For days after, until, at his most earnest entreaty, his
  mother had incurred much privation to afford him a new and better suit, he
  had hardly dared to lift up his face. He had fancied himself a mark for
  ridicule, and the sense of shabbiness and poverty had gone far to crush his
  spirit. After a time he recovered, but never since that day had he deigned to
  speak to Mackworth a single word.</p>

  <p>He was surprised, therefore, at the obtrusive impertinence of these two
  fellows, and when next he passed them, he surveyed them from head to foot
  with a haughty and indignant stare. The moment after he heard them burst into
  a laugh, and begin talking very loudly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was the rummiest vehicle you ever saw,&rdquo; he heard Jones
  say; &ldquo;a cart, I assure you&mdash;nothing more or less, and drawn by the
  very scraggiest scarecrow of a blind horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He caught no more as the distance between them lessened, but he heard
  Jones bubbling over with a stupid giggle at some remark of Mackworth&rsquo;s
  about <i>glare-eyes</i> being drawn by a <i>blind</i> horse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How rude those fellows are, Ken,&rdquo; said Whalley; &ldquo;what
  do they mean by it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dogs!&rdquo; said Kenrick, stamping angrily, while his face was
  scarlet with rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re trying to annoy you, Ken,&rdquo; said Whalley, who
  was a very gentle, popular boy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t give them the triumph of
  seeing that they succeed. They&rsquo;re only Varnish and
  White-Feather&mdash;we all know what <i>they&rsquo;re</i> like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dogs!&rdquo; said Kenrick again; &ldquo;I should like to pitch into
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave them, and go and sit by the river,
  Ken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Whalley. I&rsquo;m sure they mean to insult me, and I want to
  hear how, and why.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty in doing this, for Jones and his ally were again
  approaching, and Jones was talking purposely loud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never could bear the fellow; gives himself such airs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; only fancy going to meet his friends in a hay-waggon! What a
  start! He! he! he!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such impudence in a low fellow like that...&rdquo; and
  here Kenrick lost some words, for, as they passed, Jones lowered his voice;
  but he heard, only too plainly, the words &ldquo;father&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;dishonest parson&rdquo;&mdash;the rest he could supply with fatal
  facility.</p>

  <p>For half an instant he stood paralysed, his eyes burning with fury, but
  his face pale as ashes. The next second he sprang upon Jones, seized with
  both hands the collar of his coat, shook him, flung him violently to the
  ground, and kicked his hat, which had fallen off in the struggle, straight
  into the river.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the deuce do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Jones, picking
  himself up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just give you&mdash;fifth-form, or no fifth-
  form&mdash;the best licking you ever had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just not presume to lay upon him the tip of your
  finger,&rdquo; said Whalley, who was quite as big as Jones, and was very fond
  of Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not for flinging me down and kicking my hat into the
  water?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Jones,&rdquo; said Whalley, quietly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
  what you were talking about, but you clearly meant to insult him, from your
  manner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row? what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said a number of
  boys, who began to throng round.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only a plebeian splutter of rage from our well-bred friend
  there,&rdquo; said Mackworth, pointing contemptuously at Kenrick, who stood
  with dilated nostrils, still heaving with rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heaven only knows <i>apropos</i> of just nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar,&rdquo; said Kenrick impetuously. &ldquo;You
  know that you told lies and insulted me; and if you say it again, I&rsquo;ll
  do the same again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only try,&rdquo; said Jones, in a surly tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Insulted you?&rdquo; said Mackworth in bland accents. &ldquo;We
  were talking about a dishonest parson, as far as I remember. Pray, are you a
  dishonest parson?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take care,&rdquo; said Kenrick with fierce
  energy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take care of what? We didn&rsquo;t ask <i>you</i> to listen to our
  conversation; listeners hear no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; interposed Whalley; &ldquo;you know you were talking
  at the top of your voices, and we couldn&rsquo;t help hearing you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what then? Mayn&rsquo;t we talk as loud as we like?&mdash;I
  assure you, on my word of honour,&rdquo; he said, turning to the group around
  them, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t even mention Kenrick&rsquo;s name. We were
  merely talking about a certain dishonest parson who rode in hay-carts, when
  the fellow sprang on Jones like a tiger-cat. I&rsquo;m sure, if he&rsquo;s
  any objection to our talking of such unpleasant people we won&rsquo;t do so
  in his hearing,&rdquo; said Mackworth, in an excess of venomous
  politeness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;French Varnish,&rdquo; said Whalley, with honest contempt, moved
  beyond his wont with indignation, though he did not understand the cause of
  Kenrick&rsquo;s anger. &ldquo;I wonder why Kenrick should even condescend to
  notice what such fellows as you and Jones say. Come along, Ken; you know what
  we all think about those two;&rdquo; and, putting his arm in Kenrick&rsquo;s,
  he almost dragged him from the scene, while Jones and Mackworth (conscious
  that there was not a single other boy who would not condemn their conduct as
  infamous when they understood it) were not sorry to move off in another
  direction.</p>

  <p>But when Whalley had taken Kenrick to a quiet place by the river side, and
  asked him &ldquo;what had made him so furious?&rdquo; he returned no answer,
  only hiding his face in his hands. He had indeed been cruelly insulted,
  wounded in his tenderest sensibilities; he felt that his best affections had
  been wantonly and violently lacerated. It made him more miserable than he had
  ever felt before, and he could not tolerate the wretched thought that his
  father&rsquo;s sad history, probably in some distorted form, had been, by
  some means or other, bruited about among unsympathising hearers, and made the
  common property of the school. He knew well indeed the natural delicacy of
  feeling which would prevent any other boy, except Jones or Mackworth, from
  ever alluding to it even in the remotest way. But that they should know at
  all the shameful charge which had broken his father&rsquo;s heart, and
  brought temporary suspicion and dishonour on his name, was gall and wormwood
  to him.</p>

  <p><i>Yet, by what possible means could, this have become known to them</i>?
  Kenrick knew of one way only. He thought over what Jones had said. &ldquo;A
  cart and blind horse&mdash;ah! I see; there is <i>only one person</i> who
  could have told him about that. So, <i>Walter Evson</i>, you amuse yourself
  and Jones by making fun of our being poor, and by ridiculing what you saw in
  our house; a very good laugh you&rsquo;ve all had over it in the dormitory,
  I&rsquo;ve no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick did not know that Jones had seen them from the window of the
  railway-carriage, and that as he had been visiting an aunt at no great
  distance, he had heard there the particulars of Mr Kenrick&rsquo;s history.
  He clutched angrily at the conclusion, that <i>Walter</i> had betrayed him,
  and turned him into derision. Naturally passionate, growing up during the
  wilful years of opening boyhood without a father&rsquo;s wise control, he did
  not stop to inquire, but leapt at once to a false and obstinate inference.
  &ldquo;It must be so; it clearly <i>is</i> so,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;yet
  I could not have believed it of him;&rdquo; and he burst into a flood of
  bitter and angry tears.</p>

  <p>The fact was that Kenrick, though he would hardly have admitted it even to
  himself, was in a particularly ready mood to take offence. He had observed
  that Walter disapproved of his manner towards his mother, and his sensitive
  pride had already been ruffled by the fact that Walter had exercised the
  moral courage of pointing out, though in the most delicate and modest way,
  the brusquerie which he reprobated. At the time he had said little, but in
  reality this had made him very, very angry; and the more so because he was
  jealous enough to fancy that he now stood second only, or even third, in
  Walter&rsquo;s estimation, and that Power and Henderson had deposed him from
  the place which he once held as his chief friend; and that Walter had also
  usurped <i>his</i> old place in <i>their</i> affections. This displeased him
  greatly, for he was not one who could contentedly take the second place. He
  could not have had a more excellent companion than the manly and upright
  Whalley; but in his close intimacy with him he had rather hoped to pique
  Walter, and show him that his society was not indispensable to his happiness.
  But Walter&rsquo;s open and generous mind was quite incapable of
  understanding this unworthy motive, and with feelings far better trained than
  those of Kenrick, he never felt the slightest qualm of this small
  jealousy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Whalley, patting him on the
  back; &ldquo;why should you care so much because two <i>such</i> fellows as
  White-feather and Varnish try to be impudent. I shouldn&rsquo;t care the snap
  of a finger for anything they could say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, Whalley, it isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said
  Kenrick proudly, drying his tears. &ldquo;But how did those fellows know the
  things they were hinting at? Only one person ever heard them, and he must
  have betrayed them to laugh at me behind my back. It&rsquo;s <i>that</i> that
  makes me miserable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But whom do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The excellent Evson,&rdquo; said Kenrick bitterly. &ldquo;And mark
  me, Whalley, I&rsquo;ll never speak to him again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Evson</i>,&rdquo; said Whalley, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
  he&rsquo;s at all the fellow to do it. Are you certain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite. No one else could know the things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But surely you&rsquo;ll ask him first?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; answered Kenrick, gloomily; &ldquo;but I
  <i>will</i>, in order that he may understand that I have found him
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XXIII. &mdash; A BROKEN FRIENDSHIP</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Everard, Everard, which was the truest,<br>
    God in the future, and Time will show,<br>
    Ne&rsquo;er will I stoop to defence or excuses&mdash;<br>
    If you despise me&mdash;be it so!<br>
    But, my Everard, still (for I love you)<br>
    This to the end my prayer shall be&mdash;<br>
    Ne&rsquo;er may you be so sternly treated,<br>
    Never be judged as you judge me.</i>&mdash;F.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">KENRICK did not happen to meet Walter during the remainder
  of that Sunday, because Walter was chiefly sitting in Mr Percival&rsquo;s
  room, but the next day, still nursing the smouldering fire of his anger, he
  determined to get the first opportunity he could of meeting him, in order
  that he might tax him with his supposed false friendship and breach of
  confidence.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, when school was over next day, he went with Whalley to look
  for him in the playground. Walter was walking with Henderson, never dreaming
  that anything unpleasant was likely to happen. Henderson was the first to
  catch sight of them, and as he never saw Whalley without chaffing him in some
  ridiculous way or other&mdash;for Whalley&rsquo;s charming good humour made
  him a capital subject for a joke&mdash;he at once began, as might have been
  expected, to sing&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;O Whalley, Whalley up the bank,<br>
    And Whalley, Whalley down the brae,<br>
    And Whalley, Whalley, by yon burnside&mdash;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">whereupon his song was interrupted by Whalley&rsquo;s giving
  chase to him, which did not end till he had been led a dance half round the
  school buildings, while the ground was left clear for Kenrick&rsquo;s
  expostulations.</p>

  <p>Walter came up to him as cordially as usual, but stopped short in
  surprise, when he caught the scornful lowering expression of his
  friend&rsquo;s face; but as Kenrick did not speak at once, he took him by the
  hand, and said, &ldquo;Why, Ken, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick very coldly withdrew his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Evson, I came to ask you if&mdash;whether&mdash;if you&rsquo;ve
  been telling to any of the fellows all about me; all I told you about my
  father?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As Walter instantly remembered that he had mentioned the story to Power,
  he could not at once say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but was about to explain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Telling any of the fellows all about you and your father?&rdquo; he
  repeated; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please, I don&rsquo;t want any excuses. If you haven&rsquo;t,
  it&rsquo;s easy to say &lsquo;No&rsquo;; if you <i>have</i>, I only want you
  to say &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you never told me that I wasn&rsquo;t to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes or no?&rdquo; said Kenrick, with an impatient gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I must say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; then; but hear me
  explain. I only mentioned it to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, thank you. I don&rsquo;t want to hear any
  more. I don&rsquo;t want to know whom you mentioned it to;&rdquo; and Kenrick
  turned short on his heel, and began to walk off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But hear me, Ken,&rdquo; said Walter eagerly, walking after him,
  and laying his hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Kenrick,&rdquo; said he, shaking off Walter&rsquo;s
  hand. &ldquo;You may apologise if you like; but even then I shan&rsquo;t
  speak to you again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have nothing to apologise for. I only told&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t care whom you &lsquo;only&rsquo; told.
  It&rsquo;s &lsquo;only&rsquo; all over the school. And it&rsquo;s not the
  &lsquo;only&rsquo; time you&rsquo;ve behaved dishonourably.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Walter, who was rapidly
  getting into as great a passion as Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Betraying confidence is <i>almost</i> as bad as breaking open
  desks, and burning&mdash;&rdquo; Such a taunt, coming from Kenrick, was base
  and cruel, and he knew it to be so.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you for the allusion,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;I deserve
  it, I own, but I&rsquo;m surprised, Kenrick, that <i>you</i>, of all others;
  should make it. <i>That</i>, I admit, was an act of sin and strange folly for
  which I must always feel humiliated, and implore to be forgiven. And every
  generous person <i>has</i> long ago forgiven me and forgotten it. But in
  <i>this</i> case, if you weren&rsquo;t in such a silly rage, I could show you
  that I&rsquo;ve done nothing wrong. Only I know you wouldn&rsquo;t listen
  <i>now</i>, and I shan&rsquo;t condescend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Condescend</i>! I like that,&rdquo; said Kenrick, interrupting
  him with a scornful laugh, which made Walter&rsquo;s blood tingle.
  &ldquo;<i>You</i> condescend to <i>me</i>, forsooth.&rdquo; Higher words
  might have ensued, but at this moment Henderson, still pursued by Whalley,
  came running up, and seeing that something had gone wrong, he said to
  Kenrick&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hallo, Damon! what has Pythias been saying to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick vouchsafed no answer, but turning his back on them, went off
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very angry with you, Evson,&rdquo; said Whalley,
  &ldquo;because he thinks you&rsquo;ve been telling Jones and that lot his
  family secrets.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing whatever of the kind,&rdquo; said Walter,
  indignantly. &ldquo;I admit that I did thoughtlessly mention it to Power; and
  one other overheard me. It never occurred to me for a moment that Kenrick
  would mind. You know I wouldn&rsquo;t dream of speaking about it ill-
  naturedly, and if that fellow wasn&rsquo;t blind with rage I could have
  explained it to him in about five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you merely mentioned it to Power, I&rsquo;m sure Kenrick would
  not so much mind. I&rsquo;ll tell him about it when he&rsquo;s cooler,&rdquo;
  said Whalley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you like, Whalley; Kenrick has no business to suspect me in that
  shameful way, and to abuse me, and treat me as if I was quite beneath his
  notice, and cast old faults in my teeth,&rdquo; answered Walter, with deep
  vexation. &ldquo;Let him find out the truth for himself. He can, if he takes
  the trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Both the friends were thoroughly angry with each other; each of them
  imagined himself deeply wronged by the other, and each of them, in his
  irritation, used strong and unguarded expressions which lost nothing by
  repetition. Thus the &ldquo;rift of difference&rdquo; was cleft deeper and
  deeper between them; and, chiefly through Kenrick&rsquo;s pride and
  precipitancy, a disagreement which might at first have been easily adjusted
  became a serious, and threatened to become a permanent, quarrel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Power, did you repeat what I told you about Kenrick to any
  one?&rdquo; asked Walter, next time he met him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Repeat it?&rdquo; said Power; &ldquo;why, Walter, do you suppose I
  would? What do you take me for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Power; I know that you couldn&rsquo;t do such a thing;
  but Kenrick declares I&rsquo;ve spread it all over the school, and has just
  been abusing me like a pickpocket.&rdquo; Walter told him the circumstances
  of the case, and Power, displeased for Walter&rsquo;s sake, and sorry that
  two real friends should be separated by what he could not but regard as a
  venial error on Walter&rsquo;s part, advised him to write a note to Kenrick
  and explain the true facts of the case again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the use, Power?&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;he
  would not listen to my explanation, and said as many hard things of me as he
  could.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, in a passion. He&rsquo;ll be sorry for them directly
  he&rsquo;s calm; for you know what a generous fellow he is. You can forgive
  them, I&rsquo;m sure, Walter, and win the pleasure of being the first to make
  an advance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter, after a little struggle with his resentment, wrote a note, and
  gave it to Whalley to give to Kenrick next time he saw him. It ran as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;My dear Kenrick,&mdash;I think you are a little hard upon me. Who
    can have told Jones anything about you and your home secrets I don&rsquo;t
    know. He <u>could</u> not have learnt them through me. It&rsquo;s true I
    did mention something about your father to Power when I was talking in the
    most affectionate way about you. I&rsquo;m very sorry for this, but I never
    dreamt it would make you so angry. Power is the last person to repeat such
    a thing. Pray forgive me, and believe me always to be&mdash;<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Your affectionate friend, Walter Evson.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Kenrick&rsquo;s first impulse on receiving this note was to seek Walter on
  the earliest occasion, and &ldquo;make it up&rdquo; with him in the sincerest
  and heartiest way he could. But suddenly the sight of Jones and Mackworth
  vividly reminded his proud and sensitive nature of the scene that had caused
  him such acute pain. He did not see how Jones <i>could</i> have learnt about
  the vehicle, at any rate, without Walter having laughed over it to some one.
  Instead of seeking further explanation, or thinking no evil and hoping all
  things, he again gave reins to his anger and suspicion, and wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;I am bound to believe your explanation as far as it goes. But I
    have reason to <u>know</u> that <u>something</u> more must have passed than
    what you admit yourself to have said. I am astonished that you should have
    treated me so unworthily. I would not have done so to you. I will try to
    forget this unpleasant business; but it is only in a sense that I can sign
    myself again.<br>
    <br>
    &ldquo;Your affectionate friend. H. Kenrick.&rdquo;</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Walter had not expected this cold, ungracious reply. When Whalley gave him
  Kenrick&rsquo;s note he tore it open eagerly, anticipating a frank renewal of
  their former friendship; but a red spot rose to his cheeks as he saw the
  insinuation that he had not told the whole truth, and as he tore up the note,
  he indignantly determined to take no further step towards a
  reconciliation.</p>

  <p>Yet as he thought how many pleasant hours they had spent together, and how
  firmly on the whole Kenrick had stood by him in his troubles, and how lovable
  a boy he really was, Walter could not but grieve over this difference. He
  found himself often yearning to be on the old terms with Kenrick; he felt
  that at heart he still loved him well; and after a few days he again stifled
  all pride, and wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Dear Ken,&mdash;Is it possible that you will not believe my word?
    If you still feel any doubt about what I have said, do come and see me in
    Power&rsquo;s study. I am sure that I would convince you in five minutes
    that you must be under some mistake; and if I have done you any wrong, or
    if you <u>think</u> that I have done you any wrong, Ken, I&rsquo;ll
    apologise sincerely without any pride or reserve. I miss your society very
    much, and I still am and shall be, whatever you may think and whatever you
    may say of me. &mdash;Yours affectionately, W.E.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As he naturally did not wish any third person to know what was passing
  between them he did not entrust this note to any one, but himself placed it
  between the leaves of an Herodotus which he knew that Kenrick would use at
  the next school. He had barely put it there when a boy who wanted an
  Herodotus happened to come into the classroom, and seeing Kenrick&rsquo;s
  lying on the table, coolly walked off with it, after the manner of boys,
  regardless of the inconvenience to which the owner might be put. As this boy
  was reading a different part of Herodotus from that which Kenrick was
  reading, Walter&rsquo;s note lay between the leaves where it had been placed,
  unnoticed. When the book was done with, the boy forgot it, and left it in
  school, where, after kicking about for some days unowned, it was consigned,
  with other stray volumes, to a miscellaneous cupboard, where it lay
  undisturbed for years. Kenrick supposed that it was lost, or that some one
  had &ldquo;bagged&rdquo; it; and, unknown to Walter, his note never reached
  the hands for which it had been destined. In vain he waited for a reply; in
  vain he looked for some word or sign to show that Kenrick had received his
  letter. But Kenrick still met him in perfect silence, and with averted looks;
  and Walter, surprised at his obstinate unkindness, thought that he
  <i>could</i> do nothing more to disabuse him of his false impression, and was
  the more ready to forego a friendship which by every honourable means he had
  endeavoured to retain.</p>

  <p>Poor Kenrick! he felt as much as Walter did that he had lost one of his
  truest and most pleasant friends, and he, too, often yearned for the old
  intercourse between them. Even his best friends, Power, Henderson, and
  Whalley, all thought him wrong; and in consequence a coolness rose between
  them and him. He felt thoroughly miserable, and did not know where to turn;
  yet none the less he ostentatiously abstained from making the slightest
  overture to Walter; and whereas the two boys might have enjoyed together many
  happy hours, they felt a continual embarrassment at being obliged to meet
  each other very frequently in awkward silence, and apparent unconsciousness
  of each other&rsquo;s presence. This silent annoyance recurred continually at
  all hours of the day. They threw away the golden opportunity of smoothing and
  brightening for each other their schoolboy years. It is sad that since true
  friends are so few, such slight differences, such trivial misunderstandings,
  should separate them for years. If a man&rsquo;s penitence for past follies
  be humble and sincere, his crimes and failings may well be buried in a
  generous oblivion; but, alas! his own friends, and they of his own household,
  are too often <i>the last</i> to forgive and to forget. Too often they do not
  condone the fault till years of unhappiness and disappointment have
  intervened; till the wounds which they have inflicted are cicatrised; till
  the sinner&rsquo;s loneliness has taught him to look for other than human
  sympathy; till he is too old, too sorrowful, too heartbroken, too near the
  Great White Throne, to expect any joy from human friendship, or any
  consolation in human love.</p>

  <p>Twice did chance throw the friends into situations in which a
  reconciliation would have been easy. Once, when the school was assembled to
  hear the result of some composition prizes, they found themselves
  accidentally seated, one on each side of Power. The mottoes on the envelopes
  which were sent in with the successful exercises were always read out before
  the envelope was opened, and in one of the prizes for which there had been
  many competitors, the punning motto, Ezousiazo, told them at once that Power
  had again achieved a brilliant success. The Great Hall was always a scene for
  the triumphs of this happy boy. Both Walter and Kenrick turned at the same
  moment to congratulate him, Walter seizing his right-hand and Kenrick his
  left. Power, after thanking them for their warm congratulations, grasped both
  their hands, and drew them towards each other. Kenrick was aware of what he
  meant, and his heart fluttered as he now hoped to regain a lost friend; but
  just at that moment Walter&rsquo;s attention happened to be attracted by
  Eden, who, though sitting some benches off, wished to telegraph his
  congratulations to Power. Unfortunately, therefore, Walter turned his head
  away, before he knew that Kenrick&rsquo;s hand was actually touching his. He
  did not perceive Power&rsquo;s kind intention until the opportunity was lost;
  and Kenrick, misinterpreting his conduct, had flushed with sudden pride, and
  hastily withdrawn his hand. On the second occasion Walter had gone up the
  hill to the churchyard, by the side of which was a pleasant stile,
  overshadowed by aged elms, on which he often sat reading or enjoying the
  breeze and the view. It suddenly occurred to him that he would look at
  Daubeny&rsquo;s grave, to see if the stone had yet been put up. He found that
  it had just been raised, and he was sorrowfully reading the inscription, when
  a footstep roused him from his mournful recollections. A glance showed him
  that Kenrick was approaching, evidently with the same purpose. He came slowly
  to the grave and read the epitaph. Their eyes met in a friendly gaze. A
  sudden impulse to reconciliation seized them both, and they were on the verge
  of shaking hands, when three boys came sauntering through the
  churchyard&mdash;one of them was the ill-omened Jones. The association jarred
  on both their minds, and turning away without a word they walked home in
  different directions.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">THEY went home in different directions, and morally too
  their paths henceforth were widely diverse. The Pythagoreans chose the letter
  Y as their symbol for a good and evil life. The broad, sloping, almost
  perpendicular left-hand stroke is an apt emblem for the facile downward
  descent into Avernus; the precipitous and narrow right-hand stroke aptly
  presents the slippery, uphillward struggle of a virtuous course I remember to
  have seen, as a child, another and a similar emblem which impressed me much.
  On the one side of the picture a snail was slowly creeping up a steep path;
  on the other a stag rushed and bounded unrestrained down the sheer
  proclivities of a wide and darkening hill. Improvement is ever slow and
  difficult; degeneracy is too often startling rapid. From henceforth, as we
  shall have occasion to see hereafter, Walter was progressing from strength to
  strength, adding to faith virtue, and to virtue temperance, and to temperance
  knowledge, and to knowledge brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness
  charity&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Springing from crystal step to crystal step<br>
    Of the bright air&mdash;;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">while our poor Kenrick was gradually descending deeper and
  deeper into darkness and despair.</p>

  <p>Yet he loved Walter, and sighed for the old intimacy, while he was daily
  abusing his character and affecting to scorn his conduct. In short, a change
  came over Kenrick. There had always been a little worm at the root of his
  admiration of and affection for Walter. It was jealousy. He did not like to
  hear him praised so loudly by his friends and schoolfellows; and besides this
  he was vexed that Walter, Henderson, and Power, were more closely allied to
  each other than to him. He had struggled successfully against these unworthy
  feelings so long as Walter was his friend, but now that he had allowed
  himself to seek a quarrel with him they grew up with tremendous luxuriance.
  And he was so thoroughly in the wrong, and so obstinate in persisting to
  misunderstand and misrepresent his former friend, that gradually, by his
  pertinacity and injustice, he alienated the regard of all those who had once
  been his chosen companions. Even Whalley grew cool towards him. He had to
  look elsewhere for associates, and unhappily he looked in the wrong
  direction.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Walter, although he constantly grieved at the loss of a friend,
  was otherwise very happy. The boys at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s were not
  overworked; there was enough work to stimulate but not to oppress them, and
  Walter&rsquo;s work grew more promising every day. He was fond of praise, and
  Mr Percival, while he always took care so to praise him as to obviate the
  danger of conceit, was not so scant of his approbation as most men are. His
  warm and generous appreciation encouraged and rewarded Walter&rsquo;s
  exertions, so that he was quite the &ldquo;star&rdquo; of his form. Many
  other boys did well under Mr Percival. There was a bright and cheerful
  emulation among them all, and they took especial pains with their exercises,
  which Mr Percival varied in every possible way, so as to call out the
  imagination and the fancy, to exercise both the reason and the understanding,
  and to test the powers of attention and research. His method was so
  successful that it was often a real pleasure to look over the exercises of
  his form, and he had adopted one plan for keeping up the boys&rsquo; interest
  in them, which was eminently useful. All the <i>best</i> exercises, if they
  attained to any positive excellence, were sent to Dr Lane; and at the end of
  the half-year, a number, printed opposite to the boy&rsquo;s name, showed how
  often he had thus been &ldquo;sent up for good.&rdquo; If in one fortnight
  <i>four</i> separate exercises were so sent up, the form obtained, by this
  proof of industry, the remission of an hour&rsquo;s work, and as this honour
  could never be cheaply won it was highly prized. Now two or three times
  Walter&rsquo;s unusually brilliant exercises had been the chief contribution
  towards winning these remitted hours, and this success caused him double
  happiness, because it necessarily made him a general favourite with the form.
  Henderson (who had only got a single remove at the beginning of the term, but
  had worked so hard in his new form that he had succeeded in his purpose of
  winning a remove <i>during</i> the term, and so being again in the same
  division with Walter) did his best to earn the same distinction, but he only
  succeeded when the exercise happened to be an English one, and on a subject
  which gave some opportunity for his sense of the ludicrous. He generally
  contrived to introduce some purely fictitious &ldquo;Eastern Apologue&rdquo;
  as he called it; and as he rarely managed to keep the correct Oriental
  colouring, his combinations of Sultans, Tchokadars, Odaliques, and white
  bears, were sometimes so inexpressibly absurd that Mr Percival, to avoid fits
  of laughter, was obliged to look over his exercises alone. Nor were his
  eccentricities always confined to his English themes; his Latin verses were
  occasionally no less extraordinary, and in one set, on the suicide of Ajax,
  the last few lines consisted of fragmentary words interspersed here and there
  with numerous stars&mdash;a phenomenon which he explained to Mr Percival in
  the gravest manner possible, by saying that here the voice of Ajax was
  interrupted by sobs!</p>

  <p>Happy in his work, Walter was no less happy in his play. The glorious
  mid-day bathes on the hard sparkling yellow sands when the sea was smooth as
  the blue of heaven, and clear as transparent glass&mdash;the long afternoons
  on the green and sunny cricket field&mdash;the strolls over the mountains,
  and lazy readings under a tree in the fragrant fir-groves&mdash;all
  invigorated him, and gave to his face the health, and to his heart the mirth,
  which told of an innocent life and a vigorous frame.</p>

  <p>But it must not be supposed that he escaped troubles of his own, and his
  first trouble rose out of the kind boyish protectorate which he had
  established over little Eden&rsquo;s interests.</p>

  <p>His rescue of Eden from the clutches of a bad lot was one of
  Walter&rsquo;s proudest and gladdest reminiscences. Instead of moping about
  miserable and lonely, and rapidly developing into a rank harvest the evil
  seeds which his tormentors had tried to plant in his young heart, Eden was
  now the gayest of the gay. Secure from most annoyances by possessing the
  refuge of Power&rsquo;s study, and the certainty of Walter&rsquo;s help, he
  soon began to assert his own position among all the boys of his own age and
  standing. No longer crushed and intimidated by bullying and bad companions,
  he was lively, happy, and universally liked, but never happier than when
  Walter and Power admitted him, as they constantly did, into their own
  society.</p>

  <p>Harpour and Jones, in their hatred against Walter, had an especial reason
  to keep Eden as far as they could under subjection, in addition to their
  general propensity to bully and domineer. They did not care to torment him
  when Walter was present, because with him, in spite of their hostility, they
  felt it wise to maintain an armed neutrality. But whenever Walter was absent,
  they felt themselves safe. None of the other boys in their dormitory
  interfered except Henderson, and his interposition, though always generous,
  was both morally and physically weaker than Walter&rsquo;s. He would not,
  indeed, allow any positive cruelty, but he was not thoughtful or stable
  enough to see the duty of interfering to prevent other and hardly less
  tolerable persecutions.</p>

  <p>It so happened that at a game of cricket Walter by accident had received a
  blow on the knee from the cricket-ball bowled by Franklin, who was a
  tremendously hard and swift bowler. The hurt which this had caused was so
  severe that he was ordered by Dr Keith to sleep on the ground-floor in the
  cottage for a fortnight, in order to save him the exertion of running up and
  down so many stairs. The opportunity of this prolonged absence was
  maliciously seized by the tyrants of Number 10; but Eden bore up far more
  manfully than he had done in the old days. He was quite a different, and a
  far braver little fellow, thanks to Walter, than he had been the term before;
  and, looking forward to his friend&rsquo;s speedy return, he determined to
  bear his troubles without saying a word about them. He was far more bullied
  during this period than Henderson knew of, for some of the threats and
  commands by which he was coerced were given in Henderson&rsquo;s absence, as
  he was allowed to sit up half an hour later than those in the form below. For
  instance, Eden was ordered never to look at a book or to finish learning his
  lessons in the bedroom; and he was strictly forbidden to get up until the
  second bell rang in the morning. If he disobeyed these orders, he was soused
  with water, pelted with shoes, and beaten with slippers, and on the whole he
  found it better to be content to lose place in form, and to get impositions
  for missing chapel, than to attempt to brave these hindrances. When, however,
  he had been late two mornings running, Henderson got the secret out of him,
  and at once entreated Harpour and Jones to abandon this cruelty, throwing out
  hints that if they refused, he would take some measures to get it stopped by
  one of the monitors. If Eden had been plucky enough to embrace his natural
  right of obtaining protection from one of his own schoolfellows in the sixth,
  he would have been efficiently defended. Appealing to a monitor in order to
  secure immunity from disgraceful and wholly intolerable bullying is a very
  different thing from telling a master; and although the worst boys tried to
  get it traditionally regarded as an unmitigated form of sneaking, yet the
  public opinion of the best part of the school would have been found to
  justify it. But the two bullies knew that Eden would never have the heart to
  venture on this appeal; and although they desisted from this particular
  practice at Henderson&rsquo;s request, they knew that he was too wavering a
  character, and too fond of popularity to be <i>easily</i> induced to make
  them his open enemies. If Eden had only told Walter, he knew that Walter
  would have sheltered him from unkindness at all hazards; but he was a
  thoroughly grateful child, and did not wish to get Walter into any
  difficulties on his account. So, in schoolboy phrase, there was nothing left
  for him but to &ldquo;grin and bear it;&rdquo; which he heroically did,
  earnestly longing for Walter&rsquo;s return to the dormitory as for some
  golden age. But his trials were not over yet.</p>

  <p>Is there in human nature an instinctive cruelty? That there is in
  it&mdash;<i>when ill-trained</i>&mdash;an absorbing selfishness, a total
  absence of all tenderness and delicate consideration, is abundantly obvious.
  But besides this, there is often an astonishing and almost incredible
  tendency to take positive pleasure in the infliction of pain. Now it so
  happens that Jones and Harpour were bad boys, as I have shown already, in the
  worst sense of the word, and yet the real <i>enjoyment</i> which they felt in
  making little Eden&rsquo;s life miserable is an inexplicable phenomenon. One
  would have thought that the mere sight of the little boy, his tender age; his
  delicate look, his extreme gentleness and courtesy of manner, and the mute
  appealing glance in his blue eyes, would have sufficed to protect him from
  wanton outrage. It <i>did</i> suffice with most boys; but if anything, it
  added zest and piquancy to the persecutions of those two big bullies.</p>

  <p>Reader, have you ever been &ldquo;taken prisoner?&rdquo; that is to say,
  have you ever been awaked from a sweet sleep by feeling an intolerable agony
  in your right toe, and finding that it is caused by somebody having tied a
  string tight round it without waking you, and then pulling the said string
  with all his force? If not, congratulate yourself thereupon, and accept the
  assurance of one who has undergone it, that the pain caused by this process
  is absolutely excruciating. It was this pain which made Eden start up with a
  scream during one of the nights I speak of, and the cry rose in intensity as
  he grew fully awake to the sensation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hallo! what&rsquo;s the row, Eden?&rdquo; said Henderson, starting
  up in bed; but the child could only continue his screams, and Henderson,
  springing out of bed stumbled against the string, and instantly (for the
  trick was a familiar one) knew what was being done. As quick as thought he
  seized the string with his right-hand and, by pulling it <i>towards</i> Eden,
  slackened the horrible tension of it, while with his left-hand he rapidly
  took out a knife from his coat pocket and cut the cord in two.</p>

  <p>Jones and Harpour, tittering at the success of their machination, were
  standing with the string in their hands just outside the door in the passage,
  and the sudden jerk showed them that the string was severed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,&rdquo; said Henderson to them, with
  the most deliberate emphasis, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you do lick me for
  telling you the truth, but you two are just a couple of the greatest brutes
  in the school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Flip?&rdquo; asked Franklin, from his bed,
  in a drowsy tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Matter! why those two <i>brutes</i>,&rdquo; said Henderson, with
  strong indignation, &ldquo;have been taking poor little Eden prisoner, and
  hurting him awfully.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a confounded shame!&rdquo; said Franklin and Anthony in one
  voice; for they, too, though they were sturdy fellows, had had some
  experience of the bullies in their earlier school days; and of late,
  following Walter&rsquo;s example, they had always energetically opposed this
  maltreatment of Eden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Draw it mild, you three, or we&rsquo;ll kick you,&rdquo; said
  Harpour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t draw it mild,&rdquo; said Franklin;
  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite true; you and Jones <i>are</i> brutes to bully that
  poor little fellow so. He never hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What an uppish lot you nips are,&rdquo; said Harpour;
  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all that fellow Evson&rsquo;s doing. Hang me, if I
  don&rsquo;t take it out of you;&rdquo; and he advanced with a slipper in his
  hand towards Franklin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Touch him if you dare,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;if you do
  Anthony and I will stick by him; and, Cradock, you&rsquo;ll see fair play,
  won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; said Cradock. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m asleep. Fight it out by
  yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind these little fools, Harpour,&rdquo; said Jones;
  &ldquo;they&rsquo;re beneath your notice. Besides, it&rsquo;s time to turn
  off to sleep.&rdquo; For Jones had earned his soubriquet by always showing a
  particularly large white feather when there was any chance of a fray.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Phew, Jones; none of us would give much for <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said
  Henderson contemptuously. &ldquo;<i>Little</i> fools, indeed! You know very
  well that <i>you</i> daren&rsquo;t lay a finger on the least of us, whether
  we&rsquo;re beneath your notice or no. An ostrich is a big bird, but its
  white feathers are chiefly of use in helping it to run away.&rdquo; He went
  to Eden&rsquo;s bedside, for the child was still sobbing with pain, and was
  evidently in a great state of nervous agitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Eden,&rdquo; he said, in a kind and soothing voice;
  &ldquo;think no more of it; we won&rsquo;t let them take you prisoner
  again.&rdquo; And as he spoke he took his place by Eden&rsquo;s side, and
  looked with angry defiance at the two bullies.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those fellows hurt me so,&rdquo; said Eden, in an apologetic tone,
  bravely trying to check his tears. &ldquo;Oh, I wish Evson would come
  back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is coming back in a night or two; his knee is nearly well. I
  haven&rsquo;t helped you enough, poor little fellow. I&rsquo;m so sorry. I
  say, you <i>brutes</i>,&rdquo; he continued, raising his voice, &ldquo;next
  time you bully Eden, I&rsquo;ll tell Somers as sure as fate.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell away then,&rdquo; jeered Harpour; &ldquo;better go and tell
  him before your shoes wear out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ll change your tone, Master Harpour, when
  you&rsquo;ve been well whopped,&rdquo; answered Henderson.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to see Somers or any one else whop me,&rdquo; said
  Harpour, in an extremely &ldquo;Ercles vein&rdquo;; &ldquo;by Jove! Lane
  himself shouldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;oh, indeed,&rsquo; you!&rdquo; said Harpour,
  getting out of bed; but here Cradock interfered, seized Harpour with his
  brawny arm, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s badgering enough for one night. Do let a fellow
  go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harpour got into bed again, and Henderson, once more reassuring Eden that
  he should not be again molested, followed his example. But, half with fright
  and half with pain, the poor boy lay awake most of the night, and when he
  <i>did</i> fall asleep he constantly started up again with troubled
  dreams.</p>

  <p>Next morning the two parties in the dormitory would hardly speak to each
  other. They rose at daggers drawn, and in the highest dudgeon. Henderson was
  glad Anthony and Franklin had openly espoused the right side, and was pleased
  at <i>anything</i> which drew them out of the pernicious influence of the
  other two. This wasn&rsquo;t by any means a pleasant state of things for
  Jones and Harpour, and it made them hate Eden, the innocent cause of it, more
  than ever. Moreover, Harpour who was not accustomed to be openly bearded, did
  not choose to let the reins of despotism slip so easily out of his hands, and
  he determined to avenge himself yet, and to show that neither entreaties nor
  threats should prevent him from being as great a bully as he chose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Understand <i>you</i>, Henderson,&rdquo; he said, while they were
  dressing; &ldquo;that I shall do exactly what I like to that little muff
  there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eden reddened and said nothing; but Henderson, looking up from his wash-
  hand basin, replied&mdash;&ldquo;And understand <i>you</i>, Harpour, that if
  you bully him any more, I&rsquo;ll tell the head of the school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harpour made a spring at Henderson to thrash him for these words, but
  again the burly Cradock interposed by saying, good-humouredly, as he put
  himself in Harpour&rsquo;s way, &ldquo;There, stop squabbling, for
  goodness&rsquo; sake, you two, and let&rsquo;s have a little peace. Flip, you
  shut up.&rdquo;</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">EDEN felt an immeasurable delight when Walter was allowed to
  come back to the dormitory, and now he thought himself happy in a perfect
  security from further torment.</p>

  <p>But the two tyrants had other views. Harpour, at once passionate and
  dogged, was not likely to forget that he had been thwarted and defied; and if
  he had been so inclined, Jones would have not allowed him to do so, but kept
  egging him on to show his contempt for the younger and weaker boys who had
  tried to check his bullying propensities. On the last occasion when he had
  ordered Eden to go to Dan&rsquo;s, Eden had taken Walter&rsquo;s advice, and
  firmly refused to go. Harpour did not think it safe to compel him, but he
  threw out some significant threats, which filled the little boy with vague
  alarm and weighed heavily on his spirits. He did not tell any one of these
  threats, hoping that they would end in nothing, and, in case of any
  emergency, trusting implicitly on Walter for a generous and efficient
  protection.</p>

  <p>But the threats did <i>not</i> end in nothing.</p>

  <p>One night, after the others had fallen asleep, Eden, feeling quite free
  from all anxiety, was sleeping more soundly and sweetly than he had done for
  a fortnight, when a blaze of light, flashing suddenly upon his eyes, made him
  start up in his bed. Harpour and Jones were taking this opportunity to fulfil
  their threat of frightening him. At the foot of his bed stood a figure in
  white, with a hideous, deformed head, blotched with scarlet; bending over him
  was another white figure, with an enormous black face, holding over its head
  a shining hand.</p>

  <p>In an instant the boy fell back, pale as death, uttering a shriek so
  shrill and terrible, so full of wildness and horror, that every other boy in
  the dormitory sprang up, alarmed and wide awake.</p>

  <p>Walter and Henderson leaped out of bed immediately; and to Walter, who was
  unprepared, the start of surprise at what he saw was so sudden, that for a
  moment he stood absolutely paralysed and bewildered, because the shock on the
  nerves had preceded the recognition, though by an infinitesimally short time.
  But Henderson, who knew how Jones and Harpour had been going on, and what
  their threats had been, instantly, and before the abrupt and unusual
  spectacle had power to unnerve him, saw the true state of the case, and,
  springing out upon the figure which stood at the end of Eden&rsquo;s bed,
  tore the mask away, stripped off the sheet, and displayed Jones&rsquo;s face
  before he had time to hide it, administering, as he did so, a hearty blow on
  Jones&rsquo;s chest, which made that hero stagger several paces back.</p>

  <p>Although Walter saw almost at once the trick that was being played with
  masks, sheets, and phosphorus, yet the sudden shock upon his nerves not being
  <i>absolutely co-instantaneous</i> with the discovery, produced on him the
  effect of utter dizziness and horror. Henderson&rsquo;s prompt and vigorous
  onslaught aroused him to a sense of the position, and with a fierce
  expression of disgust and anger, he bounded upon Harpour, who, being thus
  suddenly attacked, dropped upon the floor the dark lantern which he held, and
  hastily retreated, flinging the sheet over Walter&rsquo;s head.</p>

  <p>Walter had barely disentangled himself from the folds of the sheet, when
  an exclamation from Henderson attracted the notice of all the boys in the
  room, and brought them flocking round Eden&rsquo;s bed. Henderson had picked
  up the dark lantern, and was kneeling with it over the unconscious boy, whose
  face was so ashy white, and who, after several sharp screams, had sunk into
  so deep a swoon, that Henderson, unused to such sights, naturally
  exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God! you&rsquo;ve killed him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Killed him?&rdquo; repeated the others, standing aghast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh! he&rsquo;s only fainted, you little fools,&rdquo; said Jones,
  who hurried up to look in Eden&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Here, we&rsquo;ll soon
  bring him too; Harpour, just get us some water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t touch him, you shan&rsquo;t come near him,&rdquo;
  said Walter furiously; &ldquo;stand back, you hateful bullies. Henderson and
  I will attend to him; and, depend upon it, you shall give account for this
  soon. What! you <i>will</i> come?&rdquo; he continued, shaking Jones&rsquo;s
  arm violently, and then flinging him back as easily as though he had been a
  child; &ldquo;if either you or Harpour come near the bed I&rsquo;ll fetch
  Robertson instantly. Eden would go off again in a swoon, if he saw such
  brutes as you when he recovered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In such a mood Walter was not to be resisted. The two plotters, picking up
  their masks, retired somewhat crestfallen, and sat down on their beds, while
  the rest, with the utmost tenderness, adopted every means they knew to recall
  Eden&rsquo;s fluttered and agitated senses.</p>

  <p>But his swoon was deeper than they could manage, and, growing too
  violently alarmed to trust themselves any longer, Henderson and Walker
  proposed to carry him to the sickroom, and put him at once under the care of
  Dr Keith. It was in vain that Jones and Harpour entreated, threatened,
  implored them to delay a little longer, lest by taking Eden to the sickroom,
  their doings should be discovered. Wholly disregarding all they said, the two
  boys uplifted their still fainting friend, and when Harpour attempted to
  interfere between them and the door, Cradock and Franklin, now
  <i>thoroughly</i> sickened by their proceedings, pulled him aside and let
  them pass.</p>

  <p>Dr Keith instantly administered to Eden a restorative, and after receiving
  from Walter a hurried explanation of the circumstances, gently told the boys
  that they would be only in the way there, that Eden was evidently in a
  critical position, and that they had better return at once to their
  dormitories.</p>

  <p>Walter and Henderson, when they returned, were assailed by the others with
  eager inquiries, to which they could only give gloomy and uncertain answers.
  They would not vouchsafe to take the slightest notice of Jones or Harpour,
  but met all their remarks with resolute silence. But before he went to sleep,
  Walter said, &ldquo;I may as well let you fellows know that I intend to
  report you to Somers to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be a damned sneak,&rdquo; observed Harpour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is not sneaking to prevent brutal bullying like yours, by giving
  others the chance of stopping it, and preventing little chaps like poor Eden,
  whom you&rsquo;ve nearly frightened to death, from being so shamefully
  treated. Anyhow, sneaking, or not, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you do tell Somers, look out for yourself&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; was the brief retort.</p>

  <p>Harpour knew that he meant what he said, and, being now desperate, he got
  up half an hour earlier next morning to try and extort from him, by main
  force, a promise to hold his tongue about the affair of the night before. If
  he had at all understood Walter&rsquo;s character, he might have saved
  himself this very superfluous trouble.</p>

  <p>Walter was awakened by a shake from Harpour, who, with Jones, was standing
  by his head. He saw what was coming, for Harpour, who had a pair of braces
  tightly knotted in his hand, briefly opened the proceedings by saying,
  &ldquo;Are you going to sneak about me, or not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To sneak&mdash;no; to tell the head of the
  school&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, by Jove, you shall have something worth telling; I&rsquo;ll
  take my revenge out of you beforehand. I shall be sent away&mdash;think of
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So much the better. One bully the less.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s your tune? Take that.&rdquo; The buckle of the
  brace descended sharply on Walter&rsquo;s back, drawing blood; the next
  instant he had wrested it out of Harpour&rsquo;s hand, and returned the
  blow.</p>

  <p>The scuffle had awakened the rest. Walter jumped out of bed, and was
  hurrying on his trousers and slippers, when Harpour knocked him down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fair play, Harpour,&rdquo; said Henderson and Franklin, angrily
  seizing Harpour&rsquo;s arms; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re surely not going to fight
  him, Walter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; see fair play, you fellows; Cradock, you will, won&rsquo;t
  you? Fair play is all I want. Flip, you see that Jones tries no mean dodge.
  Now, Harpour, are you ready? Then take that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter hit him a steady blow in the face, and the fight between these
  unequally-matched combatants&mdash;a boy not fifteen against a much stronger
  boy of seventeen&mdash;began. The result could not be dubious. Walter fought
  with indomitable pluck; it was splendid to see the sturdiness with which he
  bore up under the blows of Harpour&rsquo;s strong fist, which he could only
  return at intervals. He was tremendously punished, while Harpour was barely
  touched, except by one well-directed blow which flashed the fire out of his
  eyes. At last he dealt Walter a heavy blow full on the forehead; the boy
  reeled, caught hold of the wash-hand stand to stay his fall and dragged it
  after him on the floor with a thundering crash, dashing the jug and basin all
  to shivers.</p>

  <p>The smash brought in Mr Robertson, whose rooms were nearest to Number 10.
  He opened his eyes in amazement as he came in. On one of the beds lay the two
  masks and dark lantern which had been used to frighten Eden; on the floor,
  supported by Franklin and Henderson, sat poor Walter, his nose streaming with
  blood, and his face horribly bruised and disfigured; Harpour sheepishly
  surveyed his handiwork; and Jones, on the first alarm, had rushed back to
  bed, covered himself with blankets, and lay to all appearance fast
  asleep.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Evson! what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; asked the master in
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>Walter, sick and giddy, was in no condition to answer; but the position of
  affairs was tolerably obvious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this <i>your</i> doing?&rdquo; asked Mr Robertson of Harpour,
  very sternly, pointing to Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hit me first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Liar,&rdquo; said Henderson, glaring up at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, sir; no such language in my presence,&rdquo; said Mr
  Robertson. &ldquo;Cradock, do you mean to say that a big fellow like you
  could stand by, and see Harpour thus cruelly misuse a boy not nearly his
  size.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was a fight, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fight!&rdquo; said Mr Robertson; &ldquo;look at those two boys, and
  don&rsquo;t talk nonsense to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have let them fight, I know,&rdquo; said
  Cradock; &ldquo;and I wish, sir, you&rsquo;d put Harpour and Jones into
  another room, they&rsquo;re always bullying Eden, and it was for him that
  Evson fought.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Harpour,&rdquo; said Mr Robertson, &ldquo;you are absolutely
  despicable; a viler figure than you present at this moment could not be
  conceived. I shall move you to another dormitory, where some monitor can
  restrain your brutality; and, meanwhile, I confine you to gates for a month,
  and you will bring me up one hundred lines every day till further
  notice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was leaving the room, but catching sight of Walter, he returned, and
  said kindly, &ldquo;Evson, my poor boy, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re sadly
  hurt; I&rsquo;m truly sorry for you; you seem to have been behaving in a very
  noble way, and I honour you. Henderson, I think you&rsquo;d better go with
  him to Dr Keith,&rdquo; he continued; for Walter, though he heard what was
  said, was too much hurt and shaken to speak a word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, Walter,&rdquo; said Henderson, gently helping him to rise;
  &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not very much hurt, old fellow. That brute Harpour
  won&rsquo;t trouble you again, anyhow; nor his parasite Jones. Lean on my
  arm. Franklin, you come and give Walter your arm, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They helped him to the sickroom, for he could barely trail his legs after
  him. Dr Keith laid him down quietly on a sofa, put some arnica to the bruises
  on his face, and told him to lie still and go quietly to sleep. &ldquo;He is
  not very much hurt,&rdquo; he said, in answer to the inquiries of the boys;
  &ldquo;but the fall he has had is quite sufficiently serious in its
  consequences to render absolute rest necessary to him for some days. You may
  come and see him sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now, you fellow, Harpour,&rdquo; said Henderson, re-entering
  the dormitory; &ldquo;as you&rsquo;ve knocked up Evson, and half killed Eden,
  <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> tell Somers. Do you hear? and I hope he&rsquo;ll thrash you
  till you can&rsquo;t stand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He daren&rsquo;t; Robertson&rsquo;s punished me already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He dare, and will; you won&rsquo;t get off so lightly as all
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a set of sneaks; and I&rsquo;ll be even with you
  yet,&rdquo; growled Harpour, too much cowed to resent Henderson&rsquo;s
  defiance.</p>

  <p>Henderson laughed scornfully; and Cradock said, &ldquo;And
  <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> tell the whole school what bullies you&rsquo;ve been,
  Harpour and Jones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And <i>I</i>,&rdquo; said Franklin; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t envy you
  two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The school doesn&rsquo;t consist altogether of such softs as your
  lot, luckily,&rdquo; answered Harpour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Softs or not, we&rsquo;ve put a spoke in <i>your</i> wheel for the
  present,&rdquo; answered Franklin. &ldquo;I congratulate you on the rich
  black eye which one of the softs, half your size, has given you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not worth snarling with, Franklin,&rdquo; said
  Henderson; &ldquo;we shall be rid of him and Jones from Number 10 henceforth;
  that&rsquo;s one blessing.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XXVI. &mdash; A TURBULENT SCHOOL MEETING</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>I hate when vice can bolt her arguments,<br>
    And virtue have no tongue to check her pride.</i><br>
    &mdash;Milton&rsquo;s Comus.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">NEXT morning, after second school, Power went to see how
  Eden and Walter were getting on. He opened the door softly, and they did not
  observe his entrance.</p>

  <p>Eden, very pale, and with an expression of pain and terror still reflected
  in his face, lay in a broken and restless sleep. Walter was sitting as still
  as death at the head of the bed. A book lay on his knees, but he had not been
  reading. He was in a &ldquo;brown study,&rdquo; and the dreamy far-off look
  with which his eyes were fixed upon vacancy showed how his thoughts had
  wandered. It was the same look which attracted Power&rsquo;s attention when
  he first saw Walter in chapel, and which had shown him that he was no common
  boy. It often made him watch Walter, and wonder what <i>could</i> be
  occupying his thoughts.</p>

  <p>It was looking at poor little Eden that had suggested to Walter&rsquo;s
  mind the train of thought into which he had fallen. As he saw the child
  tossing uneasily about, waking every now and then to half-consciousness with
  a violent start, occasionally delirious, and to all appearances seriously
  ill&mdash;as he thought over Dr Keith&rsquo;s remark, that even when he was
  quite well again his nervous system would be probably found to have received
  a shock of which the effects would <i>never</i> be obliterated during life,
  he could not help fretting very bitterly over the injury and suffering of his
  friend. And his own spirits were greatly shaken. It was of little matter that
  every time he raised his hand to cool his forehead, or ease the throbbing of
  his head, he felt how much he was bruised, cut, and swollen, or that the
  looking-glass showed him a face so hideously disfigured; he knew that this
  would grow right in a day or two, and he cared nothing for it. But when
  Harpour&rsquo;s blow knocked him down, he had dashed his head with some
  violence on the floor, and this had hurt him so much and made him feel so
  ill, that Dr Keith was not without secret fears about the possibility of a
  concussion of the brain. Yet all the sorrow which Walter now felt was for
  Eden, and he was not thinking of himself.</p>

  <p>He was mentally staring face to face at the mystery of human cruelty and
  malice. The little boy, whose fine qualities so few besides himself had
  discovered, was lying before him in pain and nervous prostration, solely
  because malignant unkindness seemed to give pleasure to two bad, brutal
  fellows. Walter had himself rescued Eden by his consistent kindness from
  being bullied, corrupted, tormented&mdash;yet apparently to little purpose.
  That the poor boy&rsquo;s powers would be decidedly injured by this last
  prank, was certain. Dr Keith had dropped mysterious hints, and Walter had
  himself heard how wild and incoherent were Eden&rsquo;s murmurs. If he should
  become an idiot? O God! that men and boys should have <i>such</i> hearts!</p>

  <p>And then and there Walter, while yet a boy, solemnly and consciously
  recorded an unspoken vow that <i>he</i> at least, till death, would do all
  that lay in his own power to lighten, not to increase, the sum of human
  misery; that he would study all things that were kind, and gentle, and
  tender-hearted, in his dealings with others; that he would ever be on the
  watch against wounding thoughts, and uncharitable judgments, and unkind
  deeds; above all, that he would strive with all his power against the
  temptation to cutting and sarcastic words, against calumny, and
  misrepresentation, against envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness.
  These were the noble thoughts and high resolves which were passing through
  the boy&rsquo;s mind when Power&rsquo;s quiet footstep entered the room.</p>

  <p>Power stopped for a minute to look at the somewhat saddening picture in
  the darkened room&mdash;Walter, still as death, deep in thought, his chin
  leaning on his hand, and his face presenting an uncouth mixture of shapes and
  colours as he sat by Eden&rsquo;s bedside; and Eden turning and moaning in an
  unrefreshing sleep.</p>

  <p>Walter started from his reverie and smiled, as Power noiselessly
  approached.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My poor Walter, how marked you are!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind, it&rsquo;s nothing. I had a good cause, and
  it&rsquo;s done good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor fellow! But how&rsquo;s Arty? He looks wretchedly
  ill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a sad way I&rsquo;m afraid, Power,&rdquo; said
  Walter, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll be all right soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I hope so; but we shall have to take great care of
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor child, poor child!&rdquo; said Power, bending over him
  compassionately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has Flip told Somers of Harpour?&rdquo; asked Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you are quite up to hearing school news
  yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O yes! tell me all about it,&rdquo; said Walter eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve no good news to tell. It&rsquo;s a case of
  <i>ponos ponoo ponon pherei</i>, as Percival said when I told him about you
  and Eden. By the by, he sent all sorts of kind messages, and will come and
  see you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks; but about Harpour?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Flip meant to tell Somers, but the whole thing spread over
  the school at once, before morning chapel was well over; so, Dimock being
  head of Robertson&rsquo;s house, thought it was <i>his</i> place to take it
  up. He sent for Harpour in the classroom, and told him he meant to cane him
  for his abominable, ruffianly conduct; but before he&rsquo;d begun, Harpour
  seized hold of the cane, and wouldn&rsquo;t let it go. Luckily Dimock
  didn&rsquo;t fly into a rage, nor did he let himself down by a fight, which
  Harpour wanted to bring on. He simply let go of the cane quite coolly, and
  said, &lsquo;Very well, Harpour, it would have been a good deal the best for
  you to have taken quietly the caning you so thoroughly deserve; as you
  don&rsquo;t choose to do that, I shall put the matter in Somers&rsquo; hands.
  I&rsquo;m glad to be rid of the responsibility.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did it end there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it; the school are in a ferment. You know the present
  monitors, and particularly Somers, aren&rsquo;t popular; now Harpour
  <i>is</i> popular, although he&rsquo;s such a brute, because he&rsquo;s a
  great swell at cricket and the games. I&rsquo;m afraid we shall have a
  regular monitorial row. The monitors have convened a meeting this morning to
  decide about Harpour; and, to tell you the truth, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if
  the school got up a counter-meeting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t any of the masters know about Eden?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not officially, though I should think some rumours must have got to
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But surely it&rsquo;s very odd that the school should side with
  Jones and Harpour, after the shameful mischief they&rsquo;ve done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Odd, <i> priori</i>; but lots of things always combine to make up
  a school opinion, you know the fellows just catch up what they hear first.
  But who do you think is foremost champion on the school side&mdash;stirring
  them up to resist, abusing you, abusing Flip, abusing the monitors, and
  making light of Harpour&rsquo;s doings?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter asked &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; but he knew beforehand that Power&rsquo;s
  answer would be&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kenrick!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After this he said nothing, but put his hand wearily to his head, which in
  his weak state, was aching violently with the excitement of the news which
  Power had told him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I see, Walter, you&rsquo;re not quite well enough yet to be
  bothered. I&rsquo;ll leave you quiet. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye. Do come again soon, and tell me how things go
  on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Strolling out from the sad sickroom into the court, Power was attracted
  into the great schoolroom by the sound of angry voices. Entering, he found
  half the school, and all the lower forms, collected round the large desk at
  which the headmaster usually sat. A great many were talking at once, and
  every tongue was engaged in discussing the propriety, in this instance, of
  any monitorial interference.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Order, order,&rdquo; shouted one or two of the few fifth-form
  fellows present; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have the thing managed properly.
  Who&rsquo;ll take the chair?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a general call for Kenrick, and as he was one of the highest
  fellows in the room, he got into the chair, and amid a general silence
  delivered his views of the present affair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You all know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Dimock meant to cane
  Harpour because he played off a joke against one of the fellows last night.
  Harpour refused to take the caning, and the monitors are holding a meeting
  this morning to decide what to do about Harpour. Now <i>I</i> maintain that
  they&rsquo;ve no right to do anything; and it&rsquo;s very important that we
  shouldn&rsquo;t let them have just their own way. The thing was merely a
  joke. Who thinks anything of just putting on a mask in fun, to startle
  another fellow? One constantly hears of its being done merely to raise a
  laugh, and we must all have often seen pictures of it. Of course, in this
  case, every one is extremely sorry for the consequences, but it was
  impossible to foresee <i>them</i>, and nobody has any right to judge of the
  act because it has turned out so unluckily. I vote that we put the
  question&mdash;&lsquo;Have the monitors any right to
  interfere?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Loud applause greeted the end of Kenrick&rsquo;s speech, and the little
  bit at the end about separating an act from its consequences told wonderfully
  among the boys. They raised an almost unanimous cry of &ldquo;Well done,
  Ken,&rdquo; &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; &ldquo;Harpour shan&rsquo;t be
  caned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Henderson had been watching Kenrick with an expression of intense anger
  and disdain. At the end of his remarks, he sprang, rather than rose, up and
  immediately began to pour out an impetuous answer. His first words, before
  the fellows had observed that he meant to speak, were drowned in the general
  uproar; and when they had all caught sight of him, an expression of decided
  disapprobation ran round the throng of listeners. It did not make him swerve
  in the slightest degree. Looking round scornfully and steadily, he
  said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know why some of you hiss. You think I told Dimock of Harpour. As
  it happens I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i>; but I&rsquo;m neither afraid nor ashamed to
  tell you all, as I told Harpour to his face, that I had fully intended to do
  it&mdash;or rather I meant to tell, not Dimock, but Somers. <i>Will</i> you
  let me speak?&rdquo; he asked, angrily, as his last sentence was interrupted
  by a burst of groans, commenced by a few of those whose interests were most
  at stake, and taken up by the mass of ignorant boys.</p>

  <p>Power plucked Henderson by the sleeve, and whispered, &ldquo;Hush, Flip;
  go on, but keep your temper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve as much right to speak&mdash;if this is meant for a
  school meeting&mdash;as Kenrick or any one else; and what I have to say is
  this: Kenrick has been merely throwing dust into your eyes, misleading you
  altogether about the true state of the case. It&rsquo;s all very fine, and
  very easy for him to talk so lightly of its being &lsquo;a joke,&rsquo; and
  &lsquo;a bit of fun,&rsquo; and so on; but I should like to ask him whether
  he believes that? and whether he&rsquo;s not just hunting for popularity, and
  mixing up with it a few private spites? and whether he&rsquo;s not thoroughly
  ashamed of himself at this moment? There! you may see that he is,&rdquo;
  continued Henderson, pointing at him; &ldquo;see how he is blushing scarlet,
  and looking the very picture of degradation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here Kenrick started up and most irascibly informed Henderson that he
  wasn&rsquo;t going to sit there and be slanged by him, and that as he was in
  the chair, he would not let Henderson go on any more unless he cut short his
  abuse; and while Kenrick was saying this, in which he entirely carried the
  meeting with him, Power again whispered, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting too
  personal, Flip; but go on, only say no more about Kenrick&mdash;though
  I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s all true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, I will say this,&rdquo; continued Henderson,
  whose flow of words was rather stopped by his having been pulled up so
  often&mdash;&ldquo;and I ought to know, for I was in the room at the time,
  and I appeal to Anthony and Franklin, and all the rest of the dormitory, to
  say if it isn&rsquo;t true. It <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> a joke. It wasn&rsquo;t
  <i>meant</i> for a joke. It was a piece of deliberate,
  diabolical&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; began a few of Harpour&rsquo;s claqueurs, and
  the chorus was again swelled by a score of others.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I repeat it&mdash;of deliberate, diabolical cruelty, chosen just
  because there was nothing more cruel they dared to do. And,&rdquo; he said,
  speaking at the top of his voice, to make himself heard over the clamour,
  &ldquo;the fellows who did it are a disgrace to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, and
  they deserve to be caned by the monitors, if any fellows ever did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sat down amid a storm of disapprobation, but his look never quailed for
  an instant, as he glanced steadily round, and noticed how Kenrick, though in
  favour with the multitude, and so much higher in the school, did not venture
  to meet his eye. And he was more than compensated for the general disfavour,
  by feeling Power&rsquo;s hand rest on his shoulder, and hearing him whisper,
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>famous</i>, Flip; you&rsquo;re a dear plucky fellow.
  Walter himself couldn&rsquo;t have done it more firmly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Belial-like, rose Mackworth, perfectly at his ease, intending as much
  general mischief as lay in his power, and bent on saying as many unpleasant
  things as he could. In this, however, his benevolent views were materially
  frustrated by Henderson, who made his contemptuous comments in a tone
  sufficiently loud to be heard by many, and quite distinctly enough to
  disconcert Mackworth&rsquo;s oratory.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As the gentleman who has just sat down has poured so many bottles
  of wrath&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bottles of French varnish,&rdquo; suggested
  Henderson&mdash;&ldquo;on our heads generally, I must be allowed to make a
  few remarks in reply. His speech consisted of nothing but rabid abuse;
  without a shred of argument.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Rabid fact without a shred
  of fudge,&rdquo; interpolated Henderson.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If for every trifling freak fellows were to be telling the
  monitors, we had better inaugurate at once the era of sneaks and
  cowards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Era of sham polish and fiddlestick ends,&rdquo; echoed Henderson;
  and Mackworth, who had every intention of making a very flourishing speech,
  was so disconcerted by this unwonted pruning of his periods, that he somewhat
  abruptly sat down, muttering anathemas on Henderson, and flustered quite out
  of his usual bland manner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Something has been said about cowardice and sneaking,&rdquo; said
  Whalley, getting up. &ldquo;I should like to know whether you think it more
  cowardly to fight a fellow twice one&rsquo;s size, and to mark him pretty
  considerably too&rdquo; (a remark which Whalley unceremoniously emphasised by
  pointing at Harpour&rsquo;s black eye), &ldquo;or to lay a plot to frighten
  in the dark a mere child, very nervous and very timid, who has never harmed
  any one in his life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Next, Howard Tracy, addressing the meeting, running his hand occasionally
  through his hair, &ldquo;would put the question on a different footing
  altogether. As to what had been done to Eden, he stood on neutral ground, and
  gave no opinion. But who, he asked, were these monitors that they should
  thrash <i>any one at all</i>? He had never heard that they were of
  particularly good families, or that they had anything whatever which gave
  them a claim to interfere with other fellows. The question was, whether a
  parcel of monitors were to domineer over the school?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The question was nothing of the kind!&rdquo; said Franklin very
  bluntly; &ldquo;it was, whether big bullies, like Harpour, were to be at
  perfect liberty to frighten fellows into idiots or beat them into mummies, at
  their own will and pleasure? That was the only question. Harpour or
  Somers&mdash;bullies or monitors&mdash;which will you have, boys?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And after this arose a perfect hubbub of voices. Some got up and ridiculed
  the monitors; others extolled Harpour, and tried to make out that he was
  misused for being called to account for a mere frolic; others taunted Evson
  and Henderson with a conspiracy against their private enemies. On the whole,
  they were nearly unanimous in agreeing that the school should prevent the
  monitors from any exercise of their authority.</p>

  <p>And then, in the midst of the hubbub, Power rose, &ldquo;in act more
  graceful,&rdquo; and there was an immediate and general call for silence. To
  the great majority of the boys, Power was hardly known except by name and by
  sight; but his school successes, his rare ability, his stainless character,
  and many personal advantages, commanded for him the highest admiration. His
  numerous slight acquaintances in the school all liked his pleasant and
  playful courtesy, and were proud to know him; his few friends entertained for
  him an almost extravagant affection. His ancient name, his good family, and
  the respect due to his high position in the school, would alone have been
  sufficient to gain him a favourable hearing; but, besides this, he had
  hitherto come forward so little, that there was a strong curiosity to see
  what line he would take, and how he would be able to speak. There were indeed
  a few who were most anxious to silence him as quickly as possible, knowing
  what effect his words would be likely to produce; and when he began, they
  raised several noisy interruptions; but Kenrick, for very shame, was obliged
  at first to demand for him the attention which, after the first sentence or
  two, his quiet, conciliatory, and persuasive manner effectually secured.</p>

  <p>Reviewing the whole tumultuary discussion, he began by answering Kenrick.
  After alluding to the long course of bullying which had been ended in this
  manner, he appealed to the common sense of the meeting whether the thing
  could be regarded as a mere joke, when they remembered Eden&rsquo;s tender
  age and highly susceptible nature? Was it not certain, and must it not have
  been obvious to the bullies, that serious, if not desperately dangerous
  results <i>must</i> follow? What those results had been was well-known, and
  in describing what he had seen of them in the sickroom only half an hour
  before, Power made a warm appeal to their feelings of pity and
  indignation&mdash;an appeal which every one felt to be manly, and which could
  not fail of being deeply touching, because it was both simple and
  natural.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Power, &ldquo;the next speaker talked about
  sneaking and cowardice. Well, those charges had been sufficiently answered by
  Whalley, and, indeed, on behalf of his friends Evson and Henderson, he
  perhaps need hardly condescend to answer them at all. His friend Henderson
  had been long enough among them to need no defence, and if he <i>did</i>, it
  would be sufficiently supplied by the high courage, of which they had just
  seen a specimen. As for Evson, any boy who had given as many proofs of honour
  and manliness as <i>he</i> had done during his two terms at Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s, certainly required no one&rsquo;s shield to be thrown over
  <i>him</i>. Would any of them show their courage by walking across the Razor
  on some dark foggy winter&rsquo;s night? and would they find in the school
  any other fellow of Evson&rsquo;s age who would not shrink from standing up
  in a regular fair fight with another of twice his own strength and size?
  Those charges he thought he might throw to the winds; he was sure that no one
  believed them; but there was, he admitted, one cowardice of which his two
  friends had often been guilty, and it was a cowardice for which they need not
  blush; he meant the cowardice, the arrant, the noble cowardice of being
  afraid <i>not</i> to do what they thought right, and of being afraid to do
  what they <i>knew</i> to be base and wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In these remarks Power quite carried his audience away with him; the
  strain was of a higher mood than boys had often heard from boys, and it was
  delivered with an eloquence and earnestness that raised a continuous
  applause. This, however, Power checked by going on speaking until he was
  obliged to stop and take breath; but <i>then</i> it burst out in the most
  unmistakable and enthusiastic manner, and entirely drowned the few and timid
  counter-demonstrations of the Jones and Mackworth school.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now I have detained you too long,&rdquo; said Power, &ldquo;and I
  apologise for it (Go on! go on! shouted the boys); but as so <i>many</i> have
  spoken on the other side, and so few on this, perhaps you will excuse me
  (Yes, yes!) Well, then, Tracy has asked, &lsquo;Who are the monitors? and
  what right have they to interfere?&rsquo; I answer, that the monitors are our
  schoolfellows, and are simply representatives of the most mature form of
  public school opinion. They have all been lower boys; they have all worked
  their way up to the foremost place; they are, in short, the oldest, the
  cleverest, the strongest, and the wisest among us; And their right depends on
  an authority voluntarily delegated to them by the masters, by our parents,
  and by ourselves&mdash;a right originally founded on justice and common
  sense, and venerable by very many years of prestige and of success. At any
  rate, a fellow who behaves as Harpour has done, has the <i>least</i> right to
  complain of this exercise of a higher authority. If he had a right&mdash;and
  he has no right except brute strength, if that be a right&mdash;to bully,
  beat, torment, and perhaps injure for life a poor little inoffensive child,
  and by doing so to render the name of the school infamous, I maintain that
  the monitors, who have the interest of the school most at heart, who are
  ranged <i>ex officio</i> on the side of truth, of justice, and of honour,
  have infinitely more right to thrash him for it. Supposing that there were no
  monitors, what would the state of the school be? above all, what would be the
  condition of the younger and weaker boys? they would be the absolutely
  defenceless prey of a most odious tyranny. Let me say then, that I most
  distinctly and emphatically approve of the manner in which my friends have
  acted; that I envy and admire the moral courage which helped them to behave
  as they did; and that if the school attempts on this occasion to resist the
  legitimate and most wholesome exercise of the monitors&rsquo; power, it will
  suffer a deep disgrace and serious loss. I oppose Kenrick&rsquo;s motion with
  every feeling of my heart, and with every sentiment of my mind. I think it
  dangerous, I think it useless, and I think it <i>most unjust</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A second burst of applause followed Power&rsquo;s energetic words, and
  continued for several minutes. He had utterly changed the opinions of many
  who were present, and Kenrick felt his entire sympathy and admiration
  enlisted on behalf of his former friend. He would at the moment have given
  anything to get up and retract his previous remarks and beg pardon for them.
  But his pride and passion were too strong for him, and coldly rising, he put
  it to the meeting, &ldquo;whether they decided that the monitors had the
  right to interfere or not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jones, Mackworth, Harpour, and others, were eagerly canvassing for votes,
  and when Kenrick demanded a show of hands, a good many were raised on their
  side. When the opposite question was put, at first only Power, Henderson,
  Whalley, and Franklin held up their hands; but they were soon followed by
  Bliss, then by Anthony and Cradock, and then by a great many more who took
  courage when they saw what champions were on their side. The hands were
  counted, and there was found to be an equal number on both sides. The
  announcement was received with dead silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The chairman of course has a casting vote,&rdquo; said
  Mackworth.</p>

  <p>Kenrick sat still for a moment, not without an inward conflict; and then,
  afraid to risk his popularity with those whom he had now adopted as his own
  set, he said, rising&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I give it <i>against</i> the right of the monitors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A scene of eager partisanship and loud triumph ensued, during which Power
  once more stood forward, and observed&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must allow me to remind you that the present meeting in no way
  represents the sense of the school. I do not see a dozen boys present who are
  above the lowest fifth-form; and I do earnestly entreat those who have gained
  this vote not to disturb the peace and comfort of the school by attempting a
  collision between themselves and the monitors, who will certainly be
  supported by the nearly unanimous opinion of the upper fifth
  forms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see about that,&rdquo; answered Kenrick in a confident
  tone. &ldquo;At any rate, the vote is carried.&rdquo; He left the chair, and
  the boys broke up into various groups, still eagerly discussing the rights
  and wrongs of the question which had been stirred.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>So</i>, Power,&rdquo; said Kenrick, with a sneer, which he
  assumed to hide his real feelings, &ldquo;all your fine eloquence is thrown
  away, you see. We&rsquo;ve carried the day after all, in spite of
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Ken,&rdquo; said Power, gently; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve carried it
  <i>quocunque modo</i>. How comes Kenrick to be on the same side as Jones,
  Mackworth, and Harpour?&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XXVII. &mdash; THE MONITORS</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>In the teeth of clenched antagonisms.</i><br>
    &mdash;Tennyson.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">THE meeting over, Henderson, who had not seen Walter since
  the morning, flew up to the sickroom to tell him the news, which he was sure
  would specially interest him. As he entered, the same spectacle was before
  him which Power had already seen&mdash;little Eden restless, and sometimes
  wandering&mdash;Walter seated silently by the bed watching him, his legs
  crossed, and his hands clasped over one knee. The curtains were drawn to
  exclude the glare. Walter could read but little, for his eyes were weak after
  the fight; but his thoughts and his nursing of his little friend kept him
  occupied. Henderson, fresh from the excitement of the meeting, was struck
  with the deep contrast presented by this painfully quiet scene.</p>

  <p>He was advancing eagerly, but Walter rose with his finger on his lip, and
  spoke to him in a whisper, for Eden had just dropped off to sleep.</p>

  <p>Henderson shook him warmly by the hand, and
  whispered&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve such lots to tell you;&rdquo; and, sitting
  down by Walter, he gave him an account of what had just taken place.
  &ldquo;You should have heard Power, Walter; upon my word he spoke like an
  orator, and regularly bowled the Harpour lot off their legs. It&rsquo;s
  splendid to see him coming out so in the school&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is indeed; and thanks to you, too, Flip, for sticking up for
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what I did was nothing. But only fancy that fellow Kenrick
  fighting against us like this, and giving his casting vote against
  Harpour&rsquo;s being thrashed! You&rsquo;ve no idea, Walter, how that
  fellow&rsquo;s changed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was interrupted, for Eden woke with a short scream, and, starting up in
  bed, looked round with a scared expression, shuddering and moaning as he fell
  back again on his pillow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t frighten me,&rdquo; he
  said appealingly, while the perspiration burst out over his pale face;
  &ldquo;please, Harpour, <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t. Oh, Walter, Walter,
  <i>do</i> help me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, my poor, little fellow, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; said Walter
  tenderly, as he smoothed his pillow; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid, Arty,
  you&rsquo;re quite safe, and I&rsquo;m staying with you. They only put on
  masks to frighten you; it was nothing but that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bending over the bed, he talked to him in a gentle, soothing voice, and
  tried to make him feel at ease, while the child flung both his arms round his
  neck, sobbing, and still clung tight to his hand when Walter had succeeded in
  allaying the sudden paroxysm of terror.</p>

  <p>Henderson, deeply touched, had looked on with glistening eyes. &ldquo;How
  kind you are, Walter,&rdquo; he said, taking his other hand, and
  affectionately pressing it. &ldquo;I should just like to have Kenrick here,
  and show him what his new friends have done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be indignant against him, Flip. I wish, indeed, he
  would but come into this room, and make it up with us, and be what he once
  was. But he did not even take the slightest notice of the letter I wrote him,
  entreating him to overlook any fault I had been guilty of, however
  unconsciously. I never meant to wrong him, and I love him as much as
  ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Love him!&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t; his
  new line isn&rsquo;t half to my fancy. He must be jolly miserable,
  that&rsquo;s one comfort.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush! he <i>was</i> our friend, Flip, remember; indeed, <i>I</i>
  feel as a friend to him still, whatever his feelings are for <i>me</i>. But
  why do you think he must be miserable?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because you can see in his face and manner, that all the while he
  knows he&rsquo;s in the wrong, and is thoroughly ashamed at
  bottom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hope he&rsquo;ll come round again all the sooner.
  Have you broken with him, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, nearly. We are barely civil to each other, that&rsquo;s all,
  and I don&rsquo;t suppose we shall be even that now: for I pitched into him
  to-day at the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter only sighed, and just then Power stole into the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Flip, I believe you and I shall kill
  the invalids between us. I just met Dr Keith on the stairs, and he only gave
  me leave to come for five minutes, for he says they both need quiet. You, I
  suspect, Master Flip, took French leave.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; said Henderson, laughing, &ldquo;considering
  that this is your <i>second</i> visit, and only my first. I&rsquo;ve been
  telling Walter about the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The credit&mdash;if there is any&mdash;is yours, Flip; you broke
  the ice, and showed the Harpourites that they weren&rsquo;t going to carry it
  all their own way, as they fancied.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you came out strong, Power,&rdquo; said Walter;
  &ldquo;Flip says you took them all by storm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Flip&rsquo;s humbug,&rdquo; said Power;
  &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;if I did any good, it&rsquo;s all
  through you, Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, first of all, I wasn&rsquo;t going to hear animals like
  Mackworth abuse you; and next, but for you I should have continued my old
  selfish way of keeping aloof from all school concerns. It cost me an effort
  to conquer my shyness, but I remembered our old talk on Appenfell,
  Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter smiled gratefully, and Power continued, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve come
  to tell you both a bit of news.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; they asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a notice on the board, signed by Somers, to say
  that &lsquo;All the school are requested to stay in their places after the
  master has left the room at two o&rsquo;clock calling-over.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whew! what a row we shall have!&rdquo; said Henderson.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How I wish I were well enough to be out now,&rdquo; said Walter.
  &ldquo;I hate to be shut up while all this is going on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor fellow, with <i>that</i> face?&rdquo; said Power. &ldquo;No;
  you must be content to wait and get well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the face that keeps me in, Power; it&rsquo;s the
  bang on the head, Keith says.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and Keith says that he doesn&rsquo;t know when you <i>will</i>
  be well if these young chatterboxes stay with you,&rdquo; said the
  good-humoured doctor, entering at the moment. &ldquo;Vanish both of
  you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boys smiled and bade Walter good-bye, as they wished him speedy relief
  from Dr Keith&rsquo;s prison. &ldquo;And when do you think poor little Eden
  may come and sit in my study again?&rdquo; asked Power. &ldquo;I miss him
  very much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think of that for a long time,&rdquo; answered
  the doctor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How about this two o&rsquo;clock affair?&rdquo; said Henderson, as
  they left the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upon my word I don&rsquo;t know. Sit next to me, Flip, in case of a
  row.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are the monitors strong enough, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The school was in a fever of excitement and curiosity. At dinner-time
  nothing else was talked of by the lower boys, but the upper forms kept a
  dignified silence.</p>

  <p>Two o&rsquo;clock came. The names of all the school were called over, and
  amid perfect silence the master of the week left the hall. Then Somers stood
  up in the das and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Harpour here?&mdash;the rest please to keep their
  places.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here&mdash;what do you want of <i>me</i>?&rdquo; said
  Harpour sulkily, as he stood up in his place.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;First of all, I want to tell you before the whole school that you
  have been behaving in the most shamefully cruel and blackguard way, and in a
  way that has produced disastrous consequences to one of the little fellows. A
  big fellow like you ought to be <i>thoroughly</i> ashamed of such conduct. If
  you were capable of a blush you ought to blush for it. It is our duty as
  monitors, and my duty as Head of the school, to punish you for this conduct,
  as Dr Lane has left it in our hands; and I am going to cane you for it. Stand
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll see you damned first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A sensation ran through the school at this open defiance; but Somers,
  quite unmoved, repeated&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I take no notice of your words further than to tell you that if you
  swear again you will have an additional punishment; but once again I tell you
  to stand out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harpour quailed a little at his firm tone, and at the total absence of all
  support from his followers; but he again flatly refused to stand out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Somers; &ldquo;you have already defied the
  authority of one monitor, and that is an aggravation of your original
  offence. I should have been glad to have avoided a scene, but if your common
  sense doesn&rsquo;t make you bear the punishment coolly, you shall bear it by
  force. Will you stand out?&mdash;no?&mdash;then you shall be made. Fetch him
  here, some one,&rdquo; he said, turning to the sixth-form.</p>

  <p>The second monitor, Danvers, quietly seized Harpour&rsquo;s right arm, and
  Macon, one of the biggest fellows in the fifth-form, of his own accord got up
  and seized the other, Harpour&rsquo;s heart sank at this, for Danvers and the
  other were with him in the cricket eleven, and he was not as strong as either
  of them singly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now mark,&rdquo; said Somers; &ldquo;caned you <i>shall</i> be, to
  redeem the character of the school; but unless you take it without being
  <i>made</i> to take it, your name shall also be immediately struck off the
  school list, and you shall leave Saint Winifred&rsquo;s this evening.
  You&rsquo;ll be no great loss, I take it. So much I may tell you as a proof
  that the Headmaster has left <i>us</i> to vindicate the name of Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seeing that resistance was useless, Harpour accordingly stood out in the
  centre of the room, but not until he had cast an inquiring look among those
  who embraced his side; and these, who, as we have seen, were tolerably
  numerous, all looked at Kenrick that he might give some hint as to what they
  should do. Thus appealed to, Kenrick rose and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I protest against this caning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Somers, turning contemptuously in that direction;
  &ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The general titter which these words caused made Kenrick furious, and he
  cried out angrily&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is against the opinion of the majority of the school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said Somers, with stinging <i>sang froid</i>;
  &ldquo;meanwhile, you may sit down, and let the majority of the school speak
  for themselves, otherwise you may be requested to occupy a still more
  prominent position. I shall have something to say to <i>you</i>
  presently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rescue him,&rdquo; said Kenrick, springing forward, and
  several fellows stirred in answer to the appeal; but Macon, seizing hold of
  Tracy with one arm, and Mackworth with the other, thrust them both down on
  the floor, and Danvers, catching hold of Kenrick, swung him over the form,
  and pinned him there. The general laugh with which this proceeding was
  received showed that only a small handful of the school were really opposed
  to the monitors, and that most boys thoroughly concurred with them, and held
  them to be in the right. So Macon quietly boxed Jones&rsquo;s ears, since
  Jones was making a noise, and then told him and the others that they might
  return to their places.</p>

  <p>Crimsoned all over with shame and anger, Kenrick sat down, and Somers
  proceeded to administer to Harpour a most severe caning. That worthy quite
  meant to stretch to the utmost his powers of endurance, and made several
  scornful remarks after each of the first blows. But Somers had no intention
  to let him off too easily; each sneer was followed by a harder cut, and the
  remarks were very soon followed by a silent but significant wince. It was not
  until a writhe had been succeeded by a sob, and a sob by a howl, that Somers
  said to him&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you may go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Harpour did go to his seat, in an agony of mingled pain and shame. He
  had boasted repeatedly that he would never take a thrashing from anyone; but
  he <i>had</i> taken it, and succumbed to it, and that too in the presence of
  the whole school. He was tremendously ashamed; he never forgot the scene, and
  determined never to lose an opportunity of revenging it.</p>

  <p>The school felt it to be an act of simple justice, and that the punishment
  was richly deserved. They looked on in stern silence, and those lower boys
  who had in the morning determined to interfere, gazed with some discomfiture
  upon their champion&rsquo;s fall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now, Master Kenrick, <i>you</i> stand here&mdash;what,
  no!&mdash;Stand here, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick only glared defiance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Danvers, hand him here;&rdquo; but Danvers stepped up to Somers and
  whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sharp on him, Somers, or you&rsquo;ll
  drive him to despair. Remember he&rsquo;s high in the fifth, and has been a
  distinguished fellow. Don&rsquo;t make too much of this one
  escapade.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Thanks, Danvers,&rdquo; said Somers; and added aloud, in
  a less sarcastic tone&mdash;&ldquo;Come here, Kenrick; I merely wish to speak
  a word with you;&rdquo; and then Danvers kindly but firmly took the
  boy&rsquo;s hand, and led him forward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You said the majority of the school denied our right to
  interfere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you consider yourself in person to be the majority of the
  school, pray?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We are all perfectly aware, sir, of your meeting, and of your
  precious casting vote. But you must be informed that a rabble of shell and
  fourth-form boys do not constitute the school in any sense of the word. And
  understand too, that even if the majority of the school <i>had</i> been
  against us, we monitors are not quite so ignorant of our solemn duty as to
  make that any reason for letting a brutal and cowardly act of bullying go
  unpunished. You have been very silly, Kenrick, and have been just misled by
  conceit. Yes, you may look angry; but you know me of old; you&rsquo;ve never
  received anything but kindness at my hands since the day you were my fag, and
  I tell you again that you&rsquo;ve just been misled by conceit. Think rather
  less of yourself, my good fellow. You ought to have known better. Your friend
  Power has shown you an infinitely more sensible example. <i>You</i> may sit
  down, sir, with this warning; and, in the name of the monitors, I beg to
  thank the other fellows, especially Evson and Henderson, who did their best
  to protect little Eden. They behaved like thorough gentlemen, and it would be
  well if more of you younger boys were equally alive to the true honour of the
  school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d be more conciliatory,&rdquo; whispered Dimock to
  Danvers; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s plucky and firm, but so very dictatorial and
  unpersuasive. Besides, he&rsquo;s forgotten to thank Power.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Danvers, &ldquo;his tone spoils all.
  Somers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve omitted to mention Power, and the
  fellows will be gone in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking so much, you say it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not I; I&rsquo;m no speaker. Here, Dimock will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;ll do. One minute more, please,&rdquo; called
  Somers, raising his hand to the boys, who, during this rapidly whispered
  conversation, were beginning to leave their places.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somers wishes me to add,&rdquo; said Dimock, &ldquo;that all the
  monitors and many of the sixth and fifth forms wish to express our best
  thanks to Power for the exceedingly honourable and fearless way in which he
  this morning maintained the rights and duties which belong to us. You younger
  fellows know very well that we monitors extremely dislike to interfere, that
  we do so only on the rarest occasions, and that we are always most anxious to
  avoid caning. You know that we never resort to it unless we are obliged to do
  so by the most flagrant offences, which would otherwise sap the honour and
  character of the school. Let us all be united and work together for the good
  of Saint Winifred&rsquo;s. Don&rsquo;t let any interested parties lead you to
  believe that we either do or wish to tyrannise. Our authority is for your
  high and direct advantage; I appeal to you whether you do not know
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Dimock,&rdquo; answered many voices; and before they
  streamed out of the ball, they gave &ldquo;three cheers for the
  monitors,&rdquo; which were so heartily responded to, that the hissing of
  Harpour, Kenrick, and others, only raised a laugh, which filled to the very
  brim the bitter cup of hate and indignation which Kenrick had been forced
  that day to drink. To be addressed like that before the whole
  school&mdash;snubbed, reproved, threatened&mdash;it was intolerable; that he,
  Kenrick, high in the school, brilliant, promising, successful, accustomed
  only to flattery and praise, should be publicly set down among a rabble of
  lower boys&mdash;it made him mad to think of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A nice tell-tale mess you&rsquo;ve made of this business,
  Power,&rdquo; he said savagely, the red spot still lingering on his cheek, as
  he confronted his former friend; &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re ashamed of
  yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I, Ken? no.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you ought to be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Honestly, Ken, who ought to be most ashamed&mdash;you, the advocate
  of Harpour and his set, or I, who merely defended my best friend for behaving
  most honourably&mdash;as he always does?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Always</i>?&rdquo; sneered Kenrick.</p>

  <p>Power turned on him his clear bright eye, and said nothing for a moment;
  but then he laid his arm across his shoulder in the old familiar manner, and
  said, &ldquo;You are not happy now, Ken, as you used to be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why the devil not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Power shook his head. &ldquo;Because your heart is nobler than your acts;
  your nature truer than your conduct; and <i>that</i> is and will be your
  punishment. Why do you nurse this bad feeling till it has so mastered
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick stood still, his cheeks flushed, his eyes downcast; and Power, as
  he turned away, sadly repeated, half to himself the wonderful
  verse&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Virtutem videant, intabescantque relicta.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Kenrick understood it; it came to his heart like an arrow, and rankled
  there; it made a wound, the faithful wound of a friend, better than the
  kisses of an enemy&mdash;but the time of healing was far-off yet.</p>

    Should from the starry sessions of his peers,<br>
    Decline to quench so bright a brilliancy<br>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">IT was generally on Sundays that boys walked in the croft
  with those who were, and whom they wished to be considered as, their most
  intimate and confidential friends. To one who knew anything of the
  boys&rsquo; characters, it was most curious and suggestive to observe the
  groups into which they spontaneously formed themselves. The sets at Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s were not very exclusive or very accurately defined; and one
  boy might, by virtue of different sympathies or accomplishments, belong to
  two or three sets at once. Still there were some sets whose outermost circles
  barely touched each other; and hitherto the friends among whom Kenrick had
  chiefly moved would never have associated intimately with the fellows among
  whom Harpour was considered as the leading spirit.</p>

  <p>It was therefore with no little surprise that Mr Percival, who with Mr
  Paton passed through the croft on his Sunday stroll, observed
  Kenrick&mdash;not with his usual companions, Power or Walter or
  Whalley&mdash;but arm in arm with Harpour and Tracy, and accompanied by one
  or two other boys of similar character. It immediately explained to him much
  that had taken place. He had heard vague rumours of the part Kenrick had
  taken at the meeting; he had heard both from him and from Walter that they
  were no longer on good terms with each other; but now it was further plain to
  him that Kenrick was breaking loose from all his old moorings, and sailing
  into the open sea of wilfulness and pride.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you so much interested about?&rdquo; asked Mr Paton, as
  his colleague followed the boys with his glance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am wondering how and why this change has come over
  Kenrick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What change?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see with whom he is walking? Oh, I forgot that you
  never notice that kind of outer life among the boys; on the other hand, I
  always do; it helps me to understand these fellows, and do more for them than
  I otherwise could.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You observe them to some purpose, Percival, at any rate, for your
  influence among them is wonderful&mdash;as I have occasion to discover every
  now and then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Kenrick puzzles me. &lsquo;<i>Nemo repente fuit
  turpissimus</i>&rsquo; one used to think; yet that boy has dropped from the
  society of such a noble fellow as Power, with his exquisite mind and manners,
  plumb into the abyss of intimacy with Harpour. There must be something all
  wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A very little observation showed Mr Percival that his conjectures about
  Kenrick were correct. Clever as he was, his work deteriorated rapidly; the
  whole expression of his countenance changed for the worse; he was implicated
  more than once in very questionable transactions; he lost caste among the
  best and most honourable fellows, and proportionately gained influence among
  the worst and lowest lot in the school, whose idol and hero he gradually
  became. His descent was sudden, because his character had always been
  unstable. The pride and passion which were mollified and restrained as long
  as he had moved with wise and upright companions, broke forth with violence
  when once he fancied himself slighted, and had committed himself to a course
  which he well knew to be wrong. There was one who conjectured much of this at
  a very early period. It was Kenrick&rsquo;s mother; his letters always
  indicated the exact state of his thoughts and feelings; and Mrs Kenrick knew
  that the coldness and recklessness which had lately marked them were proofs
  that her boy was going wrong. The violence, too, with which he spoke of
  Evson, and the indications that he had dropped his old friends and taken up
  with new and worse companions, filled her mind with anxiety and distress; yet
  what could she do, poor lady, in her lonely home? There was one thing only
  that she could do for him in her weakness; and those outpourings of sorrowful
  and earnest prayer were not in vain.</p>

  <p>Mr Percival tried to make some effort to save Kenrick from the wrong
  courses which he had adopted; he asked him quietly to come and take a glass
  of wine after dinner; but the interview only made matters worse. Kenrick, not
  undated by his popularity among the lower forms as a champion of the supposed
  &ldquo;rights&rdquo; of the school, chose to adopt an independent and almost
  patronising tone towards his tutor; he entered in a jaunty manner, and
  glancing carelessly over the table, declined to take any of the fruit to
  which the master invited him to help himself. He determined to be as
  uncommunicative as possible; avoided all conversation, and answered Mr
  Percival&rsquo;s questions on all subjects by monosyllables, uttered in a
  disrespectful and nonchalant tone. Yet all the while he despised himself and
  was ill at ease. He knew the deep kindness of the master&rsquo;s intentions,
  and felt that he ought to be grateful for the interest shown towards him; but
  it required a stronger power and a different method from his own, to exorcise
  from his heart the devil of self-will; and besides this, it cannot be denied
  that in the first bloom and novelty of sin, in the free exercise of an
  insolent liberty, there is a sense of pleasure for many hearts; it is the
  honey on the rim of the poison-cup, the bloom on the Dead Sea apple, the
  mirage on the scorching waste.</p>

  <p>Mr Percival understood him thoroughly, and saw that he must be left to the
  bitter teachings of experience. Always fond of Kenrick, he had never been
  blind to his many faults of character, and was particularly displeased with
  his present manner, which he knew to be only adopted on purpose to baffle any
  approach to advice or warning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Kenrick,&rdquo; he said, rising rather abruptly,
  while a slight smile of pity rested on his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; said Kenrick; and as he rose in an airy
  manner to leave the room, Mr Percival put a hand on each of the boy&rsquo;s
  shoulders, and looked him steadily in the face. Kenrick tried to meet the
  look, not with the old open gaze of frank and innocent confidence, but with
  an expression half shrinking, half defiant. His eyes fell immediately, and
  satisfied by this perusal of his features that Kenrick was going wrong, Mr
  Percival said only this&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Your face, my boy, is as a book where men<br>
    May read strange matters.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Kenrick had tried to be off-hand and patronising in manner, but the
  attempt had failed egregiously, and he felt very uncomfortable as he left the
  room where he had so often met with kindness, and which he <i>never</i>
  entered on the same terms again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile our two invalids, Walter and Eden, recovered but slowly. But for
  the kindness of every one about them their hours would have passed very
  wearily in the sickroom. Their tedium was enlivened by constant visits from
  Henderson and Power, who never failed to interest Walter by their school
  news, and especially by telling of those numerous little incidents which
  tended to show that although after the late excitements there was a certain
  detumescence, still the general effect had been to arouse a spirit of
  opposition to all constituted authority. Kenrick&rsquo;s name was sometimes
  on their lips, but as they could not speak of him favourably, and as the
  subject was a painful one, they rarely talked much about him.</p>

  <p>Among other visitors was Dr Lane, who, as well as Mrs Lane, showed great
  solicitude about them. The Doctor, who had been told by Dr Keith that, but
  for Walter&rsquo;s tender nursing, Eden&rsquo;s case might have assumed a far
  more dangerous complexion, lent them interesting books and pictures, and
  often came for a few minutes to exchange some kind words with them. Mrs Lane
  asked them to the Lodge, read to them, sang to them, played chess and
  draughts with them, and often gave them drives in her carriage. These little
  gracious acts of simple kindness won the hearts of both the boys, and
  hastened their convalescence.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Walter was allowed to take Eden for a stroll on the shore during
  school hours, when there was no danger of their being excited or interrupted
  by the boisterous society of other boys. There was one favourite spot where
  the two often sat reading and talking. It was by the mouth of the little
  river&mdash;a green knoll sheltered under the rising hills, to the very feet
  of which the little waves came rippling musically as the summer tide flowed
  in. And here Eden would lie down at full length on the soft grass, and doze
  quietly, while the gentle breeze lifted his fair hair from his forehead with
  refreshful coolness; or he would listen while Walter read to him some
  stirring ballad or pleasant tale.</p>

  <p>And thus in the course of a fortnight Walter was himself again, and Eden,
  not long after, was so far recovered as to be allowed to join his
  schoolfellows in the usual routine. He was, however, removed with Walter, and
  Henderson, and Power, to another dormitory, which they had to themselves; and
  the promise of this, relieving his mind from a constant source of dread,
  helped him to recover. The boys, too, conscious how great a wrong had been
  done to him, received him back among them with unusual consideration and
  delicate kindness. They pitied him heartily. It was impossible not to do so
  when they looked at his wan, sad face, so changed in expression; and when
  they observed his timid, shrinking manner, and the tremor which came over him
  at any sudden sight or sound. So every voice was softened when they spoke to
  him, and the manner of even the roughest boys became to him affectionate and
  even caressing. If any had felt inclined to side with Harpour against the
  monitors before, the sight of Eden went far to alter their convictions.</p>

  <p>Yet the poor child was never happy except when he was in Walter&rsquo;s
  society, and in Power&rsquo;s study. Even there he was changed. The bright
  merry laugh which once rang out incessantly was rarely or never heard now;
  and a somewhat sad smile was all that could be elicited from him. He seemed,
  too, to have lost for a time all his old interest in work. The form
  competition had no further attraction for him; the work seemed irksome, and
  he had no spirits to join in any game. Once Power kindly rallied him on his
  general listlessness, but Eden only looked up at him appealingly, and said,
  while the weak tears overflowed his eyes, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with
  me, Power, I can&rsquo;t help it; I don&rsquo;t feel quite, right yet. O,
  Power, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll never like me again as you
  did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Arty, your illness is all the more reason why I
  should.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Power, I shall never be the same as I once was. It seems as if
  some light had gone out and left me in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Arty; the summer holidays will bring you round
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Eden only shook his head, and muttered something about Colonel Braemar
  not being kind to him and his little sister.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think they would let you come and stay part of the holidays
  with us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eden brightened up in a moment, and promised to write and ask.</p>

  <h2>XXIX. &mdash; WALTER&rsquo;S HOLIDAYS</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Such delights<br>
    As float to earth, permitted visitants,<br>
    When in some hour of solemn jubilee<br>
    The massy gates of Paradise are thrown<br>
    Wide open.</i><br>
    &mdash;Coleridge <i>Religious Musings</i>.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">IN scenes like these, part sunshine and part storm, the
  half-year rolled round, and brought the long-desired summer holidays. Once
  more the end of the half-year saw Power as usual brilliantly successful, and
  Walter again at the head of his form. Henderson, too, although he could not
  proceed with Walter <i>pari passu</i>, was among the first six, and had
  gained more than one school distinction. But Kenrick this time had failed as
  he had never done before; he was but fourth in his form, and although this
  was the natural fruit of his recent idleness, it caused him cruel
  mortification.</p>

  <p>The end of term did not pass off quite so smoothly and pleasantly as it
  generally did. The opposition to monitorial authority which Harpour had
  commenced, and Kenrick abetted, did not pass away at once; it left a large
  amount of angry feeling in the minds of numerous boys who had, each of them,
  influence in their several ways. Kenrick himself always went to the verge of
  impertinence whenever he could possibly do so in dealing with any of the
  sixth, and to Somers his manner was always intentionally rude, although he
  just managed to steer clear of any overt insubordination. He could, of
  course, act thus without the risk of incurring any punishment, and without
  coming to any positive collision. Many boys were unfortunately but too ready
  to imitate his example.</p>

  <p>These dissensions did not positively break out on the prize day, but they
  made the proceedings far less pleasant and unanimous than they would have
  been. The cheers usually given to the head of the school were purposely
  omitted, from the fear of provoking any counter-demonstration, and there
  remained an uneasy feeling in many minds. The success of the concert which
  was yearly given by the school choir after the distribution of prizes was
  also marred by traces of the same dissension. In this concert Walter had a
  solo to sing, and although he sang it remarkably well in his sweet ringing
  voice, he was vexed to hear a few decided hisses among the plaudits which
  greeted him. Altogether the prize day&mdash;a great day at Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s&mdash;was less successful than it had ever been known to
  be.</p>

  <p>It brought, however, one pleasure to Walter, in the acquaintance of Sir
  Lawrence and Lady Power, who had heard of him so often in their son&rsquo;s
  letters, that they begged to be introduced to him as soon as they arrived. He
  was a great deal with them during the day, and he helped Power to show them
  all that was interesting about the school and its environs. They saw Eden
  too, and Lady Power kindly pressed her invitation on Mrs Braemar, who was
  also present, and who was not sorry that Arty could stay with a family so
  well connected, and of such high position. When Walter left them, Power
  earnestly asked his mother what she thought of his friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is the most charming boy I ever saw,&rdquo; said Lady Power,
  &ldquo;and I rejoice that you have chosen him as a friend. But you
  don&rsquo;t tell me anything about Kenrick, of whom you were once so fond;
  how is that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am still fond of him, mother, but he has changed a good deal
  lately.&rdquo; At that moment Kenrick passed by arm in arm with Harpour, as
  though to confirm Power&rsquo;s words, and recognised him with an
  ostentatiously careless nod.</p>

  <p>It was thus that Walter&rsquo;s first year at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s
  ended; and in spite of all drawbacks he felt that it had been a distinguished
  and happy year. He was now yearning for home, and he felt that he could meet
  his dear ones with honest pride. He made arrangements to correspond with
  Henderson and Eden in the holidays, and Power promised again to visit him at
  Semlyn, on condition that he would come back with him and spend a week at
  Severn Park, so that there might be a double bond of union between them.</p>

  <p>Very early the next morning the boys were swarming into coaches,
  carriages, brakes, and every conceivable vehicle which could by any
  possibility convey them to the nearest station. A hearty cheer accompanied
  each coach as it rolled off with its heavy and excited freight; by nine
  o&rsquo;clock not a boy was left behind. The great buildings of Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s were still as death; the footfall of the chance passer-by
  echoed desolately among them. A strange, mournful, conscious silence hung
  about the old monastic pile. The young life which usually played like the
  sunshine over it, was pouring unwonted brightness into many happy English
  homes.</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon when Walter found himself on the top of the
  hill which looks down over Semlyn Lake. The water lay beneath him a sheet of
  placid silver; the flowers were scattered on every side in their beds of
  emerald and sunlit moss; the air, just stirred by the light breeze, was rich
  and balmy with the ambrosial scent of the summer groves; and high overhead
  the old familiar hills reared their magnificent summits into the deep
  unclouded blue. But Walter&rsquo;s bright eye was fixed on one spot only of
  the enchanting scene&mdash;the spot where the gables of his father&rsquo;s
  house rose picturesquely on the slope above the lake, and where a little bay
  in the sea of dark green firs gave him a glimpse of their garden, in which he
  could discover the figures of his brothers and sisters at their play. A sense
  of unspoken, unspeakable happiness flowed into the boy&rsquo;s warm heart,
  and if at the same moment his eyes were suffused with tears, they were the
  tears that always spring up when the fountain of the heart is stirred by any
  strong emotion to its inmost depths&mdash;the tears that come even in
  laughter to show that our very pleasures have their own alloy.</p>

  <p>The coach was still behind him toiling slowly up the ascent. Leaving it to
  convey his luggage up to the house, he plunged down a green winding path,
  ankle-deep in soft grasses and innumerable flowers, which led to his home by
  a short cut down, the valley, along the burnside, and under the waving woods.
  That sweet woodland path, cool and fragrant on the most burning summer-day,
  where he had often gathered the little red ripe wild strawberries that peeped
  out here and there from between the scented spikes of golden agrimony, and
  under the white graceful flowers of the circoea, was familiar and dear to him
  from the earliest childhood. He plunged into it with delight, and springing
  along with joyous steps, reached in ten minutes the wicket-gate which led
  into his father&rsquo;s grounds. The first thing to see and recognise him was
  a graceful pet fawn of his sister&rsquo;s, which at his whistle came trotting
  to him with delight, jingling the little silver bell which was tied by a blue
  riband round its neck. Barely stopping to caress the beautiful little
  creature&rsquo;s head, he bounded through the orchard into the garden, and
  the next instant the delighted shout of his brothers and sisters welcomed him
  back, as they ran up, with all the glee of innocent and happy childhood, to
  greet him with their repeated kisses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, there are papa and mamma,&rdquo; he cried, breaking away from
  the laughing group, as his mother advanced with open arms to meet him, and
  pressed him to her heart in a long embrace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m first in my form, papa,&rdquo; he said, looking joyously
  up into his father&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Head remove again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you, Walter? I am so happy to hear it. Few things could give me
  more pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s nothing to being at <i>home</i>,&rdquo; he said,
  shouting aloud in the uncontrolled exuberance of his spirits, and hardly
  knowing which way to turn in the multiplicity of objects which seemed to
  claim his instant attention.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do come the rounds with me, Charlie,&rdquo; he said to his
  favourite brother, &ldquo;and let me see all the dear old places again. We
  shall be back in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then, I dare say, you&rsquo;ll be glad of some tea,&rdquo; said
  his mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Rather</i>!&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have it out
  here on the lawn, mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The proposal was carried by acclamation, and very soon the table was laid
  under the witch elm before the house, while Walter&rsquo;s little sisters had
  heaped up several dishes with freshly plucked fruit, laid in the midst of
  flowers and vine leaves, and Walter, his face beaming and his eyes dancing
  with happiness, was asking and answering a thousand incessant questions,
  while yet he managed to enjoy very thoroughly a large bunch of grapes, and an
  immense plate of strawberries and cream.</p>

  <p>And when tea was over they still sat out in the lovely garden until the
  witch elm had ceased to chequer their faces with its rain of flickering
  light; and until the lake had paled from pure gold to rose-colour, and from
  rose-colour to dull crimson, and from dull crimson to silver grey, and
  rippled again from silver grey into a deep black blue, relieved by a thousand
  flashing edges of molten silver and quivering gold, under the crescent moon
  and the innumerable stars. And the bats had almost ceased to wheel, and in
  the moist air of early night the flowers were diffusing their luscious
  sweetness, and the nightingale was flooding the grove with her unimaginable
  rapture, and the eager talk had hushed itself into a delicious calm of happy
  silence, before they moved. It was a beautiful picture&mdash;the father and
  mother still youthful enough to enjoy life to the full, happy at heart, and
  proud of their eldest boy; his two young brothers looking up to him with such
  eager hope and love; the little sisters with their arms twined round his
  neck, and their fair hair falling over his shoulders; the noble, mirthful,
  fearless, thrice happy boy himself&mdash;a family circle unseparated by
  distance, unshadowed by sorrow, unbroken by death, seated in this exquisite
  scene on the lawn of their own happy English home.</p>

  <p>Thrice happy! yes, in spite of sin and sorrow, and retribution and
  remorse, there <i>are</i> hours when the cup sparkles in our hands, filled to
  the brim; not (as often) with earthly waters; not with the intoxicating wine
  that flames in the magic bowl of pleasure; not with the red and ragged lees
  of wrath and satiety; but with the crystal rivers of the water of life
  itself. There <i>are</i> such hours at any rate for some. Whether they come
  to all mankind I know not; whether the squalid Andaman or the hideous Fuegian
  ever feel them I know not; nay, I know not whether they ever come, whether
  they ever can come, to the wretched outcasts of earth&rsquo;s abject poverty
  and fathomless degradation; whether they ever come, whether they ever can
  come, to the cruel and the proud, to the malicious and the mean, to the
  cynical and discontented; yet, if they come not to these, God help them! for
  they are the surest pledges of our immortality; and to the young and
  innocent&mdash;ay, and even to the young and guilty&mdash;they do sometimes
  come&mdash;these hours of absorbing limitless enjoyment; these glimpses of
  dimly remembered paradise; these odours snatched from a primal Eden, from a
  golden age when justice still lived upon the earth, and crime was as yet
  unknown. There are such hours, and for this English family this hour was one
  of them.</p>

  <p>Thrice happy Walter! and almost like a dream of happiness these holidays
  at home&mdash;and at <i>such</i> a home&mdash;flew by. Every day and hour was
  a change from pleasure to pleasure; among the hills, in the boat on the
  sunlit lake, plunging for his cool morning swim in the fresh waters,
  cricketing, riding, fishing, walking with his father and mother and brothers,
  sitting and talking at the cool nightfall in the moonlit garden, Walter was
  as happy as the day was long. And when Power came to spend a week with them,
  again charming every one whom he saw with his cheerful unselfishness and
  engaging manners, and himself charmed beyond expression with all he saw at
  Walter&rsquo;s home, they agreed that nothing was wanting to make their
  happiness &ldquo;an entire and perfect chrysolite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Power, we have seen, was something of a young poet, and on the day he left
  Semlyn with Walter, who was to accompany him home, he sat a long time silent
  in the train, and then tore out a leaf of his pocket-book, on which he had
  scribbled the following lines on Semlyn Lake.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>If earthly homes can shine so fair<br>
    With sky and wave so purely blue,<br>
    Beneath the balmy purple air,<br>
    If hills can don so rich a hue;<br>
    <br>
    If fancy fails to paint a scene<br>
    In Eden&rsquo;s soft and floral glades,<br>
    Where azure clear and golden green<br>
    More sweetly blend with silver shades;<br>
    <br>
    If marked and flecked with sinful stains,<br>
    Earth hath not lost her power to bless,<br>
    But still, beneath the cloud, remains<br>
    So steeped in perfect loveliness;<br>
    <br>
    Merged, as we are, in doubt and fear,<br>
    Yet, when we yearn for realms of bliss,<br>
    We scarce can dream, while lingering here,<br>
    Of any fairer heaven than this.</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Poor verses, and showing too delicate a sensibility to be healthy in any
  boy; yet dear to me and dear to Walter for Power&rsquo;s sake, and because
  they show the strange charm which Semlyn has for those who have the gift of
  appreciating those natural treasures with which earth plentifully fills her
  lap.</p>

  <h2>XXX. &mdash; OLD AND NEW FACES</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Pudorem, amicitiam, pudicitiam, divina atque humana promiscum, nihil
    pensi neque moderati habere.</i><br>
    &mdash;Sallust.
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">AND now, gentle or ungentle reader, we must imagine that two
  whole years have passed since the conclusion of those summer holidays, before
  we again meet our young friends of Saint Winifred&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>The two years&mdash;as what years are not?&mdash;have been full of change.
  Walk across the court with me, and let us discover what we can about the
  present state of things.</p>

  <p>The first we meet are Walter and Power&mdash;taller and manlier looking
  than they were, but otherwise little changed in appearance. Walter, with his
  dark hair and blue eyes, his graceful figure and open face, is still the
  handsome, attractive-looking boy we used to see. Power, too, has the same
  refined, thoughtful look, the same delicate yet noble features, the same
  eyes, which we recognise at once as the clear and bright index of a beautiful
  and unstained soul.</p>

  <p>And neither of these boys has failed in their promise of their earlier
  days, and the warm friendship with which they regarded each other has done
  much to bring about this result. Each in his own way has rejoiced in his
  youth, has passed an innocent and happy boyhood, stored with pleasant
  reminiscences for after days, filled with high hopes and manly principles,
  with habits well-regulated, and that fine self-control which had taught
  them&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;... Rapt in reverential awe,<br>
    To sit, self-governed in the fiery prime<br>
    Of youth, obedient at the feet of law.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>They have enjoyed the gifts of early years without squandering them in
  wasteful profusion; they have felt and known that the purest pleasures were
  also the sweetest and the most permanent. Their minds are well cultivated,
  their bodies are in vigorous health, their hearts are glowing with generous
  impulse and warm enthusiasm; and if sorrow should ever darken their after
  years, it can never drive them to despair, for they have wandered in the
  pleasant paths of wisdom, they have drunk the pure cup of innocence, they
  will carry out of the torrid zone of youth clear consciences, unremorseful
  memories, and unpolluted minds.</p>

  <p>Who is this who saunters across the playground, talking in loud, self-
  confident tones with two or three fellows round him, his hands in his
  pockets, his air haughty and nonchalant, and his cap a little on one side? He
  is still pleasant looking, his face still shows the capabilities for good and
  great things, but we are obliged to say of him:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Quantum mutatus ab illo<br>
    Hectore!&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Yes, Kenrick&mdash;for it is he&mdash;is altered for the worse. Something
  or other has left, in its traces upon his face, the history of two degenerate
  years. His cheek does not look as if it were capable any longer of an
  ingenuous blush, and there is a curl about his lip and nostril which speaks
  of perpetual unhealthy scorn, that child of mortified vanity and conceit,
  which brazens out the reproaches of self-distrust and self-reproach. See with
  what a careless, almost patronising, air he barely notices the master who is
  passing by him. He has just flung a slight nod to Power, studiously taking
  care not to notice Walter at all. Look, too, at the boys who are with him;
  they are not boys with whom we like to see him; they are an idle lot,
  precocious only in folly and in vice. And that little fellow, who seems to be
  his especial favourite, is not at all to our taste; he seems the coolest of
  them all. For during the last few years Kenrick has entirely lost his
  balance; he has deserted his best friends for the adulation of younger boys,
  who fed his vanity, and the society of elder boys, who perverted his
  thoughts, and vitiated his habits. He has slackened in the career of
  honourable industry, he has deflected from the straight paths of integrity
  and virtue. Already the fresh eagerness of youth has palled into satiety,
  already some of its sparkling-wine for him is bitter as vinegar; with him
  already pleasure has become hectic fever instead of a healthy glow. Alas! he
  is not happy. Within these two years he has lost&mdash;and his countenance
  betrays the fact in its ruined beauty&mdash;he has lost the true joys of
  youth, and known instead of them the troubles of the envious, the fears of
  the cowardly, the heaviness of the slothful, the shame of the unclean. He has
  lost something of the instinctive shrinking, even in thought, from all that
  is vile and base, the loathing of falsehood, the kindness that will not
  willingly give pain, the humility which has lowly thoughts of its own worth;
  he has lost his joy in things lovely, and excellent, and of good report; he
  has changed them for the mirth of fools, which is like crackling
  thorns&mdash;changed them for the feet that go down to death, for the steps
  that lay hold of hell. It is a mean price for which he has sold his peace of
  conscience&mdash;&ldquo;the sweetness of the cup that is charged with poison,
  the beauty of the serpent whose bite is death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eden, who is seated reading on one of the benches by the wall, has
  recovered from his illness, but he is not, and never will be, what, but for
  Harpour&rsquo;s brutality, he might have been. He is a nervous, timid,
  intellectual boy. No game, unfortunately, has any attraction for him. The
  large liquid eyes, swimming sometimes with strange lustre, and often varying
  in colour, the delicate flush which any pulse of emotion drives glowing into
  the somewhat pale face, give to him an almost girlish aspect, and tell the
  tale of a weakened constitution. Eden&rsquo;s development has been quite
  altered by his fright; most of the vivacity and playfulness of his character
  has vanished; and although it flashes out with pleasant mirth when he is
  alone with his few closest friends, such as Walter and Power, his manner is,
  for the most part, very quiet and reserved. Yet Eden has a position of his
  own in the school; and unobtrusive as he is, his opinion is always listened
  to with kindness and respect. When he came into school again after his
  recovery he was received, as I have said already, with almost brotherly
  affection by all the boys, who felt how much he had been wronged. He became
  the child and protg of the school, and any cruelty to <i>him</i> would,
  after this, have been violently resented. Devoting himself wholly to work and
  reading, he became very successful in his progress, and is now in the second
  fifth. But what chiefly marks him is his extreme gentleness, and the eager
  way in which he strives to help all the younger and most helpless boys.
  Experience of suffering has given him a keen sympathy with the oppressed, and
  young as he is he is still doing a useful work.</p>

  <p>There is Harpour playing rackets, and he is playing remarkably well. He is
  now nineteen, and a personage of immense importance in the school, for he is
  head of the cricket eleven, Walter being head of the football. Harpour is
  quite unchanged, and if he was doing mischief when we knew him two years ago,
  he is doing twice as much mischief now. His influence is unmitigatedly
  pernicious. With just enough cunning skill to escape detection, he yet
  signalises himself by complicity in every form of wrong which goes on in the
  school, and some new wrongs he introduces and invents. But nothing delights
  him so much as to instigate other boys to resist the authority of the
  masters. They know him to be a nucleus of disorder and wickedness, but he has
  acted with such consummate ingenuity as to avoid even laying himself open to
  any distinct proof of his many offences.</p>

  <p>He is just now stopping for a minute in his game to talk to those three
  boys, who have been strutting up and down the court arm in arm, and whom we
  easily recognise. The one with the red puffy face, with an enormous gold pin
  in his cravat, a bunch of charms hanging to his chain, and a ring on his
  hand, which he loses no opportunity of displaying, is our friend Jones, with
  vulgarity as usual stamped on every feature, and displayed in every movement
  which he makes; the tall slim fellow, with an air of feeble fastness, an
  indecisive mouth, a habit of running his hand through his light-coloured
  hair, and a gaze which usually settles in fixed admiration on his faultless
  boots, can be no one but Howard Tracy; the third, a fellow with far more
  meaning and strength in his face, betrays himself to be Mackworth, by the
  insinuating plausibility and Belial-like grace of his manner and aspect. A
  dangerous serpent this; one never sees him, or hears him speak, or observes
  the dark glitter of his eye, without being reminded of a cerastes lythely
  rustling through the dry grass towards its victim.</p>

  <p>And there at last&mdash;I thought we should never see him&mdash;is our
  dear young joker of jokes, the same unaltered Flip whom we know, running down
  the school steps. His face is overflowing with mirth and fun, and now he is
  stopping and holding both his sides for laughter, while, with little touches
  of his own, he retails some of the strange blunders which Bliss has made in
  the <i>viva voce</i> examination that morning; to which his friend Whalley
  listens with the same good-humoured smile which he had of old. Henderson is a
  perfect mimic, but never uses his powers of mimicry in an ill-natured spirit;
  and his imitation of Bliss&rsquo;s stolid perplexity and Dr Lane&rsquo;s
  comments are very ludicrous. While he is in the middle of this narrative,
  Bliss himself appears on the scene and relieves his feelings by delivering
  the only pun he ever made in his life, and observing, in a solemn tone of
  voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Flip, don&rsquo;t be flippant;&rdquo; a remark which he has
  substituted for the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lick you, Flip,&rdquo; of old days.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You dear old Blissidas, I <i>think</i> I&rsquo;ve heard that pun
  once or twice before,&rdquo; observes Henderson, calmly pulling undone the
  bow of Bliss&rsquo;s necktie, and running off to escape retaliation, followed
  at his leisure by Whalley, who knows Bliss to be much too lazy to pursue the
  chase very far.</p>

  <p>Let us come and hear&mdash;for we have put on our cap of darkness and are
  invisible, coming and going where we like, unobserved&mdash;what our four
  fast friends at the racket-court are talking about.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall have lots of larks this half,&rdquo; observes Harpour,
  leaning on his racket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; such fun, old boy,&rdquo; answers Jones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I declare this dull old place was getting quite lively before last
  holidays,&rdquo; says Mackworth; &ldquo;we shall soon get things all right
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fancy that fellow Power head of the school,&rdquo; said Harpour,
  bursting into a roar of scornful laughter, echoed in faint sniggerings by
  Jones and Tracy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Might as well have a jug of milk and water head of the
  school,&rdquo; sneered Mackworth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or a bottle of French polish, I should think,&rdquo; casually
  suggests Henderson, who, <i>en passant</i>, has heard the last remark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn that fellow,&rdquo; says Mackworth, stamping, &ldquo;by Jove,
  I&rsquo;ll be even with him some day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he one of the new monitors?&rdquo; asks Jones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Tracy, &ldquo;and Evson&rsquo;s another;&rdquo;
  and at Walter&rsquo;s name the faces of all four grew darker; &ldquo;and
  Kenrick&rsquo;s a third.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, Kenrick is, is he? that&rsquo;s all right. Jolly fellow is
  Ken,&rdquo; observes Harpour, approvingly. &ldquo;Yes, quite up to
  snuff,&rdquo; adds Jones; &ldquo;and a thorough gentlemanly chap,&rdquo;
  assents Mackworth; for, amazing to relate, Kenrick is on good terms with
  these fellows now, though he has never spoken to Walter yet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of good family, too, on the mother&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; drawls
  Tracy, with his hand lifting his locks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, old fellows,&rdquo; says Harpour, with many knowing looks
  and winks, and poking of his friends in the ribs. &ldquo;I say, stunning tap
  at Dan&rsquo;s, you know, eh? I say;&rdquo; whereupon the others laugh, and
  Belial Mackworth observes, &ldquo;And let those monitors try to peach if they
  dare. We&rsquo;ll soon have <i>them</i> under our thumb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After which, as their conversation is supremely repulsive, let us go and
  take a breath of delicious pure sea air, and seat ourselves by Walter and
  Power on the shore. Walter is in good, and even gay spirits, being fresh from
  Semlyn, but Power seems a little grave and depressed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, Walter,&rdquo; he says, shying a round stone at a bit of
  embedded rock about twenty yards before them, but missing it; &ldquo;I
  believe it was that identical rock&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> identical rock,&rdquo; said Walter, taking a better
  shot, and hitting it; &ldquo;well, what about it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&rdquo;&mdash;On which you were standing one autumn evening three years
  ago, when the tide was coming in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And to save me wet trousers you took off your shoes and stockings,
  and carried me in on your back,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;I remember it
  well, Rex; it was a happy day for me. I recollect I&rsquo;d been very
  miserable; it was after the Paton affair, you know, and every one was cutting
  me. Your coming to speak to me was about the last thing in the world I
  expected and the best thing I could have hoped. I&rsquo;d often wanted to
  know you, longed to have you as a friend; but I used to lock up to you as
  such a young swell in those days that I never thought we should meet each
  other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Power; &ldquo;but wasn&rsquo;t it good now of me
  to break the ice and speak first? I declare, I think I&rsquo;ve never done it
  with any one else. <i>You&rsquo;d</i> never have done it&mdash;now confess?
  Only fancy, we mightn&rsquo;t have known each other till this day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it at <i>that</i> time,&rdquo; said
  Walter, &ldquo;because I was in Coventry; but&mdash;well, never mind, Rex, we
  understand each other. I was looking at some porpoises, I
  remember.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; happy days they were after that. I wish the time was back
  again! Fancy you a monitor, and me head of the school!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fancy! we&rsquo;ve got up the school so much faster than we used to
  expect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but I wish we could change places, and you be head and I sixth
  monitor as you are. You&rsquo;ll help me, Walter, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t doubt that, Rex, I&rsquo;m sure; <i>all</i> the
  help <i>I</i> can give is yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for that, I think I would have left, Walter. I
  don&rsquo;t think, somehow, I&rsquo;ve influence enough for head. I&rsquo;m
  not swell enough at the games.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You play though now, and enjoy them; and I don&rsquo;t half believe
  you, Rex, when you talked of having wished to leave. That would have been
  cowardice, you know, and you&rsquo;re not the boy to leave your
  post.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here I am then in my place, armour on, visor down, determined not
  to fly, like the Roman soldier whose skeleton was found in the sentry box at
  Pompeii,&rdquo; said Power, playfully getting up and assuming a military
  attitude.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And here am I,&rdquo; said Walter, laughing, as he stood beside him
  with one foot advanced&mdash;&ldquo;I, your sixth Hyperaspistes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The sixth!&mdash;the <i>first</i> you mean,&rdquo; said Power.
  &ldquo;The four monitors, between you and me, won&rsquo;t, I fear, help us
  much. Browne is very short-sighted, and always shutting up with a headache;
  Smythe is a mere book-worm, and a regular butt even among the little
  fellows&mdash;worse than useless&mdash;no dignity or anything else; Kenrick
  (for Kenrick had so far kept the advantage of his original start that, much
  as he had fallen off in work, Walter had not yet got above him)&mdash;well,
  you know what Ken is!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know what Ken is now&mdash;<i>Hespemor en
  phthimenoir</i>&mdash;he&rsquo;s our chief danger&mdash;a doubtful general in
  the camp. Hullo, Flip, <i>you</i> here?&rdquo; said he, as Henderson came up
  and joined them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Myself, O Evides; who&rsquo;s the doubtful general in the
  camp?&mdash;not I, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You, Flip? no; but Kenrick. We&rsquo;re talking about the
  monitors.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A doubtful general!&mdash;a traitor, you mean, an enemy, a
  spy,&rdquo; said Henderson, hotly. &ldquo;There, now, don&rsquo;t stop me,
  Power; abuse is a good safety-valve; the scream of the steam-engine letting
  off superfluous vapour. I should dislike him far worse if I bottled up
  against him a silent spite, hated him in the dark, and didn&rsquo;t openly
  abuse him sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Power&rsquo;s large and gentle mind, and Walter&rsquo;s generous temper
  prevented them from joining in Henderson&rsquo;s strong language; but they
  felt no less than he did that, if they were to work for the good of the
  school, Kenrick would be their most dangerous, though not their declared,
  opponent. A monitor who seemed to recognise none of a monitor&rsquo;s duties,
  who openly broke rules and defied discipline, who smoked and went to
  public-houses, and habitually associated with inferiors, and those the least
  creditable set in the school, did more to damage the authority of the upper
  boys than <i>any</i> number of external assaults on them if they were
  consistent and united among themselves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I foresee storms ahead,&rdquo; said Power, with a sigh.
  &ldquo;Flip, you must stand by me as well as Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;but remember I&rsquo;m
  only the junior monitor of the lot, and I&rsquo;m so quick-tempered,
  I&rsquo;m always afraid of stirring up a commotion some day with the
  Harpoons&rdquo;&mdash;as Henderson had christened the Harpour lot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must be like the lightning-kite then,&rdquo; said Power,
  &ldquo;and turn the flash away from us.&rdquo;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;&lsquo;And dash the beauteous terror to the ground,<br>
    Smiling majestic,&rsquo;&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">observed Henderson, parodying the gesture, and making the
  others laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you remember Somers, and Dimock, and Danvers? What big fellows
  the monitors used to be then!&rdquo; said Power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And do you remember certain boys whom Somers, and Dimock, and
  Danvers praised on a certain occasion?&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;Come, Rex,
  don&rsquo;t despond. We weren&rsquo;t afraid then, why should we be
  now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But then they had Macon, and fellows like that, to uphold them in
  the school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So have <i>we</i>,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;first and foremost
  Whalley, who&rsquo;s now got his remove into the upper sixth; then
  there&rsquo;s dear old Blissidas, who has arms if he hasn&rsquo;t got brains,
  and who is as staunch as a rock; and best of all, perhaps, there&rsquo;s
  Franklin, second in both elevens, brave as a lion, strong as a bull. By the
  by, as I have a lightning-kite ready made for you no doubt; he&rsquo;s
  accustomed to the experiment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Flip, you talk as if we were going to have a pitched
  battle,&rdquo; said Power, ignoring his joke about Franklin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So we are&mdash;practically and morally. Look out for skirmishes
  from the Harpour lot; especially the world, the flesh, and the devil, whom I
  just saw arm in arm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean, Flip?&rdquo; asked Walter, laughing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mean! nothing at all&mdash;only Tracy, Jones, and Mackworth.
  Tracy&rsquo;s the world, Jones is the flesh&mdash;raw flesh; and
  Mackworth&rsquo;s the other thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you of two more who won&rsquo;t let the school
  override us if they can help it,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;Cradock and
  Eden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Briareus and Paradise,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;poor Eden, he
  can&rsquo;t do much for us except look on with large troubled
  eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he though, Flip? he&rsquo;s got a good deal of
  power.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a great deal of good from Power, I know,
  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t be a donkey, Flip.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do shut up. Why should you two expect such a dead assault on the
  monitors this half?&rdquo; said Power.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, the fifth has in it a more turbulent lot just now than I ever
  knew before; big impudent fellows, with no good in them, and quite at the
  beck of the Harpour set,&rdquo; said Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and with that fellow Kenrick for a protagonist,&rdquo; said
  Henderson; &ldquo;he and Harpour have always been at mischief about the
  monitors since they caught it so tremendously from Somers. Well, never mind;
  <i>aide toi et ciel t&rsquo;aidera</i>. Why, look, there&rsquo;s Paradise,
  taking charge as usual of a little new fellow; who is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look and see,&rdquo; said Walter, as a little fellow came up, with
  an unmistakable family resemblance&mdash;a pretty boy, with fresh round
  cheeks, and light hair, which shone like gold when the sunshine fell upon
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Walter&mdash;why, this must be your brother. Well, I declare!
  an Evides secundus, Evides redivivus. Just what you were the day you came,
  and made Jones look small three years ago. How do you do, young
  &rsquo;un?&rdquo; He shook him kindly by the hand and said,
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lucky little fellow to have a monitor brother, and Eden
  to look after you from the first. I wish <i>I&rsquo;d</i> been so lucky, I
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter, what a <i>jolly</i> place this is,&rdquo; said his little
  brother,&mdash;&ldquo;jollier than Semlyn even.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, Charlie; don&rsquo;t make up your mind too soon,&rdquo;
  said Walter; while Eden looked at the boy with a somewhat sad smile playing
  on his lips.</p>

  <p class="first">THE changes described in the last chapter were not the only
  ones which seriously affected the prosperity of Saint Winifred&rsquo;s
  School, for the stall of masters was also partly altered during the last two
  years, and the alterations had not been improvements. Mr Paton&mdash;who had
  by this time manfully resumed his old theological labours, and who, to please
  Walter, had often employed him as a willing amanuensis in attempting to
  replace the burnt manuscript&mdash;had retired from his mastership to a quiet
  country living to which he had been presented by Sir Lawrence Power. Strange
  as it may seem, Mr Paton chiefly, though of course indirectly, owed this
  living to Walter, who had first talked to Sir Lawrence about Mr Paton, in
  terms of deep regard. The opportunity, therefore, which Walter had sought so
  earnestly, of atoning in some way for the mischief which he had done to his
  old master, was amply granted to him; and Mr Paton never felt more strongly,
  that even out of the deepest apparent evils God can bring about undoubted
  blessings. Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, however, was the loser by his promotion.
  The benefit of his impartial justice and stern discipline, and the weight of
  his firm and manly character in the councils of the school, was gone. And
  Saint Winifred&rsquo;s had suffered a still greater loss in the departure of
  Mr Percival, who had accepted, some months before, the offer of a tutorship
  in his own university. Had he continued where he was, his influence, his
  well-deserved popularity, his kind, wise, conciliatory manner, the gratitude
  which rewarded his ready and self-denying sympathy, would, in the troubled
  period which ensued, have been even more useful than his brilliant
  scholarship and successful method of teaching a form. These two masters had
  left amid the universal regret of the boys and of their colleagues, and their
  places had been filled up by younger, less able, and less experienced
  men.</p>

  <p>And worse than this, Dr Lane, soon after the term began, was taken
  seriously ill, and was ordered to the German baths for two months, during
  which his work was done by another master, who had not the same influence.
  From all which causes, this half-year at Saint Winifreds was the most
  turbulent, the most riotous, and the most unhappy, ever known in that
  honourable and ancient school.</p>

  <p>So little Charlie Evson soon found reason to revise and modify his
  opinion, that Saint Winifred&rsquo;s&mdash;as he <i>then</i> saw it&mdash;was
  jollier than even Semlyn itself. His name had been entered in the list of Mr
  Percival&rsquo;s house, before it was known that he was going to leave.
  Walter liked Mr Percival so much better than he did his own tutor, Mr
  Robertson, and had experienced from him so much more kindness, that he
  thought it would be an advantage for Charlie to be placed directly under so
  wise and kind a friend; and Mr Evson, afraid that his little son would be
  quite overshadowed by his elder brother, and that Walter&rsquo;s influence,
  which was very transcendent over Charlie&rsquo;s mind, would make him too
  dependent on another, and prevent him from developing his own natural
  character, was by no means averse to the arrangement. But since Mr Percival
  had left, Charlie, with the other boys in the house, was handed over to the
  charge of Mr Noel, a new master, who had to win his way and learn his work,
  neither of which he succeeded in doing until he had committed many
  mistakes.</p>

  <p>In this house were Kenrick and Mackworth&mdash;Kenrick, as monitor, was in
  some measure responsible for the character of the house, and he had Charlie
  as one of his fags. At this time, as I have already observed with sorrow,
  Kenrick&rsquo;s influence was not only useless for good, but was even
  positively bad. There was <i>no</i> other monitor who did not try to be of
  some use to his fags; many of the monitors, by quiet kindnesses and useful
  hints, by judicious help and unselfish sympathy, were of most real service to
  the boys who nominally &ldquo;fagged&rdquo; for them, but who, in point of
  fact, were required to do nothing except taking an occasional message, seeing
  that the study fires did not go out, and carrying up the tea and breakfast
  for a week each, in order of rotation. Few Saint Winifred&rsquo;s boys would
  have hesitated to admit that they would have been less happy, and would have
  had fewer chances in school-life, if they had not been fags at first, and
  thereby found friends and protectors in the boys for whom they fagged.
  Kenrick, however, did not follow the good example which had become almost
  traditional; for, filled as he was with the spirit of wilful pride, and on
  bad terms with the order to which he belonged, he either spoiled his fags by
  petting and pampering them, and letting them see his own disregard for duty,
  or, if they did not take his fancy, he snubbed and disregarded them&mdash;at
  any rate, did nothing whatever to help them.</p>

  <p>Kenrick was quite willing to have placed Charlie Evson in the first of
  these classes, for he was a boy whom it was impossible to see and not to
  like. His antagonistic position towards most of his own body, made him the
  head of a sort of faction in the school, and he would have been proud beyond
  measure to have had any boy like Charlie as one of his followers. But Kenrick
  had better reasons for wishing to attach Charlie to himself. Deeply as he had
  degenerated, disgraceful as his present conduct was, Kenrick, in the secret
  depths of his soul, sighed and pined for better things; though vice, and
  folly, and pride had their attractions for him, he was still sick at heart
  for the purer atmosphere which he had left. He looked at Charlie with vague
  hopes, for through him he thought that he might yet perhaps, without lowering
  his pride by actually seeming to have made any advance, bring about a
  reconciliation with his best and earliest friends, bring about a return to
  his former and more upright course.</p>

  <p>But this was not to be. When a boy goes wrong he strews every step of his
  downward career with obstacles against his own return; and he little dreams
  how difficult of removal some of these obstacles will be. The obstacle in
  this case was another little fag of Kenrick&rsquo;s, named Wilton. I am sorry
  to write of that boy. Young in years, he was singularly old in vice. A more
  brazen, a more impudent, a more hardened little scapegrace&mdash;in schoolboy
  language, &ldquo;a cooler hand&rdquo;&mdash;it would have been impossible to
  find. He had early gained the name of Raven from his artful looks. His manner
  was a mixture of calm audacity and consummate self-conceit. Though you knew
  him to be a thorough scamp, the young imp would stare you in the face with
  the effrontery of a man about town. He was active, sharp, and nice-looking,
  and there was nothing which he was either afraid or ashamed to do. He had not
  a particle of that modesty which in every good boy is as natural as it is
  graceful; he could tell a lie without the slightest hesitation or the
  faintest blush; nay, while he was telling it, though <i>he</i> knew that you
  <i>knew</i> it to be a lie, he would not abash for an instant the cold glance
  of his wicked dark eyes. Yet this boy, like Charlie, was only thirteen years
  old. And for all these reasons, Wilton was the idol of all the big bad boys
  in the school; and in spite of all these reasons&mdash;for the boy had in him
  the fascination of a serpent&mdash;he was the declared favourite of Kenrick
  too.</p>

  <p>The three boys who gave the tone to Mr Noel&rsquo;s house, were Kenrick,
  Mackworth, and Wilton. They formed as it were an electric chain of bad
  influence, and as they were severally prominent in the chief divisions of the
  school, they had peculiar opportunities for doing harm. Kenrick&rsquo;s evil
  example told with extraordinary power through the whole house, and especially
  upon the highest boys, who naturally imitated him. I do not mean to say that
  Kenrick had sunk so low that wilfully and consciously he lowered the
  character of the house, which as monitor he ought to have improved and
  raised; but he <i>did</i> so whether with intention or not; he did so
  negatively by neglecting all his duties, and by giving no direct countenance
  to what was right; he did so positively by not openly discountenancing, and
  by actually practising, many things which he knew to be wrong. The bad work
  was carried on by Mackworth, who was the most prominent fifth-form boy in the
  house. This boy&rsquo;s ability, and strength of will, and keenness of
  tongue, gave him immense authority, and enabled him to carry out almost
  everything he liked. To complete the mischief, among the lower boys Wilton
  reigned supreme; and as Wilton was prouder of Kenrick&rsquo;s patronage than
  of anything else, and by flattery and cajolery could win over Kenrick to
  nearly anything, the worst part of the characters of these boys acting and
  reacting on each other, leavened the house through and through with all that
  is least good, or true, or lovely, or of a good report. The mischief began
  before Mr Percival left, but it never could have proceeded half so far, if Mr
  Noel&rsquo;s inexperience, and the very kindness which led him to relax the
  existing discipline, had not tempted the boys to unwonted presumption.</p>

  <p>Such was the state of things when Charlie entered Mr Noel&rsquo;s house.
  Walter knew that Mr Percival&rsquo;s promotion had frustrated the plan he had
  formed when he advised his father to put Charlie in that house, but the step
  could not now be recalled, nor, indeed, was Walter or any other monitor aware
  how bad the state of things had become. For among other dangerous
  innovations, Mackworth and Wilton had brought about a kind of understanding,
  that the house should to some extent keep to itself, resent all intrusion
  into its own precincts, and maintain a profound silence about its own
  secrets. Besides all this, Walter bitterly and sorrowfully felt that for some
  reason, which he was unable to fathom, the whole school was just then in an
  unsatisfactory state, and that Charlie, for whom his whole heart yearned with
  brotherly love and pity, would be exposed to severe temptations in whatever
  house he should be placed. He hoped too that, as Charlie would always have
  the run of his and of Power&rsquo;s study, it would make little difference to
  him that he was under a different house master.</p>

  <p>To Mackworth and Wilton the arrival of one or two new boys was a matter of
  some importance, but little anxiety. The new boys were necessarily young, and
  in the present united state of the house, it was tolerably certain that they
  would catch the prevalent spirit, and be quickly assimilated to the condition
  of the others. The task of moulding them&mdash;if they were at all difficult
  to manage&mdash;fell to Wilton, and he certainly accomplished it with
  astonishing success. A newcomer&rsquo;s sensibilities were not too quickly
  shocked. The Noelites, for their own purposes, behaved very kindly to him at
  first; they were first-rate hands at &ldquo;destroying a boy by means of his
  best affections,&rdquo; at &ldquo;seething a kid in its mother&rsquo;s
  milk.&rdquo; The bad language, the school trickeries and deceits, the dodges
  for breaking rules and escaping punishments, the agreed-on lies to avoid
  detection, the suppers, and brandy, and smoking parties, and false keys to
  get out after lock-up, and all the other detestable symptoms of a vitiated
  and depraved set, were carefully kept in abeyance at first. The new fellow
  was treated very kindly, was sounded and fathomed cautiously, was taught to
  get up a strong house feeling by perpetual endeavours to wake in him the
  <i>esprit de corps</i>, was gently ridiculed if he displayed any good
  principle, was tremendously bullied if he showed signs of recalcitrance, was
  according to his temperament led, or coaxed, or initiated, or intimidated,
  into the condition of wickedness required of him before the house could
  continue to go to the devil, as fast as it wished to do, and was doing
  before. This was Mackworth&rsquo;s work, and Wilton acted as his Azazel, and
  Kenrick did not interfere, though he knew or guessed all that was going on;
  he did not interfere, he did not prevent it, he did not even remonstrate at
  first, and afterwards he began by acquiescing, he ended by&mdash;yes, the
  truth must be told&mdash;he ended in joining in it all. O Kenrick, when human
  beings meet face to face before a certain judgment-seat, there are some young
  souls who will have a bill of indictment against you; the same who may point
  to Mackworth or to Wilton, and say, as of old, &ldquo;The serpent beguiled
  me, and I did eat.&rdquo; Five new boys had come this half-year. Four of them
  had been sounded by the rest of the house; one of them, named Stone, had come
  from a large private school, and was prepared for whatever he might find in
  more senses than one. Another, Symes, was a boy ill-trained at home, of no
  particular principles, and quite ready to flow with the stream. A third,
  Hanley, had come meaning to be good; he had been shocked when he first heard
  oaths, and when he was first asked if he would mind telling any of the
  regular lies&mdash;&ldquo;crams&rdquo; the boys called them&mdash;in the
  event of any master questioning him; but his wounded sensibilities were very
  quickly healed, and he had passed with fatal facility from disgust to
  indifference, from indifference to toleration. The fourth, Elgood, was a
  timid child, for whom no one cared either way, and whom they took care to
  frighten into promising to do whatever he was ordered. A terrible state of
  things&mdash;was it not? But, ah me! it was so once upon a time. The fifth
  new boy in Mr Noel&rsquo;s house was Charles Evson; and with this fifth new
  boy the devil&rsquo;s agents knew instinctively that they would have a great
  deal of trouble. But they meant to bait their hook very carefully, and they
  did not at all despair. Their task was made peculiarly piquant by its very
  difficulty, and by the fact that Charlie was one in whom their declared
  enemy, Walter Evson, was so nearly concerned. They were determined by fair
  means or foul to win him over, and make him their proselyte, until he became
  as much a child of sin as they were themselves. But they proceeded to their
  task with the utmost caution, and endeavoured to charm Charlie over to their
  views by showing him great attention, by trying to make things pleasant for
  him, by flattering him with notice, and seeming to welcome him cordially as
  one of themselves. Their dissimulation was profound; at first the new boy
  found everything quite delightful, and before a week was over had caught, as
  they meant him to catch, the spirit of party, and always was ready to stick
  up for the Noelites as the best house in the school. So far so good; but this
  was only the first step of initiation into these Eleusinian mysteries.</p>

  <p>So Master Wilton&mdash;Belial junior, as Henderson always called
  him&mdash;ingratiated himself into Charlie&rsquo;s favour, and tried, not
  without success, to make himself peculiarly agreeable. At first sight,
  indeed, Charlie felt an inward repulsion to him. He did not know <i>why</i>
  he did, for, so far from there being anything obviously repulsive in
  Wilton&rsquo;s look or manners, there were many who thought him the picture
  of innocence, and considered his manners quite perfection in their politeness
  and good breeding. Charlie therefore instantly conquered his first feeling of
  dislike as uncharitable and groundless; and as Wilton seemed to lay himself
  out for his friendship, he was oftener with him during the first fortnight
  than with any other boy. It was strange to see the two together, so utterly
  different were they in every respect, and so great was the contrast of
  Charlie&rsquo;s sweet, bright, modest face, with the indescribable dangerous
  coolness of Wilton&rsquo;s knowing smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Henderson to Whalley, as he saw them together one
  day in the playground; &ldquo;there go Ithuriel and Belial junior, very thick
  at present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I don&rsquo;t like to see it. I don&rsquo;t hear any good of
  that fellow Wilton.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good! I should rather think not!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give young Evson a hint, Flip, will you, that Wilton&rsquo;s not a
  good friend for him. He looks a nice little fellow, and I don&rsquo;t like to
  tell him, because I don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never fear; when Charlie touches him with his spear, or sees him
  light on the top of Niphates&mdash;one of which things will happen soon
  enough&mdash;he&rsquo;ll not be slow to discover who he is. If not,
  I&rsquo;ll tell Walter, and he shall be Charlie&rsquo;s Uriel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Touches him with his spear!&mdash;what spear?&mdash;top of
  Niphates!&mdash;Uriel!&rdquo; said Whalley, with ludicrous astonishment;
  &ldquo;here, Power, you&rsquo;re just in time to help me to put a strait-
  waistcoat on Flip. He says that when Wilton lights on the top of Niphates,
  which he will do soon, young Evson will discover that he&rsquo;s a scamp.
  What <i>does</i> it all mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It only means that Flip and I have been reading the Paradise
  Lost,&rdquo; said Power, laughing, &ldquo;and at present Flip&rsquo;s mind is
  a Miltonic conglomerate.&rdquo; And he proceeded to explain to Whalley that
  Ithuriel was one of the Cherubs who guarded Eden&mdash;</p>

  <p>(&ldquo;Only that in this case Eden guards the cherub,&rdquo; observed
  Henderson, parenthetically.)</p>

  <p>&rdquo;&mdash;and who, by touching Satan with his spear, made him bound up
  in his original state, when he sat like a toad squat at the ear of Eve, and,
  moreover, that Uriel had recognised Satan through his mask, when, lighting on
  Niphates, his looks became &lsquo;Alien from heaven, with passions foul
  obscured.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seriously, though,&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;Uriel must be
  asleep, or he wouldn&rsquo;t let his little brother get under Belial&rsquo;s
  wings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In fact, Wilton was forced to keep on the mask much longer than he had
  ever meant to do. He could find no joint in Charlie&rsquo;s armour. The boy
  was so thoroughly manly, so simple-hearted, so trustful and innocent, that
  Wilton could make nothing of him. If he tried to indoctrinate Charlie into
  the state of morality among the Noelites, either Charlie did not understand
  him, or else quite openly expressed his disapproval and even indignation; and
  when finally Wilton quite tired out, did throw off the mask, Charlie shook
  him away from him, turned with a sickening sensation from the unbared
  features of vice, and unfeignedly loathed the boy who had pretended to be his
  friend&mdash;loathed him all the more because he had tried to like him, but
  now saw the snare which was being spread in his sight.</p>

  <p>Every now and then during their early intercourse Charlie had felt a
  certain restraint in talking to Wilton; he could not be at ease with him
  though he tried. He caught the gleam of the snake through the flowers that
  only half concealed his folds. And Wilton, too, had got very tired of playing
  a part. He could not help his real wickedness cropping out now and then, yet
  whenever it did, Charlie started in such a way that even Wilton was ashamed;
  and though generally the shafts of conscience glanced off from the panoply of
  steel and ice which cased this boy&rsquo;s heart, yet during these days they
  once or twice reached the mark, and made him smart with long-unwonted
  anguish. He was conscious that he was doing the devil&rsquo;s work, and doing
  it for very poor wages, he felt now and then Charlie&rsquo;s immense
  superiority to himself, and, in a mood of pity, when, as they were standing
  one day in Mr Noel&rsquo;s private room to say a lesson, he caught sight of
  their two selves reflected in the looking-glass over the mantelpiece, and
  realised the immense gulf which separated them&mdash;a gulf not of void chaos
  and flaming space, but the deeper gulf of warped affections and sinful
  thoughts&mdash;he had felt a sudden longing to be other than what he was, to
  have Charlie for a true friend, to give up trying to make him a bad boy, and
  to fall at his feet and ask his pardon. And when he had doggedly failed in
  his lesson, and got his customary bad mark, and customary punishment, and
  received his customary objurgation, that he was getting worse and worse, and
  that his time was utterly wasted&mdash;and when he saw the master&rsquo;s
  face light up with a pleased expression as Charlie went cheerfully and
  faultlessly through his work&mdash;a sudden paroxysm of penitence seized
  Wilton, and, once out of the room, he left Charlie and ran up the stairs to
  Kenrick&rsquo;s study, in which he was allowed to sit whenever he liked. No
  one was there, and throwing himself into a chair, Wilton covered his face
  with both hands, and burst into passionate tears. A long train of thoughts
  and memories passed through his mind&mdash;memories of his own headlong fall
  to what he was, memories of younger and of innocent days, memories of a
  father, now dead, who had often set him on his knee, and prayed, before all
  other things, that he might grow up a good and truthful boy, and with no
  stain upon his name. But while memory whispered of past innocence, conscience
  told him of present guilt; told him that if his father could have foreseen
  what he would become, his heart would have broken; told him, and he knew it,
  that his name was a proverb and a byeword in the school. But the prominent
  and the recurring thought was ever this&mdash;&ldquo;Is it too late to mend?
  Is the door shut against me?&rdquo; For Wilton remembered how once before his
  mind was harrowed by fear and guilt as he had listened to Mr Percival&rsquo;s
  parting sermon on that sad text&mdash;one of the saddest in all the Holy
  Book&mdash;&ldquo;<i>And the door was shut</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly he was startled violently from his reverie, for the door
  <i>was</i> shut with a bang, and Kenrick, entering, flung himself in a chair,
  saying, with a vexed expression of voice, &ldquo;Too late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was but a set of verses which Kenrick had written for a prize exercise,
  and which he had just sent in too late. He had not lost all ambition, but he
  had no real friend now to inspirit or stimulate him, so that he often
  procrastinated, and was seldom successful with anything.</p>

  <p>But his accidental words fell with awful meaning and strange emphasis on
  poor Wilton&rsquo;s ear. Wilton had never heard of the Bath Kol, he knew
  nothing of the power that wields the tongue amid the chances of destiny; but
  fear made him superstitious, and, forgetting his usual dissimulation, he
  looked up at Kenrick aghast, without wiping away the traces which unwonted
  tears had left upon his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Raven, boy, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Kenrick,
  looking at him with astonishment; &ldquo;much <i>you</i> care for my having a
  set of iambics too late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; asked Wilton, still looking frightened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All? Yes; and enough, too, for me. But&rdquo;&mdash;stopping
  suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;why, Raven, what&rsquo;s the row? You&rsquo;ve been
  crying, by all that&rsquo;s odd! Why, I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d ever
  shed a tear since you&rsquo;d been in the cradle. Raven crying&mdash;what a
  notion! Crocodile tears, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Wilton was ashamed to have been caught crying, and angry to be laughed at.
  He was leaving the room silently and in a pet, when Kenrick caught him, and,
  looking at him, said in a kindlier tone&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Ra; don&rsquo;t mind a little chaff. What&rsquo;s
  happened? Nothing serious, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Wilton was angry and miserable just then, and struggled to get free.
  He did not venture to tell Kenrick what had really been passing through his
  mind. &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; he said, struggling to get free.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, go, by all means,&rdquo; said Kenrick, with his pride all on
  fire in a moment; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t suppose that I want you or care for
  you;&rdquo; and he turned his back on Wilton, to whom he had never once
  spoken harshly before.</p>

  <p>The current of Wilton&rsquo;s thoughts was turned; he really loved
  Kenrick, who was the only person for whom he had any regard at all. Besides,
  Kenrick&rsquo;s support and favour were everything to him just then, and he
  stopped irresolutely at the door, unwilling to leave him in anger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want? Why don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo; asked Kenrick,
  with his back still turned.</p>

  <p>Wilton came back to the window, and humbly took Kenrick&rsquo;s hand,
  looking up at him as though to ask forgiveness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How odd you are to-day, Raven,&rdquo; said Kenrick, relenting.
  &ldquo;What were you crying about when I came in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Ken. I was thinking how much better some
  fellows are than I am, and whether it was <i>too late</i> to begin afresh,
  and whether the door <i>was open</i> to me still, when you came in, and said,
  &lsquo;Too late,&rsquo; and banged the door, which I took for an answer to my
  thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They were the first serious words Kenrick had ever heard from Wilton; but
  he did not choose to heed them, and only said, after a pause&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Other fellows better than you? Not a bit of it. Less plucky,
  perhaps; greater hypocrites, certainly; but you are the jolliest of them all,
  Ra.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And with that silly, silly speech Wilton was reassured; a gratified smile
  perched itself upon his lips, and his eyes sparkled with delight; nor was he
  soon revisited by any qualms of conscience.</p>

  <h2>XXXII. &mdash; DISENCHANTMENT</h2>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;HOW do you get on with the young Evson, Ra?&rdquo;
  asked Mackworth of Wilton, with a sneer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Wilton. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully
  particular and strait-laced, just like that brother of his. No more fun while
  he&rsquo;s in the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Confound him,&rdquo; said Mackworth, frowning darkly; &ldquo;if he
  doesn&rsquo;t like what he sees, he must lump it. He&rsquo;s not worth any
  more trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So, Mack, <i>you</i> too have discovered what he&rsquo;s
  like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; answered Mackworth savagely. For all his
  polish, his courtesies, and civilities had not succeeded in making Charlie
  conceal how much he feared and disliked him. The young horse rears the first
  time it hears the adder&rsquo;s hiss, and the dove&rsquo;s eye trembles
  instinctively when the hawk is near. Charlie half knew and half guessed the
  kind of character he had to deal with, and made Mackworth hate him with
  deadly hatred by the way in which, without one particle of rudeness or
  conceit, he managed to keep him at a distance, and check every approach to
  intimacy.</p>

  <p>With Kenrick the case was different. Charlie thought that he looked one of
  the nicest and best fellows in the house, but he could not get over the fact
  that Wilton was his favourite. It was Wilton&rsquo;s constant and daily boast
  that Ken would do anything for him; and Charlie felt that Wilton was not a
  boy whom Walter or Power at any rate would even have tolerated, much less
  liked. It was this that made him receive Kenrick&rsquo;s advances with
  shyness and coldness; and when Kenrick observed this, he at once concluded
  that Charlie had been set against him by Walter, and that he would report to
  Walter all he did and said. This belief was galling to him as wormwood.
  Suddenly, and with most insulting publicity, he turned Charlie off from being
  one of his fags, and from that time never spoke of him without a sneer, and
  never spoke to him at all.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, as the term advanced, Saint Winifred&rsquo;s gradually revealed
  itself to Charlie in a more and more unfavourable light. The discipline of
  the school was in a most impaired state; the evening work grew more and more
  disorderly; few of the monitors did their duty with any vigour, and the big
  idle fellows in the fifth set the example of insolence towards them and
  rudeness to the masters. All rules were set at defiance with impunity, and in
  the chaos which ensued, every one did what was right in his own eyes.</p>

  <p>One evening, during evening work, Charlie was trying hard to do the verses
  which had been set to his form. He found it very difficult in the noise that
  was going on. Not half a dozen fellows in the room were working or attempting
  to work; they were talking, laughing, rattling the desks, playing tricks on
  each other, and throwing books about the room. The one bewildered new master,
  who nominally kept order among the two hundred boys in the room, walked up
  and down in despair, speaking in vain first to one, then to another, and
  almost giving up the farce of attempting to maintain silence. But seeing
  Charlie seriously at work he came up and asked if he could give him any
  assistance.</p>

  <p>Charlie gratefully thanked him, and the master sat down to try and smooth
  some of his difficulties. His doing so was the sign for an audible titter,
  which there was no attempt to suppress; and when he had passed on, Wilton,
  whose conduct had been more impertinent than that of any one else, said to
  Charlie&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, young Evson, how you are grinding.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have these verses to do,&rdquo; said Charlie simply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Wilton, as though he had made some good
  joke. &ldquo;Here, shall I give you a wrinkle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if it&rsquo;s allowed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The answer was greeted with another laugh, and Wilton said,
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save you all further trouble, young &rsquo;un. Observe the
  dodge; we&rsquo;re all up to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He put up a white handkerchief to his nose, and walking to the master
  said, &ldquo;Please, sir, my nose is bleeding. May I go out for a
  minute?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your nose bleeding? That&rsquo;s the third time your nose has bled
  this week, and other boys have also come with their noses
  bleeding.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you doubt my word, sir?&rdquo; asked Wilton, his handkerchief
  still held up, and assuming an injured air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should be sorry to do so until you give me reason,&rdquo;
  answered the master, courteously. &ldquo;It seems a strange circumstance, but
  you may go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It would have been very easy to see whether his nose was bleeding or not,
  but the master was trying, very unsuccessfully at present, whether implicit
  confidence would produce a sense of honour among the boys.</p>

  <p>Wilton went out hardly concealing his laughter, and in ten minutes
  returned with the verses, finished and written out. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;Ken did those for me; he knocked them off in five minutes.
  Ken&rsquo;s an awfully clever fellow, though he never opens a book.
  Don&rsquo;t bore yourself with verses any more; I&rsquo;ll get them done for
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charlie glanced at the paper, and saw at once that the verses were
  perfectly done. &ldquo;Do you mean to show up that copy as your own,
  Wilton?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But we are marked for them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear! hear! thanks for the information. So much the better. I shall
  get a jolly good mark.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut up, young innocence, and don&rsquo;t be a muff,&rdquo; said
  another Noelite. &ldquo;We all do the same thing. Take what heaven sends you
  and be glad to get it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Charlie, looking round; &ldquo;you may, but
  I&rsquo;d rather not. It isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, how good we are! how sweet we are! what an angel we are!&rdquo;
  said Wilton, turning up the whites of his eyes, while the rest applauded him.
  But if they meant their jeers to tell on Charlie&rsquo;s resolution, they
  were mistaken. He looked quietly round at them all with his clear eyes,
  gravely handed the paper back to Wilton, and quietly resumed his work. They
  were angry to be so foiled, and determined that, if he would not copy the
  verses, he should at least do them in no other way. One of them took his
  paper and tore it, another split his quill pens by dashing them on the desk,
  while a third seized his dictionary. The master, observing that something was
  going on at that desk, came and stood by; and as long as he was there,
  Charlie managed to write out what he had done, while the others, cunningly
  inserting an occasional mistake, or altering a few epithets, copied out the
  verses which Kenrick had done for Wilton. But directly the master turned away
  again, a boy on the opposite side of the table, with the utmost deliberation,
  took hold of Charlie&rsquo;s fair copy, and emptied the inkstand over it in
  three or four separate streams.</p>

  <p>Vexed as he was&mdash;for until this time he had never known
  unkindness&mdash;he took it quietly and good-humouredly. Next morning, before
  the rest of the boys in his dormitory, who were mainly in his own form, were
  aware of what he meant to do, he got up early and went to Walter&rsquo;s
  study, hoping to write out the verses there from memory. But he found the
  study in the possession of the housemaid; chapel-bell rang, and after chapel
  he went into morning school with the exercise unfinished. For this, he, the
  only boy in the form who had attempted to do his duty, received a punishment,
  while the rest looked on unabashed, and got marks for their stolen work.
  Wilton received nearly full marks for his. The master, Mr Paton&rsquo;s
  successor, thought it odd that Wilton could do his verses so much better than
  any of his other work, but he could not detect the cheating, and Wilton
  always assured him that the verses were entirely his own composition.</p>

  <p>It was about time now, Wilton thought, to hoist his true colours; but, as
  he had abundance of brass, he followed Charlie out of the schoolroom, talked
  to him familiarly, as if nothing had happened, and finally took his arm. But
  this was too much; for the boy, who was as open as the day in all his
  dealings, at once withdrew his arm, and standing still, looked him full in
  the face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Wilton, &ldquo;now take your choice&mdash;friends
  or enemies&mdash;which shall it be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you want me to cheat, and tell lies, and be mean&mdash;not
  <i>friends</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So! enemies then, mind. Look out for squalls, young Evson. One
  question, though,&rdquo; said Wilton, as Charlie turned away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you going to sneak about this to your brother?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charlie was silent. Without any intention of procuring Walter&rsquo;s
  interference, he <i>had</i> meant to talk to him about his difficulties, and
  to ask his advice. But if this was to be stigmatised as sneaking he felt that
  he had rather not do it, for there is no action a boy fears more, and
  considers more mean than this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Wilton; &ldquo;you <i>do</i> mean to peach,
  blab, tell tales, do you? Well, it don&rsquo;t matter much; you&rsquo;ll find
  he can do precious little; and it will be all the worse for you in the
  long-run.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t tell him,&rdquo; said Charlie, shortly; and those
  words sealed his lips, as with a heavy heart he entered the breakfast-room,
  and meditated on troubles to come.</p>

  <p>Which troubles came quite fast enough&mdash;very fast indeed. For the
  house, or rather the leading spirits in it, thought that they had wasted
  quite enough time, and with quite sufficient success in angling for the new
  boys, and determined to resume without any further delay their ordinary
  courses. If Charlie was fool enough to resist them, they said, so much the
  worse for him. During the day, indeed, he was saved from many of the
  annoyances which Walter had been obliged to endure, by escaping from the
  Great Schoolroom to the happy and quiet refuge of Walter&rsquo;s, or
  Power&rsquo;s or Eden&rsquo;s study. There he could always be unmolested, and
  enjoy the kindness with which he was treated, and the cheerful, healthy
  atmosphere which contrasted so strangely in its moral sweetness with the
  turbid and polluted air of Noelite society. But in the evening at
  Preparation, and afterwards in the dormitories, he was wholly at the mercy of
  that bad confederacy which had tried to mould him to its own will. He was in
  a large dormitory of ten boys, and as this was the principal room in Mr
  Noel&rsquo;s house, it formed the regular refuge every night for the idle and
  the mischievously inclined. When the candles were put out at bed-time it was
  seldom long before they were relit in this room&mdash;which was somewhat
  remote from the others, at the end of a long corridor, and of which the
  window opened on a secluded part of Dr Lane&rsquo;s garden. If a scout were
  placed at the end of the corridor he could give timely warning of any danger,
  so that the chance of detection was very small. Had the candles been relit
  only for a game of play, Charlie would have been the first to join in the
  fun. But the Noelites were far too vitiated in taste to be long content with
  mere bolstering or harmless games. It seemed to Charlie that the candles were
  relit chiefly for the purpose of eating and drinking forbidden things, of
  playing cards, or of bullying and tormenting those boys who were least
  advanced in general wickedness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, young Evson,&rdquo; said Wilton to him one night soon after
  the fracas above narrated, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to have some fun to-
  night. Stone, like a brick as he is, has stood a couple of bottles of wine,
  and Hanley some cards. We shall have a smoke too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All this was said in a tone of braggadocio, meant to be exceedingly
  telling, but it only made Charlie feel that he loathed this swaggering little
  boy with his premature <i>savoir vivre</i>, more and more. He understood,
  too, the hint that two of the new fellows had contributed to the house
  carousal, and fully expected that he would be asked next. He secretly,
  however, determined to refuse, because he knew well that a mere harmless
  feast was not intended, but rather a smoking and drinking bout. He had
  subscribed liberally to all the legitimate funds&mdash;the football, the
  racquet court, the gymnasium; but he saw no reason why he should be taxed for
  things which he disliked and disapproved. The result of that evening
  confirmed him in his resolution. It was a scene of drinking, gluttony, secret
  fear, endless squabbling, and joyless excitement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll play, and put into the pool?&rdquo; said
  Wilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, <i>thank you</i>,&rdquo; said Wilton, scornfully mimicking his
  tone. &ldquo;Of course not; you&rsquo;ll do nothing except set yourself up
  for a saint, and make yourself disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>During the evening Stone brought him some wine, which Charlie again
  declined, with &ldquo;No, thank you, Stone.&rdquo; Wilton again echoed the
  refusal, which was chorused by a dozen others; and from that time Charlie was
  duly dubbed with the nickname of &ldquo;No-thank-you.&rdquo; He was forcibly
  christened by this new name, by being held in bed while half a wine-glass of
  port was thrown in his face. The wine poured down and stained his
  night-shirt, and then they all began to dread that it would lead to their
  being discovered, and threatened Charlie with endless penalties if he dared
  to tell. There was, however, little danger, as the Noelites had bribed the
  servants who waited on them and cleaned their rooms.</p>

  <p>The same scene, with slight variations, was constantly repeated, and every
  fresh refusal was accompanied by a kick or a cuff from the bigger boys, a
  sneer or an insult from the younger; for Charlie himself was one of the
  youngest of them all. One night it was, &ldquo;I say, you fellow&mdash;you,
  No-thank-you&mdash;will you fork out for some wine to-night? No? Well then,
  take that and that, and be hung to you for a little muff.&rdquo; Another time
  it would be, &ldquo;Hi there, No-thank-you&mdash;we want sixpence for a pack
  of cards. Oh, you won&rsquo;t be so sinful as to part with sixpence for
  cards? Confounded little miser;&rdquo; &ldquo;Niggard,&rdquo; said another;
  &ldquo;Skinflint,&rdquo; shouted a third. And a general cry of
  &ldquo;Saint,&rdquo; which expressed the climax of villainy, ended the verbal
  portion of the contest. And then, some one would slap him on the cheek, with
  &ldquo;take that,&rdquo; &ldquo;and that,&rdquo; from another, &ldquo;and
  that,&rdquo; from a third&mdash;the last being a boot or a piece of soap
  shied at his head.</p>

  <p>It cannot be more wearisome to the reader than it is to me to linger in
  these coarse scenes; but, for Charlie, it was a long martyrdom most
  heroically borne. He was almost literally alone and single-handed against the
  rest of the house; yet he would not give way. Walter, and Power, and
  Henderson, all knew that he was bullied, sorely bullied; this they learnt far
  more from Eden, and from other sources, than from Charlie himself, for he,
  poor child, held himself bound by his promise to Wilton, and kept his lips
  resolutely sealed. But these friends knew that he was suffering for
  conscience sake; and Walter helped him with tender, brotherly affection, and
  Power with brave words and kindly sympathy, as well as by noble example, and
  Henderson by his cheering and playful manner; and this caused him much
  happiness all day long, until he felt that, with that short but heart-uttered
  prayer which he breathed so earnestly from &ldquo;the altar of his own
  bedside,&rdquo; he had strength sufficient to meet and to conquer the trials
  which night brought.</p>

  <p>In the house one boy and one only helped him. That boy <i>ought</i> to
  have been Kenrick; his monitorial authority and many responsible privileges
  were entrusted to him, as he well knew, for the main express purpose of
  putting down all immorality, and all cruelty, with a strong and remorseless
  hand. It required very little courage to do this; the sympathies of the
  majority of boys, unless they be suffered to grow corrupted with an evil
  leaven, are naturally and strongly on the side of right. In Mr
  Robertson&rsquo;s house, for instance, where Walter and Henderson were
  monitors, such wrong-doings could not have gone on with impunity, or rather
  could not have gone on at all. There, a little boy, treated with gross
  severity or injustice, would not have hesitated for an instant to invoke the
  assistance of the monitors, whom he looked upon as his natural guardians, and
  who would be eager to extend to him a generous and efficient protection.</p>

  <p>The same was the case in Mr Edwardes&rsquo;s house, of which Power was the
  head. Power, indeed, had no coadjutor on whom he could at all rely. One of
  the monitors associated with him was Legrange, who rather followed
  Kenrick&rsquo;s lead, and the other was Brown, who, though well-intentioned,
  was a boy of no authority. Yet these two houses were in a better condition
  than any others in the school, because the heads of them did their duty; and
  it was no slight credit to Walter and Henderson that their house stood higher
  in character than any other, although it contained both Harpour and Jones.
  This could not have been the case had not those two worthies found a powerful
  counterpoise in two other fifth-form fellows, Franklin and Cradock, whose
  excellence was almost solely due to Walter&rsquo;s influence. Kenrick, on the
  other hand, never interfered in the house, and let things go on exactly as
  they liked, although they were going to rack and ruin.</p>

  <p>Charlie&rsquo;s sole friend and helper in the house then was, not Kenrick,
  but Bliss. Poor Bliss quite belied his name, for his school work, in which he
  never could by any effort succeed, kept him in a state of lugubrious
  disappointment. Bliss lived a dim kind of life, seeing all sorts of young
  boys get above him and beat him in the race, and vaguely groping in thick
  mental darkness. Do what he could the stream of knowledge fled from his
  tantalised lip whenever he stooped to drink; and the fruits, which others
  plucked easily, sprang up out of his reach when he tried to touch the bough.
  He was constantly crushed by a desolating sense of his own stupidity; and yet
  his good temper was charming under all his trials, and he loved with a
  grateful humility all who tolerated his shortcomings. For this reason he had
  a sincere affection for Henderson, who plagued him, indeed, incessantly, but
  never in an unkind or insulting way; and who more than made up for the
  teasing by patient and constant help, without which Bliss would not have
  succeeded even as well as he did. Bliss was a strong active fellow, and good
  at the games, so that with most of the school he got on very well; but,
  nevertheless, he was generally set down as nearly half-witted&mdash;a mere
  dolt. Dolt or not, he did Charlie inestimable service; and if any boy is in
  like case with Bliss, let him take courage, for even the merest dolt has
  immense power for good as well as for harm, and Bliss extended to Charlie a
  gentle and manly sympathy which many a clever boy might have envied. He knew
  that Charlie was ill-used. Not being in the same dormitory, and joining very
  little in the house concerns, he was not able to interfere very directly in
  his aid; but he never failed to encourage him to resist iniquity of every
  kind. &ldquo;Hold out, young Evson,&rdquo; he would often say to him;
  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good, brave little chap, and don&rsquo;t give in;
  you&rsquo;re in the right and they in the wrong; and right is might, be sure
  of that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was something in those days to meet with approbation for well-doing
  among the Noelites; and Charlie, with genuine gratitude, never forgot
  Bliss&rsquo;s kind support; till Bliss left Saint Winifred&rsquo;s they
  continued firm friends and fast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you made any friends in the house?&rdquo; asked Mr Noel of
  Charlie on one occasion; for he often seized an opportunity of talking to his
  younger boys, for whom he felt a sincere interest, and whom he would gladly
  have shielded from temptation to the very utmost of his power, had he but
  known that of which he was unhappily so ignorant&mdash;the bad state of
  things among the boys under his care.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not many, sir,&rdquo; said Charlie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that. I like to see boys
  forming friendships for future life; and there are some very nice fellows in
  the house. Wilton, for instance, don&rsquo;t you like him? He&rsquo;s very
  idle and volatile, I know, but still he seems to me a pleasant
  boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charlie could hardly suppress a smile, but said nothing; and Mr Noel
  continued, &ldquo;Who is your chief friend, Evson, among my boys?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bliss, sir,&rdquo; said Charlie, with alacrity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bliss!&rdquo; answered Mr Noel in surprise. &ldquo;What makes you
  like him so much? Is he not very backward and stupid?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Charlie would not hear a word against Bliss, and speaking with all the
  open trustfulness of a new boy, he exclaimed, &ldquo;O sir, Bliss is an
  excellent fellow; I wish there were many more like him; he&rsquo;s a capital
  fellow, sir, I like him very much; he&rsquo;s the best fellow in the house,
  and the only one who stands by me when I am in trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve found <i>one</i> friend,
  Evson,&rdquo; said Mr Noel; &ldquo;no matter who he is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One way in which Bliss showed his friendship was by going privately to
  Kenrick, and complaining of the way in which Charlie was bullied. &ldquo;Why
  don&rsquo;t you interfere, Kenrick?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Interfere, pooh! It will do the young cub good; he&rsquo;s too
  conceited, by half.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never saw a little fellow <i>less</i> conceited,
  anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick stared at him. &ldquo;What business is it of yours, I should like
  to know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> business of mine; he is a good little fellow, and
  he&rsquo;s only kicked because the others can&rsquo;t make him as bad a lot
  as they are themselves; there&rsquo;s that Wilton&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut up about Wilton, he&rsquo;s a friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then more shame for you,&rdquo; said Bliss.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s worth fifty such chickens as little Evson, any
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Chickens!&rdquo; said Bliss, with a tone as nearly like contempt as
  he had ever assumed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s clear you don&rsquo;t know much about
  him; I wish, Kenrick, you&rsquo;d do your duty more, and then the house would
  not be so bad as it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick opened his eyes wide; he had never heard Bliss speak like this
  before. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the learned, the clever, the profound Bliss
  to teach <i>me my</i> duty,&rdquo; he said, with a proud sneer; &ldquo;what
  business have you to abuse the house, because it is not full of young ninnies
  like Evson? You&rsquo;re no monitor of mine, let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may sneer, Kenrick, at my being stupid, if you like; but, for
  all your cleverness, I wouldn&rsquo;t be you for something; and if you
  won&rsquo;t interfere, as you ought, <i>I will</i>, if I can.&rdquo; And as
  Bliss said this, with clear flaming anger, and fixed on Kenrick his eyes,
  which were lighted up with honest purpose, Kenrick thought he had never seen
  him look so handsome, or so fine a fellow. &ldquo;Yes, even <i>he</i> is
  superior to me now,&rdquo; he thought, with a sigh, as Bliss left the room.
  Poor Ken&mdash;there was no unhappier boy at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s; as he
  ate and ate of those ashy fruits of sin, they grew more and more dusty and
  bitter to his parched taste; as he drank of that napthaline river of wayward
  pride, it scorched his heart and did <i>not</i> quench his thirst.</p>

  <h2>XXXIII. &mdash; MARTYRDOM</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;... Since thou so deeply dost enquire,<br>
    I will instruct thee briefly why no dread<br>
    Hinders my entrance here. Those things alone<br>
    Are to be feared whence evil may proceed,<br>
    Nought else, for nought is terrible beside.&rdquo;</i><br>
    &mdash;Carey&rsquo;s <i>Dante</i>.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">GRADUALLY the persecutions to which Charlie was subjected
  mainly turned on one point. His tormentors were so far tired of bullying him,
  that they would have left him in comparative peace if he would have yielded
  one point&mdash;which was this.</p>

  <p>The Noelites were accustomed now and then to have a grand evening
  &ldquo;spread&rdquo; as they called it, and when they had finished this
  supper, which was usually supplied by Dan, they generally began smoking, an
  amusement which they could enjoy after the lights were out. The smokers used
  to sit in the long corridor, which, as I have said, led to their dormitory,
  and the scout was always posted to warn them of approaching danger; but as
  they did not begin operations till the master had gone his nightly rounds,
  and were very quiet about it, there was not much danger of their being
  disturbed. Yet although the windows of the corridor and dormitory were all
  left wide open, and every other precaution was taken, it was impossible to
  get rid of the fumes of tobacco so entirely as to avoid all chance of
  detection. They had, indeed, bribed the servants to secrecy, but what they
  feared was being detected by some master. The Noelites, therefore, of that
  dormitory had been accustomed to agree that if they were questioned by any
  master about the smell of smoking, they would all deny that any smoking had
  taken place. The other nine boys in the dormitory, with the doubtful
  exception of Elgood, had promised that they would stick to this assertion in
  case of their being asked. The question was, &ldquo;Would Charlie promise the
  same thing?&rdquo; If not, the boys felt doubly insecure&mdash;insecure about
  the stability of their falsehood and the secrecy of their proceedings.</p>

  <p>And Charlie Evson, of course, refused to promise this. Single-handed he
  fought this battle against the other boys in his house, and in spite of
  solicitation, coaxing, entreaty, threats and blows, steadily declared that he
  was no tell-tale, that he had never mentioned anything which had gone on in
  the house, but that <i>if he were directly asked</i> whether a particular act
  had taken place or not, he would still keep silence, but <i>could not and
  would not</i> tell a lie.</p>

  <p>Now some of the house&mdash;and especially Mackworth and Wilton&mdash;had
  determined, by the help of the rest, to crush this opposition, to conquer
  this obstinacy, as they called it; and, since Charlie&rsquo;s reluctance
  could not be overcome by persuasion or argument, to break it down by sheer
  force. So, night after night, a number of them gathered round Charlie, and
  tried every means which ingenuity or malice could suggest to make him yield
  on this one point; the more so, because they well knew that to gain one
  concession was practically to gain all, and Charlie&rsquo;s uprightness
  contrasted so unpleasantly with their own base compliances, that his mere
  presence among them became, from this circumstance, a constant annoyance. One
  boy with a high and firm moral standard, steadily and consistently good, can
  hardly fail to be most unpopular in a large house full of bad and reckless
  boys.</p>

  <p>It was a long and hard struggle; so long that Charlie felt as if it would
  last for ever, and his strength would give way before he had wearied-out his
  persecutors. For now it seemed to be a positive amusement, a pleasant
  occupation to them, night after night, to bully him. He dreaded, he shuddered
  at the return of evening; he knew well that from the time when Preparation
  began, till the rest were all asleep, he could look for little peace.
  Sometimes he was tempted to yield. He knew that at the bottom the fellows did
  not really hate him, that he might be very popular if he chose, even without
  going to nearly the same lengths as the others, and that if he would but
  promise not to tell, his assent would be hailed with acclamations. Besides,
  said the tempter, the chances are very strongly in favour of your not being
  asked at all about the matter, so that there is every probability of your not
  being called upon to tell the &ldquo;cram;&rdquo; for by some delicate
  distinction the falsehood presented itself under the guise of a
  &ldquo;cram,&rdquo; and not of a naked lie; <i>that</i> was a word the boys
  carefully avoided applying to it, and were quite angry if Charlie called it
  by its right name. One evening the poor little fellow was so weary and
  hopeless and sad at heart, and he had been thrashed so long and so severely,
  that he was <i>very</i> near yielding. A paper had been written, the signing
  of which was tacitly understood to involve a promise to deny that there had
  been any smoking at night if they were taxed with it; and all the boys except
  Elgood and Charlie had signed this paper. But the fellows did not care for
  Elgood; they knew that he dared not oppose them long, and that they could
  make him do their bidding whenever the time came. Well, one evening, Charlie,
  in a weak mood, was on the verge of signing the paper, and thus purchasing a
  cessation of the long series of injuries and taunts from which he had been
  suffering. He was sitting up in bed, and had taken the pencil in hand to sign
  his name. The boys, in an eager group round him, were calling him a regular
  brick, encouraging him, patting him on the back, and saying that they had
  been sure all along that he was a nice little fellow, and would come round at
  last. Elgood was among them, looking on with anxious eyes. He had immensely
  admired Charlie&rsquo;s brave firmness, and nothing but reliance on the
  strength of his stronger will had encouraged him in the shadow of opposition.
  &ldquo;If young Evson does it,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I will
  directly.&rdquo; Charlie caught the whisper; and in an agony of shame flung
  away the pencil. He had very nearly sinned himself, and forgotten the
  resolution which had been granted him in answer to his many prayers; but he
  had seen the effects of bad example, and nothing should induce him to lead
  others with him into sin. &ldquo;Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
  from evil,&rdquo; was the instant supplication which rose from his inmost
  heart, as he threw down the pencil and pushed the paper aside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> do it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I <i>must</i>
  not do it; I never told a lie in my life that I remember. Don&rsquo;t ask me
  any more.&rdquo; Instantly the tone and temper of the boys changed. A shower
  of words, which I will not repeat, assailed his ears; he was dragged out of
  bed and thrashed more unmercifully than he had ever been before. &ldquo;You
  shall give way in the end, mind that,&rdquo; was the last admonition he
  received from one of the bigger fellows, as he dragged himself to his bed,
  sobbing for pain, and aching with disquietude of heart. &ldquo;The sooner it
  is the better; for you little muffs and would-be saints don&rsquo;t go down
  with us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then for a few evenings, when the candles were put out, and the
  fellows had nothing better to do, it used to be the regular thing for some
  one to suggest, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s <i>bait</i> No-thank-you;
  it&rsquo;ll be rare fun.&rdquo; Then another would say, &ldquo;Come,
  No-thank-you, sign the paper like a good fellow, and spare yourself all the
  rest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; another insidious friend would add; &ldquo;I am quite
  sorry to see you kicked and thrashed so often.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll strike a light in one second if you will,&rdquo;
  suggested a fourth. &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t? oh, then, look out, Master
  No-thank-you, look out for squalls.&rdquo; But still, however beaten or
  insulted, holding out like a man, and not letting the tears fall if he could
  help it, though they swam in his eyes for pain and grief, the brave boy
  resisted evil, and would not be forced to stain his white soul with the
  promise of a lie.</p>

  <p>There were some who, though they dared not say anything, yet looked on at
  this struggle with mingled shame and admiration&mdash;shame for themselves,
  admiration for Charlie. It could not be but that there were some hearts among
  so many which had not seared the tender nerves of pity, and more than once
  Charlie saw kindly faces looking at him out of the cowardly group of
  tormentors, and heard timid words of disapprobation spoken to the worst of
  those who bullied him. More often, too, some young Noelite who met him during
  the day would seem to address him with a changed nature, would speak to him
  warmly and with friendliness, would show by little words and actions that he
  felt for him and respected him, although he had not courage enough to resist
  publicly the opposing stream. And others of the baser sort observed this.
  What if this one little new fellow should beat them after all, and end their
  domination, and introduce in spite of them a truer and better and more
  natural state of things? it was not to be tolerated for a moment, and he must
  be put down with a strong hand at once.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Charlie&rsquo;s heart was fast failing him, dying away within
  him; for under this persecution his health and spirits were worn out. His
  face, they noticed, was far paler than when he came, his looks almost
  haggard, and his manner less sprightly than before. He had honourably
  abstained hitherto from giving Walter any direct account of his troubles, but
  now he yearned for some advice and comfort, and went to Walter&rsquo;s study,
  not to complain, but to ask if Walter thought there was any chance of his
  father removing him to another school, because he felt that at Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s he could neither be happy nor in any way succeed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Charlie boy, what can I do for you?&rdquo; said Walter,
  cheerfully pushing away the Greek Lexicon and Aristophanes over which he was
  engaged, and wheeling round the armchair to the fire, which he poked till
  there was a bright blaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I disturbing you at your work, Walter?&rdquo; said the little
  boy, whose dejected air his brother had not noticed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Charlie, not a bit; <i>you</i> never disturb me. I was just
  thinking that it was about time to shut up, for it&rsquo;s almost too dark
  too read, and we&rsquo;ve nearly half an hour before tea-time; so come here
  and sit on my knee and have a chat. I haven&rsquo;t seen you for an age,
  Charlie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charlie said nothing, but he was in a weary mood, and was glad to sit on
  his brother&rsquo;s knee and put his arm round his neck; for he was more than
  four years Walter&rsquo;s junior, and had never left home before, and that
  night the homesickness was very strongly upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Charlie boy?&rdquo; asked Walter
  playfully. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this pale face and red eyes?
  I&rsquo;m afraid you haven&rsquo;t found Saint Winifred&rsquo;s so jolly as
  you expected; disenchanted already, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter, I&rsquo;m very, very miserable,&rdquo; said Charlie,
  overcome by his brother&rsquo;s tender manner towards him; and leaning his
  head on Walter&rsquo;s shoulder he sobbed aloud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Charlie?&rdquo; said Walter, gently stroking his light
  hair. &ldquo;Never be afraid to tell me anything. You&rsquo;ve done nothing
  wrong, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O no, Walter. It&rsquo;s because I won&rsquo;t do wrong that they
  bully me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that it? Then dry your tears, Charlie boy, for you may thank
  God, and nothing in earth or under the earth can <i>make</i> you do wrong if
  you determine not&mdash;determine in the right way, you know,
  Charlie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so hard, Walter; I didn&rsquo;t know it would be so
  <i>very</i> hard. The house is so bad, and no one helps me except Bliss. I
  don&rsquo;t think you were ever troubled as I am, Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Charlie. Only don&rsquo;t go wrong whatever they do to
  you. You don&rsquo;t know how much this will smooth your way all the rest of
  your school-life. It&rsquo;s quite true what you say, Charlie, and the state
  of the school is far worse than ever knew it; but that&rsquo;s all the more
  reason we should do our duty, isn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter, but I <i>know</i> they&rsquo;ll make me do wrong some
  day. I wish I were at home. I wish I might leave. I get thrashed and kicked
  and abused every night, Walter, and almost all night long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Do</i> you?&rdquo; asked Walter, in angry amazement. &ldquo;I
  knew that you were rather bullied&mdash;Eden told me that&mdash;but I never
  knew it was so bad as you say. By jove, Charlie, I should like to catch some
  one bullying you, and&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll warrant that he shouldn&rsquo;t
  do it again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, I forgot, Walter, I oughtn&rsquo;t to have told you; they made
  me promise not. Only it <i>is</i> so wretched.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, my poor little Charlie,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;Do
  what&rsquo;s right and shame the devil. I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t
  devise some way of helping you; but anyhow, hold up till the end of term, and
  then no doubt papa will take you away if you still wish it. But what am I to
  do without you, Charlie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear, dear good brother,&rdquo; said Charlie,
  gratefully; &ldquo;and but for you, Walter, I should have given in long
  ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Charlie, not for me, but for a truer friend than even I can be,
  though I love you with all my heart. But will you promise me one thing
  faithfully?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that I will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, promise me then that, do what they will, they shan&rsquo;t
  make you tell a lie, or do anything else that you know to be
  wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise you, Walter, if I can,&rdquo; said the little
  boy humbly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been doing my best for a long
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> tell a lie, Charlie boy, without being
  found out; <i>that</i> I feel sure of,&rdquo; said Walter, smiling, as he
  held his brother&rsquo;s ingenuous face between his hands, and looked at it.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt you for an instant; but I&rsquo;ll have a talk
  with Power about you. As head of the school he may be able to do something,
  perhaps. It&rsquo;s Kenrick&rsquo;s duty properly, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kenrick, Walter? He&rsquo;s of no use; he lets the house do just as
  it likes, and I think he must have taken a dislike to me, for he turned me
  off quite roughly from being his fag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind him or any one else, Charlie. You&rsquo;re a brave
  little fellow, and I&rsquo;m proud of you. There&rsquo;s the tea-bell; come
  in with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Walter, it&rsquo;s only in the evenings when you&rsquo;re away
  that I get pitched into. If I were but in the same house with you, how jolly
  it would be.&rdquo; And he looked wistfully after his brother as they parted
  at the door of the hall, and Walter walked up to the chief table where the
  monitors sat, while he went to find a place among the boys in his own form
  and house. He found that they had poured his tea into his plate over his
  bread and butter, so he got very little to eat or drink that evening.</p>

  <p>It was dark as they streamed out after tea to go into the Preparation-
  room, and he heard Elgood&rsquo;s tremulous voice saying to him, &ldquo;Oh,
  Evson, shall you give way to-night, and sign?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why to-night in particular, Elgood?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve heard them say that they&rsquo;re going to have
  a grand gathering to-night, and to make you, and me too; but I can&rsquo;t
  hold out as you do, Evson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall try not to give way; indeed, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> be made
  to tell a lie,&rdquo; said Charlie, thinking of his interview with Walter,
  and the hopes it had inspired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; said Elgood, plucking up
  courage. &ldquo;But we shall catch it awfully, both of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do more than lick us,&rdquo; said Charlie, trying
  to speak cheerily, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been licked so often that I&rsquo;m
  getting accustomed to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d rather be licked,&rdquo; said a voice beside them,
  &ldquo;and be like you two fellows, than escape being licked, and be like
  Stone and Symes, or even like myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Elgood hastily, for it was not light
  enough to see.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me&mdash;Hanley. Don&rsquo;t you fellows give in; it will only make
  you miserable, as it has done me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went in to Preparation, which was succeeded by chapel, and then to
  their dormitories. They undressed and got into bed, as usual, although they
  knew that they should be very soon disturbed, for various signs told them
  that the rest had some task in hand. Accordingly, the lights were barely put
  out, when a scout was posted, the candles were re-lighted, and a number of
  other Noelites, headed by Mackworth, came crowding into the dormitory.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you, No-thank-you, you&rsquo;ve got one last
  chance&mdash;here&rsquo;s this paper for you to sign; fellows have always
  signed it before, and <i>you</i> shall too, whether you like or no.
  We&rsquo;re not going to alter our rules because of you. We want to have a
  supper again in a day or two, and we can&rsquo;t have you sneaking about
  it.&rdquo; Mackworth was the speaker.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sneak,&rdquo; said Charlie firmly;
  &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been making me wretched, and knocking me about, all these
  weeks, and I&rsquo;ve never told of you yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any orations; only Yes or No&mdash;will you
  sign?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Wilton, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s another fellow, Mac,
  who hasn&rsquo;t signed;&rdquo; and he dragged Elgood out of bed by one
  arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i> haven&rsquo;t signed, haven&rsquo;t you? Well, we
  shall make short work of you. Here&rsquo;s the pencil, here&rsquo;s the
  paper, and here&rsquo;s the place for your name. Now, you poor little fool,
  sign without giving us any more trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Elgood trembled and hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Mackworth brutally; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  want to break such a butterfly as you upon the wheel, but&mdash;how do you
  like that?&rdquo; He drew a cane from behind his back, and brought it down
  sharply on Elgood&rsquo;s knuckles, who, turning very white, sat down and
  scrawled his name hastily on the paper; but no sooner had he done it than,
  looking up, he caught Charlie&rsquo;s pitying glance upon him, and running
  the pencil through his signature, said no more, but pushed the paper hastily
  away and cowered down, expecting another blow, while Charlie whispered,
  &ldquo;Courage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must take the other fellow first, Mac, if you want to get
  on,&rdquo; suggested Wilton. &ldquo;Evson, as a friend, I advise you not to
  refuse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>As a friend</i>!&rdquo; said Charlie, with simple scorn, looking
  full at Wilton. &ldquo;You are no friend of mine; and, Wilton, I
  wouldn&rsquo;t even now change places with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&mdash;Pitch into him, Mac. And you,&rdquo; he
  said to Elgood, &ldquo;you may wait for the present.&rdquo; He administered a
  backhander to Elgood as he spoke, and the next minute Charlie, roused beyond
  all bearing, had knocked him down. Twenty times before he would have been
  tempted to fight Wilton, if he could have reckoned upon fair play; but what
  he could stand in his own person was intolerable to him to witness when
  applied to another.</p>

  <p>Wilton sprang up in perfect fury, and a fight began; but Mackworth at once
  pulled Charlie off, and said, &ldquo;Fight him another time, if you
  condescend to do so, Raven; don&rsquo;t you see now that it&rsquo;s a mere
  dodge of his to get off. Now, No-thank-you, the time has come for deeds;
  we&rsquo;ve had words enough. You stand there.&rdquo; He pushed Charlie in
  front of him. &ldquo;Now, will you sign?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Never</i>,&rdquo; said Charlie, in a low but firm tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Not with the cane, not with the cane</i>, Mackworth,&rdquo;
  cried several voices in agitation, but not in time to prevent the cane
  descending with heavy hand across the child&rsquo;s back.</p>

  <p>Charlie&rsquo;s was one of those fine, nervous, susceptible temperaments,
  which feel every physical sensation, and every mental emotion, with tenfold
  severity. During the whole of this scene; so painfully anticipated, in which
  he had stood alone among a group of boys, whose sole object seemed to be to
  show their hatred, and who were twice as strong as himself, his feelings had
  been highly wrought; and though he had had many opportunities of late to
  train his delicate organisation into manly endurance, yet the sudden anguish
  of this unexpected blow quite conquered him. A thrilling cry broke from his
  lips, and the next moment, when the cane again tore his shoulders, a fit of
  violent hysteria supervened, which alarmed the brutes who were trying to
  master his noble resolution.</p>

  <p>And at this crisis the door burst open with a sudden crash, and Bliss
  entered in a state of burning indignation, followed more slowly by
  Kenrick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O, I am too late,&rdquo; he said, stamping his foot; &ldquo;what
  <i>have</i> you been doing to the little fellow?&rdquo; and thrusting some of
  them aside, he took up Charlie in his arms, and gradually soothed and calmed
  him till his wild sobs and laughter were hushed, while the rest looked on
  silent. But feeling that Charlie shrank as though a touch were painful to
  him, Bliss unbared his back, and the two blue weals all across it showed him
  what had been done.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look there, Kenrick,&rdquo; he said, with great sternness, as he
  pointed to the marks; and then, laying Charlie gently down on his bed, he
  thundered out, in a voice shaken with passion, &ldquo;You <i>dogs</i>, could
  you look on and allow this? By heavens, Kenrick, if <i>you</i> mean to suffer
  this, I won&rsquo;t. Out of my way, you.&rdquo; Scattering the rest before
  him like a flock of sheep, he seized Mackworth with his strong hands, shook
  him violently by both shoulders, and then tearing the cane out of his grasp,
  he demanded, &ldquo;Was it you who did this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you about, you Bliss?&rdquo; said Mackworth, with very
  ruffled dignity. &ldquo;Mind what you&rsquo;re after, and don&rsquo;t make
  such a row, you ass&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; he continued authoritatively,
  &ldquo;or you&rsquo;ll have Noel or some one in here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ho! that&rsquo;s your tone, you cruel, reprobate bully,&rdquo; said
  Bliss, supplied by indignation with an unusual flow of words;
  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had enough of that, and too much. You can look at poor
  little Evson there, and not sink into the very earth for shame! By heavens,
  Belial, you shall receive what you&rsquo;ve given. I&rsquo;ll beat you as if
  you were a dog. Take that.&rdquo; The cut which followed showed that he was
  in desperate earnest, and that, however immovable he might generally be, it
  was by no means safe to trifle with him in such a mood as this.</p>

  <p>Mackworth tried in vain to seize the cane; Bliss turned him round and
  round as if he were a child; and as it was quite clear that he did not mean
  to have done with him just yet, Mackworth&rsquo;s impudent bravado was
  changed into abject terror as he received a second weighty stroke, so
  heartily administered that the cane bent round him, in the hideous way which
  canes have, and caught him a blow on the ribs.</p>

  <p>Mackworth sprang away, and fled, howling with shame and pain, through the
  open door, but not until Bliss had given him two more blows on the back, with
  one of the two cutting open his coat from the collar downwards, with the
  other leaving a mark at least as black as that which he had inflicted on the
  defenceless Charlie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To your rooms, the rest of you wretches,&rdquo; said he, as they
  dispersed in every direction before him. &ldquo;Kenrick,&rdquo; he continued,
  brandishing the cane, &ldquo;I may be a dolt, as you&rsquo;ve called me
  before now, but since you won&rsquo;t do your duty, henceforth I will do it
  for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick slank off, half afraid that Bliss would apply the cane to
  <i>him</i>; and, speaking in a tone of authority, Bliss said to the boys in
  the dormitory, &ldquo;If one of you henceforth touch a hair of Evson&rsquo;s
  head, look out; you know me. You little scamp and scoundrel, Wilton, take
  especial care.&rdquo; He enforced the admonition by making Wilton jump with a
  little rap of the cane, which he then broke, and flung out of the window. And
  then, his whole manner changing instantly into an almost womanly tenderness,
  he sat by poor little Charlie, soothing and comforting him till his
  hysterical sobs had ceased; and, when he felt sure that the fit was over,
  gently bade him good-night, and went out, leaving the room in dense silence,
  which no one ventured to break but the warm-hearted little Hanley, who, going
  to Charlie&rsquo;s bedside, said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Charlie, are you hurt much?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not very much, thank you, Hanley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hanley pressed his hand, and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve conquered, Charlie;
  you&rsquo;ve held out to the end. Oh, I wish I were like you!&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XXXIV. &mdash; A CONSPIRACY FOILED</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>As the feathery snows<br>
    Fall frequent on some wintry day...<br>
    The stony volleys flew.</i><br>
    &mdash;Cowper.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">YES, Charlie had conquered, thanks to the grace that
  sustained him, and thanks, secondarily, to a good home training, and to
  Walter&rsquo;s strong and excellent influence. And in gaining that one point
  he had gained all. No one dared directly to molest him further, and he had
  never again to maintain so hard a struggle. He had resisted the beginnings of
  evil; he had held out under the stress of persecution; and now he could enjoy
  the smoother and brighter waters over which he sailed.</p>

  <p>His enemies were for the time discomfited, and even the hardy Wilton was
  abashed. For a week or two there was considerably less bravado in his face
  and manner, and his influence over those of his own age was shaken. That
  little rap of the cane which Bliss had given him had a most salutary effect
  in diminishing his conceit. Hanley retracted his promise to deny all
  knowledge of anything wrong that went on, and openly defied Wilton; even
  Elgood ceased to fear him. Charlie had felt inclined to cut him, but, with
  generous impulse, he forgave all that was past, and, keeping on civil terms
  with him, did all he could to draw him to less crooked paths.</p>

  <p>Mackworth was so ashamed that he hardly ventured to show his face. He had
  always made Bliss a laughing-stock, had nicknamed him Ass&rsquo;s Head, and
  had taught others to jeer at his backwardness. He had presumed on his lazy
  good humour, and affected to patronise and look down on him. An eruption in a
  long-extinct volcano could not have surprised him more than the sudden
  outburst of Bliss&rsquo;s wrath, and if the two blows which he had received
  as he fled before him in sight of the whole house had been branded on his
  back with a hot iron, they could hardly have caused him more painful
  humiliation. For some time he slunk about like a whipped puppy, and imagined,
  not without some ground, that no one saw him without an inclination to
  smile.</p>

  <p>Kenrick, too, had reason to blush. Every one knew that it was Bliss, and
  not he, who had rescued the house from attaching to its name another
  indelible disgrace; and when he heard the monitors and sixth-form talking
  seriously among themselves of the bad state into which the Noelites had
  fallen, he felt that the stigma was deserved, and that <i>he</i>, as being
  the chief cause of the mischief, must wear the brand.</p>

  <p>All Kenrick&rsquo;s faults and errors had had their root in an overweening
  pride, a pride which grew fast upon him, and the intensity of which increased
  in proportion as it grew less and less justifiable. But now he had suffered a
  salutary rebuke. He had been openly blamed, openly slighted, and openly set
  aside, and was unable to gainsay the justice of the proceeding. He felt that
  with every boy in the school, who had any right feeling, Bliss was now
  regarded as a more upright and honourable&mdash;nay, even as a more important
  and influential, person than himself. Among other mortifications, it galled
  him especially to hear the warm thanks and cordial praise which Power and
  Walter and Henderson expressed when first they happened to meet Bliss. He saw
  Walter wring his hand, and overheard him saying in that genial tone in which
  he himself had once been addressed so often&mdash;&ldquo;Thank you, Bliss, a
  thousand times for saving my dear little brother from the hands of those
  brutes. Charlie and I will not soon forget how much we owe you.&rdquo; Walter
  said it with tears in his eyes, and Bliss answered with a happy
  smile&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me, Walter; I only did what any fellow
  would have done who was worth anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll look after Charlie for me now and then, will
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; said Bliss; &ldquo;but you needn&rsquo;t fear
  for him&mdash;he&rsquo;s a hero, a regular hero&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I
  call him, and I&rsquo;d do anything for him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Kenrick, vexed and discontented, almost hid himself in those days in
  his own study, the victim of that most wearing of intolerable and sickening
  diseases&mdash;a sense of shame. Except to play football occasionally, he
  seldom left his room or took any exercise, and fell into a dispirited, broken
  way of life, feeling unhappy and alone. He had no associates now except his
  inferiors, for his conduct had forfeited the regard of his equals, and with
  many of them he was at open feud. The only pleasure left to him was
  desperately hard work. Not only was he stimulated by a fiery ambition, a mad
  desire to excel in the half-year&rsquo;s competition, and show what he was
  yet capable of, and so to some extent redeem his unhappy position, but also
  his heart was fixed on getting, if possible, the chief scholarship of Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s&mdash;a scholarship sufficiently valuable to pay the main
  part of those college expenses which it would be otherwise impossible for his
  mother to bear. He feared, indeed, that he had little or no chance against
  Power, or even against Walter, who were both competitors, but he would not
  give up all hope. His abilities were of the most brilliant order, and if he
  had often been idle at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, he had, on the other hand,
  often worked exceedingly hard during the holidays at Fuzby, where, unlike
  other boys, he had little or nothing else to amuse him. Mrs Kenrick, sitting
  beside him silent at her work for long hours, would have been glad enough to
  see in him more elasticity, more kindliness, less absorption in his own
  selfish pursuits; but she rejoiced that at home, at any rate, he did not
  waste his vacant days in idleness, or spend them in questionable amusements
  and undesirable society.</p>

  <p>Almost the only boy of whom he saw much now was Wilton, and but for him, I
  do believe, that in those days he would have changed his whole tone of
  thought and mode of life. But he had a strange liking for this worthless boy,
  who kept alive in him his jealousy of Walter, his opposition to the other
  monitors, his partisanship, his recklessness, and his pride. Sometimes
  Kenrick felt this. He saw that Wilton was bad as well as attractive, and that
  their friendship, instead of doing Wilton any good, only did himself harm.
  But he could not make up his mind to throw him off, for there was no one else
  who seemed to feel for him as a close and intimate friend. Many of
  Kenrick&rsquo;s failings rose from that. He had offended, and rejected, and
  alienated his early and true friends, and he felt now that it was easier to
  lose friends than to make them, or to recover their affection when it once
  was lost.</p>

  <p>But the bad set at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, though in one house their
  influence was weakened, were determined not to see it wane throughout the
  school. Harpour and his associates organised a regular conspiracy against the
  monitors. When the first light snow fell they got together a very large
  number of fellows, and snowballed all the monitors except Kenrick, as they
  came out of morning school. The exception was very much to Kenrick&rsquo;s
  discredit, and in his heart he felt it to be so. During the first day or two
  that this lasted the monitors took it good-humouredly, returning the
  snowballs, and regarding it as a joke, though an annoying one; but when it
  became more serious, when some snowballs had been thrown at the masters also,
  and when some of the worst fellows began to collect snowballs beforehand and
  harden them into great lumps of ice as hard as stones, and when Brown, who
  was short-sighted, and was therefore least able to protect himself, had
  received a serious blow, Power, by the advice of the rest, put up a notice
  that from that time the snowballing must cease, or the monitors would have to
  punish the boys who did it. This notice the school tried to resist, but the
  firmness of Power and his friends put a stop to their rebellion. If the
  notice was disregarded he determined, by Walter&rsquo;s, advice, to seize the
  ringleaders, and not notice the younger boys whom they incited. Accordingly
  next morning they found the school gathered as usual, in spite of the notice,
  for the purpose of pelting them, and, saying nothing, they kept their eyes on
  the biggest fellows in the group. A shower of snowballs fell among them,
  hitting several of them, and, to the great amusement of the school, knocking
  over several hats into the snow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Harpour,&rdquo; said Walter, very sternly, &ldquo;I saw you throw a
  snowball. Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself that you, a fellow at the head
  of the eleven, should set such a bad example? Don&rsquo;t suppose that your
  size or position shall get you off. Come before the monitors directly after
  breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hanged if I do,&rdquo; answered Harpour, with a sulky laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I daresay you <i>will</i> be hanged in the long-run,&rdquo;
  was the contemptuous reply; &ldquo;but come, or else take the
  consequences.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tracy,&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;I saw you throw a snowball
  which knocked off Power&rsquo;s hat. It was a hard one too. You come before
  the monitors with Harpour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall be quaite delaighted,&rdquo; drawled out Tracy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it; I hope you&rsquo;ll be quaite equally delaighted
  when you leave us.&rdquo; The mimicry was so perfect that all the boys broke
  into a roar of laughter, which was all the louder because Tracy immediately
  began to chafe and &ldquo;smoke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And, Jones,&rdquo; said Power, as the laugh against Tracy subsided,
  &ldquo;I think I saw <i>you</i> throw a snowball and hit Smythe. I strongly
  suspect, too, that you were the fellow who hit Brown yesterday. I think every
  one will know, Jones, why you chose Smythe and Brown to pelt, instead of any
  other monitors. You too come to the sixth-form room after
  breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t throw one,&rdquo; said Jones.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You astounding liar,&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;I saw you with
  my own eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, ay; of course you&rsquo;ll say so to spite me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Spite</i> you,&rdquo; said Henderson scornfully; &ldquo;my dear
  fellow, you don&rsquo;t enter into my thoughts at all. But mark you, Master
  Jones, I know moreover that you&rsquo;ve been the chief getter-up of this
  precious demonstration. You told the fellows that you&rsquo;d lead them.
  I&rsquo;m not sure that you didn&rsquo;t quote to them the lines&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Press where ye see my <i>white plume</i> shine amid the
  ranks of war, And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet
  of&mdash;Jones.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Another peal of laughter followed this allusion to Jones&rsquo;s well-
  known nickname of White-feather, a nickname earned by many acts of
  conspicuous cowardice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Flip,&rdquo; whispered Power, &ldquo;we mustn&rsquo;t make
  this quite a joke. Jones,&rdquo; he continued aloud, &ldquo;do you deny
  throwing a snowball just now at Smythe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t throw one,&rdquo; said Jones, turning pale as he
  heard the hiss, and the murmur of &ldquo;White-feather again,&rdquo; which
  followed his denial.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what a pitiful, wretched, sneaking coward you are,&rdquo;
  burst out Franklin; &ldquo;I heard you egging on these fellows to pelt the
  monitors&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t have done it but for you and
  Harpour&mdash;and I saw you hit Smythe just now. You took care to pelt no one
  else, and now you deny it before all of us who saw you. Upon my word, Jones,
  I feel inclined to kick you, and I will too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop, Franklin,&rdquo; said Walter, laying his hands on his
  shoulder, &ldquo;leave him to us now. Do you still deny throwing,
  Jones?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it was only just a little piece of snow,&rdquo; said Jones,
  showing in his blotched face every other contemptible passion fused into the
  one feeling of abject fear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; said Power, with scorn and disgust curling his lip
  and burning in his glance; &ldquo;really, Jones, you&rsquo;re almost too mean
  and nasty to have any dealings with. I don&rsquo;t think we can do you the
  honour of convening you. You shall apologise to Smythe here and now, and that
  shall be enough for <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! do you hesitate?&rdquo; said Franklin; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
  know when you&rsquo;re well off. Be quick, for we all want our
  breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind making him apologise,&rdquo; said Smythe;
  &ldquo;he&rsquo;s sunk quite low enough already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his own doing,&rdquo; said Walter. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
  have lies like his told without a blush at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s. Apologise
  he must and shall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Mackworth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;is that Mackworth speaking? Ah!
  I thought so&mdash;Bliss isn&rsquo;t here!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Henderson&rsquo;s manner was irresistibly comic; and as Mackworth winced
  and slunk back to the very outside of the crowd, the loud laugh which
  followed showed that the complete exposure of the worthlessness of their
  champions had already turned the current of feeling among the young
  conspirators, and that they were beginning to regret their unprovoked attack
  on the upper boys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now then, Jones, this is what you have to read,&rdquo; said Walter,
  who had been writing it on a slip of paper&mdash;&ldquo;I humbly beg
  Smythe&rsquo;s pardon for pelting him, and the pardon of all present for my
  abominable lies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jones began to mumble it out, but there arose a general shout
  of&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On your knees, White-feather; on your knees, and much
  louder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Franklin, who was boiling over with anger and contempt, sprang forward,
  took Jones by the neck, and forced him on his knees in the snow, where he
  made him read the apology, and then let him loose. A shower of snowballs
  followed him as he ran to the refuge of the breakfast-hall, for there was not
  a boy present, no matter to what faction he belonged, who did not feel for
  Jones a very hearty contempt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope we shall have no more of this, boys,&rdquo; said Power,
  before the rest dispersed. &ldquo;There have been monitors at Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s for a hundred years now, and it&rsquo;s infinitely better
  for the school that there should be. I suppose you would hardly prefer to be
  at the mercy of such a fellow as that,&rdquo; he said, pointing in the
  direction of Jones&rsquo;s flight. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why we should be
  unpopular amongst you. You know that not one of us has ever abused his
  authority, or behaved otherwise than kindly to you all. But I am sorry to see
  that you are set on&mdash;set on by fellows who ought to know better.
  Don&rsquo;t suppose, any of you, that they will frighten us from doing what
  we know to be right, or that <i>you</i> can intimidate us when we are acting
  for the good of the school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They cheered his few simple words, for they were proud of him as head-
  monitor. They had never had at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s a better scholar, or a
  more honourable boy; and though Harpour and his friends affected to sneer at
  him, Power was a general favourite, and the firm attitude which he now
  assumed increased the respect and admiration which he had always
  inspired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No more notice will be taken of this, you little fellows,&rdquo;
  said Walter to the crowd of smaller boys; &ldquo;we know very well that you
  have merely been the tools in other hands, and that is why we only singled
  out three fellows. I am quite sure you won&rsquo;t behave in this way again;
  but if you do, remember we shan&rsquo;t pass it over so lightly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come here you, Wilton,&rdquo; said Henderson, as the rest were
  dispersing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been particularly busy, I see. So! six good
  hard snowballs in your jacket pocket, eh? Now, you just employ yourself in
  collecting every one of these snowballs that are lying ready here, and throw
  them into the pond. Don&rsquo;t let me see <i>one</i> when I come out. Belial
  junior will have to curtail his breakfast-time this morning, I guess,&rdquo;
  he continued to Whalley; &ldquo;the young villain! shall we ever bring him to
  a right mind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Wilton, in a diabolical frame of mind, began his appointed task, and had
  just finished it as the boys came out of breakfast. &ldquo;That will
  do,&rdquo; said Henderson. &ldquo;I must trouble you for one minute more.
  Come with me.&rdquo; Shaking with cold and alarm, Wilton obeyed, muttering
  threats of vengeance, and driven almost frantic by the laughter with which
  Henderson received them. He walked across to the sixth-form room, and then
  seeing that all the monitors were assembled, sent him &ldquo;to tell his
  friends, Harpour and Tracy, that their presence was demanded
  immediately.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Raven,&rdquo; said Kenrick to him; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
  shame of them to bully you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have made him collect some snowballs which he had a chief hand in
  making, and with one of which yesterday a monitor was seriously hurt; then I
  have sent him a message for two worthless fellows, whose counsels he
  generally follows; both of which things I have done to teach him a mild but
  salutary lesson. Is that what you call bullying?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe you spite the boy because you know I like him. It&rsquo;s
  just the kind of conduct worthy of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it gives you any comfort to say so, Kenrick, pray do; but let me
  tell you, that after the way you have allowed young Evson and others to be
  treated in your house, the charge of bullying comes with singularly ill grace
  from you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>An angry retort sprang to Kenrick&rsquo;s lips; but at that moment the two
  offenders came to the door, and Power said, &ldquo;Hush, you two. We need
  unity now, if ever, and it will be very harmful if these fellows find a
  quarrel going on Kenrick, I wish you would try to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh; yes; it&rsquo;s always Kenrick, of course,&rdquo; said he
  angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with your proceedings;&rdquo;
  and, rising, from his place, he flung out of the room, not sorry to be absent
  from a scene which he thought might compromise his popularity with some of
  those who excepted him from the list of the monitors, whom they professed to
  consider as their natural enemies.</p>

  <p>Harpour and Tracy had thought that when convened before the monitors they
  would have an opportunity for displaying plenty of insolence and
  indifference; but when they found themselves standing in the presence of
  those fifteen upper boys, each one of whom was in all respects their
  superior, all their courage evaporated. But they were let off very easily.
  The monitors were content with the complete triumph they had gained that
  morning, and with the disgrace to which these fellows had been compelled to
  submit. All that they now required from them was an expression of regret for
  what they had done, and a promise not to offend in the same way again; and
  when these had been extorted, they were dismissed by Power with some good
  advice, and a tolerably stern reprimand. Power did this with an ease and
  force which moved the admiration of all his brother monitors; no one could
  have done it as he did it, who was not supported by the authority of a high
  and stainless character consistently maintained. What he said was not without
  effect; even the coarse burly Harpour dared not look up, but could only fix
  his eyes on the floor and kick the matting in sullen wrath while this
  virtuous and noble boy looked at him and rebuked him; but Tracy was more
  deeply moved. Tracy, weak, foolish, and feebly fast as he was, had some
  elements of good and gentlemanly feeling in him, and, with more wisely chosen
  associates, would have developed a much less contemptible character. When
  Power had done speaking, he looked up and said, without one particle of his
  usual affectation&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I really am sorry for helping to get up this affair. I see
  I&rsquo;ve been in the wrong, and I beg pardon sincerely. You may depend on
  my not having anything more to do with a thing of this kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Tracy,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;that was spoken like a
  man. We&rsquo;ve known each other for some time now, and I wish we could get
  on more unitedly. You might do some good in the school if you
  chose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not much, I&rsquo;m afraid now,&rdquo; said Tracy, &ldquo;but
  I&rsquo;ll tr(ai)y.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, Tracy, we&rsquo;ll shake hands on that resolve, and
  bygones shall be bygones,&rdquo; said Henderson. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll forgive
  my making fun of you this morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook hands with Henderson and with Walter, while Power, holding out
  his hand, said, smiling, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late to mend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tracy, looking at one of his boots, which he had a
  habit of putting out before the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He applied your remark to his boots, Power,&rdquo; said Henderson,
  laughing. &ldquo;Did you observe how the hole in one of them distressed
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So the monitors separated, not without hopes that things were beginning to
  look a little brighter than before.</p>

  <h2>XXXV. &mdash; THE FINAL FRACAS</h2>

  <p class="first">HARPOUR, and all who, like him, had long been endeavouring
  to undermine the authority which was the only safeguard to the morality of
  the school, felt themselves distinctly baffled. Mackworth had been put to
  utter rout by Bliss, and though he was almost bursting with dark spite, would
  not venture to do much; Jones had become a perfect joke through the whole
  school, and was constantly having white hen&rsquo;s feathers and
  goose-feathers enclosed to him in little envelopes until he was half mad with
  impotent wrath; Harpour himself had been made very decidedly to swallow the
  leek of public humiliation; and as for Wilton, he began to feel rather
  small.</p>

  <p>Tracy again had openly deserted them. After the interview with Power,
  Harpour had abused him roundly as a turncoat, and he had told his former
  associates that he was sorry to have had anything to do with their
  machinations; that they were going all wrong, and were ruining the school,
  and that he at any rate felt that he had done mischief enough already, and
  meant to do no more. This proof of their failing influence exasperated them
  greatly. Harpour threatened, and Mackworth said all the pungent and insulting
  things he could, contemptuously mimicking all Tracy&rsquo;s dandiacal
  affectations. Tracy winced under this treatment; high words followed, and
  after a scene of noisy altercation, Tracy broke with his former
  &ldquo;party,&rdquo; and after the quarrel spoke to them no more.</p>

  <p>Dr Lane, too, had now recovered from his fever, and returned to the
  school. When the reins were in his strong hands, the difference was soon
  perceived. The abuses which had crept in during his absence were quietly and
  firmly rectified, and all tendencies to insubordination were repressed with a
  stern and just decision which it was impossible to gainsay or to resist. The
  whole aspect of things altered, and, lonely as he was among the Noelites,
  even Charlie Evson began to like Saint Winifred&rsquo;s better, and to feel
  more at home in its precincts.</p>

  <p>Still, those who were rebelliously inclined were determined not to give in
  at once, and anxiously looked out for some opportunity in which they could
  have Kenrick on their side. If they could but secure this, they felt
  tolerably confident of giving the monitors a rebuff, and of carrying with
  them that numerous body in the school who had been taught under their
  training to resist authority on every possible occasion.</p>

  <p>The opportunity was not long wanting. One fine afternoon a poor old woman
  had come up to the playground with a basket of trifles, by the sale of which
  she hoped to support herself during the unexpectedly long absence of a sailor
  son. Her extreme neatness of person, and her quiet, respectable manners had
  interested some of the boys in her appearance; and when she came up to sell
  the little articles, many of which her own industry had made, she generally
  found ready purchasers. Walter, who knew her well, had visited her cottage,
  and had often seen the sailor boy on whose earnings she in a great measure
  depended. This only son had now been away for some time on a distant voyage,
  and the poor woman, being pressed for the necessaries of life, took her
  basket once more to the playground of Saint Winifred&rsquo;s. Charlie had
  often heard about her from Walter, and he gladly made from her a few small
  purchases, in which the other boys followed his example. While he was doing
  this, he distinctly saw one of the Noelites&mdash;an ill-conditioned fellow
  in the shell, named Penn&mdash;thrust his hand into the old woman&rsquo;s
  basket, which was now surrounded by a large group of boys, and secrete a
  small bottle of scent. Charlie waited a moment, expecting to see him pay for
  it, but Penn, who fancied that he had been unobserved, dropped it quietly
  into his pocket, and stood looking on with an innocent and indifferent
  air.</p>

  <p>Instantly Charlie&rsquo;s indignation knew no bounds. He could hardly
  believe his own eyes; he knew that a few of the very worst in the school, and
  some in his own house in particular, would regard this as a venial offence.
  They would not call it stealing but &ldquo;bagging a thing,&rdquo; or, at the
  worst, &ldquo;cribbing it&rdquo;&mdash;concealing the villainy under a new
  name, a name with no very odious associations attached to it; just as they
  called lying &ldquo;cramming,&rdquo; under which title it sounded much less
  repulsive. In fact, these young Noelites took a most Spartan view of these
  petty larcenies, confining the criminality to the incurring of detection. But
  they had never succeeded in making Charlie take this view; he never would
  adopt the change of language by which they altered the accepted meaning of
  words in accordance with their own propensities and dispositions, and to him
  this particular act which Penn committed with perfect nonchalance, appeared
  to be not only a theft, but a theft accompanied by a cruelty and deadness to
  all sense of pity, which dipped it in the very blackest and most revolting
  dye. He could not restrain, and did not attempt to restrain, the passionate
  contempt and horror which he felt for this act.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Penn,&rdquo; he said, in a loud and excited voice, not doubting
  that the sympathies of the others would be as warm as his own, &ldquo;Penn,
  you wicked brute, you have stolen that bottle of scent. Here, Mrs Hart,
  <i>you</i> shan&rsquo;t suffer at any rate if there <i>is</i> a fellow so
  base and wicked,&rdquo; and he at once pulled out his last half-crown, and
  insisted on her taking it in payment for the stolen article.</p>

  <p>Penn, for the moment, was quite taken aback by the scathing flame of
  Charlie&rsquo;s righteous anger. If there had been none but Noelites there he
  would have made very light of the accusation, and probably have laughed it
  off; but there were others looking on who would, he knew, view the
  transaction in a very different light, so he thought that his safest course
  lay in a flat denial. It was not reasonable to expect that he would stick at
  this; a boy who has no scruples about &ldquo;bagging&rdquo; the property of a
  poverty-stricken old woman, is not likely to hesitate about telling a
  &ldquo;cram&rdquo; to escape exposure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about, you little fool? I haven&rsquo;t
  bagged anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charlie was still more amazed; he positively could not understand a great
  brazen lie like this, and yet it was impossible to doubt that it <i>was</i> a
  lie, against the evidence of his own senses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t take that scent-bottle? oh! how <i>can</i> you
  tell such a lie? I saw you with my own eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do I care for you or your eyes?&rdquo; was the only answer
  which Penn vouchsafed to return.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always flying out at fellows like a young turkey-
  cock, you No-thank-you,&rdquo; said Wilton. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you thrash
  him, Penn, for his confounded impudence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thrash him yourself if you like, Raven; I don&rsquo;t care the snap
  of a finger for what he says.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, No-thank-you, by charging him with bagging the
  thing when he says he didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said Wilton in a threatening tone
  to Charlie; and as Charlie took no notice, he enforced the question by a slap
  on the cheek; for Wilton had old grudges against Charlie to pay off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t speak to <i>you</i>, Wilton; but you shan&rsquo;t
  hit me for nothing; you force me to fight against my will,&rdquo; said
  Charlie, returning the blow; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m doing
  it to get off anything this time, as you did once before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A long and desperate fight ensued between Charlie and Wilton; too long and
  too desperate in the opinion of several of the bystanders; but as there was
  no one near who had any authority, nobody liked to interfere. So, as they
  were very equally matched, neither of the combatants showed the least sign of
  giving in, though their faces and clothes were smeared with blood. At last
  Henderson and Whalley, who were strolling through the playground, caught
  sight of the crowd, and came up to see what was the matter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fight,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;young Evson and
  Belial junior; I&rsquo;d much rather see them fight than see them
  friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Flip; but they&rsquo;ve evidently been fighting quite long
  enough to be good for them. You&rsquo;re a monitor&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t you
  see if they ought not to be separated, and shake hands?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hallo, stop, you two,&rdquo; said Henderson, pushing his way into
  the crowd. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about? let&rsquo;s see that
  it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fair fight,&rdquo; said several; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
  no right to stop it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop it unless there&rsquo;s good reason, though I
  think it&rsquo;s gone on long enough. What began it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No-thank-you charged Penn with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is No-thank-you?&rdquo; asked Whalley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young Evson, then,&rdquo; said Mackworth sulkily, &ldquo;charged
  Penn with bagging a scent-bottle from the old woman&rsquo;s basket, and then
  he was impudent, so Wilton was going to pitch into him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And couldn&rsquo;t manage it, apparently,&rdquo; said Whalley;
  &ldquo;come, you two, shake hands now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charlie, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, frankly held out his hand; but
  Wilton said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;d no right to accuse a Noelite falsely as he
  did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t falsely,&rdquo; said Charlie; &ldquo;I saw him take
  it, and a horrid shame it was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is one of your bottles missing, Mrs Hart?&rdquo; asked Whalley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but now young Master Evson has paid for it, and I
  don&rsquo;t want no more fighting about it, sir, please.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, my good woman, there&rsquo;s something for you,&rdquo; said
  Henderson, giving her a shilling; &ldquo;and I hope nobody will treat you so
  badly again; you&rsquo;d better go now. And now, Penn, if you didn&rsquo;t
  take the bottle, of course you won&rsquo;t mind being searched?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I <i>shall</i>,&rdquo; said Penn, edging uneasily away to
  try if possible to get rid of the unlucky bottle, which now felt as if it
  burned his pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay, my friend,&rdquo; said Whalley, collaring him; &ldquo;no
  shuffling away, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the devil is your right to search me?&rdquo; said Penn,
  struggling in vain under Whalley&rsquo;s grasp; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
  fellows let him search me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The attention of all was now fairly diverted from the fight, which,
  therefore, remained undecided; while the boys, especially the Noelites,
  formed an angry group round Henderson and Whalley, to prevent them, if
  possible, from any attempt to search Penn. Meanwhile, seeing that something
  was going on, other boys came flocking up until a large number of the school
  were assembled there, while Whalley still kept tight hold of Penn, and
  Henderson watched that he should play no tricks; the Noelites meantime
  exclaiming very loudly against the supposed infringement of their abstract
  rights.</p>

  <p>Kenrick was one of those who had now come up; and as several fellows
  entreated him to stick up for his own house, and not to let Penn be searched,
  he worked himself into a passion, and pushing into the circle, said loudly,
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to search him; you shan&rsquo;t do
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the head of the school, he shall decide,&rdquo; said
  Henderson, as Power and Walter approached. &ldquo;State your own case,
  Kenrick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, the case simply is, that a scent-bottle has been taken from
  Mrs Hart; and Penn doesn&rsquo;t see&mdash;nor do I&mdash;why he should be
  searched.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t mentioned that young Evson says he <i>saw</i> him
  take it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Charlie, what <i>have</i> you been doing?&rdquo; said Walter,
  looking at his brother&rsquo;s bruised and smeared face in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only a fight,&rdquo; said Charlie; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it,
  Walter; Wilton struck me because I charged Penn with taking the
  bottle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you absolutely certain that you saw him, Charlie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I couldn&rsquo;t possibly be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, clearly Penn must be searched,&rdquo; said Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But stop,&rdquo; said Power; &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t we beginning at
  the wrong end? Penn, no doubt, if we ask him quietly, will empty his pockets
  for our satisfaction?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Penn, who was now dogged and
  sullen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Kenrick has taken your part, will you let him or me search
  you privately?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then search him, Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Instantly a rapid movement took place among the boys as though to prevent
  this; but before anything could be done, Henderson had seized Penn by both
  wrists and Whalley, diving a hand into his right pocket, drew out and held up
  a little ornamental scent-bottle!</p>

  <p>This decisive proof produced for a moment a dead silence among the loud
  voices raised in altercation; and then Power said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Penn, you are convicted of lying and theft. What is Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s coming too, when fellows can act like this? How am I to
  punish him?&rdquo; he asked, turning to some of the monitors.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here and now, red-handed, <i>flagrante delicto</i>,&rdquo; said
  Walter. &ldquo;Some of these lower fellows need an example.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you are right. Symes, fetch me a cane.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t touch him,&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
  no right to search him, in the first place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean to cane him, Kenrick. Who will prevent me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; said several voices; among which Harpour&rsquo;s
  and Mackworth&rsquo;s were prominent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean to try and prevent it by force?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And, Kenrick, you abet this?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Kenrick, who had lost all self-control.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall do it, nevertheless; it is my plain duty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I recommend you all not to interfere,&rdquo; said Walter;
  &ldquo;for it must and shall be done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Harpour,&rdquo; said Franklin, &ldquo;remember, if you try force, I
  for one am against you the moment you stir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Bliss, stepping in front of Power; &ldquo;and
  I,&rdquo; said Eden, Cradock, Anthony, and others&mdash;among whom was
  Tracy&mdash;taking their places by the monitors, and forming a firm front
  together.</p>

  <p>Symes brought the cane. Power took it, and another monitor held Penn
  firmly by the wrists. At the first stroke, some of the biggest fifth-form
  fellows made a rush forward, but they were flung back, and could not break
  the line, while Harpour measured his full length on the turf from the effects
  of the buffet which Franklin dealt him. Kenrick was among those who pressed
  forward; and then, to his surprise and shame, Walter, who was the stronger of
  the two, grasped him by the shoulder, held him back, and said in a low tone,
  firm yet kind, &ldquo;You must excuse my doing this, Kenrick; but otherwise
  you might suffer for it, and I think you will thank me afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick was astonished, and he at once desisted. Those were the first and
  only words which Walter had spoken to him, the only time Walter had touched
  him, for nearly three years; and in spite of all the abuse, calumny, and
  opposition which Walter had encountered at his hands, Kenrick could not but
  feel that they were wise words, prompted, like the action itself, by the
  spirit of true kindness. He said nothing, but abruptly turned away and left
  the ground.</p>

  <p>The struggle had not lasted a moment, and it was thoroughly repulsed.
  There could not be the least doubt of that, or of the fact that those who
  were on the side of righteous order outnumbered and exceeded in strength the
  turbulent malcontents. Power inflicted on Penn a severe caning there and
  then. The attempt to prevent this, audacious and unparalleled as it was,
  afforded by its complete failure yet another proof that things were coming
  round, and that these efforts of the monitors to improve the tone of the
  lower boys would tell with greater and greater force. Even the character of
  the Noelites was beginning to improve; in that bad house not a single little
  new boy had successfully braved an organised antagonism to all that was good,
  and by his victorious virtuous courage had brought over others to the side of
  right, triumphing, by the mere force of good principle, over a banded
  multitude of boys far older, abler, and stronger than himself.</p>

  <p>So that now Harpour, Mackworth, and Jones, were confined more and more to
  their own society, and were forced to keep their misconduct more and more to
  themselves. They sullenly admitted that they were foiled and thwarted, and
  from that time forward left the school to recover as fast as it could from
  their vicious influence. Among their other consolations&mdash;for they found
  themselves shunned on all sides&mdash;they proposed to go and have a supper
  at Dan&rsquo;s. One day, before the events last narrated, Power had seen them
  go in there. He had sent for them at once, and told them that they must know
  how strictly this was forbidden, what a wretch Dan was, and how ruinous such
  visits to his cottage must be. They knew well that if he informed of them
  they would be instantly expelled, and entreated him with very serious
  earnestness to pass it over this time, the more so because they had no notion
  that any monitor would ever tell of them, <i>because since he had been a
  monitor, Kenrick had accompanied them there</i>. Shocked as he was to hear
  this, it had determined Power not to report them, on the condition, which he
  made known to the other monitors, and of which he specially and pointedly
  gave warning to Kenrick, that they would not so offend again. This promise
  they wilfully broke, feeling perfectly secure, because Dan&rsquo;s cottage
  was at a remote and lonely part of the shore, where few boys ever walked, and
  where they had very little chance of being seen, if they took the precaution
  of entering by a back gate. But within a week of Penn&rsquo;s thrashing,
  Walter was strolling near the cottage with Eden and Charlie, and having
  climbed the cliff a little way to pluck for Eden (who had taken to botany) a
  flower of the yellow horned poppy which was waving there, he saw them go into
  Dan&rsquo;s door, and with them&mdash;as he felt sure&mdash;little Wilton.
  The very moment, however, that he caught sight of them, the fourth boy,
  seeing him on the cliff, had taken vigorously to his heels and scrambled away
  behind the rocks. Walter had neither the wish nor the power to overtake him,
  and as he had not so much <i>seen</i> Wilton as inferred with tolerable
  certainty that it was he, he only reported Harpour, Mackworth, and Jones to
  Dr Lane; at the same time sending for Wilton to tell him of his suspicion,
  and to give him a severe and earnest warning.</p>

  <p>Dr Lane, on the best possible grounds, had repeatedly announced that he
  would expel any boy who had any dealings with the scoundrel Dan. He was not
  likely to swerve from that declaration in any case, still less for the sake
  of boys whose school career had been so dishonourable and reprobate as that
  of these three offenders. They were all three publicly expelled without mercy
  and without delay; and they departed, carrying with them, as they
  well-deserved to do, the contempt and almost the execration of the great
  majority of the school.</p>

  <p>In the course of their examination before the headmaster, Jones, with a
  meanness and malice thoroughly characteristic, had said, &ldquo;that he did
  not know there was any harm in going to Dan&rsquo;s, because Kenrick, one of
  the monitors, had done the same thing.&rdquo; At the time, Dr Lane had
  contemptuously silenced him, with the remark, &ldquo;that he would gain
  nothing by turning informer;&rdquo; but as Dr Lane was always kept pretty
  well informed of all that went on by the Famulus, he had reason to suspect,
  and even to know, that what Jones said was in this instance true. He knew,
  too, from other quarters how unsatisfactorily Kenrick had been going on, and
  the part he had taken in several acts of insubordination and disobedience.
  Accordingly, no sooner had Harpour, Jones, and Mackworth been banished from
  Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, than he sent for Kenrick, and administered to him a
  reprimand so uncompromising and stern, that Kenrick never forgot it to the
  end of his life. After upbraiding him for those many inconsistencies and
  follies, which had forfeited the strong esteem and regard which he once felt
  for him, he pointed out finally how he was wasting his school-life, and how
  little his knowledge and ability could redeem his neglect of duty and
  betrayal of trust; and he ended by saying, &ldquo;All these reasons, Kenrick,
  have made me seriously doubt whether I should not degrade you altogether from
  your position of monitor and head of a house. It would be a strong step, but
  not stronger than you deserve. I am alone prevented by a deep and sincere
  wish that you should yet recover from your fall; and that, by knowing that
  some slight trust is still reposed in you, you may do something to prove
  yourself worthy of that trust, and to regain our confidence. I content
  myself, therefore, with putting you from your present place to the
  <i>lowest</i> on the list of monitors&mdash;a public mark of my displeasure,
  which I am sure you will feel to be just; and I must also remove you from the
  headship of your house&mdash;a post which I grieve to know that you have very
  grievously misused. I shall put Whalley in your place, as it happens that no
  monitor can be conveniently spared. He, therefore, is now the head of Mr
  Noel&rsquo;s house; and, so far, you will be amenable to his authority,
  which, I hope, you will not attempt to resist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick, very full of bitter thoughts, hung his head, and said nothing. To
  know Dr Lane was to love and to respect him; and this poor fatherless boy
  <i>did</i> feel very great pain to have incurred his anger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am unwilling, Kenrick,&rdquo; continued the Doctor, &ldquo;to
  dismiss you without adding one word of kindness. You know, my dear boy, that
  I have your welfare very closely at heart, and that I once felt for you a
  warm and personal regard; I trust that I may yet be able to bestow it upon
  you again. Go and use your time better; remember that you are a monitor;
  remember that the well-being of many others depends in no slight measure on
  your conscientious discharge of your duties; check yourself in a career which
  only leads fast to ruin; and thank God, Kenrick, that you are not actually
  expelled as those three boys have been, but that you have still time and
  opportunity to amend, and to win again the character you once had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Turned out of his headship to give way to a fifth-form boy, turned down to
  the bottom of the monitors, poor Kenrick felt unspeakably degraded; but he
  was forced to endure a yet more bitter mortification. Before going to Dr Lane
  he had received a message that he was wanted in the sixth-form room, and,
  with a touch of his old pride, had answered, &ldquo;Tell them I won&rsquo;t
  come.&rdquo; Hardly had he reached his own study after leaving the Doctor,
  when Henderson entered with a grave face, and saying, &ldquo;I am sorry,
  Kenrick, to be the bearer of this,&rdquo; handed to him a folded sheet of
  paper. Opening it he found that, at the monitors&rsquo; meeting, to which he
  had been summoned, an unanimous vote of censure had been passed upon him in
  his absence, for the opposition which he had always displayed against his
  colleagues, and for the disgraceful part which he had taken in attempting to
  coerce them by force in the case of Penn. The document concluded, &ldquo;We
  are therefore obliged, though with great and real reluctance, to take the
  unusual step of recording in the monitors&rsquo; book this vote of censure
  against Kenrick, fourth monitor, for the bad example he has set and the great
  harm he has done, in at once betraying our interests and violating the first
  conditions on which he received his own authority: and we do this, not in a
  spirit of anger, but solely in the earnest and affectionate hope that this
  unanimous condemnation of his conduct by all his coadjutors may serve to
  recall him to a sense of his duty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Appended were the names of all the monitors&mdash;but, no; as he glanced
  over the names he saw that one was absent, the name of Walter Evson.
  Evidently, it was not because Walter <i>disapproved</i> of the measure, for,
  had this been the case, Kenrick knew that his name would have appeared at the
  end as a formal dissentient; no, the omission of his name was due, Kenrick
  saw, to that same high reserve, and delicate, courteous consideration which
  had marked the whole of Walter&rsquo;s behaviour to him since the day of
  their disastrous quarrel.</p>

  <p>Kenrick appreciated this delicacy, and his eyes were suffused with tears.
  Wilton, somewhat cowed by recent occurrences, was the only boy in his study
  at the time, and though Kenrick would have been glad to have some one near
  him, to whom he could talk of the disgraces which had fallen so heavily upon
  him, and to whom he could look for a little sympathy and counsel, yet to
  Wilton he felt no inclination to be at all communicative. There was, indeed,
  something about Wilton which he could not help liking, but there was and
  could be no sort of equality between them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ken,&rdquo; said Wilton, &ldquo;do you remember telling me the
  other day that I was shedding crocodile tears?&mdash;what are crocodile
  tears? I&rsquo;ve always been wanting to ask you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a phrase, Ra, for sham tears; and it was very rude
  of me, wasn&rsquo;t it? Herodotus says something about crocodiles; perhaps
  he&rsquo;ll explain it for us. I&rsquo;d look and see if I had my Herodotus
  here, but I lost it nearly three years ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>By one of those curious coincidences, which look strange in books, but
  which happen daily in common life, Tracy at this moment entered with the lost
  Herodotus in his hand, saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kenrick, I happened to be hunting out the classroom cupboard just
  now for a book I&rsquo;d mislaid, when I found a book with your name in
  it&mdash;an Herodotus; so I thought I&rsquo;d bring it you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Wilton, &ldquo;talk of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Herodotus, and he&rsquo;ll appear,&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;how
  very odd. It&rsquo;s mine, sure enough! I lost it, as I was just telling
  Wilton, I don&rsquo;t know how long ago. Now, Raven, I&rsquo;ll find you all
  he says about crocodiles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before you look, may I tell you something?&rdquo; asked Tracy.
  &ldquo;I wanted an opportunity to speak with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mind coming out into the court, then?&rdquo; said Tracy,
  glancing at Wilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind me,&rdquo; said Wilton; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be a minute,&rdquo; said Tracy, &ldquo;and then you
  can come back. What I wanted to say, Kenrick, was only this, and it was a
  great shame of me not to tell you before; but I see now that I&rsquo;ve been
  a poor tool in the hands of those fellows. Jones made you believe, you know,
  <i>that Evson had told him</i> all about your home affairs, and about the
  pony-chaise, and so on,&rdquo; said Tracy, hurrying over the obnoxious
  subject.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Kenrick impatiently. &ldquo;Well, he never
  did, you know. I&rsquo;ve heard Jones confess it often with his own
  lips.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can I believe him in one lie more than another, then? I believe
  the fellow couldn&rsquo;t open his lips without a lie flying out of them. How
  could Jones possibly have known about it any other way? There was only one
  fellow who could have told him, and that was Evson. Evson <i>must</i> have
  told me a lie when he said that he&rsquo;d mentioned it to no one but
  Power.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Evson ever told a lie in his life,&rdquo;
  said Tracy. &ldquo;However, I can explain your difficulty. Jones was in the
  same train as Evson; he saw you and him ride home; and, staying at Littleton,
  the next town to where you live, he heard all about you there. I&rsquo;ve
  heard him say so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The black-hearted brute!&rdquo; was all that Kenrick could
  ejaculate, as he paced up and down his study with agitated steps. &ldquo;O
  Tracy, what an utter, utter ass, and fool, and wretch, I&rsquo;ve
  been.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; said Tracy; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sorry now, and
  hope to improve. Better late than never. Good morning, Kenrick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Wilton returned to the study a quarter of an hour after, he found
  Kenrick&rsquo;s attention riveted by a note which he held in his hand, and
  which he seemed to be reading with his whole soul. So absorbed was he that he
  was not even disturbed by Wilton&rsquo;s entrance. Listlessly turning over
  the pages of his Herodotus to divert his painful thoughts by looking for the
  passage about the crocodiles, Kenrick had found an old note directed to
  himself. Painful thoughts, it seems, were to give him no respite that day;
  how well he knew that handwriting, altered a little now, more firm and
  mature, but even then a good, though a boyish hand. He tore it open; it was
  dated three years back, and signed Walter Evson. It was the long lost note in
  which Walter, once or twice rebuffed, had frankly and even earnestly asked
  pardon for any supposed fault, and begged for an immediate
  reconciliation&mdash;the very note of which Walter of course imagined that
  Kenrick had received, and from his not taking any notice of it, inferred,
  that all hope of renewing their friendship was finally at an end. Kenrick
  could not help thinking how very different a great part of his school-life
  would have been, had that note but come to hand!</p>

  <p>He saw it all now as clearly as possible&mdash;his haste, his rash and
  false inferences, his foolish jealousy, his impetuous pride, his quick
  degeneracy, all the mischief he had caused, all the folly he had done, all
  the time he had wasted. Disgraced, degraded, despised by the best fellows in
  the school, censured unanimously by his colleagues, given up by masters whom
  he respected, without a single true friend, grievously and hopelessly in the
  wrong from the very commencement, he now felt <i>bowed down and
  conquered</i>, and, to Wilton&rsquo;s amazement, he laid his head upon his
  arms on the table before him without saying a word, and broke into a heavy
  sob. If his conscience had not declared against him, he could have borne
  everything else; but when conscience is our enemy, there is no chance of a
  mind at ease. Kenrick sat there miserable and self-condemned; he had injured
  his friend, injured his fellows, and injured, most deeply of all, himself.
  For, as the poet sings&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;He that wrongs his friend,<br>
    Wrongs himself more; and ever bears about<br>
    A silent court of justice in his breast;<br>
    Himself the judge and jury, and himself<br>
    The prisoner at the bar, ever condemned.<br>
    And that drags down his life.&rdquo;<br></i>

  <h2>XXXVI. &mdash; IN THE DEPTHS</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>How easy to keep free from sin,<br>

    Forget the heavens from which they fall.</i><br>
    &mdash;Cov. Patmore.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">IT may be thought strange that Kenrick did not at once,
  while his heart was softened, and when he saw so clearly how much he had
  erred, go there and then to Walter, confess to him that everything was now
  explained, that he had never received his last note, and that, for his own
  sake, he desired to be restored, as far as was possible, to his former
  footing. If that had not been for Kenrick a period of depression and
  ill-repute, he would undoubtedly have done so; but he did not like to go, now
  that he was in disgrace, now that his friendship could do no credit, and, as
  he feared, confer no pleasure on any one, and under circumstances which would
  make it appear that he had changed his views under the influence of selfish
  interest, rather than of true conviction or generous impulse. He thought,
  too, that friendship over was like water spilt, and could not be gathered up
  again; that it was like a broken thread which cannot again be smoothly
  reunited. So things remained on the same footing as before, except that
  Kenrick&rsquo;s whole demeanour was changed for the better. He bore his
  punishment in a quiet and manly way; took his place without a murmur below
  Henderson at the bottom of the monitors; did not by any bravado attempt to
  conceal that he felt justly humiliated, and gave Whalley his best assistance
  in governing the Noelites, and bringing them back by slow but sure degrees to
  a better tone of thought and feeling. Towards Walter especially his whole
  manner altered. Hitherto he had made a point of always opposing him, and
  taking every opportunity to show him a strong dislike. If Walter had embraced
  one opinion at a monitors&rsquo; meeting, it was quite sufficient reason for
  Kenrick to support another; if Walter had spoken on one side at the debating
  society, Kenrick held it to be a logical consequence that, whatever he
  thought, he should speak on the other, and use his powers of speaking, which
  were considerable, to throw on Walter&rsquo;s illustrations and arguments all
  the ridicule he could. All this folly and virulence was now abandoned; the
  swagger which Kenrick had adopted was from that time entirely laid aside. At
  the very next meeting of the debating society he spoke, as indeed he
  generally thought, on the same side with Walter; and spoke, not in his usual
  flippant conceited style, but more seriously and earnestly, treating
  Walter&rsquo;s speech with approval and almost with deference. Every one
  noticed and rejoiced in this change of manner, and none more so than Walter
  Evson and Power.</p>

  <p>Kenrick finished with these words&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen, before I sit
  down I have a task to perform, which, however painful it may be to me, it is
  due to you that I should not neglect. I may do it now, because I see that
  none but the sixth-form are present, and because I may not have another early
  opportunity. I have incurred, as you are all well aware, a unanimous vote of
  censure from my colleagues&mdash;unanimous, although, through a delicacy
  which I am thankful to be still capable of keenly appreciating, the name of
  one...&rdquo; the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; sprang to his lips, but humility
  forbade him to adopt it, and he said... &ldquo;the name of one monitor is
  absent from the appended signatures. Gentlemen, I do not like public
  recantations or public professions, but I feel it my duty to acknowledge
  without palliation that I feel the censure to have been deserved.&rdquo; His
  voice faltered with emotion as he proceeded: &ldquo;I have been misled,
  gentlemen, and I have been labouring for a long time under a grievous
  mistake, which has led me to do much injustice and inflict many wrongs; for
  these errors I now ask the pardon of all, and especially of those who are
  most concerned. Your censure, gentlemen, concluded with a kind and friendly
  wish, and I cannot trust myself to say more now, than to echo that wish with
  all my heart, and to hope that ere long the efforts which I shall endeavour
  to make may succeed in persuading you to give me back your confidence and
  esteem, and to erase from the book the permanent record of your recent
  disapproval.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Every one present felt how great must have been the suffering which could
  wring such an expression of regret from a nature so proud as Kenrick&rsquo;s.
  They listened in silence, and when he sat down greeted him with an applause
  which showed how readily he might win their regard; while many of them came
  round him and shook hands with warmth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Power, rising, &ldquo;I am sure we all feel
  that the remarks we have just heard do honour to the speaker. I hold in my
  hand the monitors&rsquo; book, open at the page on which our censure was
  written. After what we have heard there can be no necessity why that page
  should remain where it is for a single day. I beg to move that leave may be
  given me to tear it out at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I am eager to second the motion,&rdquo; said Henderson,
  starting up at the same moment with several others; &ldquo;and,
  Kenrick&mdash;if I may break through, on such an occasion as this, our
  ordinary forms, and address you by name&mdash;I am sure you will believe that
  though I have very often opposed you, no one will be more glad than myself to
  welcome you back as a friend, and to hope that you may soon be, what you are
  so capable of being, not only our greatest support, but also one of the
  brightest ornaments of our body.&rdquo; He held out his hand, which Kenrick
  readily grasped, whispering, with a sigh, &ldquo;Ah, Flip, how I wish that we
  had never broken with each other!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The proposal was carried by acclamation, and Power accordingly tore out
  the sheet and put it in the fire. And that night brightened for Kenrick into
  the dawn of better days. Twenty times over Walter thought that Kenrick was
  going to speak to him&mdash;for his manner was quite different; but Kenrick,
  though every particle of ill-will had vanished from his mind, and had been
  replaced by his old unimpaired affection, put off the reconciliation until he
  should have been able in some measure to recover his old position, and to
  meet his friend on a footing of greater equality.</p>

  <p>Do not let any one think that his reformation was too easy. It took him
  long to conquer himself, and he found the task sorely difficult; but after
  many failures and relapses, the words of another who had sinned and suffered
  three thousand years ago, and who, after many a struggle, had discovered the
  true secret, came home to Kenrick and whispered to him the
  message&mdash;&ldquo;Then I said, <i>It is mine own infirmity: but I will
  remember the years of the right-hand of the Most Highest</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was not long before one great difficulty confronted him, the
  consequence of former misdeeds, and put him under circumstances which
  demanded the whole courage of his character, and thoroughly tested the
  sincerity of his repentance.</p>

  <p>After Mackworth&rsquo;s expulsion, and under Whalley&rsquo;s good
  government, the state of the Noelites greatly improved. Charlie Evson, for
  whom, now, by the by, Kenrick always did everything that lay in his power,
  became far more a model among the younger boys than Wilton had ever been, and
  there was a final end of suppers, smoking parties, organised cribbing, and
  recognised &ldquo;crams.&rdquo; But just as the house was recovering lost
  ground, and had ceased to be quite a byeword in the school, it was thrown
  into consternation by a long-continued series of petty thefts.</p>

  <p>Small sums were extracted from the boys&rsquo; jacket pockets after they
  had gone to bed; from the play-boxes which were not provided with good locks
  and keys; from the private desks in the classrooms, from the dormitories, and
  from several of the studies. There was no clue to the offender, and first of
  all suspicion fell strongly on the new boy, little Elgood. A few trifling
  items of circumstantial evidence seemed to point him out, and it began to be
  gradually whispered, no one exactly knew how or by whom, that he must be the
  guilty boy. Hints were thrown out to him to this effect; little bits of
  paper, on which were written the words &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal,&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;The devil will have thieves,&rdquo; were dropped about in his books
  and wherever he was likely to find them, and whenever the subject was brought
  on the tapis his manner was closely watched. The effect was unsatisfactory;
  for Elgood was a timid nervous boy, and the uneasiness to which this
  nervousness gave rise was set down as a sign of guilt. At length a sovereign
  and a half were stolen out of Whalley&rsquo;s study, and as Elgood, being
  Whalley&rsquo;s fag, had constant access to the study, and might very well
  have known that Whalley had the money, and in what place he kept it, the
  prevalent suspicions were confirmed. The boys, with their usual thoughtless
  haste, leapt to the conclusion that he must have been the thief.</p>

  <p>The house was in a perfect ferment. However lightly one or two of them,
  like Penn, may have thought about taking trifles from small tradesmen, there
  was not a single one among them, not even Penn himself, whose morality did
  not brand this thieving from schoolfellows as wicked and mean. The boys felt,
  too, that it was a stigma on their house, and unhappily Just at the time when
  the majority were really anxious to raise their corporate reputation. Every
  one was filled with annoyance and disgust, and felt an anxious determination
  to discover and give up the thief.</p>

  <p>At last the suspicions against Elgood proceeded so far, that out of mere
  justice to him the heads of the house, Whalley, Kenrick, and Bliss, thought
  it right that he should be questioned. So, after tea, all the house assembled
  in the classroom, and Elgood was formally charged with the delinquency, and
  questioned about it, Wilton, in particular, urging him in almost a bullying
  tone to surrender and confess. The poor child was overwhelmed with
  terror&mdash;cried, blushed, answered incoherently, and lost his head, but
  would not for a moment confess that he had done it, and protested his
  innocence with many sobs and tears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose if he persists in denying it, we can&rsquo;t go any
  further,&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid, Elgood, that you
  must have had something to do with it, as every one seems to see ground for
  suspecting you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I hadn&rsquo;t, I hadn&rsquo;t; indeed I hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
  wailed Elgood; &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t say so, Kenrick; indeed
  I&rsquo;m innocent, and I&rsquo;d rather write home for the money ten times
  over than be suspected.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So would any one, you little fool,&rdquo; said Wilton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bully him in that way, Wilton,&rdquo; said Whalley;
  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not the way to get the truth out of him. Elgood, I should
  have thought you innocent, if you didn&rsquo;t behave so oddly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I speak?&rdquo; modestly asked a new voice. The speaker was
  Charlie Evson.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; said Kenrick, in an encouraging tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well then, please, Kenrick, and the whole of you, I think you
  <i>have</i> had the truth out of him; and I think he <i>is</i>
  innocent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Charlie?&rdquo; said Whalley; &ldquo;what makes you think
  so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve asked him, and talked to him privately about
  it,&rdquo; said Charlie; &ldquo;when you frighten him he gets confused, and
  contradicts himself, but he can explain whatever looks suspicious if you ask
  him kindly and Quietly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; said Wilton; &ldquo;who frightened him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence, Wilton,&rdquo; said Whalley. &ldquo;Well, Charlie, will
  you question him now for us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; said Charlie, advancing and putting his hand
  kindly round Elgood&rsquo;s shoulder, as he seated himself on the desk by
  which Elgood was standing. &ldquo;Will you tell us, as I ask you, all you
  told me this morning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Elgood eagerly, while his whole manner changed
  from nervous tremor to perfect simplicity and quiet new that he had a friend
  to stand by him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, now, about the money you&rsquo;ve been spending
  lately?&rdquo; questioned Charlie, with a smile. &ldquo;You usen&rsquo;t to
  be so flush of cash, you know, a month ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can tell you,&rdquo; answered Elgood; &ldquo;I had a very large
  present&mdash;large for me, I mean&mdash;three weeks ago. My father sent me a
  pound, because it was my birthday, and my big brother and aunt sent me each a
  pound too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can answer for that being perfectly true,&rdquo; said Charlie,
  &ldquo;for I went with my brother to the post-office this afternoon and
  asked, and found that Elgood had had three money-orders changed there. And
  now, Elgood, can you trust me with your purse?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I can, Charlie,&rdquo; said Elgood, readily producing it,
  and almost forgetting that the others were present.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, now you see <i>I&rsquo;m</i> going to rifle it. Ah! what
  have we here? why, here&rsquo;s a whole sovereign, and eight shillings; that
  looks suspicious, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Charlie archly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Elgood, laughing; &ldquo;you went with me yourself
  when I bought my desk for eighteen shillings, and the rest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;Look, you fellows: Elgood
  and I put down this morning the other things he&rsquo;s bought, and they come
  to fourteen shillings. I know they&rsquo;re right, for I didn&rsquo;t like
  Elgood to be wrongly suspected, so Walter want with me to the shops; indeed
  it was chiefly spent at Coles&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;at which remark they all
  laughed, for Coles&rsquo;s was the favourite &ldquo;tuck shop&rdquo; of the
  boys. &ldquo;Well, now, 1 pound, 8 shillings plus 18 shillings plus 14
  shillings makes 3 pounds, the sum which Elgood received from home. Is that
  plain?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As plain as a pike-staff,&rdquo; said Bliss; &ldquo;and
  you&rsquo;re a little brick, Evson; and it&rsquo;s a chouse if any one
  suspects Elgood any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Wilton suggested something about Elgood being Whalley&rsquo;s fag.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shame, Raven,&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;why, what a suspicious
  fellow you must be; there&rsquo;s no ground whatever to suspect Elgood
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I only want the fellow found out for the honour of the
  house,&rdquo; said Wilton, with a sheepish look at this third rebuff.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot about that for the moment,&rdquo; said Charlie;
  &ldquo;Whalley, please, you know the time, don&rsquo;t you, when the money
  was taken from your desk?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; it must have been between four and six, for I saw it safe at
  four, and it was gone when I came back after tea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then all right,&rdquo; said Charlie joyfully, &ldquo;for at that
  very time, all of it, Elgood was in my brother&rsquo;s study with me,
  learning some lessons. Now then, is Elgood clear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As clear as noonday,&rdquo; shouted several of them, patting the
  poor child on the head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And really, Charlie, we&rsquo;re all very much obliged to
  you,&rdquo; said Whalley, &ldquo;for setting this matter straight. But now,
  as it <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> Elgood, who <i>is</i> the thief? We must all set
  ourselves to discover.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And we <i>shall</i> discover,&rdquo; said Bliss; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
  probably here now. Who is it?&rdquo; he asked, glancing round. &ldquo;Well,
  whoever it is, I don&rsquo;t envy him his sensations at this
  minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The meeting broke up, and Kenrick accompanied Whalley to his study to
  concert further measures.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you any suspicion at all about it, Whalley?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not the least. Have you? No. Well, then, what shall we
  do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why the thief isn&rsquo;t likely to visit <i>your</i> study again,
  Whalley; very likely he&rsquo;ll come to mine. Suppose we put a little marked
  money in the secret drawer. It&rsquo;s rather a joke to call it the
  <i>secret</i> drawer, for there&rsquo;s no secret about it; anyhow,
  it&rsquo;s an open secret.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very good; and then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, you know the money generally goes at one particular time on
  half-holidays. I&rsquo;m afraid the rogue, whoever he is, has got a taste for
  it by this time, and will come to money like a fly to a jam-pot. Now, outside
  my room, a few yards off, is the shoe-cupboard; what if you and I, and a few
  others, agree to shut ourselves up there in turns, now and then, on half-
  holidays between roll-call and tea-time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Whalley; &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s horribly
  unpleasant, but I&rsquo;ll take my turn first. Isn&rsquo;t the door usually
  locked, though?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but so much the better; we can easily get it left open, and
  the thief won&rsquo;t suspect an ambuscade. He <i>must</i> be found out, for
  the sake of all the boys who are innocent and to wipe out the blot against
  the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll ensconce myself there to-morrow. I say, Ken,
  isn&rsquo;t young Evson a capital fellow? how well he managed to clear
  Elgood, didn&rsquo;t he? I declare he taught us all a lesson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s his brother all over;
  just what Walter was when he came.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, <i>you</i> say that?&rdquo; said Whalley, smiling and arching
  his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; said Kenrick, with some sadness; &ldquo;I
  haven&rsquo;t always thought so, the more&rsquo;s the pity;&rdquo; and he
  left the room with a sigh.</p>

  <p>After his turn for incarceration in the shoe-cupboard, Bliss complained
  loudly that it wasn&rsquo;t large enough to accommodate him, and that it
  cramped his long arms and legs, to say nothing of the unpleasant vicinity of
  spiders and earwigs. But the others, laughing at him, told him that, if the
  experiment was to be of any use whatever, they must persevere in it, and
  Bliss allowed himself to be made a victim. For a time nothing happened, but
  they had not to wait very long.</p>

  <p>One day, Kenrick had been mounting guard for about half an hour, and was
  getting very tired, when a light and hasty step passed along the passage, and
  into his room. The boy found the study empty, and proceeded noiselessly to
  open Kenrick&rsquo;s desk, and examine the contents. At length he pulled open
  the secret drawer; it opened with a little click, and <i>there</i> lay before
  him two half-sovereigns and some silver. He was a wary fellow, for he
  scrutinised these all over most carefully to see if they were marked, and
  finding no mark of any kind on them&mdash;for it almost required a microscope
  to see the tiny scratch between the w.w. on the smooth edge of the
  neck&mdash;he took out his purse, and was proceeding to drop them into it,
  when <i>a heavy hand was laid upon his shoulder</i>, and Kenrick and
  Wilton&mdash;the detected thief&mdash;stood face to face. The purse dropped
  on the floor.</p>

  <p>For a moment they stood silent, staring at each other, and drawing quick
  breaths. Wilton stood there pale as death, and looked up at Kenrick
  trembling, and with a frightened stare. It was too awful to be so suddenly
  surprised; to have had an unknown eye-witness standing by him all the while
  that, fancying himself unseen, he was in the very act of committing that
  secret deed of sin; to be arrested, detected, exposed, as the boy whose
  hidden misdoings had been, for so long, a source of discomfort, anxiety, and
  shame.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>, Wilton&mdash;<i>you, you, you</i>, the disturber of the
  house, <i>you</i>, who have so long been treated by me as a friend, and
  allowed at all times to use my study; <i>you</i>, the foremost to throw the
  suspicion on others!&rdquo; He stopped, breathless, for his indignation was
  rushing in too deep and strong a torrent to find vent in words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Kenrick, don&rsquo;t tell of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <i>tell</i> of you! Good heavens! is that all you can
  find to say? Not one word of sorrow&mdash;not one word of shame. Abandoned,
  heartless, graceless fellow!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was driven to it, Kenrick, indeed I was. I owed money to Dan, and
  to&mdash;to other places, and they threatened to tell of me if I didn&rsquo;t
  pay. Then Harpour and those fellows quite cleared me out at cards; I believe
  they did it by cheating. O, don&rsquo;t tell of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cannot screen a thief,&rdquo; was the freezing reply; and the
  change from flame to ice showed into what commotion his feelings had been
  thrown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, if it comes to that,&rdquo; said Wilton, turning
  sullen, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> tell of <i>you</i>. It&rsquo;ll all come
  out; remember it was you who first took me to Dan&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s
  not the only thing I could tell of you. O Kenrick, don&rsquo;t tell, or it
  will get us all into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This, then, is the creature whom I have suffered to call me
  friend!&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;for whom I have given up some of the best
  friends in the school! And this is your gratitude! Why, you worm, Wilton,
  what do you take me for? Do you think that fear of <i>your</i> disclosures
  will make me hush up twenty thefts? You enlist the whole strength of my
  conscience against you, lest I should seem to screen you for my own sake.
  Faugh! your very touch sickens me!&mdash;go!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Kenrick, don&rsquo;t be so angry; I didn&rsquo;t mean to say it;
  I didn&rsquo;t know what I was saying; I am driven into a corner by shame and
  misery. I know I have been a mean dog; but even if you tell of me,
  don&rsquo;t crush me so with your anger, for indeed, indeed, I <i>have</i>
  been grateful, and have loved you, Kenrick. But oh, don&rsquo;t tell, I
  implore, I entreat you, Ken. How little I thought that I should have to speak
  to you like this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Kenrick could only say&mdash;&ldquo;<i>You</i> the thief; <i>you</i>,
  the <i>last</i> fellow of all I should have suspected; <i>you</i> whom I have
  called friend, O heavens! Yes, I know that I&rsquo;ve done you harm by bad
  example, I know that I&rsquo;ve much to answer for but at any rate I never
  taught you to be a thief.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But one thing comes of another, Ken; it all came of my being so
  much with those brutes, and going to Dan&rsquo;s; it all came of that. I
  shouldn&rsquo;t have thought myself that I could do it or do half the bad
  things I <i>have</i> done, two months ago. It all came of that; and you used
  to go with those fellows, Ken, and you went with me to Dan&rsquo;s;&rdquo;
  and the boy wrung his hands, and wept, and flung himself on his knees.
  &ldquo;I must tell all, if you tell of <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say that again,&rdquo; said Kenrick, spurning him scornfully away,
  &ldquo;say it once again, and I go straight to Dr Lane. Poor worm, you
  don&rsquo;t understand me, you don&rsquo;t seem to have the capability of a
  high thought in you. I tell you that nothing you can say of me shall shake my
  purpose. I am going now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But before he could get his straw hat Wilton had clasped him by the knees,
  and in a voice of agony was beseeching him to relent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all true, Kenrick; I am base, I know it; I have quenched
  all honour in me. I won&rsquo;t say that again, but do, for God&rsquo;s sake,
  forgive me this once, and not tell of me. O Kenrick, have <i>you</i> never
  had to say forgive? Do, do, pity me, as you hope to be forgiven; don&rsquo;t
  ruin me, and give me a bad name; I am so young, so young, and have fallen
  into bad hands from the first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He still knelt on the floor, exhausted with the violence of his passion,
  hanging his head upon his breast, sobbing as if his heart would break. It was
  sad to see him, a mere child still, who might have been so different, long a
  little reprobate, and now a convicted thief. His face bathed in tears, his
  voice choked with sobs, the memory of the past, consciousness that much which
  he said was only too true, touched Kenrick with compassion; the tears rolled
  down his own face fast, and he felt that, though personal fear could not
  influence him, pity would perhaps force him to relent, and wring from him in
  his weakness a reluctant promise not to disclose Wilton&rsquo;s discovered
  guilt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What can I say to you, Wilton? you know that I have liked you, but
  I never thought that you could act like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor I, Kenrick, a short time ago; but the devil tempted me, and I
  have never learned to resist.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From my very heart I <i>do</i> pity you; but I fear I <i>must</i>
  tell; I fear it&rsquo;s my duty, and I have neglected so many that I dare
  neglect no more; though indeed, I&rsquo;d rather have had any duty but
  this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Wilton was again clasping his knees and harrowing his soul by his wild
  anguish, imploring to be saved from the horror of open shame, and, accustomed
  as Kenrick was to grant anything to this boy, he was reduced to great
  distress. Already his whole manner had relented from the loathing and anger
  he first displayed. He could stand no more at present.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Wilton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will make me ill if you go on
  like this. I cannot, must not, will not make you any promise now; but I will
  think what to do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said Wilton, deeply abashed; &ldquo;but before I
  go, promise me one thing, Ken, and that is, even if you tell of me,
  don&rsquo;t quite cast me off. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to leave and think that
  I hadn&rsquo;t left <i>one</i> behind me to give me a kind thought
  sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Ra, Ra, to think that it was <i>you</i> all the while who were
  committing all these thefts!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You <i>will</i> cast me off then?&rdquo; said Wilton, in a voice
  broken by penitence; &ldquo;O! what a bitter bitter thing it is to feel shame
  like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have felt it too in my time, Raven. Poor, poor fellow! who am I
  that I should cast you off? No, you unhappy child, I may tell of you, but I
  will not cease to be fond of you. Go, Wilton; I will decide between this and
  tea-time&mdash;you may come and hear about it after tea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was already outside the door when Kenrick called out &ldquo;Wilton,
  stop!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Wilton, returning alarmed, for conscience
  had made him a coward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Kenrick only pointed to the purse lying on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t ask me to touch it again, the money is in
  it,&rdquo; said Wilton, hastily leaving the room. There was no acting here;
  it was plain that he was penitent&mdash;plain that he would have given worlds
  not to have been guilty of the sin.</p>

  <p>Very sadly, and with pain and doubt, Kenrick thought the matter over, and
  thus much at least was clear to him: first, that the house must be informed,
  though not necessarily the masters or the other boys; secondly, that Wilton
  must make full and immediate restitution to all from whom he had stolen;
  thirdly, there could be no doubt about it, that Wilton must get himself
  removed at once. On these conditions he thought it possible that the matter
  might be hushed up; but his conscience was uneasy on this point. That unlucky
  threat or hint of Wilton&rsquo;s, that he could and would tell some of his
  wrong-doings, was his great stumbling-block; whenever extreme pity influenced
  him to screen the poor boy from full exposure, he began to ask himself
  whether this was a mere cowardly alternative suggested by his own fears. But
  for this, he would have determined at once on the more lenient and merciful
  course; but he had to face this question of self-interest very earnestly, nor
  could he come to any conclusion about it until he had determined to take a
  step in all respects worthy of the highest side of his character, by going,
  in any case, spontaneously to Dr Lane and laying before him a frank
  confession of past delinquencies, leaving him to act as he thought fit.</p>

  <p>Having thus disentangled the question from all its personal bearings he
  was able to review it on its merits, and went to ask the counsel of Whalley,
  to whom he related, in confidence, the whole scene exactly as it had
  occurred. Whalley, too, on hearing the alternative conditions which Kenrick
  had planned, was fully inclined to spare Wilton as much as possible, but, as
  neither of them felt satisfied to do this on their own authority, they sought
  Power&rsquo;s advice and, as he too felt very doubtful on the matter, he
  suggested that they should put it to Dr Lane, without mentioning any names,
  <i>as a hypothetical case</i>, and be finally guided by his directions.</p>

  <p>Accordingly Kenrick sought Dr Lane&rsquo;s study, and laid the entire
  difficulty before him. He listened attentively, and said, &ldquo;If the boy
  is so young, and has been, as you say, misled, and accepts the very sensible
  conditions which you have proposed, I am inclined to think that the course
  you have suggested will be the wisest and the kindest one. You have my full
  authority, Kenrick, to arrange it so, and I am happy to tell you that you
  have behaved throughout this matter in an honourable and straightforward
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fear, sir, I very little deserve your approval,&rdquo; said
  Kenrick, with downcast eyes. &ldquo;In coming to ask your advice in this
  case, I wanted also to say that I have gone so far wrong that I think you
  ought to be told how badly I have behaved. It may be that after what I say,
  you may not think right to allow me to stay here, sir; but at any rate I
  shall have disburdened my own conscience by telling you, and shall perhaps
  feel less wretched.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Kenrick,&rdquo; said Dr Lane, &ldquo;it was a right and a
  brave thing of you to come here for this purpose. Confession is often the
  first, as it is one of the most trying parts of repentance; and I hail this
  as a new proof of your strong and steady desire to amend. But tell me
  nothing, my dear boy. It may be that I know more than you suppose; at any
  rate, I accept the will for the deed, and wish to hear no more, unless,
  indeed, you desire to consult me as a clergyman, and as your spiritual
  adviser, rather than as your master. I do not seek this confidence; only if
  there is anything on your conscience of which my advice may help to relieve
  you, I do not <i>forbid</i> you to proceed, and I will give you what help I
  can.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think it would relieve me, sir,&rdquo; said Kenrick; &ldquo;I
  have no father; I have, I am sorry to say, no friend in the school to whom I
  could speak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then sit down, Kenrick, and be assured beforehand of my real
  sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sat down, and, twitching nervously at the ribbon of his straw hat, told
  Dr Lane much of the history of the last two years, confessing, above all, how
  badly he had behaved as head of the house, and how much harm he feared his
  example had done.</p>

  <p>Dr Lane did not attempt to extenuate the heinousness of his offence, but
  he pointed out to him what were the fruits and the means of repentance. He
  exhorted him to let the sense of his past errors stimulate him to double
  future exertions. He told him of many ways in which, by kindness, by moral
  courage, by Christian principle, he might be a help and a blessing to other
  boys. He earnestly warned him to look to God for strength, and to watch and
  pray lest he should enter into temptation. And then promising him a full and
  free oblivion of the past, he knelt down with him and offered up from an
  overflowing heart a few words of earnest prayer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing like prayer to relieve the heart, Kenrick,&rdquo;
  said Dr Lane; &ldquo;and now, good-night, and God bless you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a far lighter heart, with far brighter hopes, Kenrick left him,
  feeling as if a great burden had been rolled away, and inwardly blessing the
  doctor for his comforting kindness. He found Wilton anxiously awaiting his
  arrival in his study; and thinking that their cases in some respects
  resembled each other, he strove not to be like the unforgiving debtor of the
  parable, and spoke to Wilton with great gentleness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come here, my poor child; first of all, let me tell you that you
  shall not be reported.&rdquo; Wilton repaid him by a look of grateful
  joy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you must restore all the stolen money, Wilton; the house must
  be told privately; and you must leave at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Kenrick, I ask only one favour,&rdquo; said Wilton, after a
  short pause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That the house may not be told who stole the money until it is
  nearly time for me to go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; it shall be kept close till then, otherwise the next fortnight
  would be too hard for you to bear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But <i>must</i> I leave?&rdquo; asked Wilton, appealingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It must be so, Wilton; <i>I</i> shall be sorry for you, but it must
  be settled so. Can you manage it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said Wilton, crying quietly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write
  home and tell my poor mother all about it, and then of course she&rsquo;ll
  send me some money and take me away at once, to save me from being expelled.
  My poor mother, how wretched it will make her!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sin makes us all wretched, Raven boy. I&rsquo;m sure it makes me
  wretched enough. And that you mayn&rsquo;t think that fear has had anything
  to do with our letting you off, I must tell you, Wilton, that I&rsquo;ve been
  to Dr Lane himself and told him all the many sins I&rsquo;ve been guilty
  of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you? Oh! I&rsquo;m so sorry; it was all through me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but I&rsquo;m not sorry; I&rsquo;m all the happier for it,
  Raven. There&rsquo;s nothing so miserable as undiscovered sin&mdash;is
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, there isn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m sure I feel happier now in
  spite of all. No one knows, Ken, how I&rsquo;ve suffered this last fortnight.
  I&rsquo;ve been in a perpetual fright; I&rsquo;ve had fearful dreams;
  I&rsquo;ve felt ready to sink for shame; and I&rsquo;ve always been fancying
  that fellows suspected me. Do you know, I am almost glad you caught me, Ken.
  I&rsquo;m <i>very</i> glad it was you and no one else, though it was a
  <i>horrid, horrid</i> moment when you laid your hand on my shoulder. Yet even
  this isn&rsquo;t so bad as to have gone on nursing the guilt secretly, and
  not to have been detected.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick was musing; the boy who could talk like that was clearly one who
  <i>might</i> have beer, very unlike what Wilton then was.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wilton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come here and draw your chair by
  mine while I read you a little story.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Ken, I&rsquo;m so grateful that you don&rsquo;t hate and despise
  me though I am a&mdash;&rdquo;; he murmured the word &ldquo;thief&rdquo; with
  a shudder, and under his breath, as he drew up his chair, and Kenrick read to
  him in a low voice the story of Achan, till he came to the verses&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of
  the tribe of Judah, was taken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Joshua said, <i>My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord
  God of Israel, and make confession unto him</i>; and tell me now what thou
  hast done, hide it not from me.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Achan answered Joshua and said, Indeed I have sinned against
  the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And there Kenrick stopped, while Wilton said, &ldquo;My son! You see
  Joshua still called him &lsquo;my son&rsquo; in spite of all his sin and
  mischief.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Raven boy, but that wasn&rsquo;t why I read you the story
  which has often struck me. What I wanted you to see was this: The man was
  detected&mdash;the thing had been coming, creeping horribly near to him;
  first his tribe marked by the fatal lot, then his family, then his house,
  then himself; and while he&rsquo;s standing there, guilty and detected, in
  the very midst of that crowd who had been defeated because of his baseness,
  and when all their eyes were scowling on him, and when he knows that he, and
  his sons, and his daughters, are going to be burned and stoned&mdash;at this
  very moment Joshua says to him, &lsquo;My son, <i>give, I pray thee, glory to
  the God of Israel</i>.&rsquo; You see he&rsquo;s to <i>thank God</i> for
  detecting him&mdash;thank God even at that frightful moment, and with that
  frightful death before him as a consequence. One would have thought that it
  wasn&rsquo;t a matter for much gratitude or jubilation; but you see it
  <i>was</i>, and so both Joshua and Achan seem to have admitted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Kenrick!&rdquo; said Wilton, sadly, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d
  always talked to me like that, I shouldn&rsquo;t be like Achan
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick said nothing, but as he had received infinite comfort from Dr
  Lane&rsquo;s treatment of himself, he took Wilton by the hand, and, without
  saying a word, knelt down. Wilton knelt down beside him, and he prayed for
  forgiveness for them both. A few broken, confused, uncertain words only, but
  they were earnest, and they came fresh and burning from the heart. They were
  words of true prayer, and the poor, erring, hardened little boy rose from his
  knees too overcome to speak.</p>

  <h2>XXXVII. &mdash; THE RECONCILIATION AND THE LOSS</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>The few remain, the many change and pass,<br>
    Heaven&rsquo;s light alone remains, earth&rsquo;s shadows flee;<br>
    Life, like a dome of many coloured glass,<br>

    Until death shiver it to atoms.</i><br>

  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">THE termination of Wilton&rsquo;s sojourn at Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s soon arrived. As yet none but the two head boys in the house
  knew of his detection. The thefts indeed had ceased; but the name of the
  offender was still a matter of constant surmise, and it was no easy task for
  Wilton&mdash;conscious how soon they would be informed&mdash;to listen to the
  strong terms of disgust which were applied to the yet unknown delinquent. The
  barriers of his conceit, his coolness, his audacity, were all broken down; he
  was a changed boy; his manner was grave and silent, and he almost hid himself
  during those days in Kenrick&rsquo;s study, where Kenrick, with true
  kindness, still permitted him to sit.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile it became generally known that he was going to leave almost
  immediately; and as boys often left in this way at the division of the
  quarter, his departure, though rather sudden, created no astonishment, nor
  had any one as yet the most distant conjecture as to the reasons which led to
  it. It is not too much to say, that Wilton was one of the last boys whom the
  rest would have suspected; they knew indeed that he never professed to be
  guided by any strong moral principles; but they thought him an unlikely
  fellow to be guilty of acts which sinned so completely against the
  schoolboy&rsquo;s artificial code, and which branded him who committed them
  with the charge of acknowledged meanness.</p>

  <p>On the very evening of his departure, the house was again summoned by a
  notice from Whalley and Kenrick to meet in the classroom after Preparation.
  They came, not knowing for what they were summoned. Whalley opened the
  proceedings by requesting that any boy who had of late had money stolen from
  him would stand up. Four or five of them rose, and on stating the sums,
  mostly small, which they had lost, immediately received the amount from
  Whalley, much to their surprise, and no less to their content.</p>

  <p>The duty which still remained was far less pleasing and more delicate, and
  it was by Wilton&rsquo;s express and earnest request that it was undertaken
  by Kenrick and not by Whalley. It was a painful moment for both of them when
  Kenrick rose, and very briefly, with all the forbearance and gentleness he
  could command, informed the house that there was every reason to hope that,
  from that time forward, these thefts which had caused them all so much
  distress, would cease. The offender had been discovered, and he begged them
  all, having confidence that they would grant the request, not to deal harshly
  with him, or think harshly of him. The guilty boy had done all that could be
  done by making full and immediate restitution, so that none of them now need
  remember any injury received at his hands, except Elgood, on whom suspicion
  had been unjustly thrown, and whose forgiveness the boy earnestly begged.</p>

  <p>At this part of his remarks there arose in the deep silence a general
  murmur of &ldquo;Who is it? who is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Wilton, trembling all over with agitation and excitement? was seated
  beside Kenrick, and had almost cowered behind him for very shame, but now
  Kenrick stood aside, and laying his hand on Wilton&rsquo;s head, continued,
  &ldquo;He is one of ourselves, and he is sitting here,&rdquo; while Wilton
  covered his face with both hands, and did not stir.</p>

  <p>An expression of surprise and emotion thrilled over all the boys present;
  not a word was spoken; and immediately after Kenrick said to them, &ldquo;He
  is punished enough; you can understand that this is a terrible thing for him.
  He has made reparation as far as he can, and besides this, he is <i>on this
  account</i> going to leave us to-day. I may tell you all, too, that he is
  very, very, very sorry for what he has done, and has learned a lesson that he
  will carry with him to his grave. May I assure him that we all forgive him
  freely? May I tell him that we are grieved to part with him, and most of all
  grieved for this which has caused it? May I tell him that, in spite of all,
  he carries with him our warmest wishes and best hopes, and that he leaves no
  enemy behind him here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; was murmured on all sides, and while the sound of
  Wilton&rsquo;s crying sounded through the room, many of the others were also
  in tears. For this boy was popular; bad as he had been&mdash;and the name of
  his sins was legion&mdash;there was something about him which had endeared
  him to most of them. Barring this last fault, they were generally proud of
  him; there had been a certain generosity about him, a gay thoughtlessness, a
  boyish daring, which won their admiration. He was a promising cricketer,
  active, merry, full of spirits: before he had been so spoiled by the notice
  of bigger fellows, there was no one who did not like him and expect that he
  would turn out well.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then my unpleasant task is over,&rdquo; said Kenrick, &ldquo;and I
  have no more to say. Oh, yes; I had forgotten, there was one very important
  thing I had to say, as Whalley reminds me. It is this: You know that the
  Noelites have kept other secrets before now, not always good secrets, I am
  sorry to say. But will you all now keep this an honourable secret? Will you
  not mention (for there is no occasion for it) to any others in the school,
  who it was that took the money? The matter will very soon be forgotten; do
  not let Wilton&rsquo;s sin be bruited through the whole school, so as to give
  him a bad name for life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed we won&rsquo;t, not one of us will tell,&rdquo; said the
  boys, and they kept the promise admirably afterwards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then we may all separate. You may bid Wilton good-bye now if you
  wish to do so, for he starts to-night, almost at once; the carriage is
  waiting for him now, and you will have no opportunity of seeing him
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They flocked round him and said &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; without one word of
  reproach, or one word calculated to wound his feelings; many of them added
  some sincere expressions of their good wishes for the future. As for Wilton
  himself, he was far too much moved to <i>say</i> much to them, but he pressed
  their hands in silence, only speaking to beg Elgood to pardon his unkindness,
  which the little fellow begged him not to think of at all.</p>

  <p>Charlie Evson lingered among the last, and spoke to him with frank and
  genial warmth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How you must hate me, Charlie, for annoying you so, and trying to
  lead you wrong!&rdquo; said Wilton, penitently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t, Wilton,&rdquo; said Charlie; &ldquo;I wish
  you weren&rsquo;t going to leave. I&rsquo;m sure we should all get on better
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me as bad as I have seemed, Charlie. I was
  ashamed at heart all the time I was trying to persuade you to crib and tell
  lies, and do like other fellows. I felt all the while that you were better
  than me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, Wilton. Perhaps we shall meet again some day, and
  be good friends; and I wish you happiness with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Charlie was the last of them, and Kenrick and Wilton were left alone. For
  Wilton&rsquo;s sake Kenrick tried to show all the cheerfulness he could, as
  he went with him through the now silent and deserted court to the gate where
  the carriage was waiting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you got all your luggage, and everything all right,
  Raven?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, everything,&rdquo; he said, taking one last long look at the
  familiar scene. It was dim moonlight; the lights twinkled in the studies
  where the upper boys were working, and in the dormitories where the rest were
  now going to bed. The tall trees round the building stood quite black against
  the faintly-lighted sky, waving their thinned remnant of yellow leaves in the
  November air. In the stillness you heard every slight sound; and the murmur
  of boys&rsquo; voices came mingled with the plashing of the mountain stream,
  and the moaning of the low waves as they broke upon the shore. A merry laugh
  rang from one of the dormitories, jarring painfully on Wilton&rsquo;s
  feelings, as he stood gazing round in silence.</p>

  <p>He got into the carriage, sighing heavily and grasping Kenrick&rsquo;s
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye, Ken; it <i>must</i> be said at last. May I write to
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish you would. I shall be so glad to hear of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you will answer me, Ken?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I will, my poor child. Good-bye. God bless you!&rdquo;
  They still lingered for a moment, and Kenrick saw in the moonlight that
  Wilton&rsquo;s face was bathed in tears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, sir?&rdquo; said the driver.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Wilton; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s all wrong, Ken, I
  think. Good-bye.&rdquo; He waved his hand, the carriage drove off into the
  darkening night with the little boy alone, and Kenrick with a sinking heart
  strolled back to his study. Do not pry into his feelings, for they were very
  terrible ones, as he sat down to his books with the strong conviction that
  there is nothing so good as the steady: fulfilment of duty for the driving
  away of heavy thoughts.</p>

  <p>All his time was taken up with working for the scholarship. It was a
  scholarship of ninety pounds a year for four years, founded by a princely
  benefactor of the school, but only falling vacant biennially. There were
  other scholarships besides this, but this was by far the most valuable one at
  Saint Winifred&rsquo;s; the tenure of it was circumscribed by no conditions,
  and it was therefore proportionably desirable that Kenrick, who was poor,
  should obtain it. He had, indeed, hardly a chance, as he well knew; for even
  if he succeeded in beating Walter, he could not expect to beat Power. But
  Power, though a most graceful and finished scholar, was not strong in
  mathematics, and as they counted something in the examination,
  Kenrick&rsquo;s chief chance lay in this, for as a scholar he was by no means
  to be despised; and with a just reliance on his own abilities, he hoped, if
  fortunate, to make up for being defeated in classics, by being considerably
  ahead in the other branches of the examination. How he longed now to have at
  his command the time he had so largely wasted! Had he but used that aright he
  might have easily disputed the palm in any competition with Power himself.
  Few boys had been gifted with stronger intellects or clearer heads than he.
  But though <i>fresh</i> time may be carefully and wisely used, the
  <i>past</i> time that has once been wasted can never be recovered or
  redeemed.</p>

  <p>And as he worked hard day by day the time quickly flew by, the scholarship
  examination took place, and the Christmas holidays came on. The result of the
  competition could not be known until the boys returned to school.</p>

  <p>Mrs Kenrick thought that this Christmas was the happiest she had known.
  They spent it, of course, very quietly. There were for them none of those
  happy family gatherings and innocent gaieties that made the time so bright
  for others, yet still there was something peaceful and something brighter
  than usual about them. Harry&rsquo;s manner, she thought, was more
  affectionate, more tenderly respectful, than it often was. There seemed to be
  something softer and more lovable about his ways. He bore himself with less
  haughty indifference towards the Fuzbeians; he entered with more zest into
  such simple amusements as he could invent or procure; he condescended to play
  quite simply with the curate&rsquo;s little boys, and seemed to be more
  humble and more contented. She counted the days he spent with her as a miser
  counts his gold; and he, when he left her, seemed more sorry to leave, and
  tried to cheer her spirits, and did not make so light, as his wont had been,
  of the grief which the separation caused.</p>

  <p>The first event of importance on the return of the boys to school, was the
  announcement of the scholarship. The list was read from the last name
  upwards; Henderson stood sixth, Kenrick third, Evson second, <i>Power
  first</i>. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Dr Lane, &ldquo;Power has communicated to
  me privately that he does not wish to receive the emoluments of the
  scholarship, he will therefore be <i>honorary</i> scholar, while the
  scholarship itself will be held by Evson.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Disappointed at the result, as he undoubtedly was, yet Kenrick would have
  been glad at that moment to be able to congratulate Walter. He took it very
  quietly and well. Sorrow and failure had come on him so often lately, that he
  hardly looked for anything else; so, when he had heard the result announced,
  he tried to repress every melancholy thought and walking back to his study,
  resumed his day&rsquo;s work as though nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>And as he sat there, making believe to work, but with thoughts which, in
  spite of himself, sadly wandered, there was a knock at the door, and to his
  great joy, no less than to his intense surprise, Walter Evson entered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Evson,&rdquo; he said, blushing with awkwardness, as he
  remembered how long a time had passed since they had exchanged a word;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come. Sit down. Let me congratulate
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Kenrick,&rdquo; said Walter, holding out his hand; &ldquo;I
  thought we had gone on in this way long enough. I have never had any
  ill-feeling for you, and I feel sure now from your manner that you have none
  towards me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None, Walter, none; I <i>had</i> at one time, but it has long
  ceased; my error has long been explained to me. I have done you wrong,
  Walter, for two years and more; it has been one of my many faults, and the
  chief cause of them all. Can you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heartily, Ken, if I have anything to forgive. We have both been
  punished enough, I think, in losing the happiness which we should have been
  enjoying if we had continued friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Walter, it pains me to think of that irrevocable
  past.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Ken, I have come now for a definite purpose,&rdquo; said
  Walter. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll promise me not to take offence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never again, Walter, with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, tell me honestly, was it of any consequence to you to
  gain this scholarship, in which, so unexpectedly to myself, some accident has
  placed me above you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick reddened slightly, and made no answer, while Walter quickly
  continued&mdash;&ldquo;You know, Ken, that I am going to stay here another
  year; are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not; my guardian does not think that we can afford
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, Ken, I think I may say, without much presumption, that,
  as I stay here for certain, I may safely reckon on getting a scholarship next
  year. At any rate, even if I don&rsquo;t, my father is quite rich enough to
  bear my university expenses unaided without any inconvenience. It would be
  mere selfishness in me, therefore, to retain this scholarship, and I mean to
  resign it at once; so that let me now congratulate <i>you</i> heartily on
  being Marsden scholar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Walter, I can&rsquo;t have you make this sacrifice for my
  sake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help it, Ken; for this is a free country,&rdquo;
  said Walter, smiling, &ldquo;and I may waive a scholarship if I like. But
  it&rsquo;s no sacrifice whatever, my dear fellow; don&rsquo;t say anything
  more about it. It gives me ten times the pleasure that you should hold it
  rather than I. So again I congratulate you; and now, as you must have had
  enough of me, I&rsquo;ll say good morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He rose with a smile to leave the room, but Kenrick, seizing him by the
  hand, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter, you heap coals of fire on my head. Am I never to receive
  anything from you but benefits which I can never return?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh, Ken, there are no benefits between friends; only let us not
  be silent and distant friends any longer. Power is coming into my study to
  tea to-night; won&rsquo;t you join us as in old days?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will, Walter; but can the ghost of old days be called to
  life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps not; but the young present, which is no ghost, shall
  replace the old past, Ken. At six o&rsquo;clock, mind. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet: do stay a little. It is a greater pleasure than
  I can tell you to see you here again, Walter. I want to have a talk with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To make up for two years&rsquo; arrears, eh, Ken? Why, what a
  pretty little study you&rsquo;ve got! Isn&rsquo;t it odd that I should never
  have been in it before? It seems quite natural to me to be here, somehow. You
  must come and see mine this evening; I flatter myself it equals even
  Power&rsquo;s, and beats Flip&rsquo;s in beauty, and looks out on the sea:
  such a jolly view. But you mustn&rsquo;t see it till this evening. I shall
  make Charlie put it to rights in honour of your visit. Charlie beats any fag
  for neatness; why did you turn him off, eh? I&rsquo;ve made him my fag now,
  to keep his hand in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let him come back to me now, Walter; I&rsquo;m sadder and wiser
  since those days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That I will, gladly. I know, too, that he&rsquo;ll be delighted to
  come. Ah, Wilton&rsquo;s photograph, I see,&rdquo; said Walter, still looking
  about him, &ldquo;I thought him greatly improved before he left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick was pleased to see that Walter had no suspicion <i>why</i> he
  left, so that the secret had been kept. They talked on very, very pleasantly,
  for they had much to say to each other, and Walter had, by his simple, easy
  manner, completely broken the ice, and made Kenrick feel at home with him
  again. Kenrick was quite loth to let him go, and kept detaining him so
  eagerly that more than half an hour, which seemed like ten minutes, had
  slipped away before he left. Kenrick looked forward eagerly to meet him again
  in the evening, with Power, and Henderson, and Eden; their meeting would
  fitly inaugurate his return to the better feelings of past days; but it was
  not destined that the meeting should take place; nor was it till many
  evenings afterwards that Kenrick sat once more in the pleasant society of his
  old friends.</p>

  <p>When Walter had at last made good his escape, playfully refusing to be
  imprisoned any longer, Kenrick rose and paced the room. He could hardly
  believe his own happiness; it was the most delightful moment he had
  experienced for many a long day; the scholarship, so long the object of his
  hope and ambition, was now attained; impossible as it had seemed, it was
  actually his, and, at the same moment, the truest friend of his
  boyhood&mdash;the friend for whose returning respect and affection he so long
  had yearned&mdash;was at last restored to him.</p>

  <p>With an overflowing heart he sat down to write to his mother, and
  communicate the good news that he was reconciled to Walter, and that Power
  and Walter had resigned the scholarship in his favour. He had never felt in
  happier spirits than just then; and then, even at the same moment, the cup of
  sincere and innocent joy, so long untasted, was, with one blow, dashed away
  from his lip.</p>

  <p>For at that moment the post came in, and one of his fags, humming a lively
  tune, came running with a letter to his door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A letter for you, Kenrick,&rdquo; the boy said, throwing it
  carelessly on the table, and taking up his merry song as he left the room.
  But Kenrick&rsquo;s eyes were riveted on the letter: it was edged with the
  deepest black, and bore the Fuzby post-mark. For a time he sat stupidly
  staring at it: he dared not open it.</p>

  <p>At length he made an effort, and tore it open. It was a rude, blurred
  scrawl from their old servant, telling him that his mother had died the day
  before. A brief note enclosed in this, from the curate of the place, said,
  &ldquo;It is quite true, my poor boy. Your mother died very suddenly of
  spasms in the heart. God&rsquo;s ways are not as our ways. I have written to
  tell your guardian, and he will no doubt meet you here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kenrick remained stupefied, unable to think, almost unable to comprehend.
  He was roused to his senses by the entrance of his fag to remove his
  breakfast things, which still lay on the table; and with a vague longing for
  some comfort and sympathy, he sent the boy to Walter with the message that
  Kenrick wanted him.</p>

  <p>Walter came at once, and Kenrick, not trusting his voice to speak, pushed
  over to him the letter which contained the fatal news. In such a case human
  consolation cannot reach the sorrow. It passes like the idle wind over the
  wounded heart. All that <i>could</i> be done by words, and looks, and acts of
  sympathy Walter did; and then went to arrange for Kenrick&rsquo;s immediate
  journey, not returning till he came to tell him that a carriage was waiting
  to take him to the train.</p>

  <p>That evening Kenrick reached the house of death, which was still as death
  itself. The old faithful servant opened the door to his knock, and using her
  apron to wipe her eyes, which were red with long weeping, she
  exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Master Harry, Master Harry, she&rsquo;s gone. She had been
  reading and praying in her room, and then she came down to me quite bright
  and cheerful, when the spasms took her, and I helped her to bed, and she
  died.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harry flung down his hat in the hall, and rushed up stairs to his
  mother&rsquo;s room, but when he had opened the door, he stood awe-struck and
  motionless&mdash;for he was alone in the presence of the dead.</p>

  <p>The light of winter sunset was streaming over her, whose life had been a
  winter day. Never even in life had he seen her so lovely, so beautiful with
  the beauty of an angel, as now with the smiling never-broken calm of death
  upon her. Over the pure pale face, from which every wrinkle made by care and
  sorrow had vanished, streamed the last cold radiance of evening, Illuminating
  the peaceful smile, and seeming to linger lovingly as it lit up strange
  glories in the golden hair, smoothed in soft bands over her brow. There she
  lay with her hands folded, as though in prayer, upon her quiet breast; and
  the fitful fever of life had passed away. Dead&mdash;with the smile of heaven
  upon her lips, which should never leave them more!</p>

  <p>Hers had been a hard, mysterious life. In all the sweet bloom of her
  youthful beauty she had left her rich home, not, indeed, without the
  sanction, but against the wishes of her relatives, to brave trial and poverty
  with the man she loved. How bitter that poverty, how severe, how unexpected
  those trials had proved to be, we have seen already; and then, still young,
  as though she were meant to tread with her tender feet the whole thorny round
  of human sorrow, she had been left a widow with an only son. And during the
  eight years of her widowed loneliness, her relatives had neglected with cold
  pride both her and her orphan boy; even that orphan boy, in the midst of all
  his love for her, had by his pride and waywardness caused her many an anxious
  hour and many an aching heart, yet she clung to him with an affection whose
  yearning depth no tongue can utter. And now, still young, she had died
  suddenly, and left him on the threshold of dangerous youth almost without a
  friend in the wide world; had passed, with a silence which could never more
  be broken, into the eternal world; had left him, whom she loved with such
  intensity of unspeakable affection, without a word, without a look, without a
  sign of farewell. She had passed away in a moment to the far-off untroubled
  shore, whence waving hands cannot be seen, and no sounds of farewell voices
  heard. How must that life expand in the unconceived glory of that new
  dawn&mdash;the life which on earth so little sunshine visited!</p>

  <p>She was one of the most sweet, the most pure, the most unselfish, the most
  beautifully blameless of all God&rsquo;s children; and she had lived in
  hardship, in neglect, in anxiety, in calumny; she had lived among those mean
  and wretched villagers: an angel was among them, and they knew it not; she
  had tasted no other drink but the bitter waters of affliction; no hope had
  brightened, no love sustained, her earthly course. And now her young orphan
  son, his heart dead within him for anguish, his conscience tortured by
  remorse, was kneeling in that agony which no weak words can paint, was
  kneeling for the last time, <i>too late</i>, beside her corpse.</p>

  <p>Truly life is a mystery, which the mind of man cannot fathom till the
  glory of eternal truth enlighten it!</p>

  <h2>XXXVIII. &mdash; THE STUPOR BROKEN</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>The white stone, unfractured, ranks as most precious;<br>
    The blue lily, unblemished, emits the finest fragrance;<br>
    The heart, when it is harassed, finds no place of rest;<br>
    The mind, in the midst of bitterness, thinks only of grief.</i><br>
    &mdash;<i>The Sorrows of Hn, a Chinese Tragedy</i>.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">AFTER these days Kenrick returned to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s,
  as he supposed, for the last time. His guardian, a stiff, unsympathising man,
  had informed him, that as his mother&rsquo;s annuity ceased with her life,
  there was very little left to support him. The sale, however, of the house at
  Fuzby, and the scholarship which he had just won, would serve to maintain him
  for a few years, and meanwhile his guardian would endeavour to secure for him
  a place in some merchant&rsquo;s office, where gradually he would be able to
  earn a livelihood.</p>

  <p>It was a very different life from that which this fine, clever high-
  spirited boy had imagined for himself, and he looked forward to the prospect
  with settled despair. But he seemed now to regard himself as a victim of
  destiny, regretting nothing, and opposing nothing, and caring for nothing. He
  told Walter with bitter exaggeration &ldquo;that he must <i>indeed</i> thank
  him for giving up the scholarship, as he supposed that it had saved him from
  starvation. His guardian, who had a family of his own, didn&rsquo;t seem to
  care a straw for him; and he had no friend in the world besides.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And as, for days and weeks, he brooded over these gloomy thoughts and sad
  memories, he fell into a weary, broken, aimless kind of life. Many tried to
  comfort him, but they could not reach his sorrow; in their several ways his
  school friends did all they could to cheer him up, but they all failed. He
  grew moody, solitary, silent. Walter often sought him out, and talked in his
  lively, cheerful, happy strain; but even <i>his</i> society Kenrick seemed to
  shun. He was in that morbid, unhealthy state when to meet others inspires a
  positive shrinking of mind. He seemed to have no pleasure except in shutting
  himself up in his study, and in taking long lonely walks. He performed his
  house duties mechanically, and by routine; when he read the lessons in
  chapel, his voice sounded as though it came from afar, like the voice of one
  who dreamed; he sat with his books before him for long hours, and made no
  progress, hardly knowing the page on which he was employed. In school, he sat
  listlessly playing with his pen, taking no notes, seeming as though he heard
  nothing, and was scarcely aware of what was going on. His friends could not
  guess what would come of it, but they grew afraid for him when they saw him
  mope thus inconsolably, and pine away without respite, till his eyes grew
  heavy, and his face pale and thin. He had changed all his ways; he seemed to
  have altered his very nature; he played no games, took no interest in
  anything, and dropped all his old pursuits. His work was quite spiritless,
  and he grew so absent that he forgot the commonest occupations of every
  day&mdash;living as in a waking sleep.</p>

  <p>Power and Walter, in talking of him, often wondered whether it was the
  uncertainty of his future prospects which had thus affected him; and in the
  full belief that this must have something to do with his morbid melancholy,
  Power mentioned the matter to Dr Lane as soon as he had the opportunity.</p>

  <p>Dr Lane had observed, with much pity, the depression which had fastened on
  Kenrick like a disease. He was not surprised to see him come back deeply
  affected; but if &ldquo;the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts,&rdquo;
  its sorrows are usually short and transient, and he looked upon it as
  unnatural that Kenrick&rsquo;s grief should seem thus incurable, and that a
  young boy like him should thus refuse to be comforted. It was not long before
  he introduced the subject, while talking to Power after looking over his
  composition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kenrick has just been here, Power,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it pains
  me to see him so sadly altered. I can hardly get him to speak a word; all
  things seem equally indifferent to him, and his eyes look to me as though
  they were always ready to overflow with tears. What can we manage to do for
  him? Would not a little cheerful society brighten him up? We had him here the
  other day, but he did not speak once the whole evening. Can&rsquo;t even
  Henderson get him to smile somehow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, sir,&rdquo; said Power. &ldquo;Henderson and
  Evson and I have all tried, but he seems to avoid seeing any one. It makes
  him ill at ease apparently. I am afraid, for one thing, that he is vexing
  himself about not being allowed to return, and about being sent into a
  merchant&rsquo;s office, which he detests.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If that is all, there can be no difficulty about it,&rdquo; said
  the Doctor; &ldquo;we have often kept deserving boys here, when funds failed,
  and I can easily assure his guardian, without his knowing of it, that the
  expense need not for a moment stand in the way of his return.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>These generous acts are common at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, for she is
  indeed an <i>alma mater</i> to all her children; and since Kenrick had
  confided this particular sorrow to <i>Walter</i>, Walter undertook to remove
  it by telling him that Dr Lane would persuade his guardian to let him return.
  Kenrick appeared glad of the news, as though it brought him a little relief,
  but it made no long change in his present ways.</p>

  <p>Nor even did a still further piece of good fortune, when his guardian
  wrote and told him that, <i>on condition of his being sent to the
  University</i>, an unknown and anonymous friend had placed at his disposal
  100 pounds a year, to be continued until such time as he was able to maintain
  himself; and that this generous gift would of course permit of his receiving
  the advantage of an Oxford training, and obviate the necessity of his
  entering an office, by clearing for him the way to one of the learned
  professions. This news stirred him up a little, and for a time&mdash;but not
  for long. He looked upon it all as destiny: he could not guess, he hardly
  tried to surmise, who the unknown friend could be. Nor did he know till years
  afterwards that the aid was given by the good and wealthy Sir Lawrence Power,
  at his son&rsquo;s earnest and generous request. For Power did this kind deed
  by stealth, and mentioned it to no one, not even to Walter; and Kenrick
  little thought when he told the good news to Power, and received his kind
  congratulations, that Power had known of it before he did himself. But still,
  in spite of all, Kenrick seemed sick at heart, and his life crept on in a
  sluggish course, like a river that loses its bright stream in the desert, and
  all whose silver runnels are choked up with dust and sand.</p>

  <p>The fact was, that the blows of punishment had fallen on him so fast and
  so heavily that he felt crushed to the very earth. The expulsion of the
  reprobates with whom he had consorted, his degradation and censure,
  Wilton&rsquo;s theft and removal, the violent tension and revulsion of
  feeling caused by his awakened conscience, his confession, and the gnawing
  sense of shame, the failure of his ambition, and then his mother&rsquo;s
  death coming as the awful climax of the calamities he had undergone, and
  followed by the cold unfeeling harshness of his guardian, and the damping of
  his hopes&mdash;all these things had broken the boy&rsquo;s spirit utterly.
  Disgrace, and sorrow, and bereavement, and the stings of remorse, and the
  suffering of punishment&mdash;the forfeiture of a guilty past, and the gloom
  of a lonely future&mdash;these things unmanned him, bowed him down, poisoned
  his tranquillity of mind, unhinged every energy of his soul, seemed to dry up
  the very springs of life. The hand of man could not rouse him from the stupor
  caused by the chastisements of God.</p>

  <p>But the rousing came at last, and in due time; and it all came from a very
  little matter&mdash;so slight a matter as a little puff of seaward air. A
  trivial accident, you will say; yes, one of those very trivial accidents that
  so often affect the destinies of a lifetime, and:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>&ldquo;Shape our ends,<br>
    Rough-hew them how we will.&rdquo;</i><br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Kenrick, as usual, was walking along the top of the cliffs
  alone&mdash;restless, aimless, and miserable&mdash;&ldquo;mooning,&rdquo; as
  the boys would have called it&mdash;unable even to analyse his own thoughts,
  conscious only that it was folly in him to nurse this long-continued and
  hopeless melancholy, yet quite incapable of making the one strong effort
  which would have enabled him to throw it off. And in this mood he sat down
  near the cliff, thinking of nothing, but watching, with idle guesses as to
  their destination and history, the few vessels that passed by on the horizon.
  The evening was drawing-in, cold and windy; and suddenly remembering that he
  must be back by tea-time, he rose up to return. The motion displaced his
  straw hat, and the next moment the breeze had carried it a little way over
  the edge of the cliff, where it was caught in a low bush of tamarisk. It
  rested but a few feet below him, and the chalky front of the cliff was
  sufficiently rough to admit of his descent. He climbed to it, and had just
  succeeded in disengaging it with his foot, when before he had time to seize
  it, it again fell, and rolled down some thirty feet. Kenrick, finding that he
  had been able to get down with tolerable ease, determined to continue his
  descent in order to secure it. It never occurred to him that the hat was of
  no great importance, and that it would have been infinitely less trouble to
  walk home without it, and buy a new one, than to run the risk and encounter
  the trouble of his climb. However, he <i>did</i> manage to reach it, and put
  it on with some satisfaction, when, as he was beginning to remount, a
  considerable mass of chalk crumbled away under his feet, and made him cling
  on with both hands to avoid being precipitated. He had been able to get down
  well enough, because, if the chalk slipped, he glided on safely with it, but
  in climbing up he was obliged to press his feet strongly downwards in order
  to gain his spring; and every time he did this, he found that the chalk kept
  giving way, exhausting him with futile efforts, filling his shoes with dust
  and pebbles, slipping into his clothes, and blinding his eyes. Every person
  who has climbed at all, whether in the Alps or elsewhere, knows that it is
  easy enough to get down places which it is almost impossible to mount again;
  and Kenrick, after many attempts, found that he had been most imprudent, and
  becoming seriously alarmed, was forced, when he had quite tired himself with
  fruitless exertions and had once or twice nearly fallen, to give up the
  attempt altogether, and do his best to secure another way of escape.</p>

  <p>This was to climb down quite to the bottom of the cliff, and make his way,
  as best he could, over rocks and shingle round the bluff which shut in one
  side of the little bay on which he stood, and along the narrow line of beach,
  to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s head. This was possible sometimes, and he fancied
  that the tide was sufficiently far out to enable him to do it now. At any
  rate herein lay, so far as he saw, his only chance of safety.</p>

  <p>Down the cliff then he climbed once more, and though it was some ninety
  feet high he found no difficulty in doing this, with care, till he came to a
  place where its surface was precipitous for a height of some ten feet, worn
  smooth by the beating of the waves. Holding with his hands to the edge, he
  let himself fall down this height, and found himself standing, a little
  shaken though unhurt, in a small pebbly bay or indentation of the shore
  formed by a curve in the line of cliffs, with a series of headlands and
  precipices trending away on one side far to his right, and with the Ness of
  Saint Winifred&rsquo;s reaching out to his left. Once round that headland he
  would be safe, and indeed if he once got beyond the little pebbly inlet where
  he stood, he hoped to find some place where he might scale the rocks, and so
  cross the promontory and get home.</p>

  <p>There was no time to be lost, and he ran with all his speed over the loose
  stones towards the bluff, letting the unlucky straw hat drop on the shore, as
  it had no string, and it impeded him to be obliged to hold it on with one
  hand. Reaching the end of the shingle, he stumbled with difficulty over some
  scattered rocks slimy with ooze and seagrass, hoping with intense hope that
  when he rounded the projection of cliff, he would see a line of beach, narrow
  indeed, but still wide enough to allow of his running along it before the
  tide had come in, and reaching some part of Saint Winifred&rsquo;s Head which
  he might be able to scale by means of a sheep-path, or with the help of hands
  and knees. Very quickly he reached the corner, and hardly dared to look; but
  when he <i>did</i> look, a glance showed him that but slender hope was left.
  At one spot the tide had already reached the foot of the cliffs; but if he
  could get to that spot while the water was yet sufficiently shallow to allow
  him to run through it, he trusted that he might yet be saved. The place was
  far-off, but he ran and ran; and ever as he ran the place seemed to get
  farther and farther, and his knees failed him for fatigue, as he sank at
  every step in the noisy and yielding mixture of sand and pebbles.</p>

  <p>Reader, have you ever run a race with the sea? If not, accept the
  testimony of one who has had to do it more than once, that it is a very
  painful and exciting race. I ran it once successfully with one who, though we
  then escaped, has since been overtaken and swallowed up by the great dark
  waves of that other sea, whose tides are ever advancing upon us, and must
  sooner or later absorb us all&mdash;the great dark waves of Death. But to
  take your life in your hand, and run and to know that the sea is gaining upon
  you, and that, however great the speed with which fear wings your feet, your
  subtle hundred-handed enemy is intercepting you with its many deep inlets,
  and does not bate an instant&rsquo;s speed, or withhold itself a
  hair&rsquo;s-breadth for all your danger&mdash;is an awful thing to feel. And
  then to see that it <i>has</i> intercepted you is worst of all; it is a
  moment not to be forgotten. And all this was what Kenrick had to undergo. He
  ran until he panted for breath, and stumbled for very weariness&mdash;but he
  was too late. A broad sheet of water now bathed the bases of the cliff, and
  the waves, as though angry with the opposing breeze, were leaping up with a
  frantic hiss, and deluging the rocks with sheets of spray and foam.</p>

  <p>Experience had taught him with what speed and fury on that dangerous coast
  the treacherous tide came in. There was not a moment to spare, and as he flew
  back to the small shelter of the pebbly cove, the water was already gliding
  close to him, and stretching its arms like a hungry medusa round the
  seaweed-matted lumps of scattered rock over which he strode.</p>

  <p>His face wetted with the salt dew, his brown hair scattered on the rising
  wind, he flew rather than ran once more to the place where he had descended,
  to renew the wild attempt to scale the cliff which seemed to afford him the
  only shadow of a hope. Yet a mere glance might have been enough to show him
  that this hope was vain. Both at that spot, and as far as he could see, the
  sheer base of the cliff offered him no place where it was possible to rest a
  foot, no place where he could mount three feet above the shingle. But his
  scrutiny brought home to him another appalling fact&mdash;namely, that the
  sea-mark, where the highest tide fringed its barriers with a triumphal
  wreath of hanging seaweed, and below which no foliage grew, was high up upon
  the cliff, far above his head.</p>

  <p>It was too late to curse his rashness and folly, nor would he even try to
  face his frightful situation till he had thought of every conceivable means
  by which to escape. A friend of mine had, and I suppose still has, a pen-and-
  ink sketch which made one shudder to look at it. All that you see is a long
  sea-wall, apparently the side of some stone pier, so drawn as to give the
  impression of great height, and the top of it not visible in the picture; by
  the side of this ripples and plashes a long dark reach of sea water, lazily
  waving the weeds which it has planted in the crevices of stone, and
  extending, like the wall itself, farther than you can guess. The only living
  thing in the picture is a single spent, shaggy dog, its paws rested for a
  moment on a sort of hollow in the wall, and half its dripping body emergent
  from the dark water. It is staring up with a look of despondent exhaustion,
  yet mute appeal. The sketch powerfully recalls and typifies the exact
  position in which poor Kenrick: now found himself placed&mdash;before him the
  hungry, angry darkening sea, behind him the inaccessible bastions of
  forbidding cliff. It is a horrible predicament, and those can most
  thrillingly appreciate it who, like the author, have been in it
  themselves.</p>

  <p>There was yet one thing, and one thing only, to be tried, and it was truly
  the refuge of desperation. Kenrick was an excellent swimmer; many a time in
  bathing at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, even when he was a little boy, he had
  struck out boldly far into the bay, even as far as the huge tumbling red
  buoy, that spent its restless life in &ldquo;ever climbing with the climbing
  wave.&rdquo; If he could swim for pleasure, could he not swim for life? It
  was true that the swim before him was, beyond all comparison, farther and
  more hazardous than he had ever dreamt of. But swimming is an art which
  inspires extraordinary confidence; it makes us fancy that drowning is
  impossible to us, because we cannot imagine ourselves so fatigued as to fail
  in keeping above water. Kenrick knew that the attempt was only one to be
  undertaken at dire extremity; but that extremity had now arrived, and it was
  literally the last chance that lay between him and&mdash;what he would not
  think of yet.</p>

  <p>So, in the wintry air, with the strong wind blowing keenly and the red
  gleam of sunset already beginning to fail, he flung off his clothes on the
  damp beach, and as one who rushes on a forlorn hope in the teeth of an enemy,
  he ran down the rough uneven shore, hardly noticing how much it hurt his
  feet, and plunged boldly into the hideous yeast of seething waves. The cold
  made him shiver and shiver in every limb; his teeth chattered; he was afraid
  of cramp; the slimy seaweeds that his feet touched, the tangled and rotting
  string of sea-twine that waved about his legs, sent a strong shudder through
  him; and there was a sick clammy feeling about the frothy spume through which
  he had to plunge. But when he had once ploughed his way through all this, and
  was fairly out of his depth, the exercise warmed him, and he rose with a
  swimmer&rsquo;s triumphant motion over the yielding waves. On and on he swam,
  thinking only of that, not looking before him; but when he began to feel
  quite tired, and <i>did</i> look, he saw that he was not nearly halfway to
  the headland. He saw, too, how the breakers were lashing and fighting with
  the iron shore which he was madly striving to reach. Even if he could swim so
  far&mdash;and he now <i>felt</i> that he could not&mdash;how could he ever
  land at such a spot? Would not one of those billows toss him up in its
  playful spray, and dash him as it dashed its own unpitied offspring, dead
  upon the rocks? And as this conviction dawned on him, withering all his
  energy of heart, the wind wailed over him, the water bubbled in his ears, and
  the sea-mew, napping as it flew past him, uttered above his head its
  plaintive scream. His heart sank within him. With a quick motion he turned in
  the water, and with arms wearied-out he swam back again, as for dear life,
  towards the little landing-place which alone divided him from instant death;
  struggling on heavily, with limbs so weary that he could barely move them
  through the waves, whose increasing swell often broke around his head.
  Already the tide had reached the spot where he had let his straw hat drop on
  the beach; the sea was scornfully playing with it, tossing it up and down,
  whirling it round and round like a feather; the wind blew it to the sea, and
  the sea, receiving no gifts from an enemy, flung it back again; but the wind
  carried the day, and while Kenrick was wringing the brine out of his dripping
  hair, and huddling his clothes again over his wet, benumbed, and aching
  limbs, he saw the straw hat fairly launched, and floating away over the
  waves.</p>

  <p>And then it was that, as the vision of sudden death glared out before his
  eyes, and the horror of it leapt upon him, that a scream&mdash;a loud, wild,
  echoing scream, which sounded strange in that lonely place, and rose above
  the rude song that the wind was now singing,&mdash;broke from his blanched
  lips. And another, and another, and then silence; for Kenrick was now
  crouching at the cliff&rsquo;s foot furthest off from the swelling flood,
  with his eyes fixed motionless in a wild stare on its advancing line of foam.
  He was conjuring up before his imagination the time when those waves should
  have reached him; should have swept him away from the shelter of the shore,
  or risen above his lips; should have forced him again to struggle and swim,
  until his strength, already impaired by hunger, and thirst, and cold, and
  fatigue, should have failed him altogether, and he would sink, and the water
  gurgle wildly in his ears, and stop his breath&mdash;and all would be still.
  And when he had pictured this scene to himself with a vividness which made
  him experience all its agony, for a time his mind flew back through all the
  faultful past up to that very day; memory lighted her lantern, and threw its
  blaze on every dark corner, on every hidden recess, every forgotten
  nook&mdash;left no spot unsearched, unilluminated with sudden flash; all his
  past sins were before him, words, looks, thoughts, everything. As when a man
  descends with a light in his diving-bell into the heaving sea, the strange
  monsters of the deep, attracted by the unknown glimmer, throng and wallow
  terribly around him, so did uncouth thoughts and forgotten sins welter in
  fearful multitudes round this light of memory in the deep sea of that poor
  human soul. And finally, as though in demon voices, came this message
  whispered to him, touted to him tauntingly, rising and falling with maddening
  alternation on the rising and falling of the wind&mdash;&ldquo;You have been
  wasting your life, moodily abandoning yourself to idle misery, neglecting
  your duties, letting your talents rust&mdash;<i>God will take from you the
  life you know not how to use</i>.&rdquo; And then, as though in answer to
  this, another voice, low, soft, sweet, that his heart knew well&mdash;another
  voice filling the interspaces of the others with unseen music, whispered to
  him soothingly&mdash;&ldquo;It shall be given you again, use it better;
  awake, use it better, <i>it shall be given you again</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Those three wild shrieks of his had been heard; he did not know it, but
  they had been heard. The whole coast was in general so lonely that you could
  usually pace it for miles without meeting a single human being, and it never
  even occurred to him that some one might pass that way. But it so happened
  that the boisterous weather of the last few days had cast away a schooner at
  a place some five miles from Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, and Walter Evson had
  walked with Charlie to see the wreck, and was returning along the cliff. As
  they passed the spot where Kenrick was, they had been first startled and then
  horrified by those shrieks, and while they stood listening another came to
  their ears, more piercing, more heart-rending than the rest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens! there <i>must</i> be some one down there!&rdquo;
  exclaimed Walter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, how could any one have got there?&rdquo; asked Charlie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, but didn&rsquo;t you hear some one scream?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, several times. O Walter, do look here!&rdquo; Charlie pointed
  to the traces on the cliff showing that some one had descended there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who could have wanted to get down <i>there</i>, I wonder; and for
  what possible purpose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you see any one, Walter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t; there&rsquo;s nothing but the
  sea&rdquo;&mdash;for Kenrick, crouching under the cliff, was hidden from
  sight, and now the tide had come up so far that, from the summit, none of the
  shingle was visible&mdash;&ldquo;but what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Walter, <i>it&rsquo;s a straw hat</i>; it must be one of our
  fellows down there; I see the ribbon distinctly, dark blue and white, twisted
  together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Dark blue and white</i>! why, then, it must be some one in the
  football eleven: Charlie, it must be Kenrick! Heavens, what can have
  happened?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kenrick!&rdquo; they both shouted at the top of their voices.</p>

  <p>But the cliff was high, and the wind, momently rising to a blast, swept
  away their shouts, and although Kenrick might have heard them distinctly
  under ordinary circumstances, they now only mingled with, and gave new form
  and body to, the wild madness which terror was beginning to kindle in his
  brain. So they shouted, and no answer came.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No answer comes, Charlie; but there&rsquo;s someone down there as
  sure as we are here,&rdquo; said Walter. Charlie had already begun to try and
  descend the face of the cliff. &ldquo;Stop, stop, Charlie,&rdquo; said
  Walter, seizing him and dragging him up again, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t try
  that&mdash;nay, Charlie, you really <i>must not</i>. If it&rsquo;s possible
  <i>I</i> will.&rdquo; He tried, but three minutes showed him that, however
  practicable a descent might be, an ascent afterwards would be wholly beyond
  his power. Besides, if he did descend, what could he do? Clearly nothing; and
  with another plan in view, he with difficulty reached his former
  position.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing to be done that way, Charlie.&rdquo; At that moment another
  cry came, for Kenrick, in a momentary lull of the wind, had fancied that he
  had heard sounds and voices other than those of his perturbed and agitated
  fancy. &ldquo;Ha! you heard that?&rdquo; said Walter, and he shouted again,
  but no sound was returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must fly to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, Charlie; there&rsquo;s a boy
  down on the shore beyond a doubt. You stay behind, if you like, for you
  can&rsquo;t run as fast as me. I&rsquo;m afraid, though, it&rsquo;s not the
  least good. Saint Winifred&rsquo;s is three miles from here, and long before
  I&rsquo;ve got help and come three miles back, it&rsquo;s clear that no one
  can be alive down there; still we must try,&rdquo; and he was starting when
  Charlie seized his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember, Walter, the hut at Bryce&rsquo;s cove?
  There&rsquo;s an old boat there, and it&rsquo;s a mile and a half nearer than
  Saint Win&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Capital</i> boy, Charlie,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;how good of
  you to think of it; it&rsquo;s the very thing. Come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They flew along at full speed, Walter taking Charlie&rsquo;s hand, and
  saying, &ldquo;Never mind stretching your legs for once, even if you
  <i>are</i> tired. How well you run! we shall be there in no time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They gained the cove, flew down the steep narrow path, and reached the hut
  door. Their summons was answered only by the furious barking of a dog. No one
  was in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind: there&rsquo;s the boat; we must take French
  leave;&rdquo; and Walter, springing down, hastily unmoored it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wah! what a horrid old tub, and it wants baling, Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay for that, Charlie boy; it&rsquo;s a good thing
  that Semlyn Lake has taught us both to row, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O yes; don&rsquo;t you wish we had the little <i>Pearl</i> here
  now, Walter? Wouldn&rsquo;t we make it fly, instead of this cranky old
  wretch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, we must fancy that this is the <i>Pearl</i> and this Semlyn
  Lake,&rdquo; said Walter, wading up to the knees to launch the boat, and
  springing in when he had given it the final shove.</p>

  <p>They were excellent rowers, but Charlie had never tried his skill in a sea
  like that, and was timid, for which there was every excuse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How very rough it is, Walter,&rdquo; he said, as the boat tossed up
  and down like an egg-shell on the high waves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep up your heart, Charlie, and row steadily; don&rsquo;t be
  afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Walter, I won&rsquo;t, as you&rsquo;re with me;
  but&mdash;Walter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be dark in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not quite, and we shall be there by that time; we needn&rsquo;t go
  far out, and the tide&rsquo;s with us.&rdquo; So the two brave brothers rowed
  steadily on, with only one more remark from Charlie, ushered in by the
  word&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anything more to frighten me with, Charlie?&rdquo; he answered
  cheerily; &ldquo;you shan&rsquo;t succeed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Walter,&rdquo; he answered, with a little touch of shame,
  &ldquo;I was only going to say that, if you look, you&rsquo;ll see that your
  oar&rsquo;s been broken, and is only spliced together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it all along, Charlie, and will use the oar
  gingerly; and now, Charlie, I see you&rsquo;re a little frightened, my boy.
  I&rsquo;m going to brace you up. Rest on your oar a minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did so. &ldquo;Now turn round and <i>look</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pointed with his finger to a dark figure, now distinctly seen, cowering
  low at the white cliff&rsquo;s foot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter, I&rsquo;m ready; I won&rsquo;t say a word more;&rdquo;
  and he leant to his oar, and plied it like a man.</p>

  <p>It is a pretty, a delightful thing, in idle summer-time to lie at full
  length upon the beach on some ambrosial summer evening, when a glow floats
  over the water, whose calm surface is tenderly rippled with gold and blue.
  And while the children play beside you, dabbling and paddling in the
  wavelets, and digging up the ridges of yellow sand, which take the print of
  their pattering footsteps, nothing is more pleasant than to let the
  transparent stream of the quiet tide plash musically with its light and
  motion to your very feet; nothing more pleasant than to listen to its silken
  murmurs, and to watch it flow upwards with its beneficent coolness, and take
  possession of the shore. But it is a very different thing when there rises
  behind you a wall of frowning cliff, precipitous, inaccessible, affording no
  hope of refuge; and when, for the golden calm of summer eventide, you have
  the cheerless drawing-in of a loud and stormy February night; and when you
  have the furious hissing violence of rock-and-wind-struck breakers for the
  violet-coloured margin of rippling waves&mdash;knowing that the wind is
  wailing forth your requiem, and that, with the fall of every breaker, unseen
  hands are ringing your knell of death.</p>

  <p>The boy crouched there, his face white as the cliffs above him, his
  undried limbs almost powerless for cold, and his clothes wetted through and
  through with spray&mdash;pushing aside every moment the dripping locks of
  hair which the wind scattered over his forehead, that he might look with
  hollow, staring eyes on the Death which was advancing towards him, wrapping
  him already in its huge mantle-folds, calling aloud to him, beckoning him,
  freezing him to the very bone with the touch of its icy hands.</p>

  <p>And the brutal tide coming on, according to the pitiless irreversible
  certainty of the fixed laws that governed it&mdash;coming on like a huge
  wallowing monster, dumb and blind&mdash;knew not, and recked not, of the
  young life that quivered on the verge of its advance&mdash;that it was about
  to devour remorselessly, with no wrath to satiate, with no hunger to appease.
  None the less for the boy&rsquo;s presence, unregardful of his growing horror
  and wild suspense, it continued its uncouth play&mdash;leaping about the
  rocks, springing upwards and stretching high hands to pluck down the cliffs,
  seeming to laugh as it fell back shattered and exhausted, but unsubdued;
  charging up sometimes like a herd of white horses, bounding one over the
  other, shaking their foaming manes&mdash;hissing sometimes like a brood of
  huge sea-serpents, as it insinuated it winding streams among the boulders of
  the shore.</p>

  <p>It might have seemed to be in sport with <i>him</i> as it ran first up to
  his feet, and playfully splashed him, as a bather might splash a person on
  the shore from head to heel, and then ran back again for a moment, and then
  up again a little farther, till, as he sat on the extreme line of the shore
  and with his back huddled up close against the cliff, it first wetted the
  soles of his feet, and then was over his shoes, then ankle-deep, then knee
  deep, then to the waist. Already it seemed to buoy him up; he knew that in a
  few moments more he would be forced to swim, and the last struggle would
  commence.</p>

  <p>His brain was dull, his senses blunted, his mind half-idiotic, when first
  (for his eyes had been fixed downwards on the growing, encroaching waters) he
  caught a glimpse, in the failing daylight, of the black outline of a boat,
  not twenty yards from him, and caught the sound of its plashing oars. He
  stared eagerly at it, and just as it came beside him he lost all his
  strength, uttered a faint cry, and slipped down fainting into the waves.</p>

  <h2>XXXIX. &mdash; ON THE DARK SEA</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>...Boys<br>
    Leaning upon their oars, with splash and strain,<br>
    Made white with foam the green and purple sea.</i><br>
    &mdash;Shelley.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">IN a moment Walter&rsquo;s strong arms had caught him, and
  lifted him tenderly into the boat. While the waves tossed them up and down
  they placed him at full length as comfortably as they could,&mdash;which was
  not very comfortably&mdash;and though his clothes were streaming with salt
  water, and his fainting fit still continued, they began at once to row home.
  For, by this time, it was dim twilight; the wind was blowing great guns, the
  clouds were full of dark wrath, and the stormy billows rose higher and
  higher. There was no time to spare, and it would be as much as they could do
  to provide for their own safety. The tide was already bumping them against
  the cliff at the place where, just in time, they had rescued Kenrick, and, in
  order to get themselves fairly off, Walter, forgetting for a moment, pushed
  out his oar and pressed against the cliff. The damaged oar was weak enough
  already, and instantly Walter saw that his vigorous shove had weakened and
  displaced the old splicing of the blade. Charlie too observed it, but neither
  of them spoke a word; on the contrary, the little boy was at his place, oar
  in rowlock, and immediately smote lightly and in good time the surface of the
  water, splashed it into white foam, and pulled with gallant strokes.</p>

  <p>They made but little way; the waves pitched them so high and dropped them
  with such a heavy fall between their rolling troughs, that rowing became
  almost impossible, and the miserable old boat shipped quantities of water. At
  last, after a stronger pull than usual, Walter&rsquo;s oar creaked, snapped,
  and gave way, flinging him on his back. The loosened twine with which it had
  been spliced was half rotten with age; it broke in several places, the oar
  blade fell off and floated away, and Walter was left holding in both hands a
  broken and futile stump.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My God, it is all over with us!&rdquo; was the wild cry that the
  sudden and awful misfortune wrung from his lips; while Charlie, shipping his
  now useless oar, clung round his brother&rsquo;s neck and cried aloud. The
  three boys&mdash;one of them faint, exhausted, and speechless&mdash;were in
  an unsafe and oarless boat on the open tempestuous sea, weltering hopelessly
  at the cruel mercy of winds and waves; a current was sweeping them they knew
  not whither, and the wind, howling like a hurricane, was driving them farther
  and farther away from land.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter, I can&rsquo;t die, I can&rsquo;t die yet; and not out on
  this black sea, away from every one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From every one but God, Charlie; and I am with you. Cheer up,
  little brother, God will not desert us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter, pray to God for you and me and Kenrick | pray to Him for
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will both pray, Charlie;&rdquo; and folding his arms round him,
  for now that the rowing was over and there was nothing left to do, the little
  boy was frightened at the increasing gloom, Walter, calm even at that wild
  moment, with the calm of a clear conscience and a noble heart, poured forth
  his soul in words of supplication, while Charlie, his voice half stifled with
  tears, sobbed out a terrified response and echo to his prayer.</p>

  <p>And after the prayer Walter&rsquo;s heart was lightened and his spirit
  strengthened, till he felt ready in himself to meet anything and brave any
  fate; but his soul ached with pity for his little brother and for his friend.
  It was his duty to cheer them both and do what could be done. Kenrick had so
  far recovered as to move and say a few words, and the brothers were by his
  side in a moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have saved my life, Walter, when I had given it up; saved it, I
  hope, to some purpose this time,&rdquo; he whispered, unconscious as yet of
  his position; and he dragged up his feet out of the pool of water in which
  they were lying at the bottom of the boat. But gradually the situation dawned
  upon him. &ldquo;How is it you&rsquo;re not rowing?&rdquo; he asked;
  &ldquo;are you tired? let <i>me</i> try, I think I could manage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It would be of no use, Ken,&rdquo; said Walter; &ldquo;I mean that
  we can&rsquo;t row,&rdquo; and he pointed to the broken oar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you have saved me at the risk, perhaps at the cost, of your
  own lives. O you noble, noble Walter!&rdquo; said Kenrick, the tears gushing
  from his eyes. &ldquo;How awfully terrible this is! I seem to be snatched
  from death to death. Life and death are battling for me to-night; yes,
  eternal life and death too,&rdquo; he whispered in Walter&rsquo;s ear,
  catching him by the wrist. &ldquo;All this danger is for me, Walter, and for
  my sin. I am like Jonah in the ship; I have been buffeting death away for
  hours, but he has been sent for me, he must do his mission. I see that
  <i>I</i> cannot escape, but, O God, I hope that <i>you</i> will escape,
  Walter. Your life and Charlie&rsquo;s must not be spilt for mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was barely light enough to see his face, but it looked wild and haggard
  in the ragged gleams of moonlight which the black flitting clouds suffered to
  break forth at intervals; and his words, after this, were too incoherent to
  understand. Walter saw that the long intensity of fear had rendered him half
  delirious and not master of himself. Soon after he sank into a stupor, half
  sleep, half exhaustion, and even the lurching of the boat did not rouse him
  any more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walter, he&rsquo;s asleep, or&mdash;oh! is he dead, Walter?&rdquo;
  asked Charlie, in horror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, Charlie; there, put your hand upon his heart. You see it
  beats; he is only exhausted, and in a sort of swoon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he will be pitched over, Walter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll show you what we&rsquo;ll do, Charlie. We must make
  the best of everything.&rdquo; Walter lifted up the useless rudder, pulled
  out the string of it to lash Kenrick safely to the stern bench by which he
  lay, and took off his own coat in order to cover him up that he might sleep;
  and then, anxious above all things to relieve Charlie&rsquo;s terror, the
  unselfish boy, thinking only of others, sat beside him on the centre bench,
  and encircled him with a protecting arm. And, as though to increase their
  misery, the cold rain began to fall in torrents.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter, it&rsquo;s so cold, and wet, and stormy, and pitch dark.
  I&rsquo;m frightened, Walter. I try not to be, but I can&rsquo;t help it.
  Take me on your knees and pray for us again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Walter took him on his knees, and laid his head against his own breast,
  and folded him in his arms, and wiped his tears; and the little boy&rsquo;s
  sobs ceased as Walter&rsquo;s voice rose once more in a strain of intense
  prayer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walter, God <i>must</i> grant that prayer; I&rsquo;m sure He must;
  He can&rsquo;t reject it,&rdquo; said Charlie simply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will answer it in the way best for us, Charlie; whatever that
  is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But shall we die?&rdquo; asked his brother again, with a cold
  shudder at the word.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Remember what you said just now, Charlie, and be brave. But even if
  we were to die, could we die better, little brother, than in doing our duty,
  and trying to save dear Ken&rsquo;s life? It isn&rsquo;t such a terrible
  thing, Charlie, after all. We must all die some time, you know, and boys have
  died as young and younger than you or me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, but not like this, Walter: out in these icy, black, horrid
  waters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, they have indeed, Charlie; little friendless sailor-boys
  dashed on far-away rocks that splintered their ships to atoms, or swallowed
  up when their vessel foundered in great typhoons, thousands of miles away
  from home and England, in unknown seas; little boys like you, Charlie; and
  they have died bravely, too, though no living soul was near them to hear
  their cries, and nothing to mark their graves but the bubble for one minute
  while they sank.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have they, Walter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, many and many a time they have; and the same God Who called for
  their lives gave them courage and strength to die, as He will give us if
  there is need.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then Charlie said, &ldquo;Talk to me, Walter; it
  prevents my listening to the flapping and plunging of the boat, and all the
  other noises. Walter, I think... I think we shall die.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Courage, brother, I have hope yet; and if we die we will die like
  this together&mdash;I will not let you go. Our bodies shall be washed ashore
  together&mdash;not separated, Charlie, even in death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have been a dear, dear good brother to me. How I love you,
  Walter!&rdquo; and as he pressed yet closer to him, he said more bravely,
  &ldquo;What hope have you then, Walter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look up, Charlie; you see that light?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; what is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sharksfin Lighthouse; don&rsquo;t you remember seeing it sometimes
  at night from Saint Win&rsquo;s? Yes; and those lights twinkling far-off are
  Saint Win&rsquo;s. Those must be the school lights; and those long windows
  you can just see are the chapel windows. They are in chapel now, or the
  lights wouldn&rsquo;t be there. Perhaps some of our friends&mdash;Power,
  perhaps, and Eden&mdash;are praying for us; they must have missed us since
  tea-time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How I wish we were with them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps we may be again; and all the wiser and better in heart and
  life for this solemn time, Charlie. If we are but carried by this wind and
  current within hearing of the lighthouse!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Sharksfin Lighthouse is built on a sharp high rock two miles out at
  sea. I have watched it from Bleak Point on a bright, warm summer&rsquo;s day,
  when the promontory around me was all ablaze with purple heather and golden
  gorse, and there was not breeze enough to shake the wing of the butterfly as
  it rested on the blue-bell, or disturb the honey-laden bee as it murmured in
  the thyme. Yet even then the waters were seething and boiling in never-ended
  tumult about those hideous sunken rocks; and the ocean all around was hoary
  as with the neesings of a thousand leviathans floundering in its monstrous
  depths. You may guess what they are on a wild February night&mdash;how, in
  the mighty rush of the Atlantic, the torn breakers beat about them with
  tremendous rage, till the whole sea is in angry motion like some demon
  caldron that seethes over roaring flame.</p>

  <p>Drifting along, or rather flung and battered about on the current, they
  passed within near sight of the lighthouse, and they might have thanked God
  that they passed no nearer, for to have passed nearer would have been certain
  death. The white waves dashed over it, enveloped its tall strong pillar that
  buffeted them back, like a noble will in the midst of calumny and
  persecution; <i>they</i> fell back hissing and discomfited, and could not dim
  its silver or quench its flame but <i>it</i> glowed on with steady lustre in
  the midst of them&mdash;flung its victorious path of splendour over their
  raging motion, warned from the sunken reef the weary mariner, and looked
  forth untroubled with its broad, calm eye into the madness and fury of the
  tempest-haunted night.</p>

  <p>Through this broad track of light the boat was driven, and Walter shouted
  at the top of his voice with all his remaining strength. The three men in the
  lighthouse fancied indeed, as they acknowledged afterwards, that they had
  heard some shouts; but strange, mysterious, inarticulate voices are often
  borne upon the wind, and haunt always the lonely wastes of foamy sea. The
  lighthouse men had often heard these unexplained wailings and weird screams.
  Many a time they had looked out, and been so continually deceived, that
  unless human accents were unmistakable and well-defined, they attribute these
  sounds to other agencies, or to the secret phenomena of the worst storms. And
  even if they <i>had</i> heard, what could they have done, or how have
  launched their boat when the billows were running mountain-high about their
  perilous rock?</p>

  <p>Charlie had been quiet for a long time, his face hidden on Walter&rsquo;s
  shoulder; but he had seen the glare which the light threw across the waves,
  and had observed that they had gradually been driven through it into the
  blackness again, and he asked, &ldquo;Have we passed the lighthouse,
  Walter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so hungry and burning with thirst! Oh! what shall we
  do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Try not to think about it, Charlie; a little fasting won&rsquo;t
  hurt us much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Another long pause, during which they clung more closely to each other,
  and their hearts beat side by side, and then Charlie said, in a barely
  articulate whisper&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walter!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know what you are going to say, Charlie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The water in the boat is nearly up to my knees.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We have shipped a great deal, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; and besides that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is true; there is a leak. Do you mind my putting you down
  and trying what I can do to bail the water out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Walter, don&rsquo;t put me off your knee&mdash;don&rsquo;t let go
  of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Charlie; it wouldn&rsquo;t be of much use.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried the little boy in a paroxysm of agony,
  &ldquo;we are sinking&mdash;we are foundering!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They wound their arms round each other, and Walter said, &ldquo;It is even
  so, my darling brother. Death is near, but God is with us; and if it is
  death, then death means rest and heaven. Good-bye, Charlie, good-bye; we will
  be close together till the end.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XL. &mdash; WHAT THE SEA GAVE UP</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <i>The sands and yeasty surges mix<br>
    At midnight in a dreary bay;&mdash;<br>
    And on thy ribs the limpet sticks,<br>
    And o&rsquo;er thy bones the scrawl shall play.</i><br>
    &mdash;Tennyson.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="first">ANXIETY reigned at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s, succeeded by
  consternation and intense grief. Little was thought of the absence of the
  three boys at tea-time, but when it came to chapel-time and bed-time, and
  they had not yet appeared, and when next morning it was found that they had
  not been heard of during the night, everyone became seriously alarmed, and
  all the neighbouring country was searched for intelligence.</p>

  <p>The place on the cliff where Kenrick had descended was observed, but as
  the traces showed that only <i>one</i> boy had gone down there, the
  discovery, so far from explaining matters, only rendered them more
  inexplicable. Additional light was thrown on the subject by the disappearance
  of Bryce&rsquo;s boat, and the worst fears seemed to be confirmed by his
  information that it was a ricketty old concern, only intended to paddle in
  smooth weather close to the shore. But what earthly reason could have induced
  three boys to venture out in such a tub on so wild a night? That they did it
  for pleasure was inconceivable, the more so as rowing was strictly forbidden;
  and as no other reason could be suggested, all conjecture was at fault.</p>

  <p>The fishermen went out in their smacks, but found no traces, and gained no
  tidings of the missing boys; and all through that weary and anxious day the
  belief that they had been lost at sea gained ground. Almost all day Power,
  and Eden, and Henderson, had been gazing out to sea, or wandering on the
  shore, in the vain hope of seeing them come rowing across the bay; but all
  the sailors on the shore affirmed that if they <i>had</i> gone out in an open
  boat, and particularly in Bryce&rsquo;s boat, it was an utter impossibility
  that they could have outlived the tempest of the preceding night.</p>

  <p>At last, towards the evening, the sea gave up, not indeed her dead, but
  what was accepted as a positive proof of their wretched fate. Henderson, who
  was in a fever of excitement, which Power vainly strove to allay, was walking
  with him and Eden, who was hardly less troubled, along the beach, when he
  caught sight of something floating along, rising and falling on the dumb
  sullen swell of the advancing tide. He thought and declared at first, with a
  start of horror, that it was the light hair of a drowned boy; but they very
  soon saw that it could not be that, and dashing in waist-deep after it,
  Henderson brought out <i>the torn and battered fragments of a straw hat</i>.
  The ribbon, of dark blue and white, though soaked and discoloured, still
  served to identify it as having belonged to a Saint Winifred&rsquo;s boy;
  and, carefully examining the flannel lining, they saw on a piece of linen
  sewn upon it&mdash;only too legible still&mdash;the name &ldquo;H.
  Kenrick.&rdquo; Nor was this all they found. The discovery had quickened
  their search, and soon afterwards Power, with a sudden suppressed cry,
  pointed to something black, lying, with a dreadful look about it, at a far
  part of the sand. Again their hearts grew cold, and running up to it they all
  recognised, with fresh horror and despair, <i>the coat which Walter had last
  worn</i>. They recognised it, but besides this, to place the matter beyond a
  doubt, his name was marked on the inside of the sleeve. In one of the pockets
  was his school notebook, with all the notes he had taken, and the playful
  caricatures which here and there he had scribbled over the pages; and in the
  other, stained with the salt water, and tearing at every touch, were the
  letters he had last received.</p>

  <p>All the next day the doubt was growing into certainty. Mr and Mrs Evson
  were summoned from Semlyn, and came with feelings that cannot be depicted.
  Power gave to Mrs Evson the coat he had picked up, and he and Henderson
  hardly ever left the parents of their friend, doing all they could to cheer
  their spirits and support in them the hopes they could hardly feel
  themselves. To this day Mrs Evson cherishes that coat as a dear and sacred
  relic, which reminds her of the mercy which sustained her during the first
  great agony which she had endured in her happy life. Power kept poor
  Kenrick&rsquo;s hat, for no relation of his was there to claim it.</p>

  <p>Another day dawned, and settled grief and gloom fell on all alike at Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s&mdash;the boys, the masters, the inhabitants. The sight of
  Mr and Mrs Evson&rsquo;s speechless anguish impressed all hearts, and by this
  time hope seemed quenched for ever. For now one boy only,&mdash;though young
  hearts are slow to give up hope&mdash;had refused to believe the worst. It
  was Eden. He <i>persisted</i> that the three boys must have been picked up.
  The belief had come upon him suddenly, and grown upon him he knew not how,
  but he was <i>sure</i> of it; and therefore his society brought most relief
  and comfort to the torn heart of the mother. &ldquo;What made him so
  confident?&rdquo; she asked. He did not know; he had seen it, or dreamt it,
  or <i>felt</i> it somehow, only he felt unalterably convinced that so it was.
  &ldquo;They will come back, dear Mrs Evson, they will come back, you will
  see,&rdquo; was his repeated asseveration; and oppressed as her heart was
  with doubt and fear, she was never weary of those words.</p>

  <p>And on the fourth day, while Mr Evson was absent, having gone to make
  enquiries in London of all the ships which had passed by Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s on that day, Eden, radiant with joy, rushed into Dr
  Lane&rsquo;s drawing-room, where Mrs Evson was sitting, and utterly
  regardless of <i>les convenances</i>, burst out with the exclamation,
  &ldquo;O Mrs Evson, it is true, it is true what I always told you.
  Didn&rsquo;t I say that I knew it? They <i>have</i> been picked
  up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, my boy; steady,&rdquo; whispered Mrs Lane; &ldquo;you should
  have delivered the message less suddenly. The revulsion of feeling from
  sorrow to joy will be too much for her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;O Eden, tell me,&rdquo; said the mother faintly, recalling her
  senses bewildered by the shock of intelligence; &ldquo;are you certain? Oh,
  where are my boys?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will see them soon,&rdquo; he said very gently; and the next
  moment, to confirm his words, the door again new open, and Charlie Evson was
  wrapped in his mother&rsquo;s arms, and strained to her heart, and covered
  with her kisses, and his bright young face bathed in her tears of gratitude
  and joy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Charlie, darling Charlie, where is Walter?&rdquo; were her first
  words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, don&rsquo;t you know me then, mother; and have you no kiss to
  spare for me?&rdquo; said the playful voice of a boy enveloped in a
  sailor&rsquo;s blue shell-jacket; and then it was Walter&rsquo;s turn to feel
  in that long embrace what is the agonising fondness of a mother&rsquo;s
  love.</p>

  <p>Kenrick was looking on a little sadly&mdash;not envious, but made
  sorrowful by memory. But the next moment Walter, taking him by the hand, had
  introduced him to his mother and she kissed him too on the cheek. &ldquo;Your
  name is so familiar to me, Kenrick,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and you have
  shared their dangers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Walter has twice saved my life, Mrs Evson,&rdquo; he answered,
  &ldquo;and this time, I trust, he has saved it in more senses than
  one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boys&rsquo; story was soon told. Just as their boat was beginning to
  sink, and the bitterness of death seemed over, Walter caught sight of the
  lights of a ship, and saw her huge dark outline looming not far from them,
  and towering above the waves. Instantly he and Charlie had shouted with all
  the frantic energy of reviving hope. By God&rsquo;s mercy their shouts had
  been heard; in spite of the risk and difficulty caused by the turbulence of
  the night, the ship hove to, the long-boat was manned, and the amazed sailors
  had rescued them not ten minutes before their wretched boat swirled round and
  sank to the bottom.</p>

  <p>Nothing could exceed the care and tenderness with which the sailors and
  the good captain of the <i>Morning Star</i> had treated them. The genial
  warmth of the captain&rsquo;s cabin, the food and wine of which they stood so
  much in need, the rest and quiet, and a long, long sleep, continued for
  nearly twenty-four hours, had recruited their failing strength, and restored
  them to perfect health. Past Saint Winifred&rsquo;s Bay extends for miles and
  miles a long range of iron-bound coast, and this circumstance, together with
  the violence of the breeze blowing away from land, had prevented the captain
  from having any opportunity of putting them ashore until the morning of this
  day, when, with kind-hearted liberality, he had also supplied them with the
  money requisite to pay their way to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think how jolly it was on board, mother,&rdquo;
  said Charlie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learnt all about ships, and it was such fun;
  and they were all as kind to us as possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t suppose we didn&rsquo;t think of you, mother
  dearest,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;and how anxious you would be; but we felt
  sure you would believe that some ship had picked us up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter; and to taste this joy is worth any past sorrow,&rdquo;
  said his mother. &ldquo;You must thank your friend Eden for mainly keeping up
  my spirits, for he was almost the only person who maintained that you were
  still alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now, Mrs Evson,&rdquo; said Power, &ldquo;you must spare them
  for ten minutes, for the masters and all the school are impatient to see and
  congratulate them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The whole story had spread among the boys in ten minutes, and they were
  again proud to recognise Walter&rsquo;s chivalrous daring. When he appeared
  in the blue jacket with which Captain Peters had replaced the loss of his
  coat, with Kenrick&rsquo;s arm in his, and holding Charlie&rsquo;s hand,
  cheer after cheer broke from the assembled boys; and finally, unable to
  repress their joy and enthusiasm, they lifted the three on their shoulders
  and chaired them all round the court.</p>

  <p>You may suppose that it was a joyful dinner party that evening at Dr
  Lane&rsquo;s. Mr Evson, as they had conjectured, had heard of his son&rsquo;s
  safety in London from the captain of the <i>Morning Star</i>, to whom he had
  tendered his warmest and most grateful thanks, and to whom, before leaving
  London, he had presented, in testimony of his gratitude, an exquisite
  chronometer. Returning to Saint Winifred&rsquo;s he found his two boys seated
  happily in the drawing-room awaiting him, each with their mother&rsquo;s hand
  in theirs, and in the company of their best boy-friends. Walter was still in
  the blue shell-jacket, which became him well, and which neither Mrs Lane nor
  the boys would suffer him to change. It was indeed an evening never to be
  forgotten, and hardly less joyous and memorable was the grand breakfast which
  the Sixth gave to Walter and Kenrick in memory of the event, and to which, by
  special exception, little Charlie was also invited.</p>

  <p>Rejoicings are good, but they were saved for greater and better things.
  These three young boys had stood face to face with sudden death. Death, as it
  were, had laid his hand on their shoulders, had taken them by the hair and
  looked upon them, and bade them commune with themselves; and, when he
  released them from that stern cold grasp, it gave to their lives an awful
  reality. It did not quench, indeed, their natural mirthfulness, but it filled
  them with strong purposes and high thoughts. Kenrick returned to Saint
  Winifred&rsquo;s a changed boy; long-continued terror had quite altered the
  expression of his countenance, but, while this effect soon wore off, the
  <i>moral</i> effects produced in him were happily permanent. He began a life
  in earnest; for him there was no more listlessness, or moody fits of sorrow,
  or bursts of wayward self-indulgence. He became strenuous, diligent, modest,
  earnest, kind; he too, like Walter and Charlie, began his career
  &ldquo;<i>from strength to strength</i>.&rdquo; Under him, and Power, and
  Walter, and others, whom their influence had formed or who had been moulded
  by the tradition they had left behind them, Saint Winifred&rsquo;s flourished
  more and more, and added new honours and benefits to its old and famous name.
  At the end of that half-year Power left, but not until he had won the Balliol
  Scholarship and carried off nearly all the prizes in the school. Walter
  succeeded him as head of the school; and he and Kenrick (who was restored to
  his old place on the list) worked heart and soul together for the good of it.
  In those days it was indeed in a happy and prosperous state&mdash;renowned
  and honoured without, well governed and high toned within. Dr Lane felt and
  acknowledged that much of this success was due to the example and to the
  vigour of these head boys. Power, when he left, was beloved and
  distinguished; Walter and Kenrick trod in his steps. To the boundless delight
  of the school they too carried off in one year the highest open scholarship
  at each University; and when they also left, they had been as successful as
  Power, and were, if possible, even more universally beloved. Whalley carried
  on for another year the high tradition, and, in due time, little Charlie also
  attained the head place in the school, and so behaved as to identify his name
  and Walter&rsquo;s with some of its happiest and wisest institutions for many
  years.</p>

  <p class="first">MAY I not leave them here? Where could I leave them better
  than on this marble threshold of a promising boyhood; still happy and noble
  in the freshness of their feelings, the brightness of their hopes, the
  enthusiasm of their thoughts? Need I say a word of after-life, with the
  fading of its earlier visions, and the coldness and hardness of its ways? I
  should like to linger with them here; to shake hands here in farewell, and
  leave them as the boys I knew. They are living still, and are happy and
  highly honoured in the world. In their case &ldquo;the boy has been father to
  the man;&rdquo; and the reader who has understood and sympathised with them
  in their early life will not ask me to draw aside the curtain, even for a
  moment, to show them as they appeared when a few more summers had seen them
  grow to the full stature of their manhood.</p>

  <p>I said that they were living still; but it is not so with all of them.</p>

  <p>Charlie Evson alone, of the little band who have been amongst the number
  of our friends at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s&mdash;alone, though the youngest of
  them all&mdash;is now dead. He died a violent death. Filled with a missionary
  spirit, and desirous, like Edward Irving, of &ldquo;something more high and
  heroical in religion than this age affecteth,&rdquo; he joined a mission to
  one of the great groups of Pacific Islands. And there, many a time, in the
  evening, after a day spent in teaching the natives how to plant their fields
  and build their houses, he would gather them round him in the twilight, and,
  while the cool wind wandered over his hair and brow, and shook overhead the
  graceful plumes of the cocoa-palm, he would talk to them in low sweet tones,
  until the fireflies were twinkling in the thicket and the stars stole out one
  after another in their silent myriads, of One Who came from the highest
  Heaven to redeem them from savagery and degradation, and to make them holy as
  He was holy, and pure as He was pure. He was eminently successful; but when
  he had planted in some islands the first seeds of a fruitful Christianity, he
  sailed to other reefs, still carrying the everlasting gospel in his hands.
  One evening as the little missionary ship, which Charlie himself had built,
  drew near the land, they saw that the natives were drawn up in a threatening
  attitude on the beach. Trusting to conciliate them by kindness and by
  presents, the young missionary, taking with him a few glittering trifles to
  attract their notice, proceeded with a small band of followers towards the
  shore. At first the natives seemed inclined to receive them well, but
  suddenly, by the wild impulse to which barbarians are so liable, one of the
  savages pierced a sailor with his spear. Evson, by an effort of strength,
  wrenched the weapon out of his hand and told his men to take up the wounded
  sailor and retreat. This they effected in safety, for the islanders were
  struck and awed by the young Englishman&rsquo;s high bearing and firm
  attitude; and his eye fixed quietly upon them kept them back. He was himself
  the last to step into the boat, and, as he turned to do so, one of the
  wretches struck him on the head with his accursed club. He fell stunned and
  bleeding upon the beach, and in an instant was dispatched by the spears and
  clubs of a hundred savages, while the boat&rsquo;s crew barely escaped with
  their lives, and the little mission vessel, spreading all her sails, could
  with difficulty elude the pursuit of the canoes, which swarmed out of the
  creeks to give her chase. The corpse lay bleeding upon a nameless strand, and
  the soft fair hair that a mother&rsquo;s hand had fondled and a
  mother&rsquo;s lips had kissed, dangled as a trophy at the girdle of a
  cannibal. Thus it was that Charlie died; and a marble tablet in Semlyn
  Church, ornamented with the most delicate and exquisite sculpture, records
  his tragic fate, and stands as a monument of his parents&rsquo; tender love.
  As a boy he had shown a martyr&rsquo;s dauntless spirit; as a man he was
  suffered to win the rare and high glory of a martyr&rsquo;s crown.</p>

  <p>Of Walter, and Henderson, and Sir Reginald Power&mdash;for Power has
  succeeded only too early to his father&rsquo;s title and estates&mdash;I need
  say no more. Their days from youth to maturity were linked together by a
  natural progress in all things charitable, and great, and good. They did not
  belie their early promise. The breeze of a happy life bore them gently
  onward, and they cast no anchor in its widening stream. They were brave and
  manly and honourable boys, and they grew up into high-minded and honourable
  men.</p>

  <p>I do not wish you to suppose that they had not their own bitter trials to
  suffer, or that they were exempt in any degree from our common sorrows. In
  that turbulent and restless period of life when the passions are strong and
  the heart wild and wilful and full of pride, while, at the same time, the
  judgment is often weak and the thoughts are immature and crude, they had (as
  we all have) to purchase wholesome experience at the price of suffering; to
  remember with shame some follies, and mourn over some mistakes. In saying
  this, I only say that they were not faultless; which of us is? But, at the
  same time, I may fairly say that we do not often meet with nobler or manlier
  boys and youths than these; that the errors which they committed they humbly
  endeavoured by patience and carefulness to amend; that they used their
  talents well and wisely, striving to live in love and charity with all around
  them; that above all they kept the fear of God before their eyes and never
  lost the freshness and geniality of early years, but kept &ldquo;The young
  lamb&rsquo;s heart amid the fall grown flocks;&rdquo;&mdash;kept the heart of
  boyhood taken up and purified in the powers of manhood. And this is the
  reason why the eye that sees them loves them, and the tongue that speaks of
  them blesses them. And when the end comes to them which comes to all;
  when&mdash;as though a child should trample out the sparks from a piece of
  paper&mdash;death comes upon them and tramples out for ever their joys and
  sorrows, their hopes and fears&mdash;then, sure I am, that those who mourn
  for them, that those who cherish their memory and regret their loss, will
  neither be insincere nor few, and that they themselves will meet calmly and
  gladly that Great Shadow, waiting and looking with sure though humble hope to
  a better and less transient life; to a sinless and unstained world; to the
  meeting with long lost friends; to the rest which remaineth for the People of
  God.</p>

  <p>And here, gentle reader, let us bid them all farewell.</p>
