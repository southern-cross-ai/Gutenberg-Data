  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">1. THE WORLD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Hull Tarvish looked backward but once, and that only as he
  reached the elbow of the road. The sprawling little stone cottage that had
  been home was visible as he had seen it a thousand times, framed under the
  cedars. His mother still watched him, and two of his younger brothers stood
  staring down the Mountainside at him. He raised his hand in farewell, then
  dropped it as he realized that none of them saw him now; his mother had
  turned indifferently to the door, and the two youngsters had spied a rabbit.
  He faced about and strode away, down the slope out of Ozarky.</p>

  <p>He passed the place where the great steel road of the Ancients had been,
  now only two rusty streaks and a row of decayed logs. Beside it was the mossy
  heap of stones that had been an ancient structure in the days before the Dark
  Centuries, when Ozarky had been a part of the old state of M'souri. The
  mountain people still sought out the place for squared stones to use in
  building, but the tough metal of the steel road itself was too stubborn for
  their use, and the rails had rusted quietly these three hundred years.</p>

  <p>That much Hull Tarvish knew, for they were things still spoken of at night
  around the fireplace. They had been mighty sorcerers, those Ancients; their
  steel roads went everywhere, and everywhere were the ruins of their towns,
  built, it was said, by a magic that lifted weights. Down in the valley, he
  knew, men were still seeking that magic; once a rider had stayed by night at
  the Tarvish home, a little man who said that in the far south the secret had
  been found, but nobody ever heard any more of it.</p>

  <p>So Hull whistled to himself, shifted the rag bag on his shoulder, set his
  bow more comfortably on his mighty back, and trudged on. That was why he
  himself was seeking the valley; he wanted to see what the world was like. He
  had been always a restless sort, not at all like the other six Tarvish sons,
  nor like the three Tarvish daughters. They were true mountainies, the sons
  great hunters, and the daughters stolid and industrious. Not Hull, however;
  he was neither lazy like his brothers nor stolid like his sisters, but
  restless, curious, dreamy. So he whistled his way into the world, and was
  happy.</p>

  <p>At evening he stopped at the Hobel cottage on the edge of the mountains.
  Away before him stretched the plain, and in the darkening distance was
  visible the church spire of Norse. That was a village; Hull had never seen a
  village, or no more of it than this same distant steeple, shaped like a
  straight white pine. But he had heard all about Norse, because the
  mountainies occasionally went down there to buy powder and ball for their
  rifles, those of them who had rifles.</p>

  <p>Hull had only a bow. He didn't see the use of guns; powder and ball cost
  money, but an arrow did the same work for nothing, and that without scaring
  all the game a mile away.</p>

  <p>Morning he bade goodbye to the Hobels, who thought him, as they always
  had, a little crazy, and set off. His powerful, brown bare legs flashed under
  his ragged trousers, his bare feet made a pleasant swoosh in the dust of the
  road, the June sun beat warm on his right cheek. He was happy; there never
  was a pleasanter world than this, so he grinned and whistled, and spat
  carefully into the dust, remembering that it was bad luck to spit toward the
  sun. He was bound for adventure.</p>

  <p>Adventure came. Hull had come down to the plain now, where the trees were
  taller than the scrub of the hill country, and where the occasional farms
  were broader, well tilled, more prosperous. The trail had become a wagon
  road, and here it cut and angled between two lines of forest. And
  unexpectedly a man&mdash;no, two men&mdash;rose from a log at the roadside
  and approached Hull. He watched them; one was tall and light-haired as
  himself, but without his mighty frame, and the other was a head shorter, and
  dark. Valley people, surely, for the dark one had a stubby pistol at his
  belt, wooden-stocked like those of the Ancients, and the tall man's bow was
  of glittering spring steel.</p>

  <p>"Ho, mountainy!" said the dark one. "Where going?"</p>

  <p>"Norse," answered Hull shortly,</p>

  <p>"What's in the bag?"</p>

  <p>"My tongue," snapped the youth.</p>

  <p>"Easy, there," grunted the light man. "No offense, mountainy. We're just
  curious. That's a good knife you got. I'll trade it."</p>

  <p>"For what?"</p>

  <p>"For lead in your craw," growled the dark one. Suddenly the blunt pistol
  was in his hand. "Pass it over, and the bag too."</p>

  <p>Hull scowled from one to the other. At last he shrugged, and moved as if
  to lift his bag from his shoulders. And then, swift as the thrust of a
  striking diamondback, his left foot shot forward, catching the dark one
  squarely in the pit of his stomach, with the might of Hull's muscles and
  weight behind it.</p>

  <p>The man had breath for a low grunt; he doubled and fell, while his weapon
  spun a dozen feet away into the dust. The light one sprang for it, but Hull
  caught him with a great arm about his throat, wrenched twice, and the brief
  fight was over. He swung placidly on toward Norse with a blunt revolver
  primed and capped at his hip, a glistening spring-steel bow on his shoulder,
  and twenty-two bright tubular steel arrows in his quiver.</p>

  <p>He topped a little rise and the town lay before him. He stared. A hundred
  houses at least. Must be five hundred people in the town, more people than
  he'd ever seen in his life all together. He strode eagerly on, goggling at
  the church that towered high as a tall tree, at the windows of bits of glass
  salvaged from ancient ruins and carefully pieced together, at the tavern with
  its swinging emblem of an unbelievably fat man holding a mammoth mug. He
  stared at the houses, some of them with shops before them, and at the people,
  most of them shod in leather.</p>

  <p>He himself attracted little attention. Norse was used to the mountainies,
  and only a girl or two turned appraising eyes toward his mighty figure. That
  made him uncomfortable, however; the girls of the mountains giggled and
  blushed, but never at that age did they stare at a man. So he gazed defiantly
  back, letting his eyes wander from their bonnets to the billowing skirts
  above their leather strap-sandals, and they laughed and passed on.</p>

  <p>Hull didn't care for Norse, he decided. As the sun set, the houses loomed
  too close, as if they'd stifle him, so he set out into the countryside to
  sleep. The remains of an ancient town bordered the village, with its spectral
  walls crumbling against the west. There were ghosts there, of course, so he
  walked farther, found a wooded spot, and lay down, putting his bow and the
  steel arrows into his bag against the rusting effect of night-dew. Then he
  tied the bag about his bare feet and legs, sprawled comfortably, and slept
  with his hand on the pistol grip. Of course there were no animals to fear in
  these woods save wolves, and they never attacked humans during the warm parts
  of the year, but there were men, and they bound themselves by no such
  seasonal laws.</p>

  <p>He awoke dewy wet. The sun shot golden lances through the trees, and he
  was ravenously hungry. He ate the last of his mother's brown bread from his
  bag, now crumbled by his feet, and then strode out to the road. There was a
  wagon creaking there, plodding northward; the bearded, kindly man in it was
  glad enough to have him ride for company.</p>

  <p>"Mountainy?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes.</p>

  <p>"Bound where?"</p>

  <p>"The world," said Bull.</p>

  <p>"Well," observed the other, "it's a big place, and all I've seen of it
  much like this. All except Selui. That's a city. Yes, that's a city. Been
  there?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"It's got," said the farmer impressively, "twenty thousand people in it.
  Maybe more. And they got ruins there the biggest you ever saw. Bridges.
  Buildings. Four&mdash;five times as high as the Norse church, and at that
  they're fallen down. The Devil knows how high they used to be in the old
  days."</p>

  <p>"Who lived in 'em?" asked Hull.</p>

  <p>"Don't know. Who'd want to live so high up it'd take a full morning to
  climb there? Unless it was magic. I don't hold much with magic, but they do
  say the Old People knew how to fly."</p>

  <p>Hull tried to imagine this. For a while there was silence save for the
  slow clump of the horses' hooves. "I don't believe it," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Nor I. But did you hear what they're saying in Norse?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't hear anything."</p>

  <p>"They say," said the farmer, "that Joaquin Smith is going to march
  again."</p>

  <p>"Joaquin Smith!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah. Even the mountainies know about him, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Who doesn't?" returned Hull. "Then there'll be fighting in the south, I
  guess. I have a notion to go south."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I like fighting," said Hull simply.</p>

  <p>"Fair answer," said the farmer, "but from what folks say, there's not much
  fighting when the Master marches. He has a spell; there's great sorcery in
  N'Orleans, from the merest warlock up to Martin Sair, who's blood-son of the
  Devil himself, or so they say."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see his sorcery against the mountainy's arrow and ball," said
  Hull grimly. "There's none of us can't spot either eye at a thousand paces,
  using rifle. Or two hundred with arrow."</p>

  <p>"No doubt; but what if powder flames, and guns fire themselves before he's
  even across the horizon? They say he has a spell for that, he or Black
  Margot."</p>

  <p>"Black Margot?"</p>

  <p>"The Princess, his half-sister. The dark witch who rides beside him, the
  Princess Margaret."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;but why Black Margot?"</p>

  <p>The farmer shrugged. "Who knows? It's what her enemies call her."</p>

  <p>"Then so I call her," said Hull.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know," said the other. "It makes small difference to me
  whether I pay taxes to N'Orleans or to gruff old Marcus Ormiston, who's
  eldarch of Ormiston village there." He flicked his whip toward the distance
  ahead, where Hull now descried houses and the flash of a little river. "I've
  sold produce in towns within the Empire, and the people of them seemed as
  happy as ourselves, no more, no less."</p>

  <p>"There is a difference, though. It's freedom."</p>

  <p>"Merely a word, my friend. They plow, they sow, they reap, just as we do.
  They hunt, they fish, they fight. And as for freedom, are they less free with
  a warlock to rule them than I with a wizened fool?"</p>

  <p>"The mountainies pay taxes to no one."</p>

  <p>"And no one builds them roads, nor digs them public wells. Where you pay
  little you get less, and I will say that the roads within the Empire are
  better than ours."</p>

  <p>"Better than this?" asked Hull, staring at the dusty width of the
  highway.</p>

  <p>"Far better. Near Memphis town is a road of solid rock, which they spread
  soft through some magic, and let harden, so there is neither mud nor
  dust."</p>

  <p>Hull mused over this. "The Master," he burst out suddenly, "is he really
  immortal?"</p>

  <p>The other shrugged. "How can I say? There are great sorcerers in the
  southlands, and the greatest of them is Martin Sair. But I do know this, that
  I have seen sixty-two years, and as far back as memory goes here was always
  Joaquin Smith in the south, and always an Empire gobbling cities as a hare
  gobbles carrots. When I was young it was far away, now it reaches close at
  hand; that is all the difference. Men talked of the beauty of Black Margot
  then as they do now, and of the wizardry of Martin Sair.</p>

  <p>Hull made no answer, for Ormiston was at hand. The village was much like
  Norse save that it huddled among low hills, on the crest of some of which
  loomed ancient ruins. At the near side his companion halted, and Hull thanked
  him as he leaped to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Where to?" asked the farmer.</p>

  <p>Hull thought a moment. "Selui," he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a hundred miles, but there'll be many to ride you."</p>

  <p>"I have my own feet," said the youth. He spun suddenly about at a voice
  across the road: "Hi! Mountainy!"</p>

  <p>It was a girl. A very pretty girl, slim waisted, copper haired, blue eyed,
  standing at the gate before a large stone house. "Hi!" she called. "Will you
  work for your dinner?"</p>

  <p>Hull was ravenous again. "Gladly!" he cried.</p>

  <p>The voice of the farmer sounded behind him. "It's Vail Ormiston, the
  dotard eldarch's daughter. Hold her for a full meal, mountainy. My taxes are
  paying for it."</p>

  <p>But Vail Ormiston was above much converse with a wandering mountain-man.
  She surveyed his mighty form approvingly, showed him the logs he was to
  quarter, and then disappeared into the house. If, perchance, she peeped out
  through the clearest of the ancient glass fragments that formed the window,
  and if she watched the flexing muscles of his great bare arms as he swung the
  axe&mdash;well, he was unaware of it.</p>

  <p>So it happened that afternoon found him trudging toward Selui with a
  hearty meal inside him and three silver dimes in his pocket, ancient money,
  with the striding figure of the woman all but worn away. He was richer than
  when he had set out by those coins, by the blunt pistol at his hip, by the
  shiny steel bow and arrows, and by the memory of the copper hair and blue
  eyes of Vail Ormiston.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">2. OLD EINAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Three weeks in Selui had served to give Hull Tarvish a sort
  of speaking acquaintance with the place. He no longer gaped at the
  sky-piercing ruins of the ancient city, or the vast fallen bridges, and he
  was quite at home in the town that lay beside it. He had found work easily
  enough in a baker's establishment, where his great muscles served well; the
  hours were long, but his pay was munificent&mdash;five silver quarters a
  week. He paid two for lodging, and food&mdash;what he needed beyond the burnt
  loaves at hand from his employment cost him another quarter, but that left
  two to put by. He never gambled other than a wager now and then on his own
  marksmanship, and that was more profitable than otherwise.</p>

  <p>Ordinarily Hull was quick to make friends, but his long hours hindered
  him. He had but one, an incredibly old man who sat at evening on the step
  beyond his lodging, Old Einar. So this evening Hull wandered out as usual to
  join him, staring at the crumbling towers of the Ancients glowing in the
  sunset. Trees sprung on many, and all were green with vine and tussock and
  the growth of wind-carried seeds. No one dared build among the ruins, for
  none could guess when a great tower might come crashing down.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said to Old Einar, "what the Ancients were like. Were they
  men like us? Then how could they fly?"</p>

  <p>"They were men like us, Hull. As for flying&mdash;well, it's my belief
  that flying is a legend. See here; there was a man supposed to have flown
  over the cold lands to the north and those to the south, and also across the
  great sea. But this flying man is called in some accounts Lindbird and in
  others Bird and surely one can see the origin of such a legend. The
  migrations of birds, who cross land and seas each year, that is all."</p>

  <p>"Or perhaps magic," suggested Hull.</p>

  <p>"There is no magic. The Ancients themselves denied it and I have struggled
  through many a moldy book in a curious, archaic tongue."</p>

  <p>Old Einar was the first scholar Hull had ever encountered. Though there
  were many during the dawn of that brilliant age called the Second
  Enlightenment, most of them were still within the Empire. John Holland was
  dead, but Olin was yet alive in the world, and Kohlmar, and Jorgensen, and
  Teran, and Martin Sair, and Joaquin Smith the Master. Great names&mdash;the
  names of demigods.</p>

  <p>But Hull knew little of them. "You can read!" he exclaimed. "That in
  itself is a sort of magic. And you have been within the Empire, even in
  N'Orleans. Tell me, what is the Great City like? Have they really learned the
  secrets of the Ancients? Are the Immortals truly immortal? How did they gain
  their knowledge?"</p>

  <p>Old Einar settled himself on the step and puffed blue smoke from his pipe
  filled with the harsh tobacco of the region. "Too many questions breed
  answers to none," he observed. "Shall I tell you the true story of the world,
  Hull&mdash;the story called History?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. In Ozarky we spoke little of such things."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the old man comfortably, "I will begin then, at what to us is
  the beginning, but to the Ancients was the end. I do not know what factors,
  what wars, what struggles, led up to the mighty world that died during the
  Dark Centuries, but I do know that three hundred years ago the world reached
  its climax. You cannot imagine such a place, Hull. It was a time of vast
  cities, too&mdash;fifty times as large as N'Orleans with its hundred thousand
  people."</p>

  <p>He puffed slowly. "Great steel wagons roared over the iron roads of the
  Ancients. Men crossed the oceans to east and west. The cities were full of
  whirring wheels, and instead of the many little city-states of our time,
  there were giant nations with thousands of cities and a hundred million
  &mdash;a hundred and fifty million people."</p>

  <p>Hull stared. "I do not believe there are so many people in the world," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Old Einar shrugged. "Who knows?" he returned. "The ancient books&mdash;
  all too few&mdash;tell us that the world is round, and that beyond the seas
  lie one, or several continents, but what races are there today not even
  Joaquin Smith can say." He puffed smoke again. "Well, such was the ancient
  world. These were warlike nations, so fond of battle that they had to write
  many books about the horrors of war to keep themselves at peace, but they
  always failed. During the time they called their twentieth century there was
  a whole series of wars, not such little quarrels as we have so often between
  our city-states, nor even such as that between the Memphis League and the
  Empire, five years ago. Their wars spread like storm clouds around the world,
  and were fought between millions of men with unimaginable weapons that flung
  destruction a hundred miles, and with ships on the seas, and with gases."</p>

  <p>"What's gases?" asked Hull.</p>

  <p>Old Einar waved his hand so that the wind of it brushed the youth's brown
  cheek. "Air is a gas," he said. "They knew how to poison the air so that all
  who breathed it died. And they fought with diseases, and legend says that
  they fought also in the air with wings, but that is only legend."</p>

  <p>"Diseases!" said Hull. "Diseases are the breath of Devils, and if they
  controlled Devils they used sorcery, and therefore they knew magic."</p>

  <p>"There is no magic," reiterated the old man. "I do not know how they
  fought each other with diseases, but Martin Sair of N'Orleans knows. That was
  his study, not mine, but I know there was no magic in it." He resumed his
  tale. "So these great fierce nations flung themselves against each other, for
  war meant more to them than to us. With us it is something of a rough,
  joyous, dangerous game, but to them it was a passion. They fought for any
  reason, or for none at all save the love of fighting."</p>

  <p>"I love fighting," said Hull.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but would you love it if it meant simply the destroying of thousands
  of men beyond the horizon? Men you were never to see?"</p>

  <p>"No. War should be man to man, or at least no farther than the carry of a
  rifle ball."</p>

  <p>"True. Well, some time near the end of their twentieth century, the
  ancient world exploded into war like a powder horn in a fire. They say every
  nation fought, and battles surged back and forth across seas and continents.
  It was not only nation against nation, but race against race, black and white
  and yellow and red, all embroiled in a titanic struggle."</p>

  <p>"Yellow and red?" echoed Hull. "There are a few black men called Nigs in
  Ozarky, but I never heard of yellow or red men."</p>

  <p>"I have seen yellow men," said Old Einar. "There are some towns of yellow
  men on the edge of the western ocean, in the region called Friscia. The red
  race, they say, is gone, wiped out by the plague called the Grey Death, to
  which they yielded more readily than the other races."</p>

  <p>"I have heard of the Grey Death," said Hull. "When I was very young, there
  was an old, old man who used to say that his grand-father had lived in the
  days of the Death."</p>

  <p>Old Einar smiled. "I doubt it, Hull. It was something over two and a half
  centuries ago. However," he resumed, "the great ancient nations were at war,
  and as I say, they fought with diseases. Whether some nation learned the
  secret of the Grey Death, or whether it grew up as a sort of cross between
  two or more other diseases, I do not know. Martin Sair says that diseases are
  living things, so it may be so. At any rate, the Grey Death leaped suddenly
  across the world, striking alike at all people. Everywhere it blasted the
  armies, the cities, the countryside, and of those it struck, six out of every
  ten died. There must have been chaos in the world; we have not a single book
  printed during that time, and only legend tells the story.</p>

  <p>"But the war collapsed. Armies suddenly found themselves unopposed, and
  then were blasted before they could move. Ships in mid-ocean were stricken,
  and drifted unmanned to pile in wreckage, or to destroy others. In the cities
  the dead were piled in the streets, and after a while, were simply left where
  they fell, while those who survived fled away into the country. What remained
  of the armies became little better than roving robber bands, and by the third
  year of the plague there were few if any stable governments in the
  world."</p>

  <p>"What stopped it?" asked Hull.</p>

  <p>"I do not know. They end, these pestilences. Those who take it and live
  cannot take it a second time, and those who are somehow immune do not take it
  at all, and the rest&mdash;die. The Grey Death swept the world for three
  years; when it ended, according to Martin Sair, one person in four had died.
  But the plague came back in lessening waves for many years; only a pestilence
  in the Ancient's fourteenth century, called the Black Death, seems ever to
  have equaled it.</p>

  <p>"Yet its effects were only beginning. The ancient transport system had
  simply collapsed, and the cities were starving. Hungry gangs began raiding
  the countryside, and instead of one vast war there were now a million little
  battles. The weapons of the Ancients were everywhere, and these battles were
  fierce enough, in all truth, though nothing like the colossal encounters of
  the great war. Year by year the cities decayed until by the fiftieth year
  after the Grey Death, the world's population had fallen by three-fourths, and
  civilization was ended. It was barbarism now that ruled the world, but only
  barbarism, not savagery. People still remembered the mighty ancient
  civilization, and everywhere there were attempts to combine into the old
  nations, but these failed for lack of great leaders."</p>

  <p>"As they should fail," said Hull. "We have freedom now."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. By the first century after the Plague, there was little left of
  the Ancients save their ruined cities where lurked robber bands that scoured
  the country by night. They had little interest in anything save food or the
  coined money of the old nations, and they did incalculable damage. Few could
  read, and on cold nights was usual to raid the ancient libraries for books to
  burn and to make things worse, fire gutted the ruins of all cities, and there
  was no organized resistance to it. The flames simply burned themselves out,
  and priceless books vanished."</p>

  <p>"Yet in N'Orleans they study, don't they?" asked Hull.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm coming to that. About two centuries after the Plague&mdash;a
  hundred years ago, that is&mdash;the world had stabilized itself. It was much
  as it is here today, with little farming towns and vast stretches of deserted
  country. Gunpowder had been rediscovered, rifles were used, and most of the
  robber bands had been destroyed. And then, into the town of N'Orleans, built
  beside the ancient city, came young John Holland.</p>

  <p>"Holland was a rare specimen, anxious for learning. He found the remains
  of an ancient library and began slowly to decipher the archaic words in the
  few books that had survived. Little by little others joined him, and as the
  word spread slowly, men from other sections wandered in with books, and the
  Academy was born. No one taught, of course; it was just a group of studious
  men living a sort of communistic, monastic life. There was no attempt at
  practical use of the ancient knowledge until a youth named Teran had a dream
  &mdash;no less a dream than to recondition the centuries-old power machines
  of N'Orleans, to give the city the power that travels on wires!"</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Hull. "What's that, Old Einar?"</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't understand, Hull. Teran was an enthusiast; it didn't stop
  him to realize that there was no coal or oil to run his machines. He believed
  that when power was needed, it would be there, so he and his followers
  scrubbed and filed and welded away, and Teran was right. When he needed
  power, it was there.</p>

  <p>"This was the gift of a man named Olin, who had unearthed the last, the
  crowning secret of the Ancients, the power called atomic energy. He gave it
  to Teran, and N'Orleans became a miracle city where lights glowed and wheels
  turned. Men came from every part of the continent to see, and among these
  were two called Martin Sair and Joaquin Smith, come out of Mexico with the
  half-sister of Joaquin, the satanically beautiful being sometimes called
  Black Margot.</p>

  <p>"Martin Sair was a genius. He found his field in the study of medicine,
  and it was less than ten years before he had uncovered the secret of the hard
  rays. He was studying sterility but he found&mdash;immortality!"</p>

  <p>"Then the Immortals are immortal !" murmured Hull.</p>

  <p>"It may be, Hull. At least they do not seem to age, but&mdash;Well,
  Joaquin Smith was also a genius, but of a different sort. He dreamed of the
  re-uniting of the peoples of the country. I think he dreams of even more,
  Hull; people say he will stop when he rules a hundred cities, but I think he
  dreams of an American Empire, or"&mdash;Old Einar's voice dropped&mdash;"a
  world Empire. At least, he took Martin Sair's immortality and traded it for
  power. The Second Enlightenment was dawning and there was genius in
  N'Orleans. He traded immortality to Kohlmar for a weapon, he offered it to
  Olin for atomic power, but Olin was already past youth, and refused, partly
  because he didn't want it, and partly because he was not entirely in sympathy
  with Joaquin Smith. So the Master seized the secret of the atom despite Olin,
  and the Conquest began.</p>

  <p>"N'Orleans, directly under the influence of the Master's magnetic
  personality, was ready to yield, and yielded to him cheering. He raised his
  army and marched north, and everywhere cities fell or yielded willingly.
  Joaquin Smith is magnificent, and men flock to him, cities cheer him, even
  the wives and children of the slain swear allegiance when he forgives them in
  that noble manner of his. Only here and there men hate him bitterly, and
  speak such words as tyrant, and talk of freedom."</p>

  <p>"Such are the mountainies," said Hull.</p>

  <p>"Not even the mountainies can stand the ionic beams that Kohlmar dug out
  of ancient books, nor the Erden resonator that explodes gunpowder miles away.
  I think that Joaquin Smith will succeed, Hull. Moreover, I do not think it
  entirely bad that he should, for he is a great ruler, and a bringer of
  civilization."</p>

  <p>"What are they like, the Immortals?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Martin Sair is as cold as mountain rock, and the Princess Margaret
  is like black fire. Even my old bones feel younger only to look at her, and
  it is wise for young men not to look at her at all, because she is quite
  heartless, ruthless, and pitiless. As for Joaquin Smith, the Master&mdash;I
  do not know the words to describe so complex a character, and I know him
  well. He is mild, perhaps, but enormously strong, kind or cruel as suits his
  purpose, glitteringly intelligent, and dangerously charming."</p>

  <p>"You know him!" echoed Hull, and added curiously, "What is your other
  name, Old Einar, you who know the Immortals?"</p>

  <p>The old man smiled. "When I was born," he said, "my parents called me
  Einar Olin."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">3. THE MASTER MARCHES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Joaquin Smith was marching.</p>

  <p>Hull Tarvish leaned against the door of File Ormson's iron worker's shop
  in Ormiston, and stared across the fields and across the woodlands, and
  across to the blue mountains of Ozarky in the south. There is where he should
  have been, there with the mountainy men, but by the time the tired rider had
  brought the news to Selui, and by the time Hull had reached Ormiston, it was
  already too late, and Ozarky was but an outlying province of the expanding
  Empire, while the Master camped there above Norse, and sent representations
  to Selui.</p>

  <p>Selui wasn't going to yield. Already the towns of the three months old
  Selui Confederation were sending in their men, from Bloom'ton, from Cairo,
  even from distant Ch'cago on the shores of the saltless sea Mitchin. The men
  of the Confederation hated the little, slender, dark Ch'cagoans, for they had
  not yet forgotten the disastrous battle at Starved Rock, but any allies were
  welcome against Joaquin Smith. The Ch'cagoans were good enough fighters, too,
  and heart and soul in the cause, for if the Master took Selui, his Empire
  would reach dangerously close to the saltless seas, spreading from the ocean
  on the cast to the mountains on the west, and north as far as the great
  confluence of the M'sippi and M'souri.</p>

  <p>Hull knew there was fighting ahead, and he relished it. It was too bad
  that he couldn't have fought in Ozarky for his own people, but Ormiston would
  do. That was his home for the present, since he'd found work here with File
  Ormson, the squat iron-worker, broad-shouldered as Hull himself and a head
  shorter. Pleasant work for his mighty muscles, though at the moment there was
  nothing to do.</p>

  <p>He stared at the peaceful countryside. Joaquin Smith was marching, and
  beyond the village, the farmers were still working in their fields. Hull
  listened to the slow Sowing Song:</p>

  <p class="verse">"This is what the ground needs:<br>
  First the plow and then the seeds,<br>
  Then the harrow and then the hoe,<br>
  And rain to make the harvest grow.<br>
  <br>
  "This is what the man, needs:<br>
  First the promises, then the deeds,<br>
  Then the arrow and then the blade,<br>
  And last the digger with his black spade.<br>
  <br>
  "This is what his wife needs:<br>
  First a garden free of weeds,<br>
  Then the daughter, and their the son,<br>
  And a fireplace warm when the work is done.<br>
  <br>
  "This is what his son needs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hull ceased to listen. They were singing, but Joaquin Smith was marching,
  marching with the men of a hundred cities, with his black banner and its
  golden serpent fluttering. That serpent, Old Einar had said, was the Midgard
  Serpent, which ancient legend related had encircled the earth. It was the
  symbol of the Master's dream, and for a moment Hull had a stirring of
  sympathy for that dream.</p>

  <p>"No!" he growled to himself. "Freedom's better, and it's for us to blow
  the head from the Midgard Serpent."</p>

  <p>A voice sounded at his side. "Hull! Big Hull Tarvish! Are you too proud to
  notice humble folk?"</p>

  <p>It was Vail Ormiston, her violet eyes whimsical below her smooth copper
  hair. He flushed; he was not used to the ways of these valley girls, who
  flirted frankly and openly in a manner impossible to the shy girls of the
  mountains. Yet he&mdash;well, in a way, he liked it, and he liked Vail
  Ormiston, and he remembered pleasantly an evening two days ago when he had
  sat and talked a full three hours with her on the bench by the tree that
  shaded Ormiston well. And he remembered the walk through the fields when she
  had shown him the mouth of the great ancient storm sewer that had run under
  the dead city, and that still stretched crumbling for miles underground
  toward the hills, and he recalled her story of how, when a child, she had
  lost herself in it, so that her father had planted the tangle of blackberry
  bushes that still concealed the opening.</p>

  <p>He grinned, "Is it the eldarch's daughter speaking of humble folk? Your
  father will be taxing me double if he hears of this."</p>

  <p>She tossed her helmet of metallic hair. "He will if he sees you in that
  Selui finery of yours." Her eyes twinkled. "For whose eyes was it bought,
  Hull? For you'd be better saving your money."</p>

  <p>"Save silver, lose luck," he retorted. After all, it wasn't so difficult a
  task to talk to her. "Anyway, better a smile from you than the glitter of
  money."</p>

  <p>She laughed. "But how quickly you learn, mountainy! Still, what if I say I
  liked you better in tatters, with your powerful brown muscles quivering
  through the rips?"</p>

  <p>"Do you say it, Vail?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, then!"</p>

  <p>He chuckled, raising his great hands to his shoulders. There was the rasp
  of tearing cloth, and a long rent gleamed in the back of his Selui shirt.
  "There, Vail!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she gasped. "Hull, you wastrel! But it's only a seam." She fumbled
  in the bag at her belt. "Let me stitch it back for you."</p>

  <p>She bent behind him, and he could feel her breath on his skin, warm as
  spring sunshine. He set his jaw, scowled, and then plunged determinedly into
  what he had to say. "I'd like to talk to you again this evening, Vail."</p>

  <p>He sensed her smile at his back. "Would you?" she murmured demurely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if Enoch Ormiston hasn't spoken first for your time."</p>

  <p>"But he has, Hull."</p>

  <p>He knew she was teasing him deliberately. "I'm sorry," he said
  shortly.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I told him I was busy," she finished.</p>

  <p>"And are you?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was a whisper behind him. "No. Not unless you tell me I am."</p>

  <p>His great roar of a laugh sounded. "Then I tell you so, Vail."</p>

  <p>He felt her tug at the seam, then she leaned very close to his neck, but
  it was only to bite the thread with her white teeth. "So!" she said gaily.
  "Once mended, twice new."</p>

  <p>Before Hull could answer there came the clang of File Ormson's sledge, and
  the measured bellow of his Forge Song. They listened as his resounding
  strokes beat time to the song.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Then it's ho&mdash;oh&mdash;ho&mdash;oh&mdash;ho!<br>
  While I'm singing to the ringing<br>
  Of each blow&mdash;blow&mdash;blow!<br>
  Till the metal's soft as butter<br>
  Let my forge and bellows sputter<br>
  Like the revels of the devils down below&mdash;low&mdash;LOW!<br>
  Like the revels of the devils down below!"</p>

  <p>"I must go," said Hull, smiling reluctantly. "There's work for me
  now."</p>

  <p>"What does File make?" asked Vail.</p>

  <p>Instantly Hull's smile faded. "He forges&mdash;a sword!"</p>

  <p>Vail too was no longer the joyous one of a moment ago. Over both of them
  had come a shadow, the shadow of the Empire. Out in the blue hills of Ozarky
  Joaquin Smith was marching.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Evening. Hull watched the glint of a copper moon on Vail's
  copper hair, and leaned back on the bench. Not the one near the pump this
  time; that had been already occupied by two laughing couples, and though they
  had been welcomed eagerly enough, Hull had preferred to be alone. It wasn't
  mountain shyness any more, for his great, good-natured presence had found
  ready friendship in Ormiston village; it was merely the projection of that
  moodiness that had settled over both of them at parting, and so they sat now
  on the bench near Vail Ormiston's gate at the edge of town. Behind them the
  stone house loomed dark, for her father was scurrying about in town on
  Confederation business, and the help had availed themselves of the evening of
  freedom to join the crowd in the village square. But the yellow daylight of
  the oillamp showed across the road in the house of Hue Helm, the farmer who
  had brought Hull from Norse to Ormiston.</p>

  <p>It was at this light that Hull stared thoughtfully. "I like fighting," he
  repeated, "but somehow the joy has gone out of this. It's as if one waited an
  approaching thunder cloud."</p>

  <p>"How," asked Vail in a timid, small voice, "can one fight magic?"</p>

  <p>"There is no magic," said the youth, echoing Old Einar's words. "There is
  no such thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hull! How can you say such stupid words?"</p>

  <p>"I say what was told me by one who knows."</p>

  <p>"No magic!" echoed Vail. "Then tell me what gives the wizards of the south
  their power. Why is it that Jaoquin Smith has never lost a battle? What stole
  away the courage of the men of the Memphis League, who are good fighting men?
  And what&mdash;for this I have seen with my own eyes&mdash;pushes the
  horseless wagons of N'Orleans through the streets, and what lights that city
  by night? If not magic, then what?"</p>

  <p>"Knowledge," said Hull. "The knowledge of the Ancients."</p>

  <p>"The knowledge of the Ancients was magic," said the girl. "Everyone knows
  that the Ancients were wizards, warlocks, and sorcerers. If Holland, Olin,
  and Martin Sair are not sorcerers, then what are they? If Black Margot is no
  witch, then my eyes never looked on one."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen them?" queried Hull.</p>

  <p>"Of course, all but Holland, who is dead. Three years ago during the Peace
  of Memphis my father and I traveled into the Empire. I saw all of them about
  the city of N'Orleans."</p>

  <p>"And is she&mdash;what they say she is?"</p>

  <p>"The Princess?" Vail's eyes dropped. "Men say she is beautiful."</p>

  <p>"But you think not?"</p>

  <p>"What if she is?" snapped the girl almost defiantly. "Her beauty is like
  her youth, like her very life&mdash;artificial, preserved after its allotted
  time, frozen. That's it&mdash;frozen by sorcery. And as for the rest of
  her&mdash;" Vail's voice lowered, hesitated, for not even the plain-spoken
  valley girls discussed such things with men. "They say she has outworn a
  dozen lovers," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Hull was startled, shocked. "Vail!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>She swung the subject back to safer ground, but he saw her flush red.
  "Don't tell me there's no magic!" she said sharply.</p>

  <p>"At least," he returned, "there's no magic will stop a bullet save flesh
  and bone. Yes, and the wizard who stops one with his skull lies just as dead
  as an honest man."</p>

  <p>"I hope you're right," she breathed timidly. "Hull, he must be stopped! He
  must!"</p>

  <p>"But why feel so strongly, Vail? I like a fight&mdash;but men say that
  life in the Empire is much like life without, and who cares to whom he pays
  his taxes if only&mdash;" He broke off suddenly, remembering. "Your father!"
  he exclaimed. "The eldarch!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my father, Hull. If Joaquin Smith takes Ormison, my father is the
  one to suffer. His taxes will be gone, his lands parceled out, and he's old,
  Hull&mdash;old. What will become of him then? I know many people feel the way
  you&mdash;the way you said, and so they fight half-heartedly, and the Master
  takes town after town without killing a single man. And then they think there
  is magic in the very name of Joaquin Smith, and he marches through armies
  that outnumber him ten to one." She paused. "But not Ormiston!" she cried
  fiercely. "Not if the women have to bear arms!"</p>

  <p>"Not Ormiston," he agreed gently.</p>

  <p>"You'll fight, Hull, won't you? Even though you're not Ormiston born?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. I have bow and sword, and a good pistol. I'll fight."</p>

  <p>"But no rifle? Wait, Hull." She rose and slipped away in the darkness.</p>

  <p>In a moment she was back again. "Here. Here is rifle and horn and ball. Do
  you know its use?"</p>

  <p>He smiled proudly. "What I can see I can hit," he said, "like any mountain
  man."</p>

  <p>"Then," she whispered with fire in her voice, "send me a bullet through
  the Master's skull. And one besides between the eyes of Black Margot&mdash;
  for me!"</p>

  <p>"I do not fight women," he said.</p>

  <p>"Not woman but witch!"</p>

  <p>"None the less, Vail, it must be two bullets for the Master and only the
  captive's chains for Princess Margaret, at least so far as Hull Tarvish is
  concerned. But wouldn't it please you fully as well to watch her draw water
  from your pump, or shine pots in your kitchen?" He was jollying her, trying
  to paint fanciful pictures to lift her spirit from the somber depths.</p>

  <p>But she read it otherwise. "Yes!" she blazed. "Oh, yes, Hull, that's
  better. If I could ever hope to see that&mdash;" She rose suddenly, and he
  followed her to the gate. "You must go," she murmured, "but before you leave,
  you can&mdash;if you wish it, Hull&mdash;kiss me."</p>

  <p>Of a sudden he was all shy mountainy again. He set the rifle against the
  fence with its horn swinging from the trigger guard. He faced her flushing a
  furious red, but only half from embarrassment, for the rest was happiness. He
  circled her with his great arms and very hastily, fire touched his lips to
  her soft ones.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said exultantly, "now I will fight if I have to charge the men
  of the Empire alone."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">4. THE BATTLE OF EAGLEFOOT FLOW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The men of the Confederation were pouring into Ormiston all
  night long, the little dark men of Ch'cago and Selui, the tall blond ones
  from the regions of Iowa, where Dutch blood still survived, mingled now with
  a Scandinavian infusion from the upper rivers. All night there was a rumble
  of wagons, bringing powder and ball from Selui, and food as well for Ormiston
  couldn't even attempt to feed so many ravenous mouths. A magnificent army,
  ten thousand strong, and all of them seasoned fighting men, trained in a
  dozen little wars and in the bloody War of the Lakes and Rivers, when Ch'cago
  had bitten so large a piece from Selui territories.</p>

  <p>The stand was to be at Ormiston, and Norse, the only settlement now
  between Joaquin Smith and the Confederation, was left to its fate.
  Experienced leaders had examined the territory, and had agreed on a plan.
  Three miles south of the town, the road followed an ancient railroad cut,
  with fifty-foot embankments on either side, heavily wooded for a mile north
  and south of the bridge across Eaglefoot Flow.</p>

  <p>Along this course they were to distribute their men, a single line where
  the bluffs were high and steep, massed forces where the terrain permitted.
  Joaquin Smith must follow the road; there was no other. An ideal situation
  for ambush, and a magnificently simple plan. So magnificent and so simple
  that it could not fail, they said, and forgot completely that they were
  facing the supreme military genius of the entire Age of the
  Enlightenment.</p>

  <p>It was mid-morning when the woods&mdash;runners that had been sent into
  Ozarky returned with breath-taking news. Joaquin Smith had received the Selui
  defiance of his representations, and was marching. The Master was marching,
  and though they had come swiftly and had ridden horseback from Norse, he
  could not now be far distant. His forces? The runners estimated them at four
  thousand men, all mounted, with perhaps another thousand auxiliaries.
  Outnumbered two to one! But Hull Tarvish remembered tales of other encounters
  where Joaquin Smith had overcome greater odds than these.</p>

  <p>The time was at hand. In the little room beside File Ormson's workshop,
  Hull was going over his weapons while Vail Ormiston, pale and nervous and
  very lovely, watched him. He drew a bit of oiled rag through the bore of the
  rifle she had given him, rubbed a spot of rust from the hammer, blew a speck
  of dust from the pan. Beside him on the table lay powder horn and ball, and
  his steel bow leaned against his chair.</p>

  <p>"A sweet weapon!" he said admiringly, sighting down the long barrel.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I hope it serves you well," murmured Vail tremulously. "Hull, he
  must be stopped. He must!"</p>

  <p>"We'll try, Vail." He rose. "It's time I started."</p>

  <p>She was facing him. "Then, before you go, will you&mdash;kiss me,
  Hull?"</p>

  <p>He strode toward her, then recoiled in sudden alarm, for it was at that
  instant that the thing happened. There was a series of the faintest possible
  clicks, and Hull fancied that he saw for an instant a glistening of tiny blue
  sparks on candle-sticks and metal objects about the room, and that he felt
  for a brief moment a curious tingling. Then he forgot all of these strange
  trifles as the powder horn on the table roared into terrific flame, and
  flaming wads of powder shot meteor-like around him.</p>

  <p>For an instant he froze rigid. Vail was screaming; her dress was burning.
  He moved into sudden action, sweeping her from her feet, crashing her
  sideways to the floor, where his great hands beat out the fire. Then he
  slapped table and floor; he brought his ample sandals down on flaming spots,
  and finally there were no more flames.</p>

  <p>He turned coughing and choking in the black smoke, and bent over Vail, who
  gasped half overcome. Her skirt had burned to her knees, and for the moment
  she was too distraught to cover them, though there was no modesty in the
  world in those days like that of the women of the middle river regions. But
  as Hull leaned above her she huddled back.</p>

  <p>"Are you hurt?" he cried. "Vail, are you burned?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no!" she panted.</p>

  <p>"Then outside!" he snapped, reaching down to lift her.</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;not like this!"</p>

  <p>He understood. He snatched his leather smith's apron from the wall,
  whipped it around her, and bore her into the clearer air of the street.</p>

  <p>Outside there was chaos. He set Vail gently on the step and surveyed a
  scene of turmoil. Men ran shouting, and from windows along the street black
  smoke poured. A dozen yards away a powder wagon had blasted itself into a
  vast mushroom of smoke, incinerating horses and driver alike. On the porch
  across the way lay a writhing man, torn by the rifle that had burst in his
  hands.</p>

  <p>He comprehended suddenly. "The sparkers!" he roared. "Joaquin Smith's
  sparkers! Old Einar told me about them." He groaned. "There goes our
  ammunition."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The Erden resonators. A device, now obsolete, that
  projected an inductive field sufficient to induce tiny electrical discharges
  in metal objects up to a distance of many miles. Thus it ignited inflammables
  like gunpowder. ]</p>

  <p>The girl made a great effort to control herself. "Joaquin Smith's
  sorcery," she said dully. "And there goes hope as well."</p>

  <p>He started. "Hope? No! Wait, Vail."</p>

  <p>He rushed toward the milling group that surrounded bearded old Marcus
  Ormiston and the Confederation leaders. He plowed his way fiercely through,
  and seized the panic-stricken graybeard. "What now?" he roared. "What are you
  going to do?"</p>

  <p>"Do? Do?" The old man was beyond comprehending.</p>

  <p>"Yes, do! I'll tell you." He glared at the five leaders. "You'll carry
  through. Do you see? For powder and ball there's bow and sword, and just as
  good for the range we need. Gather your men! Gather your men and march!"</p>

  <p>And such, within the hour, was the decision. Hull marched first with the
  Ormiston men, and he carried with him the memory of Vail's farewell. It
  embarrassed him cruelly to be kissed thus in public, but there was great
  pleasure in the glimpse of Enoch Ormiston's sour face as he had watched
  her.</p>

  <p>The Ormiston men were first on the line of the Master's approach, and they
  filtered to their forest-hidden places as silently as foxes. Hull let his
  eyes wander back along the cut and what he saw pleased him, for no eye could
  have detected that along the deserted road lay ten thousand fighting men.
  They were good woodsmen too, these fellows from the upper rivers and the
  saltless seas.</p>

  <p>Down the way from Norse a single horseman came galloping. Old Marcus
  Ormiston recognized him, stood erect, and hailed him. They talked; Hull could
  hear the words. The Master had passed through Norse, pausing only long enough
  to notify the eldarch that henceforth his taxes must be transmitted to
  N'Orleans, and then had moved leisurely onward. No, there had been no sign of
  sorcery, nor had he even seen any trace of the witch Black Margot, but then,
  he had ridden away before the Master had well arrived.</p>

  <p>Their informant rode on toward Ormiston, and the men fell to their quiet
  waiting. A half hour passed, and then, faintly drifting on the silent air,
  came the sound of music. Singing; men's voices in song. Hull listened
  intently, and his skin crept and his hair prickled as he made out the words
  of the Battle Song of N'Orleans:</p>

  <p class="verse">"Queen of cities, reigning<br>
  Empress, starry-pearled<br>
  See our arms sustaining<br>
  Battle flags unfurled!<br>
  <br>
  Hear our song rise higher,<br>
  Fierce as battle fire,<br>
  Death our one desire<br>
  Or the Empire of the World!"</p>

  <p>Hull gripped his bow and set feather to cord. He knew well enough that the
  plan was to permit the enemy to pass unmolested until his whole line was
  within the span of the ambush, but the rumble of that distant song was like
  spark to powder. And now, far down the way beyond the cut, he saw the dust
  rising. Joaquin Smith was at hand.</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;the unexpected! Ever afterward Hull told himself that it should
  have been the expected, that the Master's reputation should have warned them
  that so simple a plan as theirs must fail. There was no time now for such
  vain thoughts, for suddenly, through the trees to his right, brown-clothed,
  lithe little men were slipping like charging shadows, horns sounding,
  whistles shrilling. The woods runners of the Master! Joaquin Smith had
  anticipated just such an ambush.</p>

  <p>Instantly Hull saw their own weakness. They were ten thousand, true
  enough, but here they were strung thinly over a distance of two miles, and
  now the woods runners were at a vast advantage in numbers, with the main body
  approaching. One chance! Fight it out, drive off the scouts, and retire into
  the woods. While the army existed, even though Ormiston fell, there was
  hope.</p>

  <p>He shouted, strung his arrow, and sent it flashing through the leaves. A
  bad place for arrows; their arching flight was always deflected by the
  tangled branches. He slung bow on shoulder and gripped his sword; close
  quarters was the solution, the sort of fight that made blood tingle and life
  seem joyous.</p>

  <p>Then&mdash;the second surprise! The woods runners had flashed their own
  weapons, little blunt revolvers.* But they sent no bullets; only pale beams
  darted through leaves and branches, faint blue streaks of light. Sorcery? And
  to what avail?</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Kohlmar's ionic beams. Two parallel beams of highly
  actinic light ionize a path of air, and along these conductive lanes of gas
  an electric current can he passed, powerful enough to kill or merely intense
  enough to punish. ]</p>&gt;

  <p>He learned instantly. His sword grew suddenly scorching hot in his hands,
  and a moment later the queerest pain he had ever encountered racked his body.
  A violent, stinging, inward tingle that twitched his muscles and paralyzed
  his movements. A brief second and the shock ceased, but his sword lay smoking
  in the leaves, and his steel bow had seared his shoulders. Around him men
  were yelling in pain, writhing on the ground, running back into the forest
  depths. He cursed the beams; they flicked like sunlight through branched and
  leafy tangles where an honest arrow could find no passage.</p>

  <p>Yet apparently no man had been killed. Hands were seared and blistered by
  weapons that grew hot under the blue beams, bodies were racked by the torture
  that Hull could not know was electric shock, but none was slain. Hope flared
  again, and he ran to head off a retreating group.</p>

  <p>"To the road!" he roared. "Out where our arrows can fly free! Charge the
  column!"</p>

  <p>For a moment the group halted. Hull seized a yet unheated sword from
  someone, and turned back. "Come on!" he bellowed. "Come on! We'll have a
  fight of this yet!"</p>

  <p>Behind him he heard the trample of feet. The beams flicked out again, but
  he held his sword in the shadow of his own body, gritted his teeth, and bore
  the pain that twisted him. He rushed on; he heard his own name bellowed in
  the booming voice of File Ormson, but he only shouted encouragement and burst
  out into the full sunlight of the road.</p>

  <p>Below in the cut was the head of the column, advancing placidly. He
  glimpsed a silver helmeted, black haired man on a great white mare at its
  head, and beside him a slighter figure on a black stallion. Joaquin Smith!
  Hull roared down the embankment toward him.</p>

  <p>Four men spurred instantly between him and the figure with the silver
  helmet. A beam flicked; his sword scorched his skin and he flung it away.
  "Come on!" he bellowed. "Here's a fight!"</p>

  <p>Strangely, in curious clarity, he saw the eyes of the Empire men, a smile
  in them, mysteriously amused. No anger, no fear&mdash;just amusement. Hull
  felt a sudden surge of trepidation, glanced quickly behind him, and knew
  finally the cause of that amusement. No one had followed him; he had charged
  the Master's army alone!</p>

  <p>Now the fiercest anger he had ever known gripped Hull. Deserted! Abandoned
  by those for whom he fought. He roared his rage to the echoing bluffs, and
  sprang at the horseman nearest him.</p>

  <p>The horse reared, pawing the air. Hull thrust his mighty arms below its
  belly and heaved with a convulsion of his great muscles. Backward toppled
  steed and rider, and all about the Master was a milling turmoil where a man
  scrambled desperately to escape the clashing hooves. But Hull glimpsed
  Joaquin Smith sitting statuelike and smiling on his great white mare.</p>

  <p>He tore another rider from his saddle, and then caught from the corner of
  his eye, he saw the slim youth at the Master's side raise a weapon, coolly,
  methodically. For the barest instant Hull faced icy green eyes where cold,
  passionless death threatened. He flung himself aside as a beam spat smoking
  against the dust of the road.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" snapped Joaquin Smith, his low voice clear through the turmoil.
  "The youth is splendid!"</p>

  <p>But Hull had no mind to die uselessly. He bent, flung himself halfway up
  the bluff in a mighty leap, caught a dragging branch, and swung into the
  forest. A startled woods runner faced him; he flung the fellow behind him
  down the slope, and slipped into the shelter of leaves. "The wise warrior
  fights pride," he muttered to himself. "It's no disgrace for one man to run
  from an army."</p>

  <p>He was mountain bred. He circled silently through the forest, avoiding the
  woods runners who were herding the Confederation army back towards Ormiston.
  He smiled grimly as he recalled the words he had spoken to Vail. He had
  justified them; he had charged the army of the Master alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">5. BLACK MARGOT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Hull circled wide through the forest, and it took all his
  mountain craft to slip free through the files of woods runners. He came at
  last to the fields east of Ormiston, and there made the road, entering from
  the direction of Selui.</p>

  <p>Everywhere were evidences of rout. Wagons lay overturned, their teams
  doubtless used to further the escape of their drivers. Guns and rifles, many
  of them burst, littered the roadside, and now and again he passed black
  smoking piles and charred areas that marked the resting place of an
  ammunition cart.</p>

  <p>Yet Ormiston was little damaged. He saw the fire-gutted remains of a shed
  or two where powder had been stored, and down the street a house roof still
  smoked. But there was no sign of battle carnage, and only the crowded street
  gave evidence of the unusual.</p>

  <p>He found File Ormson in the group that stared across town to where the
  road from Norse elbowed east to enter. Hull had outsped the leisurely march
  of the Master, for there at the bend was the glittering army, now halted. Not
  even the woods runners had come into Ormiston town, for there they were too,
  lined in a brown-clad rank along the edge of the wood-lots beyond the nearer
  fields. They had made no effort, apparently, to take prisoners but had simply
  herded the terrified defenders into the village. Joaquin Smith had done it
  again; he had taken a town without a single death, or at least no casualties
  other than whatever injuries had come from bursting rifles and blazing
  powder.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Hull noticed something. "Where are the Confederation men?" he
  asked sharply.</p>

  <p>File Ormson turned gloomy eyes on him. "Gone. Flying back to Selui like
  scared gophers to their holes." He scowled, then smiled. "That was a fool's
  gesture of yours at Eaglefoot Flow, Hull. A fool's gesture, but brave."</p>

  <p>The youth grimaced wryly. "I thought I was followed."</p>

  <p>"And so you should have been, but that those fiendish ticklers tickled
  away our courage. But they can kill as well as tickle; when there was need of
  it before Memphis they killed quickly enough."</p>

  <p>Hull thought of the green-eyed youth. "I think I nearly learned that," he
  said smiling.</p>

  <p>Down the way there was some sort of stir. Hull narrowed his eyes to watch,
  and descried the silver helmet of the Master. He dismounted and faced
  someone; it was&mdash;yes, old Marcus Ormiston. He left File Ormson and
  shouldered his way to the edge of the crowd that circled the two.</p>

  <p>Joaquin Smith was speaking. "And," he said, "all taxes are to be forwarded
  to N'Orleans, including those on your own lands. Half of them I shall use to
  maintain my government, but half will revert to your own district, which will
  be under a governor I shall appoint in Selui when that city is taken. You are
  no longer eldarch, but for the present you may collect the taxes at the rate
  I prescribe."</p>

  <p>Old Marcus was bitterly afraid; Hull could see his beard waggling like an
  oriole's nest in a breeze. Yet there was a shrewd, bargaining streak in him.
  "You are very hard," he whined. "You left Pace Helm as eldarch undisturbed in
  Norse. Why do you punish me because I fought to hold what was mine? Why
  should that anger you so?"</p>

  <p>"I am not angry," said the Master passively. "I never blame any for
  fighting against me, but it is my policy to favor those eldarchs who yield
  peacefully." He paused. "Those are my terms, and generous enough."</p>

  <p>They were generous, thought Hull, especially to the people of Ormiston,
  who received back much less than half their taxes from the eldarch as roads,
  bridges, or wells.</p>

  <p>"My&mdash;my lands?" faltered the old man.</p>

  <p>"Keep what you till," said Joaquin Smith indifferently. "The rest of them
  go to their tenants." He turned away, placed foot to stirrup, and swung upon
  his great white mare.</p>

  <p>Hull caught his first fair glimpse of the conqueror. Black hair cropped
  below his ears, cool greenish grey eyes, a mouth with something faintly
  humorous about it. He was tall as Hull himself, more slender, but with
  powerful shoulders, and he seemed no older than the late twenties, or no more
  than thirty at most, though that was only the magic of Martin Sair, since
  more than eighty years had passed since his birth in the mountains of Mexico.
  He wore the warrior's garb of the southlands, a shirt of metallic silver
  scales, short thigh-length trousers of some shiny, silken material, cothurns
  on his feet. His bronzed body was like the ancient statues Hull had seen in
  Selui, and he looked hardly the fiend that most people thought him. A
  pleasant seeming man, save for something faintly arrogant in his face&mdash;
  no, not arrogant, exactly, but proud or confident, as if he felt himself a
  being driven by fate, as perhaps he was.</p>

  <p>He spoke again, now to his men. "Camp there," he ordered, waving at
  Ormiston square, "and there," pointing at a fallow field. "Do not damage the
  crops." He rode forward, and a dozen officers followed. "The Church," he
  said.</p>

  <p>A voice, a tense, shrieking voice behind Hull. "You! It is, Hull! It's
  you!" It was Vail, teary eyed and pale. "They said you were&mdash;" She broke
  off sobbing, clinging to him, while Enoch Ormiston watched sourly.</p>

  <p>He held her. "It seems I failed you," he said ruefully. "But I did do my
  best, Vail."</p>

  <p>"Failed? I don't care." She calmed. "I don't care, Hull, since you're
  here."</p>

  <p>"And it isn't as bad as it might be," he consoled. "He wasn't as severe as
  I feared."</p>

  <p>"Severe !" she echoed. "Do you believe those mild words of his, Hull?
  First our taxes then our lands, and next it will be our lives&mdash;or at
  least my father's life. Don't you understand? That was no eldarch from some
  enemy town, Hull&mdash;that was Joaquin Smith. Joaquin Smith! Do you trust
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Vail, do you believe that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I believe it!" She began to sob again. "See how he has already
  won over half the town with&mdash;with that about the taxes. Don't you be won
  over, Hull. I&mdash;couldn't stand it!"</p>

  <p>"I will not," he promised.</p>

  <p>"He and Black Margot and their craft! I hate them, Hull. I&mdash;Look
  there! Look there!"</p>

  <p>He spun around. For a moment he saw nothing save the green-eyed youth who
  had turned death-laden eyes on him at Eaglefoot Flow, mounted on the mighty
  black stallion. Youth! He saw suddenly that it was a woman&mdash;a girl
  rather. Eighteen&mdash;twenty-five? He couldn't tell. Her face was averted as
  she scanned the crowd that lined the opposite side of the street, but the
  sunset fell on a flaming black mop of hair, so black that it glinted blue
  &mdash;an intense, unbelievable black. Like Joaquin Smith she wore only a
  shirt and very abbreviated shorts, but a caparison protected the slim
  daintiness of her legs from any contact with the mount's ribs. There was a
  curious grace in the way she sat the idling steed, one hand on its haunches,
  the other on withers, the bridle dangling loose. Her Spanish mother's blood
  showed only in the clear, transparent olive of her skin, and of course, in
  the startling ebony of her hair.</p>

  <p>"Black Margot!" Hull whispered, "Brazen! Half naked! What's so beautiful
  about her?"</p>

  <p>As if she heard his whisper, she turned suddenly, her emerald eyes
  sweeping the crowd about him, and he felt his question answered. Her beauty
  was starkly incredible&mdash;audacious, outrageous. It was more than a mere
  lack of flaws; it was a sultry, flaming positive beauty with a hint of
  sullenness in it. The humor of the Master's mouth lurked about hers as
  mockery; her perfect lips seemed always about to smile, but to smile cruelly
  and sardonically. Hers was a ruthless and pitiless perfection, but it was
  nevertheless perfection, even to the faintly Oriental cast given by her black
  hair and sea-green eyes.</p>

  <p>Those eyes met Hull's and it was almost as if he heard an audible click.
  He saw recognition in her face, and she passed her glance casually over his
  mighty figure. He stiffened, stared defiantly back, and swept his own gaze
  insolently over her body from the midnight hair to the diminutive cothurns on
  her feet. If she acknowledged his gaze at all, it was by the faintest of all
  possible smiles of mockery as she rode coolly away toward Joaquin Smith.</p>

  <p>Vail was trembling against him, and it was a great relief to look into her
  deep but not at all mysterious blue eyes, and to see the quite understandable
  loveliness of her pale features. What if she hadn't the insolent brilliance
  of the Princess, he thought fiercely. She was sweet and honest and loyal to
  her beliefs, and he loved her. Yet he could not keep his eyes from straying
  once more to the figure on the black stallion.</p>

  <p>"She&mdash;she smiled at you, Hull!" gasped Vail. "I'm frightened. I'm
  terribly frightened."</p>

  <p>His fascination was yielding now to a surge of hatred for Joaquin Smith,
  for the Princess, for the whole Empire. It was Vail he loved, and she was
  being crushed by these. An idea formed slowly as he stared down the street to
  where Joaquin Smith had dismounted and was now striding into the little
  church. He heard an approving murmur sweep the crowd, already half won over
  by the distribution of land. That was simply policy, the Master's worshipping
  in Ormiston church, a gesture to the crowd.</p>

  <p>He lifted the steel bow from his back and bent it. The spring was still in
  it; it had been heated enough to scorch his skin but not enough to untemper
  it. "Wait here!" he snapped to Vail, and strode up the street toward the
  church.</p>

  <p>Outside stood a dozen Empire men, and the Princess idled on her great
  black horse. He slipped across the churchyard, around behind where a tangle
  of vines stretched toward the roof. Would they support his weight? They did,
  and he pulled himself hand over hand to the eaves, and thence to the peak.
  The spire hid him from the Master's men, and not one of the Ormiston folk
  glanced his way.</p>

  <p>He crept forward to the base of the steeple. Now he must leave the peak
  and creep precariously along the steep slope around it. He reached the street
  edge and peered cautiously over.</p>

  <p>The Master was still within. Against his will he glanced at Black Margot,
  and even put cord to feather and sighted at her ivory throat. But he could
  not. He could not loose the shaft.</p>

  <p>Below him there was a stir. Joaquin Smith came out and swung to his white
  horse. Now was the moment. Hull rose to his knees, 'hoping that he could
  remain steady on the sharp pitch of the roof. Carefully, carefully, he drew
  the steel arrow back.</p>

  <p>There was a shout. He had been seen, and a blue beam sent racking pain
  through his body. For an instant he bore it, then loosed his arrow and went
  sliding down the roof edge and over.</p>

  <p>He fell on soft loam. A dozen hands seized him, dragged him upright,
  thrust him out into the street. He saw Joaquin Smith still on his horse, but
  the glistening arrow stood upright like a plume in his silver helmet, and a
  trickle of blood was red on his cheek.</p>

  <p>But he wasn't killed. He raised the helmet from his head, waved aside the
  cluster of officers, and with his own hands bound a white cloth about his
  forehead. Then he turned cool grey eyes on Hull.</p>

  <p>"You drive a strong shaft," he said, and then recognition flickered in his
  eyes. "I spared your life some hours ago, did I not?"</p>

  <p>Hull said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Why," resumed the Master, "do you seek to kill me after your eldarch has
  made peace with me? You are part of the Empire now, and this is treason."</p>

  <p>"I made no peace!" growled Hull.</p>

  <p>"But your leader did, thereby binding you.</p>

  <p>Hull could not keep his gaze from the emerald eyes of the Princess, who
  was watching him without expression save faint mockery.</p>

  <p>"Have you nothing to say," asked Joaquin Smith.</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>The Master's eyes slid over him. "Are you Ormiston born?" he asked. "What
  is your name?"</p>

  <p>No need to bring troubles on his friends. "No," said Hull. "I am called
  Hull Tarvish."</p>

  <p>The conqueror turned away. "Lock him up," he ordered coolly. "Let him make
  whatever preparations his religion requires, and then&mdash;execute him."</p>

  <p>Above the murmur of the crowd Hull heard Vail Ormiston's cry of anguish.
  He turned to smile at her, watched her held by two Empire men as she
  struggled to reach him. "I'm sorry," he called gently. "I love you, Vail."
  Then he was being thrust away down the street.</p>

  <p>He was pushed into Hue Helm's stone-walled tool shed. It had been cleared
  of everything, doubtless for some officer's quarters. Hull drew himself up
  and stood passively in the gathering darkness where a single shaft of sunset
  light angled through the door, before which stood two grim Empire men.</p>

  <p>One of them spoke. "Keep peaceful, Weed,"* he said in his N'Orleans drawl.
  "Go ahead with your praying, or whatever it is you do."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Weed: The term applied by Dominists [the Master's
  partisans] to their opposers. It originated in Joaquin Smith's remark before
  the Battle of Memphis: "Even the weeds of the fields have taken arms against
  me." ]</p>

  <p>"I do nothing," said Hull. "The mountainies believe that a right life is
  better than a right ending, and right or wrong a ghost's but a ghost
  anyway."</p>

  <p>The guard laughed. "And a ghost you'll be."</p>

  <p>"If a ghost I'll be," retorted Hull, turning slowly toward him, "I'd
  sooner turn one&mdash;fighting!"</p>

  <p>He sprang suddenly, crashed a mighty fist against the arm that bore the
  weapon, thrust one guard upon the other, and overleaped the tangle into the
  dusk. As he spun to circle the house, something very hard smashed viciously
  against the back of his skull, sending him sprawling half dazed against the
  wall.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">6. THE HARRIERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">After a brief moment Hull sprawled half stunned, then his
  muscles lost their paralysis and he thrust himself to his feet, whirling to
  face whatever assault threatened. In the doorway the guards still scrambled,
  but directly before him towered a rider on a black mount, and two men on foot
  flanked him. The rider, of course, was the Princess, her glorious green eyes
  luminous as a cat's in the dusk as she slapped a short sword into its
  scabbard. It was a blow from the flat of its blade that had felled him.</p>

  <p>She held now the blunt weapon of the blue beam. It came to him that he had
  never heard her speak, but she spoke now in a voice low and liquid, yet cold,
  cold as the flow of an ice-crusted winter stream. "Stand quiet, Hull
  Tarvish," she said. "One flash will burst that stubborn heart of yours
  forever."</p>

  <p>Perforce he stood quiet, his back to the wall of the shed. He had no doubt
  at all that the Princess would kill him if he moved; he couldn't doubt it
  with her icy eyes upon him. He stared sullenly back, and a phrase of Old
  Einar's came strangely to his memory. "Satanically beautiful," the old man
  had called her, and so she was. Hell or the art of Martin Sair had so
  fashioned her that no man could gaze unmoved on the false purity of her face,
  no man at least in whom flowed red blood.</p>

  <p>She spoke again, letting her glance flicker disdainfully over the two
  appalled guards. "The Master will be pleased," she said contemptuously, "to
  learn that one unarmed Weed outmatches two men of his own cohort."</p>

  <p>The nearer man faltered, "But your Highness, he rushed us
  unexpect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No matter," she cut in, and turned back to Hull. For the first time now
  he really felt the presence of death as she said coolly, "I am minded to kill
  you."</p>

  <p>"Then do it!" he snapped.</p>

  <p>"I came here to watch you die," she observed calmly. "It interests me to
  see men die, boldly or cowardly or resignedly. I think you would die
  boldly."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Hull that she was deliberately torturing him by this
  procrastination. "Try me!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"But I think also," she resumed, "that your living might amuse me more
  than your death, and" for the first time there was a breath of feeling in her
  voice "God knows I need amusement!" Her tones chilled again. "I give you your
  life."</p>

  <p>"Your Highness," muttered the cowed guard, "the Master has ordered
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I countermand the orders," she said shortly. And then to Hull. "You are a
  fighter. Are you also a man of honor?"</p>

  <p>"If I'm not," he retorted, "the lie that says I am would mean nothing to
  me."</p>

  <p>She smiled coldly. "Well, I think you are, Hull Tarvish. You go free on
  your word to carry no weapons, and your promise to visit me this evening in
  my quarters at the eldarch's home." She paused. "Well?"</p>

  <p>"I give my word."</p>

  <p>"And I take it." She crashed her heels against the ribs of the great
  stallion, and the beast reared and whirled. "Away, all of you!" she ordered.
  "You two, carry tub and water for my bath." She rode off toward the
  street.</p>

  <p>Hull let himself relax against the wall with a low "whew!" Sweat started
  on his cold forehead, and his mighty muscles felt almost weak. It wasn't that
  he had feared death, he told himself, but the strain of facing those
  glorious, devilish emerald eyes, and the cold torment of the voice of Black
  Margot, and the sense of her taunting him, mocking him, even her last
  careless gesture of freeing him. He drew himself erect. After all, fear of
  death or none, he loved life, and let that be enough.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly toward the street. Across the way lights glowed in Marcus
  Orison's home, and he wondered if Vail were there, perhaps serving the
  Princess Margaret as he had so lately suggested the contrary. He wanted to
  find Vail; he wanted to use her cool loveliness as an antidote for the dark
  poison of the beauty he had been facing. And then, at the gate, he drew back
  suddenly. A group of men in Empire garb came striding by, and among them,
  helmetless and with his head bound, moved the Master.</p>

  <p>His eyes fell on Hull. He paused suddenly and frowned. "You again!" he
  said. "How is it that you still live, Hull Tarvish?"</p>

  <p>"The Princess ordered it."</p>

  <p>The frown faded. "So," said Joaquin Smith slowly, "Margaret takes it upon
  herself to interfere somewhat too frequently. I suppose she also freed
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, on my promise not to bear arms."</p>

  <p>There was a curious expression in the face of the conqueror. "Well," he
  said almost gently, "it was not my intention to torture you, but merely to
  have you killed for your treason. It may be that you will soon wish that my
  orders had been left unaltered." He strode on into the eldarch's dooryard,
  with his silent men following.</p>

  <p>Hull turned his steps toward the center of the village. Everywhere he
  passed Empire men scurrying about the tasks of encampment, and supply wagons
  rumbled and jolted in the streets. He saw files of the soldiers passing
  slowly before cook-wagons and the smell of food floated on the air, reminding
  him that he was ravenously hungry. He hurried toward his room beside File
  Ormiston's shop, and there, tragic-eyed and mist-pale, he found Vail
  Ormiston.</p>

  <p>She was huddled on the doorstep with sour Enoch holding her against him.
  It was Enoch who first perceived Hull, and his jaw dropped and his eyes
  bulged, and a gurgling sound issued from his throat. And Vail looked up with
  uncomprehending eyes, stared for a moment without expression, and then, with
  a little moan, crumpled and fainted.</p>

  <p>She was unconscious only a few moments, scarcely long enough for Hull to
  bear her into his room. There she lay now on his couch, clinging to his great
  hand, convinced at last of his living presence.</p>

  <p>"I think," she murmured, "that you're as deathless as Joaquin Smith, Hull.
  I'll never believe you dead again. Tell me&mdash;tell me how it
  happened."</p>

  <p>He told her. "Black Margot's to thank for it," he finished.</p>

  <p>But the very name frightened Vail. "She means evil, Hull. She terrifies me
  with her witch's eyes and her hell-stained hair. I haven't even dared go home
  for fear of her."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "Don't worry about me, Vail. I'm safe enough."</p>

  <p>Enoch cut in. "Here's one for the Harriers, then," he said sourly. "The
  pack needs him."</p>

  <p>"The Harriers?" Hull looked up puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Hull, yes!" said Vail. "File Ormson's been busy. The Harriers are
  what's left of the army&mdash;the better citizens of Ormiston. The Master's
  magic didn't reach beyond the ridge, and over the hills there's still powder
  and rifles. And the spell is no longer in the valley, either. One of the men
  carried a cup of powder across the ridge, and it didn't burn."</p>

  <p>The better citizens, Hull thought smiling. She meant, of course, those who
  owned land and feared a division of it such as Marcus Ormiston had suffered.
  But aloud he said only, "How many men have you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there'll be several hundred with the farmers across the hills." She
  looked into his eyes, "I know it's a forlorn hope, Hull, but&mdash;we've got
  to try. You'll help, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. But all your Harriers can attempt is raids. They can't fight
  the Master's army."</p>

  <p>"I know. I know it, Hull. It's a desperate hope."</p>

  <p>"Desperate?" said Enoch suddenly. "Hull, didn't you say you were ordered
  to Black Margot's quarters this evening?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;see here! You'll carry a knife in your armpit. Sooner or later
  she'll want you alone with her, and when that happens, you'll slide the knife
  quietly into her ruthless heart! There's a hope for you&mdash;if you've
  courage!"</p>

  <p>"Courage!" he growled. "To murder a woman "</p>

  <p>"Black Margot's a devil!"</p>

  <p>"Devil or not, what's the good of it? It's Joaquin Smith that's building
  the Empire, not the Princess."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Enoch, "but half his power is the art of the witch. Once she's
  gone the Confederation could blast his army like ducks in a frog pond."</p>

  <p>"It's true!" gasped Vail. "What Enoch says is true!"</p>

  <p>Hull scowled. "I swore not to bear weapons!"</p>

  <p>"Swore to her!" snapped Enoch. "That needn't bind you.</p>

  <p>"My word's given," said Hull firmly. "I do not lie."</p>

  <p>Vail smiled. "You're right," she whispered, and as Enoch's face darkened,
  "I love you for it, Hull."</p>

  <p>"Then," grunted Enoch, "if it's not lack of courage, do this. Lure her
  somehow across the west windows. We can slip two or three Harriers to the
  edge of the woodlot, and if she passes a window with the light behind her
  &mdash;well, they won't miss."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I won't," said Hull wearily. "I won't fight women, nor betray even
  Black Margot to death."</p>

  <p>But Vail's blue eyes pleaded. "That won't be breaking your word, Hull.
  Please. It isn't betraying a woman. She's a sorceress. She's evil. Please,
  Hull."</p>

  <p>Bitterly he yielded. "I'll try, then." He frowned gloomily. "She saved my
  life, and&mdash;Well, which room is her's?"</p>

  <p>"My father's. Mine is the western chamber, which she took for her&mdash;
  her maid," Vail's eyes misted at the indignity of it. "We," she said, "are
  left to sleep in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>An hour later, having eaten, he walked somberly home with Vail while Enoch
  slipped away toward the hills. There were tents in the dooryard, and lights
  glowed in every window, and before the door stood two dark Empire men who
  passed the girl readily enough, but halted Hull with small ceremony. Vail
  cast him a wistful backward glance as she disappeared toward the rear, and he
  submitted grimly to the questioning of the guards.</p>

  <p>"On what business?"</p>

  <p>"To see the Princess Margaret."</p>

  <p>"Are you Hull Tarvish?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>One of the men stepped to his side and ran exploratory hands about his
  body. "Orders of Her Highness," he explained gruffly.</p>

  <p>Hull smiled. The Princess had not trusted his word too implicitly. In a
  moment the fellow had finished his search and swung the door open.</p>

  <p>Hull entered. He had never seen the interior of the house, and for a
  moment its splendor dazzled him. Carved ancient furniture, woven carpets,
  intricately worked standards for the oil lamps, and even&mdash;for an instant
  he failed to comprehend it&mdash;a full-length mirror of ancient workmanship
  wherein his own image faced him. Until now he had seen only bits and
  fragments of mirrors.</p>

  <p>To his left a guard blocked an open door whence voices issued. Old Marcus
  Ormiston's voice. "But I'll pay for it. I'll buy it with all I have." His
  tones were wheedling.</p>

  <p>"No." Cool finality in the voice of Joaquin Smith. "Long ago I swore to
  Martin Sair never to grant immortality to any who have not proved themselves
  worthy." A note of sarcasm edged his voice. "Go prove yourself deserving of
  it, old man, in the few years left to you."</p>

  <p>Hull sniffed contemptuously. There seemed something debased in the old
  man's whining before his conqueror. "The Princess Margaret?" he asked, and
  followed the guard's gesture.</p>

  <p>Upstairs was a dimly lit hall where another guard stood silently. Hull
  repeated his query, but in place of an answer came the liquid tones of
  Margaret herself. "Let him come in, Corlin."</p>

  <p>A screen within the door blocked sight of the room. Hull circled it,
  steeling himself against the memory of that soul-burning loveliness he
  remembered. But his defense was shattered by the shock that awaited him.</p>

  <p>The screen, indeed, shielded the Princess from the sight of the guard in
  the hall, but not from Hull's eyes. He stared utterly appalled at the sight
  of her lying in complete indifference in a great tub of water, while a fat
  woman scrubbed assiduously at her bare body. He could not avoid a single
  glimpse of her exquisite form, then he turned and stared deliberately from
  the east windows, knowing that he was furiously crimson even to his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sit down!" she said contemptuously. "This will be over in a
  moment."</p>

  <p>He kept his eyes averted while water splashed and a towel whisked
  sibilantly. When he heard her footsteps beside him he glanced up tentatively,
  still fearful of what he might see, but she was covered now in a full robe of
  shiny black and gold that made her seem taller, though its filmy delicacy by
  no means concealed what was beneath. Instead of the cothurns she wore when on
  the march, she had slipped her feet into tiny high-heeled sandals that were
  reminiscent of the footgear he had seen in ancient pictures. The black robe
  and her demure coif of short ebony hair gave her an appearance of almost
  nunlike purity, save for the green hell-fires that danced in her eyes.</p>

  <p>In his heart Hull cursed that false aura of innocence, for he felt again
  the fascination against which he had steeled himself.</p>

  <p>"So," she said. "You may sit down again. I do not demand court etiquette
  in the field." She sat opposite, and produced a black cigarette, lighting it
  at the chimney of the lamp on the table. Hull stared; not that he was
  unaccustomed to seeing women smoke, for every mountainy woman had her pipe,
  and every cottage its tobacco patch, but cigarettes were new to him.</p>

  <p>"Now," she said with a faintly ironic smile, "tell me what they say of me
  here."</p>

  <p>"They call you witch."</p>

  <p>"And do they hate me?"</p>

  <p>"Hate you?" he echoed thoughtfully. "At least they will fight you and the
  Master to the last feather on the last arrow."</p>

  <p>"Of course. The young men will fight&mdash;except those that Joaquin has
  bought with the eldarch's lands&mdash;because they know that once within the
  Empire, fighting is no more to be had. No more joyous, thrilling little wars
  between the cities, no more boasting and parading before the pretty
  provincial girls " She paused. "And you, Hull Tarvish&mdash;what do you think
  of me?"</p>

  <p>"I call you witch for other reasons."</p>

  <p>"Other reasons?"</p>

  <p>"There is no magic," said Hull, echoing the words of old Einar in Selui.
  "There is only knowledge."</p>

  <p>The Princess looked narrowly at him. "A wise thought for one of you," she
  murmured, and then, "You came weaponless."</p>

  <p>"I keep my word."</p>

  <p>"You owe me that. I spared your life."</p>

  <p>"And I," declared Hull defiantly, "spared yours. I could have sped an
  arrow through that white throat of yours, there on the church roof. I aimed
  one."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "What held you?"</p>

  <p>"I do not fight women." He winced as he thought of what mission he was on,
  for it belied his words.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said, "was that the eldarch's pretty daughter who cried so
  piteously after you there before the church?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And do you love her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." This was the opening he had sought, but it came bitterly now,
  facing her. He took the opportunity grimly. "I should like to ask one
  favor."</p>

  <p>"Ask it."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see"&mdash;lies were not in him but this was no lie
  &mdash;"the chamber that was to have been our bridal room. The west chamber."
  That might be&mdash;should be&mdash;truth.</p>

  <p>The Princess laughed disdainfully. "Go see it then."</p>

  <p>For a moment he feared, or hoped, perhaps, that she was going to let him
  go alone. Then she rose and followed him to the hall, and to the door of the
  west chamber.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">7. BETRAYAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Hull paused at the door of the west chamber to permit the
  Princess to enter. For the merest fraction of a second her glorious green
  eyes flashed speculatively to his face, then she stepped back. "You first,
  Weed," she commanded.</p>

  <p>He did not hesitate. He turned and strode into the room, hoping that the
  Harrier riflemen, if indeed they lurked in the copse, might recognize his
  mighty figure in time to stay their eager trigger fingers. His scalp prickled
  as he moved steadily across the window, but nothing happened.</p>

  <p>Behind him the Princess laughed softly. "I have lived too long in the aura
  of plot and counterplot in N'Orleans," she said. "I mistrust you without
  cause, honest Hull Tarvish."</p>

  <p>Her words tortured him. He turned to see her black robe mold itself to her
  body as she moved, and, as sometimes happens in moments of stress, he caught
  an instantaneous picture of her with his senses so quickened that it seemed
  as if she, himself, and the world were frozen into immobility. He remembered
  her forever as she was then, with her limbs in the act of striding, her green
  eyes soft in the lamplight, and her perfect lips in a smile that had a
  coloring of wistfulness. Witch and devil she might be, but she looked like a
  dark-haired angel, and in that moment his spirit revolted.</p>

  <p>"No!" he bellowed, and sprang toward her, striking her slim shoulders with
  both hands in a thrust that sent her staggering back into the hallway, there
  to sit hard and suddenly on the floor beside the amazed guard.</p>

  <p>She sprang up instantly, and there was nothing angelic now in 'her face.
  "You&mdash;hurt me!" she hissed. "Me! Now, I'll&mdash;" She snatched the
  guard's weapon from his belt, thrust it full at Hull's chest, and sent the
  blue beam humming upon him.</p>

  <p>It was pain far worse than that at Eaglefoot Flow. He bore it stolidly,
  grinding into silence the groan that rose in his throat, and in a moment she
  flicked it off and slapped it angrily into the guard's holster. "Treachery
  again!" she said. "I won't kill you, Hull Tarvish. I know a better way." She
  whirled toward the stair-well. "Lebeau!" she called. "Lebeau! There's
  &mdash;" She glanced sharply at Hull, and continued, <i>"II y a des
  tirailleurs dans le bois. Je vais les tirer en avant!"</i>* It was the French
  of N'Orleans, as incomprehensible to Hull as Aramaic.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* There are some snipers in the woods. I'm going to
  shoot them first! ]</p>

  <p>She spun back. "Sora!" she snapped, and then, as the fat woman appeared,
  "Never mind. You're far too heavy." Then back to Hull. "I've a mind," she
  blazed, "to strip the Weed clothes from the eldarch's daughter and send her
  marching across the window!"</p>

  <p>He was utterly appalled. "She&mdash;she was in town!" he gasped, then fell
  silent at the sound of feet below.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's no time," she retorted. "So, if I must&mdash;" She strode
  steadily into the west chamber, paused a moment, and then stepped
  deliberately in front of the window!</p>

  <p>Hull was aghast. He watched her stand so that the lamplight must have cast
  her perfect silhouette full on the pane, stand tense and motionless for the
  fraction of a breath, and then leap back so sharply that her robe billowed
  away from her body.</p>

  <p>She had timed it to perfection. Two shots crashed almost together, and the
  glass shattered. And then, out in the night, a dozen beams crisscrossed, and,
  thin and clear in the silence after the shots, a yell of mortal anguish
  drifted up, and another, and a third.</p>

  <p>"There are snipers in the copse. I'll draw them out!"</p>

  <p>The Princess Margaret smiled in malice, and licked a crimson drop from a
  finger gashed by flying glass. "Your treachery reacts," she said in the tones
  of a sneer. "Instead of my betrayal, you have betrayed your own men."</p>

  <p>"I need no accusation from you," he said gloomily. "I am my own accuser,
  and my own judge. Yes, and my own executioner as well. I will not live a
  traitor."</p>

  <p>She raised her dainty eyebrows, and blew a puff of grey smoke from the
  cigarette still in her hand. "So strong Hull Tarvish will die a suicide," she
  remarked indifferently. "I had intended to kill you now. Should I leave you
  to be your own victim?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged. "What matter to me?"</p>

  <p>"Well," she said musingly, "you're rather more entertaining than I had
  expected. You're strong, you're stubborn, and you're dangerous. I give you
  the right to do what you wish with your own life, but"&mdash;her green eyes
  flickered mockingly&mdash;"if I were Hull Tarvish, I should live on the
  chance of justifying myself. You can wipe out the disgrace of your weakness
  by an equal courage. You can sell your life in your own cause, and who knows?
  &mdash;perhaps for Joaquin's&mdash;or mine!"</p>

  <p>He chose to ignore the mockery in her voice. "Perhaps," he said grimly, "I
  will."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, did you weaken, Hull Tarvish? You might have had my life."</p>

  <p>"I do not fight women," he said despondently. "I looked at you&mdash;and
  turned weak." A question formed in his mind. "But why did you risk your life
  before the window? You could have had fifty woods runners scour the copse.
  That was brave, but unnecessary."</p>

  <p>She smiled, but there was a shrewd narrowness in her eyes. "Because so
  many of these villages are built above the underground ways of the Ancients
  &mdash;the subways, the sewers. How did I know but that your assassins might
  slip into some burrow and escape? It was necessary to lure them into
  disclosure."</p>

  <p>Hull shadowed the gleam that shot into his own eyes. He remembered
  suddenly the ancient sewer in which the child Vail had wandered, whose
  entrance was hidden by blackberry bushes. Then the Empire men were unaware of
  it! He visioned the Harriers creeping through it with bow and sword&mdash;
  yes, and rifle, now that the spell was off the valley&mdash;springing
  suddenly into the center of the camp, finding the Master's army, sleeping,
  disorganized, unwary. What a plan for a surprise attack!</p>

  <p>"Your Highness," he said grimly, "I think of suicide no more, and unless
  you kill me now, I will be a bitter enemy to your Empire army."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps less bitter than you think," she said softly. "See, Hull, the
  only three that know of your weakness are dead. No one can name you traitor
  or weakling."</p>

  <p>"But I can," he returned somberly. "And you."</p>

  <p>"Not I, Hull," she murmured. "I never blame a man who weakens because of
  me&mdash;there have been many. Men as strong as you, Hull, and some that the
  world still calls great." She turned toward her own chamber. "Come in here,"
  she said in altered tones. "I will have some wine. Sora!" As the fat woman
  padded off, she took another cigarette and lit it above the lamp, wrinkling
  her dainty nose distastefully at the night-flying insects that circled
  it.</p>

  <p>"What a place!" she snapped impatiently.</p>

  <p>"It is the finest house I have ever seen," said Hull stolidly.</p>

  <p>She laughed. "It's a hovel. I sigh for the day we return to N'Orleans,
  where windows are screened, where water flows hot at will, where lights do
  not flicker as yellow oil lamps nor send heat to stifle one. Would you like
  to see the Great City, Hull?"</p>

  <p>"You know I would."</p>

  <p>"What if I say you may?"</p>

  <p>"What could keep me from it if I go in peace?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged. "Oh, you can visit N'Orleans, of course, but suppose I
  offered you the chance to go as the&mdash;the guest, we'll say, of the
  Princess Margaret. What would you give for that privilege?"</p>

  <p>Was she mocking him again? "What would you ask for it?" he rejoined
  guardedly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, your allegiance, perhaps. Or perhaps the betrayal of your little band
  of Harriers, who will be the devil's own nuisance to stamp out of these
  hills."</p>

  <p>He looked up startled that she knew the name. "The Harriers? How?"</p>

  <p>She smiled. "We have friends among the Ormiston men. Friends bought with
  land," she added contemptuously. "But what of my offer, Hull?"</p>

  <p>He scowled. "You say as your guest. What am I to understand by that?"</p>

  <p>She leaned across the table, her exquisite green eyes on his, her hair
  flaming blue-black, her perfect lips in a faint smile. "What you please,
  Hull. Whatever you please."</p>

  <p>Anger was rising. "Do you mean," he asked huskily, "that you'd do that for
  so small a thing as the destruction of a little enemy band? You, with the
  whole Empire at your back?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "It saves trouble, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"And honesty, virtue, honor, mean as little to you as that? Is this one of
  your usual means of conquest? Do you ordinarily sell your&mdash;your favors
  for&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Not ordinarily," she interrupted coolly. "First I must like my co-partner
  in the trade. You, Hull&mdash;I like those vast muscles Of yours, and your
  stubborn courage, and your slow, clear mind. You are not a great man, Hull,
  for your mind has not the cold fire of genius, but you are a strong one, and
  I like you for it."</p>

  <p>"Like me!" he roared, starting up in his chair. "Yet you think I'll trade
  what honor's left me for&mdash;that! You think I'll betray my cause! You
  think&mdash;Well, you're wrong, that's all. You're wrong!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, smiling. "No. I wasn't wrong, for I thought you
  wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did!" he snarled. "Then what if I'd accepted? What would you have
  done then?"</p>

  <p>"What I promised." She laughed at his angry, incredulous face. "Don't look
  so shocked, Hull. I'm not little Vail Ormiston. I'm the Princess Margaret of
  N'Orleans, called Margaret the Divine by those who love me, and by those who
  hate me called&mdash;Well, you must know what my enemies call me."</p>

  <p>"I do!" he blazed. "Black Margot, I do!"</p>

  <p>"Black Margot!" she echoed smiling. "Yes, so called because a poet once
  amused me, and because there was once a very ancient, very great French poet
  named Franois Villon, who loved a harlot called Black Margot." She sighed.
  "But my poet was no Villon; already his works are nearly forgotten."</p>

  <p>"A good name!" he rasped. "A good name for you!"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless. But you fail to understand, Hull. I'm an Immortal. My years
  are three times yours. Would you have me follow the standards of death-bound
  Vail Ormiston?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! By what right are you superior to all standards?"</p>

  <p>Her lips had ceased to smile, and her deep green eyes turned wistful. "By
  the right that I can act in no other way, Hull," she said softly. A tinge of
  emotion quavered in her voice. "Immortality!" she whispered. "Year after year
  after year of sameness, tramping up and down the world on conquest! What do I
  care for conquest? I have no sense of destiny like Joaquin, who sees before
  him Empire&mdash;Empire&mdash;Empire, ever larger, ever growing. What's
  Empire to me? And year by year I grow bored until fighting, killing, danger,
  and love are all that keep me breathing!"</p>

  <p>His anger had drained away. He was staring at her aghast, appalled.</p>

  <p>"And then they fail me!" she murmured. "When killing palls and love grows
  stale, what's left? Did I say love? How can there be love for me when I know
  that if I love a man, it will be only to watch him age and turn wrinkled,
  weak, and flabby? And when I beg Joaquin for immortality for him, he flaunts
  before me that promise of his to Martin Sair, to grant it only to those
  already proved worthy. By the time a man's worthy he's old." She went on
  tensely, "I tell you, Hull, that I'm so friendless and alone that I envy you
  death-bound ones! Yes, and one of these days I'll join you!"</p>

  <p>He gulped. "My God!" he muttered. "Better for you if you'd stayed in your
  native mountains with friends, home, husband, and children."</p>

  <p>"Children!" she echoed, her eyes misting with tears. "Immortals can't have
  children. They're sterile; they should be nothing but brains like Joaquin and
  Martin Sair, not beings with feelings&mdash;like me. Sometimes I curse Martin
  Sair and his hard rays. I don't want immortality; I want life!"</p>

  <p>Hull found his mind in a whirl. The impossible beauty of the girl he
  faced, her green eyes now soft and moist and unhappy, her lips quivering, the
  glisten of a tear on her cheek&mdash;these things tore at him so powerfully
  that he scarcely knew his own allegiance. "God!" he whispered. "I'm
  sorry!"</p>

  <p>"And you, Hull&mdash;will you help me&mdash;a little?"</p>

  <p>"But we're enemies&mdash;enemies!"</p>

  <p>"Can't we be&mdash;something else?" A sob shook her.</p>

  <p>"How can we be?" he groaned.</p>

  <p>Suddenly some quirk to her dainty lips caught his attention. He stared
  incredulously into the green depths of her eyes. It was true. There was
  laughter there. She had been mocking him! And as she perceived his
  realization, her soft laughter rippled like rain on water.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;devil!" he choked. "You black witch! I wish I'd let you be
  killed!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she said demurely. "Look at me, Hull."</p>

  <p>The command was needless. He couldn't take his fascinated gaze from her
  exquisite face.</p>

  <p>"Do you love me, Hull?"</p>

  <p>"I love Vail Ormiston," he rasped.</p>

  <p>"But do you love me?"</p>

  <p>"I hate you!"</p>

  <p>"But do you love me as well?"</p>

  <p>He groaned. "This is bitterly unfair," he muttered.</p>

  <p>She knew what he meant. He as crying out against the circumstances that
  had brought the Princess Margaret&mdash;the most brilliant woman of all that
  brilliant age, and one of the most brilliant of any age&mdash;to flash all
  her fascination on a simple mountainy from Ozarky. It wasn't fair; her smile
  admitted it, but there was triumph there, too.</p>

  <p>"May I go?" he asked stonily.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "But you will be a little less my enemy, won't you, Hull?"</p>

  <p>He rose. "Whatever harm I can do your cause," he said, "that harm will I
  do. I will not be twice a traitor." But he fancied a puzzling gleam of
  satisfaction in her green eyes at his words.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">8. TORMENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Hull looked down at noon over Ormiston valley, where Joaquin
  Smith was marching. At his side Vail paused, and together they gazed silently
  over Selui road, now black with riding men and rumbling wagons on their way
  to attack the remnant of the Confederation army in Selui. But Ormiston was
  not entirely abandoned, for three hundred soldiers and two hundred horsemen
  remained to deal with the Harriers, under Black Margot herself. It was not
  the policy of the Master to permit so large a rebel band to gather unopposed
  in conquered territory; within the Empire, despite the mutual hatred among
  rival cities, there existed a sort of enforced peace.</p>

  <p>"Our moment comes tonight," Hull said soberly. "We'll never have a better
  chance than now, with our numbers all but equal to theirs, and surprise on
  our side."</p>

  <p>Vail nodded. "The ancient tunnel was a bold thought, Hull. The Harriers
  are shoring up the crumbled places. Father is with them."</p>

  <p>"He shouldn't be. The aged have no place in the field."</p>

  <p>"But this is his hope, Hull. He lives for this."</p>

  <p>"Small enough hope! Suppose we're successful, Vail. What will it mean save
  the return of Joaquin Smith and his army? Common sense tells me this is a
  fool's hunt, and if it were not for you and the chance of fairer fighting
  than we've had until now&mdash;well, I'd be tempted to concede the Master his
  victory."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" cried Vail. "If our success means the end of Black Margot, isn't
  that enough? Besides, you know that half the Master's powers are the work of
  the witch. Enoch&mdash;poor Enoch&mdash;said so."</p>

  <p>Hull winced. Enoch had been one of the three marksmen slain outside the
  west windows, and the girl's words brought memory of his own part in that.
  But her words pricked painfully in yet another direction, for the vision of
  the Princess that had plagued him all night long still rose powerfully in his
  mind, nor could he face the mention of her death unmoved.</p>

  <p>But Vail read only distress for Enoch in his face. "Enoch," she repeated
  softly. "He loved me in his sour way, Hull, but once I had known you, I had
  no thoughts for him."</p>

  <p>Hull slipped his arm about her, cursing himself that he could not steal
  his thought away from Margaret of N'Orleans, because it was Vail he loved,
  and Vail he wanted to love. Whatever spell the Princess had cast about him,
  he knew her to be evil, ruthless, and inhumanly cold&mdash;a sorceress, a
  devil. But he could not blot her Satanic loveliness from his inward gaze.</p>

  <p>"Well," he sighed, "let it be tonight, then. Was it four hours past
  sunset? Good. The Empire men should be sleeping or gaming in Tigh's tavern by
  that time. It's for us to pray for our gunpowder."</p>

  <p>"Gunpowder? Oh, but didn't you hear what I told File Ormson and the
  Harriers, back there on the ridge? The casters of the spell are gone; Joaquin
  Smith has taken them to Selui. I watched and listened from the kitchen this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"The sparkers? They're gone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They called them reson&mdash;resators &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Resonators," said Hull, recalling Old Einar's words.</p>

  <p>"Something like that. There were two of them, great iron barrels on
  swivels, full of some humming and clicking magic, and they swept the valley
  north and south, and east and west, and over toward Norse there was the sound
  of shots and the smoke of a burning building. They loaded them on wagons and
  dragged them away toward Selui."</p>

  <p>"They didn't cross the ridge with their spell," said Hull.* "The Harriers
  still have powder."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The field of the Erden resonator passes readily
  through structures and walls, but it is blocked by any considerable natural
  obstructions, hills, and for some reason fog-banks or low clouds. ]</p>

  <p>"Yes," murmured Vail, drawing his arm closer about her. "Tell me," she
  said suddenly, "what did she want of you last night?"</p>

  <p>Hull grimaced. He had told Vail little enough of that discreditable
  evening, and he had been fearing her question. "Treason," he said finally.
  "She wanted me to betray the Harriers."</p>

  <p>"You? She asked that of you?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think I would?" countered Hull.</p>

  <p>"I know you never would. But what did she offer you for betrayal?"</p>

  <p>Again he hesitated. "A great reward," he answered at last. "A reward out
  of all proportion to the task."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Hull, what is she like face to face?"</p>

  <p>"A demon. She isn't exactly human."</p>

  <p>"But in what way? Men say so much of her beauty, of her deadly charm. Hull
  &mdash;did you feel it?"</p>

  <p>"I love you, Vail."</p>

  <p>She sighed, and drew yet closer. "I think you're the strongest man in the
  world, Hull. The very strongest."</p>

  <p>"I'll need to be," he muttered, staring gloomily over the valley. Then he
  smiled faintly as he saw men plowing, for it was late in the season for such
  occupation. Old Marcus Ormiston was playing safe; remembering the Master's
  words, he was tilling every acre across which a horse could drag a blade.</p>

  <p>Vail left him in Ormiston village and took her way hesitantly homeward.
  Hull did what he could about the idle shop, and when the sun slanted low,
  bought himself a square loaf of brown bread, a great slice of cheese, and a
  bottle of the still, clear wine of the region. It was just as he finished his
  meal in his room that a pounding on the door of the shop summoned him.</p>

  <p>It was an Empire man. "Hull Tarvish?" he asked shortly. At Hull's nod he
  continued, "From Her Highness," and handed him a folded slip of black
  paper.</p>

  <p>The mountain youth stared at it. On one side, in raised gold, was the form
  of a serpent circling a globe, its tail in its mouth&mdash;the Midgard
  Serpent. He slipped a finger through the fold, opened the message, and
  squinted helplessly at the characters written in gold on the black inner
  surface.</p>

  <p>"This scratching means nothing to me," he said.</p>

  <p>The Empire man sniffed contemptuously. "I'll read it," he said, taking the
  missive. "It says, 'Follow the messenger to our quarters,' and it's signed
  Margarita Imperii Regina, which means Margaret, Princess of the Empire. Is
  that plain?" He handed back the note. "I've been looking an hour for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I won't go," growled Hull.</p>

  <p>"This isn't an invitation, Weed. It's a command."</p>

  <p>Hull shrugged. He had small inclination to face Black Margot again,
  especially with his knowledge of the Harriers' plans. Her complex personality
  baffled and fascinated him, and he could not help fearing that somehow, by
  some subtle art, she might wring that secret from him. Torture wouldn't force
  it out of him, but those green eyes might read it. Yet&mdash;better to go
  quietly than be dragged or driven; he grunted assent and followed the
  messenger.</p>

  <p>He found the house quiet. The lower room where Joaquin Smith had rested
  was empty now, and he mounted the stairs again steeling himself against the
  expected shock of Black Margot's presence. This time, however, he found her
  clothed, or half clothed by Ormiston standards, for she wore only the
  diminutive shorts and shirt that were her riding costume, and her dainty feet
  were bare. She sat in a deep chair beside the table, a flagon of wine at hand
  and a black cigarette in her fingers. Her jet hair was like a helmet of ebony
  against the ivory of her forehead and throat, and her green eyes like twin
  emeralds.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," she said as he stood before her. "The delay is your loss,
  Hull. I would have dined with you."</p>

  <p>"I grow strong enough on bread and cheese," he growled.</p>

  <p>"You seem to." Fire danced in her eyes. "Hull, I am as strong as most men,
  but I believe those vast muscles of yours could overpower me as if I were
  some shrinking provincial girl. And yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And yet what?"</p>

  <p>"And yet you are much like my black stallion Eblis. Your muscles are
  nearly as strong, but like him, I can goad you, drive you, lash you, and set
  you galloping in whatever direction I choose."</p>

  <p>"Can you?" he snapped. "Don't try it." But the spell of her unearthly
  beauty was hard to face.</p>

  <p>"But I think I shall try it," she cooed gently. "Hull, do you ever
  lie?"</p>

  <p>"I do not."</p>

  <p>"Shall I make you lie, then, Hull? Shall I make you swear such falsehoods
  that you will redden forever afterward at the thought of them? Shall I?"</p>

  <p>"You can't!"</p>

  <p>She smiled, then in altered tones, "Do you love me, Hull?"</p>

  <p>"Love you? I hate&mdash;" He broke off suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Do you hate me, Hull?" she asked gently.</p>

  <p>"No," he groaned at last. "No, I don't hate you."</p>

  <p>"But do you love me?" Her face was saint-like, earnest, pure, even the
  green eyes were soft now as the green of spring. "Tell me, do you love
  me?"</p>

  <p>"No!" he ground out savagely, then flushed crimson at the smile on her
  lips. "That isn't a lie!" he blazed. "This sorcery of yours isn't love. I
  don't love your beauty. It's unnatural, hellish, and the gift of Martin Sair.
  It's a false beauty, like your whole life!"</p>

  <p>"Martin Sair had little to do with my appearance," she said gently. "What
  do you 'feel for me, Hull, if not love?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;don't know. I don't want to think of it!" He clenched a great
  fist. "Love? Call it love if you wish, but it's a hell's love that would find
  satisfaction in killing you!" But here his heart revolted again. "That isn't
  so," he ended miserably. "I couldn't kill you."</p>

  <p>"Suppose," she proceeded gently, "I were to promise to abandon Joaquin, to
  be no longer Black Margot and Princess of the Empire, but to be only&mdash;
  Hull Tarvish's wife. Between Vail and me, which would you choose?"</p>

  <p>He said nothing' for a moment. "You're unfair," he said bitterly at last.
  "Is it fair to compare Vail and yourself? She's sweet and loyal and innocent,
  but you&mdash;you are Black Margot!"</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," she said calmly, "I think I shall compare us. Sora!" The
  fat woman appeared. "Sora, the wine is gone. Send the eldarch's daughter here
  with another bottle and a second goblet."</p>

  <p>Hull stared appalled. "What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"No harm to your little Weed. I promise no harm."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" He paused. Vail's footsteps sounded on the stairs, and she
  entered timidly, bearing a tray with a bottle and a metal goblet. He saw her
  start as she perceived him, but she only advanced quietly, set the tray on
  the table, and backed toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," said the Princess. She rose and moved to Vail's side as
  if to force the comparison on Hull. He could not avoid it; he hated himself
  for the thought, but it came regardless. Barefooted, the Princess Margaret
  was exactly the height of Vail in her lowheeled sandals, and she was the
  merest shade slimmer. But her startling black hair and her glorious green
  eyes seemed almost to fade the unhappy Ormiston girl to a colorless dun, and
  the coppery hair and blue eyes seemed water pale. It wasn't fair; Hull
  realized that it was like comparing candlelight to sunbeam, and he despised
  himself even for gazing.</p>

  <p>"Hull," said the Princess, "which of us is the more beautiful ?"</p>

  <p>He saw Vail's lips twitch fearfully, and he remained stubbornly
  silent.</p>

  <p>"Hull," resumed the Princess, "which of us do you love?"</p>

  <p>"I love Vail!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"But do you love her more than you love me?"</p>

  <p>Once again he had recourse to silence.</p>

  <p>"I take it," said the Princess, smiling, "that your silence means you love
  me the more. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>He said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Or am I wrong, Hull? Surely you can give little Vail the satisfaction of
  answering this question! For unless you answer I shall take the liberty of
  assuming that you love me the more. Now do you?"</p>

  <p>He was in utter torment. His white lips twisted in anguish as he muttered
  finally, "Oh, God! Then yes!"</p>

  <p>She smiled softly. "You may go," she said to the pallid and frightened
  Vail.</p>

  <p>But for a moment the girl hesitated. "Hull," she whispered, "Hull, I know
  you said that to save me. I don't believe it, Hull, and I love you. I blame
  &mdash;her!"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" he groaned. "Don't insult her."</p>

  <p>The Princess laughed, "Insult me! Do you think I could be insulted by a
  bit of creeping dust as it crawls its way from cradle to grave?" She turned
  contemptuous green eyes on Vail as the terrified girl backed through the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Why do you delight in torture?" cried Hull. "You're cruel as a cat.
  You're no less than a demon."</p>

  <p>"That wasn't cruelty," said the Princess gently. "It was but a means of
  proving what I said, that your mighty muscles are well-broken to my
  saddle."</p>

  <p>"If that needed proof," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"It needed none. There's proof enough, Hull, in what's happening even now,
  if I judge the time rightly. I mean your Harriers slipping through their
  ancient sewer right into my trap behind the barn."</p>

  <p>He was thunderstruck. "You&mdash;are you&mdash;you must be a witch!" he
  gasped.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. But it wasn't witchcraft that led me to put the thought of that
  sewer into your head, Hull. Do you remember now that it was my suggestion,
  given last evening there in the hallway? I knew quite well that you'd put the
  bait before the Harriers."</p>

  <p>His brain was reeling. "But why&mdash;Why&mdash;?"</p><br>

  <p>"Oh," she said indifferently, "it amuses me to see you play the traitor
  twice, Hull Tarvish."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">9. THE TRAP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The princess stepped close to him, her magnificent eyes
  gentle as an angel's, the sweet curve of her lips in the ghost of a pouting
  smile. "Poor, strong, weak Hull Tarvish!" she breathed. "Now you shall have a
  lesson in the cost of weakness. I am not Joaquin, who fights benignly with
  his men's slides in the third notch. When I go to battle, my beams flash
  full, and there is burning flesh and bursting heart. Death rides with
  me."</p>

  <p>He scarcely heard her. His gyrating mind struggled with an idea. The
  Harriers were creeping singly into the trap, but they could not all be
  through the tunnel. If he could warn them&mdash;His eyes shifted to the
  bell-pull in the hall beside the guard, the rope that tolled the bronze bell
  in the belfry to summon public gatherings, or to call aid to fight fires.
  Death, beyond doubt, if he rang it, but that was only a fair price to pay for
  expiation.</p>

  <p>His great arm flashed suddenly, sweeping the Princess from her feet and
  crashing her dainty figure violently against the wall. He heard her faint "O
  &mdash;o&mdash;oh" of pain as breath left her and she dropped slowly to her
  knees, but he was already upon the startled guard, thrusting him up and over
  the rail of the stair-well to drop with a sullen thumb below. And then he
  threw his weight on the bellrope, and the great voice of bronze boomed out,
  again, and again.</p>

  <p>But Black Margot was on her feet, with the green hell-sparks flickering in
  her eyes and her face a lovely mask of fury. Men came rushing up the stairs
  with drawn weapons, and Hull gave a last tug on the rope and turned to face
  death. Half a dozen weapons were on him.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no!" gasped the Princess, struggling for the breath he had
  knocked out of her. "Hold him&mdash;for me! Take him&mdash;to the barn!"</p>

  <p>She darted down the stairway, her graceful legs flashing bare, her bare
  feet padding softly. After her six grim Empire men thrust Hull past the dazed
  guard sitting on the lower steps and out into a night where blue beams
  flashed and shots and yells sounded.</p>

  <p>Behind the barn was comparative quiet, however, by the time Hull's captors
  had marched him there. A close-packed mass of dark figures huddled near the
  mouth of the ancient tunnel, where the bushes were trampled away, and a
  brown-clad file of Empire woods runners surrounded them. A few figures lay
  sprawled on the turf, and Hull smiled a little as he saw that some were
  Empire men. Then his eyes strayed to the Princess where she faced a
  dark-haired officer.</p>

  <p>"How many, Lebeau?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred and forty or fifty, Your Highness."</p>

  <p>"Not half! Why are you not pursuing the rest through the tunnel?"</p>

  <p>"Because, Your Highness, one of them pulled the shoring and the roof down
  upon himself, and blocked us off. We're digging him out now."</p>

  <p>"By then they'll have left their burrow. Where does this tunnel end?" She
  strode over to Hull. "Hull, where does this tunnel end?" At his silence, she
  added. "No matter. They'd be through it before we could reach it." She spun
  back. "Lebeau! Burn down what we have and the rest we'll stamp out as we
  can." A murmur ran through the crowd of villagers that was collecting, and
  her eyes, silvery green in the moonlight, flickered over them. "And any
  sympathizers," she added coldly. "Except this man, Hull Tarvish."</p>

  <p>File Ormson's great voice rumbled out of the mass of prisoners. "Hull!
  Hull! Was this trap your doing?"</p>

  <p>Hull made no answer, but Black Margot herself replied. "No," she snapped,
  "but the warning bell was."</p>

  <p>"Then why do you spare him?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes glittered icy green. "To kill in my own way, Weed," she said in
  tones so cold that it was as if a winter wind had sent a shivering breath
  across the spring night. "I have my own account to collect from him."</p>

  <p>Her eyes blazed chill emerald fire into Hull's. He met her glance
  squarely, and said in a low voice, "Do you grant any favors to a man about to
  die?"</p>

  <p>"Not by custom," she replied indifferently. "Is it the safety of the
  eldarch's daughter? I plan no harm to her."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that."</p>

  <p>"Then ask it&mdash;though I am not disposed to grant favors to you, Hull
  Tarvish, who have twice laid hands of violence on me."</p>

  <p>His voice dropped almost to a whisper. "It is the lives of my companions I
  ask."</p>

  <p>She raised here eyebrows in surprise, then shook her ebony flame of hair.
  "How can I? I remained here purposely to wipe them out. Shall I release the
  half I have, only to destroy them with the rest?"</p>

  <p>"I ask their lives," he repeated.</p>

  <p>A curious, whimsical fire danced green in her eves. "I will try," she
  promised, and turned to the officer, who was ranging his men so that the
  cross-fire of execution could not mow down his own ranks. "Lebeau!" she
  snapped. "Hold back a while."</p>

  <p>She strode into the gap between the prisoners and her own men. Hand on hip
  she surveyed the Harriers, while moonlight lent her beauty an aura that was
  incredible, unearthly. There in the dusk of night she seemed no demon at all,
  but a girl, almost a child, and even Hull, who had learned well enough what
  she was, could not but sweep fascinated eyes from her jet hair to her tiny
  white feet.</p>

  <p>"Now," she said, passing her glance over the group, on my promise of
  amnesty, how many of you would join me?"</p>

  <p>A stir ran through the mass. For a moment there was utter immobility,
  then, very slowly, two figures moved forward, and the stir became an angry
  murmur. Hull recognized the men; they were stragglers of the Confederation
  army, Ch'cago men, good fighters but merely mercenaries, changing sides as
  mood or advantage moved them. The murmur of the Harriers became an angry
  growl.</p>

  <p>"You two," said the Princess, "are you Ormiston men?"</p>

  <p>"No," said one. "Both of us come from the shores of Mitchin."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she proceeded calmly. With a movement swift as arrow flight
  she snatched the weapon from her belt, the blue beam spat twice, and the men
  crumpled, one with face burned carbon-black, and both sending forth an
  odorous wisp of flesh-seared smoke.</p>

  <p>She faced the aghast group. "Now," she said, "Who is your leader?"</p>

  <p>File Ormson stepped forth, scowling and grim. "What do you want of
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Will you treat with me? Will your men follow your agreements?"</p>

  <p>File nodded. "They have small choice."</p>

  <p>"Good. Now that I have sifted the traitors from your ranks&mdash;for I
  will not deal with traitors&mdash;I shall make my offer." She smiled at the
  squat ironsmith. "I think I've served both of us by so doing," she said
  softly, and Hull gasped as he perceived the sweetness of the glance she bent
  on the scowling File. "Would you, with your great muscles and warrior's
  heart, follow a woman?"</p>

  <p>The scowl vanished in surprise. "Follow you? You?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Hull watched her in fascination as she used her voice, her eyes,
  her unearthly beauty intensified by the moonlight, all on hulking File
  Ormson, behind whom the Harrier prisoners stood tense and silent. "Yes, I
  mean to follow me," she repeated softly. "You are brave men, all of you, now
  that I have weeded out the two cowards." She smiled wistfully, almost
  tenderly at the squat figure before her. "And you&mdash;you are a
  warrior."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" File gulped, "our others&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I promise you need not fight against your companions. I will release any
  of you who will not follow me. And your lands&mdash;it is your lands you
  fight for, is it not? I will not touch, not one acre save the eldarch's." She
  paused. "Well?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly File's booming laugh roared out. "By God!" he swore. "If you mean
  what you say, there's nothing to fight about! For my part, I'm with you!" He
  turned on his men. "Who follows me?"</p>

  <p>The group stirred. A few stepped forward, then a few more, and then, with
  a shout, the whole mass. "Good!" roared File. He raised his great hard hand
  to his heart in the Empire salute. "To Black&mdash;to the Princess Margaret!"
  he bellowed. "To a warrior!"</p>

  <p>She smiled and dropped her eyes as if in modesty. When the cheer had
  passed, she addressed File Ormson again. "You will send men to your others?"
  she asked. "Let them come in on the same terms."</p>

  <p>"They'll come!" growled File.</p>

  <p>The Princess nodded. "Lebeau," she called, "order off your men. These are
  our allies."</p>

  <p>The Harriers began to separate, drifting away with the crowd of villagers.
  The Princess stepped close to Hull, smiling maliciously up into his perplexed
  face. He scarcely knew whether to be glad or bitter, for indeed, though she
  had granted his request to spare his companions, she had granted it only at
  the cost of the destruction of the cause for which he had sacrificed
  everything. There were no Harriers any more, but he was still to die for
  them.</p>

  <p>"Will you die happy now?" she cooed softly.</p>

  <p>"No man dies happy," he growled.</p>

  <p>"I granted your wish, Hull."</p>

  <p>"If your promises can be trusted," he retorted bitterly. "You lied coolly
  enough to the Ch'cago men, and you made certain they were not loved by the
  Harriers before you killed them."</p>

  <p>She shrugged. "I lie, I cheat, I swindle by whatever means comes to hand,"
  she said indifferently, "but I do not break my given word. The Harriers are
  safe."</p>

  <p>Beyond her, men came suddenly from the tunnel mouth, dragging something
  dark behind them.</p>

  <p>"The Weed who pulled down the roof, Your Highness," said Lebeau.</p>

  <p>She glanced behind her, and pursed her dainty lips in surprise. "The
  eldarch! The dotard died bravely enough." Then she shrugged. "He had but a
  few more years anyway."</p>

  <p>But Vail slipped by with a low moan of anguish, and Hull watched her kneel
  desolately by her father's body. A spasm of pity shook him as he realized
  that now she was utterly, completely alone. Enoch had died in the ambush of
  the previous night, old Marcus lay dead here before her, and he was condemned
  to death. The three who loved her and the man she loved&mdash;all slain in
  two nights passing. He bent a slow, helpless, pitying smile on her, but there
  was nothing he could do or say.</p>

  <p>And Black Margot, after the merest glance, turned back to Hull, "Now," she
  said, the ice in her voice again, "I deal with you!"</p>

  <p>He faced her dumbly. "Will you have the mercy to deal quickly, then?" he
  muttered at last.</p>

  <p>"Mercy? I do not know the word where you're concerned, Hull. Or rather I
  have been already too merciful. I spared your life three times&mdash;once at
  Joaquin's request at Eaglefoot Flow, once before the guardhouse, and once up
  there in the hallway." She moved closer. "I cannot bear the touch of
  violence, Hull, and you have laid violent hands on me twice. Twice!"</p>

  <p>"Once was to save your life," he said, "and the other to rectify my own
  unwitting treason. And I spared your life three times too, Black Margot
  &mdash;once when I aimed from the church roof, once from the ambush in the
  west chamber, and once but a half hour ago, for I could have killed you with
  this fist of mine, had I wished to strike hard enough. I owe you
  nothing."</p>

  <p>She smiled coldly. "Well argued, Hull, but you die none the less in the
  way I wish." She turned. "Back to the house!" she commanded, and he strode
  away between the six guards who still flanked him.</p>

  <p>She led them into the lower room that had been the Master's. There she sat
  idly in a deep chair of ancient craftsmanship, lit a black cigarette at the
  lamp, and thrust her slim legs carelessly before her, gazing at Hull. But he,
  staring through the window behind her, could see the dark blot that was Vail
  Ormiston weeping beside the body of her father.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the Princess, "how would you like to die, Hull.</p>

  <p>Of old age!" he snapped. "And if you will not permit that, then as quickly
  as possible."</p>

  <p>"I might grant the second," she observed. "I might."</p>

  <p>The thought of Vail was still torturing him. At last he said, "Your
  Highness, is your courage equal to the ordeal of facing me alone? I want to
  ask something that I will not ask in others' ears."</p>

  <p>She laughed contemptuously. "Get out," she snapped at the silent guards.
  "Hull, do you think I fear you? I tell you your great muscles and stubborn
  heart are no more than those of Eblis, the black stallion. Must I prove it
  again to you?"</p>

  <p>"No," he muttered. "God help me, but I know it's true. I'm not the match
  for Black Margot."</p>

  <p>"Nor is any other man," she countered. Then, more softly, "But if ever I
  do meet the man who can conquer me, if ever he exists, he will have something
  of you in him, Hull. Your great, slow strength, and your stubborn honesty,
  and your courage. I promise that." She paused, her face now pure as a marble
  saint's. "So say what you have to say, Hull. What do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"My life," he said bluntly.</p>

  <p>Her green eyes widened in surprise. "You, Hull? You beg your life?
  You?"</p>

  <p>"Not for myself," he muttered. "There's Vail Ormiston weeping over her
  father. Enoch, who would have married her and loved her, is dead in last
  night's ambush, and if I die, she's left alone. I ask my life for her."</p>

  <p>"Her troubles mean nothing to me," said Margaret of N'Orleans coldly.</p>

  <p>"She'll die without someone&mdash;someone to help her through this time of
  torment."</p>

  <p>"Let her die, then. Why do you death-bound cling so desperately to life,
  only to age and die anyway? Sometimes I myself would welcome death, and I
  have infinitely more to live for than you. Let her die, Hull, as I think
  you'll die in the next moment or so!"</p>

  <p>Her hand rested on the stock of the weapon at her belt. "I grant your
  second choice," she said coolly. "The quick death."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">10. OLD EINAR AGAIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Black Margot ground out her cigarette with her left hand
  against the polished wood of the table top, but her right rested inexorably
  on her weapon. Hull knew beyond doubt or question that he was about to die,
  and for a moment he considered the thought of dying fighting, of being
  blasted by the beam as he flung himself at her. Then he shook his head; he
  revolted at the idea of again trying violence on the exquisite figure he
  faced, who, though witch or demon, had the passionless purity and loveliness
  of divinity. It was easier to die passively, simply losing his thoughts in
  the glare of her unearthly beauty.</p>

  <p>She spoke. "So die, Hull Tarvish," she said gently, and drew the blunt
  weapon.</p>

  <p>A voice spoke behind him, a familiar, pleasant voice. "Do I intrude,
  Margaret?"</p>

  <p>He whirled. It was Old Einar, thrusting his goodhumored, wrinkled visage
  through the opening he had made in the doorway. He grinned at Hull, flung the
  door wider, and slipped into the room.</p>

  <p>"Einar!" cried the Princess, springing from her chair. "Einar Olin! Are
  you still in the world?" Her tones took on suddenly the note of deep pity.
  "But so old&mdash;so old!"</p>

  <p>The old man took her free hand. "it is forty years since last I saw you,
  Margaret&mdash;and I was fifty then,"</p>

  <p>"But so old!" she repeated. "Einar, have I changed?"</p>

  <p>He peered at her. "Not physically, my dear. But from the stories that go
  up and down the continent, you are hardly the gay madcap that N'Orleans
  worshipped as the Princess Peggy, nor even the valiant little warrior they
  used to call the Maid Of Orleans."</p>

  <p>She had forgotten Hull, but the guards visible through the half open door
  still blocked escape. He listened fascinated, for it was almost as if he saw
  a new Black Margot.</p>

  <p>"Was I ever the Princess Peggy?" she murmured. "I had forgotten&mdash;
  Well, Martin Sair can stave off age but he cannot halt the flow of time. But
  Einar&mdash;Einar, you were wrong to refuse him!"</p>

  <p>"Seeing you, Margaret, I wonder instead if I were not very wise. Youth is
  too great a restlessness to bear for so long a time, and you have borne it
  less than a century. What will you be in another fifty years? In another
  hundred, if Martin Sair's art keeps its power? What will you be?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head; her green eyes grew deep and sorrowful. "I don't know,
  Einar. I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Well," he said placidly, "I am old, but I am contented. I wonder if you
  can say as much."</p>

  <p>"I might have been different, Einar, had you joined us. I could have loved
  you, Einar."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed wryly. "I was afraid of that, and it was one of the
  reasons for my refusal. You see, I did love you, Margaret, and I chose to
  outgrow the torture rather than perpetuate it. That was a painful malady,
  loving you, and it took all of us at one time or another. 'Flame-struck', we
  used to call it." He smiled reflectively. "Are any left save me of all those
  who loved you?"</p>

  <p>"Just Jorgensen," she answered sadly. "That is if he has not yet killed
  himself in his quest for the secret of the Ancient's wings. But he will."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Olin dryly, "my years will yet make a mock of their
  immortality." He pointed a gnarled finger at Hull. "What do you want of my
  young friend here?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed emerald, and she drew her hand from that of Old Einar. "I
  plan to kill him."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? And why?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Her voice chilled. "Because he struck me with his hands.
  Twice."</p>

  <p>The old man smiled. "I shouldn't wonder if he had cause enough, Margaret.
  Memory tells me that I myself have had the same impulse."</p>

  <p>"Then it's well you never yielded, Einar. Even you."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless. But I think I shall ask you to forgive young Hull
  Tarvish."</p>

  <p>"You know his name! Is he really your friend?"</p>

  <p>Old Einar nodded. "I ask you to forgive him."</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" asked the Princess. "Why do you think a word from you can
  save him?"</p>

  <p>"I am still Olin," said the aged one, meeting her green eyes steadily with
  his watery blue ones. "I still carry Joaquin's seal."</p>

  <p>"As if that could stop me!" But the cold fire died slowly in her gaze, and
  again her eyes were sad. "But you are still Olin, the Father of Power," she
  murmured. With a sudden gesture she thrust her weapon back into her belt. "I
  spare him again," she said, and then, in tones gone strangely dull, "I
  suppose I wouldn't have killed him anyway. It is a weakness of mine that I
  cannot kill those who love me in a certain way&mdash;a weakness that will
  cost me dear some day."</p>

  <p>Olin twisted his lips in that skull-like smile, turning to the silent
  youth. "Hull," he said kindly, "you must have been born under fortunate
  stars. But if you're curious enough to tempt your luck further, listen to
  this old man's advice." His smile became a grin. "Beyond the western
  mountains there are some very powerful, very rare hunting cats called lions,
  which Martin Sair says are not native to this continent, but were brought
  here by the Ancients to be caged and gazed at, and occasionally trained. As
  to that I know nothing, but I do say this, Hull&mdash;go twist the tail of a
  lion before you again try the wrath of Black Margot. And now get out of
  here."</p>

  <p>"Not yet, Hull," snapped the Princess. "I have still my score to settle
  with you." She turned back to Olin. "Where do you wander now, Einar?"</p>

  <p>"To N'Orleans. I have some knowledge to give Jorgensen, and I am homesick
  besides for the Great City."</p>

  <p>He paused. "I have seen Joaquin. Selui has fallen."</p>

  <p>"I know. I ride to meet him tonight."</p>

  <p>"He has sent representations to Ch'cago."</p>

  <p>"Good!" she flashed. "Then there will be fighting." Then her eyes turned
  dreamy. "I have never seen the saltless seas," she added wistfully, "but I
  wonder if they can be as beautiful as the blue Gulf beyond N'Orleans."</p>

  <p>But Old Einar shook his thin white hair. "What will be the end of this,
  Margaret?" he asked gently. "After Ch'cago is taken&mdash;for you will take
  it&mdash;what then?"</p>

  <p>"Then the land north of the saltless seas, and east of them. N'York, and
  all the cities on the ocean shore."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"Then South America, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"And then, Margaret?"</p>

  <p>"Then? There is still Europe veiled in mystery, and Asia, Africa&mdash;
  all the lands known to the Ancients."</p>

  <p>"And after all of them?"</p>

  <p>"Afterwards," she replied wearily, "we can rest. The fierce destiny that
  drives Joaquin surely cannot drive him beyond the boundaries of the
  world."</p>

  <p>"And so," said Olin, "you fight your way around the world so you can rest
  at the end of the journey. Then why not rest now, Margaret? Must you pillow
  your head on the globe of the planet?"</p>

  <p>Fury flamed green in her eyes. She raised her hand and struck the old man
  across his lips, but it must have been lightly, for he still smiled.</p>

  <p>"Fool!" she cried. "Then I will see to it that there is always war!
  Between me and Joaquin, if need be&mdash;or between me and anyone&mdash;
  anyone&mdash;so that I fight!" She paused panting. "Leave me, Einar," she
  said tensely. "I do not like the things you bring to mind."</p>

  <p>Still smiling, the old man backed away. At the door he paused. "I will see
  you before I die, Margaret," he promised, and was gone.</p>

  <p>She followed him to the doorway. "Sora!" she called. "Sora! I ride!"</p>

  <p>Hull heard the heavy tread of the fat Sora, and in a moment she entered
  bearing the diminutive cothurns and a pair of glistening silver gauntlets on
  her hands, and then she too was gone.</p>

  <p>Slowly, almost wearily, the Princess turned to face Hull, who had as yet
  permitted no gleam of hope to enter his soul, for he had experienced too much
  of her mockery to trust the promise of safety Old Einar had won for him. He
  felt only the fascination that she always bound about him, the spell of her
  unbelievable black hair and her glorious sea-green eyes, and all her
  unearthly beauty.</p>

  <p>"Hull," she said gently, "what do you think of me now?"</p>

  <p>"I think you are a black flame blowing cold across the world. I think a
  demon drives you."</p>

  <p>"And do you hate me so bitterly?"</p>

  <p>"I pray every second to hate you."</p>

  <p>"Then see, Hull." With her little gauntleted fingers she took his great
  hands and placed them about the perfect curve of her throat. "Here I give you
  my life for the taking. You have only to twist once with these mighty hands
  of yours and Black Margot will be out of the world forever." She paused.
  "Must I beg you?"</p>

  <p>Hull felt as if molten metal flowed upward through his arms from the touch
  of her white skin. His fingers were rigid as metal bars, and all the great
  strength of them could not put one feather's weight of pressure on the soft
  throat they circled. And deep in the lambent emerald flames that burned in
  her eyes he saw again the fire of mockery&mdash;jeering, taunting.</p>

  <p>"You will not?" she said, lifting away his hands, but holding them in
  hers. "Then you do not hate me?"</p>

  <p>"You know I don't," he groaned.</p>

  <p>"And you do love me?"</p>

  <p>"Please," he muttered. "Is it necessary again to torture me? I need no
  proof of your mastery."</p>

  <p>"Then say you love me."</p>

  <p>"Heaven forgive me for it;" he whispered, "but I do!"</p>

  <p>She dropped his hands and smiled. "Then listen to me, Hull. You love
  little Vail with a truer love, and month by month memory fades before
  reality. After a while there will be nothing left in you of Black Margot, but
  there will be always Vail. I go now hoping never to see you again, but"
  &mdash;and her eyes chilled to green ice&mdash;"before I go I settle my score
  with you."</p>

  <p>She raised her gauntleted hand. "This for your treachery!" she said, and
  struck him savagely across his right check. Blood spouted, there would be
  scars, but he stood stolid. "This for your violence!" she said, and the
  silver gauntlet tore his left check. Then her eyes softened. "And this," she
  murmured, "for your love!"</p>

  <p>Her arms circled him, her body was warm against him, and her exquisite
  lips burned against his. He felt as if he embraced a flame for a moment, and
  then she was gone, and a part of his soul went with her. When he heard the
  hooves of the stallion Eblis pounding beyond the window, he turned and walked
  slowly out of the house to where Vail still crouched beside her father's
  body. She clung to him, wiped the blood from his cheeks, and strangely, her
  words were not of her father, nor of the sparing of Hull's life, but of Black
  Margot.</p>

  <p>"I knew you lied to save me," she murmured. "I knew you never loved
  her."</p>

  <p>And Hull, in whom there was no falsehood, drew her close to him and said
  nothing.</p>

  <p>But Black Margot rode north from Selui through the night. In the sky
  before her were thin shadows leading phantom armies, Alexander the Great,
  Attila, Genghis Khan, Tamerlane, Napoleon, and clearer than all, the battle
  queen Semiramis. All the mighty conquerors of the past, and where were they,
  where were their empires, and where, even, were their bones? Far in the south
  were the graves of men who had loved her, all except Old Einar, who tottered
  like a feeble grey ghost across the world to find his.</p>

  <p>At her side Joaquin Smith turned as if to speak stared, and remained
  silent. He was not accustomed to the sight of tears in the eyes and on the
  cheeks of Black Margot.</p>
