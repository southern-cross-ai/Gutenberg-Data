<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>Lady Anne Daventry was not a pleasant old lady. Her nearest and
dearest found her difficult to get on with, her servants called her
"cantankerous," and her contemporaries&mdash;those who remembered
her in her far-off beautiful youth&mdash;said she had a good
heart.</p>

<p>She was not so very old really, not as people count age
nowadays. More than a whole year lay between her and that
seventieth birthday that makes such a very definite landmark in
most people's lives. Trouble and ill-health had combined to make
her look far older than her actual years. No one would have thought
her younger than her only remaining brother&mdash;The Rev. and Hon.
Augustus Fyvert&mdash;the rector of North Coton. Yet, in reality,
Lady Anne had been a child in the nursery when he was a big boy
going to Eton.</p>

<p>Life had not been kind to Lady Anne. The parents, whose petted
darling she had been, had both died without seeing their youngest
and most dearly-loved child grow up, and the man to whom she had
been engaged in her youth, and whom she had passionately loved, had
been false to her. Her subsequent marriage with Squire Daventry, of
Daventry Keep, had been in the nature of a compromise, and her life
with him had not been an easy one. One consolation she had
had&mdash;the two bonny boys, who grew up to handsome manhood
within the walls of Daventry Keep. Then, following swiftly on the
old Squire's death, had come the great war; Christopher Daventry
and his brother Frank had both died gloriously, fighting for
England and freedom, and Lady Anne was left desolate.</p>

<p>The effect upon her of the double blow was devastating. For a
time they feared for Lady Anne's life and reason, but she was not
made of the stuff that goes under. Her vigorous vitality reasserted
itself, and very soon Lady Anne came out into the world once
more.</p>

<p>But she was never quite the same; grief seemed to have hardened,
not softened, her whole nature. She who had been gracious and
charming became snappy and irritable, and finally, when the
rheumatism, from which she had suffered for years, became chronic
and brought about a permanent stiffness of the limbs, Lady Anne,
while saying little of her sufferings, was a distinctly cross and
unpleasant old lady.</p>

<p>In her boys' time she had lived principally at Daventry Keep,
which, by the terms of the old Squire's will, remained hers for
life, but after the death of her sons she had found the quiet of
the country oppressive, and for years now she had rented on a long
lease the town house of the Daventrys in Charlton Crescent.</p>

<p>It overlooked the Park, and from her bedroom windows she could
watch the stream of London traffic ebbing and flowing along the
capital's great artery.</p>

<p>Lady Anne's sitting-room was on the first floor and looked out
on the beautiful old-world garden beyond. It remained unchanged in
its Victorian splendour as it had been at the time of her marriage;
there were no modern furnishing vagaries for Lady Anne. The floor
was carpeted all over in luxurious velvet-pile&mdash;Lady Anne
liked its warmth and softness&mdash;the curtains were of lovely old
brocade in faded pinks and blues, that was matched in the
comfortable, spacious arm-chairs and settees. There were panels of
beautiful old tapestry on the walls, quaint old lustre and
cut-glass ornaments on the high marble mantelpiece; daguerreotypes
and old-fashioned photographs of the relatives and friends of Lady
Anne's young days were everywhere. One table was devoted entirely
to miniatures on ivory. There was even a spinet, which Lady Anne
loved for the sake of the dear dead-and-gone women whose fingers
had touched it, and a big jar of potpourri stood by one of the
windows.</p>

<p>Lady Anne's escritoire was facing it&mdash;a very beautiful
specimen of old Georgian workmanship. When let down for writing it
disclosed a front and sides richly inlaid. The tiny drawers at each
side had golden knobs. The cupboard in the middle, misnamed secret,
had a door inlaid all over in a curious arabesque pattern, inset
with ivory and jade, and in it gold, silver and copper were oddly
mingled.</p>

<p>The big revolving chair before this table was Lady Anne's
favourite seat. She came of a generation that did not believe in
soft seats for themselves, even when crippled by rheumatism.</p>

<p>She was sitting there this morning, a quantity of papers on the
slip-table before her, which she was perusing steadily and then
docketing methodically on a small file. On her right hand there lay
an open manuscript book, richly bound in grey and gold, with the
word "Diary" scrawled across it in golden letters. She made several
entries in this book as she filed her papers.</p>

<p>Every now and then her eyes strayed mechanically to the trees
outside. It was evident that, busy as she seemed, her attention was
wandering, her thoughts far away.</p>

<p>She was a picturesque figure in her black silk gown with its
fichu of priceless old lace, a magnificent diamond crescent brooch
gleaming amidst the filmy folds. Her still abundant snow-white hair
was drawn back from her forehead over a Pompadour frame, and, with
a fine disregard for the present fashion, coiled high on the top of
her head and crowned with a tiny scrap of lace which she referred
to sometimes as "my cap."</p>

<p>For the rest she was very pale; her skin with its network of
wrinkles was the colour of old ivory. The once beautiful mouth had
fallen in, but the big, very light blue eyes, beneath her still
dark, straight brows, gave character to her face. Not on the whole
an agreeable character! Lady Anne was an irritable, impatient old
lady, and looked it!</p>

<p>At last she pushed the papers from her with a jerk, and opening
one of the small drawers of the escritoire took out a tiny box,
just a very ordinary-looking little pill-box. She opened it. Inside
there were eight little pills, all sugar-coated; ordinary-looking
enough contents for an ordinary box; yet Lady Anne's face went very
white as she gazed at them.</p>

<p>Moving them very gingerly with the tip of her finger, she
scrutinized each one with meticulous care as she did so.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. There can be no doubt," she murmured to herself.
Then, as if coming to some definite decision, she put on the lid of
the pill-box firmly and laid it back in its place in the inlaid
drawer. She waited again when she had pushed the drawer back.</p>

<p>Opposite, there hung a beautiful old mirror; Lady Anne loved
that mirror. It had been given her when she was a young girl. She
had taken it to the Keep when she married, and when she made up her
mind to live in London she had brought the mirror with her. Now it
seemed like an old friend. It had shown her herself as a young
girl, as a bride, as a happy mother, then as a sorrow-stricken
woman and one verging on old age, but never had there looked back
at her such a reflection as she saw this morning. The cheeks, even
the lips, were white. The big light eyes, still beautiful in shape
and size, were wide with fear. Altogether the face in the glass
looked like that of a woman oppressed by some terrible
dread&mdash;some nameless horror!</p>

<p>Lady Anne stared straight at it for a minute or two as at the
face of a stranger, then a long shiver shook her from head to foot.
Like a woman returning from a trance she pressed her handkerchief
over her lips, and turning back to her papers she drew from among
them what looked like a list of business firms. She scrutinized it
for a moment with knit brows, running her pen up and down the
column as she did so; at last she stopped&mdash;Wilkins and Alleyn,
Private Inquiry Agents, Parlere St., Strand, she read. "Yes, I
think that is the firm."</p>

<p>She turned to the telephone which stood beside her and rang up
Wilkins and Alleyn. Fortunately the line was clear and she was able
to be put through at once. It was evidently a woman's voice that
answered, and Lady Anne frowned. She had no opinion of her own sex
in business.</p>

<p>"Messrs. Wilkins and Alleyn," she said sharply, "I wish to speak
to one of the principals&mdash;Lady Anne Daventry."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then a man's voice&mdash;a cultured man's
voice&mdash;spoke:</p>

<p>"I am Bruce Cardyn, a junior partner in the firm of Messrs.
Wilkins and Alleyn. You wished to speak to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Lady Anne's voice faltered, then gathered I strength as
it went on. "I wish to consult a member of your firm. As I am a
chronic invalid, unable to get out much, I cannot come to you.
Besides, under the circumstances, I should not wish it to be known
that I have paid a visit to your office, so I should be glad if one
of your principals could call upon me as soon as possible. And I
dare say that you will think this a strange request, but possibly
you are used to them. Would you be kind enough to say at the door
that you are applying for this post as secretary? I dismissed my
secretary a few days ago and am now looking out for another. If you
will allow it to be supposed that you are coming after the post,
your being admitted will excite no surprise or suspicion in the
household, and I am most anxious to avoid this."</p>

<p>Another pause. Lady Anne fancied that there was a consultation,
then the same voice spoke again.</p>

<p>"Certainly. That would be the best plan. Would it suit you if I
came in an hour's time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it would," Lady Anne said decidedly. "Unless," she added
grimly, "you could come in half an hour's time!"</p>

<p>Lady Anne did not move; very often on her bad days she did not
go down to the dining-room for meals, but had something brought to
her in her room. To-day, however, she gave orders that she was not
to be disturbed until Mr. Cardyn's arrival.</p>

<p>It seemed a very long hour to her, and the soft spring gloaming
had merged into something like darkness before Mr. Cardyn came.</p>

<p>The blinds had been closely drawn and the electric light turned
on fully. In the old days Lady Anne had loved the twilight, but now
she had got into the habit of glancing into the corners in a
frightened fashion, and if she were alone the light was always
turned on at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>She looked with curiosity at the man who came forward when the
door closed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bruce Cardyn?"</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>"You look very young," Lady Anne said discontentedly. "I hoped
to see some one much older and with more experience."</p>

<p>Mr. Cardyn permitted himself a slight smile.</p>

<p>"I have had a good deal of experience and&mdash;I am not so
young as I look, perhaps, Lady Anne; I am thirty-one."</p>

<p>"Are you indeed?" Lady Anne said incredulously, as she glanced
at his fair, clean-shaven countenance, at the close-cut, fair hair,
brushed straight back from his forehead, and the slim, youthful
figure.</p>

<p>"I am, indeed," he confirmed.</p>

<p>"I heard of your firm from my friend, General Hetherington,"
Lady Anne resumed as she motioned him to a chair very close to her
own. "I believe Messrs. Wilkins and Alleyn did some very successful
work for him&mdash;not only discovered the criminal but recovered
the stolen property. I am speaking of a burglary that took place at
Hetherington Hall last year."</p>

<p>"I remember," Bruce Cardyn nodded. "Yes, we were fortunate
enough to satisfy General Hetherington."</p>

<p>"But the General spoke of Messrs. Wilkins and Alleyn. I never
heard him mention your name."</p>

<p>"I dare say not." Bruce Cardyn's smile deepened. "Yet I am the
junior partner. My senior's name is Misterton. Wilkins and Alleyn
is merely a&mdash;shall I say?&mdash;<i>nom de plume</i>. You see,
if we visited you under our own names we should be more likely to
be recognised by any professional crook who has read the list of
private inquiry agents. If you will entrust your business to us,
Lady Anne, I can promise that we will do our best for you."</p>

<p>"I believe you will. But it is no easy problem that I wish you
to solve."</p>

<p>She stopped, and seemed for a moment to be really struggling for
words in which to state her dilemma.</p>

<p>As Bruce Cardyn watched her the pity in his grey eyes grew and
strengthened. There was something very pathetic about the stern old
face, with the strong mouth that twitched every now and then, and
the nameless dread looking out of the big shadowed eyes.</p>

<p>At last Lady Anne seemed to rally her courage by a supreme
effort.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cardyn, I have never been a coward in my life&mdash;till
now! And here to-day I am living in my own house, surrounded by
servants, who have for the most part grown grey in my service, and
by those who are bound to me by ties of blood and professed
affection, yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet?" Bruce Cardyn echoed, a touch of surprise in his grey
eyes.</p>

<p>Lady Anne looked at him, the faint colour that had come back to
her withered cheeks ebbing once more; the dread in her eyes
deepening. Her voice sank to a whisper:</p>

<p>"And yet, as I say, in my own house, surrounded by those I know
and love, and who one would expect to have some sort of liking for
me, some one is trying to kill me!"</p>

<p>It was not at all what Bruce Cardyn had expected to hear. He was
silent for a minute. Sundry stories he had heard of old people who
accused their own families of trying to murder them recurred to his
mind, but Lady Anne was not old enough for that.</p>

<p>"You have some ground for your belief?" he hazarded at last.</p>

<p>Lady Anne bent her head.</p>

<p>"At first it was only a mere suspicion. I tried to smother it,
to assure myself that it was only the merest fancy. I said to
myself I am a disagreeable, snappy old woman, I know, but surely I
am not so bad that anyone should wish to murder me. Now, however,
conviction has been forced upon me. But, Mr. Cardyn, before we
proceed, can you with as many underlings as you choose to bring,
with any and every expense guaranteed, can you promise me safety in
my own house?"</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn's face was very grave. Lady Anne's aspect was so
controlled, so direct, that the momentary suspicion that had
flitted across his mind was dismissed finally and for ever.</p>

<p>"We will do our best to ensure your safety in every way, Lady
Anne," he said steadily. "And I think we ought to succeed. More it
is not in the power of mortal man to promise."</p>

<p>"It is not!" Lady Anne assented. "Well, Mr. Cardyn, I am going
to trust you to safeguard me. Life is sweet to anyone, I suppose,
even when one is old and lonely. And we all shrink from the great
abyss. Now, as I tell you, my life is being attempted, has been
attempted by some member of my household, as I believe, and I want
you to discover who it is, and to prevent the crime. But, above all
things, I do not want the regular police called in. I want the
whole thing kept as quiet as possible. I know that this will make
your work more difficult, but I hope you will be none the less
willing to undertake it."</p>

<p>"Certainly we will undertake it," Bruce Cardyn promised, his
face pale and grave. "But first can you can give some of the ground
you have to go upon, Lady Anne?"</p>

<p>Lady Anne hesitated a minute, then she bent forward and took the
pill-box again.</p>

<p>"I think this will show you best what I have to fear. Look!" She
held the box toward him.</p>

<p>He put up a monocle and looked at its contents with great
curiosity as it lay in his hand.</p>

<p>"The pills in that box originally were made up by the chemist I
have employed for years, from a prescription given me by my own
doctor. I was taking one the last thing every night. There were
twelve in the box when it came. I took one at bed-time for five
nights. I was glancing at them, only after I had taken the fifth;
there were still eight left! What do you make of that?"</p>

<p>Mr. Cardyn looked at the pills; the gravity of his expression
deepened.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure of your facts, Lady Anne. It would not be
difficult, for instance, to make a mistake in the number of pills
or of the number of nights you took them."</p>

<p>For answer, Lady Anne drew a small silver key from the handbag
in front of her, and unlocked another small drawer. Inside was a
sheet of embossed letter-paper. There were very few lines upon it,
but the signature was one of the best known of the day:</p>

<p class="letter">DEAR LADY ANNE,<br>
<br>
I have analysed the pills you sent me. Seven of them are harmless.
The eighth contains hyoscine enough to kill ten women. I am
returning them as you requested.<br>
<br>
What can I do for you now? Please let me help you.<br>
<br>
Yours always,<br>
ROBERT SAINTSBURY.</p>

<p>"That," said Lady Anne very deliberately, "settles the question,
I think!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>Bruce Cardyn put the box down. "It certainly does appear to
settle the question that some one is attempting your life.
But&mdash;pardon me&mdash;it proves nothing with regard to the
would-be assassin being a member of your household."</p>

<p>"Do you not think so?" Lady Anne questioned coldly. "Since the
pills were kept in a drawer in my bedroom, it is difficult to see
how anyone, not a member of my household, could have access to
them."</p>

<p>"Difficult," Bruce Cardyn assented, "but not impossible. And, in
a case of this kind, we cannot afford to rule out any
possibilities, Lady Anne. But, now, is this all you have to go
upon?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say it is not." Lady Anne's pale blue eyes were
mechanically watching the flickering of the leaves on a branch of
the creeper that had strayed over her window. "I have had several
curious accidents, but the most serious of them all, to my mind, is
this. To begin with, it is my custom to take a glass of hot milk
the last thing at night. For some time I have not been feeling very
well&mdash;indigestion, I thought it to be&mdash;and took my usual
simple remedies without success.</p>

<p>"I am not over fond of doctors, but was beginning to think I
should have to consult my old friend, Dr. Spencer, when, one night
as I was drinking my milk, I became conscious of a very curious
taste. It set me thinking. I put the glass down, meaning to make
inquiries, and went on with my reading. Half an hour later, when
the milk had got cold, my pet Persian cat, climbing about as she
does sometimes, got on the table by my side and lapped up some of
it before noticed what she was doing. A very short time afterwards
she was violently sick and lay writhing about in awful pain. I
thought at first that she was going to die, but in the end got her
round again. Since then I have taken no more hot milk. It goes down
the drain, and I feel better. My indigestion is a thing of the
past."</p>

<p>"And that is all?" Bruce Cardyn questioned.</p>

<p>"Is it not enough?" Lady Anne parried.</p>

<p>"It ought to be," Cardyn assented. "But, Lady Anne, have you no
idea who is your would-be assassin?"</p>

<p>Lady Anne shook her head.</p>

<p>"None! Of course I do not say that my fancy has not strayed from
one to another, and have said to myself&mdash;'it could not be
so-and-so, it could not be so-and-so,' but of real knowledge, or
even suspicion, I have none."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Cardyn sat with his eyes apparently
studying the pattern of the carpet. At last he raised them and gave
Lady Anne one long, penetrating look.</p>

<p>"Has anyone in the house any motive for desiring your
death?"</p>

<p>"Every one of them," Lady Anne said slowly, a momentary moisture
clouding her glasses. "Every servant in my employ comes in for a
legacy at my death, small or large according to their time of
service. This is well known and one which might have provided a
motive."</p>

<p>"Exactly," Cardyn acquiesced. "And if the motive seems
inadequate, one must remember for what exceedingly small sums
murders have been committed in the past. Now will you tell me
exactly of whom your household consists? First the servants?" He
took out his note-book and waited.</p>

<p>Lady Anne's pale eyes gave him one swift look and then glanced
obliquely away.</p>

<p>"To begin with there are Soames, the butler, and my maid,
Pirnie. Both of them have been with me&mdash;with us&mdash;for many
years. Pirnie came as quite a young girl, soon after my marriage.
Then there are two housemaids, a kitchen-maid, and the
cook-housekeeper, who has been here some years, a young footman
under Soames, and a boy. That is all the indoor staff except that
both the girls have maids&mdash;Miss Fyvert and Miss Balmaine, I
mean. Outside we have a head gardener with a couple of men under
him, and a chauffeur. But those, as I say, are out of count."</p>

<p>"I cannot at present put anyone out of count," Bruce Cardyn
dissented, as he wrote a few lines rapidly in his note-book. "Now
the members of your family, Lady Anne, please."</p>

<p>"They are soon told."</p>

<p>For a moment the detective fancied that Lady Anne's stern lips
quivered; then he told himself that he must be mistaken as she went
on in the same clear voice:</p>

<p>"There are my two nieces, Dorothy and Maureen Fyvert. They have
made their home with me for the most part since their mother's
death two years ago. Maureen is a child of twelve, usually at a
boarding-school at Torquay, but at present at home on account of an
outbreak of measles. Dorothy is twenty, and a very good girl. Then
there is Margaret Balmaine, my husband's granddaughter."</p>

<p>She was not looking at the detective now or she would have seen
his interested expression change to one of utter amazement.</p>

<p>"Miss Margaret Balmaine!" he repeated, but even as he spoke the
veil of inscrutability dropped over his features once more, and he
became again the impassive-looking detective.</p>

<p>"Has Miss Balmaine, too, been here for some time?"</p>

<p>"No, she is a comparatively recent comer," Lady Anne said
quietly. "She has not been here quite three months as a matter of
fact."</p>

<p>Cardyn was writing quickly now. "You said your husband's
granddaughter?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes," Lady Anne said, with another quick glance at the
detective's sleek, bent head. "My husband had been married and lost
his wife before he met me. He had one daughter who ran away and
nearly broke her father's heart. She died many years ago in
Australia, and we had no idea that she had left any children until
this girl turned up a few months ago and introduced herself to
me."</p>

<p>"She had, I presume, the necessary credentials?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Quite so. Quite so!" Lady Anne assented. "My lawyer
saw to that, naturally. And, as a matter of course, the girl is
making her home with me while she remains in England. Then, running
up and down so often that, though he is not a member of my
household, he might almost be reckoned as such, is John Daventry,
my husband's nephew, who succeeded to the estate on the death of
his&mdash;cousins."</p>

<p>There was a momentary break in the firm voice at the allusion to
her dead sons, then she went on: "He is half engaged to my elder
niece, Dorothy Fyvert. At least for some years it has been a sort
of family arrangement about them. Just of late, however, I have
begun to wonder whether it will ever come to anything. They seem to
regard one another as cousins and Mr. Daventry certainly admires
Miss Balmaine. This is being very confidential, Mr. Cardyn, but I
wish you to be thoroughly <i>au courant</i> with everything in the
house."</p>

<p>"I quite understand that," Cardyn said quietly. "But you said
just now that every member of the household had a motive. I presume
these young people are included?"</p>

<p>Lady Anne bent her head and for a moment pressed her dainty
handkerchief to her lips.</p>

<p>"Every one in the house has some motive, as I said. By my
husband's will, his private fortune&mdash;a very large one&mdash;is
divided at my death between John Daventry and the heirs of my
husband's daughter, Marjorie&mdash;Miss Balmaine, in other words.
Should Mr. Daventry predecease me his share passes on with my
estate. Oh, I was forgetting! Until last Saturday my house had
another inmate&mdash;my secretary, David Branksome. Now, Mr.
Cardyn, as I told you, I am looking for a new secretary, and it
occurred to me that the post might be occupied by one of your
employees who, while ostensibly working with me, might be really
watching over my safety."</p>

<p>"A very good idea," Cardyn assented. "With your permission I
will take the post myself. I suppose there are no special
qualifications needed."</p>

<p>Lady Anne looked a little doubtful.</p>

<p>"I have a collection of wonderful old miniatures, which I am
having catalogued and described. Do you know anything of them? Of
course I could help you."</p>

<p>"I think I should be able to manage." Cardyn made an entry in
his book. Then he looked at her, tapping his lips with his pencil
as he waited. "May I ask why Mr. Branksome left?"</p>

<p>Lady Anne hesitated.</p>

<p>"I had some reason to be displeased with him," she said stiffly.
"But that does not enter into this matter at all."</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn frowned.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, I think it does. In that very cause for your
displeasure may lie the clue to the mystery we are trying to solve.
You must be perfectly frank with me, Lady Anne."</p>

<p>Lady Anne's indecision was apparent, but at last common-sense
prevailed.</p>

<p>"Well, I do not see how it can have the slightest connection,"
she surrendered. "But, though David Branksome was in some respects
a good enough secretary, I did not care for him; he took too much
upon himself&mdash;I hardly know how to describe it&mdash;and I
seriously objected to his manner with Miss Balmaine. She, of
course, coming from Australia, where I suppose all men are equal,
apparently saw no harm in it. She assured me that she had no
thought of anything serious and begged me not to dismiss him, but I
felt it best to keep to my resolution. But I think this is begging
the question, Mr. Cardyn. David Branksome alone of my household was
not mentioned in my will. He was only a recent acquisition called
in to help me in cataloguing my collection of miniatures, and the
old editions in the library downstairs. Thus he had no motive. And,
moreover, he had left me before I discovered the eighth pill. No,
he had certainly no motive."</p>

<p>"H'm! No. Nevertheless, I think I will look Mr. Branksome up a
bit. There is no certainty, as far as can see, when the extra pill
was added. Was he with you before Miss Balmaine came, Lady
Anne?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. A couple of months, I should think." Lady Anne
wrinkled up her brows. "I can give you the exact dates by looking
up my diary."</p>

<p>She drew the book at her side towards her and turned over the
pages rapidly.</p>

<p>"Here it is! Branksome came to me on the 12th of September last
year; Miss Balmaine reached us on the 29th of October."</p>

<p>"I see." Bruce Cardyn put the elastic band round his
pocket-book. "Lady Anne, your new secretary would like to come in
at once."</p>

<p>"To-day?" Lady Anne questioned.</p>

<p>"In an hour's time," Cardyn acquiesced. "I have to go back to
the office to make a few arrangements. For, with your permission, I
am going to set a watch on the house outside!"</p>

<p>"Outside?" Lady Anne raised her eyebrows. "Really, I do not
think that is necessary, Mr. Cardyn. The outside staff have no
possible means of access&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not so much the outside staff that I am thinking of,
though I shall give them a little attention, too, but I want any
communication that the people inside the house have with outsiders
carefully watched. In some cases, too, there will be probably
shadowing to be done. But you have given me carte blanche, Lady
Anne, though I will not trouble you with the details of my
precautions, I want you to feel that you are perfectly safe. For a
few days I am going to ask you to eat only at meal-times, when
there can be no certainty beforehand who will partake of the food.
Eschew all odd cups of milk, even your morning tea, until the
assassin is found. I will get your prescription made up at the
chemist's myself, if you will permit, and give the medicines into
your own hands. While you will, I hope, keep them all locked up and
allow no one to have access to them."</p>

<p>"I dare say I can manage it," Lady Anne said doubtfully. "But I
am afraid Pirnie will be offended. She is my confidential maid, you
understand, and the most faithful, the most honest creature in the
world. For me even to say that she is entirely beyond suspicion is
absurd."</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn coughed.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, even the most confidential of maids must be
suspect until we have discovered the guilty person. I must ask you
to adhere strictly to this rule, please, Lady Anne."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I leave it in your hands," Lady Anne conceded.
"Only make me safe, though I dare say you are thinking it is an
unnecessary bother to make about an old woman."</p>

<p>The detective got up.</p>

<p>"I will safeguard your life as I would have done my own
mother's, Lady Anne."</p>

<p>He took a few steps up the room looking grave and
preoccupied.</p>

<p>"Of course it is my duty to tell you that it is my opinion that
the only way to make you absolutely safe is for you to leave this
house, letting no one know where you go or how long you will be
away, taking no one with you, and of course not returning until we
have discovered the identity of the would-be assassin."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't do that," Lady Anne said in her most positive
tone. "My good man, I have long since given up going away for
change of air, as they call it. I can get all the change of air
that I want in London, and an invalid is best by her own fireside.
So, if you cannot make me safe here&mdash;" Her gesture was
expressive.</p>

<p>"I feel no doubt but that we shall be able to do so," Bruce
Cardyn said quickly, "only I was bound to lay the other possibility
before you."</p>

<p>Something like a grim smile passed over Lady Anne's
countenance.</p>

<p>"Well, you have put it before me and I refuse to have anything
to do with it; therefore the responsibility is off your shoulders.
In an hour, then, I shall expect you, Mr. Cardyn. By the way, under
what name shall you pass as my secretary?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cardyn, please," the detective said at once. "Of course, in
any mention of our work officially, we are called by the name of
the firm, and even that is not as well-known to the criminal
classes as I should like it to be."</p>

<p>"As you wish." Lady Anne touched the bell and the footman
appeared to show Cardyn out.</p>

<p>The detective glanced at him keenly. "A young man from the
country," he decided.</p>

<p>Soames, the butler, was hovering about in the hall, a
benevolent-looking, elderly man, whose bland face and dignified,
stately manner might have been those of a Bishop or a Minister of
State.</p>

<p>Cardyn took a taxi back to his office. As he let himself in with
a key his partner looked out of the adjoining room&mdash;a
keen-faced, clean-shaven man, a few years older than Cardyn.</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"Well!" Cardyn responded in a non-committal voice.</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>"Is it to be you or me?"</p>

<p>"Me, I think!" Cardyn's voice was firm. "For the reason I told
you I wish to undertake the work."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>"Monsieur Melange is with her ladyship, sir."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Melange!" Bruce Cardyn repeated with a doubtful glance
at Soames's placid face.</p>

<p>"The French gentleman to see the miniatures, sir," the butler
went on, his manner as gravely respectful to the secretary as
though the young man had been Squire Daventry himself. Soames's
manners were always perfect. Somehow he conveyed the impression
that they were something demanded by his self-respect, and quite
irrespective of the person whom he was addressing.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. His lordship and Lady Barminster are coming to lunch.
They are coming over with Miss Fyvert and Mr. John Daventry."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Mr. Daventry is Squire Daventry of the Keep, isn't
he?" Bruce questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Though it seems strange to think of him there, and
the old Squire and both his sons gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, times change and we change with them," Bruce said as
he went on.</p>

<p>The butler looked after him with an indulgent smile. Bruce
Cardyn in his character as secretary had been a week at the house
in Charlton Crescent, and he appeared to be gaining golden opinions
from the household, including the mistress. There was something so
boyish and attractive about his personality. It is probable that
the dignified Soames would have received the shock of his life if
he had been told that the young man was a private detective. But so
far Bruce Cardyn was obliged to confess to himself that he was not
making the progress he had hoped for.</p>

<p>He went straight to Lady Anne's sitting-room. He did most of his
work in the room adjoining, and it was here, as he expected, that
he found her with her visitor.</p>

<p>Monsieur Melange was not an imposing looking person. He was not
very tall, and looked shorter by reason of his bowed shoulders; he
had a shock of grey hair that was longer than English fashion
allowed, and his round glasses were smoke-tinted. His voice, as
Cardyn caught it, was soft and pleasantly modulated, and though he
apparently spoke English well it was with a French turn of
expression, and a particularly foreign accent.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lady Anne," he was saying as Bruce closed the door, "it
is a very fine one by Coros&mdash;Philippe Coros who died in 1754,
and painted many of the beauties of the pre-Revolution period."</p>

<p>He laid the miniature on the table before him as he spoke, a
table on which were arranged several boxes and cases.</p>

<p>"Yes. We have quite a collection of Philippe Coros' work. They
are supposed to be rather characteristic specimens, but I shall
leave Mr. Cardyn to show them to you," Lady Anne said, as she got
up, helping herself by the table and her walking-stick. "If you
want further information I shall be in my room until lunch, Mr.
Cardyn."</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn helped her to her usual seat near the window, then,
closing the door, came back to Monsieur Melange.</p>

<p>That gentleman during his absence had undergone a momentary
metamorphosis. He had taken off his smoked glasses, pushed back the
grey wig, and the tone in which he spoke to Cardyn as he laid the
miniature back in the case had lost all trace of accent.</p>

<p>"Well, made any discoveries?" he questioned, his voice easily
recognizable now as that of Frederick Misterton, the senior partner
in the firm of Wilkins and Alleyn.</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn took the chair opposite.</p>

<p>"Nothing! A faint suspicion I entertained has been done away
with by the fact that there is no motive. Nay, if there was any
motive it would seem to be the other way&mdash;rather to keep Lady
Anne alive. You have got the information I wanted?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The person principally benefiting by Lady Anne's death
would undoubtedly be John Daventry, as you said. Most of the
Daventry money which was left to her as the Squire's wife will
revert to the head of the house at her death, the rest goes to the
heirs of his daughter, Marjorie, should there be any. I have made a
few inquiries about the young man, who only succeeded after the
death of his cousins, Lady Anne's sons. He distinguished himself by
great personal bravery during the war, gaining the D.S.O. and being
mentioned in despatches. After his return and accession to the
estate, there was some talk of wild oats and it was rumoured that
he was heavily in debt, but of late he is reported to have turned
over a new leaf. It is said that there is an understanding with
Miss Dorothy Fyvert, Lady Anne's niece, but there is no talk of any
definite engagement, nor is it thought very likely that unless Lady
Anne paves the way there can be any thought of marriage, as death
duties have pressed heavily upon him.</p>

<p>"H'm!" Cardyn drummed restlessly on the table with his fingers.
"As you say, so far as we can see, the motive in this case is the
strongest&mdash;perhaps the only strong one. But the ordinary
well-born young Englishman does not commit murder, even to marry
the girl of his choice. Besides, I think the hot milk rather puts
him out of count."</p>

<p>"He might have an accomplice," Misterton suggested. "We can't
afford to discard any possibilities, Cardyn; what is Miss Dorothy
Fyvert like?"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen her yet," Bruce Cardyn said slowly. "She has
been away since I came. I have just heard, however, that she will
be at home to lunch to-day, and that Mr. Daventry will be with her.
They have both been staying at Barminster Towers."</p>

<p>"You must get me an invitation to lunch," Misterton said at
once. "I want to have a look at Daventry, and it may be instructive
to see them together."</p>

<p>"That can easily be managed," said Cardyn quietly. "But I want a
few inquiries made in another direction. Cable to Messrs. Gage
Bros, of Sydney. A Miss Margaret Balmaine sailed from that town in
the S.S. <i>Thapaluca</i> on September the 8th last year. I want
them to look into her past and to let us know all particulars as
soon as possible. Bid them spare no expense. And please see that
the return cable is delivered to me personally as soon as it
arrives."</p>

<p>"I will see to that," Misterton said curtly. "Now, with regard
to the servants, they have all been shadowed for the past week, but
so far nothing suspicious has been observed with regard to any of
them."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there would be," Bruce said thoughtfully. "And
a legacy, not likely to be an inordinately large one, seems an
inadequate motive for a secret poisoner. No, the only person who
has any strong reason to desire Lady Anne's death is John Daventry.
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped and began apparently to trace out the pattern of the
table-cloth before him. Misterton's eyes strayed to the open
window, thence to the garden below. Presently he started and leaned
forward.</p>

<p>"Who is that girl, Cardyn?"</p>

<p>Cardyn's eyes followed his.</p>

<p>"Miss Margaret Balmaine," he said quickly.</p>

<p>"Phew!" the other drew his lips together in a whistle. "H'm!
good-looking girl enough. But she would look more in accordance
with her surroundings in the chorus of an <i>opéra bouffe</i> than
in Lady Anne Daventry's house. Yes, I should say an inquiry into
her past might be interesting."</p>

<p>There was a strange gleam in Cardyn's eyes as he stood up and
watched the movements of the tall, golden-haired girl, who was
moving about, in and out among the flower-beds on the lawn. She
wore a short, straight, white silk frock, much abbreviated as to
the skirt, practically sleeveless and lownecked. The lines of her
slim figure, thus revealed, were beautiful, so was also the shape
of her boyish-looking shingled golden head. Her hair was of the
gold beloved by artists, but it, as well as the pink and white
complexion and the lustre shaded eyes, owed much of its beauty to
art. Opposite to her, flashing about with something in her hands,
which she was refusing to give up, was a child, a long-legged girl,
about twelve, who, in her frock of bright delphinium-blue looked
like a butterfly among the plants.</p>

<p>"Maureen Fyvert, Lady Anne's younger niece," Cardyn explained.
"She is a terribly spoilt child. And I believe one of her principal
delights is teasing Miss Balmaine, who doesn't understand chaff in
the least. I hope her sister will be able to keep her in better
order when she comes."</p>

<p>"I fancy the sister must have arrived," Misterton said,
listening.</p>

<p>They heard Lady Anne go out of her room by the door in the
corridor. Downstairs in the hall people were talking loudly. Cardyn
unlocked a drawer, took out a fat notebook with a patent clasp, and
handed it to Misterton.</p>

<p>"I want you to glance through this and see what I have been
doing. All in cipher, of course."</p>

<p>Just at this moment there came a shriek from the garden:</p>

<p>"No, no! you shall not have it! I am going to show it to
Dorothy."</p>

<p>"Give it to me this minute, you naughty child!" There was an
unmistakable sound of tears in Miss Balmaine's voice.</p>

<p>Cardyn saw that Maureen was brandishing a piece of paper about,
while taking care to keep a flower-bed between herself and Miss
Balmaine.</p>

<p>"I should like to look at that," he said quickly. He hurried out
of the room and downstairs to the garden.</p>

<p>There was a group of people in the hall, but he did not turn his
head as he ran through. Outside he caught the child, Maureen, from
the back and snatched the picture from her hand almost before she
knew he was there. He had time to see that it was a sketch of a
fair-haired girl in water-colours, who bore a striking resemblance
to Miss Balmaine, and underneath was written in a clear masculine
handwriting, with which he had become oddly familiar of late,
"Daisy Melville, April, 19&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was only a glance he had as he went forward, while Maureen,
with an angry exclamation sprang up trying to tear it from his
hands.</p>

<p>"This is your property, I believe, Miss Balmaine," he said as he
held it out over Maureen's head.</p>

<p>That young lady gave a howl of rage.</p>

<p>"I call that frightfully mean of you, Mr. Cardyn!"</p>

<p>She wriggled away from Cardyn and ran towards the door.</p>

<p>"Anyway, he had a good look at it before he gave it to you," she
called back mischievously. "I believe he is in love with you,
Margaret! He is always asking questions about you!"</p>

<p>Then, a most unusual thing with Bruce Cardyn, he suddenly lost
his temper.</p>

<p>"Damn!" he exclaimed. "I beg your pardon, Miss Balmaine, but
really that child&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please say it again for me." Margaret Balmaine laughed. She had
rapidly recovered her selfpossession, though her breathing was
still quickened, and her blue eyes were sparkling with anger.
"Maureen is simply intolerable. Any language about her is
excusable. Lady Anne ought really to get a holiday governess for
her if she stays away from school. She is always about with the
housemaid, Alice, which is not good for her. But I suspect she will
be better when Dorothy is at home."</p>

<p>She broke off as Maureen came out again, clinging to the arm of
a tall girl at sight of whom Bruce Cardyn rubbed his eyes in
amazement. A tall girl in a long motoring coat, a pull-on hat over
her chestnut-hair&mdash;hair which had been bobbed once and which
was now allowed to curl at its own sweet will round the pretty
smiling face with its brown eyes and its colour coming and going;
and there was, in spite of the difference in everything&mdash;age,
expression and colouring&mdash;a distinct likeness to Lady
Anne.</p>

<p>The eyes opened wide now with an expression as astonished as
those of Bruce Cardyn. She did not even glance at Miss Balmaine who
had rolled up the sketch in her hand and was now coming towards
her.</p>

<p>"You!" she exclaimed. "You!"</p>

<p>"You!" Bruce Cardyn echoed blankly. "I did not know that
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am Dorothy Fyvert." The girl held out her hands to him with a
pretty welcoming gesture. "And you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am Bruce Cardyn&mdash;Lady Anne Daventry's secretary," the
man interrupted as he bent low over the outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"But, Dorothy, Dorothy, do you know him?" Maureen burst in,
shaking her sister's arm up and down in her excitement. "Because,
when I told you I did not like him&mdash;not even as well as I had
liked Mr. Branksome&mdash;you never said&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Fyvert touched her small sister rebukingly. "Hush! Maureen,
darling. It is not at all kind to say you do not like people. And
you will have to like Mr. Cardyn very much because he saved my life
once!"</p>

<p>"O&mdash;h!" Maureen's eyes were wide with excitement now.
"Dorothy, you don't mean&mdash;you can't mean that he is the man
who climbed up and got you out of the fire!"</p>

<p>"At Lady Barminster's&mdash;yes!" Dorothy answered, her pretty
eyes smiling at the young man. "How often I have wanted to thank
you!" she went on. "It does seem strange that we should meet at
last&mdash;here&mdash;like this!"</p>

<p>"It does, indeed!" Cardyn responded, thinking she little knew
how strange.</p>

<p>"I am so glad&mdash;" Dorothy was beginning when she was
interrupted by a cry from the house.</p>

<p>"Dorothy! Dorothy! where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here, here!" the girl called back. She smiled again at Cardyn.
"At any rate I shall see you again soon. We shall not lose sight of
one another now."</p>

<p>Cardyn saw that quite a crowd of young people seemed to take
possession of her altogether.</p>

<p>He felt a curious sense of depression as he followed more slowly
and made his way back to the little study where Monsieur Melange
was still poring over the miniatures.</p>

<p>"Zis&mdash;zis, is very fine. I see too a likeness&mdash;a
resemblance to ze Lady Anne," he said as Cardyn came in.</p>

<p>The younger man realized at once that some one was in Lady
Anne's room. He sat down and hastily scribbled a line on a scrap of
paper and handed it to Monsieur Melange.</p>

<p>"Find out as soon as possible what is known of the past of a
young actress called Daisy Melville, probably playing in Sydney in
the summer of last year."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>"This is my new secretary, John&mdash;Mr. Bruce Cardyn."</p>

<p>"How-d'ye-do." John Daventry shook hands heartily, as they sat
down to the luncheon table.</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn glanced keenly at the young man who was now taking
the place opposite Lady Anne.</p>

<p>There was nothing very remarkable about John Daventry. He was
just the ordinary well set-up, well-dressed young Englishman, with
a rather unusually attractive expression, perhaps. Certainly no one
could have looked less like a murderer, above all a secret
poisoner, Bruce Cardyn decided as he studied the fair, regular
features, the sunburnt skin telling of an outdoor life as the
regular white teeth and bright dark eyes spoke of perfect
health.</p>

<p>But Cardyn had been long enough in his chosen profession to know
that nothing is more deceptive than the appearance. Some of the
worst criminals have been handsome, pleasant-looking people, whose
most important asset has been their charming manner. Wherefore he
by no means crossed John Daventry off his list of suspects.</p>

<p>Dorothy Fyvert was sitting lower down the table on the same side
as Cardyn. But it was noticeable that Daventry did not seem to have
any glances to spare for her. Constantly his eyes wandered in the
direction of his newly-found cousin, Margaret Balmaine. Miss
Balmaine was opposite&mdash;all her attention apparently given to
the man who sat next her and who had come with Lady Barminster.</p>

<p>Next to Lady Anne on one side was Monsieur Melange. Bruce Cardyn
could hear him discussing miniatures with her and old Lady
Barminster, Maureen was next to Cardyn himself. Quite evidently he
had incurred her severe displeasure. He could see little but one
hunched-up shoulder and the bright bobbed hair that was so like her
sister's.</p>

<p>For a long time there was a perfect babel of conversation in
which it was difficult to distinguish any one voice, but at last
one clear young voice rang out above the others:</p>

<p>"Lady Anne, after lunch will you show us your pearls? Lady
Barminster was telling us yesterday what magnificent jewels you
had, amongst others a wonderful rope of pearls, that your father
and mother gave you on your birthdays."</p>

<p>Lady Anne looked rather surprised.</p>

<p>"I do not often show my jewels. I do not often look at them
myself," she said, slowly. "My jewel-wearing days are over. My
pearls seldom see the light. They were given to me one by one by my
parents. They began, I believe, on my very first birthday of all,
and afterwards every Christmas and New Year as well as birthdays
and other joyful occasions found my chain added to. My husband
liked the idea and helped to carry it out. The old diamond and
enamel clasp that fastens it was one of his wedding gifts to me.
So, as you may imagine, my necklace is a fairly long one.
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>There arose quite a chorus of exclamations. Everyone seemed to
be talking at once, and all united at last in beseeching Lady Anne
to show her pearls.</p>

<p>In some moods, the very outcry would have made Lady Anne
determined to refuse, but to-day, it may be that the very peril in
which she stood had moved her.</p>

<p>"We will go up to my sitting-room after lunch and I will show
them to you," she promised.</p>

<p>"But you don't mean to say that you keep them in the house, Lady
Anne?" old Lord Barminster remonstrated. "Damned dangerous thing to
do. Ours are all at the Bank, and if my lady wants to make herself
smart unexpectedly she has to put up with paste!" He ended with a
chuckle that broke into a burst of coughing.</p>

<p>Lady Anne smiled serenely, but the curl of her upper lip
betrayed the fact that the Barminster jewels had never been high in
her estimation.</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn alone sat silent. The mention of the pearls gave
him new ground for thought. It did not seem that their presence in
the house could have anything to do with the mystery he was there
to investigate. They would certainly provide a motive for robbery
or burglary, but secret poisoning was in a different category
altogether. Yet, for all this conviction of his, he had a certain
presentiment that the clue to the maze in which he was wandering
had been placed in his hands, though at present he did not see how
to make use of it. His eyes strayed to Monsieur Melange's mildly
bored face; only miniatures appeared to interest that gentleman,
and he was obviously waiting his opportunity to turn again to Lady
Anne with his mild prattle of Coros and Lavellettos.</p>

<p>Cardyn himself was thinking over the problem of the jewels when
an hour later he realized, from the merry chatter in Lady Anne's
room, that her guests were keeping her to her word. Monsieur
Melange had departed pleading another engagement immediately after
lunch. Lord and Lady Barminster with certain of their guests had
gone on their way wishing to make the most of the daylight, so that
only John Daventry and a couple of girls the Barminsters had
brought with them remained.</p>

<p>Cardyn had purposely left the communicating door ajar and
presently he heard Lady Anne call out:</p>

<p>"You there, Mr. Cardyn? I am going to turn all these noisy young
people in to you while get my pearls out. I don't care that the
secret that guards them should be known to every one. People may be
all right by themselves, but their associates may be burglars or
the Lord knows who!"</p>

<p>"My dear Aunt Anne, what a lurid imagination you have, or have
you been taking a course of detective novels?" John Daventry
laughed as he held the door open for the girls.</p>

<p>They all came across to the table where Cardyn had been working
and began to admire the miniatures.</p>

<p>John Daventry did not pretend to be much interested.</p>

<p>"We have drawers full of them at the Keep," he said. "But I
would almost as soon have a lot of old photographs. If you don't
know the people, what good are they?"</p>

<p>"What a Goth you are, John!" Dorothy laughed as she bent over
the tray. "It must be most absorbing work, Mr. Cardyn."</p>

<p>"It is rather," Bruce assented, his brows contracting as he
noticed how John Daventry's eyes followed every movement of
Margaret Balmaine, and how his voice softened as he spoke to her.
Was Dorothy Fyvert to be slighted for this girl? And
yet&mdash;Cardyn himself had hardly realized until he met her again
how the memory of Dorothy Fyvert had haunted his dreams since that
night, two years ago, when he brought her out of the burning house
in his arms&mdash;how often he had recalled her sweet brown eyes,
with their long up-curling lashes, her pretty hair, bobbed then,
now attempting to grow again and curling at its own sweet will all
over her small head.</p>

<p>But of what use was it for a poor detective to dream of Lady
Anne Daventry's niece? He gave himself a shake, called himself a
blockhead, and, disregarding John Daventry's black looks, went over
to Miss Balmaine who was standing by the window looking into the
garden. She welcomed him with a bright smile. A man is always a man
to a woman of Margaret Balmaine's type.</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn smiled too. He was anxious just at the present to
get on friendly terms with Margaret Balmaine, to have a little
private conversation with her, and hitherto he had not been able to
find an opportunity. He did not see how Dorothy Fyvert's eyes
followed him, a wistful look in their brown depths. Was he, too, to
fall a victim to this strange girl's fascination?</p>

<p>"Any more encounters with Maureen, Miss Balmaine?" he questioned
lightly.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not yet, I am glad to say. I have not your command of language,
you see!" she said demurely.</p>

<p>"It might be acquired," he suggested.</p>

<p>"Fancy Lady Anne's wrath if it were." Miss Balmaine laughed.
"Seriously, though, I find Maureen a most disturbing element in the
house. She is not really obedient to Dorothy. And she is always
racing about with one of the housemaids, as I told you, and I don't
think it improves her."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it does," Cardyn acquiesced. "Still, I dare say
a little running wild won't hurt the child. She has such high
spirits that she must find being cooped up in school very
trying."</p>

<p>"And other people find it very trying when she isn't," Miss
Balmaine said petulantly.</p>

<p>"I dare say they do," Bruce agreed. "I hear you come from
Sydney, Miss Balmaine."</p>

<p>The girl did not look pleased at the sudden change of
subject.</p>

<p>"Not from Sydney," she said shortly. "My home was many miles
away."</p>

<p>"You must have had a very interesting life out there," Cardyn
went on. "I have often meant to go out to Australia. I have even
thought of settling down there, but something has always stood in
the way."</p>

<p>"You have never been there?" the girl questioned.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"Well, I have. As a matter of fact I was born there, but I was
brought home when I was too young to have properly appreciated my
birthplace. Still, I suppose&mdash;" he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"it may be because it is my birthplace that it
appeals to me."</p>

<p>Margaret Balmaine's face altered indefinably.</p>

<p>"Where were you born?"</p>

<p>"In Melbourne, I believe," Bruce lied. "But my parents moved
up-country and took a sheep farm there. They did not make it
pay&mdash;in fact, lost all their money. Still, Miss
Balmaine&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a sharp cry from the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cardyn! Mr. Cardyn! Come!"</p>

<p>It was Lady Anne's voice.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what he feared, Bruce sprang to the intervening
door and flung it open. Lady Anne was standing before her
escritoire as if she had pulled herself up in her agitation. Her
face was towards them, and it was white; the fear in her eyes that
Bruce had seen on his first visit had deepened. Her left hand with
the great diamond flashing over her wedding ring was grasping the
top of the escritoire, and shaking as it clasped, so that in the
momentary silence that followed her cry the two who were first in
the room, Bruce Cardyn and John Daventry, could hear the rattling
of the various objects that always stood before Lady Anne on the
writing flap.</p>

<p>"My pearls! John! Mr. Cardyn!" she cried, as the two men caught
her arms and helped her back to her chair. "My pearls have
gone!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" John Daventry began. "You must have put them
somewhere else."</p>

<p>"When did you see them last?" Bruce Cardyn's voice cut across
the other's, cool and incisive.</p>

<p>"About a month ago." Lady Anne's voice was firm and as
controlled as ever now. She sat up and put John Daventry's arm from
her. "I am not a fool to make a mistake about a thing of that kind.
I remember exactly when I saw them and remember thinking that the
clasp was loose and must be seen to."</p>

<p>"Where did you keep them?" Cardyn questioned.</p>

<p>For answer Lady Anne pointed to the escritoire. The door in the
middle stood open and Cardyn saw that the back was a sliding panel
after the fashion of those beloved of the Florentine makers. Behind
it was an aperture, large, comparing it with the size of the
escritoire; inside were several cases&mdash;one lay in front of
Lady Anne on the flap. It was open and empty.</p>

<p>"You see," said Lady Anne. "The last time I had that case out
the pearls were there. Now they are gone in spite of all my
precautions. And&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused. Cardyn and Daventry peered into the open cavity. The
girls stood in the doorway huddled together in a frightened
fashion.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Anne! It can't be true! But I don't believe they can
have been stolen&mdash;your lovely pearls! You must have put them
somewhere else," Dorothy cried, while Margaret Balmaine looked on
in horrified dismay.</p>

<p>"Put them somewhere else, indeed," Lady Anne said with a snort
of contempt. "Are you a fool, child, or do you take me for one? I
tell you, I put the pearls in there myself a month ago with all the
usual precautions, and they have been taken away. Not by a burglar
or a thief. No lock or spring has been broken. All have been
unfastened and fastened again without any sign that a strange hand
has touched them. Some one has learned the secret of the safe and
used it, and has also got hold of my keys."</p>

<p>"Did absolutely no one know this secret but yourself, Lady
Anne?" Bruce Cardyn questioned in an authoritative tone that made
John Daventry look at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Absolutely no one," Lady Anne cried emphatically.</p>

<p>"Your maid?"</p>

<p>"Knows no more than anyone else," Lady Anne answered, her eyes
glancing from the detective to John Daventry, from him again to the
group of girls in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Carry your memory back, Lady Anne, and see if you can recall
any incident, however slight, that might have given anyone an
inkling of the secret spring," Cardyn said again. "Sometimes a word
is dropped that might be interpreted by some one on the look-out,
or a letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neither written nor spoken word has been dropped by me," Lady
Anne declared with decision. "Still, I suppose there are burglars
clever enough to set any precautions at naught." And as she spoke
her keen eyes were watching, searching all the faces around.</p>

<p>"It would be a clever burglar who found the pearls in their
hiding-place without help, and took them away without leaving any
trace," Cardyn said quickly. "The other cases in the escritoire,
Lady Anne. Have you looked whether their contents are safe?"</p>

<p>"No." Lady Anne leaned forward and opened one. "This is all
right. I expect they all are. There is nothing of any value
there&mdash;there has been nothing but the pearls for some months.
Fortunately I moved my diamonds and all my rings, except the one I
always wear, some time ago, to the Bank&mdash;rings are out of
place on crippled hands and knuckles swollen by arthritis. So they
are all safe and the thieves have not had so big a haul as they
expected."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, my dear aunt, in spite of that they have had a
remarkably good haul in taking several thousand pounds' worth of
pearls." John Daventry looked at Cardyn who was searching the
hiding-place in the escritoire as though he thought the young man
was taking too much upon himself. "Scotland Yard must be called in
at once," he went on. "It is quite useless for amateurs to make
suggestions."</p>

<p>"Quite!" Lady Anne agreed in her clear, crisp tones. "Do not
trouble, John, I shall consult the police as soon as possible.
Mercy on us! What is this?"</p>

<p>"This" was a loud wail that was set up from the doorway. Some
one appeared to be going into hysterics.</p>

<p>"It is Pirnie, Lady Anne," said Margaret Balmaine. The girl
looked frightened to death, her make-up standing out in ghastly
contrast with the pallor of her face. "She was going by and I told
her your pearls were missing."</p>

<p>Lady Anne could not suppress an expression of impatience.</p>

<p>"I wish you had held your tongue, Margaret. Don't be an
hysterical fool, Pirnie!" she said, raising her voice. "If I do not
weep and lament surely you need not."</p>

<p>"Oh, my lady, my lady! I can't get over it," the woman wailed as
she pushed herself in front of Dorothy Fyvert.</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn looked at her curiously. She was the one member of
the household of whom he had hitherto seen the least. She was a
tall, rather affected-looking woman evidently verging on
middle-age, while clinging with both hands to the last vestige of
youth. She still retained the remains of early good looks.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it, my lady! Your lovely pearls gone, that I
have always been so proud of. I have always wanted you to put them
in the Bank, your ladyship knows, and now I suppose everybody will
be saying that I have taken them, though I'm as innocent as a babe
unborn."</p>

<p>"Now may Heaven grant me patience with a fool!" Lady Anne
groaned in her exasperation. "Please wait to protest your innocence
until you are accused, Pirnie!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>"Detective Inspector Furnival will be here as soon as possible,"
Lady Anne announced.</p>

<p>She had come into the small study where Bruce Cardyn was
working, walking with her stick as usual, and disdaining all
proffered help. She waited before closing the door, and spoke
apparently for the benefit of those behind her:</p>

<p>"I wish you to receive him, Mr. Cardyn, and to do what you can
to help him."</p>

<p>Then she shut the door very carefully and came forward
totteringly to the chair the young man placed for her.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said interrogatively. "Is this robbery of the pearls
connected with the work you have in hand?"</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't quite see the connexion, Lady Anne, since, if the thief
were already in possession of the pearls, it is difficult to
understand why he should wish you out of the way."</p>

<p>"Unless he&mdash;or she," Lady Anne said very deliberately,
"wished to possess himself&mdash;or herself&mdash;of the
diamonds."</p>

<p>"And that, as they were at the Bank, he was hardly likely to
do," Bruce remarked. "Unless they came to him by inheritance. And
Mr. Daventry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Daventry will not inherit my diamonds," Lady Anne said
sharply. "I have left them to my niece, Miss Dorothy Fyvert."</p>

<p>"Then that settles the question of any connexion, of course,"
Bruce said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Naturally it does," Lady Anne agreed with a far-away look in
her eyes. "Well, Mr. Cardyn, it is no use your or my spending time
in guessing. What I came to you to say is, I wish no faintest hint
of the work you are really here to do to reach Inspector Furnival's
ears, until I give you permission."</p>

<p>Bruce sat silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"That will be extremely difficult, Lady Anne! Inspector Furnival
does not know me personally, it is true, but he is sure to discover
who am, and then how am to account for my presence here?"</p>

<p>"I do not care, you must invent something," Lady Anne said in
her most autocratic manner. "What is the good of your being a
detective if you cannot?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," Cardyn went on, "that the two cases are so
interwoven that he would find the knowledge a help in his
task."</p>

<p>"I do not care about that," Lady Anne snapped. Then, her manner
growing more impressive, "Don't you understand, Mr. Cardyn, that I
called you in instead of the regular police because, when you have
discovered my would-be murderer, I may wish the whole affair hushed
up&mdash;-for the sake of my family?" Her voice sank to a whisper
and she got up, carefully averting her eyes from Bruce Cardyn's
face.</p>

<p>He got up too, and mechanically offered her his arm, one
conclusion forcing itself upon him&mdash;"Then she has some
suspicion after all! But who?"</p>

<p>It was not an hour yet since the loss of the pearls had been
discovered, and had thrown the usually peaceful household at the
house in Charlton Crescent in a ferment. Bruce Cardyn and John
Daventry had searched the escritoire together carefully, but had
found no trace of the missing jewels and had only made themselves
certain of what Lady Anne had said at first&mdash;the locks and
springs that guarded the pearls had not been tampered with.
Everything had been opened and reclosed in the ordinary way. Some
one had found out the secret of the escritoire&mdash;but who? It
seemed difficult to imagine that anyone outside the house could
have had an opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>From the moment of her outburst, Cardyn had had an uneasy
feeling that Pirnie had known more than she acknowledged, though he
realized that he had not the slightest real ground for his
suspicion except the knowledge that she must have had many more
opportunities of watching Lady Anne when she put away the pearls or
got them out. There was something about Pirnie's face that he did
not like too, and he had fancied that her dramatic outburst when
she heard of the loss of the pearls did not ring quite true.</p>

<p>Lady Anne, however, evidently resented his suspicions of her
maid, who appeared to be the only person in whose profession of
affection she had any faith. Pirnie had insisted on searching in
every likely and unlikely place for the pearls since their loss had
been found out, and Cardyn had kept her as much as possible under
observation.</p>

<p>Already the short January twilight was creeping on, and Bruce
Cardyn was about to switch on the electric light when the door
opened and Margaret Balmaine put her head in.</p>

<p>"Why, how miserable you look here, Mr. Cardyn! No lights and the
fire out? We have at least got a good fire in Lady Anne's
sitting-room, and Lady Anne says you are to come in and have some
tea. We must try and pull ourselves together even if the pearls are
lost. Soames has brought us up some lovely hot scones. He is doing
all the waiting himself, just as if it were a wedding or a
funeral!"</p>

<p>"Poor old Soames! A butler always feels most at home at one of
the above-mentioned ceremonies, I fancy," Cardyn said as he
followed her. But though he spoke with apparent lightness his eyes
had never been keener or more alert than now, as he glanced from
one to the other of the little group round the fire in Lady Anne's
sitting-room.</p>

<p>Lady Anne herself was sitting near the escritoire in her
revolving chair; Dorothy Fyvert was busy at the tea-table; and John
Daventry stood on the hearthrug waiting to hand round the hot
cakes. By the flickering light of the flames as they leaped up
Cardyn could see that every face looked white and troubled. Lady
Anne's was the most unmoved of them all; her hands, with their
rheumatic knuckles were resting on the open flap of the escritoire
before her. Every now and then her eyes wandered curiously round,
and Cardyn guessed that she was asking herself whether it
was&mdash;whether it could be possible that one of these dear
familiar people had robbed her of her pearls and, not content with
despoiling her, was further encompassing her death?</p>

<p>A great pang of pity for her loneliness shot through him. The
death of her boys had left her bereft indeed, and she had turned
her hardest side to the world ever since, but he guessed that the
apparent hardness covered a kind and loyal heart.</p>

<p>Various odd pieces of jewellery were lying about the room on the
Victorian centre-table and on the flap of the writing-table. Lady
Anne smiled as she saw Bruce looking at them.</p>

<p>"Various treasures that Pirnie had unearthed in her zeal that no
possible place of hiding for the pearls should be overlooked," she
remarked. "Of no value, most of them. This is the only thing that
is worth much&mdash;a dagger." And she reached out her hand and
picked up a short slender blade set in a gold and jewelled handle.
"That was given to my father when he was in India by one of the
native princes. It is said to be worth something fabulous."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember seeing this when I was a boy," John Daventry
said as he came forward and weighed it in his hand. "A nice sort of
toy. I expect you would be a match for a whole army of burglars
with this, Aunt Anne. You wouldn't lose any more pearls if the
thieves knew you were armed with this."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't any more pearls to lose," Lady Anne said in her
most matter-of-fact tones. "And, if I had, I am sure my poor
rheumatic hands would not be able to defend them. Where is Maureen,
Dorothy?"</p>

<p>"She has been out for a walk with Alice. They seem to have some
great secret together to-day." Miss Fyvert answered. "And I believe
she is having tea with Alice too. I am quite out of favour with
her, and I fancy she is sulking because I would not talk to her
about the pearls. She is such an excitable child, and quite fond
enough of talking about robbers and burglars as it is. She is very
fond of Alice too."</p>

<p>"Too fond, I think," Miss Balmaine said significantly. "She
would not be allowed to be so much with the servants if she were my
sister. I should get a temporary governess for her until she goes
back to school."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we shall have to do something of the sort," said
Dorothy absently. "But Maureen will hate it so, and Alice is quite
a nice girl. Cream, Mr. Cardyn, and sugar?"</p>

<p>"No cream, please. But sugar&mdash;heaps of it&mdash;three lumps
at least," Bruce said as he strode up to take his cup from her
hand. "How this Russian fashion of taking lemon in tea grows. It
wouldn't do for me."</p>

<p>"Nor for me either," Dorothy laughed. "I am a sugar-baby too.
Oh, Soames, how lovely! You do spoil us!" as the butler entered the
room with a tray of hot cakes in his hand.</p>

<p>"Only the spoiling is unnecessary as the last lot is not
finished yet," John Daventry said, helping himself to another piece
of cake.</p>

<p>Soames regarded him benevolently.</p>

<p>"They don't last long, sir. I know the young ladies' tastes. If
Miss Maureen&mdash;Ah!"</p>

<p>The covered dish which he was about to set upon the tea-table
dropped from his hand and he stood still, staring at the window
farthest from Lady Anne. His breath came quick and fast, his jaws
worked about from side to side. Everyone turned to look, and there
was an outburst of screams from the girls. Then Bruce Cardyn sprang
forward.</p>

<p>Outside the window, so close to the pane that it seemed to be
pressing against it, was a white face&mdash;a chalk-white face,
whether of man or woman none could tell. Around it there seemed to
float a grey mist. Spirit or living creature! Even Bruce Cardyn,
keen-witted detective as he was, felt a momentary doubt. He shook
the window. It was latched. As he raised his hand to open it he
momentarily took his eyes from the figure outside, and in that
moment it vanished. Throwing the sash up he leaned out, conscious
that the others were pressing up against him, calling, questioning,
exclaiming.</p>

<p>Hearing the outcry, a man came running across the grass towards
the house. Cardyn was rubbing his eyes in utter amazement; where on
earth had the figure at the window disappeared to? What in the
world had become of it? There was no ladder or rope to be seen, no
sign of anyone on the terrace beneath. And yet Bruce had only taken
his eyes off the creature, whatever it was, for one moment, not
time enough for the slickest burglar to have got away.</p>

<p>The man hastening over the lawn had reached the sundial at the
foot of the low terrace now&mdash;Cardyn knew him for one of his
underlings, put on as an extra gardener to watch the house.</p>

<p>"Bradley!" he shouted. "Some one has been trying to get into the
house and pretty nearly succeeded too. Did you see him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir!" said the man, staring upwards in a puzzled fashion,
"leastways, just as I heard the shouting I thought I saw something
moving on the wall, but didn't notice where it came from or where
it went to. I don't think it was a man&mdash;all gliding about like
a snake it was."</p>

<p>"Snakes haven't got white faces," Cardyn said sharply.</p>

<p>"The Cat Burglar!" One of the girls behind him cried out.</p>

<p>Cardyn never knew which, for in the pause which followed, his
quick ear caught another sound&mdash;a groan, a cry, a stifled
choking groan.</p>

<p>"What was that?" he cried, turning quickly and pushing back
those who were pressing against him&mdash;John Daventry, Margaret
Balmaine, Dorothy Fyvert and Soames.</p>

<p>Nobody answered him. Every one appeared to be struggling to lean
out of the window at once.</p>

<p>With a terrible prevision of evil, he extricated himself from
the crush. The next minute he knew that his prevision had been
horribly justified. Lady Anne sat still in her revolving chair, but
she had fallen aside and lay across the arm in a huddled-up
position. It was from her lips that cry had come&mdash;they were
still parted, open, and from one corner a thin stream of blood and
froth was trickling down her chin on to the laces of her gown.</p>

<p>As Cardyn reached her she opened her eyes and looked at him with
a gleam of comprehension.</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;it was&mdash;"</p>

<p>The last word broke in a rush of blood. Lady Anne's head fell
back, her jaw dropped, and before anyone could realize the horror
that had happened in their midst the keen-witted, clear-headed
mistress of the house in Charlton Crescent had ceased to exist. For
one moment he thought of heart failure&mdash;of an aneurism that
had burst crossed Cardyn's mind. Then in a flash he
realized&mdash;knew that what he had sworn to prevent had happened.
In spite of all his precautions Lady Anne's assassin had been
successful. But now John Daventry and Soames were beside him. They
cried aloud in horror; they tried to raise Lady Anne but she lay in
their arms a limp, inert mass.</p>

<p>"It is her heart&mdash;it has been weak for years! That brute
has killed her&mdash;the shock of seeing him at the window has
frightened her to death!"</p>

<p>"Shock had nothing to do with it," Cardyn said shortly. He
motioned Soames aside and took the pitiful-looking figure that till
ten minutes ago had been the masterful Lady Anne Daventry from John
Daventry. He rested it as well as he could against the wooden back
of a chair.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried, pointing downwards.</p>

<p>Protruding from the dead woman's breast was the gold and
jewelled dagger she had shown them half an hour before. And,
looking horribly incongruous among the laces of her fichu, a deep
stain was spreading.</p>

<p>Some one had switched on the electric light and Cardyn saw that
John Daventry's ruddy face had turned an ugly, sickly green, that
Dorothy Fyvert and Margaret Balmaine were clinging together,
shaking with fright&mdash;even in that awful moment his eyebrows
contracted at the sight&mdash;and that Soames stood staring at his
dead mistress like a man turned to stone. But as Bruce looked at
him his face twitched to one side, and he put up his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor lady! my poor lady!"</p>

<p>"But what does it mean&mdash;what has happened?" John Daventry
demanded, his voice and manners those of a man out of his mind.</p>

<p>For answer Cardyn pointed to the handle of the dagger&mdash;to
that ominous growing stain.</p>

<p>"Murder!" he said laconically. "Wilful murder!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>"I can't believe it! I can't believe it!" John Daventry
reiterated, pressing his handkerchief over his brow.</p>

<p>He had been saying the same thing at intervals ever since Cardyn
had literally pushed him out of the chamber of death. For in her
sitting-room Lady Anne still sat in death, where she had so often
sat in life, the eternal question that her eyes had asked of late,
answered at last&mdash;for her!</p>

<p>For the rest of them it had become a thousand times more
insistent, more acute. As Bruce Cardyn glanced round at the faces
of those who so short a time before had met in Lady Anne's
sitting-room for tea, he saw the same question in the eyes of
each&mdash;Who? Which?</p>

<p>Already they were beginning to draw shudderingly away from one
another. Even the two girls, instead of clinging together, were
eyeing one another furtively, shivering as each sat back in her
chair.</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn and John Daventry were standing in the middle of
the room. The shock of the horror seemed almost to have scared
Daventry's wits away.</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn had been literally forced to take command of the
situation. He it was who had insisted on the room being left
exactly as it was until the arrival of the doctor and the police.
He it was who had shepherded them all into the small library until
they had been questioned.</p>

<p>The only addition to their number had been Pirnie, Lady Anne's
maid, who knelt with her head against the sitting-room door,
moaning and crying and calling upon her dead mistress by name.</p>

<p>Soames stood by the other door. As far as outward appearances
went he was the attentive butler still, though a close observer
would have noticed that his hands were shaking, that his eyes
looked dull and strained. Even Bruce Cardyn, hardened detective
though he was, had had his nerves shaken by the shock of Lady
Anne's terrible death. He looked keenly at John Daventry now.</p>

<p>"Your belief, or non-belief, does not affect the situation
unfortunately, Mr. Daventry. Lady Anne has been foully done to
death in her own house and in our midst, and her murderer has to be
found and punished whoever he may be."</p>

<p>John Daventry ran his hand through his hair. Though his face had
somewhat recovered its ordinary colour, the sickly, greenish hue
had not wholly disappeared.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;Of course I know that Lady Anne is dead," he said,
with a little stammer between his words of which he had never been
conscious before. "Dead! Murdered! That is horrible enough, Heaven
knows. But you say&mdash;you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I say now what the world will probably say later," interrupted
Bruce Cardyn, "that Lady Anne may have been murdered by one of the
five people in the room."</p>

<p>"But how could it have been one of us?" Daventry stared at him
again. "Myself, yourself, Soames, the two girls&mdash;could one of
us have murdered her? Would any of us have murdered her?"</p>

<p>"Could anyone else have murdered her?" Bruce counter-questioned
pithily.</p>

<p>"The doors were not locked," John Daventry said, looking at
Soames. "Somebody might have rushed in from the outside."</p>

<p>"Yes. I have thought of that, sir," Soames interposed shakily.
"If the assassin had been in concealment outside&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or that brute at the window?" Daventry went on. "I believe
myself he did it by some devilry or other. I don't profess to know
how."</p>

<p>"It would be an impossibility," Bruce said shortly. The face at
the window was puzzling him more than he would have cared to
confess. "We were all at the open window looking for him. How could
he have got in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Daventry said moodily. "He seemed to vanish.
Where did he go anyway? As likely into that room as anywhere else,
I should say."</p>

<p>Bruce shook his head.</p>

<p>"He couldn't have come in through the window while we were all
looking out of it. The other window nearest Lady Anne was
closed."</p>

<p>"The window by her ladyship wasn't quite closed, sir," Soames
corrected. "Her ladyship," with a brave attempt to swallow down a
rising sob, "always had it left open a couple of inches at the top,
for ventilation like."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cardyn broke off. Steps were coming along the corridor. He
opened the door. Two men came up to him, one whose profession was
clearly stamped upon his clean-shaven face, its expression of
geniality for once overclouded. The other&mdash;a very familiar
face and figure to Bruce Cardyn&mdash;was Inspector Furnival of
Scotland Yard, a thin man of middle height, still considerably on
the sunny side of fifty.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"And that is all you can tell me, Mr. Cardyn?"</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival of Scotland Yard was the speaker. He sat at
the head of the table in the dining-room in Lady Daventry's house
in Charlton Crescent. He was rather unlike the ordinary detective
of fiction in that he was small and alert-looking. His sharp
inquisitive-looking little face had earned him the sobriquet of
"The Ferret," when he was lower down in the Force, and the name
stuck to him still. But there was many a crook who had learned to
dread the Ferret's gimlet-like grey eyes more than he dreaded
anything on earth.</p>

<p>Those same grey eyes were fixed on Bruce Cardyn's now, as if
they would force the truth out of him. The younger detective was
seated a little lower down the table where the clear light from a
French window fell full upon his face.</p>

<p>"Absolutely everything," he said, meeting the inspector's eyes
steadily. "It seems inconceivable, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you and I have learnt that there is nothing inconceivable,
Mr. Cardyn," the other interrupted. "Now, just let me run over my
notes. You and Mr. Daventry, and the two girls were at tea with
Lady Anne; the butler brought a tray in, and at the same moment a
sixth person appeared at the window furthest from Lady Anne. You
all rushed to the window, opened it, looked for the man outside. He
had apparently disappeared. You heard a groan, and when you turned
you found Lady Anne dead, stabbed to the heart with her own
dagger."</p>

<p>Bruce nodded.</p>

<p>"Quite correct!"</p>

<p>"And the inference you have drawn, I gather, is that the crime
was committed by one of the people in the room."</p>

<p>Bruce looked at him.</p>

<p>"Is it not unavoidable?"</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes were gazing out into the garden with an
abstracted far-away look just now.</p>

<p>"Not quite, think," he said gently. "How long were you at the
window, Mr. Cardyn?"</p>

<p>"I should think about three minutes," Bruce said thoughtfully.
"We were all so puzzled, or, speaking for myself, I should say I
was so puzzled by the disappearance of the face at the window, that
I signalled to one of my men who was walking about and watching the
house from the outside to know what he had seen of him."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;" the inspector prompted.</p>

<p>"And he fancied he had seen something move in the ivy. But
certainly no man had come down."</p>

<p>"Supposing he had gone up?" Inspector Furnival suggested.</p>

<p>Bruce shook his head.</p>

<p>"I thought of the roof at once, and looked up as well as down,
but there was no one to be seen. As a matter of fact getting up to
the roof at all in that fashion would be an
impossibility&mdash;-even for the most expert climber. The ivy gets
much thinner when it gets past the second floor, and stops
altogether far short of the roof."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Inspector Furnival was drumming with his
fingers on the table. Bruce Cardyn sat silent and motionless. His
face was grave and troubled. From the moment her summons reached
him, the case of Lady Anne Daventry had intrigued him as nothing
else had done during his career as a detective. He had felt so
hopeful, so certain of being able to safeguard Lady Anne, and to
discover her would-be murderer. And never before had he failed so
signally.</p>

<p>At last the inspector spoke again.</p>

<p>"I notice that you speak of the 'face at the window,' never of
the 'man.'"</p>

<p>"No," Bruce acknowledged. "Because from my own observation I
could not say whether it was a man or a woman. It was just like a
chalk-white face with staring eyes and a mass of black hair. There
seemed to be a kind of vague, intangible mist round it. That is all
I can say."</p>

<p>"And a very queer 'all' it is too," the inspector remarked. "Now
was it a real man or woman at all? Or was it&mdash;could it have
been an illusion caused by some arrangement of lights&mdash;thrown
on the window?"</p>

<p>"Not by any that I have heard of," Bruce said at once. "No. The
face looked solid enough. Besides, what reason could anyone have
for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, they might want to do exactly what really happened. To
divert your attention while the murder was committed," the
inspector proceeded, his grey eyes looking here, there and
everywhere except at the young man's face, and yet somehow noting
every change of expression that flitted over it. "Might not that
man, face, illusion, whatever it was, have been arranged for by
someone who was waiting outside the door until the opportunity
came? From what the butler says the door was not even shut."</p>

<p>Cardyn's face did not look responsive.</p>

<p>"Lady Anne was stabbed with her own dagger. No outsider could
have arranged for that to have been found close at hand."</p>

<p>"That might have been seized when the murderer got there. He may
have intended to use some other weapon, and been quick to see the
advantage that using her own dagger would give him."</p>

<p>"Yes, he would have had to be quick indeed!" Bruce asserted
satirically.</p>

<p>There was another pause. Both men were listening intently.</p>

<p>Though barely two hours had elapsed since Lady Anne's death,
already it seemed to Cardyn that a lifetime had passed away.
Inspector Furnival on the point of setting out for Charlton
Crescent, had had his steps quickened by telephone. The doctor had
been summoned in hot haste, but nothing could be done. The body had
been moved to the couch, so that Dr. Spencer could make his brief
examination, otherwise nothing in the room had been touched. The
very teacups and saucers the members of Lady Anne's party had been
using when Soames's cry startled them all still stood as they had
hastily set them down.</p>

<p>At last there came the sound for which they had been
waiting&mdash;a sharp knock at the door. At the same moment the
passionate weeping of a woman reached them&mdash;"Oh, my lady! my
lady!"</p>

<p>"Pirnie&mdash;Lady Anne's maid." Bruce Cardyn got up. "The woman
is absolutely useless. That is all she can do&mdash;she simply
cries all the time. Dr. Spencer is at the door, think."</p>

<p>The inspector motioned him to wait.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dr. Spencer is coming to report to us. But first I must
put one question to you, Mr. Cardyn. You were the first at the
window, you say. Of the other four people in the room was there
anyone else close to you all the time, so that you can confidently
say 'This one could not have been the murderer.'"</p>

<p>"They all seemed to be close to me all the time," Cardyn said
ruefully. "Pressing me hard, so that I could scarcely move, you
understand. But I could not say that any one of them was by me all
the time. The one who seemed to be perhaps the longest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" The inspector looked at him closely.</p>

<p>"Well, it was, I think, Mr. John Daventry," Bruce finished. "But
I could not be certain of all the time. Still, he was beside me
shouting to the man below a good deal of the time, it seems to me.
At the end, when I turned after hearing the groan, I recollect
pushing Soames, the butler, back. But I do not remember where Mr.
Daventry was then."</p>

<p>"John Daventry&mdash;um!" mused the inspector. "The heir, the
most obvious trail, but is it the right one?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Bruce Cardyn confessed. "He doesn't look like a
murderer, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No one ever does look like a murderer until he is found out,"
the inspector said sententiously. "My experience is that people who
look like murderers may be great philanthropists or prominent
politicians, but they never commit murders. Well, doctor"&mdash;as
Cardyn opened the door and Dr. Spencer came into the
room&mdash;"what have you to say to us?"</p>

<p>The doctor was a capable-looking man of middle age, with a
pleasant professional manner. Just now his face was white and
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Us!" he repeated, raising his eyebrows as he glanced at
Cardyn.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! I had forgotten. Now this must be strictly in
confidence, doctor. Mr. Bruce Cardyn, a member of one of the
best-known firms of private detectives, is here at Lady Anne's own
request, acting as her secretary, in order to discover, if
possible, her secret enemy in the house."</p>

<p>The doctor stared at him.</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;I don't understand&mdash;Do you mean that Lady
Anne&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Feared that what happened this afternoon might happen?" the
inspector finished. "Exactly! But you must understand that this
must go no further, doctor. Mr. Cardyn must remain the secretary to
the rest of the world. Now, what have you to tell us?"</p>

<p>"Nothing you do not know already," the doctor said slowly.
"Leaving technicalities to the inquest, Lady Anne died of the wound
caused by the dagger which was still in it when I came. It
penetrated to the heart and death must have taken place within a
few minutes. The blow must have been one of great force and I
should say struck by a person who knew just where to strike. That
is all I can tell you, inspector, and it will not help you much,
fear."</p>

<p>"One never knows," the inspector said enigmatically. "One
question, Dr. Spencer&mdash;you say 'a powerful blow.' Could it
have been struck by a woman?"</p>

<p>"It depends upon the woman," the doctor said after a pause.
"But, yes&mdash;I should say that in these days of athletic women
most of them are as capable of striking hard as a man. But you
surely do not think that&mdash;that a woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not thinking anything at present," Inspector Furnival
interrupted. "I am trying to find out the truth, doctor."</p>

<p>"Quite so, I understand that. But there is one thing that has
struck me might be a means of ascertaining the truth." The doctor
laid his hat and stick on the table. "I am a bit of a criminologist
myself, and in reading both real and imaginary accounts of crime it
has struck me how very often finger-prints have been the means of
tracking down the criminal. Now in this case, surely the
dagger&mdash;the handle I mean, must bear the marks of&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something like a faint smile flitted momentarily over the
inspector's face.</p>

<p>"I have not neglected what certainly does look like an obvious
clue, doctor. But unfortunately so many people have handled the
dagger, incidentally, Lady Anne herself, that I am afraid that it
will not carry us much further."</p>

<p>"Ah, well! It is your job not mine." The doctor took up his hat.
"I am more grieved than can say that such a thing should have
occurred. Lady Anne was one of my oldest patients and I shall miss
her more than I can realize at present. And I trust that so cruel a
crime will not long go unavenged. Well, if there is nothing more
that I can tell you, inspector&mdash;we shall meet at the inquest
to-morrow."</p>

<p>When the door had closed behind him the inspector made a rapid
note in his book.</p>

<p>"Not very enlightening, that gentleman, now for Mr. John
Daventry!"</p>

<p>John Daventry kept them waiting for some little time. The
inspector occupied himself in studying his notes and adding a few
words, his face gloomy and abstracted. Bruce Cardyn did not move.
He was going over and over again the tragedy of this afternoon. Who
could be guilty? Was it one of the four people in the room with
him, or could it possibly have been, as the inspector suggested,
some outsider? The face at the window too! Rack his brains as he
would he could think of no explanation of this, to him the most
inexplicable feature of the whole affair. With all the precautions
he had taken it would have seemed an actual impossibility that
anyone should have got up to the window of Lady Anne's room without
being discovered at once. Yet the thing had happened.</p>

<p>John Daventry's face still bore evident marks of disturbance
when at last he appeared.</p>

<p>"You asked for me, inspector?"</p>

<p>The inspector pointed to a chair next to Bruce Cardyn.</p>

<p>"Do you mind sitting there, Mr. Daventry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't sit down, thanks."</p>

<p>Yet under the inspector's compelling eye, John Daventry walked
over and laid his hand on the chair indicated.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact you were lucky to catch me at all. The car
will be round in a minute to take me to Daventry Keep. I want to
break the news to my mother myself."</p>

<p>The inspector's hand still pointed to the chair.</p>

<p>"I think not, Mr. Daventry. You must let some one else break the
news to them at the Keep. Don't you understand that no
one&mdash;<i>no one</i> may leave this house without my
permission?"</p>

<p>John Daventry stared at him.</p>

<p>"No one may leave this house without your permission!" he
repeated contemptuously. "My good man, are you going out of your
mind? I know that you police have a very exalted idea of your own
powers. But really&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inspector pushed back his chair and stood up.</p>

<p>"You do not seem to comprehend at all the gravity of the
situation, Mr. Daventry. A foul and terrible murder has been
committed in this house this afternoon, and up till now we have
entirely failed to trace the guilty one. In these circumstances
every one of the five in the room must be suspect. All of them are
under observation and should any one of them attempt to leave the
house without my permission, he&mdash;or she&mdash;will at once be
placed under arrest."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it!" That curious sickly pallor was stealing
over John Daventry's face again. "You can't seriously think that
one of us stabbed Aunt Anne? The very idea would be ludicrous if it
were not so tragic."</p>

<p>"What do you think yourself, Mr. Daventry?" The Ferret's eyes
had never been more gimletlike.</p>

<p>"I can't think." John Daventry ran his hands through his short
hair. "But the idea that it was any one of us is inconceivable. The
two girls must be out of the question, and I would trust Soames
with my life any day. It must have been that blighter at the
window, I said so at once."</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes did not relax their watchful gaze for a
moment.</p>

<p>"You are talking of an impossibility, Mr. Daventry. The man
could not have got through the window while you were all looking
out."</p>

<p>Daventry stirred impatiently.</p>

<p>"Not at that window, of course he couldn't. But the other
one&mdash;nearest to Aunt Anne&mdash;was open at the top. Soames
says she would always have it so. The fellow must have managed it
somehow through that. Oh, I don't pretend to say exactly how. But
there is this chap, the Cat Burglar the papers have been full of
lately, and how he has got up the most impossible looking walls.
They say he has clamps on his feet, don't you know, or something of
that kind&mdash;makes him stick to a flat surface like a fly. And
those little beggars can walk upside-down on the ceiling."</p>

<p>The inspector did not appear to be particularly impressed by
this fact in natural history.</p>

<p>"He would have needed clamps on his hands too, I fancy, to get
through that window, stab Lady Anne and get back without any of you
seeing him. No, Mr. Daventry, we shall have to think of some more
likely story than that."</p>

<p>"Look here!" John Daventry started up "Mr. Inspector Furnival,
or whatever you call yourself, it strikes me that you are trying to
be offensive. The police are always making mistakes, and you will
find you have made a pretty big one if you don't take care. An
Englishman's house is his castle, you know. And it would not take
much to make me put you out of this neck and crop, detective
inspector or not."</p>

<p>The inspector did not move; his little eyes still maintained
their careful watch on the young man's face.</p>

<p>"Only you see, you do not happen to be master of this house at
present, Mr. Daventry."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? I stand in my aunt's place," John Daventry
blustered. "What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"I mean that until Lady Anne's lease of this house expires or is
disposed of, her legal heir and representative is her executor and
brother, the Rev. and Hon. Augustus Fyvert, rector of North Coton,
to whom I have wired, and who will be here by the next train," the
inspector said coldly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>"And now," observed the inspector. "I think we will have another
look at the sitting-room. There are certain papers that must be
gone through."</p>

<p>It was the day after Lady Anne Daventry's death. The inquest had
been opened in the morning, but only formal evidence had been taken
and, after hearing Dr. Spencer, the coroner had adjourned for a
week to give the police time for their inquiries.</p>

<p>Both the inspector and Cardyn had been up most of the night,
though so far their efforts had produced no result. The rector of
North Coton and his wife had arrived the night before and had been
too much overcome by the shock and the horror of Lady Anne's death
to be of any assistance. Mr. Fyvert had, however, commissioned
Cardyn to stay in the house to investigate the circumstances of
Lady Anne's death, in conjunction with the police. John Daventry
still remained fuming at his enforced detention, but neither he nor
the two girls had attended the inquest.</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn and the inspector walked back to the house together
from the little hall in the side street where the inquest had been
held.</p>

<p>Soames himself opened the door for them. His mistress's death
was making an old man of him. His usually bland, benevolent-looking
face was puckered and miserable; evidently he had been crying; his
eyes were red-rimmed and his mouth was twitching.</p>

<p>"Oh, couldn't you have stopped it, Mr. Furnival? All those
common men tramping up the stairs and right into my lady's room! To
say nothing of seeing my poor lady herself. It is what her ladyship
would have hated above everything."</p>

<p>"Her ladyship would have wished her murderer found, Mr. Soames,"
the inspector said, laying his hand on the man's bowed shoulder.
"We have good reason to know that."</p>

<p>"Have you?" Soames gulped down a lump in his throat. "There's
one thing I wondered whether I ought to mention to you. It is only
a trifle, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing is a trifle in a case of this kind," the inspector said
gravely. "A straw shows which way the wind blows."</p>

<p>"Just so. That is what I thought. Otherwise I shouldn't have
troubled you&mdash;but if you will come this way&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went to a small window at the end of the hall, looking into
the garden.</p>

<p>"That window is always kept locked, by her ladyship's orders,
she being nervous of tramps and so many of them about nowadays.
Well, when I went round, as my custom is, to see to the fastenings
of the windows and doors, that window was open, at least I should
say not fastened, and not quite shut at the top, as if some one had
got out hurriedly and not been able to push it up from the outside.
I&mdash;I'm ashamed to say that I did not regard it of any
importance last night&mdash;I&mdash;we were all so upset about my
lady. But, when I heard Mr. Fyvert say this morning that her
ladyship must have been stabbed by one of the people in the room,
it did strike me that the&mdash;the murderer might have been in
hiding in the house and rushed in and&mdash;and accomplished his
purpose while we were all engaged with the man at the window, and
then made his escape."</p>

<p>The inspector was looking at the window.</p>

<p>"Very well thought out," he said approvingly. "You would make a
first-rate detective. But, if the window were pushed up from the
outside as you suggest, there ought to be very distinct footmarks
in the flower border below."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose there ought," Soames said uncertainly. "But it
didn't strike me to look, me being fresh to this kind of thing, as
you may say," his voice dying away apologetically.</p>

<p>The inspector threw up the sash, noticing how stiffly it moved
as he did so. He leaned out and looked down.</p>

<p>"I believe there are some marks," he said as he withdrew his
head. "Mr. Cardyn, suppose we take a look at them from the
outside."</p>

<p>He drew the window down again and turned off to the door at the
end of the hall, which Soames opened for him. He did not go any
farther with the detectives but stood watching them with
interest.</p>

<p>The inspector took out a measuring tape and a magnifying-glass.
Then he carefully picked out a couple of large flat stones from the
rockery and put them on the border so that he could cross it
without putting his feet on the mould.</p>

<p>"Four very distinct footmarks," he called out to Cardyn. "Two
with their toes turned to the house, as if the man had just let
himself down from the window&mdash;rather deep, too, as if he had
shut it as he stood&mdash;and two with their toes turned to the
garden as if he had gone off that way. Well, so far so good. We
must have impressions made of those footmarks, Mr. Cardyn."</p>

<p>Cardyn did not speak for a moment; his grey eyes were thoughtful
as he scrutinized the flower border.</p>

<p>"I see the marks by the window plainly enough. But did the
beggar get away? He couldn't have taken a flying leap from where he
stood to the gravel path, and yet there are no more footmarks on
the flower border."</p>

<p>The inspector smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Another problem for you, Mr. Cardyn. But what I am wondering
is, who made those footmarks?"</p>

<p>Bruce looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Well, of course&mdash;" he said.</p>

<p>The inspector went on without noticing any interruption.</p>

<p>"Because I examined all the doors and windows last night an hour
before Soames did, and&mdash;the window was closed and locked
then."</p>

<p>"But what can that mean?" Bruce said slowly.</p>

<p>"Some one has a motive for trying to make us think the murderer
was an outsider, and that he escaped that way," the inspector said
dryly. "But it is possible to be a little too clever, you know, Mr.
Cardyn. Now, I think we will station a man over there&mdash;by the
cedar. He can keep an eye on the footmarks without being seen in
return."</p>

<p>They went back to the same door. Soames was hovering about in
the hall. He looked at them inquiringly.</p>

<p>"As good impressions as we could hope to get," the inspector
said patronizingly. "We shall lay the fellow by the heels very soon
now."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that&mdash;for her poor ladyship's sake." The
man blew his nose noisily and turned away. "You see it is very
upsetting, to them that knew my lady well. And me having been in
the family, boy and man, between thirty and forty years."</p>

<p>"Ay! It will come hard on you old ones&mdash;like losing one of
your own," the inspector said sympathetically. "Between thirty and
forty years, you say?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-eight years it will be next Martinmas. The Squire's
first wife was alive then, and her daughter, pretty Miss
Marjory."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Balmaine, you mean?" the inspector questioned with a
sudden accession of interest. "Was she like her daughter?"</p>

<p>"Not much." Soames blew his nose again. "She was darker than
Miss Margaret Balmaine, and taller, but she was the apple of her
father's eye. He was never the same after she went away. He was
proud of Mr. Christopher and Mr. Frank, but they never came up to
Miss Marjorie with him."</p>

<p>"I wonder he didn't forgive her marriage, then," Cardyn
remarked.</p>

<p>"He would, if she had ever asked him. It was her never troubling
about him again that broke her father's heart. And then she
died."</p>

<p>"Ah, well! We all have to come to it, Mr. Soames." The inspector
gave him a farewell nod. "Now, Mr. Cardyn, we have our work cut out
for to-day."</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn gave himself a mental shake.</p>

<p>For the time being he seemed lost in a sort of dream. His
thoughts were very far away as he followed the inspector to Lady
Anne's sitting-room.</p>

<p>Nothing could have looked less like the scene of a tragedy.
There was nothing to show what had happened. By Inspector
Furnival's orders everything had been left exactly as it was at the
time of the death, except that what remained of Lady Anne herself
had been carried across to her bedroom. The teacups and saucers
they had been using stood where the members of Lady Anne's last
tea-party had hurriedly set them down when the alarm was raised.
The very hot cakes that Soames had dropped when he caught sight of
the face at the window still lay on the floor. Some of them had
been trodden into Lady Anne's beautiful carpet. The silver cover
had rolled or been kicked under the table; the dish itself, with
one cake still on it, was near the escritoire.</p>

<p>The inspector's grey eyes looked round appraisingly.</p>

<p>"Now, once more, show me where you all sat, Mr. Cardyn."</p>

<p>Bruce pointed out Dorothy Fyvert's place at the tea-table, his
own chair in close proximity, John Daventry's and Margaret
Balmaine's near Lady Anne's.</p>

<p>On the flap of the escritoire the little bits of jewellery lay
in their open cases, Lady Anne's teacup beside them. On the floor
beneath was a deep stain, a silent witness to the tragedy.
Inspector Furnival, stepping gingerly among the cakes, went over to
the window farthest from the escritoire, which was wide open as it
had been left the day before.</p>

<p>He stretched himself out and twisted himself round, staring up
and down and both sides.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid your man was not much of a shadower, Mr. Cardyn. In
the summer-house, you say he was stationed? I should have said it
was impossible for anybody, or anything, to get at this window
without being seen."</p>

<p>"So should I," Cardyn acknowledged. "Yet Brooks is one of our
most careful men. He allows, though, that he was watching the
terrace below, more than the actual window itself. He swears that
no one either climbed up from the terrace or came down again."</p>

<p>The inspector took another look.</p>

<p>"He might have put a ladder up possibly without leaving any
trace, but he certainly did not climb up by the creeper, that I
swear. There isn't not a twig broken as far down as can see. I'll
have a look at the roof later on. But now this escritoire. We will
just glance through the contents, and then seal it up. Lady Anne
kept a diary&mdash;I think we will take it away to examine it."
Most of the drawers in the escritoire were unlocked, many of them
stood open, as they had been: left when Lady Anne was searching for
any trace of the missing jewels. But so far as casual glance could
see there was nothing in them that bore upon the present case.
Right at the back of the secret cavity, where the pearls had been
kept, the inspector's keen eyes had noticed some papers, not rolled
up or fastened together in a packet, but looking as though they had
been hastily thrust in at odd moments.</p>

<p>He pulled them out; some of them had superscriptions written
across the envelopes. "From my son Christopher;" "From my boy
Frankie;" two or three older by far&mdash;"From my husband."</p>

<p>The inspector laid all these reverently aside after a cursory
glance. Then he took up the handful of odd ones that remained. Some
of them were quite recent. He opened the first.</p>

<p>"From your loving niece, Dorothy Fyvert," he read. "Now why did
the old lady preserve this, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"She was very fond of Miss Fyvert," Bruce said quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes," the inspector assented dryly. "This is the letter, Mr.
Cardyn. It is dated from Barminster Court: 'Dearest Aunt Anne, I am
in dreadful trouble. There is no one&mdash;no one to whom I can
turn but you. I want five hundred pounds at once. You have often
talked of leaving me money. Will you give it me now instead? If you
will, I will thank you and bless your name for ever. Oh, dear Aunt
Anne, my need is dire as you would realize if I could explain to
you. Help me for mercy's sake.'"</p>

<p>Across the sheet there was scrawled, in the shaky handwriting
that had become very familiar to Bruce Cardyn since his coming to
Charlton Crescent, the one word "Refused."</p>

<p>The inspector handed it to Cardyn with a keen glance at the
young man's averted face.</p>

<p>"Miss Fyvert would not have murdered her aunt for five times
five hundred pounds. Faugh! The very idea is unthinkable.
Besides"&mdash;growing calmer&mdash;"we have no proof that Lady
Anne's death would give Miss Fyvert the five hundred pounds she
wanted."</p>

<p>"I feel sure that Miss Fyvert comes into a considerable amount
of money on her own account," the inspector said gravely. "But at
any rate Miss Fyvert is supposed to be engaged to Mr. John
Daventry, who certainly succeeds to much of Lady Anne's wealth
automatically&mdash;I mean under her late husband's will. Still, I
don't know. I wonder whether she got her five hundred, and how, but
we shall have to hear her explanation."</p>

<p>"I should say there was a much greater motive for John Daventry
to commit the murder than for a girl who might and might not marry
him," Bruce said sarcastically. "There is many a slip between the
cup and the lip, you know."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly there is," the inspector agreed. "Still, I think we
will have a little confidential talk with Miss Dorothy Fyvert." He
was thrusting the rest of the papers back into their hiding-place
as he spoke. "These all date farther back." Bruce Cardyn went over
to the window. He was anxious above all things that the inspector
should not guess the secret he had hitherto guarded so carefully,
and, ostrich-like, fancied the Ferret's keen eyes had not even
suspected. As he stood there looking up and down it was impossible
that the memory of yesterday's tragedy, of the ghastly face at the
window, should not recur to his mind. Was the form that had looked
so shadowy that of a living man or woman, or was it some visitant
from another world? Plain matter-of-fact man as Cardyn had hitherto
considered himself, he could not answer the question. As he leaned
out still farther, a tiny fluttering thread of white caught his
eyes. It was in the ivy, just below the window ledge. He stretched
down his arm and picked it out. Then he laid it on the palm of his
hand and gazed at it curiously. It looked like a thread torn from a
piece of muslin, and he remembered the shadowy veil that had seemed
to float round that white face. He was just about to show it to the
inspector, when he was startled by a sharp exclamation from the
other.</p>

<p>"The diary!"</p>

<p>Cardyn turned quickly.</p>

<p>"Lady Anne Daventry's diary," Inspector Furnival repeated. "It
is gone."</p>

<p>"Gone!" Bruce Cardyn stepped back. "What do you mean? I saw it
on the writing-flap when we came here after the body was
moved&mdash;a square book bound in grey leather with 'Diary'
written in gold across it and a tiny gold lock which was
locked."</p>

<p>"It was here then of course," the inspector said. "I noticed it
particularly, for I was in two minds whether I should begin to read
it last night, but there was so much to be done that I decided to
leave it until after the inquest to-day. Now, dolt, ass that am, I
shall never forgive myself, some one has been before me."</p>

<p>"But who could have taken it?" Cardyn looked as amazed as he
felt. "And how could anyone get into the room at all? You had the
key."</p>

<p>"It has not been out of my possession for a moment," the
inspector said. "But that book held a secret that might have hanged
some one&mdash;and that some one had the means of getting into the
room."</p>

<p>Cardyn's eyes turned to the open window.</p>

<p>"Suppose&mdash;suppose the&mdash;the man came back?" he
hazarded.</p>

<p>"And got into the room and got out again without being seen by
the two men watching&mdash;I think not," the inspector
observed.</p>

<p>Then, while the two men were still staring at one another, there
came an oddly incongruous sound in the stillness&mdash;the sharp
ring of the telephone bell.</p>

<p>There was a moment's hesitation, then the inspector took up the
receiver.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Furnival speaking. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Wilkins, Scotland Yard," came back the answer. "The
pearls&mdash;the long string with the diamond clasp for which we
were to make inquiries&mdash;they were found at the first place we
went to."</p>

<p>"Where was that?"</p>

<p>"Messrs. Spagnum and Thirgood, Bond Street. Sold there last
month by Lady Anne Daventry herself."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>"It is, take it all in all, about the queerest case I was ever
engaged upon."</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival was the speaker. He and Bruce Cardyn were in
a taxi on their way to Messrs. Spagnum and Thirgood's. Furnival was
keeping Cardyn religiously by his side during his
investigations&mdash;a fact that was beginning to puzzle the
younger detective, with whom it was more or less a tradition that
the "Force" distrusted all private or unofficial detectives.</p>

<p>"I expect we shall find that they have made a mistake at Spagnum
and Thirgood's," Bruce rejoined. "Probably the thief said they were
sent by Lady Anne Daventry."</p>

<p>"Likely enough," the detective assented, his small eyes looking
particularly alert as their taxi stopped before a well known
jeweller's establishment in Bond Street.</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival and his companion, on the production of the
former's card, were shown at once to the manager's office. That
functionary received them affably.</p>

<p>"I have been expecting you, gentlemen," he said at once. "Come
about this matter of Lady Anne Daventry's pearls, haven't you? What
a terrible affair this murder of hers is! You might have knocked me
down with a feather when I saw it in this morning's paper. Lady
Anne Daventry was such an old customer of ours. I feel as if it
were a personal loss. Was the crime committed to obtain money,
inspector?"</p>

<p>The inspector graciously admitted that it might have been, and
asked to see the pearls.</p>

<p>The manager produced them from a safe close by.</p>

<p>"I thought you would want to see them first thing. Here they
are. You see there is no mistake about them."</p>

<p>The inspector took the much talked-of pearls in his hand and
examined them. They had all been matched with great care both in
size and colour, and the clasp was unmistakable.</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is the pearls right enough. Now, who brought them to
you?"</p>

<p>"Lady Anne Daventry herself," the manager answered promptly.
"She came about them twice."</p>

<p>"Lady Anne Daventry herself!"</p>

<p>For once the inspector was really amazed.</p>

<p>"Who told you it was Lady Anne Daventry?"</p>

<p>"Who told me it was Lady Anne Daventry?" the manager repeated
explosively. "Why, bless my life, inspector, don't you understand
that I know Lady Anne Daventry personally? I have only been manager
here the last six months. Before then I was head assistant for some
twenty years. I have seen Lady Anne here on many occasions, and
since she grew more invalided I have waited on her at the house in
Charlton Crescent on several occasions with trays of jewellery from
which she would select a wedding or birthday present. It was a
great pleasure to me to know that she was well enough to come here
again."</p>

<p>The inspector regarded him keenly.</p>

<p>"Do you seriously mean to tell me that you really believe it was
Lady Anne Daventry herself who brought the pearls here?"</p>

<p>It was the manager's turn to look amazed now.</p>

<p>"I tell you that I know it was Lady Anne Daventry. Her first
visit was preceded by a note saying that she was coming, so we were
expecting her."</p>

<p>"Was the note written by Lady Anne herself?" questioned the
inspector sharply.</p>

<p>The manager hesitated.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o; I don't think it was. It was written on her paper I
know, for I remember noticing her crest, but it was written, I
presume, by her secretary."</p>

<p>"Have you the letter?"</p>

<p>The manager shook his head.</p>

<p>"I should say it is not in the least likely. If you wish I will
have inquiries made. But it was not regarded as of any importance,
especially after Lady Anne's visit."</p>

<p>"It is most important that it should be found now, though."</p>

<p>The manager shrugged his shoulders as he said a few words down a
speaking tube. It was evident to Bruce Cardyn, watching him, that
he looked upon the inspector as both interfering and officious.</p>

<p>"Now with regard to the price?" the inspector went on. "What did
you give her for them? And in what form? There is no record of such
a transaction in her bank book."</p>

<p>"No," the manager paused. "Of course in an ordinary case all
details would be confidential. But I have no choice here."</p>

<p>"None!" the inspector interposed firmly.</p>

<p>"We offered two thousand for it," the manager said reluctantly,
"and she accepted at once. As to the form, she explained that she
did not wish anyone to know that she had parted with her pearls. We
gathered that she wanted the money for some member of her family
who had got into trouble, therefore she did not want to have a
cheque as it would be easily traced. She asked us to give her the
amount in notes. We gave her that day ten notes of a hundred each
and arranged to pay the other instalment at a later date. We
should, of course, have sent it to her, but she explained that she
would come for it in person, as practically all her correspondence
passed through her secretary's hands."</p>

<p>"Then this second thousand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is still waiting for her. Some three days ago we received a
note from her saying that she would come to our establishment to
complete her business with us on Thursday, the 5th of February,
which, of course, is next week. We replied that everything would be
ready for her. The next thing we saw was in the paper telling of
her cruel murder. You can hardly imagine what a shock it gave
us."</p>

<p>"It must have done," the inspector agreed, a certain amount of
sympathy in his tone. "And now, I am afraid you must prepare for
another shock. Lady Anne Daventry did not sell her pearls to you.
She had not found out that they were missing until the afternoon of
her death when she wanted to show them to some friends. She herself
summoned Scotland Yard to her assistance and I was on the point of
starting for Charlton Crescent to interview her on the subject when
the news of her brutal murder arrived."</p>

<p>"What!" The manager was staring at the inspector as though he
doubted the evidence of his own ears. "But I tell you it was Lady
Anne who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have been deceived by a clever impostor," the
inspector said gravely. "The person who sold you the pearls was not
Lady Anne Daventry herself, but some one impersonating her."</p>

<p>"But it is impossible," stuttered the manager. "I tell I you
knew Lady Anne not only by sight, but had often spoken to her. I am
certain it was Lady Anne who brought the pearls."</p>

<p>"Well, if you are right, the mystery only deepens," the
inspector said diplomatically. "Will you please tell us all about
the interview. Every detail of it, so far as you remember."</p>

<p>The manager waited a moment.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;there is so little to say," he began at last. "Lady
Anne arrived punctually at the time she had fixed on the Friday of
last week. I went out to receive her and with her man on the other
side helped her from the carriage. From there she walked in here
with my arm and the stick on the other side. Her man carried the
case containing the pearls. I may say that Lady Anne explained that
she would have brought her maid with her, but that she did not wish
the woman, who I understood had been with her for many years, to
know that she had parted with her pearls. The interview was very
quickly over. We had valued Lady Anne's pearls for her some years
before, so that she knew what to expect and we were quite satisfied
to give the price she asked. I helped her back to her carriage, and
she drove off promising, as I say, to call to complete the
transaction next week, on the 5th of February."</p>

<p>"I wonder why she did not arrange to come sooner," the inspector
said, speaking as if half to himself, while his small grey eyes
watched every change in the other's face from beneath their lowered
lids.</p>

<p>The manager spread out his hands.</p>

<p>"Who can account for the vagaries of these great ladies? Lady
Anne did, however, say something about having something else to
bring us to-day."</p>

<p>"And you really noticed nothing unaccustomed or strange in her
voice or manner?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" the manager said decidedly.</p>

<p>"She talked in her usual brisk and rather snappy
manner&mdash;for there is no denying she was a snappy old lady, you
know, inspector! And she wore the same sort of clothes she always
did&mdash;a rather full mantle, some magnificent furs and a regular
Victorian bonnet. No, I noticed nothing particular about her
except&mdash;But, no, there couldn't be anything in that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will let us have it?" suggested the inspector. "We
can't afford to neglect any clue, however slight."</p>

<p>"Well, it was nothing of course," the manager went on. "But I
noticed that she signed the receipt without removing her gloves. I
remarked it because I remembered the big diamond she generally wore
and glanced to see if it was still there. I thought it a little
strange perhaps that she did not take off her glove, but of course
one can understand that crippled with rheumatism as she was it may
have been very painful to pull her gloves off and on."</p>

<p>"H'm!" the inspector scratched the side of his nose
reflectively, with the handle of his fountain pen. "May I see the
receipt?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" The manager unlocked his desk. "Here it is. Only
the signature is in Lady Anne's writing of course."</p>

<p>"Of course," assented the inspector. "Mr. Cardyn, what do you
make of this? Is it Lady Anne's writing? This gentleman was Lady's
Anne's private secretary," he added as Bruce bent over the
paper.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was almost identical with the crabbed and shaking
handwriting that had become very familiar to Bruce Cardyn of late.
Almost&mdash;and yet, was it quite? Bruce could not answer the
question to his own satisfaction. At last he looked up.</p>

<p>"If it is not Lady Anne Daventry's signature it is a remarkably
clever imitation. But&mdash;I am not sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inspector handed the receipt back to the manager.</p>

<p>"Take care of it, sir. We may want it later. And&mdash;one more
question, and then I will not detain you longer. Did Lady Anne come
in her own carriage?"</p>

<p>"I really couldn't be certain," the manager said, beginning to
look uneasy. "It was a private car and there were two men on the
box, so I took it for granted it was her own, but I can't say any
more."</p>

<p>"Well, I am very grateful to you for allowing us to take up so
much of your valuable time," the inspector said, getting up. "And
they say gratitude is a sense of favours to come&mdash;I am afraid
we shall take up more of it yet. Good morning."</p>

<p>When they were out of sight of Messrs. Spagnum and Thirgood's,
and their taxi was bowling as swiftly as the traffic would allow
towards Bayswater Road, Bruce Cardyn looked at the inspector.</p>

<p>"Did it strike you that manager fellow looked a trifle pale at
the end?"</p>

<p>"Afraid of losing his job if he let himself be taken in by an
impostor, however clever, I expect," the inspector explained
blandly. "But"&mdash;throwing himself round and almost facing the
young man&mdash;"this is a queer case, as queer a case as ever I
came across. As a rule one is bothered to find a clue&mdash;here
the clues seem to tumble out under one's nose all the time. The
difficulty is they all lead in different directions, and I'm
blessed if I can make out the right one as yet. Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped and looked out at the traffic without speaking.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;?" Bruce Cardyn repeated curiously.</p>

<p>The inspector gave an odd little laugh.</p>

<p>"I am wondering whether Lady Anne Daventry did not sell her
jewels herself and simply wanted us to imagine that they were
stolen. Such a case is not without a parallel in the annals of the
British aristocracy."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure there was nothing of that kind about the loss
of Lady Anne's jewels," Bruce Cardyn said firmly. "Besides, surely
her murder shows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you imagine Lady Anne was murdered by the person who stole
the pearls?" The inspector questioned, fixing the young man with
his gimletlike gaze. "And why?"</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn felt as if the solid ground was melting away
beneath his feet.</p>

<p>"So that the identity of the thief should not be discovered," he
said slowly.</p>

<p>"So that is your theory," said the inspector with another of
those queer little laughs. "But does it not strike you as odd, Mr.
Cardyn, that, if the pearl thief were also the murderer, Lady Anne
should have been killed just a week before the day fixed for the
payment of the second half of the purchase money, and what about
the secret poisoning? Ah, ah, Mr. Cardyn, is it possible that you
private inquiry gentlemen still have something to learn from the
real article?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>It was a week to the day since the murder of Lady Anne
Daventry.</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival was sitting in the library on the first
floor, ostensibly looking over the notes in his pocket-book, with
an occasional glance at the pile of the daily papers that lay on
the table beside him, in reality keeping a keen watch on the door
leading into the hall which he had left open.</p>

<p>Lady Anne's funeral had taken place the previous day. Her will
had directed that she should be buried in the nearest place of
interment to the place in which she died, "having," as that
document stated, "an objection to having my body carted about the
country." So that instead of a stately funeral at Daventry there
had been a very simple affair in a big London cemetery. The time of
the service had been kept secret or there would have been the usual
crowd of sightseers. But there was scarcely anyone about when Lady
Anne's coffin with its plain black handles, as directed in her
will, was borne over the short grass to its last resting-place.
John Daventry and the rector of North Coton had been the chief
mourners and then there had been other Fyverts and
Daventrys&mdash;conspicuous among them the present Lord
Fyvert&mdash;the dead lady's nephew. Bruce Cardyn walked with the
inspector and behind them came the servants, Soames and Pirnie at
the head of them. The service had been as brief as possible, and
most of the mourners had dispersed without returning to Charlton
Crescent.</p>

<p>The adjourned inquest was to be opened to-day at eleven o'clock.
It was now nine, and the inspector who was an indefatigably early
riser had been up for hours, and having breakfasted was now at
liberty to read the papers, and to carry out a private plot of his
own before going on to the inquiry.</p>

<p>Lady Anne Daventry's murder had captured the public imagination
in no ordinary degree. The rank and age of the victim, the mystery
surrounding the crime and the fact that the newspapers just now had
nothing particular on hand had combined to make the Charlton
Crescent Mystery, as it was called, the principal topic of
interest.</p>

<p>The inspector ran through the papers quickly. As he had
expected, such headings as "Charlton Crescent Murder." "Reported
Clue." "Who was the man at the window?" were conspicuous on the
first page. But surprises for Inspector Furnival were hardly likely
to come in the daily press. He soon turned back to his notes, and
was knitting his brows together over some knotty problem when
Soames came into the room. The man was looking white and
shaken.</p>

<p>"I have been told, Mr. Furnival, that I shall be one of the
first witnesses called to-day, because I was the first to see the
man at the window."</p>

<p>"Quite likely!" the inspector assented. "But it will only be a
matter of form, you know, Mr. Soames. You will not find it at all
alarming. Just say what you saw. That is all."</p>

<p>"Thank you. But I have never come in contact with anything of
the kind before, and I can't say I like the prospect of speaking
right out in court."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it will soon be over," the inspector said genially.
"You look cold. Stir the fire. I didn't notice how hollow it was
burning. But, there, I forgot. Don't you high-class flunkeys get a
footman to poke the fire for you?"</p>

<p>Soames gave a sickly smile as he paused, poker in hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, we are not all quite so bad as they make us out. My poor
lady would have told you that I always liked to do everything in
her room myself."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, I am glad that her ladyship recognized your long
years of devoted service," the inspector went on.</p>

<p>Soames stirred the hot coals into a brisk flame.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Furnival, her ladyship has left all us head servants,
if we were with her at the time of her death, five hundred pounds
each. That is, me and Miss Pirnie, and the chauffeur that used to
be the coachman, and the head gardener&mdash;we all came with her
from the Keep. The other ones have smaller sums according to their
time of service."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. No one was better acquainted with the
terms of the will than he.</p>

<p>"You were here when&mdash;" he was beginning when his quick ear
caught the sound of a "click" in the hall. He got up leisurely.</p>

<p>"Somebody at the telephone&mdash;I will just explain&mdash;"</p>

<p>Soames would have stepped forward to open the door already
standing ajar, but the inspector waved him aside and went into the
hall.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Fyvert," he said suavely. "I see you did not know the
extensions had been cut off. The only phone left now is this one in
the library."</p>

<p>Dorothy Fyvert stared at him, receiver in hand.</p>

<p>"Who has done this? How stupid and inconvenient!" with an
evident effort to speak naturally.</p>

<p>"Well, I am afraid I must plead guilty to having given the
order. Detectives have to do all sorts of odd things, you know,
Miss Fyvert. But I am very sorry if it has inconvenienced you," the
inspector went on politely. "Will you not come in to the
library?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want to send a message to the dressmaker," Dorothy
hesitated. "It was rather important, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall I see if the line is clear for you?" the inspector
inquired blandly as he held open the library door.</p>

<p>Miss Fyvert hesitated. She was not looking well to-day, as the
inspector had noticed at once. Her face was very white; all her
pretty colour had faded; her eyes had deep blue half-circles under
them, and the eyes themselves glanced about nervously. She bit her
lip now.</p>

<p>"No, thank you! After all I do not know that I will ring up
Madame Benoit. I do not know that there is any real need."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I have always been told that a lady's appointment with
her dressmaker was most important," the inspector said. "Madame
Benoit, you said." He paused with the receiver in his hand. "The
address, please."</p>

<p>Miss Fyvert paused a minute, but the inspector's gimlet-like
eyes were filed upon her.</p>

<p>"17 Clonnell Street, off Wigmore Street," she said with a little
laugh. "Really, inspector, you are a very determined man. I don't
wonder the criminal classes are afraid of you."</p>

<p>"I hope they are," the inspector said grimly. "Here. Why, we
have been lucky enough to get on at once. Now, Miss Fyvert."</p>

<p>He handed her the receiver and waited while she gave her few
directions about a dress that did not fit, and made an appointment
for some alterations. Then she put down the receiver with a hand
that visibly trembled.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Inspector Furnival. If I had known your
telephone arrangements I would not have disturbed you."</p>

<p>The inspector smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"It has been no trouble, Miss Fyvert. I am glad I happened to be
here," he said truthfully. "I have been looking for an opportunity
of having a few words with you. Perhaps you could spare me a few
minutes now?"</p>

<p>The girl's white face turned scarlet, slowly, painfully.</p>

<p>"I do not think can stay this morning," she faltered. "I have to
go to this terrible inquest and then my little sister is not well.
I am very anxious about her. I cannot think what is the matter with
her."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear that." The inspector placed a chair for her
and something about his gaze compelled her to take it. "But
children are often up and down. I have six at home so ought to
know. As for the inquest, I am anxious to have a few words with you
before that."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the inquest?" Dorothy faltered. "But that is this
morning. I really do not see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, there will be plenty of time before the inquest," the
inspector said easily. He had placed her chair so that she faced
the window, and now he stood opposite so that he, though in the
shadow himself, got the light full upon her. "There is sure to be a
crowd there&mdash;at the inquest, I mean&mdash;and it would not be
wondered at if a young lady like yourself lost her head a little.
So I thought if you and I had a talk first it might make things
easier for you."</p>

<p>"But I can't tell them anything!" the girl exclaimed wildly,
clasping her hands closely together. "I was in the room when Aunt
Anne was&mdash;when she died, but I did not see anything. I could
not tell them anything."</p>

<p>The inspector coughed.</p>

<p>"In a case like this, we have to look at the matter all round.
And first and foremost there is the question of motive. There were
five people in the room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Five people!" Dorothy interrupted him. "Six, you mean, for you
surely cannot omit the man at the window?"</p>

<p>The inspector accepted the correction.</p>

<p>"Six, then. Of course you saw this sixth&mdash;the man at the
window&mdash;yourself, Miss Fyvert?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say exactly," Dorothy said honestly. "I was at
the tea-table, and was so amazed to see Soames drop the cakes that
I was looking at him, and only had the most casual glance at
something moving at the window. Also, of course, everybody made a
rush for the window, so that they got between."</p>

<p>"And you saw and heard nothing else?" the inspector said
sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, I have told myself since that it must have been a
mistake," Dorothy said doubtfully. "But I did fancy at the time
that I heard a soft eerie laugh."</p>

<p>"Ah! You did?" the inspector's eyes grew keen. "Now where did it
seem to come from, up or down, or one side?"</p>

<p>"Really, I couldn't tell," Dorothy said, a strange look
compounded of fear and some subtler emotion coming over her face.
"It just seemed to be in the air. I can't tell you any more, Mr.
Furnival."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;um&mdash;well!" The inspector dismissed the subject.
"Well, you went with the others to the window, I presume!" he
proceeded.</p>

<p>"I went with them," she acquiesced. "I think I was the last to
reach the window. I remember Soames standing aside for me. And then
it was all confusion till we heard that horrible groan and cry and
I found out that poor Aunt Anne had been stabbed."</p>

<p>"The last to reach the window," mused the inspector. "H'm! Now,
Miss Fyvert, can you tell me of any one of the others who was near
you all the time right up to the moment when you heard that
groan?"</p>

<p>Dorothy drew her delicate brows together, her blue eyes looked
puzzled and worried. "I don't know. I don't think so," she said
slowly at last. "It seems to me that Mr. John Daventry was close to
me a good deal of the time, but I could not swear to the exact
moment when we heard the groan."</p>

<p>"I see. I wish you could," the inspector said. "Now with regard
to this question of motive, it is a curious thing that every person
in the room would be better off at Lady Anne's death. To you she
bequeathed her pearls and her jewels."</p>

<p>"Some of her other jewels," Dorothy corrected. "Both my little
sister and Miss Balmaine have legacies; Mr. Daventry also. But, Mr.
Furnival"&mdash;her blue eyes growing wide with horror, her voice
vibrating with indignation&mdash;"you cannot mean to suggest that I
killed Aunt Anne in order to obtain her legacy. I did not even know
that she had left the pearls to me. You cannot think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not think&mdash;I do not suggest&mdash;anything," the
inspector interrupted gravely. "It is my duty to deal with facts as
they are. Now, Miss Fyvert, I happen to know that a very short time
ago you were in urgent need of a large sum of money. You wrote to
Lady Anne and asked her to help you; and she refused&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How in the world do you know that?" Dorothy gasped, every
vestige of colour fading from her cheeks, even her lips turning
blue, the pupils of her eyes distending until the eyes themselves
looked black.</p>

<p>For answer the inspector held her letter to Lady Anne out to
her.</p>

<p>"Your handwriting, I think?"</p>

<p>The girl bent her head. She was biting her underlip, her fingers
were turning and intertwining themselves together.</p>

<p>"Miss Fyvert," the inspector went on, a kindlier note creeping
into his voice as he noticed the girl's agitation, "there is a
saying that a man should have no secrets from his doctor or his
lawyer. Believe me, in a case of this kind it is best to have no
secrets from the police. Now will you tell me whether you obtained
that money and how?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't," faltered the girl. "I do not
think"&mdash;rallying all her courage&mdash;"that you have any
right to ask me. You see that Aunt Anne refused me. The rest cannot
concern you."</p>

<p>"Everything concerns me that may bear upon the doings of any of
you in the room that evening. Won't you be frank with me, Miss
Fyvert? A few words to me now may save you much unpleasantness
later on. In a court of law you can be compelled to answer."</p>

<p>"Nobody can compel me," the girl said, raising her head proudly.
"Besides, are not people who are accused warned not to speak
because what they say may be used in evidence against them."</p>

<p>"But you are not accused!" the inspector said quietly. "No one
is accused yet. I said that any one of you four&mdash;Mr. Daventry,
Miss Balmaine, yourself and Soames, the butler&mdash;might be
accused, because you were known to be in the room."</p>

<p>"No!" Dorothy contradicted in a defiant tone. "Once more you
have forgotten the man at the window&mdash;the Cat Burglar as they
call him in the papers&mdash;and&mdash;and Mr. Cardyn."</p>

<p>The softening in her tone did not escape the inspector's quick
hearing.</p>

<p>"Ah! the Cat Burglar!" he repeated, an odd little inflection in
his voice. "Well, I do not see how the Cat Burglar outside can have
much to do with the murder of Lady Anne Daventry from the inside.
As for Mr. Cardyn, I think we must put him out of court,
because&mdash;I am speaking to you confidentially now, Miss
Fyvert&mdash;he is a private detective engaged by Lady Anne
herself, to prevent this very thing that happened&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! Mr. Cardyn a detective! I do not believe it!" Dorothy
caught her breath sharply. "I am certain he is not&mdash;could not
be anything of the kind."</p>

<p>The inspector raised his eyebrows. "I assure you he is. But now,
Miss Fyvert, I tell you what I am going to do. I'm going to leave
you here alone for a few minutes just to think things over before
we start for the inquest. I think, on reflection, you will see that
it is best to tell me everything."</p>

<p>"I shall not, I will not," Dorothy contradicted hotly.</p>

<p>The inspector paid no heed. He left the room with his usual
catlike tread and Dorothy was alone.</p>

<p>Her first proceeding was to jump up and take a few steps up and
down the room, her breath coming in quick strong gasps, her small
brown hands gripping one another.</p>

<p>"I do not believe it&mdash;I know it is not true," she said
passionately to herself.</p>

<p>Then she threw herself back in her chair, her breast panting,
her foot tapping the floor.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" she cried to herself. "Heaven help me, I do
not know what to do now."</p>

<p>At this moment Bruce Cardyn opened the door and looked in.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, inspector? Miss Fyvert"&mdash;his tone
changing to one of consternation&mdash;"you are in trouble. Can I
help you?"</p>

<p>Wrath dried Dorothy's tears. She dropped the handkerchief.</p>

<p>"You! No! You would only make things worse for me. I have been
told&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What have you been told?" Bruce stood before her, his arms
folded. Instinct told him what was coming.</p>

<p>"You know!" the girl said scornfully. "I have been
told&mdash;the&mdash;the inspector has told me&mdash;you are here
to watch, to pry&mdash;Oh, it is loathsome&mdash;loathsome! I
wonder that a man can stoop so low!"</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn took rapid counsel with himself. The inspector must
have had some motive for giving away the secret he had hitherto
guarded so successfully.</p>

<p>"You have heard that I am a detective," he said quietly. "Does
that seem so terrible a thing to you?"</p>

<p>Dorothy struck her hands together passionately.</p>

<p>"It seems horrible, detestable! To spend your time trying to
find out other people's secrets&mdash;to be a spy, an informer!
Would it be possible for a man to sink lower? And that it should be
you&mdash;you who have done this vile thing!"</p>

<p>The hot blood flew to Cardyn's brow. For a moment he struggled
to find words to answer. At last he said, controlling his
voice:</p>

<p>"Does it seem so dreadful a thing to you to put oneself on the
side of the law? The innocent&mdash;the innocent have nothing to
fear from a detective, Miss Fyvert."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they have!" Dorothy said wrathfully. "You may be quite
innocent, but they will go prying and poking about trying to find
out things that are no concern of theirs all the same. And
you&mdash;you who saved me from that terrible fire&mdash;whom I
have looked upon as a friend&mdash;" Tears choked her
utterance.</p>

<p>The anger her words had caused in Bruce Cardyn's heart died
down, to be succeeded by pity and a stronger, simpler emotion, that
even to himself he had hardly dared yet to acknowledge.</p>

<p>"It has been a great joy&mdash;a supreme honour for me that you
have allowed me to count myself among your friends," he said
quietly. "For the sake of that friendship, will you listen to me
for one minute? Your aunt, Lady Anne, sent for me; she told me that
she was frightened, that some member of her household was trying to
murder her&mdash;she did not know who&mdash;and she asked me to
come here as her secretary and find out which one it could be. It
seemed to be then&mdash;it seems to me now&mdash;a very pitiful
case. Here was a woman, old, alone, fearing the death that was
lurking near all the time, not knowing from what corner it might
come. I promised to do my best for her. Heaven knows I meant to
make her safe!"</p>

<p>"But you didn't," Dorothy said scornfully. "You didn't pry about
in the right direction, you see, Mr. Cardyn."</p>

<p>"I did not," Bruce Cardyn acknowledged, a faraway look in his
grey eyes. "I shall never forgive myself for having failed her, and
yet I do not see what I could have done&mdash;that I did not do.
Now&mdash;now I have sworn to avenge her murder. When I have
fulfilled my vow, I shall come to you and say, I am a detective no
longer. Will you give me a word of hope, Miss Fyvert, will you be
my friend again?" He made a slight gesture as though to put out his
hand.</p>

<p>But Dorothy would not take it. She put both hers firmly behind
her.</p>

<p>"I shall say, however much you give it up, the remembrance of
what you have done and been in the past will cling to you still,"
she said cuttingly. "Friends with a detective&mdash;a spy! No,
thank you, Mr. Cardyn!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>The hall at the back of Charlton Crescent where the inquest on
Lady Anne Daventry was resumed was crammed to its utmost limit when
the inquiry was reopened. Crowds waited outside, unable to get in,
but hoping for a glance at those who were to give evidence to-day.
The curiosity of the sightseers was not to be gratified this
morning, however. A private car with the rector of North Coton, his
wife and the two girls came first. They were followed quickly by
another car containing Bruce Cardyn, John Daventry, Inspector
Furnival and Soames.</p>

<p>They were both driven through the crowd to a back entrance, and
while the sightseers were still watching for "the Five" they were
safely inside the court-house.</p>

<p>The inquest was held in a big room, while there sat at the table
near the coroner the counsels who held watching briefs for the five
and for the Fyvert and Daventry families, and, much to the surprise
of the general public who did not see the connexion, for Messrs.
Spagnum and Thirgood. Close behind them again were the solicitors
who instructed them, and the seats allotted to the witnesses. Every
other seat, every other inch of standing room was quickly filled
when the coroner took his place and the doors were opened.</p>

<p>Francis Herbert Soames was the first witness called and there
was a sharp stir of expectation through the court.</p>

<p>Soames looked as urbane and dignified as ever as he made his way
through the crowd, but it was evident to a keen observer that the
tragic events of the past fortnight had left their mark upon him.
His shoulders were more bowed, his face was paler, even his lips
were white as he kissed the book.</p>

<p>After the preliminaries were over the coroner bade him tell the
story of the afternoon of Lady Anne's death to the jury, as clearly
and as concisely as possible.</p>

<p>He stated his length of service in the Daventry family and gave
his age as fifty-six, to the surprise of the sightseers, who
thought he looked more. Then he passed on to what he saw on the
afternoon of the 29th.</p>

<p>"It was getting dark," he began, "and I took up another relay of
hot cakes to my lady's sitting-room, knowing how fond the young
ladies were of them. I had got in the room and was surprised to
find how dark it was, it not being my lady's custom to sit in the
gloaming. One of the young ladies began to joke about the cakes,"
he went on, a huskiness coming in his voice for the first time. "I
was just opposite the window, and as I answered Miss Dorothy
something seemed to move across the glass. I looked more closely
and saw a white face&mdash;a noticeably white face, staring in at
us. I was so startled, sir," looking apologetically at the coroner,
"that I am ashamed to say I dropped the plate of cakes in my hand
and called out. I often say to myself that if I hadn't done so my
poor lady might have been alive now. For there was such an outcry
when Mr. Daventry and the young ladies saw the face at the window
that the murderer was able to come in and work his wicked will on
my lady. The next thing I heard, while we were all looking out, was
that dreadful gasping cry, and when we turned round, there was my
lady choking her life-blood away, with that dagger sticking out of
her breast."</p>

<p>He stopped. The coroner looked at his notes.</p>

<p>"You say, 'the murderer was able to come in.' Why do you say he
came in? Did you see him? Did you hear any movement?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, no." The witness paused as if to suppress some
emotion. "But it stands to reason that some one did come in. It is
impossible to suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are not asked to suppose, witness," the coroner interposed.
"Did you or did you not hear or see anything to show you that
another person had entered the room."</p>

<p>"No, I did not, sir," the witness replied unwillingly.</p>

<p>"Now with regard to this man at the window," the coroner went
on, after another glance at his notes, "will you tell us exactly
about the state of these windows&mdash;this one and the other? Were
they open or closed?"</p>

<p>"This one was open a few inches from the top, sir. The one
nearest her ladyship&mdash;not the one the man came to&mdash;was a
little open. The other was latched. They were just as my lady
always gave orders they should be, sir."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of that," said the coroner. "Now can you
conceive it possible that a man could have got through either of
them into the room?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, sir. I couldn't. But then I am not a Cat
Burglar."</p>

<p>In spite of the gravity of the case a ripple of laughter ran
through the crowd at the idea of the portly and superior butler
posing as a cat burglar. When it had been suppressed by the usher,
the coroner said:</p>

<p>"One more question, please, Mr. Soames. You speak of the last
gasping cry her ladyship gave. Did it sound to you as if your lady
were trying to call out, to say some words?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir, I can't say that it did!" the witness said
doubtfully. "But then you see there was such a commotion and I was
that upset by seeing the face at the window that I didn't realize
what was happening, or how important it was that I should be able
to remember all that passed."</p>

<p>"I see." The coroner wrote a few lines on his paper. "You can
go, now, witness, but you must hold yourself in readiness, for you
may be wanted later."</p>

<p>Soames's place in the witness-box was taken by John Daventry,
who looked the model of a healthy young Englishman as he stood up
to face the crowded court, though his usually good-tempered
expression had been replaced by an air of morose defiance. He took
the oath and kissed the book and answered the first few formal
questions in a surly fashion that turned the sympathies of most men
against him. Asked to give his account of the events of that tragic
afternoon he responded curtly that it would be just the same as the
last witness's, except that he did not see the face at the window
till after Soames cried out.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, put it in your own words, please," the coroner
said with an air of calm authority that even John Daventry dared
not disregard.</p>

<p>"Well, my aunt had been telling us all about her pearls and
showing us her other bits of jewellery and&mdash;and&mdash;the
dagger. And we had been turning them all over and then it was
getting dusk and we had tea up. We had so much to talk about that
we didn't ring for lights. At last Soames brought us some more hot
cakes and dropped them and yelled like mad, and stood pointing at
the window. Then I saw some joker looking in&mdash;a fellow with an
ugly white face. We all ran to the window, but the chap seemed to
have got away somehow. And while we were all looking for him there
was that cry from Lady Anne and we turned to find her dead or dying
with that dagger sticking in her." During this bald recital
Daventry's ruddy cheeks had faded almost to the sickly green colour
of the evening of the murder. After that first glance at the
lookers-on in the well of the court, however, he did not turn that
way again, but faced the coroner with shoulders thrown back and
squared, and defiant eyes. He seemed in some way to sense the
hostile feeling of the waiting crowd.</p>

<p>The coroner held out a plan of the sitting-room to him.</p>

<p>"Will you mark the chair in which you sat, if you please, Mr.
Daventry?"</p>

<p>The witness took the plan, scowled at it and finally scored one
of the seats with a big black cross.</p>

<p>The coroner scrutinized it. "You were the nearest to the
escritoire, to Lady Anne, I see."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was, on that side," John Daventry said gloomily.
"But&mdash;" a sudden passion springing into his tone&mdash;"that
doesn't say that I jumped up and stuck a dagger into the poor old
lady. Oh, I know what you are driving at, Mr. Coroner! I can see as
far through a stone wall as anyone."</p>

<p>"That is a most improper observation to make, Mr. Daventry," the
coroner said severely. "Please to confine yourself to the matter in
hand. You speak of Lady Anne's last cry&mdash;did it sound to you
as if she were trying to say something, or only like a cry for
help?"</p>

<p>"Well, a bit of both!" John Daventry said sullenly, still
smarting under his rebuke. "It was like a gasping choke&mdash;and
then she tried to say: 'It was&mdash;it was&mdash;' twice like
that, and then she was gone."</p>

<p>"Had you any knowledge of the fact that Lady Anne had some
reason to fear that an attempt was likely to be made on her
life&mdash;had been made unsuccessfully several times in fact?"</p>

<p>John Daventry opened his eyes. "No, I hadn't. And I don't
believe it now. The old lady would have been sure to have told me,
and I should have taken care to safeguard her."</p>

<p>The coroner coughed. "Not quite so easy as it sounds, perhaps,
Mr. Daventry. Now, did this face at the window bear any resemblance
to that of anyone you know?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no! I should think not!" John Daventry burst out
energetically. "A chap with a face like chalk, like a clown's or a
mask or something of that sort and a mass of black hair."</p>

<p>There was a pause. The coroner was consulting his notes. At last
John Daventry moved as if to leave the box. The coroner stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Another question, Mr. Daventry. Is it not a fact that every one
in the room benefited by Lady Anne's death?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Daventry assented sulkily. "Every one that is to
say but the secretary&mdash;Cardyn. She didn't leave him anything.
He hadn't been there long enough."</p>

<p>"You and Miss Balmaine, I understand, come into a large sum of
money between you?"</p>

<p>Daventry nodded. "Yes. Under my uncle's will. He left his large
private fortune to his wife for her life, and then to his sons who
were killed in the war. Then it was to be divided between me and
the heirs of his daughter if any of them were ever discovered. Lady
Anne's money went back to her own family, naturally."</p>

<p>It was a long speech for John Daventry, usually one of the most
inarticulate of men. At its conclusion he wiped the little beads of
perspiration from his brow.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Daventry, I understand that you have on several
occasions tried to anticipate this reversion," the coroner said,
watching him closely.</p>

<p>Daventry stared back at him. "How do you know that? I am not
here to answer questions about my private affairs."</p>

<p>"You are here to answer any questions that may throw any light
on the death of Lady Anne Daventry," the coroner rejoined severely.
"This sort of thing will do you no good, Mr. Daventry. Answer the
question, please."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I have," John Daventry said sullenly. "Expenses
have gone up and&mdash;and the estate doesn't bring in any more.
Every fellow flies a few kites nowadays."</p>

<p>"And did this particular kite of yours succeed?" the coroner
asked blandly. "Were you able to borrow the money you wanted?"</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't. The blighter wouldn't advance me anything."</p>

<p>The beads of perspiration were plainly visible on Daventry's
brow now. Every now and then he dashed his handkerchief across
them. "You see, if I died before Lady Anne, they would not have got
a penny, it would have gone to Miss Balmaine or failing her to my
cousin, Alan Daventry. And Lady Anne was a game old
lady&mdash;might have lived to be a hundred if it had not been for
this scandalous affair. One of the fellows had the cheek to tell me
her life was better than mine."</p>

<p>"Quite so!" the coroner said politely. "I think that is all, Mr.
Daventry."</p>

<p>John Daventry opened his mouth as if to make some rejoinder,
then changed his mind, and, with an awkward bow to the coroner,
stepped down from the box and made his way back to his seat next
Margaret Balmaine. People looked askance at him as he passed. One
or two drew themselves out of his way. There could be no doubt that
upon the general public John Daventry had made a most unfavourable
impression. He was, as Inspector Furnival had once remarked, the
obvious suspect, but the obvious was not always the right.</p>

<p>The inspector's face was inscrutable as ever as he stood up and
asked that the inquest might be further adjourned for a fortnight,
as the police were making certain inquiries which he hoped by that
time might have some definite result.</p>

<p>The coroner shuffled about his papers and consulted the foreman
of the jury for a moment. Then, just as he turned to the inspector,
one of the jurymen rose.</p>

<p>"Might I put a question to Inspector Furnival on behalf of
myself and my colleagues, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," the coroner said at once. "There can be no
objection, can there, inspector?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly not, sir." But though the inspector's face was as
imperturbable as ever as he turned to face the jury, in his heart
he was cursing his interlocutor. None knew better than he how very
awkward and inapt these questions of the jurymen often were, of how
frequently a criminal had taken fright just at the most critical
moment.</p>

<p>"What we want to know is this, sir," the inquisitive juryman
persisted. "We have heard a good deal about finger-prints, all of
us, one way and another, and we should like to know why Inspector
Furnival has not had the handle of the dagger examined for
finger-prints, if he has not. And, if he has, why he has not
communicated the results of the examination to us."</p>

<p>The suspicion of a smile flitted across the inspector's face.
Nothing that was done in all the wonderful artistic and scientific
methods of detecting crime employed by the Criminal Investigation
Department had so captured the public imagination as this one of
finger-prints, he was well aware. Also no one was aware how
fallacious such a test might be.</p>

<p>"The usual steps to secure the finger-prints on the dagger
handle were taken at once naturally."</p>

<p>"And the result?" the juror questioned breathlessly.</p>

<p>"We found the finger-prints more or less distinct of all the
people in the room, and of Lady Anne Daventry herself."</p>

<p>"No one else? No sixth man?" Another juror burst out.</p>

<p>"Not at this examination. The handle is at present being put
under other tests by Sir William Forrester Sanders, the expert. But
I may say at once that I do not anticipate any different
result."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;the murder must have been committed by one of the
five people in the room?"</p>

<p>A shiver of horror passed through his hearers. The witnesses
sitting near together in the front of the court drew a little apart
and glanced at one another sideways as they waited for the
answer.</p>

<p>The inspector bent his head. "So it would seem."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The coroner passed out. The crowd waited, their eyes fixed upon
that little group of people in the front. They wanted to see them
get up&mdash;these five very ordinary-looking men and women, one of
whom must be a murderer. Moreover, a murderer of the most cruel and
brutal kind, one who had killed a defenceless old woman bound to
every one of them by ties of gratitude and duty.</p>

<p>But the ushers began to clear the court. The curious would not
be allowed to stare any longer. As they were turning unwillingly to
the door, the Five got up. The rector of North Coton with his wife
preceded them to the door the courtesy of the coroner had allowed
them to use, the two girls came next looking white and frightened
in their new mourning. John Daventry and Bruce Cardyn followed,
most unwilling companions in adversity. Inspector Furnival brought
up the rear, chatting amiably with Soames.</p>

<p>"So it wasn't so very formidable after all, was it?"</p>

<p>"No. Not&mdash;not really, of course. They didn't ask me
anything about the footsteps under the window at the back of the
Hall. I mean those I showed you myself. That puzzled me a bit."</p>

<p>The inspector looked at him with something as like a wink as so
dignified a functionary ever permitted himself.</p>

<p>"It doesn't do to tell them everything we know. I may tell you I
am following up that clue myself."</p>

<p>Some of the tension died out of the butler's face.</p>

<p>"Then may I take it you don't feel sure that it was one of the
five in the room that was guilty?"</p>

<p>The inspector gave him a knowing glance.</p>

<p>"I never feel sure of anything in this world. I may tell you in
confidence that when I have made those footmarks out I shall have
found out who murdered Lady Anne."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I am glad to hear you say that," the man said almost
gratefully. "It seemed so dreadful that one of us, one of us who
loved her"&mdash;he gulped down something in his
throat&mdash;"should have killed my lady."</p>

<p>When they reached Charlton Crescent again Bruce Cardyn touched
the inspector.</p>

<p>"Did you see a tall youngish man, fair, with rather noticeable
white teeth, and a monocle fixed in one eye, who sat a little way
behind us and apparently took great interest in the case? He was
making notes in a book on his knee."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "Mr. David Branksome, your
predecessor."</p>

<p>"Was he?" For once Cardyn was taken utterly by surprise. "Did
you see him apparently pushed close to our party by the jostling of
the crowd? In reality he was cleverly edging himself up to Miss
Balmaine. I saw him pass something&mdash;a note apparently to
her."</p>

<p>The inspector laughed a little, and feeling in his waistcoat
pocket held out his hand to the younger man. Bruce looked at the
grubby piece of paper lying in his palm.</p>

<p>"Mosswolds'&mdash;4 o'clock to-morrow."</p>

<p>"An appointment?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it," said the inspector. "We shall have to put in an
appearance there, Mr. Cardyn." Bruce glanced at it doubtfully. "But
will Miss Balmaine keep the appointment when she finds that she has
lost her note?"</p>

<p>"She will not know," the inspector said confidently. "Miss
Balmaine like one or two of the others concerned in this remarkable
case is just a little too clever, Mr. Cardyn. She managed to read
that note, holding it low down in her hand while the people were
all round the court. When she had finished she tore it into several
pieces and let it fall to the floor, thinking, no doubt, that she
was unobserved and that she had done with it for ever. But there
was a little ragged boy, who had managed somehow to push himself
into the court&mdash;a little ragged boy who was close behind her
when she dropped it. He picked it up&mdash;I am sure it will not
surprise you to learn that he is one of my keenest sleuths&mdash;he
put the pieces together with some bits of stamp paper, took a taxi
and was here as soon as we were."</p>

<p>"A smart piece of work altogether!" commented Bruce Cardyn.
"'Mosswolds'&mdash;a restaurant off Piccadilly, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Mostyn Street, left off Bond Street," corrected the inspector.
"I hear the car is ordered directly after luncheon to-morrow to
take the young ladies to the dressmaker's. I expect our young lady
will manage to slip away from there. At any rate we shall be ready
for her."</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;es." Bruce paused and hesitated, then he said slowly,
"In spite of the doctor's evidence and also the fact that I know
the modern young woman is athletic, I have always doubted the
possibility of that blow having been struck by a woman,
inspector."</p>

<p>The inspector looked at him.</p>

<p>"I fancy that an athletic girl of to-day could strike home just
as swiftly and just as surely as a man."</p>

<p>"Well, it may be so," Cardyn acknowledged reluctantly. "But I
should not call either of the two girls in this case&mdash;Miss
Fyvert and Miss Balmaine&mdash;particularly athletic."</p>

<p>"Miss Fyvert plays hockey and cricket and tennis, takes fencing
lessons and rides to hounds. She is no weakling," commented the
inspector dryly. "As for Miss Balmaine, she has lived all her life
in Australia until the last few months, for the most part at a
sheep farm, miles from civilization. That fact speaks for
itself."</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;es," Bruce acquiesced. "Nevertheless, inspector, I feel
quite sure that neither of these girls killed Lady Anne. Miss
Fyvert, of course, is out of the question&mdash;the idea is so
absurd as to be almost farcical. And I do not, in spite of various
suspicious happenings, I cannot believe Margaret Balmaine
guilty!"</p>

<p>"No?" The inspector's eyes were watching the younger man's face
with a curious expression in their keen depths. Then, taking his
pocket-book from his breast pocket, he carefully extracted a
bank-note and held it out to Cardyn. "Do you know what this
is?"</p>

<p>"A fifty-pound bank-note," replied Cardyn, glancing at it in
surprise. "Do you mean that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is one of the notes given in payment for the pearls by
Messrs. Spagnum and Thirgood's manager to the supposed Lady Anne
Daventry. The first we have traced so far. It was paid to her
dressmaker by&mdash;whom do you think?"</p>

<p>"Miss Balmaine, I suppose," Bruce said quietly. "That is what you
mean, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," said the inspector, a note of triumph creeping into
his voice. "This note was paid to Madame Benoit by Miss Dorothy
Fyvert in part payment of her account, which account had been
running on for several years. Madame says that she had of late been
very pressing for at least something on account, as her own
liabilities were great. Another thread of the clue leading to Miss
Dorothy Fyvert!"</p>

<p>"Clue&mdash;clue!" Bruce Cardyn repeated contemptuously. "If all
the clues in the world led to Dorothy Fyvert I should still believe
her innocent. As for this"&mdash;flicking the note
contemptuously&mdash;"it is no clue at all. It may have been given
to Miss Fyvert by Miss Balmaine, or by anybody. Probably it was a
present from Lady Anne herself, for I am coming round to the
opinion that the old lady sold her pearls and then pretended to
have lost them."</p>

<p>"So that is your opinion, is it?" the inspector questioned
dryly. "Well, well, time will show. Now, Mr. Cardyn, we have a busy
day or two before us. This house is to be closed and placed in the
hands of caretakers as soon as possible. As you know by Lady Anne's
will, her brother has the right to select what furniture of hers he
pleases up to the value of two hundred pounds, the rest passes to
Mr. John Daventry, the jewels and Lady Anne's personal belongings
are left to Miss Fyvert, though a codicil gives certain jewels to
Miss Margaret Balmaine. Now, Mr. Fyvert and Mr. Daventry have
decided that with a few exceptions the furniture shall be sold and
the house placed in an agent's hands as soon as possible and either
sold or let on a long lease. Mr. Daventry goes down to the Keep
to-morrow and Mr. Fyvert and his nieces and Miss Balmaine will
leave for North Coton at the end of the week. The servants are to
be discharged at once. They will have their legacies and Mr.
Daventry will give them a month's board and wages. Then, when the
house is empty, our opportunity will come in. You and I will be
able to do something, Mr. Cardyn."</p>

<p>"I don't know!" Bruce Cardyn took a few steps up the room then
turned as if he had come to a sudden resolution. "If we have not
discovered the murderer when the people are in the house I don't
think we shall do much when it is empty. But, in any case,
inspector, it is my intention to give up this case."</p>

<p>"Really! May I ask why?" The inspector took up a position with
his back to the fire, throwing a lightning glance from time to time
from beneath his bushy eyebrows at Cardyn.</p>

<p>"Well, in the first place, I am not really any use," Cardyn
said, his voice growing determined. "I do not know whether it is by
your orders, inspector, but any independent investigation attempt
is at once suppressed by the police. I am reduced to watching you
at your work and becoming a sort of chorus&mdash;a Watson to your
Sherlock Holmes, don't you know. Now that won't suit me. I came
here, engaged by Lady Anne Daventry herself, to make her life safe
and to discover her would-be assassin. How lamentably I failed you
know as well as do. But acknowledging my failure I see now that I
ought to have retired from the case, not stayed on as your
assistant or factotum, whichever you like to call it."</p>

<p>"So now you want to leave me to finish the case, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes. I mean to leave the case in the hands of the regular
police. My partner is already grumbling at my long absence."</p>

<p>"Just so!" The inspector came a step nearer. "Suppose I say that
you shall not go&mdash;that you shall stay and help us just as long
as I choose, Mr. Bruce Cardyn?"</p>

<p>Cardyn flushed hotly.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine anything so absurdly inconceivable."</p>

<p>"Can you not?" A change came into the inspector's voice. It grew
suddenly stern and harsh. "And yet I say it now. I tell you that if
you attempt to give up this case, I will have you instantly
arrested for the murder of Lady Anne Daventry. You will stay with
me and act as my assistant or factotum, as you term it, until I
release you. Now, do you understand?" His steel-grey eyes were
fixed gimlet-like upon the young man's face, as though they would
wrest every secret his brain contained from him.</p>

<p>For a moment Bruce Cardyn stared at him in speechless
stupefaction. Then the hot colour that anger had brought to his
face during the first part of the inspector's speech paled
suddenly. He became white, lurid, corpse-like. Only his eyes met
the inspector's honestly enough, but with something&mdash;was it
horror or fear or anguish, or some subtler emotion compounded of
all three?&mdash;looking out of their tortured depths.</p>

<p>He moistened his lips, he tried to speak, but at first no words
would come.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;you mean&mdash;what do you mean?" he stuttered
at last.</p>

<p>The Ferret's eyes watched him mercilessly, missing not one
detail, not one iota of the misery in his face. Then the inspector
came close up to him.</p>

<p>"Now you shall hear what I mean," the grim voice went on. He
stuck his face forward and whispered a few words in the young man's
ear. "Now I think you know what I mean&mdash;and what other people
will call you if I speak aloud&mdash;now you will realize why you
will stay here as the Watson to my Sherlock Holmes, until I give
you permission to return to your inquiry office&mdash;to retire
from the case."</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>The papers were full of the inquest on Lady Anne Daventry. There
were sensational headlines on the front pages, developments were
expected hourly. The inspector's remarks about the finger-prints
were quoted everywhere. John Daventry's evidence was given almost
verbatim.</p>

<p>A great pile of the morning papers lay on the breakfast table in
that house in Charlton Crescent. A hurried perusal of them was
being rapidly made by John Daventry, while the raucous cries of the
street vendors, floating in through the open window, could be heard
from the Bayswater Road.</p>

<p>"Finger-Print Test!"</p>

<p>"Clues in the Hands of the Police!"</p>

<p>At last with an exclamation of rage Daventry strode to the
window and banged it down.</p>

<p>The only other occupant of the room, the rector of North Coton,
looked up in mild surprise from his breakfast.</p>

<p>"Dear me, John, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Matter?" echoed Daventry in exasperated accents. "Didn't you
hear those confounded newsboys in the streets just now?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I was not taking any notice of them," confessed the
rector. "You see, my dear John, that is a fault I am afraid we
priests are very prone to, inattention. We have so schooled
ourselves, I might almost say as a duty, to abstract ourselves from
our earthly surroundings when we are composing our sermons that it
becomes almost second nature."</p>

<p>In spite of his wrath Daventry grinned wickedly. "I have taught
myself to abstract my thoughts when I am listening to 'em, I
know."</p>

<p>The rector's mild smile did not decrease.</p>

<p>"That is the sort of thing the rising generation thinks funny, I
believe. Never mind, my dear John, time will bring you wisdom. And
now, to change the subject. Personally I think that it is a mistake
in talking so much of the five people in the room when my dear
departed sister was murdered, and implying, or saying as some of
them do say in so many words, that the murderer was to be found
among you. The very idea would be ludicrous if the occasion was not
so serious. The doors were open, and anyone might have come in and
snatched up the dagger and&mdash;and used it and got away again. To
say nothing of the man at the window&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn!" said John Daventry suddenly and heartily.</p>

<p>"My dear John!" The rector looked shocked.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir." Daventry pushed back his chair and
going over to the mantelpiece took a cigarette from his case and
lighted it. "But when I think of that blighter I lose my temper. If
he hadn't got up to the window with his clamps or whatever the
things are he wears, Aunt Anne would have been alive now. Do you
suppose anyone would have got into the room and stabbed her if we
had all been sitting round at tea?"</p>

<p>"Of course they could not," agreed Mr. Fyvert. "I see you hold
the theory of the Cat Burglar, John."</p>

<p>"What other theory is there to hold?" Daventry questioned. "The
fellow was there safe enough. They tell me he couldn't have got up
from the terrace, because there were detectives planted all about
the garden below. Well, if those bally brutes in the garden were no
better than their master in the house, I don't think they would have
done much to interfere with the Cat Burglar."</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I don't know." The rector, having finished
his breakfast, folded his hands over his slightly prominent
waistcoat and looked at Daventry with friendly interest. "I have
formed no theory at all myself. I am content to think of it as a
terrible and mysterious happening, and to leave it at that, until
all is revealed in due time."</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Mr. Fyvert, I have woke up two or three times
in a night sometimes lately, and have seen the whole blasted
thing&mdash;the scaffold and all the thingumajigs, you know, and
feel that I have had a good breakfast&mdash;tea and toast and an
egg&mdash;the poor beggars always do, you know. And I'm there all
tied up and blindfolded. My God! I went over the trenches times
enough, but this&mdash;And when I think of the poor wretches that
have faced it&mdash;and women too&mdash;my Lord, but it won't bear
thinking about." He ended with a strong shudder, and turning his
face to the mantelpiece rested his arms on the high wooden shelf
and laid his head upon his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Fyvert looked at him with pitying wonder.</p>

<p>"My dear John, this is nerves, you know&mdash;nothing but
nerves! You must make up your mind not to give way to it. It is a
good thing you are going down to the Keep. In the country and away
from this house you will soon look upon things in a different
light."</p>

<p>"I don't know what sort of a light the folks at the Keep will
regard me in," retorted Daventry. "They liked Aunt Anne down there,
you know. They knew her before the boys died and she became crabby
and crotchety. I would go abroad&mdash;big game shooting or
something of that sort&mdash;but that fellow Furnival gave me a
hint that if I tried to get out of reach in any way I should be
arrested at once."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to think that Inspector Furnival exceeds his
duty," observed Mr. Fyvert, stroking his clean-shaven chin. "He
said something of the same kind to the girls this morning."</p>

<p>"The girls!" thundered Daventry, staring at him. "Do you mean
Dorothy and Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Oh, do not shout so, my dear John. It goes through my head,"
the rector said, putting his hand to his brow. "I quite agree with
you&mdash;the idea is preposterous. He was speaking more
particularly to Margaret, I think. She was speaking of returning to
Australia. I fancy that since my poor sister's death she has felt
that she would rather go home to her old friends. One cannot wonder
at it. But Furnival warned her that neither she nor any of the
witnesses would be allowed to get out of communication with the
police."</p>

<p>"Then I should think he does indeed exceed his duty," uttered
Daventry explosively. "Of course if the police have reason to think
that anybody committed a crime they can arrest him or her as the
case may be. But I am blessed if they can keep the whole lot of us
dangling round while they try to manufacture evidence against us. I
shall consult my solicitor as soon as I get back to the Keep. I
don't put any faith in these jumped-up johnnies here myself."</p>

<p>"I think you will be quite wise," the rector approved. "I
suppose you know that Margaret is anxious to realize her share of
what was left her by my sister."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't know. But I think&mdash;" Daventry was beginning,
when he was interrupted.</p>

<p>Soames came in with a pile of letters that had come in by the
second post.</p>

<p>"Might I speak to you, gentlemen, for a minute?" he said,
looking inquiringly from one to the other.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the tragedy of his mistress's death had
told terribly upon Soames and was still telling upon him. He looked
years older than the bland and portly butler who had taken the
cakes in to that memorable tea-party.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you in the first place, gentlemen, if the house
is to be closed from to-morrow, what is to become of my silver? Is
it to go to the bank?"</p>

<p>"No. Nothing is to be taken from the house but your own personal
belongings, I understand from Inspector Furnival," the rector of
North Coton answered him, while Daventry stared moodily into the
fire.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but, sir, I can't leave it like that," expostulated
Soames. "Some of it is very valuable and my lady set great store by
it and it has always been my pride to keep it as she liked to see
it. It would break my heart to leave it here, to be stolen by
anybody who got into the house."</p>

<p>"The silver will be safe enough, Soames," John Daventry
interposed. "The house will be occupied by men from Scotland Yard.
But you must have your inventory ready. You will have to go over it
with Inspector Furnival this afternoon, I expect."</p>

<p>"What, sir?" Soames started as if he had been stung, and a thin
streak of red showed in his cheeks. "Go over my silver with
Inspector Furnival as if I was a common thief? Me that has never
laid a teaspoon wrong since I have been in her ladyship's
service!"</p>

<p>"Ah, well! You are only in the same boat as the rest of us,
Soames," Daventry said with a grim humour that was new to him. "We
are all thieves and murderers in the eyes of the police."</p>

<p>"You always will have your joke, sir," Soames said with a sickly
smile. "But, if I could have given it over to you, Mr. John, or to
you, Mr. Fyvert, sir, instead of to the police, I should not have
minded half so much. But to the police!"</p>

<p>"Well, well! Buck up, Soames, you will have to get over it.
After all, it is left to different people, so you would have to
part with it anyhow," Daventry went on. "But about yourself,
Soames. What are you going to do, old chap? One doesn't like to
think of you with anyone else, after all your years of faithful
service with the Daventrys. But we have got old Grieve at the Keep,
and my mother won't hear of anyone in his place."</p>

<p>"No. Nor is it right that she should, sir, if you will excuse
me," Soames said respectfully. "But, if you would allow me, sir, I
did hear when old Mr. Blount of the Daventry Arms died, that the
widow wasn't going to keep the house on. If you would let it to me
and speak a good word for me with the magistrates&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be all right, of course. Though I don't know how
far my words would go with the magistrates nowadays. I am likely to
find that out for myself soon, I fancy," John Daventry said with
sardonic humour. "And of course we should love to have you at
Daventry, old chap. But it will run into a good bit of money. Mrs.
Blount wants to sell the furniture with the house, and there will
be the transfer of the licence and Heaven knows what. Do you think
you will be able to manage it?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, sir. I have always had good money, as you know. And
I have been a thrifty man and put by a little each year, so with
what her poor ladyship left me, I am quite well off.
Besides&mdash;" he paused, smiling and looking sheepish.</p>

<p>"Besides what?" cried Daventry. "Upon my word, I believe you are
going to be married, Soames! Who is it, man? Out with it&mdash;who
is the lucky lady?"</p>

<p>"I look upon myself as the lucky one, sir," said Soames,
striving to recapture his usual manner and failing signally. "But
we have walked out for years, though nothing binding between us,
and now we are thinking of spending our old age together. I speak
of Miss Pirnie, sir&mdash;her late ladyship's maid."</p>

<p>"Pirnie, by Jove!" For once John Daventry's laugh rang out
almost as free from cares as ever as a vision of the lady maid's
mincing affectation, and her elaborately coiffured dyed hair, rose
before his eyes. Then he held out his hand. "I wish you the best of
luck, Soames, both of you. You may depend upon me about the
Daventry Arms. We should like to have you settled near as
neighbours of ours."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir!" There were real tears in
Soames's eyes as he pressed John's hand and then turned to press
that which the rector of North Coton extended in congratulation.
"You are very kind. And if you ever want a hand at the Keep, sir,
why, we shall always be pleased to do what we can, speaking for
Miss Pirnie and myself, for we shall always look upon ourselves as
the Daventrys' servants."</p>

<p>When he had bowed himself out, John Daventry looked at Mr.
Fyvert.</p>

<p>"Good old Soames! Well, I am glad Aunt Anne's money is going to
make those two good souls happy."</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes!" responded the rector. "Soames belongs to the
old-fashioned class of servant&mdash;a type that is rapidly
becoming extinct nowadays."</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Mosswolds' was one of those very small, ultra-smart, restaurants
that are to be found tucked away in side-streets all about the West
End; mostly perhaps in the region of Bond Street and the shops. No
band played. Mosswolds' did not cater for the class of person who
takes tea to the accompaniment of a jazz band. But the table linen
and the china were always fresh and dainty. Flowers from the
country came up every morning to Mosswolds' and were set in crystal
vases on every table. Above there was plenty of space. The tables
stood in corners, or by the windows, or in the middle of the room,
but always the customers could talk without fear of being
overheard. To-day at four o'clock, there were very few people in
the room, but then Mosswolds' was never: crowded. The waitresses
wore a particularly becoming uniform of pale almond green, with
cream-coloured mob caps and dainty coquettish aprons. The frocks
were short enough to show silk stockings of the same shade of
green, and suede shoes to match with Louis Quinze heels and paste
buckles. Report had it that all the waitresses at Mosswolds' were
ladies. However that might be, they were generally remarkably
good-looking girls.</p>

<p>This afternoon, as business was slack, one of them was talking
to a customer who had just come in. A well-dressed woman of
middle-age who seemed to be waiting for some one. Presently a young
man entered; a tall, rather good-looking man with fair hair and a
monocle screwed into his left eye. He selected a table near the
window and sat down.</p>

<p>The woman who had been talking to the waitress moved to a table
at the other side of the room, quite out of earshot, but from
whence a good view of the second customer's table could be
obtained.</p>

<p>Then she ordered tea, and, taking out a book, began glancing at
it in an absent fashion.</p>

<p>The young man, too, ordered tea, and then began to watch the
door. Quite evidently he was expecting some one; more than once he
glanced impatiently at the clock. At last a girl in deep mourning
came quickly through the swing door, He rose quickly and went
forward to meet her.</p>

<p>"My darling, I thought I was never going to see you again!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Davy dear, you know it hasn't been my fault!" the girl said
quickly. "And even now I can't stop long. But&mdash;is this safe?"
She looked round doubtfully. A few people sat about at distant
tables. Just opposite was the friend of the waitress. Upon her the
girl's glance rested longest. "You are sure she can't hear?"</p>

<p>The man laughed. "Quite, quite sure. Come along, sweetheart, we
are as safe as houses here. And I have promised the waitress a
considerable <i>douceur</i> not to let anyone come near us."</p>

<p>They sat down and began to talk, leaning forward and looking
into each other's eyes in a fashion that made the waitress giggle.
The woman at the opposite table smiled a little too, as she put
down her book and began to attack the pile of buttered toast she
had ordered.</p>

<p>The two at the table went on talking.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come to the old place yesterday or the day
before?" the man questioned.</p>

<p>"Because that horrid detective was prying about," answered the
girl, whom the distant watcher had no difficulty in identifying as
Margaret Balmaine. "He is always popping up somewhere, just in the
last place one expects him. It is a marvel I have been able to get
away from him today. Even now I shouldn't be surprised if he were
the next person to come through that door. Davy, are we going to
North Coton to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"So I have heard. At least I know you are leaving town
to-morrow. Your destination is at present a secret, so far as the
press is concerned. You will be glad to get away, darling!"</p>

<p>"Glad!" the girl echoed. "Oh, Davy, life at Charlton Crescent
just now is nothing but hell! Picture it. Every one looking at
every one else, wondering who is guilty&mdash;who may be the next
one to be killed. And detectives all around us spying, trying to
find out the smallest thing to tell them who the murderer is." She
bit her lip. "I don't know what to do&mdash;I'm frightened!
Frightened. And&mdash;and, Davy"&mdash;her voice dropped to the
faintest whisper&mdash;"suppose they suspect us?" A great pity
dawned in the man's eyes. Ordinarily David Branksome's face was
hard, his expression unsympathetic. Only one woman ever saw the
softening in his eyes, heard the tenderness in his tone.</p>

<p>"They couldn't suspect, my darling&mdash;you&mdash;we are safe
enough. And very soon we shall be away from it all, alone together,
just you and I."</p>

<p>A new light dawned in the girl's eyes. She bent a little
nearer.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes! think of that time, Davy, dream of it. And
yet"&mdash;her face clouding over as suddenly as it had
brightened&mdash;"something seems to tell me that it will never
come, that he&mdash;that man will find out. Oh, Davy, Davy, in
spite of all we have done, all our precautions, suppose he&mdash;he
finds it out. What will they do to me if he does?" She broke off
with a gasp of horror.</p>

<p>The man leaned over and laid one hand on hers. "They won't find
out," he said tenderly. "They can't, I have been much too careful,
and&mdash;and if the very worst came, I should speak out, I should
not let you suffer."</p>

<p>The girl gazed at him with terrified eyes. "But&mdash;but don't
you know that that would be worse than anything for me&mdash;that I
would a thousand times sooner bear the penalty myself. Oh, Davy,
Davy, will you never understand?"</p>

<p>"I know that you have always been far too good for me," the man
said, his hard voice breaking. "Ah, darling, if you had never met
me how different your life might have been."</p>

<p>"No life would have been life to me without you!" the girl said
unsteadily. "I don't mind anything, Davy, if they don't separate
us."</p>

<p>"They shall not!" the man assured her. But somehow his confident
tone did not ring true. "Be brave just a little while longer," he
went on, "it can hardly be a week or two now, and then think of the
reward. I keep it before my eyes always."</p>

<p>"So do I!" the girl whispered. "But&mdash;but I don't know how
long it will be, Davy. I can't get Mr. Fyvert to tell me even when
he thinks things will be settled up. He keeps saying that the
manner of Lady Anne's death complicates matters. I believe the
police tell him to. Davy, you will come to see me at North
Coton?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know!" the man hesitated. "We shall have to find
some means of communication, of course. But there is always the
possibility that our being seen together may delay matters, or even
bring about&mdash;discovery!"</p>

<p>"I don't see why it should!" the girl said obstinately. "It is
bad enough being alone among strangers, knowing what I know. But to
be there, to look at one another, to catch some one looking at you
sideways. Oh, Davy, Davy, never can you imagine the horror. Often I
think I shall go mad, shall tell them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" The man's eyes narrowed; he drew his thin lips
together. "You must be my own brave girl to the end. Think what it
means, darling. The success, the reward of all our efforts. No more
struggling. No more separation. And it will not be for so long as
you fear. Did you tell Mr. Fyvert that you wished to go back to
Australia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I did, but it was of no use," the girl said wearily. "I
do not think he would mind me realizing my share and going back.
But at the present time the police would not allow anyone to leave
the country&mdash;anyone, that is to say, who may be wanted as a
witness at the inquest, or any subsequent proceedings."</p>

<p>He drew his brows together. "That cannot go on for ever. The
English law would not give them the power to keep you indefinitely,
I am certain. And the moment they have paid the money
over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but if we do get away," the girl whispered.
"If&mdash;if they find out anything afterwards nowadays they could
follow us to Australia. There is the wireless and aeroplanes and
all sorts of things, we shouldn't be safe anywhere."</p>

<p>The man dropped his voice to a caressing murmur. "Only we
shouldn't go to Australia! What a little goose you are, darling; I
know the sweetest spot on earth and all my arrangements are made.
When our&mdash;I shall say our&mdash;honeymoon is over, I wonder
how you will like to be a farmer's wife?"</p>

<p>The girl's face lighted up momentarily. "I think, perhaps, I
might like it very much&mdash;if you were the farmer," she
confessed.</p>

<p>"It won't be as dull as it sounds," the man went on. "We shall
have our gay times and life can be very jolly in those southern
republics."</p>

<p>"Gaiety&mdash;gaiety! I only want safety&mdash;and you!" the
passion in her voice quickening. "But, Davy," coming nearer and
speaking so that he could only catch the words with
difficulty&mdash;"will you tell me if you&mdash;whether
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" The man's voice broke sharply across her hesitating
speech. "Don't ask&mdash;I don't want to know anything. Remember that
walls have ears&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl stood up shivering, drawing her furs more closely round
her.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then I must go now. I have been longer than I ought.
Suppose Dorothy has finished with her dressmaker and gone
home?"</p>

<p>"Does she know?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "No! But I think perhaps she guesses a
little. She was busy looking at patterns and I just slipped away
and left her a message saying I had a bad toothache and had gone to
get something for it. Still I think she will wait. She is not a bad
sort&mdash;Dorothy. And some day I hope things will be straight for
her."</p>

<p>"Of course they will," the man assented. But his eyelids
flickered curiously, his narrow lips curled in an unpleasant
fashion as he spoke. He pushed his chair back. "And I suppose I must
not even see you home, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"No! No! somebody might recognize us and guess!"</p>

<p>She looked very attractive standing there, her heavy furs drawn
closely round her shoulders, her throat gleaming white between, the
deep red gold of her hair just peeping out from beneath her cloche
hat, her eyes looking all the bigger and clearer for the dark half
circles beneath them, for the touch of lassitude and fatigue that
gave her face the look of pathos that enhanced the beauty that was
at times hard and unsympathetic. Her breathing had quickened;
despite her furs one could see her breast rising and falling, even
the plentiful use of her lipstick could not altogether spoil the
perfect curves of her mouth&mdash;the shape of her pretty lips.</p>

<p>The eyes of the man watching seemed to drink in every detail of
her loveliness. "Darling!" he said hoarsely at last. "Don't forget,
child. Don't let John Daventry&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl drew up her small golden head. "John Daventry is
nothing to me," she said icily. "If, after all, you do not trust
me, Davy!"</p>

<p>"I trust you with everything," the man said with sudden fire,
"even with life itself."</p>

<p>Several people were coming in. A little group gathered in the
middle of the room and obstructed the view of the watcher on the
side opposite. When once more she could see clearly the girl had
gone, the man was sitting alone at the table. He beckoned to the
waitress and put the bill into her hand with what was evidently an
unusually liberal tip, to judge by her expression.</p>

<p>The watcher got up and paid her modest account.</p>

<p>"I shall always be thankful that my mother made me learn the lip
language when was a child," she said to herself as she went
out.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>"And now," said Inspector Furnival, "there is a little hard work
before us, Mr. Cardyn, if we want to elucidate the mystery of
Charlton Crescent."</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn did not attempt to answer this thrust. Of late he
had not been thinking so much of the dead Lady Anne Daventry as of
the live Dorothy Fyvert. For Dorothy had been as good as her word.
Ever since she had discovered Cardyn to be a detective she had
deliberately cold-shouldered him, she had never spoken to him
unless absolutely compelled, and she had taken pains to express her
contempt for his chosen calling, whenever possible. Yet for that
very reason perhaps Cardyn's thoughts dwelt on her persistently.
She had dominated them more or less ever since the night of the
fire; he had not realized himself to how great an extent until he
met her again in Charlton Crescent. Then what had been heretofore a
cherished memory became a living, breathing reality&mdash;the
goddess of his dreams had become a very woman.</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival smiled as he looked at him.</p>

<p>"Come now, Mr. Cardyn, you must rouse yourself. There are just a
few questions I should like you to consider with me before we set
to work. I wonder if you can form an idea what they are."</p>

<p>Cardyn shook his head wearily. "Probably my ideas would not
coincide with yours."</p>

<p>"Well, come in here and I will show you my list. You can see how
you would answer them." The inspector opened the library door as he
spoke.</p>

<p>The house was now entirely in the hands of the police. They had
just watched the dispersal of the household. John Daventry had gone
down to the Keep in his small touring car, taking with him Soames
who was about to apply for the transfer of the licence of the
Daventry Arms. Mr. and Mrs. Fyvert had been accompanied to North
Coton by their two nieces, with Margaret Balmaine and their
respective maids. The other servants had dispersed in different
directions, all leaving their addresses with the police. Though
none of the furniture had gone the house looked cold and dismantled
in the absence of the life and movement that had so recently
pervaded it.</p>

<p>Cardyn shivered as he followed Inspector Furnival. The library
was the only room in the house that looked much the same as usual.
Since Lady Anne's death it had become the headquarters of the
police, and Inspector Furnival's papers were strewn about, while
books, presumably on subjects in the inspector's mind, lay on the
table.</p>

<p>The inspector took his favourite chair, and, drawing a sheet of
foolscap towards him, wrote:</p>

<p>"Question 1. Did Lady Anne Daventry herself sell her pearls to
Messrs. Spagnum, or did some one impersonate her sufficiently
cleverly to deceive their manager?</p>

<p>"Question 2. Who engineered the man at the window?"</p>

<p>Cardyn bent forward as the inspector's capable fingers wrote
down the second.</p>

<p>"Engineered?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;um, well, yes!" The inspector tapped his lip with his
pencil. "Perhaps 'engineered' is not the proper word, and yet it
describes what I mean better than 'managed' or 'helped.'"</p>

<p>"But do you mean that some one in the house knew&mdash;helped?"
Bruce questioned.</p>

<p>"In the house or not&mdash;I do!" the inspector said firmly.
"Why, put it to yourself, Mr. Cardyn. How could any man get up to
that window and get away again without being seen unless he had the
help of some one! How he did it is sufficiently difficult of
explanation, even with the help.</p>

<p>"Question 3. Who made the footmarks on the border, under the
window at the back of the hall?</p>

<p>"When those three questions are answered, Mr. Cardyn, we shall
be in a position to say who stabbed Lady Anne Daventry, as I firmly
believe."</p>

<p>"Ah, when!" Bruce Cardyn echoed, looking at them.</p>

<p>"And now," the inspector went on, "the first thing we have to do
is to make a thorough and systematic search of the house. I think
we will begin with the rooms of the two young ladies. But first let
me show you this." He took a sheet of paper from his pocket-book
and handed it to Cardyn.</p>

<p>The young man's heart beat fast as he saw the writing: "The
fifty-pound note about which you were inquiring," Dorothy had
written curtly, "was given me last week as my half-yearly
allowance, by my aunt, Lady Anne Daventry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you think of that?" the inspector inquired.</p>

<p>"I am quite certain that whatever Miss Fyvert tells you is
true," Bruce Cardyn said steadily.</p>

<p>"Quite so, quite so!" The inspector's eyes twinkled as he
watched the young man's moody face. "You understand, of course,
that this is one of the notes paid by Messrs. Spagnum and Thirgood
to the real or supposed Lady Anne Daventry?"</p>

<p>"I recognized that at once!" assented Cardyn. "And that answers
your first question. Lady Anne must have sold the pearls herself
since she gave part of the price to Miss Fyvert."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! Is that all you have to say, Mr. Cardyn?" the inspector
questioned ironically. "I do not think matters will be settled
quite so quickly as that. But now to the bedrooms&mdash;Miss
Balmaine's first."</p>

<p>Margaret Balmaine had occupied a large bedroom on the landing
above Lady Anne's. Like the rest of the house it was furnished in
Victorian fashion&mdash;a big four-poster, a massive wardrobe, a
large mahogany dressing-table with a big oval mirror inset; the
chairs, the couch and the washstand were all of the same heavy
type. Apparently Miss Balmaine had not troubled to make any
changes. The only traces of her occupancy that a cursory glance
revealed were sundry empty bottles on the toilet table, and a few
ashes in the empty fireplace, and an incongruous note was struck by
the presence of a small sewing-machine on a side table.</p>

<p>The inspector began to search the room in a very systematic
manner. Every shelf, every drawer in the sewing-machine, even every
peg in the wardrobe was moved. Every bottle was opened, every small
box, every inch of the furniture and bedstead scrutinized. In one
thing only, as far as they could see, had Lady Anne been up-to-date
within her bedrooms. Instead of the all-over carpet of Victorian
days, the floors were stained and there were soft rugs spread at
the bedside and before the fireplace. At last the inspector
paused.</p>

<p>"Not much to be learned here?"</p>

<p>"The fireplace!" Cardyn had got out his microscope. The
inspector had his in his hand. Together they knelt down, but the
ashes were just ashes of wood and coal, that was all. When they had
finished, the inspector stood up.</p>

<p>"Well, sometimes there is as much to be learned from what you
don't find in a person's room as from what you do."</p>

<p>Bruce made no answer. He regarded this meticulous search of
Margaret Balmaine's room as entirely superfluous. The inspector
drew up the bottom sash of the window and leaned out, looking
upwards and downwards and twisting himself about this way and that,
so that he could get a good view sideways. The creepers on this
side of the house grew right up to the window-sills and had been
parted so as to climb up each side.</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival stretched out and plucked a large ivy leaf
from just below the ledge.</p>

<p>"Miss Balmaine evidently thought it so important to destroy all
trace of what she burned that she even gathered the ashes together
and threw them out of the window," he remarked as he displayed a
slight powdering of white ash upon the ivy leaf.</p>

<p>"No hope of finding out what was burnt from that. But as I said
before we may gather a good deal from the fact that it was burned.
But come, I want to have a look at Lady Anne's bedroom." He led the
way to the big room below.</p>

<p>Cardyn followed, mildly wondering. It seemed to him that they
had gone through every inch of this room over and over again
already. Lady Anne's furniture in her own room was even more
Victorian than in the rest of the house. The four-poster, with its
carefully calendered chintz hangings, seemed to belong to an even
earlier period. There were no gimcrack ornaments or bottles of
essences or cosmetics in her room, nothing but a few solid boxes
and two very large, beautifully cut crystal scent-bottles much like
the looking-glass.</p>

<p>The inspector did not waste much time. He went straight to the
wardrobe where Lady Anne's dresses were and threw open the door.
Modern fashions and post-war tendencies had affected Lady Anne not
one whit. John Daventry had once said of her that had crinolines
been worn when she was young she would have been wearing them at
the time of her death. As it was she wore the long flounced
dresses, the fichus, the corsets, the leg of mutton sleeves, and
the tightly-fitting bodices of the late Victorian era. Her dress
had been simplified by the fact that since her boys' death she had
worn nothing but black. In the long drawers reposed her fine old
laces, a couple of Indian shawls, dainty cobwebby linen and silk
undergarments&mdash;her gowns in various stages of wear were
hanging in the big middle compartment. The inspector made straight
for this division and dived in, to emerge a moment later with a
triumphant expression.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I counted eight gowns, to-day&mdash;to-day there are
nine."</p>

<p>"What do you say?" Cardyn was regarding him with a distinctly
sceptical expression. "Where should the ninth come from, pray?"</p>

<p>"The ninth," said the inspector, taking out the garments one by
one and laying them on the bed, "was worn by the woman who
impersonated Lady Anne at Spagnum and Thirgood's."</p>

<p>"If there was such a woman," Bruce questioned, "why should she
put her gown here?"</p>

<p>"To get rid of it of course," the inspector said, with what
Bruce usually termed his air of cocksureness. "Don't you remember
that every one in the house was likely to have his or her luggage
searched? I had some such eventuality as this in my mind when I
framed that order. You see the possession of a gown of this kind
would inevitably have damned the possessor. It was too bulky to be
hidden or burned. This I call a brilliant idea for disposing of it.
It might have succeeded, probably would have, if the idea of making
a note of the number of dresses in Lady Anne's wardrobe had not
occurred to me yesterday. Now, to discover the interloper."</p>

<p>He turned back to the bed and began to examine the garments
minutely.</p>

<p>Cardyn watched him for a moment. "I am not supposing you made a
mistake in the number of dresses yesterday. But it is surely
possible that the maid transferred another gown of Lady Anne's to
the wardrobe?"</p>

<p>"She hadn't the chance!" the inspector said as his quick,
capable fingers turned the garments over. "Pirnie went early
yesterday afternoon, you may remember. There was nothing to keep
her&mdash;her work was over. I went over to the wardrobe after she
was gone."</p>

<p>"Then this was only put in last night!"</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "And I should have caught the person who
did it in the act, but the child Maureen had an attack of
sleep-walking and I followed her. A good thing I did, for she
seemed to be trying to throw herself out of the window. Her sister
was terrified."</p>

<p>"Which window?" Cardyn questioned quickly.</p>

<p>"The one at the back of the landing over this," the inspector
answered, throwing another gown back. "These damned things look all
alike and we shall have to get a dressmaking expert here."</p>

<p>"I believe they always have the name of the woman that made them
stuck on somewhere&mdash;on a bit of tape, don't you know?"
ventured Cardyn. "Now, if one of these was different from the
others it might tell us something."</p>

<p>"Brainy idea!" commented the inspector. "But unfortunately every
one of these gowns has the name of Lady Anne's dressmaker upon it.
What do you make of that?"</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if you were on the wrong track," Cardyn
commented. "I should say they were all Lady Anne's."</p>

<p>"Would you indeed!" the inspector questioned in that satiric
voice of his that seemed to be reserved for Cardyn.</p>

<p>He had taken a small case from his pocket and was looking
intently at what looked like a snippet of black rag laid
across.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are wondering where this came from?" As Bruce did
not reply, he went on, "It was caught in a little bit of the side
of the table on which Miss Balmaine's sewing-machine stands."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;h!" Bruce drew a long breath. "Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In itself it is nothing. But Miss Balmaine burned something,
remember, and there would be bonnet and mantle to get rid of. This
tiny bit of silk is almost too small to make certain, but I believe
it is exactly the same texture as this gown," pointing to the one
that lay by itself.</p>

<p>Bruce put the piece of silk on the skirt of the gown and
examined it through his microscope. "I believe it is. You see this
gown is much thicker than some of the others. It is what is called
watered silk&mdash;and on this little piece I see a suspicion of
the water."</p>

<p>"Well done!" said the inspector absently.</p>

<p>But he did not appear to be much excited at the discovery. He
was holding the gown up at arm's length, shaking it and peering
into the folds.</p>

<p>He drew out a tiny bit of notepaper, a scrap that had evidently
once been part of a letter.</p>

<p>"Ah! at last we have caught our clever friend napping!" he
exclaimed triumphantly. "'Impossible to come to you, my sweetheart,
until suspicion has&mdash;'" That was all. On the other side of the
paper was nothing, and not another scrap of paper was to be found,
search and shake as the inspector would. At last he desisted and
turned to Cardyn. "I suppose that you will hardly assert that this
belonged to Lady Anne."</p>

<p>"Well, no," Bruce conceded. "But unfortunately it does not seem
to bear any internal evidence as to the real owner."</p>

<p>The inspector chuckled and apparently he was well pleased with
the result of his search so far.</p>

<p>"It may help us&mdash;we are getting the threads together. What
is that?" as a loud rat-tat and peal of the bell sounded
simultaneously through the house. "A telegram! Can't be from the
Yard. They would have phoned!" the inspector grumbled.</p>

<p>Cardyn hurried downstairs to the door, a vague sense of disaster
deepening as he went.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>The brown envelope was addressed to Inspector Furnival. Leaving
the boy on the steps, Cardyn took the telegram to the inspector and
stood by whilst he opened it.</p>

<p class="letter">"From Dorothy Fyvert, The Rectory, North Coton,"

<p>he read aloud. Then he uttered a sharp exclamation of surprise:

<p>"What does this mean?"</p>

<p>"What is it, man? Can't you say?" Cardyn questioned
hoarsely.</p>

<p class="letter">"'Maureen has disappeared. Is she with you? If not, make
inquiries. Coming up by next train,'"

<p>the inspector read out slowly and stutteringly. "Disappeared!
That child! But when, or where. It is all very well to say 'Make
inquiries,' but how is one to make inquiries if one has no data
to start from?"</p>

<p>"Better phone to North Coton at once," Cardyn suggested.</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head. "No use. They are not on the phone
at North Coton Rectory. I had to wire when Lady Anne died. The Rev.
Augustus said he wouldn't be bothered with one for anything. I
fancy he rather despises modern improvements&mdash;like his sister.
'Coming up by next train?' Now, I wonder what that means? We will
have a look at the time-table."</p>

<p>He turned to "Bradshaw."</p>

<p>"Um! This telegram has been delayed," he said grimly, as he
turned over the pages. "Three-quarters of an hour longer than it
should have been on the way. Ah, here it is. There is a train from
Overend, the Junction for North Coton, due at Marylebone directly.
If Miss Fyvert caught that she could be here in a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Oh, no good going to meet it," in answer to a murmur from
Cardyn. "We should only miss one another; pass on the road. But
what can have gone wrong with the child? However, it's no use
speculating until we know the facts of the disappearance. Now,
until they come I think we will just take a look round the offices,
the butler's pantry, the kitchens and the servants' hall."</p>

<p>"There didn't seem to be much there when we went over them
before," remarked Cardyn.</p>

<p>"No; and I don't expect to find much there now," the inspector
nodded. "If there ever was anything incriminating in the rooms, it
would have been got rid of before now you may be sure." He spoke as
if he had entirely forgotten he was talking to one of the suspected
number.</p>

<p>Cardyn shot a quick glance at him and a slow, dull crimson line
showed on his forehead.</p>

<p>They went down the passage at the end of which was the green
baize door admitting to the servants' quarters. The butler's
pantry, which they visited first, was in absolute order. Soames's
grief at parting with his beloved silver had led him to leave it in
the most wonderful condition.</p>

<p>"Poor old Soames!" Cardyn remarked. "I hope he will get to the
Daventry Arms all right. I don't think you will find anything here,
inspector."</p>

<p>"Very likely not," the inspector assented. He was diving about
in the cupboards and the waste-paper baskets. A scrap of paper
seemed to have a fatal fascination for him. He spent the minutes
Cardyn was restlessly counting, looking for Dorothy Fyvert's
appearance, in examining with microscopic care a heap of old boots
thrown carelessly in one of the corners.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for there?" Cardyn inquired impatiently at
last.</p>

<p>"A pair of shoes&mdash;size eight," he answered, proceeding with
his search, while Cardyn stared in mingled consternation and
surprise.</p>

<p>But at the end of half an hour's search the inspector stood up.
"Nothing to be done here to-day, anyhow. It is getting time those
people were here&mdash;and, by Jove, they are!" as they heard a
taxi stop before the front door, and an almost simultaneous
ring.</p>

<p>Both men hurried back to the hall. Dorothy was on the top step.
The inspector frowned as he saw that behind her stood Margaret
Balmaine and the rector of North Coton.</p>

<p>"This bids fair to upset my apple-cart very considerably," he
ejaculated.</p>

<p>Dorothy literally sprang in and caught his hands. "Maureen, has
she been here?"</p>

<p>"Not a sign of her! Not a word but your telegram. Now, Miss
Fyvert, just tell me as quickly and as quietly as you can what has
happened!"</p>

<p>The inspector stepped back as he spoke; the others followed and
stood round him, Margaret Balmaine slipping her arm through
Dorothy's.</p>

<p>Both girls looked white and frightened. Dorothy was trembling
from head to foot, her great brown eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, inspector, you will find her for me. Our mother left her in
my charge." Her voice broke.</p>

<p>The inspector patted her hand. "I know just how bad you are
feeling, Miss Fyvert. I am a family man, you know." He produced his
notebook. "Now, you say the child has disappeared&mdash;where
from?"</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we don't know," Dorothy cried. "When we got to North
Coton Rectory, she just wasn't there&mdash;that was all."</p>

<p>"When did you see her last?"</p>

<p>"At Overend Junction," Dorothy answered, keeping back her
emotion by a supreme effort.</p>

<p>Cardyn, watching, could see the muscles in her pretty throat
pulsing and throbbing.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't come in the carriage with us. She would travel
with the maids, and the doctor said she was to be contradicted as
little as possible and, as it didn't seem to matter much, I let her
go. At Overend we changed to the little branch to North Coton. It
is a big, noisy Junction, and, as I had a lot of things to worry
me, I thought Maureen was safe enough with the maids; and I did not
look for her at North Coton Station. I shall reproach myself for
ever that I did not. But Mrs. Fyvert was taken ill in the train and
we were all busy looking after her. Naturally, the maids believed
that Maureen was in our compartment, while we thought she was with
them. It was not until we were in the hall at the Rectory that I
asked for her and found that nobody knew where she was. Uncle
Augustus saw her at Overend just before the train started."</p>

<p>"I think I saw her then, my dear," corrected the rector. "It is
my impression that I did. But my mind is much preoccupied just now,
so that I should not like to say more. Still, I believe that one of
the maids&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Susan, my maid," Dorothy said feverishly. "She says
that Maureen was with them at Overend, but that while she was
looking after the luggage the child slipped away. The only clue we
have at all to her disappearance is that Susan remarked that she
saw some one on the platform very like Alice. You remember the
housemaid that Maureen was so fond of. Oh, Inspector Furnival, can
you find her for us?"</p>

<p>The inspector blew his nose vigorously. "Of course we shall find
her. We will start at once. One moment&mdash;" He went into the
library to the telephone. "That is all right," he said, coming
back. "I have called up the police at Overend and put them on the
track, and also given directions to one of our best men to go down
at once. It ought not to be a difficult matter, though I wish we had
not lost so much time at the outset."</p>

<p>"I didn't think we had," Dorothy said ruefully. "My first
thought was to send that wire to you."</p>

<p>The inspector gave a queer smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, but that did not give us many particulars to work
upon. However, all's well that ends well, and I expect we shall be
able to restore Miss Maureen to you safe and sound within the next
few hours."</p>

<p>"Oh, inspector, you really think so!"</p>

<p>All Dorothy's hard-won composure gave way now, and she burst
into sobs.</p>

<p>The inspector patted her hand again. "There! There! you must not
fret. Everything will come out all right in the end. And now to
think where the child would be likely to go. You have another
sister, Miss Fyvert?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mrs. St. John Lavis&mdash;my half-sister, really. My
mother was twice married. But Maureen would not go to her. She has
seen very little of her of late years, and they never got on very
well. Besides, Mrs. Lavis is abroad just now."</p>

<p>"You speak of the child's liking for this Alice Grey," the
inspector questioned abruptly. "What was the secret of it?"</p>

<p>"Secret! There couldn't be any secret about it," Dorothy said.
"Lady Anne appointed Alice to wait upon Maureen while she was here
in the holidays, and the child took a fancy to her&mdash;that was
all. Maureen was always capricious in her likes and dislikes."</p>

<p>"I thought it was a very curious liking myself," Margaret
Balmaine observed, speaking for the first time. "And I must say
that of late Maureen looked as if she were frightened to death. It
was not only that she was ill, but she was scared&mdash;scared to
death! She used to be the jolliest, liveliest little thing on
earth&mdash;too jolly for me, a good deal. But lately there didn't
seem to be a bit of spirit left in her. I shall always say it was
very wrong to keep her in this house after Lady Anne's death. It
has been a terrible atmosphere for us all. It must have been
appalling for a delicate child like Maureen."</p>

<p>"But Maureen was never considered delicate," Dorothy
contradicted. "And the police wouldn't have let me go until
yesterday, or Alice. And the very idea of leaving us was enough to
send Maureen into a frenzy. Besides everybody was strictly
forbidden to speak to her of Aunt Anne's death."</p>

<p>"Not much use forbidding children to gossip with servants, as
far as my experience goes," Miss Balmaine contradicted. "I
remember, when I was a child staying in Derby, that I spent half my
time gossiping with the servants while my governess was away."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. A fine old town, Derby," the inspector said in a bland
tone that those who knew the Ferret best meant mischief. "I know
that part of the country very well myself. It is a beautiful old
town. Then you were in England when you were a child, Miss
Balmaine?"</p>

<p>Was it a spasm of fear that shot over Margaret Balmaine's face?
Even the inspector watching her between his narrowed eyelids could
not tell. If it were, she recovered herself in a moment.</p>

<p>"England!" she repeated with a light laugh.</p>

<p>"No, I never was in England until a few months ago. I thought
you knew that, inspector. Oh, I see! it was my saying Derby that
misled you. Derby is the name of the settlement nearest to us at
that time at home. Just a tiny, tiny place, while I believe Derby
in England is, as you say, a beautiful old town. There is a
Melbourne in England too, I understand&mdash;quite a small place,
while Melbourne in Australia is one of our great, magnificent
cities. Funny, isn't it? Things seem topsy-turvy, don't they?"</p>

<p>"They often do in life!" the inspector said dryly. "But now to
return to Miss Maureen. The first thing I want is a detailed
description of her, please, Miss Fyvert. Now her full
name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mary Frances Adelaide Fyvert. But she has always been called
Maureen. She was eleven last October."</p>

<p>The inspector was writing rapidly in his notebook. "Appearance,
please&mdash;colour of eyes and hair, height. Has she any birth, or
otherwise distinguishing mark?"</p>

<p>Dorothy bit her lips. "No, I don't believe she has the least
little mark anywhere. Height&mdash;well, I am really not quite
sure. About five feet, I should think, shouldn't you, inspector?
But I'm not sure, people always said Maureen was tall for her
age."</p>

<p>"We must try and get something a little more definite than
that," the inspector said sharply. "Now, the colouring,
please."</p>

<p>"She was fair and rosy, with big, hazel eyes and thick fair
hair, bobbed. At least she used to be rosy," Dorothy corrected
herself. "She has become terribly pale since she became ill."</p>

<p>"Clothing next, please&mdash;was it marked?"</p>

<p>"Just a short little frock of black marocain, with a black cloth
coat, edged with real astrakan, and a little pull-on black hat. No,
nothing would be marked, except her underclothing of course. That
would be marked either 'Maureen' in an embroidered medallion or a
monogram 'M.F.A.F.'"</p>

<p>"I see, thank you, Miss Fyvert." The inspector shut his notebook
with a snap. "And now we must set to work to find her for you."</p>

<p>"And do you think you will, inspector?" Dorothy clasped her
hands together, tears were vibrating in her voice, but it was
evident that she was making a tremendous effort to retain her
selfpossession.</p>

<p>"Oh, what can have become of her?" she cried. "Mother's little
Maureen whom she trusted to me. Surely, surely, nobody would be so
cruel as to hurt a child."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think Miss Maureen has been hurt," the inspector
assured her. "But now we will not waste time in suppositions. Mr.
Fyvert&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rector answered the look. "I have wired to the Charlton
Hotel for rooms. If you want us you will find us there, inspector.
Now then, girls!" He took Dorothy's hand and beckoned to Margaret
Balmaine.</p>

<p>As they reached the door, Dorothy pulled herself a little from
him. "Uncle Augustus, surely there is an evil spell over this
unhappy house! Why should these dreadful things be happening, one
after the other&mdash;unless God has given us over to the power of
the devil?"</p>

<p>When they had all gone, the inspector turned to Cardyn. "I feel
inclined to echo Miss Fyvert's question. It is impossible this
child's disappearance can be connected in any way with the horrible
crime we are investigating, and yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it impossible?" Cardyn questioned quietly.</p>

<p>The inspector looked at him. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;really hardly know." Cardyn said slowly. "But I seem to
have just a vague glimmering idea&mdash;that it might be. And yet
it seems too improbable to be true."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>Inspector Furnival walked slowly along past the chairs by the
Achilles statue, then he hesitated a moment and glanced round.</p>

<p>A poorly-dressed little lad ran up to him.</p>

<p>"Paper, sir?"</p>

<p>The inspector stooped to make his selection.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Just a little further on, sir, up by the Row," the boy
answered, his undertone to the full as cautious as the inspector's.
"Near the first big clump of crocuses. She is sitting on a chair by
herself and looks as if she was expecting some one."</p>

<p>The inspector gave him a nod and a copper and walked off
briskly, paper in hand. He had not far to go. The solitary figure
of a woman in mourning of which he was in search was close at hand.
With a throb of satisfaction he saw that the only chair near her
was empty. He slackened his pace a little as he went up, and raised
his hat.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Pirnie, this is an unexpected pleasure. Just having
an hour or so off, as you may say, thought I would turn into the Park
and have a look at the spring flowers. But it is dreary work taking
one's enjoyment by oneself. So, if you will allow me&mdash;" He
brought his chair close up to her, and sitting down with a hand on
each knee he regarded her with a friendly smile.</p>

<p>Pirnie did not return the smile. She cast a frightened glance at
him and half rose, then, changing her mind, sat down again. But she
made no attempt to respond to the inspector's civility. Instead she
said abruptly:</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?"</p>

<p>The inspector's smile became more suave and childlike than
ever.</p>

<p>"Want with you!" he echoed. "What should I want but a chat with
a lady I have often admired? We detectives are pretty much like
other men in our off-hours, Miss Pirnie."</p>

<p>The lady's maid was gradually recovering her self-possession.
The inspector's manner was so friendly, his glance so respectful
that her fears were allayed. She tossed her head now.</p>

<p>"I dare say! But&mdash;is this one of your off-hours then, Mr.
Furnival?"</p>

<p>"Well, it looks like it, doesn't it?" The inspector stretched
out his legs and regarded his feet contemplatively. "I must say I
have no fancy for going off by myself for my bits of holidays. I
like to see something of life&mdash;a scene like this now," waving
his hand comprehensively at the passers-by.</p>

<p>"You don't spend them with your wife, then?"</p>

<p>Pirnie pursued curiously and principally conscious of a
monkey-like desire to annoy the inspector.</p>

<p>"Spend them with my wife! Good Lord, ma'am!" The inspector
turned from his scrutiny of his boots to stare at her. "Ah, I see
you don't know that I lost my poor wife three years ago. She left
me with six children that have taken some looking after. But my
favourite sister got married to a rogue, more years ago than I care
to count. After he had broken her heart, he went off with another
woman and she has made her home with me ever since and looked after
the kids. She is very good to them, but it isn't altogether a
satisfactory arrangement. In point of fact I have not married
again, but it's quite on the cards I may, though I often think a
man in my profession is best unmarried. If he is married, it is a
job to keep things from a wife, leastways if he is attached to her,
and that is what I should hope to be to mine."</p>

<p>It was a long speech for the Ferret, who was one of the most
laconic of men in private life. At its conclusion he sat silent,
looking straight before him with a pensive expression that accorded
but ill with his sharp little features.</p>

<p>Pirnie bridled. A well-pleased smile lighted up her face. Her
long black ear-rings shook, various odd little pieces of jewellery
pinned about her black frock twinkled.</p>

<p>"Ay! It is one thing to say so beforehand, and another thing to
stick to it afterwards."</p>

<p>"Well, well; it may be so," the inspector admitted cautiously.
"But it seems to me the difficulty would be in not sticking to it,
if it was the right woman."</p>

<p>The style of conversation was quite to Pirnie's liking. She
began to think that she had sadly misused her opportunities
hitherto. She had hardly cast a glance at Inspector
Furnival&mdash;yet here was he an obvious victim to her charms. The
inspector saw that his prey would be an easy one. He cast an
admiring glance at her made-up countenance.</p>

<p>"I was just wondering&mdash;it isn't often I take a holiday and
when I do I want to enjoy myself&mdash;I was wondering whether you
would come and have a cup of tea with me. There is a tea place in
Ridley street, off Knightsbridge where they do you very well."</p>

<p>Surprise kept Pirnie silent for a minute, and the inspector went
on.</p>

<p>"Ay! It has come to me that you wouldn't hesitate if it was Mr.
Soames asking you. Well, well, it has been my luck to be just too
late in other ways."</p>

<p>Pirnie flushed up unbecomingly, her markings showing in ghastly
contrast with the dull crimson of the skin beneath.</p>

<p>"Soames!" she repeated, an accent almost of fear in her voice.
"What do you mean about Soames?"</p>

<p>The inspector laughed, his keen little eyes watching every
change in her face from beneath their lowered lids.</p>

<p>"Well, it is common knowledge&mdash;common gossip, perhaps I
should say, that Mr. Soames is hoping to take a certain lady with
him to the Daventry Arms when he goes there."</p>

<p>Pirnie recovered her self-possession with an effort.</p>

<p>"Hoping is one thing; doing is another. If Herbert Soames thinks
that he can reckon on me and treat me as he likes&mdash;well, he
will find out his mistake, that is all."</p>

<p>A faint smile gleamed for a second in the inspector's keen eyes.

<p>"Ay! When I saw you sitting here, I thought to myself that you
might be waiting for Mr. Soames and hesitated about butting in.
Then I thought again and I thought to myself, 'No, Miss Pirnie is
the sort that men wait for, not that waits for them,' and I came
across to you. But if I have made a mistake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You haven't!" Pirnie snapped. She got up with a jerk, her long
black veil floating round her, the flush on her cheeks showing more
plainly than ever against her rouge and powder. "Come, then, I
believe I will go with you to the tea-rooms after all," she said,
with an attempt at coquetry that deepened Furnival's unseen
smile.</p>

<p>They walked across the Row, and went down the passage by the
barracks. The tea-rooms were in a side street off Knightsbridge.
Furnival was fortunate enough to secure a corner table and they sat
down. He ordered a sumptuous tea. Pirnie's eyes sparkled. She loved
the good things and bright places of life, and since Lady Anne's
death she had felt as if she were living in some strange and
horrible dream. She told herself now that surely this must be a
very pleasant and unexpected awakening. Under the influence of the
hot creamed tea and the hot buttered muffins she waxed loquacious,
and, Furnival leading her on, chattered at considerable length
about the household at Charlton Crescent. She little knew how much
she revealed, but the precise information for which he was waiting
did not come. He saw that he would have to put a few leading
questions.</p>

<p>Hitching his chair a little nearer the table, he leaned
across.</p>

<p>"I expect her ladyship did not often go out with you, Miss
Pirnie?"</p>

<p>"Without me?" Pirnie opened her eyes. "Her ladyship hadn't been
out without me for years. Even if Miss Fyvert or Miss Balmaine went
with her, she would have me with her in case she wanted
anything."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, I don't wonder at it," the inspector said
gallantly. "But it is a funny thing now. A man I met the other day
told me he saw Lady Anne Daventry driving up Piccadilly by herself
one afternoon, it may be a month ago now."</p>

<p>Pirnie's eyes opened wider and wider. Her affectation dropped
from her momentarily.</p>

<p>"That he never did, I will swear. Why, her ladyship hadn't been
out for months before she died. Let me see&mdash;in October it
would be&mdash;she went to buy a wedding present for Lord Fyvert,
and when she came back home she said, 'Pirnie,' she said, 'it is
the last time. It tires me too much. For the future the tradesmen
will have to send their goods to me. I shall not go outside the
garden.' And she kept to that, Mr. Furnival. Not once afterwards
did she put her nose outside the garden."</p>

<p>"Um! That so?" said the inspector, stirring his tea
thoughtfully. "Well, folks will say anything. Do you know what I
heard the other day&mdash;that people are making bets that it was
Lady Anne herself that sold her pearls and then pretended to have
lost them!"</p>

<p>"What!" Genuine indignation coloured the maid's face now. "I
never heard such a wicked thing in my life. My poor lady that never
lived up to her income, and always put some by every year, to be
accused of selling her own pearls that she loved so for the sake of
her father and mother. Besides"&mdash;cooling down a
little&mdash;"if she had done such a thing she would have kept
quiet and nobody would have known anything about it in her
lifetime. She would not have called the police in, it stands to
reason, if she had sold them herself. Why should she?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed?" The inspector gazed in front of him, pulling
thoughtfully at his clean-shaven chin. "Besides, as you say, she
couldn't have got to Spagnum's by herself and without your
knowing."</p>

<p>"No, that she never did, I will swear," Pirnie answered
positively.</p>

<p>"That settles the matter," the inspector said, taking up another
cake and changing the subject. "You must be glad to get away from
the house in Charlton Crescent, Miss Pirnie."</p>

<p>Pirnie clasped her hands. "Oh, I can't tell you how glad! It has
been terrible there of late. Not knowing! And being afraid of
everybody. Mr. Furnival&mdash;who do you think killed my lady?"</p>

<p>The inspector met the question with another. "Who do you?" he
returned sharply.</p>

<p>Pirnie shivered. "I don't know," she whispered hoarsely. "But I
am frightened&mdash;I dare not even think&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inspector reached over the tea-tray and laid his firm strong
hand upon the quivering shaking one lying on the edge of the table.
"Don't think of it," he advised. "Put it out of your mind. At any
rate Lady Anne valued your services and appreciated them as you
deserved. And you loved her&mdash;you had nothing to do with her
awful fate. You could not help it."</p>

<p>To his consternation Pirnie burst into tears. "No! No! I could
not help it," she sobbed. "I lie awake night after night thinking
what I might have done to safeguard my lady."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't do that! It is very bad for you," the inspector said
in a strictly non-committal voice.</p>

<p>There were not many people in the room, none really within
earshot, but the few there were were beginning to glance at them
curiously. The inspector had no wish to be recognized.</p>

<p>"And now, dear lady, if you will put your handkerchief away and
take another cup of tea, I will tell you a queer thing that has
happened. It hasn't got into the papers yet, so far as I know."</p>

<p>Curiosity dried Pirnie's tears. "What is it, Mr. Furnival? You
may depend upon me."</p>

<p>"I know I can," the inspector said with a sympathetic glance.
"You would be a loyal friend, Miss Pirnie, whatever happened. And
this is a terrible thing. The child has disappeared."</p>

<p>"The child!" Pirnie repeated in a tone only half comprehending
and wholly incredulous. "You don't&mdash;you can't mean Miss
Maureen?"</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "Yes! She disappeared while travelling
down to North Coton yesterday with the Fyverts and her sister and
Miss Balmaine."</p>

<p>"Disappeared!" Pirnie's eyes grew round with horror. "Inspector,
how could she&mdash;out of a railway carriage?"</p>

<p>The inspector coughed. "Well, I didn't mean literally out of a
railway carriage. As a matter of fact she was seen at the junction.
Every one seems to have thought she was with some one else and she
was not discovered to be missing until they reached North Coton
Rectory. Her sister is nearly out of her mind."</p>

<p>"Poor Miss Dorothy! So I should think!" Pirnie sat silent a
minute, her eyes looking straight before her. The inspector watched
her keenly between his mouthfuls of buttered muffin.</p>

<p>"Mr. Furnival, this can't have had anything to do with my lady's
death&mdash;Miss Maureen can't know anything! It is an
impossibility!"</p>

<p>The inspector finished his muffin and took a long draught of tea
before answering. Then his cup was pushed away from him.</p>

<p>"Miss Pirnie, I may trust you with what wouldn't tell another
person living. I'll be hanged if can make out whether she does or
she doesn't. There has always to my mind been something queer about
the child. But I can't see how she could have been connected with
the murder and that is a fact! Still, it seems to me that someone
must have had a motive for getting her away. What do you think of
this Alice Gray that she was so friendly with?"</p>

<p>Pirnie tossed her head. "I never was one to take up with the
under servants. Alice knew her work and her place, and did the one
and kept the other. That was all I knew about her. When she was set
to wait on Miss Maureen because the child could not go to school
and took a fancy to her, I thought it was a good thing. For Miss
Maureen was a handful! But there, Alice could not have run away
with her!"</p>

<p>"Of course she couldn't," the inspector assented. But his tone
was neither convincing nor convinced.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, Alice Gray gave the police her home address, somewhere
out past New Barnet. She said she was going there at once, and in
fact was seen off on her way by the footman. But she never arrived
there. At least she hadn't last night."</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" Words failed the maid for a minute. "We are
living in queer times, Mr. Furnival," she said at last. "I often
wish my lot had been cast in the good old days when folks could at
least sleep in their beds at night in peace."</p>

<p>"The world would have been a good deal poorer to-day if your
wish had been granted, Miss Pirnie," the inspector said gallantly.
"But now, I have upset you, and it is vexing me past a bit. You
will be losing your good looks and that would be more than I could
stand. Miss Maureen and Alice Gray will be found very soon, both of
them, you may take it from me. And, look here, how would it be if I
was to look in at your place sometime this week of an evening? I
might have some news for you&mdash;that would set your mind at
rest."</p>

<p>Pirnie stood up and adjusted her hat and drew on her long
gauntlet gloves. "That would be very kind of you," she said
unsteadily. "But&mdash;I don't know. Perhaps it would be better
not, inspector. I expect I shall hear if there is any good news to
hear soon&mdash;somehow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it might upset some one else if I called?" suggested the
inspector. "Maybe, Mr. Soames&mdash;"</p>

<p>The woman's half-averted face turned crimson. "Please do not
speak of Mr. Soames. He is nothing to me."</p>

<p>"That so?" the inspector said in a satisfied tone. "Then there
is nothing to prevent you and me from being friends, is there, Miss
Pirnie? I shall do myself the pleasure of calling in, maybe
to-morrow evening, and bringing you any news there may be."</p>

<p>"I should be glad to hear about Miss Maureen," Pirnie said
primly, but her eyes looked well pleased as they glanced at the
inspector's meagre, lithe form.</p>

<p>They turned out of the restaurant together and made their way
back to the roar of the traffic in Knightsbridge. There Pirnie
stopped.</p>

<p>"I get my bus just here, Mr. Furnival, so I will say good-bye,
and thank you very much," holding out her hand.</p>

<p>The inspector pressed it tenderly.</p>

<p>"I shall only say <i>au revoir</i>. Oh, one moment more. There
is one thing you might tell me and save me a letter to Mr. Soames,
if you would be so kind, Miss Pirnie. There is a quantity of
clothing&mdash;men's clothing&mdash;in a bedroom on the third
floor. It isn't Mr. John Daventry's&mdash;it isn't big enough. I
don't suppose for a moment it has any bearing on the case, but it
is my duty just to ascertain to whom it belongs."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean packed away in the lumber room?" Pirnie said as he
stopped. "They belonged to Mr. Frank&mdash;her ladyship's son, the
youngest, that was killed in the war. Her ladyship used to talk
sometimes of giving them away&mdash;but she could never bring
herself to do so."</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay not!" But the inspector's tone was abstracted. His
eyes were smiling into Pirnie's as he helped her into a bus, his
hand held hers closely, and when he stood back to let other
passengers get in he still watched her and remained watching until
the bus was out of sight. It was little wonder that Pirnie's maiden
heart was fluttering as she made her way to her suburban home.</p>

<p>The inspector walked back across the park. There were heavy
furrows across his brow. His keen gimlet eyes glanced unseeingly at
the faces of the few riders left in the Row. It was evident that
his thoughts were far away. It would have been evident to those who
knew the Ferret best that his mind was busy with some knotty
problem&mdash;that in some way he had been surprised, probably
unexpectedly puzzled.</p>

<p>As he emerged into Bayswater Road near the Lancaster Gate Tube,
he glanced at the news posters of the men outside the station. "The
house in Charlton Crescent," he read. "Curious development."</p>

<p>He scowled at the unlucky vendor as he took a copy of the paper.
As he feared, Maureen's disappearance had somehow become public,
though not all the circumstances. But there was a description of
the missing child.</p>

<p>The inspector's scowl deepened as thrusting the offending paper
deep down in his pocket he set off at a brisk pace for Charlton
Crescent.</p>

<p>As he entered the Crescent the door of Lady Anne's house was
thrown open and Dorothy Fyvert appeared on the steps with Bruce
Cardyn close behind.</p>

<p>It was evident that she had been crying. Her eyes were
red-rimmed, her lips were trembling. She caught the inspector's
arm.</p>

<p>"We have had a message," she cried breathlessly. "Alice has come
home alone and denies all knowledge of Maureen. Oh, inspector, what
has become of my little sister?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows!" said the inspector heavily.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>"And now what does Alice Gray say she has been doing?"</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival was the speaker. He had drawn Miss Fyvert and
Bruce Cardyn back into the hall.</p>

<p>"Your message came from Cuthbertson, I suppose?" He spoke rapidly
over his shoulder to Bruce Cardyn, while Dorothy clung to his hands
as though she derived some subtle comfort from their warm human
contact.</p>

<p>"Cuthbertson," Cardyn assented. "I wired back for particulars.
The answer came just now. Gray got out of the train at Golders
Green and took a bus back to Victoria. Went to Brighton to see her
cousin. Address given&mdash;I am verifying."</p>

<p>At this moment there was an interruption. A car stopped before
the door and a man sprang out, took the steps in his stride, and
hammered at the door.</p>

<p>Cardyn opened it. "Mr. Daventry!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Daventry!" that individual assented, flinging his hat
and motor-goggles on the old oak table and throwing his heavy
fur-lined coat on one of the big chairs. "Now, Dorothy, what is
this I hear? What have you been doing with Maureen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, John! We can't think what has become of her. If we don't
find her I shall go mad."</p>

<p>"Oh, we shall find her safe enough," returned John Daventry in
the loud cheerful voice that never seemed to admit of failure.
"What&mdash;what's this, Dorothy? Crying? Oh, come, I can't have
that. Maureen will turn up right enough, little monkey! Oh, I see
Mr. Detective Furnival can't find her! Well, you know, he hasn't
found the bally blighter who got up to the window and killed Aunt
Anne. But I am going to look for Maureen myself."</p>

<p>The inspector smiled faintly. His eyes watched the young man's
pleasant face with its bronzed ruddy skin, clear blue eyes and the
white teeth that spoke of perfect health. Eminently a clean,
wholesome, desirable-looking young Englishman, but hardly the
material of which a successful sleuth is made.</p>

<p>"I sure hope you will find her, Mr. Daventry," he returned
politely. "It is not always so easy to discover things, you
know."</p>

<p>"Well, I ought to, seeing how often you fail," retorted Daventry
with a grin. "See here, there's that damned Cat Burglar, you can't
find him. You don't know who stabbed Aunt Anne or who stole her
pearls. And now you can't find Maureen. One, two, three, four
failures! You will have to take care it does not become a habit,
Furnival!"</p>

<p>The inspector did not look quite pleased as he turned away.</p>

<p>Daventry glanced at Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I shall go to Alice's home at New Barnet myself. I'll make her
tell me what has become of Maureen, or I will know the reason
why."</p>

<p>"If she knows," Dorothy said with a catch in her breath. "But
suppose she does not? Oh, John, I fancy all sorts of things. It
will drive me mad if all this uncertainty goes on. Oh, when I think
of the horrible cruelties that are inflicted upon
children&mdash;sometimes I ask myself, if it is possible that some
villain has got hold of Maureen&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, but her big eyes as she gazed imploringly
at her cousin held an evergrowing haunting horror.</p>

<p>"No!" thundered Daventry. "Of course it is not possible! Maureen
is safe enough, only up to mischief, I expect. Why, Dorothy, what
puts such horrible thoughts into your head? Don't let yourself even
think of such terrible things. Put them out of your mind."</p>

<p>"If I can," Dorothy said, her voice dropping to the merest
whisper. "But I can't, John. I am haunted&mdash;haunted by the
fear&mdash;the horror of what may have become of her."</p>

<p>"I will find her for you," Daventry promised, touching her hand
lightly. "I am going to motor straight off to Alice. And I will
wring the truth out of her&mdash;I will bring Maureen back."</p>

<p>He stopped as there was another knock at the door. Dorothy
looked vaguely comforted. There was something so reassuring about
John Daventry's power and certainty, that she began to believe that
he would succeed where the detectives had failed.</p>

<p>Daventry and she had been friends from their earliest years,
until the friendship under the pressure of their two families had
merged into the sort of indefinable understanding which to both had
become irksome, and to Dorothy, of late, intolerable. But to-day,
looking at the firm, strong mouth, at the clear, straight eyes,
some of Dorothy's old confidence returned. She tried to smile at
him.</p>

<p>"I am sure you will if anybody can, John."</p>

<p>"That I will!" he said, looking her squarely in the eyes. "There
will be no beating about the bush with the Cat Burglar with me, I
promise you!" He stopped short. "What is that?"</p>

<p>The inspector opened the front door, though none of the others
had heard either bell or knocker. Now he seemed to be carrying on a
colloquy with some one outside.</p>

<p>As John Daventry listened his face changed; the steel-grey eyes
grew softer, the rather hard mouth softened and grew tender.</p>

<p>The voice speaking to the inspector became more distinct. "It
was the only thing I could do, inspector, to bring her to you. Now,
Susan, do not be so foolish! You have nothing to be afraid of if
you speak the truth."</p>

<p>It was Margaret Balmaine speaking. Daventry hurried to the door
just as she entered holding a shivering, weeping figure by the arm.
The inspector followed them and closed the door.</p>

<p>Dorothy uttered a cry of surprise as she recognized the maid
whom she and Margaret shared.</p>

<p>"Why, Susan, what in the world is the matter? Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"No, she is not ill. She is frightened," Margaret Balmaine
answered for her. Miss Balmaine herself was looking curiously
shaken out of her usual composure. In spite of her "make-up" it was
quite evident that her face was very white. Her big,
artificially-darkened eyes were filled with dread. Yet she kept her
hold on the arm of the weeping girl by her side.</p>

<p>"Now, Susan, speak up! I promise you nothing will happen to you
if you tell what you know. Come, dry your eyes and speak out."</p>

<p>Thus adjured, the girl made a desperate attempt to obey.</p>

<p>"It was what I heard them say," she said, between her sobs. "I
couldn't help it&mdash;I wasn't listening."</p>

<p>"No, no! We know that&mdash;none of us think you were," Margaret
Balmaine assured her. "Come, Susan, where were you? Just repeat
what you told me a minute ago."</p>

<p>The inspector watched both girls closely. Not a movement of
either escaped him, but for once the keen ferret eyes looked
puzzled, one might almost have said bewildered. Miss Balmaine
touched the girl's arm again encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Come, Susan!"</p>

<p>At last the girl's sobs stopped. She rolled her wet handkerchief
up into a crumpled ball, and held it in her hot little hand.</p>

<p>"I was sitting doing some needlework in Miss Fyvert's room," she
began, speaking in a controlled almost mechanical voice, "and Miss
Maureen was ill&mdash;stopping in her room, which opened out of
Miss Dorothy's. She did not know I was there, for I heard her
moving about, opening and shutting drawers. And if she had known I
was there she would have spoken, for Miss Maureen was never one to
keep quiet. I didn't want her just then, either, so I kept quiet
too, and was just going to slip out of the room when I heard Alice
begin to speak. 'It's no good, Maureen,' she began&mdash;and that
surprised me, to hear her speak without the "Miss"&mdash;'I mean,
that man has been asking questions again. He will find out
everything and then what will become of us?' I ought to have come
away, I know," Susan's voice became choked with sobs again. She
dabbed her hard little handkerchief in her eyes. "Or else have
spoken out, but I was wondering what they meant, and I stayed and
have been sorry ever since."</p>

<p>Dorothy sprang forward impatiently. "Oh, never mind about that.
What did you hear? Hurry, hurry, girl, for Heaven's sake!"</p>

<p>Susan's sobs redoubled. "I'm being as quick as I can, Miss
Dorothy. It isn't so very easy," she said thickly. "When Alice
said: 'What will become of us?' Miss Maureen began to cry. 'Can
they send us to prison, Alice?' she says, crying all the time like.
Alice, she began to cry too. 'I am sure they can,' she sobs. 'The
thing that I am afraid of is that they will&mdash;leastways they
won't you, because you are too young, but they will maybe hang me,
and that will kill my mother. Oh, dear; oh, dear! what shall I do?'
And she begins to sob again. With that Miss Maureen gives a sharp
cry. 'Oh, Alice! Alice! They&mdash;they mustn't hang us&mdash;nor
put us in prison. If only we could get away, where that horrid,
horrid inspector man could not find us!'"</p>

<p>Susan said the last sentence with a certain zeal that sounded as
if she relished repeating the obnoxious adjectives to the
inspector's face.</p>

<p>"Well! Go on!" John Daventry's voice was harsh and strained.
"What else did you hear?" Susan turned to him with an odd little
bow.</p>

<p>"That was all, Mr. Daventry, sir. Miss Fyvert went into the
room. I heard her speak to Alice about some needlework and slipped
away. I don't know what they were talking about. I couldn't think.
But I didn't bother so much about it until we heard yesterday that
Miss Maureen had disappeared. Then&mdash;then I got frightened and
Miss Balmaine made me tell her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Margaret Balmaine in a cold, determined voice. "I
found Susan crying and could get no explanation at first except
that she was frightened and wanted to leave. At that I suspected that
she must know something. I taxed her with it and after some time
she told me this. Naturally I could not deal with it myself, so I
thought the best thing was to bring her round to you, inspector. I
don't know whether what she knows is any help, whether it may have
bearing on the case, I mean. But it seemed to me you ought to
know."</p>

<p>It struck Bruce Cardyn, looking at him, that the Ferret had a
baffled, puzzled expression absolutely foreign to his keen little
face.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Miss Balmaine," he said politely. "I wish everyone
would be as prompt and sensible. Now, my girl"&mdash;turning to
Susan&mdash;"there is nothing for you to cry about, if you have
told us the whole truth. That was all you heard?"</p>

<p>"Every word, sir," corroborated the weeping Susan.</p>

<p>The inspector opened the door. "Then there is no great purpose
to be served by keeping you. Try to put it out of your mind for the
time being. And above all things do not cry about it."</p>

<p>Susan needed no second bidding. She slipped out of the opened
door with one of those queer, semi-circular little bows of hers,
and made off down the Crescent as fast as her legs could carry
her.</p>

<p>The group of men and women standing in the hall looked at one
another in horrified consternation. At last Dorothy spoke:</p>

<p>"What does it mean? Maureen couldn't have known&mdash;couldn't
have done anything&mdash;about Aunt Anne!"</p>

<p>"Of course she couldn't!" John Daventry said roughly. "Don't be
a fool, Dorothy! Poor little Maureen. The child must have been
scared out of her senses. That is what it means."</p>

<p>But though his tone was decided, his voice gruff almost to
bearishness, his face had turned again that sickly greenish colour,
his grey eyes evaded both the girls. It was curious, too, that the
same tint seemed to have spread from him to Bruce Cardyn, that even
the inspector's usually ruddy colour had faded to a dull grey
hue.</p>

<p>Neither Dorothy nor Margaret could well have been paler. The
silence lasted a minute longer. Then it was broken in an odd way.
Margaret Balmaine laughed aloud, a harsh, grating sound that broke
in her throat in a high choking laugh.</p>

<p>"Fancy Maureen killing Aunt Anne!" she cried, between her
spasms. "Just fancy Maureen or even Alice killing Aunt Anne!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>"No news?" questioned the inspector as Bruce Cardyn hung the
receiver up and turned from the telephone with an exclamation of
impatience.</p>

<p>"No news!" he assented. "Sometimes I think there never will
be."</p>

<p>The inspector's little ferret-like eyes glanced at him keenly
for a moment, then turned back to a parcel he was slowly
unfolding.</p>

<p>"Give us time!" he remarked philosophically. "We shall find it
all out some day. But it is not so easy to put one of those
things&mdash;jig-saw puzzles&mdash;together, if all the important
pieces are in the hands of different people who refuse to give them
up. This case reminds me of that."</p>

<p>"Why?" Cardyn inquired laconically.</p>

<p>"Because nobody&mdash;I say nobody, advisedly&mdash;will speak
the truth about his or her little bit of the puzzle. Now you have
your own little corner which you are trying to get straight. That
little piece of the corner on which you are busy probably dovetails
into some other bit and the two joined together might make a whole
large piece of the puzzle plain. When are you going to speak out,
Mr. Cardyn?"</p>

<p>For a moment Cardyn stared at him in amazement, then a glance of
comprehension flashed into his grey eyes.</p>

<p>"You shall be the first to hear when I know anything definite,
inspector. At present it is only vague surmise and suspicions that
are probably unjustifiable."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said the inspector firmly, "I think we will have
the surmises and the suspicions out in the open, if you
please."</p>

<p>Bruce met his penetrating gaze squarely. "Will you give me an
hour or two? I think&mdash;I hope that by then may have something
definite to tell you."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "Wait till to-night," he said gruffly.
"And now look at these!"</p>

<p>Bruce glanced at the white plaster of Paris objects that were
gradually emerging from their wrappings under Inspector Furnival's
capable fingers.</p>

<p>"Footprints! Those in the border under the window in the hall?"
he questioned.</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival touched them gingerly with the tip of his
finger.</p>

<p>"Ay! Beautifully done, aren't they? You can't beat my man,
Botts, at this sort of thing. Now, what do you make of this, Mr.
Cardyn?"</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn bent over them. "Small size&mdash;eights, I should
say."</p>

<p>"Right! No, Mr. Cardyn, what do you make of them?"</p>

<p>"That the murderer was a man with small feet."</p>

<p>"If he wore them," the inspector said significantly.</p>

<p>Cardyn looked at him. "Who else would be likely to?"</p>

<p>"That is what we are trying to find out," the inspector said
sapiently.</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall each find out what the other means later on,"
the inspector said dryly. "In the meantime may I remind you that
there were three men among the persons in the fatal room. Two of
them Mr. John Daventry and Soames, take the same size of
shoe&mdash;ten. The third&mdash;yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I take nines," Cardyn said quietly. "Though I daresay I might
get into eights. All my shoes are at your disposal. Those in my
rooms as well as the few pairs have here. Probably, however, you
know all that is to be known about them already."</p>

<p>A slight spasm&mdash;was it a smile?&mdash;momentarily
contracted Inspector Furnival's sharp-featured little face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cardyn, I am going to show you a pair of shoes that exactly
fit those footprints." He led the way across the hall and up the
staircase. Past the death chamber on the first floor, past Lady
Anne's bedroom, past those belonging to the two girls, past the one
Bruce had occupied, right up to the servants' quarters on the top
floor went he. Then he unlocked a door Bruce had not seen open
before.</p>

<p>"The lumber-room," he said briefly. "Always kept locked in Lady
Anne's time."</p>

<p>It was a small room. The houses in Charlton Crescent were not
big enough to have much space for lumber-rooms, and it was almost
entirely filled with boxes.</p>

<p>"All locked!" the inspector said, waving his hand
comprehensively around. "Lady Anne believed in safeguarding her
property and her life. It is the very irony of fate."</p>

<p>As he spoke he was unfastening a huge wooden chest that stood
under the window. Inside there appeared to be an unusual and
incongruous collection of things, arranged in no particular order.
Articles of clothing were mingled with books and papers. One corner
was entirely given up to shoes. The inspector put his footprints
down carefully on another box and chose out a pair of shoes. Then
placing them beside the plaster of Paris models, he pointed to
Cardyn. "The shoes that made those prints. See for yourself!"</p>

<p>Bruce compared the two point by point. They fitted exactly. Even
the place where the heel was a little worn down had its counterpart
in the cast. He looked at the inspector.</p>

<p>"No doubt about that! You have the originals safe enough? But
how did they come there?"</p>

<p>"That," said the inspector slowly, "I should very much like to
discover. You know to whom this chest and its contents belonged,
perhaps?" Bruce shook his head. "I have not the least idea."</p>

<p>"To Frank Daventry&mdash;Lady Anne's youngest son," the
inspector said impressively. "When he went out to France he left a
lot of things here. After his death most of them were packed up and
brought here by Lady Anne's orders."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;" Bruce Cardyn looked like a man thoroughly
dazed.</p>

<p>"Ah, how!" the inspector echoed. "Another little piece of the
jig-saw puzzle, Mr. Cardyn. A regular bit of snag too, for you
think that pair of shoes just like the others I suppose?"</p>

<p>Cardyn scrutinized them all round; then he picked up one of the
pair in question and compared it silently with several of the
others. At last he looked up.</p>

<p>"This boot is a little wider than the others. I should say they
were eights with a five fitting. Probably this is an eight with a
six fitting."</p>

<p>"Right!" the inspector said laconically. "Well?"</p>

<p>"I never knew a fellow alter the size of his boots unless he had
an attack of gout&mdash;or something of that sort," Cardyn
observed.</p>

<p>"No." Inspector Furnival put the two of them together. "If you
look you will find that every shoe in that box is made by the same
shoemaker&mdash;except this pair that fit the footprints. They have
inside the name of a well-known firm of American bootmakers in the
Strand&mdash;-John D. Palmer and Co. Now I paid Mr. John D. Palmer a
visit the other day and made a few inquiries. As a result I
discovered that this particular shoe, though to the lay mind it
looks very much like any other, has been on the market only about
twelve months, which naturally precludes the idea of their having
any connexion with Frank Daventry."</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn paled, detective though he was. In that moment he
seemed to realize something of the tortuous, devilish mind they
were up against.</p>

<p>"They must have been put here by the murderer," he said.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. One must look at the thing all round. Some one
may have found them and put them here to shield the real
criminal."</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn did not look convinced. He had taken up the shoes
once more and was examining them with meticulous care, and
comparing them point by point with the plaster of Paris models. The
inspector's keen little eyes followed every movement. At last
Cardyn looked up.</p>

<p>"The impression is much deeper at the toes than at the heels. It
looks to me as if the murderer had sprung out backwards, standing
on his toes while he shut the window behind him, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes! And?" The inspector prompted gently as the younger paused
with a bewildered expression. "The footprints went no farther."</p>

<p>"I know," Bruce assented. "But how the beggar got off has always
been a puzzle to me. Sometimes I have thought that he put down stones
and sprang from one to the other, pulling up the last one as he
took another step."</p>

<p>"Ingenious," said the inspector, "but it won't wash. In the
first place he would have had a large stone on which to balance
himself if he pulled the back one up. In the second, look at the
time he would have wasted, with innumerable opportunities of
detection. Thirdly, why should he take so much trouble to avoid the
soil of the border, when he had already left two well-defined
foot-prints in the most conspicuous place, right under the
window?"</p>

<p>He waited for a reply, but none came. Bruce Cardyn was still
examining the shoes, his brows drawn together in a frown.</p>

<p>The inspector pointed to the toes again. "Curiously deep
impression the toes have made, haven't they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that it is any deeper than one would expect if a
man sprang from the window on to some soil that had been freshly
dug."</p>

<p>The inspector rapped the cast with his pencil. "A man springs
down upon his toes&mdash;granted&mdash;but then he lets himself
down upon his heels&mdash;he doesn't remain standing on his toes.
Now the impressions of the heels are of the slightest. The wearer
of these shoes neither stood firmly on his feet nor turned."</p>

<p>"You mean," said Cardyn slowly, "that the&mdash;the person who
wore those shoes jumped on to the border purposely to make those
impressions, and then got back into the house, wishing to give the
impression that the murderer had left that way."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said the inspector dryly. "I couldn't have put the
case better myself if I had been laying it before the chief
himself."</p>

<p>"The inference being," Bruce went on, his voice controlled as
ever, though a very dangerous look was growing in his eyes, "that
the shoes were worn by someone in the house. Further that as I was
the only one of the three men who could by any possibility get into
the shoes&mdash;I must be the assassin, Inspector Furnival."</p>

<p>The inspector held up his hand.</p>

<p>"Steady, please. You are taking a little bit too much for
granted, Mr. Cardyn. Though those are a man's shoes, that does not
prove that a man wore them when the footprints were made."</p>

<p>"You cannot mean that one of the girls&mdash;" Bruce
uttered.</p>

<p>"It might have been or might not," the inspector said with
judicial calm. "There is nothing inherently impossible in the idea,
as I hope to presently show you. A woman might perfectly easily have
made the footprints, either definitely to turn suspicion from
herself or her lover. Now to come back to business. After an
enormous amount of trouble I have managed to get something from the
shop where these were sold&mdash;a list of the names on the books.
It is not complete, of course, and quite inconclusive since many
people pay ready money for their shoes. But there was one name on
their books and only one that was familiar to me in this case."</p>

<p>The inspector was not often guilty of pausing for effect, but
his hesitation was now dramatic.</p>

<p>No shade of enlightenment came into Cardyn's eyes as far as the
inspector could see.</p>

<p>"What name?" he questioned breathlessly.</p>

<p>"The name," said Inspector Furnival watching the effect of each
word as it dropped from his lips, "was that of your
predecessor&mdash;David Branksome!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>"Twenty-five Todmorden Lane, Ryston, N."</p>

<p>Even with his extensive knowledge of London and its suburbs the
above address had puzzled Inspector Furnival. At last, however, he
had found Todmorden Lane, tucked away between two of the
better-known streets. Just as he turned into it a car stopped
behind him and a familiar voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, Inspector Furnival, I declare! On the same errand as
myself, I dare bet!"</p>

<p>The inspector did not look too pleased.</p>

<p>"I thought you were here yesterday, Mr. Daventry."</p>

<p>"So I was," John Daventry returned, with a scowl that sat ill
upon his pleasant, open face. "But Alice was out&mdash;slipped out
by the back door as I came up to the front, I expect."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, she won't do that to-day&mdash;not unseen, anyway,"
the inspector said grimly. "My man&mdash;Cuthbertson&mdash;is
watching the house."</p>

<p>"Pity he wasn't yesterday," John Daventry growled.</p>

<p>"I expect he was," the inspector said placidly. "Probably when
she went out of the back door he shadowed her. To-day, however, if
she is not at home we shall soon find her."</p>

<p>Number twenty-five was not the cleanest of the houses in
Todmorden Lane; there were the usual Nottingham lace curtains over
the front window, drawn back to show the aspidistra between, but
the steps and the door-knocker looked neglected, the dingy curtains
could not disguise the dirtiness of the windows.</p>

<p>Mr. Daventry seized the knocker and banged it loudly.</p>

<p>"If you wished to frighten our prey," the inspector said mildly,
"you could hardly go a better way to do it."</p>

<p>"I do mean to frighten the truth out of her," John Daventry
muttered between his teeth.</p>

<p>"It isn't always the truth you frighten out of people," the
inspector said wisely.</p>

<p>John Daventry did not answer. His knock at the door had brought
a speedy response.</p>

<p>In curious contrast with John Daventry's vigorous assault upon
it, the door was opened just a little way slowly and very
noiselessly, and a woman looked out&mdash;a little drab-coloured
woman with hair already going grey, though she was only old with
that pathetic early age of the hardworked and the very poor.</p>

<p>As she saw John Daventry who stood well in front of the
inspector she uttered a low cry. "Oh dear! Oh dear!" She tried to
close the door again but Daventry had got his foot inside.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Grey, is that daughter of yours at home to-day?"</p>

<p>The woman shrank back and, realizing the uselessness of
resistance let the door slip from her grasp. "Oh dear! Oh
dear!"</p>

<p>"Is she at home, I ask?" pursued John Daventry, pushing his foot
forward until he could insert his knee and push the door and Mrs.
Gray back together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray threw her apron over her face and began to weep
noisily. The inspector followed Daventry into the narrow entry,
called by courtesy a hall, as Mrs. Gray fell back against the
wall.</p>

<p>"Leave this to me, Mr. Daventry," he said authoritatively. "Mrs.
Gray, your daughter has nothing to fear from us if she will just
answer a few questions quietly."</p>

<p>"She don't know nothing of what Miss Maureen done," wailed Mrs.
Gray inconsequently.</p>

<p>"Well, she has only to tell us so," the inspector said politely.
"Ah, there you are!" as through a half-open door on the right he
caught sight of a tall white-faced girl supporting herself by her
hand against the table. "Now, now, don't alarm yourself"&mdash;as
the girl began to shake visibly and to look on the verge of
collapse&mdash;"we just want to know what you did at Brighton the
other day."</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;I didn't do anything!" the girl muttered
sullenly. But though she answered Furnival it was at Daventry she
was glancing with frightened eyes. What importance had any
policeman in the world to her compared with Mr. Daventry?</p>

<p>John Daventry answered the glance.</p>

<p>"Tell us where Maureen is," he said thickly. "We know that you
took her to Brighton with you. You have both been traced there;
where is she now?"</p>

<p>The girl threw out her hands. "I don't know, I wish to Heaven I
did!"</p>

<p>She flung herself down on a wooden chair beside her and burst
into loud suffocating sobs. The anger in John Daventry's usually
good-tempered face deepened.</p>

<p>"What have you done with her?" he demanded. "Where is she now?
When did you leave her? Speak the truth now or by the Lord in
Heaven I will wring your blasted neck for you!"</p>

<p>He seemed to have forgotten Furnival's presence, and that
functionary elected to remain an inactive spectator, though to
those who knew the Ferret it would have been obvious that eyes and
ears were alike vigilantly on the alert.</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;know," she said, the words coming out between
bursts of sobbing. "I couldn't tell you any more, sir, not if you
was to murder me, and&mdash;and I shouldn't mind if you did!"</p>

<p>John Daventry glared at her. Assuredly, had she been a man, he
would have been as good as his word. He would have taken her by the
throat and shaken the truth out of her.</p>

<p>As it was, standing over her, he looked so big and strong, so
thoroughly capable of carrying out his threat, that he literally
frightened her into speech. "Where did you last see her?" he
thundered. Alice lifted her tear-stained face. "On the front at
Brighton, sir. I only took my eyes off her one minute, and the next
she was gone. I searched for her everywhere for hours, but not a
trace of her could I find. That is God's truth, Mr. Daventry, sir.
And I couldn't tell you any more&mdash;not if you were to hang me
for it."</p>

<p>John Daventry stared at her. "Do you mean to say&mdash;"</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival put him quietly aside. "No one is likely to
hang you, my good girl, or to try to punish you in any way. We only
want to find the child for her sister's sake. She said 'Alice will
tell you all she knows if you say how anxious I am! I always liked
Alice&mdash;she was a good girl&mdash;and I think she liked me,"
finished the inspector, improvising as he went on.</p>

<p>"Which I always did," Alice sobbed. "We all did. And I would
never have taken Miss Maureen to Brighton, if I had thought of such
a thing happening. But Miss Maureen, she had set her heart on going
and she gave me no peace."</p>

<p>"I see." The inspector's voice grew gentle. "We quite realize
that you are not to blame. But, now, will you tell me just what
happened? Begin at the very beginning."</p>

<p>John Daventry opened his mouth as though he were going to
intervene at this juncture, but a warning gesture from the
inspector checked him and he remained with his mouth slightly open,
staring at them.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I met Miss Maureen at the junction," said Alice,
beginning to speak a little more clearly. "And&mdash;and we went
back to town and then changed to Victoria and came to Brighton. My
cousin had some rooms to let and we meant to stay there for a time.
But we put our luggage in the cloak-room and went for a walk along
the front first. Miss Maureen was that pleased to get away
from&mdash;from the house in Charlton Crescent that she was dancing
about all excited like. But I was tired, we had had to do a lot
before we left, but speak to Miss Maureen as I might she wouldn't
be quiet. There were some children dancing about to an organ that
an old woman was playing and Miss Maureen went and danced with
them. I asked her not to go, but it was no good."</p>

<p>John Daventry nodded his head. He knew Maureen only too well in
this mood and quite realized that Alice could have had no easy
task.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;I think I must have dozed a minute," the girl
went on. "I had been up early in the morning and was tired, but it
was only a minute. Miss Maureen was then jumping about like
anything when I closed my eyes. When I opened them again not a bit
of her could I see. They told me afterwards that I rushed about
like a wild woman. The old woman was still there with her organ,
and the children were dancing about. There didn't seem to be any
difference except that Miss Maureen was not there."</p>

<p>"What happened next?" the inspector questioned in that new
tonelessly gentle voice of his. "What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Do!" Alice Gray echoed. "I ran up and down Brighton streets
looking here, there and everywhere I thought the child might have
got to. I just ran till I was ready to drop, and then went to my
cousin's. There didn't seem anything else to be done."</p>

<p>"It did not strike you that the proper thing to do was to go to
the police station and report the child's disappearance?" the
inspector said quietly.</p>

<p>Alice stared at him. "No! No! I couldn't do that," she wailed.
"I couldn't do anything. I just came home and waited."</p>

<p>"If you had gone to the police they would have probably found
her in half an hour," said the inspector quietly. "Now, however, it
is no use crying over spilt milk."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that there is no more to be done?" John Daventry
demanded.</p>

<p>The inspector shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Not at present, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Daventry made no rejoinder, but his frown was ominous. Alice
looked relieved. The inspector's eyes did not miss one shade of her
expression.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be done but to set all the resources of
Scotland Yard to work to find the child." He turned to John
Daventry and said a few words in an undertone. Then he looked back
at Alice.</p>

<p>"Why did you take the child to Brighton?" he asked sharply. "Why
did you want to hide yourselves?"</p>

<p>Alice's hands dropped on her lap. Every vestige of colour faded
from her face. In the silence that followed you could fancy you
could hear her heart beating.</p>

<p>"Hide ourselves!" she breathed at last. "We&mdash;we didn't want
to hide ourselves. Miss&mdash;Miss Maureen wanted to see
Brighton."</p>

<p>"Stop!" The inspector's tones had altered to sternness. "We know
that you were frightened, that you were both frightened, that there
was something in connexion with Lady Anne's&mdash;death! Ah!"</p>

<p>He sprang forward as he spoke and caught the girl just as she
reeled off the chair in a dead faint.</p>

<p>The inspector laid her on the rough couch at the end of the
window. Then glancing round the room he caught up a glass of water
and dashed it into the girl's face. It had the instant effect of
bringing back her senses. She sat up and brushed back the wet hair
from her face.</p>

<p>"You said that if I told you about Miss Maureen that was
all&mdash;all!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"If you told me the whole truth," the inspector said
significantly. "Think again, my girl. The whole truth if you
please."</p>

<p>But Alice was lying back in her chair ready to faint again. "The
truth! the truth!" she murmured. "I have told you the truth."</p>

<p>"The whole truth," the inspector corrected.</p>

<p>Alice scarcely seemed to hear him. She was murmuring: "The
truth! the truth!" to herself.</p>

<p>The inspector shrugged his shoulders as he glanced across at
John Daventry. "We shall do no more good here to-day, Mr. Daventry.
It is sheer waste of time."</p>

<p>John Daventry muttered a sulky assent, and the two men turned
away. At the front door which Mrs. Gray was still holding open in a
dreary, senseless fashion, the inspector waited to allow John
Daventry to precede him. Then with a muttered word of apology he
returned swiftly to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Alice sat up with a startled cry as he stepped quickly to her
side.</p>

<p>"When you are thinking over what you will say to me, the next
time&mdash;don't forget the connexion with the Cat Burglar," he
said suggestively.</p>

<p>Then he turned away from her as quickly as he had come in. As he
did so he cannoned into John Daventry who had followed him. But the
inspector did not stop. With another apology he hurried out of the
house.</p>

<p>With his quick stride John Daventry caught him up on the narrow
pavement outside. "I heard you!" he said hoarsely. "I heard you
just now."</p>

<p>In one swift glance the inspector saw that the ruddy colour had
faded from the young man's face&mdash;that beneath its tan it had
turned grey and cold.</p>

<p>"Heard me just now?" he questioned blandly.</p>

<p>"Yes! Heard you!" John Daventry repeated. "What did you mean?
You asked about the Cat Burglar."</p>

<p>The inspector turned and looked him full in the face, an odd
expression gleaming for a moment in the sharp little eyes.</p>

<p>"What does she know about the Cat Burglar?" he repeated. "Well,
I am inclined to think that she knows more about the Cat Burglar
than anyone, Mr. Daventry."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" John Daventry's utterance became choked.
The big veins in his forehead stood out like whipcord. His face
swelled, but he did not turn red, instead its sickly grey tint
became more pronounced against the tan of his skin. He put up one
big hand and wrenched at his collar as though he were stifling.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" he gasped incoherently. "If&mdash;if you
know that she knows all about the Cat Burglar&mdash;then you must
know about him too."</p>

<p>The inspector raised his eyebrows. "Not necessarily!
But&mdash;supposing that I do know something. Have you never had
any suspicion, Mr. Daventry?"</p>

<p>"Never, so help me Heaven!" John Daventry asseverated
thickly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>"No news?"</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn shook his head. "Not so far. The inspector may be
back any moment."</p>

<p>"He would have phoned through if he had had any good news,"
Dorothy Fyvert said miserably. "And if he cannot make Alice speak
no one can."</p>

<p>"Mr. John Daventry may possibly," Cardyn suggested.</p>

<p>"He won't," Dorothy said in a mildly contemptuous voice. "John
will bluster and rage, but he will never get the truth out of
Alice."</p>

<p>"Suppose the truth has already been told?" Bruce Cardyn
suggested. He was looking grave and tired. His eyes were red-rimmed
and had an extinguished look&mdash;the sort of look that comes to a
man who has been sitting up several nights in succession. Lady Anne
Daventry's death was taking heavy toll of those who were engaged in
trying to probe the secret of it.</p>

<p>Dorothy herself was looking wretchedly ill. This terrible
anxiety about Maureen coming on the top of the horror of her aunt's
death had turned the bright healthy girl who came home with the
Barminsters to the house in Charlton Crescent into a mere nervous
wreck. She had not been to bed, she had not taken off her clothes
since she heard that her sister was missing, and she spent her
whole time walking, backwards and forwards, up and down the
streets. She firmly believed that Maureen would come or be brought
to her in those same streets. Sometimes Margaret Balmaine was with
her&mdash;sometimes Susan. More often she was alone.</p>

<p>It went to the heart of the man who loved her to see her as she
was now. Her bright fair hair looked disordered and dull under a
hat thrust on anyhow. Her brown eyes were bloodshot from much
weeping and had great dark half-circles beneath them. The clear
tones of her complexion were blurred and her face itself looked
sodden and swollen. Her usually soft red lips were cracked and
discoloured and every now and then they twitched uncontrollably.
But Dorothy cared nothing about her appearance. She could think of
nothing but Maureen&mdash;Maureen whom her imagination pictured in
more and more terrible straits as the hours went on.</p>

<p>She had just paused in her endless pacing of the streets to call
at the house in Charlton Crescent to see whether there was any news
of Maureen.</p>

<p>It was the day of the inspector and John Daventry's visit to
Todmorden Lane, and Bruce Cardyn was at Lady Anne's house to meet
the inspector.</p>

<p>"How do you mean&mdash;that Alice has told the truth?" Dorothy
questioned feverishly.</p>

<p>"Well, I am inclined to think that, when she says she does not
know where the child is, she is speaking the truth," he said
slowly.</p>

<p>"But if she does not, where on earth can Maureen be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Bruce said in a strangely abstracted tone. "But
we are bound to know soon," he added.</p>

<p>He was still holding the door open. Dorothy had come into the
hall and was standing with her back to it. He watched the outgoings
and the incomings in the Crescent with the same abstracted look. A
motor came whizzing up to the next door. For a moment Bruce thought
that one of the two men in it was the inspector, then he saw that
both were strangers. An organ-grinder was playing a melancholy
ditty outside the Crescent; a little beggar boy came round from the
other side and sat down on the first doorstep, leaning his head
against the doorpost.</p>

<p>"I don't know that we are bound to know soon," Dorothy
contradicted. "I heard the other day&mdash;somebody told me in a
shop where I was making inquiries&mdash;that a mother sent her
child to school as usual one day in a little country town. She
stood on the doorstep to watch her as far as she could. It was only
a little way to the school, such a very little way that there was
only one field with a footpath running right through it that was
really out of the mother's sight until the child came out in the
village street. The child turned to wave her hand to her mother
before she went through the handgate, and from that day to this
neither word nor sign has come from her. She disappeared as
completely and utterly as though the earth had swallowed her up.
The villagers went out in bands to search for her. Scotland Yard
sent down detectives and of course the local police were very busy
from the first, but not the smallest trace of her could any of them
discover&mdash;or has ever been discovered. Mr. Cardyn, do you
wonder that the poor mother went mad&mdash;that to this day she is
confined in a lunatic asylum and that she spends all her days in
trying to find something? She does not know what, fortunately. The
memory of her little child has a good deal faded, only she knows
that it is a very precious thing that she looks for constantly. Mr.
Cardyn, suppose we never find Maureen&mdash;we never know what has
become of her?" And Dorothy shook from head to foot as she
spoke.</p>

<p>"I refuse to imagine anything so appalling," Bruce Cardyn said
at once.</p>

<p>But it seemed to Dorothy Fyvert that his manner had
altered&mdash;that some assurance had gone from him, that he was
trying to evade her questions. His eyes did not meet hers, instead
they looked away from her down the Crescent, and a terrible fear
gripped her. Suppose he suspected something&mdash;suppose he
knew&mdash;something! Her very heart seemed to turn cold within
her, to stay its beating as she watched his averted face. In a
sudden accession of overwhelming terror she seized his arm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cardyn, you do know something&mdash;you are keeping
something from me. Tell me&mdash;tell me, anything&mdash;any
certainty must be better than this awful suspense."</p>

<p>Cardyn did not answer for a moment. He did not turn his head or
glance at her, he even drew his arm gently away.</p>

<p>"I do not know anything," he said slowly in a muffled tone that
was curiously unlike anything Dorothy had heard from him before.
"But I wonder&mdash;I expect I am quite wrong&mdash;I dare say I am
going crazy&mdash;"</p>

<p>He moved slowly down the steps as he spoke, walking almost like
a man in a dream. After a second's hesitation Dorothy followed him.
She could not imagine what had caused the sudden change in his
manner. There appeared to be nothing to account for it. The thought
occurred to her that his mind had become unbalanced owing to the
worry and the difficulties in connexion with Lady Anne's death.</p>

<p>The mode of his progression along the Crescent struck her as
extraordinarily peculiar. He went forward a few steps, then
stopped, then went forward again; once he turned his head and,
seeing her behind him, seemed to hesitate for a moment, then went
on more quickly, almost, thought Dorothy, as though he wanted to
shake her off.</p>

<p>In spite of her all-absorbing anxiety the girl felt a curious
little pang of pain. Then at last a strange thing happened. He
hurried forward with a cry&mdash;Dorothy could not catch the words,
but something about him, some cadence set her heart beating
violently. She too sprang forward.</p>

<p>Bruce was stooping forward over the little beggar boy on the
steps, then before Dorothy could catch him he had lifted the child
tenderly in his arms and turned.</p>

<p>"Safe at last, Miss Dorothy," he said with a wry smile as the
girl came up to him.</p>

<p>Dorothy could not believe the evidence of her own eyes and ears
as she gazed at the limp figure lying in Cardyn's arms. Could it
indeed be Maureen&mdash;Maureen, her bright little butterfly
sister? Maureen in ragged coat and knickers, her pretty hair jagged
round her forehead, her face dirty and tear-stained, her hands
blackened and bleeding, her bare feet showing through her tattered
shoes and stockings&mdash;but still, Maureen! With a half
incredulous sound of joy Dorothy stretched out her arms.</p>

<p>Cardyn shook his head.</p>

<p>"She is too heavy for you. And&mdash;I think she is ill. I do
not believe that she is quite conscious. I will carry her into the
hall, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dorothy uttered no further remonstrance. One glance at the
fever-bright eyes that met hers unseeingly had filled her with an
awful foreboding.</p>

<p>Cardyn went straight through the hall into the library and laid
his burden down on the big sofa near the window; Dorothy knelt down
and took the hot, dirty little hands in hers.</p>

<p>"Maureen&mdash;Maureen, darling, don't you know Dorothy?"</p>

<p>The blue fevered eyes focussed themselves on her face; a faint
gleam of recognition dawned in them. The child tried to raise
herself.</p>

<p>"Dor-othy," she said brokenly.</p>

<p>With a cry of joy Dorothy kissed the poor cracked lips.</p>

<p>But in another second Maureen had turned from her, had torn her
hands from her sister's and apparently was fighting to keep off
imaginary enemies with all her small strength.</p>

<p>Dorothy's eyes were full of a piteous appeal as she looked up at
Cardyn. Then with a supreme effort she pulled herself together. She
placed pillows under the child's head and laid her back gently on
them and opened the window at her head.</p>

<p>"Please ring Dr. Spencer up and tell him to come at once," she
said to Bruce. "And then to the hotel&mdash;to Margaret. They must
get rooms ready. I know Dr. Spencer will say that Maureen must not
stay here. It is this horrible, horrible house that is killing
her!"</p>

<p>While Bruce was obeying her she got warm water and gently
sponged the grime from the child's face and neck and arms, and took
off her ragged garments, replacing them with a quilted
dressing-gown of her own. For a time Maureen seemed more
comfortable, but very soon she began to toss about again, to beat
aimlessly on the air. She caught at Dorothy's skirt as she
passed.</p>

<p>"Do you know who I am?" she asked in a harsh cracked voice
absolutely unlike her own.</p>

<p>Dorothy touched the outstretched hand gently. "You are Maureen,
my dear little sister," she said tenderly. "And I want you to lie
still and go to sleep, just to please me."</p>

<p>But Maureen was past heeding her. She pushed her sister's hand
away.</p>

<p>"I am not your little sister," she said in her high-pitched
cracked child's voice. "I am not anybody's little sister. I
am&mdash;shall I tell you what I am?&mdash;I am&mdash;only you must
not tell anybody"&mdash;her voice dropping to a whisper so that
they could scarcely hear&mdash;"because if you did they would
perhaps hang me. I am"&mdash;in a hoarse strained tone&mdash;"the
Cat Burglar!"</p>

<p>Dorothy gave a cry of horror.</p>

<p>"Maureen, darling, you must not."</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn touched her. "Don't contradict her. She is
wandering, poor child. She has heard so much of the murder and the
Cat Burglar that it is haunting her brain."</p>

<p>At this moment the long-expected motor drove up to the door and
the inspector and John Daventry got out. The Ferret was looking as
imperturbable as ever. Daventry's face was as black as thunder.</p>

<p>"No use!" he said as Cardyn came into the hall. "Couldn't get a
word out of the girl, do what we would."</p>

<p>"She is here," Cardyn said quietly.</p>

<p>"Who is here?" John Daventry questioned, staring at him.</p>

<p>"The child&mdash;Maureen."</p>

<p>John Daventry sat down heavily on the nearest chair. "How did
she come?" he questioned helplessly. "Who found her?"</p>

<p>Cardyn smiled faintly. "I may say she found herself. She was
sitting on a doorstep lower down the Crescent, disguised as a
beggar boy."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" ejaculated John Daventry, staring at him. "Of all
the extraordinary things! Inspector, what is going to happen next
in this case of yours?"</p>

<p>"The arrest of the criminal, I hope," Inspector Furnival answered
as he came forward, his face very stern and his eyes watching
Cardyn's face carefully.</p>

<p>At the same moment Dr. Spencer walked into the hall.</p>

<p>"What is this I'm told? Little Miss Maureen found?"</p>

<p>Hearing his voice Dorothy came out of the library.</p>

<p>"Maureen is here, Dr. Spencer. But she is dreadfully ill. I
don't think she even knows us, and she keeps on telling me that she
is not Maureen&mdash;that she is the Cat Burglar! You must save her
for me, doctor!"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! my dear!" the doctor said, patting her arm
paternally. "Children are up and down. I expect Maureen is
over-tired and probably overexcited by what she has gone through.
We shall soon have her about again." He hurried after her into the
library.</p>

<p>The three men left in the hall stood and looked at each other.
Daventry was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Let me catch the ruffians who stole little Maureen away, and by
the Lord above will strangle every mother's son of them. I will
offer a big reward for every one who can give any information about
them. How much shall it be, inspector? Five thousand?"</p>

<p>"Too much!" the inspector said laconically. "I think we shall
clear the matter up for you in a day or two without a reward. The
reward offered for the discovery of Lady Anne's murderer or
murderers did not do much!</p>

<p>"No! And you did not do much, either," retorted John Daventry.
"I wouldn't mention that if were you, inspector."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, when we have found that mystery out and made
<i>one</i> arrest I dare say you will be as much surprised as
anyone, Mr. Daventry," said the inspector placidly.</p>

<p>"I shall be surprised if you arrest anyone, right or wrong, for
my part!" John Daventry said. "Nice useful sort of lot you Scotland
Yard men are!"</p>

<p>At this juncture Dr. Spencer came out of the library.</p>

<p>"I have phoned for an ambulance and nurses, Mr.
Daventry&mdash;most convenient arrangement having the telephone in
the library&mdash;the child must be taken to a nursing home without
delay."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with her?" John Daventry asked bluntly.</p>

<p>The doctor regarded him over the top of his spectacles.</p>

<p>"Shock and exposure," he said briefly. "She will require great
care for some time. I am having her moved to a nursing home close
at hand. The sooner she is out of this house the better."</p>

<p>"Is she talking about the Cat Burglar?" John Daventry
pursued.</p>

<p>"Yes! She is quite upsetting her sister," the doctor answered.
"But my dear Mr. Daventry, it is worse than useless to talk about
the wanderings of a sick child. Once away from here she will be
better. No doubt she has heard people talking about the Cat
Burglar, and her disordered imagination has fastened upon the idea.
As for there being any relation in it to facts, the very notion is
ridiculous. But there is one person I should like to see punished,
inspector"&mdash;raising his voice for that gentleman's
benefit&mdash;"and that is that housemaid, Alice."</p>

<p>"There I am with you, doctor," John Daventry joined in
vigorously. "Girl deserves hanging."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Soames! Lovely morning isn't it?"</p>

<p>The Daventry Arms, a picturesque black and white timbered inn,
stood facing the village green. Opposite the inn door, between it
and the pond where there would be water lilies later and where
to-day the ducks were swimming lazily in the sunshine, there stood
a very old yew tree with wooden seats round its gigantic trunk.
Tradition had it that the second Charles had rested there when
escaping from the soldiers of the Commonwealth. To-day a couple of
old gaffers sat there smoking their pipes and exchanging remarks
about the weather and the state of the crops with the landlord of
the Daventry Arms.</p>

<p>That gentleman turned suddenly and his jaw dropped when he saw
who his interlocutor was.</p>

<p>"This is a pleasure I had almost given up hoping for, Mr.
Inspector, sir!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it hadn't left my mind that I promised to give you a call
if I came this way," the inspector said easily. "And here I am, you
see! And I'm sure it's a pleasure to see you in all your glory as
the landlord of the Daventry Arms, Mr. Soames."</p>

<p>"Acting landlord, inspector," Soames corrected. "We haven't been
getting on quite so quickly as you expected."</p>

<p>"You haven't indeed?" said the inspector. "But how is it, Mr.
Soames? I thought that Mr. Daventry had promised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. John is doing everything he can for me, sir; he is backing
me, and I don't think there is any doubt that the licence will be
transferred to me at the next sessions. Only you see it isn't done
yet. So I'm just having a preliminary canter, so to speak, until
the licence of the Daventry Arms really stands in my name."</p>

<p>"I see." Inspector Furnival took out a large handkerchief and
rubbed his forehead. "I see. It is astonishing how hot trudging
along your country roads makes a man, and I have walked up from the
station, for there was no sort of conveyance to be had. I hope you
can give me a bite of lunch, Mr. Soames! I have heard great things
of what the Daventry Arms can do in the culinary line."</p>

<p>"Have you really, sir? Well, how would a slice of cold beef with
a salad suit you? And a bit of real Stilton to wind up? Or if you
would care to wait there will be a couple of spring chickens and a
slice of Yorkshire ham&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think I will have the beef and Stilton," decided the
inspector. "It will be ready quicker and there is no doubt that
your country air gives one an appetite. And a glass of your best
ale, Mr. Soames."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And you will find that it can't be beaten. If you
will come with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inspector followed him into a big comfortable room
overlooking an old-fashioned garden. It struck him that Soames was
looking decidedly older and thinner in spite of the fresh air.
There was even less of the traditional portliness of the country
landlord about him now than when he left Charlton Crescent. He
himself brought in the ale for which the inspector had asked, and
then began to lay the table in methodical fashion.</p>

<p>"And how do you like being back in your native place, Mr.
Soames?" the inspector inquired. "It is your native place, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! I was born in a cottage in the wood over yonder,"
pointing through the window to where beyond the garden there
stretched an apparently endless vista of tree-tops. "My father was
head gamekeeper to the late Squire Daventry and his father before
him and my mother was maid to his mother&mdash;the Lady Elizabeth
Brand she was before she married him."</p>

<p>"A good family record," commented the inspector. "Your family
and the Daventry family have been connected for years and attached,
I take it?"</p>

<p>Soames's eyelids flickered. "I should hardly presume to say
that, sir. Though I hope we have been faithful servants."</p>

<p>"I am sure you have," the inspector said heartily. "You went
straight into service at the Keep as soon as you left school, eh?
Mr John Daventry was telling me"&mdash;improvising a little.</p>

<p>"Not quite, sir," Soames took up his tray and paused near the
door. "When I first left school, I went for a time to a cousin of
my mother's, a chemist up Islington way, but I couldn't stand the
shop life and the stuffiness of London after the fresh air of
Daventry. Then for a bit I was in the garden at the Keep. But I had
no real bent that way, and when there was an opening for a boy up
at the Keep, I took it and thought myself lucky. There I have been
ever since, second footman, first footman, then butler. At the Keep
I might have been now, but for her late ladyship deciding to live
in London entirely when Mr. Christopher and Mr. Frank died, and Mr.
John not having the means to keep up a proper establishment at the
Keep, besides having their own servants."</p>

<p>It was a long speech for the ex-butler, and at its conclusion he
glanced obliquely at the detective.</p>

<p>Inspector Furnival did not appear to be looking at him, however.
He was admiring the old-fashioned flowers in the herbaceous border
under the window.</p>

<p>"Very sweet they are!" he said, sniffing. "None of your
new-fangled begonias and things will ever come up to what we
remember in the old garden at home, Mr. Soames. Green roses are the
last thing they tell me, but give me an old-fashioned moss rose or
a cabbage before all the green roses that ever were blown!"</p>

<p>"I agree with you, sir," Soames said as he opened the door.
"Old-fashioned flowers and old-fashioned ways are the best in my
opinion."</p>

<p>"There I am with you; and so was Lady Anne, wasn't she?" the
inspector questioned, turning sharply.</p>

<p>Soames put his tray on a table near the door. "Yes. My lady
always liked things best as they were in Queen Victoria's days. I
must see after the cheese myself, sir. The Stilton I don't allow
anyone else to touch."</p>

<p>"No hurry!" said the inspector genially. "I want a bit of a chat
with you first, Mr. Soames. It will give a fillip to my
appetite."</p>

<p>Though the words were spoken smoothly enough and though they
were accompanied by a smile that showed the inspector's somewhat
yellow teeth, there was an underlying note of authority.</p>

<p>Soames's ears were sharp enough to recognize it. He paused with
his hand on the door-handle.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Of course I always enjoy a chat myself," he said with
an obvious difficulty in keeping his voice steady.</p>

<p>"I saw your friend, Miss Pirnie, the other day," the inspector
began.</p>

<p>The relief in Soames's expression was obvious.</p>

<p>"Did you, sir? I hope she was looking well? I have not heard of
her for some little time. In fact I was thinking of running up to
town as soon as I could spare a day, to see how things were going
with her."</p>

<p>"She is looking first-rate," said the inspector. "I was talking
to her about Lady Anne's pearls. I don't know whether you are aware
that there is a rumour, growing stronger every day, that Lady Anne
herself sold her pearls to Spagnum's? Miss Pirnie was very
indignant about it."</p>

<p>"And I don't wonder," said Soames, his face turning red with
anger. "My lady would never have done a thing of that kind. She was
far too proud. If she had wanted to sell her pearls she would have
done so. But she would never have pretended they had been stolen!
If you had known her ladyship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Soames," said the detective sharply, "who did take the
pearls?"</p>

<p>Soames met his eyes steadily enough. "I don't know, sir. I have
never been able to guess. It has been the thing that has puzzled me
the most of everything in the whole affair&mdash;who could have
taken my lady's pearls."</p>

<p>For a moment Inspector Furnival did not speak. His small grey
eyes focused themselves on Soames, held the unfortunate ex-butler's
gaze as a snake's does a bird's. At last he said very deliberately
with a pause between each word:</p>

<p>"Does it puzzle you, for instance, more than this question: Who
killed Lady Anne Daventry?"</p>

<p>The unhappy Soames lost his usually florid colouring as if by a
stroke, his face turned a dull, ashy white; the cheeks a little
while ago so plump and rosy looked now in the clear midday light
pendulous and yellow.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;oh&mdash;sir&mdash;" he stammered thickly.</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes still kept their cruel watch, probing,
searching as though they would wring the truth out of the soul of
the unhappy man before him. No answer came to his question, only
that gibbering, moaning, stammering. Then as suddenly as it had
begun the inspector's scrutiny stopped. He looked away from the
almost convulsed face of the man before him, and drank in a long
draught of the pure air coming in from the outside.</p>

<p>Released, Soames dropped heavily into the nearest chair; after
staring at the inspector for a moment, he began to breathe in
hoarse, painful gasps, wiping the sweat from his brow as he did
so.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know&mdash;what you mean," he said at last,
recovering himself somewhat.</p>

<p>The inspector looked back at him with a benevolent smile.</p>

<p>"Mean?" he echoed. "Mean, my dear Mr. Soames? I think it is I
who should put that question to you. I mean just what I said. It
did occur to me as curious that with all the mystery surrounding
the death of Lady Anne Daventry you should say that the thing that
puzzled you the most was the theft of Lady Anne's pearls! Now of
the minor puzzles of the affair I find the disappearance of the
pearls the least baffling."</p>

<p>Soames was sitting now facing the inspector and still breathing
grampus-fashion, one hand firmly planted on each knee. Very
gradually the colour was coming back to his face; it was far from
reaching its usual rubicund proportions, but the ghastly pallor
that had been called up by the inspector's question had passed. He
looked up now in obviously genuine surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you know who it was took them, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ah! That would be telling," the inspector said with the same
open smile. "You will soon know how, Mr. Soames. Things are moving
rapidly to a climax, and all the world will be told the secret of
the house in Charlton Crescent before long. But what I want to know
now is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused dramatically.</p>

<p>The colour that was stealing back to Soames's face began to ebb
slowly away again. He sat gazing at the inspector in an odd,
frightened fashion.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes? What you want to know is&mdash;-?" he prompted.</p>

<p>The inspector took out a cigar case. "Smoking is not forbidden
here? No? Then you will try one of these, Mr. Soames. They were
given me by a grateful client. Very good they are. You won't? Oh,
well perhaps, you are wise&mdash;before lunch. Yes. What I should
like to know above all things at this present moment is, who made
the footmarks on the border under the window? The window you found
open, you will remember, Mr. Soames?"</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Soames did remember. This time his face
did not turn white. He became instead a curious mottled purple.</p>

<p>"I suppose the murderer must have been concealed in the house
and managed to get out that way. I have always thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! I see you have decided that the murderer was not one of the
five, as some people call them?" the inspector said in a chaffing
tone that seemed to affect Soames more than his previous
sternness.</p>

<p>The butler glared round wildly as if seeking some way of
escape.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it doesn't seem possible that it could be, sir."</p>

<p>"It doesn't, does it?" the inspector went on chattily. "Yet the
murderer must have been some one in the house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Concealed in the house," Soames muttered.</p>

<p>"I scarcely think so," said the inspector, taking a seat on the
table near the unhappy man. "At least if he made the footmarks in
the border he must have been in the house afterwards,
because&mdash;"</p>

<p>He made another of his telling pauses. Soames wriggled uneasily
in a fashion irresistibly suggestive of the toad under the
harrow.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;or perhaps I had better say," the inspector
corrected, "that at any rate if he got out of the house himself he
left his boots behind him. They have been found upstairs among some
of the things left by Lady Anne's son Frank."</p>

<p>Soames stared at him helplessly. Twice he opened his mouth as if
to speak and closed it again fishwise. At last he said thickly:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Frank&mdash;he could not have worn the boots, and Mr.
John and me&mdash;we couldn't have got them on to save our lives. I
don't believe there was a man in the house that could."</p>

<p>"I dare say not," the inspector acquiesced blandly, his small
ferret eyes fixed upon the ex-butler's twitching face. "But then
you see, Mr. Soames, I do not imagine they were worn by a man. But
I <i>do</i> think that the time has come for you to speak out and
tell the truth."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="telegram"><b>"Charlton Crescent Mystery! Astounding Story!"</b></p>

<p>Walking quickly down a side street near Charlton Crescent,
Inspector Furnival was greeted by the foregoing placard.</p>

<p>"<i>Daily Mercury,</i> Midday Edition&mdash;that's the racing
edition," he said to himself. "Umph! They must think they have got
hold of something good, if they find room for anything but lists of
probable winners and wires from the course!"</p>

<p>He took a paper from the boy and unfolded it as he walked.</p>

<p class="newspaper"><b>"Charlton Crescent Mystery&mdash;Astounding development!"</b></p>

<p>figured largely on the front page.</p>

<p>"Now, what the deuce have they got hold of?" he said to himself
as he turned to it. "Oh, by Jove!" His face clouded over as he
read.</p>

<p class="newspaper">At the moment of going to press an extraordinary story has been
brought to our notice. A witness from Queensland, whose good faith
we have no reason to doubt, has identified Bruce Cardyn, the
secretary, as Bruce Daventry Balmaine, only son of Robert and
Marjorie Balmaine&mdash;Mrs. Balmaine being, of course, the Miss
Marjorie Daventry who has often been mentioned in the course of the
Charlton Crescent case. She was the daughter of the late Squire
Daventry by his first wife and thus step-daughter of the murdered
Lady Anne. She or her children, should she leave any, inherit
largely at Lady Anne's death under the old Squire's will. Until now
it has been supposed that she left only one daughter, the Miss
Margaret Balmaine so often mentioned in the history of the case,
but it has now been proved beyond doubt that her son also survived
her, and is now known as Bruce Cardyn, the secretary. His
assumption of the name of Cardyn is explained by the fact that his
father adopted the name of Cardyn by deed of poll on coming in to
some money on the death of a distant relative. But why Mr. Bruce
Cardyn entered Lady Anne Daventry's service as secretary, and why
he and his sister, Miss Margaret Balmaine, appear to have decided
to conceal their relationship seems to us to call for explanation.
The matter has been placed in the hands of the police and further
developments may be expected shortly.</p>

<p>The inspector drew a long breath when he had finished.</p>

<p>"So that's that! The fat is in the fire with a vengeance! Well,
it will quicken matters up a bit, that's one good job!"</p>

<p>He squared his shoulders as he walked along quickly. For once
his usual immobile face showed signs of inward perturbation. He
turned into the first post-office he came to and despatched several
messages, then he went quickly on to the house in Charlton
Crescent. As he went up the steps the rector of North Coton opened
the door.</p>

<p>"You there, inspector! I was just looking for you. What does
this mean?" He was holding a copy of the paper the inspector had
been reading. As he spoke he tapped the offending paragraph. The
inspector drew him back into the house.</p>

<p>"I suppose you had no idea of this, Mr. Fyvert?"</p>

<p>"Not the least. How could I have?" the reverend gentleman said
testily. "Do you mean that you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I discovered it very early in the case," the inspector
assented, leading the way to the library. "Naturally inquired into
the antecedents of every one in the room, and the fact that Mr.
Bruce Cardyn was old Squire Daventry's grandson was not
particularly difficult to find out."</p>

<p>Mr. Fyvert laid his hat on the library table, and stood gazing
at the inspector in consternation.</p>

<p>"But you do not see the difference this makes? Personally, I
have hitherto regarded Bruce Cardyn as one who might really be put
out of the question. Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now?" the inspector prompted.</p>

<p>Mr. Fyvert spread out his hands.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, is it not obvious? Bruce Cardyn, inheriting as he
does under the will of my brother-in-law, largely, at the death,
had as strong, possibly a stronger motive for
the&mdash;er&mdash;murder than any one else."</p>

<p>"I see that, of course. It jumps to the eyes," the inspector
agreed quietly.</p>

<p>"Then, once you know that, his whole conduct seems suspicious,"
the rector of North Coton went on hotly. "Why did he go to my
sister as secretary-detective, or whatever it was, without telling
her he was poor Daventry's grandson? A false name, too&mdash;it
will take a lot of explaining as far as I am concerned, let me tell
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, the name was his own, as you see in the paper," the
inspector said quietly. "It was not Cardyn's fault that Lady Anne
did not know of the change his father had made. Then, again, it was
not his doing that Lady Anne applied to the firm of inquiry agents
of which he was a member. That he attended her personally was, of
course, his choice. He explained it to me by saying that when he
saw Lady Anne had no idea of his identity he thought he would take
the opportunity of seeing his mother's old home and possibly of
making friends with the family. He knew with what distaste his
father and mother's marriage had always been regarded by the
Daventrys and he had no idea that he inherited anything under the
Squire's will. Got the idea out of a story-book, I should think, I
told him. But there you are!"</p>

<p>"There I am not!" said the rector emphatically. "I call it a
foolish attempt to explain what is unexplainable. And why did he
and his sister pretend not to recognize one another? There is
something behind all this that you have not found out yet,
inspector. It looks to me like a deep-laid plot between the two.
Though I can't believe that Margaret&mdash;However, I am going
straight back to the hotel to tax her with all this duplicity and
to hear what she has to say."</p>

<p>"I must ask you not to do that," the inspector said, taking a
few paces up and down the room, his hands clasped behind him, his
head bent, his brows drawn together. At last he came to a
standstill before the rector again. "Give me twenty-four hours,
sir, and I think I shall be able to explain all that now seems
mysterious to you. Will you give me your word not to speak to Miss
Balmaine on the subject until this time has expired?"</p>

<p>"What is the good of it if I do?" the rector questioned
impatiently. "Won't the girl see it stuck up on every poster, buy a
paper and know that the game, whatever it is, is up?"</p>

<p>"It won't be stuck up on every poster. I have taken care of
that," the inspector returned placidly. "At present this story is a
scoop of the <i>Daily Mercury'</i>s, and will remain so until there
is no more need for secrecy."</p>

<p>"Well, well! I don't see the sense of it, but as you are in
charge of the case I suppose I am bound to respect your wishes,"
conceded the rector unwillingly. "Only for twenty-four hours,
though, mind! Then I shall take the liberty of speaking to Miss
Margaret, and giving her a piece of my mind."</p>

<p>"As you like, sir. When I have had time for what I want to
do."</p>

<p>But the inspector's long-drawn breath of relief did not escape
the rector of North Coton. He frowned severely as he turned and
walked out of the house without another word.</p>

<p>Left alone, the inspector waited by the table a minute, drawing
his brows together apparently in a brown study, then he turned to a
box that stood at the end of the table, and began to look over the
contents, a heterogeneous mass of grey muslin, white paper and bits
of grey parchment. Finally he selected a square piece of the
parchment signed at both ends and a piece of charred paper on which
a few words were still visible. He scrutinized these for a few
minutes through a small microscope, then carefully wrapped them up
in tissue paper, and put them in his pocket. He locked the box and
as he went out of the room carefully locked the door. In the hall
he spoke a few words to the man on duty. Outside the house he
paused a moment and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"No time to spare!" he said to himself as he hailed a passing
taxi and bade the man drive to 161 Ilford Road, Fulham. They took
the nearest way, through the park. And though Inspector Furnival's
keen eyes took note of everything he passed his mind was busy with
the puzzles of that bewildering mystery of the house in Charlton
Crescent.</p>

<p>Ilford Road was one of the maze of small streets that lie at the
back of Fulham Road. No 161 was one of a long row of depressing
looking houses, all built after the same pattern. No. 161 differed
a little from its neighbours in that its knocker and the fanlight
over the door were a little cleaner.</p>

<p>As the inspector rang the bell, two men in plain clothes
appeared as if by magic from the corner of a side street close at
hand and at the same moment a policeman strolled by. He touched his
hat to the inspector just as the door was opened by a
tousled-looking elderly woman.</p>

<p>"Mr. Branksome at home?" asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"No! He is never at home in the daytime."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Branksome here?" the inspector went on sharply.</p>

<p>"No. I know nothing about her," the woman returned
truculently.</p>

<p>The inspector glanced at her. "Show me his rooms," he said
briefly.</p>

<p>The woman stared at him, tried to close the door&mdash;an effort
the inspector frustrated by putting out his foot.</p>

<p>"Mr. Branksome ain't fond of having folks in his rooms when he's
at home. It's no good you trying to get there when he is out," she
said defiantly, pushing the door hard upon the inspector's foot the
while.</p>

<p>"I am from Scotland Yard, my good woman," the inspector said,
handing her his card and at the same time beckoning to the
policeman who was apparently watching the proceedings with
interest. He gave the man a few low-toned directions.</p>

<p>"Now, madam," he said, turning back, "the rooms at once,
please."</p>

<p>The woman made no further objection. She let the door open and
slipped back against the wall with a half-sob.</p>

<p>"I can't stop you, but I have always been a respectable woman
myself. I never had the police coming to my house."</p>

<p>The inspector stopped and looked at her.</p>

<p>"I think, madam, I had the pleasure of making your acquaintance
in Kensington a few years ago. There was a little charge of
shop-lifting. Mrs. Glover your name was then, if I remember
rightly. No need to mention more, I see. The rooms, please."</p>

<p>The landlady's face had turned as white as chalk.</p>

<p>"The drawing-room suite, first floor," she said, her breath
coming unevenly.</p>

<p>The inspector waited for no more. He went up two stairs at a
time. The drawing-room suite evidently consisted of a small,
dingily furnished, drab-looking little sitting-room and a small
scantily furnished bedroom behind. At first sight there was nothing
to differentiate it from hundreds of lodgings in the same sort of
house in London, but the inspector's keen eyes saw that a wooden
cupboard in the corner of the sitting-room and a box in the corner
of the bedroom had both been fitted with extra strong locks. Not
strong, enough, however, to resist a certain little instrument the
inspector took from his pocket. Very soon the contents of the box
were at his mercy and the inspector gave a satisfied grunt as his
flexible fingers ran through them and separated them. Some curious
articles were at the top&mdash;a mass of white hair; what looked
like a woman's bonnet; underneath, a long old-fashioned cloak of
black silk. Then again under that many papers and letters. The
inspector glanced through them casually and selected one or
two.</p>

<p>Then he drew out a large photograph in a handsome tooled leather
frame&mdash;a photograph of a pretty, smiling, fair girl, in a
remarkably <i>décolletée</i> gown. "Yours always, Daisy," was
scrawled across it.</p>

<p>The inspector grinned. "I wonder what Miss Daisy will say when
she sees this," he said to himself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p>It was curious how often Bruce Cardyn's steps took him past the
nursing home in FitzGeorge Square where Maureen Fyvert was being
slowly nursed back to health. In whatever part of London his
business lay, the way home was always by FitzGeorge Square. It was
but very seldom, however, that he was rewarded by the sight of the
sick child's sister or any sign of her. To-night, he had been busy
all day on some work for his partner, for of late Inspector
Furnival's demand on his time had been less insistent. The poster
and the <i>Daily Mercury</i> had naturally not escaped his notice,
and it seemed to him that the detective's insistent advice had
turned out as badly as it well could, and he had his own reasons
for disliking the discovery of his identity to occur at this
present juncture.</p>

<p>The inspector was still busy most days. That the mystery
surrounding Lady Anne Daventry's death was rapidly being cleared
up, Bruce knew. The bits of the puzzle, as the inspector termed it,
were fitting into one another. But the major mystery remained a
mystery to Cardyn yet. That certain suspicions had presented
themselves went without saying. One possibility there was that
would keep recurring to his mind, only to be dismissed with
shuddering horror.</p>

<p>As he took the turning leading into the Square he saw a familiar
figure approaching.</p>

<p>Dorothy was walking very quickly and her face bore manifest
traces of disturbance. She had got quite near him before he was
recognized. Then he saw her hesitate a moment as if she were going
to turn back. He quickened his steps.</p>

<p>"Miss Fyvert, I was hoping to see you!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" The girl distinctly drew away from him now and regarded
him with cool unfriendly eyes. "And why should you wish to see
me&mdash;Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Cardyn&mdash;er&mdash;Balmaine? Really,
I do not know what to call you now." Then in a moment she saw the
obvious opening she had given him and turned away biting her
lip.</p>

<p>But it was too late to retrieve her error.</p>

<p>"My name is Bruce Balmaine Cardyn as it always was," the man
said quietly. "And I should be very grateful if you would call me
Bruce. After all, we are a sort of cousins, are we not?"</p>

<p>Dorothy shook her head.</p>

<p>"No! No, Mr. Balmaine Cardyn&mdash;no! Really there is not even
a connexion between us. I couldn't really believe that a cousin of
mine could turn detective."</p>

<p>"Well, I do not want to be your cousin," he said daringly. "I
should prefer another relationship, Dorothy."</p>

<p>The girl put out her hand. "Please don't&mdash;now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Later!" Bruce assented daringly.</p>

<p>Dorothy's eyes were full of unshed tears.</p>

<p>"I can't think of anything but Maureen now. At least I
shouldn't, only&mdash;what does this mean!" She held out an opened
letter to him.</p>

<p>Cardyn glanced at it. It was not dated, he noticed at once;
probably, he thought quickly, that Dorothy should have no
opportunity of refusing the interview.</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Madam,<br>
<br>
I shall do myself the honour of calling upon you at your hotel
this evening about seven o'clock if you will be good enough to give
me a few minutes conversation.<br>
<br>
Yours obediently,<br>
<br>
J.F. FURNIVAL.</p>

<p>"Oh, do try and keep him away!" Dorothy urged, tears springing
into her brown eyes. "I,&mdash;it makes me ill to see
him&mdash;that horrid man! I know that it was his prying about the
house that made Maureen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How is she?" Cardyn questioned as she waited, looking up at him
imploringly.</p>

<p>"I think she is better," Dorothy said slowly. "She knows us all,
and she is not delirious and only talks about the Cat Burglar in
her sleep. But she is so frightfully weak. She can hardly lift her
hand to her head, and she lies so quietly and so still, only
looking at you with such big frightened eyes, that I can hardly
believe that the pale child on the pillows is Maureen."</p>

<p>"Poor child!" Cardyn said sympathetically. "Has she said
anything about Alice Gray or told you where she was those two
days?"</p>

<p>"She has told us nothing&mdash;nothing at all!" Dorothy answered
with a little quiver in her voice. "And the doctor says that we are
not to ask her anything or talk of anything exciting before her. In
her sleep, as I said, she talks of the Cat Burglar. And sometimes
she cries so piteously and begs us not to let her go to
prison&mdash;either of us, she always says. I suppose she means
herself and Alice. Mr. Cardyn, do you think her mind dwells on
those fearful stories of that wretched Cat Burglar, simply because
she has heard them talked about? You do not&mdash;do not think she
could have had anything to do with&mdash;with helping him to murder
Lady Anne?"</p>

<p>"Of course not!" Cardyn beckoned to a passing taxi. "Miss
Fyvert, you will let me see you to the hotel. I may be able to help
you with the inspector." For a wonder Dorothy made no objection,
but stepped meekly into the taxi. Cardyn seated himself
opposite.</p>

<p>"Miss Fyvert, you must not worry about the nonsense your little
sister talks. That she got into bad hands when she struck up a
friendship with Alice Gray is indisputable, but that either of the
two had any part in Lady Anne Daventry's murder is impossible,
unbelievable."</p>

<p>Dorothy felt vaguely comforted. Once more Bruce Cardyn seemed to
have turned from the detective she despised into the kind stranger
who had rescued her from the fire, and of whom she had so often
secretly dreamt during the past two years.</p>

<p>"But if it is not about Maureen, what do you think he wants to
see me for?" she questioned after a time.</p>

<p>Bruce was quick to notice the difference in her tone. He had
never heard that note in it since the inspector had disclosed his
real occupation to her.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he said slowly after a pause, during which he
had silently gazed at the houses they were so swiftly passing.
"Inspector Furnival has not given me his confidence in any way, but
I should think&mdash;I should imagine that it might be about that
letter that was found in the escritoire&mdash;the one from you to
Lady Anne, mean.''</p>

<p>"In which I asked her for money?" Dorothy questioned, her tones
hardening. "I suppose he wants to know why I wanted it and how I
got it."</p>

<p>"I should think it more than probable," Bruce assented.</p>

<p>"I shall not tell him," Dorothy said defiantly. "Why should
I?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is not wise to make an enemy of the inspector, you
know," said Bruce diplomatically.</p>

<p>"It cannot possibly matter to him why I wanted the money. I
didn't get it," the girl argued.</p>

<p>"No. That is perhaps why he wants to question you," Bruce said
quietly. "Miss Fyvert, don't you see that in a case like this the
police are bound to inquire into everything&mdash;even the veriest
trifle that may have any bearing upon it? You will only at the most
delay matters by opposing the inspector. It will all come out in
the end. I know&mdash;I am certain that you have nothing to be
ashamed of. Why not trust the inspector?"</p>

<p>"Because I hate him&mdash;loathe him!" Dorothy exclaimed with
sudden warmth. "Detestable man! He dared to hint to me that my need
of money might have been supplied by stealing Lady Anne's pearls
and selling them! I believe he is capable of saying that I murdered
her too. Now if it had been you&mdash;" She stopped short with a
quick look that set all Bruce's pulses thrilling.</p>

<p>"If I asked you, would you trust me?" he questioned gravely.</p>

<p>Dorothy hesitated a minute, then she stretched out her hand.</p>

<p>"I have been a beast all the time&mdash;an ungrateful beast,"
she said impulsively. "But I will trust you&mdash;I do trust you. I
will tell you all about it&mdash;you will not fail me."</p>

<p>Bruce held the slender ungloved hand for a moment in his firm,
strong clasp.</p>

<p>"If you will honour me with your confidence I promise to respect
it in every way and in any circumstance," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"Well, then I will," Dorothy said with the air of one coming to
a sudden decision. "It&mdash;it really isn't my own secret. That
was one reason why I did not tell it at once. I had lost money at
cards, certainly, but my half-sister, Mrs. St. John Lavis, had lost
much more. Her husband is poor, and naturally was very angry when
she ran him into debt. He had forbidden her to play cards the last
time he paid up for her losses, and threatened to advertise that he
was not responsible if she did it again. He would have done it too.
He is just the sort of man who would. And then Mona would have been
ruined. Nobody would have trusted her in the shops or anywhere. And
of course, that would have done for her socially even in the
present day. I don't really think that morals matter so much as
money nowadays," she finished, looking at him with wet eyes.</p>

<p>"Some people put money before everything," Bruce acquiesced.
"Then it was really on Mrs. Lavis' behalf that you appealed to Lady
Anne?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course! There was nobody else I could ask. And I
thought&mdash;I did think Aunt Anne cared for me enough to help me.
But you see she wouldn't. Then, I don't know what we should have
done, but my mother had left us some jewels we were to sell only in
case of great extremity. My share was an emerald necklace with a
diamond enamel pendant. A cousin of ours had always admired it and
was willing to give a fancy price for it. So we sold it to her and
paid Mona's debts."</p>

<p>"Why did not Mrs. Lavis sell her share instead of yours?" Bruce
questioned.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, my cousin would only have bought the emeralds, you
see. Besides&mdash;" Dorothy's voice sank&mdash;"Mona had disposed
of hers before I appealed to Lady Anne. That was only a last
resource. I didn't really think the emeralds would have fetched as
much as they did."</p>

<p>"Then there was the fifty-pound note that you gave to your
dressmaker, and that was one of those paid by Messrs. Spagnum for
the pearls?" Bruce suggested.</p>

<p>"I have never been able to understand that," Dorothy said,
meeting his gaze openly. "Aunt Anne gave it to me as my half-year's
allowance."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure it was the same note?" Bruce asked after
thinking a minute.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think so," Dorothy said, considering the question. "I
didn't take the number, but it looked just the same. I put it in my
writing-case and locked it up, so of course it must have been."</p>

<p>"If your writing-case had just one of those ordinary little
locks it might quite easily have been changed. How long did you
leave it in the case?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not long. Only until the next day, believe. I wasn't
particularly well-off just then. And I owed Madame Benoit a good
deal of it so I took it to her at once. So there wasn't much time
to change it, you see. Besides, who would want to do it?"</p>

<p>"Ah? That is the question!" Bruce responded, his eyes looking
away from the fair face of the girl opposite, mechanically watching
the passing traffic. "The obvious answer is the person who stole
the pearls, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh! But that must have been a burglar, some one outside the
house," Dorothy objected.</p>

<p>Cardyn did not answer for a minute, then he said very
deliberately:</p>

<p>"Some one in the house took Lady Anne's diary from the
escritoire. Some one in the house took and could have explained the
mystery of the pearls."</p>

<p>"I don't see that," Dorothy said obstinately. "If&mdash;if the
Cat Burglar got up to the window and murdered Lady Anne, I don't
know why he shouldn't have opened my writing-case and changed the
note."</p>

<p>"Where did he get the other one from?" Cardyn questioned. "The
one that Messrs. Spagnum gave the thief?"</p>

<p>"Well, naturally, I suppose he stole the pearls and got the note
himself and put it into my case."</p>

<p>"That implies that the thief knew you had a fifty-pound note
there," Cardyn argued. "And it makes it practically certain that it
was some one in the house. The Cat Burglar could not have
known."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure," Dorothy said doubtfully. "He seems such an
omnipresent sort of person, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"He would be, if he did everything that was put down to him,"
Bruce observed dryly. "Now, Miss Fyvert, you will trust me to
respect your confidence. But at the same time you will allow me to
explain matters to the inspector if absolutely necessary?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I suppose so," Dorothy hesitated. "I had ever so much
rather you did not tell him, though. It is so different with you.
You see, knowing you beforehand&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;looking upon
you as a friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were nearing the hotel where the Fyverts were staying now.
As the driver began to slow down, threading his way through the
traffic, Bruce leaned forward.</p>

<p>"It is my dearest hope that you will continue to trust
me&mdash;to look upon me as a friend," he said earnestly. "The time
is close at hand now when everything will be cleared up. And
then&mdash;then may I perhaps dare to ask for more than
friendship&mdash;Dorothy. I wonder whether you will give it to
me?"</p>

<p>But the girl's eyes did not meet his. She drew away into the
corner of the taxi.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said lamely. "I can't even think of things
now. I can't decide anything."</p>

<p>She sprang out of the taxi, pushing aside Cardyn's proffered
hand, and hurried into the hotel. Cardyn followed more slowly. She
did not pause in the lounge, but almost ran upstairs.</p>

<p>Bruce stood looking after her for a minute, then as he turned he
met the quizzical gaze of Inspector Furnival.</p>

<p>"The young lady seems to be in a hurry. I am glad to see you,
though, Mr. Cardyn. You will be quite valuable as an assistant at
the interview I have arranged." He glanced at his watch. "Yes, I
thought the time was getting on. Come along, Mr. Cardyn, the scene
is set for the first scene in the final drama."</p>

<p>He turned to the staircase, Bruce accompanying him, then stopped
and beckoned to a man standing near the door, a man whom Bruce
recognized as one of the inspector's satellites. He was carrying an
oddly shaped parcel, wrapped carelessly in brown paper.</p>

<p>The thought struck Cardyn that it looked like an old
countrywoman's luggage. Rack his brains as he would he could not
make out what it contained.</p>

<p>The three of them proceeded up the stairs and a little way along
the corridor at the top. There the inspector opened the door of a
small sitting-room&mdash;evidently private, and, motioning Bruce to
enter, took the parcel from his man, at the same time saying a few
words in an undertone. Bruce caught the last sentence&mdash;"As
soon as it comes, mind. Let there be no mistake."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p>Dorothy Fyvert walked quickly into the room. Cardyn got the
impression that she had waited outside lacking the courage to
enter, and then, rallying her self-control by a supreme effort, had
come in with a rush. He made a step forward, but she did not glance
at him. Her brown eyes sought the inspector's and, meeting his,
stayed there with a terrified expression.</p>

<p>"You wanted to speak to me?" she said nervously.</p>

<p>The inspector did not answer for a minute. Apparently he was
listening to some distant sound. At last he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes. I wished to speak to you and to Miss Balmaine. A certain
piece of new evidence has been obtained which might bear distinctly
on the matter of Lady Anne Daventry's death, and I should like to
know what you both have to say about it."</p>

<p>"What is it?" Dorothy questioned curtly.</p>

<p>"You shall know in a minute," the inspector promised. "Miss
Balmaine will be here directly. We will wait for her."</p>

<p>As he spoke his eyes strayed to the brown paper parcel which he
had deposited under a small table and of which only one corner was
to be seen.</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished speaking when Margaret Balmaine opened
the door. She looked a curious contrast to Dorothy, whose pallor
and general look of anxiety had been accentuated by the inspector's
note. Miss Balmaine had returned to the make-up which she had
temporarily discarded at the time of Lady Anne's death. She was
wearing to-day a frock of pale grey marocain, exquisitely
embroidered in silver beads, and caught up at one side with an old
silver and crystal clasp. The gown was very short as to sleeves and
skirt, very low as to neck, but the throat and arms so generously
revealed were beautifully modelled, the legs and feet in their nude
silk stockings and grey suede shoes were without flaw. But Cardyn
could not help feeling as he had often felt before that it was a
thousand pities that Margaret Balmaine with undeniable good looks
should resort to such very obvious artificial means to enhance
them. The pink and white of her cheeks, the darkness of her
eyebrows and eyes, even the sheen of her shingled golden hair were
all, quite evidently, due to art. Yet in spite of everything, in
spite of the ready smile with which she greeted the inspector,
Cardyn could not help fancying that he saw some intangible traces
of disturbance on her face.</p>

<p>"Well inspector," she began, in her old half defiant manner.
"What is this very serious business that you want to see me upon?
Have you found out who killed Lady Anne, or who abducted
Maureen?"</p>

<p>"Both, I hope, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Balmaine," the inspector
answered her quietly, the gravity of his tone contrasting curiously
with the lightness of hers.</p>

<p>Meeting his eyes, it seemed to Cardyn that the girl visibly
winced.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear it!" she said in the same tone. "You
have been long enough about it, have you not? And who is guilty,
inspector?" This time the anxiety in her tone was obvious.</p>

<p>The inspector did not choose to satisfy it.</p>

<p>"All in good time! All in good time! I have just a few questions
to ask you young ladies now before we say any more."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, inspector," Dorothy interposed, "if you have found out
about Maureen&mdash;I&mdash;really must know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, the Brighton police traced that without much
difficulty," the inspector answered. "It seems that Alice Gray got
into conversation with some young man on the esplanade. There were
some travelling musicians on the beach and a gipsy fortune-teller
with a van behind, and little Miss Maureen began to dance to the
music with the other children. Of course, trained as she had been
she attracted the notice of the fortune-teller, who appears to have
thought there was money to be made out of abducting her. She
persuaded her to get into the van and drove off. Then, learning
from the papers later who the child was, I suppose she thought more
money would be obtained by waiting&mdash;or she fancied she would
be safer if the girl were dressed up as a boy. She came up to
London to some horrible haunt in the East End, and I suppose the
child escaped from there and managed to find her way back to
Charlton Crescent. The shock of it all acting upon her when she was
already in bad health seems to have been too much for her brain.
That is what I make of it. But of positive ill treatment there was
none."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Dorothy turned away to the window. The inspector's
words had relieved her of a horrible dread.</p>

<p>Margaret Balmaine waited. Her head was thrown back. Cardyn saw
that one of her hands, hanging down by her side, was clenching and
unclenching itself nervously.</p>

<p>The inspector, too, waited for a minute. His face was very stern
as he glanced from one girl to the other. At last he seemed to be
satisfied.</p>

<p>He drew from its hiding-place the brown paper parcel that he had
brought into the room, and set it on the table. Dorothy turned
towards him, moving slowly as if drawn against her will, staring at
the parcel. Margaret Balmaine's eyes followed his every movement as
if fascinated. The inspector took a knife from his pocket and,
opening it, set about cutting the string and unwrapping the paper
with exasperating slowness.</p>

<p>Cardyn scarcely knew what he expected, but certainly he was not
prepared to see the inspector lift out with meticulous care just a
milliner's cardboard box and then from that an old-fashioned black
silk bonnet. Inspector Furnival held this up in his hand for a
minute, apparently surveying it with the greatest interest, while
from beneath his lowered eyelids his keen little eyes went from one
to the other of the motionless faces of the girls before him.</p>

<p>"Very like a bonnet of Lady Anne Daventry's," he shot out a
last. "But&mdash;not Lady Anne's!"</p>

<p>Dead silence followed. Neither girl moved. At last Dorothy drew
a long breath. Margaret Balmaine might have been carved out of
stone, so absolutely motionless was she. The inspector's eyes
relaxed their scrutiny. He made another dive into the box and
produced a white wig, evidently dressed in imitation of Lady Anne's
own beautiful snow-white hair. At sight of it Dorothy shuddered
violently and clutched at the table, shivering from head to
foot.</p>

<p>"Oh, what does it mean? What does it mean?" she cried.</p>

<p>Not one muscle of Margaret Balmaine's face stirred. Even the
hand by her side was still now. Cardyn's eyes watching closely saw
that the knuckles were showing white through the tightening skin.
Then he looked away from her to the girl he loved. There could be
no doubt that Dorothy was frightened&mdash;horribly frightened. Her
pretty brown eyes were wide open, dilated and staring at the mass
of hair in the inspector's hand with a horrible fixity. Her mouth
was twitching, too; more than once she moistened her dry lips with
her tongue. Cardyn made a step towards her, as if to range himself
on her side to protect her. But she put out her hand and motioned
him back imperatively.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" she questioned hoarsely. "I&mdash;I can't
understand."</p>

<p>There was another pause. Then the inspector said in the quick
curt tones that cut across the tragic atmosphere of the room like a
knife:</p>

<p>"It means that we have always suspected, that undoubtedly some
one has, on one occasion, if not more, successfully impersonated
Lady Anne Daventry. I asked for this interview in order to see
whether either of you two ladies could help me to discover the
guilty person."</p>

<p>"Of course we can't&mdash;we told you we knew nothing about the
theft of the pearls," Dorothy said, that painful twitching of her
mouth extending to her throat, the straining of her muscles plainly
visible.</p>

<p>Margaret Balmaine stepped quietly to her side.</p>

<p>"Do not frighten yourself, Dorothy. Don't you see that the
inspector&mdash;<i>knows</i>? May I ask Inspector Furnival how long
it has been allowed to introduce the customs of France into our
judicial procedure? Though I believe that in the neighbouring
country the examination takes place before a magistrate, so that
there is at least some semblance of fairness. But here you try to
frighten two defenceless girls into incriminating themselves. Take
away your pieces of accusation, inspector"&mdash;pointing to the
wig and the bonnet&mdash;"you will not find out anything here."</p>

<p>The words were a defiance, her manner, her gesture were superb.
In spite of all that Cardyn knew, in spite of that further at which
he only guessed, he felt a quick throb of admiration as he looked
at her, at the small, uplifted star-like head.</p>

<p>It was evident that her colour beneath her makeup had not
varied. Her eyes were clear and steady and full of scorn as she
looked at the inspector.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do? It does not seem to have struck
you that there have been other well-dressed old ladies in the world
besides Lady Anne Daventry, and possibly those
things"&mdash;pointing at them contemptuously&mdash;"have been worn
to impersonate someone quite different. Or they may just be
'properties' worn by some actress."</p>

<p>"I fancy they were," the inspector interposed quietly.</p>

<p>He moved nearer the two girls as he spoke. Dorothy backed
against the wall. The horror in her eyes had deepened during the
inspector's brief colloquy with Margaret. She gazed helplessly from
one to the other.</p>

<p>"Where did you find those things?" Margaret questioned him.</p>

<p>"Ah I thought that might interest you," the inspector answered
as he put his hand into the box again and drew out this time a
strange, staring-looking object&mdash;a rough mask, such as are
worn on Guy Fawkes day. From it there dangled long wisps of dirty
white muslin.</p>

<p>"Another property," he observed dryly. "You do not seem
interested, Miss Balmaine. And yet you would like to know where the
wig and the bonnet were found. Well, I have been searching in
strange places. The first two properties"&mdash;repeating the last
word with sarcastic emphasis&mdash;"were found&mdash;" He stopped,
and this time his gaze was fixed wholly upon Margaret Balmaine.</p>

<p>The tenseness of her attitude did not alter, but Cardyn caught a
momentary flicker of her eyelids.</p>

<p>"Where were they found?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"In an apartment house in Ilford Road, Fulham," the inspector
finished. "In a room occupied for the time being by Lady Anne's
late secretary, Mr. David Branksome."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the effect his words produced. A sort of
quiver of relief passed over Dorothy's face. Some of the tension
and the strain died out, a faint tinge of colour came back; to the
pale cheeks.</p>

<p>Margaret Balmaine started, for one second she set her small
white teeth hard in her lip. Then she passed her handkerchief over
it quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" she flashed out.</p>

<p>The inspector shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that belief or unbelief cannot affect hard
facts."</p>

<p>Miss Balmaine flashed an angry glance at him. She had begun a
defiant rejoinder when there was an interruption. There was a loud,
insistent knock at the door.</p>

<p>Cardyn was about to open it, but the inspector was before him. A
waiter with a familiar-looking yellow envelope on his salver stood
in the passage.</p>

<p>"Telegram, sir, just come!"</p>

<p>The inspector took it and with a word of thanks shut the door.
Then he tore the envelope open, while the other three stared at him
breathlessly. An expression of relief was on his face as he glanced
up.</p>

<p>"This is from North Hackney," he said quietly. "David Branksome
was arrested there at four o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p>"Arrested! It is not true!" Margaret Balmaine's voice rang
across the stillness that followed the inspector's words like a
trumpet.</p>

<p>"Quite true!" said the inspector blandly. "Why do you say it is
not?"</p>

<p>"Because he is not guilty. I know he is not," the girl said
hotly.</p>

<p>"And how can you know that?" the inspector went on.</p>

<p>"Because he was miles away! I know he was!" Miss Balmaine
reiterated.</p>

<p>"Miles away from&mdash;where&mdash;when?" the inspector
questioned incisively.</p>

<p>Looking at him, his subordinates would have said that he was
getting dangerous now.</p>

<p>"From that house in Charlton Crescent where Lady Anne Daventry
was killed."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the inspector quietly. "But I did not say anything
about the house in Charlton Crescent or Lady Anne Daventry's death,
I think. David Branksome has been arrested for stealing Lady Anne's
pearls, not for being concerned in her death."</p>

<p>"He did not!" Margaret Balmaine's voice was as clear as
ever.</p>

<p>"How do you know he did not?" The inspector's tone was as
determined as hers.</p>

<p>Dorothy and Cardyn looked on much as the seconds in a duel
might.</p>

<p>"I know he is innocent&mdash;that he did not steal the pearls.
Because"&mdash;the girl paused and gulped something down in her
throat&mdash;"I stole them myself!"</p>

<p>"You stole them, Miss Balmaine?" The tone was expressive of
nothing but well simulated surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. I did steal them," Margaret Balmaine reiterated. She stood
as she had stood throughout the interview, her head held up
defiantly, her clenched hand hanging by her side, the other
steadying her against the table behind. "I stole the pearls, I wore
your properties"&mdash;pointing contemptuously to the wig and
bonnet&mdash;"I impersonated Lady Anne and got the money from
Spagnum's. Now, what are you going to do, Inspector Furnival?"</p>

<p>"Why did you do it?" the inspector questioned, his quiet tone in
strong contrast with the fire of hers.</p>

<p>She threw out her hands.</p>

<p>"Can't you see, man? I wanted the money. I have always wanted
money, more than I ever had all my life. Here was a chance to get
it, to help myself, and I took it. Now, I ask you again, what are
you going to do with me? Arrest me, do what you like, only let
David Branksome go free."</p>

<p>"I see." The inspector looked at her consideringly. "But this
does not account for the bonnet and wig being found in Mr. David
Branksome's lodgings or for the footsteps in the flower border. How
do you explain these things, Miss Balmaine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," she said, her white fingers clutching one
another in an agony. "I do not believe in your footmarks at all. I
<i>know</i> David Branksome was far away from Charlton Crescent
when Lady Anne was murdered. As for the wig and bonnet, he found
out what I had done and took them away so that no one would suspect
me. Why he kept them I don't know. Now&mdash;now you must let him
out."</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

<p>"I have no power to do that. And&mdash;I do not know&mdash;I
doubt whether any jury would believe your story. They would say, I
am afraid, that you had invented it to save your lover&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How dare you!" the girl interrupted passionately. "It&mdash;it
had nothing to do with David. I did it on my own. The pearls were
of no use to Lady Anne. She never wore them. Very often she told us
that she would never wear any jewellery again. She seldom even
looked at them. They were shut up in that secret hiding-place in
the escritoire&mdash;no use to anyone. While to me they meant
just&mdash;salvation. I took them. I got myself up to look like
Lady Anne&mdash;I had always been good at theatricals&mdash;and was
most successful in deceiving Spagnum's."</p>

<p>"How did you manage to get to the escritoire? And without
leaving any marks?" the inspector questioned.</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" she hesitated and bit her lip. "After all, most
things are possible with skeleton keys."</p>

<p>"A skeleton key would not open or show the secret of the
springs," the inspector said dryly. "You will have to think of
something else, Miss Balmaine."</p>

<p>"I will not!" she flashed hotly. "I did take them&mdash;that is
enough for you. I will tell you nothing more. I did take the
pearls. How I got them is my own business."</p>

<p>"Yours and Mr. Branksome's," the inspector suggested.</p>

<p>With a glance of supreme contempt Margaret Balmaine turned her
back upon him and addressed herself to the other two.</p>

<p>"You do see, don't you, that I did take the pearls? I must say
so now that David is arrested. It&mdash;it was a sudden temptation.
I wanted to have some money while I was young enough to enjoy
things. Lady Anne was old. But I wish now that I had not taken her
pearls. I would never have touched her to hurt her. Nor would
David. You do believe me, do you not?"</p>

<p>"<i>Qui s'excuse, s'accuse,"</i> the inspector murmured
softly.</p>

<p>Dorothy cast a reproachful glance at him as she laid her arm
caressingly round the other girl's back.</p>

<p>"Certainly I believe you, Margaret. I am sure you would not have
hurt Lady Anne and I know what temptation is. I&mdash;I might have
yielded to this myself, if my need had been as great as yours."</p>

<p>"One question," interposed the inspector. "The price of the
pearls was paid to you by Spagnum's under the belief that you were
Lady Anne Daventry. So much we have discovered, so much you have
acknowledged. Now, will you tell us how it was that Miss Fyvert
paid the dressmaker's bill with one of the notes you received?" For
the first time Margaret Balmaine's eyes fell before his, and a dull
flush of shame made itself visible through her powder. She turned
from the detective to Dorothy's pitying eyes.</p>

<p>"I changed it, Dorothy. But I did not mean to do you any harm. I
did not think the loss of the pearls would be discovered for ages,
perhaps not in Lady Anne's lifetime. And then it would have been
thought that she had disposed of them herself. If it had not been
for those tiresome girls asking to see them that afternoon that is
how it would have been, and there would have been no bother at
all."</p>

<p>"Poor Aunt Anne!" said Dorothy softly. "I wish she had not found
out. It troubled her last moments. But she knows all about it now,
Margaret. And&mdash;I think we may be sure&mdash;she
understands."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know&mdash;we don't know anything." With a quick
sob Margaret Balmaine tore herself from the other's embrace.</p>

<p>With his heart in his eyes Bruce Cardyn watched the girl he
loved, the pity in her eyes deepening, only the trembling of her
lips, her varying colour showing how deeply she was moved. Once he
turned towards her impetuously as though to protect her, stand by
her. But in a second he checked the impulse and waited.</p>

<p>The inspector was glancing from one to the other sharply. Not
one change in their expression escaped him. But his eyes rested
last and longest on Margaret Balmaine.</p>

<p>"If there were to be any bother, though," he went on suavely,
"you preferred Miss Fyvert to face it sooner than do so yourself.
That we all understand, Miss Balmaine. Now it is my painful duty to
arrest you for the theft of Lady Anne Daventry's pearls. A taxi is
waiting with a couple of officers. But if you will walk quietly
downstairs and through the hall with me no one will know anything
about it and there need be no unpleasantness."</p>

<p>"Arrested!" Margaret Balmaine swayed.</p>

<p>Dorothy sprang to her side again.</p>

<p>"This is not right, inspector," she cried passionately. "You are
exceeding your orders. You&mdash;I believe the pearls are mine now,
and I will not have anyone prosecuted for taking them. You cannot,
you dare not take Miss Balmaine away. I will send for her cousin,
Mr. John Daventry&mdash;you will see that he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. John Daventry is on his way here," said the inspector,
glancing at his watch. "I phoned him as soon as I saw the way
things were going, and got an answer. He is coming up in his car.
As for the pearls, we received instructions from Lady Anne Daventry
herself&mdash;those instructions were confirmed by her only acting
executor, the Rev. and Hon. Augustus Fyvert. I am afraid that even
your subsequent inheritance gives you no power to alter them, Miss
Fyvert."</p>

<p>"You are taking an unfair advantage," Dorothy said hotly. "We
ought to have had some one here to take our
part&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Fyvert," the inspector said gravely, "you must not blame
me for what I am doing. I have no choice in the matter, and very
soon you will understand that."</p>

<p>"I shall not," Dorothy said stoutly. "I shall always blame
you&mdash;I will never forgive you if you arrest Margaret. If she
goes with you, I will come too. I shall tell the
magistrate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said the inspector firmly. "No one must come with me but
my prisoner."</p>

<p>"No," said Margaret Balmaine suddenly. "You cannot come with me,
Dorothy. You must not link your young life with my miserable lot.
Soon you will learn the worst there is to know about me, and, when
you do, will you forgive and pity your poor unhappy Margaret?" She
stooped and catching the other girl's hand pressed her lips to it
lingeringly. Then she glanced at the inspector. "I am ready," she
said simply. "I will come&mdash;only be as quick as you can."</p>

<p>Cardyn stepped to the door quickly.</p>

<p>"If I can help you, will you let me for the sake of one who was
very dear to us both?" he said to her quietly.</p>

<p>She paused and the inspector waited behind, Dorothy watching
them in puzzled amazement.</p>

<p>"You know?" she said simply. "I&mdash;I sometimes thought you
did."</p>

<p>"Naturally!" he assented. "Because Maisie&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sudden light broke over her face.</p>

<p>"Of course! I have been blind all this time. Now I see. You are
Maisie's brother!"</p>

<p>He bent his head. "And for her sake, because she loved you and I
know how hard life is for women, let me do anything I can for
you."</p>

<p>"Help David if you can," she whispered. "Nobody can help me.
Only&mdash;just believe me&mdash;living, I would never have robbed
Maisie."</p>

<p>"I am sure you would not," he assented. He held her hand for a
moment in his firm clasp, then, dropping it, stood back.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she whispered. "Tell Dorothy&mdash;"</p>

<p>She went out, her small golden head held high. The inspector
followed closely. Glancing round, Cardyn saw that two men stood
further down the passage, that two others were waiting near. They
were all in plain clothes, but Cardyn's quick eyes recognized them
at once as Inspector Furnival's subordinates. He felt a passing
touch of wonder that, the inspector's preparations had been so
extensive and so thorough. The arrest of one girl like Margaret
Balmaine scarcely seemed to call for such strong measures.</p>

<p>But just then he had not time to think of anyone but Dorothy. He
went back to her. She was standing as he had left her, near the
table opposite the door. He thought she looked terribly ill, worse
even than she had in those dreadful days when Maureen was missing.
But to his unutterable joy she turned to him now in her trouble.
She stretched out her hands to him.</p>

<p>"Tell me how we can help her!"</p>

<p>"The first thing to do is to engage a lawyer for her defence,"
Bruce answered slowly. "Then, if, as the inheritrix and actual
owner of the pearls you plead for her at the trial, her sentence
may be lightened. I am afraid it is useless to think of her getting
off altogether."</p>

<p>Dorothy interrupted him with a cry of protest.</p>

<p>"It must not&mdash;it cannot go to trial. It must be stopped.
John's cousin&mdash;the old Squire's granddaughter. I think I must
be going out of my mind. And&mdash;and I was forgetting. You are
Balmaine Cardyn&mdash;she is your sister and you are letting her go
to prison without saying a word to help her! Oh, it is monstrous!
monstrous!"</p>

<p>"I should say monstrous too," Cardyn agreed taking the girl's
cold hand in his and noting the relief in her eyes as she heard his
words. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are no buts," she interrupted him passionately. "I tell
you it is monstrous! That you, her brother, should not do
anything&mdash;lose anything to get her off."</p>

<p>"Yes." Cardyn felt the fingers he still held firmly move, try to
detach themselves from his, but he would not release them. Instead
he pressed them until his clasp became almost painful. "Dorothy! I
wish it had fallen to anyone but myself to tell you&mdash;to break
to you&mdash;" He stopped short to find words in which to tell her
what he knew she had never imagined.</p>

<p>Some of his nervousness communicated itself to Dorothy. She
looked at him with eyes in which there lurked an unutterable
dread.</p>

<p>"Bruce," she said, using his Christian name for the first time,
"don't tell me that you&mdash;that anybody thinks&mdash;that Aunt
Anne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said reassuringly. "I do not think&mdash;as far as
I know&mdash;there is no reason to connect her with Lady Anne's
death at all."</p>

<p>"Then what do you mean?" questioned Dorothy. "I&mdash;please let
me know the worst at once. I don't think I can bear much more," her
voice trembling.</p>

<p>"The girl whom you have known as Margaret Balmaine has no claim
to the name at all," Bruce Cardyn said steadily. "She is not my
sister, she is not old Squire Daventry's granddaughter, but an
impostor who successfully deceived poor Lady Anne. An actress known
as Daisy Melville."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p>Dorothy tore her hands from Cardyn's.</p>

<p>"It is not true! She is Margaret Balmaine. Do you think she
could have lived with us all this time and none of us have found
out?"</p>

<p>"I think it is quite possible," Bruce said steadily. "The facts
prove that it is so. The real Margaret Balmaine&mdash;Dorothy, you
must remember, naturally I knew that this girl was an impostor as
soon as I heard Lady Anne mention her name."</p>

<p>"But where is your sister? Why is she not here?"</p>

<p>"My sister&mdash;the real Margaret Balmaine&mdash;is dead."
Bruce paused a moment. "She was on the stage for a short time and
this girl who took her name and stole her papers was a great friend
of hers. She acted as Daisy Melville."</p>

<p>His words, the certainty of his tone, carried conviction home to
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Then, why," she demanded, "didn't you say so at once? Do you
think it was honest to let her remain in Lady Anne Daventry's
house, knowing that she was an impostor?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was not," Cardyn conceded slowly. "But I was in a
difficult position. The impostor was firmly established there; I
could offer no proof that she was not what she seemed except my
bare word. And you must remember that was there in my professional
capacity at Lady Anne Daventry's request, to endeavour to safeguard
her life and to discover the secret murderer. I may say at once
that when I realized that Miss Balmaine was an impostor I at once
formed the opinion that she might be the guilty person, an opinion
that was strengthened by the discovery that she was carrying on an
intrigue with David Branksome, my predecessor."</p>

<p>Dorothy shivered a little, recalling her own early instinctive
shrinking from Margaret Balmaine, a shrinking repugnance that she
had almost forgotten of late.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I see," she murmured. "But you said&mdash;it was not
she who&mdash;that you did not think that it was she who&mdash;who
stabbed Aunt Anne."</p>

<p>"I said I was not aware that anything had been discovered to
connect her with the crime," Cardyn corrected.</p>

<p>"As I am," Dorothy said bitterly. "Mr. Cardyn, tell me truly,
you don't really believe this preposterous story of Inspector
Furnival's that one of us&mdash;of those five people in the room
really murdered Aunt Anne?"</p>

<p>Bruce Cardyn's eyes looked away from her and wandered round the
room, rested on the table against which Margaret Balmaine had so
lately stood.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he said slowly. "I never have known. I hope
not."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is dreadful&mdash;dreadful!" Dorothy said passionately.
"Nobody is ever sure of anything and one doubts
everybody&mdash;even oneself. There are times when I wake up in the
night and ask myself whether this horror can possibly be true.
There are times again when I ask myself over and over again who
could have killed Aunt Anne, and I think and think and think until
I doubt every one&mdash;even myself. You know Inspector Furnival
thinks I did it because I wanted money." Her voice broke.</p>

<p>"You poor child!" Cardyn caught her hands in his. "He does not
think&mdash;no sane person could possibly think&mdash;that you knew
anything&mdash;that you could possibly be even remotely concerned
with anything so terrible. It is just&mdash;can't you see that it
is only because the inspector is bound to make inquiries about
every one of us&mdash;that you are brought into the question at
all. Otherwise nobody would ever have dreamed of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Indeed he would&mdash;the inspector would," Dorothy
said positively. "He would have found that letter of mine all the
same and he would have said I had killed her to inherit the jewels.
I can't think why he cannot realize&mdash;cannot believe that it
was&mdash;it must have been&mdash;an outsider. Don't you think it
was that Cat Burglar?" There was some new quality in her tone as
she glanced anxiously at Cardyn.</p>

<p>He avoided her glance. "I do not see how the Cat Burglar could
have got to the window."</p>

<p>"But you know he did! Don't you think he was guilty?" persisted
Dorothy.</p>

<p>Thus driven, Cardyn had to speak out plainly.</p>

<p>"No, I do not. I never have thought it was the Cat Burglar."</p>

<p>Meeting his eyes Dorothy shivered from head to foot. Was some
new horror coming upon her? She tore her hands from his clasp and
crossing over to the window laid her aching head against the cool
wood of the frame.</p>

<p>"I wish I had died with Aunt Anne," she said bitterly.</p>

<p>Cardyn followed her after a minute's pause.</p>

<p>"Dear, you have been very brave so far through this sad time.
You must be brave a little longer for the sake of those who love
you."</p>

<p>His tone, his words brought a little measure of comfort to
Dorothy. Despise his profession as she might, there were times when
she could not forget that he was the hero who had saved her from
the fire, whose memory she had secretly cherished until Inspector
Furnival's words had rudely awakened her from her dream.</p>

<p>She gave a little sob. "You say a little longer, but it goes on
day after day, week after week, month after month&mdash;why
shouldn't it be for year after year? We can none of us do anything,
we can none of us think of anything else."</p>

<p>"I wish I could help you&mdash;'' Cardyn was beginning when the
door opened again and Mr. Fyvert looked in. His broad, mild face
looked troubled.</p>

<p>"Dorothy, my child, will you go to your aunt? She seems very
unwell to-night, and&mdash;er&mdash;don't say anything to her about
this new trouble regarding Margaret. I have told her she has been
called out to see some friends. That is quite enough until we know
more."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Augustus." Dorothy hesitated a moment, glanced from
her uncle to Cardyn, opened her lips as if to speak, then, changing
her mind, went quickly out of the room.</p>

<p>The rector stood aside, then he closed the door carefully and
came across to Bruce, walking with a silent cat-like tread, curious
in so large a person.</p>

<p>"The inspector writes to me that the mystery surrounding my poor
sister's death is to be solved to-night. He tells me to come round
to her house in Charlton Crescent and to bring you with me. 'At
once,' he says in his note; at least"&mdash;referring to a paper he
produced&mdash;"he says 'as soon as you get this.' And this was
brought to me a minute or two ago by a man in plain clothes whom I
conceived to be a detective."</p>

<p>"Then we had better start at once," Cardyn said quietly.</p>

<p>It was noticeable that he did not ask to see the inspector's
note, neither did Mr. Fyvert offer to show it to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Fyvert indeed preserved a silence most unusual for him. He
did not speak again until they were getting into their taxi. Then
he said, his pompous tones unusually subdued:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;conclude that when Inspector Furnival speaks
of&mdash;er&mdash;that terrible mystery being solved, he has
discovered the murderer?"</p>

<p>"It seems probable," Bruce assented.</p>

<p>"I presume that it has turned out to be the Cat Burglar after
all," Mr. Fyvert went on. "Or some member of the criminal classes
who had concealed himself in the house for the purpose of robbery
and&mdash;er&mdash;rushed in when you were all looking out of the
window. I must say incline to the latter theory myself."</p>

<p>He turned inquiringly to Bruce, who bent his head, with a
murmured assent, looking the while supremely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Mr. Fyvert glanced at him curiously, but he did not speak again
as the taxi glided swiftly up to the house in Charlton Crescent. As
they entered the Crescent Cardyn saw that there were men in plain
clothes at both ends and also near Lady Anne Daventry's door. Was
an arrest to be effected here and now he asked himself, and even
his dark face paled as he pictured the scene that might be
coming.</p>

<p>Mr. Fyvert, of course, noticed nothing, but as they went up the
steps and the door was opened for them by a strange man he looked
round uneasily The inspector met them in the hall.</p>

<p>"I am glad you could come, Mr. Fyvert. It is best that one of
the family should&mdash;understand."</p>

<p>"Quite so! Though I can't say that I do understand at all at
present," the rector said plaintively. "What, for instance, has
become of that unhappy girl who called herself Margaret
Balmaine?"</p>

<p>"She and her lover, or her husband, as we have good reason to
think he is&mdash;David Branksome&mdash;will be brought before the
magistrates in the morning charged with stealing the late Lady
Anne's pearls," the inspector said gruffly. "Come this way, please,
Mr. Fyvert, and you, Mr. Cardyn."</p>

<p>He opened the library door and ushered them in, and with a
murmured apology stepped back into the hall.</p>

<p>"Well, really, I cannot understand&mdash;" Mr. Fyvert was
beginning helplessly. "I cannot understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke another taxi drove up and in a very few
minutes Inspector Furnival reappeared.</p>

<p>"This way, please, Mr. Soames," he said in his most genial tones
as he ushered three men into the room.</p>

<p>Two of them were tall and upstanding and looked as if they would
have been more at home in uniform&mdash;the one between them Bruce
stared at and then rubbed his eyes and stared again. But for the
inspector's words he would not have recognized the once
consequential, imposing-looking butler of the late Lady Anne
Daventry in this bent, prematurely-aged man. The Soames whom Cardyn
had seen a hundred times in this very room had always walked in a
slow, dignified fashion, shoulders well drawn up and, in figure, a
little protruding beneath his waistcoat. This Soames tottering in
between the two police officers seemed to have shrunk visibly, his
cheeks had fallen in, his eyes, turning miserably from side to
side, refused to meet any of those amazed ones fixed upon him.</p>

<p>He slunk past Mr. Fyvert, who stepped forward as if to intercept
him, and shrank like a dumb animal into the darkest part of the
room.</p>

<p>The rector of North Coton turned his astonished eyes upon
Inspector Furnival.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, inspector? My poor sister trusted Soames
implicitly."</p>

<p>"Ah! Many of us do trust people implicitly, and many of us find
ourselves let down pretty badly," the inspector remarked
enigmatically. "But very soon we shall know more, Mr. Fyvert. We
are expecting one more arrival and then we will set to work."</p>

<p>"One more arrival!" echoed Mr. Fyvert. "Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>The inspector held up his hand. The hoot of a private car was
heard as it turned into the Crescent. Another moment and it had
stopped before the door of the house they were in. In the silence
induced by the inspector's upheld hand, they heard some one spring
out of the car and run up the steps. The bell and knocker were
sounded together and a moment later the door was thrown open and a
tall man stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. John Daventry, you are just to time," said the
inspector easily.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p>"Always punctual," Daventry assented. "Learnt that in the
trenches. Ah, Mr. Fyvert"&mdash;taking off his motoring gloves and
throwing them on the table&mdash;"come to be in at the death like
me? Come, inspector, what did that urgent wire of yours mean? And
what in Heaven's name are you doing with all that bally rubbish?"
He pointed to the white mask with its mass of flimsy drapery
spreading out upon the table.</p>

<p>The inspector held the mask up gingerly on his forefinger.</p>

<p>"The white face that looked through the window the evening a
certain deed of darkness was done, Mr. Daventry."</p>

<p>"What! the Cat Burglar?" John Daventry burst into one of his
laughs, causing the rector of North Coton to look at him
reprovingly. "Was he masked? You know I always told you,
inspector&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was no Cat Burglar," the inspector said gravely. "There
was no one at the window at all. There was nothing but a silly
trick played by a naughty child and a girl who ought to have known
better. This 'bally rubbish,' Mr. Daventry, was lowered from the
window of the room above and by attracting everybody in the room to
the window gave the murderer time to accomplish his design."</p>

<p>"Maureen and Alice! By Jove!" And Daventry slapped his thigh
with another guffaw. "I never gave them credit for so much
iniquity. And who was the murderer who rushed in and accomplished
his fell design, inspector? That is the most interesting point.
Have you got him?"</p>

<p>"I think so!" said the inspector quietly. He stood aside and
revealed the shivering Soames, whom he had been purposely
concealing from Daventry's view.</p>

<p>A curious change visible only to the closest observer passed
over John Daventry's face. For a moment he seemed to stiffen, like
a man who had received a blow in the face.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;old Soames! Bless my life, inspector, what nonsense
are you up to?" Then he turned aside and blew his nose vigorously.
"Upon my soul, inspector, how you could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. John, Mr. John!" The words came from Soames, though the
hoarse thickened voice was in odd contrast with the butler's
erstwhile self-sufficient tones.</p>

<p>They all stared at him, John Daventry among them. The man's
mottled face was quivering, his bloodshot eyes were watering, the
loose lips were working, twitching, the shoulders were hunching
themselves up, the whole man seemed on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>"Mr. John&mdash;I couldn't help it&mdash;I never meant it. I was
forced&mdash;I was tricked&mdash;" The uneven voice broke off in a
gurgle, the ghastly face was hidden by a pair of trembling
hands.</p>

<p>A great silence fell upon them all in the room. Even Inspector
Furnival and Bruce Cardyn, hardened criminal hunters though they
were, felt their breathing quicken.</p>

<p>A loud guffaw from John Daventry broke across the stillness with
the force of an electric shock.</p>

<p>"So the game's up, is it, old Soames? I guessed it would be when
the inspector guessed the Cat Burglar business. Don't worry, old
chap. You have done your best! Inspector, I congratulate you!"</p>

<p>Something jingled in the inspector's hands, the next moment it
was round John Daventry's wrist and the room seemed instantly full
of men in plain clothes surrounding them both.</p>

<p>"John William Daventry"&mdash;the inspector's stern voice
dominated them all&mdash;"I arrest you for the wilful murder of
Anne Georgina Dorothea Daventry in this house on the evening of
January&mdash;. And it is my duty to warn you that anything you say will
be taken down in writing and may be used in evidence against
you."</p>

<p>"You bet it will!" Again that loud laugh of Daventry's rang
through the room. "Damn it all man, I can see when the game is up.
And I don't know that I care much. It seemed a wicked shame that
that old woman should go on living&mdash;a life that was no good to
herself or anyone else. Stingy old beggar too. Made as much fuss
about lending a chap a few pounds as though she hadn't got any
amount of shekels tucked away in the bank. Seemed as if she was
going to live for ever, and that beastly rheumatism doesn't kill. I
might have been too old to enjoy the stuff when it did come. So I
took the matter in my own hands. But it hasn't done me much good
and I don't know that I'm sorry it has ended as it has. Sometimes
in the night I have seen the old thing's eyes looking up at me as
they did when I stuck the dagger in. So that is the end, inspector.
And don't touch old Soames. He knew nothing about it until it was
all over, when he saw me taking my hand from the dagger. But you
won't have your sensational trial, inspector. I have laid my plans
too well for that! Good-bye, everybody. It is going over the top of
the trench a bit before my time, that is all." With the last words
he staggered against the wall.</p>

<p>"Poison&mdash;that handkerchief! And I never thought of it?" the
inspector explained as he and another man caught up the
prisoner.</p>

<p>"Good old blow, wasn't it?" Daventry managed to get the words
out as the men surrounded him. "You will find the half of a tablet
there that would kill a dozen men, inspector."</p>

<p>The words were haltingly spoken. The hue of death was spreading
over the handsome features. The policemen laid him back on the
couch; the eyes were glazing over, the breath was failing.</p>

<p>Soames stumbled forward and fell beside him.</p>

<p>"Mr. John! Mr. John&mdash;you'd never have done it in your right
mind. It was the gas and the shells in that accursed war! Up there
they'll know it all&mdash;and understand."</p>

<p>And that was the requiem of John Daventry.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"Oh, a terrible affair, terrible!" the rector of North Coton
said. "And, inspector, I hear that the poor boy's grandmother on
the maternal side had periodical attacks of insanity. I take it
that the poor fellow must have inherited the taint."</p>

<p>"Perhaps." The inspector's tone was doubtful.</p>

<p>All that was mortal of John Daventry had been laid to rest in
the churchyard at Daventry nearly a month ago. And Mr. Fyvert and
the inspector were just "tidying up," as the inspector phrased it,
in the library at Charlton Crescent.</p>

<p>"There was that terrible shell shock too that he got in the
trenches," the rector pursued. "He and a party of his men were
buried by the explosion of a shell close at hand and had to be dug
out. Then he was badly gassed. Such experiences must leave their
mark, you know, inspector. John Daventry could not be looked upon
as accountable for his actions."</p>

<p>The inspector's face was very grave. He made no motion of
assent. Presently Mr. Fyvert went on: "How was it that you
suspected him, inspector? For I gather that you did suspect
him."</p>

<p>"It was fairly obvious, was it not?" the inspector said with a
sarcasm that was lost upon the rector. "Well, I may say that I did
not think of him at first. My suspicions were divided between that
unhappy girl, Branksome's wife&mdash;whom very early in the
proceedings I discovered to be an impostor&mdash;and Soames. It was
very soon obvious that the butler was either guilty himself or
screening some one. The footprints on the border to which he drew
my attention were a clumsy device; he has since confessed that he
used an old pair of Branksome's shoes to make them, fastening them
firmly to a pole and leaning from the window to stamp them on the
soft earth beneath."</p>

<p>The rector's mild eyes opened wide. "What an extraordinary
device! It would never have occurred to me."</p>

<p>"I am sure it would not," the inspector agreed heartily, a faint
twinkle in his eye. "Then I found out that Soames had been for some
time in a chemist's shop in his youth. That would have given him
the knowledge necessary for the making up of the hyoscine
pill&mdash;the poison in the milk. Pirnie suspected him too. It
seems she thought that while he was philandering with her he had
taken the opportunity to poison the milk. However, she knows the
truth now and they have made it up. So that is all right. And I
discovered that both John Daventry and Lady Anne's eldest son,
Christopher had had a turn that way and had messed about with drugs
a good deal as boys under Soames's tuition. That I think first
turned my suspicions definitely to John Daventry. He knew about the
attempted secret poisoning of Lady Anne and he did not tell us of
Soames's knowledge."</p>

<p>"I cannot think that poor John knew anything of the attempted
poisoning," remarked Mr. Fyvert fatuously.</p>

<p>The inspector contented himself with raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Then again he had obviously fallen in love with the pretended
Miss Balmaine," he pursued. "That provided an additional motive.
Though no doubt his financial difficulties were the principal. My
very definite suspicion became a certainty when I taxed Soames with
his share in the matter."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! I see!" The rector blew his nose vigorously. "Poor
John&mdash;poor John! Well I think it may be said that gassed and
shellshocked as he had been he gave his life for his country as
truly as any of those who fell on the field of battle. I am sure my
poor sister will agree with me with the clearer vision of
Eternity."</p>

<p>The inspector coughed dubiously. "I hope so."</p>

<p>"And that unhappy girl&mdash;David Branksome's wife?" questioned
Mr. Fyvert after a pause.</p>

<p>"David Branksome himself is a professional crook," Inspector
Furnival answered. "His wife is an actress who successfully made up
to impersonate Lady Anne. She dressed at her husband's lodgings
where I found most of the garments. But the gown she made herself
at Charlton Crescent and kept there. She it was who stole the diary
with the help of her husband's instruments, and he managed to get
the pearls while he was secretary to Lady Anne. The pearls, of
course, were their principal objective; but there can be no doubt
that they hoped to obtain other jewellery, and it was their desire
to possess themselves of the diamonds that led to their undoing,
since they might have got off safely with the pearls."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! It is all very sad and terrible," sighed
the rector. "That child Maureen, too, has probably injured herself
for life by that foolish trick with the mask. Oh, I am very much
afraid so." As the inspector made a gesture of dissent. "They are
going to take her abroad very soon&mdash;the sister and Mr. Cardyn,
for I dare say you will be surprised to hear that they&mdash;Miss
Fyvert and Bruce Cardyn&mdash;are going to be married very quietly
and quite soon."</p>

<p>The inspector raised his eyebrows. "Indeed! I had not
heard."</p>

<p>"No? It may seem soon after all&mdash;the&mdash;the trouble. But
it is quite a long standing attachment, they tell me, and they are
anxious to get away from all this talk of 'the five' and the
tragedy altogether. Still, most people are surprised like you,
inspector. For myself&mdash;I suppose my profession renders me
unusually observant&mdash;I was expecting the announcement, from
various little signs that have noticed."</p>

<p>The inspector made no rejoinder, but later on when the rector
had gone, he said to himself, rubbing his nose reflectively,
"Wonder <i>what</i> he noticed. Profession made him observant, has
it? About as observant as Balaam, I should think, when the ass had
to speak to make him stop. And the ass would have had to shout
pretty loud to stop the rector of North Coton."</p>
