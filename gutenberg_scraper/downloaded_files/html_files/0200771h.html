<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. THE COMMON READER</h2>

<p>There is a sentence in Dr. Johnson's Gray which might well be
written up in all those rooms, too humble to be called libraries,
yet full of books, where the pursuit of reading is carried on by
private people. "...I rejoice to concur with the common reader; for
by the common sense of readers, uncorrupted by literary prejudices,
after all the refinements of subtilty and the dogmatism of
learning, must be finally decided all claim to poetical honours."
It defines their qualities; it dignifies their aims; it bestows
upon a pursuit which devours a great deal of time, and is yet apt
to leave behind it nothing very substantial, the sanction of the
great man's approval.</p>

<p>The common reader, as Dr. Johnson implies, differs from the
critic and the scholar. He is worse educated, and nature has not
gifted him so generously. He reads for his own pleasure rather than
to impart knowledge or correct the opinions of others. Above all,
he is guided by an instinct to create for himself, out of whatever
odds and ends he can come by, some kind of whole&mdash;a portrait
of a man, a sketch of an age, a theory of the art of writing. He
never ceases, as he reads, to run up some rickety and ramshackle
fabric which shall give him the temporary satisfaction of looking
sufficiently like the real object to allow of affection, laughter,
and argument. Hasty, inaccurate, and superficial, snatching now
this poem, now that scrap of old furniture, without caring where he
finds it or of what nature it may be so long as it serves his
purpose and rounds his structure, his deficiencies as a critic are
too obvious to be pointed out; but if he has, as Dr. Johnson
maintained, some say in the final distribution of poetical honours,
then, perhaps, it may be worth while to write down a few of the
ideas and opinions which, insignificant in themselves, yet
contribute to so mighty a result.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. "JANE EYRE" AND "WUTHERING
HEIGHTS"</h2>

<p>Of the hundred years that have passed since Charlotte Bronte was
born, she, the centre now of so much legend, devotion, and
literature, lived but thirty-nine. It is strange to reflect how
different those legends might have been had her life reached the
ordinary human span. She might have become, like some of her famous
contemporaries, a figure familiarly met with in London and
elsewhere, the subject of pictures and anecdotes innumerable, the
writer of many novels, of memoirs possibly, removed from us well
within the memory of the middle-aged in all the splendour of
established fame. She might have been wealthy, she might have been
prosperous. But it is not so. When we think of her we have to
imagine some one who had no lot in our modern world; we have to
cast our minds back to the 'fifties of the last century, to a
remote parsonage upon the wild Yorkshire moors. In that parsonage,
and on those moors, unhappy and lonely, in her poverty and her
exaltation, she remains for ever.</p>

<p>These circumstances, as they affected her character, may have
left their traces on her work. A novelist, we reflect, is bound to
build up his structure with much very perishable material which
begins by lending it reality and ends by cumbering it with rubbish.
As we open <i>Jayne Eyre</i> once more we cannot stifle the
suspicion that we shall find her world of imagination as
antiquated, mid-Victorian, and out of date as the parsonage on the
moor, a place only to be visited by the curious, only preserved by
the pious. So we open <i>Jayne Eyre</i>; and in two pages every
doubt is swept clean from our minds.</p>

<blockquote>Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right
hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but
not separating me from the drear November day. At intervals, while
turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that
winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud;
near, a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain
sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable
blast.</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing there more perishable than the moor itself, or
more subject to the sway of fashion than the "long and lamentable
blast". Nor is this exhilaration short-lived. It rushes us through
the entire volume, without giving us time to think, without letting
us lift our eyes from the page. So intense is our absorption that
if some one moves in the room the movement seems to take place not
there but up in Yorkshire. The writer has us by the hand, forces us
along her road, makes us see what she sees, never leaves us for a
moment or allows us to forget her. At the end we are steeped
through and through with the genius, the vehemence, the indignation
of Charlotte Bronte. Remarkable faces, figures of strong outline
and gnarled feature have flashed upon us in passing; but it is
through her eyes that we have seen them. Once she is gone, we seek
for them in vain. Think of Rochester and we have to think of
<i>Jayne Eyre</i>. Think of the moor, and again there is <i>Jayne
Eyre</i>. Think of the drawing-room, [Note, below] even, those
"white carpets on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers",
that "pale Parian mantelpiece" with its Bohemia glass of "ruby red"
and the "general blending of snow and fire"&mdash;what is all that
except <i>Jayne Eyre</i>?</p>

<p>[Note: Charlotte and Emily Brontë had much the same sense of
colour. "...we saw&mdash;ah! it was beautiful&mdash;a splendid
place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables,
and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass drops
hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with
little soft tapers" (<i>Wuthering Heights</i>). "Yet it was merely
a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread
with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of
flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine
leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and
ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were
of sparkling Bohemia glass, ruby red; and between the windows large
mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire" (<i>Jane
Eyre</i>).]</p>

<p>The drawbacks of being Jane Eyre are not far to seek. Always to
be a governess and always to be in love is a serious limitation in
a world which is full, after all, of people who are neither one nor
the other. The characters of a Jane Austen or of a Tolstoi have a
million facets compared with these. They live and are complex by
means of their effect upon many different people who serve to
mirror them in the round. They move hither and thither whether
their creators watch them or not, and the world in which they live
seems to us an independent world which we can visit, now that they
have created it, by ourselves. Thomas Hardy is more akin to
Charlotte Bronte in the power of his personality and the narrowness
of his vision. But the differences are vast. As we read <i>Jude the
Obscure</i> we are not rushed to a finish; we brood and ponder and
drift away from the text in plethoric trains of thought which build
up round the characters an atmosphere of question and suggestion of
which they are themselves, as often as not, unconscious. Simple
peasants as they are, we are forced to confront them with destinies
and questionings of the hugest import, so that often it seems as if
the most important characters in a Hardy novel are those which have
no names. Of this power, of this speculative curiosity, Charlotte
Brontë has no trace. She does not attempt to solve the problems of
human life; she is even unaware that such problems exist; all her
force, and it is the more tremendous for being constricted, goes
into the assertion, "I love", "I hate", "I suffer".</p>

<p>For the self-centred and self-limited writers have a power
denied the more catholic and broad-minded. Their impressions are
close packed and strongly stamped between their narrow walls.
Nothing issues from their minds which has not been marked with
their own impress. They learn little from other writers, and what
they adopt they cannot assimilate. Both Hardy and Charlotte Brontë
appear to have founded their styles upon a stiff and decorous
journalism. The staple of their prose is awkward and unyielding.
But both with labour and the most obstinate integrity, by thinking
every thought until it has subdued words to itself, have forged for
themselves a prose which takes the mould of their minds entire;
which has, into the bargain, a beauty, a power, a swiftness of its
own. Charlotte Brontë, at least, owed nothing to the reading of
many books. She never learnt the smoothness of the professional
writer, or acquired his ability to stuff and sway his language as
he chooses. "I could never rest in communication with strong,
discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female", she writes,
as any leader-writer in a provincial journal might have written;
but gathering fire and speed goes on in her own authentic voice
"till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve and crossed
the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their hearts' very
hearthstone". It is there that she takes her seat; it is the red
and fitful glow of the heart's fire which illumines her page. In
other words, we read Charlotte Brontë not for exquisite observation
of character&mdash;her characters are vigorous and elementary; not
for comedy&mdash;hers is grim and crude; not for a philosophic view
of life&mdash;hers is that of a country parson's daughter; but for
her poetry. Probably that is so with all writers who have, as she
has, an overpowering personality, so that, as we say in real life,
they have only to open the door to make themselves felt. There is
in them some untamed ferocity perpetually at war with the accepted
order of things which makes them desire to create instantly rather
than to observe patiently. This very ardour, rejecting half shades
and other minor impediments, wings its way past the daily conduct
of ordinary people and allies itself with their more inarticulate
passions. It makes them poets, or, if they choose to write in
prose, intolerant of its restrictions. Hence it is that both Emily
and Charlotte are always invoking the help of nature. They both
feel the need of some more powerful symbol of the vast and
slumbering passions in human nature than words or actions can
convey. It is with a description of a storm that Charlotte ends her
finest novel <i>Villette</i>. "The skies hang full and dark&mdash;a
wrack sails from the west; the clouds cast themselves into strange
forms." So she calls in nature to describe a state of mind which
could not otherwise be expressed. But neither of the sisters
observed nature accurately as Dorothy Wordsworth observed it, or
painted it minutely as Tennyson painted it. They seized those
aspects of the earth which were most akin to what they themselves
felt or imputed to their characters, and so their storms, their
moors, their lovely spaces of summer weather are not ornaments
applied to decorate a dull page or display the writer's powers of
observation-they carry on the emotion and light up the meaning of
the book.</p>

<p>The meaning of a book, which lies so often apart from what
happens and what is said and consists rather in some connection
which things in themselves different have had for the writer, is
necessarily hard to grasp. Especially this is so when, like the
Brontës, the writer is poetic, and his meaning inseparable from his
language, and itself rather a mood than a particular observation.
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> is a more difficult book to understand
than <i>Jayne Eyre</i>, because Emily was a greater poet than
Charlotte. When Charlotte wrote she said with eloquence and
splendour and passion "I love", "I hate", "I suffer". Her
experience, though more intense, is on a level with our own. But
there is no "I" in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>. There are no
governesses. There are no employers. There is love, but it is not
the love of men and women. Emily was inspired by some more general
conception. The impulse which urged her to create was not her own
suffering or her own injuries. She looked out upon a world cleft
into gigantic disorder and felt within her the power to unite it in
a book. That gigantic ambition is to be felt throughout the
novel&mdash;a struggle, half thwarted but of superb conviction, to
say something through the mouths of her characters which is not
merely "I love" or "I hate", but "we, the whole human race " and
"you, the eternal powers..." the sentence remains unfinished. It is
not strange that it should be so; rather it is astonishing that she
can make us feel what she had it in her to say at all. It surges up
in the half-articulate words of Catherine Earnshaw, "If all else
perished and <i>he</i> remained, I should still continue to be; and
if all else remained and he were annihilated, the universe would
turn to a mighty stranger; I should not seem part of it". It breaks
out again in the presence of the dead. I see a repose that neither
earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless
and shadowless hereafter&mdash;the eternity they have
entered&mdash;where life is boundless in its duration, and love in
its sympathy and joy in its fulness." It is this suggestion of
power underlying the apparitions of human nature and lifting them
up into the presence of greatness that gives the book its huge
stature among other novels. But it was not enough for Emily Brontë
to write a few lyrics, to utter a cry, to express a creed. In her
poems she did this once and for all, and her poems will perhaps
outlast her novel. But she was novelist as well as poet. She must
take upon herself a more laborious and a more ungrateful task. She
must face the fact of other existences, grapple with the mechanism
of external things, build up, in recognisable shape, farms and
houses and report the speeches of men and women who existed
independently of herself. And so we reach these summits of emotion
not by rant or rhapsody but by hearing a girl sing old songs to
herself as she rocks in the branches of a tree; by watching the
moor sheep crop the turf; by listening to the soft wind breathing
through the grass. The life at the farm with all its absurdities
and its improbability is laid open to us. We are given every
opportunity of comparing <i>Wuthering Heights</i> with a real farm
and Heathcliff with a real man. How, we are allowed to ask, can
there be truth or insight or the finer shades of emotion in men and
women who so little resemble what we have seen ourselves? But even
as we ask it we see in Heathcliff the brother that a sister of
genius might have seen; he is impossible we say, but nevertheless
no boy in literature has a more vivid existence than his. So it is
with the two Catherines; never could women feel as they do or act
in their manner, we say. All the same, they are the most lovable
women in English fiction. It is as if she could tear up all that we
know human beings by, and fill these unrecognisable transparences
with such a gust of life that they transcend reality. Hers, then,
is the rarest of all powers. She could free life from its
dependence on facts; with a few touches indicate the spirit of a
face so that it needs no body; by speaking of the moor make the
wind blow and the thunder roar</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. THE PATRON AND THE CROCUS</h2>

<p>Young men and women beginning to write are generally given the
plausible but utterly impracticable advice to write what they have
to write as shortly as possible, as clearly as possible, and
without other thought in their minds except to say exactly what is
in them. Nobody ever adds on these occasions the one thing needful:
"And be sure you choose your patron wisely", though that is the
gist of the whole matter. For a book is always written for somebody
to read, and, since the patron is not merely the paymaster, but
also in a very subtle and insidious way the instigator and inspirer
of what is written, it is of the utmost importance that he should
be a desirable man.</p>

<p>But who, then, is the desirable man&mdash;the patron who will
cajole the best out of the writer's brain and bring to birth the
most varied and vigorous progeny of which he is capable? Different
ages have answered the question differently. The Elizabethans, to
speak roughly, chose the aristocracy to write for and the playhouse
public. The eighteenth-century patron was a combination of
coffee-house wit and Grub Street bookseller. In the nineteenth
century the great writers wrote for the half-crown magazines and
the leisured classes. And looking back and applauding the splendid
results of these different alliances, it all seems enviably simple,
and plain as a pikestaff compared with our own
predicament&mdash;for whom should we write? For the present supply
of patrons is of unexampled and bewildering variety. There is the
daily Press, the weekly Press, the monthly Press; the English
public and the American public; the best-seller public and the
worst-seller public; the highbrow public and the red-blood public;
all now organised self-conscious entities capable through their
various mouthpieces of making their needs known and their approval
or displeasure felt. Thus the writer who has been moved by the
sight of the first crocus in Kensington Gardens has, before he sets
pen to paper, to choose from a crowd of competitors the particular
patron who suits him best. It is futile to say, "Dismiss them all;
think only of your crocus", because writing is a method of
communication; and the crocus is an imperfect crocus until it has
been shared. The first man or the last may write for himself alone,
but he is an exception and an unenviable one at that, and the gulls
are welcome to his works if the gulls can read them.</p>

<p>Granted, then, that every writer has some public or other at the
end of his pen, the high-minded will say that it should be a
submissive public, accepting obediently whatever he likes to give
it. Plausible as the theory sounds, great risks are attached to it.
For in that case the writer remains conscious of his public, yet is
superior to it&mdash;an uncomfortable and unfortunate combination,
as the works of Samuel Butler, George Meredith, and Henry James may
be taken to prove. Each despised the public; each desired a public;
each failed to attain a public; and each wreaked his failure upon
the public by a succession, gradually increasing in intensity, of
angularities, obscurities, and affectations which no writer whose
patron was his equal and friend would have thought it necessary to
inflict. Their crocuses, in consequence, are tortured plants,
beautiful and bright, but with something wry-necked about them,
malformed, shrivelled on the one side, overblown on the other. A
touch of the sun would have done them a world of good. Shall we
then rush to the opposite extreme and accept (if in fancy alone)
the flattering proposals which the editors of the Times and the
Daily News may be supposed to make us&mdash;"Twenty pounds down for
your crocus in precisely fifteen hundred words, which shall blossom
upon every breakfast table from John o' Groats to the Land's End
before nine o'clock to-morrow morning with the writer's name
attached"?</p>

<p>But will one crocus be enough, and must it not be a very
brilliant yellow to shine so far, to cost so much, and to have
one's name attached to it? The Press is undoubtedly a great
multiplier of crocuses. But if we look at some of these plants, we
shall find that they are only very distantly related to the
original little yellow or purple flower which pokes up through the
grass in Kensington Gardens early in March every year. The
newspaper crocus is an amazing but still a very different plant. It
fills precisely the space allotted to it. It radiates a golden
glow. It is genial, affable, warm-hearted. It is beautifully
finished, too, for let nobody think that the art of "our dramatic
critic" of the Times or of Mr. Lynd of the Daily News is an easy
one. It is no despicable feat to start a million brains running at
nine o'clock in the morning, to give two million eyes something
bright and brisk and amusing to look at. But the night comes and
these flowers fade. So little bits of glass lose their lustre if
you take them out of the sea; great prima donnas howl like hyenas
if you shut them up in telephone boxes; and the most brilliant of
articles when removed from its element is dust and sand and the
husks of straw. Journalism embalmed in a book is unreadable.</p>

<p>The patron we want, then, is one who will help us to preserve
our flowers from decay. But as his qualities change from age to
age, and it needs considerable integrity and conviction not to be
dazzled by the pretensions or bamboozled by the persuasions of the
competing crowd, this business of patron-finding is one of the
tests and trials of authorship. To know whom to write for is to
know how to write. Some of the modern patron's qualities are,
however, fairly plain. The writer will require at this moment, it
is obvious, a patron with the book-reading habit rather than the
play-going habit. Nowadays, too, he must be instructed in the
literature of other times and races. But there are other qualities
which our special weaknesses and tendencies demand in him. There is
the question of indecency, for instance, which plagues us and
puzzles us much more than it did the Elizabethans. The
twentieth-century patron must be immune from shock. He must
distinguish infallibly between the little clod of manure which
sticks to the crocus of necessity, and that which is plastered to
it out of bravado. He must be a judge, too, of those social
influences which inevitably play so large a part in modern
literature, and able to say which matures and fortifies, which
inhibits and makes sterile. Further, there is emotion for him to
pronounce on, and in no department can he do more useful work than
in bracing a writer against sentimentality on the one hand and a
craven fear of expressing his feeling on the other. It is worse, he
will say, and perhaps more common, to be afraid of feeling than to
feel too much. He will add, perhaps, something about language, and
point out how many words Shakespeare used and how much grammar
Shakespeare violated, while we, though we keep our fingers so
demurely to the black notes on the piano, have not appreciably
improved upon <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>. And if you can forget
your sex altogether, he will say, so much the better; a writer has
none. But all this is by the way&mdash;elementary and disputable.
The patron's prime quality is something different, only to be
expressed perhaps by the use of that convenient word which cloaks
so much&mdash;atmosphere. It is necessary that the patron should
shed and envelop the crocus in an atmosphere which makes it appear
a plant of the very highest importance, so that to misrepresent it
is the one outrage not to be forgiven this side of the grave. He
must make us feel that a single crocus, if it be a real crocus, is
enough for him; that he does not want to be lectured, elevated,
instructed, or improved; that he is sorry that he bullied Carlyle
into vociferation, Tennyson into idyllics, and Ruskin into
insanity; that he is now ready to efface himself or assert himself
as his writers require; that he is bound to them by a more than
maternal tie; that they are twins indeed, one dying if the other
dies, one flourishing if the other flourishes; that the fate of
literature depends upon their happy alliance&mdash;all of which
proves, as we began by saying, that the choice of a patron is of
the highest importance. But how to choose rightly? How to write
well? Those are the questions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. THE MODERN ESSAY</h2>

<p>As Mr. Rhys truly says, it is unnecessary to go profoundly into
the history and origin of the essay&mdash;whether it derives from
Socrates or Siranney the Persian&mdash;since, like all living
things, its present is more important than its past. Moreover, the
family is widely spread; and while some of its representatives have
risen in the world and wear their coronets with the best, others
pick up a precarious living in the gutter near Fleet Street. The
form, too, admits variety. The essay can be short or long, serious
or trifling, about God and Spinoza, or about turtles and Cheapside.
But as we turn over the pages of these five little volumes,
[<i>Modern English Essays</i>, edited by Ernest Rhys, 5 vols.
(Dent).] containing essays written between 1870 and 1920, certain
principles appear to control the chaos, and we detect in the short
period under review something like the progress of history.</p>

<p>Of all forms of literature, however, the essay is the one which
least calls for the use of long words. The principle which controls
it is simply that it should give pleasure; the desire which impels
us when we take it from the shelf is simply to receive pleasure.
Everything in an essay must be subdued to that end. It should lay
us under a spell with its first word, and we should only wake,
refreshed, with its last. In the interval we may pass through the
most various experiences of amusement, surprise, interest,
indignation; we may soar to the heights of fantasy with Lamb or
plunge to the depths of wisdom with Bacon, but we must never be
roused. The essay must lap us about and draw its curtain across the
world.</p>

<p>So great a feat is seldom accomplished, though the fault may
well be as much on the reader's side as on the writer's. Habit and
lethargy have dulled his palate. A novel has a story, a poem rhyme;
but what art can the essayist use in these short lengths of prose
to sting us wide awake and fix us in a trance which is not sleep
but rather an intensification of life&mdash;a basking, with every
faculty alert, in the sun of pleasure? He must know&mdash;that is
the first essential&mdash;how to write. His learning may be as
profound as Mark Pattison's, but in an essay it must be so fused by
the magic of writing that not a fact juts out, not a dogma tears
the surface of the texture. Macaulay in one way, Froude in another,
did this superbly over and over again. They have blown more
knowledge into us in the course of one essay than the innumerable
chapters of a hundred text-books. But when Mark Pattison has to
tell us, in the space of thirty-five little pages, about Montaigne,
we feel that he had not previously assimilated M. Grün. M. Grün was
a gentleman who once wrote a bad book. M. Grün and his book should
have been embalmed for our perpetual delight in amber. But the
process is fatiguing; it requires more time and perhaps more temper
than Pattison had at his command. He served M. Grün up raw, and he
remains a crude berry among the cooked meats, upon which our teeth
must grate for ever. Something of the sort applies to Matthew
Arnold and a certain translator of Spinoza. Literal truth-telling
and finding fault with a culprit for his good are out of place in
an essay, where everything should be for our good and rather for
eternity than for the March number of the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>. But if the voice of the scold should never be heard in
this narrow plot, there is another voice which is as a plague of
locusts&mdash;the voice of a man stumbling drowsily among loose
words, clutching aimlessly at vague ideas, the voice, for example,
of Mr. Hutton in the following passage:</p>

<p>Add to this that his married life was very brief, only seven
years and a half, being unexpectedly cut short, and that his
passionate reverence for his wife's memory and genius&mdash;in his
own words, "a religion"&mdash;was one which, as he must have been
perfectly sensible, he could not make to appear otherwise than
extravagant, not to say an hallucination, in the eyes of the rest
of mankind, and yet that he was possessed by an irresistible
yearning to attempt to embody it in all the tender and enthusiastic
hyperbole of which it is so pathetic to find a man who gained his
fame by his "dry-light" a master, and it is impossible not to feel
that the human incidents in Mr. Mill's career are very sad.</p>

<p>A book could take that blow, but it sinks an essay. A biography
in two volumes is indeed the proper depository; for there, where
the licence is so much wider, and hints and glimpses of outside
things make part of the feast (we refer to the old type of
Victorian volume), these yawns and stretches hardly matter, and
have indeed some positive value of their own. But that value, which
is contributed by the reader, perhaps illicitly, in his desire to
get as much into the book from all possible sources as he can, must
be ruled out here.</p>

<p>There is no room for the impurities of literature in an essay.
Somehow or other, by dint of labour or bounty of nature, or both
combined, the essay must be pure&mdash;pure like water or pure like
wine, but pure from dullness, deadness, and deposits of extraneous
matter. Of all writers in the first volume, Walter Pater best
achieves this arduous task, because before setting out to write his
essay ("Notes on Leonardo da Vinci") he has somehow contrived to
get his material fused. He is a learned man, but it is not
knowledge of Leonardo that remains with us, but a vision, such as
we get in a good novel where everything contributes to bring the
writer's conception as a whole before us. Only here, in the essay,
where the bounds are so strict and facts have to be used in their
nakedness, the true writer like Walter Pater makes these
limitations yield their own quality. Truth will give it authority;
from its narrow limits he will get shape and intensity; and then
there is no more fitting place for some of those ornaments which
the old writers loved and we, by calling them ornaments, presumably
despise. Nowadays nobody would have the courage to embark on the
once famous description of Leonardo's lady who has</p>

<p>learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in deep
seas and keeps their fallen day about her; and trafficked for
strange webs with Eastern merchants; and, as Leda, was the mother
of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary...</p>

<p>The passage is too thumb-marked to slip naturally into the
context. But when we come unexpectedly upon "the smiling of women
and the motion of great waters", or upon "full of the refinement of
the dead, in sad, earth-coloured raiment, set with pale stones", we
suddenly remember that we have ears and we have eyes, and that the
English language fills a long array of stout volumes with
innumerable words, many of which are of more than one syllable. The
only living Englishman who ever looks into these volumes is, of
course, a gentleman of Polish extraction. But doubtless our
abstention saves us much gush, much rhetoric, much high-stepping
and cloud-prancing, and for the sake of the prevailing sobriety and
hard-headedness we should be willing to barter the splendour of Sir
Thomas Browne and the vigour of Swift.</p>

<p>Yet, if the essay admits more properly than biography or fiction
of sudden boldness and metaphor, and can be polished till every
atom of its surface shines, there are dangers in that too. We are
soon in sight of ornament. Soon the current, which is the
life-blood of literature, runs slow; and instead of sparkling and
flashing or moving with a quieter impulse which has a deeper
excitement, words coagulate together in frozen sprays which, like
the grapes on a Christmas-tree, glitter for a single night, but are
dusty and garish the day after. The temptation to decorate is great
where the theme may be of the slightest. What is there to interest
another in the fact that one has enjoyed a walking tour, or has
amused oneself by rambling down Cheapside and looking at the
turtles in Mr. Sweeting's shop window? Stevenson and Samuel Butler
chose very different methods of exciting our interest in these
domestic themes. Stevenson, of course, trimmed and polished and set
out his matter in the traditional eighteenth-century form. It is
admirably done, but we cannot help feeling anxious, as the essay
proceeds, lest the material may give out under the craftsman's
fingers. The ingot is so small, the manipulation so incessant. And
perhaps that is why the peroration</p>

<p>To sit still and contemplate&mdash;to remember the faces of
women without desire, to be pleased by the great deeds of men
without envy, to be everything and everywhere in sympathy and yet
content to remain where and what you are</p>

<p>has the sort of insubstantiality which suggests that by the time
he got to the end he had left himself nothing solid to work with.
Butler adopted the very opposite method. Think your own thoughts,
he seems to say, and speak them as plainly as you can. These
turtles in the shop window which appear to leak out of their shells
through heads and feet suggest a fatal faithfulness to a fixed
idea. And so, striding unconcernedly from one idea to the next, we
traverse a large stretch of ground; observe that a wound in the
solicitor is a very serious thing; that Mary Queen of Scots wears
surgical boots and is subject to fits near the Horse Shoe in
Tottenham Court Road; take it for granted that no one really cares
about Aeschylus; and so, with many amusing anecdotes and some
profound reflections, reach the peroration, which is that, as he
had been told not to see more in Cheapside than he could get into
twelve pages of the Universal Review, he had better stop. And yet
obviously Butler is at least as careful of our pleasure as
Stevenson; and to write like oneself and call it not writing is a
much harder exercise in style than to write like Addison and call
it writing well.</p>

<p>But, however much they differ individually, the Victorian
essayists yet had something in common. They wrote at greater length
than is now usual, and they wrote for a public which had not only
time to sit down to its magazine seriously, but a high, if
peculiarly Victorian, standard of culture by which to judge it. It
was worth while to speak out upon serious matters in an essay; and
there was nothing absurd in writing as well as one possibly could
when, in a month or two, the same public which had welcomed the
essay in a magazine would carefully read it once more in a book.
But a change came from a small audience of cultivated people to a
larger audience of people who were not quite so cultivated. The
change was not altogether for the worse. In volume iii. we find Mr.
Birrell and Mr. Beerbohm. It might even be said that there was a
reversion to the classic type, and that the essay by losing its
size and something of its sonority was approaching more nearly the
essay of Addison and Lamb. At any rate, there is a great gulf
between Mr. Birrell on Carlyle and the essay which one may suppose
that Carlyle would have written upon Mr. Birrell. There is little
similarity between <i>A Cloud of Pinafores</i>, by Max Beerbohm,
and <i>A Cynic's Apology</i>, by Leslie Stephen. But the essay is
alive; there is no reason to despair. As the conditions change so
the essayist, most sensitive of all plants to public opinion,
adapts himself, and if he is good makes the best of the change, and
if he is bad the worst. Mr. Birrell is certainly good; and so we
find that, though he has dropped a considerable amount of weight,
his attack is much more direct and his movement more supple. But
what did Mr. Beerbohm give to the essay and what did he take from
it? That is a much more complicated question, for here we have an
essayist who has concentrated on the work and is without doubt the
prince of his profession.</p>

<p>What Mr. Beerbohm gave was, of course, himself. This presence,
which has haunted the essay fitfully from the time of Montaigne,
had been in exile since the death of Charles Lamb. Matthew Arnold
was never to his readers Matt, nor Walter Pater affectionately
abbreviated in a thousand homes to Wat. They gave us much, but that
they did not give. Thus, some time in the nineties, it must have
surprised readers accustomed to exhortation, information, and
denunciation to find themselves familiarly addressed by a voice
which seemed to belong to a man no larger than themselves. He was
affected by private joys and sorrows, and had no gospel to preach
and no learning to impart. He was himself, simply and directly, and
himself he has remained. Once again we have an essayist capable of
using the essayist's most proper but most dangerous and delicate
tool. He has brought personality into literature, not unconsciously
and impurely, but so consciously and purely that we do not know
whether there is any relation between Max the essayist and Mr.
Beerbohm the man. We only know that the spirit of personality
permeates every word that he writes. The triumph is the triumph of
style. For it is only by knowing how to write that you can make use
in literature of your self; that self which, while it is essential
to literature, is also its most dangerous antagonist. Never to be
yourself and yet always&mdash;that is the problem. Some of the
essayists in Mr. Rhys' collection, to be frank, have not altogether
succeeded in solving it. We are nauseated by the sight of trivial
personalities decomposing in the eternity of print. As talk, no
doubt, it was charming, and certainly the writer is a good fellow
to meet over a bottle of beer. But literature is stern; it is no
use being charming, virtuous, or even learned and brilliant into
the bargain, unless, she seems to reiterate, you fulfil her first
condition&mdash;to know how to write.</p>

<p>This art is possessed to perfection by Mr. Beerbohm. But he has
not searched the dictionary for polysyllables. He has not moulded
firm periods or seduced our ears with intricate cadences and
strange melodies. Some of his companions&mdash;Henley and
Stevenson, for example&mdash;are momentarily more impressive. But
<i>A Cloud Of Pinafores</i> has in it that indescribable
inequality, stir, and final expressiveness which belong to life and
to life alone. You have not finished with it because you have read
it, any more than friendship is ended because it is time to part.
Life wells up and alters and adds. Even things in a book-case
change if they are alive; we find ourselves wanting to meet them
again; we find them altered. So we look back upon essay after essay
by Mr. Beerbohm, knowing that, come September or May, we shall sit
down with them and talk. Yet it is true that the essayist is the
most sensitive of all writers to public opinion. The drawing-room
is the place where a great deal of reading is done nowadays, and
the essays of Mr. Beerbohm lie, with an exquisite appreciation of
all that the position exacts, upon the drawing-room table. There is
no gin about; no strong tobacco; no puns, drunkenness, or insanity.
Ladies and gentlemen talk together, and some things, of course, are
not said.</p>

<p>But if it would be foolish to attempt to confine Mr. Beerbohm to
one room, it would be still more foolish, unhappily, to make him,
the artist, the man who gives us only his best, the representative
of our age. There are no essays by Mr. Beerbohm in the fourth or
fifth volumes of the present collection. His age seems already a
little distant, and the drawing-room table, as it recedes, begins
to look rather like an altar where, once upon a time, people
deposited offerings&mdash;fruit from their own orchards, gifts
carved with their own hands. Now once more the conditions have
changed. The public needs essays as much as ever, and perhaps even
more. The demand for the light middle not exceeding fifteen hundred
words, or in special cases seventeen hundred and fifty, much
exceeds the supply. Where Lamb wrote one essay and Max perhaps
writes two, Mr. Belloc at a rough computation produces three
hundred and sixty-five. They are very short, it is true. Yet with
what dexterity the practised essayist will utilise his
space&mdash;beginning as close to the top of the sheet as possible,
judging precisely how far to go, when to turn, and how, without
sacrificing a hair's-breadth of paper, to wheel about and alight
accurately upon the last word his editor allows! As a feat of skill
it is well worth watching. But the personality upon which Mr.
Belloc, like Mr. Beerbohm, depends suffers in the process. It comes
to us not with the natural richness of the speaking voice, but
strained and thin and full of mannerisms and affectations, like the
voice of a man shouting through a megaphone to a crowd on a windy
day. "Little friends, my readers", he says in the essay called "An
Unknown Country", and he goes on to tell us how</p>

<p>There was a shepherd the other day at Findon Fair who had come
from the east by Lewes with sheep, and who had in his eyes that
reminiscence of horizons which makes the eyes of shepherds and of
mountaineers different from the eyes of other men...I went with him
to hear what he had to say, for shepherds talk quite differently
from other men.</p>

<p>Happily this shepherd had little to say, even under the stimulus
of the inevitable mug of beer, about the Unknown Country, for the
only remark that he did make proves him either a minor poet, unfit
for the care of sheep, or Mr. Belloc himself masquerading with a
fountain pen. That is the penalty which the habitual essayist must
now be prepared to face. He must masquerade. He cannot afford the
time either to be himself or to be other people. He must skim the
surface of thought and dilute the strength of personality. He must
give us a worn weekly halfpenny instead of a solid sovereign once a
year.</p>

<p>But it is not Mr. Belloc only who has suffered from the
prevailing conditions. The essays which bring the collection to the
year 1920 may not be the best of their authors' work, but, if we
except writers like Mr. Conrad and Mr. Hudson, who have strayed
into essay writing accidentally, and concentrate upon those who
write essays habitually, we shall find them a good deal affected by
the change in their circumstances. To write weekly, to write daily,
to write shortly, to write for busy people catching trains in the
morning or for tired people coming home in the evening, is a
heart-breaking task for men who know good writing from bad. They do
it, but instinctively draw out of harm's way anything precious that
might be damaged by contact with the public, or anything sharp that
might irritate its skin. And so, if one reads Mr. Lucas, Mr. Lynd,
or Mr. Squire in the bulk, one feels that a common greyness silvers
everything. They are as far removed from the extravagant beauty of
Walter Pater as they are from the intemperate candour of Leslie
Stephen. Beauty and courage are dangerous spirits to bottle in a
column and a half; and thought, like a brown paper parcel in a
waistcoat pocket, has a way of spoiling the symmetry of an article.
It is a kind, tired, apathetic world for which they write, and the
marvel is that they never cease to attempt, at least, to write
well.</p>

<p>But there is no need to pity Mr. Clutton Brock for this change
in the essayist's conditions. He has clearly made the best of his
circumstances and not the worst. One hesitates even to say that he
has had to make any conscious effort in the matter, so naturally
has he effected the transition from the private essayist to the
public, from the drawing-room to the Albert Hall. Paradoxically
enough, the shrinkage in size has brought about a corresponding
expansion of individuality. We have no longer the "I" of Max and of
Lamb, but the "we" of public bodies and other sublime personages.
It is "we" who go to hear the <i>Magic Flute</i>; "we" who ought to
profit by it; "we", in some mysterious way, who, in our corporate
capacity, once upon a time actually wrote it. For music and
literature and art must submit to the same generalisation or they
will not carry to the farthest recesses of the Albert Hall. That
the voice of Mr. Clutton Brock, so sincere and so disinterested,
carries such a distance and reaches so many without pandering to
the weakness of the mass or its passions must be a matter of
legitimate satisfaction to us all. But while "we" are gratified,
"I", that unruly partner in the human fellowship, is reduced to
despair. "I" must always think things for himself, and feel things
for himself. To share them in a diluted form with the majority of
well-educated and well-intentioned men and women is for him sheer
agony; and while the rest of us listen intently and profit
profoundly, "I" slips off to the woods and the fields and rejoices
in a single blade of grass or a solitary potato.</p>

<p>In the fifth volume of modern essays, it seems, we have got some
way from pleasure and the art of writing. But in justice to the
essayists of 1920 we must be sure that we are not praising the
famous because they have been praised already and the dead because
we shall never meet them wearing spats in Piccadilly. We must know
what we mean when we say that they can write and give us pleasure.
We must compare them; we must bring out the quality. We must point
to this and say it is good because it is exact, truthful, and
imaginative:</p>

<p>Nay, retire men cannot when they would; neither will they, when
it were Reason; but are impatient of Privateness, even in age and
sickness, which require the shadow: like old Townsmen: that will
still he sitting at their street door, though therby they offer Age
to Scorn...</p>

<p>and to this, and say it is bad because it is loose, plausible,
and commonplace:</p>

<p>With courteous and precise cynicism on his lips, he thought of
quiet virginal chambers, of waters singing under the moon, of
terraces where taintless music sobbed into the open night, of pure
maternal mistresses with protecting arms and vigilant eyes, of
fields slumbering in the sunlight, of leagues of ocean heaving
under warm tremulous heavens, of hot ports, gorgeous and
perfumed...</p>

<p>It goes on, but already we are bemused with sound and neither
feel nor hear. The comparison makes us suspect that the art of
writing has for backbone some fierce attachment to an idea. It is
on the back of an idea, something believed in with conviction or
seen with precision and thus compelling words to its shape, that
the diverse company which includes Lamb and Bacon, and Mr. Beerbohm
and Hudson, and Vernon Lee and Mr. Conrad, and Leslie Stephen and
Butler and Walter Pater reaches the farther shore. Very various
talents have helped or hindered the passage of the idea into words.
Some scrape through painfully; others fly with every wind
favouring. But Mr. Belloc and Mr. Lucas and Mr. Squire are not
fiercely attached to anything in itself. They share the
contemporary dilemma&mdash;that lack of an obstinate conviction
which lifts ephemeral sounds through the misty sphere of anybody's
language to the land where there is a perpetual marriage, a
perpetual union. Vague as all definitions are, a good essay must
have this permanent quality about it; it must draw its curtain
round us but it must be a curtain that shuts us in, not out.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. THE DEATH OF THE MOTH</h2>

<p>Moths that fly by day are not properly to be called moths; they
do not excite that pleasant sense of dark autumn nights and
ivy-blossom which the commonest yellow-underwing asleep in the
shadow of the curtain never fails to rouse in us. They are hybrid
creatures, neither gay like butterflies nor sombre like their own
species. Nevertheless the present specimen, with his narrow
hay-coloured wings, fringed with a tassel of the same colour,
seemed to be content with life. It was a pleasant morning,
mid-September, mild, benignant, yet with a keener breath than that
of the summer months. The plough was already scoring the field
opposite the window, and where the share had been, the earth was
pressed flat and gleamed with moisture. Such vigour came rolling in
from the fields and the down beyond that it was difficult to keep
the eyes strictly turned upon the book. The rooks too were keeping
one of their annual festivities; soaring round the tree tops until
it looked as if a vast net with thousands of black knots in it had
been cast up into the air; which, after a few moments sank slowly
down upon the trees until every twig seemed to have a knot at the
end of it. Then, suddenly, the net would be thrown into the air
again in a wider circle this time, with the utmost clamour and
vociferation, as though to be thrown into the air and settle slowly
down upon the tree tops were a tremendously exciting
experience.</p>

<p>The same energy which inspired the rooks, the ploughmen, the
horses, and even, it seemed, the lean bare-backed downs, sent the
moth fluttering from side to side of his square of the window-pane.
One could not help watching him. One was, indeed, conscious of a
queer feeling of pity for him. The possibilities of pleasure seemed
that morning so enormous and so various that to have only a moth's
part in life, and a day moth's at that, appeared a hard fate, and
his zest in enjoying his meagre opportunities to the full,
pathetic. He flew vigorously to one corner of his compartment, and,
after waiting there a second, flew across to the other. What
remained for him but to fly to a third corner and then to a fourth?
That was all he could do, in spite of the size of the downs, the
width of the sky, the far-off smoke of houses, and the romantic
voice, now and then, of a steamer out at sea. What he could do he
did. Watching him, it seemed as if a fibre, very thin but pure, of
the enormous energy of the world had been thrust into his frail and
diminutive body. As often as he crossed the pane, I could fancy
that a thread of vital light became visible. He was little or
nothing but life.</p>

<p>Yet, because he was so small, and so simple a form of the energy
that was rolling in at the open window and driving its way through
so many narrow and intricate corridors in my own brain and in those
of other human beings, there was something marvellous as well as
pathetic about him. It was as if someone had taken a tiny bead of
pure life and decking it as lightly as possible with down and
feathers, had set it dancing and zig-zagging to show us the true
nature of life. Thus displayed one could not get over the
strangeness of it. One is apt to forget all about life, seeing it
humped and bossed and garnished and cumbered so that it has to move
with the greatest circumspection and dignity. Again, the thought of
all that life might have been had he been born in any other shape
caused one to view his simple activities with a kind of pity.</p>

<p>After a time, tired by his dancing apparently, he settled on the
window ledge in the sun, and, the queer spectacle being at an end,
I forgot about him. Then, looking up, my eye was caught by him. He
was trying to resume his dancing, but seemed either so stiff or so
awkward that he could only flutter to the bottom of the
window-pane; and when he tried to fly across it he failed. Being
intent on other matters I watched these futile attempts for a time
without thinking, unconsciously waiting for him to resume his
flight, as one waits for a machine, that has stopped momentarily,
to start again without considering the reason of its failure. After
perhaps a seventh attempt he slipped from the wooden ledge and
fell, fluttering his wings, on to his back on the window sill. The
helplessness of his attitude roused me. It flashed upon me that he
was in difficulties; he could no longer raise himself; his legs
struggled vainly. But, as I stretched out a pencil, meaning to help
him to right himself, it came over me that the failure and
awkwardness were the approach of death. I laid the pencil down
again.</p>

<p>The legs agitated themselves once more. I looked as if for the
enemy against which he struggled. I looked out of doors. What had
happened there? Presumably it was midday, and work in the fields
had stopped. Stillness and quiet had replaced the previous
animation. The birds had taken themselves off to feed in the
brooks. The horses stood still. Yet the power was there all the
same, massed outside indifferent, impersonal, not attending to
anything in particular. Somehow it was opposed to the little
hay-coloured moth. It was useless to try to do anything. One could
only watch the extraordinary efforts made by those tiny legs
against an oncoming doom which could, had it chosen, have submerged
an entire city, not merely a city, but masses of human beings;
nothing, I knew, had any chance against death. Nevertheless after a
pause of exhaustion the legs fluttered again. It was superb this
last protest, and so frantic that he succeeded at last in righting
himself. One's sympathies, of course, were all on the side of life.
Also, when there was nobody to care or to know, this gigantic
effort on the part of an insignificant little moth, against a power
of such magnitude, to retain what no one else valued or desired to
keep, moved one strangely. Again, somehow, one saw life, a pure
bead. I lifted the pencil again, useless though I knew it to be.
But even as I did so, the unmistakable tokens of death showed
themselves. The body relaxed, and instantly grew stiff. The
struggle was over. The insignificant little creature now knew
death. As I looked at the dead moth, this minute wayside triumph of
so great a force over so mean an antagonist filled me with wonder.
Just as life had been strange a few minutes before, so death was
now as strange. The moth having righted himself now lay most
decently and uncomplainingly composed. O yes, he seemed to say,
death is stronger than I am.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. EVENING OVER SUSSEX: REFLECTIONS
IN A MOTOR CAR</h2>

<p>Evening is kind to Sussex, for Sussex is no longer young, and
she is grateful for the veil of evening as an elderly woman is glad
when a shade is drawn over a lamp, and only the outline of her face
remains. The outline of Sussex is still very fine. The cliffs stand
out to sea, one behind another. All Eastbourne, all Bexhill, all
St. Leonards, their parades and their lodging houses, their bead
shops and their sweet shops and their placards and their invalids
and chars-á-bancs, are all obliterated. What remains is what there
was when William came over from France ten centuries ago: a line of
cliffs running out to sea. Also the fields are redeemed. The
freckle of red villas on the coast is washed over by a thin lucid
lake of brown air, in which they and their redness are drowned. It
was still too early for lamps; and too early for stars.</p>

<p>But, I thought, there is always some sediment of irritation when
the moment is as beautiful as it is now. The psychologists must
explain; one looks up, one is overcome by beauty extravagantly
greater than one could expect&mdash;there are now pink clouds over
Battle; the fields are mottled, marbled&mdash;one's perceptions
blow out rapidly like air balls expanded by some rush of air, and
then, when all seems blown to its fullest and tautest, with beauty
and beauty and beauty, a pin pricks; it collapses. But what is the
pin? So far as I could tell, the pin had something to do with one's
own impotency. I cannot hold this&mdash;I cannot express
this&mdash;I am overcome by it&mdash;I am mastered. Somewhere in
that region one's discontent lay; and it was allied with the idea
that one's nature demands mastery over all that it receives; and
mastery here meant the power to convey what one saw now over Sussex
so that another person could share it. And further, there was
another prick of the pin: one was wasting one's chance; for beauty
spread at one's right hand, at one's left; at one's back too; it
was escaping all the time; one could only offer a thimble to a
torrent that could fill baths, lakes.</p>

<p>But relinquish, I said (it is well known how in circumstances
like these the self splits up and one self is eager and
dissatisfied and the other stern and philosophical), relinquish
these impossible aspirations; be content with the view in front of
us, and believe me when I tell you that it is best to sit and soak;
to be passive; to accept; and do not bother because nature has
given you six little pocket knives with which to cut up the body of
a whale.</p>

<p>While these two selves then held a colloquy about the wise
course to adopt in the presence of beauty, I (a third party now
declared itself) said to myself, how happy they were to enjoy so
simple an occupation. There they sat as the car sped along,
noticing everything: a hay stack; a rust red roof; a pond; an old
man coming home with his sack on his back; there they sat, matching
every colour in the sky and earth from their colour box, rigging up
little models of Sussex barns and farmhouses in the red light that
would serve in the January gloom. But I, being somewhat different,
sat aloof and melancholy. While they are thus busied, I said to
myself: Gone, gone; over, over; past and done with, past and done
with. I feel life left behind even as the road is left behind. We
have been over that stretch, and are already forgotten. There,
windows were lit by our lamps for a second; the light is out now.
Others come behind us.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a fourth self (a self which lies in ambush,
apparently dormant, and jumps upon one unawares. Its remarks are
often entirely disconnected with what has been happening, but must
be attended to because of their very abruptness) said: "Look at
that." It was a light; brilliant, freakish; inexplicable. For a
second I was unable to name it. "A star"; and for that second it
held its odd flicker of unexpectedness and danced and beamed. "I
take your meaning," I said. "You, erratic and impulsive self that
you are, feel that the light over the downs there emerging, dangles
from the future. Let us try to understand this. Let us reason it
out. I feel suddenly attached not to the past but to the future. I
think of Sussex in five hundred years to come. I think much
grossness will have evaporated. Things will have been scorched up,
eliminated. There will be magic gates. Draughts fan-blown by
electric power will cleanse houses. Lights intense and firmly
directed will go over the earth, doing the work. Look at the moving
light in that hill; it is the headlight of a car. By day and by
night Sussex in five centuries will be full of charming thoughts,
quick, effective beams."</p>

<p>The sun was now low beneath the horizon. Darkness spread
rapidly. None of my selves could see anything beyond the tapering
light of our headlamps on the hedge. I summoned them together.
"Now," I said, "comes the season of making up our accounts. Now we
have got to collect ourselves; we have got to be one self. Nothing
is to be seen any more, except one wedge of road and bank which our
lights repeat incessantly. We are perfectly provided for. We are
warmly wrapped in a rug; we are protected from wind and rain. We
are alone. Now is the time of reckoning. Now I, who preside over
the company, am going to arrange in order the trophies which we
have all brought in. Let me see; there was a great deal of beauty
brought in to-day: farmhouses; cliffs standing out to sea; marbled
fields; mottled fields; red feathered skies; all that. Also there
was disappearance and the death of the individual. The vanishing
road and the window lit for a second and then dark. And then there
was the sudden dancing light, that was hung in the future. What we
have made then to-day," I said, "is this: that beauty; death of the
individual; and the future. Look, I will make a little figure for
your satisfaction; here he comes. Does this little figure advancing
through beauty, through death, to the economical, powerful and
efficient future when houses will be cleansed by a puff of hot wind
satisfy you? Look at him; there on my knee." We sat and looked at
the figure we had made that day. Great sheer slabs of rock, tree
tufted, surrounded him. He was for a second very, very solemn.
Indeed it seemed as if the reality of things were displayed there
on the rug. A violent thrill ran through us; as if a charge of
electricity had entered in to us. We cried out together: "Yes,
yes," as if affirming something, in a moment of recognition.</p>

<p>And then the body who had been silent up to now began its song,
almost at first as low as the rush of the wheels: "Eggs and bacon;
toast and tea; fire and a bath; fire and a bath; jugged hare," it
went on, "and red currant jelly; a glass of wine with coffee to
follow, with coffee to follow&mdash;and then to bed and then to
bed."</p>

<p>"Off with you," I said to my assembled selves. "Your work is
done. I dismiss you. Good-night."</p>

<p>And the rest of the journey was performed in the delicious
society of my own body.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. THREE PICTURES</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in June 1929.)</p>

<h3>The First Picture</h3>

<p>It is impossible that one should not see pictures; because if my
father was a blacksmith and yours was a peer of the realm, we must
needs be pictures to each other. We cannot possibly break out of
the frame of the picture by speaking natural words. You see me
leaning against the door of the smithy with a horseshoe in my hand
and you think as you go by: "How picturesque!" I, seeing you
sitting so much at your ease in the car, almost as if you were
going to bow to the populace, think what a picture of old luxurious
aristocratical England! We are both quite wrong in our judgments no
doubt, but that is inevitable.</p>

<p>So now at the turn of the road I saw one of these pictures. It
might have been called "The Sailor's Homecoming" or some such
title. A fine young sailor carrying a bundle; a girl with her hand
on his arm; neighbours gathering round; a cottage garden ablaze
with flowers; as one passed one read at the bottom of that picture
that the sailor was back from China, and there was a fine spread
waiting for him in the parlour; and he had a present for his young
wife in his bundle; and she was soon going to bear him their first
child. Everything was right and good and as it should be, one felt
about that picture.</p>

<p>There was something wholesome and satisfactory in the sight of
such happiness; life seemed sweeter and more enviable than
before.</p>

<p>So thinking I passed them, filling in the picture as fully, as
completely as I could, noticing the colour of her dress, of his
eyes, seeing the sandy cat slinking round the cottage door.</p>

<p>For some time the picture floated in my eyes, making most things
appear much brighter, warmer, and simpler than usual; and making
some things appear foolish; and some things wrong and some things
right, and more full of meaning than before. At odd moments during
that day and the next the picture returned to one's mind, and one
thought with envy, but with kindness, of the happy sailor and his
wife; one wondered what they were doing, what they were saying now.
The imagination supplied other pictures springing from that first
one, a picture of the sailor cutting firewood, drawing water; and
they talked about China; and the girl set his present on the
chimney-piece where everyone who came could see it; and she sewed
at her baby clothes, and all the doors and windows were open into
the garden so that the birds were flittering and the bees humming,
and Rogers&mdash;that was his name&mdash;could not say how much to
his liking all this was after the China seas. As he smoked his
pipe, with his foot in the garden.</p>

<h3>The Second Picture</h3>

<p>In the middle of the night a loud cry rang through the village.
Then there was a sound of something scuffling; and then dead
silence. All that could be seen out of the window was the branch of
lilac tree hanging motionless and ponderous across the road. It was
a hot still night. There was no moon. The cry made everything seem
ominous. Who had cried? Why had she cried? It was a woman's voice,
made by some extremity of feeling almost sexless, almost
expressionless. It was as if human nature had cried out against
some iniquity, some inexpressible horror. There was dead silence.
The stars shone perfectly steadily. The fields lay still. The trees
were motionless. Yet all seemed guilty, convicted, ominous. One
felt that something ought to be done. Some light ought to appear
tossing, moving agitatedly. Someone ought to come running down the
road. There should be lights in the cottage windows. And then
perhaps another cry, but less sexless, less wordless, comforted,
appeased. But no light came. No feet were heard. There was no
second cry. The first had been swallowed up, and there was dead
silence.</p>

<p>One lay in the dark listening intently. It had been merely a
voice. There was nothing to connect it with. No picture of any sort
came to interpret it, to make it intelligible to the mind. But as
the dark arose at last all one saw was an obscure human form,
almost without shape, raising a gigantic arm in vain against some
overwhelming iniquity.</p>

<h3>The Third Picture</h3>

<p>The fine weather remained unbroken. Had it not been for that
single cry in the night one would have felt that the earth had put
into harbour; that life had ceased to drive before the wind; that
it had reached some quiet cove and there lay anchored, hardly
moving, on the quiet waters. But the sound persisted. Wherever one
went, it might be for a long walk up into the hills, something
seemed to turn uneasily beneath the surface, making the peace, the
stability all round one seem a little unreal. There were the sheep
clustered on the side of the hill; the valley broke in long
tapering waves like the fall of smooth waters. One came on solitary
farmhouses. The puppy rolled in the yard. The butterflies gambolled
over the gorse. All was as quiet, as safe could be. Yet, one kept
thinking, a cry had rent it; all this beauty had been an accomplice
that night; had consented; to remain calm, to be still beautiful;
at any moment it might be sundered again. This goodness, this
safety were only on the surface.</p>

<p>And then to cheer oneself out of this apprehensive mood one
turned to the picture of the sailor's homecoming. One saw it all
over again producing various little details&mdash;the blue colour
of her dress, the shadow that fell from the yellow flowering
tree&mdash;that one had not used before. So they had stood at the
cottage door, he with his bundle on his back, she just lightly
touching his sleeve with her hand. And a sandy cat had slunk round
the door. Thus gradually going over the picture in every detail,
one persuaded oneself by degrees that it was far more likely that
this calm and content and good will lay beneath the surface than
anything treacherous, sinister. The sheep grazing, the waves of the
valley, the farmhouse, the puppy, the dancing butterflies were in
fact like that all through. And so one turned back home, with one's
mind fixed on the sailor and his wife, making up picture after
picture of them so that one picture after another of happiness and
satisfaction might be laid over that unrest, that hideous cry,
until it was crushed and silenced by their pressure out of
existence.</p>

<p>Here at last was the village, and the churchyard through which
one must pass; and the usual thought came, as one entered it, of
the peacefulness of the place, with its shady yews, its rubbed
tombstones, its nameless graves. Death is cheerful here, one felt.
Indeed, look at that picture! A man was digging a grave, and
children were picnicking at the side of it while he worked. As the
shovels of yellow earth were thrown up, the children were sprawling
about eating bread and jam and drinking milk out of large mugs. The
gravedigger's wife, a fat fair woman, had propped herself against a
tombstone and spread her apron on the grass by the open grave to
serve as a tea-table. Some lumps of clay had fallen among the tea
things. Who was going to be buried, I asked. Had old Mr. Dodson
died at last? "Oh! no. It's for young Rogers, the sailor," the
woman answered, staring at me. "He died two nights ago, of some
foreign fever. Didn't you hear his wife?" She rushed into the road
and cried out..."Here, Tommy, you're all covered with earth!"</p>

<p>What a picture it made!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. OLD MRS. GREY</h2>

<p>There are moments even in England, now, when even the busiest,
most contented suddenly let fall what they hold&mdash;it may be the
week's washing. Sheets and pyjamas crumble and dissolve in their
hands, because, though they do not state this in so many words, it
seems silly to take the washing round to Mrs. Peel when out there
over the fields over the hills, there is no washing; no pinning of
clothes to lines; mangling and ironing no work at all, but
boundless rest. Stainless and boundless rest; space unlimited;
untrodden grass; wild birds flying hills whose smooth uprise
continue that wild flight.</p>

<p>Of all this however only seven foot by four could be seen from
Mrs. Grey's corner. That was the size of her front door which stood
wide open, though there was a fire burning in the grate. The fire
looked like a small spot of dusty light feebly trying to escape
from the embarrassing pressure of the pouring sunshine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Grey sat on a hard chair in the corner looking&mdash;but at
what? Apparently at nothing. She did not change the focus of her
eyes when visitors came in. Her eyes had ceased to focus
themselves; it may be that they had lost the power. They were aged
eyes, blue, unspectacled. They could see, but without looking. She
had never used her eyes on anything minute and difficult; merely
upon faces, and dishes and fields. And now at the age of ninety-two
they saw nothing but a zigzag of pain wriggling across the door,
pain that twisted her legs as it wriggled; jerked her body to and
fro like a marionette. Her body was wrapped round the pain as a
damp sheet is folded over a wire. The wire was spasmodically jerked
by a cruel invisible hand. She flung out a foot, a hand. Then it
stopped. She sat still for a moment.</p>

<p>In that pause she saw herself in the past at ten, at twenty, at
twenty-five. She was running in and out of a cottage with eleven
brothers and sisters. The line jerked. She was thrown forward in
her chair.</p>

<p>"All dead. All dead," she mumbled. "My brothers and sisters. And
my husband gone. My daughter too. But I go on. Every morning I pray
God to let me pass."</p>

<p>The morning spread seven foot by four green and sunny. Like a
fling of grain the birds settled on the land. She was jerked again
by another tweak of the tormenting hand.</p>

<p>"I'm an ignorant old woman. I can't read or write, and every
morning when I crawls down stairs, I say I wish it were night; and
every night, when I crawls up to bed, I say, I wish it were day.
I'm only an ignorant old woman. But I prays to God: 0 let me pass.
I'm an ignorant old woman&mdash;I can't read or write."</p>

<p>So when the colour went out of the doorway, she could not see
the other page which is then lit up; or hear the voices that have
argued, sung, talked for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>The jerked limbs were still again.</p>

<p>"The doctor comes every week. The parish doctor now. Since my
daughter went, we can't afford Dr. Nicholls. But he's a good man.
He says he wonders I don't go. He says my heart's nothing but wind
and water. Yet I don't seem able to die."</p>

<p>So we&mdash;humanity&mdash;insist that the body shall still
cling to the wire. We put out the eyes and the ears; but we pinion
it there, with a bottle of medicine, a cup of tea, a dying fire,
like a rook on a barn door; but a rook that still lives, even with
a nail through it.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. STREET HAUNTING: A LONDON
ADVENTURE</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in 1930.)</p>

<p>No one perhaps has ever felt passionately towards a lead pencil.
But there are circumstances in which it can become supremely
desirable to possess one; moments when we are set upon having an
object, an excuse for walking half across London between tea and
dinner. As the foxhunter hunts in order to preserve the breed of
foxes, and the golfer plays in order that open spaces may be
preserved from the builders, so when the desire comes upon us to go
street rambling the pencil does for a pretext, and getting up we
say: "Really I must buy a pencil," as if under cover of this excuse
we could indulge safely in the greatest pleasure of town life in
winter&mdash;rambling the streets of London.</p>

<p>The hour should be the evening and the season winter, for in
winter the champagne brightness of the air and the sociability of
the streets are grateful. We are not then taunted as in the summer
by the longing for shade and solitude and sweet airs from the
hayfields. The evening hour, too, gives us the irresponsibility
which darkness and lamplight bestow. We are no longer quite
ourselves. As we step out of the house on a fine evening between
four and six, we shed the self our friends know us by and become
part of that vast republican army of anonymous trampers, whose
society is so agreeable after the solitude of one's own room. For
there we sit surrounded by objects which perpetually express the
oddity of our own temperaments and enforce the memories of our own
experience. That bowl on the mantelpiece, for instance, was bought
at Mantua on a windy day. We were leaving the shop when the
sinister old woman plucked at our skirts and said she would find
herself starving one of these days, but, "Take it!" she cried, and
thrust the blue and white china bowl into our hands as if she never
wanted to be reminded of her quixotic generosity. So, guiltily, but
suspecting nevertheless how badly we had been fleeced, we carried
it back to the little hotel where, in the middle of the night, the
innkeeper quarrelled so violently with his wife that we all leant
out into the courtyard to look, and saw the vines laced about among
the pillars and the stars white in the sky. The moment was
stabilized, stamped like a coin indelibly among a million that
slipped by imperceptibly. There, too, was the melancholy
Englishman, who rose among the coffee cups and the little iron
tables and revealed the secrets of his soul&mdash;as travellers do.
All this&mdash;Italy, the windy morning, the vines laced about the
pillars, the Englishman and the secrets of his soul&mdash;rise up
in a cloud from the china bowl on the mantelpiece. And there, as
our eyes fall to the floor, is that brown stain on the carpet. Mr.
Lloyd George made that. "The man's a devil!" said Mr. Cummings,
putting the kettle down with which he was about to fill the teapot
so that it burnt a brown ring on the carpet.</p>

<p>But when the door shuts on us, all that vanishes. The shell-like
covering which our souls have excreted to house themselves, to make
for themselves a shape distinct from others, is broken, and there
is left of all these wrinkles and roughnesses a central oyster of
perceptiveness, an enormous eye. How beautiful a street is in
winter! It is at once revealed and obscured. Here vaguely one can
trace symmetrical straight avenues of doors and windows; here under
the lamps are floating islands of pale light through which pass
quickly bright men and women, who, for all their poverty and
shabbiness, wear a certain look of unreality, an air of triumph, as
if they had given life the slip, so that life, deceived of her
prey, blunders on without them. But, after all, we are only gliding
smoothly on the surface. The eye is not a miner, not a diver, not a
seeker after buried treasure. It floats us smoothly down a stream;
resting, pausing, the brain sleeps perhaps as it looks.</p>

<p>How beautiful a London street is then, with its islands of
light, and its long groves of darkness, and on one side of it
perhaps some tree-sprinkled, grass-grown space where night is
folding herself to sleep naturally and, as one passes the iron
railing, one hears those little cracklings and stirrings of leaf
and twig which seem to suppose the silence of fields all round
them, an owl hooting, and far away the rattle of a train in the
valley. But this is London, we are reminded; high among the bare
trees are hung oblong frames of reddish yellow light&mdash;windows;
there are points of brilliance burning steadily like low
stars&mdash;lamps; this empty ground, which holds the country in it
and its peace, is only a London square, set about by offices and
houses where at this hour fierce lights burn over maps, over
documents, over desks where clerks sit turning with wetted
forefinger the files of endless correspondences; or more suffusedly
the firelight wavers and the lamplight falls upon the privacy of
some drawing-room, its easy chairs, its papers, its china, its
inlaid table, and the figure of a woman, accurately measuring out
the precise number of spoons of tea which&mdash;&mdash;She looks at
the door as if she heard a ring downstairs and somebody asking, is
she in?</p>

<p>But here we must stop peremptorily. We are in danger of digging
deeper than the eye approves; we are impeding our passage down the
smooth stream by catching at some branch or root. At any moment,
the sleeping army may stir itself and wake in us a thousand violins
and trumpets in response; the army of human beings may rouse itself
and assert all its oddities and sufferings and sordidities. Let us
dally a little longer, be content still with surfaces
only&mdash;the glossy brilliance of the motor omnibuses; the carnal
splendour of the butchers' shops with their yellow flanks and
purple steaks; the blue and red bunches of flowers burning so
bravely through the plate glass of the florists' windows.</p>

<p>For the eye has this strange property: it rests only on beauty;
like a butterfly it seeks colour and basks in warmth. On a winter's
night like this, when nature has been at pains to polish and preen
herself, it brings back the prettiest trophies, breaks off little
lumps of emerald and coral as if the whole earth were made of
precious stone. The thing it cannot do (one is speaking of the
average unprofessional eye) is to compose these trophies in such a
way as to bring out the more obscure angles and relationships.
Hence after a prolonged diet of this simple, sugary fare, of beauty
pure and uncomposed, we become conscious of satiety. We halt at the
door of the boot shop and make some little excuse, which has
nothing to do with the real reason, for folding up the bright
paraphernalia of the streets and withdrawing to some duskier
chamber of the being where we may ask, as we raise our left foot
obediently upon the stand: "What, then, is it like to be a
dwarf?"</p>

<p>She came in escorted by two women who, being of normal size,
looked like benevolent giants beside her. Smiling at the shop
girls, they seemed to be disclaiming any lot in her deformity and
assuring her of their protection. She wore the peevish yet
apologetic expression usual on the faces of the deformed. She
needed their kindness, yet she resented it. But when the shop girl
had been summoned and the giantesses, smiling indulgently, had
asked for shoes for "this lady" and the girl had pushed the little
stand in front of her, the dwarf stuck her foot out with an
impetuosity which seemed to claim all our attention. Look at that!
Look at that! she seemed to demand of us all, as she thrust her
foot out, for behold it was the shapely, perfectly proportioned
foot of a well-grown woman. It was arched; it was aristocratic. Her
whole manner changed as she looked at it resting on the stand. She
looked soothed and satisfied. Her manner became full of
self-confidence. She sent for shoe after shoe; she tried on pair
after pair. She got up and pirouetted before a glass which
reflected the foot only in yellow shoes, in fawn shoes, in shoes of
lizard skin. She raised her little skirts and displayed her little
legs. She was thinking that, after all, feet are the most important
part of the whole person; women, she said to herself, have been
loved for their feet alone. Seeing nothing but her feet, she
imagined perhaps that the rest of her body was of a piece with
those beautiful feet. She was shabbily dressed, but she was ready
to lavish any money upon her shoes. And as this was the only
occasion upon which she was hot afraid of being looked at but
positively craved attention, she was ready to use any device to
prolong the choosing and fitting. Look at my feet, she seemed to be
saying, as she took a step this way and then a step that way. The
shop girl good-humouredly must have said something flattering, for
suddenly her face lit up in ecstasy. But, after all, the
giantesses, benevolent though they were, had their own affairs to
see to; she must make up her mind; she must decide which to choose.
At length, the pair was chosen and, as she walked out between her
guardians, with the parcel swinging from her finger, the ecstasy
faded, knowledge returned, the old peevishness, the old apology
came back, and by the time she had reached the street again she had
become a dwarf only.</p>

<p>But she had changed the mood; she had called into being an
atmosphere which, as we followed her out into the street, seemed
actually to create the humped, the twisted, the deformed. Two
bearded men, brothers, apparently, stone-blind, supporting
themselves by resting a hand on the head of a small boy between
them, marched down the street. On they came with the unyielding yet
tremulous tread of the blind, which seems to lend to their approach
something of the terror and inevitability of the fate that has
overtaken them. As they passed, holding straight on, the little
convoy seemed to cleave asunder the passers-by with the momentum of
its silence, its directness, its disaster. Indeed, the dwarf had
started a hobbling grotesque dance to which everybody in the street
now conformed: the stout lady tightly swathed in shiny sealskin;
the feeble-minded boy sucking the silver knob of his stick; the old
man squatted on a doorstep as if, suddenly overcome by the
absurdity of the human spectacle, he had sat down to look at
it&mdash;all joined in the hobble and tap of the dwarf's dance.</p>

<p>In what crevices and crannies, one might ask, did they lodge,
this maimed company of the halt and the blind? Here, perhaps, in
the top rooms of these narrow old houses between Holborn and Soho,
where people have such queer names, and pursue so many curious
trades, are gold beaters, accordion pleaters, cover buttons, or
support life, with even greater fantasticality, upon a traffic in
cups without saucers, china umbrella handles, and highly-coloured
pictures of martyred saints. There they lodge, and it seems as if
the lady in the sealskin jacket must find life tolerable, passing
the time of day with the accordion pleater, or the man who covers
buttons; life which is so fantastic cannot be altogether tragic.
They do not grudge us, we are musing, our prosperity; when,
suddenly, turning the corner, we come upon a bearded Jew, wild,
hunger-bitten, glaring out of his misery; or pass the humped body
of an old woman flung abandoned on the step of a public building
with a cloak over her like the hasty covering thrown over a dead
horse or donkey. At such sights the nerves of the spine seem to
stand erect; a sudden flare is brandished in our eyes; a question
is asked which is never answered. Often enough these derelicts
choose to lie not a stone's thrown from theatres, within hearing of
barrel organs, almost, as night draws on, within touch of the
sequined cloaks and bright legs of diners and dancers. They lie
close to those shop windows where commerce offers to a world of old
women laid on doorsteps, of blind men, of hobbling dwarfs, sofas
which are supported by the gilt necks of proud swans; tables inlaid
with baskets of many coloured fruit; sideboards paved with green
marble the better to support the weight of boars' heads; and
carpets so softened with age that their carnations have almost
vanished in a pale green sea.</p>

<p>Passing, glimpsing, everything seems accidentally but
miraculously sprinkled with beauty, as if the tide of trade which
deposits its burden so punctually and prosaically upon the shores
of Oxford Street had this night cast up nothing but treasure. With
no thought of buying, the eye is sportive and generous; it creates;
it adorns; it enhances. Standing out in the street, one may build
up all the chambers of an imaginary house and furnish them at one's
will with sofa, table, carpet. That rug will do for the hall. That
alabaster bowl shall stand on a carved table in the window. Our
merrymaking shall be reflected in that thick round mirror. But,
having built and furnished the house, one is happily under no
obligation to possess it; one can dismantle it in the twinkling of
an eye, and build and furnish another house with other chairs and
other glasses. Or let us indulge ourselves at the antique
jewellers, among the trays of rings and the hanging necklaces. Let
us choose those pearls, for example, and then imagine how, if we
put them on, life would be changed. It becomes instantly between
two and three in the morning; the lamps are burning very white in
the deserted streets of Mayfair. Only motor-cars are abroad at this
hour, and one has a sense of emptiness, of airiness, of secluded
gaiety. Wearing pearls, wearing silk, one steps out on to a balcony
which overlooks the gardens of sleeping Mayfair. There are a few
lights in the bedrooms of great peers returned from Court, of
silk-stockinged footmen, of dowagers who have pressed the hands of
statesmen. A cat creeps along the garden wall. Love-making is going
on sibilantly, seductively in the darker places of the room behind
thick green curtains. Strolling sedately as if he were promenading
a terrace beneath which the shires and counties of England lie
sun-bathed, the aged Prime Minister recounts to Lady So-and-So with
the curls and the emeralds the true history of some great crisis in
the affairs of the land. We seem to be riding on the top of the
highest mast of the tallest ship; and yet at the same time we know
that nothing of this sort matters; love is not proved thus, nor
great achievements completed thus; so that we sport with the moment
and preen our feathers in it lightly, as we stand on the balcony
watching the moonlit cat creep along Princess Mary's garden
wall.</p>

<p>But what could be more absurd? It is, in fact, on the stroke of
six; it is a winter's evening; we are walking to the Strand to buy
a pencil. How, then, are we also on a balcony, wearing pearls in
June? What could be more absurd? Yet it is nature's folly, not
ours. When she set about her chief masterpiece, the making of man,
she should have thought of one thing only. Instead, turning her
head, looking over her shoulder, into each one of us she let creep
instincts and desires which are utterly at variance with his main
being, so that we are streaked, variegated, all of a mixture; the
colours have run. Is the true self this which stands on the
pavement in January, or that which bends over the balcony in June?
Am I here, or am I there? Or is the true self neither this nor
that, neither here nor there, but something so varied and wandering
that it is only when we give the rein to its wishes and let it take
its way unimpeded that we are indeed ourselves? Circumstances
compel unity; for convenience sake a man must be a whole. The good
citizen when he opens his door in the evening must be banker,
golfer, husband, father; not a nomad wandering the desert, a mystic
staring at the sky, a debauchee in the slums of San Francisco, a
soldier heading a revolution, a pariah howling with scepticism and
solitude. When he opens his door, he must run his fingers through
his hair and put his umbrella in the stand like the rest.</p>

<p>But here, none too soon, are the second-hand bookshops. Here we
find anchorage in these thwarting currents of being; here we
balance ourselves after the splendours and miseries of the streets.
The very sight of the bookseller's wife with her foot on the
fender, sitting beside a good coal fire, screened from the door, is
sobering and cheerful. She is never reading, or only the newspaper;
her talk, when it leaves bookselling, which it does so gladly, is
about hats; she likes a hat to be practical, she says, as well as
pretty. 0 no, they don't live at the shop; they live in Brixton;
she must have a bit of green to look at. In summer a jar of flowers
grown in her own garden is stood on the top of some dusty pile to
enliven the shop. Books are everywhere; and always the same sense
of adventure fills us. Second-hand books are wild books, homeless
books; they have come together in vast flocks of variegated
feather, and have a charm which the domesticated volumes of the
library lack. Besides, in this random miscellaneous company we may
rub against some complete stranger who will, with luck, turn into
the best friend we have in the world. There is always a hope, as we
reach down some grayish-white book from an upper shelf, directed by
its air of shabbiness and desertion, of meeting here with a man who
set out on horseback over a hundred years ago to explore the
woollen market in the Midlands and Wales; an unknown traveller, who
stayed at inns, drank his pint, noted pretty girls and serious
customs, wrote it all down stiffly, laboriously for sheer love of
it (the book was published at his own expense); was infinitely
prosy, busy, and matter-of-fact, and so let flow in without his
knowing it the very scent of hollyhocks and the hay together with
such a portrait of himself as gives him forever a seat in the warm
corner of the mind's inglenook. One may buy him for eighteen pence
now. He is marked three and sixpence, but the bookseller's wife,
seeing how shabby the covers are and how long the book has stood
there since it was bought at some sale of a gentleman's library in
Suffolk, will let it go at that.</p>

<p>Thus, glancing round the bookshop, we make other such sudden
capricious friendships with the unknown and the vanished whose only
record is, for example, this little book of poems, so fairly
printed, so finely engraved, too, with a portrait of the author.
For he was a poet and drowned untimely, and his verse, mild as it
is and formal and sententious, sends forth still a frail fluty
sound like that of a piano organ played in some back street
resignedly by an old Italian organ-grinder in a corduroy jacket.
There are travellers, too, row upon row of them, still testifying,
indomitable spinsters that they were, to the discomforts that they
endured and the sunsets they admired in Greece when Queen Victoria
was a girl. A tour in Cornwall with a visit to the tin mines was
thought worthy of voluminous record. People went slowly up the
Rhine and did portraits of each other in Indian ink, sitting
reading on deck beside a coil of rope; they measured the pyramids;
were lost to civilization for years; converted negroes in
pestilential swamps. This packing up and going off, exploring
deserts and catching fevers, settling in India for a lifetime,
penetrating even to China and then returning to lead a parochial
life at Edmonton, tumbles and tosses upon the dusty floor like an
uneasy sea, so restless the English are, with the waves at their
very door. The waters of travel and adventure seem to break upon
little islands of serious effort and lifelong industry stood in
jagged column upon the floor. In these piles of puce-bound volumes
with gilt monograms on the back, thoughtful clergymen expound the
gospels; scholars are to be heard with their hammers and their
chisels chipping clear the ancient texts of Euripides and
Aeschylus. Thinking, annotating, expounding goes on at a prodigious
rate all around us and over everything, like a punctual,
everlasting tide, washes the ancient sea of fiction. Innumerable
volumes tell how Arthur loved Laura and they were separated and
they were unhappy and then they met and they were happy ever after,
as was the way when Victoria ruled these islands.</p>

<p>The number of books in the world is infinite, and one is forced
to glimpse and nod and move on after a moment of talk, a flash of
understanding, as, in the street outside, one catches a word in
passing and from a chance phrase fabricates a lifetime. It is about
a woman called Kate that they are talking, how "I said to her quite
straight last night...if you don't think I'm worth a penny stamp, I
said..." But who Kate is, and to what crisis in their friendship
that penny stamp refers, we shall never know; for Kate sinks under
the warmth of their volubility; and here, at the street corner,
another page of the volume of life is laid open by the sight of two
men consulting under the lamp-post. They are spelling out the
latest wire from Newmarket in the stop press news. Do they think,
then, that fortune will ever convert their rags into fur and
broadcloth, sling them with watch-chains, and plant diamond pins
where there is now a ragged open shirt? But the main stream of
walkers at this hour sweeps too fast to let us ask such questions.
They are wrapt, in this short passage from work to home, in some
narcotic dream, now that they are free from the desk, and have the
fresh air on their cheeks. They put on those bright clothes which
they must hang up and lock the key upon all the rest of the day,
and are great cricketers, famous actresses, soldiers who have saved
their country at the hour of need. Dreaming, gesticulating, often
muttering a few words aloud, they sweep over the Strand and across
Waterloo Bridge whence they will be slung in long rattling trains,
to some prim little villa in Barnes or Surbiton where the sight of
the clock in the hall and the smell of the supper in the basement
puncture the dream.</p>

<p>But we are come to the Strand now, and as we hesitate on the
curb, a little rod about the length of one's finger begins to lay
its bar across the velocity and abundance of life. "Really I
must&mdash;really I must"&mdash;that is it. Without investigating
the demand, the mind cringes to the accustomed tyrant. One must,
one always must, do something or other; it is not allowed one
simply to enjoy oneself. Was it not for this reason that, some time
ago, we fabricated the excuse, and invented the necessity of buying
something? But what was it? Ah, we remember, it was a pencil. Let
us go then and buy this pencil. But just as we are turning to obey
the command, another self disputes the right of the tyrant to
insist. The usual conflict comes about. Spread out behind the rod
of duty we see the whole breadth of the river Thames&mdash;wide,
mournful, peaceful. And we see it through the eyes of somebody who
is leaning over the Embankment on a summer evening, without a care
in the world. Let us put off buying the pencil; let us go in search
of this person&mdash;and soon it becomes apparent that this person
is ourselves. For if we could stand there where we stood six months
ago, should we not be again as we were then&mdash;calm, aloof,
content? Let us try then. But the river is rougher and greyer than
we remembered. The tide is running out to sea. It brings down with
it a tug and two barges, whose load of straw is tightly bound down
beneath tarpaulin covers. There is, too, close by us, a couple
leaning over the balustrade with the curious lack of
self-consciousness lovers have, as if the importance of the affair
they are engaged on claims without question the indulgence of the
human race. The sights we see and the sounds we hear now have none
of the quality of the past; nor have we any share in the serenity
of the person who, six months ago, stood precisely were we stand
now. His is the happiness of death; ours the insecurity of life. He
has no future; the future is even now invading our peace. It is
only when we look at the past and take from it the element of
uncertainty that we can enjoy perfect peace. As it is, we must
turn, we must cross the Strand again, we must find a shop where,
even at this hour, they will be ready to sell us a pencil.</p>

<p>It is always an adventure to enter a new room for the lives and
characters of its owners have distilled their atmosphere into it,
and directly we enter it we breast some new wave of emotion. Here,
without a doubt, in the stationer's shop people had been
quarrelling. Their anger shot through the air. They both stopped;
the old woman&mdash;they were husband and wife
evidently&mdash;retired to a back room; the old man whose rounded
forehead and globular eyes would have looked well on the
frontispiece of some Elizabethan folio, stayed to serve us. "A
pencil, a pencil," he repeated, "certainly, certainly." He spoke
with the distraction yet effusiveness of one whose emotions have
been roused and checked in full flood. He began opening box after
box and shutting them again. He said that it was very difficult to
find things when they kept so many different articles. He launched
into a story about some legal gentleman who had got into deep
waters owing to the conduct of his wife. He had known him for
years; he had been connected with the Temple for half a century, he
said, as if he wished his wife in the back room to overhear him. He
upset a box of rubber bands. At last, exasperated by his
incompetence, he pushed the swing door open and called out roughly:
"Where d'you keep the pencils?" as if his wife had hidden them. The
old lady came in. Looking at nobody, she put her hand with a fine
air of righteous severity upon the right box. There were pencils.
How then could he do without her? Was she not indispensable to him?
In order to keep them there, standing side by side in forced
neutrality, one had to be particular in one's choice of pencils;
this was too soft, that too hard. They stood silently looking on.
The longer they stood there, the calmer they grew; their heat was
going down, their anger disappearing. Now, without a word said on
either side, the quarrel was made up. The old man, who would not
have disgraced Ben Jonson's title-page, reached the box back to its
proper place, bowed profoundly his good-night to us, and they
disappeared. She would get out her sewing; he would read his
newspaper; the canary would scatter them impartially with seed. The
quarrel was over.</p>

<p>In these minutes in which a ghost has been sought for, a quarrel
composed, and a pencil bought, the streets had become completely
empty. Life had withdrawn to the top floor, and lamps were lit. The
pavement was dry and hard; the road was of hammered silver. Walking
home through the desolation one could tell oneself the story of the
dwarf, of the blind men, of the party in the Mayfair mansion, of
the quarrel in the stationer's shop. Into each of these lives one
could penetrate a little way, far enough to give oneself the
illusion that one is not tethered to a single mind, but can put on
briefly for a few minutes the bodies and minds of others. One could
become a washerwoman, a publican, a street singer. And what greater
delight and wonder can there be than to leave the straight lines of
personality and deviate into those footpaths that lead beneath
brambles and thick tree trunks into the heart of the forest where
live those wild beasts, our fellow men?</p>

<p>That is true: to escape is the greatest of pleasures; street
haunting in winter the greatest of adventures. Still as we approach
our own doorstep again, it is comforting to feel the old
possessions, the old prejudices, fold us round; and the self, which
has been blown about at so many street corners, which has battered
like a moth at the flame of so many inaccessible lanterns,
sheltered and enclosed. Here again is the usual door; here the
chair turned as we left it and the china bowl and the brown ring on
the carpet. And here&mdash;let us examine it tenderly, let us touch
it with reverence&mdash;is the only spoil we have retrieved from
all the treasures of the city, a lead pencil.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. JONES AND WILKINSON</h2>

<p class="cpb">Drawn from the <i>Memoirs of Tate Wilkinson</i>,4
vols.,1790.)</p>

<p>Whether Jones should come before Wilkinson or Wilkinson before
Jones is not a matter likely to agitate many breasts at the present
moment, seeing that more than a hundred and fifty years have rolled
over the gentlemen in question and diminished a lustre which, even
in their own time, round about the year 1750, was not very bright.
The Rev. Dr. Wilkinson might indeed claim precedence by virtue of
his office. He was His Majesty's Chaplain of the Savoy and Chaplain
also to his late Royal Highness, Frederick Prince of Wales. But
then Dr. Wilkinson was transported. Captain James Jones might
assert that, as Captain of His Majesty's third regiment of Guards
with a residence by virtue of his office in Savoy Square, his
social position was equal to the Doctor's. But Captain Jones had to
seclude himself beyond the reach of the law at Mortlake. What,
however, renders these comparisons peculiarly odious is the fact
that the Captain and the Doctor were boon companions whose tastes
were congenial, whose incomes were insufficient, whose wives drank
tea together, and whose houses in the Savoy were not two hundred
yards apart. Dr. Wilkinson, for all his sacred offices (he was
Rector of Coyty in Glamorgan, stipendiary curate of Wise in Kent,
and, through Lord Galway, had the right to "open plaister-pits in
the honour of Pontefract"), was a convivial spirit who cut a
splendid figure in the pulpit, preached and read prayers in a voice
that was clear, strong and sonorous so that many a lady of fashion
never "missed her pew near the pulpit," and persons of title
remembered him many years after misfortune had removed the handsome
preacher from their sight.</p>

<p>Captain Jones shared many of his friend's qualities. He was
vivacious, witty, and generous, well made and elegant in person
and, if he was not quite as handsome as the doctor, he was perhaps
rather his superior in intellect. Compare them as we may, however,
there can be little doubt that the gifts and tastes of both
gentlemen were better adapted for pleasure than for labour, for
society than for solitude, for the hazards and pleasures of the
table rather than for the rigours of religion and war. It was the
gaming-table that seduced Captain Jones, and here, alas, his gifts
and graces stood him in little stead. His affairs became more and
more hopelessly embarrassed, so that shortly, instead of being able
to take his walks at large, he was forced to limit them to the
precincts of St. James's, where, by ancient prerogative, such
unfortunates as he were free from the attentions of the
bailiffs.</p>

<p>To so gregarious a spirit the confinement was irksome. His only
resource, indeed, was to get into talk with any such
"parksaunterers" as misfortunes like his own had driven to
perambulate the Park, or, when the weather allowed, to bask and
loiter and gossip on its benches. As chance would have it (and the
Captain was a devotee of that goddess) he found himself one day
resting on the same bench with an elderly gentleman of military
aspect and stern demeanour, whose ill-temper the wit and humour
which all allowed to Captain Jones presumably beguiled, so that
whenever the Captain appeared in the Park, the old man sought his
company, and they passed the time until dinner very pleasantly in
talk. On no occasion, however, did the General&mdash;for it
appeared that the name of this morose old man was General
Skelton&mdash;ask Captain Jones to his house; the acquaintance went
no further than the bench in St. James's Park; and when, as soon
fell out, the Captain's difficulties forced him to the greater
privacy of a little cabin at Mortlake, he forgot entirely the
military gentleman who, presumably, still sought an appetite for
dinner or some alleviation of his own sour mood in loitering and
gossiping with the park-saunterers of St. James's.</p>

<p>But among the amiable characteristics of Captain Jones was a
love of wife and child, scarcely to be wondered at, indeed,
considering his wife's lively and entertaining disposition and the
extraordinary promise of that little girl who was later to become
the wife of Lord Cornwallis. At whatever risk to himself, Captain
Jones would steal back to revisit his wife and to hear his little
girl recite the part of Juliet which, under his teaching, she had
perfectly by heart. On one such secret journey he was hurrying to
get within the royal sanctuary of St. James's when a voice called
on him to stop. His fears obsessing him, he hurried the faster, his
pursuer close at his heels. Realizing that escape was impossible,
Jones wheeled about and facing his pursuer, whom he recognized as
the Attorney Brown, demanded what his enemy wanted of him. Far from
being his enemy, said Brown, he was the best friend he had ever
had, which he would prove if Jones would accompany him to the first
tavern that came to hand. There, in a private room over a fire, Mr.
Brown disclosed the following astonishing story. An unknown friend,
he said, who had scrutinized Jones's conduct carefully and
concluded that his deserts outweighed his misdemeanours, was
prepared to settle all his debts and indeed to put him beyond the
reach of such tormentors in future. At these words a load was
lifted from Jones's heart, and he cried out "Good God! Who can this
paragon of friendship be?" It was none other, said Brown, than
General Skelton. General Skelton, the man whom he had only met to
chat with on a bench in St. James's Park? Jones asked in
wonderment. Yes, it was the General, Brown assured him. Then let
him hasten to throw himself in gratitude at his benefactor's knee!
Not so fast, Brown replied; General Skelton will never speak to you
again. General Skelton died last night.</p>

<p>The extent of Captain Jones's good fortune was indeed
magnificent. The General had left Captain Jones sole heir to all
his possessions on no other condition than that he should assume
the name of Skelton instead of Jones. Hastening through streets no
longer dreadful, since every debt of honour could now be paid,
Captain Jones brought his wife the astonishing news of their good
fortune, and they promptly set out to view that part which lay
nearest to hand&mdash;the General's great house in Henrietta
Street. Gazing about her, half in dream, half in earnest, Mrs.
Jones Was so overcome with the tumult of her emotions that she
could not stay to gather in the extent of her possessions, but ran
to Little Bedford Street, where Mrs. Wilkinson was then living, to
impart her joy. Meanwhile, the news that General Skelton lay dead
in Henrietta Street without a son to succeed him spread abroad, and
those who thought themselves his heirs arrived in the house of
death to take stock of their inheritance, among them one great and
beautiful lady whose avarice was her undoing, whose misfortunes
were equal to her sins, Kitty Chudleigh, Countess of Bristol,
Duchess of Kingston. Miss Chudleigh, as she then called herself,
believed, and who can doubt that with her passionate nature, her
lust for wealth and property, her pistols and her parsimony, she
believed with vehemence and asserted her belief with arrogance,
that all General Skelton's property had legally descended to her.
Later, when the will was read and the truth made public that not
only the house in Henrietta Street, but Pap Castle in Cumberland
and the lands and lead mines pertaining to it, were left without
exception to an unknown Captain Jones, she burst out in "terms
exceeding all bounds of delicacy." She cried that her relative the
General was an old fool in his dotage, that Jones and his wife were
impudent low upstarts beneath her notice, and so flounced into her
coach "with a scornful quality toss" to carry on that life of
deceit and intrigue and ambition which drove her later to wander in
ignominy, an outcast from her country.</p>

<p>What remains to be told of the fortunes of Captain Jones can be
briefly despatched. Having new furnished the house in Henrietta
Street, the Jones family set out when summer came to visit their
estates in Cumberland. The country was so fair, the Castle so
stately, the thought that now all belonged to them so gratifying
that their progress for three weeks was one of unmixed pleasure and
the spot where they were now to live seemed a paradise. But there
was an eagerness, an impetuosity about James Jones which made him
impatient to suffer even the smiles of fortune passively. He must
be active&mdash;he must be up and doing. He must be "let down," for
all his friends could do to dissuade him, to view a lead mine. The
consequences as they foretold were disastrous. He was drawn up,
indeed, but already infected with a deadly sickness of which in a
few days he died, in the arms of his wife, in the midst of that
paradise which he had toiled so long to reach and now was to die
without enjoying.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Wilkinsons&mdash;but that name, alas, was no
longer applicable to them, nor did the Dr. and his wife any more
inhabit the house in the Savoy&mdash;the Wilkinsons had suffered
more extremities at the hands of Fate than the Joneses themselves.
Dr. Wilkinson, it has been said, resembled his friend Jones in the
conviviality of his habits and his inability to keep within the
limits of his income. Indeed, his wife's dowry of two thousand
pounds had gone to pay off the debts of his youth. But by what
means could he pay off the debts of his middle age? He was now past
fifty, and what with good company and good living, was seldom free
from duns, and always pressed for money. Suddenly, from an
unexpected quarter, help appeared. This was none other than the
Marriage Act, passed in 1755, which laid it down that if any person
solemnized a marriage without publishing the banns, unless a
marriage licence had already been obtained, he should be subject to
transportation for fourteen years. Dr. Wilkinson, looking at the
matter, it is to be feared, from his own angle, and with a view to
his own necessities, argued that as Chaplain of the Savoy, which
was extra-Parochial and Royal-exempt, he could grant licences as
usual&mdash;a privilege which at once brought him such a glut of
business, such a crowd of couples wishing to be married in a hurry,
that the rat-tat-tat never ceased on his street door, and cash
flooded the family exchequer so that even his little boy's pockets
were lined with gold. The duns were paid; the table sumptuously
spread. But Dr. Wilkinson shared another failing with his friend
Jones; he would not take advice. His friends warned him; the
Government plainly hinted that if he persisted they would be forced
to act. Secure in what he imagined to be his right, enjoying the
prosperity it brought him to the full, the Doctor paid no heed. On
Easter Day he was engaged in marrying from eight in the morning
till twelve at night. At last, one Sunday, the King's Messengers
appeared. The Doctor escaped by a secret walk over the leads of the
Savoy, made his way to the river bank, where he slipped upon some
logs and fell, heavy and elderly as he was, in the mud; but
nevertheless got to Somerset stairs, took a boat, and reached the
Kentish shore in safety. Even now he brazened it out that the law
was on his side, and came back four weeks later prepared to stand
his trial. Once more, for the last time, company overflowed the
house in the Savoy; lawyers abounded, and, as they ate and drank,
assured Dr. Wilkinson that his case was already won. In July 1756
the trial began. But what conclusion could there be? The crime had
been committed and persisted in openly in spite of warning. The
Doctor was found guilty and sentenced to fourteen years'
transportation.</p>

<p>It remained for his friends to fit him out, like the gentleman
he was, for his voyage to America. There, they argued, his gifts of
speech and person would make him welcome, and later his wife and
son could join him. To them he bade farewell in the dismal
precincts of Newgate in March 1757. But contrary winds beat the
ship back to shore; the gout seized on a body enfeebled by pleasure
and adversity; at Plymouth Dr. Wilkinson was transported finally
and for ever. The lead mine undid Jones; the Marriage Act was the
downfall of Wilkinson. Both now sleep in peace, Jones in
Cumberland, Wilkinson, far from his friend (and if their failings
were great, great too were their gifts and graces) on the shores of
the melancholy Atlantic.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. "TWELFTH NIGHT" AT THE OLD
VIC</h2>

<p class="cpb">(* Written in 1933.)</p>

<p>Shakespeareans are divided, it is well known, into three
classes; those who prefer to read Shakespeare in the book; those
who prefer to see him acted on the stage; and those who run
perpetually from book to stage gathering plunder. Certainly there
is a good deal to be said for reading <i>Twelfth Night</i> in the
book if the book can be read in a garden, with no sound but the
thud of an apple falling to the earth, or of the wind ruffling the
branches of the trees. For one thing there is time&mdash;time not
only to hear "the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank of violets"
but to unfold the implications of that very subtle speech as the
Duke winds into the nature of love. There is time, too, to make a
note in the margin; time to wonder at queer jingles like "that live
in her; when liver, brain, and heart"..."and of a foolish knight
that you brought in one night" and to ask oneself whether it was
from them that was born the lovely, "And what should I do in
Illyria? My brother he is in Elysium." For Shakespeare is writing,
it seems, not with the whole of his mind mobilized and under
control but with feelers left flying that sort and play with words
so that the trail of a chance word is caught and followed
recklessly. From the echo of one word is born another word, for
which reason, perhaps, the play seems as we read it to tremble
perpetually on the brink of music. They are always calling for
songs in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, "0 fellow come, the song we had last
night." Yet Shakespeare was not so deeply in love with words but
that he could turn and laugh at them. "They that do dally with
words do quickly make them wanton." There is a roar of laughter and
out burst Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, Maria. Words on their lips are
things that have meaning; that rush and leap out with a whole
character packed in a little phrase. When Sir Andrew says "I was
adored once," we feel that we hold him in the hollow of our hands;
a novelist would have taken three volumes to bring us to that pitch
of intimacy. And Viola, Malvolio, Olivia, the Duke&mdash;the mind
so brims and spills over with all that we know and guess about them
as they move in and out among the lights and shadows of the mind's
stage that we ask why should we imprison them within the bodies of
real men and women? Why exchange this garden for the theatre? The
answer is that Shakespeare wrote for the stage and presumably with
reason. Since they are acting <i>Twelfth Night</i> at the Old Vic,
let us compare the two versions.</p>

<p>Many apples might fall without being heard in the Waterloo Road,
and as for the shadows, the electric light has consumed them all.
The first impression upon entering the Old Vic is overwhelmingly
positive and definite. We seem to have issued out from the shadows
of the garden upon the bridge of the Parthenon. The metaphor is
mixed, but then so is the scenery. The columns of the bridge
somehow suggest an Atlantic liner and the austere splendours of a
classical temple in combination. But the body is almost as
upsetting as the scenery. The actual persons of Malvolio, Sir Toby,
Olivia and the rest expand our visionary characters out of all
recognition. At first we are inclined to resent it. You are not
Malvolio; or Sir Toby either, we want to tell them; but merely
impostors. We sit gaping at the ruins of the play, at the travesty
of the play. And then by degrees this same body or rather all these
bodies together, take our play and remodel it between them. The
play gains immensely in robustness, in solidity. The printed word
is changed out of all recognition when it is heard by other people.
We watch it strike upon this man or woman; we see them laugh or
shrug their shoulders, or tum aside to hide their faces. The word
is given a body as well as a soul. Then again as the actors pause,
or topple over a barrel, or stretch their hands out, the flatness
of the print is broken up as by crevasses or precipices; all the
proportions are changed. Perhaps the most impressive effect in the
play is achieved by the long pause which Sebastian and Viola make
as they stand looking at each other in a silent ecstasy of
recognition. The reader's eye may have slipped over that moment
entirely. Here we are made to pause and think about it; and are
reminded that Shakespeare wrote for the body and for the mind
simultaneously.</p>

<p>But now that the actors have done their proper work of
solidifying and intensifying our impressions, we begin to criticize
them more minutely and to compare their version with our own. We
make Mr. Quartermaine's Malvolio stand beside our Malvolio. And to
tell the truth, wherever the fault may lie, they have very little
in common. Mr. Quartermaine's Malvolio is a splendid gentleman,
courteous, considerate, well bred; a man of parts and humour who
has no quarrel with the world. He has never felt a twinge of vanity
or a moment's envy in his life. If Sir Toby and Maria fool him he
sees through it, we may be sure, and only suffers it as a fine
gentleman puts up with the games of foolish children. Our Malvolio,
on the other hand, was a fantastic complex creature, twitching with
vanity, tortured by ambition. There was cruelty in his teasing, and
a hint of tragedy in his defeat; his final threat had a momentary
terror in it. But when Mr. Quartermaine says "I'll be revenged on
the whole pack of you," we feel merely that the powers of the law
will be soon and effectively invoked. What, then, becomes of
Olivia's "He hath been most notoriously abused"? Then there is
Olivia. Madame Lopokova has by nature that rare quality which is
neither to be had for the asking nor to be subdued by the
will&mdash;the genius of personality. She has only to float on to
the stage and everything round her suffers, not a sea change, but a
change into light, into gaiety; the birds sing, the sheep are
garlanded, the air rings with melody and human beings dance towards
each other on the tips of their toes possessed of an exquisite
friendliness, sympathy and delight. But our Olivia was a stately
lady; of sombre complexion, slow moving, and of few sympathies. She
could not love the Duke nor change her feeling. Madame Lopokova
loves everybody. She is always changing. Her hands, her face, her
feet, the whole of her body, are always quivering in sympathy with
the moment. She could make the moment, as she proved when she
walked down the stairs with Sebastian, one of intense and moving
beauty; but she was not our Olivia. Compared with her the comic
group, Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, Maria, the fool were more than
ordinarily English. Coarse, humorous, robust, they trolled out
their words, they rolled over their barrels; they acted
magnificently. No reader, one may make bold to say, could outpace
Miss Seyler's Maria, with its quickness, its inventiveness, its
merriment; nor add anything to the humours of Mr. Livesey's Sir
Toby. And Miss jeans as Viola was satisfactory; and Mr. Hare as
Antonio was admirable; and Mr. Morland's clown was a good clown.
What, then, was lacking in the play as a whole? Perhaps that it was
not a whole. The fault may lie partly with Shakespeare. It is
easier to act his comedy than his poetry, one may suppose, for when
he wrote as a poet he was apt to write too quick for the human
tongue. The prodigality of his metaphors can be flashed over by the
eye, but the speaking voice falters in the middle. Hence the comedy
was out of proportion to the rest. Then, perhaps, the actors were
too highly charged with individuality or too incongruously cast.
They broke the play up into separate pieces&mdash;now we were in
the groves of Arcady, now in some inn at Blackfriars. The mind in
reading spins a web from scene to scene, compounds a background
from apples falling, and the toll of a church bell, and an owl's
fantastic flight which keeps the play together. Here that
continuity was sacrificed. We left the theatre possessed of many
brilliant fragments but without the sense of all things conspiring
and combining together which may be the satisfying culmination of a
less brilliant performance. Nevertheless, the play has served its
purpose. It has made us compare our Malvolio with Mr.
Quartermaine's; our Olivia with Madame Lopokova's; our reading of
the whole play with Mr. Guthrie's; and since they all differ back
we must go to Shakespeare. We must read <i>Twelfth Night</i> again.
Mr. Guthrie has made that necessary and whetted our appetite for
the <i>Cherry Orchard</i>, <i>Measure for Measure</i>, and <i>Henry
the Eighth</i> that are still to come.</p>

<p>This great lady, this robust and fertile letter writer, who in
our age would probably have been one of the great novelists, takes
up presumably as much space in the consciousness of living readers
as any figure of her vanished age. But it is more difficult to fix
that figure within an outline than so to sum up many of her
contemporaries. That is partly because she created her being, not
in plays or poems, but in letters&mdash;touch by touch, with
repetitions, amassing daily trifles, writing down what came into
her head as if she were talking. Thus the fourteen volumes of her
letters enclose a vast open space, like one of her own great woods;
the rides are crisscrossed with the intricate shadows of branches,
figures roam down the glades, pass from sun to shadow, are lost to
sight, appear again, but never sit down in fixed attitudes to
compose a group.</p>

<p>Thus we live in her presence, and often fall, as with living
people, into unconsciousness. She goes on talking, we half listen.
And then something she says rouses us. We add it to her character,
so that the character grows and changes, and she seems like a
living person, inexhaustible.</p>

<p>This of course is one of the qualities that all letter writers
possess, and she, because of her unconscious naturalness, her flow
and abundance, possesses it far more than the brilliant Walpole,
for example, or the reserved and self-conscious Gray. Perhaps in
the long run we know her more instinctively, more profoundly, than
we know them. We sink deeper down into her, and know by instinct
rather than by reason how she will feel; this she will be amused
by; that will take her fancy; now she will plunge into melancholy.
Her range too is larger than theirs; there is more scope and more
diversity. Everything seems to yield its juice&mdash;its fun, its
enjoyment; or to feed her meditations. She has a robust appetite;
nothing shocks her; she gets nourishment from whatever is set
before her. She is an intellectual, quick to enjoy the wit of La
Rochefoucauld, to relish the fine discrimination of Madame de La
Fayette. She has a natural dwelling place in books, so that
Josephus or Pascal or the absurd long romances of the time are not
read by her so much as embedded in her mind. Their verses, their
stories rise to her lips along with her own thoughts. But there is
a sensibility in her which intensifies this great appetite for many
things. It is of course shown at its most extreme, its most
irrational, in her love for her daughter. She loves her as an
elderly man loves a young mistress who tortures him. It was a
passion that was twisted and morbid; it caused her many
humiliations; sometimes it made her ashamed of herself. For, from
the daughter's point of view it was exhausting, was embarrassing to
be the object of such intense emotion; and she could not always
respond. She feared that her mother was making her ridiculous in
the eyes of her friends. Also she felt that she was not like that.
She was different; colder, more fastidious, less robust. Her mother
was ignoring the real daughter in this flood of adoration for a
daughter who did not exist. She was forced to curb her; to assert
her own identity. It was inevitable that Madame de Sévigné, with
her exacerbated sensibility, should feel hurt.</p>

<p>Sometimes, therefore, Madame de Sévigné weeps. The daughter does
not love her. That is a thought so bitter, and a fear so perpetual
and so profound, that life loses its savour; she has recourse to
sages, to poets to console her; and reflects with sadness upon the
vanity of life; and how death will come. Then, too, she is agitated
beyond what is right or reasonable, because a letter has not
reached her. Then she knows that she has been absurd; and realizes
that she is boring her friends with this obsession. What is worse,
she has bored her daughter. And then when the bitter drop has
fallen, up bubbles quicker and quicker the ebullition of that
robust vitality, of that irrepressible quick enjoyment, that
natural relish for life, as if she instinctively repaired her
failure by fluttering all her feathers; by making every facet
glitter. She shakes herself out of her glooms; makes fun of "les
D'Hacquevilles"; collects a handful of gossip; the latest news of
the King and Madame de Maintenon; how Charles has fallen in love;
how the ridiculous Mademoiselle de Plessis has been foolish again;
when she wanted a handkerchief to spit into, the silly woman
tweaked her nose; or describes how she has been amusing herself by
amazing the simple little girl who lives at the end of the
park&mdash;la petite personne&mdash;with stories of kings and
countries, of all that great world that she who has lived in the
thick of it knows so well. At last, comforted, assured for the time
being at least of her daughter's love, she lets herself relax; and
throwing off all disguises, tells her daughter how nothing in the
world pleases her so well as solitude. She is happiest alone in the
country. She loves rambling alone in her woods. She loves going out
by herself at night. She loves hiding from callers. She loves
walking among her trees and musing. She loves the gardener's
chatter; she loves planting. She loves the gipsy girl who dances,
as her own daughter used to dance, but not of course so
exquisitely.</p>

<p>It is natural to use the present tense, because we live in her
presence. We are very little conscious of a disturbing medium
between us&mdash;that she is living, after all, by means of written
words. But now and then with the sound of her voice in our ears and
its rhythm rising and falling within us, we become aware, with some
sudden phrase, about spring, about a country neighbour, something
struck off in a flash, that we are, of course, being addressed by
one of the great mistresses of the art of speech.</p>

<p>Then we listen for a time, consciously. How, we wonder, does she
contrive to make us follow every word of the story of the cook who
killed himself because the fish failed to come in time for the
royal dinner party; or the scene of the haymaking; or the anecdote
of the servant whom she dismissed in a sudden rage; how does she
achieve this order, this perfection of composition? Did she
practise her art? It seems not. Did she tear up and correct? There
is no record of any painstaking or effort. She says again and again
that she writes her letters as she speaks. She begins one as she
sends off another; there is the page on her desk and she fills it,
in the intervals of all her other avocations. People are
interrupting; servants are coming for orders. She entertains; she
is at the beck and call of her friends. It seems then that she must
have been so imbued with good sense, by the age she lived in, by
the company she kept&mdash;La Rochefoucauld's wisdom, Madame de La
Fayette's conversation, by hearing now a play by Racine, by reading
Montaigne, Rabelais, or Pascal; perhaps by sermons, perhaps by some
of those songs that Coulanges was always singing&mdash;she must
have imbibed so much that was sane and wholesome unconsciously
that, when she took up her pen, it followed unconsciously the laws
she had learnt by heart. Marie de Rabutin it seems was born into a
group where the elements were so richly and happily mixed that it
drew out her virtue instead of opposing it. She was helped, not
thwarted. Nothing baffled or contracted or withered her. What
opposition she encountered was only enough to confirm her judgment.
For she was highly conscious of folly, of vice, of pretention. She
was a born critic, and a critic whose judgments were inborn,
unhesitating. She is always referring her impressions to a
standard&mdash;hence the incisiveness, the depth and the comedy
that make those spontaneous statements so illuminating. There is
nothing naive about her. She is by no means a simple spectator.
Maxims fall from her pen. She sums up; she judges. But it is done
effortlessly. She has inherited the standard and accepts it without
effort. She is heir to a tradition, which stands guardian and gives
proportion. The gaiety, the colour, the chatter, the many movements
of the figures in the foreground have a background. At Les Rochers
there is always Paris and the court; at Paris there is Les Rochers,
with its solitude, its trees, its peasants. And behind them all
again there is virtue, faith, death itself. But this background,
while it gives its scale to the moment, is so well established that
she is secure. She is free, thus anchored, to explore; to enjoy; to
plunge this way and that; to enter wholeheartedly into the myriad
humours, pleasures, oddities, and savours of her well nourished,
prosperous, delightful present moment.</p>

<p>So she passes with free and stately step from Paris to Brittany
from Brittany in her coach and six all across France. She stays
with friends on the road; she is attended by a cheerful company of
familiars. Wherever she alights she attracts at once the love of
some boy or girl; or the exacting admiration of a man of the world
like her disagreeable cousin Bussy Rabutin, who cannot rest under
her disapproval, but must be assured of her good opinion in spite
of all his treachery. The famous and the brilliant also wish to
have her company, for she is part of their world; and can take her
share in their sophisticated conversations. There is something wise
and large and sane about her which draws the confidences of her own
son. Feckless and impulsive, the prey of his own weak and charming
nature as he is, Charles nurses her with the utmost patience
through her rheumatic fever. She laughs at his foibles; knows his
failings. She is tolerant and outspoken; nothing need be hidden
from her; she knows all that there is to be known of man and his
passions.</p>

<p>So she takes her way through the world, and sends her letters,
radiant and glowing with all this various traffic from one end of
France to the other, twice weekly. As the fourteen volumes so
spaciously unfold their story of twenty years it seems that this
world is large enough to enclose everything. Here is the garden
that Europe has been digging for many centuries; into which so many
generations have poured their blood; here it is at last fertilized,
bearing flowers. And the flowers are not those rare and solitary
blossoms&mdash;great men, with their poems, and their conquests.
The flowers in this garden are a whole society of full grown men
and women from whom want and struggle have been removed; growing
together in harmony, each contributing something that the other
lacks. By way of proving it, the letters of Madame de Sévigné are
often shared by other pens; now her son takes up the pen; the Abbé
adds his paragraph; even the simple girl&mdash;la petite
personne&mdash;is not afraid to pipe up on the same page. The month
of May, 1678, at Les Rochers in Brittany, thus echoes with
different voices. There are the birds singing; Pilois is planting;
Madame de Sévigné roams the woods alone; her daughter is
entertaining politicians in Provence; not very far away Monsieur de
Rochefoucauld is engaged in telling the truth with Madame de La
Fayette to prune his words; Racine is finishing the play which soon
they will all be hearing together; and discussing afterwards with
the King and that lady whom in the private language of their set
they call Quanto. The voices mingle; they are all talking together
in the garden in 1678. But what was happening outside?</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. THE HUMANE ART</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in April 1940.)</p>

<p>If at this moment there is little chance of re-reading the
sixteen volumes of the Paget Toynbee edition of Walpole's letters,
while the prospect of possessing the magnificent Yale edition,
where all the letters are to be printed with all the answers,
becomes remote, this sound and sober biography of Horace Walpole by
Mr. Ketton-Cremer may serve at least to inspire some random
thoughts about Walpole and the humane art which owes its origin to
the love of friends.</p>

<p>But, according to his latest biographer, Horace Walpole's
letters were inspired not by the love of friends but by the love of
posterity. He had meant to write the history of his own times.
After twenty years he gave it up, and decided to write another kind
of history&mdash;a history ostensibly inspired by friends but in
fact written for posterity. Thus Mann stood for politics; Gray for
literature; Montagu and Lady Ossory for society. They were pegs,
not friends, each chosen because he was "particularly
connected...with one of the subjects about which he wished to
enlighten and inform posterity." But if we believe that Horace
Walpole was a historian in disguise, we are denying his peculiar
genius as a letter writer. The letter writer is no surreptitious
historian. He is a man of short range sensibility; he speaks not to
the public at large but to the individual in private. All good
letter writers feel the drag of the face on the other side of the
age and obey it&mdash;they take as much as they give. And Horace
Walpole was no exception. There is the correspondence with Cole to
prove it. We can see, in Mr. Lewis's edition, how the Tory parson
develops the radical and the free-thinker in Walpole, how the
middle-class professional man brings to the surface the aristocrat
and the amateur. If Cole had been nothing but a peg there would
have been none of this echo, none of this mingling of voices. It is
true that Walpole had an attitude and a style, and that his letters
have a fine hard glaze upon them that preserves them, like the
teeth of which he was so proud, from the little dents and rubs of
familiarity. And of course&mdash;did he not insist that his letters
must be kept?&mdash;he sometimes looked over his page at the
distant horizon, as Madame de Sévigné, whom he worshipped, did too,
and imagined other people in times to come reading him. But that he
allowed the featureless face of posterity to stand between him and
the very voice and dress of his friends, how they looked and how
they thought, the letters themselves with their perpetual variety
deny. Open them at random. He is writing about politics&mdash;about
Wilkes and Chatham and the signs of coming revolution in France;
but also about a snuffbox; and a red riband; and about two very
small black dogs. Voices upon the stairs interrupt him; more
sightseers have come to see Caligula with his silver eyes; a spark
from the fire has burnt the page he was writing; he cannot keep the
pompous, style any longer, nor mend a careless phrase, and so,
flexible as an eel, he winds from high politics to living faces and
the past and its memories&mdash;&mdash;"I tell you we should get
together, and comfort ourselves with the brave days that we have
known...I wished for you; the same scenes strike us both, and the
same kind of visions has amused us both ever since we were born."
It is not thus that a man writes when his correspondent is a peg
and he is thinking of posterity.</p>

<p>Nor again was he thinking of the great public, which, in a very
few years, would have paid him handsomely for the brilliant pages
that he lavished upon his friends. Was it, then, the growth of
writing as a paid profession, and the change which that change of
focus brought with it that led, in the nineteenth century, to the
decline of this humane art? Friendship flourished, nor was there
any lack of gift. Who could have described a party more brilliantly
than Macaulay or a landscape more exquisitely than Tennyson? But
there, looking them full in the face was the present
moment&mdash;the great gluttonous public; and how can a writer turn
at will from that impersonal stare to the little circle in the
fire-lit room? Macaulay, writing to his sister, can no more drop
his public manner than an actress can scrub her cheeks clean of
paint and take her place naturally at the tea table. And Tennyson
with his fear of publicity&mdash;"While I live the owls, when I die
the ghouls"&mdash;left nothing more succulent for the ghoul to feed
upon than a handful of dry little notes that anybody could read, or
print or put under glass in a museum. News and gossip, the sticks
and straws out of which the old letter writer made his nest, have
been snatched away. The wireless and the telephone have intervened.
The letter writer has nothing now to build with except what is most
private; and how monotonous after a page or two the intensity of
the very private becomes! We long that Keats even should cease to
talk about Fanny, and that Elizabeth and Robert Browning should
slam the door of the sick room and take a breath of fresh air in an
omnibus. Instead of letters posterity will have confessions,
diaries, notebooks, like M. Gide's&mdash;hybrid books in which the
writer talks in the dark to himself about himself for a generation
yet to be born.</p>

<p>Horace Walpole suffered none of these drawbacks. If he was the
greatest of English letter writers it was not only thanks to his
gifts but to his immense good fortune. He had his places to begin
with&mdash;an income of £2,500 dropped yearly into his mouth from
Collectorships and Usherships and was swallowed without a pang.
"...nor can I think myself," he wrote serenely, "as a placeman a
more useless or a less legal engrosser of part of the wealth of the
nation than deans and prebendaries"&mdash;indeed the money was well
invested. But besides those places, there was the other&mdash;his
place in the very centre of the audience, facing the stage. There
he could sit and see without being seen; contemplate without being
called upon to act. Above all he was blessed in his little
public&mdash;a circle that surrounded him with that warm climate in
which he could live the life of incessant changes which is the
breath of a letter writer's existence. Besides the wit and the
anecdote and the brilliant descriptions of masquerades and midnight
revelries his friends drew from him something superficial yet
profound, something changing yet entire&mdash;himself shall we call
it in default of one word for that which friends elicit but the
great public kills? From that sprang his immortality. For a self
that goes on changing is a self that goes on living. As an
historian he would have stagnated among historians. But as a letter
writer he buffets his way among the crowd, holding out a hand to
each generation in turn&mdash;laughed at, criticized, despised,
admired, but always in touch with the living. When Macaulay met him
in October 1833, he struck that hand away in a burst of righteous
indignation. "His mind was a bundle of inconstant whims and
affectations. His features were covered by mask within mask." His
letters, like <i>paté de foie gras</i>, owed their excellence "to
the diseases of the wretched animal which furnishes it"&mdash;such
was Macaulay's greeting. And what greater boon can any writer ask
than to be trounced by Lord Macaulay? We take the reputation he has
gored, repair it and give it another spin and another
direction&mdash;another lease of life. Opinion, as Mr.
Ketton-Cremer says, is always changing about Walpole. "The present
age looks upon him with a more friendly eye" than the last. Is it
that the present age is deafened with boom and blatancy? Does it
hear in Walpole's low tones things that are more interesting, more
penetrating, more true than can be said by the loud speakers?
Certainly there is something wonderful to the present age in the
sight of a whole human being&mdash;of a man so blessed that he
could unfold every gift, every foible, whose long life spreads like
a great lake reflecting houses and friends and wars and snuff boxes
and revolutions and lap dogs, the great and the little, all
intermingled, and behind them a stretch of the serene blue sky.
"Nor will [death] I think see me very unwilling to go with him,
though I have no disappointments, but I came into the world so
early, and have seen so much that I am satisfied." Satisfied with
his life in the flesh, he could be still more satisfied with his
life in the spirit. Even now he is being collected and pieced
together, letter and answer, himself and the reflections of
himself, so that whoever else may die, Horace Walpole is immortal.
Whatever ruin may befall the map of Europe in years to come, there
will still be people, it is consoling to reflect, to hang absorbed
over the map of one human face.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. TWO ANTIQUARIES: WALPOLE AND
COLE</h2>

<p>Since to criticize the Yale edition of Horace Walpole's letters
to Cole is impossible, for there cannot in the whole universe exist
a single human being whose praise or blame of such minute and
monumental learning can be of any value&mdash;if such exists his
knowledge has been tapped already&mdash;the only course for the
reader is to say nothing about the learning and the industry, the
devotion and the skill which have created these two huge volumes,
and to record merely such fleeting thoughts as have formed in the
mind from a single reading. To encourage our selves, let us assert,
though not with entire confidence, that books after all exist to be
read&mdash;even the most learned of editors would to some extent at
least agree with that. But how, the question immediately arises,
can we read this magnificent instalment&mdash;for these are but the
first two volumes of this edition in which Mr. Lewis will give us
the complete correspondence&mdash;of our old friend Horace
Walpole's letters? Ought not the presses to have issued in a
supplementary pocket a supplementary pair of eyes? Then, with the
usual pair fixed upon the text, the additional pair could range the
notes, thus sweeping together into one haul not only what Horace is
saying to Cole and what Cole is saying to Horace, but a multitude
of minor men and matters: for example, Thomas Farmer, who ran away
and left two girls with child; Thomas Wood, who was never drunk but
had a bad constitution and was therefore left fifty pounds and bed
and furniture in Cole's will; Cole's broken leg, how it was broken,
and why it was badly mended; Birch, who had (it is thought) an
apoplectic fit riding in the Hampstead Road, fell from his horse,
and died; Thomas Western (1695-1754), who was one of the
pall-bearers at the funeral of Cole's father; Cole's niece, the
daughter of a wholesale cheesemonger; John Woodyer, a man of placid
disposition and great probity; Mrs. Allen Hopkins, who was born
Mary Thornhill; and, Lord Montfort, who&mdash;but if we want to
know more about that nobleman, his lions and tigers and his
"high-spirited and riotous behaviour," we must look it up for
ourselves in the Harwicke <i>mss</i>. in the British Museum. There
are limits even to Mr. Lewis.</p>

<p>This little haul, taken at random, is enough to show how great a
strain the new method of editing lays upon the eye. But if the
brain is at first inclined to jib at such perpetual solicitations,
and to beg to be allowed to read the text in peace, it adjusts
itself by degrees; grudgingly admits that many of these little
facts are to the point; and finally becomes not merely a convert
but a suppliant&mdash;asks not for less but for more and more and
more. Why, to take one instance only, is not the name of Cole's
temporary cook's sister divulged? Thomas Wood was his servant;
Thomas was left fifty pounds and allowed Cole's coach to run away;
Thomas's younger brother James, known as "Jem," ran errands
successfully and had a child ready to be sworn to him; their
sister, Molly, was for one month at least a cook and helped in the
kitchen. But there was another sister and, after learning all about
the Woods, it is positively painful not to know at least her
Christian name.</p>

<p>Yet it may be asked, what has the name of Cole's cook's sister
got to do with Horace Walpole? That is a question which it is
impossible to answer briefly; but it is proof of the editor's
triumph, justification of his system, and a complete vindication of
his immense labour that he has convinced us, long before the end,
that somehow or other it all hangs together. The only way to read
letters is to read them thus stereoscopically. Horace is partly
Cole; Cole is partly Horace; Cole's cook is partly Cole; therefore
Horace Walpole is partly Cole's cook's sister. Horace, the whole
Horace, is made up of innumerable facts and reflections of facts.
Each is infinitely minute; yet each is essential to the other. To
elicit them and relate them is out of the question. Let us, then,
concentrate for a moment upon the two main figures, in outline.</p>

<p>We have here, then, in conjunction the Honourable Horace Walpole
and the Reverend William Cole. But they were two very different
people. Cole, it is true, had been at Eton with Horace, where he
was called by the famous Walpole group "Tozhy," but he was not a
member of that group, and socially he was greatly Walpole's
inferior. His father was a farmer, Horace's father was a Prime
Minister. Cole's niece was the daughter of a cheesemonger; Horace's
niece married a Prince of the Blood Royal. But Cole was a man of
solid good sense who made no bones of this disparity, and, after
leaving Eton and Cambridge, he had become, in his quiet frequently
flooded parsonage, one of the first antiquaries of the time. It was
this common passion that brought the two friends together
again.</p>

<p>For some reason, obscurely hidden in the psychology of the human
race, the middle years of that eighteenth century which seems now a
haven of bright calm and serene civilization, affected some who
actually lived in it with a longing to escape&mdash;from its
politics, from its wars, from its follies, from its drabness and
its dullness, to the superior charms of the Middle Ages.
"I...hope," wrote Cole in 1765, "by the latter end of the week to
be among my admired friends of the twelfth or thirteenth century.
Indeed you judge very right concerning my indifference about what
is going forward in the world, where I live in it as though I was
no way concerned about it except in paying, with my contemporaries,
the usual taxes and impositions. In good truth I am very
indifferent about my Lord Bute or Mr. Pitt, as I have long been
convinced and satisfied in my own mind that all oppositions are
from the ins and the outs, and that power and wealth and dignity
are the things struggled for, not the good of the whole...I hope
what I have said will not be offensive." Only one weekly newspaper,
the <i>Cambridge Chronicle</i>, brought him news of the present
moment. There at Bletchley or at Milton he sat secluded, wrapped up
from the least draught, for he was terribly subject to sore
throats; sometimes issuing forth to conduct a service, for he was,
incidentally, a clergyman; driving occasionally to Cambridge to
hobnob with his cronies; but always returning with delight to his
study, where he copied maps, filled in coats of arms, and pored
assiduously over those budgets of old manuscripts which were, as he
said, "wife and children" to him. Now and again, it is true, he
looked out of the window at the antics of his dog, for whose future
he was careful to provide, or at those guinea fowl whose eggs he
begged off Horace&mdash;for "I have so few amusements and can see
these creatures from my study window when I can't stir out of my
room."</p>

<p>But neither dog nor guinea fowl seriously distracted him. The
hundred and fourteen folio volumes left by him to the British
Museum testify to his professional industry. And it was precisely
that quality&mdash;his professional industry&mdash;that brought the
two so dissimilar men together. For Horace Walpole was by
temperament an amateur. He was not, Cole admitted, "a true, genuine
antiquary"; nor did he think himself one. "Then I have a wicked
quality in an antiquary, nay one that annihilates the essence; that
is, I cannot bring myself to a habit of minute accuracy about very
indifferent points," Horace admitted. "...I bequeath free leave of
correction to the microscopic intellects of my continuators." But
he had what Cole lacked&mdash;imagination, taste, style, in
addition to a passion for the romantic past, so long as that
romantic past was also a civilized past, for mere "bumps in the
ground" or "barrows and tumuli and Roman camps" bored him to death.
Above all, he had a purse long enough to give visible and tangible
expression&mdash;in prints, in gates, in Gothic temples, in bowers,
in old manuscripts, in a thousand gimcracks and "brittle transitory
relics" to the smouldering and inarticulate passion that drove the
professional antiquary to delve like some indefatigable mole
underground in the darkness of the past. Horace liked his brittle
relics to be pretty, and to be authentic, and he was always eager
to be put on the track of more.</p>

<p>The greater part of the correspondence thus is concerned with
antiquaries' gossip; with parish registers and cartularies; with
coats of arms and the Christian names of bishops; with the
marriages of kings' daughters; skeletons and prints; old gold rings
found in a field; dates and genealogies; antique chairs in Fen
farmhouses; bits of stained glass and old Apostle spoons. For
Horace was furnishing Strawberry Hill; and Cole was prodigiously
adept at stuffing it, until there was scarcely room to stick
another knife or fork, and the gorged owner of all this priceless
lumber had to cry out: "I shudder when the bell rings at the gate.
It is as bad as keeping an inn." All the week he was plagued with
staring crowds.</p>

<p>Were this all it would be, and indeed it sometimes is, a little
monotonous. But they were two very different men. They struck
unexpected sparks in one another. Cole's Walpole was not Conway's
Walpole; nor was Walpole's Cole the good-natured old parson of the
diary. Cole, of course, stressed the antiquary in Walpole; but he
also brought out very clearly the limits of the antiquary in
Walpole. Against Cole's monolithic passion his own appears
frivolous and flimsy. On the other hand, in contrast with Cole's
slow-plodding pen, his own shows its mettle. He cannot flash, it is
true&mdash;the subject, say, the names of Edward the Fourth's
daughters, forbids it&mdash;yet how sweetly English sings on his
side of the page, now in a colloquialism&mdash;"a more flannel
climate"&mdash;that Cole would never have ventured; now in a strain
of natural music&mdash;"Methinks as we grow old, our only business
here is to adorn the graves of our friends or to dig our own." That
strain was called forth by the death of their common friend, Thomas
Gray. It was a death that struck at Cole's heart, too, but produced
no such echo in that robust organ. At the mere threat of Conway's
death, Horace was all of a twitter&mdash;his nerves were "so
aspen." It was a threat only; "Still has it operated such a
revolution in my mind, as no time, <i>at my age</i>, can efface. I
have had dreams in which I thought I wished for fame&mdash;...I
feel, I feel it was confined to the memory of those I
love"&mdash;to which Cole replies: "For both your sakes I hope he
will soon get well again. It is a misfortune to have so much
sensibility in one's nature as you are endued with: sufficient are
one's own distresses without the additional encumbrance of those of
one's friends."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Cole was by no means without distresses of his
own. There was that terrible occasion when the horses ran away and
his hat blew off and he sat with his legs in the air anticipating
either death at the tollgate or a bad cold. Mercifully both were
spared him. Again, he suffered tortures when, showing Dr. Gulston
his prints, he begged him, as a matter of form, to take any he
liked; whereupon Gulston&mdash;"that Algerine hog"&mdash;filled his
portfolio with the most priceless. It is true that Cole made him
pay for them in the end, but it was a most distressing business.
And then what an agony it was when some fellow antiquaries dined
with him, and, confined with the gout, he had to let them visit his
study alone, to find next morning that an octavo volume, and a
borrowed volume at that, was missing! "The Master is too honourable
to take such a step," but&mdash;he had his suspicions. And what was
he to do? To confess the loss or to conceal it? To conceal it
seemed better, and yet, if the owner found out, "I am undone."
Horace was all sympathy. He loathed the whole tribe of
antiquaries&mdash;"numskulls" he called them mumbling manuscripts
with their toothless jaws. "Their understandings seem as much in
ruins as the things they describe," he wrote. "I love antiquities,
but I scarce ever knew an antiquary who knew how to write upon
them."</p>

<p>He had all the aristocrat's contempt for the professional
drudge, and no desire whatsoever to be included among the sacred
band of professional authors. "They are always in earnest, and
think their profession serious, and dwell upon trifles, and
reverence learning," he snapped out. And yet, when writing to Cole
he could confess what to a man of his own class he would have
concealed&mdash;that he, too, reverenced learning when it was real,
and admired no one more than a poet if he were genuine. "A page in
a great author humbles me to the dust," he wrote. And after
deriding his contemporaries added, "Don't think me scornful.
Recollect that I have seen Pope, and lived with Gray."</p>

<p>Certainly Cole's obscure but bulky form revealed a side of
Horace Walpole that was lost in the glitter of the great world.
With that solid man of no social gift but prodigious erudition
Horace showed himself not an antiquary, not a poet, not an
historian, but what he was&mdash;the aristocrat of letters, the
born expert who knew the sham intellect from the genuine as surely
as the antiquary knew the faked genealogy from the authentic. When
Horace Walpole praised Pope and Gray he knew what he was saying and
meant it; and his shame at being hoisted into such high society as
theirs rings true. "I know not how others feel on such occasions,
but if anyone happens to praise me, all my faults gush into my
face, and make me turn my eyes inward and outward with horror. What
am I but a poor old skeleton, tottering towards the grave, and
conscious of ten thousand weaknesses, follies, and worse! And for
talents, what are mine, but trifling and superficial; and, compared
with those of men of real genius, most diminutive!...Does it become
us, at past threescore each, to be saying fine things to one
another? Consider how soon we shall both be nothing!" That is a
tone of voice that he does not use in speaking&mdash;for his
writing voice was a speaking voice&mdash;to his friends in the
great world.</p>

<p>Again, Cole's High Church and Tory convictions when they touched
a very different vein in Walpole sometimes caused explosions. Once
or twice the friends almost came to blows over religion. The Church
of England had a substantial place in Cole's esteem. But to
Walpole, "Church and presbytery are human nonsense invented by
knaves to govern fools. <i>Exalted notions of church matters</i>
are contradictions in terms to the lowliness and humility of the
gospel. There is nothing sublime but the Divinity. Nothing is
sacred but as His work. A tree or a brute stone is more respectable
as such, than a mortal called an archbishop, or an edifice called a
church, which are the puny and perishable productions of men...A
Gothic church or convent fill one with romantic dreams&mdash;but
for the mysterious, the Church in the abstract, it is a jargon that
means nothing or a great deal too much, and I reject it and its
apostles from Athanasius to Bishop Keene." Those were outspoken
words to a friend who wore a black coat. Yet they were not suffered
to break up an intimacy of forty years. Cole, to whom Walpole's
little weaknesses were not unknown, contented himself by commenting
sardonically at the end of the letter upon the lowliness and
humility of the aristocracy, observed that "Mr. Walpole is piqued,
I can see, at my reflections on Abbot's flattery"; but in his reply
to Mr. Walpole he referred only to the weather, Mr. Tyson, and the
gout.</p>

<p>Horace's politics were equally detestable to Cole. He was, in
writing at least, a red-hot republican, the bitter enemy of all
those Tory principles that Cole revered. That, again, was a
difference that sometimes raised the temperature of the letters to
fever heat&mdash;happily for us, for it allows us, reading over
their shoulders, to see Horace Walpole roused&mdash;the dilettante
become a man of action, chafing at his own inactivity "sitting with
one's arms folded" in a chair; deploring his country's danger;
remembering that if Cole is a country clergyman, he is a Walpole;
the son of a Prime Minister; that his father's son might have done
more than fill Strawberry Hill with Gothic ornaments; and that his
father's reputation is extremely dear to him. And yet did not
gossip whisper that he was not his father's son, and was there not,
somewhere deep within him, an uneasy suspicion that there was a
blot on his scutcheon, a freakish strain in his clear Norfolk
blood?</p>

<p>Whoever his father may have been, his mother nature had somehow
queered the pitch of that very complex human being who was called
Horace Walpole. He was not simple; he was not single. As Cole noted
with antiquarian particularity, Mr. Walpole's letter of Friday, May
21St, 1762, was sealed with a "seal of red wax, a cupid with a
large mask of a monkey's face. An antique. Oval." The cupid and the
monkey had each set their stamp on Horace Walpole's wax. He was
mischievous and obscene; he gibbered and mocked and pelted the holy
shrines with nutshells. And yet with what a grace he did
it&mdash;with what ease and brilliancy and wit! In body, too, he
was a contradiction&mdash;lean as a grasshopper, yet tough as
steel. He was lapped in luxury, yet never wore a great-coat, ate
and drank as little as a fasting friar, and walked on wet grass in
slippers. He fribbled away his time collecting bric-a-brac and
drinking tea with old ladies; yet wrote the best letters in the
language in the midst of the chatter; knew everyone; went
everywhere; and, as he said, "lived post." He seemed sometimes as
heartless as a monkey; drove Chatterton, so people said, to
suicide, and allowed old Madame du Deffand to die alone in despair.
And yet who but Cupid wrote when Gray was dead, "I treated him
insolently; he loved me and I did not think he did"? Or again, "One
loves to find people care for one, when they can have no view in
it"? But it is futile to make such contradictions clash. There were
a thousand subtler impressions stamped on the wax of Horace
Walpole, and it is only posterity, for whom he had a great
affection, who will be able, when they have read all that he wrote
to Mann and Conway and Gray and the sisters Berry and Madame du
Deffand and a score of others; and what they wrote to him; and the
innumerable notes at the bottom of the page about cooks and
scullions and gardeners and old women in inns&mdash;it is only they
who will be able, when Mr. Lewis has brought his magnificent work
to an end, to say what indeed Horace Walpole was. Meanwhile, we,
who only catch a fleeting glimpse and set down hastily what we make
of it, can testify that he is the best company in the
world&mdash;the most amusing, the most intriguing&mdash;the
strangest mixture of ape and Cupid that ever was.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. THE REV WILLIAM COLE</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in 1932.)</p>

<p><b>A LETTER</b>
</p>

<p>My Dear William,</p>

<p>In my opinion you are keeping something back. Last year when you
went to Paris and did not see Madame du Deffand but measured the
exact length of every nose on every tombstone&mdash;I can assure
you they have grown no longer or shorter since&mdash;I was annoyed,
I admit. But I had the sense to see that, after all, you were
alive, and a clergyman, and from Bletchley&mdash;in fact, you were
as much out of place in Paris as a cowslip impaled upon the diamond
horns of a duchess's tiara. Put him back in Bletchley, I said,
plant him in his own soil, let him burble on in his own fashion,
and the miracle will happen. The cows will low; the church bells
will ring; all Bletchley will come alive; and, reading over
William's shoulder, we shall see deep, deep into the hearts of Mrs.
Willis and Mr. Robinson.</p>

<p>I regret to tell you that I was wrong. You are not a cowslip.
You do not bloom. The hearts of Mrs. Willis and Mr. Robinson remain
sealed books to us. You write January 16th, 1766, and it is
precisely as if I had written January 16th, 1932. In other words,
you have rubbed all the bloom off two hundred years and that is so
rare a feat&mdash;it implies something so queer in the
writer&mdash;that I am intrigued and puzzled and cannot help asking
you to enlighten me. Are you simply a bore, William? No that is out
of the question. In the first place, Horace Walpole did not
tolerate bores, or write to them, or go for country jaunts with
them; in the second, Miss Waddell loves you. You shed all round
you, in the eyes of Miss Waddell, that mysterious charm which those
we love impart to their meanest belongings. She loves your parrot;
she commiserates your cat. Every room in your house is familiar to
her. She knows about your Gothic chamber and your neat arched bed;
she knows how many steps led up to the pantry and down to the
summer house; she knows, she approves, how you spent every hour of
your day. She sees the neighbours through the light of your eyes.
She laughs at some; she likes others; she knows who was fat and who
was thin, and who told lies, who had a bad leg, and who was no
better than she should have been. Mr. and Mrs. Barton, Thomas
Tansley, Mr. and Mrs. Lord of Mursley, the Diceys, and Dr.
Pettingal are all real and alive to her: so are your roses, your
horses, your nectarines and your knats.</p>

<p>Would that I could see through her eyes! Alas, wherever I look I
see blight and mildew. The moss never grows upon your walls. Your
nectarines never ripen. The blackbird sings, but out of tune. The
knats&mdash;and you say "I hardly know a place so pestered with
that vermin as Bletchley"&mdash;bite, just like our gnats. As for
the human beings they pass through the same disenchantment. Not
that I have any fault to find with your friends or with Bletchley
either. Nobody is very good, but then nobody is very bad. Tom
sometimes hits a hare, oftener he misses; the fish sometimes bite,
but not always; if it freezes it also thaws, and though the harvest
was not bad it might have been better. But now, William, confess.
We know in our hearts, you and I, that England in the eighteenth
century was not like this. We know from Woodforde, from Walpole,
from Thomas Turner, from Skinner, from Gray, from Fielding, from
Jane Austen, from scores of memoirs and letters, from a thousand
forgotten stone masons, bricklayers and cabinet makers, from a
myriad sources, that I have not learning to name or space to quote,
that England was a substantial, beautiful country in the eighteenth
century; aristocratic and common; hand-made and horse-ploughed; an
eating, drinking, bastard-begetting, laughing, cursing, humorous,
eccentric, lovable land. If with your pen in your hand and the
dates facing you, January 16th, 1766, you see none of all this,
then the fault is yours. Some spite has drawn a veil across your
eyes. Indeed, there are pouches under them I could swear. You
slouch as you walk. You switch at thistles half-heartedly with your
stick. You do not much enjoy your food. Gossip has no relish for
you. You mention the "scandalous story of Mr. Felton Hervey, his
two daughters and a favourite footman" and add, "I hope it is not
true." So do I, but I cannot put much life into my hoping when you
withhold the facts. You stop Pettingal in the middle of his
boasting&mdash;you cut him short with a sarcasm&mdash;just as he
was proving that the Greeks liked toasted cheese and was deriving
the word Bergamy from the Arabic. As for Madame Geoffrin, you never
lose a chance of saying something disobliging about that lady; a
coffee-pot has only to be reputed French for you to defame it. Then
look how touchy you are&mdash;you grumble, the servants are late
with the papers, you complain, Mr. Pitt never thanked you for the
pigeons (yet Horace Walpole thought you a philosopher); then how
you suspect people's motives; how you bid fathers thrash their
little boys; how you are sure the servant steals the onions. All
these are marks of a thin-blooded poverty-stricken disposition. And
yet&mdash;you are a good man; you visit the poor; you bury the
infected; you have been educated at Cambridge; you venerate
antiquity. The truth is that you are concealing something, even
from Miss Waddell.</p>

<p>Why, I ask, did you write this diary and lock it in a chest with
iron hoops and insist that no one was to read it or publish it for
twenty years after your death unless it were that you had something
on your mind, something that you wished to confess and get rid of?
You are not one of those people who love life so well that they
cherish even the memory of roast mutton, like Woodforde; you did
not hate life so much that you must shriek out your curse on it,
Eke poor Skinner. You write and write, ramblingly, listlessly, like
a person who is trying to bring himself to say the thing that will
explain to himself what is wrong with himself. And you find it very
hard. You would rather mention anything but that&mdash;Miss
Chester, I mean, and the boat on the Avon. You cannot force
yourself to admit that you have kept that lock of hair in your
drawer these thirty years. When Mrs. Robinson, her daughter, asked
you for it (March 19th 1766) you said you could not find it. But
you were not easy under that concealment. You did at length go to
your private drawer (November 26th, 1766) and there it was, as you
well knew. But even so, with the lock of hair in your hand, you
still seek to put us off the scent. You ramble on about giving Mrs.
Robinson a barrel of oysters; about potted rabbits; about the
weather, until suddenly out it comes, "Gave Mrs. Robinson a braided
Lock of Lady Robinson's Mother's hair (and Sister to Mrs. Robinson
of Cransley), which I cut off in a Boat on the River Avon at Bath
about 30 years ago when my Sister Jane and myself were much
acquainted with her, then Miss Chester." There we have it. The
poisoned tooth is out. You were once young and ardent and very much
in love. Passion overcame you. You were alone. The wind blew a lock
of Miss Chester's hair from beneath her hat. You reached forward.
You cut it. And then? Nothing. That is your tragedy&mdash;you
yourself failed yourself. You think of that scene twenty times a
day, I believe, as you saunter, rather heavily; along the damp
paths at Bletchley. That is the dreary little tune that you hum as
you stoop over your parments measuring noses, deciphering
dates&mdash;"I failed, failed, failed on the boat on the Avon."
That is why your nectarines are blighted; and the parrot dies; and
the parlour cat is scalded; and you love nobody except, perhaps,
your little dun-coloured horse. That is why you "always had a mind
to live retired in Glamorganshire." That is why Mr. Pitt never
thanked you for the pigeons. That is why Mr. Stonehewer became His
Majesty's Historiographer, while you visited paupers in Fenny
Stratford. That is why he never came to see you, and why you
observed so bitterly, that "people suffer themselves to forget
their old friends when they are surrounded by the great and are got
above the world." You see, William, if you hoard a failure, if you
come to grudge even the sun for shining&mdash;and that, I think, is
what you did&mdash;fruit does not ripen; a blight falls upon
parrots and cats; people would actually rather that you did not
give them pigeons.</p>

<p>But enough. I may be wrong. Miss Chester's hair may have nothing
to do with it. And Miss Waddell may be right&mdash;every good
quality of heart and head may be yours. I am sure I hope so. But I
beg, William, now that you are about to begin a fresh volume, at
Cambridge too, with men of character and learning, that you will
pull yourself together. Speak out. Justify the faith that Miss
Waddell has in you. For you are keeping one of the finest scholars
of her time shut up in the British Museum among mummies and
policemen and wet umbrellas. There must be a trifle of ninety-five
volumes more of you in those iron-bound chests. Lighten her task;
relieve our anxiety, and so add to the gratitude of your obliged
obedient servant,</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>16. THE HISTORIAN AND "THE
GIBBON"</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in March 1937.)</p>

<p>"Yet, upon the whole, the <i>History of the Decline and Fall</i>
seems to have struck root, both at home and abroad, and may,
perhaps, a hundred years hence still continue to be abused." So
Gibbon wrote in the calm confidence of immortality; and let us
confirm him in his own opinion of his book by showing, in the first
place, that it has one quality of permanence&mdash;it still excites
abuse. Few people can read the whole of the <i>Decline and Fall</i>
without admitting that some chapters have glided away without
leaving a trace; that many pages are no more than a concussion of
sonorous sounds; and that innumerable figures have passed across
the stage without printing even their names upon our memories. We
seem, for hours on end, mounted on a celestial rocking-horse which,
as it gently sways up and down, remains rooted to a single spot. In
the soporific idleness thus induced we recall with regret the vivid
partisanship of Macaulay, the fitful and violent poetry of Carlyle.
We suspect that the vast fame with which the great historian is
surrounded is one of those vague diffusions of acquiescence which
gather when people are too busy, too lazy or too timid to see
things for themselves. And to justify this suspicion it is easy to
gather pomposities of diction&mdash;the Church has become "the
sacred edifice"; and sentences so stereotyped that they chime like
bells&mdash;"destroyed the confidence" must be followed by "and
excited the resentment"; while characters are daubed in with single
epithets like "the vicious" or "the virtuous," and are so crudely
jointed that they seem capable only of the extreme antics of
puppets dangling from a string. It is easy, in short, to suppose
that Gibbon owed some part of his fame to the gratitude of
journalists on whom he bestowed the gift of a style singularly open
to imitation and well adapted to invest little ideas with large
bodies. And then we turn to the book again, and to our amazement we
find that the rocking-horse has left the ground; we are mounted on
a winged steed; we are sweeping in wide circles through the air and
below us Europe unfolds; the ages change and pass; a miracle has
taken place.</p>

<p>But miracle is not a word to use in writing of Gibbon. If
miracle there was it lay in the inexplicable fact which Gibbon, who
seldom stresses a word, himself thought worthy of italics: "...I
<i>know</i> by experience, that from my early youth I aspired to
the character of an historian." Once that seed was planted so
mysteriously in the sickly boy whose erudition amazed his tutor
there was more of the rational than of the miraculous in the
process by which that gift was developed and brought to fruition.
Nothing, in the first place, could have been more cautious, more
deliberate and more far-sighted than Gibbon's choice of a subject.
A historian he had to be; but historian of what? The history of the
Swiss was rejected; the history of Florence was rejected; for a
long time he played with the idea of a life of Sir Walter Raleigh.
Then that, too, was rejected and for reasons that are extremely
illuminating:</p>

<blockquote>...I should shrink with terror from the modern history
of England, where every character is a problem, and every reader a
friend or an enemy; where a writer is supposed to hoist a flag of
party, and is devoted to damnation by the adverse faction...I must
embrace a safer and more extensive theme.</blockquote>

<p>But once found, how was he to treat the distant, the safe, the
extensive theme? An attitude, a style had to be adopted; one
presumably that generalized, since problems of character were to be
avoided; that abolished the writer's personality, since he was not
dealing with his own times and contemporary questions; that was
rhythmical and fluent, rather than abrupt and intense, since vast
stretches of time had to be covered, and the reader carried
smoothly through many folios of print.</p>

<p>At last the problem was solved; the fusion was complete; matter
and manner became one; we forget the style, and are only aware that
we are safe in the keeping of a great artist. He is able to make us
see what he wants us to see and in the right proportions. Here he
compresses; there he expands. He transposes, emphasizes, omits in
the interests of order and drama. The features of the individual
faces are singularly conventionalized. Here are none of those
violent gestures and unmistakable voices that fill the pages of
Carlyle and Macaulay with living human beings who are related to
ourselves. There are no Whigs and Tories here; no eternal verities
and implacable destinies. Time has cut off those quick reactions
that make us love and hate. The innumerable figures are suffused in
the equal blue of the far distance. They rise and fall and pass
away without exciting our pity or our anger. But if the figures are
small, they are innumerable; if the scene is dim it is vast. Armies
wheel; hordes of barbarians are destroyed; forests are huge and
dark; processions are splendid; altars rise and fall; one dynasty
succeeds another. The richness, the variety of the scene absorb us.
He is the most resourceful of entertainers. Without haste or effort
he swings his lantern where he chooses. If sometimes the size of
the whole is oppressive, and the unemphatic story monotonous,
suddenly in the flash of a phrase a detail is lit up: we see the
monks "in the lazy gloom of their convents"; statues become
unforgettably "that inanimate people"; the "gilt and variegated
armour" shines out: the splendid names of kings and countries are
sonorously intoned; or the narrative parts and a scene opens:</p>

<blockquote>By the order of Probus, a great quantity of large
trees, torn up by the roots, were transplanted into the midst of
the circus. The spacious and shady forest was immediately filled
with a thousand ostriches, a thousand stags, a thousand fallow
deer, and a thousand wild boars; and all this variety of game was
abandoned to the riotous impetuosity of the multitude...The air was
continually refreshed by the playing of fountains, and profusely
impregnated by the grateful scent of aromatics. In the centre of
the edifice, the arena, or stage, was strewed with the finest sand,
and successively assumed the most different forms. At one moment it
seemed to rise out of the earth, like the garden of Hesperides, and
was afterwards broken into the rocks and caverns of
Thrace...</blockquote>

<p>But it is only when we come to compress and dismember one of
Gibbon's pictures that we realize how carefully the parts have been
chosen, how firmly the sentences, composed after a certain number
of turns round the room and then tested by the ear and only then
written down, adhere together.</p>

<p>But these are qualities, it might be said, that belong to the
historical novelist&mdash;to Scott or to Flaubert. And Gibbon was
an historian, so religiously devoted to the truth that he felt an
aspersion upon his accuracy as an aspersion upon his character.
Flights of notes at the bottom of the page check his pageants and
verify his characters. Thus they have a different quality from
scenes and characters composed from a thousand hints and
suggestions in the freedom of the imagination. They are inferior,
perhaps, in subtlety and in intensity. On the other hand, as Gibbon
pointed out, "The Cyropaedia is vague and languid; the Anabasis
circumstantial and animated. Such is the eternal difference between
fiction and truth."</p>

<p>The imagination of the novelist must often fail; but the
historian can repose himself upon fact. And even if those facts are
sometimes dubious and capable of more than one interpretation, they
bring the reason into play and widen our range of interest. The
vanished generations, invisible separately, have collectively spun
round them intricate laws, erected marvellous structures of
ceremony and belief. These can be described, analysed, recorded.
The interest with which we follow him in his patient and impartial
examination has an excitement peculiar to itself. History may be,
as he tells us, "little more than the register of the crimes,
follies, and misfortunes of mankind"; but we seem, at least, as we
read him raised above the tumult and the chaos into a clear and
rational air.</p>

<blockquote>The victories and the civilization of Constantine no
longer influence the state of Europe; but a considerable portion of
the globe still retains the impression which it received from the
conversion of that monarch; and the ecclesiastical institutions of
his reign are still connected, by an indissoluble chain, with the
opinions, the passions, and the interests of the present
generation.</blockquote>

<p>He is not merely a master of the pageant and the story; he is
also the critic and the historian of the mind.</p>

<p>It is here of course that we become conscious of the
idiosyncrasy and of the limitations of the writer. Just as we know
that Macaulay was a nineteenth-century Whig, and Carlyle a Scottish
peasant with the gift of prophecy, so we know that Gibbon was
rooted in the eighteenth century and indelibly stamped with its
character and his own. Gradually, stealthily, with a phrase here, a
gibe there, the whole solid mass is leavened with the peculiar
quality of his temperament. Shades of meaning reveal themselves;
the pompous language becomes delicate and exact. Sometimes a phrase
is turned edgewise, so that as it slips with the usual suavity into
its place it leaves a scratch. "He was even destitute of a sense of
honour, which so frequently supplies the sense of public virtue."
Or the solemn rise and fall of the text above is neatly diminished
by the demure particularity of a note. "The ostrich's neck is three
feet long, and composed of seventeen vertebrae. See Buffon. Hist.
Naturelle." The infallibility of historians is gravely mocked.
"...their knowledge will appear gradually to increase, as their
means of information must have diminished, a circumstance which
frequently occurs in historical disquisitions." Or we are urbanely
asked to reflect how,</p>

<blockquote>in our present state of existence, the body is so
inseparably connected with the soul, that it seems to be to our
interest to taste, with innocence and moderation, the enjoyments of
which that faithful companion is susceptible.</blockquote>

<p>The infirmities of that faithful companion provide him with a
fund of perpetual amusement. Sex, for some reason connected,
perhaps, with his private life, always excites a demure smile:</p>

<blockquote>Twenty-two acknowledged concubines, and a library of
sixty-two thousand volumes, attested the variety of his
inclinations; and from the productions which he left behind him, it
appears that the former as well as the latter were designed for use
rather than for ostentation.</blockquote>

<p>The change upon such phrases is rung again and again. Few
virgins or matrons, nuns or monks leave his pages with their honour
entirely unscathed. But his most insidious raillery, his most
relentless reason, are directed, of course, against the Christian
religion.</p>

<p>Fanaticism, asceticism, superstition were naturally antipathetic
to him. Wherever he found them, in life or in religion, they roused
his contempt and derision. The two famous chapters in which he
examined "the <i>human</i> causes of the progress and establishment
of Christianity," though inspired by the same love of truth which
in other connections excited the admiration of scholars, roused
great scandal at the time. Even the eighteenth century, that "age
of light and liberty," was not entirely open to the voice of
reason. "How many souls have his writings polluted!" Hannah More
exclaimed when she heard of his death. "Lord preserve others from
their contagion!" In such circumstances irony was the obvious
weapon; the pressure of public opinion forced him to be covert, not
open. And irony is a dangerous weapon; it easily becomes sidelong
and furtive; the ironist seems to be darting a poisoned tongue from
a place of concealment. However grave and temperate Gibbon's irony
at its best, however searching his logic and robust his contempt
for the cruelty and intolerance of superstition, we sometimes feel,
as he pursues his victim with incessant scorn, that he is a little
limited, a little superficial, a little earthy, a little too
positively and imperturbably a man of the eighteenth century and
not of our own.</p>

<p>But then he is Gibbon; and even historians, as Professor Bury
reminds us, have to be themselves. History "is in the last resort
somebody's image of the past, and the image is conditioned by the
mind and experience of the person who forms it." Without his
satire, his irreverence, his mixture of sedateness and slyness, of
majesty and mobility, and above all that belief in reason which
pervades the whole book and gives it unity, an implicit if unspoken
message, the <i>Decline and Fall</i> would be the work of another
man. It would be the work indeed of two other men. For as we read
we are perpetually creating another book, perceiving another
figure. The sublime person of "the historian" as the Sheffields
called him is attended by a companion whom they called, as if he
were the solitary specimen of some extinct race, "the Gibbon." The
Historian and the Gibbon go hand in hand. But it is not easy to
draw even a thumbnail sketch of this strange being because the
autobiography, or rather the six autobiographies, compose a
portrait of such masterly completeness and authority that it defies
our attempts to add to it. And yet no autobiography is ever final;
there is always something for the reader to add from another
angle.</p>

<p>There is the body, in the first place&mdash;the body with all
those little physical peculiarities that the outsider sees and uses
to interpret what lies within. The body in Gibbon's case was
ridiculous&mdash;prodigiously fat, enormously top-heavy,
precariously balanced upon little feet upon which he spun round
with astonishing alacrity. Like Goldsmith he over-dressed, and for
the same reason perhaps&mdash;to supply the dignity which nature
denied him. But unlike Goldsmith, his ugliness caused him no
embarrassment or, if so, he had mastered it completely. He talked
incessantly, and in sentences composed as carefully as his writing.
To the sharp and irreverent eyes of contemporaries his vanity was
perceptible and ridiculous; but it was only on the surface. There
was something hard and muscular in the obese little body which
turned aside the sneers of the fine gentlemen. He had roughed it,
not only in the Hampshire Militia, but among his equals. He had
supped "at little tables covered with a napkin, in the middle of a
coffee room, upon a bit of cold meat or a Sandwich," with twenty or
thirty of the first men in the kingdom, before he retired to rule
supreme over the first families of Lausanne. It was in London,
among the distractions of society and politics, that he achieved
that perfect poise, that perfect balance between work, society and
the pleasures of the senses which composed his wholly satisfactory
existence. And the balance had not been arrived at without a
struggle. He was sickly; he had a spendthrift for a father; he was
expelled from Oxford; his love affair was thwarted; he was short of
money and had none of the advantages of birth. But he turned
everything to profit. From his lack of health he learnt the love of
books; from the barrack and the guardroom he learnt to understand
the common people; from his exile he learnt the smallness of the
English cloister; and from poverty and obscurity how to cultivate
the amenities of human intercourse.</p>

<p>At last it seemed as if life itself were powerless to unseat
this perfect master of her uncertain paces. The final
buffet&mdash;the loss of his sinecure&mdash;was turned to supreme
advantage; a perfect house, a perfect friend, a perfect society at
once placed themselves at his service, and without loss of time or
temper Gibbon entered a post-chaise with Caplin his valet and Muff
his dog and bowled over Westminster Bridge to finish his history
and enjoy his maturity in circumstances that were ideal.</p>

<p>But as we run over the familiar picture there is something that
eludes us. It may be that we have not been able to find out
anything for ourselves. Gibbon has always been before us. His
self-knowledge was consummate; he had no illusions either about
himself or about his work. He had chosen his part and he played it
to perfection. Even that characteristic attitude, with his
snuff-box in his hand and his body stretched out, he had noted
himself, and perhaps he had adopted it as consciously as he
observed it. But it is his silence that is most baffling. Even in
the letters, where he drops the Historian and shortens himself now
and then to "the Gib," there are long pauses when nothing is heard
even at Sheffield Place of what is going on in the study at
Lausanne.</p>

<p>The artist after all is a solitary being. Twenty years spent in
the society of the <i>Decline and Fall</i> are twenty years spent
in solitary communion with distant events, with intricate problems
of arrangement, with the minds and bodies of the dead. Much that is
important to other people loses its importance; the perspective is
changed when the eyes are fixed not upon the foreground but upon
the mountains, not upon a living woman but upon "my other wife, the
<i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>." And it is difficult,
after casting firm sentences that will withstand the tread of time.
to say "in three words, I am alone." It is only now and then that
we catch a phrase that has not been stylized, or see a little
picture that he has not been able to include in the majestic
design. For example, when Lord Sheffield bursts out in his
downright way, "You are a right good friend...," we see the obese
little man impetuously and impulsively hoisting himself into a
post-chaise and crossing a Europe ravaged by revolution to comfort
a widower. And again when the old stepmother at Bath takes up her
pen and quavers out a few uncomposed and unliterary sentences we
see him:</p>

<blockquote>I truely rejoice, &amp; congratulate you on your being
once more safely arrived in your native Country. I wish'd to tell
you so yesterday, but the joy your letter gave would not suffer my
hand to be steady enough to write...Many has been the
disappointments I have borne with fortitude, but the fear of having
my last and only friend torn from me was very near overseting my
reason...Madame Ely and Mrs. Bonfoy are here. Mrs. Holroyd has
probably told you that Miss Gould is now Mrs. Horneck. I wish she
had been Mrs. Gibbon...</blockquote>

<p>so the old lady rambles on, and for a moment we see him as in a
cracked mirror held in a trembling hand. For a moment, a cloud
crosses that august countenance. It was true. He had sometimes on
returning home in the evening, sighed for a companion. He had
sometimes felt that "domestic solitude...is a comfortless state."
He had conceived the romantic idea of adopting and educating a
young female relative called Charlotte. But there were
difficulties; the idea was abandoned. Then the cloud drifts away;
common sense, indomitable cheerfulness return; once more the serene
figure of the historian emerges triumphant. He had every reason to
be content. The great building was complete; the mountain was off
his breast; the slave was freed from the toil of the oar.</p>

<p>And he was by no means exhausted. Other tasks less laborious,
perhaps more delightful, lay before him. His love of literature was
unsated; his love of life&mdash;of the young, of the innocent, of
the gay&mdash;was unblunted. It was the faithful companion, the
body, unfortunately, that failed him. But his composure was
unshaken. He faced death with an equanimity that speaks well for
"the profane virtues of sincerity and moderation." And as he sank
into a sleep that was probably eternal, he could remember with
satisfaction the view across the plain to the stupendous mountains
beyond; the white acacia that grew beside the study window, and the
great work which, he was not wrong in thinking, will immortalize
his name.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>17. REFLECTIONS AT SHEFFIELD
PLACE</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in May 1937.)</p>

<p>The great ponds at Sheffield Place at the right season of the
year are bordered with red, white and purple reflections, for
rhododendrons are massed upon the banks and when the wind passes
over the real flowers the water flowers shake and break into each
other. But there, in an opening among the trees stands a great
fantastic house, and since it was there that John Holroyd, Lord
Sheffield, lived, since it was there that Gibbon stayed, another
reflection imposes itself upon the water trance. Did the historian
himself ever pause here to cast a phrase, and if so what words
would he have found for those same floating flowers? Great lord of
language as he was, no doubt he filled his mind from the fountain
of natural beauty. The exactions of the <i>Decline and Fall</i>
meant, of course, the death and dismissal of many words deserving
of immortal life. Order and seemliness were drastically imposed. It
was a question, he reflected, "whether some flowers of fancy, some
grateful errors, have not been eradicated with the weeds of
prejudice." Still his mind was a whispering gallery of words; the
famous "barefooted friars" singing vespers may have been a
recollection of Marlowe's "And ducke as low as any bare-foot
Fryar," murmuring in the background. Be this as it may, to consider
what Gibbon would have said had he seen the rhododendrons reflected
in the water is an idle exercise, for in his day, late in the
eighteenth century, a girl who looked out of the window of
Sheffield Place saw not rhododendrons "but four young swans...now
entirely grey" floating upon the water. Moreover, it is unlikely
that he ever bestirred himself to walk in the grounds. "Gib," that
same girl, Maria Josepha Holroyd, remarked, "is a mortal enemy to
any person taking a walk, and he is so frigid that he makes us sit
by a good roasting Christmas fire every evening." There he sat in
the summer evening talking endlessly, delightfully, in the best of
spirits, for no place was more like home to him than Sheffield
Place, and he looked upon the Holroyds as his own flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>Seen through Maria's eyes Gibbon&mdash;she called him sometimes
"Gib," sometimes "le grand Gibbon," sometimes "The
Historian"&mdash;looked different from Gibbon seen by himself. In
1792 she was a girl of twenty-one; he was a man of fifty-five. To
him she was "the tall and blooming Maria"; "the soft and stately
Maria," a niece by adoption, whose manners he could correct; whose
future he could forecast&mdash;"That establishment must be
splendid; that life must be happy"; whose style, especially one
metaphor about the Rhine escaping its banks, he could approve. But
to her he was often an object of ridicule; he was so fat; such a
figure of fun "waddling across the room whenever she [Madame da
Silva] appeared, and sitting by her and looking at her, till his
round eyes run down with water"; rather testy too, an old bachelor,
who lived like clockwork and hated to have his plans upset; but at
the same time, she had to admit, the most delightful of talkers.
That summer night he drew out the two young men who were staying in
the house, Fred North and Mr. Douglas, and made them far more
entertaining than they would have been without him. "It was
impossible to have selected three Beaux who could have been more
agreeable, whether their conversation was trifling or serious,"
whether they talked about Greek and Latin or turtle soup. For that
summer Mr. Gibbon was "raving" about turtles and wanted Lord
Sheffield to have one brought from London. Maria's gaze rested upon
him with a mixture of amusement and respect; but it did not rest
upon him alone. For not only were Fred North and Mr. Douglas in the
room, and the swans on the pond outside and the woods; but soldiers
were tramping past the Park gates; the Prince himself was holding a
review; they were going over to inspect the camp; Mr. Gibbon and
Aunt Serena in the post chaise; she, if only her father would let
her, on horseback. But the sight of her father suggested other
cares; he was wildly hospitable; he had asked the Prince and the
Duke to stay; and as her mother was dead, all the catering, all the
entertaining fell upon her. There was too something in her father's
face that made her look at Mr. Gibbon as if for support; he was the
only man who could influence her father; who could bring him to
reason; who could check his extravagance, restrain...But here she
paused, for there was some weakness in her father's character that
could not be put into plain language by a daughter. At any rate she
was very glad when he married a second time "for I feel delighted
to think when sooner or later troubles come, as we who know the
gentleman must fear..." Whatever frailty of her father's she hinted
at, Mr. Gibbon was the only one of his friends whose good sense
could restrain him.</p>

<p>The relation between the Peer and the Historian was very
singular. They were devoted. But what tie was it that attached the
downright, self-confident, perhaps loose-living man of the world to
the suave, erudite sedentary historian?&mdash;the attraction of
opposites perhaps. Sheffield, with his finger in every pie, his
outright, downright man of-the-world's good sense, supplied the
historian with what he must sometimes have needed&mdash;someone to
call him "you damned beast," someone to give him a solid footing on
English earth. In Parliament Gibbon was dumb; in love he was
ineffective. But his friend Holroyd was a member of a dozen
committees; before one wife was two years in the grave he had
married another. If it is true that friends are chosen partly in
order to live lives that we cannot live in our own persons, then we
can understand why the Peer and the Historian were devoted; why the
great writer divested himself of his purple language and wrote racy
colloquial English to Sheffield; why Sheffield curbed his
extravagance and restrained his passions in deference to Gibbon;
why Gibbon crossed Europe, in a post chaise to console Sheffield
for his wife's death; and why Sheffield, though always busied with
a thousand affairs of his own, yet found time to manage Gibbon's
tangled money matters; and was now indeed engaged in arranging the
business of Aunt Hester's legacy.</p>

<p>Considering Hester Gibbon's low opinion of her nephew and her
own convictions it was surprising that she had left him any thing
at all. To her Gibbon stood for all those lusts of the flesh, all
those vanities of the intellect which many years previously she had
renounced. Many years ago, many years before the summer night when
they sat round the fire in the Library and discussed Latin and
Greek and turtle soup, Hester Gibbon had put all such vanities
behind her. She had left Putney and the paternal house to follow
her brother's tutor William Law to his home in Northamptonshire.
There in the village of King's Cliffe she lived with him trying to
understand his mystic philosophy, more successfully putting it into
practice; teaching the ignorant; living frugally; feeding beggars,
spending her substance on charity. There at last, for she made no
haste to join the Saints as her nephew observed, at the age of
eighty-six she lay by Law's side in his grave; while Mrs.
Hutcheson, who had shared his house but not his love, lay in an
inferior position at their feet. Every difference that could divide
two human beings seems to have divided the aunt from the nephew;
and yet they had something in common. The suburban world of Putney
had called her mad because she believed too much; the learned world
of divinity had called him wicked because he believed too little.
Both aunt and nephew found it impossible to hit off the exact
degree of scepticism and belief which the world holds reasonable.
And this very difference perhaps had not been without its effect
upon the nephew. When he was a young man practising the graces
which were to conciliate the world he adored, his eccentric aunt
had roused his ridicule. "Her dress and figure exceed anything we
had at the masquerade; her language and ideas belong to the last
century," he wrote. In fact, though his urbanity never deserted him
in writing to her&mdash;he was her heir-at-law we are
reminded&mdash;his comments to others upon the Saint, the Holy
Matron of Northamptonshire, as he called her, were of an acutely
ironical kind; nor did he fail to note maliciously those little
frailties&mdash;her anger when Mrs. Hutcheson forgot her in her
will; her reprehensible desire to borrow from a nephew whom she
refused to meet&mdash;which were to him so marked a feature of the
saintly temper, so frequent an accompaniment of a mind clouded by
enthusiasm. As Maria Holroyd observed, and others have observed
after her, the great historian had a round mouth but an extremely
pointed tongue; and&mdash;who knows?&mdash;it may have been Aunt
Hester herself who first sharpened that weapon. Edward's father,
for instance, may have talked about William Law, his tutor&mdash;an
admirable man of course; far too great a man, to have been the
tutor of a scatter-brained spendthrift like himself; still William
Law had made himself very comfortable at the Gibbon's house in
Putney, had filled it with his own friends; had allowed Hester to
fall passionately in love with him, but had never married her,
since marriage was against his creed&mdash;had only accepted her
devotion and her income, conduct which in another might have been
condemned&mdash;so he may have gossiped. From very early days at
any rate Edward must have had a private view of the eccentricities
of the unworldly, of the inconsistencies of the devout. At last,
however, Aunt Hester, as her nephew irreverently remarked, had
"gone to sing Hallelujahs." She lay with William Law in the grave,
after a life of what ecstasies, of what tortures, of what
jealousies, of what safisfactions who can say? The only fact that
was certain was that she had left one hundred pounds and an estate
at Newhaven to her "poor though unbelieving nephew." "She might
have done better, she might have done worse," he observed. And by
an odd coincidence her land lay not far from the Holroyd property;
Lord Sheffield was eager to buy it. He could easily pay for it, he
was sure, by cutting down some of the timber.</p>

<p>If then we accept Aunt Hester's view, Gibbon was a worldling,
wallowing in the vanities of the flesh, scoffing at the holiness of
the faith. But his other aunt, his mother's sister, took a very
different view of him. To his Aunt Kitty he had been ever since he
was a babe a source of acute anxiety&mdash;he was so weakly; and of
intense pride&mdash;he was such a prodigy. His mother was one of
those flyaway women who make great use of their unmarried sisters,
since they are frequently in childbed themselves and have an
appetite for pleasure when they can escape the cares of the
nursery. She died, moreover, in her prime; and Kitty of course took
charge of the only survivor of all those cradles, nursed him,
petted him, and was the first to inspire him with that love of
pagan literature which was to bring the glitter of minarets and the
flash of eastern pageantry so splendidly into his sometimes too
pale and pompous prose. It was Aunt Kitty who, with a prodigality
that would have scandalized Aunt Hester, flung open the door of
that enchanted world&mdash;the world of <i>The Cavern of the
Winds</i>, of the <i>Palace of Felicity</i>, of Pope's
<i>Homer</i>, and of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> in which Edward was
to roam for ever. "Where a title attracted my eye, without fear or
awe I snatched the volume from the shelf; and Mrs. Porten, who
indulged herself in moral and religious speculations, was more
prone to encourage. than to check a curiosity above the strength of
a boy." And it was she who first loosened his lips. "Her indulgent
tenderness, the frankness of her temper, and my innate rising
curiosity, soon removed all distance between us; like friends of an
equal age, we freely conversed on every topic, familiar or
abstruse." It was she who began the conversation which was still
continuing in front of the fire in the library that summer
night.</p>

<p>What would have happened if the child had fallen into the hands
of his other aunt and her companion? Should we have had the
<i>Decline and Fall</i> if they had controlled his reading and
checked his curiosity, as William Law checked all reading and
condemned all curiosity? It is an interesting question. But the
effect on the man of his two incompatible aunts developed a
conflict in his nature. Aunt Hester, from whom he expected a
fortune, encouraged, it would seem from his letters, a streak of
hypocrisy, a vein of smooth and calculating conventionality. He
sneered to Sheffield at her religion; when she died he hailed her
departure with a flippant joke. Aunt Kitty on the other hand
brought out a strain of piety, of filial devotion. When she died he
wrote, as if it were she and not the Saint who made him think
kindly for a moment of Christianity, "The immortality of the soul
is on some occasions a very comfortable doctrine." And it was she
certainly who made him bethink him when she was asked to stay at
Sheffield Place, that "Aunt Kitty has a secret wish to lye in my
room; if it is not occupied, it might be indulged." So while Aunt
Hester lay with William Law in the grave, Aunt Kitty hoisted
herself into the great four-poster with the help of the stool which
the little man always used, and lay there, seeing the very
cupboards and chairs that her nephew saw when he slept there, and
the pond perhaps and the trees out of the window. The great
historian, whose gaze swept far horizons and surveyed the
processions of the Roman Emperors, could also fix them minutely
upon a rather tedious old lady and guess her fancy to sleep in a
certain bed. He was a strange mixture.</p>

<p>Very strange, Maria may have thought as she sat there listening
to his talk while she stitched: selfish yet tender; ridiculous but
sublime. Perhaps human nature was like that&mdash;by no means all
of a piece; different at different moments; changing, as the
furniture changed in the firelight, as the waters of the lake
changed when the night wind swept over them. But it was time for
bed; the party broke up. Mr. Gibbon, she noted with concern, for
she was genuinely fond of him, had some difficulty in climbing the
stairs. He was unwell; a slight operation for an old complaint was
necessary, and he left them with regret to go to town. The
operation was over; the news was good; they hoped that he would
soon be with them again. Then suddenly between five and six of a
January evening an express arrived at Sheffield Place to say that
he was dangerously ill. Lord Sheffield and his sister Serena
started immediately for London. It was fine, luckily, and the moon
was up. "The night was light as day," Serena wrote to Maria. "The
beauty of it was solemn and almost melancholy with our train of
ideas, but it seemed to calm our minds." They reached Gibbon's
lodging at midnight and "poor Dussot came to the door the picture
of despair to tell me <i>he</i> was no more..." He had died that
morning; he was already laid in the shell of his coffin. A few days
later they brought him back to Sheffield Place; carried him through
the Park, past the ponds, and laid him under a crimson cloth among
the Holroyds in the Mausoleum.</p>

<p>As for the "soft and stately Maria" she survived to the year
1863; and her granddaughter Kate, the mother of Bertrand Russell,
marvelled that an old woman of that age should mind dying&mdash;an
old woman who had lived through the French Revolution, who had
entertained Gibbon at Sheffield Place.</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>18. THE MAN AT THE GATE</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in September 1940.)</p>

<p>The man was Coleridge as De Quincey saw him, standing in a
gateway. For it is vain to put the single word Coleridge at the
head of a page&mdash;Coleridge the innumerable, the mutable, the
atmospheric; Coleridge who is part of Wordsworth, Keats and
Shelley; of his age and of our own; Coleridge whose written words
fill hundreds of pages and overflow innumerable margins; whose
spoken words still reverberate, so that as we enter his radius he
seems not a man, but a swarm, a cloud, a buzz of words, darting
this way and that, clustering, quivering and hanging suspended. So
little of this can be caught in any reader's net that it is well
before we become dazed in the labyrinth of what we call Coleridge
to have a clear picture before us&mdash;the picture of a man
standing at a gate:</p>

<blockquote>...his person was broad and full, and tended even to
corpulence, his complexion was fair...his eyes were large and soft
in their expression; and it was from the peculiar appearance of
haze or dreaminess which mixed with their light, that I recognized
my object.</blockquote>

<p>That was in 1807. Coleridge was already incapable of movement.
The Kendal black drop had robbed him of his will. "You bid me rouse
myself&mdash;go, bid a man paralytic in both arms rub them briskly
together." The arms already hung flabby at his side; he was
powerless to raise them. But the disease which paralysed his will
left his mind unfettered. In proportion as he became incapable of
action, he became capable of feeling. As he stood at the gate his
vast expanse of being was a passive target for innumerable arrows,
all of them sharp, many of them poisoned. To confess, to analyse,
to describe was the only alleviation of his appalling
torture&mdash;the prisoner's only means of escape.</p>

<p>Thus there shapes itself in the volumes of Coleridge's letters
an immense mass of quivering matter, as if the swarm had attached
itself to a bough and hung there pendent. Sentences roll like drops
down a pane, drop collecting drop, but when they reach the bottom,
the pane is smeared. A great novelist, Dickens for preference,
could have formed out of this swarm and diffusion a prodigious, an
immortal character. Dickens, could he have been induced to listen,
would have noted&mdash;perhaps this:</p>

<blockquote>Deeply wounded by very disrespectful words used
concerning me, and which struggling as I have been thro' life, and
still maintaining a character and holding connections no way
unworthy of my Family</blockquote>

<p>Or again:</p>

<blockquote>The worst part of the charges were that I had been
imprudent enough and in the second place gross and indelicate
enough to send out a gentleman's servant in his own house to a
public house for a bottle of brandy...</blockquote>

<p>Or again:</p>

<blockquote>What joy would it not be to you or to me, Miss Betham!
to meet a Milton in a future state</blockquote>

<p>And again, on accepting a loan:</p>

<blockquote>I can barely collect myself sufficiently to convey to
you&mdash;first, that I receive this proof of your filial kindness
with feelings not unworthy of the same...but that, whenever (if
ever) my circumstances shall improve, you must permit me to remind
you that what was, and <i>forever</i> under <i>all</i> conditions
of fortune will be, <i>felt</i> as a <i>gift</i>, has become a
Loan&mdash;and lastly, that you must let me have you as a frequent
friend on whose visits I may rely as often as convenience will
permit you...</blockquote>

<p>The very voice (drastically cut short) of Micawber himself!</p>

<p>But there is a difference. For this Micawber knows that he is
Micawber. He holds a looking-glass in his hand. He is a man of
exaggerated self-consciousness, endowed with an astonishing power
of self-analysis. Dickens would need to be doubled with Henry
James, to be trebled with Proust, in order to convey the complexity
and the conflict of a Pecksniff who despises his own hypocrisy, of
a Micawber who is humiliated by his own humiliation. He is so made
that he can hear the crepitation of a leaf, and yet remains obtuse
to the claims of wife and child. An unopened letter brings great
drops of sweat to his forehead; yet to lift a pen and answer it is
beyond his power. The Dickens Coleridge and the Henry James
Coleridge perpetually tear him asunder. The one sends out
surreptitiously to Mr. Dunn the chemist for another bottle of
opium; and the other analyses the motives that have led to this
hypocrisy into an infinity of fine shreds.</p>

<p>Thus often in reading the "gallop scrawl" of the letters from
Highgate in 1820 we seem to be reading notes for a late work by
Henry James. He is the forerunner of all who have tried to reveal
the intricacies, to take the faintest creases of the human soul.
The great sentences pocketed with parentheses, expanded with dash
after dash, break their walls under the strain of including and
qualifying and suggesting all that Coleridge feels, fears and
glimpses. Often he is prolix to the verge of incoherence, and his
meaning dwindles and fades to a wisp on the mind's horizon. Yet in
our tongue-tied age there is a joy in this reckless abandonment to
the glory of words. Cajoled, caressed, tossed up in handfuls, words
yield those flashing phrases that hang like ripe fruit in the
many-leaved tree of his immense volubility. "Brow-hanging,
shoe-contemplative, <i>strange</i>"; there is Hazlitt. Of Dr.
Darwin: "He was like a pigeon picking up peas, and afterwards
voiding them with excremental additions." Anything may tumble out
of that great maw; the subtlest criticism, the wildest jest, the
exact condition of his intestines. But he uses words most often to
express the crepitations of his apprehensive susceptibility. They
serve as a smoke-screen between him and the menace of the real
world. The word screen trembles and shivers. What enemy is
approaching? Nothing visible to the naked eye. And yet how he
trembles and quivers! Hartley, "poor Hartley...in shrinking from
the momentary pain of telling the plain truth, a truth not
discreditable to him or to me, has several times inflicted an
agitating pain and confusion"&mdash;by what breach of morality or
dereliction of duty?&mdash;"by bringing up Mr. Bourton unexpectedly
on Sundays with the intention of dining here." Is that all? Ah, but
a diseased body feels the stab of anguish if only a corn is trod
upon. Anguish shoots through every fibre of his being. Has he not
himself often shrunk from the momentary pain of telling the plain
truth? Why has he no home to offer his son, no table to which
Hartley could bring his friends uninvited? Why does he live a
stranger in the house of friends, and be (at present) unable to
discharge his share of the housekeeping expenses? The old train of
bitter thoughts is set in motion once more. He is one hum and
vibration of painful emotion. And then, giving it all the slip, he
takes refuge in thought and provides Hartley with "in short, the
sum of all my reading and reflections on the vast Wheel of the
Mythology of the earliest and purest Heathenism." Hartley must feed
upon that and take a snack of cold meat and pickles at some
inn.</p>

<p>Letter-writing was in its way a substitute for opium. In his
letters he could persuade others to believe what he did not
altogether believe himself&mdash;that he had actually written the
folios, the quartos, the octavos that he had planned. Letters also
relieved him of those perpetually pullulating ideas which, like
Surinam toads, as he said, were always giving birth to little toads
that "grow quickly and draw off attention from the mother toad." In
letters thoughts need not be brought to a conclusion. Somebody was
always interrupting, and then he could throw down his pen and
indulge in what was, after all, better than writing&mdash;the
"insemination" of ideas without the intermediary of any gross
impediment by word of mouth into the receptive, the acquiescent,
the entirely passive ear, say, of Mr. Green who arrived punctually
at three. Later, if it were Thursday, in came politicians,
economists, musicians, business men, fine ladies, children&mdash;it
mattered not who they were so long as he could talk and they would
listen.</p>

<p>Two pious American editors have collected the comments of this
various company,* and they are, of course, various. Yet it is the
only way of getting at the truth&mdash;to have it broken into many
splinters by many mirrors and so select.</p>

<p>[* <i>Coleridge the Talker</i>, edited by Richard W. Armour and
Raymond F. Howes] The truth about Coleridge the talker seems to
have been that he rapt some listeners to the seventh heaven; bored
others to extinction; and made one foolish girl giggle
irrepressibly. In the same way his eyes were brown to some, grey to
others, and again a very bright blue. But there is one point upon
which all who listened are agreed; not one of them could remember a
single word he said. All, however, with astonishing unanimity are
agreed that it was "like"&mdash;the waves of the ocean, the flowing
of a mighty river, the splendour of the Aurora Borealis, the
radiance of the Milky Way. Almost all are equally agreed that
waves, river, Borealis, and Milky Way lacked, as Lady Jerningham
tersely put it, "behind." From their accounts it is clear that he
avoided contradiction; detested personality; cared nothing who you
were; only needed some sound of breathing or rustle of skirts to
stir his flocks of dreaming thoughts into motion and light the
glitter and magic that lay sunk in the torpid flesh. Was it the
mixture of body and mind in his talk that gave off some hypnotic
fume that lulled the audience into drowsiness? He acted as he
talked; now, if he felt the interest flag, pointing to a picture,
or caressing a child, and then, as the time to make an exit
approached, majestically possessed himself of a bedroom candlestick
and, still discoursing, disappeared. Thus played upon by gesture
and voice, brow and glittering eye, no one, as Crabb Robinson
remarks, could take a note. It is then in his letters, where the
body of the actor was suppressed, that we have the best record of
the siren's song. There we hear the voice that began talking at the
age of two&mdash;"Nasty Doctor Young" are his first recorded words;
and went on in barracks, on board ship, in pulpits, in stage
coaches&mdash;it mattered not where he found himself or with whom,
Keats it might be or the baker's boy&mdash;on he went, on and on,
talking about nightingales, dreams, the will, the volition, the
reason, the understanding, monsters, and mermaids, until a little
girl, overcome by the magic of the incantation, burst into tears
when the voice ceased and left her alone in a silent world.</p>

<p>We too, when the voice stops only half an hour before he passed
that July day in 1834 into silence, feel bereft. Is it for hours or
for years that this heavily built man standing in a gate has been
pouring forth this passionate soliloquy, while his "large soft eyes
with a peculiar expression of haze or dreaminess mixed in their
light" have been fixed upon a far-away vision that filled a very
few pages with poems in which every word is exact and every image
as clear as crystal?</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>19. SARA COLERIDGE</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in September 1940.)</p>

<p>Coleridge also left children of his body. One, his daughter,
Sara, was a continuation of him, not of his flesh inded, for she
was minute, aetherial, but of his mind, his temperament. The whole
of her forty-eight years were lived in the light of his sunset, so
that, like other children of great men, she is a chequered dappled
figure flitting between a vanished radiance and the light of every
day. And, like so many of her father's works, Sara Coleridge
remains unfinished. Mr. Griggs has written her life, exhaustively,
sympathetically; but still...dots intervene.*</p>

<p>[* <i>Coleridge Fille: a Biography of Sara Coleridge</i>, By
Earl Leslie Griggs.] That extremely interesting fragment, her
autobiography, ends with three rows of dots after twenty-six pages.
She intended, she says, to end every section with a moral, or a
reflection. And then "on reviewing my earlier childhood I find the
predominant reflection..." There she stops. But she said many
things in those twenty-six pages, and Mr. Griggs has added others
that tempt us to fill in the dots, though not with the facts that
she might have given us.</p>

<p>"Send me the very feel of her sweet Flesh, the very look and
motion of that mouth&mdash;O, I could drive myself mad about her,"
Coleridge wrote when she was a baby. She was a lovely child,
delicate, large-eyed, musing but active, very still but always in
motion, like one of her father's poems. She remembered how he took
her as a child to stay with the Wordsworths at Allan Bank.</p>

<p>The rough farmhouse life was distasteful to her, and to her
shame they bathed her in a room where men came in and out.
Delicately dressed in lace and muslin, for her father liked white
for girls, she was a contrast to Dora, with her wild eyes and
floating yellow hair and frock of deep Prussian blue or
purple&mdash;for Wordsworth liked clothes to be coloured. The visit
was full of such contrasts and conflicts. Her father cherished her
and petted her. "I slept with him and he would tell me fairy
stories when he came to bed at twelve or one o'clock..." Then her
mother, Mrs. Coleridge, arrived, and Sara flew to that honest,
homely, motherly woman and "wished never to be separated from her."
At that&mdash;the memory was still bitter&mdash;"my father showed
displeasure and accused me of want of affection. I could not
understand why...I think my father's motive," she reflected later,
"must have been a wish to fasten my affections on him...I slunk
away and hid myself in the wood behind the house."</p>

<p>But it was her father who, when she lay awake terrified by a
horse with eyes of flame, gave her a candle. He, too, had been
afraid of the dark. With his candle beside her, she lost her fear,
and lay awake, listening to the sound of the river, to the thud of
the forge hammer, and to the cries of stray animals in the fields.
The sounds haunted her all her life. No country, no garden, no
house ever compared with the Fells and the horse-shoe lawn and the
room with three windows looking over the lake to the mountains. She
sat there while her father, Wordsworth and De Quincey paced up and
down talking. What they said she could not understand, but she
"used to note the handkerchief hanging out of the pocket and long
to clutch it." When she was a child the handkerchief vanished and
her father with it. After that, "I never lived with him for more
than a few weeks at a time," she wrote. A room at Greta Hall was
always kept ready for him but he never came. Then the brothers,
Hartley and Derwent, vanished, too; and Mrs. Coleridge and Sara
stayed on with Uncle Southey, feeling their dependence and
resenting it. "A house of bondage Greta Hall was to her," Hartley
wrote. Yet there was Uncle Southey's library; and thanks to that
admirable, erudite and indefatigable man, Sara became mistress of
six languages, translated Dobritzhoffer from the Latin, to help pay
for Hartley's education, and qualified herself, should the worst
come, to earn her living. "Should it be necessary," Wordsworth
wrote, "she will be well fitted to become a governess in a
nobleman's or gentleman's family...She is remarkably clever."</p>

<p>But it was her beauty that took her father by surprise when at
last at the age of twenty she visited him at Highgate. She was
learned he knew, and he was proud of it; but he was unprepared, Mr.
Griggs says, "for the dazzling vision of loveliness which stepped
across the threshold one cold December day." People rose in a
public hall when she came in. "I have seen Miss Coleridge," Lamb
wrote, "and I wish I had just such a&mdash;daughter." Did Coleridge
wish to keep such a daughter? Was a father's jealousy roused in
that will-less man of inordinate susceptibility when Sara met her
cousin Henry up at Highgate and almost instantly, but secretly,
gave him her coral necklace in exchange for a ring with his hair?
What right had a father who could not offer his daughter even a
room to be told of the engagement or to object to it? He could only
quiver with innumerable conflicting sensations at the thought that
his nephew, whose book on the West Indies had impressed him
unfavourably, was taking from him the daughter who, like
Christabel, was his masterpiece, but, like Christabel, was
unfinished. All he could do was to cast his magic spell. He talked.
For the first time since she was a woman, Sara heard him talk. She
could not remember a word of it afterwards. And she was penitent.
It was partly that</p>

<blockquote>my father generally discoursed on such a very extensive
scale...Henry could sometimes bring him down to narrower topics,
but when alone with me he was almost always on the star-paved road,
taking in the whole heavens in his circuit.</blockquote>

<p>She was a heaven-haunter, too; but at the moment "I was anxious
about my brothers and their prospects&mdash;about Henry's health,
and upon the subject of my engagement generally." Her father
ignored such things. Sara's mind wandered.</p>

<p>The young couple, however, made ample amends for that momentary
inattention. They listened to his voice for the rest of their
lives. At the christening of their first child Coleridge talked for
six hours without stopping. Hard-worked as Henry was, and delicate,
sociable and pleasure-loving, the spell of Uncle Sam was on him,
and so long as he lived he helped his wife. He annotated, he
edited, he set down what he could remember of the wonderful voice.
But the main labour fell on Sara. She made herself, she said, the
housekeeper in that littered palace. She followed his reading;
verified his quotations; defended his character; traced notes on
innumerable margins; ransacked bundles; pieced beginnings together
and supplied them not with ends but with continuations. A whole
day's work would result in one erasure. Cab fares to newspaper
offices mounted; eyes, for she could not afford a secretary, felt
the strain; but so long as a page remained obscure, a date
doubtful, a reference unverified, an aspersion not disproved,
"poor, dear, indefatigable Sara," as Mrs. Wordsworth called her,
worked on. And much of her work was done lastingly; editors still
stand on the foundations she truly laid.</p>

<p>Much of it was not self-sacrifice, but self-realization. She
found her father, in those blurred pages, as she had not found him
in the flesh; and she found that he was herself. She did not copy
him, she insisted; she was him. Often she continued his thoughts as
if they had been her own. Did she not even shuffle a little in her
walk, as he did, from side to side? Yet though she spent half her
time in reflecting that vanished radiance, the other half was spent
in the light of common day&mdash;at Chester Place, Regents Park.
Children were born and children died. Her health broke down; she
had her father's legacy of harassed nerves; and, like her farther,
had need of opium. Pathetically she wished that she could be given
"three years' respite from child bearing." But she wished in vain.
Then Henry, whose gaiety had so often dragged her from the dark
abyss, died young; leaving his notes unfinished, and two children
also, and very little money, and many apartments in Uncle Sam's
great house still unswept.</p>

<p>She worked on. In her desolation it was her solace, her opium
perhaps. "Things of the mind and intellect give me intense
pleasure; they delight and amuse me as they are in themselves...and
sometimes I think, the result has been too large, the harvest too
abundant, in inward satisfaction. This is dangerous..." Thoughts
proliferated. Like her father she had a Surinam toad in her head,
breeding other toads. But his were jewelled; hers were plain. She
was diffuse, unable to conclude, and without the magic that does
instead of a conclusion. She would have liked, had she been able to
make an end, to have written&mdash;on metaphysics, on theology,
some book of criticism. Or again, politics interested her
intensely, and Turner's pictures. But "whatever subject I commence,
I feel discomfort unless I could pursue it in every direction to
the farthest bounds of thought...This was the reason why my father
wrote by snatches. He could not bear to complete incompletely." So,
book in hand, pen suspended, large eyes filled with a dreamy haze,
she mused&mdash;"picking flowers, and finding nests, and exploring
some particular nook, as I used to be when a child walking with my
Uncle Southey..."</p>

<p>Then her children interrupted. With her son, the brilliant
Herbert, she read, straight through the classics. Were there not,
Mr. Justice Coleridge objected, passages in Aristophanes that they
had better skip? Perhaps...Still, Herbert took all the prizes, won
all the scholarships, almost drove her to distraction with his
horn-playing and, like his father, loved parties. Sara went to
balls, and watched him dance waltz after waltz. She had the old
lovely clothes that Henry had given her altered for her daughter,
Edith. She found herself eating supper twice, she was so bored. She
preferred dinner parties where she held her own with Macaulay, who
was so like her father in the face, and with Carlyle&mdash;"A
precious Arch-charlatan," she called him. The young poets, like
Aubrey de Vere, sought her out. She was one of those, he said,
"whose thoughts are growing while they speak." After he had gone,
her thoughts followed him, in long, long letters, rambling over
baptism, regenerations, metaphysics, theology, and poetry, past,
present and to come. As a critic she never, like her father, grazed
paths of light; she was a fertilizer, not a creator, a burrowing,
tunnelling reader, throwing up molehills as she read her way
through Dante, Virgil, Aristophanes, Crashaw, Jane Austen, Crabbe,
to emerge suddenly, unafraid, in the very face of Keats and
Shelley. "Fain would mine eyes," she wrote, "discern the Future in
the past."</p>

<p>Past, present, future dappled her with a strange light. She was
mixed in herself, still divided, as in the wood behind the house,
between two loyalties, to the father who told her fairy stories in
bed; and to the mother&mdash;Frettikins she called her&mdash;to
whom she clung in the flesh. "Dear mother," she exclaimed, "what an
honest, simple, lively minded affectionate woman she was, how free
from disguise or artifice..." Why, even her wig&mdash;she had cut
her hair off as a girl&mdash;" was as dry and rough and dull as a
piece of stubble, and as short and stumpy." The wig and the
brow&mdash;she understood them both. Could she have skipped the
moral she could have told us much about that strange marriage. She
meant to write her life. But she was interrupted. There was a lump
on her breast. Mr. Gilman, consulted, detected cancer. She did not
want to die. She had not finished editing her father's works, she
had not written her own, for she did not like to complete
incompletely. But she died at forty-eight, leaving, like her
father, a blank page covered with dots, and two lines:</p>

<blockquote>Father, no amaranths e'er shall wreathe my
brow&mdash;<br>
Enough that round thy grave they flourish now.</blockquote>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>20. "NOT ONE OF US"</h2>

<p class="cpb">(A review of <i>Shelley; His Lift and Work</i>, by
Walter Edwin Peck, October 1927.)</p>

<p>Professor Peck does not apologize for writing a new life of
Shelley, nor does he give any reason for doing what has been so
thoroughly done already, nor are the new documents that have come
into his hands of any great importance. And yet nobody is going to
complain that here are two more thick, illustrated, careful and
conscientious volumes devoted to the retelling of a story which
everyone knows by heart. There are some stories which have to be
retold by each generation, not that we have anything new to add to
them, but because of some queer quality in them which makes them
not only Shelley's story but our own. Eminent and durable they
stand on the skyline, a mark past which we sail, which moves as we
move and yet remains the same.</p>

<p>Many such changes of orientation toward Shelley have been
recorded. In his own lifetime all except five people looked upon
him, Shelley said, "as a rare prodigy of crime and pollution, whose
look even might infect." Sixty years later he was canonized by
Edward Dowden. By Matthew Arnold he was again reduced to the
ordinary human scale. How many biographers and essayists have since
absolved him or sentenced him, it is impossible to say. And now
comes our turn to make up our minds what manner of man Shelley was;
so that we read Professor Peck's volumes, not to find out new
facts, but to get Shelley more sharply outlined against the
shifting image of ourselves.</p>

<p>If such is our purpose, never was there a biographer who gave
his readers more opportunity to fulfil it than Professor Peck. He
is singularly dispassionate, and yet not colourless. He has
opinions, but he does not obtrude them. His attitude to Shelley is
kind but not condescending. He does not rhapsodize, but at the same
time he does not scold. There are only two points which he seems to
plead with any personal partiality; one, that Harriet was a much
wronged woman; the other, that the political importance of
Shelley's poetry is not rated sufficiently high. Perhaps we could
spare the careful analysis of so many poems. We scarcely need to
know how many times mountains and precipices are mentioned in the
course of Shelley's works. But as a chronicler of great learning
and lucidity, Professor Peck is admirable. Here, he seems to say,
is all that is actually known about Shelley's life. In October he
did this in November he did that; now it was that he wrote this
poem it was here that he met that friend. And, moulding the
enormous mass of the Shelley papers with dexterous fingers, he
contrives tactfully to embed dates and facts in feelings, in
comments, in what Shelley wrote, in what Mary wrote, in what other
people wrote about them, so that we seem to be breasting the full
current of Shelley's life and get the illusion that we are, this
time, seeing Shelley, not through the rosy glasses or the livid
glasses which sentiment and prudery have fixed on our forerunners'
noses, but plainly, as he was. In this, of course, we are mistaken;
glasses we wear, though we cannot see them. But the illusion of
seeing Shelley plain is sufficiently exhilarating to tempt us to
try to fix it while it lasts.</p>

<p>There is an image of Shelley's personal appearance in
everybody's picture gallery. He was a lean, large-boned boy, much
freckled, with big, rather prominent blue eyes. His dress was
careless, of course, but it was distinguished; "he wore his clothes
like a gentleman." He was courteous and gentle in manner, but he
spoke in a shrill, harsh voice and soon rose to the heights of
excitement. Nobody could overlook the presence of this discordant
character in the room, and his presence was strangely disturbing.
It was not merely that he might do something extreme, he might,
somehow, make whoever was there appear absurd. From the earliest
days normal people had noticed his abnormality and had done their
best, following some obscure instinct of self-preservation, to make
Shelley either toe the line or else quit the society of the
respectable. At Eton they called him "mad Shelley" and pelted him
with muddy balls. At Oxford he spilt acid over his tutor's carpet,
"a new purchase, which he thus completely destroyed," and for other
and more serious differences of opinion he was expelled.</p>

<p>After that he became the champion of every down-trodden cause
and person. Now it was an embankment; now a publisher; now the
Irish nation; now three poor weavers condemned for treason; now a
flock of neglected sheep. Spinsters of all sorts who were oppressed
or aspiring found in him their leader. The first years of his youth
thus were spent in dropping seditious pamphlets into old women's
hoods; in shooting scabby sheep to put them out of their misery; in
raising money; in writing pamphlets; in rowing out to sea and
dropping bottles into the water which when broken open by the Town
Clerk of Barnstable were found to contain a seditious paper, "the
contents of which the mayor has not yet been able to ascertain." In
all these wanderings and peregrinations he was accompanied by a
woman, or perhaps by two women, who either had young children at
the breast or were shortly expecting to become mothers. And one of
them, it is said, could not contain her amusement when she saw the
pamphlet dropped into the old woman's hood, but burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>The picture is familiar enough; the only thing that changes is
our attitude toward it. Shelley, excitable, uncompromising,
atheistical, throwing his pamphlets into the sea in the belief that
he is going to reform the world, has become a figure which is half
heroic and wholly delightful. On the other hand, the world that
Shelley fought has become ridiculous. Somehow the untidy,
shrill-voiced boy, with his violence and his oddity has succeeded
in making Eton and Oxford, the English government, the Town Clerk
and Mayor of Barnstable, the country gentlemen of Sussex and
innumerable obscure people whom we might call generically, after
Mary's censorious friends, the Booths and the Baxters&mdash;Shelley
has succeeded in making all these look absurd.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, though one may make bodies and institutions
look absurd, it is extremely difficult to make private men and
women look anything so simple. Human relationships are too complex;
human nature is too subtle. Thus contact with Shelley turned
Harriet Westbrook, who should have been the happy mother of a
commonplace family, into a muddled and bewildered woman, who wanted
both to reform the world and yet to possess a coach and bonnets,
and was finally drawn from the Serpentine on a winter's morning,
drowned in her despair. And Mary and Miss Hitchener, and Godwin and
Claire, and Hogg and Emilia Viviani, and Sophia Stacey and Jane
Williams&mdash;there is nothing tragic about them, perhaps; there
is, indeed, much that is ridiculous. Still, their association with
Shelley does not lead to any clear and triumphant conclusion. Was
he right? Were they right? The whole relationship is muddy and
obscure; it baffles; it teases.</p>

<p>One is reminded of the private life of another man whose power
of conviction was even greater than Shelley's, and more destructive
of normal human happiness. One remembers Tolstoy and his wife. The
alliance of the intense belief of genius with the easy-going
non-belief or compromise of ordinary humanity must, it seems, lead
to disaster and to disaster of a lingering and petty kind in which
the worst side of both natures is revealed. But while Tolstoy might
have wrought out his philosophy alone or in a monastery, Shelley
was driven by something yielding and enthusiastic in his
temperament to entangle himself with men and women. "I think one is
always in love with something or other," he wrote. But this
"something or other" besides lodging in poetry and metaphysics and
the good of society in general, had its dwelling in the bodies of
human beings of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>He saw "the likeness of what is perhaps eternal" in the eyes of
Mary. Then it vanished, to appear in the eyes of Emilia; then there
it was again manifesting itself indisputably in Sophia Stacey or in
Jane Williams. What is the lover to do when the will o' the wisp
shifts its quarters? One must go on, said Shelley, until one is
stopped. And what is to stop one? Not, if one is Shelley, the
conventions and superstitions which bind the baser part of mankind;
not the Booths and the Baxters. Oxford might expel him, England
might exile him, but still, in spite of disaster and derision, he
sought the "likeness of what is perhaps eternal"; he went on being
in love.</p>

<p>But as the object of his love was a hybrid creature, half human,
half divine, so the manner of his love partook of the same
ambiguous nature. There was something inhuman about Shelley.
Godwin, in answer to Shelley's first letter, noticed it. He
complained of the "generalizing character" of Shelley's style,
which, he said, had the effect of making him "not an individual
character" to him. Mary Shelley, musing over her life when Shelley
was dead, exclaimed, "What a strange life mine has been. Love,
youth, fear and fearlessness led me early from the regular routine
of life and I united myself to this being who, not one of
<i>us</i>, though like us, was pursued by numberless miseries and
annoyances, in all of which I shared." Shelley was "not one of us."
He was, even to his wife, a "being," some one who came and went
like a ghost, seeking the eternal. Of the transitory, he had little
notion. The joys and sorrows, from whose threads are woven the warm
cocoon of private life in which most men live, had no hold upon
him. A strange formality stiffens his letters; there is no intimacy
in them and no fun.</p>

<p>At the same time it is perfectly true, and Professor Peck does
well to emphasize the fact, that Shelley loved humanity if he did
not love this Harriet or that Mary. A sense of the wretchedness of
human beings burnt in him as brightly and as persistently as his
sense of the divine beauty of nature. He loved the clouds and the
mountains and the rivers more passionately than any other man loved
them; but at the foot of the mountain he always saw a ruined
cottage; there were criminals in chains, hoeing up the weeds in the
pavement of St. Peter's Square; there was an old woman shaking with
ague on the banks of the lovely Thames. Then he would thrust aside
his writing, dismiss his dreams and trudge off to physic the poor
with medicine or with soup. Inevitably there collected round him,
as time went on, the oddest assortment of pensioners and protégés.
He took on himself the charge of deserted women and other people's
children; he paid other persons' debts and planned their journeys
and settled their relationships. The most ethereal of poets was the
most practical of men.</p>

<p>Hence, says Professor Peck, from this union of poetry and
humanity springs the true value of Shelley's poetry. It was the
poetry of a man who was not a "pure poet," but a poet with a
passion for reforming the wrongs of men. Had he lived, he would
have reconciled poetry and the statement of "the necessity of
certain immediate reforms in politics, society and government." He
died too young to be able to deliver his message; and the
difficulty of his poetry arises from the fact that the conflict
between poetry and politics rages there unresolved. We may not
agree with Professor Peck's definition, yet we have only to read
Shelley again to come up against the difficulty of which he speaks.
It lies partly in the disconcerting fact that we had thought his
poetry so good and we find it indeed so poor. How are we to account
for the fact that we remember him as a great poet and find him on
opening his pages a bad one? The explanation seems to be that he
was not a "pure poet." He did not concentrate his meaning in a
small space; there is nothing in Shelley's poetry as rich and
compact as the odes of Keats. His taste could be sentimental; he
had all the vices of the album makers; he was unreal, strained,
verbose. The lines which Professor Peck quotes with admiration:
"Good night? No, love! The night is ill," seems to us a proof of
it. But if we pass from the lyrics, with all their exquisite
beauty, and read ourselves into one of the longer poems,
<i>Epipsychidion</i> or <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>, where the faults
have space to lose themselves, we again become convinced of his
greatness. And here again we are confronted by a difficulty. For if
we were asked to extract the teaching from these poems we should be
at a loss. We can hardly say what reform in "politics, society and
government" they advocate. Their greatness seems to lie in nothing
so definite as a philosophy, in nothing so pure as perfection of
expression. It lies rather in a state of being. We come through
skeins of clouds and gusts of whirlwind out into a space of pure
calm, of intense and windless serenity. Defensibly or not, we make
a distinction&mdash;<i>The Skylark</i>, the <i>Ode to the West
Wind</i> are poems; the <i>Prometheus</i>, the <i>Epipsychidion</i>
are poetry.</p>

<p>So if we outline our relationship to Shelley from the vantage
ground Of 1927 we shall find that his England is a barbarous place
where they imprison journalists for being disrespectful to the
Prince Regent, stand men in stocks for publishing attacks upon the
Scriptures, execute weavers upon the suspicion of treason, and,
without giving proof of strict religious belief themselves, expel a
boy from Oxford for avowing his atheism. Politically, then,
Shelley's England has already receded, and his fight, valiant
though it is, seems to be with monsters who are a little out of
date, and therefore slightly ridiculous. But privately he is much
closer to us. For alongside the public battle wages, from
generation to generation, another fight which is as important as
the other, though much less is said about it. Husband fights with
wife and son with father. The poor fight the rich and the employer
fights the employed. There is a perpetual effort on the one hand to
make all these relationships more reasonable, less painful and less
servile; on the other, to keep them as they are. Shelley, both as
son and as husband, fought for reason and freedom in private life,
and his experiments, disastrous as they were in many ways, have
helped us to greater sincerity and happiness in our own conflicts.
The Sir Timothys of Sussex are no longer so prompt to cut their
sons off with a shilling; the Booths and the Baxters are no longer
quite so sure that an unmarried wife is an unmitigated demon. The
grasp of convention upon private life is no longer quite so coarse
or quite so callous because of Shelley's successes and
failures.</p>

<p>So we see Shelley through our particular pair of
spectacles&mdash;a shrill, charming, angular boy; a champion riding
out against the forces of superstition and brutality with heroic
courage; at the same time blind, inconsiderate, obtuse to other
persons' feelings. Rapt in his extraordinary vision, ascending to
the very heights of existence, he seems, as Mary said, "a being,"
"not one of us," but better and higher and aloof and apart.
Suddenly there comes a knock at the door; the Hunts and seven
children are at Leghorn; Lord Byron has been rude to them; Hunt is
cut to the heart. Shelley must be off at once to see that they are
comfortable. And, rousing himself from his rapture, Shelley
goes.</p>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>21. HENRY JAMES</h2>

<h3><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>1. WITHIN THE RIM</h3>

<p class="cpb">(Written in 1919.)</p>

<p>It would be easy to justify the suspicion which the sight of
<i>Within the Rim</i> aroused, and to make it account for the tepid
and formal respect with which we own to have approached the book.
Essays about the war contributed to albums and books with a
charitable object even by the most distinguished of writers bear
for the most part such traces of perfunctory composition, such
evidence of genius forcibly harnessed to the wagon of philanthropy
and sullen and stubborn beneath the lash, that one is inclined for
the sake of the writer to leave them unread. But we should not have
said this unless we intended immediately and completely to unsay
it. The process of reading these essays was a process of
recantation. It is possible that the composition of some of them
was an act of duty, in the sense that the writing of a chapter of a
novel was not an act of duty. But the duty was imposed upon Henry
James not by the persuasions of a committee nor by the
solicitations of friends, but by a power much more commanding and
irresistible&mdash;a power so large and of such immense
significance to him that he scarcely succeeds with all his range of
expression in saying what it was or all that it meant to him. It
was Belgium, it was France, it was above all England and the
English tradition, it was everything that he had ever cared for of
civilization, beauty and art threatened with destruction and
arrayed before his imagination in one figure of tragic appeal.</p>

<p>Perhaps no other elderly man existed in August 1914 so well
qualified to feel imaginatively all that the outbreak of war meant
as Henry James. For years he had been appreciating ever more and
more finely what he calls "the rare, the sole, the exquisite
England": he had relished her discriminatingly as only the alien,
bred to different sounds and sights and circumstances, could relish
others so distinct and so delightful in their distinctness. Knowing
so well what she had given him, he was the more tenderly and
scrupulously grateful to her for the very reason that she seemed to
him to bestow her gifts half in ignorance of their value. Thus when
the news came that England was in danger he wandered in the August
sunshine half overwhelmed with the vastness of what had happened,
reckoning up his debt, conscious to the verge of agony of the
extent to which he had committed his own happiness to her, and
analysing incessantly and acutely just what it all meant to the
world and to him. At first, as he owned, he had "an elderly dread
of a waste of emotion...my house of the spirit amid everything
around me had become more and more the inhabited, adjusted,
familiar home"; but before long he found himself building additions
and upper storeys, throwing out extensions and protrusions,
indulging even, all recklessly, in gables and pinnacles and
battlements&mdash;things that had presently transformed the
unpretending place into I scarce know what to call it, a fortress
of the faith, a palace of the soul, an extravagant, bristling,
flag-flying structure which had quite as much to do with the air as
with the earth.</p>

<p>In a succession of images not to be torn from their context he
paints the state of his mind confronted by one aspect after another
of what appeared to him in so many diverse lights of glory and of
tragedy. His gesture as of one shrinking from the sight of the
distress, combined with an irresistible instinct of pity drawing
him again and again to its presence, recalls to the present writer
his reluctance to take a certain road in Rye because it led past
the workhouse gates and forced to his notice the dismal line of
tramps waiting for admittance. But in the case of the wounded and
the fugitive his humanity forced him again and again to face the
sight, and brought him the triumphant reward of finding that the
beauty emerging from such conditions more than matched the squalor.
"...their presence," he wrote of the wounded soldier, "is a blest
renewal of faith."</p>

<p>A moralist perhaps might object that terms of beauty and
ugliness are not the terms in which to speak of so vast a
catastrophe, nor should a writer exhibit so keen a curiosity as to
the tremors and vibrations of his own spirit in face of the
universal calamity. Yet, of all books describing the sights of war
and appealing for our pity, this largely personal account is the
one that best shows the dimensions of the whole. It is not merely
or even to any great extent that we have been stimulated
intellectually by the genius of Henry James to analyse shades and
subtleties; but rather that for the first and only time, so far as
we are aware, someone has reached an eminence sufficiently high
above the scene to give it its grouping and standing in the
universal. Read, for instance, the scene of the arrival of the
Belgian refugees by night at Rye, which we will not curtail and
thus rob of its completeness. It is precisely the same little scene
of refugees hurrying by in silence, save for the cry of a woman
carrying her child, which, in its thousand varieties, a thousand
pens have depicted during the past four years. They have done their
best, and left us acknowledging their effort, but feeling it to be
a kind of siege or battering ram laid to the emotions, which have
obstinately refused to yield their fruits. That it is altogether
otherwise with the scene painted for us by Henry James might
perhaps be credited to his training as a novelist. But when, in his
stately way, diminishing his stature not one whit and majestically
rolling the tide of his prose over the most rocky of obstacles, he
asks us for the gift of a motor-car, we cannot help feeling that if
all philanthropies had such advocates our pockets would never be
anything but empty. It is not that our emotions have been harassed
by the sufferings of the individual case. That he can do upon
occasion with beautiful effect. But what he does in this little
book of less than a hundred and twenty pages is, so it seems to us,
to present the best statement yet made of the largest point of
view. He makes us understand what civilization meant to him and
should mean to us. For him it was a spirit that overflowed the
material bounds of countries, but it is in France that he sees it
most plainly personified:</p>

<blockquote>...what happens to France happens to all that part of
ourselves which we are most proud, and most finely advised, to
enlarge and cultivate and consecrate...She is sole and single in
this, that she takes charge of those of the 'interests of man which
most dispose him to fraternize with himself, to pervade all his
possibilities and to taste all his faculties, and in consequence to
find and to make the earth a friendlier, an easier, and especially
a more various sojourn.</blockquote>

<p>If all our counsellors, we cannot help exclaiming, had spoken
with that voice!</p>

<p class="cpb">(Written in 1917.)</p>

<p>With this small volume,* which brings us down to about the year
1870, the memories of Henry James break off. It is more fitting to
say that they break off than that they come to an end, for although
we are aware that we shall hear his voice no more, there is no hint
of exhaustion or of leave-taking; the tone is as rich and
deliberate as if time were unending and matter infinite; what we
have seems to be but the prelude to what we are to have, but a
crumb, as he says, of a banquet now forever withheld. Someone
speaking once incautiously in his presence of his "completed" works
drew from him the emphatic assertion that never, never so long as
he lived could there be any talk of completion; his work would end
only with his life; and it seems in accord with this spirit that we
should feel ourselves pausing, at the end of a paragraph, while in
imagination the next great wave of the wonderful voice curves into
fullness.</p>

<p>[* <i>The Middle Years</i>, by Henry James.]</p>

<p>All great writers have, of course, an atmosphere in which they
seem most at their ease and at their best; a mood of the great
general mind which they interpret and indeed almost discover, so
that we come to read them rather for that than for any story or
character or scene of separate excellence. For ourselves Henry
James seems most entirely in his element, doing that is to say what
everything favours his doing, when it is a question of
recollection. The mellow light which swims over the past, the
beauty which suffuses even the commonest little figures of that
time, the shadow in which the detail of so many things can be
discerned which the glare of day flattens out, the depth, the
richness, the calm, the humour of the whole pageant&mdash;all this
seems to have been his natural atmosphere and his most abiding
mood. It is the atmosphere of all those stories in which aged
Europe is the background for young America. It is the half light in
which he sees most, and sees farthest. To Americans, indeed, to
Henry James and to Hawthorne, we owe the best relish of the past in
our literature&mdash;not the past of romance and chivalry, but the
immediate past of vanished dignity and faded fashions. The novels
teem with it; but wonderful as they are, we are tempted to say that
the memories are yet more wonderful, in that they are more exactly
Henry James, and give more precisely his tone and his gesture. In
them his benignity is warmer, his humour richer, his solicitude
more exquisite, his recognition of beauty, fineness, humanity more
instant and direct. He comes to his task with an indescribable air
of one so charged and laden with precious stuff that he hardly
knows how to divest himself of it all&mdash;where to find space to
set down this and that, how to resist altogether the claims of some
other gleaming object in the background; appearing so busy, so
unwieldy with ponderous treasure that his dexterity in disposing of
it, his consummate knowledge of how best to place each fragment,
afford us the greatest delight that literature has had to offer for
many a year. The mere sight is enough to make anyone who has ever
held a pen in his hand consider his art afresh in the light of this
extraordinary example of it. And our pleasure at the mere sight
soon merges in the thrill with which we recognize, if not directly
then by hearsay, the old world of London-life which he brings out
of the shades and sets tenderly and solidly before us as if his
last gift were the most perfect and precious of the treasures
hoarded in "the scented chest of our savings."</p>

<p>After the absence from Europe of about nine years which is
recorded in <i>Notes of a Son and Brother</i>, he arrived in
Liverpool on March 1st, 1869, and found himself "in the face of an
opportunity that affected me then and there as the happiest, the
most interesting, the most alluring and beguiling that could ever
have opened before a somewhat disabled young man who was about to
complete his twenty-sixth year." He proceeded to London, and took
up his lodging with a "kind slim celibate," a Mr. Lazarus
Fox&mdash;every detail is dear to him&mdash;who let out slices of
his house in Half Moon Street to gentlemen lodgers. The London of
that day, as Henry James at once proceeded to ascertain with those
amazingly delicate and tenacious tentacles of his, was an extremely
characteristic and uncompromising organism. "The big broom of
change" had swept it hardly at all since the days of Byron at
least. She was still the "unaccommodating and unaccommodated
city...the city too indifferent, too proud, too unaware, too stupid
even if one will, to enter any lists that involved her moving from
her base and that thereby...enjoyed the enormous 'pull,' for making
her impression, of ignoring everything but her own perversities and
then of driving these home with an emphasis not to be gainsaid."
The young American ("brooding monster that I was, born to
discriminate <i>à tout propos</i>") was soon breakfasting with the
gentleman upstairs (Mr. Albert Rutson), eating his fried sole and
marmalade with other gentlemen from the Home Office, the Foreign
Office, the House of Commons, whose freedom to lounge over that
meal impressed him greatly, and whose close questioning as to the
composition of Grant's first Cabinet embarrassed him not a little.
The whole scene, which it would be an impiety to dismember further,
has the very breath of the age in it. The whiskers, the leisure,
the intentness of those gentlemen upon politics, their conviction
that the composition of Cabinets was the natural topic for the
breakfast-table, and that a stranger unable, as Henry James found
himself, to throw light upon it was "only not perfectly ridiculous
because perfectly insignificant"&mdash;all this provides a picture
that many of us will be able to see again as we saw it once perhaps
from the perch of an obliging pair of shoulders.</p>

<p>The main facts about that London, as all witnesses agree in
testifying, were its smallness compared with our city, the limited
number of distractions and amusements available, and the consequent
tendency of all people worth knowing to know each other and to form
a very accessible and, at the same time, highly enviable society.
Whatever the quality that gained you admittance, whether it was
that you had done something or showed yourself capable of doing
something worthy of respect, the compliment was not an empty one. A
young man coming up to London might in a few months claim to have
met Tennyson, Browning, Matthew Arnold, Carlyle, Froude, George
Eliot, Herbert Spencer, Huxley, and Mill. He had met them; he had
not merely brushed against them in a crowd. He had heard them talk;
he had even offered something of his own. The conditions of those
days allowed a kind of conversation which, so the survivors always
maintain, is an art unknown in what they are pleased to call our
chaos. What with recurring dinner parties and Sunday calls, and
country visits lasting far beyond the week-ends of our generation,
the fabric of friendship was solidly built up and carefully
preserved. The tendency perhaps was rather to a good fellowship in
which the talk was wide-sweeping, extremely well informed, and
impersonal than to the less formal, perhaps more intense and
indiscriminate, intimacies of to-day. We read of little societies
of the sixties, the Cosmopolitan and the Century, meeting on
Wednesday and on Sunday evenings to discuss the serious questions
of the times, and we have the feeling that they could claim a more
representative character than anything of the sort we can show now.
We are left with the impression that whatever went forward in those
days, either among the statesmen or among the men of
letters&mdash;and there was a closer connection than there is
now&mdash;was promoted or inspired by the members of this group.
Undoubtedly the resources of the day&mdash;and how magnificent they
were!&mdash;were better organized; and it must occur to every
reader of their memoirs that a reason is to be found in the
simplicity which accepted the greatness of certain names and
imposed something like order on their immediate neighbourhood.
Having crowned their kin they worshipped him with the most
whole-hearted loyalty. Groups of people would come together at
Freshwater, in that old garden where the houses of Melbury Road now
stand, or in various London centres, and live as it seems to us for
months at a time, some of them indeed for the duration of their
lives, in the mood of the presiding genius. Watts and Burne-Jones
in one quarter of the town, Carlyle in another, George Eliot in a
third, almost as much as Tennyson in his island, imposed their laws
upon a circle which had spirit and beauty to recommend it as well
as an uncritical devotion.</p>

<p>Henry James, of course, was not a person to accept laws or to
make one of any circle in a sense which implies the blunting of the
critical powers. Happily for us, he came over not only with the
hoarded curiosity of years, but also with the detachment of the
stranger and the critical sense of the artist. He was immensely
appreciative, but he was also immensely observant. Thus it comes
about that his fragment revives, indeed stamps afresh, the great
figures of the epoch, and, what is no less important, illumines the
lesser figures by whom they were surrounded. Nothing could be
happier than his portrait of Mrs. Greville, "with her exquisite
good nature and her innocent fatuity," who was, of course, very
much an individual, but also a type of the enthusiastic sisterhood
which, with all its extravagances and generosities and what we
might unkindly, but not without the authority of Henry James, call
absurdity, now seems extinct. We shall not spoil the reader's
impression of the superb passage describing a visit arranged by
Mrs. Greville to George Eliot by revealing what happened on that
almost tragic occasion. It is more excusable to dwell for a moment
upon the drawing-room at Milford Cottage,</p>

<blockquote>the most embowered retreat for social innocence that it
was possible to conceive...The red candles in the red shades have
remained with me, inexplicably, as a vivid note of this pitch,
shedding their rosy light, with the autumn gale, the averted
reality, all shut out, upon such felicities of feminine
helplessness as I couldn't have prefigured in advance, and as
exemplified, for further gathering in, the possibilities of the old
tone.</blockquote>

<p>The drawn curtains, the "copious service," the second volume of
the new novel "half-uncut" laid ready to hand, "the exquisite head
and incomparable brush of the domesticated collie"&mdash;that is
the familiar setting. He recalls the high-handed manner in which
these ladies took their way through life, baffling the very stroke
of age and disaster with their unquenchable optimism, ladling out
with both hands every sort of gift upon their passage, and bringing
to port in their tow the most incongruous and battered of
derelicts. No doubt "a number of the sharp truths that one might
privately apprehend beat themselves beautifully in vain" against
such defences. Truth, so it seems to us, was not so much
disregarded as flattered out of countenance by the energy with
which they pursued the beautiful, the noble, the poetic, and
ignored the possibility of another side of things. The extravagant
steps which they would take to snare whatever grace or atmosphere
they desired at the moment lend their lives in retrospect a glamour
of adventure, aspiration, and triumph such as seems for good or for
evil banished from our conscious and much more critical day. Was a
friend ill? A wall would be knocked down to admit the morning sun.
Did the doctor prescribe fresh milk? The only perfectly healthy cow
in England was at your service. All this personal exuberance Henry
James brings back in the figure of Mrs. Greville, "friend of the
super-eminent" and priestess at the different altars. Cannot we
almost hear the "pleasant growling note of Tennyson" answering her
"mild extravagance of homage" with "Oh, yes, you may do what you
like&mdash;-so long as you don't kiss me before the cabman!"</p>

<p>And then with the entrance of Lady Waterford, Henry James
ponders lovingly the quality which seems to hang about those days
and people as the very scent of the flower&mdash;"the quality of
personal beauty, to say nothing of personal accomplishment as our
fathers were appointed to enjoy it...Scarce to be sated that form
of wonder, to my own imagination I confess." Were they as beautiful
as we like to remember them, or was it that the whole atmosphere
made a beautiful presence, any sort of distinction or eminence
indeed, felt in a way no longer so carefully arranged for, or so
unquestionably accepted? Was it not all a part of the empty London
streets, of the four-wheelers even, lined with straw, of the stuffy
little boxes of the public dining rooms, of the protectedness, of
the leisure? But if they had merely to stand and be looked at, how
splendidly they did it! A certain width of space seems to be a
necessary condition for the blooming of such splendid plants as
Lady Waterford, who, when she had dazzled sufficiently with her
beauty and presence, had only to take up her brush to be acclaimed
the equal of Titian or of Watts.</p>

<p>Personality, whatever one may mean by it, seems to have been
accorded a licence for the expression of itself for which we can
find no parallel in the present day. The gift if you had it was
encouraged and sheltered beyond the bounds of what now seems
possible. Tennyson, of course, is the supreme example of what we
mean, and happily for us Henry James was duly taken to that shrine
and gives with extraordinary skill a new version of the mystery
which in our case will supersede the old. "The fond prefigurements
of youthful piety are predestined, more often than not, I think,
experience interfering, to strange and violent shocks...Fine, fine,
fine, could he only be..." So he begins, and so continuing for some
time leads us up to the pronouncement that "Tennyson was not
Tennysonian." The air one breathed at Aldworth was one in which
nothing but "the blest obvious, or at least the blest outright,
could so much as attempt to live...It was a large and simple and
almost empty occasion...He struck me in truth as neither knowing
nor communicating knowledge." He recited <i>Locksley Hall</i> and
"Oh dear, oh dear...I heard him in cool surprise take even more out
of his verse than he had put in." And so by a series of
qualifications which are all beautifully adapted to sharpen the
image without in the least destroying it, we are led to the
satisfactory and convincing conclusion, "My critical reaction
hadn't in the least invalidated our great man's being a
Bard&mdash;it had in fact made him and left him more a Bard than
ever." We see, really for the first time, how obvious and simple
and almost empty it was, how "the glory was without history," the
poetic character "more worn than paid for, or at least more saved
than spent," and yet somehow the great man revives and flourishes
in the new conditions and dawns upon us more of a Bard than we had
got into the habit of thinking him. The same service of defining,
limiting, and restoring to life he performs as beautifully for the
ghost of George Eliot, and proclaims himself, as the faithful will
be glad to hear, "even a very Derondist of Derondists."</p>

<p>And thus looking back into the past which is all changed and
gone (he could mark, he said, the very hour or the change) Henry
James performs a last act of piety which is supremely
characteristic of him. The English world of that day was very clear
to him; it had a fineness and a distinction which he professed half
humorously not to find in our "vast monotonous mob." It had given
him friendship and opportunity and much else, no doubt, that it had
no consciousness of giving. Such a gift he of all people could
never forget; and this book of memories sounds to us like a superb
act of thanksgiving. What could he do to make up for it all, he
seems to have asked himself. And then with all the creative power
at his command he summons back the past and makes us a present of
that. If we could have had the choice, that is what we should have
chosen, not entirely for what it gives us of the dead, but also for
what it gives us of him. Many will hear his voice again in these
pages; they will perceive once more that solicitude for others,
that immense desire to help which had its origin, one might guess,
in the aloofness and loneliness of the artist's life. It seemed as
if he were grateful for the chance of taking part in the ordinary
affairs of the world, of assuring himself that, in spite of his
absorption with the fine and remote things of the imagination, he
had not lost touch with human interests. To acknowledge any claim
that was in the least connected with the friends or memories of the
past gave him, for this reason, a peculiar joy; and we can believe
that if he could have chosen, his last words would have been like
these, words of recollection and of love.</p>

<h3><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>3. THE LETTERS OF HENRY JAMES</h3>

<p class="cpb">(* Written in 1920.)</p>

<p>Who, on stepping from the cathedral dusk, the growl and boom of
the organ still in the ears, and the eyes still shaded to observe
better whatever intricacy of carving or richness of marble may
there be concealed, can breast the stir of the street and instantly
and briskly sum up and deliver his impressions? How discriminate,
how formulate? How, Henry James may be heard grimly asking, dare
you pronounce any opinion whatever upon me? In the first place only
by taking cover under some such figure as implies that, still dazed
and well-nigh drowned, our gesture at the finish is more one of
exclamation than of interpretation. To soothe and to inspirit there
comes, a moment later, the consciousness that, although in the eyes
of Henry James our attempt is foredoomed to failure, nevertheless
his blessing is upon it. Renewal of life, on such terms as we can
grant it, upon lips, in minds, here in London, here among English
men and women, would receive from him the most generous
acknowledgment; and with a royal complacency, he would admit that
our activities could hardly be better employed. Nor are we left to
grope without a guide. It would not be easy to find a difficult
task better fulfilled than by Mr. Percy Lubbock in his introduction
and connecting pararaphs.* It seems to us, and this not only before
reading the letters but more emphatically afterwards, that the
lines of interpretation he lays down are the true ones. They
end&mdash;as he is the first to declare&mdash;in the heart of
darkness; but any understanding that we may have won of a difficult
problem is at every point fortified and corrected by the help of
his singularly thoughtful and intimate essay. His intervention is
always illuminating.</p>

<p>(* <i>The Letters of Henry James</i>. Edited by Percy
Lubbock.)</p>

<p>It must be admitted that these remarks scarcely seem called for
by anything specially abstruse in the first few chapters. If ever a
young American proved himself capable of giving a clear and
composed account of his experiences in Europe during the seventies
of the last century that young American was Henry James. He
recounts his seeings and doings, his dinings out and meetings, his
country house visits, like a guest too well-bred to show surprise
even if he feels it. A "cosmopolitanized American," as he calls
himself, was far more likely, it appears, to find things flat than
to find them surprising; to sink into the depths of English
civilization as if it were a soft feather bed inducing sleep and
warmth and security rather than shocks and sensations. Henry James,
of course, was much too busy recording impressions to fall asleep;
it only appears that he never did anything, and never met anyone,
in those early days, capable of rousing him beyond the gay and
sprightly mood so easily and amusingly sustained in his letters
home. Yet he went everywhere; he met everyone, as the sprinkling of
famous names and great occasions abundantly testify. Let one fair
specimen suffice:</p>

<blockquote>Yesterday I dined with Lord Houghton&mdash;with
Gladstone, Tennyson, Dr. Schliemann (the excavator of old Mycenae,
&amp;c.), and half a dozen other men of "high culture." I sat next
but one to the Bard and heard most of his talk, which was all about
port wine and tobacco; he seems to know much about them, and can
drink a whole bottle of port at a sitting with no incommodity. He
is very swarthy and scraggy, and strikes one' at first as much less
handsome than his photos: but gradually you see that it's a face of
genius. He had I know not what simplicity, speaks with a strange
rustic accent and seemed altogether like a creature of some
primordial English stock, a thousand miles away from American
manufacture. Behold me after dinner conversing affably with Mr.
Gladstone-not by my own seeking, but by the almost importunate
affection of Lord H. But I was glad of a chance to feel the
"personality" of a great political leader&mdash;or as G. is now
thought here even, I think, by his partisans, ex-leader. That of
Gladstone is very fascinating&mdash;his urbanity extreme-his eye
that of a man of genius&mdash;and his apparent self-surrender to
what he is talking of without a flaw. He made a great impression on
me&mdash;greater than anyone I have seen here: though 'tis perhaps
owing to my <i>naïveté</i>, and unfamiliarity with
statesmen...</blockquote>

<p>And so to the Oxford and Cambridge boat-race. The impression is
well and brightly conveyed; what we miss, perhaps, is any body of
resistance to the impression&mdash;any warrant for thinking that
the receiving mind is other than a stretched white sheet. The best
comment upon that comes in his own words a few pages later. "It is
something to have learned how to write." If we look upon many of
these early pages as experiments in the art of writing by one whose
standard of taste exacts that small things must be done perfectly
before big things are even attempted, we shall understand that
their perfection is of the inexpressive kind that often precedes a
late maturity. He is saying all that his means allow him to say.
Moreover, he is saying it already, as most good letter writers
learn to say it, not to an individual but to a chosen assembly. "It
is, indeed, I think, the very essence of a good letter to be
shown," he wrote; "it is wasted if it is kept for <i>one</i>...I
give you full leave to read mine aloud at your soirees!" Therefore,
if we refrain from quotation, it is not that passages of the
necessary quality are lacking. It is, rather, that while he writes
charmingly, intelligently and adequately of this, that and the
other, we begin by guessing and end by resenting the fact that his
mind is elsewhere. It is not the dinner parties&mdash;a hundred and
seven in one season&mdash;nor the ladies and gentlemen, nor even
the Tennysons and the Gladstones that interest him primarily; the
pageant passes before him: the impressions ceaselessly descend; and
yet as we watch we also wait for the clue, the secret of it all. It
is, indeed, clear that if he discharged the duties of his position
with every appearance of equanimity the choice of the position
itself was one of momentous importance, constantly requiring
examination, and, with its promise of different possibilities,
harassing his peace till the end of time. On what spot of the
civilized globe was he to settle? His vibrations and vacillations
in front of that problem suffer much in our report of them, but in
the early days the case against America was simply that "...it
takes an old civilization to set a novelist in motion."</p>

<p>Next, Italy presented herself; but the seductions of "the golden
climate" were fatal to work. Paris had obvious advantages, but the
drawbacks were equally positive&mdash;"I have seen almost nothing
of the literary fraternity, and there are fifty reasons why I
should not become intimate with them. I don't like their wares, and
they don't like any others; and, besides, they are not
<i>accueillants</i>." London exercised a continuous double pressure
of attraction and repulsion to which finally he succumbed, to the
extent of making his headquarters in the metropolis without
shutting his eyes to her faults. "I am attracted to London in spite
of the long list of reasons why I should not be; I think it, on the
whole, the best point of view in the world...But the question is
interminable." When he wrote that, he was thirty-seven; a mature
age; an age at which the native growing confidently in his own soil
is already putting forth whatever flower fate ordains and natural
conditions allow. But Henry James had neither roots nor soil; he
was of the tribe of wanderers and aliens; a winged visitant,
ceaselessly circling and seeking, unattached, uncommitted, ranging
hither and thither at his own free will, and only at length
precariously settling and delicately inserting his proboscis in the
thickset lusty blossoms of the old garden beds.</p>

<p>Here, then, we distinguish one of the strains, always to some
extent present in the letters before us, from which they draw their
unlikeness to any others in the language, and, indeed, bring us at
times to doubt whether they are "in the language" at all. If London
is primarily a point of view, if the whole field of human activity
is only a prospect and a pageant, then we cannot help asking, as
the store of impressions heaps itself up, what is the aim of the
spectator, what is the purpose of his hoard? A spectator, alert,
aloof, endlessly interested, endlessly observant, Henry James
undoubtedly was; but as obviously, though not so simply, the long
drawn process_ of adjustment and preparation was from first to last
controlled and manipulated by a purpose which, as the years went
by, only dealt more powerfully and completely with the treasures of
a more complex sensibility. Yet, when we look to find the purpose
expressed, to see the material in the act of transmutation, we are
met by silence, we are blindly waved outside. "To write a series of
good little tales I deem ample work for a life time. It's at least
a relief to have arranged one's life time." The words are youthful,
perhaps intentionally light but few and frail as they are, they
have almost alone to bear the burden built upon them, to answer the
questions and quiet the suspicions of those who insist that a
writer must have a mission and proclaim it aloud. Scarcely for a
moment does Henry James talk of his writing; never for an instant
is the thought of it absent from his mind. Thus, in the letters to
Stevenson abroad we hear behind everything else a brooding murmur
of amazement and horror at the notion of living with savages. How,
he seems to be asking himself, while on the surface all is
admiration and affection, can he endure it&mdash;how could I write
my books if I lived in Samoa with savages? All refers to his
writing; all points in to that preoccupation. But so far as actual
statement goes the books might have sprung as silently and
spontaneously as daffodils in spring. No notice is taken of their
birth. Nor does it matter to him what people say. Their remarks are
probably wide of the point, or if they have a passing truth they
are uttered in unavoidable ignorance of the fact that each book is
a step onward in a gradual process of evolution, the plan of which
is onward only to the author himself. He remains inscrutable.
silent, and assured.</p>

<p>How, then, are we to explain the apparent inconsistency of his
disappointment when, some years later, the failure of <i>The
Bostonians</i> and <i>Princess Casamassima</i> brought him face to
face with the fact that he was not destined to be a popular
novelist&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>...I am still staggering [he wrote] a good deal under
the mysterious and to me inexplicable injury
wrought&mdash;apparently&mdash;upon my situation by my two last
novels, the <i>Bostonians</i> and the <i>Princess</i>, from which I
expected so much and derived so little. They have reduced the
desire, and the demand, for my productions to zero&mdash;as I judge
from the fact that though I have for a good while past been writing
a number of good short things, I remain irremediably
unpublished.</blockquote>

<p>Compensations at once suggested themselves; he was "really in
better form then ever" and found himself "holding the 'critical
world' at large in singular contempt" but we have Mr. Lubbock's
authority for supposing that it was chiefly a desire to retrieve
the failure of the novels that led him to strive so strenuously,
and in the end so disastrously, for success upon the stage. Success
and failure upon the lips of a man who never for a moment doubted
the authenticity of his genius or for a second lowered his standard
of the artist's duty have not their ordinary meaning. Perhaps we
may hold that failure in the sense that Henry James used it meant,
more than anything, failure on the part of the public to receive.
That was the public's fault, but that did not lessen the
catastrophe or make less desirable the vision of an order of things
where the public gratefully and with understanding accepts at the
artists' hands what is, after all, the finest essence, transmuted
and returned, of the public itself. When <i>Guy Domville</i>
failed, and Henry James for one "abominable quarter of an hour"
faced the "yelling barbarians" and "learned what could be the
savagery of their disappointment that one wasn't perfectly the
<i>same</i> as everything else they had ever seen" he had no doubt
of his genius; but he went home to reflect:</p>

<blockquote>I have felt for a long time past that I have fallen
upon evil days&mdash;every sign and symbol of one's being in the
least wanted, anywhere or by anyone, having so utterly failed. A
new generation, that I know not, and mainly prize not, has taken
universal possession.</blockquote>

<p>The public henceforward appeared to him, so far as it appeared
at all, a barbarian crowd incapable of taking in their rude paws
the beauty and delicacy that he had to offer. More and more was he
confirmed in his conviction that an artist can neither live with
the public, write for it, nor seek his material in the midst of it.
A select group, representative of civilization, had at the same
time protested its devotion, but how far can one write for a select
group? Is not genius itself restricted, or at least influenced in
its very essence by the consciousness that its gifts are to the
few, its concern with the few, and its revelation apparent only to
scattered enthusiasts who may be the advance guard of the future or
only a little band strayed from the high road and doomed to
extinction while civilization marches irresistibly elsewhere? All
this Henry James poised, pondered, and held in debate. No doubt the
influence upon the direction of his work was profound. But for all
that he went serenely forward; bought a house, bought a typewriter,
shut himself up, surrounded himself with furniture of the right
period, and was able at the critical moment by the timely, though
rash, expenditure of a little capital to ensure that certain
hideous new cottages did not deface his point of view. One admits
to a momentary malice. The seclusion is so deliberate; the
exclusion so complete. All within the sanctuary is so prosperous
and smooth. No private responsibilities harassed him; no public
duties claimed him; his health was excellent and his income, in
spite of his protests to the contrary, more than adequate to his
needs. The voice that issued from the hermitage might well speak
calmly, subtly, of exquisite emotions, and yet now and then we are
warned by something exacting and even acid in its tone that the
effects of seclusion are not altogether benign. "Yes. Ibsen is
ugly, common, hard, prosaic, bottomlessly bourgeois..." "But, oh,
yes, dear Louis, [<i>Tess of the D'urbervilles</i>] is vile. The
pretence of 'sexuality' is only equalled by the absence of it, and
the abomination of the language by the author's reputation for
style." The lack of "aesthetic curiosity" in Meredith and his
circle was highly to be deplored. The artist in him "was nothing to
the good citizen and liberalized bourgeois." The works of Tolstoy
and Dostoevsky are "fluid puddings" and "when you ask me if I don't
feel Dostoevsky's 'mad jumble, that flings things down in a heap,'
nearer truth and beauty than the picking up and composing that you
instance in Stevenson, I reply with emphasis that I feel nothing of
the sort." It is true that in order to keep these points at their
sharpest one has had to brush aside a mass of qualification and
explanation which make each the apex of a formidable body of
criticism. It is only for a moment that the seclusion seems
cloistered, and the feelings of an artist confounded with those of
a dilettante.</p>

<p>Yet as that second flits across the mind, with the chill of a
shadow brushing the waves, we realize what a catastrophe for all of
us it would have been if the prolonged experiment, the struggle and
the solitude of Henry James's life had ended in failure. Excuses
could have been found both for him and for us. It is impossible,
one might have said, for the artist not to compromise, or, if he
persists in his allegiance, then, almost inevitably, he must live
apart, for ever alien, slowly perishing in his isolation. The
history of literature is strewn with examples of both disasters.
When, therefore, almost perceptibly at a given moment, late in the
story, something yields, something is overcome, something dark and
dense glows in splendour, it is as if the beacon flamed bright on
the hilltop; as if before our eyes the crown of long deferred
completion and culmination swung slowly into place. Not columns but
pages, and not pages but chapters, might be filled with comment and
attempted analysis of this late and mighty flowering, this
vindication, this crowded gathering together and superb welding
into shape of all the separate strands, alien instincts,
irreconcilable desires of the twofold nature. For, as we dimly
perceive, here at last two warring forces have coalesced; here, by
a prodigious efflort of concentration, the field of human activity
is brought into fresh focus, revealing new horizons, new landmarks,
and new lights upon it of right and wrong.</p>

<p>But it is for the reader at leisure to delve in the rich
material of the later letters and build up from it the complex
figure of the artist in his completeness. If we choose two
passages&mdash;-one upon conduct, the other upon the gift of a
leather dressing case&mdash;to represent Henry James in his later
mood we purposely brush aside a thousand others which have
innumerable good claims to be put in their place.</p>

<blockquote>If there be a wisdom in not feeling&mdash;to the last
throb&mdash;the great things that happen to us, it is a wisdom that
I shall never either know or esteem. Let your soul live&mdash;it's
the only life that isn't on the whole a sell...<br>
<br>
That [the dressing case] is the grand fact of the
situation&mdash;that is the tawny lion, portentous creature in my
path. I can't get past him, I can't get round him, and on the other
hand he stands glaring at me, refusing to give way and practically
blocking all my future. I can't live with him, you see; because I
can't live <i>up</i> to him. His claims, his pretensions, his
dimensions, his assumptions and consumptions, above all the manner
in which he causes every surrounding object (on my poor premises or
within my poor range) to tell a dingy, or deplorable tale&mdash;all
this makes him the very scourge of my life, the very blot on my
scutcheon. He doesn't regild that rusty metal&mdash;he simply takes
up an attitude of gorgeous swagger, straight in front of all the
rust and the rubbish, which makes me look as if I had stolen
<i>somebody else's</i> (regarnished <i>Blason</i>) and were trying
to palm it off as my own...<i>He is out of the
picture</i>&mdash;out of <i>mine</i>; and behold me condemned to
live for ever with that canvas turned to the wall. Do you know what
that means?</blockquote>

<p>And so on and so on. There, portentous and prodigious, we hear
unmistakably the voice of Henry James. There, to our thinking, we
have exploded in our ears the report of his enormous, sustained,
increasing, and overwhelming love of life. It issues from whatever
tortuous channels and dark tunnels like a flood at its fullest.
There is nothing too little, too large, too remote, too queer for
it not to flow round, float off and make its own. Nothing in the
end has chilled or repressed him; everything has fed and filled
him; the saturation is complete. The labours of the morning might
be elaborate and austere. There remained an irrepressible fund of
vitality which the flying hand at midnight addressed fully and
affectionately to friend after friend, each sentence, from the
whole fling of his person to the last snap of his fingers, firmly
fashioned and throwing out at its swiftest well nigh incredible
felicities of phrase.</p>

<p>The only difficulty, perhaps, was to find an envelope that would
contain the bulky product, or any reason, when two sheets were
blackened, for not filling a third. Truly, Lamb House was no
sanctuary, but rather a "small, crammed and wholly unlucrative
hotel," and the hermit no meagre solitary but a tough and even
stoical man of the world, English in his humour, Johnsonian in his
sanity, who lived every second with insatiable gusto and in the
flux and fury of his impressions obeyed his own injunction to
remain "as solid and fixed and dense as you can." For to be as
subtle as Henry James one must also be as robust; to enjoy his
power of exquisite selection one must have "lived and loved and
cursed and floundered and enjoyed and suffered," and, with the
appetite of a giant, have swallowed the whole.</p>

<p>Yet, if he shared with magnanimity, if he enjoyed hugely, there
remained something incommunicable, something reserved, as if in the
last resort, it was not to us that he turned, nor from us that he
received, nor into our hands that he placed his offerings. There
they stand, the many books, products of "an inexhaustible
sensibility," all with the final seal upon them of artistic form,
which, as it imposes its stamp, sets apart the object thus
consecrated and makes it no longer part of ourselves. In this
impersonality the maker himself desired to share&mdash;"to take
it," as he said, "wholly, exclusively with the pen (the style, the
genius) and absolutely not at all with the person," to be "the mask
without the face," the alien in our midst, the worker who when his
work is done turns even from that and reserves his confidence for
the solitary hour, like that at midnight when, alone on the
threshold of creation, Henry James speaks aloud to himself "and the
prospect clears and flushes, and my poor blest old genius pats me
so admirably and lovingly on the back that I turn, I screw round,
and bend my lips to passionately, in my gratitude, kiss its hands."
So that is why, perhaps, as life swings and clangs, booms and
reverberates, we have the sense of an altar of service, of
sacrifice, to which, as we pass out, we bend the knee.</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>25. GEORGE MOORE</h2>

<p>The only criticism worth having at present is that which is
spoken, not written&mdash;spoken over wine-glasses and coffee-cups
late at night, flashed out on the spur of the moment by people
passing who have not time to finish their sentences, let alone
consider the dues of editors or the feelings of friends. About
living writers these talker's (it is one of their most engaging
peculiarities) are always in violent disagreement. Take George
Moore, for example. George Moore is the best living
novelist&mdash;and the worst; writes the most beautiful prose of
his time&mdash;and the feeblest; has a passion for literature which
none of those dismal pundits, his contemporaries, shares; but how
whimsical his judgments are, how ill-balanced, childish and
egotistical, into the bargain! So they hammer the horseshoe out; so
the sparks fly; and the worth of the criticism lies not so much in
the accuracy of each blow as in the heat it engenders, the sense it
kindles that the matter of George Moore and his works is of the
highest importance, which, without waiting another instant, we must
settle for ourselves.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not accident only, but a vague recollection of
dipping and dallying in <i>Esther Waters, Evelyn Innes, The
Lake</i>, which makes us take down in its new and stately form
<i>Hail And Farewell</i> (Heinemann)&mdash;the two large volumes
which George Moore has written openly and directly about himself.
For all his novels are written, covertly and obliquely, about
himself, so at least memory would persuade us, and it may help us
to understand them if we steep ourselves in the pure waters which
are elsewhere tinged with fictitious flavours. But are not all
novels about the writer's self, we might ask? It is only as he sees
people that we can see them; his fortunes colour and his oddities
shape his vision until what we see is not the thing itself, but the
thing seen and the seer inextricably mixed. There are degrees,
however. The great novelist feels, sees, believes with such
intensity of conviction that he hurls his belief outside himself
and it flies off and lives an independent life of its own, becomes
Natasha, Pierre, Levin, and is no longer Tolstoy. When, however,
Mr. Moore creates a Natasha she may be charming, foolish, lovely,
but her beauty, her folly, her charm are not hers, but Mr. Moore's.
All her qualities refer to him. In other words, Mr. Moore is
completely lacking in dramatic power. On the face of it, <i>Esther
Waters</i> has all the appearance of a great novel; it has
sincerity, shapeliness, style; it has surpassing seriousness and
integrity; but because Mr. Moore has not the strength to project
Esther from himself its virtues collapse and fall about it like a
tent with a broken pole. There it lies, this novel without a
heroine, and what remains of it is George Moore himself, a ruin of
lovely language and some exquisite descriptions of the Sussex
downs. For the novelist who has no dramatic power, no fire of
conviction within, leans upon nature for support; she lifts him up
and enhances his mood without destroying it.</p>

<p>But the defects of a novelist may well be the glories of his
brother the autobiographer, and we find, to our delight, that the
very qualities which weaken Mr. Moore's novels are the making of
his memoirs. This complex character, at once diffident and
self-assertive, this sportsman who goes out shooting in ladies'
high-heeled boots, this amateur jockey who loves literature beyond
the apple of his eye, this amorist who is so innocent, this
sensualist who is so ascetic, this complex and uneasy character, in
short, with its lack of starch and pomp and humbug, its pliability
and malice and shrewdness and incompetence, is made of too many
incompatible elements to concentrate into the diamond of a great
artist, and is better occupied in exploring its own vagaries than
in explaining those of other people. For one thing, Mr. Moore is
without that robust belief in himself which leads men to prophesy
and create. Nobody was ever more diffident. As a little boy they
told him that only an ugly old woman would marry him, and he has
never got over it. "For it is difficult for me to believe any good
of myself. Within the oftentimes bombastic and truculent appearance
that I present to the world trembles a heart shy as a wren in the
hedgerow or a mouse along the wainscoting." The least noise
startles him, and the ordinary proceedings of mankind fill him with
wonder and alarm. Their streets have so many names; their coats
have so many buttons; the ordinary business of life is altogether
beyond him. But with the timidity of the mouse he has also its
gigantic boldness. This meek grey innocent creature runs right over
the lion's paws. There is nothing that Mr. Moore will not say; by
his own confession he ought to be excluded from every drawing-room
in South Kensington. If his friends forgive him it is only because
to Mr. Moore all things are forgiven. Once when he was a child,
"inspired by an uncontrollable desire to break the monotony of
infancy," he threw all his clothes into a hawthorn tree and "ran
naked in front of my nurse or governess screaming with delight at
the embarrassment I was causing her." The habit has remained with
him. He loves to take off his clothes and run screaming with
delight at the fuss and blush and embarrassment which he is causing
that dear old governess, the British Public. But the antics of Mr.
Moore, though impish and impudent, are, after all, so amusing and
so graceful that the governess, it is said, sometimes hides behind
a tree to watch. That scream of his, that garrulous chuckle as of
small birds chattering in a nest, is a merry sound; and then how
melodiously he draws out his long notes when dusk descends and the
stars rise! Always you will find him haunting the evening, when the
downs are fading into waves of silver and the grey Irish fields are
melting into the grey Irish hills. The storm never breaks over his
head, the thunder never roars in his cars, the rain never drenches
him. No; the worst that befalls him is that Teresa has not filled
the Moderator lamp sufficiently full, so that the company which is
dining in the garden under the apple tree must adjourn to the
dining-room, where Mr. Osborne, Mr. Hughes, Mr. Longworth, Mr.
Seumas O'Sullivan, Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Yeats are awaiting
them.</p>

<p>And then in the dining-room, Mr. Moore sitting down and offering
a cigar to his friends, takes up again the thread of that
interminable discourse, which, if it lapses into the gulfs of
reverie for a moment, begins anew wherever he finds a bench or
chair to sit on or can link his arm in a friend's, or can find even
some discreet sympathetic animal who will only occasionally lift a
paw in silence. He talks incessantly about books and politics; of
the vision that came to him in the Chelsea road; how Mr. Colville
bred Belgian hares on the Sussex downs; about the death of his cat;
the Roman Catholic religion; how dogma is the death of literature;
how the names of poets determine their poetry; how Mr. Yeats is
like a crow, and he himself has been forced to sit on the window
sill in his pyjamas. One thing follows another; out of the, present
flowers the past; it is as easy, inconsequent, melodious as the
smoke of those fragrant cigars. But as one listens more attentively
one perceives that while each topic floats up as easily as cigar
smoke into the air, the blue wreaths have a strange fixity; they do
not disperse, they unite; they build up the airy chambers of a
lifetime, and as we listen in the Temple Gardens, in Ebury Street,
in Paris, in Dublin to Mr. Moore talking, we explore from start to
finish, from those earliest days in Ireland to these latest in
London, the habitation of his soul.</p>

<p>But let us apply Mr. Moore's own test to Mr. Moore's own work.
What interests him, he says, is not the three or four beautiful
poems that a man may have written, but the mind that he brings into
the world; and "by a mind I mean a new way of feeling and seeing."
When the fierce tide of talk once more washes the battlements of
Mr. Moore's achievement let us throw into mid-stream these remarks;
not one of his novels is a masterpiece; they are silken tents which
have no poles; but he has brought a new mind into the world; he has
given us a new way of feeling and seeing; he has devised&mdash;very
painfully, for he is above all things painstaking, eking out a
delicate gift laboriously&mdash;a means of liquidating the
capricious and volatile essence of himself and decanting it in
these memoirs; and that, whatever the degree, is triumph,
achievement, immortality. If, further, we try to establish the
degree we shall go on to say that no one so inveterately literary
is among the great writers; literature has wound itself about him
like a veil, forbidding him the free use of his limbs; the phrase
comes to him before the emotion; but we must add that he is
nevertheless a born writer, a man who detests meals, servants,
ease, respectability or anything that gets between him and his art;
who has kept his freedom when most of his contemporaries have long
ago lost theirs; who is ashamed of nothing but of being ashamed;
who says whatever he has it in his mind to say, and has taught
himself an accent, a cadence, indeed a language, for saying it in
which, though they are not English, but Irish, will give him his
place among the lesser immortals of our tongue.</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>26. THE NOVELS OF E. M.
FORSTER</h2>

<p><b>I</b>
</p>

<p>There are many reasons which should prevent one from criticizing
the work of contemporaries. Besides the obvious
uneasiness&mdash;the fear of hurting feelings&mdash;there is too
the difficulty of being just. Coming out one by one, their books
seem like parts of a design which is slowly uncovered. Our
appreciation may be intense, but our curiosity is even greater.
Does the new fragment add anything to what went before? Does it
carry out our theory of the author's talent, or must we alter our
forecast? Such questions ruffle what should be the smooth surface
of our criticism and make it full of argument and interrogation.
With a novelist like Mr. Forster this is specially true, for he is
in any case an author about whom there is considerable
disagreement. There is something baffling and evasive in the very
nature of his gifts. So, remembering that we are at best only
building up a theory which may be knocked down in a year or two by
Mr. Forster himself, let us take Mr. Forster's novels in the order
in which they were written, and tentatively and cautiously try to
make them yield us an answer.</p>

<p>The order in which they were written is indeed of some
importance, for at the outset we see that Mr. Forster is extremely
susceptible to the influence of time. He sees his people much at
the mercy of those conditions which change with the years. He is
acutely conscious of the bicycle and of the motor car; of the
public school and of the university; of the suburb and of the city.
The social historian will find his books full of illuminating
information. In 1905 Lilia learned to bicycle, coasted down the
High Street on Sunday evening, and fell off at the turn by the
church. For this she was given a talking to by her brother-in-law
which she remembered to her dying day. It is on Tuesday that the
housemaid cleans out the drawing-room at Sawston. Old maids blow
into their gloves when they take them off. Mr. Forster is a
novelist, that is to say, who sees his people in close contact with
their surroundings. And therefore the colour and constitution of
the year 1905 affect him far more than any year in the calendar
could affect the romantic Meredith or the poetic Hardy. But we
discover as we turn the page that observation is not an end in
itself; it is rather the goad, the gadfly driving Mr. Forster to
provide a refuge from this misery, an escape from this meanness.
Hence we arrive at that balance of forces which plays so large a
part in the structure of Mr. Forster's novels. Sawston implies
Italy; timidity, wildness; convention, freedom; unreality, reality.
These are the villains and heroes of much of his writing. In
<i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i> the disease, convention, and the
remedy, nature, are provided if anything with too eager a
simplicity, too simple an assurance, but with what a freshness,
what a charm! Indeed it would not be excessive if we discovered in
this slight first novel evidence of powers which only needed, one
might hazard, a more generous diet to ripen into wealth and beauty.
Twenty-two years might well have taken the sting from the satire
and shifted the proportions of the whole. But, if that is to some
extent true, the years have had no power to obliterate the fact
that, though Mr. Forster may be sensitive to the bicycle and the
duster, he is also the most persistent devotee of the soul. Beneath
bicycles and dusters, Sawston and Italy, Philip, Harriet, and Miss
Abbott, there always lies for him&mdash;it is this which makes him
so tolerant a satirist&mdash;a burning core. It is the soul; it is
reality; it is truth; it is poetry; it is love; it decks itself in
many shapes, dresses itself in many disguises. But get at it he
must; keep from it he cannot. Over brakes and byres, over
drawing-room carpets and mahogany sideboards, he flies in pursuit.
Naturally the spectacle is sometimes comic, often fatiguing; but
there are moments&mdash;and his first novel provides several
instances&mdash;when he lays his hands on the prize.</p>

<p>Yet, if we ask ourselves upon which occasions this happens and
how, it will seem that those passages which are least didactic,
least conscious of the pursuit of beauty, succeed best in achieving
it. When he allows himself a holiday&mdash;some phrase like that
comes to our lips; when he forgets the vision and frolics and
sports with the fact; when, having planted the apostles of culture
in their hotel, he creates airily, joyfully, spontaneously, Gino
the dentist's son sitting in the cafe with his friends, or
describes&mdash;it is a masterpiece of comedy&mdash;the performance
of <i>Lucia Di Lammermoor</i>, it is then that we feel that his aim
is achieved. Judging, therefore, on the evidence of this first
book, with its fantasy, its penetration, its remarkable sense of
design, we should have said that once Mr. Forster had acquired
freedom, had passed beyond the boundaries of Sawston, he would
stand firmly on his feet among the descendants of Jane Austen and
Peacock. But the second novel, <i>The Longest Journey</i>, leaves
us baffled and puzzled. The opposition is still the same: truth and
untruth; Cambridge and Sawston; sincerity and sophistication. But
everything is accentuated. He builds his Sawston of thicker bricks
and destroys it with stronger blasts. The contrast between poetry
and realism is much more precipitous. And now we see much more
clearly to what a task his gifts commit him. We see that what might
have been a passing mood is in truth a conviction. He believes that
a novel must take sides in the human conflict. He sees
beauty&mdash;none more keenly; but beauty imprisoned in a fortress
of brick and mortar whence he must extricate her. Hence he is
always constrained to build the cage&mdash;society in all its
intricacy and triviality&mdash;before he can free the prisoner. The
omnibus, the villa, the suburban residence, are an essential part
of his design. They are required to imprison and impede the flying
flame which is so remorselessly caged behind them. At the same
time, as we read <i>The Longest Journey</i> we are aware of a
mocking spirit of fantasy which flouts his seriousness. No one
seizes more deftly the shades and shadows of the social comedy; no
one more amusingly hits off the comedy of luncheon and tea party
and a game of tennis at the rectory. His old maids, his clergy, are
the most lifelike we have had since Jane Austen laid down the pen.
But he has into the bargain what Jane Austen had not&mdash;the
impulses of a poet. The neat surface is always being thrown into
disarray by an outburst of lyric poetry. Again and again in <i>The
Longest Journey</i> we are delighted by some exquisite description
of the country; or some lovely sight&mdash;like that when Rickie
and Stephen send the paper boats burning through the arch&mdash;is
made visible to us forever. Here, then, is a difficult family of
gifts to persuade to live in harmony together: satire and sympathy;
fantasy and fact; poetry and a prim moral sense. No wonder that we
are often aware of contrary currents that run counter to each other
and prevent the book from bearing down upon us and overwhelming us
with the authority of a masterpiece. Yet if there is one gift more
essential to a novelist than another it is the power of
combination&mdash;the single vision. The success of the
masterpieces seems to lie not so much in their freedom from
faults&mdash;indeed we tolerate the grossest errors in them
all&mdash;but in the immense persuasiveness of a mind which has
completely mastered its perspective.</p>

<p><b>II</b>
</p>

<p>We look then, as time goes on, for signs that Mr. Forster is
committing himself; that he is allying himself to one of the two
great camps to which most novelists belong. Speaking roughly, we
may divide them into the preachers and the teachers, headed by
Tolstoy and Dickens, on the one hand, and the pure artists, headed
by Jane Austen and Turgenev, on the other. Mr. Forster, it seems,
has a strong impulse to belong to both camps at once. He has many
of the instincts and aptitudes of the pure artist (to adopt the old
classification)&mdash;an exquisite prose style, an acute sense of
comedy, a power of creating characters in a few strokes which live
in an atmosphere of their own; but he is at the same time highly
conscious of a message. Behind the rainbow of wit and sensibility
there is a vision which he is determined that we shall see. But his
vision is of a peculiar kind and his message of an elusive nature.
He has not great interest in institutions. He has none of that wide
social curiosity which marks the work of Mr. Wells. The divorce law
and the poor law come in for little of his attention. His concern
is with the private life; his message is addressed to the soul. "It
is the private life that holds out the mirror to infinity; personal
intercourse, and that alone, that ever hints at a personality
beyond our daily vision." Our business is not to build in brick and
mortar, but to draw together the seen and the unseen. We must learn
to build the "rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us
with the passion. Without it we are meaningless fragments, half
monks, half beasts." This belief that it is the private life that
matters, that it is the soul that is eternal, runs through all his
writing. It is the conflict between Sawston and Italy in <i>Where
Angels Fear to Tread</i>; between Rickie and Agnes in <i>The
Longest Journey</i>; between Lucy and Cecil in <i>A Room With a
View</i>. It deepens, it becomes more insistent as time passes. It
forces him on from the lighter and more whimsical short novels past
that curious interlude, <i>The Celestial Omnibus</i>, to the two
large books, <i>Howards End</i> and <i>A Passage To India</i>,
which mark his prime.</p>

<p>But before we consider those two books let us look for a moment
at the nature of the problem he sets himself. It is the soul that
matters; and the soul, as we have seen, is caged in a solid villa
of red brick somewhere in the suburbs of London. It seems, then,
that if his books are to succeed in their mission his reality must
at certain points become irradiated; his brick must be lit up; we
must see the whole building saturated with light. We have at once
to believe in the complete reality of the suburb and in the
complete reality of the soul. In this combination of realism and
mysticism his closest affinity is, perhaps, with Ibsen. Ibsen has
the same realistic power. A room is to him a room, a writing table
a writing table, and a waste-paper basket a waste-paper basket. At
the same time, the paraphernalia of reality have at certain moments
to become the veil through which we see infinity. When Ibsen
achieves this, as he certainly does, it is not by performing some
miraculous conjuring trick at the critical moment. He achieves it
by putting us into the right mood from the very start and by giving
us the right materials for his purpose. He gives us the effect of
ordinary life, as Mr. Forster does, but he gives it us by choosing
a very few facts and those of a highly relevant kind. Thus when the
moment of illumination comes we accept it implicitly. We are
neither roused nor puzzled; we do not have to ask ourselves, What
does this mean? We feel simply that the thing we are looking at is
lit up, and its depths revealed. It has not ceased to be itself by
becoming something else.</p>

<p>Something of the same problem lies before Mr. Forster&mdash;how
to connect the actual thing with the meaning of the thing and to
carry the reader's mind across the chasm which divides the two
without spilling a single drop of its belief. At certain moments on
the Arno, in Hertfordshire, in Surrey, beauty leaps from the
scabbard, the fire of truth flames through the crusted earth; we
must see the red brick villa in the suburbs of London lit up. But
it is in these great scenes which are the justification of the huge
elaboration of the realistic novel that we are most aware of
failure. For it is here that Mr. Forster makes the change from
realism to symbolism; here that the object which has been so
uncompromisingly solid becomes, or should become, luminously
transparent. He fails, one is tempted to think, chiefly because
that admirable gift of his for observation has served him too well.
He has recorded too much and too literally. He has given us an
almost photographic picture on one side of the page; on the other
he asks us to see the same view transformed and radiant with
eternal fires. The bookcase which falls upon Leonard Bast in
<i>Howards End</i> should perhaps come down upon him with all the
dead weight of smoke-dried culture; the Marabar caves should appear
to us not real caves but, it may be, the soul of India. Miss
Quested should be transformed from an English girl on a picnic to
arrogant Europe straying into the heart of the East and getting
lost there. We qualify these statements, for indeed we are not
quite sure whether we have guessed aright. Instead of getting that
sense of instant certainty which we get in <i>The Wild Duck</i> or
in <i>The Master Builder</i>, we are puzzled, worried. What does
this mean? we ask ourselves. What ought we to understand by this?
And the hesitation is fatal. For we doubt both things&mdash;the
real and the symbolical: Mrs. Moore, the nice old lady, and Mrs.
Moore, the sibyl. The conjunction of these two different realities
seems to cast doubt upon them both. Hence it is that there is so
often an ambiguity at the heart of Mr. Forster's novels. We feel
that something has failed us at the critical moment; and instead of
seeing, as we do in <i>The Master Builder</i>, one single whole we
see two separate parts.</p>

<p>The stories collected under the title of <i>The Celestial
Omnibus</i> represent, it may be, an attempt on Mr. Forster's part
to simplify the problem which so often troubles him of connecting
the prose and poetry of life. Here he admits definitely if
discreetly the possibility of magic. Omnibuses drive to Heaven; Pan
is heard in the brushwood; girls turn into trees. The stories are
extremely charming. They release the fantasticality which is laid
under such heavy burdens in the novels. But the vein of fantasy is
not deep enough or strong enough to fight single-handed against
those other impulses which are part of his endowment. We feel that
he is an uneasy truant in fairyland. Behind the hedge he always
hears the motor horn and the shuffling feet of tired wayfarers, and
soon he must return. One slim volume indeed contains all that he
has allowed himself of pure fantasy. We pass from the freakish land
where boys leap into the arms of Pan and girls become trees to the
two Miss Schlegels, who have an income of six hundred pounds apiece
and live in Wickham Place.</p>

<p><b>III</b>
</p>

<p>Much though we may regret the change, we cannot doubt that it
was right. For none of the books before <i>Howards End</i> and <i>A
Passage to India</i> altogether drew upon the full range of Mr.
Forster's powers. With his queer and in some ways contradictory
assortment of gifts, he needed, it seemed, some subject which would
stimulate his highly sensitive and active intelligence, but would
not demand the extremes of romance or passion; a subject which gave
him material for criticism, and invited investigation; a subject
which asked to be built up of an enormous number of slight yet
precise observations, capable of being tested by an extremely
honest yet sympathetic mind; yet, with all this, a subject which
when finally constructed would show up against the torrents of the
sunset and the eternities of night with a symbolical significance.
In <i>Howards End</i> the lower middle, the middle, the upper
middle classes of English society are so built up into a complete
fabric. It is an attempt on a larger scale than hitherto, and, if
it fails, the size of the attempt is largely responsible. Indeed,
as we think back over the many pages of this elaborate and highly
skilful book, with its immense technical accomplishment, and also
its penetration, its wisdom and its beauty, we may wonder in what
mood of the moment we can have been prompted to call it a failure.
By all the rules, still more by the keen interest with which we
have read it from start to finish, we should have said success. The
reason is suggested perhaps by the manner of one's praise.
Elaboration, skill, wisdom, penetration, beauty&mdash;they are all
there, but they lack fusion; they lack cohesion; the book as a
whole lacks force. Schlegels, Wilcoxes, and Basts, with all that
they stand for of class and environment, emerge with extraordinary
verisimilitude, but the whole effect is less satisfying than that
of the much slighter but beautifully harmonious <i>Where Angels
Fear to Tread</i>. Again we have the sense that there is some
perversity in Mr. Forster's endowment so that his gifts in their
variety and number tend to trip each other up. If he were less
scrupulous, less just, less sensitively aware of the different
aspects of every case, he could, we feel, come down with greater
force on one precise point. As it is, the strength of his blow is
dissipated. He is like a light sleeper who is always being woken by
something in the room. The poet is twitched away by the satirist;
the comedian is tapped on the shoulder by the moralist; he never
loses himself or forgets himself for long in sheer delight in the
beauty or the interest of things as they are. For this reason the
lyrical passages in his books, often of great beauty in themselves,
fail of their due effect in the context. Instead of flowering
naturally&mdash;as in Proust, for instance&mdash;from an overflow
of interest and beauty in the object itself, we feel that they have
been called into existence by some irritation, are the effort of a
mind outraged by ugliness to supplement it with a beauty which,
because it originates in protest, has something a little febrile
about it.</p>

<p>Yet in <i>Howards End</i> there are, one feels, in solution all
the qualities that are needed to make a masterpiece. The characters
are extremely real to us. The ordering of the story is masterly.
That indefinable but highly important thing, the atmosphere of the
book, is alight with intelligence; not a speck of humbug, not an
atom of falsity is allowed to settle. And again, but on a larger
battlefield, the struggle goes forward which takes place in all Mr.
Forster's novels&mdash;the struggle between the things that matter
and the things that do not matter, between reality and sham,
between the truth and the lie. Again the comedy is exquisite and
the observation faultless. But again, just as we are yielding
ourselves to the pleasures of the imagination, a little jerk rouses
us. We are tapped on the shoulder. We are to notice this, to take
heed of that. Margaret or Helen, we are made to understand, is not
speaking simply as herself; her words have another and a larger
intention. So, exerting ourselves to find out the meaning, we step
from the enchanted world of imagination, where our faculties work
freely, to the twilight world of theory, where only our intellect
functions dutifully. Such moments of disillusionment have the habit
of coming when Mr. Forster is most in earnest, at the crisis of the
book, where the sword falls or the bookcase drops. They bring, as
we have noted already, a curious insubstantiality into the "great
scenes" and the important figures. But they absent themselves
entirely from the comedy. They make us wish, foolishly enough, to
dispose Mr. Forster's gifts differently and to restrict him to
write comedy only. For directly he ceases to feel responsible for
his characters' behaviour, and forgets that he should solve the
problem of the universe, he is the most diverting of novelists. The
admirable Tibby and the exquisite Mrs. Munt in <i>Howards End</i>,
though thrown in largely to amuse us, bring a breath of fresh air
in with them. They inspire us with the intoxicating belief that
they are free to wander as far from their creator as they choose.
Margaret, Helen, Leonard Bast, are closely tethered and vigilantly
overlooked lest they may take matters into their own hands and
upset the theory. But Tibby and Mrs. Munt go where they like, say
what they like, do what they like. The lesser characters and the
unimportant scenes in Mr. Forster's novels thus often remain more
vivid than those with which, apparently, most pain has been taken.
But it would be unjust to part from this big, serious, and highly
interesting book without recognizing that it is an important if
unsatisfactory piece of work which may well be the prelude to
something as large but less anxious.</p>

<p><b>IV</b>
</p>

<p>Many years passed before <i>A Passage to India</i> appeared.
Those who hoped that in the interval Mr. Forster might have
developed his technique so that it yielded rather more easily to
the impress of his whimsical mind and gave freer outlet to the
poetry and fantasy which play about in him were disappointed. The
attitude is precisely the same four-square attitude which walks up
to life as if it were a house with a front door, puts its hat on
the table in the hall and proceeds to visit all the rooms in an
orderly manner. The house is still the house of the British middle
classes. But there is a change from <i>Howards End</i>. Hitherto
Mr. Forster has been apt to pervade his books like a careful
hostess who is anxious to introduce, to explain, to warn her guests
of a step here, of a draught there. But here, perhaps in some
disillusionment both with his guests and with his house, he seems
to have relaxed these cares. We are allowed to ramble over this
extraordinary continent almost alone. We notice things, about the
country especially, spontaneously, accidentally almost, as if we
were actually there; and now it was the sparrows flying about the
pictures that caught our eyes, now the elephant with the painted
forehead, now the enormous but badly designed ranges of hills. The
people too, particularly the Indians, have something of the same
casual, inevitable quality. They are not perhaps quite so important
as the land, but they are alive; they are sensitive. No longer do
we feel, as we used to feel in England, that they will be allowed
to go only so far and no further lest they may upset some theory of
the author's. Aziz is a free agent. He is the most imaginative
character that Mr. Forster has yet created, and recalls Gino the
dentist in his first book, <i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i>. We
may guess indeed that it has helped Mr. Forster to have put the
ocean between him and Sawston. It is a relief, for a time, to be
beyond the influence of Cambridge. Though it is still a necessity
for him to build a model world which he can submit to delicate and
precise criticism, the model is on a larger scale. The English
society, with all its pettiness and its vulgarity and its streak of
heroism, is set against a bigger and a more sinister background.
And though it is still true that there are ambiguities in important
places, moments of imperfect symbolism, a greater accumulation of
facts than the imagination is able to deal with, it seems as if the
double vision which troubled us in the earlier books was in process
of becoming single. The saturation is much more thorough. Mr.
Forster has almost achieved the great feat of animating this dense,
compact body of observation with a spiritual light. The book shows
signs of fatigue and disillusionment; but it has chapters of clear
and triumphant beauty, and above all it makes us wonder, What will
he write next?</p>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>27. MIDDLEBROW</h2>

<p class="cpb">(This letter was written, but not sent to The New
Statesman.)</p>

<p>To THE EDITOR OF THE "NEW STATESMAN"</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Will you allow me to draw your attention to the fact that in a
review of a book by me (October ) your reviewer omitted to use the
word Highbrow? The review, save for that omission, gave me so much
pleasure that I am driven to ask you, at the risk of appearing
unduly egotistical, whether your reviewer, a man of obvious
intelligence, intended to deny my claim to that title? I say
"claim," for surely I may claim that title when a great critic, who
is also a great novelist, a rare and enviable combination, always
calls me a highbrow when he condescends to notice my work in a
great newspaper; and, further, always finds space to inform not
only myself, who know it already, but the whole British Empire, who
hang on his words, that I live in Bloomsbury? Is your critic
unaware of that fact too? Or does he, for all his intelligence,
maintain that it is unnecessary in reviewing a book to add the
postal address of the writer?</p>

<p>His answer to these questions, though of real value to me, is of
no possible interest to the public at large. Of that I am well
aware. But since larger issues are involved, since the Battle of
the Brows troubles, I am told, the evening air, since the finest
minds of our age have lately been engaged in debating, not without
that passion which befits a noble cause, what a highbrow is and
what a lowbrow, which is better and which is worse, may I take this
opportunity to express my opinion and at the same time draw
attention to certain aspects of the question which seem to me to
have been unfortunately overlooked?</p>

<p>Now there can be no two opinions as to what a highbrow is. He is
the man or woman of thoroughbred intelligence who rides his mind at
a gallop across country in pursuit of an idea. That is why I have
always been so proud to be called highbrow. That is why, if I could
be more of a highbrow I would. I honour and respect highbrows. Some
of my relations have been highbrows; and some, but by no means all,
of my friends. To be a highbrow, a complete and representative
highbrow, a highbrow like Shakespeare, Dickens, Byron, Shelley,
Keats, Charlotte Brontë, Scott, Jane Austen, Flaubert, Hardy or
Henry James&mdash;to name a few highbrows from the same profession
chosen at random&mdash;is of course beyond the wildest dreams of my
imagination. And, though I would cheerfully lay myself down in the
dust and kiss the print of their feet, no person of sense will deny
that this passionate preoccupation of theirs&mdash;riding across
country in pursuit of ideas&mdash;often leads to disaster.
Undoubtedly, they come fearful croppers. Take Shelley&mdash;what a
mess he made of his life! And Byron, getting into bed with first
one woman and then with another and dying in the mud at
Missolonghi. Look at Keats, loving poetry and Fanny Brawne so
intemperately that he pined and died of consumption at the age of
twenty-six. Charlotte Brontë again&mdash;I have beep assured on
good authority that Charlotte Brontë was, with the possible
exception of Emily, the worst governess in the British Isles. Then
there was Scott&mdash;he went bankrupt, and left, together with a
few magnificent novels, one house, Abbotsford, which is perhaps the
ugliest in the whole Empire. But surely these instances are
enough&mdash;I need not further labour the point that highbrows,
for some reason or another, are wholly incapable of dealing
successfully with what is called real life. That is why, and here I
come to a point that is often surprisingly ignored, they honour so
wholeheartedly and depend so completely upon those who are called
lowbrows. By a lowbrow is meant of course a man or a woman of
thoroughbred vitality who rides his body in pursuit of a living at
a gallop across life. That is why I honour and respect
lowbrows&mdash;and I have never known a highbrow who did not. In so
far as I am a highbrow (and my imperfections in that line are well
known to me) I love lowbrows; I study them; I always sit next the
conductor in an omnibus and try to get him to tell me what it is
like&mdash;being a conductor. In whatever company I am I always try
to know what it is like&mdash;being a conductor, being a woman with
ten children and thirty-five shillings a week, being a stockbroker,
being an admiral, being a bank clerk, being a dressmaker, being a
duchess, being a miner, being a cook, being a prostitute. All that
lowbrows do is of surpassing interest and wonder to me, because, in
so far as I am a highbrow, I cannot do things myself.</p>

<p>This brings me to another point which is also surprisingly
overlooked. Lowbrows need highbrows and honour them just as much as
highbrows need lowbrows and honour them. This too is not a matter
that requires much demonstration. You have only to stroll along the
Strand on a wet winter's night and watch the crowds lining up to
get into the movies. These lowbrows are waiting, after the day's
work, in the rain, sometimes for hours, to get into the cheap seats
and sit in hot theatres in order to see what their lives look like.
Since they are lowbrows, engaged magnificently and adventurously in
riding full tilt from one end of life to the other in pursuit of a
living, they cannot see themselves doing it. Yet nothing interests
them more. Nothing matters to them more. It is one of the prime
necessities of life to them&mdash;to be shown what life looks like.
And the highbrows, of course, are the only people who can show
them. Since they are the only people who do not do things, they are
the only people who can see things being done. This is so&mdash;and
so it is I am certain; nevertheless we are told&mdash;the air
buzzes with it by night, the press booms with it by day, the very
donkeys in the fields do nothing but bray it, the very curs in the
streets do nothing but bark it&mdash;"Highbrows hate lowbrows!
Lowbrows hate highbrows!"&mdash;when highbrows need lowbrows, when
lowbrows need highbrows, when they cannot exist apart, when one is
the complement and other side of the other! How has such a lie come
into existence? Who has set this malicious gossip afloat?</p>

<p>There can be no doubt about that either. It is the doing of the
middlebrows. They are the people, I confess, that I seldom regard
with entire cordiality. They are the go-betweens; they are the
busy-bodies who run from one to the other with their tittle tattle
and make all the mischief&mdash;the middlebrows, I repeat. But
what, you may ask, is a middlebrow? And that, to tell the truth, is
no easy question to answer. They are neither one thing nor the
other. They are not highbrows, whose brows are high; nor lowbrows,
whose brows are low. Their brows are betwixt and between. They do
not live in Bloomsbury which is on high ground; nor in Chelsea,
which is on low ground. Since they must live somewhere presumably,
they live perhaps in South Kensington, which is betwixt and
between. The middlebrow is the man, or woman, of middlebred
intelligence who ambles and saunters now on this side of the hedge,
now on that, in pursuit of no single object, neither art itself nor
life itself, but both mixed indistinguishably, and rather nastily,
with money, fame, power, or prestige. The middlebrow curries favour
with both sides equally. He goes to the lowbrows and tells them
that while he is not quite one of them, he is almost their friend.
Next moment he rings up the highbrows and asks them with equal
geniality whether he may not come to tea. Now there are
highbrows&mdash;I myself have known duchesses who were highbrows,
also charwomen, and they have both told me with that vigour of
language which so often unites the aristocracy with the working
classes, that they would rather sit in the coal cellar, together,
than in the drawing-room with middlebrows and pour out tea. I have
myself been asked&mdash;but may I, for the sake of brevity, cast
this scene which is only partly fictitious, into the form of
fiction?&mdash;I myself, then, have been asked to come and "see"
them&mdash;how strange a passion theirs is for being "seen"! They
ring me up, therefore, at about eleven in the morning, and ask me
to come to tea. I go to my wardrobe and consider, rather
lugubriously, what is the right thing to wear? We highbrows may be
smart, or we may be shabby; but we never have the right thing to
wear. I proceed to ask next: What is the right thing to say? Which
is the right knife to use? What is the right book to praise? All
these are things I do not know for myself. We highbrows read what
we like and do what we like and praise what we like. We also know
what we dislike&mdash;for example, thin bread and butter tea. The
difficulty of eating thin bread and butter in white kid gloves has
always seemed to me one of life's more insuperable problems. Then I
dislike bound volumes of the classics behind plate glass. Then I
distrust people who call both Shakespeare and Wordsworth equally
"Bill"&mdash;it is a habit moreover that leads to confusion. And in
the matter of clothes, I like people either to dress very well; or
to dress very badly; I dislike the correct thing in clothes. Then
there is the question of games. Being a highbrow I do not play
them. But I love watching people play who have a passion for games.
These middlebrows pat balls about; they poke their bats and muff
their catches at cricket. And when poor Middlebrow mounts on
horseback and that animal breaks into a canter, to me there is no
sadder sight in all Rotten Row. To put it in a nutshell (in order
to get on with the story) that tea party was not wholly a success,
nor altogether a failure; for Middlebrow, who writes, following me
to the door, clapped me briskly on the back, and said "I'm sending
you my book!" (Or did he call it "stuff?") And his book
comes&mdash;sure enough, though called, so symbolically,
<i>Keepaway</i>, [Keepaway is the name of a preparation used to
distract the male dog from the female at certain seasons] it comes.
And I read a page here, and I read a page there (I am breakfasting,
as usual, in bed). And it is not well written; nor is it badly
written. It is not proper, nor is it improper&mdash;in short it is
betwixt and between. Now if there is any sort of book for which I
have, perhaps, an imperfect sympathy, it is the betwixt and
between. And so, though I suffer from the gout of a
morning&mdash;but if one's ancestors for two or three centuries
have tumbled into bed dead drunk one has deserved a touch of that
malady&mdash;I rise. I dress. I proceed weakly to the window. I
take that book in my swollen right hand and toss it gently over the
hedge into the field. The hungry sheep&mdash;did I remember to say
that this part of the story takes place in the country?&mdash;the
hungry sheep look up but are not fed.</p>

<p>But to have done with fiction and its tendency to lapse into
poetry&mdash;I will now report a perfectly prosaic conversation in
words of one syllable. I often ask my friends the lowbrows, over
our muffins and honey, why it is that while we, the highbrows,
never buy a middlebrow book, or go to a middlebrow lecture, or
read, unless we are paid for doing so, a middlebrow review, they,
on the contrary, take these middlebrow activities so seriously?
Why, I ask (not of course on the wireless), are you so damnably
modest? Do you think that a description of your lives, as they are,
is too sordid and too mean to be beautiful? Is that why you prefer
the middlebrow version of what they have the impudence to call real
humanity?&mdash;this mixture of geniality and sentiment stuck
together with a sticky slime of calves-foot jelly? The truth, if
you would only believe it, is much more beautiful than any lie.
Then again, I continue, how can you let the middlebrows teach you
how to write?&mdash;you, who write so beautifully when you write
naturally, that I would give both my hands to write as you
do&mdash;for which reason I never attempt it, but do my best to
learn the art of writing as a highbrow should. And again, I press
on, brandishing a muffin on the point of a tea spoon, how dare the
middlebrows teach you how to read&mdash;Shakespeare for instance?
All you have to do is to read him. The Cambridge edition is both
good and cheap. If you find <i>Hamlet</i> difficult, ask him to
tea. He is a highbrow. Ask Ophelia to meet him. She is a lowbrow.
Talk to them, as you talk to me, and you will know more about
Shakespeare than all the middlebrows in the world can teach
you&mdash;I do not think, by the way, from certain phrases that
Shakespeare liked middlebrows, or Pope either.</p>

<p>To all this the lowbrows reply&mdash;but I cannot imitate their
style of talking&mdash;that they consider themselves to be common
people without education. It is very kind of the middlebrows to try
to teach them culture. And after all, the lowbrows continue,
middlebrows, like other people, have to make money. There must be
money in teaching and in writing books about Shakespeare. We all
have to earn our livings nowadays, my friends the lowbrows remind
me. I quite agree. Even those of us whose Aunts came a cropper
riding in India and left them an annual income of four hundred and
rfifty pounds, now reduced, thanks to the war and other luxuries,
to little more than two hundred odd, even we have to do that. And
we do it, too, by writing about anybody who seems
amusing&mdash;enough has been written about
Shakespeare&mdash;Shakespeare hardly pays. We highbrows, I agree,
have to earn our livings; but when we have earned enough to live
on, then we live. When the middlebrows, on the contrary, have
earned enough to live on, they go on earning enough to
buy&mdash;what are the things that middlebrows always buy? Queen
Anne furniture (faked, but none the less expensive); first editions
of dead writers, always the worst; pictures, or reproductions from
pictures, by dead painters; houses in what is called "the Georgian
style"&mdash;but never anything new, never a picture by a living
painter, or a chair by a living carpenter, or books by living
writers, for to buy living art requires living taste. And, as that
kind of art and that kind of taste are what middlebrows call
"highbrow," "Bloomsbury," poor middlebrow spends vast sums on sham
antiques, and has to keep at it scribbling away, year in, year out,
while we highbrows ring each other up, and are off for a day's
jaunt into the country. That is the worst of course of living in a
set&mdash;one likes being with one's friends.</p>

<p>Have I then made my point clear, sir, that the true battle in my
opinion lies not between highbrow and lowbrow, but between
highbrows and lowbrows joined together in blood brotherhood against
the bloodless and pernicious pest who comes between? If the B.B.C.
stood for anything but the Betwixt and Between Company they would
use their control of the air not to stir strife between brothers,
but to broadcast the fact that highbrows and lowbrows must band
together to exterminate a pest which is the bane of all thinking
and living. It may be, to quote from your advertisement columns,
that "terrifically sensitive" lady novelists overestimate the
dampness and dinginess of this fungoid growth. But all I can say is
that when, lapsing into that stream which people call, so oddly,
consciousness, and gathering wool from the sheep that have been
mentioned above, I ramble round my garden in the suburbs,
middlebrow seems to me to be everywhere. "What's that?" I cry.
"Middlebrow on the cabbages? Middlebrow infecting that poor old
sheep? And what about the moon?" I look up and, behold, the moon is
under eclipse. "Middlebrow at it again!" I exclaim. "Middlebrow
obscuring, dulling, tarnishing and coarsening even the silver edge
of Heaven's own scythe." (I "draw near to poetry," see advt.) And
then my thoughts, as Freud assures us thoughts will do, rush
(Middlebrow's saunter and simper, out of respect for the Censor) to
sex, and I ask of the sea-gulls who are crying on desolate sea
sands and of the farm hands who are coming home rather drunk to
their wives, what will become of us, men and women, if Middlwbrow
has his way with us, and there is only a middle sex but no husbands
or wives? The next remark I address with the utmost humility to the
Prime Minister. "What, sir," I demand, "will be the fate of the
British Empire and of our Dominions Across the Seas if Middlebrows
prevail? Will you not, sir, read a pronouncement of an
authoritative nature from Broadcasting House?"</p>

<p>Such are the thoughts, such are the fancies that visit "cultured
invalidish ladies with private means" (see advt.) when they stroll
in their suburban gardens and look at the cabbages and at the red
brick villas that have been built by middlebrows so that
middlebrows may look at the view. Such are the thoughts "at once
gay and tragic and deeply feminine" (see advt.) of one who has not
yet "been driven out of Bloomsbury" (advt. again), a place where
lowbrows and highbrows live happily together on equal terms and
priests are not, nor priestesses, and, to be quite frank, the
adjective "priestly" is neither often heard nor held in high
esteem. Such are the thoughts of one who will stay in Bloomsbury
until the Duke of Bedford, rightly concerned for the respectability
of his squares, raises the rent so high that Bloomsbury is safe for
middlebrows to live in. Then she will leave.</p>

<p>May I conclude, as I began, by thanking your reviewer for his
very courteous and interesting review, but may I tell him that
though he did not, for reasons best known to himself, call me a
highbrow, there is no name in the world that I prefer? I ask
nothing better than that all reviewers, for ever, and everywhere,
should call me a highbrow. I will do my best to oblige them. If
they like to add Bloomsbury, W.C.1, that is the correct postal
address, and my telephone number is in the Directory. But if your
reviewer, or any other reviewer, dares hint that I live in South
Kensington, I will sue him for libel. If any human being, man,
woman, dog, cat or half-crushed worm dares call me "middlebrow" I
will take my pen and stab him, dead. Yours etc.,</p>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>28. THE ART OF BIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p><b>I</b>
</p>

<p>The art of biography, we say&mdash;-but at once go on to ask, is
biography an art? The question is foolish perhaps, and ungenerous
certainly, considering the keen pleasure that biographers have
given us. But the question asks itself so often that there must be
something behind it. There it is, whenever a new biography is
opened, casting its shadow on the page; and there would seem to be
something deadly in that shadow, for after all, of the multitude of
lives that are written, how few survive!</p>

<p>But the reason for this high death rate, the biographer might
argue, is that biography, compared with the arts of poetry and
fiction, is a young art. Interest in our selves and in other
people's selves is a late development of the human mind. Not until
the eighteenth century in England did that curiosity express itself
in writing the lives of private people. Only in the nineteenth
century was biography fully grown and hugely prolific. If it is
true that there have been only three great
biographers&mdash;Johnson, Boswell, and Lockhart&mdash;the reason,
he argues, is that the time was short; and his plea, that the art
of biography has had but little time to establish itself and
develop itself, is certainly borne out by the textbooks. Tempting
as it is to explore the reason&mdash;why, that is, the self that
writes a book of prose came into being so many centuries after the
self that writes a poem, why Chaucer preceded Henry James&mdash;it
is better to leave that insoluble question unasked, and so pass to
his next reason for the lack of masterpieces. It is that the art of
biography is the most restricted of all the arts. He has his proof
ready to hand. Here it is in the preface in which Smith, who has
written the life of Jones, takes this opportunity of thanking old
friends who have lent letters, and "last but not least" Mrs. Jones,
the widow, for that help "without which," as he puts it, "this
biography could not have been written." Now the novelist, he points
out, simply says in his foreword, "Every character in this book is
fictitious." The novelist is free; the biographer is tied.</p>

<p>There, perhaps, we come within hailing distance of that very
difficult, again perhaps insoluble, question: What do we mean by
calling a book a work of art? At any rate, here is a distinction
between biography and fiction&mdash;a proof that they differ in the
very stuff of which they are made. One is made with the help of
friends, of facts; the other is created without any restrictions
save those that the artist, for reasons that seem good to him,
chooses to obey. That is a distinction; and there is good reason to
think that in the past biographers have found it not. only a
distinction but a very cruel distinction.</p>

<p>The widow and the friends were hard taskmasters. Suppose, for
example, that the man of genius was immoral, ill-tempered, and
threw the boots at the maid's head. The widow would say, "Still I
loved him&mdash;he was the father of my children; and the public,
who love his books, must on no account be disillusioned. Cover up;
omit." The biographer obeyed. And thus the majority of Victorian
biographies are like the wax figures now preserved in Westminster
Abbey, that were carried in funeral processions through the
street&mdash;effigies that have only a smooth superficial likeness
to the body in the coffin.</p>

<p>Then, towards the end of the nineteenth century, there was a
change. Again for reasons not easy to discover, widows became
broader-minded, the public keener-sighted; the effigy no longer
carried conviction or satisfied curiosity. The biographer certainly
won a measure of freedom. At least he could hint that there were
scars and furrows on the dead man's face. Froude's Carlyle is by no
means a wax mask painted rosy red. And following Froude there was
Sir Edmund Gosse, who dared to say that his own father was a
fallible human being. And following Edmund Gosse in the early years
of the present century came Lytton Strachey.</p>

<p><b>II</b>
</p>

<p>The figure of Lytton Strachey is so important a figure in the
history of biography, that it compels a pause. For his three famous
books, <i>Eminent Victorians</i>, <i>Queen Victoria</i>, and
<i>Elizabeth and Essex</i>, are of a stature to show both what
biography can do and what biography cannot do. Thus they suggest
many possible answers to the question whether biography is an art,
and if not why it fails. Lytton Strachey came to birth as an author
at a lucky moment. In 1918, when he made his first attempt,
biography, with its new liberties, was a form that offered great
attractions. To a writer like himself, who had wished to write
poetry or plays but was doubtful of his creative power, biography
seemed to offer a promising alternative. For at last it was
possible to tell the truth about the dead; and the Victorian age
was rich in remarkable figures many of whom had been grossly
deformed by the effigies that had been plastered over them. To
recreate them, to show them as they really were, was a task that
called for gifts analogous to the poet's or the novelist's, yet did
not ask that inventive power in which he found himself lacking.</p>

<p>It was well worth trying. And the anger and the interest that
his short studies of Eminent Victorians aroused showed that he was
able to make Manning, Florence Nightingale, Gordon, and the rest
live as they had not lived since they were actually in the flesh.
Once more they were the centre of a buzz of discussion. Did Gordon
really drink, or was that an invention? Had Florence Nightingale
received the Order of Merit in her bedroom or in her sitting room?
He stirred the public, even though a European war was raging, to an
astonishing interest in such minute matters. Anger and laughter
mixed; and editions multiplied.</p>

<p>But these were short studies with something of the over-emphasis
and the foreshortening of caricatures. In the lives of the two
great Queens, Elizabeth and Victoria, he attempted a far more
ambitious task. Biography had never had a fairer chance of showing
what it could do. For it was now being put to the test by a writer
who was capable of making use of all the liberties that biography
had won: he was fearless; he had proved his brilliance; and he had
learned his job. The result throws great light upon the nature of
biography. For who can doubt after reading the two books again, one
after the other, that the Victoria is a triumphant success, and
that the <i>Elizabeth</i> by comparison is a failure? But it seems
too, as we compare them, that it was not Lytton Strachey who
failed; it was the art of biography. In the <i>Victoria</i> he
treated biography as a craft; he submitted to its limitations. In
the <i>Elizabeth</i> he treated biography as an art; he flouted its
limitations.</p>

<p>But we must go on to ask how we have come to this conclusion and
what reasons support it. In the first place it is clear that the
two Queens present very different problems to their biographer.
About Queen Victoria everything was known. Everything she did,
almost everything she thought, was a matter of common knowledge. No
one has ever been more closely verified and exactly authenticated
than Queen Victoria. The biographer could not invent her, because
at every moment some document was at hand to check his invention.
And, in writing of Victoria, Lytton Strachey submitted to the
conditions. He used to the full the biographer's power of selection
and relation, but he kept strictly within the world of fact. Every
statement was verified; every fact was authenticated. And the
result is a life which, very possibly, will do for the old Queen
what Boswell did for the old dictionary maker. In time to come
Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria will be Queen Victoria, just as
Boswell's Johnson is now Dr. Johnson. The other versions will fade
and disappear. It was a prodigious feat, and no doubt, having
accomplished it, the author was anxious to press further. There was
Queen Victoria, solid, real, palpable. But undoubtedly she was
limited. Could not biography produce something of the intensity of
poetry, something of the excitement of drama, and yet keep also the
peculiar virtue that belongs to fact&mdash;its suggestive reality,
its own proper creativeness?</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth seemed to lend herself perfectly to the
experiment. Very little was known about her. The society in which
she lived was so remote that the habits, the motives, and even the
actions of the people&mdash;of that age were full of strangeness
and obscurity. "By what art are we to worm our way into those
strange spirits? those even stranger bodies? The more clearly we
perceive it, the more remote that singular universe becomes,"
Lytton Strachey remarked on one of the first pages. Yet there was
evidently a "tragic history" lying dormant, half revealed, half
concealed, in the story of the Queen and Essex. Everything seemed
to lend itself to the making of a book that combined the advantages
of both worlds, that gave the artist freedom to invent, but helped
his invention with the support of facts&mdash;a book that was not
only a biography but also a work of art.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the combination proved unworkable; fact and
fiction refused to mix. Elizabeth never became real in the sense
that Queen Victoria had been real, yet she never became fictitious
in the sense that Cleopatra or Falstaff is fictitious. The reason
would seem to be that very little was known&mdash;he was urged to
invent; yet something was known&mdash;his invention was checked.
The Queen thus moves in an ambiguous world, between fact and
fiction, neither embodied nor disembodied. There is a sense of
vacancy and effort, of a tragedy that has no crisis, of characters
that meet but do not clash.</p>

<p>If this diagnosis is true we are forced to say that the trouble
lies with biography itself. It imposes conditions, and those
conditions are that it must be based upon fact. And by fact in
biography we mean facts that can be verified by other people
besides the artist. If he invents facts as an artist invents
them&mdash;facts that no one else can verify&mdash;and tries to
combine them with facts of the other sort, they destroy each
other.</p>

<p>Lytton Strachey himself seems in the <i>Queen Victoria</i> to
have realized the necessity of this condition, and to have yielded
to it instinctively. "The first forty-two years of the Queen's
life," he wrote, "are illuminated by a great and varied quantity of
authentic information. With Albert's death a veil descends." And
when with Albert's death the veil descended and authentic
information failed, he knew that the biographer must follow suit.
"We must be content with a brief and summary relation," he wrote;
and the last years are briefly disposed of. But the whole of
Elizabeth's life was lived behind a far thicker veil than the last
years of Victoria. And yet, ignoring his own admission, he went on
to write, not a brief and summary relation, but a whole book about
those strange spirits and even stranger bodies of whom authentic
information was lacking. On his own showing, the attempt was doomed
to failure.</p>

<p><b>III</b>
</p>

<p>It seems, then, that when the biographer complained that he was
tied by friends, letters, and documents he was laying his finger
upon a necessary element in biography; and that it is also a
necessary limitation. For the invented character lives in a free
world where the facts are verified by one person only&mdash;the
artist himself. Their authenticity lies in the truth of his own
vision. The world created by that vision is rarer, intenser, and
more wholly of a piece than the world that is largely made of
authentic information supplied by other people. And because of this
difference the two kinds of fact will not mix; if they touch they
destroy each other. No one, the conclusion seems to be, can make
the best of both worlds; you must choose, and you must abide by
your choice.</p>

<p>But though the failure of <i>Elizabeth and Essex</i> leads to
this conclusion, that failure, because it was the result of a
daring experiment carried out with magnificent skill, leads the way
to further discoveries. Had he lived, Lytton Strachey would no
doubt himself have explored the vein that he had opened. As it is,
he has shown us the way in which others may advance. The biographer
is bound by facts&mdash;that is so; but, if it is so, he has the
right to all the facts that are available. If Jones threw boots at
the maid's head, had a mistress at Islington, or was found drunk in
a ditch after a night's debauch, he must be free to say so&mdash;so
far at least as the law of libel and human sentiment allow.</p>

<p>But these facts are not like the facts of science&mdash;once
they are discovered, always the same. They are subject to changes
of opinion; opinions change as the times change. What was thought a
sin is now known, by the light of facts won for us by the
psychologists, to be perhaps a misfortune; perhaps a curiosity;
perhaps neither one nor the other, but a trifling foible of no
great importance one way or the other. The accent on sex has
changed within living memory. This leads to the destruction of a
great deal of dead matter still obscuring the true features of the
human face. Many of the old chapter headings&mdash;life at college,
marriage, career&mdash;are shown to be very arbitrary and
artificial distinctions. The real current of the hero's existence
took, very likely, a different course.</p>

<p>Thus the biographer must go ahead of the rest of us, like the
miner's canary, testing the atmosphere, detecting falsity,
unreality, and the presence of obsolete conventions. His sense of
truth must he alive and on tiptoe. Then again, since we live in an
age when a thousand cameras are pointed, by newspapers, letters,
and diaries, at every character from every angle, he must be
prepared to admit contradictory versions of the same face.
Biography will enlarge its scope by hanging up looking glasses at
odd corners. And yet from all this diversity it will bring out, not
a riot of confusion, but a richer unity. And again, since so much
is known that used to be unknown, the question now inevitably asks
itself, whether the lives of great men only should be recorded. Is
not anyone who has lived a life, and left a record of that life,
worthy of biography&mdash;the failures as well as the successes,
the humble as well as the illustrious? And what is greatness? And
what smallness? We must revise our standards of merit and set up
new heroes for our admiration.</p>

<p><b>IV</b>
</p>

<p>Biography thus is only at the beginning of its career; it has a
long and active life before it, we may be sure&mdash;a life full of
difficulty, danger, and hard work. Nevertheless, we can also be
sure that it is a different life from the life of poetry and
fiction&mdash;a life lived at a lower degree of tension. And for
that reason its creations are not destined for the immortality
which the artist now and then achieves for his creations.</p>

<p>There would seem to be certain proof of that already. Even Dr.
Johnson as created by Boswell will not live as long as Falstaff as
created by Shakespeare. Micawber and Miss Bates we may be certain
will survive Lockhart's Sir Walter Scott and Lytton Strachey's
Queen Victoria. For they are made of more enduring matter. The
artist's imagination at its most intense fires out what is
perishable in fact; he builds with what is durable; but the
biographer must accept the perishable, build with it, imbed it in
the very fabric of his work. Much will perish; little will live.
And thus we come to the conclusion, that he is a craftsman, not an
artist; and his work is not a work of art, but something betwixt
and between.</p>

<p>Yet on that lower level the work of the blographer is
invaluable; we cannot thank him sufficiently for what he for us.
For we are incapable of living wholly in the intense world of the
imagination. The imagination is a faculty that soon tires and needs
rest and refreshment. But for a tired imagination the proper food
is not inferior poetry or minor fiction&mdash;indeed they blunt and
debauch it&mdash;but sober fact, that "authentic information" from
which, as Lytton Strachey has shown us, good biography is made.
When and where did the real man live; how did he look; did he wear
laced boots or elastic-sided; who were his aunts, and his friends;
how did he blow his nose whom did he love, and how; and when he
came to die did he die in his bed like a Christian, or...</p>

<p>By telling us the true facts, by sifting the little from the
big, and shaping the whole so that we perceive the outline, the
biographer does more to stimulate the imagination than any poet or
novelist save the very greatest. For few poets and novelists are
capable of that high degree of tension which gives us reality. But
almost any biographer, if he respects facts, can give us much more
than another fact to add to our collection. He can give us the
creative fact; the fertile fact; the fact that suggests and
engenders. Of this, too, there is certain proof. For how often,
when a biography is read and tossed aside, some scene remains
bright, some figure lives on in the depths of the mind, and causes
us, when we read a poem or a novel, to feel a start of recognition,
as if we remembered something that we had known before.</p>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>29. CRAFTSMANSHIP</h2>

<p class="cpb">(A broadcast on April 20th, 1937)</p>

<p>The title of this series is "Words Fail Me," and this particular
talk is called "Craftsmanship." We must suppose, therefore, that
the talker is meant to discuss the craft of words&mdash;the
craftsmanship of the writer. But there is something incongruous,
unfitting, about the term "craftsmanship" when applied to words.
The English dictionary, to which we always turn in moments of
dilemma, confirms us in our doubts. It says that the word "craft"
has two meanings; it means in the first place making useful objects
out of solid matter&mdash;for example, a pot, a chair, a table. In
the second place, the word "craft" means cajolery, cunning, deceit.
Now we know little that is certain about words, but this we do
know&mdash;words never make anything that is useful; and words are
the only things that tell the truth and nothing but the truth.
Therefore, to talk of craft in connection with words is to bring
together two incongruous ideas, which if they mate can only give
birth to some monster fit for a glass case in a museum. Instantly,
therefore, the title of the talk must be changed, and for it
substituted another&mdash;A Ramble round Words, perhaps. For when
you cut off the head of a talk it behaves like a hen that has been
decapitated. It runs round in a circle till it drops dead&mdash;so
people say who have killed hens. And that must be the course, or
circle, of this decapitated talk. Let us then take for our starting
point the statement that words are not useful. This happily needs
little proving, for we are all aware of it. When we travel on the
Tube, for example, when we wait on the platform for a train, there,
hung up in front of us, on an illuminated signboard, are the words
"Passing Russell Square." We look at those words; we repeat them;
we try to impress that useful fact upon our minds; the next train
will pass Russell Square. We say over and over again as we pace,
"Passing Russell Square, passing Russell Square." And then as we
say them, the words shuffle and change, and we find ourselves
saying, "Passing away saith the world, passing away...The leaves
decay and fall, the vapours weep their burthen to the ground. Man
comes..." And then we wake up and find ourselves at King's
Cross.</p>

<p>Take another example. Written up opposite us in the railway
carriage are the words: "Do not lean out of the window." At the
first reading the useful meaning, the surface meaning, is conveyed;
but soon, as we sit looking at the words, they shuffle, they
change; and we begin saying, "Windows, yes windows&mdash;casements
opening on the foam of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn." And
before we know what we are doing, we have leant out of the window;
we are looking for Ruth in tears amid the alien corn. The penalty
for that is twenty pounds or a broken neck.</p>

<p>This proves, if it needs proving, how very little natural gift
words have for being useful. If we insist on forcing them against
their nature to be useful, we see to our cost how they mislead us,
how they fool us, how they land us a crack on the head. We have
been so often fooled in this way by words, they have so often
proved that they hate being useful, that it is their nature not to
express one simple statement but a thousand
possibilities&mdash;they have done this so often that at last,
happily, we are beginning to face the fact. We are beginning to
invent another language &mdash;a language perfectly and beautifully
adapted to express useful statements, a language of signs. There is
one great living master of this language to whom we are all
indebted, that anonymous writer&mdash;whether man, woman or
disembodied spirit nobody knows&mdash;who describes hotels in the
Michelin Guide. He wants to tell us that one hotel is moderate,
another good, and a third the best in the place. How does he do it?
Not with words; words would at once bring into being shrubberies
and billiard tables, men and women, the moon rising and the long
splash of the summer sea&mdash;all good things, but all here beside
the point. He sticks to signs; one gable; two gables; three gables.
That is all he says and all he needs to say. Baedeker carries the
sign language still further into the sublime realms of art. When he
wishes to say that a picture is good, he uses one star; if very
good, two stars; when, in his opinion, it is a work of transcendent
genius, three black stars shine on the page, and that is all. So
with a handful of stars and daggers the whole of art criticism, the
whole of literary criticism could be reduced to the size of a
sixpenny bit&mdash;there are moments when one could wish it. But
this suggests that in time to come writers will have two languages
at their service; one for fact, one for fiction. When the
biographer has to convey a useful and necessary fact, as, for
example, that Oliver Smith went to college and took a third in the
year 1892, he will say so with a hollow 0 on top of the figure
five. When the novelist is forced to inform us that John rang the
bell after a pause the door was opened by a parlourmaid who said,
"Mrs. Jones is not at home," he will to our great gain and his own
comfort convey that repulsive statement not in words, but in
signs&mdash;say, a capital H on top of the figure three. Thus we
may look forward to the day when our biographies and novels will be
slim and muscular; and a railway company that says: "Do not lean
out of the window" in words will be fined a penalty not exceeding
five pounds for the improper use of language.</p>

<p>Words, then, are not useful. Let us now enquire into their other
quality, their positive quality, that is, their power to tell the
truth. According once more to the dictionary there are at least
three kinds of truth God's or gospel truth; literary truth; and
home truth (generally. unflattering). But to consider each
separately would take too long. Let us then simplify and assert
that since the only test of truth is length of life, and since
words survive the chops and changes of time longer than any other
substance, therefore they are the truest. Buildings fall; even the
earth perishes. What was yesterday a cornfield is to-day a
bungalow. But words, if properly used, seem able to live for ever.
What, then, we may ask next, is the proper use of words? Not, so we
have said, to make a useful statement; for a useful statement is a
statement that can mean only one thing. And it is the nature of
words to mean many things. Take the simple sentence "Passing
Russell Square." That proved useless because besides the surface
meaning it contained so many sunken meanings. The word "passing"
suggested the transiency of things, the passing of time and the
changes of human life. Then the word "Russell" suggested the
rustling of leaves and the skirt on a polished floor also the ducal
house of Bedford and half the history of England. Finally the word
"Square" brings in the sight, the shape of an actual square
combined with some visual suggestion of the stark angularity of
stucco. Thus one sentence of the simplest kind rouses the
imagination, the memory, the eye and the ear&mdash;all combine in
reading it.</p>

<p>But they combine&mdash;they combine unconsciously together. The
moment we single out and emphasize the suggestions as we have done
here they become unreal; and we, too, become
unreal&mdash;specialists, word mongers, phrase finders, not
readers. In reading we have to allow the sunken meanings to remain
sunken, suggested, not stated; lapsing and flowing into each other
like reeds on the bed of a river. But the words in that sentence
Passing Russell Square-are of course very rudimentary words. They
show no trace of the strange, of the diabolical power which words
possess when they are not tapped out by a typewriter but come fresh
from a human brain&mdash;the power that is to suggest the writer;
his character, his appearance, his wife, his family, his
house&mdash;even the cat on the hearthrug. Why words do this, how
they do it, how to prevent them from doing it nobody knows. They do
it without the writer's will; often against his will. No writer
presumably wishes to impose his own miserable character, his own
private secrets and vices upon the reader. But has any writer, who
is not a typewriter, succeeded in being wholly impersonal? Always,
inevitably, we know them as well as their books. Such is the
suggestive power of words that they will often make a bad book into
a very lovable human being, and a good book into a man whom we can
hardly tolerate in the room. Even words that are hundreds of years
old have this power; when they are new they have it so strongly
that they deafen us to the writer's meaning&mdash;it is them we
see, them we hear. That is one reason why our judgments of living
writers are so wildly erratic. Only after the writer is dead do his
words to some extent become disinfected, purified of the accidents
of the living body.</p>

<p>Now, this power of suggestion is one of the most mysterious
properties of words. Everyone who has ever written a sentence must
be conscious or half-conscious of it. Words, English words, are
full of echoes, of memories, of associations&mdash;naturally. They
have been out and about, on people's lips, in their houses, in the
streets, in the fields, for so many centuries. And that is one of
the chief difficulties in writing them today&mdash;that they are so
stored with meanings, with memories, that they have contracted so
many famous marriages. The splendid word "incarnadine," for
example&mdash;who can use it without remembering also
"multitudinous seas"? In the old days, of course, when English was
a new language, writers could invent new words and use them.
Nowadays it is easy enough to invent new words&mdash;they spring to
the lips whenever we see a new sight or feel a new
sensation&mdash;but we cannot use them because the language is old.
You cannot use a brand new word in an old language because of the
very obvious yet mysterious fact that a word is not a single and
separate entity, but part of other words. It is not a word indeed
until it is part of a sentence. Words belong to each other,
although, of course, only a great writer knows that the word
"incarnadine" belongs to "multitudinous seas." To combine new words
with old words is fatal to the constitution of the sentence. In
order to use new words properly you would have to invent a new
language; and that, though no doubt we shall come to it, is not at
the moment our business. Our business is to see what we can do with
the English language as it is. How can we combine the old words in
new orders so that they survive, so that they create beauty, so
that they tell the truth? That is the question.</p>

<p>And the person who could answer that question would deserve
whatever crown of glory the world has to offer. Think what it would
mean if you could teach, if you could learn, the art of writing.
Why, every book, every newspaper would tell the truth, would create
beauty. But there is, it would appear, some obstacle in the way,
some hindrance to the teaching of words. For though at this moment
at least a hundred professors are lecturing upon the literature of
the past, at least a thousand critics are reviewing the literature
of the present, and hundreds upon hundreds of young men and women
are passing examinations in English literature with the utmost
credit, still&mdash;do we write better, do we read better than we
read and wrote four hundred years ago when we were unlectured,
uncriticized, untaught? Is our Georgian literature a patch on the
Elizabethan? Where then are we to lay the blame? Not on our
professors; not on our reviewers; not on our writers; but on words.
It is words that are to blame. They are the wildest, freest, most
irresponsible, most unteachable of all things. Of course, you can
catch them and sort them and place them in alphabetical order in
dictionaries. But words do not live in dictionaries; they live in
the mind. If you want proof of this, consider how often in moments
of emotion when we most need words we find none. Yet there is the
dictionary; there at our disposal are some half-a-million words all
in alphabetical order. But can we use them? No, because words do
not live in dictionaries, they live in the mind. Look again at the
dictionary. There beyond a doubt lie plays more splendid than
<i>Antony And Cleopatra</i>; poems more lovely than the <i>Ode to a
Nightingale</i>; novels beside which <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> or
<i>David Copperfield</i> are the crude bunglings of amateurs. It is
only a question of finding the right words and putting them in the
right order. But we cannot do it because they do not live in
dictionaries; they live in the mind. And how do they live in the
mind? Variously and strangely, much as human beings live, by
ranging hither and thither, by falling in love, and mating
together. It is true that they are much less bound by ceremony and
convention than we are. Royal words mate with commoners. English
words marry French words, German words, Indian words, Negro words,
if they have a fancy. Indeed, the less we enquire into the past of
our dear Mother English the better it will be for that lady's
reputation. For she has gone a-roving, a-roving fair maid.</p>

<p>Thus to lay down any laws for such irreclaimable vagabonds is
worse than useless. A few trifling rules of grammar and spelling
are all the constraint we can put on them. All we can say about
them, as we peer at them over the edge of that deep, dark and only
fitfully illuminated cavern in which they live&mdash;the
mind&mdash;all we can say about them is that they seem to like
people to think and to feel before they use them, but to think and
to feel not about them, but about something different. They are
highly sensitive, easily made self-conscious. They do not like to
have their purity or their impurity discussed. If you start a
Society for Pure English, they will show their resentment by
starting another for impure English&mdash;hence the unnatural
violence of much modern speech; it is a protest against the
puritans. They are highly democratic, too; they believe that one
word is as good as another; uneducated words are as good as
educated words, uncultivated words as cultivated words, there are
no ranks or titles in their society. Nor do they like being lifted
out on the point of a pen and examined separately. They hang
together, in sentences, in paragraphs, sometimes for whole pages at
a time. They hate being useful; they hate making money; they hate
being lectured about in public. In short, they hate anything that
stamps them with one meaning or confines them to one attitude, for
it is their nature to change.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is their most striking peculiarity&mdash;their need
of change. It is because the truth they try to catch is many-sided,
and they convey it by being themselves many-sided, flashing this
way, then that. Thus they mean one thing to one person, another
thing to another person; they are unintelligible to one generation,
plain as a pikestaff to the next. And it is because of this
complexity that they survive. Perhaps then one reason why we have
no great poet, novelist or critic writing to-day is that we refuse
words their liberty. We pin them down to one meaning, their useful
meaning, the meaning which makes us catch the train, the meaning
which makes us pass the examination. And when words are pinned down
they fold their wings and die. Finally, and most emphatically,
words, like ourselves, in order to live at their ease, need
privacy. Undoubtedly they like us to think, and they like us to
feel, before we use them; but they also like us to pause; to become
unconscious. Our unconsciousness is their privacy; our darkness is
their light...That pause was made, that veil of darkness was
dropped, to tempt words to come together in one of those swift
marriages which are perfect images and create everlasting beauty.
But no&mdash;nothing of that sort is going to happen to-night. The
little wretches are out of temper; disobliging; disobedient; dumb.
What is it that they are muttering? "Time's up! Silence!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>30. A LETTER TO A YOUNG POET</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in 1932.)</p>

<p>My Dear John,</p>

<p>Did you ever meet, or was he before your day, that old
gentleman&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;who used to enliven
conversation, especially at breakfast when the post came in, by
saying that the art of letter-writing is dead? The penny post, the
old gentleman used to say, has killed the art of letter-writing.
Nobody, he continued, examining an envelope through his
eye-glasses, has the time even to cross their t's. We rush, he went
on, spreading his toast with marmalade, to the telephone. We commit
our half-formed thoughts in ungrammatical phrases to the post card.
Gray is dead, he continued; Horace Walpole is dead; Madame de
Sévigné&mdash;she is dead too, I suppose he was about to add, but a
fit of choking cut him short, and he had to leave the room before
he had time to condemn all the arts, as his pleasure was, to the
cemetery. But when the post came in this morning and I opened your
letter stuffed with little blue sheets written all over in a
cramped but not illegible hand&mdash;I regret to say, however, that
several t's were uncrossed and the grammar of one sentence seems to
me dubious&mdash;I replied after all these years to that elderly
necrophilist&mdash;Nonsense. The art of letter-writing has only
just come into existence. It is the child of the penny post. And
there is some truth in that remark, I think. Naturally when a
letter cost half a crown to send, it had to prove itself a document
of some importance; it was read aloud; it was tied up with green
silk; after a certain number of years it was published for the
infinite delectation of posterity. But your letter, on the
contrary, will have to be burnt. It only cost three-halfpence to
send. Therefore you could afford to be intimate, irreticent,
indiscreet in the extreme. What you tell me about poor dear C. and
his adventure on the Channel boat is deadly private; your ribald
jests at the expense of M. would certainly ruin your friendship if
they got about; I doubt, too, that posterity, unless it is much
quicker in the wit than I expect, could follow the line of your
thought from the roof which leaks ("splash, splash, splash into the
soap dish") past Mrs. Gape, the charwoman, whose retort to the
greengrocer gives me the keenest pleasure, via Miss Curtis and her
odd confidence on the steps of the omnibus; to Siamese cats ("Wrap
their noses in an old stocking my Aunt says if they howl"); so to
the value of criticism to a writer; so to Donne; so to Gerard
Hopkins; so to tombstones; so to gold-fish; and so with a sudden
alarming swoop to "Do write and tell me where poetry's going, or if
it's dead?" No, your letter, because it is a true letter&mdash;one
that can neither be read aloud now, nor printed in time to
come&mdash;will have to be burnt. Posterity must live upon Walpole
and Madame de Sévigné. The great age of letter-writing, which is,
of course, the present, will leave no letters behind it. And in
making my reply there is only one question that I can answer or
attempt to answer in public; about poetry and its death.</p>

<p>But before I begin, I must own up to those defects, both natural
and acquired, which, as you will find, distort and invalidate all
that I have to say about poetry. The lack of a sound university
training has always made it impossible for me to distinguish
between an iambic and a dactyl, and if this were not enough to
condemn one for ever, the practice of prose has bred in me, as in
most prose writers, a foolish jealousy, a righteous
indignation&mdash;anyhow, an emotion which the critic should be
without. For how, we despised prose writers ask when we get
together, could one say what one meant and observe the rules of
poetry? Conceive dragging in "blade" because one had mentioned
"maid"; and pairing "sorrow" with "borrow"? Rhyme is not only
childish, but dishonest, we prose writers say. Then we go on to
say, And look at their rules! How easy to be a poet! How strait the
path is for them, and how strict! This you must do; this you must
not. I would rather be a child and walk in a crocodile down a
suburban path than write poetry, I have heard prose writers say. It
must be like taking the veil and entering a religious
order&mdash;observing the rites and rigours of metre. That explains
why they repeat the same thing over and over again. Whereas we
prose writers (I am only telling you the sort of nonsense prose
writers talk when they are alone) are masters of language, not its
slaves; nobody can teach us; nobody can coerce us; we say what we
mean; we have the whole of life for our province. We are the
creators, we are the explorers...So we run on&mdash;nonsensically
enough, I must admit.</p>

<p>Now that I have made a clean breast of these deficiencies, let
us proceed. From certain phrases in your letter I gather that you
think that poetry is in a parlous way, and that your case as a poet
in this particular autumn Of 1931 is a great deal harder than
Shakespeare's, Dryden's, Pope's, or Tennyson's. In fact it is the
hardest case that has ever been known. Here you give me an opening,
which I am prompt to seize, for a little lecture. Never think
yourself singular, never think your own case much harder than other
people's. I admit that the age we live in makes this difficult. For
the first time in history there are readers&mdash;a large body of
people, occupied in business, in sport, in nursing their
grandfathers, in tying up parcels behind counters&mdash;they all
read now; and they want to be told how to read and what to read;
and their teachers&mdash;the reviewers, the lecturers, the
broadcasters&mdash;must in all humanity make reading easy for them;
assure them that literature is violent and exciting, full of heroes
and villains; of hostile forces perpetually in conflict; of fields
strewn with bones; of solitary victors riding off on white horses
wrapped in black cloaks to meet their death at the turn of the
road. A pistol shot rings out. "The age of romance was over. The
age of realism had begun"&mdash;you know the sort of thing. Now of
course writers themselves know very well that there is not a word
of truth in all this&mdash;there are no battles, and no murders and
no defeats and no victories. But as it is of the utmost importance
that readers should be amused, writers acquiesce. They dress
themselves up. They act their parts. One leads; the other follows.
One is romantic, the other realist. One is advanced, the other out
of date. There is no harm in it, so long as you take it as a joke,
but once you believe in it, once you begin to take yourself
seriously as a leader or as a follower, as a modern or as a
conservative, then you become a self-conscious, biting, and
scratching little animal whose work is not of the slightest value
or importance to anybody. Think of yourself rather as something
much humbler and less spectacular, but to my mind, far more
interesting&mdash;a poet in whom live all the poets of the past,
from whom all poets in time to come will spring. You have a touch
of Chaucer in you, and something of Shakespeare; Dryden, Pope,
Tennyson&mdash;to mention only the respectable among your
ancestors&mdash;stir in your blood and sometimes move your pen a
little to the right or to the left. In short you are an immensely
ancient, complex, and continuous character, for which reason please
treat yourself with respect and think twice before you dress up as
Guy Fawkes and spring out upon timid old ladies at street corners,
threatening death and demanding twopence-halfpenny.</p>

<p>However, as you say that you are in a fix ("it has never been so
hard to write poetry as it is to-day and that poetry may be, you
think, at its last gasp in England the novelists are doing all the
interesting things now"), let me while away the time before the
post goes in imagining your state and in hazarding one or two
guesses which, since this is a letter, need not be taken too
seriously or pressed too far. Let me try to put myself in your
place; let me try to imagine, with your letter to help me, what it
feels like to be a young poet in the autumn of 1931. (And taking my
own advice, I shall treat you not as one poet in particular, but as
several poets in one.) On the floor of your mind, then&mdash;is it
not this that makes you a poet?&mdash;rhythm keeps up its perpetual
beat. Sometimes it seems to die down to nothing; it lets you eat,
sleep, talk like other people. Then again it swells and rises and
attempts to sweep all the contents of your mind into one dominant
dance. To-night is such an occasion. Although you are alone, and
have taken one boot off and are about to undo the other, you cannot
go on with the process of undressing, but must instantly write at
the bidding of the dance. You snatch pen and paper; you hardly
trouble to hold the one or to straighten the other. And while you
write, while the first stanzas of the dance are being fastened
down, I will withdraw a little and look out of the window. A woman
passes, then a man; a car glides to a stop and then&mdash;but there
is no need to say what I see out of the window, nor indeed is there
time, for I am suddenly recalled from my observations by a cry of
rage or despair. Your page is crumpled in a ball; your pen sticks
upright by the nib in the carpet. If there were a cat to swing or a
wife to murder now would be the time. So at least I infer from the
ferocity of your expression. You are rasped, jarred, thoroughly out
of temper. And if I am to guess the reason, it is, I should say,
that the rhythm which was opening and shutting with a force that
sent shocks of excitement from your head to your heels has
encountered some hard and hostile object upon which it has smashed
itself to pieces. Something has worked in which cannot be made into
poetry; some foreign body, angular, sharp-edged, gritty, has
refused to join in the dance. Obviously, suspicion attaches to Mrs.
Gape; she has asked you to make a poem of her; then to Miss Curtis
and her confidences on the omnibus; then to C., who has infected
you with a wish to tell his story&mdash;and a very amusing one it
was&mdash;in verse. But for some reason you cannot do their
bidding. Chaucer could; Shakespeare could; so could Crabbe, Byron,
and perhaps Robert Browning. But it is October 1931, and for a long
time now poetry has shirked contact with&mdash;what shall we call
it?&mdash;Shall we shortly and no doubt inaccurately call it life?
And will you come to my help by guessing what I mean? Well then, it
has left all that to the novelist. Here you see how easy it would
be for me to write two or three volumes in honour of prose and in
mockery of verse; to say how wide and ample is the domain of the
one, how starved and stunted the little grove of the other. But it
would be simpler and perhaps fairer to check these theories by
opening one of the thin books of modern verse that lie on your
table. I open and I find myself instantly confused. Here are the
common objects of daily prose&mdash;the bicycle and the omnibus.
Obviously the poet is making his muse face facts. Listen:</p>

<blockquote>Which of you waking early and watching daybreak<br>
Will not hasten in heart, handsome, aware of wonder<br>
At light unleashed, advancing; a leader of movement,<br>
Breaking like surf on turf on road and roof,<br>
Or chasing shadow on downs like whippet racing,<br>
The stilled stone, halting at eyelash barrier,<br>
Enforcing in face a profile, marks of misuse,<br>
Beating impatient and importunate on boudoir shutters<br>
Where the old life is not up yet, with rays<br>
Exploring through rotting floor a dismantled mill&mdash;<br>
The old life never to be born again?</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but how will he get through with it? I read on and
find:</p>

<blockquote>Whistling as he shuts<br>
His door behind him, travelling to work by tube<br>
Or walking to the park to it to ease the bowels,</blockquote>

<p>and read on and find again</p>

<blockquote>As a boy lately come up from country to town<br>
Returns for the day to his village in <i>expensive
shoes</i>&mdash;</blockquote>

<p>and so on again to:</p>

<blockquote>Seeking a heaven on earth he chases his shadow,<br>
Loses his capital and his nerve in pursuing<br>
What yachtsmen, explorers, climbers and <i>buggers are
after</i>.</blockquote>

<p>These lines and the words I have emphasized are enough to
confirm me in part of my guess at least. The poet is trying to
include Mrs. Gape. He is honestly of opinion that she can be
brought into poetry and will do very well there. Poetry, he feels,
will be improved by the actual, the colloquial. But though I honour
him for the attempt, I doubt that it is wholly successful. I feel a
jar. I feel a shock. I feel as if I had stubbed my toe on the
corner of the wardrobe. Am I then, I go on to ask, shocked,
prudishly and conventionally, by the words themselves? I think not.
The shock is literally a shock. The poet as I guess has strained
himself to include an emotion that is not domesticated and
acclimatized to poetry; the effort has thrown him off his balance;
he rights himself, as I am sure I shall find if I turn the page, by
a violent recourse to the poetical&mdash;he invokes the moon or the
nightingale. Anyhow, the transition is sharp. The poem is cracked
in the middle. Look, it comes apart in my hands: here is reality on
one side, here is beauty on the other; and instead of acquiring a
whole object rounded and entire, I am left with broken parts in my
hands which, since my reason has been roused and my imagination has
not been allowed to take entire possession of me, I contemplate
coldly, critically, and with distaste.</p>

<p>Such at least is the hasty analysis I make of my own sensations
as a reader; but again I am interrupted. I see that you have
overcome your difficulty, whatever it was; the pen is once more in
action, and having torn up the first poem you are at work upon
another. Now then if I want to understand your state of mind I must
invent another explanation to account for this return of fluency.
You have dismissed, as I suppose, all sorts of things that would
come naturally to your pen if you had been writing prose&mdash;the
charwoman, the omnibus, the incident on the Channel boat. Your
range is restricted&mdash;I judge from your
expression&mdash;concentrated and intensified. I hazard a guess
that you are thinking now, not about things in general, but about
yourself in particular. There is a fixity, a gloom, yet an inner
glow that seem to hint that you are looking within and not without.
But in order to consolidate these flimsy guesses about the meaning
of an expression on a face, let me open another of the books on
your table and check it by what I find there. Again I open at
random and read this:</p>

<blockquote>To penetrate that room is my desire,<br>
The extreme attic of the mind, that lies<br>
Just beyond the last bend in the corridor.<br>
Writing I do it. Phrases, poems are keys.<br>
Loving's another way (but not so sure).<br>
A fire's in there, I think, there's truth at last<br>
Deep in a lumber chest. Sometimes I'm near,<br>
But draughts puff out the matches, and I'm lost.<br>
Sometimes I'm lucky, find a key to turn,<br>
Open an inch or two&mdash;but always then<br>
A bell rings, someone calls, or cries of "fire"<br>
Arrest my hand when nothing's known or seen,<br>
And running down the stairs again I mourn.</blockquote>

<p>and then this:</p>

<blockquote>There is a dark room,<br>
The locked and shuttered womb,<br>
Where negative's made positive.<br>
Another dark room,<br>
The blind and bolted tomb,<br>
Where positives change to negative.<br>
We may not undo that or escape this, who<br>
Have birth and death coiled in our bones,<br>
Nothing we can do<br>
Will sweeten the real rue,<br>
That we begin, and end, with groans.</blockquote>

<p>And then this:</p>

<blockquote>Never being, but always at the edge of Being<br>
My head, like Death mask, is brought into the Sun.<br>
The shadow pointing finger across cheek,<br>
I move lips for tasting, I move hands for touching,<br>
But never am nearer than touching,<br>
Though the spirit leans outward for seeing.<br>
Observing rose, gold, eyes, an admired landscape,<br>
My senses record the act of wishing<br>
Wishing to be<br>
Rose, gold, landscape or another&mdash;<br>
Claiming fulfilment in the act of loving.</blockquote>

<p>Since these quotations are chosen at random and I have yet found
three different poets writing about nothing, if not about the poet
himself, I hold that the chances are that you too are engaged in
the same occupation. I conclude that self offers no impediment;
self joins in the dance; self lends itself to the rhythm; it is
apparently easier to write a poem about oneself than about any
other subject. But what does one mean by "oneself"? Not the self
that Wordsworth, Keats, and Shelley have described&mdash;not the
self that loves a woman, or that hates a tyrant, or that broods
over the mystery of the world. No, the self that you are engaged in
describing is shut out from all that. It is a self that sits alone
in the room at night with the blinds drawn. In other words the poet
is much less interested in what we have in common than in what he
has apart. Hence I suppose the extreme difficulty of these
poems&mdash;and I have to confess that it would floor me completely
to say from one reading or even from two or three what these poems
mean. The poet is trying honestly and exactly to describe a world
that has perhaps no existence except for one particular person at
one particular moment. And the more sincere he is in keeping to the
precise outline of the roses and cabbages of his private universe,
the more he puzzles us who have agreed in a lazy spirit of
compromise to see roses and cabbages as they are seen, more or
less, by the twenty-six passengers on the outside of an omnibus. He
strains to describe; we strain to see; he flickers his torch; we
catch a flying gleam. It is exciting; it is stimulating; but is
that a tree, we ask, or is it perhaps an old woman tying up her
shoe in the gutter?</p>

<p>Well, then, if there is any truth in what I am saying&mdash;if
that is you cannot write about the actual, the colloquial, Mrs.
Gape or the Channel boat or Miss Curtis on the omnibus, without
straining the machine of poetry, if, therefore, you are driven to
contemplate landscapes and emotions within and must render visible
to the world at large what you alone can see, then indeed yours is
a hard case, and poetry, though still breathing&mdash;witness these
little books&mdash;is drawing her breath in short, sharp gasps.
Still, consider the symptoms. They are not the symptoms of death in
the least. Death in literature, and I need not tell you how often
literature has died in this country or in that, comes gracefully,
smoothly, quietly. Lines slip easily down the accustomed grooves.
The old designs are copied so glibly that we are half inclined to
think them original, save for that very glibness. But here the very
opposite is happening: here in my first quotation the poet breaks
his machine because he will clog it with raw fact. In my second, he
is unintelligible because of his desperate determination to tell
the truth about himself. Thus I cannot help thinking that though
you may be right in talking of the difficulty of the time, you are
wrong to despair.</p>

<p>Is there not, alas, good reason to hope? I say "alas" because
then I must give my reasons, which are bound to be foolish and
certain also to cause pain to the large and highly respectable
society of necrophils&mdash;Mr. Peabody, and his like&mdash;who
much prefer death to life and are even now intoning the sacred and
comfortable words, Keats is dead, Shelley is dead, Byron is dead.
But it is late: necrophily induces slumber; the old gentlemen have
fallen asleep over their classics, and if what I am about to say
takes a sanguine tone&mdash;and for my part I do not believe in
poets dying; Keats, Shelley, Byron are alive here in this room in
you and you and you&mdash;I can take comfort from the thought that
my hoping will not disturb their snoring. So to continue&mdash;why
should not poetry, now that it has so honestly scraped itself free
from certain falsities, the wreckage of the great Victorian age,
now that it has so sincerely gone down into the mind of the poet
and verified its outlines&mdash;a work of renovation that has to be
done from time to time and was certainly needed, for bad poetry is
almost always the result of forgetting oneself&mdash;all becomes
distorted and impure if you lose sight of that central
reality&mdash;now, I say, that poetry has done all this, why should
it not once more open its eyes, look out of the window and write
about other people? Two or three hundred years ago you were always
writing about other people. Your pages were crammed with characters
of the most opposite and various kinds&mdash;Hamlet, Cleopatra,
Falstaff. Not only did we go to you for drama, and for the
subtleties of human character, but we also went to you, incredible
though this now seems, for laughter. You made us roar with
laughter. Then later, not more than a hundred years ago, you were
lashing our follies, trouncing our hypocrisies, and dashing off the
most brilliant of satires. You were Byron, remember; you wrote Don
Juan. You were Crabbe also; you took the most sordid details of the
lives of peasants for your theme. Clearly therefore you have it in
you to deal with a vast variety of subjects; it is only a temporary
necessity that has shut you up in one room, alone, by yourself.</p>

<p>But how are you going to get out, into the world of other
people? That is your problem now, if I may hazard a guess&mdash;to
find the right relationship, now that you know yourself, between
the self that you know and the world outside. It is a difficult
problem. No living poet has, I think, altogether solved it. And
there are a thousand voices prophesying despair. Science, they say,
has made poetry impossible; there is no poetry in motor cars and
wireless. And we have no religion. All is tumultuous and
transitional. Therefore, so people say, there can be no relation
between the poet and the present age. But surely that is nonsense.
These accidents are superficial; they do not go nearly deep enough
to destroy the most profound and primitive of instincts, the
instinct of rhythm. All you need now is to stand at the window and
let your rhythmical sense open and shut, open and shut, boldly and
freely, until one thing melts in another, until the taxis are
dancing with the daffodils, until a whole has been made from all
these separate fragments. I am talking nonsense, I know. What I
mean is, summon all your courage, exert all your vigilance, invoke
all the gifts that Nature has been induced to bestow. Then let your
rhythmical sense wind itself in and out among men and women,
omnibuses, sparrows&mdash;whatever come along the
street&mdash;until it has strung them together in one harmonious
whole. That perhaps is your task&mdash;to find the relation between
things that seem incompatible yet have a mysterious affinity, to
absorb every experience that comes your way fearlessly and saturate
it completely so that your poem is a whole, not a fragment; to
re-think human life into poetry and so give us tragedy again and
comedy by means of characters not spun out at length in the
novelist's way, but condensed and synthesised in the poet's
way-that is what we look to you to do now. But as I do not know
what I mean by rhythm nor what I mean by life, and as most
certainly I cannot tell you which objects can properly be combined
together in a poem&mdash;that is entirely your affair&mdash;and as
I cannot tell a dactyl from an iambic, and am therefore unable to
say how you must modify and expand the rites and ceremonies of your
ancient and mysterious art&mdash;I will move on to safer ground and
turn again to these little books themselves.</p>

<p>When, then, I return to them I am, as I have admitted, filled,
not with forebodings of death, but with hopes for the future. But
one does not always want to be thinking of the future, if, as
sometimes happens, one is living in the present. When I read these
poems, now, at the present moment, I find myself&mdash;reading, you
know, is rather like opening the door to a horde of rebels who
swarm out attacking one in twenty places at once&mdash;hit, roused,
scraped, bared, swung through the air, so that life seems to flash
by; then again blinded, knocked on the head&mdash;all of which are
agreeable sensations for a reader (since nothing is more dismal
than to open the door and get no response), and all I believe
certain proof that this poet is alive and kicking. And yet mingling
with these cries of delight, of jubilation, I record also, as I
read, the repetition in the bass of one word intoned over and over
again by some malcontent. At last then, silencing the others, I say
to this malcontent, "Well, and what do <i>you</i> want?" Whereupon
he bursts out, rather to my discomfort, "Beauty." Let me repeat, I
take no responsibility for what my senses say when I read; I merely
record the fact that there is a malcontent in me who complains that
it seems to him odd, considering that English is a mixed language,
a rich language; a language unmatched for its sound and colour, for
its power of imagery and suggestion&mdash;it seems to him odd that
these modern poets should write as if they had neither ears nor
eyes, neither soles to their feet nor palms to their hands, but
only honest enterprising book-fed brains, uni-sexual bodies
and&mdash;but here I interrupted him. For when it comes to saying
that a poet should be bisexual, and that I think is what he was
about to say, even I, who have had no scientific training
whatsoever, draw the line and tell that voice to be silent.</p>

<p>But how far, if we discount these obvious absurdities, do you
think there is truth in this complaint? For my own part now that I
have stopped reading, and can see the poems more or less as a
whole, I think it is true that the eye and ear are starved of their
rights. There is no sense of riches held in reserve behind the
admirable exactitude of the lines I have quoted, as there is, for
example, behind the exactitude of Mr. Yeats. The poet clings to his
one word, his only word, as a drowning man to a spar. And if this
is so, I am ready to hazard a reason for it all the more readily
because I think it bears out what I have just been saying. The art
of writing, and that is perhaps what my malcontent means by
"beauty," the art of having at one's beck and call every word in
the language, of knowing their weights, colours, sounds,
associations, and thus making them, as is so necessary in English,
suggest more than they can state, can be learnt of course to some
extent by reading&mdash;it is impossible to read too much; but much
more drastically and effectively by imagining that one is not
oneself but somebody different. How can you learn to write if you
write only about one single person? To take the obvious example.
Can you doubt that the reason why Shakespeare knew every sound and
syllable in the language and could do precisely what he liked with
grammar and syntax, was that Hamlet, Falstaff and Cleopatra rushed
him into this knowledge; that the lords, officers, dependants,
murderers and common soldiers of the plays insisted that he should
say exactly what they felt in the words expressing their feelings?
It was they who taught him to write, not the begetter of the
Sonnets. So that if you want to satisfy all those senses that rise
in a swarm whenever we drop a poem among them&mdash;the reason, the
imagination, the eyes, the ears, the palms of the hands and the
soles of the feet, not to mention a million more that the
psychologists have yet to name, you will do well to embark upon a
long poem in which people as unlike yourself as possible talk at
the tops of their voices. And for heaven's sake, publish nothing
before you are thirty.</p>

<p>That, I am sure, is of very great importance. Most of the faults
in the poems I have been reading can be explained, I think, by the
fact that they have been exposed to the fierce light of publicity
while they were still too young to stand the strain. It has
shrivelled them into a skeleton austerity, both emotional and
verbal, which should not be characteristic of youth. The poet
writes very well; he writes for the eye of a severe and intelligent
public; but how much better he would have written if for ten years
he had written for no eye but his own! After all, the years from
twenty to thirty are years (let me refer to your letter again) of
emotional excitement. The rain dripping, a wing flashing, someone
passing&mdash;the commonest sounds and sights have power to fling
one, as I seem to remember, from the heights of rapture to the
depths of despair. And if the actual life is thus extreme, the
visionary life should be free to follow. Write then, now that you
are young, nonsense by the ream. Be silly, be sentimental, imitate
Shelley, imitate Samuel Smiles; give the rein to every impulse;
commit every fault of style, grammar, taste, and syntax; pour out;
tumble over; loose anger, love, satire, in whatever words you can
catch, coerce or create, in whatever metre, prose, poetry, or
gibberish that comes to hand. Thus you will learn to write. But if
you publish, your freedom will be checked; you will be thinking
what people will say; you will write for others when you ought only
to be writing for yourself. And what point can there be in curbing
the wild torrent of spontaneous nonsense which is now, for a few
years only, your divine gift in order to publish prim little books
of experimental verses? To make money? That, we both know, is out
of the question. To get criticism? But you friends will pepper your
manuscripts with far more serious and searching criticism than any
you will get from the reviewers. As for fame, look I implore you at
famous people; see how the waters of dullness spread around them as
they enter; observe their pomposity, their prophetic airs; reflect
that the greatest poets were anonymous; think how Shakespeare cared
nothing for fame; how Donne tossed his poems into the waste-paper
basket; write an essay giving a single instance of any modern
English writer who has survived the disciples and the admirers, the
autograph hunters and the interviewers, the dinners and the
luncheons, the celebrations and the commemorations with which
English society so effectively stops the mouths of its singers and
silences their songs.</p>

<p>But enough. I, at any rate, refuse to be necrophilus. So long as
you and you and you, venerable and ancient representatives of
Sappho, Shakespeare, and Shelley are aged precisely twenty-three
and propose&mdash;O enviable lot!&mdash;to spend the next fifty
years of your lives in writing poetry, I refuse to think that the
art is dead. And if ever the temptation to necrophilize comes over
you, be warned by the fate of that old gentleman whose name I
forget, but I think that it was Peabody. In the very act of
consigning all the arts to the grave he choked over a large piece
of hot buttered toast and the consolation then offered him that he
was about to join the elder Pliny in the shades gave him, I am
told, no sort of satisfaction whatsoever.</p>

<p>And now for the intimate, the indiscreet, and indeed, the only
really interesting parts of this letter...</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>31. WHY?</h2>

<p>When the first number of <i>Lysistrata</i> appeared, I confess
that I was deeply disappointed. It was so well printed, on such
good paper. It looked established, prosperous. As I turned the
pages it seemed to me that wealth must have descended upon
Somerville, and I was about to answer the request of the editor for
an article with a negative, when I read, greatly to my relief, that
one of the writers was badly dressed, and gathered from another
that the women's colleges still lack power and prestige. At this I
plucked up heart, and a crowd of questions that have been pressing
to be asked rushed to my lips saying: "Here is our chance."</p>

<p>I should explain that like so many people nowadays I am pestered
with questions. I find it impossible to walk down the street
without stopping, it may be in the middle of the road. to ask: Why?
Churches, public houses, parliaments, shops, loud speakers, motor
cars, the drone of an aeroplane in the clouds, and men and women
all inspire questions. Yet what is the point of asking questions of
oneself? They should be asked openly in public. But the great
obstacle to asking questions openly in public is, of course,
wealth. The little twisted sign that comes at the end of a question
has a way of making the rich writhe; power and prestige come down
upon it with all their weight. Questions, therefore, being
sensitive, impulsive and often foolish, have a way of picking their
asking place with care. They shrivel up in an atmosphere of power,
prosperity, and time-worn stone. They die by the dozen on the
threshold of great newspaper offices. They slink away to less
favoured, less flourishing quarters where people are poor and
therefore have nothing to give, where they have no power and
therefore have nothing to lose. Now the questions that have been
pestering me to ask them decided, whether rightly or wrongly, that
they could be asked in <i>Lysistrata</i>. They said: "We do not
expect you to ask us in&mdash;&mdash;," here they named some of our
most respectable dailies and weeklies; "nor in&mdash;&mdash;," here
they named some of our most venerable institutions. "But, thank
Heaven!" they exclaimed, "are not women's colleges poor and young?
Are they not inventive, adventurous? Are they not out to create a
new&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The editor forbids feminism," I interposed severely.</p>

<p>"What is feminism?" they screamed with one accord, and as I did
not answer at once, a new question was flung at me: "Don't you
think it high time that a new&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But I stopped them by reminding them that they had only two
thousand words at their disposal. Upon that, they withdrew,
consulted together, and finally put forward the request that I
should introduce one or two of them of the simplest, tamest, and
most obvious. For example, there is the question that always bobs
up at the beginning of term when societies issue their invitations
and universities open their doors&mdash;why lecture, why be
lectured?</p>

<p>In order to place this question fairly before you, I will
describe, for memory has kept the picture bright, one of those rare
but, as Queen Victoria would have put at,
never-to-be-sufficiently-lamented occasions when in deference to
friendship, or in a desperate attempt to acquire information about,
perhaps, the French Revolution, it seemed necessary to attend a
lecture. The room to begin with had a hybrid look&mdash;it was not
for sitting in, nor yet for eating in. Perhaps there was a map on
the wall; certainly there was a table on a platform, and several
rows of rather small, rather hard, comfortless little chairs. These
were occupied intermittently, as if they shunned each other's
company, by people of both sexes, and some had notebooks and were
tapping their fountain pens, and some had none and gazed with the
vacancy and placidity of bull frogs at the ceiling. A large clock
displayed its cheerless face,&mdash;and when the hour struck in
strode a harried-looking man, a man from whose face nervousness,
vanity, or perhaps the depressing and impossible nature of his task
had removed all traces of ordinary humanity. There was a momentary
stir. He had written a book, and for a moment it is interesting to
see people who have written books. Everybody gazed at him. He was
bald and not hairy; had a mouth and a chin; in short he was a man
like another, although he had written a book. He cleared his throat
and the lecture began. Now the human voice is an instrument of
varied power; it can enchant and it can soothe; it can rage and it
can despair; but when it lectures it almost always bores. What he
said was sensible enough; there was learning in it and argument and
reason; but as the voice went on attention wandered. The face of
the clock seemed abnormally pale; the hands too suffered from some
infirmity. Had they the gout? Were they swollen? They moved so
slowly. They reminded one of the painful progress of a three-legged
fly that has survived the winter. How many flies on an average
survive the English winter, and what would be the thoughts of such
an insect on waking to find itself being lectured on the French
Revolution? The enquiry was fatal. A link had been lost&mdash;a
paragraph dropped. It was useless to ask the lecturer to repeat his
words; on he plodded with dogged pertinacity. The origin of the
French Revolution was being sought for&mdash;also the thoughts of
flies. Now there came one of those flat stretches of discourse when
minute objects can be seen coming for two or three miles ahead.
"Skip!" we entreated him&mdash;vainly. He did not skip. There was a
joke. Then the voice went on again; then it seemed that the windows
wanted washing; then a woman sneezed; then the voice quickened;
then there was a peroration and then&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;the
lecture was over.</p>

<p>Why, since life holds only so many hours, waste one of them on
being lectured? Why, since printing presses have been invented
these many centuries, should he not have printed his lecture
instead of speaking it? Then, by the fire in winter, or under an
apple tree in summer, it could have been read, thought over,
discussed; the difficult ideas pondered, the argument debated. It
could have been thickened and stiffened. There would have been no
need of those repetitions and dilutions with which lectures have to
be watered down and brightened up, so as to attract the attention
of a miscellaneous audience too apt to think about noses and chins,
women sneezing and the longevity of flies.</p>

<p>It may be, I told these questions, that there is some reason,
imperceptible to outsiders, which makes lectures an essential part
of university discipline. But why&mdash;here another rushed to the
forefront&mdash;why, if lectures are necessary as a form of
education, should they not be abolished as a form of entertainment?
Never does the crocus flower or the beech tree redden but there
issues simultaneously from all the universities of England,
Scotland and Ireland a shower of notes from desperate secretaries
entreating So-and-so and So-and-so and So-and-so to come down and
address them upon art or literature or politics or
morality&mdash;And why?</p>

<p>In the old days, when newspapers were scarce and carefully lent
about from hall to rectory, such laboured methods of rubbing up
minds and imparting ideas were no doubt essential. But now, when
every day of the week scatters our tables with articles and
pamphlets in which every shade of opinion is expressed, far more
tersely than by word of mouth, why continue an obsolete custom
which not merely wastes time and temper, but incites the most
debased of human passions&mdash;vanity, ostentation,
self-assertion, and the desire to convert? Why encourage your
elders to turn themselves into prigs and prophets, when they are
ordinary men and women? Why force them to stand on a platform for
forty minutes while you reflect upon the colour of their hair and
the longevity of flies? Why not let them talk to you and listen to
you, naturally and happily, on the floor? Why not create a new form
of society founded on poverty and equality? Why not bring together
people of all ages and both sexes and all shades of fame and
obscurity so that they can talk, without mounting platforms or
reading papers or wearing expensive clothes or eating expensive
food? Would not such a society be worth, even as a form of
education, all the papers on art and literature that have ever been
read since the world began? Why not abolish prigs and prophets? Why
not invent human intercourse? Why not try?</p>

<p>Here, being sick of the word "why," I was about to indulge
myself with a few reflections of a general nature upon society as
it was, as it is, as it might be, with a few fancy pictures of Mrs.
Thrale entertaining Dr. Johnson, Lady Holland amusing Lord Macaulay
thrown in, when such a clamour arose among the questions that I
could hardly hear myself think. The cause of the clamour was soon
apparent. I had incautiously and foolishly used the word
"literature." Now if there is one word that excites questions and
puts them in a fury it is this word "literature." There they were,
screaming and crying, asking questions about poetry and fiction and
criticism, each demanding to be heard, each certain that his was
the only question that deserved an answer. At last, when they had
destroyed all my fancy pictures of Lady Holland and Dr. Johnson,
one insisted, for he said that foolish and rash as he might be he
was less so than the others, that he should be asked. And his
question was, why learn English literature at universities when you
can read it for yourselves in books? But I said that it is foolish
to ask a question that has already been answered&mdash;English
literature is, I believe, already taught at the universities.
Besides, if we are going to start an argument about it, we should
need at least twenty volumes, whereas we have only about seven
hundred words remaining. Still, as he was importunate, I said I
would ask the question and introduce it to the best of my ability,
without expressing any opinion of my own, by copying down the
following fragment of dialogue.</p>

<p>The other day I went to call upon a friend of mine who earns her
living as a publisher's reader. The room was a little dark, it
seemed to me, when I went in. Yet, as the window was open and it
was a fine spring day, the darkness must have been
spiritual&mdash;the effect of some private sorrow I feared. Her
first words as I came in confirmed my fears:</p>

<p>"Alas, poor boy!" she exclaimed, tossing the manuscript she was
reading to the ground with a gesture of despair. Had some accident
happened to one of her relations, I asked, motoring or
climbing?</p>

<p>"If you call three hundred pages on the evolution of the
Elizabethan sonnet an accident." she said.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" I replied with relief.</p>

<p>"All?" she retaliated, "Isn't it enough?" And, beginning to pace
up and down the room she exclaimed: "Once he was a clever boy; once
he was worth talking to; once he cared about English literature.
But now&mdash;&mdash;" She threw out her hands as if words failed
her&mdash;but not at all. There followed such a flood of
lamentation and vituperation&mdash;but reflecting how hard her life
was, reading manuscripts day in, day out, I excused her&mdash;that
I could not follow the argument. All I could gather was that this
lecturing about English literature&mdash;"if you want to teach them
to read English," she threw in, "teach them to read
Greek"&mdash;this passing of examinations in English literature,
which led to all this writing about English literature, was bound
in the end to be the death and burial of English literature. "The
tombstone," she was proceeding, "will be a bound volume
of&mdash;&mdash;" when I stopped her and told her not to talk such
nonsense. "Then tell me," she said, standing over me with her fists
clenched, "do they write any better for it? Is poetry better, is
fiction better, is criticism better now that they have been taught
how to read English literature?" As if to answer her own question
she read a passage from the manuscript on the floor. "And each the
spit and image of the other!" she groaned, lifting it wearily to
its place with the manuscripts on the shelf.</p>

<p>"But think of all they must know," I tried to argue.</p>

<p>"Know?" she echoed me. "Know? What d'you mean by 'know'?" As
that was a difficult question to answer off-hand, I passed it over
by saying: "Well, at any rate they'll be able to make their livings
and teach other people." Whereupon she lost her temper and, seizing
the unfortunate work upon the Elizabethan sonnet, whizzed it across
the room. The rest of the visit passed in picking up the fragments
of a teapot that had belonged to her grandmother.</p>

<p>Now of course a dozen other questions clamour to be asked about
churches and parliaments and public houses and shops and
loudspeakers and men and women; but mercifully time is up; silence
falls.</p>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>32. PROFESSIONS FOR WOMEN</h2>

<p class="cpb">(A paper read to The Women's Service League.)</p>

<p>When your secretary invited me to come here, she told me that
your Society is concerned with the employment of women and she
suggested that I might tell you something about my own professional
experiences. It is true I am a woman; it is true I am employed; but
what professional experiences have I had? It is difficult to say.
My profession is literature; and in that profession there are fewer
experiences for women than in any other, with the exception of the
stage&mdash;fewer, I mean, that are peculiar to women. For the road
was cut many years ago&mdash;by Fanny Burney, by Aphra Behn, by
Harriet Martineau, by Jane Austen, by George Eliot&mdash;many
famous women, and many more unknown and forgotten, have been before
me, making the path smooth, and regulating my steps. Thus, when I
came to write, there were very few material obstacles in my way.
Writing was a reputable and harmless occupation. The family peace
was not broken by the scratching of a pen. No demand was made upon
the family purse. For ten and sixpence one can buy paper enough to
write all the plays of Shakespeare&mdash;if one has a mind that
way. Pianos and models, Paris, Vienna and Berlin, masters and
mistresses, are not needed by a writer. The cheapness of writing
paper is, of course, the reason why women have succeeded as writers
before they have succeeded in the other professions.</p>

<p>But to tell you my story&mdash;it is a simple one. You have only
got to figure to yourselves a girl in a bedroom with a pen in her
hand. She had only to move that pen from left to right&mdash;from
ten o'clock to one. Then it occurred to her to do what is simple
and cheap enough after all&mdash;to slip a few of those pages into
an envelope, fix a penny stamp in the corner, and drop the envelope
into the red box at the corner. It was thus that I became a
journalist; and my effort was rewarded on the first day of the
following month&mdash;a very glorious day it was for me&mdash;by a
letter from an editor containing a cheque for one pound ten
shillings and sixpence. But to show you how little I deserve to be
called a professional woman, how little I know of the struggles and
difficulties of such lives, I have to admit that instead of
spending that sum upon bread and butter, rent, shoes and stockings,
or butcher's bills, I went out and bought a cat&mdash;a beautiful
cat, a Persian cat, which very soon involved me in bitter disputes
with my neighbours.</p>

<p>What could be easier than to write articles and to buy Persian
cats with the profits? But wait a moment. Articles have to be about
something. Mine, I seem to remember, was about a novel by a famous
man. And while I was writing this review, I discovered that if I
were going to review books I should need to do battle with a
certain phantom. And the phantom was a woman, and when I came to
know her better I called her after the heroine of a famous poem,
The Angel in the House. It was she who used to come between me and
my paper when I was writing reviews. It was she who bothered me and
wasted my time and so tormented me that at last I killed her. You
who come of a younger and happier generation may not have heard of
her&mdash;you may not know what I mean by the Angel in the House. I
will describe her as shortly as I can. She was intensely
sympathetic. She was immensely charming. She was utterly unselfish.
She excelled in the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed
herself daily. If there was chicken, she took the leg; if there was
a draught she sat in it&mdash;in short she was so constituted that
she never had a mind or a wish of her own, but preferred to
sympathize always with the minds and wishes of others. Above
all&mdash;I need not say it&mdash;-she was pure. Her purity was
supposed to be her chief beauty&mdash;her blushes, her great grace.
In those days&mdash;the last of Queen Victoria&mdash;every house
had its Angel. And when I came to write I encountered her with the
very first words. The shadow of her wings fell on my page; I heard
the rustling of her skirts in the room. Directly, that is to say, I
took my pen in my hand to review that novel by a famous man, she
slipped behind me and whispered: "My dear, you are a young woman.
You are writing about a book that has been written by a man. Be
sympathetic; be tender; flatter; deceive; use all the arts and
wiles of our sex. Never let anybody guess that you have a mind of
your own. Above all, be pure." And she made as if to guide my pen.
I now record the one act for which I take some credit to myself,
though the credit rightly belongs to some excellent ancestors of
mine who left me a certain sum of money&mdash;shall we say five
hundred pounds a year?&mdash;so that it was not necessary for me to
depend solely on charm for my living. I turned upon her and caught
her by the throat. I did my best to kill her. My excuse, if I were
to be had up in a court of law, would be that I acted in
self-defence. Had I not killed her she would have killed me. She
would have plucked the heart out of my writing. For, as I found,
directly I put pen to paper, you cannot review even a novel without
having a mind of your own, without expressing what you think to be
the truth about human relations, morality, sex. And all these
questions, according to the Angel of the House, cannot be dealt
with freely and openly by women; they must charm, they must
conciliate, they must&mdash;to put it bluntly&mdash;tell lies if
they are to succeed. Thus, whenever I felt the shadow of her wing
or the radiance of her halo upon my page, I took up the inkpot and
flung it at her. She died hard. Her fictitious nature was of great
assistance to her. It is far harder to kill a phantom than a
reality. She was always creeping back when I thought I had
despatched her. Though I flatter myself that I killed her in the
end, the struggle was severe; it took much time that had better
have been spent upon learning Greek grammar; or in roaming the
world in search of adventures. But it was a real experience; it was
an experience that was bound to befall all women writers at that
time. Killing the Angel in the House was part of the occupation of
a woman writer.</p>

<p>But to continue my story. The Angel was dead; what then
remained? You may say that what remained was a simple and common
object&mdash;a young woman in a bedroom with an inkpot. In other
words, now that she had rid herself of falsehood, that young woman
had only to be herself. Ah, but what is "herself"? I mean, what is
a woman? I assure you, I do not know. I do not believe that you
know. I do not believe that anybody can know until she has
expressed herself in all the arts and professions open to human
skill. That indeed is one of the reasons why I have come here out
of respect for you, who are in process of showing us by your
experiments what a woman is, who are in process Of providing us, by
your failures and successes, with that extremely important piece of
information.</p>

<p>But to continue the story of my professional experiences. I made
one pound ten and six by my first review; and I bought a Persian
cat with the proceeds. Then I grew ambitious. A Persian cat is all
very well, I said; but a Persian cat is not enough. I must have a
motor car. And it was thus that I became a novelist&mdash;for it is
a very strange thing that people will give you a motor car if you
will tell them a story. It is a still stranger thing that there is
nothing so delightful in the world as telling stories. It is far
pleasanter than writing reviews of famous novels. And yet, if I am
to obey your secretary and tell you my professional experiences as
a novelist, I must tell you about a very strange experience that
befell me as a novelist. And to understand it you must try first to
imagine a novelist's state of mind. I hope I am not giving away
professional secrets if I say that a novelist's chief desire is to
be as unconscious as possible. He has to induce in himself a state
of perpetual lethargy. He wants life to proceed with the utmost
quiet and regularity. He wants to see the same faces, to read the
same books, to do the same things day after day, month after month,
while he is writing, so that nothing may break the illusion in
which he is living&mdash;so that nothing may disturb or disquiet
the mysterious nosings about, feelings round, darts, dashes and
sudden discoveries of that very shy and illusive spirit, the
imagination. I suspect that this state is the same both for men and
women. Be that as it may, I want you to imagine me writing a novel
in a state of trance. I want you to figure to yourselves a girl
sitting with a pen in her hand, which for minutes, and indeed for
hours, she never dips into the inkpot. The image that comes to my
mind when I think of this girl is the image of a fisherman lying
sunk in dreams on the verge of a deep lake with a rod held out over
the water. She was letting her imagination sweep unchecked round
every rock and cranny of the world that lies submerged in the
depths of our unconscious being. Now came the experience, the
experience that I believe to be far commoner with women writers
than with men. The line raced through the girl's fingers. Her
imagination had rushed away. It had sought the pools, the depths,
the dark places where the largest fish slumber. And then there was
a smash. There was an explosion. There was foam and confusion. The
imagination had dashed itself against something hard. The girl was
roused from her dream. She was indeed in a state of the most acute
and difficult distress. To speak without figure she had thought of
something, something about the body, about the passions which it
was unfitting for her as a woman to say. Men, her reason told her,
would be shocked. The consciousness of&mdash;what men will say of a
woman who speaks the truth about her passions had roused her from
her artist's state of unconsciousness. She could write no more. The
trance was over. Her imagination could work no longer. This I
believe to be a very common experience with women
writers&mdash;they are impeded by the extreme conventionality of
the other sex. For though men sensibly allow themselves great
freedom in these respects, I doubt that they realize or can control
the extreme severity with which they condemn such freedom in
women.</p>

<p>These then were two very genuine experiences of my own. These
were two of the adventures of my professional life. The
first&mdash;killing the Angel in the House&mdash;I think I solved.
She died. But the second, telling the truth about my own
experiences as a body, I do not think I solved. I doubt that any
woman has solved it yet. The obstacles against her are still
immensely powerful&mdash;and yet they are very difficult to define.
Outwardly, what is simpler than to write books? Outwardly, what
obstacles are there for a woman rather than for a man? Inwardly, I
think, the case is very different; she has still many ghosts to
fight, many prejudices to overcome. Indeed it will be a long time
still, I think, before a woman can sit down to write a book without
finding a phantom to be slain, a rock to be dashed against. And if
this is so in literature, the freest of all professions for women,
how is it in the new professions which you are now for the first
time entering?</p>

<p>Those are the questions that I should like, had I time, to ask
you. And indeed, if I have laid stress upon these professional
experiences of mine, it is because I believe that they are, though
in different forms, yours also. Even when the path is nominally
open&mdash;when there is nothing to prevent a woman from being a
doctor, a lawyer, a civil servant&mdash;there are many phantoms and
obstacles, as I believe, looming in her way. To discuss and define
them is I think of great value and importance; for thus only can
the labour be shared, the difficulties be solved. But besides this,
it is necessary also to discuss the ends and the aims for which we
are fighting, for which we are doing battle with these formidable
obstacles. Those aims cannot be taken for granted; they must be
perpetually questioned and examined. The whole position, as I see
it&mdash;here in this hall surrounded by women practising for the
first time in history I know not how many different
professions&mdash;is one of extraordinary interest and importance.
You have won rooms of your own in the house hitherto exclusively
owned by men. You are able, though not without great labour and
effort, to pay the rent. You are earning your five hundred pounds a
year. But this freedom is only a beginning&mdash;the room is your
own, but it is still bare. It has to be furnished; it has to be
decorated; it has to be shared. How are you going to furnish it,
how are you going to decorate it? With whom are you going to share
it, and upon what terms? These, I think are questions of the utmost
importance and interest. For the first time in history you are able
to ask them; for the first time you are able to decide for
yourselves what the answers should be. Willingly would I stay and
discuss those questions and answers&mdash;but not to-night. My time
is up; and I must cease.</p>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>33. THOUGHTS ON PEACE IN AN AIR
RAID</h2>

<p class="cpb">(Written in August 1940, for an American symposium
on current matters concerning women.)</p>

<p>The Germans were over this house last night and the night before
that. Here they are again. It is a queer experience, lying in the
dark and listening to the zoom of a hornet which may at any moment
sting you to death. It is a sound that interrupts cool and
consecutive thinking about peace. Yet it is a sound&mdash;far more
than prayers and anthems&mdash;that should compel one to think
about peace. Unless we can think peace into existence we&mdash;-not
this one body in this one bed but millions of bodies yet to be
born&mdash;will lie in the same darkness and hear the same death
rattle overhead. Let us think what we can do to create the only
efficient air-raid shelter while the guns on the hill go pop pop
pop and the searchlights finger the clouds and now and then,
sometimes close at hand, sometimes far away, a bomb drops.</p>

<p>Up there in the sky young Englishmen and young German men are
fighting each other. The defenders are men, the attackers are men.
Arms are not given to Englishwomen either to fight the enemy or to
defend herself. She must lie weaponless to-night. Yet if she
believes that the fight going on up in the sky is a fight by the
English to protect freedom, by the Germans to destroy freedom, she
must fight, so far as she can, on the side of the English. How far
can she fight for freedom without firearms? By making arms, or
clothes or food. But there is another way of fighting for freedom
without arms; we can fight with the mind. We can make ideas that
will help the young Englishman who is fighting up in the sky to
defeat the enemy.</p>

<p>But to make ideas effective, we must be able to fire them off.
We must put them into action. And the hornet in the sky rouses
another hornet in the mind. There was one zooming in <i>The
Times</i> this moming&mdash;a woman's voice saying, "Women have not
a word to say in politics." There is no woman in the Cabinet; nor
in any responsible post. All the idea makers who are in a position
to make ideas effective are men. That is a thought that damps
thinking, and encourages irresponsibility. Why not bury the head in
the pillow, plug the ears, and cease this futile activity of
idea-making? Because there are other tables besides officer tables
and conference tables. Are we not leaving the young Englishman
without a weapon that might be of value to him if we give up
private thinking, tea-table thinking, because it seems useless? Are
we not stressing our disability because our ability exposes us
perhaps to abuse, perhaps to contempt? "I will not cease from
mental fight," Blake wrote. Mental fight means thinking against the
current, not with it.</p>

<p>That current flows fast and furious. It issues in a spate of
words from the loudspeakers and the politicians. Every day they
tell us that we are a free people, fighting to defend freedom. That
is the current that has whirled the young airman up into the sky
and keeps him circling there among the clouds. Down here, with a
roof to cover us and a gas mask handy, it is our business to
puncture gas bags and discover seeds of truth. It is not true that
we are free. We are both prisoners to-night&mdash;he boxed up in
his machine with a gun handy; we lying in the dark with a gas mask
handy. If we were free we should be out in the open, dancing, at
the play, or sitting at the window talking together. What is it
that prevents us? "Hitler!" the loudspeakers cry with one voice.
Who is Hitler? What is he? Aggressiveness, tyranny, the insane love
of power made manifest, they reply. Destroy that, and you will be
free.</p>

<p>The drone of the planes is now like the sawing of a branch
overhead. Round and round it goes, sawing and sawing at a branch
directly above the house. Another sound begins sawing its way in
the brain. "Women of ability"&mdash;it was Lady Astor speaking in
<i>The Times</i> this morning&mdash;"are held down because of a
subconscious Hitlerism in the hearts of men." Certainly we are held
down. We are equally prisoners tonight&mdash;the Englishmen in
their planes, the Englishwomen in their beds. But if he stops to
think he may be killed; and we too. So let us think for him. Let us
try to drag up into consciousness the subconscious Hitlerism that
holds us down. It is the desire for aggression; the desire to
dominate and enslave. Even in the darkness we can see that made
visible. We can see shop windows blazing; and women gazing; painted
women; dressed-up women; women with crimson lips and crimson
fingernails. They are slaves who are trying to enslave. If we could
free ourselves from slavery we should free men from tyranny.
Hitlers are bred by slaves.</p>

<p>A bomb drops. All the windows rattle. The anti-aircraft guns are
getting active. Up there on the hill under a net tagged with strips
of green and brown stuff to imitate the hues of autumn leaves, guns
are concealed. Now they all fire at once. On the nine o'clock radio
we shall be told "Forty-four enemy planes were shot down during the
night, ten of them by anti-aircraft fire." And one of the terms of
peace, the loudspeakers say, is to be disarmament. There are to be
no more guns, no army, no navy, no air force in the future. No more
young men will be trained to fight with arms. That rouses another
mind-hornet in the chambers of the brain&mdash;another quotation.
"To fight against a real enemy, to earn undying honour and glory by
shooting total strangers, and to come home with my breast covered
with medals and decorations, that was the summit of my hope...It
was for this that my whole life so far had been dedicated, my
education, training, everything..."</p>

<p>Those were the words of a young Englishman who fought in the
last war. In the face of them, do the current thinkers honestly
believe that by writing "Disarmament" on a sheet of paper at a
conference table they will have done all that is needful? Othello's
occupation will be gone; but he will remain Othello. The young
airman up in the sky is driven not only by the voices of
loudspeakers; he is driven by voices in himself&mdash;ancient
instincts, instincts fostered and cherished by education and
tradition. Is he to be blamed for those instincts? Could we switch
off the maternal instinct at the command of a table full of
politicians? Suppose that imperative among the peace terms was:
"Child-bearing is to be restricted to a very small class of
specially selected women," would we submit? Should we not say, "The
maternal instinct is a woman's glory. It was for this that my whole
life has been dedicated, my education, training, everything..." But
if it were necessary. for the sake of humanity, for the peace of
the world, that childbearing should be restricted, the maternal
instinct subdued, women would attempt it. Men would help them. They
would honour them for their refusal to bear children. They would
give them other openings for their creative power. That too must
make part of our fight for freedom. We must help the young
Englishmen to root out from themselves the love of medals and
decorations. We must create more honourable activities for those
who try to conquer in themselves their fighting instinct, their
subconscious Hitlerism. We must compensate the man for the loss of
his gun.</p>

<p>The sound of sawing overhead has increased. All the searchlights
are erect. They point at a spot exactly above this roof. At any
moment a bomb may fall on this very room. One, two, three, four,
five, six...the seconds pass. The bomb did not fall. But during
those seconds of suspense all thinking stopped. All feeling, save
one dull dread, ceased. A nail fixed the whole being to one hard
board. The emotion of fear and of hate is therefore sterile,
unfertile. Directly that fear passes, the mind reaches out and
instinctively revives itself by trying to create. Since the room is
dark it can create only from memory. It reaches out to the memory
of other Augusts&mdash;in Bayreuth, listening to Wagner; in Rome,
walking over the Campagna; in London. Friends' voices come back.
Scraps of poetry return. Each of those thoughts, even in memory,
was far more positive, reviving, healing and creative than the dull
dread made of fear and hate. Therefore if we are to compensate the
young man for the loss of his glory and of his gun, we must give
him access to the creative feelings. We must make happiness. We
must free him from the machine. We must bring him out of his prison
into the open air. But what is the use of freeing the young
Englishman if the young German and the young Italian remain
slaves?</p>

<p>The searchlights, wavering across the flat, have picked up the
plane now. From this window one can see a little silver insect
turning and twisting in the light. The guns go pop pop pop. Then
they cease. Probably the raider was brought down behind the hill.
One of the pilots landed safe in a field near here the other day.
He said to his captors, speaking fairly good English, "How glad I
am that the fight is over!" Then an Englishman gave him a
cigarette, and an Englishwoman made him a cup of tea. That would
seem to show that if you can free the man from the machine, the
seed does not fall upon altogether stony ground. The seed may be
fertile.</p>

<p>At last all the guns have stopped firing. All the searchlights
have been extinguished. The natural darkness of a summer's night
returns. The innocent sounds of the country are heard again. An
apple thuds to the ground. An owl hoots, winging its way from tree
to tree. And some half-forgotten words of an old English writer
come to mind: "The huntsmen are up in America..." Let us send these
fragmentary notes to the huntsmen who are up in America, to the men
and women whose sleep has not yet been broken by machine-gun fire,
in the belief that they will rethink them generously and
charitably, perhaps shape them into something serviceable. And now,
in the shadowed half of the world, to sleep.</p>
