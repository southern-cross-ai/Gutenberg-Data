  <br>

  <p class="intro"><i>The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World
  Revolution</i> was published in 1928 by H. G. Wells, when he was 62 years
  old. It was revised and expanded in 1930 with the additional subtitle <i>A
  Second Version of This Faith of a Modern Man Made More Explicit and
  Plain</i>. In 1931 a further revised edition appeared titled <i>What Are We
  to To with Our Lives?</i>* The final version appeared in 1933 under its
  original title. Many of its ideas are anticipated in Wells's 1926 novel
  <i>The World of William Clissold</i>.</p>

  <p class="intro">The book is, in Wells's words, a "scheme to thrust forward
  and establish a human control over the destinies of life and liberate it from
  its present dangers, uncertainties and miseries." It proposes that largely as
  the result of scientific progress, a common vision of a world "politically,
  socially and economically unified" is emerging among educated and influential
  people, and that this can be the basis of "a world revolution aiming at
  universal peace, welfare and happy activity" that can result in the
  establishment of a "world commonweal." This is to be achieved by "drawing
  together a proportion of all or nearly all the functional classes in
  contemporary communities in order to weave the beginnings of a world
  community out of their selection." This will ultimately "be a world
  religion." &mdash; <i>Wikipedia</i></p>

  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first"><i>The Open Conspiracy</i> was Wells' <i>Blue Print for A
  World Revolution</i>; he regarded this book as his finished statement on the
  way the world ought to be ordered. Possibly he underestimated, or ignored,
  the fact that it is often in the interest of subsets of the human race to act
  against other subsets. Moreover the emphasis on religion seems odd, from a
  rationalist.</p>

  <p>After the First World War, observing the lack of knowledge of most people
  about most things, he turned to history, starting, in 1918, his <i>Outline of
  History</i> first published in parts with 'gorgeous' covers, then in 1920 as
  a two-volume work including colour plates of a lavish nature for the time. In
  effect it was jointly authored&mdash;his chapters were sent to collaborators,
  and the resulting multiple corrections reassembled by the duly-chastened
  Wells. A 'popular' one-volume edition appeared in 1930. By the standards of
  its time this was a best-seller. It was praised decades later by A.J.P.
  Taylor as 'still the best introduction to history'. Toynbee had a favourable
  opinion of it. During the 1920s it sparked a controversy with Hilaire Belloc,
  who believed in such things as the 'Fall of Man'. It was also attacked by a
  teacher of Greek. Wells' hopes that school history could be taught in an
  international sense still, of course, have not come to fruition.</p>

  <p>He planned and collaborated a hefty set of volumes on biology, <i>The
  Science of Life</i>, with his own son, and with Julian Huxley; the theme was
  largely evolutionary (<i>The Origin of Species</i> was published only a few
  years before his birth). Huxley, a descendant of T.H. Huxley, regarded Wells
  as something of a Cockney upstart.</p>

  <p>And he wrote a descriptive, rather than analytical, book on economics,
  which includes many ingenious observations but was eclipsed by Keynes'
  <i>General Theory</i> of four years later.</p>

  <p>Some of his books were filmed; his <i>Invisible Man</i> was turned into a
  filmscript by Preston Sturges, who however regarded his books as not very
  filmable and infuriated Wells by making the invisible man mad. Another media
  incident was Orson Welles' radio broadcast of <i>War of the Worlds</i> in
  1938, involving aggressive Martians landing in a location Americanised from
  its original Surrey, and which was reported to have cause mass panic among
  less educated Americans on the eastern seaboard.</p>

  <p>C.P. Snow wrote of Wells that he could 'throw out a phrase that
  crystallised a whole argument', and that he 'never heard anyone remotely in
  the same class.' Among these phrases were 'the War that will end War', coined
  when he worked with the Ministry of Propaganda under Northcliffe during the
  First World War, which he supported, and 'the New World Order', which he
  seemed to be the first to use, or popularise, in a 1940 book of that title.
  His less successful phrases included the 'competent receiver'. He said of
  himself that he 'worked all the time'.</p>

  <p>He was a socialist of an empirical, rather vague, rationalist type,
  disliking Marx and unenthusiastic about the managerial socialism of the
  Webbs.</p>

  <p>His book <i>The Open Conspiracy</i> was published in 1928, subtitled
  <i>Blue Prints for a World Revolution</i>. Bertrand Russell said of this book
  '...I do not know of anything with which I agree more entirely' though since
  this was in a begging letter perhaps he was just being polite. It was revised
  and republished as <i>What Are We to Do with Our Lives?</i> in 1931.</p>

  <p>In this short book, Wells attempts to answer the question: What should
  socialists actually do?&mdash;to which he confessed several times to having
  no very clear idea. It's a counter to Marx: why shouldn't non-proletarians
  unite to change the world?</p>

  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01">I. &mdash; THE PRESENT CRISIS IN HUMAN AFFAIRS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE world is undergoing immense changes. Never before have
  the conditions of life changed so swiftly and enormously as they have changed
  for mankind in the last fifty years. We have been carried along&mdash;with no
  means of measuring the increasing swiftness in the succession of events. We
  are only now beginning to realize the force and strength of the storm of
  change that has come upon us.</p>

  <p>These changes have not come upon our world from without. No meteorite from
  outer space has struck our planet; there have been no overwhelming outbreaks
  of volcanic violence or strange epidemic diseases; the sun has not flared up
  to excessive heat or suddenly shrunken to plunge us into Arctic winter. The
  changes have come through men themselves. Quite a small number of people,
  heedless of the ultimate consequence of what they did, one man here and a
  group there, have made discoveries and produced and adopted inventions that
  have changed all the condition, of social life.</p>

  <p>We are now just beginning to realize the nature of these changes, to find
  words and phrases for them and put them down. First they began to happen, and
  then we began to see that they were happening. And now we are beginning to
  see how these changes are connected together and to get the measure of their
  consequences. We are getting our minds so clear about them that soon we shall
  be able to demonstrate them and explain them to our children in our schools.
  We do not do so at present. We do not give our children a chance of
  discovering that they live in a world of universal change.</p>

  <p>What are the broad lines upon which these alterations of condition are
  proceeding?</p>

  <p>It will be most convenient to deal with them in the order in which they
  came to be realized and seen clearly, rather than by the order in which they
  came about or by their logical order. They are more or less interdependent
  changes; they overlap and interact.</p>

  <p>It was only in the beginning of the twentieth century that people began to
  realize the real significance of that aspect of our changing conditions to
  which the phrase "the abolition of distance" has been applied. For a whole
  century before that there had been a continual increase in the speed and
  safety of travel and transport and the ease and swiftness with which messages
  could be transmitted, but this increase had not seemed to be a matter of
  primary importance. Various results of railway, steamship, and telegraph
  became manifest; towns grew larger, spreading into the countryside, once
  inaccessible lands became areas of rapid settlement and cultivation,
  industrial centres began to live on imported food, news from remote parts
  lost its time-lag and tended to become contemporary, but no one hailed these
  things as being more than "improvements" in existing conditions. They are not
  observed to be the beginnings of a profound revolution in the life of
  mankind. The attention of young people was not drawn to them; no attempt was
  made, or considered necessary, to adapt political and social institutions to
  this creeping enlargement of scale.</p>

  <p>Until the closing years of the nineteenth century there was no recognition
  of the real state of affairs. Then a few observant people began, in a rather
  tentative, commentary sort of way, to call attention to what was happening.
  They did not seem to be moved by the idea that something had to be done about
  it; they merely remarked, brightly and intelligently, that it was going on.
  And then they went on to the realization that this "abolition of distance"
  was only one aspect of much more far-reaching advances.</p>

  <p>Men were travelling about so much faster and flashing their communications
  instantly about the world because a progressive conquest of force and
  substance was going on. Improved transport was only one of a number of
  portentous consequences of that conquest; the first to be conspicuous and set
  men thinking; but not perhaps the first in importance. It dawned upon them
  that in the last hundred years there had been a stupendous progress in
  obtaining and utilizing mechanical power, a vast increase in the efficiency
  of mechanism, and associated with that an enormous increase in the substances
  available for man's purposes, from vulcanized rubber to the modern steels,
  and from petroleum and margarine to tungsten and aluminium. At first the
  general intelligence was disposed to regard these things as lucky "finds,"
  happy chance discoveries. It was not apprehended that the shower of finds was
  systematic and continuous. Popular writers told about these things but they
  told of them at first as "Wonders"&mdash;"Wonders" like the Pyramids, the
  Colossus of Rhodes, and the Great Wall of China. Few realized how much more
  they were than any "Wonders." The "Seven Wonders of the World" left men free
  to go on living, toiling, marrying, and dying as they had been accustomed to
  for immemorial ages. If the "Seven Wonders" had vanished or been multiplied
  three score it would not have changed the lives of any large proportion of
  human beings. But these new powers and substances were modifying and
  transforming&mdash;unobtrusively, surely, and relentlessly&mdash;very
  particular of the normal life of mankind.</p>

  <p>They increased the amount of production and the methods of production.
  They made possible "Big-Business," to drive the small producer and the small
  distributor out of the market. They swept away factories and evoked new ones.
  They changed the face of the fields. They brought into the normal life, thing
  by thing and day by day, electric light and heating, bright cities at night,
  better aeration, new types of clothing, a fresh cleanliness. They changed a
  world where there had never been enough into a world of potential plenty,
  into a world of excessive plenty. It dawned upon their minds after their
  realization of the "abolition of distance" that shortage of supplier had also
  been abolished and that irksome toil was no longer necessary to produce
  everything material that man might require. It is only in the last dozen
  years that this broader and profounder fact has come through to the
  intelligence of any considerable number of people. Most of them have still to
  carry their realization a step farther and see how complete is the revolution
  in the character of the daily life these things involve.</p>

  <p>But there are still other changes outside this vast advance in the pace
  and power of material life. The biological sciences have undergone a
  corresponding extension. Medical art has attained a new level of efficiency,
  so that in all the modernizing societies of the world the average life is
  prolonged, and there is, in spite of a great fall in the birth rate, a
  steady, alarming increase in the world's population. The proportion of adults
  alive is greater than it has ever been before. Fewer and fewer human beings
  die young This has changed the social atmosphere about us. The tragedy of
  lives cut short and ended prematurely is passing out of general experience.
  Health becomes prevalent. The continual toothaches, headaches, rheumatism,
  neuralgias, coughs, colds, indigestions that made up so large a part of the
  briefer lives of our grandfathers and grandmothers fade out of experience. We
  may all live now, we discover, without any great burthen of fear, wholesomely
  and abundantly, for as long as the desire to live is in us.</p>

  <p>But we do not do so. All this possible freedom of movement, this power and
  abundance, remains for most of us no more than possibility. There is a sense
  of profound instability about these achievements of our race. Even those who
  enjoy, enjoy without security, and for the great multitude of mankind there
  is neither ease, plenty, nor freedom. Hard tasks, insufficiency, and unending
  money worries are still the ordinary stuff of life. Over everything human
  hangs the threat of such war as man has never known before, were armed and
  reinforced by all the powers and discoveries of modern science.</p>

  <p>When we demand why the achievement of power turns to distress and danger
  in our hands, we get some very unsatisfactory replies. The favourite
  platitude of the politician excusing himself for the futilities of his
  business, is that "moral progress has not kept pace with material advance."
  That seems to satisfy him completely, but it can satisfy no other intelligent
  person. He says "moral." He leaves that word unexplained. Apparently he wants
  to shift the responsibility to our religious teachers. At the most he has
  made but the vaguest gesture towards a reply. And yet, when we consider it,
  charitably and sympathetically, there does seem to be a germ of reality in
  that phrase of his.</p>

  <p>What does moral mean? Mores means manners and customs. Morality is the
  conduct of life. It is what we do with our social lives. It is how we deal
  with ourselves in relation to our fellow creatures. And there does seem to be
  a much greater discord now than there was (say) a couple of hundred years ago
  between the prevailing ideas of how to carry on life and the opportunities
  and dangers of the time. We are coming to see more and more plainly that
  certain established traditions which have made up the frame of human
  relationships for ages are not merely no longer as convenient as they were,
  but are positively injurious and dangerous. And yet at present we do not know
  how to shake off these traditions, these habits of social behaviour which
  rule us. Still less are we able to state, and still less bring into
  operation, the new conceptions of conduct and obligation that must replace
  them.</p>

  <p>For example, the general government of human affairs has hitherto been
  distributed among a number of sovereign states&mdash;there are about seventy
  of them now&mdash;and until recently that was a quite tolerable system of
  frame-works into which a general way of living could be fitted. The standard
  of living may not have been as high as our present standards, but the social
  stability and assurance were greater. The young were trained to be loyal,
  law-regarding, patriotic, and a defined system of crimes and misdemeanours
  with properly associated pains, penalties, and repressions, kept the social
  body together. Everyone was taught a history glorifying his own state, and
  patriotism was chief among the Virtues. Now, with great rapidity, there has
  been that "abolition of distance," and everyone has become next-door
  neighbour to everyone else. States once separate, social and economic systems
  formerly remote from one another, now jostle each other exasperatingly.
  Commerce under the new conditions is perpetually breaking nationalist bounds
  and making militant raids upon the economic life of other countries. This
  exacerbates patriotism in which we have all been trained and with which we
  are all, with scarcely an exception, saturated. And meanwhile war, which was
  once a comparative slow bickering upon a front, has become war in three
  dimensions; it gets at the "non-combatant" almost as searchingly as at the
  combatant, and has acquired weapons of a stupendous cruelty and
  destructiveness. At present there exists no solution to this paradoxical
  situation. We are continually being urged by our training and traditions to
  antagonisms and conflicts that will impoverish, starve, and destroy both our
  antagonists and ourselves. We are all trained to distrust and hate
  foreigners, salute our flag, stiffen up in a wooden obedient way at our
  national anthem, and prepare to follow the little fellows in spurs and
  feathers who pose as the heads of our states into the most horrible common
  destruction. Our political and economic ideas of living are out of date, and
  we find great difficulty in adjusting them and reconstructing them to meet
  the huge and strenuous demands of the new times. That is really what our
  gramophone politicians have in mind&mdash;in the vague way in which they have
  anything in mind&mdash;when they put on that well-worn record about moral
  progress not having kept pace with material inventions.</p>

  <p>Socially and politically we want a revised system of ideas about conduct,
  a view of social and political life brought up to date. We are not doing the
  effective thing with our lives, we are drifting, we are being hoodwinked and
  bamboozled and misled by those who trade upon the old traditions. It is
  preposterous that we should still be followed about and pestered by war,
  taxed for war preparations, and threatened bodily and in our liberties by
  this unnecessary and exaggerated and distorted survival of the disunited
  world of the pre-scientific era. And it is not simply that our political way
  of living is now no better than an inherited defect and malformation, but
  that our everyday life, our eating and drinking and clothing and housing and
  going about, is also cramped, thwarted, and impoverished, because we do not
  know how to set about shaking off the old ways and fitting the general life
  to our new opportunities. The strain takes the form of increased unemployment
  and a dislocation of spending power. We do not know whether to spend or save.
  Great swarms of us find ourselves unaccountably thrown out of work. Unjustly,
  irrationally. Colossal business reconstructions are made to increase
  production and accumulate profits, and meanwhile the customers with
  purchasing power dwindle in numbers and fade away. The economic machine
  creaks and makes every sign of stopping&mdash;and its stopping means
  universal want and starvation. It must not stop. There must be a
  reconstruction, a change-over. But what sort of a change-over?</p>

  <p>Though none of us are yet clear as to the precise way in which this great
  change-over is to be effected, there is a world-wide feeling now that change-
  over or a vast catastrophe is before us. Increasing multitudes participate in
  that uneasy sense of insecure transition. In the course of one lifetime
  mankind has passed from a state of affairs that seems to us now to have been
  slow, dull, ill-provided, and limited, but at least picturesque and
  tranquil-minded, to a new phase of excitement, provocation, menace, urgency,
  and actual or potential distresses. Our lives are part of one another. We
  cannot get away from it. We are items in a social mass. What are we to do
  with our lives?</p>

  average brain, and the way in which my mind reacts to these problems is
  therefore very much the way in which most brains will react to them. But
  because it is my business to write and think about these questions, because
  on that account I am able to give more time and attention to them than most
  people, I am able to get rather ahead of my equals and to write articles and
  books just a little before the ideas I experience become plain to scores of
  thousands, and then to hundreds of thousands, and at last to millions of
  other people. And so it happened that a few years ago (round about 1927) I
  became very anxious to clear up and give form to a knot of suggestions that
  seemed to me to have in them the solution of this riddle of adapting our
  lives to the immense new possibilities and the immense new dangers that
  confront mankind.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that all over the world intelligent people were waking up
  to the indignity and absurdity of being endangered, restrained, and
  impoverished, by a mere uncritical adhesion to traditional governments,
  traditional ideas of economic life, and traditional forms of behaviour, and
  that these awaking intelligent people must constitute first a protest and
  then a creative resistance to the inertia that was stifling and threatening
  us. These people I imagined would say first, "We are drifting; we are doing
  nothing worth while with our lives. Our lives are dull and stupid and not
  good enough."</p>

  <p>Then they would say, "What are we to do with our lives?"</p>

  <p>And then, "Let us get together with other people of our sort and make over
  the world into a great world-civilization that will enable us to realize the
  promises and avoid the dangers of this new time."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that as, one after another, we woke up, that is what we
  should be saying. It amounted to a protest, first mental and then practical,
  it amounted to a sort of unpremeditated and unorganized conspiracy, against
  the fragmentary and insufficient governments and the wide-spread greed,
  appropriation, clumsiness, and waste that are now going on. But unlike
  conspiracies in general this widening protest and conspiracy against
  established things would, by its very nature, go on in the daylight, and it
  would be willing to accept participation and help from every quarter. It
  would, in fact, become an "Open Conspiracy," a necessary, naturally evolved
  conspiracy, to adjust our dislocated world.</p>

  <p>I made various attempts to develop this idea. I published a little book
  called The Open Conspiracy as early as 1928, into which I put what I had in
  my mind at that time. It was an unsatisfactory little book even when I
  published it, not quite plain enough and not quite confident enough, and
  evidently unsure of its readers. I could not find out how to do it better at
  the time, and it seemed in its way to say something of living and current
  interest, and so I published it&mdash;but I arranged things so that I could
  withdraw it in a year or so. That I did, and this present book is a largely
  rewritten version, much clearer and more explicit. Since that first
  publication we have all got forward surprisingly. Events have hustled thought
  along and have been hustled along by thought. The idea of reorganizing the
  affairs of the world on quite a big scale, which was "Utopian," and so forth,
  in 1926 and 1927, and still "bold" in 1928, has now spread about the world
  until nearly everybody has it. It has broken out all over the place, thanks
  largely to the mental stimulation of the Russian Five Year Plan. Hundreds of
  thousands of people everywhere are now thinking upon the lines foreshadowed
  by my Open Conspiracy, not because they had ever heard of the book or phrase,
  but because that was the way thought was going.</p>

  <p>The first Open Conspiracy conveyed the general idea of a world
  reconstructed, but it was very vague about the particular way in which this
  or that individual life could be lived in relation to that general idea. It
  gave a general answer to the question, "What are we to do with our lives?" It
  said, "Help to make over the New World amidst the confusions of the Old." But
  when the question was asked, "What am I to do with my life?" the reply was
  much less satisfactory.</p>

  <p>The intervening years of thought and experience make it possible, now, to
  bring this general idea of a reconstructive effort, an attempt to build up a
  new world within the dangers and disharmonies of our present state, into a
  much closer and more explicit relation to the individual "Open Conspirator."
  We can present the thing in a better light and handle it with a surer
  touch.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03">III. &mdash; WE HAVE TO CLEAR AND CLEAN UP OUR
     MINDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Now, one thing is fairly plain to most of us who are waking
  up to the need of living our lives in a new way and of making over the state,
  which is the framework of our lives, to meet the new demands upon it, and
  that is, that we have to put our own minds in order. Why have we only
  awakened now to the crisis in human affairs. The changes in progress have
  been going on with a steady acceleration for a couple of centuries. Clearly
  we must all have been very unobservant, our knowledge as it came to us must
  have been very badly arranged in our minds, and our way of dealing with it
  must have been cloudy and muddled, or else we should surely have awakened
  long ago to the immense necessities that now challenge us. And if that is so,
  if it has taken decades to rouse us, then quite probably we are not yet
  completely awake. Even now we may not have realized the job before us in its
  completeness. We may still have much to get plain in our minds, and we
  certainly have much more to learn. One primary and permanent duty therefore
  is to go on with our thinking and to think as well as we can about the way in
  which we think and about the ways in which we get and use knowledge.</p>

  <p>Fundamentally the Open Conspiracy must be an intellectual rebirth.</p>

  <p>Human thought is still very much confused by the imperfection of the words
  and other symbols it employs and the consequences of this confused thinking
  are much more serious and extensive than is commonly realized. We still see
  the world through a mist of words; it is only the things immediately about us
  that are plain fact. Through symbols, and especially through words, man has
  raised himself above the level of the ape and come to a considerable mastery
  over his universe. But every step in his mental ascent has involved
  entanglement with these symbols and words he was using; they were at once
  helpful and very dangerous and misleading. A great part of our affairs,
  social, political, intellectual, is in a perplexing and dangerous state
  to-day because of our loose, uncritical, slovenly use of words.</p>

  <p>All through the later Middle Ages there were great disputes among the
  schoolmen about the use of words and symbols. There is a queer disposition in
  the human mind to think that symbols and words and logical deductions are
  truer than actual experiences, and these great controversies were due to the
  struggle of the human intelligence against that disposition. On the one side
  were the Realists, who were so called because they believed, in effect, that
  names were more real than facts, and on the other side were the Nominalists,
  who from the first were pervaded by a suspicion about names and words
  generally; who thought there might be some sort of catch in verbal processes,
  and who gradually worked their way towards verification by experiment which
  is the fundamental thing about experimental science&mdash;experimental
  science which has given our human world all these immense powers and
  possibilities that tempt and threaten it to-day. These controversies of the
  schoolmen were of the utmost importance to mankind. The modern world could
  not begin to come into existence until the human mind had broken away from
  the narrow-minded verbalist way of thinking which the Realists followed.</p>

  <p>But all through my education I never had this matter explained to me. The
  University of London intimated that I was a soundly educated young man by
  giving me a degree in first-class honours and the liberty to acquire and wear
  an elegant gown and hood, and the London College of Preceptors gave me and
  the world its highest assurances that I was fit to educate and train the
  minds of my fellow creatures, and yet I had still to discover that a Realist
  was not a novelist who put rather too highly flavoured sex appeal into his
  books, and a Nominalist, nothing in particular. But it had crept into my mind
  as I learnt about individuality in my biological work and about logic and
  psychology in my preparation as the perfect preceptor, that something very
  important and essential was being left out and that I wasn't at all as well
  equipped as my diplomas presently said I was, and in the next few years I
  found the time to clean up this matter pretty thoroughly. I made no
  marvellous discoveries, everything I found out was known already;
  nevertheless, I had to find out some of this stuff for myself quite over
  again, as though it had never been done; so inaccessible was any complete
  account of human thinking to an ordinary man who wanted to get his mind into
  proper working condition. And this was not that I had missed some recondite,
  precious refinements of philosophy; it was that my fundamental thinking, at
  the very root of my political and social conduct, was wrong. I was in a human
  community, and that community, and I with it, was thinking of phantoms and
  fantasies as though they were real and living things, was in a reverie of
  unrealities, was blind, slovenly, hypnotized, base and ineffective,
  blundering about in an extremely beautiful and an extremely dangerous
  world.</p>

  <p>I set myself to re-educate myself, and after the practice of writers wrote
  it in various trial pamphlets, essays, and books. There is no need to refer
  to these books here. The gist of the matter is set out in three compilations,
  to which I shall refer again almost immediately. They are The Outline of
  History (Ch. XXI, § 6, and Ch. XXXIII, § 6), The Science of Life (Book VIII,
  on Thought and Behaviour) and The Work, Wealth, and Happiness of Mankind (Ch.
  II, § § 1-4). In the last, it is shown quite plainly how man has had to
  struggle for the mastery of his mind, has discovered only after great
  controversies the proper and effective use of his intellectual tools, and has
  had to learn to avoid certain widespread traps and pitfalls before he could
  achieve his present mastery over matter. Thinking clearly and effectively
  does not come by nature. Hunting the truth is an art. We blunder naturally
  into a thousand misleading generalizations and false processes. Yet there is
  hardly any intelligent mental training done in the schools of the world
  to-day. We have to learn this art, if we are to practise it at all. Our
  schoolteachers have had no proper training themselves, they miseducate by
  example and precept, and so it is that our press and current discussions are
  more like an impromptu riot of crippled and deaf and blind minds than an
  intelligent interchange of ideas. What bosh one reads! What rash and impudent
  assumptions! What imbecile inferences!</p>

  <p>But re-educating oneself, getting one's mind into health and exercising it
  and training it to think properly, is only the beginning of the task before
  the awakening Open Conspirator. He has not only to think clearly, but he has
  to see that his mind is equipped with the proper general ideas to form a true
  framework for his everyday judgments and decisions.</p>

  <p>It was the Great War first brought home to me how ignorant I was, and how
  ill-finished and untidy my mind, about the most important things of life.
  That disastrous waste of life, material and happiness, since it was
  practically world wide, was manifestly the outcome of the processes that
  constitute the bulk of history, and yet I found I did not know&mdash;and
  nobody else seemed to know&mdash;history in such a fashion as to be able to
  explain how the Great War came about or what ought to come out of it.
  "Versailles," we all seem to be agreed nowadays, was silly, but how could
  Versailles be anything else than what it was in view of the imperfect,
  lopsided, historical knowledge and the consequent suspicion, emotion, and
  prejudice of those who assembled there. They did not know any better than the
  rest of us what the war was, and so how could they know what the peace ought
  to be? I perceived that I was in the same case with everyone else, and I set
  myself first of all for my own guidance to make a summary if all history and
  get some sort of map to more serviceable conclusions about the political
  state of mankind. This summary I made was The Outline of History, a shameless
  compilation and arrangement of the main facts of the world story, written
  without a touch of art or elegance, written indeed in a considerable hurry
  and excitement, and its sale, which is now in the third million, showed how
  much I had in common with a great dispersed crowd of ordinary people, all
  wanting to know, all disgusted with the patriotic, litigious twaddling
  gossipy stuff given them as history by their schoolmasters and
  schoolmistresses which had led them into the disaster of the war.</p>

  <p>The Outline of History is not a whole history of life. Its main theme is
  the growth of human intercommunication and human communities and their rulers
  and conflicts, the story of how and why the myriads of little tribal systems
  of ten thousand years ago have fought and coalesced into the sixty- or
  seventy-odd governments of to-day and are now straining and labouring in the
  grip of forces that must presently accomplish their final unison. And even as
  I completed The Outline, I realized that there remained outside its scope
  wider and more fundamental, and closer, more immediate fields of knowledge
  which I still had to get in order for my own practical ends and the ends of
  like-minded people who wanted to use their lives effectively, if my existence
  was to escape futility.</p>

  <p>I realized that I did not know enough about the life in my body and its
  relations to the world of life and matter outside it to come to proper
  decisions about a number of urgent matters&mdash;from race conflicts, birth
  control, and my private life, to the public control of health and the
  conservation of natural resources. And also, I found, I was astonishingly
  ignorant about the everyday business of life, the how and why of the miner
  who provided the coal to cook my dinner, and the banker who took my money in
  return for a cheque-book, and the shopkeeper from whom I bought things, and
  the policeman who kept the streets in order for me. Yet I was voting for laws
  affecting my relations with these people, paying them directly or indirectly,
  airing my ignorant opinions about them, and generally contributing by my
  behaviour to sustain and affect their lives.</p>

  <p>So with the aid and direction of two very competent biologists I set to
  work to get out as plain and clear a statement as possible of what was known
  about the sources and nature of life and the relation of species to
  individuals and to other species, and the processes of consciousness and
  thought. This I published as The Science of Life. And while this was going on
  I set myself to the task of making a review of all human activities in
  relation to each other, the work of people and the needs of people,
  cultivation, manufacture, trade, direction, government, and all. This was the
  most difficult part of this attempt to get a rational account of the modern
  world, and it called for the help and counsel of a great variety of people. I
  had to ask and find some general answer to the question, "What are the
  nineteen hundred-odd million human beings who are alive to-day doing, and how
  and why are they doing it?" It was, in fact, an outline of economic, social,
  and political science, but since, after The Outline of History, the word
  "outline" has been a good deal cheapened by various enterprising publishers,
  I have called it, The Work, Wealth, and Happiness of Mankind.</p>

  <p>Now, I find, by getting these three correlated compilations into
  existence, I have at last, in however rough a fashion, brought together a
  complete system of ideas upon which an Open Conspirator can go. Before anyone
  could hope to get on to anything like a practical working directive answer to
  "What are we to do with our lives?" it was necessary to know what our lives
  were&mdash;The Science of Life; what had led up to their present
  pattern&mdash;The Outline of History; and this third book, to tell what we
  were actually doing and supposed to be doing with our working lives, day by
  day, at the present time. By the time I was through with these books I felt I
  had really something sound and comprehensive to go upon, an "ideology," as
  people say, on which it was possible to think of building a new world without
  fundamental surprises, and, moreover, that I had got my mind stripped down
  and cleaned of many illusions and bad habits, so that it could handle life
  with an assurance it had never known before.</p>

  <p>There is nothing marvellous about these compilations of mine. Any steady
  writer of average intelligence with the same will and the same resources, who
  could devote about nine or ten years to the task and get the Proper sort of
  help, could have made them. It can be done, it is no doubt being done, all
  over again by other people, for themselves and perhaps for others, much more
  beautifully and adequately. But to get that amount of vision and knowledge,
  to achieve that general arrangement and understanding, was a necessary
  condition that had to be satisfied before any answer to the question, "What
  are we to do with our lives?" could even be attempted, and before one could
  become in any effective way an Open Conspirator.</p>

  <p>There is nothing indispensable even now, I repeat, about these three
  particular books. I know about them and refer to them because I put them
  together myself and so they are handy for me to explain myself. But most of
  what they contain can be extracted from any good encyclopædia. Any number of
  people have made similar outlines of history for themselves, have read
  widely, grasped the leading principles of biology and grappled with the
  current literature of business science and do not in the least need my
  particular summary. So far as history and biology are concerned there are
  parallel books, that are as good and serviceable. Van Loon's books for
  example. Yet even for highly-educated people these summaries may be useful in
  bringing things known with different degrees of thoroughness, into a general
  scheme. They correlate, and they fill up gaps. Between them they cover the
  ground; and in some fashion that ground has to be covered before the mind of
  a modern citizen is prepared to tackle the problems that confront it.
  Otherwise he is an incapable citizen, he does not know where he is and where
  the world is, and if he is rich or influential he may be a very dangerous
  citizen indeed. Presently there will be far better compilations to meet this
  need, or perhaps the gist of all the three divisions of knowledge,
  concentrated and made more lucid and attractive, may be available as the
  intellectual frame of modern education throughout the world, as a "General
  Account of Life" that should be given to everyone.</p>

  <p>But certainly no one can possibly set about living properly and
  satisfactorily unless he knows what he is, where he is, and how he stands to
  the people and things about him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap04"
     name="chap04">IV. &mdash; THE REVOLUTION IN EDUCATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOME sort of reckoning therefore between people awakened to
  the new world that dawns about us and the schools, colleges, and machinery of
  formal education is overdue. As a body the educated are getting nothing like
  that Account of Life which is needed to direct our conduct in this modern
  world.</p>

  <p>It is the crowning absurdity in the world to-day that these institutions
  should go through a solemn parade of preparing the new generation for life
  and that then, afterwards, a minority of their victims, finding this
  preparation has left them almost totally unprepared, should have of their own
  accord to struggle out of our world heap of starved and distorted minds to
  some sort of real education. The world cannot be run by such a minority of
  escaped and re-educated minds alone, with all the rest of the heap against
  them. Our necessities demand the intelligence and services of everyone who
  can be trained to give them. The new world demands new schools, therefore, to
  give everyone a sound and thorough mental training and equip everyone with
  clear ideas about history, about life, and about political and economic
  relationships instead of the rubbishy head-content at present prevalent. The
  old-world teachers and schools have to be reformed or replaced. A vigorous
  educational reform movement arises as a natural and necessary expression of
  the awakening Open Conspirator. A revolution in education is the most
  imperative and fundamental part of the adaptation of life to its new
  conditions.</p>

  <p>These various compendia of knowledge constituting a Modern Account of
  Life, on which we have laid stress in the previous section, these supplements
  to teaching, which are now produced and read outside the established formal
  educational world and in the teeth of its manifest hostility) arise because
  of the backwardness of that world, and as that world yields slowly but surely
  to the pressure of the new spirit, so they will permeate and replace its
  text-books and disappear as a separate class of book. The education these new
  dangerous times in which we are now living demands, must start right, from
  the beginning and there must be nothing to replace and nothing to relearn in
  it. Before we can talk politics, finance, business, or morals, we must see
  that we have got the right mental habits and the right foundation of realized
  facts. There is nothing much to be done with our lives until we have seen to
  that.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05">V. &mdash; RELIGION IN THE NEW WORLD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"YES," objects a reader, "but does not our religion tell us
  what we are to do with our lives?"</p>

  <p>We have to bring religion, as its fundamental matter, into this
  discussion. From our present point of view, religion is that central
  essential part of education which determines conduct. Religion certainly
  should tell us what to do with our lives. But in the vast stir and occasions
  of modern life, so much of what we call religion remains irrelevant or dumb.
  Religion does not seem to "join on" to the main parts of the general problem
  of living. It has lost touch.</p>

  <p>Let us try and bring this problem of the Open Conspiracy to meet and make
  the new world, into relation with the traditions of religion. The clear-minded
  Open Conspirator who has got his modern ideology, his lucidly arranged
  account of the universe in order, is obliged to believe that only by giving
  his life to the great processes of social reconstruction, and shaping his
  conduct with reference to that, can he do well with his life. But that merely
  launches him into the most subtle and unending of struggles, the struggle
  against the incessant gravitation of our interests to ourselves. He has to
  live the broad life and escape from the close narrow life. We all try to
  attain the dignity and happiness of magnanimity and escape from the
  tormenting urgencies of personal desire. In the past that struggle has
  generally assumed the form of a religious struggle. Religion is the
  antagonist of self.</p>

  <p>In their completeness, in the life that was professionally religious,
  religions have always demanded great subordinations of self. Therein lay
  their creative force. They demanded devotion and gave reasons for that
  demand. They disentangled the will from the egotistical preoccupations, often
  very completely. There is no such thing as a self-contained religion, a
  private religious solo. Certain forms of Protestantism and some mystical
  types come near to making religion secluded duet between the individual and
  his divinity, but here that may be regarded as a perversion of the religious
  impulse. Just as the normal sexual complex excites and stirs the individual
  out of his egotism to serve the ends of the race, so the normal religious
  process takes the individual out of his egotism for the service of the
  community. It is not a bargain, a "social contract," between the individual
  and the community; it is a subordination of both the existing individual and
  the existing community in relation to something, a divinity, a divine order,
  a standard, a righteousness, more important than either. What is called in
  the phraseology of certain religions "conviction of sin" and "the flight from
  the City of Destruction" are familiar instances of this reference of the
  self-centred individual and the current social life to something far better
  than either the one or the other.</p>

  <p>This is the third element in the religious relationship, a hope, a
  promise, an objective which turns the convert not only from himself but from
  the "world," as it is, towards better things. First comes self disregard then
  service, and then this reconstructive creative urgency.</p>

  <p>For the finer sort of mind this aspect of religion seems always to have
  been its primary attraction. One has to remember that there is a real will
  for religion scattered throughout mankind&mdash;a real desire to get away
  from self. Religion has never pursued its distinctive votaries; they have
  come to meet it. The desire to give oneself to greater ends than the everyday
  life affords, and to give oneself freely, is clearly dominant in that
  minority, and traceable in an incalculable proportion of the majority.</p>

  <p>But hitherto religion has never been presented simply as a devotion to a
  universal cause. The devotion has always been in it, but it has been
  complicated by other considerations. The leaders in every great religious
  movement have considered it necessary that it should explain itself in the
  form of history and a cosmogony. It has been felt necessary to say Why? and
  To what end? Every religion therefore has had to adopt the physical
  conceptions, and usually also to assume many of the moral and social values,
  current at the time of its formation. It could not transcend the
  philosophical phrases and attitudes that seemed then to supply the natural
  frame for a faith, nor draw upon anything beyond the store of scientific
  knowledge of its time. In this lurked the seeds of the ultimate decay and
  supersession of every successive religion.</p>

  <p>But as the idea of continual change, going farther and farther from
  existing realities and never returning to them, is a new one, as nobody until
  very recently has grasped the fact that the knowledge of today is the
  ignorance of to-morrow, each fresh development of religion in the world so
  far has been proclaimed in perfect good faith as the culminating and final
  truth.</p>

  <p>This finality of statement has considerable immediate practical value. The
  suggestion of the possibility of further restatement is an unsettling
  suggestion; it undermines conviction and breaks the ranks of the believers,
  because there are enormous variations in the capacities of men to recognize
  the same spirit under a changing shape. These variations cause endless
  difficulties to-day. While some intelligences can recognize the same God
  under a variety of names and symbols without any severe strain, others cannot
  even detect the most contrasted Gods one from the other provided they wear
  the same mask and title It appears a perfectly natural and reasonable thing
  to many minds to restate religion now in terms of biological and
  psychological necessity, while to others any variation whatever in the
  phrasing of the faith seems to be nothing less than atheistical
  misrepresentations of the most damnable kind. For these latter God a God
  still anthropomorphic enough to have a will and purpose to display
  preferences and reciprocate emotions, to be indeed in person, must be
  retained until the end of time. For others, God can be thought of as a Great
  First Cause, as impersonal and inhuman as atomic structure.</p>

  <p>It is because of the historical and philosophical commitments they have
  undertaken, and because of concessions made to common human weaknesses in
  regard to such once apparently minor but now vital moral issues as property,
  mental activity, and public veracity&mdash;rather than of any inadequacy in
  their adaptation to psychological needs&mdash;that the present wide discredit
  of organized religions has come about. They no longer seem even roughly
  truthful upon issues of fact, and they give no imperatives over large fields
  of conduct in which perplexity is prevalent. People will say, "I could be
  perfectly happy leading the life of a Catholic devotee if only I could
  believe." But most of the framework of religious explanation upon which that
  life is sustained is too old-fashioned and too irrelevant to admit of that
  thoroughness of belief which is necessary for the devotion of intelligent
  people.</p>

  <p>Great ingenuity has been shown by modern writers and thinkers in the
  adaptation of venerated religious expressions to new ideas. Peccavi. [Usu.
  translated 'I have sinned'&mdash;RW] Have I not written of the creative will
  in humanity as "God the Invisible King" and presented it in the figure of a
  youthful and adventurous finite god?</p>

  <p>The word "God" is in most minds so associated with the concept of religion
  that it is abandoned only with the greatest reluctance. The word remains,
  though the idea is continually attenuated. Respect for Him demands that He
  should have no limitations. He is pushed farther and farther from actuality,
  therefore, and His definition becomes increasingly a bundle of negations,
  until at last, in His rôle of The Absolute, He becomes an entirely negative
  expression. While we can speak of good, say some, can speak of God. God is
  the possibility of goodness, the good side of things. If phrases in which the
  name of God is used are to be abandoned, they argue, religion will be left
  speechless before many occasions.</p>

  <p>Certainly there is something beyond the individual that is and the world
  that is; on that we have already insisted as a characteristic of all
  religions; that persuasion is the essence of faith and the key to courage.
  But whether that is to be considered, even after the most strenuous exercises
  in personification, as a greater person or a comprehensive person, is another
  matter. Personality is the last vestige of anthropomorphism. The modern urge
  to a precise veracity is against such concessions to traditional
  expression.</p>

  <p>On the other hand there is in many fine religious minds a desire amounting
  almost to a necessity for an object of devotion so individualized as to be
  capable at least of a receptive consciousness even if no definite response is
  conceded. One type of mind can accept a reality in itself which another must
  project and dramatize before it can comprehend it and react to it. The human
  soul is an intricate thing which will not endure elucidation when that passes
  beyond a certain degree of harshness and roughness. The human spirit has
  learnt love, devotion, obedience and humility in relation to other
  personalities, and with difficulty it takes the final step to a transcendent
  subordination, from which the last shred of personality has stripped.</p>

  <p>In matters not immediately material, language has to work by metaphors,
  and though every metaphor carries its own peculiar risks of confusion, we
  cannot do without them. Great intellectual tolerance is necessary, therefore
  --a cultivated disposition --to translate and retranslate from one
  metaphysical or emotional idiom to another&mdash;if there is not to be a
  deplorable wastage of moral force in our world. Just now I wrote Peccavi
  because I had written God the Invisible King, but after all I do not think it
  was so much a sin to use that phrase, God the Invisible King, as an error in
  expression. If there is no sympathetic personal leader outside us, there is
  at least in us the attitude we should adopt towards a sympathetic personal
  leader.</p>

  <p>Three profound differences between the new mental dispositions of the
  present time and those of preceding ages have to be realized if current
  developments of the religious impulse are to be seen in their correct
  relationship to the religious life of the past. There has been a great
  advance in the analysis of psychic processes and the courage with which men
  have probed into the origins of human thought and feeling. Following upon the
  biological advances that have made us recognize fish and amphibian in the
  bodily structure of man, have come these parallel developments in which we
  see elemental fear and lust and self-love moulded, modified, and exalted,
  under the stress of social progress, into intricate human motives. Our
  conception of sin and our treatment of sin have been profoundly modified by
  this analysis. Our former sins are seen as ignorances, inadequacies and bad
  habits, and the moral conflict is robbed of three-fourths of its ego-centred
  melodramatic quality. We are no longer moved to be less wicked; we are moved
  to organize our conditioned reflexes and lead a life less fragmentary and
  silly.</p>

  <p>Secondly, the conception of individuality has been influenced and relaxed
  by biological thought, so that we do not think so readily of the individual
  contra mundum as our fathers did. We begin to realize that we are egotists by
  misapprehension. Nature cheats the self to serve the purposes of the species
  by filling it with wants that war against its private interests. As our eyes
  are opened to these things, we see ourselves as beings greater or less than
  the definitive self. Man's soul is no longer his own. It is, he discovers,
  part of a greater being which lived before he was born and will survive him.
  The idea of a survival of the definite individual with all the accidents and
  idiosyncrasies of his temporal nature upon him dissolves to nothing in this
  new view of immortality.</p>

  <p>The third of the main contrasts between modern and former thought which
  have rendered the general shapes of established religion old-fashioned and
  unserviceable is a reorientation of current ideas about time. The powerful
  disposition of the human mind to explain everything as the inevitable
  unfolding of a past event which, so to speak, sweeps the future helplessly
  before it, has been checked by a mass of subtle criticisms. The conception of
  progress as a broadening and increasing purpose, a conception which is taking
  hold of the human imagination more and more firmly, turns religious life
  towards the future. We think no longer of submission to the irrevocable
  decrees of absolute dominion, but of participation in an adventure on behalf
  of a power that gains strength and establishes itself. The history of our
  world, which has been unfolded to us by science, runs counter to all the
  histories on which religions have been based. There was no Creation in the
  past, we begin to realize, but eternally there is creation; there was no Fall
  to account for the conflict of good and evil, but a stormy ascent. Life as we
  know it is a mere beginning.</p>

  <p>It seems unavoidable that if religion is to develop unifying and directive
  power in the present confusion of human affairs it must adapt itself to this
  forward-looking, individuality-analyzing turn of mind; it must divest itself
  of its sacred histories, its gross preoccupations, its posthumous
  prolongation of personal ends. The desire for service, for subordination, for
  permanent effect, for an escape from the distressful pettiness and mortality
  of the individual life, is the undying element in every religious system.</p>

  <p>The time has come to strip religion right down to that, to strip it for
  greater tasks than it has ever faced before. The histories and symbols that
  served our fathers encumber and divide us. Sacraments and rituals harbour
  disputes and waste our scanty emotions. The explanation of why things are is
  an unnecessary effort in religion. The essential fact in religion is the
  desire for religion and not how it came about. If you do not want religion,
  no persuasions, no convictions about your place in the universe can give it
  to you. The first sentence in the modern creed must be, not "I believe," but
  "I give myself."</p>

  <p>To what? And how? To these questions we will now address ourselves.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06">VI. &mdash; MODERN RELIGION IS OBJECTIVE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">To give oneself religiously is a continuing operation
  expressed in a series of acts. It can be nothing else. You cannot dedicate
  yourself and then go away to live just as you have lived before. It is a poor
  travesty of religion that does not produce an essential change in the life
  which embraces it. But in the established and older religions of our race,
  this change of conduct has involved much self-abasement merely to the God or
  Gods, or much self-mortification merely with a view to the moral perfecting
  of self. Christian devotion, for example, in these early stages, before the
  hermit life gave place to organized monastic life, did not to any extent
  direct itself to service except the spiritual service of other human beings.
  But as Christianity became a definite social organizing force, it took on a
  great series of healing, comforting, helping, and educational activities.</p>

  <p>The modern tendency has been and is all in the direction of minimizing
  what one might call self-centred devotion and self-subjugation, and of
  expanding and developing external service. The idea of inner perfectibility
  dwindles with the diminishing importance attached to individuality. We cease
  to think of mortifying or exalting or perfecting ourselves and seek to lose
  ourselves in a greater life. We think less and less of "conquering" self and
  more and more of escaping from self. If we attempt to perfect ourselves in
  any respect it is only as a soldier sharpens and polishes an essential
  weapon.</p>

  <p>Our quickened apprehension of continuing change, our broader and fuller
  vision of the history of life, disabuse our minds of many limitations set to
  the imaginations of our predecessors. Much that they saw as fixed and
  determinate, we see as transitory and controllable. They saw life fixed in
  its species and subjected to irrevocable laws. We see life struggling
  insecurely but with a gathering successfulness for freedom and power against
  restriction and death. We see life coming at last to our tragic and hopeful
  human level. Unprecedented possibilities, mighty problems, we realize,
  confront mankind to-day. They frame our existences. The practical aspect, the
  material form, the embodiment of the modernized religious impulse is the
  direction of the whole life to the solution of these problems and the
  realization of their possibilities. The alternative before man now is either
  magnificence of spirit and magnificence of achievement, or disaster.</p>

  <p>The modern religious life, like all forms of religious life, must needs
  have its own subtle and deep inner activities, its meditations, its self-
  confrontations, its phases of stress and search and appeal, its serene and
  prayerful moods, but these inward aspects do not come into the scope of this
  present inquiry, which is concerned entirely with the outward shape, the
  direction, and the organization of modern religious effort, with the question
  of what, given religious devotion, we have to do and how that has to be
  done.</p>

  <p>Now, in the new and greater universe to which we are awakening, its
  immense possibilities furnish an entirely new frame and setting for the moral
  life. In the fixed and limited outlook of the past, practical good works took
  the form mainly of palliative measures against evils that were conceived of
  as incurable; the religious community nursed the sick, fed the hungry,
  provided sanctuary for the fugitive, pleaded with the powerful for mercy. It
  did not dream of preventing sickness, famine, or tyranny. Other-worldliness
  was its ready refuge from the invincible evil and confusion of the existing
  scheme of things.</p>

  <p>But it is possible now to imagine an order in human affairs from which
  these evils have been largely or entirely eliminated. More and more people
  are coming to realize that such an order is a material possibility. And with
  the realization that this is a material possibility, we can no longer be
  content with a field of "good deeds" and right action restricted to
  palliative and consolatory activities. Such things are merely "first aid."
  The religious mind grows bolder than it has ever been before. It pushes
  through the curtain it once imagined was a barrier. It apprehends its larger
  obligations. The way in which our activities conduce to the realization of
  that conceivable better order in human affairs, becomes the new criterion of
  conduct. Other-worldliness has become unnecessary.</p>

  <p>The realization of this possible better order brings us at once to certain
  definite lines of conduct. We have to make an end to war, and to make an end
  to war we must be cosmopolitan in our politics. It is impossible for any
  clear-headed person to suppose that the ever more destructive stupidities of
  war can be eliminated from human affairs until some common political control
  dominates the earth, and unless certain pressures due to the growth of
  population, due to the enlarging scope of economic operations or due to
  conflicting standards and traditions of life, are disposed of.</p>

  <p>To avoid the positive evils of war and to attain the new levels of
  prosperity and power that now come into view, an effective world control, not
  merely of armed force, but of the production and main movements of staple
  commodities and the drift and expansion of population is required. It is
  absurd to dream of peace and world-wide progress without that much control.
  These things assured the abilities and energies of a greatly increased
  proportion of human beings could be diverted to the happy activities of
  scientific research and creative work, with an ever-increasing release and
  enlargement of human possibility. On the political side it is plain that our
  lives must be given to the advancement of that union.</p>

  <p>Such a forward stride in human life, the first stride in a mighty
  continuing advance, an advance to which no limit appears, is now not simply
  materially possible. It is urgent. The opportunity is plain before mankind.
  It is the alternative to social decay. But there is no certainty, no material
  necessity, that it should ever be taken. It will not be taken by mankind
  inadvertently. It can only be taken through such an organization of will and
  energy to take it as this world has never seen before.</p>

  <p>These are the new imperatives that unfold themselves before the more alert
  minds of our generation. They will presently become the general mental
  background, as the modern interpretations of the history of life and of the
  material and mental possibilities about us establish themselves. Evil
  political, social, and economic usages and arrangements may seem obdurate and
  huge, but they are neither permanent nor uncontrollable. They can be
  controlled, however, only by an effort more powerful and determined than the
  instincts and inertias that sustain them. Religion, modern and disillusioned,
  has for its outward task to set itself to the control and direction of
  political, social, and economic life. If it does not do that, then it is no
  more than a drug for easing discomfort, "the opium of the peoples."</p>

  <p>Can religion, or can it not, synthesize the needed effort to lift mankind
  out of our present disorders, dangers, baseness, frustrations, and futilities
  to a phase of relative security, accumulating knowledge, systematic and
  continuing growth in power and the widespread, deep happiness of hopeful and
  increasing life?</p>

  <p>Our answer here is that the religious spirit, in the light of modern
  knowledge, can do this thing, and our subject now is to enquire what are the
  necessary opening stages in the synthesis of that effort. We write, from this
  point onward, for those who believe that it can, and who do already grasp the
  implications of world history and contemporary scientific achievement.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07">VII. &mdash; WHAT MANKIND HAS TO DO</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BEFORE we can consider the forms and methods of attacking
  this inevitable task of reconstruction it will be well to draw the main lines
  and to attempt some measure of the magnitude of that task. What are the new
  forms that it is thus proposed to impose upon human life, and how are they to
  be evolved from or imposed upon the current forms? And against what passive
  and active resistances has this to be done?</p>

  <p>There can be no pause for replacement in the affairs of life. Day must
  follow day, and the common activities continue. The new world as a going
  concern must arise out of the old as a going concern.</p>

  <p>Now the most comprehensive conception of this new world is of one
  politically, socially, and economically unified. Within that frame fall all
  the other ideas of our progressive ambition. To this end we set our faces and
  seek to direct our lives. Many there are at present who apprehend it as a
  possibility but do not dare, it seems, to desire it, because of the enormous
  difficulties that intervene, and because they see as yet no intimations of a
  way through or round these difficulties. They do not see a way of escape from
  the patchwork of governments that grips them and divides mankind. The great
  majority of human beings have still to see the human adventure as one whole;
  they are obsessed by the air of permanence and finality in established
  things; they accept current reality as ultimate reality. As the saying goes,
  they take the world as they find it.</p>

  <p>But here we are writing for the modern-minded, and for them it is
  impossible to think of the world as secure and satisfactory until there
  exists a single world commonweal, preventing war and controlling those moral,
  biological, and economic forces and wastages that would otherwise lead to
  wars. And controlling them in the sense that science and man's realization
  and control of his powers and possibilities continually increase.</p>

  <p>Let us make clear what sort of government we are trying to substitute for
  the patchwork of to-day. It will be a new sort of direction with a new
  psychology. The method of direction of such a world commonweal is not likely
  to imitate the methods of existing sovereign states. It will be something new
  and altogether different.</p>

  <p>This point is not yet generally realized. It is too often assumed that the
  world commonweal will be, as it were, just the one heir and survivor of
  existing states, and that it will be a sort of megatherium of the same form
  and anatomy as its predecessors.</p>

  <p>But a little reflection will show that this is a mistake. Existing states
  are primarily militant states, and a world state cannot be militant. There
  will be little need for president or king to lead the marshalled hosts of
  humanity, for where there is no war there is no need of any leader to lead
  hosts anywhere, and in a polyglot world a parliament of mankind or any sort
  of council that meets and talks is an inconceivable instrument of government.
  The voice will cease to be a suitable vehicle. World government, like
  scientific process, will be conducted by statement, criticism, and
  publication that will be capable of efficient translation.</p>

  <p>The fundamental organization of contemporary states is plainly still
  military, and that is exactly what a world organization cannot be. Flags,
  uniforms, national anthems, patriotism sedulously cultivated in church and
  school, the brag, blare, and bluster of our competing sovereignties, belong
  to the phase of development the Open Conspiracy will supersede. We have to
  get clear of that clutter. The reasonable desire of all of us is that we
  should have the collective affairs of the world managed by suitably equipped
  groups of the most interested, intelligent, and devoted people, and that
  their activities should be subjected to a free, open, watchful criticism,
  restrained from making spasmodic interruptions but powerful enough to modify
  or supersede without haste or delay whatever is weakening or unsatisfactory
  in the general direction.</p>

  <p>A number of readers will be disposed to say that this is a very vague,
  undefined, and complicated conception of world government. But indeed it is a
  simplification. Not only are the present governments of the world a
  fragmentary competitive confusion, but none of them is as simple as it
  appears. They seem to be simple because they have formal heads and definite
  forms, councils, voting assemblies, and so forth, for arriving at decisions.
  But the formal heads, the kings, presidents, and so forth, are really not the
  directive heads. They are merely the figure heads. They do not decide. They
  merely make gestures of potent and dignified acquiescence when decisions are
  put to them. They are complicating shams. Nor do the councils and assemblies
  really decide. They record, often very imperfectly and exasperatingly, the
  accumulating purpose of outer forces. These outer really directive forces are
  no doubt very intricate in their operation; they depend finally on religious
  and educational forms and upon waves of gregarious feeling, but it does not
  in the least simplify the process of collective human activity to pretend
  that it is simple and to set up symbols and dummies in the guise of rulers
  and dictators to embody that pretence. To recognize the incurable intricacy
  of collective action is a mental simplification; to remain satisfied with the
  pretensions of existing governmental institutions, and to bring in all the
  problems of their procedure and interaction is to complicate the
  question.</p>

  <p>The present rudimentary development of collective psychology obliges us to
  be vague and provisional about the way in which the collective mind may best
  define its will for the purpose of administrative action. We may know that a
  thing is possible and still be unable to do it as yet, just as we knew that
  aviation was possible in 1900. Some method of decision there must certainly
  be and a definite administrative machinery. But it may turn out to be a much
  slighter, less elaborate organization than a consideration of existing
  methods might lead us to imagine. It may never become one single interlocking
  administrative system. We may have systems of world control rather than a
  single world state. The practical regulations, enforcements, and officials
  needed to keep the world in good health, for example may be only very loosely
  related to the system of controls that will maintain its communications in a
  state of efficiency. Enforcement and legal decisions, as we know them now,
  may be found to be enormously and needlessly cumbrous by our descendants. As
  the reasonableness of a thing is made plain, the need for its enforcement is
  diminished, and the necessity for litigation disappears.</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy, the world movement for the supercession or
  enlargement or fusion of existing political, economic, and social
  institutions must necessarily, as it grows, draw closer and closer to
  questions of practical control. It is likely in its growth to incorporate
  many active public servants and many industrial and financial leaders and
  directors. It may assimilate great masses of intelligent workers. As its
  activities spread it will work out a whole system of special methods of
  co-operation. As it grows, and by growing, it will learn the business of
  general direction and how to develop its critical function. A lucid,
  dispassionate, and immanent criticism is the primary necessity, the living
  spirit of a world civilization. The Open Conspiracy is essentially such a
  criticism, and the carrying out of such a criticism into working reality is
  the task of the Open Conspiracy. It will by its very nature be aiming not so
  much to set up a world direction, as to become itself a world direction, and
  the educational and militant forms of its opening phase will evoke, step by
  step, as experience is gained and power and responsibility acquired, forms of
  administration and research and correlation.</p>

  <p>The differences in nature and function between the world controls of the
  future and the state governments of the present age which we have just
  pointed out favours a hope that the Open Conspiracy may come to its own in
  many cases rather by the fading out of these state governments through the
  inhibition and paralysis of their destructive militant and competitive
  activities than by a direct conflict to overthrow them. As new world controls
  develop, it becomes the supreme business of the Open Conspiracy to keep them
  world wide and impartial, to save them by an incessant critical educational
  and propagandist activity from entanglement with the old traditional
  rivalries and feuds of states and nations. It is quite possible that such
  world controls should be able to develop independently, but it is highly
  probable, on the other hand, that they will continue to be entangled as they
  are to-day, and that they will need to be disengaged with a struggle. We
  repeat, the new directive organizations of men's affairs will not be of the
  same nature as old-fashioned governments. They will be in their nature
  biological, financial, and generally economic, and the old governments were
  primarily nothing of the sort. Their directive force will be (1) an effective
  criticism having the quality of science, and (2) the growing will in men to
  have things right. The directive force of the older governments was the
  uncriticized fantasies and wilfulness of an individual, a class, a tribe, or
  a majority.</p>

  <p>The modernization of the religious impulse leads us straight to this
  effort for the establishment of the world state as a duty, and the close
  consideration of the necessary organization of that effort will bring the
  reader to the conclusion that a movement aiming at the establishment of a
  world directorate, however restricted that movement may be at first in
  numbers and power, must either contemplate the prospect of itself developing
  into a world directorate, and by the digestion and assimilation of superseded
  factors into an entire modern world community, or admit from the outset the
  futility, the spare-time amateurishness, of its gestures.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08">VIII. &mdash; BROAD CHARACTERISTICS OF A SCIENTIFIC WORLD
     COMMONWEAL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CONTINUING our examination of the practical task before the
  modern mind, we may next note the main lines of contemporary aspiration
  within this comprehensive outline of a world commonweal. Any sort of
  unification of human affairs will not serve the ends we seek. We aim at a
  particular sort of unification; a world Caesar is hardly better from the
  progressive viewpoint than world chaos; the unity we seek must mean a
  world-wide liberation of thought, experiment and creative effort.</p>

  <p>A successful Open Conspiracy merely to seize governments and wield and
  retain world power would be at best only the empty frame of success. It might
  be the exact reverse of success. Release from the threat of war and from the
  waste of international economic conflicts is a poor release if it demands as
  its price the loss of all other liberties.</p>

  <p>It is because we desire a unification of human direction, not simply for
  the sake of unity, but as a means of release to happiness and power, that it
  is necessary, at any cost&mdash;in delay, in loss of effective force, in
  strategic or tactical disadvantage&mdash;that the light of free, abundant
  criticism should play upon that direction and upon the movements and unifying
  organizations leading to the establishment of that unifying direction.</p>

  <p>Man is an imperfect animal and never quite trustworthy in the dark.
  Neither morally nor intellectually is he safe from lapses. Most of us who are
  past our first youth know how little we can trust ourselves and glad to have
  our activities checked and guarded by a sense of helpful inspection. It is
  for this reason that a movement to realize the conceivable better state of
  the world must deny itself the advantages of secret methods and tactical
  insincerities. It must leave that to its adversaries. We must declare our end
  plainly from the outset and risk no misunderstandings of our procedure.</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy against the traditional and now cramping and dangerous
  institutions of the world must be an Open Conspiracy and cannot remain
  righteous otherwise. It is lost if it goes underground. Every step to world
  unity must be taken in the daylight with the understanding sympathy of as
  many people as possible, or the sort of unity that will be won will be found
  to be scarcely worth the winning. The essential task would have to be
  recommenced again within the mere frame of unity thus attained.</p>

  <p>This candid attempt to take possession of the whole world, this Open
  Conspiracy of ours, must be made in the name of and for the sake of science
  and creative activity. Its aim is to release science and creative activity
  and every stage in the struggle must be watched and criticized, lest there be
  any sacrifice of these ends to the exigencies of conflict.</p>

  <p>The security of creative progress and creative activity implies a
  competent regulation of the economic life in the collective interest. There
  must be food, shelter and leisure for all. The fundamental needs of the
  animal life must be assured before human life can have free play. Man does
  not live by bread alone; he eats that he may learn and adventure creatively,
  but unless he eats he cannot adventure. His life is primarily economic, as a
  house is primarily a foundation, and economic justice and efficiency must
  underlie all other activities; but to judge human society and organize
  political and social activities entirely on economic grounds is to forget the
  objectives of life's campaign in a preoccupation with supply.</p>

  <p>It is true that man, like the animal world in general from which he has
  risen, is the creature of a struggle for sustenance, but unlike the animals,
  man can resort to methods of escape from that competitive pressure upon the
  means of subsistence, which has been the lot of every other animal species.
  He can restrain the increase in his numbers, and he seems capable of still
  quite undefined expansions of his productivity per head of population. He can
  escape therefore from the struggle for subsistence altogether with a surplus
  of energy such as no other kind of animal species has ever possessed.
  Intelligent control of population is a possibility which puts man outside
  competitive processes that have hitherto ruled the modification of species,
  and he can be released from these processes in no other way.</p>

  <p>There is a clear hope that, later, directed breeding will come within his
  scope, but that goes beyond his present range of practical achievement, and
  we need not discuss it further here. Suffice it for us here that the world
  community of our desires, the organized world community conducting and
  ensuring its own progress, requires a deliberate collective control of
  population as a primary condition.</p>

  <p>There is no strong instinctive desire for multitudinous offspring, as
  such, in the feminine make-up. The reproductive impulses operate indirectly.
  Nature ensures a pressure of population through passions and instincts that,
  given sufficient knowledge, intelligence, and freedom on the part of women,
  can be satisfactorily gratified and tranquillized, if need be, without the
  production of numerous children. Very slight adjustments in social and
  economic arrangements will, in a world of clear available knowledge and
  straightforward practice in these matters, supply sufficient inducement or
  discouragement to affect the general birth rate or the birth rate of specific
  types as the directive sense of the community may consider desirable. So long
  as the majority of human beings are begotten involuntarily in lust and
  ignorance so long does man remain like any other animal under the moulding
  pressure of competition for subsistence. Social and political processes
  change entirely in their character when we recognize the possibility and
  practicability of this fundamental revolution in human biology.</p>

  <p>In a world so relieved, the production of staple necessities presents a
  series of problems altogether less distressful than those of the present
  scramble for possessions and self-indulgence on the part of the successful,
  and for work and a bare living on the part of the masses. With the increase
  of population unrestrained, there was, as the end of the economic process, no
  practical alternative to a multitudinous equality at the level of bare
  subsistence, except through such an inequality of economic arrangements as
  allowed a minority to maintain a higher standard of life by withholding
  whatever surplus of production it could grasp, from consumption in mere
  proletarian breeding. In the past and at present, what is called the
  capitalist system, that is to say the unsystematic exploitation of production
  by private owners under the protection of the law, has, on the whole, in
  spite of much waste and conflict, worked beneficially by checking that
  gravitation to a universal low-grade consumption which would have been the
  inevitable outcome of a socialism oblivious of biological processes. With
  effective restraint upon the increase of population, however, entirely new
  possibilities open out before mankind.</p>

  <p>The besetting vice of economic science, orthodox and unorthodox alike, has
  been the vice of beginning in the air, with current practice and current
  convictions, with questions of wages, prices, values, and possession, when
  the profounder issues of human association are really not to be found at all
  on these levels. The primary issues of human association are biological and
  psychological, and the essentials of economics are problems in applied
  physics and chemistry. The first thing we should examine is what we want to
  do with natural resources, and the next, how to get men to do what has to be
  done as pleasurably and effectively as possible. Then we should have a
  standard by which to judge the methods of to-day.</p>

  <p>But the academic economists, and still more so Marx and his followers,
  refuse to deal with these fundamentals, and, with a stupid pose of sound
  practical wisdom, insist on opening up their case with an uncritical
  acceptance of the common antagonism of employers and employed and a long
  rigmarole about profits and wages. Ownership and expropriated labour are only
  one set of many possible sets of economic method.</p>

  <p>The economists, however, will attend seriously only to the current set;
  the rest they ignore; and the Marxists, with their uncontrollable disposition
  to use nicknames in the place of judgments, condemn all others as
  "Utopian"&mdash;a word as final in its dismissal from the minds of the elect
  as that other pet counter in the Communist substitute for thought,
  "Bourgeois." If they can persuade themselves that an idea or a statement is
  "Utopian" or "Bourgeois," it does not seem to matter in the least to them
  whether it is right or wrong. It is disposed of. Just as in genteeler circles
  anything is disposed of that can be labelled "atheistical", "subversive" or
  "disloyal."</p>

  <p>If a century and a half ago the world had submitted its problems of
  transport to the economists, they would have put aside, with as little wasted
  breath and ink as possible, all talk about railways, motorcars, steamships,
  and aeroplanes, and, with a fine sense of extravagance rebuked, set
  themselves to long neuralgic dissertations, disputations, and treatises upon
  highroads and the methods of connecting them, turnpike gates, canals,
  influence of lock fees on bargemen, tidal landing places, anchorages, surplus
  carrying capacity, carriers, caravans, hand-barrows, and the pedestrianariat.
  There would have been a rapid and easy differentiation in feeling and
  requirements between the horse-owning minority and the walking majority; the
  wrongs of the latter would have tortured the mind of every philosopher who
  could not ride, and been minimized by every philosopher who could; and there
  would have been a broad rift between the narrow-footpath school, the
  no-footpath school, and the school which would look forward to a time when
  every horse would have to be led along one universal footpath under the
  dictatorship of the pedestrianariat. All with the profoundest gravity and
  dignity. These things, footpaths and roads and canals with their traffic,
  were "real," and "Utopian" projects for getting along at thirty or forty
  miles an hour or more uphill and against wind and tide, let alone the still
  more incredible suggestion of air transport, would have been smiled and
  sneered out of court. Life went about on its with a certain assistance from
  wheels, or floated, rowed and was blown about on water; so it had
  been&mdash;and so it would always be.</p>

  <p>The psychology of economic co-operation is still only dawning, and so the
  economists and the doctrinaire socialists have had the freest range for
  pedantry and authoritative pomp. For a hundred years they have argued and
  argued about "rent," about "surplus value," and so on, and have produced a
  literature ten thousand times as bulky, dreary, and foolish as the worst
  outpourings of the mediaeval schoolmen.</p>

  <p>But as soon as this time-honoured preoccupation with the allotment of the
  shares of originators, organizers, workers, owners of material, credit
  dealers, and tax collectors in the total product, ceases to be dealt with as
  the primary question in economics; as soon as we liberate our minds from a
  preoccupation which from the outset necessarily makes that science a squabble
  rather than a science, and begin our attack upon the subject with a survey of
  the machinery and other productive material required in order that the staple
  needs of mankind should be satisfied, if we go on from that to consider the
  way in which all this material and machinery can be worked and the product
  distributed with the least labour and the greatest possible satisfaction, we
  shift our treatment of economic questions towards standards by which all
  current methods of exploitation, employment, and finance can be judged rather
  than wrangled over. We can dismiss the question of the claims of this sort of
  participant or that, for later and subordinate consideration, and view each
  variety of human assistance in the general effort entirely from the
  standpoint of what makes that assistance least onerous and most
  effective.</p>

  <p>The germs of such really scientific economics exist already in the study
  of industrial organization and industrial psychology. As the science of
  industrial psychology in particular develops, we shall find all this
  discussion of ownership, profit, wages, finance, and accumulation, which has
  been treated hitherto as the primary issues of economics, falling into place
  under the larger enquiry of what conventions in these matters, what system of
  money and what conceptions of property, yield the greatest stimulus and the
  least friction in that world-wide system of co-operation which must
  constitute the general economic basis to the activities of a unified
  mankind.</p>

  <p>Manifestly the supreme direction of the complex of human economic
  activities in such a world must centre upon a bureau of information and
  advice, which will take account of all the resources of the planet, estimate
  current needs, apportion productive activities and control distribution. The
  topographical and geological surveys of modern civilized communities, their
  government maps, their periodic issue of agricultural and industrial
  statistics, are the first crude and unco-ordinated beginnings of such an
  economic world intelligence. In the propaganda work of David Lubin, a pioneer
  whom mankind must not forget, and in his International Institute of
  Agriculture in Rome, there were the beginnings of an impartial review month
  by month and year by year of world production, world needs and world
  transport. Such a great central organization of economic science would
  necessarily produce direction; it would indicate what had best be done here,
  there, and everywhere, solve general tangles, examine, approve and initiate
  fresh methods and arrange the transitional process from old to new. It would
  not be an organization of will, imposing its will upon a reluctant or
  recalcitrant race; it would be a direction, just as a map is a direction.</p>

  <p>A map imposes no will on anyone, breaks no one in to its "policy." And yet
  we obey our maps.</p>

  <p>The will to have the map full, accurate, and up to date, and the
  determination to have its indications respected, would have to pervade the
  whole community. To nourish and sustain that will must be the task not of any
  particular social or economic division of the community, but of the whole
  body of right-minded people in that community. The organization and
  preservation of that power of will is the primary undertaking, therefore, of
  a world revolution aiming at universal peace, welfare and happy activity. And
  through that will it will produce as the central organ the brain of the
  modern community, a great encyclopædic organization, kept constantly up to
  date and giving approximate estimates and directions for all the material
  activities of mankind.</p>

  <p>The older and still prevalent conception of government is bullying, is the
  breaking-in and subjugation of the "subject," to the God, or king, or lords
  of the community. Will-bending, the overcoming of the recalcitrant junior and
  inferior, was an essential process in the establishment of primitive
  societies, and its tradition still rules our education and law. No doubt
  there must be a necessary accommodation of the normal human will to every
  form of society; no man is innately virtuous; but compulsion and restraint
  are the friction of the social machine and, other things being equal, the
  less compulsive social arrangements are, the more willingly, naturally, and
  easily they are accepted, the less wasteful of moral effort and the happier
  that community will be. The ideal state, other things being equal, is the
  state with the fewest possible number of will fights and will suppressions.
  This must be a primary consideration in arranging the economic, biological,
  and mental organization of the world community at which we aim.</p>

  <p>We have advanced the opinion that the control of population pressure is
  practicable without any violent conflict with "human nature," that given a
  proper atmosphere of knowledge and intention, there need be far less
  suppression of will in relation to production than prevails to-day. In the
  same way, it is possible that the general economic life of mankind may be
  made universally satisfactory that there may be an abundance out of all
  comparison greater than the existing supply of things necessary for human
  well-being, freedom, and activity, with not merely not more, but infinitely
  less subjugation and enslavement than now occurs. Man is still but half born
  out of the blind struggle for existence, and his nature still partakes of the
  infinite wastefulness of his mother Nature. He has still to learn how to
  price the commodities he covets in terms of human life. He is indeed only
  beginning to realize that there is anything to be learnt in that matter. He
  wastes will and human possibility extravagantly in his current economic
  methods.</p>

  <p>We know nowadays that the nineteenth century expended a great wealth of
  intelligence upon a barren controversy between Individualism and Socialism.
  They were treated as mutually exclusive alternatives, instead of being
  questions of degree. Human society has been is and always must be an
  intricate system of adjustments between unconditional liberty and the
  disciplines and subordinations of co-operative enterprise. Affairs do not
  move simply from a more individualist to a more socialist state or vice
  versa; there may be a release of individual initiative going on here and
  standardization or restraint increasing there. Personal property never can be
  socially guaranteed as the extremer individualists desired, nor can it be
  "abolished" as the extremer socialists proposed. Property is not robbery, as
  Proudhon asserted; it is the protection of things against promiscuous and
  mainly wasteful use. Property is not necessarily personal. In some cases
  property may restrict or forbid a use of things that could be generally
  advantageous, and it may be and is frequently unfair in its assignment of
  initiative, but the remedy for that is not an abolition but a revision of
  property. In the concrete it is a form necessary for liberty of action upon
  material, while abstracted as money, which is a liquidated generalized form
  of property; it is a ticket for individual liberty of movement and individual
  choice of reward.</p>

  <p>The economic history of mankind is a history of the operation of the idea
  of property; it relates the conflict of the unlimited acquisitiveness of
  egoistic individuals against the resentment of the disinherited and
  unsuccessful and the far less effective consciousness of a general welfare.
  Money grew out of a system of abstracting conventions and has been subjected
  to a great variety of restrictions, monopolizations, and regulations. It has
  never been an altogether logical device, and it has permitted the most
  extensive and complex developments of credit, debt, and dispossession. All
  these developments have brought with them characteristic forms of misuse and
  corruption. The story is intricate, and the tangle of relationships, of
  dependence, of pressure, of interception, of misdirected services, crippling
  embarrassments, and crushing obligations in which we live to-day admits of no
  such simple and general solutions as many exponents of socialism, for
  example, seem to consider possible.</p>

  <p>But the thought and investigations of the past century or so have made it
  clear that a classification of property, according to the nature of the
  rights exercisable and according to the range of ownership involved, must be
  the basis of any system of social justice in the future.</p>

  <p>Certain things, the ocean, the air, rare wild animals, must be the
  collective property of all mankind and cannot be altogether safe until they
  are so regarded, and until some concrete body exists to exercise these
  proprietary rights. Whatever collective control exists must protect these
  universal properties, the sea from derelicts, the strange shy things of the
  wild from extermination by the hunter and the foolish collector. The
  extinction of many beautiful creatures is one of the penalties our world is
  paying for its sluggishness in developing a collective common rule. And there
  are many staple things and general needs that now also demand a unified
  control in the common interest. The raw material of the earth should be for
  all, not to be monopolized by any acquisitive individual or acquisitive
  sovereign state, and not to be withheld from exploitation for the general
  benefit of any chance claims to territorial priority of this or that backward
  or bargaining person or tribe.</p>

  <p>In the past, most of these universal concerns have had to be left to the
  competitive enterprise of profit-seeking individuals because there were as
  yet no collectivities organized to the pitch of ability needed to develop and
  control these concerns, but surely nobody in his senses believes that the
  supply and distribution of staple commodities about the earth by
  irresponsible persons and companies working entirely for monetary gain is the
  best possible method from the point of view of the race as a whole. The land
  of the earth, all utilizable natural products, have fallen very largely under
  the rules and usages of personal property because in the past that was the
  only recognized and practicable form of administrative proprietorship. The
  development both of extensive proprietary companies and of government
  departments with economic functions has been a matter of the last few
  centuries, the development, that is to say, of communal, more or less
  impersonal ownership, and it is only through these developments that the idea
  of organized collectivity of proprietorship has become credible.</p>

  <p>Even in quite modern state enterprises there is a tendency to recall the
  rôle of the vigilant, jealous, and primitive personal proprietor in the
  fiction of ownership by His Majesty the King. In Great Britain, for example,
  Georgius Rex is still dimly supposed to hover over the Postmaster General of
  his Post Office, approve, disapprove, and call him to account. But the Postal
  Union of the world which steers a registered letter from Chile to Norway or
  from Ireland to Pekin is almost completely divorced from the convention of an
  individual owner. It works; it is criticized without awe or malice. Except
  for the stealing and steaming of letters practised by the political police of
  various countries, it works fairly well. And the only force behind it to keep
  it working well is the conscious common sense of mankind.</p>

  <p>But when we have stipulated for the replacement of individual private
  ownership by more highly organized forms of collective ownership, subject to
  free criticism and responsible to the whole republic of mankind, in the
  general control of sea and land, in the getting, preparation, and
  distribution of staple products and in transport, we have really named all
  the possible generalizations of concrete ownership that the most socialistic
  of contemporaries will be disposed to demand. And if we add to that the
  necessary maintenance of a money system by a central world authority upon a
  basis that will make money keep faith with the worker who earns it, and
  represent from first to last for him the value in staple commodities he was
  given to understand it was to have, and if we conceive credit adequately
  controlled in the general interest by a socialized world banking
  organization, we shall have defined the entire realm from which individual
  property and unrestricted individual enterprise have been excluded. Beyond
  that, the science of social psychology will probably assure us that the best
  work will be done for the world by individuals free to exploit their
  abilities as they wish. If the individual landowner or mineral-owner
  disappears altogether from the world, he will probably be replaced over large
  areas by tenants with considerable security of tenure, by householders and by
  licensees under collective proprietors. It will be the practice, the
  recognized best course, to allow the cultivator to profit as fully as
  possible by his own individual productivity and to leave the householder to
  fashion his house and garden after his own desire.</p>

  <p>Such in the very broadest terms is the character of the world commonweal
  towards which the modern imagination is moving, so far as its direction and
  economic life are concerned. The organization of collective bodies capable of
  exercising these wider proprietorships, which cannot be properly used in the
  common interest by uncorrelated individual owners, is the positive practical
  problem before the intelligent portion of mankind to-day. The nature of such
  collective bodies is still a series of open questions, even upon such points
  as whether they will be elected bodies or groups deriving their authority
  from other sanctions. Their scope and methods of operation, their relations
  to one another and to the central bureau of intelligence, remain also to be
  defined. But before we conclude this essay we may be able to find precisions
  for at least the beginning of such definition.</p>

  <p>Nineteenth-century socialism in its various forms, including the highly
  indurated formulae of communism, has been a series of projects for the
  establishment of such collective controls, for the most part very sketchy
  projects from which the necessary factor of a sound psychological analysis
  was almost completely wanting. Primarily movements of protest and revolt
  against the blazing injustices arising out of the selfishly individualistic
  exploitation of the new and more productive technical and financial methods
  of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they have been apt to go beyond
  the limits of reasonable socialization in their demands and to minimize
  absurdly the difficulties and dangers of collective control. Indignation and
  impatience were their ruling moods, and if they constructed little they
  exposed much. We are better able to measure the magnitude of the task before
  us because of the clearances and lessons achieved by these pioneer
  movements.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09">IX. &mdash; NO STABLE UTOPIA IS NOW CONCEIVABLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THIS unified world towards which the Open Conspiracy would
  direct its activities cannot be pictured for the reader as any static and
  stereotyped spectacle of happiness. Indeed, one may doubt if such a thing as
  happiness is possible without steadily changing conditions involving
  continually enlarging and exhilarating opportunities. Mankind, released from
  the pressure of population, the waste of warfare and the private
  monopolization of the sources of wealth, will face the universe with a great
  and increasing surplus of will and energy. Change and novelty will be the
  order of life; each day will differ from its predecessor in its great
  amplitude of interest. Life which was once routine, endurance, and mischance
  will become adventure and discovery. It will no longer be "the old, old
  story."</p>

  <p>We have still barely emerged from among the animals in their struggle for
  existence. We live only in the early dawn of human self-consciousness and in
  the first awakening of the spirit of mastery. We believe that the persistent
  exploration of our outward and inward worlds by scientific and artistic
  endeavour will lead to developments of power and activity upon which at
  present we can set no limits nor give any certain form.</p>

  <p>Our antagonists are confusion of mind, want of courage, want of curiosity
  and want of imagination, indolence, and spendthrift egotism. These are the
  enemies against which the Open Conspiracy arrays itself; these are the
  jailers of human freedom and achievement.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; THE OPEN CONSPIRACY IS NOT TO BE<br>
  THOUGHT OF AS A SINGLE ORGANIZATION; IT IS A<br>
  CONCEPTION OF LIFE OUT OF WHICH EFFORTS,<br>
  ORGANIZATIONS, AND NEW ORIENTATIONS WILL ARISE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THIS open and declared intention of establishing a world
  order out of the present patchwork of particularist governments, of effacing
  the militarist conceptions that have hitherto given governments their typical
  form, and of removing credit and the broad fundamental processes of economic
  life out of reach of private profit-seeking and individual monopolization,
  which is the substance of this Open Conspiracy to which the modern religious
  mind must necessarily address its practical activities, cannot fail to arouse
  enormous opposition. It is not a creative effort in a clear field; it is a
  creative effort that can hardly stir without attacking established things. It
  is the repudiation of drift, of "leaving things alone." It criticizes
  everything in human life from the top to the bottom and finds everything not
  good enough. It strikes at the universal human desire to feel that things are
  "all right."</p>

  <p>One might conclude, and it would be a hasty, unsound conclusion, that the
  only people to whom we could look for sympathy and any passionate energy in
  forwarding the revolutionary change would be the unhappy, the discontented,
  the dispossessed, and the defeated in life's struggle. This idea lies at the
  root of the class-war dogmas of the Marxists, and it rests on an entirely
  crude conception of human nature. The successful minority is supposed to have
  no effective motive but a desire to retain and intensify its advantages. A
  quite imaginary solidarity to that end is attributed to it, a preposterous,
  base class activity. On the other hand, the unsuccessful
  mass&mdash;"proletariat"&mdash;is supposed to be capable of a clear
  apprehension of its disadvantages, and the more it is impoverished and
  embittered, the clearer-minded it becomes, and the nearer draws its uprising,
  its constructive "dictatorship," and the Millennium.</p>

  <p>No doubt a considerable amount of truth is to be found in this theory of
  the Marxist revolution. Human beings, like other animals, are disposed to
  remain where their circumstances are tolerable and to want change when they
  are uncomfortable, and so a great proportion of the people who are "well off"
  want little or no change in present conditions, particularly those who are
  too dull to be bored by an unprogressive life, while a great proportion of
  those who actually feel the inconveniences of straitened means and population
  pressure, do. But much vaster masses of the rank and file of humanity are
  accustomed to inferiority and dispossession, they do not feel these things to
  the extent even of desiring change, or even if they do feel their
  disadvantages, they still fear change more than they dislike their
  disadvantages. Moreover, those who are sufficiently distressed to realize
  that "something ought to be done about it" are much more disposed to childish
  and threatening demands upon heaven and the government for redress and
  vindictive and punitive action against the envied fortunate with whom they
  happen to be in immediate contact, than to any reaction towards such complex,
  tentative, disciplined constructive work as alone can better the lot of
  mankind. In practice Marxism is found to work out in a ready resort to
  malignantly destructive activities, and to be so uncreative as to be
  practically impotent in the face of material difficulties. In Russia,
  where&mdash;in and about the urban centres, at least&mdash;Marxism has been
  put to the test, the doctrine of the Workers' Republic remains as a unifying
  cant, a test of orthodoxy of as little practical significance there as the
  communism of Jesus and communion with Christ in Christendom, while beneath
  this creed a small oligarchy which has attained power by its profession does
  its obstinate best, much hampered by the suspicion and hostility of the
  Western financiers and politicians, to carry on a series of interesting and
  varyingly successful experiments in the socialization of economic life. Here
  we have no scope to discuss the N.E.P. and the Five Year Plan. They are dealt
  with in The Work, Wealth, and Happiness of Mankind. Neither was properly
  Communist. The Five Year Plan is carried out as an autocratic state
  capitalism. Each year shows more and more clearly that Marxism and Communism
  are divagations from the path of human progress and that the line of advance
  must follow a course more intricate and less flattering to the common
  impulses of our nature.</p>

  <p>The one main strand of truth in the theory of social development woven by
  Marx and Engels is that successful, comfortable people are disposed to
  dislike, obstruct and even resist actively any substantial changes in the
  current patchwork of arrangements, however great the ultimate dangers of that
  patchwork may be or the privations and sufferings of other people involved in
  it. The one main strand of error in that theory is the facile assumption that
  the people at a disadvantage will be stirred to anything more than chaotic
  and destructive expressions of resentment. If now we reject the error and
  accept the truth, we lose the delusive comfort of belief in that magic giant,
  the Proletariat, who will dictate, arrange, restore, and create, but we clear
  the way for the recognition of an élite of intelligent, creative-minded
  people scattered through the whole community, and for a study of the method
  of making this creative element effective in human affairs against the
  massive oppositions of selfishness and unimaginative self-protective
  conservatism.</p>

  <p>Now, certain classes of people such as thugs and burglars seem to be
  harmful to society without a redeeming point about them, and others, such as
  racecourse bookmakers, seem to provide the minimum of distraction and
  entertainment with a maximum of mischief. Wilful idlers are a mere burthen on
  the community. Other social classes again, professional soldiers, for
  example, have a certain traditional honourableness which disguises the
  essentially parasitic relationship of their services to the developing modern
  community. Armies and armaments are cancers produced by the malignant
  development of the patriotic virus under modern conditions of exaggeration
  and mass suggestion. But since there are armies prepared to act coercively in
  the world to-day, it is necessary that the Open Conspiracy should develop
  within itself the competence to resist military coercion and combat and
  destroy armies that stand in the way of its emergence. Possibly the first two
  types here instanced may be condemned as classes and excluded as classes from
  any participation in the organized effort to recast the world, but quite
  obviously the soldier cannot. The world commonweal will need its own
  scientific methods of protection so long as there are people running about
  the planet with flags and uniforms and weapons, offering violence to their
  fellow men and interfering with the free movements of commodities in the name
  of national sovereignty.</p>

  <p>And when we come to the general functioning classes, landowners,
  industrial organizers, bankers, and so forth, who control the present system,
  such as it is, it should be still plainer that it is very largely from the
  ranks of these classes, and from their stores of experience and traditions of
  method, that the directive forces of the new order must emerge. The Open
  Conspiracy can have nothing to do with the heresy that the path of human
  progress lies through an extensive class war.</p>

  <p>Let us consider, for example, how the Open Conspiracy stands to such a
  complex of activities, usages, accumulations, advantages as constitutes the
  banking world. There are no doubt many bankers and many practices in banking
  which make for personal or group advantage to the general detriment. They
  forestall, monopolize, constrain, and extort, and so increase their riches.
  And another large part of that banking world follows routine and established
  usage; it is carrying on and keeping things going, and it is neither inimical
  nor conducive to the development of a progressive world organization of
  finance. But there remains a residuum of original and intelligent people in
  banking or associated with banking or mentally interested in banking, who do
  realize that banking plays a very important, interesting part in the world's
  affairs, who are curious about their own intricate function and disposed
  towards a scientific investigation of its origins, conditions, and future
  possibilities. Such types move naturally towards the Open Conspiracy. Their
  enquiries carry them inevitably outside the bankers' habitual field to an
  examination of the nature, drift, and destiny of the entire economic
  process.</p>

  <p>Now the theme of the preceding paragraph might be repeated with variations
  through a score of paragraphs in which appropriate modifications would adapt
  it to the industrial organizer, the merchant and organizer of transport, the
  advertiser, the retail distributor, the agriculturalist, the engineer, the
  builder, the economic chemist, and a number of other types functional in the
  contemporary community. In all we should distinguish firstly a base and
  harmful section, then a mediocre section following established usage, and
  lastly, an active, progressive section to whom we turn naturally for
  developments leading towards the progressive world commonweal of our desires.
  And our analysis might penetrate further than separation into types of
  individuals. In nearly every individual instance we should find a mixed
  composition, a human being of fluctuating moods and confused purposes,
  sometimes base, sometimes drifting with the tide and sometimes alert and
  intellectually and morally quickened. The Open Conspiracy must be content to
  take a fraction of a man, as it appeals to fractions of many classes, if it
  cannot get him altogether.</p>

  <p>This idea of drawing together a proportion of all or nearly all the
  functional classes in contemporary communities in order to weave the
  beginnings of a world community out of their selection is a fairly obvious
  one&mdash;and yet it has still to win practical recognition. Man is a
  morbidly gregarious and partisan creature; he is deep in his immediate
  struggles and stands by his own kind because in so doing he defends himself;
  the industrialist is best equipped to criticize his fellow industrialist, but
  he finds the root of all evil in the banker; the wages worker shifts the
  blame for all social wrongs on the "employing class." There is an element of
  exasperation in most economic and social reactions, and there is hardly a
  reforming or revolutionary movement in history which is not essentially an
  indiscriminate attack of one functioning class or type upon another, on the
  assumption that the attacked class is entirely to blame for the clash and
  that the attacking class is self-sufficient in the commonweal and can
  dispense with its annoying collaborator. A considerable element of justice
  usually enters into such recriminations. But the Open Conspiracy cannot avail
  itself of these class animosities for its driving force. It can have,
  therefore, no uniform method of approach. For each class it has a conception
  of modification and development, and each class it approaches therefore at a
  distinctive angle. Some classes, no doubt, it would supersede altogether;
  others&mdash;the scientific investigator, for example&mdash;it must regard as
  almost wholly good and seek only to multiply and empower, but it can no more
  adopt the prejudices and extravagances of any particular class as its basis
  than it can adopt the claims of any existing state or empire.</p>

  <p>When it is clearly understood that the binding links of the Open
  Conspiracy we have in mind are certain broad general ideas, and
  that&mdash;except perhaps in the case of scientific workers&mdash;we have no
  current set of attitudes of mind and habits of activity which we can turn
  over directly and unmodified to the service of the conspiracy, we are in a
  position to realize that the movement we contemplate must from the outset be
  diversified in its traditions and elements and various in its methods. It
  must fight upon several fronts and with many sorts of equipment. It will have
  a common spirit, but it is quite conceivable that between many of its
  contributory factors there may be very wide gaps in understanding and
  sympathy. It is no sort of simple organization.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; FORCES AND RESISTANCES IN THE GREAT<br>
  MODERN COMMUNITIES NOW PREVALENT, WHICH ARE<br>
  ANTAGONISTIC TO THE OPEN CONSPIRACY.<br>
  THE WAR WITH TRADITION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">We have now stated broadly but plainly the idea of the world
  commonweal which is the objective of the Open Conspiracy, and we have made a
  preliminary examination of the composition of that movement, showing that it
  must be necessarily not a class development, but a convergence of many
  different sorts of people upon a common idea. Its opening task must be the
  elaboration, exposition, and propaganda of this common idea, a steady
  campaign to revolutionize education and establish a modern ideology in men's
  minds and, arising out of this, the incomparably vaster task of the
  realization of its ideas.</p>

  <p>These are tasks not to be done in vacuo; they have to be done in a dense
  world of crowding, incessant, passionate, unco-ordinated activities, the
  world of market and newspaper, seed-time and harvest, births, deaths, jails,
  hospitals, riots, barracks and army manoeuvres, false prophets and royal
  processions, games and shows, fire, storm, pestilence, earthquake, war. Every
  day and every hour things will be happening to help or thwart, stimulate or
  undermine, obstruct or defeat the creative effort to set up the world
  commonweal.</p>

  <p>Before we go on to discuss the selection and organization of these
  heterogeneous and mainly religious impulses upon which we rest our hopes of a
  greater life for mankind, before we plan how these impulses may be got
  together into a system of co-ordinated activities, it will be well to review
  the main antagonistic forces with which, from its very inception, the Open
  Conspiracy will be&mdash;is now&mdash;in conflict.</p>

  <p>To begin with, we will consider these forces as they present themselves in
  the highly developed Western European States of to-day and in their American
  derivatives, derivatives which, in spite of the fact that in most cases they
  have far outgrown their lands of origin, still owe a large part of their
  social habits and political conceptions to Europe. All these States touch
  upon the Atlantic or its contributory seas; they have all grown to their
  present form since the discovery of America; they have a common tradition
  rooting in the ideas of Christendom and a generic resemblance of method.
  Economically and socially they present what is known in current parlance as
  the Capitalist system, but it will relieve us of a considerable load of
  disputatious matter if we call them here simply the "Atlantic" civilizations
  and communities.</p>

  <p>The consideration of these Atlantic civilizations in relation to the
  coming world civilization will suffice for the present chapter. Afterwards we
  will consider the modification of the forces antagonistic to the Open
  Conspiracy as they display themselves beyond the formal confines of these now
  dominant states in the world's affairs, in the social systems weakened and
  injured by their expansion, and among such less highly organized communities
  as still survive from man's savage and barbaric past.</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy is not necessarily antagonistic to any existing
  government. The Open Conspiracy is a creative, organizing movement and not an
  anarchistic one. It does not want to destroy existing controls and forms of
  human association, but either to supersede or amalgamate them into a common
  world directorate. If constitutions, parliaments, and kings can be dealt with
  as provisional institutions, trustees for the coming of age of the world
  commonweal, and in so far as they are conducted in that spirit, the Open
  Conspiracy makes no attack upon them.</p>

  <p>But most governments will not set about their business as in any way
  provisional they and their supporters insist upon a reverence and obedience
  which repudiate any possibility of supersession. What should be an instrument
  becomes a divinity. In nearly every country of the world there is, in
  deference to the pretended necessities of a possible war, a vast degrading
  and dangerous cultivation of loyalty and mechanical subservience to flags,
  uniforms, presidents, and kings. A president or king who does his appointed
  work well and righteously is entitled to as much subservience as a bricklayer
  who does his work well and righteously and to no more, but instead there is a
  sustained endeavour to give him the privileges of an idol above criticism or
  reproach, and the organized worship of flags has become&mdash;with changed
  conditions of intercourse and warfare&mdash;an entirely evil misdirection of
  the gregarious impulses of our race. Emotion and sentimentality are evoked in
  the cause of disciplines and co-operations that could quite easily be
  sustained and that are better sustained by rational conviction.</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy is necessarily opposed to all such implacable
  loyalties, and still more so to the aggressive assertion and propaganda of
  such loyalties. When these things take the form of suppressing reasonable
  criticism and forbidding even the suggestion of other forms of government,
  they become plainly antagonists to any comprehensive project for human
  welfare. They become manifestly, from the wider point of view, seditious, and
  loyalty to "king and country" passes into plain treason to mankind. Almost
  everywhere, at present, educational institutions organize barriers in the
  path of progress, and there are only the feeblest attempts at any counter
  education that will break up these barriers. There is little or no effort to
  restrain the aggressive nationalist when he waves his flag against the
  welfare of our race, or to protect the children of the world from the
  infection of his enthusiasms. And this last is as true now of the American
  system as it is of any European State.</p>

  <p>In the great mass of the modern community there is little more than a
  favourable acquiescence in patriotic ideas and in the worship of patriotic
  symbols, and that is based largely on such training. These things are not
  necessary things for the generality of to-day. A change of mental direction
  would be possible for the majority of people now without any violent
  disorganization of their intimate lives or any serious social or economic
  readjustments for them. Mental infection in such cases could be countered by
  mental sanitation. A majority of people in Europe, and a still larger
  majority in the United States and the other American Republics, could become
  citizens of the world without any serious hindrance to their present
  occupations, and with an incalculably vast increase of their present
  security.</p>

  <p>But there remains a net of special classes in every community, from kings
  to custom-house officers, far more deeply involved in patriotism because it
  is their trade and their source of honour, and prepared in consequence with
  an instinctive resistance to any reorientation of ideas towards a broader
  outlook. In the case of such people no mental sanitation is possible without
  dangerous and alarming changes in their way of living. For the majority of
  these patriots by metier, the Open Conspiracy unlocks the gates leading from
  a fussy paradise of eminence, respect, and privilege,&mdash;and motions them
  towards an austere wilderness which does not present even the faintest
  promise of a congenial, distinguished life for them. Nearly everything in
  human nature will dispose them to turn away from these gates which open
  towards the world peace, to bang-to and lock them again if they can, and to
  grow thickets as speedily as possible to conceal them and get them forgotten.
  The suggestion of being trustees in a transition will seem to most of such
  people only the camouflage of an ultimate degradation.</p>

  <p>From such classes of patriots by metier, it is manifest that the Open
  Conspiracy can expect only opposition. It may detach individuals from them,
  but only by depriving them of their essential class loyalties and
  characteristics. The class as a class will remain none the less antagonistic.
  About royal courts and presidential residences, in diplomatic, consular,
  military, and naval circles, and wherever people wear titles and uniforms and
  enjoy pride and precedences based on existing political institutions, there
  will be the completest general inability to grasp the need for the Open
  Conspiracy. These people and their womankind, their friends and connections,
  their servants and dependents, are fortified by time-honoured traditions of
  social usage, of sentiment and romantic prestige. They will insist that they
  are reality and Cosmopolis a dream. Only individuals of exceptional
  liveliness, rare intellectual power, and innate moral force can be expected
  to break away from the anti-progressive habits such class conditions impose
  upon them.</p>

  <p>This tangle of traditions and loyalties, of interested trades and
  professions, of privileged classes and official patriots, this complex of
  human beings embodying very easy and natural and time-honoured ideas of
  eternal national separation and unending international and class conflict, is
  the main objective of the Open Conspiracy in its opening phase. This tangle
  must be disentangled as the Open Conspiracy advances, and until it is largely
  disentangled and cleared up that Open Conspiracy cannot become anything very
  much more than a desire and a project.</p>

  <p>This tangle of "necessary patriots," as one may call them, is different in
  its nature, less intricate and extensive proportionally in the United States
  and the States of Latin America, than it is in the old European communities,
  but it is none the less virulent in its action on that account. It is only
  recently that military and naval services have become important factors in
  American social life, and the really vitalizing contact of the interested
  patriot and the State has hitherto centred mainly upon the custom house and
  the concession. Instead of a mellow and romantic loyalty to "king and
  country" the American thinks simply of America and his flag.</p>

  <p>The American exaggeration of patriotism began as a resistance to
  exploitation from overseas. Even when political and fiscal freedom were won,
  there was a long phase of industrial and financial dependence. The American's
  habits of mind, in spite of his recent realization of the enormous power and
  relative prosperity of the United States and of the expanding possibilities
  of their Spanish and Portuguese-speaking neighbours, are still largely self-
  protective against a now imaginary European peril. For the first three
  quarters of the nineteenth century the people of the American continent, and
  particularly the people of the United States, felt the industrial and
  financial ascendancy of Great Britain and had a reasonable fear of European
  attacks upon their continent. A growing tide of immigrants of uncertain
  sympathy threatened their dearest habits. Flag worship was imposed primarily
  as a repudiation of Europe. Europe no longer looms over America with
  overpowering intimations, American industries no longer have any practical
  justification for protection, American finance would be happier without it,
  but the patriotic interests are so established now that they go on and will
  go on. No American statesman who ventures to be cosmopolitan in his utterance
  and outlook is likely to escape altogether from the raucous attentions of the
  patriotic journalist.</p>

  <p>We have said that the complex of classes in any country interested in the
  current method of government is sustained by traditions and impelled by its
  nature and conditions to protect itself against exploratory criticism. It is
  therefore unable to escape from the forms of competitive and militant
  nationalism in which it was evolved. It cannot, without grave danger of
  enfeeblement, change any such innate form. So that while parallel complexes
  of patriotic classes are found in greater or less intricacy grouped about the
  flags and governments of most existing states, these complexes are by their
  nature obliged to remain separate, nationalist, and mutually antagonistic.
  You cannot expect a world union of soldiers or diplomatists. Their existence
  and nature depend upon the idea that national separation is real and
  incurable, and that war, in the long run, is unavoidable. Their conceptions
  of loyalty involve an antagonism to all foreigners, even to foreigners of
  exactly the same types as themselves, and make for a continual campaign of
  annoyances, suspicions, and precautions&mdash;together with a general
  propaganda, affecting all other classes, of the necessity of an international
  antagonism&mdash;that creeps persistently towards war.</p>

  <p>But while the methods of provoking war employed by the patriotic classes
  are traditional, modern science has made a new and enormously more powerful
  thing of warfare and, as the Great War showed, even the most conservative
  generals on both sides are unable to prevent the gigantic interventions of
  the mechanician and the chemist. So that a situation is brought about in
  which the militarist element is unable to fight without the support of the
  modern industrial organization and the acquiescence of the great mass of
  people. We are confronted therefore at the present time with the paradoxical
  situation that a patriotic tradition sustains in power and authority warlike
  classes who are quite incapable of carrying on war. The other classes to
  which they must go for support when the disaster of war is actually achieved
  are classes developed under peace conditions, which not only have no positive
  advantage in war, but must, as a whole, suffer great dislocation, discomfort,
  destruction, and distress from war. It is of primary importance therefore, to
  the formally dominant classes that these new social masses and powers should
  remain under the sway of the old social, sentimental, and romantic
  traditions, and equally important is it to the Open Conspiracy that they
  should be released.</p>

  <p>Here we bring into consideration another great complex of persons,
  interests, traditions&mdash;the world of education, the various religious
  organizations, and, beyond these, the ramifying, indeterminate world of
  newspapers and other periodicals, books, the drama, art, and all the
  instruments of presentation and suggestion that mould opinion and direct
  action. The sum of the operations of this complex will be either to sustain
  or to demolish the old nationalist militant ascendancy. Its easiest immediate
  course is to accept it. Educational organizations on that account are now
  largely a conservative force in the community; they are in most cases
  directly controlled by authority and bound officially as well as practically
  to respect current fears and prejudices. It evokes fewer difficulties for
  them if they limit and mould rather than release the young. The schoolmaster
  tends, therefore, to accept and standardize and stereotype, even in the
  living, progressive fields of science and philosophy. Even there he is a
  brake on the forward movement. It is clear that the Open Conspiracy must
  either continually disturb and revivify him or else frankly antagonize him.
  Universities also struggle between the honourable past on which their
  prestige rests, and the need of adaptation to a world of enquiry, experiment,
  and change. It is an open question whether these particular organizations of
  intellectual prestige are of any real value in the living world. A modern
  world planned de novo would probably produce nothing like a contemporary
  university. Modern research, one may argue, would be stimulated rather than
  injured by complete detachment from the lingering mediaevalism of such
  institutions, their entanglement with adolescent education, and their ancient
  and contagious conceptions of precedence and honour.</p>

  <p>Ordinary religious organizations, again, exist for self-preservation and
  are prone to follow rather than direct the currents of popular thought. They
  are kept alive, indeed, by revivalism and new departures which at the outlet
  they are apt to resist, as the Catholic Church, for instance, resisted the
  Franciscan awakening, but their formal disposition is conservative. They say
  to religious development, thus far and no farther.</p>

  <p>Here, in school, college, and church, are activities of thought and
  instruction which, generally speaking, drag upon the wheels of progress, but
  which need not necessarily do so. A schoolmaster may be original,
  stimulating, and creative, and if he is fortunate and a good fighter he may
  even achieve considerable worldly success; university teachers and
  investigators may strike out upon new lines and yet escape destruction by the
  older dons. Universities compete against other universities at home and
  abroad and cannot altogether yield to the forces of dullness and
  subservience. They must maintain a certain difference from vulgar opinion and
  a certain repute of intellectual virility.</p>

  <p>As we pass from the more organized to the less organized intellectual
  activities, we find conservative influence declining in importance, and a
  freer play for the creative drive. Freshness is a primary condition of
  journalistic, literary, and artistic success, and orthodoxy has nothing new
  to say or do. But the desire for freshness may be satisfied all too readily
  by merely extravagant, superficial, and incoherent inventions.</p>

  <p>The influence of this old traditional nationalist social and political
  hierarchy which blocks the way to the new world is not, however, exerted
  exclusively through its control over schools and universities. Nor is that
  indeed its more powerful activity. Would that it were There is also a direct,
  less defined contact of the old order with the nascent powers, that plays a
  far more effective part in delaying the development of the modern world
  commonweal. Necessarily the old order has determined the established way of
  life, which is, at its best, large, comfortable, amusing, respected. It
  possesses all the entrances and exits and all the controls of the established
  daily round. It is able to exact, and it does exact, almost without design,
  many conformities. There can be no very ample social life, therefore, for
  those who are conspicuously dissentient. Again the old order has a complete
  provision for the growth, welfare, and advancement of its children. It
  controls the founts of honour and self-respect; it provides a mapped-out
  world of behaviour. The new initiatives make their appearance here and there
  in the form of isolated individuals, here an inventor, there a bold organizer
  or a vigorous thinker. Apart from his specific work the innovating type finds
  that he must fall in with established things or his womenfolk will be
  ostracized, and he will be distressed by a sense of isolation even in the
  midst of successful activities. The more intensely he innovates in
  particular, the more likely is he to be too busy to seek out kindred souls
  and organize a new social life in general. The new things and ideas, even
  when they arise abundantly, arise scattered and unorganized, and the old
  order takes them in its net. America for example --both on its Latin and on
  its English-speaking side&mdash;is in many ways a triumph of the old order
  over the new.</p>

  <p>Men like Winwood Reade thought that the New World would be indeed a new
  world. They idealized its apparent emancipations. But as the more successful
  of the toiling farmers and traders of republican America rose one by one to
  affluence, leisure, and freedom, it was far more easy for them to adopt the
  polished and prepared social patterns and usages of Europe than to work out a
  new civilization in accordance with their equalitarian professions. Yet there
  remains a gap in their adapted "Society." Henry James, that acute observer of
  subtle social flavours, has pointed out the peculiar headlessness of social
  life in America because of the absence of court functions to "go on" to and
  justify the assembling and dressing. The social life has imitated the
  preparation for the Court without any political justification. In Europe the
  assimilation of the wealthy European industrialist and financier by the old
  order has been parallel and naturally more logically complete. He really has
  found a court to "go on" to. His social scheme was still undecapitated until
  kingdoms began to change into republics after 1917.</p>

  <p>In this way the complex of classes vitally involved in the old militant
  nationalist order is mightily reinforced by much larger masses of imitative
  and annexed and more or less assimilated rich and active people. The great
  industrialist has married the daughter of the marquis and has a couple of
  sons in the Guards and a daughter who is a princess. The money of the
  American Leeds, fleeing from the social futility of its land of origin,
  helped bolster up a mischievous monarchy in Greece. The functional and
  private lives of the new men are thus at war with one another. The real
  interests of the great industrialist or financier lie in cosmopolitan
  organization and the material development of the world commonweal, but his
  womenfolk pin flags all over him, and his sons are prepared to sacrifice
  themselves and all his business creations for the sake of trite splendours
  and Ruritanian romance.</p>

  <p>But just so far as the great business organizer is capable and creative,
  so far is he likely to realize and resent the price in frustration that the
  old order obliges him to pay for amusement, social interest, and domestic
  peace and comfort. The Open Conspiracy threatens him with no effacement; it
  may even appear with an air of release. If he had women who were interested
  in his business affairs instead of women who had to be amused, and if he
  realized in time the practical, intellectual, and moral kidnap of sons and
  daughters by the old order that goes on, he might pass quite easily from
  acquiescence to antagonism. But in this respect he cannot a single-handed.
  This is a social and not an individual operation. The Open Conspiracy, it is
  clear, must include in its activities a great fight for the souls of
  economically-functional people. It must carve out a Society of its own from
  Society. Only by the creation of a new and better social life can it resist
  the many advantages and attractions of the old.</p>

  <p>This constant gravitation back to traditional uses on the part of what
  might become new social types applies not merely to big people but to such
  small people as are really functional in the modern economic scheme. The have
  no social life adapted to their new economic relationships, and they forced
  back upon the methods of behaviour established for what were roughly their
  analogues in the old order of things. The various sorts of managers and
  foremen in big modern concerns, for example, carry on ways of living they
  have taken ready-made from the stewards, tradesmen, tenantry, and upper
  servants of an aristocratic territorial system. They release themselves and
  are released almost in spite of themselves, slowly, generation by generation,
  from habits of social subservience that are no longer necessary nor
  convenient in the social process, acquire an official pride in themselves and
  take on new conceptions of responsible loyalty to a scheme. And they find
  themselves under suggestions of class aloofness and superiority to the
  general mass of less cardinal workers, that are often unjustifiable under new
  conditions. Machinery and scientific organization have been and still are
  revolutionizing productive activity by the progressive elimination of the
  unskilled worker, the hack, the mere toiler. But the social organization of
  the modern community and the mutual deportment of the associated workers left
  over after this elimination are still haunted by the tradition of the lord,
  the middle-class tenant, and the servile hind. The development of
  self-respect and mutual respect among the mass of modern functional workers
  is clearly an intimate concern of the Open Conspiracy.</p>

  <p>A vast amount of moral force has been wasted in the past hundred years by
  the antagonism of "Labour" to "Capital," as though this were the primary
  issue in human affairs. But this never was the primary issue, and it is
  steadily receding from its former importance. The ancient civilizations did
  actually rest upon a broad basis of slavery and serfdom. Human muscle was a
  main source of energy-ranking with sun, wind, and flood. But invention and
  discovery have so changed the conditions under which power is directed and
  utilized that muscle becomes economically secondary and inessential. We no
  longer want hewers of wood and drawers of water, carriers and pick and spade
  men. We no longer want that breeding swarm of hefty sweaty bodies without
  which the former civilizations could not have endured. We want watchful and
  understanding guardians and drivers of complex delicate machines, which can
  be mishandled and brutalized and spoilt all too easily. The less disposed
  these masters of our machines are to inordinate multiplication, the more room
  and food in the world for their ampler lives. Even to the lowest level of a
  fully-mechanicalized civilization it is required that the human element
  should be select. In the modern world, crowds are a survival, and they will
  presently be an anachronism, and crowd psychology therefore cannot supply the
  basis of a new order. It is just because labour is becoming more intelligent,
  responsible, and individually efficient that it is becoming more audible and
  impatient in social affairs.</p>

  <p>It is just because it is no longer mere gang labour, and is becoming more
  and more intelligent co-operation in detail, that it now resents being
  treated as a serf, housed like a serf, fed like a serf, and herded like a
  serf, and its pride and thoughts and feelings disregarded. Labour is in
  revolt because as a matter of fact it is, in the ancient and exact sense of
  the word, ceasing to be labour at all.</p>

  <p>The more progressive elements of the directive classes recognize this,
  but, as we have shown, there are formidable forces still tending to maintain
  the old social attitudes when arrogance became the ruler and the common man
  accepted his servile status. A continual resistance is offered by large
  sections of the prosperous and advantaged to the larger claims of the
  modernized worker, and in response the rising and differentiating workers
  develop an angry antagonism to these directive classes which allow themselves
  to be controlled by their conservative and reactionary elements. Moreover,
  the increasing relative intelligence of the labour masses, the unprecedented
  imaginative stimulation they experience, the continually more widespread
  realization of the available freedoms and comforts and indulgences that might
  be and are not shared by all in a modern state, develop a recalcitrance where
  once there was little but fatalistic acquiescence. An objection to direction
  and obligation, always mutely present in the toiling multitude since the
  economic life of man began, becomes articulate and active. It is the taste of
  freedom that makes labour desire to be free. This series of frictions is a
  quite inevitable aspect of social reorganization, but it does not constitute
  a primary antagonism in the process.</p>

  <p>The class war was invented by the classes; it is a natural tradition of
  the upper strata of the old order. It was so universally understood that
  there was no need to state it. It is implicit in nearly all the literature of
  the world before the nineteenth century&mdash;except the Bible, the Koran,
  and other sequelae. The "class war" of the Marxist is merely a poor snobbish
  imitation, a tu quoque, a pathetic, stupid, indignant reversal of and retort
  to the old arrogance, a pathetic upward arrogance.</p>

  <p>These conflicts cut across rather than oppose or help the progressive
  development to which the Open Conspiracy devotes itself. Labour, awakened,
  enquiring, and indignant, is not necessarily progressive; if the ordinary
  undistinguished worker is no longer to be driven as a beast of burthen, he
  has --which also goes against the grain&mdash;to be educated to as high a
  level of co-operative efficiency as possible. He has to work better, even if
  he works for much shorter hours and under better conditions, and his work
  must be subordinated work still; he cannot become en masse sole owner and
  master of a scheme of things he did not make and is incapable of directing.
  Yet this is the ambition implicit in an exclusively "Labour" movement. Either
  the Labour revolutionary hopes to cadge the services of exceptional people
  without acknowledgment or return on sentimental grounds, or he really
  believes that anyone is as capable as anyone else&mdash;if not more so. The
  worker at a low level may be flattered by dreams of "class-conscious" mass
  dominion from which all sense of inferiority is banished, but they will
  remain dreams. The deep instinctive jealousy of the commonplace individual
  for outstanding quality and novel initiative may be organized and turned to
  sabotage and destruction, masquerading as and aspiring to be a new social
  order, but that will be a blind alley and not the road of progress. Our hope
  for the human future does not lie in crowd psychology and the
  indiscriminating rule of universal democracy.</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy can have little use for mere resentments as a driving
  force towards its ends; it starts with a proposal not to exalt the labour
  class but to abolish it, its sustaining purpose is to throw drudges out of
  employment and eliminate the inept&mdash;and it is far more likely to incur
  suspicion and distrust in the lower ranks of the developing industrial order
  of to-day than to win support there. There, just as everywhere else in the
  changing social complexes of our time, it can appeal only to the
  exceptionally understanding individual who can without personal humiliation
  consider his present activities and relationships as provisional and who can,
  without taking offence, endure a searching criticising of his present quality
  and mode of living.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; THE RESISTANCES OF THE LESS INDUSTRIALIZED<br>
  PEOPLES TO THE DRIVE OF THE OPEN CONSPIRACY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So far, in our accounting of the powers, institutions,
  dispositions, types, and classes which will be naturally opposed to the Open
  Conspiracy, we have surveyed only such territory in the domain of the future
  world commonweal as is represented by the complex, progressive,
  highly-industrialized communities, based on a preceding landlord-soldier,
  tenant, town-merchant, and tradesman system, of the Atlantic type. These
  communities have developed farthest in the direction of mechanicalization,
  and they are so much more efficient and powerful that they now dominate the
  rest of the world. India, China, Russia, Africa present mélanges of social
  systems, thrown together, outpaced, overstrained, shattered, invaded,
  exploited, and more or less subjugated by the finance, machinery, and
  political aggressions of the Atlantic, Baltic, and Mediterranean
  civilization. In many ways they have an air of assimilating themselves to
  that civilization, evolving modern types and classes, and abandoning much of
  their distinctive traditions. But that they take from the West is mainly the
  new developments, the material achievements, rather than the social and
  political achievements, that, empowered by modern inventions, have won their
  to world predominance. They may imitate European nationalism to a certain
  extent; for them it becomes a convenient form of self-assertion against the
  pressure of a realized practical social and political inferiority; but the
  degree to which they will or can take over the social assumptions and habits
  of the long-established European-American hierarchy is probably very
  restricted. Their nationalism will remain largely indigenous; the social
  traditions in which they will try to make the new material forces subservient
  will be traditions of an Oriental life widely different from the original
  life of Europe. They will have their own resistances to the Open Conspiracy,
  therefore, but they will be different resistances from those we have hitherto
  considered. The automobile and the wireless set, the harvester and steel
  construction building, will come to the jungle rajah and the head hunter, the
  Brahmin and the Indian peasant, with a parallel and yet dissimilar message to
  the one they brought the British landowner or the corn and cattle farmers of
  the Argentine and the Middle West. Also they may be expected to evoke
  dissimilar reactions. To a number of the finer, more energetic minds of these
  overshadow communities which have lagged more or less ill the material
  advances t which this present ascendancy of western Europe and America is
  due, the Open Conspiracy may come with an effect of immense invitation. At one
  step they may go from the sinking vessel of their antiquated order, across
  their present conquerors, into a brotherhood of world rulers They may turn to
  the problem of saving and adapting all that is rich and distinctive of their
  inheritance to the common ends of the race. But to the less vigorous
  intelligences of this outer world, the new project of the Open Conspiracy
  will seem no better than a new form of Western envelopment and they will
  fight a mighty liberation as though it were a further enslavement to the
  European tradition. They will watch the Open Conspiracy for any signs of
  conscious superiority and racial disregard. Necessarily they will recognize
  it as a product of Western mentality and they may well be tempted to regard
  it as an elaboration and organization of current dispositions rather than the
  evolution of a new phase which will make no discrimination at last between
  the effete traditions of either East or West. Their suspicions will be
  sustained and developed by the clumsy and muddle-headed political and
  economic aggressions of the contemporary political and business systems, such
  as they are, of the West, now in progress. Behind that cloud of aggression
  Western thought has necessarily advanced upon them. It could have got to
  their attention in no other way.</p>

  <p>Partly these resistances and criticisms of the decadent communities
  outside the Atlantic capitalist system will be aimed, not at the developing
  methods of the coming world community, but at the European traditions and
  restrictions that have imposed themselves upon these methods, and so far the
  clash of the East and West may be found to subserve the aims of the Open
  Conspiracy. In the conflict of old traditions and in the consequent deadlocks
  lies much hope for the direct acceptance of the groups of ideas centring upon
  the Open Conspiracy One of the most interesting areas of humanity in this
  respect is the great system of communities under the sway or influence of
  Soviet Russia. Russia has never been completely incorporated with the
  European system; she became a just passable imitation of a western European
  monarchy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and talked at last of
  constitutions and parliaments&mdash;but the reality of that vast empire
  remained an Asiatic despotism, and the European mask was altogether smashed
  by the successive revolutions of 1917. The ensuing system is a government
  presiding over an enormous extent of peasants and herdsmen, by a disciplined
  association professing the faith and dogmas of Marx, as interpreted and
  qualified by Lenin and Stalin.</p>

  <p>In many ways this government is a novelty of extraordinary interest. It
  labours against enormous difficulties within itself and without. Flung
  amazingly into a position of tremendous power, its intellectual flexibility
  is greatly restricted by the urgent militant necessity for mental unanimity
  and a consequent repression of criticism. It finds itself separated,
  intellectually and morally, by an enormous gap from the illiterate millions
  over which it rules. More open perhaps to scientific and creative conceptions
  than any other government, and certainly more willing to experiment and
  innovate, its enterprise is starved by the economic depletion of the country
  in the Great War and by the technical and industrial backwardness of the
  population upon which it must draw for its personnel. Moreover, it struggles
  within itself between concepts of a modern scientific social organization and
  a vague anarchistic dream in which the "State" is to disappear, and an
  emancipated proletariat, breeding and expectorating freely, fills the vistas
  of time forevermore. The tradition of long years of hopeless opposition has
  tainted the world policy of the Marxist cult with a mischievous and
  irritating quality that focuses upon it the animosity of every government in
  the dominant Atlantic system. Marxism never had any but the vaguest fancies
  about the relation of one nation to another, and the new Russian government,
  for all its cosmopolitan phrases, is more and more plainly the heir to the
  obsessions of Tsarist Imperialism, using the Communist party, as other
  countries have used Christian missionaries, to maintain a propagandist
  government to forward its schemes. Nevertheless, the Soviet government has
  maintained itself for more than twelve years, and it seems far more likely to
  evolve than to persist. It is quite possible that it will evolve towards the
  conceptions of the Open Conspiracy, and in that case Russia may witness once
  again a conflict between new ideas and Old Believers. So far the Communist
  party in Moscow has maintained a considerable propaganda of ideas in the rest
  of the world and especially across its western frontier. Many of these ideas
  are now trite and stale. The time may be not far distant when the tide of
  propaganda will flow in the reverse direction. It has pleased the vanity of
  the Communist party to imagine itself conducting a propaganda of world
  revolution. Its fate may be to develop upon lines that will make its more
  intelligent elements easily assimilable to the Open Conspiracy for a world
  revolution. The Open Conspiracy as it spreads and grows may find a less
  encumbered field for trying out the economic developments implicit in its
  conceptions in Russia and Siberia than anywhere else in the world.</p>

  <p>However severely the guiding themes and practical methods of the present
  Soviet government in Russia may be criticized, the fact remains that it has
  cleared out of its way many of the main obstructive elements that we find
  still vigorous in the more highly-organized communities in the West. It has
  liberated vast areas from the kindred superstitions of monarchy and the need
  for a private proprietary control of great economic interests. And it has
  presented both China and India with the exciting spectacle of a social and
  political system capable of throwing off many of the most characteristic
  features of triumphant Westernism, and yet holding its own. In the days when
  Japan faced up to modern necessities there were no models for imitation that
  were not communities of the Atlantic type pervaded by the methods of private
  capitalism, and in consequence the Japanese reconstituted their affairs on a
  distinctly European plan, adopting a Parliament and bringing their monarchy,
  social hierarchy, and business and financial methods into a general
  conformity with that model. It is extremely doubtful whether any other
  Asiatic community will now set itself to a parallel imitation, and it will be
  thanks largely to the Russian revolution that this breakaway from
  Europeanization has occurred.</p>

  <p>But it does not follow that such a breakaway will necessarily lead more
  directly to the Open Conspiracy. If we have to face a less highly organized
  system of interests and prejudices in Russia and China, we have to deal with
  a vastly wider ignorance and a vastly more formidable animalism. Russia is a
  land of tens of millions of peasants ruled over by a little band of the
  intelligentsia who can be counted only by tens of thousands. It is only these
  few score thousands who are accessible to ideas of world construction, and
  the only hope of bringing the Russian system into active participation in the
  world conspiracy is through that small minority and through its educational
  repercussion on the myriads below. As we go eastward from European Russia the
  proportion of soundly prepared intelligence to which we can appeal for
  understanding and participation diminishes to an even more dismaying
  fraction. Eliminate that fraction, and one is left face to face with inchoate
  barbarism incapable of social and political organization above the level of
  the war boss and the brigand leader. Russia itself is still by no means
  secure against a degenerative process in that direction, and the hope of
  China struggling out of it without some forcible directive interventions is a
  hope to which constructive liberalism clings with very little assurance.</p>

  <p>We turn back therefore from Russia, China and the communities of Central
  Asia to the Atlantic world. It is in that world alone that sufficient range
  and amplitude of thought and discussion are possible for the adequate
  development of the Open Conspiracy. In these communities it must begin and
  for a long time its main activities will need to be sustained from these
  necessary centres of diffusion. It will develop amidst incessant mental
  Strife, and through that strife it will remain alive. It is no small part of
  the practical weakness of present-day communism that it attempts to centre
  its intellectual life and its directive activities in Moscow and so cuts
  itself off from the free and open discussions of the Western world. Marxism
  lost the world when it went to Moscow and took over the traditions of Tsarism
  as Christianity lost the world when it went to Rome and took over the
  traditions of Caesar. Entrenched in Moscow from searching criticism, the
  Marxist ideology may become more and more dogmatic and unprogressive,
  repeating its sacred credo and issuing its disregarded orders to the
  proletariat of the world, and so stay ineffectively crystallized until the
  rising tide of the Open Conspiracy submerges, dissolves it afresh, and
  incorporates whatever it finds assimilable.</p>

  <p>India, like Japan, is cut off from the main body of Asiatic affairs. But
  while Japan has become a formally Westernized nationality in the comity of
  such nations, India remains a world in itself. In that one peninsula nearly
  every type of community is to be found, from the tribe of jungle savages,
  through a great diversity of barbaric and mediaeval principalities, to the
  child and women&mdash;sweating factories and the vigorous modern
  commercialism of Bombay. Over it all the British imperialism prevails, a
  constraining and restraining influence, keeping the peace, checking
  epidemics, increasing the food supply by irrigation and the like, and making
  little or no effort to evoke responses to modern ideas. Britain in India is
  no propagandist of modern ferments: all those are left the other side of
  Suez. In India the Briton is a ruler as firm and self-assured and uncreative
  as the Roman. The old religious and social traditions, the complex customs,
  castes, tabus, and exclusions of a strangely-mixed but unamalgamated
  community, though a little discredited by this foreign predominance, still
  hold men's minds. They have been, so to speak, pickled in the preservative of
  the British raj.</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy has to invade the Indian complex in conflict with the
  prejudices of both ruler and governed. It has to hope for individual breaches
  in the dull Romanism of the administration: here a genuine educationist, here
  a creative civil servant, here an official touched by the distant stir of the
  living homeland; and it has to try to bring these types into a co-operative
  relationship with a fine native scholar here or an active-minded prince or
  landowner or industrialist there. As the old methods of passenger transport
  are superseded by flying, it will be more and more difficult to keep the stir
  of the living homeland out of either the consciousness of the official
  hierarchy or the knowledge of the recalcitrant "native."</p>

  <p>Very similar to Indian conditions is the state of affairs in the foreign
  possessions of France, the same administrative obstacles to the Open
  Conspiracy above, and below the same resentful subordination, cut off from
  the mental invigoration of responsibility. Within these areas of restraint,
  India and its lesser, simpler parallels in North Africa, Syria and the Far
  East, there goes on a rapid increase of low-grade population, undersized
  physically and mentally, and retarding the mechanical development of
  civilization by its standing offer of cheap labour to the unscrupulous
  entrepreneur, and possible feeble insurrectionary material to the
  unscrupulous political adventurer. It is impossible to estimate how slowly or
  how rapidly the knowledge and ideas that have checked the rate of increase of
  all the Atlantic populations may be diffused through these less alert
  communities.</p>

  <p>We must complete our survey of the resistances against which the Open
  Conspiracy has to work by a few words about the Negro world and the regions
  of forest and jungle in which barbaric and even savage human life still
  escapes the infection of civilization. It seems inevitable that the
  development of modern means of communication and the conquest of tropical
  diseases should end in giving access everywhere to modern administration and
  to economic methods, and everywhere the incorporation of the former
  wilderness in the modern economic process means the destruction of the
  material basis, the free hunting, the free access to the soil, of such
  barbaric and savage communities as still precariously survive. The dusky
  peoples, who were formerly the lords of these still imperfectly assimilate
  areas, are becoming exploited workers, slaves, serfs, hut-tax payers,
  labourers to a caste of white immigrants. The spirit of the plantation broods
  over all these lands. The Negro in America differs only from his subjugated
  brother in South Africa or Kenya Colony in the fact that he also, like his
  white master, is an immigrant. The situation in Africa and America adjusts
  itself therefore towards parallel conditions, the chief variation being in
  the relative proportions of the two races and the details of the methods by
  which black labour is made to serve white ends.</p>

  <p>In these black and white communities which are establishing themselves in
  all those parts of the earth where once the black was native, or in which a
  sub-tropical climate is favourable to his existence at a low level of social
  development, there is&mdash;and there is bound to be for many years to
  come&mdash;much racial tension. The steady advance of birth-control may
  mitigate the biological factors of this tension later on, and a general
  amelioration of manners and conduct may efface that disposition to persecute
  dissimilar types, which man shares with many other gregarious animals. But
  meanwhile this tension increases and a vast multitude of lives is strained to
  tragic issues.</p>

  <p>To exaggerate the dangers and evils of miscegenation is a weakness of our
  time. Man interbreeds with all his varieties and yet deludes himself that
  there are races of outstanding purity, the "Nordic," the "Semitic," and so
  forth. These are phantoms of the imagination. The reality is more intricate,
  less dramatic, and grips less easily upon the mind; the phantoms grip only
  too well and incite to terrible suppressions. Changes in the number of
  half-breeds and in the proportion of white and coloured are changes of a
  temporary nature that may become controllable and rectifiable in a few
  generations. But until this level of civilization is reached, until the
  colour of a man's skin or the kinks in a woman's hair cease to have the value
  of shibboleths that involve educational, professional, and social extinction
  or survival, a black and white community is bound to be continually
  preoccupied by a standing feud too intimate and persuasive to permit of any
  long views of the world's destiny.</p>

  <p>We come to the conclusion therefore that it is from the more vigorous,
  varied, and less severely obsessed centres of the Atlantic civilizations in
  the temperate zone, with their abundant facilities for publication and
  discussion, their traditions of mental liberty and their immense variety of
  interacting free types, that the main beginnings of the Open Conspiracy must
  develop. For the rest of the world, its propaganda, finding but poor
  nourishment in the local conditions, may retain a missionary quality for many
  years.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; RESISTANCES AND ANTAGONISTIC FORCES<br>
  IN OUR CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS SELVES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WE have dealt in the preceding two chapters with great
  classes and assemblages of human beings as, in the mass, likely to be more or
  less antagonistic to the Open Conspiracy, and it has been difficult in those
  chapters to avoid the implication that "we," some sort of circle round the
  writer, were aloof from these obstructive and hostile multitudes, and
  ourselves entirely identified with the Open Conspiracy. But neither are these
  multitudes so definitely against, nor those who are with us so entirely for,
  the Open Conspiracy to establish a world community as the writer, in his
  desire for clearness and contrast and with an all too human disposition
  perhaps towards plain ego-centred combative issues, has been led to
  represent. There is no "we," and there can be no "we," in possession of the
  Open Conspiracy.</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy is in partial possession of us, and we attempt to
  serve it. But the Open Conspiracy is a natural and necessary development of
  contemporary thought arising here, there, and everywhere. There are doubts
  and sympathies that weigh on the side of the Open Conspiracy in nearly
  everyone, and not one of us but retains many impulses, habits, and ideas in
  conflict with our general devotion, checking and limiting our service.</p>

  <p>Let us therefore in this chapter cease to discuss classes and types and
  consider general mental tendencies and reactions which move through all
  humanity.</p>

  <p>In our opening chapters we pointed out that religion is not universally
  distributed throughout human society. And of no one does it seem to have
  complete possession. It seizes upon some of us and exalts us for one hour now
  and then, for a day now and then; it may leave its afterglow upon our conduct
  for some time; it may establish restraints and habitual dispositions;
  sometimes it dominates us with but brief intermissions through long spells,
  and then we can be saints and martyrs. In all our religious phases there
  appears a desire to hold the phase, to subdue the rest of our life to the
  standards and exigencies of that phase. Our quickened intelligence sets
  itself to a general analysis of our conduct and to the problem of
  establishing controls over our unilluminated intervals.</p>

  <p>And when the religious elements in the mind set themselves to such self-
  analysis, and attempt to order and unify the whole being upon this basis of
  the service and advancement of the race, they discover first a great series
  of indifferent moods, wherein the resistance to thought and word for the Open
  Conspiracy is merely passive and in the nature of inertia. There is a whole
  class of states of mind which may be brought together under the head of
  "everydayism." The dinner bell and the playing fields, the cinema and the
  newspaper, the week-end visit and the factory siren, a host of such expectant
  things calls to a vast majority of people in our modern world to stop
  thinking and get busy with the interest in hand, and so on to the next,
  without a thought for the general frame and drama in which these momentary
  and personal incidents are set. We are driven along these marked and
  established routes and turned this way or that by the accidents of
  upbringing, of rivalries and loves, of chance encounters and vivid
  experiences, and it is rarely for many of us, and never for some, that the
  phases of broad reflection and self-questioning arise. For many people the
  religious life now, as in the past, has been a quite desperate effort to
  withdraw sufficient attention and energy from the flood of events to get some
  sort of grasp, and keep whatever grip is won, upon the relations of the self
  to the whole. Far more recoil in terror from such a possibility and would
  struggle strenuously against solitude in the desert, solitude under the
  stars, solitude in a silent room or indeed any occasion for comprehensive
  thought.</p>

  <p>But the instinct and purpose of the religious type is to keep hold upon
  the comprehensive drama, and at the heart of all the great religions of the
  world we find a parallel disposition to escape in some manner from the
  aimless drive and compulsion of accident and everyday. Escape is attempted
  either by withdrawal from the presence of crowding circumstance into a
  mystical contemplation and austere retirement, or&mdash;what is more
  difficult and desperate and reasonable&mdash;by imposing the mighty standards
  of enduring issues upon the whole mass of transitory problems which
  constitute the actual business of life. We have already noted how the modern
  mind turns from retreat as a recognizable method of religion, and faces
  squarely up to the second alternative. The tumult of life has to be met and
  conquered. Aim must prevail over the aimless. Remaining in normal life we
  must yet keep our wills and thoughts aloof from normal life and fixed upon
  creative processes. However busied we may be, however challenged, we must yet
  save something of our best mental activity for self-examination and keep
  ourselves alert against the endless treacheries within that would trip us
  back into everydayism and disconnected responses to the stimuli of life.</p>

  <p>Religions in the past, though they have been apt to give a preference to
  the renunciation of things mundane, have sought by a considerable variety of
  expedients to preserve the faith of those whom chance or duty still kept in
  normal contact with the world. It would provide material for an interesting
  study to enquire how its organizations to do this have worked in the past and
  how far they may be imitated and paralleled in the progressive life of the
  future. All the wide-reaching religions which came into existence in the five
  centuries before and the five centuries after Christ have made great use of
  periodic meetings for mutual reassurance, of sacred books, creeds,
  fundamental heart-searchings, of confession, prayer, sacraments, seasons of
  withdrawal, meditation, fasting, and prayer. Do these methods mark a phase in
  the world's development, or are they still to be considered available?</p>

  <p>This points to a very difficult tangle of psychological problems. The
  writer in his earlier draft of this book wrote that the modern religious
  individual leads, spiritually speaking, a life of extreme wasteful and
  dangerous isolation. He still feels that is true, but he realizes that the
  invention of corrective devices is not within his range. He cannot picture a
  secular Mass nor congregations singing hymns about the Open Conspiracy.
  Perhaps the modern soul in trouble will resort to the psychoanalysts instead
  of the confessional; in which case we need to pray for better
  psychoanalysts.</p>

  <p>Can the modern mind work in societies? May the daily paper be slowly
  usurping the functions of morning prayer, a daily mental reminder of large
  things, with more vividness and, at present, lower standards? One of the most
  distressful facts of the spread of education in the nineteenth century was
  the unscrupulous exploitation of the new reading public by a group of
  trash-dealers who grew rich and mighty in the process. Is the popular
  publisher and newspaper proprietor always to remain a trash-dealer? Or are we
  to see, in the future, publications taking at times some or all of the
  influence of revivalist movements, and particular newspapers rising to the
  task of sustaining a common faith in a gathering section of the public?</p>

  <p>The modern temple in which we shall go to meditate may be a museum; the
  modern religious house and its religious life may be a research organization.
  The Open Conspirator must see to it that the museums show their meaning
  plain. There may be not only literature presently, but even plays, shows, and
  music, to subserve new ideas instead of trading upon tradition.</p>

  <p>It is plain that to read and be moved by great ideas and to form good
  resolutions with no subsequent reminders and moral stocktaking is no enough
  to keep people in the way of the Open Conspiracy. The relapse to everydayism
  is too easy. The contemporary Open Conspirator may forget, and he has nothing
  to remind him; he may relapse, and he w hear no reproach to warn him of his
  relapse. Nowhere has he recorded vow. "Everyday" has endless ways of
  justifying the return of the believer to sceptical casualness. It is easy to
  persuade oneself that one is taking life or oneself "too seriously." The mind
  is very self-protective; has a disposition to abandon too great or too
  far-reaching an effort and return to things indisputably within its scope. We
  have an instinctive preference for thinking things are "all right"; we
  economize anxiety; defend the delusions that we can work with, even though we
  half realize they are no more that' delusions. We resent the warning voice,
  the critical question that robs our activities of assurance. Our everyday
  moods not only the antagonists of our religious moods, but they resent all
  outward appeals to our religious moods, and they welcome every help against
  religious appeals. We pass very readily from the merely defensive to the
  defensive aggressive, and from refusing to hear the word that might stir our
  consciences to a vigorous effort to suppress its utterance.</p>

  <p>Churches, religious organizations, try to keep the revivifying phase and
  usage where it may strike upon the waning or slumbering faith of the convert,
  but modern religion as yet has no such organized rebinders. {sic-RW} They
  cannot be improvised. Crude attempts to supply the needed corrective of
  conduct may do less good than harm. Each one of us for himself must do what
  he can to keep his high resolve in mind and protect himself from the snare of
  his own moods of fatigue or inadvertency.</p>

  <p>But these passive and active defences of current things which operate in
  and through ourselves, and find such ready sympathy and assistance in the
  world about us, these massive resistance systems, are only the beginning of
  our tale of the forces antagonistic to the Open Conspiracy that lurk in our
  complexities.</p>

  <p>Men are creatures with other faults quite beyond and outside our common
  disposition to be stupid, indolent, habitual, and defensive. Not only have we
  active creative impulses, but also acutely destructive ones. Man is a jealous
  animal. In youth and adolescence egotism is extravagant. It is natural for it
  to be extravagant, then, and there is no help for it. A great number of us at
  that stage would rather not see a beautiful or wonderful thing come into
  existence then have it come into existence disregarding us. Something of that
  jealous malice, that self-assertive ruthlessness, remains in all of us
  throughout life. At his worst man can be an exceedingly combative, malignant,
  mischievous and cruel animal. None of us are altogether above the possibility
  of such phases. When we consider the oppositions to the Open Conspiracy that
  operate in the normal personality, we appreciate the soundness of the
  catechism which instructs us to renounce not only the trivial world and the
  heavy flesh, but the active and militant devil.</p>

  <p>To make is a long and wearisome business, with many arrests and
  disappointments, but to break gives an instant thrill. We all know something
  of the delight of the Bang. It is well for the Open Conspirator to ask
  himself at times how far he is in love with the dream of a world in order,
  and how far he is driven by hatred of institutions that bore or humiliate
  him. He may be no more than a revengeful incendiary in the mask of a
  constructive worker. How safe is he, then, from the reaction to some fresh
  humiliation? The Open Conspiracy which is now his refuge and vindication may
  presently fail to give him the compensation he has sought, may offer him no
  better than a minor röle, may display Irritating and incomprehensible
  preferences. And for a great number of things in overt antagonism to the
  great aim of the Open Conspiracy, he will still find within himself not
  simply acquiescence but sympathy and a genuine if inconsistent admiration.
  There they are, waiting for his phase of disappointment. Back he may go to
  the old loves with a new animus against the greater scheme. He may be glad to
  be quit of prigs and humbugs, and back among the good fellowship of nothing
  in particular.</p>

  <p>Man has pranced a soldier in reality and fancy for so many generations
  that few of us can altogether release our imaginations from the brilliant
  pretensions of flags, empire, patriotism, and aggression. Business men,
  especially in America, seem to feel a sort of glory in calling even the
  underselling and overadvertising of rival enterprises "fighting." Pill
  vendors and public departments can have their "wars," their heroisms, their
  desperate mischiefs, and so get that Napoleonic feeling. The world and our
  reveries are full of the sentimentalities, the false glories and loyalties of
  the old combative traditions, trailing after them, as they do, so much worth
  and virtue in a dulled and stupefied condition. It is difficult to resist the
  fine gravity, the high self-respect, the examples of honour and good style in
  small things, that the military and naval services can present to us, for all
  that they are now no more than noxious parasites upon the nascent world
  commonweal. In France not a word may be said against the army; in England,
  against the navy. There will be many Open Conspirators at first who will
  scarcely dare to say that word even to themselves.</p>

  <p>But all these obsolete values and attitudes with which our minds are
  cumbered must be cleared out if the new faith is to have free play. We have
  to clear them out not only from our own minds but from the minds of others
  who are to become our associates. The finer and more picturesque these
  obsolescent loyalties, obsolescent standards of honour, obsolescent religious
  associations, may seem to us, the more thoroughly must we seek to release our
  minds and the minds of those about us from them and cut off all thought of a
  return.</p>

  <p>We cannot compromise with these vestiges of the ancient order and be
  faithful servants of the new. Whatever we retain of them will come back to
  life and grow again. It is no good to operate for cancer unless the whole
  growth is removed. Leave a crown about and presently you will find it being
  worn by someone resolved to be a king. Keep the name and image of a god
  without a distinct museum label and sooner or later you will discover a
  worshipper on his knees to it and be lucky not to find a human sacrifice upon
  the altar. Wave a flag and it will wrap about you. Of yourself even more than
  of the community is this true; these can be no half measures. You have not
  yet completed your escape to the Open Conspiracy from the cities of the plain
  while it is still possible for you to take a single backward glance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; THE OPEN CONSPIRACY BEGINS AS A<br>
  MOVEMENT OF DISCUSSION, EXPLANATION, AND PROPAGANDA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A NEW and happier world, a world community, is awakening,
  within the body of the old order, to the possibility of its emergence. Our
  phrase, "the Open Conspiracy" is merely a name for that awakening. To begin
  with, the Open Conspiracy is necessarily a group of ideas.</p>

  <p>It is a system of modern ideas which has been growing together in the last
  quarter of the century, and particularly since the war. It is the reaction of
  a rapidly progressing biological conception of life and of enlarged
  historical realizations upon the needs and urgencies of the times. In this
  book we are attempting to define this system and to give it this provisional
  name. Essentially at first it is a dissemination of this new ideology that
  must occur. The statement must be tried over and spread before a widening
  circle of people.</p>

  <p>Since the idea of the Open Conspiracy rests upon and arises out of a
  synthesis of historical, biological, and sociological realizations, we may
  look for these realizations already in the case of people with sound
  knowledge in these fields; such people will be prepared for acquiescence
  without any explanatory work; there is nothing to set out to them beyond the
  suggestion that it is time they became actively conscious of where they
  stand. They constitute already the Open Conspiracy in an unorganized
  solution, and they will not so much adhere as admit to themselves and others
  their state of mind. They will say, "We knew all that." Directly we pass
  beyond that comparatively restricted world, however, we find that we have to
  deal with partial knowledge, with distorted views, or with blank ignorance,
  and that a revision and extension of historical and biological ideas and a
  Considerable elucidation of economic misconceptions have to be undertaken.
  Such people have to be brought up to date with their information.</p>

  <p>I have told already how I have schemed out a group of writings to embody
  the necessary ideas of the new time in a form adapted to the current reading
  public; I have made a sort of provisional "Bible," so to speak, for some
  factors at least in the Open Conspiracy. It is an early sketch. As the
  current reading public changes, all this work will become obsolescent so far
  as its present form and method go. But not so far as its substantial method
  goes. That I believe will remain.</p>

  <p>Ultimately this developing mass of biological, historical, and economic
  information and suggestion must be incorporated in general education if the
  Open Conspiracy is to come to its own. At present this propaganda has to go
  on among adolescents and adults because of the backwardness and political
  conservatism of existing educational organizations. Most real modern
  education now is done in spite of the schools and to correct the
  misconceptions established by the schools. But what will begin as adult
  propaganda must pass into a kultur-kampf to win our educational machinery
  from reaction and the conservation of outworn ideas and attitudes to the
  cause of world reconstruction. The Open Conspiracy itself can never be
  imprisoned and fixed in the form of an organization, but everywhere Open
  Conspirators should be organizing themselves for educational reform.</p>

  <p>And also within the influence of this comprehensive project there will be
  all sorts of groupings for study and progressive activity. One can presuppose
  the formation of groups of friends, of family groups, of students and
  employees or other sorts of people, meeting and conversing frequently in the
  course of their normal occupations, who will exchange views and find
  themselves in agreement upon this idea of a constructive change of the world
  as the guiding form of human activities.</p>

  <p>Fundamentally important issues upon which unanimity must be achieved from
  the outset are:</p>

  <p>Firstly, the entirely provisional nature of all existing governments, and
  the entirely provisional nature, therefore, of all loyalties associated
  therewith;</p>

  <p>Secondly, the supreme importance of population control in human biology
  and the possibility it affords us of a release from the pressure of the
  struggle for existence on ourselves; and</p>

  <p>Thirdly, the urgent necessity of protective resistance against the present
  traditional drift towards war.</p>

  <p>People who do not grasp the vital significance of these test issues do not
  really begin to understand the Open Conspiracy. Groups coming into agreement
  upon these matters, and upon their general interpretation of history, will be
  in a position to seek adherents, enlarge themselves, and attempt to establish
  communication and co-operation with kindred groups for common ends. They can
  take up a variety of activities to develop a sense and habit of combined
  action and feel their way to greater enterprises.</p>

  <p>We have seen already that the Open Conspiracy must be heterogeneous in
  origin. Its initial groupings and associations will be of no uniform pattern.
  They will be of a very different size, average age, social experience, and
  influence. Their particular activities will be determined by the things.
  Their diverse qualities and influences will express themselves by diverse
  attempts at organization, each effective in its own sphere. A group or
  movement of students may find itself capable of little more than
  self-education and personal propaganda; a handful of middle-class people in
  small town may find its small resources fully engaged at first in such things
  as, for example, seeing that desirable literature is available for sale or in
  local public library, protecting books and news vendors from suppression, or
  influencing local teachers. Most parents of school children can press for the
  teaching of universal history and sound biology and protest against the
  inculcation of aggressive patriotism. There is much scope for the single
  individual in this direction. On the other hand, a group of ampler experience
  and resources may undertake the printing, publication, and distribution of
  literature, and exercise considerable influence upon public opinion in
  turning education in the right direction. The League of Nations movement, the
  Birth Control movement, and most radical and socialist societies, are fields
  into which Open Conspirators may go to find adherents more than half prepared
  for their wider outlook. The Open Conspiracy is a fuller and ampler movement
  into which these incomplete activities must necessarily merge as its idea
  takes possession of men's imaginations.</p>

  <p>From the outset, the Open Conspiracy will set its face against militarism.
  There is a plain present need for the organization now, before war comes
  again, of an open and explicit refusal to serve in any war&mdash;or at most
  to serve in war, directly or indirectly, only after the issue has been fully
  and fairly submitted to arbitration. The time for a conscientious objection
  to war service is manifestly before and not after the onset of war. People
  who have by their silence acquiesced in a belligerent foreign policy right up
  to the onset of war, have little to complain of if they are then compelled to
  serve. And a refusal to participate with one's country in warfare is a
  preposterously incomplete gesture unless it is rounded off by the deliberate
  advocacy of a world pax, a world economic control, and a restrained
  population, such as the idea of the Open Conspiracy embodies.</p>

  <p>The putting upon record of its members' reservation of themselves from any
  or all of the military obligations that may be thrust upon the country by
  military and diplomatic effort, might very conceivably be the first
  considerable overt act of many Open Conspiracy groups. It would supply the
  practical incentive to bring many of them together in the first place. It
  would necessitate the creation of regional or national ad hoc committees for
  the establishment of a collective legal and political defensive for this
  dissent from current militant nationalism. It would bring the Open Conspiracy
  very early out of the province of discussion into the field of practical
  conflict. It would from the outset invest it with a very necessary quality of
  present applicability.</p>

  <p>The anticipatory repudiation of military service, so far as this last may
  be imposed by existing governments in their factitious international
  rivalries, need not necessarily involve a denial of the need of military
  action on behalf of the world commonweal for the suppression of nationalist
  brigandage, nor need it prevent the military training of Open Conspirators.
  It is simply the practical form of assertion that the normal militant
  diplomacy and warfare of the present time are offences against civilization,
  processes in the nature of brigandage, sedition, and civil war, and that
  serious men cannot be expected to play anything but a röle of disapproval,
  non-participation, or active prevention towards them. Our loyalty to our
  current government, we would intimate, is subject to its sane and adult
  behaviour.</p>

  <p>These educational and propagandist groups drawing together into an
  organized resistance to militarism and to the excessive control of
  individuals by the makeshift governments of to-day, constitute at most only
  the earliest and more elementary grade of the Open Conspiracy, and we will
  presently go on to consider the more specialized and constructive forms its
  effort must evoke. Before doing so, however, we may say a little more about
  the structure and method of these possible initiatory groupings.</p>

  <p>Since they are bound to be different and miscellaneous in form, size,
  quality, and ability, any early attempts to organize them into common general
  action or even into regular common gatherings are to be deprecated. There
  should be many types of groups. Collective action had better for a time -
  perhaps for a long time&mdash;be undertaken not through the merging of groups
  but through the formation of ad hoc associations for definitely specialized
  ends, all making for the new world civilization. Open Conspirators will come
  into these associations to make a contribution very much as people come into
  limited liability companies, that is to say with a subscription and not with
  their whole capital. A comprehensive organization attempting from the first
  to cover all activities would necessarily rest upon and promote one prevalent
  pattern of activity and hamper or estrange the more original and interesting
  forms. It would develop a premature orthodoxy, it would cease almost at once
  to be creative, and it would begin to form a crust of tradition. It would
  become anchylosed. With the dreadful examples of Christianity and Communism
  before us, we must insist that the idea of the Open Conspiracy ever becoming
  a single organization must be dismissed from the mind. It is a movement, yes,
  a system of purposes, but its end is a free and living, if unified,
  world.</p>

  <p>At the utmost seven broad principles may be stated as defining the Open
  Conspiracy and holding it together. And it is possible even of these, one,
  the seventh, may be, if not too restrictive, at least unnecessary. To the
  writer it seems unavoidable because it is so intimately associated with that
  continual dying out of tradition upon which our hopes for an unencumbered and
  expanding human future rest.</p>

  <p>(1) The complete assertion, practical as well as theoretical, of the
  provisional nature of existing governments and of our acquiescence in
  them;</p>

  <p>(2) The resolve to minimize by all available means the conflicts of these

     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; EARLY CONSTRUCTIVE WORK OF THE OPEN
     CONSPIRACY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN such terms we may sketch the practicable and possible
  opening phase of the Open Conspiracy.</p>

  <p>We do not present it as a movement initiated by any individual or
  radiating from any particular centre. In this book we are not starting
  something; we are describing and participating in something which has
  started. It arises naturally and necessarily from the present increase of
  knowledge and the broadening outlook of many minds throughout the world, and
  gradually it becomes conscious of itself. It is reasonable therefore to
  anticipate its appearance all over the world in sporadic mutually independent
  groupings and movements, and to recognize not only that they will be
  extremely various, but that many of them will trail with them racial and
  regional habits and characteristics which will only be shaken off as its
  cosmopolitan character becomes imperatively evident.</p>

  <p>The passage from the partial anticipations of the Open Conspiracy that
  already abound everywhere to its complete and completely self-conscious
  statement may be made by almost imperceptible degrees. To-day it may seem no
  more than a visionary idea; to-morrow it may be realized as a world-wide
  force of opinion and will. People will pass with no great inconsistency from
  saying that the Open Conspiracy is impossible to saying that it has always
  been plain and clear to them, that to this fashion they have shaped their
  lives as long as they can remember.</p>

  <p>In its opening phase, in the day of small things, quite minor accidents
  may help or delay the clear definition and popularization of its main ideas.
  The changing pattern of public events may disperse or concentrate attention
  upon it, or it may win the early adherence of men of exceptional resources,
  energy, or ability. It is impossible to foretell the speed of its advance.
  Its development may be slower or faster, direct or devious, but the logic of
  accumulating realizations thrusts it forward, will persist in thrusting it
  on, and sooner or later it will be discovered, conscious and potent, the
  working religion of most sane and energetic people.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile our supreme virtues must be faith and persistence.</p>

  <p>So far we have considered only two of the main activities of the Open
  Conspiracy, the one being its propaganda of confidence in the possible world
  commonweal, and the other its immediate practical attempt to systematize
  resistance to militant and competitive imperialism and nationalism. But such
  things are merely its groundwork undertakings; they do no more than clear the
  site and make the atmosphere possible for its organized constructive
  efforts.</p>

  <p>Directly we turn to that, we turn to questions of special knowledge,
  special effort, and special organization.</p>

  <p>Let us consider first the general advancement of science, the protection
  and support of scientific research, and the diffusion of scientific
  knowledge. These things fall within the normal scheme of duty for the members
  of the Open Conspiracy. The world of science and experiment is the region of
  origin of nearly all the great initiatives that characterize our times; the
  Open Conspiracy owes its inspiration, its existence, its form and direction
  entirely to the changes of condition these initiatives have brought about,
  and yet a large number of scientific workers live outside the sphere of
  sympathy in which we may expect the Open Conspiracy to materialize, and
  collectively their political and social influence upon the community is
  extraordinarily small. Having regard to the immensity of its contributions
  and the incalculable value of its promise to the modern community,
  science&mdash;research, that is, and the diffusion of scientific
  knowledge&mdash;is extraordinarily neglected, starved, and threatened by
  hostile interference. This is largely because scientific work has no strong
  unifying organization and cannot in itself develop such an organization.</p>

  <p>Science is a hard mistress, and the first condition of successful
  scientific work is that the scientific man should stick to his research. The
  world of science is therefore in itself, at its core, a miscellany of
  specialists, often very ungracious specialists, and, rather than offer him
  help and co-operation, it calls for understanding, tolerance, and service
  from the man of general intelligence and wider purpose. The company of
  scientific men is less like a host of guiding angels than like a swarm of
  marvellous bees --endowed with stings&mdash;which must be hived and cherished
  and multiplied by the Open Conspiracy.</p>

  <p>But so soon as we have the Open Conspiracy at work, putting its plainly
  and offering its developing ideas and activities to those most preciously
  preoccupied men, then reasonably, when it involves no special trouble for
  them, when it is the line of least resistance for them, they may be expected
  to fall in with its convenient and helpful aims and find in it what they have
  hitherto lacked, a common system of political and social concepts to hold
  them together.</p>

  <p>When that stage is reached, we shall be saved such spectacles of
  intellectual prostitution as the last Great War offered, when men of science
  were herded blinking from their laboratories to curse one another upon
  nationalist lines, and when after the war stupid and wicked barriers were set
  up to the free communication of knowledge by the exclusion of scientific men
  of this or that nationality from international scientific gatherings. The
  Open Conspiracy must help the man of science to realize, what at present he
  fails most astonishingly to realize, that he belongs to a greater comity than
  any king or president represents to-day, and so prepare him for better
  behaviour in the next season of trial.</p>

  <p>The formation of groups in, and not only in, but about and in relation to,
  the scientific world, which will add to those first main activities of the
  Open Conspiracy, propaganda and pacificism, a special attention to the needs
  of scientific work, may be enlarged upon with advantage here, because it will
  illustrate quite typically the idea of a special work carried on in relation
  to a general activity, which is the subject of this section.</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy extends its invitation to all sorts and conditions of
  men, but the service of scientific progress is for those only who are
  specially equipped or who are sufficiently interested to equip themselves.
  For scientific work there is first of all a great need of endowment and the
  setting up of laboratories, observatories, experimental stations, and the
  like, in all parts of the world. Numbers of men and women capable of
  scientific work never achieve it for want of the stimulus of opportunity
  afforded by endowment. Few contrive to create their own opportunities. The
  essential man of science is very rarely an able collector or administrator of
  money, and anyhow, the detailed work of organization is a grave call upon his
  special mental energy. But many men capable of a broad and intelligent
  appreciation of scientific work, but not capable of the peculiar intensities
  of research, have the gift of extracting money from private and public
  sources, and it is for them to use that gift modestly and generously in
  providing the framework for those more especially endowed.</p>

  <p>And there is already a steadily increasing need for the proper storage and
  indexing of scientific results, and every fresh worker enhances it. Quite a
  considerable amount of scientific work goes fruitless or is needlessly
  repeated because of the growing volume of publication, and men make
  discoveries in the field of reality only to lose them again in the lumber
  room of record. Here is a second line of activity to which the Open
  Conspirator with a scientific bias may direct his attention.</p>

  <p>A third line is the liaison work between the man of science and the common
  intelligent man; the promotion of publications which will either state the
  substance, implications and consequences of new work in the vulgar tongue,
  or, if that is impossible, train the general run of people to the new idioms
  and technicalities which need to be incorporated with the vulgar tongue if it
  is still to serve its ends as a means of intellectual intercourse.</p>

  <p>Through special ad hoc organizations, societies for the promotion of
  Research, for Research Defence, for World Indexing, for the translation of
  Scientific Papers, for the Diffusion of New Knowledge, the surplus energies
  of a great number of Open Conspirators can be directed to entirely creative
  ends and a new world system of scientific work built up, within which such
  dear old institutions as the Royal Society of London, the various European
  Academies of Science and the like, now overgrown and inadequate, can maintain
  their venerable pride in themselves, their mellowing prestige, and their
  distinguished exclusiveness, without their present privilege of inflicting
  cramping slights and restrictions upon the more abundant scientific
  activities of to-day.</p>

  <p>So in relation to science&mdash;and here the word is being used in its
  narrower accepted meaning for what is often spoken of as pure science, the
  search for physical and biological realities, uncomplicated by moral, social,
  and "practical" considerations&mdash;we evoke a conception of the Open
  Conspiracy as producing groups of socially associated individuals, who engage
  primarily in the general basic activities of the Conspiracy and adhere to and
  promote the seven broad principles summarized at the end of Chapter Fourteen,
  but who work also with the larger part of their energies, through
  international and cosmopolitan societies and in a multitude of special ways,
  for the establishment of an enduring and progressive world organization of
  pure research. They will have come to this special work because their
  distinctive gifts, their inclinations, their positions and opportunities have
  indicated it as theirs.</p>

  <p>Now a very parallel system of Open Conspiracy groups is conceivable, in
  relation to business and industrial life. It would necessarily be a vastly
  bulkier and more heterogeneous system of groups, but otherwise the analogy is
  complete. Here we imagine those people whose gifts, inclinations, positions
  and opportunities as directors, workers, or associates give them an
  exceptional insight into and influence in the processes of producing and
  distributing commodities, can also be drawn together into groups within the
  Open Conspiracy. But these groups will be concerned with the huge and more
  complicated problems of the processes by which even now the small isolated
  individual adventures in production and trading that constituted the economic
  life of former civilizations, are giving place to larger, better instructed,
  better planned industrial organizations, whose operations and combinations
  become at last world wide.</p>

  <p>The amalgamations and combinations, the substitution of large-scale
  business for multitudes of small-scale businesses, which are going on now, go
  on with all the cruelty and disregards of a natural process. If a man is to
  profit and survive, these unconscious blunderings&mdash;which now stagger
  towards but which may never attain world organization&mdash;much be watched,
  controlled, mastered, and directed. As uncertainty diminishes, the quality of
  adventure and the amount of waste diminish also, and large speculative
  profits are no longer possible or justifiable. The transition from
  speculative adventure to organized foresight in the common interest, in the
  whole world of economic life, is the substantial task of the Open Conspiracy.
  And it is these specially interested and equipped groups, and not the
  movement as a whole, which may best begin the attack upon these fundamental
  readjustments.</p>

  <p>The various Socialist movements of the nineteenth and earlier twentieth
  centuries had this in common, that they sought to replace the "private owner"
  in most or all economic interests by some vaguely apprehended "public owner."
  This, following the democratic disposition of the times, was commonly
  conceived of as an elected body, a municipality, the parliamentary state or
  what not. There were municipal socialists, "nationalizing" socialists,
  imperial socialists. In the mystic teachings of the Marxist, the collective
  owner was to be "the dictatorship of the proletariat." Production for profit
  was denounced. The contemporary mind realizes the evils of production for
  profit and of the indiscriminate scrambling of private ownership more fully
  than ever before, but it has a completer realization and a certain
  accumulation of experience in the difficulties of organizing that larger
  ownership we desire. Private ownership may not be altogether evil as a
  provisional stage, even if it has no more in its favour than the ability to
  transcend political boundaries.</p>

  <p>Moreover&mdash;and here again the democratic prepossessions of the
  nineteenth century come in&mdash;the Socialist movements sought to make every
  single adherent a reformer and a propagandist of economic methods. In order
  to do so, it was necessary to simplify economic processes to the crudity of
  nursery toys, and the intricate interplay of will and desire in enterprise,
  normal employment, and direction, in questions of ownership, wages, credit,
  and money, was reduced to a childish fable of surplus value wickedly
  appropriated. The Open Conspiracy is not so much a socialism as a more
  comprehensive offspring which has eaten and assimilated whatever was
  digestible of its socialist forbears. It turns to biology for guidance
  towards the regulation of quantity and a controlled distribution of the human
  population of the world, and it judges all the subsidiary aspects of property
  and pay by the criterion of most efficient production and distribution in
  relation to the indications thus obtained.</p>

  <p>These economic groups, then, of the Open Conspiracy, which may come indeed
  to be a large part of the Open Conspiracy, will be working in that vast task
  of economic reconstruction&mdash;which from the point of view of the older
  socialism was the sole task before mankind. They will be conducting
  experiments and observing processes according to their opportunities. Through
  ad hoc societies and journals they will be comparing and examining their
  methods and preparing reports and clear information for the movement at
  large. The whole question of money and monetary methods in our modern
  communities, so extraordinarily disregarded in socialist literature, will be
  examined under the assumption that money is the token of the community's
  obligation, direct or indirect, to an individual, and credit its permission
  to deal freely with material.</p>

  <p>The whole psychology of industry and industrial relationship needs to be
  revised and restated in terms of the collective efficiency and welfare of
  mankind. And just as far as can be contrived, the counsel and the confidences
  of those who now direct great industrial and financial operations will be
  invoked. The first special task of a banker, or a bank clerk for that matter,
  who joins the Open Conspiracy, will be to answer the questions: "What is a
  bank?" "What are you going to do about it?" "What have we to do about it?"
  The first questions to a manufacturer will be: "What are you making and why?"
  and "What are you and we to do about it?" Instead of the crude proposals to
  "expropriate" and "take over by the State" of the primitive socialism, the
  Open Conspiracy will build up an encyclopædic conception of the modern
  economic complex as a labyrinthine pseudo-system progressively eliminating
  waste and working its way along multitudinous channels towards unity, towards
  clarity of purpose and method, towards abundant productivity and efficient
  social service.</p>

  <p>Let us come back now for a paragraph or so to the ordinary adherent to the
  Open Conspiracy, the adherent considered not in relation to his special
  aptitudes and services, but in relation to the movement as a whole and to
  those special constructive organizations outside his own field. It will be
  his duty to keep his mind in touch with the progressing concepts of the
  scientific work so far as he is able and with the larger issues of the
  economic reconstruction that is afoot, to take his cues from the special
  groups and organizations engaged upon that work, and to help where he finds
  his opportunity and when there is a call upon him. But no adherent of the
  Open Conspiracy can remain merely and completely an ordinary adherent. There
  can be no pawns in the game of the Open Conspiracy, no "cannon fodder" in its
  war. A special activity, quite as much as a general understanding, is
  demanded from everyone who looks creatively towards the future of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>We have instanced first the fine and distinctive world organization of
  pure science, and then the huge massive movement towards co-operating unity
  of aim in the economic life, until at last the production and distribution of
  staple necessities is apprehended as one world business, and we have
  suggested that this latter movement may gradually pervade and incorporate a
  very great bulk of human activities. But besides this fine current and this
  great torrent of evolving activities and relationships there are also a very
  considerable variety of other great functions in the community towards which
  Open Conspiracy groups must direct their organizing enquiries and suggestions
  in their common intention of ultimately assimilating all the confused
  processes of to-day into a world community.</p>

  <p>For example, there must be a series of groups in close touch at one end
  with biological science and at the other with the complex of economic
  activity, who will be concerned specially with the practical administration
  of the biological interests of the race, from food plants and industrial
  products to pestilences and population. And another series of groups will
  gather together attention and energy to focus them upon the educational
  process. We have already pointed out that there is a strong disposition
  towards conservatism in normal educational institutions. They preserve
  traditions rather than develop them. They are likely to set up a considerable
  resistance to the reconstruction of the world outlook upon the threefold
  basis defined in Chapter Fourteen. This resistance must be attacked by
  special societies, by the establishment of competing schools, by help and
  promotion for enlightened teachers, and, wherever the attack is incompletely
  successful, it must be supplemented by the energetic diffusion of educational
  literature for adults, upon modern lines. The forces of the entire movement
  may be mobilized in a variety of ways to bring pressure upon reactionary
  schools and institutions.</p>

  <p>A set of activities correlated with most of the directly creative ones
  will lie through existing political and administrative bodies. The political
  work of the Open Conspiracy must be conducted upon two levels and by entirely
  different methods. Its main political idea, its political strategy, is to
  weaken, efface, incorporate, or supersede existing governments. But there is
  also a tactical diversion of administrative powers and resources to economic
  and educational arrangements of a modern type. Because a country or a
  district is inconvenient as a division and destined to ultimate absorption in
  some more comprehensive and economical system of government, that is no
  reason why its administration should not be brought meanwhile into working
  co-operation with the development of the Open Conspiracy. Free Trade
  nationalism in power is better than high tariff nationalism, and pacificist
  party liberalism better than aggressive party patriotism.</p>

  <p>This evokes the anticipation of another series of groups, a group in every
  possible political division, whose task it will be to organize the whole
  strength of the Open Conspiracy in that division as an effective voting or
  agitating force. In many divisions this might soon become a sufficiently
  considerable block to affect the attitudes and pledges of the national
  politicians. The organization of these political groups into provincial or
  national conferences and systems would follow hard upon their appearance. In
  their programmes they would be guided by meetings and discussions with the
  specifically economic, educational, biological, scientific and cultural
  groups, but they would also form their own special research bodies to work
  out the incessant problems of transition between the old type of locally
  centred administrations and a developing world system of political
  controls.</p>

  <p>In the preceding chapter we sketched the first practicable first phase of
  the Open Conspiracy as the propaganda of a group of interlocking ideas, a
  propaganda associated with pacificist action. In the present chapter we have
  given a scheme of branching and amplifying development. In this scheme. this
  scheme of the second phase, we conceive of the Open Conspiracy as consisting
  of a great multitude and variety of overlapping groups, but now all organized
  for collective political, social, and educational as well as propagandist
  action. They will recognize each other much more clearly than they did at
  first, and they will have acquired a common name.</p>

  <p>The groups, however, almost all of them, will still have specific work
  also. Some will be organizing a sounder setting for scientific progress, some
  exploring new social and educational possibilities, many concentrated upon
  this or that phase in the reorganization of the world's economic life, and so
  forth. The individual Open Conspirator may belong to one or more groups and
  in addition to the ad hoc societies and organizations which the movement will
  sustain, often in co-operation with partially sympathetic people still
  outside its ranks.</p>

  <p>The character of the Open Conspiracy will now be plainly displayed. It
  will have become a great world movement as wide-spread and evident as
  socialism or communism. It will have taken the place of these movements very
  largely. It will be more than they were, it will be frankly a world religion.
  This large, loose assimilatory mass of movements, groups, and societies will
  be definitely and obviously attempting to swallow up the entire population of
  the world and become the new human community.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; EXISTING AND DEVELOPING MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE<br>
  CONTRIBUTORY TO THE OPEN CONSPIRACY AND WHICH MUST DEVELOP<br>
  A COMMON CONSCIOUSNESS. THE PARABLE OF PROVINDER ISLAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A SUGGESTION has already been made in an earlier chapter of
  this essay which may perhaps be expanded here a little more. It is that there
  already exist in the world a considerable number of movements in industry, in
  political life, in social matters, in education, which point in the same
  direction as the Open Conspiracy and are inspired by the same spirit. It will
  be interesting to discuss how far some of these movements may not become
  confluent with others and by a mere process of logical completion identify
  themselves consciously with the Open Conspiracy in its entirety.</p>

  <p>Consider, for example, the movement for a scientific study and control of
  population pressure, known popularly as the Birth Control movement. By
  itself, assuming existing political and economic conditions, this movement
  lays itself open to the charge of being no better than a scheme of "race
  suicide." If a population in some area of high civilization attempts to
  restrict increase, organize its economic life upon methods of maximum
  individual productivity, and impose order and beauty upon its entire
  territory, that region will become irresistibly attractive to any adjacent
  festering mass of low-grade, highly reproductive population. The cheap
  humanity of the one community will make a constant attack upon the other,
  affording facile servility, prostitutes, toilers, hand labour. Tariffs
  against sweated products, restriction of immigration, tensions leading at
  last to a war of defensive massacre are inevitable. The conquest of an
  illiterate, hungry, and incontinent multitude may be almost as disastrous as
  defeat for the selecter race. Indeed, one finds that in discussion the
  propagandists of Birth Control admit that their project must be universal or
  dysgenic. But yet quite a number of them do not follow up these admissions to
  their logical consequences, produce the lines and continue the curves until
  the complete form of the Open Conspiracy appears. It will be the business of
  the early Open Conspiracy propagandists to make them do so, and to install
  groups and representatives at every possible point of vantage in this
  movement.</p>

  <p>And similarly the now very numerous associations for world peace halt in
  alarm on the edge of their own implications. World Peace remains a vast
  aspiration until there is some substitute for the present competition of
  states for markets and raw material, and some restraint upon population
  pressure. League of Nations Societies and all forms of pacificist
  organization are either futile or insincere until they come into line with
  the complementary propositions of the Open Conspiracy.</p>

  <p>The various Socialist movements again are partial projects professing at
  present to be self-sufficient schemes. Most of them involve a pretence that
  national and political forces are intangible phantoms, and that the primary
  issue of population pressure can be ignored. They produce one woolly scheme
  after another for transferring the property in this, that, or the other
  economic plant and interest from bodies of shareholders and company promoters
  to gangs of politicians or syndicates of workers&mdash;to be steered to
  efficiency, it would seem, by pillars of cloud by day and pillars of fire by
  night. The communist party has trained a whole generation of disciples to
  believe that the overthrow of a vaguely apprehended "Capitalism" is the
  simple solution of all human difficulties. No movement ever succeeded so
  completely in substituting phrases for thought. In Moscow communism has
  trampled "Capitalism" underfoot for ten eventful years, and still finds all
  the problems of social and political construction before it.</p>

  <p>But as soon as the Socialist or Communist can be got to realize that his
  repudiation of private monopolization is not a complete programme but just a
  preliminary principle, he is ripe for the ampler concepts of the modern
  outlook. The Open Conspiracy is the natural inheritor of socialist and
  communist enthusiasms; it may be in control of Moscow before it is in control
  of New York.</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy may achieve the more or less complete amalgamation of
  all the radical impulses in the Atlantic community of to-day. But its scope
  is not confined to the variety of sympathetic movements which are brought to
  mind by that loose word radical. In the past fifty years or so, while
  Socialists and Communists have been denouncing the current processes of
  economic life in the same invariable phrases and with the same
  undiscriminating animosity, these processes have been undergoing the
  profoundest and most interesting changes. While socialist thought has recited
  its phrases, with witty rather than substantial variations, a thousand times
  as many clever people have been busy upon industrial, mercantile and
  financial processes. The Socialist still reiterates that this greater body of
  intelligence has been merely seeking private gain, which has just as much
  truth in it as is necessary to make it an intoxicating lie. Everywhere
  competitive businesses have been giving way to amalgamated enterprises,
  marching towards monopoly, and personally owned businesses to organizations
  so large as to acquire more and more the character of publicly responsible
  bodies. In theory in Great Britain, banks are privately owned, and railway
  transport is privately owned, and they are run entirely for profit&mdash;in
  practice their profit making is austerely restrained and their proceedings
  are all the more sensitive to public welfare because they are outside the
  direct control of party politicians.</p>

  <p>Now this transformation of business, trading, and finance has been so
  multitudinous and so rapid as to be still largely unconscious of itself.
  Intelligent men have gone from combination to combination and extended their
  range, year by year, without realizing how their activities were enlarging
  them to conspicuousness and responsibility. Economic organization is even now
  only discovering itself for what it is. It has accepted incompatible existing
  institutions to its own great injury. It has been patriotic and broken its
  shins against the tariff walls its patriotism has raised to hamper its own
  movements it has been imperial and found itself taxed to the limits of its
  endurance, "controlled" by antiquated military and naval experts, and
  crippled altogether. The younger, more vigorous intelligences in the great
  business directorates of to-day are beginning to realize the uncompleted
  implications of their enterprise. A day will come when the gentlemen who are
  trying to control the oil supplies of the world without reference to anything
  else except as a subsidiary factor in their game will be considered to be
  quaint characters. The ends of Big Business must carry Big Business into the
  Open Conspiracy just as surely as every other creative and broadly organizing
  movement is carried.</p>

  <p>Now I know that to all this urging towards a unification of constructive
  effort, a great number of people will be disposed to a reply which will, I
  hope, be less popular in the future than it is at the present time. They will
  assume first an expression of great sagacity, an elderly air. Then, smiling
  gently, they will ask whether there is not something preposterously ambitious
  in looking at the problem of life as one whole. Is it not wiser to
  concentrate our forces on more practicable things, to attempt one thing at a
  time, not to antagonize the whole order of established things against our
  poor desires, to begin tentatively, to refrain from putting too great a
  strain upon people, to trust to the growing common sense of the world to
  adjust this or that line of progress to the general scheme of things. Far
  better accomplish something definite here and there than challenge a general
  failure. That is, they declare, how reformers and creative things have gone
  on in the past; that is how they are going on now; muddling forward in a mild
  and confused and partially successful way. Why not trust them to go on like
  that? Let each man do his bit with a complete disregard of the logical
  interlocking of progressive effort to which I have been drawing
  attention.</p>

  <p>Now I must confess that, popular as this style of argument is, it gives me
  so tedious a feeling that rather than argue against it in general terms I
  will resort to a parable. I will relate the story of the pig on Provinder
  Island.</p>

  <p>There was, you must understand, only one pig on Provinder Island, and
  Heaven knows how it got there, whether it escaped and swam ashore or was put
  ashore from some vessel suddenly converted to vegetarianism, I cannot
  imagine. At first it was the only mammal there. But later on three sailors
  and a very small but observant cabin boy were wrecked there, and after
  subsisting for a time on shell fish and roots they became aware of this pig.
  And simultaneously they became aware of a nearly intolerable craving for
  bacon. The eldest of the three sailors began to think of a ham he had met in
  his boyhood, a beautiful ham for which his father had had the caving knife
  specially sharpened; the second of the three sailors dreamed repeatedly of a
  roast loin of pork he had eaten at his sister's wedding, and the third's mind
  ran on chitterlings&mdash;I know not why. They sat about their meagre fire
  and conferred and expatiated upon these things until their mouths watered and
  the shell fish turned to water within them. What dreams came to the cabin boy
  are unknown, for it was their custom to discourage his confidences. But he
  sat apart brooding and was at last moved to speech. "Let us hunt that old
  pig," he said, "and kill it."</p>

  <p>Now it may have been because it was the habit of these sailors to
  discourage the cabin boy and keep him in his place, but anyhow, for whatever
  reason it was, all three sailors set themselves with one accord to oppose
  that proposal.</p>

  <p>"Who spoke of killing the pig?" said the eldest sailor loudly, looking
  round to see if by any chance the pig was within hearing. "Who spoke of
  killing the pig? You're the sort of silly young devil who jumps at ideas and
  hasn't no sense of difficulties. What I said was AM. All I want is just a Am
  to go with my roots and sea salt. One Am. The Left Am. I don't want the right
  one, and I don't propose to get it. I've got a sense of proportion and a
  proper share of humour, and I know my limitations. I'm a sound, clear-headed,
  practical man. Am is what I'm after, and if I can get that, I'm prepared to
  say Quits and let the rest of the pig alone. Who's for joining me in a Left
  Am Unt&mdash;a simple reasonable Left Am Unt&mdash;just to get One Left
  Am?</p>

  <p>Nobody answered him directly, but when his voice died away, the next
  sailor in order of seniority took up the tale. "That Boy," he said, "will die
  of Swelled Ed, and I pity him. My idea is to follow up the pig and get hold
  of a loin chop. Just simply a loin chop. A loin chop is good enough for me.
  It's&mdash;feasible. Much more feasible than a great Am. Here we are, we've
  got no gun, we've got no wood of a sort to make bows and arrows, we've got
  nothing but our clasp knives, and that pig can run like Ell. It's ridiculous
  to think of killing that pig. But if one didn't trouble him, if one kind of
  got into his confidence and crept near him and just quietly and insidiously
  went for his loin&mdash;just sort of as if one was tickling him-one might get
  a loin chop almost before he knew of it."</p>

  <p>The third sailor sat crumpled up and downcast with his lean fingers
  tangled in his shock of hair. "Chitterlings," he murmured, "chitterlings. I
  don't even want to think of the pig."</p>

  <p>And the cabin boy pursued his own ideas in silence, for he deemed it
  unwise to provoke his elders further.</p>

  <p>On these lines it was the three sailors set about the gratifying of their
  taste for pork, each in his own way, separately and sanely and modestly. And
  each had his reward. The first sailor, after weeks of patience, got within
  arm's length of the pig and smacked that coveted left ham loud and good, and
  felt success was near. The other two heard the smack and the grunt of dismay
  half a mile away. But the pig, in a state of astonishment, carried the ham
  off out of reach, there and then, and that was as close as the first sailor
  ever got to his objective. The roast loin hunter did no better. He came upon
  the pig asleep under a rock one day, and jumped upon the very loin he
  desired, but the pig bit him deeply and septically, and displayed so much
  resentment that the question of a chop was dropped forthwith and never again
  broached between them. And thereafter the arm of the second sailor was
  bandaged and swelled up and went from bad to worse. And as for the third
  sailor, it is doubtful whether he even got wind of a chitterling from the
  start to the finish of this parable. The cabin boy, pursuing notions of his
  own, made a pitfall for the whole pig, but as the others did not help him,
  and as he was an excessively small&mdash;though shrewd&mdash;cabin boy, it
  was a feeble and insufficient pitfall, and all it caught was the hunter of
  chitterlings, who was wandering distraught. After which the hunter of
  chitterlings, became a hunter of cabin boys, and the cabin boy's life, for
  all his shrewdness, was precarious and unpleasant. He slept only in snatches
  and learned the full bitterness of insight misunderstood.</p>

  <p>When at last a ship came to Provinder Island and took off the three men
  and the cabin boy, the pig was still bacon intact and quite gay and cheerful,
  and all four castaways were in a very emaciated condition because at that
  season of the year shell fish were rare, and edible roots were hard to find,
  and the pig was very much cleverer than they were in finding them and digging
  them up&mdash;let alone digesting them.</p>

  <p>From which parable it may be gathered that a partial enterprise is not
  always wiser or more hopeful than a comprehensive one.</p>

  <p>And in the same manner, with myself in the röle of that minute but
  observant cabin boy, I would sustain the proposition that none of these
  movements of partial reconstruction has the sound common sense quality its
  supporters suppose. All these movements are worth while if they can be taken
  into the world-wide movement; all in isolation are futile. They will be
  overlaid and lost in the general drift. The policy of the whole hog is the
  best one, the sanest one, the easiest, and the most hopeful. If sufficient
  men and women of intelligence can realize that simple truth and give up their
  lives to it, mankind may yet achieve a civilization and power and fullness of
  life beyond our present dreams. If they do not, frustration will triumph, and
  war, violence, and a drivelling waste of time and strength and desire, more
  disgusting even than war, will be the lot of our race down through the ages
  to its emaciated and miserable end.</p>

  <p>For this little planet of ours is quite off the course of any rescue
  ships, if the will in our species fails.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; THE CREATIVE HOME, SOCIAL GROUP,<br>
  AND SCHOOL: THE PRESENT WASTE OF IDEALISTIC WILL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HUMAN society began with the family. The natural history of
  gregariousness is a history of the establishment of mutual toleration among
  human animals, so that a litter or a herd keeps together instead of breaking
  up. It is in the family group that the restraints, disciplines, and
  self-sacrifices which make human society possible were worked out and our
  fundamental prejudices established, and it is in the family group, enlarged
  perhaps in many respects, and more and more responsive to collective social
  influences, that our social life must be relearnt, generation after
  generation.</p>

  <p>Now in each generation the Open Conspiracy, until it can develop its own
  reproductive methods, must remain a minority movement of intelligent
  converts. A unified progressive world community demands its own type of home
  and training. It needs to have its fundamental concepts firmly established in
  as many minds as possible and to guard its children from the infection of the
  old racial and national hatreds and jealousies, old superstitions and bad
  mental habits, and base interpretations of life. From its outset the Open
  Conspiracy will be setting itself to influence the existing educational
  machinery, but for a long time it will find itself confronted in school and
  college by powerful religious and political authorities determined to set
  back the children at the point or even behind the point from which their
  patents made their escape. At best, the liberalism of the state-controlled
  schools will be a compromise. Originally schools and colleges were
  transmitters of tradition and conservative forces. So they remain in essence
  to this day.</p>

  <p>Organized teaching has always aimed, and will always tend to guide, train,
  and direct, the mind. The problem of reconstructing education so as to make
  it a releasing instead of a binding process has still to be solved. During
  the early phases of its struggle, therefore, the Open Conspiracy will be
  obliged to adopt a certain sectarianism of domestic and social life in the
  interests of its children, to experiment in novel educational methods and
  educational atmospheres, and it may even in many cases have to consider the
  grouping of its families and the establishment of its own schools. In many
  modern communities, the English-speaking states, for example, there is still
  liberty to establish educational companies, running schools of a special
  type. In every country where that right does not exist it has to be fought
  for.</p>

  <p>There lies a great work for various groups of the Open Conspiracy.
  Successful schools would become laboratories of educational methods and
  patterns for new state schools. Necessarily for a time, but we may hope
  unconsciously, the Open Conspiracy children will become a social élite; from
  their first conscious moments they will begin to think and talk among
  clear-headed people speaking distinctly and behaving frankly, and it will be
  a waste and loss to put them back for the scholastic stage among their
  mentally indistinct and morally muddled contemporaries. A phase when there
  will be a special educational system for the Open Conspiracy seems,
  therefore, to be indicated. Its children will learn to speak, draw, think,
  compute lucidly and subtly, and into their vigorous minds they will take the
  broad concepts of history, biology, and mechanical progress, the basis of the
  new world, naturally and easily. Meanwhile, those who grow up outside the
  advancing educational frontier of the Open Conspiracy will never come under
  the full influence of its ideas, or they will get hold of them only after a
  severe struggle against a mass of misrepresentations and elaborately
  instilled prejudices. An adolescent and adult educational campaign, to undo
  the fixations and suggestions of the normal conservative and reactionary
  schools and colleges, is and will long remain an important part of the work
  of the Open Conspiracy.</p>

  <p>Always, as long as I can remember, there have been a dispute and invidious
  comparisons between the old and the young. The young find the old prey upon
  and restrain them, and the old find the young shallow, disappointing, and
  aimless in vivid contrast to their revised memories of their own early days.
  The present time is one in which these perennial accusations flower with
  exceptional vigour. But there does seem to be some truth in the statement
  that the facilities to live frivolously are greater now than they have ever
  been for old and young alike. For example, in the great modern communities
  that emerge now from Christendom, there is a widespread disposition to regard
  Sunday as merely a holiday. But that was certainly not the original intention
  of Sunday. As we have noted already in an earlier chapter, it was a day
  dedicated to the greater issues of life. Now great multitudes of people do
  not even pretend to set aside any time at all to the greater issues of life.
  The greater issues are neglected altogether. The churches are neglected, and
  nothing of a unifying or exalting sort takes their place.</p>

  <p>What the contemporary senior tells his junior to-day is perfectly correct.
  In his own youth, no serious impulse of his went to waste. He was not
  distracted by a thousand gay but petty temptations, and the local religious
  powers, whatever they happened to be, seemed to believe in themselves more
  and made a more comprehensive attack upon his conscience and imagination. Now
  the old faiths are damaged and discredited, and the new and greater one,
  which is the Open Conspiracy, takes shape only gradually. A decade or so ago,
  socialism preached its confident hopes, and patriotism and imperial pride
  shared its attraction for the ever grave and passionate will of emergent
  youth. Now socialism and democracy are "under revision" and the flags that
  once waved so bravely reek of poison gas, are stiff with blood and mud and
  shameful with exposed dishonesties. Youth is what youth has always been,
  eager for fine interpretations of life, capable of splendid resolves. It has
  no natural disposition towards the shallow and confused life. Its demand as
  ever is, "What am I to do with myself?" But it comes up out of its childhood
  to-day into a world of ruthless exposures and cynical pretensions. We are all
  a little ashamed of "earnestness." The past ten years have seen the shy and
  powerful idealism of youth at a loss and dismayed and ashamed as perhaps it
  has never been before. It is in the world still, but masked, hiding even from
  itself in a whirl of small excitements and futile, defiant depravities.</p>

  <p>The old flags and faiths have lost their magic for the intelligence of the
  young; they can command it no more; it is in the mighty revolution to which
  the Open Conspiracy directs itself that the youth of mankind must find its
  soul, if ever it is to find its soul again.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIVITIES<br>
  OF THE OPEN CONSPIRACY INTO A WORLD CONTROL AND COMMONWEAL:<br>
  THE HAZARDS OF THE ATTEMPT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WE have now sketched out in these Blue Prints the methods by
  which the confused radicalism and constructive forces of the present time
  may, can, and probably will be drawn together about a core of modernized
  religious feeling into one great and multifarious creative effort. A way has
  been shown by which this effort may be developed from a mere propagandist
  campaign and a merely resistant protest against contemporary militarism into
  an organized foreshadowing in research, publicity, and experiment in
  educational, economic, and political reconstructions, of that Pax Mundi which
  has become already the tantalised desire of great multitudes throughout the
  world. These foreshadowings and reconstructions will ignore and transcend the
  political boundaries of to-day. They will continually become more substantial
  as project passes into attempt and performance. In phase after phase and at
  point after point, therefore, the Open Conspiracy will come to grips with the
  powers that sustain these boundaries.</p>

  <p>And it will not be merely topographical boundaries that will be passed.
  The Open Conspiracy will also be dissolving and repudiating many existing
  restrictions upon conduct and many social prejudices. The Open Conspiracy
  proposes to end and shows how an end may be put to that huge substratum of
  underdeveloped, undereducated, subjugated, exploited, and frustrated lives
  upon which such civilization as the world has known hitherto has rested, and
  upon which most of our social systems still rest.</p>

  <p>Whenever possible, the Open Conspiracy will advance by illumination and
  persuasion. But it has to advance, and even from the outset, where it is not
  allowed to illuminate and persuade, it must fight. Its first fights will
  probably be for the right to spread its system of ideas plainly and clearly
  throughout the world.</p>

  <p>There is, I suppose, a flavour of treason about the assumption that any
  established government is provisional, and a quality of immorality in any
  criticism of accepted moral standards. Still more is the proposal, made even
  in times of peace, to resist war levies and conscription an offence against
  absolute conceptions of loyalty. But the ampler wisdom of the modern Atlantic
  communities, already touched by premonitions of change and futurity, has
  continually enlarged the common liberties of thought for some generations,
  and it is doubtful if there will be any serious resistance to the
  dissemination of these views and the early organization of the Open
  Conspiracy in any of the English-speaking communities or throughout the
  British Empire, in the Scandinavian countries, or in such liberal-minded
  countries as Holland, Switzerland, republican Germany or France. France, in
  the hasty years after the war, submitted to some repressive legislation
  against the discussion of birth control or hostile criticism of the
  militarist attitude; but such a check upon mental freedom is altogether
  contrary to the clear and open quality of the French mind; in practice it has
  already been effectively repudiated by such writers as Victor Margueritte,
  and it is unlikely that there will be any effective suppression of the
  opening phases of the Open Conspiracy in France.</p>

  <p>This gives us a large portion of the existing civilized world in which
  men's minds may be readjusted to the idea that their existing governments are
  in the position of trustees for the greater government of the coming age.
  Throughout these communities it is conceivable that the structural lines of
  the world community may be materialized and established with only minor
  struggles, local boycotts, vigorous public controversies, normal legislative
  obstruction, social pressure, and overt political activities. Police, jail,
  expulsions, and so forth, let alone outlawry and warfare, may scarcely be
  brought into this struggle upon the high civilized level of the Atlantic
  communities. But where they are brought in, the Open Conspiracy, to the best
  of its ability and the full extent of its resources, must become a fighting
  force and organize itself upon resistant lines.</p>

  <p>Non-resistance, the restriction of activities to moral suasion is no part
  of the programme of the Open Conspiracy. In the face of unscrupulous
  opposition creative ideas must become aggressive, must define their enemies
  and attack them. By its own organizations or through the police and military
  strength of governments amenable to its ideas, the movement is bound to find
  itself fighting for open roads, open frontiers, freedom of speech, and the
  realities of peace in regions of oppression. The Open Conspiracy rests upon a
  disrespect for nationality, and there is no reason why it should tolerate
  noxious or obstructive governments because they hold their own in this or
  that patch of human territory. It lies within the power of the Atlantic
  communities to impose peace upon the world and secure unimpeded movement and
  free speech from end to end of the earth. This is a fact on which the Open
  Conspiracy must insist. The English-speaking states, France, Germany,
  Holland, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries, and Russia, given only a
  not very extravagant frankness of understanding between them, and a common
  disposition towards the ideas of the Open Conspiracy, could cease to arm
  against each other and still exert enough strength to impose disarmament and
  a respect for human freedom in every corner of the planet. It is fantastic
  pedantry to wait for all the world to accede before all the world is pacified
  and policed.</p>

  <p>The most inconsistent factor in the liberal and radical thought of to-day
  is its prejudice against the interference of highly developed modern states
  in the affairs of less stable and less advanced regions. This is denounced as
  "imperialism," and regarded as criminal. It may have assumed grotesque and
  dangerous forms under the now decaying traditions of national competition,
  but as the merger of the Atlantic states proceeds, the possibility and
  necessity of bringing areas of misgovernment and disorder under world control
  increase. A great war like the war of 1914-1918 may never happen again. The
  common sense of mankind may suffice to avert that. But there is still much
  actual warfare before mankind, on the frontiers everywhere, against brigands,
  against ancient loyalties and traditions which will become at last no better
  than excuses for brigandage and obstructive exaction. All the weight of the
  Open Conspiracy will be on the side of the world order and against that sort
  of local independence which holds back its subject people from the
  citizenship of the world.</p>

  <p>But in this broad prospect of far-reaching political amalgamations under
  the impulses of the Open Conspiracy lurk a thousand antagonisms and adverse
  chances, like the unsuspected gulleys and ravines and thickets in a wide and
  distant landscape. We know not what unexpected chasms may presently be
  discovered. The Open Conspirator may realize that he is one of an advancing
  and victorious force and still find himself outnumbered and outfought in his
  own particular corner of the battlefield. No one can yet estimate the
  possible strength of reaction against world unification; no one can foresee
  the extent of the divisions and confusions that may arise among ourselves.
  The ideas in this book may spread about without any serious resistance in
  most civilized countries, but there are still governments under which the
  persistent expression of such thoughts will be dealt with as crimes and bring
  men and women to prison, torment, and death. Nevertheless, they must be
  expressed.</p>

  <p>While the Open Conspiracy is no more than a discussion it may spread
  unopposed because it is disregarded. As a mainly passive resistance to
  militarism it may still be tolerable. But as its knowledge and experience
  accumulate and its organization become more effective and aggressive, as it
  begins to lay hands upon education, upon social habits, upon business
  developments, as it proceeds to take over the organization of the community,
  it will marshal not only its own forces but its enemies. A complex of
  interests will find themselves restrained and threatened by it, and it may
  easily evoke that most dangerous of human mass feelings, fear. In ways quite
  unpredictable it may raise a storm against itself beyond all our present
  imaginings. Our conception of an almost bloodless domination of the Atlantic
  communities may be merely the confident dream of a thinker whose thoughts
  have yet to be squarely challenged.</p>

  <p>We are not even sure of the common peace. Across the path of mankind the
  storm of another Great War may break, bringing with it for a time more brutal
  repressions and vaster injuries even than its predecessor. The scaffoldings
  and work sheds of the Open Conspiracy may fare violently in that tornado. The
  restoration of progress may seem an almost hopeless struggle.</p>

  <p>It is no part of modern religion to incur needless hardship or go out of
  the way to seek martyrdom. If we can do our work easily and happily, so it
  should be done. But the work is not to be shirked because it cannot be done
  easily and happily. The vision of a world at peace and liberated for an
  unending growth of knowledge and power is worth every danger of the way. And
  since in this age of confusion we must live imperfectly and anyhow die, we
  may as well suffer, if need be, and die for a great end as for none. Never
  has the translation of vision into realities been easy since the beginning of
  human effort. The establishment of the world community will surely exact a
  price --and who can tell what that price may be?&mdash;in toil, suffering,
  and blood.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">XIX. &mdash; HUMAN LIFE IN THE COMING WORLD
     COMMUNITY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE new life that the Open Conspiracy struggles to achieve
  through us for our race is first a life of liberations.</p>

  <p>The oppression of incessant toil can surely be lifted from everyone, and
  the miseries due to a great multitude of infections and disorders of
  nutrition and growth cease to be a part of human experience. Few people are
  perfectly healthy nowadays except for brief periods of happiness, but the
  elation of physical well-being will some day be the common lot of
  mankind.</p>

  <p>And not only from natural evils will man be largely free. He will not be
  left with his soul tangled, haunted by monstrous and irrational fears and a
  prey to malicious impulse. From his birth he will breathe sweetness and
  generosity and use his mind and hands cleanly and exactly. He will feel
  better, will better, think better, see, taste, and hear better than men do
  now. His undersoul will no longer be a mutinous cavern of ill-treated
  suppressions and of impulses repressed without understanding. All these
  releases are plainly possible for him. They pass out of his tormented desire
  now, they elude and mock him, because chance, confusion, and squalor rule his
  life. All the gifts of destiny are overlaid and lost to him. He must still
  suspect and fear. Not one of us is yet as clear and free and happy within
  himself as most men will some day be. Before mankind lies the prospect not
  only of health but of magnanimity.</p>

  <p>Within the peace and freedom that the Open Conspiracy is winning for us,
  all these good things that escape us now may be ensured. A graver humanity,
  stronger, more lovely, longer lived, will learn and develop the ever
  enlarging possibilities of its destiny. For the first time, the full beauty
  of this world will be revealed to its unhurried eyes. Its thoughts will be to
  our thoughts as the thoughts of a man to the troubled mental experimenting of
  a child. And all the best of us will be living on in that ampler life, as the
  child and the things it tried and learnt still live in the man. When we were
  children, we could not think or feel as we think and feel to-day, but to-day
  we can peer back and still recall something of the ignorances and guesses and
  wild hopes of these nigh forgotten years.</p>

  <p>And so mankind, ourselves still living, but dispersed and reconstructed
  again in the future, will recall with affection and understanding the
  desperate wishes and troubled efforts of our present state.</p>

  <p>How far can we anticipate the habitations and ways, the usages and
  adventures, the mighty employments, the ever increasing knowledge and power
  of the days to come? No more than a child with its scribbling paper and its
  box of bricks can picture or model the undertakings of its adult years. Our
  battle is with cruelties and frustrations, stupid, heavy and hateful things
  from which we shall escape at last, less like victors conquering a world than
  like sleepers awaking from a nightmare in the dawn. From any dream, however
  dismal and horrible, one can escape by realizing that it is a dream; by
  saying, "I will awake."</p>

  <p>The Open Conspiracy is the awaking of mankind from a nightmare, an
  infantile nightmare, of the struggle for existence and the inevitability of
  war. The light of day thrusts between our eyelids, and the multitudinous
  sounds of morning clamour in our ears. A time will come when men will sit
  with history before them or with some old newspaper before them and ask
  incredulously, "Was there ever such a world?"</p>
