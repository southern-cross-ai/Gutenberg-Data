    </p>
    <p>
      Considering that Philip Lucas's aunt who died early in
      April was no less than eighty-three years old, and had
      spent the last seven of them bedridden in a private lunatic
      asylum, it had been generally and perhaps reasonably hoped
      among his friends and those of his wife that the
      bereavement would not be regarded by either of them as an
      intolerable tragedy. Mrs. Quantock, in fact, who, like
      everybody else at Riseholme, had sent a neat little note of
      condolence to Mrs. Lucas, had, without using the actual
      words "happy release," certainly implied it or its close
      equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was hoping that there would be a reply to it, for
      though she had said in her note that her dear Lucia mustn't
      dream of answering it, that was a mere figure of speech,
      and she had instructed her parlour-maid who took it across
      to 'The Hurst' immediately after lunch to say that she
      didn't know if there was an answer, and would wait to see,
      for Mrs. Lucas might perhaps give a little hint ever so
      vaguely about what the expectations were concerning which
      everybody was dying to get information. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      While she waited for this, Daisy Quantock was busy, like
      everybody else in the village on this beautiful afternoon
      of spring, with her garden, hacking about with a small but
      destructive fork in her flower-beds. She was a gardener of
      the ruthless type, and went for any small green thing that
      incautiously showed a timid spike above the earth,
      suspecting it of being a weed. She had had a slight
      difference with the professional gardener who had hitherto
      worked for her on three afternoons during the week, and had
      told him that his services were no longer required. She
      meant to do her gardening herself this year, and was
      confident that a profusion of beautiful flowers and a
      plethora of delicious vegetables would be the result. At
      the end of her garden path was a barrow of rich manure,
      which she proposed, when she had finished the slaughter of
      the innocents, to dig into the depopulated beds. On the
      other side of her paling her neighbour Georgie Pillson was
      rolling his strip of lawn, on which during the summer he
      often played croquet on a small scale. Occasionally they
      shouted remarks to each other, but as they got more and
      more out of breath with their exertions the remarks got
      fewer. Mrs. Quantock's last question had been "What do you
      do with slugs, Georgie?" and Georgie had panted out,
      "Pretend you don't see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quantock had lately grown rather stout owing to a diet
      of sour milk, which with plenty of sugar was not palatable;
      but sour milk and pyramids of raw vegetables had quite
      stopped all the symptoms of consumption which the study of
      a small but lurid medical manual had induced. To-day she
      had eaten a large but normal lunch in order to test the
      merits of her new cook, who certainly was a success, for
      her husband had gobbled up his food with great avidity
      instead of turning it over and over with his fork as if it
      was hay. In consequence, stoutness, surfeit, and so much
      stooping had made her feel rather giddy, and she was
      standing up to recover, wondering if this giddiness was a
      symptom of something dire, when de Vere, for such was the
      incredible name of her parlour-maid, came down the steps
      from the dining-room with a note in her hand. So Mrs.
      Quantock hastily took off her gardening gloves of stout
      leather, and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sentence of formal thanks for her sympathy
      which Mrs. Lucas immensely prized, and then followed these
      ridiculous words:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      It has been a terrible blow to my poor Pepino and myself.
      We trusted that Auntie Amy might have been spared us for a
      few years yet.<br>
      <br>
      <table align="right" summary="">
        <tr>
          <td align="right">
            Ever, dear Daisy, your sad
          </td>

        <tr>

      </table><br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      And not a word about expectations! . . . Lucia's dear Daisy
      crumpled up the absurd note, and said "Rubbish," so loud
      that Georgie Pillson in the next garden thought he was
      being addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, come to the fence a minute," said Mrs. Quantock.
      "I want to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, longing for a little gossip, let go of the handle
      of his roller, which, suddenly released, gave a loud squeak
      and rapped him smartly on the elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tarsome thing!" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the fence and, being tall, could look over it.
      There was Mrs. Quantock angrily poking Lucia's note into
      the flower-bed she had been weeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" said Georgie. "Shall I like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face red and moist with exertion, appearing just over
      the top of the fence, looked like the sun about to set
      below the flat grey horizon of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know if you'll like it," said Daisy, "but it's
      your Lucia. I sent her a little note of condolence about
      the aunt, and she says it has been a terrible blow to
      Pepino and herself. They hoped that the old lady might have
      been spared them a few years yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Georgie, wiping the moisture off his forehead
      with the back of one of his beautiful pearl-grey gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she did," said the infuriated Daisy, "they were her
      very words. I could show you if I hadn't dug it in. Such a
      pack of nonsense! I hope that long before I've been
      bedridden for seven years, somebody will strangle me with a
      bootlace, or anything handy. Why does Lucia pretend to be
      sorry? What does it all mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had long been devoted henchman to Lucia (Mrs.
      Lucas, wife of Philip Lucas, and so Lucia), and though he
      could criticise her in his mind, when he was alone in his
      bed or his bath, he always championed her in the face of
      the criticism of others. Whereas Daisy criticised everybody
      everywhere. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it means what it says," he observed with the
      delicate sarcasm that never had any effect on his
      neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't possibly do that," said Mrs. Quantock. "Neither
      Lucia nor Pepino have set eyes on his aunt for years, nor
      spoken of her. Last time Pepino went to see her she bit
      him. Sling for a week afterwards, don't you remember, and
      he was terrified of blood-poisoning. How can her death be a
      blow, and as for her being spared--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quantock suddenly broke off, remembering that de Vere
      was still standing there and drinking it all in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all, de Vere," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, ma'am," said de Vere, striding back towards the
      house. She had high-heeled shoes on, and each time she
      lifted her foot, the heel which had been embedded by her
      weight in the soft lawn came out with the sound of a cork
      being drawn. Then Daisy came closer to the fence, with the
      light of inductive reasoning, which was much cultivated at
      Riseholme, veiling the fury of her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I've got it," she said. "I've guessed what it
      means."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now though Georgie was devoted to his Lucia, he was just as
      devoted to inductive reasoning, and Daisy Quantock was,
      with the exception of himself, far the most powerful
      logician in the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, then?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stupid of me not to have thought of it at once," said
      Daisy. "Why, don't you see? Pepino is Auntie's heir, for
      she was unmarried, and he's the only nephew, and probably
      he has been left piles and piles. So naturally they say
      it's a terrible blow. Wouldn't do to be exultant. They must
      say it's a terrible blow, to show they don't care about the
      money. The more they're left, the sadder it is. So natural.
      I blame myself for not having thought of it at once. Have
      you seen her since?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for a quiet talk," said Georgie. "Pepino was there,
      and a man who, I think, was Pepino's lawyer. He was
      frightfully deferential."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That proves it," said Daisy. "And nothing said of any
      kind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's face screwed itself up in the effort to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there was something," he said, "but I was talking to
      Lucia, and the others were talking rather low. But I did
      hear the lawyer say something to Pepino about pearls. I do
      remember the word pearls. Perhaps it was the old lady's
      pearls."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quantock gave a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It couldn't have been Pepino's," she said. "He has one in
      a tie-pin. It's called pear-shaped, but there's little
      shape about it. When do wills come out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ages," said Georgie. "Months. And there's a house in
      London, I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whereabouts?" asked Daisy greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's face assumed a look of intense concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't tell you for certain," he said, "but I know
      Pepino went up to town not long ago to see about some
      repairs to his aunt's house, and I think it was the roof."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't matter where the repairs were," said Daisy
      impatiently. "I want to know where the house was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You interrupt me," said Georgie. "I was telling you. I
      know he went to Harrod's afterwards and walked there,
      because he and Lucia were dining with me and he said so. So
      the house must have been close to Harrod's, quite close I
      mean, because it was raining, and if it had been any
      reasonable distance he would have had a taxi. So it might
      be Knightsbridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quantock put on her gardening-gloves again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How frightfully secretive people are," she said. "Fancy
      his never having told you where his aunt's house was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they never spoke of her," said Georgie. "She's been in
      that nursing-home so many years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may call it a nursing-home," observed Mrs. Quantock,
      "or, if you choose, you may call it a post office. But it
      was an asylum. And they're just as secretive about the
      property."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you never talk about the property till after the
      funeral," said Georgie. "I believe it's to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quantock gave a prodigious sniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They would have, if there hadn't been any," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How horrid you are," said Georgie. "How--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His speech was cut off by several loud sneezes. However
      beautiful the sleeve-links, it wasn't wise to stand without
      a coat after being in such a heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How what?" asked Mrs. Quantock, when the sneezing was
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've forgotten now. I shall get back to my rolling. A
      little chilly. I've done half the lawn."
    </p>
    <p>
      A telephone-bell had been ringing for the last few seconds,
      and Mrs. Quantock localised it as being in his house, not
      hers. Georgie was rather deaf, however much he pretended
      not to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your telephone bell's ringing, Georgie," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought it was," said Georgie, who had not heard it at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And come in presently for a cup of tea," shouted Mrs.
      Quantock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should love to. But I must have a bath first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie hurried indoors, for a telephone call usually meant
      a little gossip with a friend. A very familiar voice,
      though a little husky and broken, asked if it was he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's me, Lucia," he said in soft firm tones of
      sympathy. "How are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sighed. It was a long, very audible, intentional
      sigh. Georgie could visualise her putting her mouth quite
      close to the telephone, so as to make sure it carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite well," she said. "And so is my Pepino, thank heaven.
      Bearing up wonderfully. He's just gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was on the point of asking where, but guessed in
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," he said. "And you didn't go. I'm very glad. So
      wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt I couldn't," she said, "and he urged me not. It's
      to-morrow. He sleeps in London to-night--"
    </p>
    <p>
      (Again Georgie longed to say "where," for it was impossible
      not to wonder if he would sleep in the house of unknown
      locality near Harrod's.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he'll be back to-morrow evening," said Lucia without
      pause. "I wonder if you would take pity on me and come and
      dine. Just something to eat, you know: the house is so
      upset. Don't dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delighted," said Georgie, though he had ordered oysters.
      But they could be scolloped for to-morrow. . . . "Love to
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eight o'clock then? Nobody else of course. If you care to
      bring our Mozart duet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather," said Georgie. "Good for you to be occupied,
      Lucia. We'll have a good go at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Georgie," said Lucia faintly. He heard her sigh
      again, not quite so successfully, and replace the earpiece
      with a click.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie moved away from the telephone, feeling immensely
      busy: there was so much to think about and to do. The first
      thing was to speak about the oysters, and, his parlour-maid
      being out, he called down the kitchen-stairs. The absence
      of Foljambe made it necessary for him to get his bath ready
      himself, and he turned the hot water tap half on, so that
      he could run downstairs again and out into the garden (for
      there was not time to finish the lawn if he was to have a
      bath and change before tea) in order to put the roller back
      in the shed. Then he had to get his clothes out, and select
      something which would do for tea and also for dinner, as
      Lucia had told him not to dress. There was a new suit which
      he had not worn yet, rather daring, for the trousers, dark
      fawn, were distinctly of Oxford cut, and he felt quite
      boyish as he looked at them. He had ordered them in a
      moment of reckless sartorial courage, and a quiet tea with
      Daisy Quantock, followed by a quiet dinner with Lucia, was
      just the way to make a beginning with them, far better than
      wearing them for the first time at church on Sunday, when
      the whole of Riseholme simultaneously would see them. The
      coat and waistcoat were very dark blue: they would look
      blue at tea and black at dinner; and there were some grey
      silk socks, rather silvery, and a tie to match them. These
      took some time to find, and his search was interrupted by
      volumes of steam pouring into his bedroom from his
      bathroom; he ran in to find the bath full nearly to the
      brim of boiling water. It had been little more than
      lukewarm yesterday, and his cook had evidently taken to
      heart his too-sharp words after breakfast this morning. So
      he had to pull up the plug of his bath to let the boiling
      contents subside, and fill up with cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to his bedroom and began undressing. All this
      news about Lucia and Pepino, with Daisy Quantock's
      penetrating comments, was intensely interesting. Old Miss
      Lucas had been in this nursing-home or private asylum for
      years, and Georgie didn't suppose that the inclusive
      charges could be less than fifteen pounds a week, and
      fifteen times fifty-two was a large sum. That was income
      too, and say it was at five per cent., the capital it
      represented was considerable. Then there was that house in
      London. If it was freehold, that meant a great deal more
      capital: if it was on lease it meant a great deal more
      income. Then there were rates and taxes, and the wages of a
      caretaker, and no doubt a margin. And there were the
      pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie took a half-sheet of paper from the drawer in a
      writing-table where he kept half-sheets and pieces of
      string untied from parcels, and began to calculate. There
      was necessarily a good deal of guesswork about it, and the
      pearls had to be omitted altogether, since nobody could say
      what "pearls" were worth without knowing their quantity or
      quality. But even omitting these, and putting quite a low
      figure on the possible rent of the house near Harrod's, he
      was astounded at the capital which these annual outgoings
      appeared to represent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't put it at a penny less than fifty thousand
      pounds," he said to himself, "and the income at two
      thousand six hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had got a little chilly as he sat at his figures, and
      with a luxurious foretaste of a beautiful hot bath, he
      hurried into his bathroom. The whole of the boiling water
      had run out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How tarsome! Damn!" said Georgie, putting in the plug and
      turning on both taps simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      His calculations, of course, had only been the materials on
      which his imagination built, and as he dressed it was hard
      at work, between glances at his trousers as reflected in
      the full-length mirror which stood in his window. What
      would Lucia and Pepino do with this vast increase of
      fortune? Lucia already had the biggest house in Riseholme
      and the most Elizabethan decor, and a motor, and as many
      new clothes as she chose. She did not spend much on them
      because her lofty mind despised clothes, but Georgie
      permitted himself to indulge cynical reflections that the
      pearls might make her dressier. Then she already
      entertained as much as she felt disposed; and more money
      would not make her wish to give more dinners. And she went
      up to London whenever there was anything in the way of
      pictures or plays or music which she felt held the seed of
      culture. Society (so-called) she despised as thoroughly as
      she despised clothes, and always said she came back to
      Riseholme feeling intellectually starved. Perhaps she would
      endow a permanent fund for holding May-day revels on the
      village green, for Lucia had said she meant to have May-day
      revels every year. They had been a great success last year,
      though fatiguing, for everybody dressed up in sixteenth
      century costume, and danced Morris dances till they all
      hobbled home dead lame at the merciful sunset. It had all
      been wonderfully Elizabethan, and Georgie's jerkin had hurt
      him very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was a wonderful character, thought Georgie, and she
      would find a way to spend two or three thousand a year more
      in an edifying and cultured manner. (Were Oxford trousers
      meant to turn up at the bottom? He thought not: and how
      small these voluminous folds made your feet look.) Georgie
      knew what he himself would do with two or three thousand a
      year more: indeed he had often considered whether he would
      not try to do it without. He wanted, ever so much, to have
      a little flat in London (or a couple of rooms would serve),
      just for a dip every now and then in the life which Lucia
      found so vapid. But he knew he wasn't a strong, serious
      character like Lucia, whose only frivolities were artistic
      or Elizabethan.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eye fell on a large photograph on the table by his
      bedside in a silver frame, representing Brunnhilde. It was
      signed "Olga to beloved Georgie," and his waistcoat felt
      quite tight as, drawing in a long breath, he recalled that
      wonderful six months when Olga Bracely, the prima donna,
      had bought Old Place, and lived here, and had altered all
      the values of everything. Georgie believed himself to have
      been desperately in love with her, but it had been a very
      exciting time for more reasons than that. Old values had
      gone: she had thought Riseholme the most splendid joke that
      had ever been made; she loved them all and laughed at them
      all, and nobody minded a bit, but followed her whims as if
      she had been a Pied Piper. All but Lucia, that is to say,
      whose throne had, quite unintentionally on Olga's part,
      been pulled smartly from under her, and her sceptre flew in
      one direction, and her crown in another. Then Olga had gone
      off for an operatic tour in America, and, after six
      triumphant months there, had gone on to Australia. But she
      would be back in England by now, for she was singing in
      London this season, and her house at Riseholme, so long
      closed, would be open again. . . . And the coat buttoned
      beautifully, just the last button, leaving the rest
      negligently wide and a little loose. Georgie put an
      amethyst tie-pin in his grey tie, which gave a pretty touch
      of colour, brushed his hair back from his forehead, so that
      the toupée was quite indistinguishable from his own hair,
      and hurried downstairs to go out to tea with Daisy
      Quantock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was seated at her writing-table when he entered, very
      busy with a pencil and piece of paper and counting
      something up on her fingers. Her gardening-fork lay in the
      grate with the fire-irons, on the carpet there were one or
      two little sausages of garden-mould, which no doubt had
      peeled off from her boots, and her gardening gloves were on
      the floor by her side. Georgie instantly registered the
      conclusion that something important must have occurred, and
      that she had come indoors in a great hurry, because the
      carpet was nearly new, and she always made a great fuss if
      the smallest atom of cigarette ash dropped on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty-seven, forty-seven, fifty-two, and carry five," she
      muttered, as Georgie stood in front of the fire, so that
      the entire new suit should be seen at once. "Wait a moment,
      Georgie--and seventeen and five's twenty-three--no,
      twenty-two, and that's put me out: I must begin again. That
      can't be right. Help yourself, if de Vere has brought in
      tea, and if not ring--Oh, I left out the four, and
      altogether it's two thousand five hundred pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had thought at first that Daisy was merely doing
      some belated household accounts, but the moment she said
      two thousand five hundred pounds he guessed, and did not
      even go through the formality of asking what was two
      thousand five hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I made it two thousand six hundred," he said. "But we're
      pretty well agreed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally Daisy understood that he understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you reckoned the pearls as capital," she said,
      "and added the interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No I didn't," he said. "How could I tell how much they
      were worth? I didn't reckon them in at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's a lot of money," said Daisy. "Let's have tea.
      What will she do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed quite blind to the Oxford trousers, and Georgie
      wondered whether that was from mere feebleness of vision.
      Daisy was short-sighted, though she steadily refused to
      recognise that, and would never wear spectacles. In fact,
      Lucia had made an unkind little epigram about it at a time
      when there was a slight coolness between the two, and had
      said "Dear Daisy is too short-sighted to see how
      short-sighted she is." Of course it was unkind, but very
      brilliant, and Georgie had read through "The Importance of
      Being Earnest" which Lucia had gone up to town to see, in
      the hopes of discovering it. . . . Or was Daisy's
      unconsciousness of his trousers merely due to her
      preoccupation with Lucia's probable income? . . . Or were
      the trousers, after all, not so daring as he had thought
      them?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down with one leg thrown carelessly over the arm of
      his chair, so that Daisy could hardly fail to see it. Then
      he took a piece of tea-cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do tell me what you think she will do with it?" he
      asked. "I've been puzzling over it too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't imagine," said Daisy. "She's got everything she
      wants now. Perhaps they'll just hoard it, in order that
      when Pepino dies we may all see how much richer he was than
      we ever imagined. That's too posthumous for me. Give me
      what I want now, and a pauper's funeral afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me too," said Georgie, waving his leg. "But I don't think
      Lucia will do that. It did occur to me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The house in London, you mean," said Daisy, swiftly
      interrupting. "Of course if they kept both houses open,
      with a staff in each, so that they could run up and down as
      they chose, that would make a big hole in it. Lucia has
      always said that she couldn't live in London, but she may
      manage it if she's got a house there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm dining with her to-night," said Georgie. "Perhaps
      she'll say something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quantock was very thirsty with her gardening, and the
      tea was very hot. She poured it into her saucer and blew on
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia would be wise not to waste any time," she said, "if
      she intends to have any fun out of it, for, you know,
      Georgie, we're beginning to get old. I'm fifty-two. How old
      are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie disliked that barbarous sort of question. He had
      been the young man of Riseholme so long that the habit was
      ingrained, and he hardly believed that he was forty-eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forty-three," he said, "but what does it matter how old we
      are, as long as we're busy and amused? And I'm sure Lucia
      has got all the energy and life she ever had. I shouldn't
      be a bit surprised if she made a start in London, and went
      in for all that. Then, of course, there's Pepino, but he
      only cares for writing his poetry and looking through his
      telescope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate that telescope," said Daisy. "He took me up on to
      the roof the other night and showed me what he said was
      Mars, and I'll take my oath he said that the same one was
      Venus only a week before. But as I couldn't see anything
      either time, it didn't make much difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and Mr. Quantock came in. Robert was like
      a little round brown sarcastic beetle. Georgie got up to
      greet him, and stood in the full blaze of the light. Robert
      certainly saw his trousers, for his eyes seemed unable to
      quit the spreading folds that lay round Georgie's ankles:
      he looked at them as if he was Cortez and they some new
      planet. Then without a word he folded his arms and danced a
      few steps of what was clearly meant to be a sailor's
      hornpipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heave-ho, Georgie," he said. "Belay there and avast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is he talking about?" said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, quite apart from his general good-nature, always
      strove to propitiate Mr. Quantock. He was far the most
      sarcastic person in Riseholme and could say sharp things
      straight off, whereas Georgie had to think a long time
      before he got a nasty edge to any remark, and then his
      good-nature generally forbade him to slash with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's talking about my new clothes," he said, "and he's
      being very naughty. Any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any news?" was the general gambit of conversation in
      Riseholme. It could not have been bettered, for there
      always was news. And there was now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Pepino's gone to the station," said Mr. Quantock.
      "Just like a large black crow. Waved a black hand. Bah! Why
      not call a release a release and have done with it? And if
      you don't know--why, I'll tell you. It's because they're
      rolling in riches. Why, I've calculated--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" said Daisy and Georgie simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you've been calculating too?" said Mr. Quantock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might have a sweepstake for the one who gets nearest. I
      say three thousand a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so much," said Georgie and Daisy again simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. But that's no reason why I shouldn't have a
      lump of sugar in my tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, no," said Daisy genially. "But how do you make it
      up to three thousand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By addition," said this annoying man. "There'll be every
      penny of that. I was at the lending library after lunch,
      and those who could add made it all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy turned to Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be alone with Lucia then to-night," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I knew that," said Georgie. "She told me Pepino had
      gone. I expect he's sleeping in that house to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Quantock produced his calculations, and the argument
      waxed hot. It was still raging when Georgie left in order
      to get a little rest before going on to dinner, and to
      practise the Mozart duet. He and Lucia hadn't tried it
      before, so it was as well to practise both parts, and let
      her choose which she liked. Foljambe had come back from her
      afternoon out, and told him that there had been a trunk
      call for him while he was at tea, but she could make
      nothing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somebody in a great hurry, sir," she said, "and kept
      asking if I was--excuse me, sir, if I was Georgie--I kept
      saying I wasn't, but I'd fetch you. That wouldn't do, and
      she said she'd telegraph."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who was it?" asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't say, sir. She never gave a name, but only kept
      asking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She?" asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sounded like one!" said Foljambe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most mysterious," said Georgie. It couldn't be either of
      his sisters, for they sounded not like a she but a he. So
      he lay down on his sofa to rest a little before he took a
      turn at the Mozart.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The evening had turned chilly, and he put on his blue cape
      with the velvet collar to trot across to Lucia's house. The
      parlour-maid received him with a faint haggard smile of
      recognition, and then grew funereal again, and preceding
      him, not at her usual brisk pace, but sadly and slowly,
      opened the door of the music-room and pronounced his name
      in a mournful whisper. It was a gay cheerful room, in the
      ordinary way; now only one light was burning, and from the
      deepest of the shadows, there came a rustling, and Lucia
      rose to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, dear," she said. "Good of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie held her hand a moment longer than was usual, and
      gave it a little extra pressure for the conveyance of
      sympathy. Lucia, to acknowledge that, pressed a little
      more, and Georgie tightened his grip again to show that he
      understood, until their respective finger-nails grew white
      with the conveyance and reception of sympathy. It was
      rather agonising, because a bit of skin on his little
      finger had got caught between two of the rings on his third
      finger, and he was glad when they quite understood each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it was not to be expected that in these first
      moments Lucia should notice his trousers. She herself was
      dressed in deep mourning, and Georgie thought he recognised
      the little cap she wore as being that which had faintly
      expressed her grief over the death of Queen Victoria. But
      black suited her, and she certainly looked very well.
      Dinner was announced immediately, and she took Georgie's
      arm, and with faltering steps they went into the
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had determined that his role was to be sympathetic,
      but bracing. Lucia must rally from this blow, and her
      suggestion that he should bring the Mozart duet was
      hopeful. And though her voice was low and unsteady, she did
      say, as they sat down,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've hardly been outside my house and garden all day,"
      said Georgie. "Rolling the lawn. And Daisy Quantock--did
      you know?--has had a row with her gardener, and is going to
      do it all herself. So there she was next door with a fork
      and a wheelbarrow full of manure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a wan smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Daisy!" she said. "What a garden it will be! Anything
      else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I had tea with them, and while I was out, there was a
      trunk-call for me. So tarsome. Whoever it was couldn't make
      any way, and she's going to telegraph. I can't imagine who
      it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder!" said Lucia in an interested voice. Then she
      recollected herself again. "I had a sort of presentiment,
      Georgie, when I saw that telegram for Pepino on the table,
      two days ago, that it was bad news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curious," said Georgie. "And what delicious fish! How do
      you always manage to get better things than any of us? It
      tastes of the sea. And I am so hungry after all my work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia went firmly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I took it to poor Pepino," she said, "and he got quite
      white. And then--so like him--he thought of me. 'It's bad
      news, darling,' he said, 'and we've got to help each other
      to bear it!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So like Pepino," said Georgie. "Mr. Quantock saw him going
      to the station. Where is he going to sleep to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia took a little more fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Auntie's house in Brompton Square," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So <i>that's</i> where it is!" thought Georgie. If there
      was a light anywhere in Daisy's house, except in the
      attics, he would have to go in for a minute, on his return
      home, and communicate the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she had a house there, had she?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a charming house," said Lucia, "and full, of course,
      of dear old memories to Pepino. It will be very trying for
      him, for he used to go there when he was a boy to see
      Auntie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And has she left it him?" asked Georgie, trying to make
      his voice sound unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and it's a freehold," said Lucia. "That makes it
      easier to dispose of if Pepino settles to sell it. And
      beautiful Queen Anne furniture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, how delicious!" said Georgie. "Probably worth a
      fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was certainly rallying from the terrible blow, but
      she did not allow herself to rally too far, and shook her
      head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pepino would hate to have to part with Auntie's things,"
      she said. "So many memories. He can recollect her sitting
      at the walnut bureau (one of those tall ones, you know,
      which let down in front, and the handles of the drawers all
      original), doing her accounts in the morning. And a picture
      of her with her pearls over the fireplace by Sargent; quite
      an early one. Some fine Chinese Chippendale chairs in the
      dining-room. We must try to keep some of the things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie longed to ask a hundred questions, but it would not
      be wise, for Lucia was so evidently enjoying letting these
      sumptuous details leak out mingled with memories. He was
      beginning to feel sure that Daisy's cynical suggestion was
      correct, and that the stricken desolation of Pepino and
      Lucia cloaked a very substantial inheritance. Bits of
      exultation kept peeping out, and Lucia kept poking them
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where will you put all those lovely things, if you
      sell the house?" he asked. "Your house here is so perfect
      already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing is settled yet," said Lucia. "Neither he nor I can
      think of anything but dear Auntie. Such a keen intelligent
      mind she had when Pepino first remembered her. Very
      good-looking still in the Sargent picture. And it was all
      so sudden, when Pepino saw her last she was so full of
      vigour."
    </p>
    <p>
      ("That was the time she bit him," thought Georgie.) Aloud
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you must feel it dreadfully. What is the
      Sargent? A kit-cat or a full length?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Full length, I believe," said Lucia. "I don't know where
      we could put it here. And a William III whatnot. But of
      course it is not possible to think about that yet. A glass
      of port?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to give you one," said Georgie, "it's just what
      you want after all your worries and griefs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia pushed her glass towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just half a glass," she said. "You are so dear and
      understanding, Georgie; I couldn't talk to anyone but you,
      and perhaps it does me good to talk. There is some
      wonderful port in Auntie's cellar, Pepino says."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go into the music-room," she said. "We will talk a
      little more, and then play our Mozart if I feel up to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That'll do you good too," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia felt equal to having more illumination than there had
      been when she rose out of the shadows before dinner, and
      they established themselves quite cosily by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be a terrible lot of business for Pepino," she
      said. "Luckily his lawyer is the same firm as Auntie's, and
      quite a family friend. Whatever Auntie had, so he told us,
      goes to Pepino, though we haven't really any idea what it
      is. But with death duties and succession duties, I know we
      shall have to be prepared to be very poor until they are
      paid off, and the duties increase so iniquitously in
      proportion to the inheritance. Then everything in Brompton
      Square has to be valued, and we have to pay on the entire
      contents, the very carpets and rugs are priced, and some
      are beautiful Persians. And then there's the valuer to pay,
      and all the lawyer's charges. And when all that has been
      paid and finished, there is the higher super-tax."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there's a bigger income," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's one way of looking at it," said Lucia. "But
      Pepino says that the charges will be enormous. And there's
      a beautiful music-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave him one of her rather gimlet-like looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgino, I suppose everybody in Riseholme is all agog to
      know what Pepino has been left. That is so dreadfully
      vulgar, but I suppose it's natural. Is everybody talking
      about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have heard it mentioned," said Georgie. "But I
      don't see why it's vulgar. I'm interested in it myself. It
      concerns you and Pepino, and what concerns one's friends
      must be of interest to one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Caro,</i> I know that," said Lucia. "But so much more
      than the actual money is the responsibility it brings.
      Pepino and I have all we want for our quiet little needs,
      and now this great increase of wealth is coming to
      us--great, that is, compared to our modest little income
      now--and, as I say, it brings its responsibilities. We
      shall have to use wisely and without extravagance whatever
      is left after all these immense expenses have been paid.
      That meadow at the bottom of the garden, of course, we
      shall buy at once, so that there will no longer be any fear
      of its being built over and spoiling the garden. And then
      perhaps a new telescope for Pepino. But what do I want in
      Riseholme beyond what I've got? Music and friends, and the
      power to entertain them, my books and my flowers. Perhaps a
      library, built on at the end of the wing, where Pepino can
      be undisturbed, and perhaps every now and then a string
      quartette down from London. That will give a great deal of
      pleasure, and music is more than pleasure, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she turned the gimlet-look onto Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then there's the house in Brompton Square," she said,
      "where Auntie was born. Are we to sell that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie guessed exactly what was in her mind. It had been
      in his too, ever since Lucia had alluded to the beautiful
      music-room. Her voice had lingered over the beautiful
      music-room: she had seemed to underline it, to caress it,
      to appropriate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you are thinking of keeping the house and partly
      living there," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia looked round, as if a hundred eavesdroppers had
      entered unaware.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, Georgie," she said, "not a word must be said about
      that. But it has occurred to both Pepino and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought you hated London," he said. "You're always
      so glad to get back, you find it so common and garish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, compared to the exquisite peace and seriousness of
      our Riseholme," she said, "where there never is a jarring
      note, at least hardly ever. But there is in London a
      certain stir and movement which we lack here. In the swim,
      Georgie, in the middle of things! Perhaps we get too
      sensitive here where everything is full of harmony and
      culture, perhaps we are too much sheltered. If I followed
      my inclination I would never leave our dear Riseholme for a
      single day. Oh, how easy everything would be if one only
      followed one's inclination! A morning with my books, an
      afternoon in my garden, my piano after tea, and a friend
      like you to come in to dine with my Pepino and me and scold
      me well, as you'll soon be doing for being so bungling over
      Mozartino."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia twirled round the Elizabethan spit that hung in the
      wide chimney, and again fixed him rather in the style of
      the Ancient Mariner. Georgie could not choose but hear . .
      . Lucia's eloquent well-ordered sentences had nothing
      impromptu about them; what she said was evidently all
      thought out and probably talked out. If she and Pepino had
      been talking of nothing else since the terrible blow had
      shattered them, she could not have been more lucid and
      crystal-clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I feel like a leisurely old horse who has been
      turned out to grass being suddenly bridled and harnessed
      again. But there is work and energy in me yet, though I
      thought that I should be permitted to grow old in the
      delicious peace and leisure of our dear quiet humdrum
      Riseholme. But I feel that perhaps that is not to be. My
      conscience is cracking the whip at me, and saying 'You've
      got to trot again, you lazy old thing.' And I've got to
      think of Pepino. Dear, contented Pepino would never
      complain if I refused to budge. He would read his paper,
      and potter in the garden, and write his dear little
      poems--such a sweet one, 'Bereavement,' he began it
      yesterday, a sonnet--and look at the stars. But is it a
      life for a man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie made an uneasy movement in his chair, and Lucia
      hastened to correct the implied criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're different, my dear," she said. "You've got that
      wonderful power of being interested in everything.
      Everything. But think what London would give Pepino! His
      club: the Astronomer-Royal is a member, his other club,
      political, and politics have lately been quite an obsession
      with him. The reading-room at the British Museum. No, I
      should be very selfish if I did not see all that. I must
      and I do think of Pepino. I mustn't be selfish, Georgie."
    </p>
    <p>
      This idea of Lucia's leaving Riseholme was a live bomb. At
      the moment of its explosion, Georgie seemed to see
      Riseholme fly into a thousand disintegrated fragments. And
      then, faintly, through the smoke he seemed to see Riseholme
      still intact. Somebody, of course, would have to fill the
      vacant throne and direct its affairs. And the thought of
      Beau Nash at Bath flitted across the distant horizon of his
      mind. It was a naughty thought, but its vagueness absolved
      it from treason. He shook it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how on earth are we to get on without you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet of you to say that, Georgie," said she, giving
      another twirl to the spit. (There had been a leg of mutton
      roasted on it last May-day, while they all sat round in
      jerkins and stomachers and hose, and all the perfumes of
      Arabia had hardly sufficed to quell the odour of roast meat
      which had pervaded the room for weeks afterwards.) "Sweet
      of you to say that, but you mustn't think that I am
      deserting Riseholme. We should be in London perhaps
      (though, as I say, nothing is settled) for two or three
      months in the summer, and always come here for weekends,
      and perhaps from November till Christmas, and a little
      while in the spring. And then Riseholme would always be
      coming up to us. Five spare bedrooms, I believe, and one of
      them quite a little suite with a bathroom and sitting-room
      attached. No, dear Georgie, I would never desert my dear
      Riseholme. If it was a choice between London and Riseholme,
      I should not hesitate in my choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then would you keep both houses open?" asked Georgie,
      thrilled to the marrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pepino thought we could manage it," she said, utterly
      erasing the impression of the shattered nephew. "He was
      calculating it out last night, and with board wages at the
      other house, if you understand, and vegetables from the
      country, he thought that with care we could live well
      within our means. He got quite excited about it, and I
      heard him walking about long after I had gone to bed.
      Pepino has such a head for detail. He intends to keep a
      complete set of things, clothes and sponge and everything
      in London, so that he will have no luggage. Such a saving
      of tips and small expenses, in which as he so truly says,
      money leaks away. Then there will be no garage expenses in
      London: we shall leave the motor here, and rough it with
      tubes and taxis in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was fully as excited as Pepino, and could not be
      discreet any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," he said, "how much do you think it will all come
      to? The money he'll come into, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia also threw discretion to the winds, and forgot all
      about the fact that they were to be so terribly poor for a
      long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About three thousand a year, Pepino imagines, when
      everything is paid. Our income will be doubled, in fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie gave a sigh of pure satisfaction. So much was
      revealed, not only of the future, but of the past, for no
      one hitherto had known what their income was. And how
      clever of Robert Quantock to have made so accurate a guess!
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too wonderful for you," he said. "And I know you'll
      spend it beautifully. I had been thinking over it this
      afternoon, but I never thought it would be as much as that.
      And then there are the pearls. I do congratulate you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia suddenly felt that she had shown too much of the
      silver (or was it gold?) lining to the cloud of affliction
      that had overshadowed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Auntie!" she said. "We don't forget her through it
      all. We hoped she might have been spared us a little
      longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      That came out of her note to Daisy Quantock (and perhaps to
      others as well), but Lucia could not have known that
      Georgie had already been told about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I've come here to take your mind off these sad
      things," he said. "You mustn't dwell on them any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been ever so good to me," she said. "I should just
      have moped if I had been alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      She lapsed into the baby-language which they sometimes
      spoke, varying it with easy Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ickle music, Georgie?" she said. "And you must be
      kindy-kindy to me. No practice all these days. You brought
      Mozart? Which part is easiest? Lucia wants to take easiest
      part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia shall take which ever part she likes," said Georgie
      who had had a good practise at both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Treble then," said Lucia. "But oh, how diffy it looks!
      Hundreds of ickle notes. And me so stupid at reading! Come
      on then. You begin, Uno, due, tre."
    </p>
    <p>
      The light by the piano was not very good, but Georgie did
      not want to put on his spectacles unless he was obliged,
      for he did not think Lucia knew that he wore them, and
      somehow spectacles did not seem to 'go' with Oxford
      trousers. But it was no good, and after having made a
      miserable hash of the first page, he surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me must put on speckies," he said. "Me a blind old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he had an immense surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And me a blind old woman," said Lucia. "I've just got
      speckies too. Oh, Georgie, aren't we getting vecchio? Now
      we'll start again. Uno, due--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mozart went beautifully after that, and each of them
      inwardly wondered at the accuracy of the other's reading.
      Lucia suspected that Georgie had been having a try at it,
      but then, after all, she had had the choice of which part
      she would take, and if Georgie had practised already, he
      would have been almost certain to have practised the
      treble; it never entered her head that he had been so
      thorough as to practise both. Then they played it through
      again, changing parts, and again it went excellently. It
      was late now, and soon Georgie rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what shall I say if anybody who knows I've been dining
      with you, asks if you've told me anything?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia closed the piano and concentrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say nothing of our plans about the house in Brompton
      Square," she said, "but there's no reason why people
      shouldn't know that there is a house there. I hate
      secretiveness, and after all, when the will comes out,
      everyone will know. So say there is a house there, full of
      beautiful things. And similarly they will know about the
      money. So say what Pepino thinks it will come to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came with him to the door, and strolled out into the
      little garden in front where the daffodils were in flower.
      The night was clear, but moonless, and the company of stars
      burned brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aldebaran!" said Lucia, pointing inclusively to the
      spangled arch of the sky. "That bright one. Oh, Georgie,
      how restful it is to look at Aldebaran if one is worried
      and sad. It lifts one's mind above petty cares and personal
      sorrows. The patens of bright gold! Wonderful Shakespeare!
      Look in to-morrow afternoon, won't you, and tell me if
      there is any news. Naturally, I shan't go out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, come and have lunch," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear Georgie: the funeral is at two. Putney Vale.
      <i>Buona notte."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Buona notte,</i> dear Lucia," he said.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie hurried back to his house, and was disappointed to
      see that there were no lights in Daisy's drawing-room nor
      in Robert Quantock's study. But when he got up to his
      bedroom, where Foljambe had forgotten to pull down the
      blinds, he saw a light in Daisy's bedroom. Even as he
      looked the curtains there were drawn back, and he saw her
      amply clad in a dressing-gown, opening windows at top and
      bottom, for just now the first principle of health
      consisted in sleeping in a gale. She too must have seen his
      room was lit, and his face at the window, for she made
      violent signs to him, and he threw open the casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Brompton Square," said George. "And three thousand a
      year!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c02" id="c02">CHAPTER II</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This simple word 'No' connoted a great deal in the
      Riseholme vernacular. It was used, of course, as a mere
      negative, without emphasis, and if you wanted to give
      weight to your negative you added 'Certainly not.' But when
      you used the word 'No' with emphasis, as Daisy had used it
      from her bedroom window to Georgie, it was not a negative
      at all, and its signification briefly put was "I never
      heard anything so marvellous, and it thrills me through and
      through. Please go on at once, and tell me a great deal
      more, and then let us talk it all over."
    </p>
    <p>
      On that occasion Georgie did not go on at once, for having
      made his climax he, with supreme art, shut the window and
      drew down the blind, leaving Daisy to lie awake half the
      night and ponder over this remarkable news, and wonder what
      Pepino and Lucia would do with all that money. She arrived
      at several conclusions: she guessed that they would buy the
      meadow beyond the garden, and have a new telescope, but the
      building of a library did not occur to her. Before she went
      to sleep an even more important problem presented itself,
      and she scribbled a note to Georgie to be taken across in
      the morning early, in which she wrote, "And did she say
      anything about the house? What's going to happen to it? And
      you didn't tell me the number," exactly as she would have
      continued the conversation if he had not shut his window so
      quickly and drawn down the blind, ringing down the curtain
      on his magnificent climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe brought up this note with Georgie's early morning
      tea and the glass of very hot water which sometimes he
      drank instead of it if he suspected an error of diet the
      night before, and the little glass gallipot of Kruschen
      salts, which occasionally he added to the hot water or the
      tea. Georgie was very sleepy, and, only half awake, turned
      round in bed, so that Foljambe should not see the place
      where he wore the toupée, and smothered a snore, for he
      would not like her to think that he snored. But when she
      said "Telegram for you, sir," Georgie sat up at once in his
      pink silk pyjamas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" he said with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore the envelope open, and a whole sheaf of sheets fell
      out. The moment he set eyes on the first words, he knew so
      well from whom it came that he did not even trouble to look
      at the last sheet where it would be signed.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Beloved Georgie (it ran),<br>
      <br>
      I rang you up till I lost my temper and so send this. Most
      expensive, but terribly important. I arrived in London
      yesterday and shall come down for week-end to Riseholme.
      Shall dine with you Saturday all alone to hear about
      everything. Come to lunch and dinner Sunday, and ask
      everybody to one or other, particularly Lucia. Am bringing
      cook, but order sufficient food for Sunday. Wonderful
      American and Australian tour, and I'm taking house in
      London for season. Shall motor down. Bless you.<br>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie sprang out of bed, merely glancing through Daisy's
      pencilled note and throwing it away. There was nothing to
      be said to it in any case, since he had been told not to
      divulge the project with regard to the house in Brompton
      Square, and he didn't know the number. But in Olga's
      telegram there was enough to make anybody busy for the day,
      for he had to ask all her friends to lunch or dinner on
      Sunday, order the necessary food, and arrange a little meal
      for Olga and himself to-morrow night. He scarcely knew what
      he was drinking, tea or hot water or Kruschen salts, so
      excited was he. He foresaw too, that there would be call
      for the most skilled diplomacy with regard to Lucia. She
      must certainly be asked first, and some urging might be
      required to make her consent to come at all, either to
      lunch or dinner, even if due regard was paid to her deep
      mourning, and the festivity limited to one or two guests of
      her own selection. Yet somehow Georgie felt that she would
      stretch a point and be persuaded, for everybody else would
      be going some time on Sunday to Olga's, and it would be
      tiresome for her to explain again and again in the days
      that followed that she had been asked and had not felt up
      to it. And if she didn't explain carefully every time,
      Riseholme would be sure to think she hadn't been asked. 'A
      little diplomacy' thought George, as he trotted across to
      her house after breakfast with no hat, but a fur tippet
      round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shown into the music-room, while her maid went to
      fetch her. The piano was open, so she had evidently been
      practising, and there was a copy of the Mozart duet which
      she had read so skilfully last night on the music-rest. For
      the moment Georgie thought he must have forgotten to take
      his copy away with him, but then looking at it more
      carefully he saw that there were pencilled marks for the
      fingering scribbled over the more difficult passages in the
      treble, which certainly he had never put there. At the
      moment he saw Lucia through the window coming up the
      garden, and he hastily took a chair far away from the piano
      and buried himself in <i>The Times.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat close together in front of the fire, and Georgie
      opened his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard from Olga this morning," he said, "a great long
      telegram. She is coming down for the week-end."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a wintry smile. She did not care for Olga's
      coming down. Riseholme was quite silly about Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be nice for you, Georgie," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sent you a special message," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am grateful for her sympathy," said Lucia. "She might
      perhaps have written direct to me, but I'm sure she was
      full of kind intentions. As she sent the message by you
      verbally, will you verbally thank her? I appreciate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as she delivered these icy sentiments, Lucia got up
      rather hastily and passed behind him. Something white on
      the music-rest of the piano had caught her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't move, Georgie," she said, "sit and warm yourself and
      light your cigarette. Anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked up the room to the far end where the piano
      stood, and Georgie, though he was a little deaf, quite
      distinctly heard the rustle of paper. The most elementary
      rudiments of politeness forbade him to look round. Besides
      he knew exactly what was happening. Then there came a
      second rustle of paper, which he could not interpret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything else, Georgie?" repeated Lucia, coming back to
      her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. But Olga's message wasn't quite that," he said. "She
      evidently hadn't heard of your bereavement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Odd," said Lucia. "I should have thought perhaps that the
      death of Miss Amy Lucas--however, what was her message
      then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She wanted you very much--she said 'particularly
      Lucia'--to go to lunch or dine with her on Sunday. Pepino,
      too, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So kind of her, but naturally quite impossible," said
      Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but you mustn't say that," said Georgie. "She is down
      for just that day, and she wants to see all her old
      friends. Particularly Lucia, you know. In fact she asked me
      to get up two little parties for her at lunch and dinner.
      So, of course, I came to see you first, to know which you
      would prefer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A party!" she said. "How do you think I could?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it wouldn't be <i>that</i> sort of party," said
      Georgie. "Just a few of your friends. You and Pepino will
      have seen nobody to-night and all to-morrow. He will have
      told you everything by Sunday. And so bad to sit brooding."
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Lucia had said it was quite impossible she had
      been longing for Georgie to urge her, and had indeed been
      prepared to encourages him to urge her if he didn't do so
      of his own accord. His last words had given her an
      admirable opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder!" she said. "Perhaps Pepino might feel inclined
      to go, if there really was no party. It doesn't do to
      brood: you are right, I mustn't let him brood. Selfish of
      me not to think of that. Who would there be, Georgie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's really for you to settle," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Georgie, thinking it unnecessary to add that
      Olga was dining with him on Saturday, and that he would be
      at lunch and dinner on Sunday. "Yes: she asked me to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, what if you asked poor Daisy and her husband?"
      said Lucia. "It would be a treat for them. That would make
      six. I think six would be enough. I will do my best to
      persuade Pepino."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital," said Georgie. "And would you prefer lunch or
      dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think dinner," she said. "One feels more capable of
      making the necessary effort in the evening. But, of course,
      it is all conditional on Pepino's feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will just be leaving Brompton Square," she said. "And
      then, afterwards, his lawyer is coming to lunch with him
      and have a talk. Such a lot of business to see to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie suddenly remembered that he did not yet know the
      number of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed there must be," he said. "Such a delightful Square,
      but rather noisy, I should think, at the lower end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but deliciously quiet at the top end," said Lucia. "A
      curve you know, and a <i>cul de sac.</i> Number twenty-five
      is just before the beginning of the curve. And no houses at
      the back. Just the peaceful old churchyard--though sad for
      Pepino to look out on this morning--and a footpath only up
      to Ennismore Gardens. My music-room looks out at the back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Georgie, you will be very busy this morning," she
      said, "getting all the guests for Sunday, and I mustn't
      keep you. But I should like to play you a morsel of
      Stravinski which I have been trying over. Terribly modern,
      of course, and it may sound hideous to you at first, and at
      best it's a mere little tinkle if you compare it with the
      immortals. But there is something about it, and one mustn't
      condemn all modern work unheard. There was a time no doubt
      when even Beethoven's greatest sonatas were thought to be
      modern and revolutionary."
    </p>
    <p>
      She led the way to the piano, where on the music-rest was
      the morsel of Stravinski, which explained the second and
      hitherto unintelligible rustle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit by me, Georgie," she said, "and turn over quick, when
      I nod. Something like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia got through the first page beautifully, but then
      everything seemed to go wrong. Georgie had expected it all
      to be odd and aimless, but surely Stravinski hadn't meant
      quite what Lucia was playing. Then he suddenly saw that the
      key had been changed, but in a very inconspicuous manner,
      right in the middle of a bar, and Lucia had not observed
      this. She went on playing with amazing agility, nodded at
      the end of the second page, and then luckily the piece
      changed back again into its original clef. Would it be wise
      to tell her? He thought not: next time she tried it, or the
      time after, she would very likely notice the change of key.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brilliant roulade consisting of chromatic scales in
      contrary directions, brought this firework to an end, and
      Lucia gave a little shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must work at it," she said, "before I can judge of it. .
      . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers strayed about the piano, and she paused. Then
      with the wistful expression Georgie knew so well, she
      played the first movement of the Moonlight Sonata. Georgie
      set his face also into the Beethoven-expression, and at the
      end gave the usual little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Divine," he said. "You never played it better. Thank you,
      Lucia."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must thank immortal Beethoven," she said.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's head buzzed with inductive reasoning, as he
      hurried about on his vicariously hospitable errands. Lucia
      had certainly determined to make a second home in London,
      for she had distinctly said 'my music room' when she
      referred to the house in Brompton Square. Also it was easy
      to see the significance of her deigning to touch Stravinski
      with even the tip of one finger. She was visualising
      herself in the modern world, she was going to be
      up-to-date: the music-room in Brompton Square was not only
      to echo with the first movement of the Moonlight. . . .
      "It's too thrilling," said Georgie, as, warmed with this
      mental activity, he quite forgot to put on his fur tippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first visit, of course, was to Daisy Quantock, but he
      meant to stay no longer than just to secure her and her
      husband for dinner on Sunday with Olga, and tell her the
      number of the house in Brompton Square. He found that she
      had dug a large trench round her mulberry tree, and was
      busily pruning the roots with the wood-axe by the light of
      Nature: in fact she had cut off all their ends, and there
      was a great pile of chunks of mulberry root to be
      transferred in the wheel-barrow, now empty of manure, to
      the wood-shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-five, that's easy to remember," she said. "And are
      they going to sell it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing settled," said Georgie. "My dear, you're being
      rather drastic, aren't you? Won't it die?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit," said Daisy. "It'll bear twice as many
      mulberries as before. Last year there was one. You should
      always prune the roots of a fruit tree that doesn't bear.
      And the pearls?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No news," said Georgie, "except that they come in a
      portrait of the aunt by Sargent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! By Sargent?" asked Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. And Queen Anne furniture and Chinese Chippendale
      chairs," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how many bedrooms?" asked Daisy, wiping her axe on the
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five spare, so I suppose that means seven," said Georgie,
      "and one with a sitting-room and bathroom attached. And a
      beautiful music-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, she means to live there," said Daisy, "whether
      she told you or not. You don't count the bedrooms like that
      in a house you're going to sell. It isn't done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing settled, I tell you," said Georgie. "So you'll
      dine with Olga on Sunday, and now I must fly and get people
      to lunch with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! A lunch-party too?" asked Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. She wants to see everybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And five spare rooms, did you say?" asked Daisy, beginning
      to fill in her trench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie hurried out of the front gate, and Daisy shovelled
      the earth back and hurried indoors to impart all this news
      to her husband. He had a little rheumatism in his shoulder,
      and she gave him Coué treatment before she counterordered
      the chicken which she had bespoken for his dinner on
      Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie thought it wise to go first to Olga's house, to
      make sure that she had told her caretaker that she was
      coming down for the week-end. That was the kind of thing
      that prima-donnas sometimes forgot. There was a man sitting
      on the roof of Old Place with a coil of wire, and another
      sitting on the chimney. Though listening-in had not yet
      arrived at Riseholme, Georgie at once conjectured that Olga
      was installing it, and what would Lucia say? It was utterly
      un-Elizabethan to begin with, and though she countenanced
      the telephone, she had expressed herself very strongly on
      the subject of listening-in. She had had an unfortunate
      experience of it herself, for on a visit to London not long
      ago, her hostess had switched it on, and the company was
      regaled with a vivid lecture on pyorrhea by a hospital
      nurse. . . . Georgie, however, would see Olga before Lucia
      came to dinner on Sunday and would explain her abhorrence
      of the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the delightful task of asking everybody to
      lunch. It was the hour now when Riseholme generally was
      popping in and out of shops, and finding out the news. It
      was already known that Georgie had dined with Lucia last
      night and that Pepino had gone to his aunt's funeral, and
      everyone was agog to ascertain if anything definite had yet
      been ascertained about the immense fortune which had
      certainly come to the Lucases. . . . Mrs. Antrobus spied
      Georgie going into Olga's house (for the keenness of her
      eyesight made up for her deafness), and there she was with
      her ear-trumpet adjusted, looking at the view just outside
      Old Place when Georgie came out. Already the popular
      estimate had grown like a gourd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A quarter of a million, I'm told, Mr. Georgie," said she,
      "and a house in Grosvenor Square, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Georgie could reply, Mrs. Antrobus's two daughters,
      Piggy and Goosey came bounding up hand in hand. Piggy and
      Goosey never walked like other people: they skipped and
      gambolled to show how girlish an age is thirty-four and
      thirty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh stop, Mr. Georgie," said Piggy. "Let us all hear. And
      are the pearls worth a Queen's ransom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silly thing," said Goosie. "I don't believe in the
      pearls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't believe in Grosvenor Square," said Goosie.
      "So silly yourself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      When this ebullition of high spirits had subsided, and
      Piggy had slapped Goosie on the back of her hands, they
      both said "Hush!" simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can't say about the pearls," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, what can't you say?" said Mrs. Antrobus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the pearls," said Georgie, addressing himself to the
      end of Mrs. Antrobus's trumpet. It was like the trunk of a
      very short elephant, and she waved it about as if asking
      for a bun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the pearls, mamma," screamed Goosie and Piggy
      together. "Don't interrupt Mr. Georgie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the house isn't in Grosvenor Square, but in Brompton
      Square," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's quite in the slums," said Mrs. Antrobus. "I am
      disappointed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, a charming neighbourhood," said Georgie. This
      was not at all what he had been looking forward to: he had
      expected cries of envious surprise at his news. "As for the
      fortune, about three thousand a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all?" said Piggy with an air of deep disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mere pittance to millionaires like Piggy," said Goosie,
      and they slapped each other again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any more news?" asked Mrs. Antrobus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Georgie, "Olga Bracely is coming down
      to-morrow--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said all the ladies together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And her husband?" asked Piggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Georgie without emphasis. "At least she didn't
      say so. But she wants all her friends to come to lunch on
      Sunday. So you'll all come, will you? She told me to ask
      everybody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Piggy. "Oh, how lovely! I adore Olga. Will she
      let me sit next her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?" said Mrs. Antrobus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lunch on Sunday, mamma, with Olga Bracely," screamed
      Goosie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she's not here," said Mrs. Antrobus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but she's coming, mamma," shouted Piggy. "Come along,
      Goosie. There's Mrs. Boucher. We'll tell her about poor
      Mrs. Lucas."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boucher's bath-chair was stationed opposite the
      butcher's, where her husband was ordering the joint for
      Sunday. Piggy and Goosie had poured the tale of Lucia's
      comparative poverty into her ear, before Georgie got to
      her. Here, however, it had a different reception, and
      Georgie found himself the hero of the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An immense fortune. I call it an immense fortune," said
      Mrs. Boucher, emphatically, as Georgie approached. "Good
      morning, Mr. Georgie, I've heard your news, and I hope Mrs.
      Lucas will use it well. Brompton Square, too! I had an aunt
      who lived there once, my mother's sister, you understand,
      not my father's, and she used to say that she would sooner
      live in Brompton Square than in Buckingham Palace. What
      will they do with it, do you suppose? It must be worth its
      weight in gold. What a strange coincidence that Mr. Lucas's
      aunt and mine should both have lived there! Any more news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Georgie. "Olga is coming down to-morrow--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's a bit of news!" said Mrs. Boucher, as her
      husband came out of the butcher's shop. "Jacob, Olga's
      coming down to-morrow, so Mr. Georgie says. That'll make
      you happy! You're madly in love with Olga, Jacob, so don't
      deny it. You're an old flirt, Jacob, that's what you are. I
      shan't get much of your attention till Olga goes away
      again. I should be ashamed at your age, I should. And young
      enough to be your daughter or mine either. And three
      thousand a year, Mr. Georgie says. I call it an immense
      fortune. That's Mrs. Lucas, you know. I thought perhaps
      two. I'm astounded. Why, when old Mrs. Toppington--not the
      wife of the young Mr. Toppington who married the niece of
      the man who invented laughing gas--but of his father, or
      perhaps his uncle, I can't be quite sure which, but when
      old Mr. Toppington died, he left his son or nephew,
      whichever it was, a sum that brought him in just about
      that, and he was considered a very rich man. He had the
      house just beyond the church at Scroby Windham where my
      father was rector, and he built the new wing with the
      billiard-room--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie knew he would never get through his morning's work
      if he listened to everything that Mrs. Boucher had to say
      about young Mr. Toppington, and broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she wants you and the colonel to lunch with her on
      Sunday," he said. "She told me to ask all her old friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I do call that kind," said Mrs. Boucher, "and of
      course we'll go. . . . Jacob, the joint. We shan't want the
      joint. I was going to give you a veal cutlet in the
      evening, so what's the good of a joint? Just a bit of steak
      for the servants, a nice piece. Well, that will be a treat,
      to lunch with our dear Olga! Quite a party, I daresay."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Quantock's chicken, already countermanded, came in
      nicely for Georgie's dinner for Olga on Saturday, and by
      the time all his errands were done the morning was gone,
      without any practise at his piano, or work in his garden,
      or a single stitch in his new piece of embroidery. Fresh
      amazements awaited him when he made his fatigued return to
      his house. For Foljambe told him that Lucia, had sent her
      maid to borrow his manual on Auction Bridge. He was too
      tired to puzzle over that now, but it was strange that
      Lucia, who despised any form of cards as only fit for those
      who had not the intelligence to talk or to listen, should
      have done that. Cards came next to cross-word puzzles in
      Lucia's index of inanities. What did it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Lucia nor Pepino were seen in public at all till
      Sunday morning, though Daisy Quantock had caught sight of
      Pepino on his arrival on Friday afternoon, walking bowed
      with grief and with a faltering gait through the little
      paved garden in front of The Hurst, to his door. Lucia
      opened it for him, and they both shook their heads sadly
      and passed inside. But it was believed that they never came
      out the whole of Saturday, and their first appearance was
      at church on Sunday, though indeed, Lucia could hardly be
      said to have appeared, so impenetrable was her black veil.
      But that, so to speak, was the end of all mourning
      (besides, everybody knew that she was dining with Olga that
      night), and at the end of the service, she put up her veil,
      and held a sort of little reception standing in the porch,
      and shaking hands with all her friends as they went out. It
      was generally felt that this signified her re-entry into
      Riseholme life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly less conspicuous a figure was Georgie. Though Robert
      had been so sarcastic about his Oxford trousers, he had
      made up his mind to get it over, and after church he walked
      twice round the green quite slowly and talked to everybody,
      standing a little away so that they should get a complete
      view. The odious Piggy, it is true, burst into a squeal of
      laughter and cried, "Oh, Mr. Georgie, I see you've gone
      into long frocks," and her mother put up her ear-trumpet as
      she approached as if to give a greater keenness to her
      general perceptions. But apart from the jarring incident of
      Piggy, Georgie was pleased with his trousers' reception.
      They were beautifully cut too, and fell in charming lines,
      and the sensation they created was quite a respectful one.
      But it had been an anxious morning, and he was pleased when
      it was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      And such a talk he had had with Olga last night, when she
      dined alone with him, and sat so long with her elbows on
      the table that Foljambe looked in three times in order to
      clear away. Her own adventures, she said, didn't matter;
      she could tell Georgie about the American tour and the
      Australian tour, and the coming season in London any time
      at leisure. What she had to know about with the utmost
      detail was exactly everything that had happened at
      Riseholme since she had left it a year ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" she said. "To think that I once thought
      that it was a quiet back-watery place where I could rest
      and do nothing but study. But it's a whirl! There's always
      something wildly exciting going on. Oh, what fools people
      are not to take an interest in what they call little
      things. Now go on about Lucia. It's his aunt, isn't it, and
      mad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and Pepino's been left her house in Brompton Square,"
      began Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! That's where I've taken a house for the season. What
      number?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-five," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-five?" said Olga. "Why, that's just where the curve
      begins. And a big--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Music-room built out at the back," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm almost exactly opposite. But mine's a small one. Just
      room for my husband and me, and one spare room. Go on
      quickly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And about three thousand a year and some pearls," said
      Georgie. "And the house is full of beautiful furniture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will they sell it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing settled," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means you think they won't. Do you think that they'll
      settle altogether in London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't think that," said Georgie very carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are tactful. Lucia has told you all about it, but has
      also said firmly that nothing's settled. So I won't pump
      you. And I met Colonel Boucher on my way here. Why only one
      bull-dog?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because the other always growled so frightfully at Mrs.
      Boucher. He gave it away to his brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Daisy Quantock? Is it still spiritualism?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that's over, though I rather think it's coming back.
      After that it was sour milk, and now it's raw vegetables.
      You'll see to-morrow at dinner. She brings them in a paper
      bag. Carrots and turnips and celery. Raw. But perhaps she
      may not. Every now and then she eats like anybody else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Piggie and Goosie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just the same. But Mrs. Antrobus has got a new
      ear-trumpet. But what I want to know is, why did Lucia send
      across for my manual on Auction Bridge? She thinks all
      card-games imbecile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Georgie, that's easy!" said Olga. "Why, of course,
      Brompton Square, though nothing's settled. Parties, you
      know, when she wants people who like to play Bridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie became deeply thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be that," he said. "But it would be tremendously
      thorough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How else can you account for it? By the way, I've had a
      listening-in put up at Old Place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. I saw them at it yesterday. But don't turn it on
      to-morrow night. Lucia hates it. She only heard it once,
      and that time it was a lecture on pyorrhea. Now tell me
      about yourself. And shall we go into the drawing-room?
      Foljambe's getting restless."
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga allowed herself to be weaned from subjects so much
      more entrancing to her, and told him of the huge success of
      the American tour, and spoke of the eight weeks' season
      which was to begin at Covent Garden in the middle of May.
      But it all led back to Riseholme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm singing twice a week," she said. "Brunnhilde and
      Lucrezia and Salome. Oh, my dear, how I love it! But I
      shall come down here every single week-end. To go back to
      Lucia: do you suppose she'll settle in London for the
      season? I believe that's the idea. Fresh worlds to
      conquer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you may be right about the Auction Bridge," he
      said at length. "And that would account for Stravinski
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" said Olga greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, she played me a bit of Stravinski yesterday morning,"
      said Georgie. "And before she never would listen to
      anything modern. It all fits in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfect," said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie and the Quantocks walked up together the next
      evening to dine with Olga, and Daisy was carrying a little
      paper parcel. But that proved to be a disappointment, for
      it did not contain carrots, but only evening shoes. Lucia
      and Pepino, as usual, were a little late, for it was
      Lucia's habit to arrive last at any party, as befitted the
      Queen of Riseholme, and to make her gracious round of the
      guests. Everyone of course was wondering if she would wear
      the pearls, but again there was a disappointment, for her
      only ornaments were two black bangles, and the brooch of
      entwined sausages of gold containing a lock of Beethoven's
      hair. (As a matter of fact Beethoven's hair had fallen out
      some years ago, and she had replaced it with a lock of
      Pepino's which was the same colour. . . . Pepino had never
      told anybody.) From the first it was evident that though
      the habiliments of woe still decked her, she had cast off
      the numb misery of the bereavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So kind of you to invite us," she said to Olga, "and so
      good," she added in a whisper, "for my poor Pepino. I've
      been telling him he must face the world again and not mope.
      Daisy, dear! Sweet to see you, and Mr. Robert. Georgie!
      Well, I do think this is a delicious little party."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino followed her: it was just like the arrival of Royal
      Personages, and Olga had to stiffen her knees so as not to
      curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having greeted those who had the honour to meet her, Lucia
      became affable rather than gracious. Robert Quantock was
      between her and Olga at dinner, but then at dinner,
      everybody left Robert alone, for if disturbed over that
      function, he was apt to behave rather like a dog with a
      bone and growl. But if left alone, he was in an extremely
      good temper afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you're only here just for two days, Miss Olga," she
      said, "at least so Georgie tells me, and he usually knows
      your movements. And then London, I suppose, and you'll be
      busy rehearsing for the opera. I must certainly manage to
      be in London for a week or two this year, and come to
      'Siegried,' and The 'Valkyrie,' in which, so I see in the
      papers, you're singing. Georgie, you must take me up to
      London when the opera comes on. Or perhaps--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pepino, shall I tell all our dear friends our little
      secret?" she said. "If you say 'no,' I shan't. But, please,
      Pepino--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino, however, had been instructed to say 'yes,' and
      accordingly did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, dear Miss Olga," said Lucia, "that a little
      property has come to us through that grievous tragedy last
      week. A house has been left to Pepino in Brompton Square,
      all furnished, and with a beautiful music-room. So we're
      thinking, as there is no immediate hurry about selling it,
      of spending a few weeks there this season, very quietly of
      course, but still perhaps entertaining a few friends. Then
      we shall have time to look about us, and as the house is
      there, why not use it in the interval? We shall go there at
      the end of the month."
    </p>
    <p>
      This little speech had been carefully prepared, for Lucia
      felt that if she announced the full extent of their plan,
      Riseholme would suffer a terrible blow. It must be broken
      to Riseholme by degrees: Riseholme must first be told that
      they were to be up in town for a week or two, pending the
      sale of the house. Subsequently Riseholme would hear that
      they were not going to sell the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round to see how this section of Riseholme took
      it. A chorus of the emphatic 'No' burst from Georgie, Mrs.
      Quantock and Olga, who, of course, had fully discussed this
      disclosure already; even Robert, very busy with his dinner,
      said 'No' and went on gobbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So sweet of you all to say 'No,'" said Lucia, who know
      perfectly well that the emphatic interjection meant only
      surprise, and the desire to hear more, not the denial that
      such a thing was possible, "but there it is. Pepino and I
      have talked it over--<i>non e vero, carissimo</i>--and we
      feel that there is a sort of call to us to go to London.
      Dearest Aunt Amy, you know, and all her beautiful
      furniture! She never would have a stick of it sold, and
      that seems to point to the fact that she expected Pepino
      and me not to wholly desert the dear old family home. Aunt
      Amy was born there, eighty-three years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear! How it takes one back!" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't it?" said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had now, so to speak, developed her full horsepower.
      Pepino's presence stoked her, Robert was stoking himself
      and might be disregarded, while Olga and Georgie were
      hanging on her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it isn't the past only that we are thinking of," she
      said, "but the present and the future. Of course our
      spiritual home is here--like Lord Haldane and Germany--and
      oh, how much we have learned at Riseholme, its lovely
      seriousness and its gaiety, its culture, its absorption in
      all that is worthy in art and literature, its old customs,
      its simplicity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Olga. (She had meant long ago to tell Lucia
      that she had taken a house in Brompton Square exactly
      opposite Lucia's, but who could interrupt the splendour
      that was pouring out on them?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia fumbled for a moment at the brooch containing
      Beethoven's hair. She had a feeling that the pin had come
      undone. "Dear Miss Olga," she said, "how good of you to
      take an interest, you with your great mission of melody in
      the world, in our little affairs! I am encouraged. Well,
      Pepino and I feel--don't we? <i>sposo mio</i>--that now
      that this opportunity has come to us, of perhaps having a
      little salon in London, we ought to take it. There are
      modern movements in the world we really know nothing about.
      We want to educate ourselves. We want to know what the
      cosmopolitan mind is thinking about. Of course we're old,
      but it is never too late to learn. How we shall treasure
      all we are lucky enough to glean, and bring it back to our
      dear Riseholme."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight and muffled thud on the ground, and
      Lucia's fingers went back where the brooch should have
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgino, my brooch, the Beethoven brooch," she said; "it
      has fallen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie stooped rather stiffly to pick it up: that work
      with the garden roller had found out his lumbar muscles.
      Olga rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too thrilling, Mrs. Lucas!" she said. "You must tell me
      much more. Shall we go? And how lovely for me: I have just
      taken a house in Brompton Square for the season."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Lucie. "Which?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, one of the little ones," said Olga. "Just opposite
      yours. Forty-two A."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such dear little houses!" said Lucia. "I have a
      music-room. Always yours to practise in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital good dinner," said Robert, who had not spoken for
      a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia put an arm round Daisy Quantock's ample waist, and
      thus tactfully avoided the question of precedence. Daisy,
      of course, was far, far the elder, but then Lucia was
      Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delicious indeed," she said. "Georgie, bring the Beethoven
      with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And don't be long," said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had no use for the society of his own sex unless
      they were young, which made him feel young too, or much
      older than himself, which had the same result. But Pepino
      had an unpleasant habit of saying to him 'When we come to
      our age' (which was an unreasonable assumption of
      juvenility), and Robert of sipping port with the sound of
      many waters for an indefinite period. So when Georgie had
      let Robert have two good glasses, he broke up this
      symposium and trundled them away into the drawing-room,
      only pausing to snatch up his embroidery tambour, on which
      he was working at what had been originally intended for a
      bedspread, but was getting so lovely that he now thought of
      putting it when finished on the top of his piano. He
      noticed that Lucia had brought a portfolio of music, and
      peeping inside saw the morsel of Stravinski. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as he came within range of the conversation of
      the ladies, he nearly fell down from sheer shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but I adore it," Lucia was saying. "One of the most
      marvellous inventions of modern times. Were we not saying
      so last night, Pepino? And Miss Olga is telling me that
      everyone in London has a listening-in apparatus. Pray turn
      it on, Miss Olga; it will be a treat to hear it! Ah, the
      Beethoven brooch: thank you, Georgie--<i>mille grazie."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga turned a handle or a screw or something, and there was
      a short pause: the next item presumably had already been
      announced. And then, wonder of wonders, there came from the
      trumpet the first bars of the Moonlight Sonata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Moonlight Sonata (especially the first movement of
      it) had an almost sacred significance in Riseholme. It was
      Lucia's tune, much as God Save the King is the King's tune.
      Whatever musical entertainment had been going on, it was
      certain that if Lucia was present she would sooner or later
      be easily induced to play the first movement of the
      Moonlight Sonata. Astonished as everybody already was at
      her not only countenancing but even allowing this
      mechanism, so lately abhorred by her, to be set to work at
      all, it was infinitely more amazing that she should permit
      it to play Her tune. But there she was composing her face
      to her well-known Beethoven expression, leaning a little
      forward, with her chin in her hand, and her eyes wearing
      the far-away look from which the last chord would recall
      her. At the end of the first movement everybody gave the
      little sigh which was its due, and the wistful sadness
      faded from their faces, and Lucia, with a gesture, hushing
      all attempt at comment or applause, gave a gay little smile
      to show she knew what was coming next. The smile broadened,
      as the Scherzo began, into a little ripple of laughter, the
      hand which had supported her chin once more sought the
      Beethoven brooch, and she sat eager and joyful and alert,
      sometimes just shaking her head in wordless criticism, and
      once saying "Tut-tut" when the clarity of a run did not
      come up to her standard, till the sonata was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A treat," she said at the end, "really most enjoyable.
      That dear old tune! I thought the first movement was a
      little hurried: Cortot, I remember, took it a little more
      slowly, and a little more <i>legato,</i> but it was very
      creditably played."
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga at the machine, was out of sight of Lucia, and during
      the performance Georgie noticed that she had glanced at the
      Sunday paper. And now when Lucia referred to Cortot, she
      hurriedly chucked it into a window-seat and changed the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to have stopped it," she said, "because we needn't
      go to the wireless to hear that. Do show us what you mean,
      Mrs. Lucas, about the first movement."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia glided to the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a bar or two, shall I?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody gave a sympathetic murmur, and they had the first
      movement over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only just my impression of how Cortot plays it," she said.
      "It coincides with my own view of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't move," said Olga, and everybody murmured 'Don't,' or
      'Please.' Robert said 'Please' long after the others,
      because he was drowsy. But he wanted more music, because he
      wished to doze a little and not to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you all work me!" said Lucia, running her hands up and
      down the piano with a butterfly touch. "London will be
      quite a rest after Riseholme. Pepino mio, my portfolio on
      the top of my cloak; would you? . . . Pepino insisted on my
      bringing some music: he would not let me start without it."
      (This was a piece of picturesqueness during Pepino's
      absence: it would have been more accurate to say he was
      sent back for it, but less picturesque.) "Thank you,
      <i>carissimo.</i> A little morsel of Stravinski; Miss Olga,
      I am sure, knows it by heart, and I am terrified. Georgie,
      would you turn over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The morsel of Stravinski had improved immensely since
      Friday: it was still very odd, very modern, but not nearly
      so odd as when, a few days ago, Lucia had failed to observe
      the change of key. But it was strange to the true
      Riseholmite to hear the arch-priestess of Beethoven and the
      foe of all modern music, which she used to account sheer
      Bolshevism, producing these scrannel staccato tinklings
      that had so often made her wince. And yet it all fitted in
      with her approbation of the wireless and her borrowing of
      Georgie's manual on Auction Bridge. It was not the morsel
      of Stravinski alone that Lucia was practising (the
      performance though really improved might still be called
      practice): it was modern life, modern ideas on which she
      was engaged preparatory to her descent on London. Though
      still in harbour at Riseholme, so to speak, it was
      generally felt that Lucia had cast off her cable, and was
      preparing to put to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very pretty: I call that very pretty. Honk!" said Robert
      when the morsel was finished, "I call that music."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Mr. Robert, how sweet of you," said Lucia, wheeling
      round on the music-stool. "Now positively, I will not touch
      another note. But may we, might we, have another little
      tune on your wonderful wireless, Miss Olga! Such a treat! I
      shall certainly have one installed at Brompton Square, and
      listen to it while Pepino is doing his cross-word puzzles.
      Pepino can think of nothing else now but Auction Bridge and
      cross-word puzzles, and interrupts me in the middle of my
      practice to ask for an Athenian sculptor whose name begins
      with P and is of ten letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I've got it," said Pepino, "Praxiteles."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia clapped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bravo," she said. "We shall not sit up till morning
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a splendour in the ruthlessness with which Lucia
      bowled over, like ninepins, every article of her own
      Riseholme creed, which saw Bolshevism in all modern art,
      inanity in crossword puzzles and Bridge, and aimless
      vacuity in London. . . . Immediately after the fresh tune
      on the wireless began, and most unfortunately, they came in
      for the funeral March of a Marionette. A spasm of pain
      crossed Lucia's face, and Olga abruptly turned off this sad
      reminder of unavailing woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on: I like that tune!" said the drowsy and thoughtless
      Robert, and a hurried buzz of conversation covered this
      melancholy coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already late, and Lucia rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delicious evening!" she said. "And lovely to think that we
      shall so soon be neighbours in London as well. My
      music-room always at your disposal. Are you coming,
      Georgie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not this minute," said Georgie firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was not quite accustomed to this, for Georgie usually
      left any party when she left. She put her head in the air
      as she swept by him, but then relented again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dine to-morrow, then? We won't have any music after this
      feast to-night," said she forgetting that the feast had
      been almost completely of her own providing. "But perhaps
      little game of cut-throat, you and Pepino and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delightful," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Olga hurried back after seeing off her other guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Georgie, what richness," she said. "By the way, of
      course it <i>was</i> Cortot who was playing the Moonlight
      faster than Cortot plays it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie put down his tambour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought it probably would be," he said. "That's the kind
      of thing that happens to Lucia. And now we know where we
      are. She's going to make a circle in London and be its
      centre. Too thrilling! It's all as clear as it can be. All
      we don't know about yet is the pearls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt the pearls," said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I think there are pearls," said Georgie, after a
      moment's intense concentration. "Otherwise she wouldn't
      have told me they appeared in the Sargent portrait of the
      aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga suddenly gave a wild hoot of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, why does one ever spend a single hour away from
      Riseholme?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you wouldn't," said Georgie. "But you go off
      to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to Paris. My excuse is to meet my Georgie--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here he is," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, bless him. But the one who happens to be my husband.
      Georgie, I think I'm going to change my name and become
      what I really am, Mrs. George Shuttleworth. Why should
      singers and actresses call themselves Madame Macaroni or
      Signora Semolina? Yes, that's my excuse, as I said when you
      interrupted me, and my reason is gowns. I'm going to have
      lots of new gowns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me about them," said Georgie. He loved hearing about
      dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about them yet; I'm going to Paris to find
      out. Georgie, you'll have to come and stay with me when I'm
      settled in London. And when I go to practise in Lucia's
      music-room you shall play my accompaniments. And shall I be
      shingled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's face was suddenly immersed in concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't mind betting--" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga again shouted with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'll give me three to one that I don't know what you
      were going to say, I'll take it," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can't know," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes I do. You wouldn't mind betting that Lucia will be
      shingled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you are quick," said Georgie admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was known, of course, next morning, that Lucia and
      Pepino were intending to spend a few weeks in London before
      selling the house, and who knew what <i>that</i> was going
      to mean? Already it was time to begin rehearsing for the
      next May Day revels, and Foljambe, that paragon of all
      parlour-maids, had been overhauling Georgie's jerkin and
      hose and dainty little hunting boots with turn-down flaps
      in order to be ready. But when Georgie, dining at The Hurst
      next evening, said something about May Day revels (Lucia,
      of course, would be Queen again) as they played Cut-throat
      with the Manual on Auction Bridge handy for the settlement
      of such small disputes as might arise over the value of the
      different suits, she only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those dear old customs! So quaint! And fifty to me above,
      Pepino, or is it a hundred? I will turn it up while you
      deal, Georgie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This complete apathy of Lucia to May Day revels indicated
      one of two things, that either mourning would prevent her
      being Queen, or absence. In consequence of which Georgie
      had his jerkin folded up again and put away, for he was
      determined that nobody except Lucia should drive him out to
      partake in such a day of purgatory as had been his last
      year. . . . Still, there was nothing conclusive about that:
      it might be mourning. But evidence accumulated that Lucia
      meant to make a pretty solid stay in London, for she
      certainly had some cards printed at 'Ye Signe of Ye
      Daffodille' on the Village Green where Pepino's poems were
      on sale, with the inscription

      Daisy Quantock had found that out, for she saw the engraved
      copper-plate lying on the counter, and while the shopman's
      back was turned, had very cleverly read it, though it was
      printed the wrong way round, and was very confusing. Still
      she managed to do so, and the purport was plain enough:
      that Lucia contemplated formally asking somebody to
      something some time at 25 Brompton Square. "And would she,"
      demanded Daisy, with bitter irony, "have had cards printed
      like that, if they were only meaning to go up for a week or
      two?" And if that was not enough Georgie saw a postcard on
      Lucia's writing table with "From Mrs. Philip Lucas, 25
      Brompton Square, S.W.3," plainly printed on the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting very clear then (and during this week
      Riseholme naturally thought of nothing else) that Lucia
      designed a longer residence in the garish metropolis than
      she had admitted. Since she chose to give no information on
      the subject, mere pride and scorn of vulgar curiosity
      forebade anyone to ask her, though of course it was quite
      proper (indeed a matter of duty) to probe the matter to the
      bottom by every other means in your power, and as these
      bits of evidence pieced themselves together, Riseholme
      began to take a very gloomy view of Lucia's real nature. On
      the whole it was felt that Mrs. Boucher, when she paused in
      her bath-chair as it was being wheeled round the green,
      nodding her head very emphatically, and bawling into Mrs.
      Antrobus's ear-trumpet, reflected public opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's deserting Riseholme and all her friends," said Mrs.
      Boucher, "that's what she's doing. She means to cut a dash
      in London, and lead London by the nose. There'll be
      fashionable parties, you'll see, there'll be paragraphs,
      and then when the season's over she'll come back and
      swagger about them. For my part I shall take no interest in
      them. Perhaps she'll bring down some of her smart friends
      for a Saturday till Monday. There'll be Dukes and Duchesses
      at The Hurst. That's what she's meaning to do, I tell you,
      and I don't care who hears it."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was lucky, as anyone within the radius of a quarter of
      a mile could have heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, never mind, my dear," said Colonel Boucher, who was
      pushing his wife's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind? I should hope not, Jacob," said Mrs. Boucher. "And
      now let us go home, or we'll be late for lunch and that
      would never do, for I expect the Prince of Wales and the
      Lord Chancellor, and we'll play Bridge and cross-word
      puzzles all afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such fury and withering sarcasm, though possibly excessive,
      had, it was felt, a certain justification, for had not
      Lucia for years given little indulgent smiles when anyone
      referred to the cheap delights and restless apish
      chatterings of London? She had always come back from her
      visits to that truly provincial place which thought itself
      a centre, wearied with its false and foolish activity, its
      veneer of culture, its pseudo-Athenian rage for any new
      thing. They were all busy enough at Riseholme, but busy
      over worthy objects, over Beethoven and Shakespeare, over
      high thinking, over study of the true masterpieces. And
      now, the moment that Aunt Amy's death gave her and Pepino
      the means to live in the fiddling little ant-hill by the
      Thames they were turning their backs on all that hitherto
      had made existence so splendid and serious a reality, and
      were training, positively training for frivolity by
      exercises in Stravinski, Auction Bridge and cross-word
      puzzles. Only the day before the fatal influx of fortune
      had come to them, Lucia, dropping in on Colonel and Mrs.
      Boucher about tea-time, had found them very cosily puzzling
      out a Children's Cross-word in the evening paper, having
      given up the adult conundrum as too difficult, had
      pretended that even this was far beyond her poor wits, and
      had gone home the moment she had swallowed her tea in order
      to finish a canto of Dante's Purgatorio. . . . And it was
      no use Lucia's saying that they intended only to spend a
      week or two in Brompton Square before the house was sold:
      Daisy's quickness and cleverness about the copper-plate at
      'Ye Signe of Ye Daffodille' had made short work of that.
      Lucia was evidently the prey of a guilty conscience too:
      she meant, so Mrs. Boucher was firmly convinced, to steal
      away, leaving the impression she was soon coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vigorous reflections like these came in fits and spurts
      from Mrs. Boucher as her husband wheeled her home for
      lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as for the pearls, Jacob," she said, as she got out,
      hot with indignation, "if you asked me, actually asked me
      what I think about the pearls, I should have to tell you
      that I don't believe in the pearls. There may be half a
      dozen seed pearls in an old pill-box: I don't say there are
      not, but that's all the pearls we shall see. Pearls!"

      Georgie had only just come down to breakfast and had not
      yet opened his <i>Times,</i> one morning at the end of this
      hectic week, when the telephone bell rang. Lucia had not
      been seen at all the day before and he had a distinct
      premonition, though he had not time to write it down, that
      this was she. It was: and her voice sounded very brisk and
      playful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that Georgino?" she said. "Zat oo, Georgie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had another premonition, stronger than the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's me," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, is oo coming round to say Ta-ta to poor Lucia and
      Pepino?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      ('I knew it,' thought Georgie.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, are you going away?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I told you the other night," said Lucia in a great
      hurry, "when you were doing cross-words, you and Pepino.
      Sure I did. Perhaps you weren't attending. But--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you never told me," said Georgie firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How cwoss oo sounds. But come round, Georgie, about eleven
      and have 'ickle chat. We're going to be very stravvy and
      motor up, and perhaps keep the motor for a day or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when are you coming back?" asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite settled," said Lucia brightly. "There's a lot of
      bizz-bizz for poor Pepino. Can't quite tell how long it
      will take. Eleven, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had hardly replaced the receiver when there came a
      series of bangs and rings at his front door, and Foljambe
      coming from the kitchen with his dish of bacon in one hand,
      turned to open it. It was only de Vere with a copy of the
      <i>Times</i> in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With Mrs. Quantock's compliments," said de Vere, "and
      would Mr. Pillson look at the paragraph she has marked, and
      send it back? Mrs. Quantock will see him whenever he comes
      round."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That all?" said Foljambe rather crossly. "What did you
      want to knock the house down for then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Vere vouchsafed no reply, but turned slowly in her
      high-heeled shoes and regarded the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie also had come into the hall at this battering
      summons, and Foljambe gave him the paper. There were a
      large blue pencil mark and several notes of exclamation
      opposite a short paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. and Mrs. Philip Lucas will arrive to-day from The
      Hurst, Riseholme, at 25 Brompton Square."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Georgie. "Tell Mrs. Quantock I'll look in after
      breakfast," and he hurried back, and opened his copy of the
      <i>Times</i> to see if it were the same there. It was:
      there was no misprint, nor could any other interpretation
      be attached to it. Though he knew the fact already, print
      seemed to bring it home. Print also disclosed the further
      fact that Lucia must have settled everything at least
      before the morning post yesterday, or this paragraph could
      never have appeared to-day. He gobbled up his breakfast,
      burning his tongue terribly with his tea. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't only deception," said Daisy the moment he
      appeared without even greeting him, "for that we knew
      already, but it's funk as well. She didn't dare tell us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's going to motor up," said Georgie, "starting soon
      after eleven. She's just asked me to come and say goodbye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's more deception then," said Daisy, "for naturally,
      having read that, we should have imagined she was going up
      by the afternoon train, and gone round to say goodbye after
      lunch, and found her gone. If I were you, I shouldn't dream
      of going to say goodbye to her after this. She's shaking
      the dust of Riseholme off her London shoes. . . . But we'll
      have no May Day revels if I've got anything to do with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor me," said Georgie. "But it's no use being cross with
      her. Besides, it's so terribly interesting. I shouldn't
      wonder if she was writing some invitations on the cards you
      saw--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I never saw the cards," said Daisy, scrupulously.
      "Only the plate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the same thing. She may be writing invitations now,
      to post in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go a little before eleven then, and see," said Daisy.
      "Even if she's not writing them then, there'll be envelopes
      lying about perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come too," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Daisy. "If Lucia doesn't choose to
      tell me she's going away, the only dignified thing to do is
      to behave as if I knew nothing whatever about it. I'm sure
      I hope she'll have a very pleasant drive. That's all I can
      say about it; I take no further interest in her movements.
      Besides, I'm very busy: I've got to finish weeding my
      garden, for I've not been able to touch it these last days,
      and then my Planchette arrived this morning. And a Ouija
      board."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sort of Planchette, but much more--much more powerful.
      Only it takes longer, as it points at letters instead of
      writing," said Daisy. "I shall begin with Planchette and
      take it up seriously, because I know I'm very psychic, and
      there'll be a little time for it now that we shan't be
      trapesing round all day in ruffs and stomachers over those
      May-Day revels. Perhaps there'll be May-Day revels in
      Brompton Square for a change. I shouldn't wonder: nothing
      would surprise me about Lucia now. And it's my opinion we
      shall get on very well without her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie felt he must stick up for her: she was catching it
      so frightfully hot all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, it isn't criminal to spend a few weeks in
      London," he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoever said it was?" said Daisy. "I'm all for everybody
      doing exactly as they like. I just shrug my shoulders."
    </p>
    <p>
      She heaved up her round little shoulders with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, how do you think she'll begin up there?" she
      said. "There's that cousin of hers with whom she stayed
      sometimes, Aggie Sandeman, and then, of course, there's
      Olga Bracely. Will she just pick up acquaintances, and pick
      up more from them, like one of those charity snowballs?
      Will she be presented? Not that I take the slightest
      interest in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie looked at his watch and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," he said. "I'm thrilled about it. I expect she'll
      manage. After all, we none of us wanted to have May Day
      revels last year but she got us to. She's got drive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should call it push," said Daisy. "Come back and tell me
      exactly what's happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any message?" asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Daisy again, and began untying the
      string of the parcel that held the instruments of
      divination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie went quickly down the road (for he saw Lucia's
      motor already at the door) and up the paved walk that led
      past the sundial, round which was the circular
      flower-border known as Perdita's border, for it contained
      only the flowers that Perdita gathered. To-day it was all
      a-bloom with daffodils and violets and primroses, and it
      was strange to think that Lucia would not go gassing on
      about Perdita's border, as she always did at this time of
      the year, but would have to be content with whatever
      flowers there happened to be in Brompton Square: a few
      sooty crocuses perhaps and a periwinkle. . . . She was
      waiting for him, kissed her hand through the window, and
      opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for little chat," she said, adjusting a very smart
      hat, which Georgie was sure he had never seen before. There
      was no trace of mourning about it: it looked in the highest
      spirits. So, too, did Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Georgie," she said, "and cheer me up. Poor Lucia
      feels ever so sad at going away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rather sudden," he said. "Nobody dreamed you were
      off to-day, at least until they saw <i>The Times</i> this
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," she said, "but Pepino thought that was the best
      plan. He said that if Riseholme knew when I was going,
      you'd all have had little dinners and lunches for us, and I
      should have been completely worn out with your kindness and
      hospitality. And there was so much to do, and we weren't
      feeling much like gaiety. Seen anybody this morning? Any
      news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw Daisy," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And told her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it was she who saw it in <i>The Times</i> first, and
      sent it round to me," said Georgie. "She's got a Ouija
      board, by the way. It came this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's nice," said Lucia. "I shall think of Riseholme as
      being ever so busy. And everybody must come up and stay
      with me, and you first of all. When will you be able to
      come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever you ask me," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must give me a day or two to settle down, and
      I'll write to you. You'll be popping across though every
      moment of the day to see Olga."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's in Paris," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! What a disappointment! I had already written her a
      card, asking her to dine with us the day after tomorrow,
      which I was taking up to London to post there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She may be back by then," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia rose and went to her writing table, on which, as
      Georgie was thrilled to observe, was a whole pile of
      stamped and directed envelopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I won't chance it," said Lucia, "for I had
      enclosed another card for Signor Cortese which I wanted her
      to forward, asking him for the same night. He composed
      'Lucrezia' you know, which I see is coming out in London in
      the first week of the Opera Season, with her, of course, in
      the name-part. But it will be safer to ask them when I know
      she is back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie longed to know to whom all the other invitations
      were addressed. He saw that the top one was directed to an
      M. P., and guessed that it was for the member for the
      Riseholme district, who had lunched at The Hurst during the
      last election.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are you going to do to-night?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dining with dear Aggie Sandeman. I threw myself on her
      mercy, for the servants won't have settled in, and I hoped
      we should have just a little quiet evening with her. But it
      seems that she's got a large dinner-party on. Not what I
      should have chosen, but there's no help for it now. Oh,
      Georgie, to think of you in dear old quiet Riseholme and
      poor Pepino and me gabbling and gobbling at a huge
      dinner-party."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked wistfully round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, dear music-room," she said, kissing her hand in
      all directions. "How glad I shall be to get back! Oh,
      Georgie, your Manual on Auction Bridge got packed by
      mistake. So sorry. I'll send it back. Come in and play the
      piano sometimes, and then it won't feel lonely. We must be
      off, or Pepino will get fussing. Say goodbye to everyone
      for us, and explain. And Perdita's border! Will sweet
      Perdita forgive me for leaving all her lovely flowers and
      running away to London? After all, Georgie, Shakespeare
      wrote 'The Winter's Tale' in London, did he not? Lovely
      daffies! And violets dim. Let me give you 'ickle violet,
      Georgie, to remind you of poor Lucia tramping about in long
      unlovely streets, as Tennyson said."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, so Georgie felt, wanted no more comments or
      questions about her departure, and went on drivelling like
      this till she was safely in the motor. She had expected
      Pepino to be waiting for her and beginning to fuss, but so
      far from his fussing he was not there at all. So she got in
      a fuss instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgino, will you run back and shout for Pepino?" she
      said. "We shall be so late, and tell him that I am sitting
      in the motor waiting. Ah, there he is! Pepino, where have
      you been? Do get in and let us start, for there are Piggie
      and Goosie running across the green, and we shall never get
      off if we have to begin kissing everybody. Give them my
      love, Georgie, and say how sorry we were just to miss them.
      Shut the door quickly, Pepino, and tell him to drive on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The motor purred and started. Lucia was gone. "She had a
      bad conscience too," thought Georgie, as Piggy and Goosie
      gambolled up rather out of breath with pretty playful
      cries, "and I'm sure I don't wonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      The news that she had gone of course now spread rapidly,
      and by lunch time Riseholme had made up its mind what to
      do, and that was hermetically to close its lips for ever on
      the subject of Lucia. You might think what you pleased, for
      it was a free country, but silence was best. But this
      counsel of perfection was not easy to practice next day
      when the evening paper came. There, for all the world to
      read were two quite long paragraphs, in "Five o'clock
      Chit-Chat," over the renowned signature of Hermione,
      entirely about Lucia and 25 Brompton Square, and there for
      all the world to see was the reproduction of one of her
      most elegant photographs, in which she gazed dreamily
      outwards and a little upwards, with her fingers still
      pressed on the last chord of (probably) the Moonlight
      Sonata. . . . She had come up, so Hermione told countless
      readers, from her Elizabethan country seat at Riseholme
      (where she was a neighbour of Miss Olga Bracely) and was
      settling for the season in the beautiful little house in
      Brompton Square, which was the freehold property of her
      husband, and had just come to him on the death of his aunt.
      It was a veritable treasure house of exquisite furniture,
      with a charming music-room where Lucia had given Hermione a
      cup of tea from her marvellous Worcester tea service. . . .
      (At this point Daisy, whose hands were trembling with
      passion, exclaimed in a loud and injured voice, "The very
      day she arrived!") Mrs. Lucas (one of the Warwickshire
      Smythes by birth) was, as all the world knew, a most
      accomplished musician and Shakespearean scholar, and had
      made Riseholme a centre of culture and art. But nobody
      would suspect the blue stocking in the brilliant, beautiful
      and witty hostess whose presence would lend an added gaiety
      to the London season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was beginning to feel physically unwell. She hurried
      over the few remaining lines, and then ejaculating "Witty!
      Beautiful!" sent de Vere across to Georgie's with the
      paper, bidding him to return it, as she hadn't finished
      with it. But she thought he ought to know. . . . Georgie
      read it through, and with admirable self restraint, sent
      Foljambe back with it and a message of thanks--nothing
      more--to Mrs. Quantock for the loan of it. Daisy, by this
      time feeling better, memorised the whole of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life under the new conditions was not easy, for a mere
      glance at the paper might send any true Riseholmite into a
      paroxysm of chattering rage or a deep disgusted melancholy.
      <i>The Times</i> again recorded the fact that Mr. and Mrs.
      Philip Lucas had arrived at 25 Brompton Square, there was
      another terrible paragraph headed 'Dinner,' stating that
      Mrs. Sandeman entertained the following to dinner. There
      was an Ambassador, a Marquis, a Countess (dowager), two
      Viscounts with wives, a Baronet, a quantity of Honourables
      and Knights, and Mr. and Mrs. Philip Lucas. Every single
      person except Mr. and Mrs. Philip Lucas had a title. The
      list was too much for Mrs. Boucher, who, reading it at
      breakfast, suddenly exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think it of them. And it's a poor consolation to
      know that they must have gone in last."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she hermetically sealed her lips again on this painful
      subject, and when she had finished her breakfast (her
      appetite had quite gone) she looked up every member of that
      degrading party in Colonel Boucher's "Who's Who."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement that Mr. and Mrs. Philip Lucas had arrived
      at 25 Brompton Square was repeated once more, in case
      anybody had missed it (Riseholme had not), and Robert
      Quantock observed that at this rate the three thousand
      pounds a year would soon be gone, with nothing to show for
      it except a few press-cuttings. That was very clever and
      very withering, but anyone could be withering over such a
      subject. It roused, it is true, a faint and unexpressed
      hope that the arrival of Lucia in London had not
      spontaneously produced the desired effect, or why should
      she cause it to be repeated so often? But that brought no
      real comfort, and a few days afterwards, there fell a
      further staggering blow. There was a Court, and Mrs. Agnes
      Sandeman presented Mrs. Philip Lucas. Worse yet, her gown
      was minutely described, and her ornaments were diamonds and
      pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vow of silence could no longer be observed: human
      nature was human nature, and Riseholme would have burst
      unless it had spoken, Georgie sitting in his little back
      parlour overlooking the garden, and lost in exasperated
      meditation, was roused by his name being loudly called from
      Daisy's garden next door, and looking out, saw the
      unprecedented sight of Mrs. Boucher's bath-chair planted on
      Daisy's lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must have come in along the gravel path by the
      back-door," he thought to himself. "I shouldn't have
      thought it was wide enough." He looked to see if his tie
      was straight, and then leaned out to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, come round a minute," called Daisy. "Have you
      seen it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Georgie, "I have. And I'll come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boucher was talking in her loud emphatic voice, when
      he arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for pearls," she said, "I can't say anything about
      them, not having seen them. But as for diamonds, the only
      diamonds she ever had was two or three little chips on the
      back of her wrist-watch. That I'll swear to."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies took no notice of him: Daisy referred to the
      description of Lucia's dress again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe it was her last dinner-gown with a train added,"
      she said. "It was a sort of brocade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and plush is a sort of velvet," said Mrs. Boucher.
      "I've a good mind to write to <i>The Times,</i> and say
      they're mistaken. Brocade! Bunkum! It's pushing and shoving
      instead of diamonds and pearls. But I've had my say, and
      that's all. I shouldn't a bit wonder if we saw that the
      King and Queen had gone to lunch quite quietly at Brompton
      Square."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all very well," said Daisy, "but what are we to
      do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do?" said Mrs. Boucher. "There's plenty to do in
      Riseholme, isn't there? I'm sure I never suffered from lack
      of employment, and I should be sorry to think that I had
      less interests now than I had before last Wednesday week.
      Wednesday, or was it Thursday, when they slipped away like
      that? Whichever it was, it makes no difference to me, and
      if you're both disengaged this evening, you and Mr.
      Georgie, the Colonel and I would be very glad if you would
      come and take your bit of dinner with us. And Mr. Quantock
      too, of course. But as for diamonds and pearls, well, let's
      leave that alone. I shall wear my emerald tiara to-night
      and my ruby necklace. My sapphires have gone to be
      cleaned."
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Riseholme was justifiably incensed over Lucia's
      worldliness and all this pushing and shoving and this
      self-advertising publicity, it had seldom been so wildly
      interested. Also, after the first pangs of shame had lost
      their fierceness, a very different sort of emotion began to
      soothe the wounded hearts: it was possible to see Lucia in
      another light. She had stepped straight from the sheltered
      and cultured life of Riseholme into the great busy feverish
      world, and already she was making her splendid mark there.
      Though it might have been she who had told Hermione what to
      say in those fashionable paragraphs of hers (and those who
      knew Lucia best were surely best competent to form just
      conclusions about that) still Hermione had said it, and the
      public now knew how witty and beautiful Lucia was, and what
      a wonderful house she had. Then on the very night of her
      arrival she had been a guest at an obviously superb
      dinner-party, and had since been presented at Court. All
      this, to look at it fairly, reflected glory on Riseholme,
      and if it was impossible in one mood not to be ashamed of
      her, it was even more impossible in other moods not to be
      proud of her. She had come, and almost before she had seen,
      she was conquering. She could be viewed as a sort of
      ambassadress, and her conquests in that light were
      Riseholme's conquests. But pride did not oust shame, nor
      shame pride, and shuddering anticipations as to what new
      enormity the daily papers might reveal were mingled with
      secret and delighted conjectures as to what Riseholme's
      next triumph would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till the day after her presentation that any
      news came to Riseholme direct from the ambassadress's
      headquarters. Every day Georgie had been expecting to hear,
      and in anticipation of her summons to come up and stay in
      the bedroom with the bathroom and sitting-room attached,
      had been carefully through his wardrobe, and was satisfied
      that he would present a creditable appearance. His small
      portmanteau, Foljambe declared, would be ample to hold all
      that he wanted, including the suit with the Oxford
      trousers, and his cloth-topped boots. When the long
      expected letter came, he therefore felt prepared to start
      that very afternoon, and tore it open with the most eager
      haste and propped it against his teapot.

    <blockquote>
      GEORGINO MIO,<br>
      <br>
      Such a whirl ever since we left, that I haven't had a
      moment. But to-night (Oh such a relief) Pepino and I have
      dined alone quite à la Riseholme, and for the first time I
      have had half an hour's quiet practice in my music-room,
      and now sit down to write to you. (You'd have scolded me if
      you'd heard me play, so stiff and rusty have I become.)<br>
      <br>
      Well, now for my little chronicles. The very first evening
      we were here, we went out to a big dinner at dearest
      Aggie's. Some interesting people: I enjoyed a pleasant talk
      with the Italian Ambassador, and called on them the day
      after, but I had no long conversation with anyone, for
      Aggie kept bringing up fresh people to introduce me to, and
      your poor Lucia got quite confused with so many, till
      Pepino and I sorted them out afterwards. Everyone seemed to
      have heard of our coming up to town, and I assure you that
      ever since the tiresome telephone has been a perfect
      nuisance, though all so kind. Would we go to lunch one day,
      or would we go to dinner another, and there was a private
      view here, and a little music in the afternoon there: I
      assure you I have never been so petted and made so much
      of.<br>
      <br>
      We have done a little entertaining too, already, just a few
      old friends like our member of Parliament, Mr.
      Garroby-Ashton. ("She met him once," thought Georgie in
      parenthesis.) He insisted also on our going to tea with him
      at the House of Commons. I knew that would interest Pepino,
      for he's becoming quite a politician, and so we went. Tea
      on the terrace, and a pleasant little chat with the Prime
      Minister who came and sat at our table for ever so long.
      How I wanted you to be there and make a sketch of the
      Thames: just the sort of view you do, so beautifully!
      Wonderful river, and I repeated to myself 'Sweet Thames,
      run softly, till I end my song.' Then such a scurry to get
      back to dine somewhere or other and go to a play. Then
      dearest Aggie (such a good soul) had set her heart on
      presenting me and I couldn't disappoint her. Did you see
      the description of my dress? How annoyed I was that it
      appeared in the papers! So vulgar all that sort of thing,
      and you know how I hate publicity, but they tell me I must
      just put up with it and not mind.<br>
      <br>
      The house is getting into order, but there are lots of
      little changes and furbishings up to be done before I
      venture to show it to anyone as critical as you, Georgino.
      How you would scream at the carpet in the dining-room! I
      know it would give you indigestion. But when I get the
      house straight, I shall insist on your coming, whatever
      your engagements are, and staying a long, long time. We
      will fix a date when I come down for some week-end.<br>
      <br>
      Your beloved Olga is back, but I haven't seen her yet. I
      asked Signor Cortese to dine and meet her one night, and I
      asked her to meet him. I thought that would make a pleasant
      little party, but they were both engaged. I hope they have
      not quarrelled. Her house, just opposite mine, looks very
      tiny, but I daresay it is quite large enough for her and
      her husband. She sings at the opening night of the Opera
      next week, in "Lucrezia." I must manage to go even if I can
      only look in for an act or two. Pepino (so extravagant of
      him) has taken a box for two nights in the week. It is his
      birthday present to me, so I couldn't scold the dear! And
      after all, we shall give a great deal of pleasure to
      friends, by letting them have it when we do not want it
      ourselves.<br>
      <br>
      Love to everybody at dear Riseholme. I feel quite like an
      exile, and sometimes I long for its sweet peace and
      quietness. But there is no doubt that London suits Pepino
      very well, and I must make the best of this incessant
      hustle. I had hoped to get down for next Sunday, but Mrs.
      Garroby-Ashton (I hear he will certainly be raised to the
      peerage when the birthday honours come out) has made a
      point of our spending it with them. . . . Good-night, dear
      Georgino. Me so so sleepy.<br>

    <p>
      Georgie swallowed this letter at a gulp, and then,
      beginning again, took it in sips. At first it gave him an
      impression of someone wholly unlike her, but when sipped,
      every sentence seemed wonderfully characteristic. She was
      not adapting herself to new circumstances, she was adapting
      new circumstances to herself with all her old ingenuity and
      success, and with all her invincible energy. True, you had
      sometimes to read between the lines, and divide everything
      by about three in order to allow for exaggerations, and
      when Lucia spoke of not disappointing dearest Aggie, who
      had set her heart on presenting her at Court, or of Mrs.
      Garroby-Ashton making a point of her going down for the
      week-end which she had intended to spend at Riseholme,
      Georgie only had to remember how she had been forced (so
      she said) to be Queen at those May Day revels. By sheer
      power of will she had made each of them become a Robin Hood
      or a Maid Marian, or whatever it was, and then, when she
      had got them all at work she said it was she who was being
      worked to death over <i>their</i> May Day revels. They had
      forced her to organise them, they had insisted that she
      should be Queen, and lead the dances and sing louder than
      anybody, and be crowned and curtsied to. They had been wax
      in her hands, and now in new circumstances, Georgie felt
      sure that dearest Aggie had been positively forced to
      present her, and no doubt Mrs. Garroby-Ashton, cornered on
      that terrace of the House of Commons, while sweet Thames
      flowed softly, had had no choice but to ask her down for a
      Sunday. Will-power, indomitable perseverance now, as
      always, was getting her just precisely what she had wanted:
      by it she had become Queen of Riseholme, and by it she was
      firmly climbing away in London, and already she was saying
      that everybody was insisting on her dining and lunching
      with them, whereas it was her moral force that made them
      powerless in her grip. Riseholme she had no use for now:
      she was busy with something else; she did not care to be
      bothered with Georgie, and so she said it was the
      dining-room carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Georgie bitterly. "And if she doesn't
      want me, I won't want her. So that's that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He briskly put the letter away, and began to consider what
      he should do with himself all day. It was warm enough to
      sit out and paint: in fact, he had already begun a sketch
      of the front of his house from the Green opposite; there
      was his piano if he settled to have a morning of music;
      there was the paper to read, there was news to collect,
      there was Daisy Quantock next door who would be delighted
      to have a sitting with the planchette, which was really
      beginning to write whole words instead of making
      meaningless dashes and scribbles, and yet none of these
      things which, together with plenty of conversation and a
      little housekeeping and manicuring, had long made life such
      a busy and strenuous performance, seemed to offer an
      adequate stimulus. And he knew well enough what rendered
      them devoid of tonic: it was that Lucia was not here, and
      however much he told himself he did not want her, he like
      all the rest of Riseholme was beginning to miss her
      dreadfully. She aggravated and exasperated them: she was a
      hypocrite (all that pretence of not having read the Mozart
      duet, and desolation at Auntie's death), a poseuse, a sham
      and a snob, but there was something about her that stirred
      you into violent though protesting activity, and though she
      might infuriate you, she prevented your being dull. Georgie
      enjoyed painting, but he knew that the fact that he would
      show his sketch to Lucia gave spice to his enjoyment, and
      that she, though knowing no more about it than a
      rhinoceros, would hold it at arm's length with her head a
      little on one side and her eyes slightly closed, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Georgie, very nice, very nice. But have you got the
      value of your middle-distance quite right? And a little
      more depth in your distance, do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Or if he played his piano, he knew that what inspired his
      nimbleness would be the prospect of playing his piece to
      her, and if he was practising on the sly a duet for
      performance with her, the knowledge that he was stealing a
      march on her and would astonish her (though she might
      suspect the cause of his facility). And as for
      conversation, it was useless to deny that conversation
      languished in Riseholme if the subject of Lucia, her feats
      and her frailties was tabooed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got to pull ourselves together," thought Georgie,
      "and start again. We must get going and learn to do without
      her, as she's getting on so nicely without us. I shall go
      and see how the planchette is progressing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was already at it, and the pencil was getting up
      steam. A day or two ago it had written not once only but
      many times a strange sort of hieroglyphic, which might
      easily be interpreted to be the mystic word Abfou. Daisy
      had therefore settled (what could be more obvious?) that
      the name of the control who guided these strange gyrations
      was Abfou, which sounded very Egyptian and antique.
      Therefore, she powerfully reasoned, the scribbles which
      could not be made to fit any known configuration of English
      letters might easily be Arabic. Why Abfou should write his
      name in English characters and his communications in Arabic
      was not Daisy's concern, for who knew what were the
      conditions on the other side? A sheet was finished just as
      Georgie came in, and though it presented nothing but Arabic
      script, the movements of the planchette had been so swift
      and eager that Daisy quite forgot to ask if there was any
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abfou is getting in more direct touch with me every time I
      sit," said Daisy. "I feel sure we shall have something of
      great importance before long. Put your hand on the
      planchette too, Georgie, for I have always believed that
      you have mediumistic powers. Concentrate first: that means
      you must put everything else out of your head. Let us sit
      for a minute or two with our eyes shut. Breathe deeply.
      Relax. Sometimes slight hypnosis comes on, so the book
      says, which means you get very drowsy."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a few moments: Georgie wanted to tell
      Daisy about Lucia's letter, but that would certainly
      interrupt Abfou, so he drew up a chair, and after laying
      his hand on Daisy's closed his eyes and breathed deeply.
      And then suddenly the most extraordinary things began to
      happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The planchette trembled: it vibrated like a kettle on the
      boil, and began to skate about the paper. He had no idea
      what its antic motions meant: he only knew that it was
      writing something, Arabic perhaps, but something firm and
      decided. It seemed to him that so far from aiding its
      movement, he almost, to be on the safe side, checked it. He
      opened his eyes, for it was impossible not to want to watch
      this manifestation of psychic force, and also he wished to
      be sure (though he had no real suspicions on the subject)
      that his collaborator was not, to put it coarsely, pushing.
      Exactly the same train of thought was passing in Daisy's
      mind, and she opened her eyes too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, my hand is positively being dragged about," she
      said excitedly. "If anything, I try to resist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine too; so do I," said Georgie. "It's too wonderful. Do
      you suppose it's Arabic still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pencil gave a great dash, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't Arabic," said Daisy as she examined the message,
      "at least, there's heaps of English too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Georgie, putting on his spectacles in his
      excitement, and not caring whether Daisy knew he wore them
      or not. "I can see it looks like English, but what a
      difficult handwriting! Look, that's 'Abfou', isn't it? And
      that is 'Abfou' again there."
    </p>
    <p>
      They bent their heads over the script.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's an 'L,'" cried Daisy, "and there it is again. And
      then there's 'L from L.' And then there's 'Dead' repeated
      twice. It can't mean that Abfou is dead, because this is
      positive proof that he's alive. And then I can see
      'Mouse'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" said Georgie eagerly. "And what would 'dead mouse'
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" said Daisy pointing. "No: it isn't 'dead mouse.'
      It's 'dead' and then a lot of Arabic, and then 'mouse.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it is 'Mouse,'" said Georgie, "though of
      course, you know Abfou's handwriting much better than I do.
      It looks to me far more like 'Museum.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he wants me to send all the Arabic he's written up
      to the British Museum," said Daisy with a flash of genius,
      "so that they can read it and say what it means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then there's 'Museum' or 'Mouse' again there," said
      Georgie, "and surely that word in front of it--It is! It's
      Riseholme! Riseholme Mouse or Riseholme Museum! I don't
      know what either would mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may depend upon it that it means something," said
      Daisy, "and there's another capital 'L.' Does it mean
      Lucia, do you think? But 'dead' . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: dead's got nothing to do with the 'L,'" said Georgie.
      "Museum comes in between, and quantities of Arabic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll just record the exact time; it would be more
      scientific," said Daisy. "A quarter to eleven. No, that
      clock's three minutes fast by the church time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, the church time is slow," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got it," he said. "Look! 'L from L.' That means a
      letter from Lucia. And it's quite true. I heard this
      morning, and it's in my pocket now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Daisy, "that's just a sign Abfou is giving us,
      that he really is with us, and knows what is going on. Very
      evidential."
    </p>
    <p>
      The absorption of them both in this script may be faintly
      appreciated by the fact that neither Daisy evinced the
      slightest curiosity as to what Lucia said, nor Georgie the
      least desire to communicate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then there's 'dead'," said Georgie, looking out of the
      window. "I wonder what that means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I hope it's not Lucia," said Daisy with stoical
      calmness, "but I can't think of anybody else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's eyes wandered over the Green; Mrs. Boucher was
      speeding round in her bath-chair, pushed by her husband,
      and there was the Vicar walking very fast, and Mrs.
      Antrobus and Piggy and Goosey . . . nobody else seemed to
      be dead. Then his eye came back to the foreground of
      Daisy's front garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened to your mulberry-tree?" he said
      parenthetically. "Its leaves are all drooping. You ought
      never to have pruned its roots without knowing how to do
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, you've got it!" she said. "It's the mulberry-tree
      that's dead. Isn't that wonderful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was suitably impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very curious: very curious indeed," he said.
      "Letter from Lucia, and the dead mulberry tree. I do
      believe there's something in it. But let's go on studying
      the script. Now I look at it again I feel certain it is
      Riseholme Museum, not Riseholme Mouse. The only difficulty
      is that there isn't a Museum in Riseholme."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are plenty of mice," observed Daisy, who had had
      some trouble with these little creatures. "Abfou may be
      wanting to give me advice about some kind of ancient
      Egyptian trap. . . . But if you aren't very busy this
      morning, Georgie, we might have another sitting and see if
      we get anything more definite. Let us attain collectedness
      as the directions advise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's collectedness?" asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy gave him the directions. Collectedness seemed to be a
      sort of mixture of intense concentration and complete
      vacuity of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to have to concentrate your mind upon nothing at
      all," said he after reading it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just it," said Daisy. "You put all thoughts out of
      your head, and then focus your mind. We have to be only the
      instrument through which Abfou functions."
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down again after a little deep breathing and
      relaxation, and almost immediately the planchette began to
      move across the paper with a firm and steady progression.
      It stopped sometimes for a few minutes, which was proof of
      the authenticity of the controlling force, for in spite of
      all efforts at collectedness, both Daisy's and Georgie's
      minds were full of things which they longed for Abfou to
      communicate, and if either of them was consciously
      directing those movements, there could have been no pause
      at all. When finally it gave that great dash across the
      paper again, indicating that the communication was
      finished, they found the most remarkable results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abfou had written two pages of foolscap in a tall upright
      hand, which was quite unlike either Daisy's or Georgie's
      ordinary script, and this was another proof (if proof were
      wanted) of authenticity. It was comparatively easy to read,
      and, except for a long passage at the end in Arabic, was
      written almost entirely in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, there's Lucia written out in full four times," said
      Daisy eagerly. "And 'Pepper.' What's Pepper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why Pepino, of course," he said. "I do call that odd. And
      see how it goes on--'Muck company ', no 'Much company, much
      grand company, higher and higher.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Lucia!" said Daisy. "How sarcastic! That's what Abfou
      thinks about it all. By the way, you haven't told me what
      she says yet; never mind, this is far more interesting. . .
      . Then there's a little Arabic, at least I think it's
      Arabic, for I can't make anything out of it, and then--why,
      I believe those next words are 'From Olga.' Have you heard
      from Olga?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Georgie, "but there's something about her in
      Lucia's letter. Perhaps that's it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely. And then I can make out Riseholme, and it
      isn't 'mouse,' it's quite clearly 'Museum,' and then--I
      can't read that, but it looks English, and then 'opera,'
      that's Olga again, and 'dead,' which is the mulberry tree.
      And then 'It is better to work than to be idle. Think
      not--' something--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bark," said Georgie. "No, 'hard.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. 'Think not hard thoughts of any, but turn thy mind to
      improving work.'--Georgie, isn't that wonderful?--and then
      it goes off into Arabic, what a pity! It might have been
      more about the museum. I shall certainly send all the first
      Arabic scripts to the British Museum."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie considered this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somehow I don't believe that is what Abfou means," said
      he. "He says Riseholme Museum, not British Museum. You
      can't possibly get 'British' out of that word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie left Daisy still attempting to detect more English
      among Arabic passages and engaged himself to come in again
      after tea for fresh investigation. Within a minute of his
      departure Daisy's telephone rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How tiresome these interruptions are," said Daisy to
      herself, as she hurried to the instrument. "Yes, yes. Who
      is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's voice had the composure of terrific excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's me," he said. "The second post has just come in, and
      a letter from Olga. 'From Olga,' you remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Daisy. "Do tell me if she says anything about--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Georgie had already rung off. He wanted to read his
      letter from Olga, and Daisy sat down again quite awestruck
      at this further revelation. The future clearly was known to
      Abfou as well as the past, for Georgie knew nothing about
      Olga's letter when the words 'From Olga' occurred in the
      script. And if in it she said anything about 'opera' (which
      really was on the cards) it would be more wonderful still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was nearly over, so Daisy observed to her
      prodigious surprise, for it had really gone like a flash (a
      flash of the highest illuminative power), and she hurried
      out with a trowel and a rake to get half an hour in the
      garden before lunch. It was rather disconcerting to find
      that though she spent the entire day in the garden, often
      not sitting down to her planchette till dusk rendered it
      impossible to see the mazes of cotton threads she had
      stretched over newly-sown beds, to keep off sparrows (she
      had on one occasion shattered with a couple of hasty steps
      the whole of those defensive fortifications) she seemed, in
      spite of blistered hands and aching back, to be falling
      more and more into arrears over her horticulture. Whereas
      that ruffian Simkinson, whom she had dismissed for laziness
      when she found him smoking a pipe in the potting-shed and
      doing a cross-word puzzle when he ought to have been
      working, really kept her garden in very good order by
      slouching about it for three half-days in the week. To be
      sure, she had pruned the roots of the mulberry tree, which
      had taken a whole day (and so incidentally had killed the
      mulberry tree) and though the death of that antique
      vegetable had given Abfou a fine opportunity for proving
      himself, evidence now was getting so abundant that Daisy
      almost wished it hadn't happened. Then, too, she was
      beginning to have secret qualms that she had torn up as
      weeds a quantity of seedlings which the indolent Simkinson
      had just pricked out, for though the beds were now
      certainly weedless, there was no sign of any other growth
      there. And either Daisy's little wooden labels had got
      mixed, or she had sown Brussels sprouts in the circular bed
      just outside the dining-room window instead of Phlox
      Drummondi. She thought she had attached the appropriate
      label to the seed she had sown, but it was very dark at the
      time, and in the morning the label certainly said 'Brussels
      sprouts.' In which case there would be a bed of Phlox at
      the far end of the little strip of kitchen garden. The
      seeds in both places were sprouting now, so she would know
      the worst or the best before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, there was the rockery she had told Simkinson
      to build, which he had neglected for cross-word puzzles,
      and though Daisy had been working six or eight hours a day
      in her garden ever since, she had not found time to touch a
      stone of it, and the fragments lying like a moraine on the
      path by the potting-shed still rendered any approach to the
      latter a mountaineering feat. They consisted of fragments
      of mediæval masonry, from the site of the ancient abbey,
      finials and crockets and pieces of mullioned windows which
      had been turned up when a new siding of the railway had
      been made, and everyone almost had got some with the
      exception of Mrs. Boucher, who called them rubbish. Then
      there were some fossils, ammonites and spar and curious
      flints with holes in them and bits of talc, for Lucia one
      year had commandeered them all into the study of geology
      and they had got hammers and whacked away at the face of an
      old quarry, detaching these petrified relics and hitting
      themselves over the fingers in the process. It was that
      year that the Roman camp outside the village had been put
      under the plough and Riseholme had followed it like a bevy
      of rooks, and Georgie had got several trays full of
      fragments of iridescent glass, and Colonel Boucher had
      collected bits of Samian ware, and Mrs. Antrobus had found
      a bronze fibula or safety-pin. Daisy had got some chunks of
      Roman brickwork, and a section of Roman drainpipe, which
      now figured among the materials for her rockery; and she
      had bought, for about their weight in gold, quite a dozen
      bronze coins. These, of course, would not be placed in the
      rockery, but she had put them somewhere very carefully, and
      had subsequently forgotten where that was. Now as these
      archæological associations came into her mind from the
      contemplation of the materials for the rockery, she
      suddenly thought she remembered that she had put them at
      the back of the drawer in her card-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of these antique fragments disgusted Daisy; they
      littered the path, and she could not imagine them built up
      into a rockery that should have the smallest claim to be an
      attractive object. How could the juxtaposition of a stone
      mullion, a drain-pipe and an ammonite present a pleasant
      appearance? Besides, who was to juxtapose them? She could
      not keep pace with the other needs of the garden, let alone
      a rockery, and where, after all, was the rockery to stand?
      The asparagus-bed seemed the only place, and she preferred
      asparagus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert was bawling out from the dining-room window that
      lunch was ready, and as she retraced her steps to the
      house, she thought that perhaps it would be better to eat
      humble pie and get Simkinson to return. It was clear to
      Daisy that if she was to do her duty as medium between
      ancient Egypt and the world of to-day, the garden would
      deteriorate even more rapidly than it was doing already,
      and no doubt Robert would consent to eat the humble pie for
      her, and tell Simkinson that they couldn't get on without
      him, and that when she had said he was lazy, she had meant
      industrious, or whatever else was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert was in a very good temper that day because Roumanian
      oils which were the main source of his fortunes had
      announced a higher dividend than usual, and he promised to
      seek out Simkinson and explain what lazy meant, and if he
      didn't understand to soothe his injured feelings with a
      small tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And tell him he needn't make a rockery at all," said
      Daisy. "He always hated the idea of a rockery. He can dig a
      pit and bury the fossils and the architectural fragments
      and everything. That will be the easiest way of disposing
      of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is he to do with the earth he takes out of the
      pit, my dear?" asked Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put it back, I suppose," said Daisy rather sharply. Robert
      was so pleased at having 'caught' her, that he did not even
      explain that she had been caught. . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch Daisy found the coins; it was odd that, having
      forgotten where she had put them for so long, she should
      suddenly remember, and she was inclined to attribute this
      inspiration to Abfou. The difficulty was to know what,
      having found them, to do with them next. Some of them
      obviously bore signs of once having had profiles of Roman
      emperors stamped on them, and she was sure she had heard
      that some Roman coins were of great value, and probably
      these were the ones. Perhaps when she sent the Arabic
      script to the British Museum she might send these too for
      identification. . . . And then she dropped them all on the
      floor as the great idea struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flew into the garden, calling to Georgie, who was
      putting up croquet-hoops.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I've got it!" she cried. "It's as plain as plain.
      What Abfou wants us to do is to start a Riseholme Museum.
      He wrote Riseholme Museum quite distinctly. Think how it
      would pay too, when we're overrun with American tourists in
      the summer! They would all come to see it. A shilling
      admission I should put it at, and sixpence for the
      catalogue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if Abfou meant that," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said it," said Daisy. "You can't deny that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what should we put in the Museum?" asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, we should fill it with antiquities and things
      which none of us want in our houses. There are those
      beautiful fragments of the Abbey which I've got, and which
      are simply wasted in my garden with no one to see them, and
      my drainpipe. I would present them all to the Museum, and
      the fossils, and perhaps some of my coins. And my Roman
      brick-work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie paused with a hoop in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is an idea," he said. "And I've got all those lovely
      pieces of iridescent glass, which are always tumbling
      about. I would give them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Colonel Boucher's Samian ware," cried Daisy. "He was
      saying only the other day how he hated it, but didn't quite
      want to throw it away. It will be a question of what we
      leave out, not of what we put in. Besides, I'm sure that's
      what Abfou meant. We must form a committee at once. You and
      Mrs. Boucher and I, I should think, would be enough. Large
      committees are a great mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not Lucia?" asked Georgie, with lingering loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Certainly not," said Daisy. "She would only send us
      orders from London, as to what we were to do and want us to
      undo all we had done when she came back, besides saying she
      had thought of it, and making herself President!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something in that," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course there is, there's sense," said Daisy. "Now I
      shall go straight and see Mrs. Boucher."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie dealt a few smart blows with his mallet to the hoop
      he was putting in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall come too," he said. "Riseholme Museum! I believe
      Abfou did mean that. We <i>shall</i> be busy again."
    </p>
    <p>

      <a name="c04" id="c04">CHAPTER IV</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The committee met that very afternoon, and the next morning
      and the next afternoon, and the scheme quickly took shape.
      Robert, rolling in golden billows of Roumanian oil, was
      called in as financial adviser, and after calculation, the
      scheme strongly recommended itself to him. All the summer
      the town was thronged with visitors, and inquiring American
      minds would hardly leave unvisited the Museum at so
      Elizabethan a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what you'll have in your Museum," he said,
      "but I expect they'll go to look, and even if they don't
      find much they'll have paid their shillings. And if Mrs.
      Boucher thinks her husband will let you have that big
      tithe-barn of his, at a small rent, I daresay you'll have a
      paying proposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of funds therefore in order to convert the
      tithe barn into a museum was instantly gone into. Robert
      professed himself perfectly ready to equip the tithe-barn
      with all necessary furniture and decoration, if he might
      collar the whole of the receipts, but his willingness to
      take all financial responsibilities made the committee
      think that they would like to have a share in them, since
      so shrewd a business man clearly saw the probability of
      making something out of it. Up till then, the sordid
      question of money had not really occurred to them: there
      was to be a museum which would make them busy again, and
      the committee was to run it. They were quite willing to
      devote practically the whole of their time to it, for
      Riseholme was one of those happy places where the proverb
      that Time is money was a flat fallacy, for nobody had ever
      earned a penny with it. But since Robert's financial
      judgment argued that the museum would be a profitable
      investment, the committee naturally wished to have a hand
      in it, and the three members each subscribed fifty pounds,
      and co-opted Robert to join the board and supply the rest.
      Profits (if any) would be divided up between the members of
      the committee in proportion to their subscriptions. The
      financial Robert would see to all that, and the rest of
      them could turn their attention to the provision of
      curiosities.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was evidently to be no lack of them, for everyone in
      Riseholme had stores of miscellaneous antiquities and
      "specimens" of various kinds which encumbered their houses
      and required a deal of dusting, but which couldn't quite be
      thrown away. A very few striking objects were only lent:
      among these were Daisy's box of coins, and Mrs. Antrobus's
      fibula, but the most of them, like Georgie's glass and
      Colonel Boucher's pieces of Samian ware, were fervently
      bestowed. Objects of all sorts poured in, the greater
      portion of a spinning-wheel, an Elizabethan pestle and
      mortar, no end of Roman tiles, a large wooden post
      unhesitatingly called a whipping-post, some indecipherable
      documents on parchment with seals attached, belonging to
      the vicar, an ordnance map of the district, numerous
      collections of fossils and of carved stones from the site
      of the abbey, ancient quilts, a baby's cradle, worm-eaten
      enough to be Anglo-Saxon, queer-shaped bottles, a
      tiger-ware jug, fire-irons too ponderous for use, and (by
      special vote of the Parish Council) the stocks which had
      hitherto stood at the edge of the pond on the green. All
      Riseholme was busy again, for fossils had to be sorted out
      (it was early realised that even a museum could have too
      many ammonites), curtains had to be stitched for the
      windows, labels to be written, Samian ware to be pieced
      together, cases arranged, a catalogue prepared. The period
      of flatness consequent on Lucia's desertion had passed off,
      and what had certainly added zest to industry was the
      thought that Lucia had nothing to do with the museum. When
      next she deigned to visit her discarded kingdom, she would
      find how busily and successfully and originally they had
      got on without her, and that there was no place for her on
      the committee, and probably none in the museum for the
      Elizabethan turnspit which so often made the chimney of her
      music-room to smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riseholme, indeed, was busier than ever, for not only had
      it the museum feverishly to occupy it so that it might be
      open for the tourist season this year, and, if possible,
      before Lucia came down for one of her promised weekends,
      but it was immersed in a wave of psychical experiments.
      Daisy Quantock had been perfectly honest in acknowledging
      that the idea of the museum was not hers at all, but
      Abfou's, her Egyptian guide. She had, it is true, been as
      ingenious as Joseph in interpreting Abfou's directions, but
      it was Abfou to whom all credit was due, and who evidently
      took such a deep interest in the affairs of Riseholme. She
      even offered to present the museum with the sheet of
      foolscap on which the words 'Riseholme Museum' (not mouse)
      were written, but the general feeling of the committee,
      while thanking her for her munificence, was that it would
      not be tactful to display it, since the same Sibylline
      sheet contained those sarcastic remarks about Lucia. It was
      proved also that Abfou had meant the Museum to be started,
      for subsequently he several times said, "Much pleased with
      your plans for the Museum. Abfou approves." So everybody
      else wanted to get into touch with Abfou too, and no less
      than four planchettes or ouija-boards were immediately
      ordered by various members of Riseholme society. At present
      Abfou did not manifest himself to any of them, except in
      what was possibly Arabic script (for it certainly bore a
      strong resemblance to his earlier efforts of communication
      with Daisy), and while she encouraged the scribes to
      persevere in the hope that he might soon regale them with
      English, she was not really very anxious that he should.
      With her he was getting Englisher and Englisher every day,
      and had not Simkinson, after having had the true meaning of
      the word 'lazy' carefully explained to him, consented to
      manage her garden again, it certainly would have
      degenerated into primeval jungle, for she absolutely had
      not a minute to attend to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simkinson, however, was quite genial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, ma'am, very pleased to come back," he said. "I
      knew you wouldn't be able to get on long without me, and I
      want no explanations. Now let's have a look round and see
      what you've been doing. Why, whatever's happened to my
      mulberry tree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Simkinson's way: he always talked of 'my flowers'
      and 'my asparagus' when he meant hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been pruning its roots," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ma'am, you've done your best to do it in," said
      Simkinson. "I don't think it's dead though, I daresay it'll
      pull round."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abfou had been understood to say it was dead, but perhaps
      he meant something else, thought Daisy, and they went on to
      the small circular bed below the dining-room windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Phlox," said Daisy hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Broccoli," said Simkinson examining the young green
      sprouts. "And the long bed there. I sowed a lot of annuals
      there, and I don't see a sign of anything coming up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He fixed her with a merry eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you've been weeding, ma'am," he said. "I shall
      have to get you a lot of young plants if you want a bit of
      colour there. It's too late for me to put my seeds in
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy rather wished she hadn't come out with him, and
      changed the subject to something more cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I shan't want the rockery," she said. "You needn't
      bother about that. All these stones will be carted away in
      a day or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad of that, ma'am. I'll be able to get to my
      potting-shed again. Well, I'll try to put you to rights.
      I'd best pull up the broccoli first, you won't want it
      under your windows, will you? You stick to rolling the
      lawn, ma'am, if you want to garden. You won't do any harm
      then."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather dreadful being put in one's place like this,
      but Daisy did not dare risk a second quarrel, and the sight
      of Georgie at the dining-room window (he had come across to
      'weedj,' as the psychical processes, whether ouija or
      planchette, were now called) was rather a relief. Weeding,
      after all, was unimportant compared with weedjing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I don't believe I ever told you what Olga wrote
      about," said Georgie, as soon as she was within range.
      "We've talked of nothing but museum. Oh, and Mrs. Boucher's
      planchette has come. But it broke in the post, and she's
      gumming it together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt if it will act," said Daisy. "But what did Olga
      say? It quite went out of my head to ask you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too heavenly of her," said he. "She's asked me to go
      up and stay with her for the first night of the opera.
      She's singing Lucrezia, and has got a stall for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Daisy, making a trial trip over the
      blotting-paper to see if the pencil was sharp. "That will
      be an event! I suppose you're going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just about," said Georgie. "It's going to be broadcasted,
      too, and I shall be listening to the original."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How interesting!" said Daisy. "And there you'll be in
      Brompton Square, just opposite Lucia. Oh, you heard from
      her? What did she say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apparently she's getting on marvellously," said Georgie.
      "Not a moment to spare. Just what she likes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy pushed the planchette aside. There would be time for
      that when she had had a little talk about Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you going to stay with her too?" she asked
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was quite determined not to be ill-natured. He had
      taken no part (or very little) in this trampling on Lucia's
      majesty, which had been so merrily going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should love to, if she would ask me," he observed. "She
      only says she's going to. Of course, I shall go to see
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't," said Daisy savagely. "If she asked me fifty
      times I should say 'no' fifty times. What's happened is
      that she's dropped us. I wouldn't have her on our museum
      committee if--if she gave her pearls to it and said they
      belonged to Queen Elizabeth. I wonder you haven't got more
      spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got plenty of spirit," said Georgie, "and I allow I
      did feel rather hurt at her letter. But then, after all,
      what does it matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it doesn't if you're going to stay with Olga,"
      said Daisy. "How she'll hate you for that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can't help it," he said. "Lucia hasn't asked me
      and Olga has. She's twice reminded Olga that she may use
      her music-room to practise in whenever she likes. Isn't
      that kind? She would love to be able to say that Olga's
      always practising in her music-room. But aren't we
      ill-natured? Let's weedj instead."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie found, when he arrived next afternoon in Brompton
      Square, that Olga had already had her early dinner, and
      that he was to dine alone at seven and follow her to the
      opera house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm on the point of collapse from sheer nerves," she said.
      "I always am before I sing, and then out of desperation I
      pull myself together. If--I say 'if'--I survive till
      midnight, we're going to have a little party here. Cortese
      is coming, and Princess Isabel, and one or two other
      people. Georgie, it's very daring of you to come here, you
      know, because my husband's away, and I'm an unprotected
      female alone with Don Juan. How's Riseholme? Talk to me
      about Riseholme. Are you engaged to Piggy yet? And is it
      broccoli or phlox in Daisy's round bed? Your letter was so
      mysterious too. I know nothing about the Museum yet. What
      Museum? Are you going to kill and stuff Lucia and put her
      in the hall? You simply alluded to the Museum as if I knew
      all about it. If you don't talk to me, I shall scream."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie flung himself into the task, delighted to be
      thought capable of doing anything for Olga. He described at
      great length and with much emphasis the whole of the
      history of Riseholme from the first epiphany of Arabic and
      Abfou on the planchette-board down to the return of
      Simkinson. Olga lost herself in these chronicles, and when
      her maid came in to tell her it was time to start, she got
      up quite cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so it was broccoli," she said. "I was afraid it was
      going to be phlox after all. You're an angel, Georgie, for
      getting me through my bad hour. I'll give you anything you
      like for the Museum. Wait for me afterwards at the stage
      door. We'll drive back together."
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment Olga appeared, the success of the opera was
      secure. Cortese, who was conducting, had made his music
      well; it thoroughly suited her, and she was singing and
      looking and acting her best. Again and again after the
      first act the curtain had to go up, and not until the house
      was satisfied could Georgie turn his glances this way and
      that to observe the audience. Then in the twilight of a
      small box on the second tier he espied a woman who was
      kissing her hand somewhere in his direction, and a man
      waving a programme, and then he suddenly focused them and
      saw who they were. He ran upstairs to visit them, and there
      was Lucia in an extraordinarily short skirt with her hair
      shingled, and round her neck three short rows of seed
      pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgino mio!" she cried. "This is a surprise! You came up
      to see our dear Olga's triumph. I do call that loyalty. Why
      did you not tell me you were coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I would call to-morrow," said Georgie, with his
      eyes still going backwards and forwards between the shingle
      and the pearls and the legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you are staying the night in town?" she asked. "Not
      going back by the midnight train? The dear old midnight
      train, and waking in Riseholme! At your club?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm staying with Olga," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia seemed to become slightly cataleptic for a moment,
      but recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Are you really?" she said. "I think that is unkind of
      you, Georgie. You might have told me you were coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you said that the house wasn't ready," said he. "And
      she asked me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia put on a bright smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're forgiven," she said. "We're all at sixes and
      sevens yet. And we've seen nothing of dearest Olga--or Mrs.
      Shuttleworth, I should say, for that's on the bills. Of
      course we'll drive you home, and you must come in for a
      chat, before Mrs. Shuttleworth gets home, and then no doubt
      she will be very tired and want to go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia as she spoke had been surveying the house with
      occasional little smiles and wagglings of her hand in vague
      directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there's Elsie Garroby-Ashton," she said, "and who is
      that with her, Pepino? Lord Shrivenham, surely. So come
      back with me and have 'ickle talk, Georgie. Oh, there's the
      Italian Ambassadress. Dearest Gioconda! Such a sweet. And
      look at the Royal box. What a gathering! That's the Royal
      Box, Georgie, away to the left--that large one--in the tier
      below. Too near the stage for my taste: so little
      illusion--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia suddenly rose and made a profound curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think she saw us, Pepino," she said, "perhaps you had
      better bow. No, she's looking somewhere else now: you did
      not bow quick enough. And what a party in dearest Aggie's
      box. Who can that be? Oh yes, it's Toby Limpsfield. We met
      him at Aggie's, do you remember, on the first night we were
      up. So join us at the grand entrance, Georgie, and drive
      back with us. We shall be giving a lift to somebody else,
      I'll be bound, but if you have your motor, it is so
      ill-natured not to pick up friends. I always do it: they
      will be calling us the 'Lifts of London,' as Marcia Whitby
      said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I can't do that," said Georgie. "I'm waiting
      for Olga, and she's having a little party, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Is she really?" asked Lucia, with all the old
      Riseholme vivacity. "Who is coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cortese, I believe," said Georgie, thinking it might be
      too much for Lucia if he mentioned a princess, "and one or
      two of the singers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's mouth watered, and she swallowed rapidly. That was
      the kind of party she longed to be asked to, for it would
      be so wonderful and glorious to be able casually to allude
      to Olga's tiny, tiny little party after the first night of
      the opera, not a party at all really, just a few
      <i>intimes,</i> herself and Cortese and so on. How could
      she manage it, she wondered? Could she pretend not to know
      that there was a party, and just drop in for a moment in
      neighbourly fashion with enthusiastic congratulations? Or
      should she pretend her motor had not come, and hang about
      the stage-door with Georgie--Pepino could go home in the
      motor--and get a lift? Or should she hint very violently to
      Georgie how she would like to come in just for a minute. Or
      should she, now that she knew there was to be a party,
      merely assert that she had been to it? Perhaps a hint to
      Georgie was the best plan. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Her momentary indecision was put an end to by the
      appearance of Cortese threading his way among the
      orchestra, and the lowering of the lights. Georgie, without
      giving her any further opportunity, hurried back to his
      stall, feeling that he had had an escape, for Lucia's beady
      eye had been fixing him, just in the way it always used to
      do when she wanted something and, in consequence, meant to
      get it. He felt he had been quite wrong in ever supposing
      that Lucia had changed. She was just precisely the same,
      translated into a larger sphere. She had expanded: strange
      though it seemed, she had only been in bud at Riseholme. "I
      wonder what she'll do?" thought Georgie as he settled
      himself into his stall. "She wants dreadfully to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      The opera came to an end in a blaze of bouquets and triumph
      and recalls, and curtseys. It was something of an occasion,
      for it was the first night of the opera, and the first
      performance of "Lucrezia" in London, and it was late when
      Olga came florally out. The party, which was originally
      meant to be no party at all, but just a little supper with
      Cortese and one or two of the singers, had marvellously
      increased during the evening, for friends had sent round
      messages and congratulations, and Olga had asked them to
      drop in, and when she and Georgie arrived at Brompton
      Square, the whole of the curve at the top was packed with
      motors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens, what a lot of people I seem to have asked," she
      said, "but it will be great fun. There won't be nearly
      enough chairs, but we'll sit on the floor, and there won't
      be nearly enough supper, but I know there's a ham, and what
      can be better than a ham? Oh, Georgie, I am happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now from opposite, across the narrow space of the square,
      Lucia had seen the arrival of all these cars. In order to
      see them better she had gone on to the balcony of her
      drawing-room, and noted their occupants with her
      opera-glasses. There was Lord Limpsfield, and the Italian
      Ambassadress, and Mr. Garroby-Ashton, and Cortese, and some
      woman to whom Mr. Garroby-Ashton bowed and Mrs.
      Garroby-Ashton curtsied. Up they streamed. And there was
      the Duchess of Whitby, (Marcia, for Lucia had heard her
      called that) coming up the steps, and curtseying too, but
      as yet Olga and Georgie quite certainly had not come. It
      seemed strange that so many brilliant guests should arrive
      before their hostess, but Lucia saw at once that this was
      the most <i>chic</i> informality that it was possible to
      conceive. No doubt Mr. Shuttleworth was there to receive
      them, but how wonderful it all was! . . . And then the
      thought occurred to her that Olga would arrive, and with
      her would be Georgie, and she felt herself turning bright
      green all over with impotent jealousy. Georgie in that
      crowd! It was impossible that Georgie should be there, and
      not she, but that was certainly what would happen unless
      she thought of something. Georgie would go back to
      Riseholme and describe this gathering, and he would say
      that Lucia was not there: he supposed she had not been
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia thought of something; she hurried downstairs and let
      herself out. Motors were still arriving, but perhaps she
      was not too late. She took up her stand in the central
      shadow of a gas-lamp close to Olga's door and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the square came yet another car, and she could see it
      was full of flowers. Olga stepped out, and she darted
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Mrs. Shuttleworth," she said. "Splendid! Glorious!
      Marvellous! If only Beethoven was alive! I could not think
      of going to bed, without just popping across to thank you
      for a revelation! Georgie, dear! Just to shake your hand:
      that is all. All! I won't detain you. I see you have a
      party! You wonderful Queen of Song."
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga at all times was good-natured. Her eye met Georgie's
      for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, but come in," she said. "Do come in. It isn't a party:
      it's just anybody. Georgie, be a dear, and help to carry
      all those flowers in. How nice of you to come across, Mrs.
      Lucas! I know you'll excuse my running on ahead, because
      all--at least I hope all--my guests have come, and there's
      no one to look after them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, following closely in her wake, and taking no further
      notice of Georgie, slipped into the little front
      drawing-room behind her. It was crammed, and it was such a
      little room. Why had she not foreseen this, why had she not
      sent a note across to Olga earlier in the day, asking her
      to treat Lucia's house precisely as her own, and have her
      party in the spacious music-room? It would have been only
      neighbourly. But the bitterness of such regrets soon
      vanished in the extraordinary sweetness of the present, and
      she was soon in conversation with Mrs. Garroby-Ashton, and
      distributing little smiles and nods to all the folk with
      whom she had the slightest acquaintance. By the fireplace
      was standing the Royal lady, and that for the moment was
      the only chagrin, for Lucia had not the vaguest idea who
      she was. Then Georgie came in, looking like a flower-stall,
      and then came a slight second chagrin, for Olga led him up
      to the Royal lady, and introduced him. But that would be
      all right, for she could easily get Georgie to tell her who
      she was, without exactly asking him, and then poor Georgie
      made a very awkward sort of bow, and dropped a large
      quantity of flowers, and said 'tarsome.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia glided away from Mrs. Garroby-Ashton and stood near
      the Duchess of Whitby. Marcia did not seem to recognise her
      at first, but that was quickly remedied, and after a little
      pleasant talk, Lucia asked her to lunch to meet Olga, and
      fixed in her mind that she must ask Olga to lunch on the
      same day to meet the Duchess of Whitby. Then edging a
      little nearer to the centre of attraction, she secured Lord
      Limpsfield by angling for him with the bait of dearest
      Aggie, to whom she must remember to telephone early next
      morning, to ask her to come and meet Lord Limpsfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would do for the present, and Lucia abandoned herself
      to the joys of the moment. A move was made downstairs to
      supper, and Lucia, sticking like a limpet to Lord
      Limpsfield, was wafted in azure to Olga's little tiny
      dining-room, and saw at once that there were not nearly
      enough seats for everybody. There were two small round
      tables, and that was absolutely all: the rest would have to
      stand and forage at the narrow buffet which ran along the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's musical chairs," said Olga cheerfully, "those who are
      quick get seats, and the others don't. Tony, go and sit
      next the Princess, and Cortese, you go the other side. We
      shall all get something to eat sometime. Georgie, go and
      stand by the buffet, there's a dear, and make yourself
      wonderfully useful, and oh, rush upstairs first, and bring
      the cigarettes; they stay the pangs of hunger. Now we're
      getting on beautifully. Darling Marcia, there's just one
      chair let. Slip into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had lingered for a moment at the door to ask Olga to
      lunch the day after to-morrow, and Olga said she would be
      delighted, so there was a wonderful little party arranged
      for. To complete her content it was only needful to be
      presented to the hitherto anonymous Princess and learn her
      name. By dexterously picking up her fan for her and much
      admiring it, as she made a low curtsey, she secured a few
      precious words with her, but the name was still denied her.
      To ask anybody what it was would faintly indicate that she
      didn't know it, and that was not to be thought of.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie popped in, as they all said at Riseholme, to see
      Lucia next morning when Olga had gone to a rehearsal at
      Covent Garden, and found her in her music-room, busy over
      Stravinski. Olga's party had not been in <i>The Times,</i>
      which was annoying, and Lucia was still unaware what the
      Princess's name was. Though the previous evening had been
      far the most rewarding she had yet spent, it was wiser to
      let Georgie suppose that such an affair was a very ordinary
      occurrence, and not to allude to it for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Georgino!" she said. "How nice of you to pop in. By
      <i>buona fortuna</i> I have got a spare hour this morning,
      before Sophy Alingsby--dear Sophy, such a brain--fetches me
      to go to some private view or other, so we can have a good
      chat. Yes, this is the music-room, and before you go, I
      must trot you round to see the rest of our little
      establishment. Not a bad room--those are the famous
      Chippendale chairs--as soon as we get a little more
      settled, I shall give an evening party or two with some
      music. You must come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should love to," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a whirl it has been, and it gets worse every day,"
      went on Lucia. "Sometimes Pepino and I go out together, but
      often he dines at one house and I at another--they do that
      in London, you know--and sometimes I hardly set eyes on him
      all day. I haven't seen him this morning, but just now they
      told me he had gone out. He enjoys it so much that I do not
      mind how tired I get. Ah! that telephone, it never ceases
      ringing. Sometimes I think I will have it taken out of the
      house altogether, for I get no peace. Somebody always seems
      to be wanting Pepino or me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried, all the same, with considerable alacrity to
      the machine, and really there was no thought in her mind of
      having the telephone taken out, for it had only just been
      installed. The call, however, was rather a disappointment,
      for it only concerned a pair of walking shoes. There was no
      need, however, to tell Georgie that, and pressing her
      finger to her forehead she said, "Yes, I can manage 3.30,"
      (which meant nothing) and quickly rang off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a moment's peace," said Lucia. "Ting-a-ting-a-ting
      from morning till night. Now tell me all about Riseholme,
      Georgie; that will give me such a delicious feeling of
      tranquillity. Dear me, who is this coming to interrupt us
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only Pepino. He seemed leisurely enough, and rather
      unnecessarily explained that he had only been out to get a
      tooth-brush from the chemist's in Brompton Road. This he
      carried in a small paper parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there's the man coming about the telephone this
      morning, Lucia," he said. "You want the extension to your
      bedroom, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear, as we have got it in the house we may as well
      have it conveniently placed," she said. "I'm sure the miles
      I walk up and down stairs, as I was telling Georgie--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She woke them up, Georgie," he said. "None of their
      leisurely London ways for Lucia. She had the telephone put
      into the house in record time. Gave them no peace till she
      got it done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very wise," said Georgie tactfully. "That's the way to get
      things. Well, about Riseholme. We've really been very busy
      indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear old place!" said Lucia. "Tell me all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie rapidly considered with himself whether he should
      mention the Museum. He decided against it, for, put it as
      you might, the museum, apart from the convenience of
      getting rid of interesting rubbish, was of a conspiratorial
      nature, a policy of revenge against Lucia for her
      desertion, and a demonstration of how wonderfully well and
      truly they all got on without her. It was then, the mark of
      a highly injudicious conspirator to give information to her
      against whom this plot was directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Daisy has been having some most remarkable
      experiences," he said. "She got a ouija board and a
      planchette--we use the planchette most--and very soon it
      was quite clear that messages were coming through from a
      guide."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed with a shrill metallic note of rather hostile
      timbre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Daisy," she said. "If only she would take commonsense
      as her guide. I suppose the guide is a Chaldean astrologer
      or King Nebuchadnezzar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," said Georgie. "It's an Egyptian called
      Abfou."
    </p>
    <p>
      A momentary pang of envy shot through Lucia. She could well
      imagine the quality of excitement which thrilled Riseholme,
      how Georgie would have popped in to tell her about it, and
      how she would have got a ouija-board too, and obtained
      twice as many messages as Daisy. She hated the thought of
      Daisy having Abfou all her own way, and gave another little
      shrill laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daisy is priceless," she said. "And what has Abfou told
      her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it was very odd," said Georgie. "The morning I got
      your letter Abfou wrote 'L from L,' and if that doesn't
      mean 'Letter from Lucia,' I don't know what else it could
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might just as well mean 'Lozenges from Leamington,'"
      said Lucia witheringly. "And what else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie felt the conversation was beginning to border
      rather dangerously on the Museum, and tried a light-hearted
      sortie into another subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just things of that sort," he said. "And then she had
      a terrible time over her garden. She dismissed Simkinson
      for doing cross-word puzzles instead of the lawn, and
      determined to do it all herself. She sowed sprouts in that
      round bed under the dining-room window."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Pepino, who was listening with qualms of
      home-sickness to these chronicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and the phlox in the kitchen garden," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Lucia, and became aware that her gimlet-eye
      was on him, and was afraid he had made the transition from
      Abfou to horticulture rather too eagerly. He went volubly
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she dug up all the seeds that Simkinson had planted,
      and pruned the roots of her mulberry tree and probably
      killed it," he said. "Then in that warm weather last week,
      no, the week before, I got out my painting things again,
      and am doing a sketch of my house from the green. Foljambe
      is very well, and, and . . ." he could think of nothing
      else except the Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia waited till he had quite run down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what more did Abfou say?" she asked. "His message of
      'L to L' would not have made you busy for very long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had to reconsider the wisdom of silence. Lucia
      clearly suspected something, and when she came down for her
      week-end, and found the affairs of the Museum entirely
      engrossing the whole of Riseholme, his reticence, if he
      persisted in it, would wear a very suspicious aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, the museum," he said with feigned lightness.
      "Abfou told us to start a museum, and it's getting on
      splendidly. That tithe-barn of Colonel Boucher's. And
      Daisy's given all the things she was going to make into a
      rockery, and I'm giving my Roman glass and two sketches,
      and Colonel Boucher his Samian ware and an ordnance map,
      and there are lots of fossils and some coins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a committee?" asked Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Daisy and Mrs. Boucher and I, and we co-opted
      Robert," he said with affected carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again some nameless pang shot through Lucia. Absent or
      present, she ought to have been the chairman of the
      committee and told them exactly what to do, and how to do
      it. But she felt no doubt that she could remedy all that
      when she came down to Riseholme for a week-end. In the
      meantime, it was sufficient to have pulled his secret out
      of Georgie, like a cork, with a loud pop, and an effusion
      of contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most interesting," she said. "I must think what I can give
      you for your museum. Well, that's a nice little gossip."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie could not bring himself to tell her that the stocks
      had already been moved from the village green to the
      tithe-barn, for he seemed to remember that Lucia and Pepino
      had presented them to the Parish Council. Now the Parish
      Council had presented them to the Museum, but that was a
      reason the more why the Parish Council and not he should
      face the donors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A nice little gossip," said Lucia. "And what a pleasant
      party last night. I just popped over, to congratulate dear
      Olga on the favourable, indeed the very favourable
      reception of 'Lucrezia,' for I thought she would be
      hurt--artists are so sensitive--if I did not add my little
      tribute, and then you saw how she refused to let me go, but
      insisted that I should come in. And I found it all most
      pleasant: one met many friends, and I was very glad to be
      able to look in."
    </p>
    <p>
      This expressed very properly what Lucia meant to convey.
      She did not in the least want to put Olga in her place, but
      to put herself, in Georgie's eyes, in her own place. She
      had just, out of kindness, stepped across to congratulate
      Olga, and then had been dragged in. Unfortunately Georgie
      did not believe a single word of it: he had already made up
      his mind that Lucia had laid an ambush for Olga, so swiftly
      and punctually had she come out of the shadow of the
      gas-lamp on her arrival. He answered her therefore
      precisely in the spirit in which she had spoken. Lucia
      would know very well. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was good of you," he said enthusiastically. "I'm sure
      Olga appreciated your coming immensely. How forgetful of
      her not to have asked you at first! And as for 'Lucrezia'
      just having a favourable reception, I thought it was the
      most brilliant success it is possible to imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia felt that her attitude hadn't quite produced the
      impression she had intended. Though she did not want
      Georgie (and Riseholme) to think <i>she</i> joined in the
      uncritical adulation of Olga, she certainly did not want
      Georgie to tell Olga that she didn't. And she still wanted
      to hear the Princess's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt, dear Georgie," she said, "it was a great
      success. And she was in wonderful voice, and looked most
      charming. As you know, I am terribly critical, but I can
      certainly say that. Yes. And her party delicious. So many
      pleasant people. I saw you having great jokes with the
      Princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino having been asleep when Lucia came back last night,
      and not having seen her this morning, had not heard about
      the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, who was that?" he asked Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very tiresome of Pepino. But Lucia's guide (better than
      poor Daisy's Abfou) must have been very attentive to her
      needs that morning, for Pepino had hardly uttered these
      awkward words, when the telephone rang. She could easily
      therefore trip across to it, protesting at these tiresome
      interruptions, and leave Georgie to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mrs. Lucas," said Lucia. "Covent Garden? Yes. Then
      please put me through. . . . Dearest Olga is ringing up. No
      doubt about 'The Valkyrie' next week. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had a brain wave. He felt sure Lucia would have
      answered Pepino's question instantly if she had known what
      the Princess's name was. He had noticed that Lucia in spite
      of her hangings about had not been presented to the
      illustrious lady last night, and the brainwave that she did
      not know the illustrious lady's name swept over him. He
      also saw that Lucia was anxiously listening not to the
      telephone only, but to him. If Lucia (and there could be no
      doubt about that) wanted to know, she must eat her humble
      pie and ask him. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear Diva, it's me," said Lucia. "Couldn't sleep a
      wink: 'Lucrezia' running in my head all night. Marvellous.
      You rang me up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am disappointed you can't come," she said. "You are
      naughty. I shall have to give you a little engagement book
      to put things down in. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's guide befriended her again, and her face
      brightened. It grew almost to an unearthly brightness as
      she listened to Olga's apologies and a further proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sunday evening?" she said. "Now let me think a moment:
      yes, I am free on Sunday. So glad you said Sunday, because
      all other nights are full. Delightful. And how nice to see
      Princess Isabel again. Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      She snapped the receiver back in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it you asked me, Pepino?" she said. "Oh, yes: it
      was Princess Isabel. Dear Olga insists on my dining with
      her on Sunday to meet her again. Such a nice woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought we were going down to Riseholme for the Sunday,"
      said Pepino.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia made a little despairing gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor head!" she said. "It is I who ought to have an
      engagement book chained to me. What am I to do? I hardly
      like to disappoint dear Olga. But you go down, Pepino, just
      the same. I know you are longing to get a breath of country
      air. Georgie will give you dinner one night, I am sure, and
      the other he will dine with you. Won't you, Georgie? So
      dear of you. Now who shall I get to fill my Olga's place at
      lunch to-morrow? Mrs. Garroby-Ashton, I think. Dear me, it
      is close on twelve, and Sophy will scold me if I keep her
      waiting. How the morning flashes by! I had hardly begun my
      practise, when Georgie came, and I've hardly had a word
      with him before it is time to go out. What will happen to
      my morning's post I'm sure I don't know. But I insist on
      your getting your breath of country-air on Sunday, Pepino.
      I shall have plenty to do here, with all my arrears."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one note Lucia found she had to write before she
      went out, and she sent Pepino to show Georgie the house
      while she scribbled it, and addressing it to Mr. Stephen
      Merriall at the office of the <i>Evening Gazette,</i> sent
      it off by hand. This was hardly done when Mrs. Alingsby
      arrived, and they went off together to the private view of
      the Post-Cubists, and revelled in the works of those
      remarkable artists. Some were portraits and some
      landscapes, and it was usually easy to tell which was
      which, because a careful scrutiny revealed an eye or a
      stray mouth in some, and a tree or a house in others. Lucia
      was specially enthusiastic over a picture of Waterloo
      Bridge, but she had mistaken the number in the catalogue,
      and it proved to be a portrait of the artist's wife.
      Luckily she had not actually read out to Sophy that it was
      Waterloo Bridge, though she had said something about the
      river, but this was easily covered up in appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too wonderful," she said. "How they get to the very soul
      of things! What is it that Wordsworth says? 'The very pulse
      of the machine.' Pulsating, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Alingsby was tall and weird and intense, dressed
      rather like a bird-of-paradise that had been out in a high
      gale, but very well connected. She had long straight hair
      which fell over her forehead, and sometimes got in her
      eyes, and she wore on her head a scarlet jockey-cap with an
      immense cameo in front of it. She hated all art that was
      earlier than 1923, and a considerable lot of what was
      later. In music, on the other hand, she was primitive, and
      thought Bach decadent: in literature her taste was for
      stories without a story, and poems without metre or
      meaning. But she had collected round her a group of
      interesting outlaws, of whom the men looked like women, and
      the women like nothing at all, and though nobody ever knew
      what they were talking about, they themselves were talked
      about. Lucia had been to a party of hers, where they all
      sat in a room with black walls, and listened to early
      Italian music on a spinet while a charcoal brazier on a
      blue hearth was fed with incense. . . . Lucia's general
      opinion of her was that she might be useful up to a point,
      for she certainly excited interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wordsworth?" she asked. "Oh, yes, I remember who you mean.
      About the Westmoreland Lakes. Such a kill-joy."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put on her large horn spectacles to look at the picture
      of the artist's wife, and her body began to sway with a
      lithe circular motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marvellous! What a rhythm!" she said. "Sigismund is the
      most rhythmical of them all. You ought to be painted by
      him. He would make something wonderful of you. Something
      <i>andante, adagio</i> almost. He's coming to see me on
      Sunday. Come and meet him. Breakfast about half-past
      twelve. Vegetarian with cocktails."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia accepted this remarkable invitation with avidity: it
      would be an interesting and progressive meal. In these
      first weeks, she was designedly experimental; she intended
      to sweep into her net all there was which could conceivably
      harbour distinction, and sort it out by degrees. She was no
      snob in the narrow sense of the word; she would have been
      very discontented if she had only the high-born on her
      visiting list. The high-born, of course, were safe--you
      could not make a mistake in having a duchess to tea,
      because in her own line a duchess had distinction--but it
      would not have been enough to have all the duchesses there
      were: it might even have been a disappointing tea-party if
      the whole room was packed with them. What she wanted was
      the foam of the wave, the topmost, the most sunlit of the
      billows that rode the sea. Anything that had proved itself
      billowish was her game, and anything which showed signs of
      being a billow, even if it entailed a vegetarian lunch with
      cocktails and the possible necessity of being painted like
      the artist's wife with an eyebrow in one corner of the
      picture and a substance like desiccated cauliflower in the
      centre. That had always been her way: whatever those dear
      funny folk at Riseholme had thought of, a juggler, a
      professor of Yoga, a geologist, a psycho-analyst had been
      snapped up by her and exploited till he exploded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pepino was not as nimble as she. The incense at Sophy's
      had made him sneeze, and the primitive tunes on the spinet
      had made him snore; that had been all the uplift they had
      held for him. Thus, though she did not mind tiring herself
      to death, because Pepino was having such an interesting
      time, she didn't mind his going down to Riseholme for the
      Sunday to rest, while she had a vegetarian lunch with
      post-cubists, and a dinner with a princess. Literally, she
      could scarcely tell which of the two she looked forward to
      most; the princess was safe, but the post-cubists might
      prove more perilously paying. It was impossible to make a
      corner in princesses for they were too independent, but
      already, in case of post-cubism turning out to be the rage,
      she could visualise her music-room and even the famous
      Chippendale chairs being painted black, and the Sargent
      picture of Auntie being banished to the attic. She could
      not make them the rage, for she was not (as yet) the
      supreme arbiter here that she had been at Riseholme, but
      should they become the rage, there was no one surely more
      capable than herself of giving the impression that she had
      discovered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia spent a strenuous afternoon with correspondence and
      telephonings, and dropped into Mrs. Sandeman's for a cup of
      tea, of which she stood sorely in need. She found there was
      no need to tell dearest Aggie about the party last night at
      Olga's, for the <i>Evening Gazette</i> had come in, and
      there was an account of it, described in Hermione's
      matchless style. Hermione had found the bijou residence of
      the prima-donna in Brompton Square full of friends--<i>très
      intimes</i>--who had been invited to celebrate the huge
      success of "Lucrezia" and to congratulate Mrs.
      Shuttleworth. There was Princess Isabel, wearing her
      wonderful turquoises, chatting with the composer, Signor
      Cortese (Princess Isabel spoke Italian perfectly), and
      among other friends Hermione had noticed the Duchess of
      Whitby, Lord Limpsfield, Mrs. Garroby-Ashton, and Mrs.
      Philip Lucas.

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery of that Friday evening in the last week in June
      became portentous on the ensuing Saturday morning. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      A cab had certainly driven from the station to The Hurst
      late on Friday evening, but owing to the darkness it was
      not known who got out of it. Previously the windows of The
      Hurst had been very diligently cleaned all Friday
      afternoon. Of course the latter might be accounted for by
      the mere fact that they needed cleaning, but if it had been
      Pepino or Lucia herself who had arrived by the cab (if both
      of them, they would almost certainly have come by their
      motor), surely some sign of their presence would have
      manifested itself either to Riseholme's collective eye, or
      to Riseholme's ear. But the piano, Daisy felt certain, had
      not been heard, nor had the telephone tinkled for anybody.
      Also, when she looked out about half-past ten in the
      evening, and again when she went upstairs to bed, there
      were no lights in the house. But somebody had come, and as
      the servants' rooms looked out on to the back, it was
      probably a servant or servants. Daisy had felt so terribly
      interested in this that she came restlessly down, and had a
      quarter of an hour's weedjing to see if Abfou could tell
      her. She had been quite unable to form any satisfactory
      conjecture herself, and Abfou, after writing Museum once or
      twice, had relapsed into rapid and unintelligible Arabic.
      She did not ring up Georgie to ask his help in solving this
      conundrum, because she hoped to solve it unaided and be
      able to tell him the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went upstairs again, and after a little deep-breathing
      and bathing her feet in alternate applications of hot and
      cold water in order to produce somnolence, found herself
      more widely awake than ever. Her well-trained mind cantered
      about on scents that led nowhere, and she was unable to
      find any that seemed likely to lead anywhere. Of Lucia
      nothing whatever was known except what was accessible to
      anybody who spent a penny on the <i>Evening Gazette.</i>
      She had written to nobody, she had given no sign of any
      sort, and, but for the <i>Evening Gazette,</i> she might,
      as far as Riseholme was concerned, be dead. But the
      <i>Evening Gazette</i> showed that she was alive, painfully
      alive in fact, if Hermione could be trusted. She had been
      seen here, there and everythere in London: Hermione had
      observed her chatting in the Park with friends, sitting
      with friends in her box at the opera, shopping in Bond
      Street, watching polo (why, she did not know a horse from a
      cow!) at Hurlingham, and even in a punt at Henley. She had
      been entertaining in her own house too: there had been
      dinner-parties and musical parties, and she had dined at so
      many houses that Daisy had added them all up, hoping to
      prove that she had spent more evenings than there had been
      evenings to spend, but to her great regret they came out
      exactly right. Now she was having her portrait painted by
      Sigismund, and not a word had she written, not a glimpse of
      herself had she vouchsafed, to Riseholme. . . . Of course
      Georgie had seen her, when he went up to stay with Olga,
      but his account of her had been far from reassuring. She
      had said that she did not care how tired she got while
      Pepino was enjoying London so tremendously. Why then,
      thought Daisy with a sense of incredulous indignation, had
      Pepino come down a few Sundays ago, all by himself, and
      looking a perfect wreck? . . . "Very odd, <i>I</i> call
      it," muttered Daisy, turning over to her other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was odd, and Pepino had been odd. He had dined with
      Georgie one night, and on the other Georgie had dined with
      him, but he had said nothing about Lucia that Hermione had
      not trumpeted to the world. Otherwise, Pepino had not been
      seen at all on that Sunday except when Mrs. Antrobus, not
      feeling very well in the middle of the Psalms on Sunday
      morning, had come out, and observed him standing on tip-toe
      and peering into the window of the Museum that looked on to
      the Roman Antiquities. Mrs. Antrobus (feeling much better
      as soon as she got into the air) had come quite close up to
      him before he perceived her, and then with only the curtest
      word of greeting, just as if she was the Museum Committee,
      he had walked away so fast that she could not but conclude
      that he wished to be alone. It was odd too, and scarcely
      honourable, that he should have looked into the window like
      that, and clearly it was for that purpose that he had
      absented himself from church, thinking that he would be
      unobserved. Daisy had not the smallest doubt that he was
      spying for Lucia, and had been told merely to collect
      information and to say nothing, for though he knew that
      Georgie was on the committee, he had carefully kept off the
      subject of the Museum on both their tête-à-tête dinners.
      Probably he had begun his spying the moment church began,
      and if Mrs. Antrobus had not so providentially felt faint,
      no one would have known anything about it. As it was, it
      was quite likely that he had looked into every window by
      the time she saw him, and knew all that the Museum
      contained. Since then, the Museum had been formally opened
      by Lady Ambermere, who had lent (not presented) some
      mittens which she said belonged to Queen Charlotte (it was
      impossible to prove that they hadn't), and the committee
      had put up some very baffling casement curtains which would
      make an end to spying for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this degrading espionage had happened three weeks ago
      (come Sunday), and therefore for three weeks (come Monday),
      Lucia must have known all about the Museum. But not a word
      had she transmitted on that or any other subject; she had
      not demanded a place on the committee, nor presented the
      Elizabethan spit which so often made the chimney of her
      music-room to smoke, nor written to say that they must
      arrange it all quite differently. That she had a plan, a
      policy about the Museum, no one who knew Lucia could
      possibly doubt, but her policy (which thus at present was
      wrapped in mystery) might be her complete and eternal
      ignoring of it. It would indeed be dreadful if she intended
      to remain unaware of it, but Daisy doubted if anyone in her
      position and of her domineering character could be capable
      of such inhuman self-control. No: she meant to do something
      when she came back, but nobody could guess what it was, or
      when she was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy tossed and turned as she revolved these knotty
      points. She was sure Lucia would punish them all for making
      a Museum while she was away, and not asking her advice and
      begging her to be president, and she would be ill with
      chagrin when she learned how successful it was proving. The
      tourist season, when char-a-bancs passed through Riseholme
      in endless procession, had begun, and whole parties after
      lunching at the Ambermere Arms went to see it. In the first
      week alone there had been a hundred and twenty-six
      visitors, and that meant a corresponding take of shillings
      without reckoning sixpenny catalogues. Even the committee
      paid their shillings when they went in to look at their own
      exhibits, and there had been quite a scene when Lady
      Ambermere with a party from the Hall tried to get in
      without paying for any of them on the ground that she had
      lent the Museum Queen Charlotte's mittens. Georgie, who was
      hanging up another picture of his, had heard it all and
      hidden behind a curtain. The small boy in charge of the
      turnstile (bought from a bankrupt circus for a mere song)
      had, though trembling with fright, absolutely refused to
      let the turnstile turn until the requisite number of
      shillings had been paid, and didn't care whose mittens they
      were which Lady Ambermere had lent, and when, snatching up
      a catalogue without paying for it, she had threatened to
      report him to the committee, this intrepid lad had followed
      her, continuing to say "Sixpence, please, my lady," till
      one of the party, in order to save brawling in a public
      place, had produced the insignificant sum. And if Lucia
      tried to get in without paying, on the ground that she and
      Pepino had given the stocks to the Parish Council, which
      had lent them to the Museum, she would find her mistake. At
      length, in the effort to calculate what would be the total
      receipts of the year if a hundred and twenty-six people per
      week paid their shillings, Daisy lapsed into an uneasy
      arithmetical slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning (Saturday), the mystery of that arrival at The
      Hurst the evening before grew infinitely more intense. It
      was believed that only one person had come, and yet there
      was no doubt that several pounds of salmon, dozens
      ("Literally dozens," said Mrs. Boucher, "for I saw the
      basket") of eggs, two chickens, a leg of lamb, as well as
      countless other provisions unidentified were delivered at
      the back door of The Hurst; a positive frieze of
      tradesmen's boys was strung across the Green. Even if the
      mysterious arrival was Lucia herself, she could not, unless
      the whirl and worldliness of her London life had strangely
      increased her appetite, eat all that before Monday. And
      besides, why had she not rung up Georgie, or somebody, or
      opened her bedroom window on this hot morning? Or could it
      be Pepino again, sent down here for a rest-cure and a
      stuffing of his emaciated frame? But then he would not have
      come down without some sort of attendant to look after him.
      . . . Riseholme was completely baffled; never had its
      powers of inductive reasoning been so nonplussed, for
      though so much went into The Hurst, nobody but the
      tradesmen's boys with empty baskets came out. Georgie and
      Daisy stared at each other in blankness over the garden
      paling, and when, in despair of arriving at any solution,
      they sought the oracles of Abfou, he would give them
      nothing but hesitating Arabic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which shows," said Daisy, as she put the planchette away
      in disgust, "that even he doesn't know, or doesn't wish to
      tell us." Lunch time arrived, and there were very poor
      appetites in Riseholme (with the exception of that
      Gargantuan of whom nothing was known). But as for going to
      The Hurst and ringing the bell and asking if Mrs. Lucas was
      at home all Riseholme would sooner have died lingering and
      painful deaths, rather than let Lucia know that they took
      the smallest interest in anything she had done, was doing
      or would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o'clock Georgie was sitting on the Green
      opposite his house, finishing his sketch, which the affairs
      of the Museum had caused him sadly to neglect. He had got
      it upside down on his easel and was washing some more blue
      into the sky, when he heard the hoot of a motor. He just
      looked up, and what he saw caused his hand to twitch so
      violently that he put a large dab of cobalt on the middle
      of his red-brick house. For the motor had stopped at The
      Hurst, not a hundred yards away, and out of it got Lucia
      and Pepino. She gave some orders to her chauffeur, and then
      without noticing him (<i>perhaps</i> without seeing him)
      she followed Pepino into the house. Hardly waiting to wash
      the worst of the cobalt off his house, Georgie hurried into
      Daisy's, and told her exactly what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Daisy, and out they came again, and stood in the
      shadow of her mulberry tree to see what would happen next.
      The mulberry tree had recovered from the pruning of its
      roots (so it wasn't it which Abfou had said was dead), and
      gave them good shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing happened next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's impossible," said Daisy, speaking in a sort of
      conspiratorial whisper. "It's queer enough her coming
      without telling any of us, but now she's here, she surely
      must ring somebody up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was thinking intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next thing that will happen," he said, "will be that
      servants and luggage will arrive from the station. They'll
      be here any minute; I heard the 3.20 whistle just now. She
      and Pepino have driven down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't wonder," said Daisy. "But even now, what about
      the chickens and all those eggs? Georgie, it must have been
      her cook who came last night--she and Pepino were dining
      out in London--and ordered all those provisions this
      morning. But there were enough to last them a week. And
      three pints of cream, so I've heard since, and enough ice
      for a skating rink and--"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Georgie had the flash of intuition that
      was for ever memorable. It soared above inductive
      reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's having a week-end party of some of her smart friends
      from London," he said slowly. "And she doesn't want any of
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy blinked at this amazing light. Then she cast one
      withering glance in the direction of The Hurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She!" she said. "And her shingles. And her seed-pearls!
      That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute afterwards the station cab arrived pyramidal with
      luggage. Four figures disembarked, three female and one
      male.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The major-domo," said Daisy, and without another word
      marched back into her house to ask Abfou about it all. He
      came through at once, and wrote 'Snob' all over the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason why Georgie should not finish his
      sketch, and he sat down again and began by taking out the
      rest of the misplaced cobalt. He felt so certain of the
      truth of his prophecy that he just let it alone to fulfil
      itself, and for the next hour he never worked with more
      absorbed attention. He knew that Daisy came out of her
      house, walking very fast, and he supposed she was on her
      way to spread the news and forecast the sequel. But beyond
      the fact that he was perfectly sure that a party from
      London was coming down for the week-end, he could form no
      idea of what would be the result of that. It might be that
      Lucia would ask him or Daisy, or some of her old friends to
      dine, but if she had intended to do that she would probably
      have done it already. The only alternative seemed to be
      that she meant to ignore Riseholme altogether. But shortly
      before the arrival of the fast train from London at 4.30,
      his prophetical calm began (for he was but human) to be
      violently agitated, and he took his tea in the window of
      his drawing-room, which commanded a good view of the front
      garden of The Hurst, and put his opera-glasses ready to
      hand. The window was a big bow, and, he distinctly saw the
      end of Robert's brass telescope projecting from the
      corresponding window next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more a motor-horn sounded, and the Lucas's car drew up
      at the gate of The Hurst. There stepped out Mrs.
      Garroby-Ashton, followed by the weird bright thing which
      had called to take Lucia to the private view of the
      Post-Cubists. Georgie had not time for the moment to rack
      his brain as to the name he had forgotten, for observation
      was his primary concern, and next he saw Lord Limpsfield,
      whom he had met at Olga's party. Finally there emerged a
      tall, slim, middle-aged man in Oxford trousers, for whom
      Georgie instantly conceived a deep distrust. He had thick
      auburn hair, for he wore no hat, and he waved his hands
      about in a silly manner as he talked. Over his shoulder was
      a little cape. Then Lucia came tripping out of the house
      with her short skirts and her shingles, and they all
      chattered together, and kissed and squealed, and pointed in
      different directions, and moved up the garden into the
      house. The door was shut, and the end of Robert's brass
      telescope withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had these shameful events occurred when Georgie's
      telephone bell rang. It might be Daisy wanting to compare
      notes, but it might be Lucia asking him to tea. He felt
      torn in half at the idea: carnal curiosity urged him with
      clamour to go, dignity dissuaded him. Still halting between
      two opinions, he went towards the instrument, which
      continued ringing. He felt sure now that it was Lucia, and
      what on earth was he to say? He stood there so long that
      Foljambe came hurrying into the room, in case he had gone
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See who it is, Foljambe," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe with amazing calm took off the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trunk call," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glued himself to the instrument, and soon there came a
      voice he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Is it you?" he asked. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm motoring down to-morrow morning," said Olga, and
      Princess Isabel is probably coming with me, though she is
      not absolutely certain. But expect her, unless I telephone
      to-morrow. Be a darling and give us lunch, as we shall be
      late, and come and dine. Terrible hurry: good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you must wait a minute," screamed Georgie. "Of course
      I'll do that, but I must tell you, Lucia's just come with a
      party from London and hasn't asked any of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Olga. "Then don't tell her I'm coming. She's
      become such a bore. She asks me to lunch and dinner every
      day. How thrilling though, Georgie! Whom has she got?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the name of the weird bright female came back to
      Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Alingsby," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lor!" said Olga. "Who else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Garroby-Ashton--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Garr-o-by Ash-ton," said Georgie very distinctly; "and
      Lord Limpsfield. And a tall man in Oxford trousers with
      auburn hair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds like your double, Georgie," said Olga. "And a
      little cape like yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Georgie rather coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it must be Stephen Merriall," said Olga after a
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who's that?" asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia's lover," said Olga quite distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he isn't. I only meant he was always there. But
      I believe he's Hermione. I'm not sure, but I think so.
      Georgie, we shall have a hectic Sunday. Good-bye, to-morrow
      about two or three for lunch, and two or three <i>for</i>
      lunch. What a gossip you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard that delicious laugh, and the click of her
      receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was far too thrilled to gasp. He sat quite quiet,
      breathing gently. For the honour of Riseholme he was glad
      that a Princess was perhaps coming tolunch with him, but
      apart from that he would really have much preferred that
      Olga should be alone. The 'affaire Lucia' was so much more
      thrilling than anything else, but Princess Isabel might
      feel no interest in it, and instead they would talk about
      all sorts of dull things like kings and courts. . . . Then
      suddenly he sprang from his chair: there was a leg of lamb
      for Sunday lunch, and an apple tart, and nothing else at
      all. What was to be done? The shops by now would be shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang for Foljambe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Olga's coming to lunch and possibly--possibly a
      friend of hers," he said. "What are we to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A leg of lamb and an apple tart's good enough for anybody,
      isn't it?" said Foljambe severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      This really seemed true as soon as it was pointed out, and
      Georgie made an effort to dismiss the matter from his mind.
      But he could not stop still: it was all so exciting, and
      after having changed his Oxford trousers in order to
      minimise the likeness between him and that odious Mr.
      Merriall, he went out for a constitutional, round the Green
      from all points of which he could see any important
      development at The Hurst. Riseholme generally was doing the
      same, and his stroll was interrupted by many agreeable
      stoppages. It was already known that Lucia and Pepino had
      arrived, and that servants and luggage had come by the
      3.20, and that Lucia's motor had met the 4.30 and returned
      laden with exciting people. Georgie therefore was in high
      demand, for he might supply the names of the exciting
      people, and he had the further information to divulge that
      Olga was arriving to-morrow, and was lunching with him and
      dining at her own house. He said nothing about a possible
      Princess: she might not come, and in that case he knew that
      there would be a faint suspicion in everybody's mind that
      he had invented it; whereas if she did, she would no doubt
      sign his visitors' book for everyone to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling ran stormy high against Lucia, and as usual when
      Riseholme felt a thing deeply there was little said by way
      of public comment, though couples might have been observed
      with set and angry faces and gabbling mouths. But higher
      yet ran curiosity and surmise as to what Lucia would do,
      and what Olga would do. Not a sign had come for anyone from
      The Hurst, not a soul had been asked to lunch, dinner, or
      even tea, and if Lucia seemed to be ashamed of Riseholme
      society before her grand friends, there was no doubt that
      Riseholme society was ashamed of Lucia. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly a deadly hush fell on these discussions,
      and even those who were walking fastest in their
      indignation came to a halt, for out of the front door of
      The Hurst streamed the 'exciting people' and their hosts.
      There was Lucia, hatless and shingled and short-skirted,
      and the Bird-of-Paradise and Mrs. Garroby-Ashton, and
      Pepino and Lord Limpsfield and Mr. Merriall all talking
      shrilly together, with shrieks of hollow laughter. They
      came slowly across the Green towards the little pond round
      which Riseholme stood, and passed within fifty yards of it,
      and if Lucia had been the Gorgon, Riseholme could not more
      effectually have been turned into stone. She too, appeared
      not to notice them, so absorbed was she in conversation,
      and on they went straight towards the Museum. Just as they
      passed Colonel Boucher's house, Mrs. Boucher came out in
      her bath-chair, and without pause was wheeled straight
      through the middle of them. She then drew up by the side of
      the Green below the large elm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party passed into the Museum. The windows were open,
      and from inside them came shrieks of laughter. This
      continued for about ten minutes, and then . . . they all
      came out again. Several of them carried catalogues, and Mr.
      Merriall was reading out of one in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pair of worsted mittens," he announced, "belonging to
      Queen Charlotte, and presented by the Lady Ambermere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't," said Lucia. "Don't make fun of our dear little
      Museum, Stephen."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they retraced their way along the edge of the green,
      movement came back to Riseholme again. Lucia's policy with
      regard to the Museum had declared itself. Georgie strolled
      up to Mrs. Boucher's bath-chair. Mrs. Boucher was extremely
      red in the face, and her hands were trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, Mr. Georgie," said she. "Another party of
      strangers, I see, visiting the Museum. They looked very odd
      people, and I hope we shan't find anything missing. Any
      news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a very dignified way of taking it, and Georgie
      responded in the same spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a scrap that I know of," he said, "except that Olga's
      coming down to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be nice," said Mrs. Boucher. "Riseholme is
      always glad to see <i>her."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, Mrs. Quantock," said Mrs. Boucher. "Any
      news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," said Daisy rather breathlessly. "Didn't you
      see them? Lucia and her party?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mrs. Boucher firmly. "She is in London surely.
      Anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy took the cue. Complete ignorance that Lucia was in
      Riseholme at all was a noble man&oelig;uvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must have been my mistake," she said. "Oh, my mulberry
      tree has quite come round."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Mrs. Boucher in the Riseholme voice. "I am
      pleased. I daresay the pruning did it good. And Mr.
      Georgie's just told me that our dear Olga, or I should say
      Mrs. Shuttleworth, is coming down to-morrow, but he hasn't
      told me what time yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two or three, she said," answered Georgie. "She's motoring
      down, and is going to have lunch with me whenever she gets
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Then I should advise you to have something cold
      that won't spoil by waiting. A bit of cold lamb, for
      instance. Nothing so good on a hot day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an excellent idea!" said Georgie. "I was thinking of
      hot lamb. But the other's much better. I'll have it cooked
      to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a nice tomato salad," said Mrs. Boucher, "and if you
      haven't got any, I can give you some. Send your Foljambe
      round, and she'll come back with half a dozen ripe
      tomatoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie hurried off to see to these new arrangements, and
      Colonel Boucher having strolled away with Piggie, his wife
      could talk freely to Mrs. Quantock. . . . She did.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia waking rather early next morning found she had rather
      an uneasy conscience as her bedfellow, and she used what
      seemed very reasonable arguments to quiet it. There would
      have been no point in writing to Georgie or any of them to
      say that she was bringing down some friends for the
      week-end and would be occupied with them all Sunday. She
      could not with all these guests play duets with Georgie, or
      get poor Daisy to give an exhibition of ouija, or have Mrs.
      Boucher in her bath-chair to tea, for she would give them
      all long histories of purely local interest, which could
      not conceivably amuse people like Lord Limpsfield or weird
      Sophy. She had been quite wise to keep Riseholme and
      Brompton Square apart, for they would not mix. Besides, her
      guests would go away on Monday morning, and she had
      determined to stop over till Tuesday and be extremely kind,
      and not the least condescending. She would have one or two
      of them to lunch, and one or two more to dinner, and give
      Georgie a full hour of duets as well. Naturally, if Olga
      had been here, she would have asked Olga on Sunday but Olga
      had been singing last night at the opera. Lucia had talked
      a good deal about her at dinner, and given the impression
      that they were never out of each other's houses either in
      town or here, and had lamented her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a pity," she had said. "For dearest Olga loves
      singing in my music-room. I shall never forget how she
      dropped in for some little garden-party and sang the
      awakening of Brunnhilde. Even you, dear Sophy, with your
      passion for the primitive, would have enjoyed that. She
      sang 'Lucrezia' here, too, before anyone had heard it.
      Cortese brought the score down the moment he had finished
      it--ah, I think that was in her house--there was just
      Pepino and me, and perhaps one or two others. We would have
      had dearest Olga here all day to-morrow if only she had
      been here. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Lucia felt fairly easy, having planned these treats for
      Riseholme on Monday, as to her aloofness to-day, and then
      her conscience brought up the question of the Museum. Here
      she stoutly defended herself: she knew nothing about the
      Museum (except what Pepino had seen through the window a
      few Sundays before); she had not been consulted about the
      Museum, she was not on the committee, and it was perfectly
      proper for her to take her party to see it. She could not
      prevent them bursting into shrieks of laughter at Queen
      Charlotte's mittens and Daisy's drain-pipes, nor could she
      possibly prevent herself from joining in those shrieks of
      laughter herself, for surely this was the most ridiculous
      collection of rubbish ever brought together. A glass case
      for Queen Charlotte's mittens, a heap of fossils such as
      she had chipped out by the score from the old quarry, some
      fragments of glass (Georgie ought to have known better),
      some quilts, a dozen coins, lent, only lent, by poor Daisy!
      In fact the only object of the slightest interest was the
      pair of stocks which she and Pepino had bought and set up
      on the village green. She would see about that when she
      came down in August, and back they should go on to the
      village green. Then there was the catalogue: who could help
      laughing at the catalogue which described in most pompous
      language the contents of this dustbin? There was nothing to
      be uneasy about over that. And as for Mrs. Boucher having
      driven right through her party without a glance of
      recognition, what did that matter? On her own side also,
      Lucia had given no glance of recognition to Mrs. Boucher:
      if she had, Mrs. Boucher would have told them all about her
      asparagus or how her Elizabeth had broken a plate. It was
      odd, perhaps, that Mrs. Boucher hadn't stopped . . . and
      was it rather odd also that, though from the corner of her
      eye she had seen all Riseholme standing about on the Green,
      no one had made the smallest sign of welcome? It was true
      that she had practically cut them (if a process conducted
      at the distance of fifty yards can be called a cut), but
      she was not quite sure that she enjoyed the same process
      herself. Probably it meant nothing; they saw she was
      engaged with her friends, and very properly had not thrust
      themselves forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her guests mostly breakfasted upstairs, but by the middle
      of the morning they had all straggled down. Lucia had
      brought with her yesterday her portrait by Sigismund, which
      Sophy declared was a masterpiece of <i>adagio.</i> She was
      advising her to clear all other pictures out of the
      music-room and hang it there alone, like a wonderful slow
      movement, when Mr. Merriall came in with the Sunday paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, the paper has come," said Lucia. "Is not that
      Riseholmish of us? We never get the Sunday paper till
      midday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better late than never," said Mr. Merriall, who was rather
      addicted to quoting proverbial sayings. "I see that Mrs.
      Shuttleworth's coming down here to-day. Do ask her to dine
      and perhaps she'll sing to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia paused for a single second, then clapped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what fun that would be!" she said. "But I don't think
      it can be true. Dearest Olga popped in--or did I pop
      in--yesterday morning in town, and she said nothing about
      it. No doubt she had not made up her mind then whether she
      was coming or not. Of course I'll ring her up at once and
      scold her for not telling me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia found from Olga's caretaker that she and a friend
      were expected, but she knew they couldn't come to lunch
      with her, as they were lunching with Mr. Pillson. She
      'couldn't say, I'm sure' who the friend was, but promised
      to give the message that Mrs. Lucas hoped they would both
      come and dine. . . . The next thing was to ring up Georgie
      and be wonderfully cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgino mio, is it 'oo?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Georgie. He did not have to ask who it was, nor
      did he feel inclined for baby-talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgino, I never caught a glimpse of you yesterday," she
      said. "Why didn't 'oo come round and see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you never asked me," said Georgie firmly, "and
      because you never told me you were coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me so sorry," said Lucia. "But me was so fussed and busy
      in town. Delicious to be in Riseholme again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delicious," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Georgino cross with me?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit," said Georgie brightly. "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know. And I hear my Olga and a friend are
      lunching with you. I am hoping they will come and dine with
      me to-night. And do come in afterwards. We shall be eight
      already, or of course I should ask you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks so much, but I'm dining with her," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, all of you come and dine here," said Lucia. "Such
      amusing people, and I'll squeeze you in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I can't accept for Olga," said Georgie. "And
      I'm dining with her, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, will you come across after lunch and bring them?"
      said Lucia. "Or tea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what they will feel inclined to do," said
      Georgie. "But I'll tell them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do, and I'll ring up at lunch-time again, and have ickle
      talk to my Olga. Who is her friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie hesitated: he thought he would not give that away
      just yet. Lucia would know in heaps of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just somebody whom she's possibly bringing down," he
      said, and rang off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia began to suspect a slight mystery, and she disliked
      mysteries, except when she made them herself. Olga's
      caretaker was 'sure she couldn't say,' and Georgie (Lucia
      was sure) wouldn't. So she went back to her guests, and
      very prudently said that Olga had not arrived at present,
      and then gave them a wonderful account of her little
      <i>intime</i> dinner with Olga and Princess Isabel. Such a
      delightful amusing woman: they must all come and meet
      Princess Isabel some day soon in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia and her guests, with the exception of Sophy Alingsby
      who continued to play primitive tunes with one finger on
      the piano, went for a stroll on the Green before lunch.
      Mrs. Quantock hurried by with averted face, and naturally
      everybody wanted to know how the Red Queen from Alice in
      Wonderland was. Lucia amused them by a bright version of
      poor Daisy's ouija-board and the story of the mulberry
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such dears they all are," she said. "But too killing. And
      then she planted broccoli instead of phlox. It's only in
      Riseholme that such things happen. You must all come and
      stay with me in August, and we'll enter into the life of
      the place. I adore it, simply adore it. We are always
      wildly excited about something. . . . And next door is
      Georgie Pillson's house. A lamb! I'm devoted to him. He
      does embroidery, and gave those broken bits of glass to the
      Museum. And that's dear Olga's house at the end of the
      road. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Lucia was kissing her hand to Olga's house, her
      eagle eye had seen a motor approaching, and it drew up at
      Georgie's house. Two women got out, and there was no doubt
      whatever who either of them were. They went in at the gate,
      and he came out of his front door like the cuckoo out of a
      clock and made a low bow. All this Lucia saw, and though
      for the moment petrified, she quickly recovered, and turned
      sharply round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we must be getting home again," she said, in a
      rather strangled voice. "It is lunch-time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merriall did not turn so quickly, but watched the three
      figures at Georgie's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Appearances are deceptive," he said. "But isn't that Olga
      Shuttleworth and Princess Isabel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Where?" said Lucia looking in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just gone into that house; Georgie Pillson's, didn't you
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, really?" said Lucia. "How stupid of me not to have
      seen them. Shall I pop in now? No, I think I will ring them
      up presently, unless we find that they have already rung me
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was putting a brave face on it, but she was far from
      easy. It looked like a plot: it did indeed, for Olga had
      never told her she was coming to Riseholme, and Georgie had
      never told her that Princess Isabel was the friend she was
      bringing with her. However, there was lunch-time in which
      to think over what was to be done. But though she talked
      incessantly and rather satirically about Riseholme, she
      said no more about the prima donna and the princess. . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia might have been gratified (or again she might not) if
      she had known how vivacious a subject of conversation she
      afforded at Georgie's select little luncheon party.
      Princess Isabel (with her mouth now full of Mrs. Boucher's
      tomatoes) had been subjected during this last week to an
      incessant bombardment from Lucia, and had heard on quite
      good authority that she alluded to her as "Isabel, dear
      Princess Isabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I will not go to her house," she said. "It is a free
      country, and I do not choose to go to her kind house. No
      doubt she is a very good woman. But I want to hear more of
      her, for she thrills me. So does your Riseholme. You were
      talking of the Museum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, go on about the Museum," said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Georgie, "there it was. They all went in, and
      then they all came out again, and one of them was reading
      my catalogue--I made it--aloud, and they all screamed with
      laughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I daresay it was a very funny catalogue, Georgie,"
      said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so. Mr. Merriall read out about Queen
      Charlotte's mittens presented by Lady Ambermere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most interesting!" said the Princess. "She was my aunt,
      big aunt, is it? No, great-aunt--that is it. Afterwards we
      will go to the Museum and see her mittens. Also, I must see
      the lady who kills mulberry trees. Olga, can't you ask her
      to bring her planchette and prophesy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, ring up Daisy, and ask her to come to tea with
      me," said Olga. "We must have a weedj."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I must go for a drive, and I must walk on the Green,
      and I must have some more delicious apple pie," began the
      Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had just risen to ring up Daisy, when Foljambe
      entered with the news that Mrs. Lucas was on the telephone
      and would like to speak to Olga.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, say we're still at lunch, please, Foljambe," said she.
      "Can she send a message? And you say Stephen Merriall is
      there, Georgie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you said he was there," said Georgie. "I only
      described him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm pretty sure it is he, but you will have to go
      sometime this afternoon and find out. If it is, he's
      Hermione, who's always writing about Lucia in the
      <i>Evening Gazette.</i> Priceless! So you must go across
      for a few minutes, Georgie, and make certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe came back to ask if Mrs. Lucas might pop in to pay
      her respects to Princess Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So kind of her, but she must not dream of troubling
      herself," said the Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foljambe retired and appeared for the third time with a
      faint, firm smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Lucas will ring up Mrs. Shuttleworth in a quarter of
      an hour," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess finished her apple-tart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now let us go and see the Museum," she said.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie remained behind to ring up Daisy, to explain when
      Lucia telephoned next that Olga had gone out, and to pay
      his visit to The Hurst. To pretend that he did not enjoy
      that, would be to misunderstand him altogether. Lucia had
      come down here with her smart party and had taken no notice
      of Riseholme, and now two people a million times smarter
      had by a clearly providential dealing come down at the same
      time and were taking no notice of her. Instead they were
      hobnobbing with people like himself and Daisy whom Lucia
      had slighted. Then she had laughed at the Museum, and
      especially at the catalogue and the mittens, and now the
      great-niece of the owner of the mittens had gone to see
      them. That was a stinger, in fact it was all a stinger, and
      well Lucia deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shown into the music-room, and he had just time to
      observe that there was a printed envelope on the
      writing-table addressed to the <i>Evening Gazette,</i> when
      Lucia and Mr. Merriall came hurrying in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgino mio," said Lucia effusively. "How nice of you to
      come in. But you've not brought your ladies? Oh, this is
      Mr. Merriall."
    </p>
    <p>
      (Hermione, of the <i>Evening Gazette,</i> it's proved,
      thought Georgie.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "They thought they wouldn't add to your big party," said
      Georgie sumptuously. (That was another stinger).
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was it Princess Isabel I saw at your door?" asked Mr.
      Merriall with an involuntary glance at the writing-table.
      (Lucia had not mentioned her since.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes. They just motored down and took pot-luck with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you give them?" asked Lucia, forgetting her
      anxieties for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just cold lamb and apple tart," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Lucia. "You ought to have brought them to lunch
      here. O Georgie, my picture, look. By Sigismund."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes," said Georgie. "What's it of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Cattivo!"</i> said Lucia. "Why, it's a portrait of me.
      Sigismund, you know, he's the great rage in London just
      now. Everyone is crazy to be painted by him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they look crazy when they are. It's a mad world, my
      masters," said Mr. Merriall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naughty," said Lucia. "Is it not wonderful, Georgie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I expect it's very clever," said Georgie. "Very
      clever indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should so like to show it dearest Olga," said Lucia,
      "and I'm sure the Princess would be interested in it. She
      was talking about modern art the other day when I dined
      with Olga. I wonder if they would look in at tea-time, or
      indeed any other time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very likely, I'm afraid," said Georgie, "for Daisy
      Quantock's coming to tea, I know. We're going to weedj. And
      they're going out for a drive sometime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where are they now?" asked Lucia. It was terrible to
      have to get news of her intimate friends from Georgie, but
      how else was she to find out?
    </p>
    <p>
      "They went across to see the Museum," said he. "They were
      most interested in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merriall waved his hands, just in the same way as
      Georgie did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that Museum!" he said. "Those mittens! Shall I ever
      get over those mittens? Lucia said she would give it the
      next shoe-lace she broke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Georgie. "The Princess wanted to see those
      mittens. Queen Charlotte was her great-aunt. I told them
      how amused you all were at the mittens."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had been pressing her finger to her forehead, a sign
      of concentration. She rose as if going back to her other
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coming into the garden presently?" she asked, and glided
      from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so you're going to have a sitting with the
      ouija-board," said Mr. Merriall. "I am intensely interested
      in ouija. Very odd phenomena certainly occur. Strange but
      true."
    </p>
    <p>
      A fresh idea had come into Georgie's head. Lucia certainly
      had not appeared outside the window that looked into the
      garden, and so he walked across to the other one which
      commanded a view of the Green. There she was heading
      straight for the Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is marvellous," he said to Mr. Merriall. "We have had
      some curious results here, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merriall was moving daintily about the room, and
      Georgie wondered if it would be possible to convert Oxford
      trousers into an ordinary pair. It was dreadful to think
      that Olga, even in fun, had suggested that such a man was
      his double. There was the little cape as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have quite fallen in love with your Riseholme," said Mr.
      Merriall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all adore it," said Georgie, not attending very much
      because his whole mind was fixed on the progress of Lucia
      across the Green. Would she catch them in the Museum, or
      had they already gone? Smaller and smaller grew her figure
      and her twinkling legs, and at last she crossed the road
      and vanished behind the belt of shrubs in front of the
      tithe-barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All so homey and intimate. 'Home, Sweet Home,' in fact,"
      said Mr. Merriall. "We have been hearing how Mrs.
      Shuttleworth loves singing in this room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was instantly on his guard again. It was quite
      right and proper that Lucia should be punished, and of
      course Riseholme would know all about it, for indeed
      Riseholme was administering the punishment. But it was a
      very different thing to let her down before those who were
      not Riseholme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, she sings here constantly," he said. "We are all
      in and out of each other's houses. But I must be getting
      back to mine now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merriall longed to be asked to this little ouija party
      at Olga's, and at present his hostess had been quite
      unsuccessful in capturing either of the two great stars.
      There was no harm in trying. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "You couldn't perhaps take me to Mrs. Shuttleworth's for
      tea?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm afraid I could hardly do that," said Georgie.
      "Good-bye. I hope we shall meet again."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Nemesis meantime had been dogging Lucia's footsteps, with
      more success than Lucia was having in dogging Olga's. She
      had arrived, as Georgie had seen, at the Museum, and again
      paid a shilling to enter that despised exhibition. It was
      rather full, for visitors who had lunched at the Ambermere
      Arms had come in, and there was quite a crowd round Queen
      Charlotte's mittens, among whom was Lady Ambermere herself
      who had driven over from the Hall with two depressed guests
      whom she had forced to come with her. She put up her
      glasses and stared at Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Mrs. Lucas!" she said with the singular directness for
      which she was famous. "For the moment I did not recognise
      you with your hair like that. It is a fashion that does not
      commend itself to me. You have come in, of course, to look
      at Her late Majesty's mittens, for really there is very
      little else to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, Lucia shamelessly truckled to Lady Ambermere,
      and schemed to get her to lunch or dinner. But today she
      didn't care two straws about her, and while these rather
      severe remarks were being addressed to her, her eyes darted
      eagerly round the room in search of those for whom she
      would have dropped Lady Ambermere without the smallest
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear Lady Ambermere," she said. "So interesting to
      think that Queen Charlotte wore them. Most good of you to
      have presented them to our little Museum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lent," said Lady Ambermere. "They are heirlooms in my
      family. But I am glad to let others enjoy the sight of
      them. And by a remarkable coincidence I have just had the
      privilege of showing them to a relative of their late
      owner. Princess Isabel. I offered to have the case opened
      for her, and let her try them on. She said, most
      graciously, that it was not necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear Princess Isabel," said Lucia, "I heard she had
      come down. Is she here still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. She and Mrs. Shuttleworth have just gone. A motor
      drive, I understand, before tea. I suggested, of course, a
      visit to the Hall, where I would have been delighted to
      entertain them. Where did they lunch?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Georgie Pillsons," said Lucia bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed. I wonder why Mr. Pillson did not let me know. Did
      you lunch there too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I have a party in my own house. Some friends from
      London, Lord Limpsfield, Mrs. Garroby-Ashton--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said Lady Ambermere. "I had meant to return to
      the Hall for tea, but I will change my plans and have a cup
      of tea with you, Mrs. Lucas. Perhaps you would ask Mrs.
      Shuttleworth and her distinguished guest to drop in. I will
      present you to her. You have a pretty little garden, I
      remember. Quaint. You are at liberty to say that I am
      taking tea with you. But stay! If they have gone out for a
      drive, they will not be back quite yet. It does not matter:
      we will sit in your garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in the ordinary way this would have been a most
      honourable event, but to-day, though Lady Ambermere had not
      changed, her value had. If only Olga had not come down
      bringing her whom Lucia could almost refer to as that
      infernal Princess, it would have been rich, it would have
      been glorious, to have Lady Ambermere dropping in to tea.
      Even now she would be better than nothing, thought Lucia,
      and after inspecting the visitors' book of the Museum,
      where Olga and the Princess had inscribed their names, and
      where now Lady Ambermere wrote hers, very close to the last
      one, so as to convey the impression that they were one
      party, they left the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside was drawn up Lady Ambermere's car, with her
      companion, the meek Miss Lyall, sitting on the front seat
      nursing Lady Ambermere's stertorous pug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see," said she. "How had we best arrange? A walk
      would be good for Pug before he has his tea. Pug takes
      lukewarm milk with a biscuit broken up into it. Please put
      Pug on his leash, Miss Lyall, and we will all walk across
      the Green to Mrs. Lucas's little house. The motor shall go
      round by the road and wait for us there. That is Mrs.
      Shuttleworth's little house, is it not? So you might kindly
      step in there, Mrs. Lucas, and leave a message for them
      about tea, stating that I shall be there. We will walk
      slowly and you will soon catch us up."
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech was thoroughly Ambermerian: everybody in
      Riseholme had a 'little house' compared with the Hall:
      everybody had a 'little garden.' Equally Ambermerian was
      her complete confidence that her wish was everybody else's
      pleasure, and Lucia dismally reflected that she, for her
      part, had never failed to indicate that it was. But just
      now, though Lady Ambermere was so conspicuously
      second-best, and though she was like a small luggage-engine
      with a Roman nose and a fat dog, the wretched Lucia badly
      wanted somebody to 'drop in,' and by so doing give her some
      sort of status--alas, that one so lately the Queen of
      Riseholme should desire it--in the sight of her guests. She
      could say what a bore Lady Ambermere was the moment she had
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wretched also was her errand: she knew that Olga and the
      infernal Princess were to have a ouija with Daisy and
      Georgie, and that her invitation would be futile, and as
      for that foolish old woman's suggestion that her presence
      at The Hurst would prove an attraction to Olga, she was
      aware that if anything was needful to make Olga refuse to
      come, it would be that Lady Ambermere was there. Olga had
      dined at The Hall once, and had been induced to sing, while
      her hostess played Patience and talked to Pug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had a thought: not a very bright one, but
      comparatively so. She might write her name in the
      Princess's book: that would be something. So, when her ring
      was answered, and she ascertained, as she already knew,
      that Olga was out, and left the hopeless invitation that
      she and her guest would come to tea, where they would meet
      Lady Ambermere, she asked for the Princess's book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olga's parlourmaid looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would that be the book of cross-word puzzles, ma'am?" she
      asked. "I don't think her Highness brought any other book,
      and that she's taken with her for her drive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia trudged sadly away. Halfway across the Green she saw
      Georgie and Daisy Quantock with a large sort of
      drawing-board under her arm coming briskly in her
      direction. She knew where they were going, and she pulled
      her shattered forces together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest Daisy, not set eyes on you!" she said. "A few
      friends from London, how it ties one! But I shall pop in
      to-morrow, for I stop till Tuesday. Going to have a ouija
      party with dear Piggie and Goosie? Wish I could come, but
      Lady Ambermere has quartered herself on me for tea, and I
      must run on and catch her up. Just been to your delicious
      Museum. Wonderful mittens! Wonderful everything. Pepino and
      I will look out something for it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very kind," said Daisy. It was as if the North Pole had
      spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pug and Miss Lyall and Lady Ambermere and her two depressed
      guests had been admitted to The Hurst before Lucia caught
      them up, and she found them all seated stonily in the
      music-room, where Stephen Merriall had been finishing his
      official correspondence. Well Lucia knew what he had been
      writing about: there might perhaps be a line or two about
      The Hurst, and the party week-ending there, but that, she
      was afraid, would form a mere little postscript to more
      exalted paragraphs. She hastily introduced him to Lady
      Ambermere and Miss Lyall, but she had no idea who Lady
      Ambermere's guests were, and suspected they were poor
      relations, for Lady Ambermere introduced them to nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pug gave a series of wheezy barks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clever little man," said Lady Ambermere. "He is asking for
      his tea. He barks four times like that for his tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he shall have it," said Lucia. "Where are the others,
      Stephen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merriall exerted himself a little on hearing Lady
      Ambermere's name: he would put in a sentence about her. . .
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Limpsfield and Mrs. Garroby-Ashton have gone to play
      golf," he said. "Barbarously energetic of them, is it not,
      Lady Ambermere? What a sweet little dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pug does not like strangers," said Lady Ambermere. "And I
      am disappointed not to see Lord Limpsfield. Do we expect
      Mrs. Shuttleworth and the Princess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left the message," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ambermere's eyes finished looking at Mr. Merriall and
      proceeded slowly round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that curious picture?" she said. "I am completely
      puzzled."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave her bright laugh: it was being an awful
      afternoon, but she had to keep her flag flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Striking, is it not?" she said. "Dear Benjy Sigismund
      insisted on painting me. Such a lot of sittings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ambermere looked from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not see any resemblance," she said. "It appears to me
      to resemble nothing. Ah, here is tea. A little lukewarm
      milk for Pug, Miss Lyall. Mix a little hot water with it,
      it does not suit him to have it quite cold. And I should
      like to see Mr. Georgie Pillson. No doubt he could be told
      that I am here."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was really rather desperate: Lucia could not produce
      Olga or the Princess, or Lord Limpsfield or Mrs.
      Garroby-Ashton for Lady Ambermere, and she knew she could
      not produce Georgie, for by that time he would be at
      Olga's. All that was left for her was to be able to tell
      Lord Limpsfield and Mrs. Garroby-Ashton when they returned
      that they had missed Lady Ambermere. As for Riseholme . . .
      but it was better not to think how she stood with regard to
      Riseholme, which, yesterday, she had settled to be of no
      account at all. If only, before coming down, she had asked
      them all to lunch and tea and dinner. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      The message came back that Mr. Pillson had gone to tea with
      Mrs. Shuttleworth. Five minutes later came regrets from
      Olga that she had friends with her, and could not come to
      tea. Lady Ambermere ate seed cake in silence. Mrs. Alingsby
      meantime had been spending the afternoon in her bedroom,
      and she now appeared in a chintz wrapper and morocco
      slippers. Her hair fell over her eyes like that of an
      Aberdeen terrier, and she gave a shrill scream when she saw
      Pug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't bear dogs," she said. "Take that dog away, dear
      Lucia. Burn it, drown it! You told me you hadn't got any
      dogs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ambermere turned on her a face that should have
      instantly petrified her, if she had had any proper feeling.
      Never had Pug been so blasphemed. She rose as she swallowed
      the last mouthful of seed cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are inconveniencing your guests, Mrs. Lucas," she said.
      "Pug and I will be off. Miss Lyall, Pug's leash. We must be
      getting back to the Hall. I shall look in at Mrs.
      Shuttleworth's, and sign my name in the Princess's book.
      Good-bye, Mrs. Lucas. Thank you for my tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointedly ignored Mrs. Alingsby, and headed the gloomy
      frieze that defiled through the door. The sole bright spot
      was that she would find only a book of cross-word puzzles
      to write her name in.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's guests went off by the early train next morning and
      she was left, like Marius among the ruins of Carthage. But,
      unlike that weak-hearted senator, she had no intention of
      mourning: her first function was to rebuild, and presently
      she became aware that the work of rebuilding had to begin
      from its very foundations. There was as background the fact
      that her week-end party had not been a triumphant success,
      for she had been speaking in London of Riseholme being such
      a queer dear old-fashioned little place, where everybody
      adored her, and where Olga kept incessantly running in to
      sing acts and acts of the most renowned operas in her
      music-room; she had also represented Princess Isabel as
      being a dear and intimate friend, and these two cronies of
      hers had politely but firmly refused all invitations to pop
      in. Lady Ambermere, it is true, had popped in, but nobody
      had seemed the least impressed with her, and Lucia had
      really been very glad when after Sophy's painful remarks
      about Pug, she had popped out, leaving that astonished
      post-cubist free to inquire who that crashing old hag was.
      Of course all this could be quickly lived down again when
      she got to London, but it certainly did require
      obliteration.
    </p>
    <p>
      What gave her more pause for thought was the effect that
      her week-end had produced on Riseholme. Lucia knew that all
      Riseholme knew that Olga and the Princess had lunched off
      cold lamb with Georgie, and had never been near The Hurst,
      and Riseholme, if she knew Riseholme at all, would have
      something to talk about there. Riseholme knew also that
      Lucia and her party had shrieked with laughter at the
      Museum, while the Princess had politely signed her name in
      the visitors-book after reverently viewing her great-aunt's
      mittens. But what else had been happening, whether Olga was
      here still, what Daisy and her ouija board had been up to,
      who had dined (if anyone except Georgie) at Olga's last
      night, Lucia was at present ignorant, and all that she had
      to find out, for she had a presentiment that nobody would
      pop in and tell her. Above all, what was Riseholme saying
      about her? How were they taking it all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had determined to devote this day to her old friends,
      and she rang up Daisy and asked her and Robert to lunch.
      Daisy regretted that she was engaged, and rang off with
      such precipitation that (so it was easy to guess) she
      dropped the receiver on the floor, said 'Drat,' and
      replaced it. Lucia then rang up Mrs. Boucher and asked her
      and the colonel to lunch. Mrs. Boucher with great emphasis
      said that she had got friends to lunch. Of course that
      might mean that Daisy Quantock was lunching there; indeed
      it seemed a very natural explanation, but somehow it was
      far from satisfying Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down to think, and the unwelcome result of thought
      was a faint suspicion that just as she had decided to
      ignore Riseholme while her smart party from London was with
      her, Riseholme was malignant enough to retaliate. It was
      very base, it was very childish, but there was that
      possibility. She resolved to put a playful face on it and
      rang up Georgie. From the extraordinary celerity with which
      he answered, she wondered whether he was expecting a call
      from her or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgino mio!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eagerness with which Georgie had said "Yes. Who is it?"
      seemed to die out of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's you, is it?" he said. "Good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was not discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me coming round to have good long chat," she said. "All my
      tiresome guests have gone, Georgie, and I'm staying till
      <i>domani.</i> So lovely to be here again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Si,</i>" said Georgie; "just '<i>si.</i>'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The faint suspicion became a shade more definite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coming at once then," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia set forth and emerging on to the Green, was in time
      to see Daisy Quantock hurry out of Georgie's house and bolt
      into her own like a plump little red-faced rabbit. Somehow
      that was slightly disconcerting: it required very little
      inductive reasoning to form the theory that Daisy had
      popped in to tell Georgie that Lucia had asked her to
      lunch, and that she had refused. Daisy must have been
      present also when Lucia rang Georgie up and instead of
      waiting to join in the good long chat had scuttled home
      again. A slight effort therefore was needed to keep herself
      up to the gay playful level and be quite unconscious that
      anything unpropitious could possibly have occurred. She
      found Georgie with his sewing in the little room which he
      called his study because he did his embroidery there. He
      seemed somehow to Lucia to be encased in a thin covering of
      ice, and she directed her full effulgence to the task of
      melting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that is nice!" she said. "And we'll have a good
      gossip. So lovely to be in Riseholme again. And isn't it
      naughty of me? I was almost glad when I saw the last of my
      guests off this morning, and promised myself a real
      Riseholme day. Such dears all of them, too, and
      tremendously in the movement; such arguments and
      discussions as we had! All day yesterday I was occupied,
      talks with one, strolls with another, and all the time I
      was longing to trot round and see you and Daisy and all the
      rest. Any news, Georgie? What did you do with yourself
      yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I was very busy too," said Georgie. "Quite a rush. I
      had two guests at lunch, and then I had tea at Olga's--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she here still?" asked Lucia. She did not intend to ask
      that, but she simply could not help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes. She's going to stop here two or three days, as she
      doesn't sing in London again till Thursday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia longed to ask if the Princess was remaining as well,
      but she had self control enough not to. Perhaps it would
      come out some other way. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Olga," said Lucia effusively. "I reckon her quite a
      Riseholmite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh quite," said Georgie, who was determined not to let his
      ice melt. "Yes: I had tea at Olga's, and we had the most
      wonderful weedj. Just she and the Princess and Daisy and
      I."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave her silvery peal of laughter. It sounded as if
      it had 'turned' a little in this hot weather, or got a
      little tarnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Daisy!" she said. "Is she not priceless? How she
      adores her conjuring tricks and hocus-pocuses! Tell me all
      about it. An Egyptian guide: Abfou, was it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie thought it might be wiser not to tell Lucia all
      that Abfou had vouchsafed, unless she really insisted, for
      Abfou had written the most sarcastic things about her in
      perfect English at top-speed. He had called her a snob
      again, and said she was too grand now for her old friends,
      and had been really rude about her shingled hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Abfou," he said. "Abfou was in great form, and Olga
      has telegraphed for a planchette. Abfou said she was most
      psychical, and had great mediumistic gifts. Well, that went
      on a long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else did Abfou say?" asked Lucia, fixing Georgie with
      her penetrating eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he talked about Riseholme affairs," said Georgie. "He
      knew the Princess had been to the Museum, for he had seen
      her there. It was he, you know, who suggested the Museum.
      He kept writing Museum, though we thought it was Mouse at
      first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia felt perfectly certain in her own mind that Abfou had
      been saying things about her. But perhaps, as it was Daisy
      who had been operating, it was better not to ask what they
      were. Ignorance was not bliss, but knowledge might be even
      less blissful. And Georgie was not thawing: he was polite,
      he was reserved, but so far from chatting, he was talking
      with great care. She must get him in a more confidential
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That reminds me," she said. "Pepino and I haven't given
      you anything for the Museum yet. I must send you the
      Elizabethan spit from my music-room. They say it is the
      most perfect spit in existence. I don't know what Pepino
      didn't pay for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How kind of you," said Georgie. "I will tell the committee
      of your offer. Olga gave us a most magnificent present
      yesterday: the manuscript of 'Lucrezia,' which Cortese had
      given her. I took it to the Museum directly after
      breakfast, and put it in the glass case opposite the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Lucia longed to be as sarcastic as Abfou, and ask
      whether a committee meeting had been held to settle if this
      should be accepted. Probably Georgie had some perception of
      that, for he went on in a great hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the weedj lasted so long that I had only just time
      to get home to dress for dinner and go back to Olga's," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was there?" asked Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel and Mrs. Boucher, that's all," said Georgie. "And
      after dinner Olga sang too divinely. I played her
      accompaniments. A lot of Schubert songs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was beginning to feel sick with envy. She pictured to
      herself the glory of having taken her party across to
      Olga's after dinner last night, of having played the
      accompaniments instead of Georgie (who was a miserable
      accompanist), of having been persuaded afterwards to give
      them the little morsel of Stravinski, which she had got by
      heart. How brilliant it would all have been; what a
      sumptuous paragraph Hermione would have written about her
      week-end! Instead of which Olga had sung to those old
      Bouchers, neither of whom knew one note from another, nor
      cared the least for the distinction of hearing the
      prima-donna sing in her own house. The bitterness of it
      could not be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear old Schubert songs!" she said with extraordinary
      acidity. "Such sweet old-fashioned things. 'Wiedmung,' I
      suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that's by Schumann," said Georgie, who was nettled by
      her tone, though he guessed what she was suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia knew he was right, but had to uphold her own
      unfortunate mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Schubert, I think," she said. "Not that it matters. And
      so, as dear old Pepys said, and so to bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was certainly enjoying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, we didn't go to bed till terribly late," he said.
      "But you would have hated to be there, for what we did
      next. We turned on the gramophone--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a little wince. Her views about gramophones as
      being a profane parody of music, were well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I should have run away then," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We turned on the gramophone and danced!" said Georgie
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the worst she had heard yet. Again she pictured
      what yesterday evening might have been. The idea of having
      popped in with her party after dinner, to hear Olga sing,
      and then dance impromptu with a prima-donna and a princess.
      . . . It was agonising: it was intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a dreadful little titter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How very droll!" she said. "I can hardly imagine it. Mrs.
      Boucher in her bath-chair must have been an unwieldy
      partner, Georgie. Are you not very stiff this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mrs. Boucher didn't dance," said Georgie with fearful
      literalness. "She looked on and wound up the gramophone.
      Just we four danced: Olga and the Princess and Colonel
      Boucher and I."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia made a great effort with herself. She knew quite well
      that Georgie knew how she would have given anything to have
      brought her party across, and it only made matters worse
      (if they could be made worse) to be sarcastic about it and
      pretend to find it all ridiculous. Olga certainly had left
      her and her friends alone, just as she herself had left
      Riseholme alone, in this matter of her week-end party. Yet
      it was unwise to be withering about Colonel Boucher's
      dancing. She had made it clear that she was busy with her
      party, and but for this unfortunate accident of Olga's
      coming down, nothing else could have happened in Riseholme
      that day except by her dispensing. It was unfortunate, but
      it must be lived down, and if dear old Riseholme was
      offended with her, Riseholme must be propitiated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great fun it must have been," she said. "How delicious a
      little impromptu thing like that is! And singing too: well,
      you had a nice evening, Georgie. And now let us make some
      delicious little plan for to-day. Pop in presently and have
      'ickle music and bit of lunch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid I've just promised to lunch with Daisy," said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      This again was rather ominous, for there could be no doubt
      that Daisy, having said she was engaged, had popped in here
      to effect an engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How gay!" said Lucia. "Come and dine this evening then!
      Really, Georgie, you are busier than any of us in London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too tarsome," said Georgie, "because Olga's coming in
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Princess?" asked Lucia before she could stop
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she went away this morning," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was something, anyhow, thought Lucia. One
      distinguished person had gone away from Riseholme. She
      waited, in slowly diminishing confidence, for Georgie to
      ask her to dine with him instead. Perhaps he would ask
      Pepino too, but if not, Pepino would be quite happy with
      his telescope and his cross-words all by himself. But it
      was odd and distasteful to wait to be asked to dinner by
      anybody in Riseholme instead of everyone wanting to be
      asked by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She went away by the ten thirty," said Georgie, after an
      awful pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had already learned certain lessons in London. If you
      get a snub--and this seemed very like a snub--the only
      possible course was to be unaware of it. So, though the
      thought of being snubbed by Georgie nearly made her swoon,
      she was unaware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a good train," she said, magnificently disregarding
      the well-known fact that it stopped at every station, and
      crawled in between.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent," said Georgie with conviction. He had not the
      slightest intention of asking Lucia to dine, for he wanted
      his tête-à-tête with Olga. There would be such a lot to
      talk over, and besides it would be tiresome to have Lucia
      there, for she would be sure to gabble away about her
      wonderful life in London, and her music-room and her
      Chippendale chairs, and generally to lay down the law. She
      must be punished too, for her loathsome conduct in
      disregarding her old friends when she had her party from
      London, and be made to learn that her old friends were
      being much smarter than she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia kept her end up nobly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Georgie, I must trot away," she said. "Such a lot of
      people to see. Look in, if you've got a spare minute. I'm
      off again to-morrow. Such a whirl of things in London this
      week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, instead of proceeding to see lots of people, went
      back to her house and saw Pepino. He was sitting in the
      garden in very old clothes, smoking a pipe, and thoroughly
      enjoying the complete absence of anything to do. He was
      aware that officially he loved the bustle of London, but it
      was extremely pleasant to sit in his garden and smoke a
      pipe, and above all to be rid of those rather hectic people
      who had talked quite incessantly from morning till night
      all Sunday. He had given up the cross-word, and was
      thinking over the material for a sonnet on Tranquillity,
      when Lucia came out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was wondering, Pepino," she said, "if it would not be
      pleasanter to go up to town this afternoon. We should get
      the cool of the evening for our drive, and really, now all
      our guests have gone, and we are going to-morrow, these
      hours will be rather tedious. We are spoilt, <i>caro,</i>
      you and I, by our full life up there, where any moment the
      telephone bell may ring with some delightful invitation. Of
      course in August we will be here, and settle down to our
      quaint old life again, but these little odds and ends of
      time, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino was reasonably astonished. Half an hour ago Lucia
      had set out, burning with enthusiasm to pick up the 'old
      threads,' and now all she seemed to want to do was to drop
      the old threads as quickly as possible. Though he knew
      himself to be incapable of following the swift and antic
      movements of Lucia's mind, he was capable of putting two
      and two together. He had been faintly conscious all
      yesterday that matters were not going precisely as Lucia
      wished, and knew that her efforts to entice Olga and her
      guest to the house had been as barren as a fig-tree, but
      there must have been something more than that. Though not
      an imaginative man (except in thinking that words rhymed
      when they did not), it occurred to him that Riseholme was
      irritated with Lucia, and was indicating it in some unusual
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear, I thought you were going to have people in
      to lunch and dinner," he said, "and see about sending the
      spit to the Museum, and be tremendously busy all day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia pulled herself together. She had a momentary impulse
      to confide in Pepino and tell him all the ominous
      happenings of the last hour, how Daisy had said she was
      engaged for lunch and Mrs. Boucher had friends to lunch,
      and Georgie had Olga to dinner and had not asked her, and
      how the munificent gift of the spit was to be considered by
      the Museum committee before they accepted it. But to have
      done that would be to acknowledge not one snub but many
      snubs, which was contrary to the whole principle of
      successful attainment. Never must she confess, even to
      Pepino, that the wheels of her chariot seemed to drive
      heavily, or that Riseholme was not at the moment agape to
      receive the signs of her favour. She must not even confess
      it to herself, and she made a rapid and complete <i>volte
      face.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be as you like, <i>caro,</i>" she said. "You
      would prefer to spend a quiet day here, so you shall. As
      for me, you've never known me yet otherwise than busy, have
      you? I have a stack of letters to write, and there's my
      piano looking, oh, so reproachfully at me, for I haven't
      touched the dear keys since I came, and I must just glance
      through 'Henry VIII,' as we're going to see it to-morrow. I
      shall be busy enough, and you will have your day in the sun
      and the air. I only thought you might prefer to run up to
      town to-day, instead of waiting till to-morrow. Now don't
      keep me chatting here any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia proved her quality on that dismal day. She played her
      piano with all her usual concentration, she read 'Henry
      VIII,' she wrote her letters, and it was not till the
      <i>Evening Gazette</i> came in that she allowed herself a
      moment's relaxation. Hurriedly she turned the pages,
      stopping neither for cross-word nor record of international
      interests, till she came to Hermione's column. She had
      feared (and with a gasp of relief she saw how unfounded her
      fears had been) that Hermione would have devoted his
      picturesque pen to Olga and the Princess, and given her and
      her party only the fag-end of his last paragraph, but she
      had disquieted herself in vain. Olga had taken no notice of
      him, and now (what could be fairer?) he took no notice of
      Olga. He just mentioned that she had a 'pretty little
      cottage' at Riseholme, where she came occasionally for
      week-ends, and there were three long sumptuous paragraphs
      about The Hurst, and Mr. and Mrs. Philip Lucas who had Lord
      Limpsfield and the wife of the member, Mrs. Garroby-Ashton,
      and Mrs. Alingsby staying with them. Lady Ambermere and her
      party from the Hall had come to tea, and it was all
      glorious and distinguished. Hermione had proved himself a
      true friend, and there was not a word about Olga and the
      Princess going to lunch with Georgie, or about Daisy and
      her absurd weedj. . . . Lucia read the luscious lines
      through twice, and then, as she often did, sent her copy
      across to Georgie, in order to help him to readjust values.
      Almost simultaneously Daisy sent de Vere across to him with
      her copy, and Mrs. Boucher did the same, calling attention
      to the obnoxious paragraphs with blue and red pencil
      respectively, and a great many exclamation marks in both
      cases.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Riseholme settled back into its strenuous life again when
      Lucia departed next morning to resume her vapid existence
      in London. It was not annoyed with her any more, because it
      had 'larned' her, and was quite prepared to welcome her
      back if (and when) she returned in a proper spirit and
      behaved herself suitably. Moreover, even with its own
      perennial interests to attend to, it privately missed the
      old Lucia, who gave them a lead in everything, even though
      she domineered, and was absurd, and pretended to know all
      about everything, and put her finger into every pie within
      reach. But it did not miss the new shingled Lucia, the one
      who had come down with a party of fresh friends, and had
      laughed at the Museum, and had neglected her old friends
      altogether, till she found out that Olga and a Princess
      were in the place: the less seen of her the better. It was
      considered also that she had remained down here this extra
      day in order to propitiate those whom she had treated as
      pariahs, and condescend to take notice of them again, and
      if there was one thing that Riseholme could not stand, and
      did not mean to stand from anybody, it was condescension.
      It was therefore perfectly correct for Daisy and Mrs.
      Boucher to say they were engaged for lunch, and for Georgie
      to decline to ask her to dinner. . . . These three formed
      the committee of the Museum, and they met that morning to
      audit the accounts for the week and discuss any other
      business connected or unconnected with their office. There
      was not, of course, with so small and intimate a body, any
      need to have a chairman, and they all rapped the table when
      they wanted to be listened to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boucher was greedily counting the shillings which had
      been taken from the till, while Georgie counted the
      counterfoils of the tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred and twenty-three," he said. "That's nearly the
      best week we've had yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And fifteen and four is nineteen," said Mrs. Boucher, "and
      four is twenty-three which makes exactly six pounds three
      shillings. Well, I do call that good. And I hear we've had
      a wonderful bequest made. Most generous of our dear Olga. I
      think she ought not only to be thanked, but asked to join
      the committee. I always said--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy rapped the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abfou said just the same," she interrupted. "I had a
      sitting this morning, and he kept writing 'committee.' I
      brought the paper along with me, because I was going to
      propose that myself. But there's another thing first, and
      that's about Insurance. Robert told me he was insuring the
      building and its contents separately for a thousand pounds
      each. We shall have to pay a premium, of course. Oh, here's
      Abfou's message. 'Committee,' you see 'committee' written
      three times. I feel quite sure he meant Olga."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He spells it with only one 'm,'" said Georgie, "but I
      expect he means that. There's one bit of business that
      comes before that, for I have been offered another object
      for the Museum, and I said I would refer the offer to the
      Committee before I accepted it. Lucia came to see me
      yesterday morning and asked--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Elizabethan spit," said Mrs. Boucher. "I don't see
      what we want with it, for my part, and if I had to say what
      I thought, I should thank her most politely, and beg that
      she would keep it herself. Most kind of her, I'm sure.
      Sorry to refuse, which was just what I said when she asked
      me to lunch yesterday. There'd have been legs of cold
      chickens of which her friends from London had eaten wings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She asked me too," said Daisy, "and I said 'no.' Did she
      leave this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, about half past ten," said Georgie. "She wanted me to
      ask her to dinner last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy had been writing 'committee' again and again on her
      blotting paper. It looked very odd with two 'm's' and she
      would certainly have spelt it with one herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think Abfou is right about the way to spell
      'committee,'" she said, "and even if he weren't the meaning
      is clear enough. But about the insurance. Robert only
      advises insurance against fire, for he says no burglar in
      his senses--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boucher rapped the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there wasn't the manuscript of 'Lucrezia' then," she
      said. "And I should think that any burglar whether in his
      senses or out of them would think <i>that</i> worth taking.
      If it was a question of insuring an Elizabethan spit--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I want to know what the committee wishes me to say
      about that," said Georgie. "Oh, by the way, when we have a
      new edition of the catalogue, we must bring it up to date.
      There'll be the manuscript of 'Lucrezia.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you ask me," said Mrs. Boucher, "she only wanted to
      get rid of the spit because it makes her chimney smoke.
      Tell her to get her chimney swept and keep the spit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a portrait of her in the music-room," said
      Georgie, "by Sigismund. It looks like nothing at all--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course everybody has a right to have their hair
      shingled," said Mrs. Boucher, "whatever their age, and
      there's no law to prevent you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy rapped the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were considering as to whether we should ask Mrs.
      Shuttleworth to join the committee," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sang too, beautifully, on Sunday night," said Georgie,
      "and what fun we had dancing. Oh, and Lucia asked for the
      Princess's book to sign her name in, and the only book she
      had brought was a book of cross-word puzzles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said both ladies together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did, because Olga's parlour-maid told Foljambe, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well I never!" said Daisy. "That served her out. Did she
      write Lucia across, and Pepino down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I've nothing to say against her," said Mrs.
      Boucher, "but people usually get what they deserve.
      Certainly let us have the Museum insured if that's the
      right thing to do, and as for asking Olga to be on the
      committee, why we settled that hours ago, and I have
      nothing more to say about the spit. Have the spit if you
      like, but I would no more think of insuring it, than
      insuring a cold in the head. I've as much use for one as
      the other. All that stuff too about the gracious chatelaine
      at The Hurst in the <i>Evening Gazette</i>! My husband read
      it, and what he said was 'Faugh!' Tush and faugh, was what
      he said."
    </p>
    <p>
      Public opinion was beginning to boil up again about Lucia,
      and Georgie intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that's all the business before the meeting," he
      said, "and so we accept the manuscript of' 'Lucrezia' and
      decline the spit. I'm sure it was very kind of both the
      donors. And Olga's to be asked to join the committee. Well,
      we have got through a good morning's work."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia meanwhile was driving back to London, where she
      intended to make herself a busy week. There would be two
      nights at the opera, on the second of which Olga was
      singing in "The Valkyrie," and so far from intending to
      depreciate her singing, or to refrain from going, by way of
      revenge for the slight she had suffered, she meant, even if
      Olga sang like a screech-owl and acted like a stick, to say
      there had never been so perfect a presentation of
      Brunhilde. She could not conceive doing anything so stupid
      as snubbing Olga because she had not come to her house or
      permitted her to enter Old Place: that would have been the
      height of folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present, she was (or hoped to be) on the upward road,
      and the upward road could only be climbed by industry and
      appreciation. When she got to the top, it would be a
      different matter, but just now it was an asset, a score to
      allude to dear Olga and the hoppings in and out that took
      place all day at Riseholme: she knew too, a good deal that
      Olga had done on Sunday and that would all be useful.
      "Always appreciate, always admire," thought Lucia to
      herself as she woke Pepino up from a profound nap on their
      arrival at Brompton Square. "Be busy: work, work, work."
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew already that there would be hard work in front of
      her before she got where she wanted to get, and she whisked
      off like a disturbing fly which impeded concentration the
      slight disappointment which her weekend had brought. If you
      meant to progress, you must never look back (the awful
      example of Lot's wife!) and never, unless you are certain
      it is absolutely useless, kick down a ladder which has
      brought you anywhere, or might in the future bring you
      anywhere. Already she had learned a lesson about that, for
      if she had only told Georgie that she had been coming down
      for a weekend, and had bidden him to lunch and dinner and
      anything else he liked, he would certainly have got Olga to
      pop in at The Hurst, or have said that he couldn't dine
      with Olga on that fateful Sunday night because he was
      dining with her, and then no doubt Olga would have asked
      them all to come in afterwards. It had been a mistake to
      kick Riseholme down, a woeful mistake, and she would never
      do such a thing again. It was a mistake also to be
      sarcastic about anybody till you were sure they could not
      help you, and who could be sure of that? Even poor dear
      Daisy with her ridiculous Abfou had proved such an
      attraction at Old Place, that Georgie had barely time to
      get back and dress for dinner, and a benignant Daisy
      instead of a militant and malignant Daisy would have
      helped. Everything helps, thought Lucia, as she snatched up
      the tablets which stood by the telephone and recorded the
      ringings up that had taken place in her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fairly gasped at the amazing appropriateness of a
      message that had been received only ten minutes ago. Marcia
      Whitby hoped that she could dine that evening: the message
      was to be delivered as soon as she arrived. Obviously it
      was a last moment invitation: somebody had thrown her over,
      and perhaps that made them thirteen. There was no great
      compliment in it, for Marcia, so Lucia conjectured, had
      already tried high and low to get another woman, and now in
      despair she tried Lucia. . . . Of course there were the
      tickets for 'Henry VIII,' and it was a first night, but
      perhaps she could get somebody to go with Pepino. . . . Ah,
      she remembered Aggie Sanderson lamenting that she had been
      able to secure a seat! Without a pause she rang up the
      Duchess of Whitby, and expressed her eager delight at
      coming to dine to-night. So lucky, so charmed. Then having
      committed herself, she rang up Aggie and hoped for the
      best, and Aggie jumped at the idea of a ticket for Henry
      VIII, and then she told Pepino all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Caro,</i> I had to be kind," she said, tripping off
      into the music-room where he was at tea. "Poor Marcia
      Whitby in despair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, what has happened?" asked Pepino.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One short, one woman short, evidently, for her dinner
      to-night: besought me to go. But you shall have your play
      all the same, and a dear sweet woman to take to it. Guess!
      No. I'll tell you: Aggie. She was longing to go, and so
      it's a kindness all round. You will have somebody more
      exciting to talk to than your poor old <i>sposa,</i> and
      dearest Aggie will get her play, and Marcia will be ever so
      grateful to me. I shall miss the play, but I will go
      another night unless you tell me it is no good. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the <i>Evening Gazette</i> would contain no
      further news of the chatelaine at The Hurst, but Lucia
      turned to Hermione's column with a certain eagerness, for
      there might be something about the duchess's dinner this
      evening. Hermione did not seem to have heard of it, but if
      Hermione came to lunch to-morrow, he would hear of it then.
      She rang him up. . . .
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's kindness to Marcia Whitby met with all sorts of
      rewards. She got there, as was her custom in London, rather
      early, so that she could hear the names of all the guests
      as they arrived, and Marcia, feeling thoroughly
      warm-hearted to her, for she had tried dozens of women to
      turn her party from thirteen into fourteen, called her
      Lucia instead of Mrs. Lucas. It was no difficulty to Lucia
      to reciprocate this intimacy in a natural manner, for she
      had alluded to the duchess as Marcia behind her back, for
      weeks, and now the syllables tripped to her tongue with the
      familiarity of custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet of you to ask me, dear Marcia," she said. "Pepino
      and I only arrived from Riseholme an hour or two ago, and
      he took Aggie Sandeman to the theatre instead of me. Such a
      lovely Sunday at Riseholme: you must spare a week-end and
      come down and vegetate. Olga Shuttleworth was there with
      Princess Isabel, and she sang too divinely on Sunday
      evening, and then, would you believe it, we turned on the
      gramophone and danced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a coincidence!" said Marcia, "because I've got a
      small dance to-night, and Princess Isabel is coming. But
      not nearly so chic as your dance at Riseholme."
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved towards the door to receive the guests who were
      beginning to arrive, and Lucia with ears open for
      distinguished names, had just a moment's qualm for having
      given the impression which she meant to give, that she had
      been dancing to Olga's gramophone. It was no more than
      momentary, and presently the Princess arrived, and was led
      round by her hostess, to receive curtsies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of course you know Mrs. Lucas," said Marcia. "She's
      been telling me about your dancing to the gramophone at her
      house on Sunday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia recovered from her curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dear Marcia," she said. "It was at Olga's, in fact--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess fixed her with a royal eye before she passed
      on, as if she seemed to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was the only catastrophe, and how small a one! The
      Princess liked freaks, and so Marcia had asked a star of
      the movies and a distinguished novelist, and a woman with a
      skin like a kipper from having crossed the Sahara twice on
      foot, or having swum the Atlantic twice, or something of
      the sort, and a society caricaturist and a slim young
      gentleman with a soft voice, who turned out to be the
      bloodiest pugilist of the century, and the Prime Minister,
      two ambassadresses, and the great Mrs. Beaucourt who had
      just astounded the world by her scandalous volume of purely
      imaginary reminiscences. Each of these would furnish a
      brilliant centre for a dinner party, and the idea of
      spreading the butter as thick as that seemed to Lucia
      almost criminal: she herself, indeed, was the only bit of
      bread to be seen anywhere. Before dinner was over she had
      engaged both her neighbours, the pugilist and the cinema
      star, to dine with her on consecutive nights next week, and
      was mentally running through her list of friends to settle
      whom to group round them. Alf Watson, the pugilist, it
      appeared, when not engaged in knocking people out, spent
      his time in playing the flute to soothe his savage breast,
      while Marcelle Periscope when not impersonating impassioned
      lovers, played with his moderately tame lion-cub. Lucia
      begged Alf to bring his flute, and they would have some
      music, but did not extend her invitation to the lion-cub,
      which sounded slightly Bolshevistic. . . . Later in the
      evening she got hold of Herbert Alton, the social
      caricaturist, who promised to lunch on Sunday, but failed
      to do business with the lady from the Sahara, who was
      leaving next day to swim another sea, or cross another
      desert. Then the guests for the dance began to arrive, and
      Lucia, already half-intoxicated by celebrities, sank rapt
      in a chair at the top of the staircase and listened to the
      catalogue of sonorous names. Up trooped stars and garters
      and tiaras, and when she felt stronger, she clung firmly to
      Lord Limpsfield, who seemed to know everybody and raked in
      introductions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did not get home till three o'clock (for having given
      up her play out of kindness to Marcia, she might as well do
      it thoroughly), but she was busy writing invitations for
      her two dinner parties next week by nine in the morning.
      Pepino was lunching at his club, where he might meet the
      Astronomer Royal, and have a chat about the constellations,
      but he was to ring her up about a quarter past two and
      ascertain if she had made any engagement for him during the
      afternoon. The idea of this somehow occupied her brain as
      she filled up the cards of invitation in her small
      exquisite handwriting. There was a telephone in her
      dining-room, and she began to visualise to herself Pepino's
      ringing her up, while she and the two or three friends who
      were lunching with her would be still at table. It would be
      at the end of lunch: they would be drinking their coffee,
      which she always made herself in a glass machine with a
      spirit-lamp which, when it appeared to be on the point of
      exploding, indicated that coffee was ready. The servants
      would have left the room, and she would go to the telephone
      herself. . . . She would hear Pepino's voice, but nobody
      else would. They would not know who was at the other end,
      and she might easily pretend that it was not Pepino, but .
      . . She would give a gabbling answer, audible to her
      guests, but she could divert her mouth a little away so
      that Pepino could not make anything out of it, and then
      hang up the receiver again. . . . Pepino no doubt would
      think he had got hold of a wrong number, and presently call
      her up again, and she would then tell him anything there
      was to communicate. As she scribbled away the idea took
      shape and substance: there was an attraction about it, it
      smiled on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to the end of her dinner-invitations grouped round
      the cinema-star and the fluting prize-fighter, and she
      considered whom to ask to meet Herbert Alton on Sunday. He
      was working hard, he had told her, to finish his little
      gallery of caricatures with which he annually regaled
      London, and which was to open in a fortnight. He was a
      licensed satirist, and all London always flocked to his
      show to observe with glee what he made of them all, and
      what witty and pungent little remarks he affixed to their
      monstrous effigies. It was a distinct <i>cachet,</i> too,
      to be caricatured by him, a sign that you attracted
      attention and were a notable figure. He might (in fact, he
      always did) make you a perfect guy, and his captions
      invariably made fun of something characteristic, but it
      gave you publicity. She wondered whether he would take a
      commission: she wondered whether he might be induced to do
      a caricature of Pepino or herself or of them both, at a
      handsome price, with the proviso that it was to be on view
      at his exhibition. That could probably be ascertained, and
      then she might approach the subject on Sunday. Anyhow, she
      would ask one or two pleasant people to meet him, and hope
      for the best.

    <p>
      Lucia's little lunch-party that day consisted only of four
      people. Lunch, Lucia considered, was for <i>intimes:</i>
      you sat with your elbows on the table, and all talked
      together, and learned the news, just as you did on the
      Green at Riseholme. There was something unwieldy about a
      large lunch-party; it was a distracted affair, and in the
      effort to assimilate more news than you could really
      digest, you forgot half of it. To-day, therefore, there was
      only Aggie Sandeman who had been to the play last night
      with Pepino, and was bringing her cousin Adele Brixton
      (whom Lucia had not yet met, but very much wanted to know),
      and Stephen Merriall. Lady Brixton was a lean, intelligent
      American of large fortune who found she got on better
      without her husband. But as Lord Brixton preferred living
      in America and she in England, satisfactory arrangements
      were easily made. Occasionally she had to go to see
      relatives in America, and he selected such periods for
      seeing relatives in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained the situation very good-naturedly to Lucia
      who rather rashly asked after her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact," she said, "we blow kisses to each other from the
      decks of Atlantic liners going in opposite directions, if
      it's calm, and if it's rough, we're sick into the same
      ocean."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that would never have been said at Riseholme, or if it
      was, it would have been very ill thought of, and a forced
      smile followed by a complete change of conversation would
      have given it a chilly welcome. Now, out of habit, Lucia
      smiled a forced smile, and then remembered that you could
      not judge London by the chaste standards of Riseholme. She
      turned the forced smile into a genial one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too delicious!" she said. "I must tell Pepino that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pep what?" asked Lady Brixton.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was explained; it was also explained that Aggie had
      been with Pepino to the play last night; in fact there was
      rather too much explanation going on for social ease, and
      Lucia thought it was time to tell them all about what she
      had done last night. She did this in a characteristic
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Lady Brixton," she said, "ever since you came in I've
      been wondering where I have seen you. Of course it was last
      night, at our darling Marcia's dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to introduce the desirable topic, and though it
      was not in the least true, it was a wonderfully good shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I was there," said Adele. "What a crush. Sheer
      Mormonism: one man to fifty women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How unkind of you! I dined there first; quite a small
      party. Princess Isabel, who had been down at our dear
      little Riseholme on Sunday, staying with Olga--such a
      coincidence--" Lucia stopped just in time; she was about to
      describe the impromptu dance at Olga's on Sunday night, but
      remembered that Stephen knew she had not been to it. So she
      left the coincidence alone, and went rapidly on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Marcia insisted on my coming," she said, "and so,
      really, like a true friend I gave up the play and went.
      Such an amusing little dinner. Marcelle--Marcelle
      Periscope, the Prime Minister and the Italian ambassadress,
      and Princess Isabel of course, and Alf, and a few more.
      There's nobody like Marcia for getting up a wonderful
      unexpected little party like that. Alf was too delicious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not Alf Watson?" asked Lady Brixton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I sat next him at dinner, and he's coming to dine
      with me next week, and is bringing his flute. He adores
      playing the flute. Can't I persuade you to come, Lady
      Brixton? Thursday, let me see, is it Thursday? Yes,
      Thursday. No party at all, just a few old friends, and some
      music. I must find some duets for the piano and flute: Alf
      made me promise that I would play his accompaniments for
      him. And Dora: Dora Beaucourt. What a lurid life! And
      Sigismund: no, I don't think Sigismund was there; it was at
      Sophy's. Such a marvellous portrait he has done of me: is
      it not marvellous, Stephen? You remember it down at
      Riseholme. How amusing Sophy was, insisting that I should
      move every other picture out of my music room. I must get
      her to come in after dinner on Thursday; there is something
      primitive about the flute." So Theocritan!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia suddenly remembered that she mustn't kick ladders
      down, and turned to Aggie. Aggie had been very useful when
      first she came up to London, and she might quite easily be
      useful again, for she knew quantities of solid people, and
      if her parties lacked brilliance, they were highly
      respectable. The people whom Sophy called 'the old crusted'
      went there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aggie dear, as soon as you get home, put down Wednesday
      for dining with me," she said, "and if there's an
      engagement there already, as there's sure to be, cross it
      out and have pseudo-influenza. Marcelle--Marcelle Periscope
      is coming, but I didn't ask the lion-cub. A lion-cub: so
      quaint of him--and who else was there last night? Dear me,
      I get so mixed up with all the people one runs across."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, of course, never got mixed up at all: there was no
      one so clear-headed, but she had to spin things out a
      little, for Pepino was rather late ringing up. The
      coffee-equipage had been set before her, and she kept
      drawing away the spirit-lamp in an absent manner just
      before it boiled, for they must still be sitting in the
      dining-room when he rang up. But even as she lamented her
      muddled memory, the tinkle of the telephone bell sounded.
      She rapidly rehearsed in her mind what she was going to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that telephone," she said, rising hastily, so as to
      get to it before one of the servants came back. "I often
      tell Pepino I shall cut it out of the house, for one never
      gets a moment's peace. Yes, yes, who is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia listened for a second, and then gave a curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, is it you, ma'am?" she said, holding the mouthpiece a
      little obliquely. "Yes, I'm Mrs. Lucas."
    </p>
    <p>
      A rather gruff noise, clearly Pepino's voice, came from the
      instrument, but she trusted it was inaudible to the others,
      and she soon broke in again talking very rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that is kind of you, your Highness," she said. "It
      would be too delightful. To-morrow: charmed. Delighted."
    </p>
    <p>
      She replaced the mouthpiece, and instantly began to talk
      again from the point at which she had left off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and of course Herbert Alton was there," she said.
      "His show opens in a fortnight, and how we shall all meet
      there at the private view and laugh at each other's
      caricatures! What is it that Rousseau--is it
      Rousseau?--says, about our not being wholly grieved at the
      misfortunes of our friends? So true! Bertie is rather
      wicked sometimes though, but still one forgives him
      everything. Ah, the coffee is boiling at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino, as Lucia had foreseen, rang up again almost
      immediately, and she told him he had missed the most
      charming little lunch party, because he would go to his
      club. Her guests, of course, were burning to know to whom
      she had curtsied, but Lucia gave no information on the
      point. Adele Brixton and Aggie presently went off to a
      matinee, but Stephen remained behind. That looked rather
      well, Lucia thought, for she had noticed that often a
      handsome and tolerably young man lingered with the hostess
      when other guests had gone. There was something rather
      <i>chic</i> about it; if it happened very constantly, or if
      at another house they came together or went away together,
      people would begin to talk, quite pleasantly of course,
      about his devotion to her. Georgie had been just such a
      <i>cavaliere servente.</i> Stephen, for his part, was quite
      unconscious of any such scintillations in Lucia's mind: he
      merely knew that it was certainly convenient for an
      unattached man to have a very pleasant house always to go
      to, where he would be sure of hearing things that
      interested Hermione.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delicious little lunch party," he said. "What a charming
      woman Lady Brixton is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Adele," said Lucia dreamily. "Charming, isn't she?
      How pleased she was at the thought of meeting Alf! Do look
      in after dinner that night, Stephen. I wish I could ask you
      to dine, but I expect to be crammed as it is. Dine on
      Wednesday, though: let me see, Marcelle comes that night.
      What a rush next week will be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen waited for her to allude to the voice to which she
      had curtsied, but he waited in vain.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This delicious little luncheon-party had violently excited
      Adele Brixton: she was thrilled to the marrow at Lucia's
      curtsey to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, she's marvellous," she said to Aggie. "She's a
      study. She's cosmic. The telephone, the curtsey! I've never
      seen the like. But why in the name of wonder didn't she
      tell us who the Highness was? She wasn't shy of talking
      about the other folk she'd met. Alf and Marcelle and Marcia
      and Bertie. But she made a mistake over Bertie. She
      shouldn't have said 'Bertie.' I've known Herbert Alton for
      years, and never has anybody called him anything but
      Herbert. 'Bertie' was a mistake, but don't tell her. I
      adore your Lucia. She'll go far, mark my words, and I bet
      you she's talking of me as Adele this moment. Don't you see
      how wonderful she is? I've been a climber myself and I
      know. But I was a snail compared to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie Sandeman was rather vexed at not being asked to the
      Alf party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't tell me how wonderful she is," she observed
      with some asperity. "It's not two months since she came to
      London first, and she didn't know a soul. She dined with me
      the first night she came up, and since then she has annexed
      every single person she met at my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She would," said Adele appreciatively. "And who was the
      man who looked as if he had been labelled 'Man' by mistake
      when he was born, and ought to have been labelled 'Lady'? I
      never saw such a perfect lady, though I only know him as
      Stephen at present. She just said, 'Stephen, do you know
      Lady Brixton?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stephen Merriall," said Aggie. "Just one of the men who go
      out to tea every day--one of the unattached."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, she's going to attach him," said Adele. "Dear
      me, aren't I poisonous, when I'm going to her house to meet
      Alf next week! But I don't feel poisonous; I feel wildly
      interested: I adore her. Here we are at the theatre: what a
      bore! And there's Tony Limpsfield. Tony, come and help me
      out. We've been lunching with the most marvellous--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect you mean Lucia," said Tony. "I spent Sunday with
      her at Riseholme."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She curtsied to the telephone," began Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was at the other end?" asked Tony eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what she didn't say," said Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" asked Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele stepped briskly out of her car, followed by Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't make out," she said. "Oh, do you know Mrs.
      Sandeman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course," said Tony. "And it couldn't have been
      Princess Isabel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? She met her at Marcia's last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but the Princess fled from her. She fled from her at
      Riseholme too, and said she would never go to her house. It
      can't have been she. But she got hold of that boxer--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alf Watson," said Adele. "She called him Alf, and I'm
      going to meet him at her house on Thursday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's very unkind of you to crab her, Adele," said
      Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not: I'm simply wildly interested. Anyhow, what about
      you? You spent a Sunday with her at Riseholme."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she calls you Tony," said Aggie vituperatively, still
      thinking about the Alf party.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, does she really?" said Tony. "But after all, I call
      her Lucia when she's not there. The bell's gone, by the
      way: the curtain will be up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele hurried in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to my box, Tony," she said, "after the first act. I
      haven't been so interested in anything for years."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele paid no attention whatever to the gloomy play of
      Tchekov's. Her whole mind was concentrated on Lucia, and
      soon she leaned across to Aggie, and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe it was Pepino who rang her up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie knitted her brows for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't have been," she said. "He rang her up directly
      afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele's face fell. Not being able to think as far ahead as
      Lucia she didn't see the answer to that, and relapsed into
      Lucian meditation, till the moment the curtain fell, when
      Tony Limpsfield slid into their box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what the play has been about," he said, "but
      I must tell you why she was at Marcia's last night. Some
      women chucked Marcia during the afternoon and made her
      thirteen--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marcia would like that," said Aggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony took no notice of this silly joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So she rang up everybody in town--" he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except me," said Aggie bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never mind that," said Tony. "She rang up everybody,
      and couldn't get hold of anyone. Then she rang up Lucia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who instantly said she was disengaged, and rang me up to
      go to the theatre with Pepino," said Aggie. "I suspected
      something of the sort, but I wanted to see the play, and I
      wasn't going to cut off my nose to spite Lucia's face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides, she would have got someone else, or sent Pepino
      to the play alone," said Tony. "And you've got hold of the
      wrong end of the stick, Aggie. Nobody wants to spite Lucia.
      We all want her to have the most glorious time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aggie's vexed because she thinks she invented Lucia,"
      observed Adele. "That's the wrong attitude altogether. Tell
      me about Pep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply nothing to say about him," said Tony. "He has
      trousers and a hat, and a telescope on the roof at
      Riseholme, and when you talk to him you see he remembers
      what the leading articles in <i>The Times</i> said that
      morning. Don't introduce irrelevant matters, Adele."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But husbands are relevant--all but mine," said Adele.
      "Part of the picture. And what about Stephen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you always see him handing buns at tea-parties. He's
      irrelevant too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might not be if her husband is," said Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony exploded with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are off the track," he said. "You'll get nowhere if
      you attempt to smirch Lucia's character. How could she have
      time for a lover to begin with? And you misunderstand her
      altogether, if you think that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be frightfully picturesque," said Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it would spoil it altogether. . . . Oh, there's this
      stupid play beginning again. . . . Gracious heavens, look
      there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed his finger, and saw Lucia followed by Stephen
      coming up the central aisle of the stalls to two places in
      the front row. Just as she reached her place she turned
      round to survey the house, and caught sight of them. Then
      the lights were lowered, and her face slid into darkness.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      This little colloquy in Adele's box was really the
      foundation of the secret society of the Luciaphils, and the
      membership of the Luciaphils began swiftly to increase.
      Aggie Sandeman was scarcely eligible, for complete goodwill
      towards Lucia was a <i>sine qua non</i> of membership, and
      there was in her mind a certain asperity when she thought
      that it was she who had given Lucia her gambit, and that
      already she was beginning to be relegated to second circles
      in Lucia's scale of social precedence. It was true that she
      had been asked to dine to meet Marcelle Periscope, but the
      party to meet Alf and his flute was clearly the smarter of
      the two. Adele, however, and Tony Limpsfield were real
      members, so too, when she came up a few days later, was
      Olga. Marcia Whitby was another who greedily followed her
      career, and such as these, whenever they met, gave eager
      news to each other about it. There was, of course, another
      camp, consisting of those whom Lucia bombarded with
      pleasant invitations, but who (at present) firmly refused
      them. They professed not to know her and not to take the
      slightest interest in her, which showed, as Adele said, a
      deplorable narrowness of mind. Types and striking
      characters like Lucia, who pursued undaunted and
      indefatigable their aim in life, were rare, and when they
      occurred should be studied with reverent affection. . . .
      Sometimes one of the old and original members of the
      Luciaphils discovered others, and if when Lucia's name was
      mentioned an eager and a kindly light shone in their eyes,
      and they said in a hushed whisper "Did you hear who was
      there on Thursday?" they thus disclosed themselves as
      Luciaphils. . . . All this was gradual, but the movement
      went steadily on, keeping pace with her astonishing career,
      for the days were few on which some gratifying achievement
      was not recorded in the veracious columns of Hermione.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was driving home one afternoon after a day passed in
      the Divorce Court. She had made the acquaintance of the
      President not long ago, and had asked him to dinner on the
      evening before this trial, which was the talk of the town,
      was to begin, and at the third attempt had got him to give
      her a seat in the Court. The trial had already lasted three
      days, and really no one seemed to think about anything
      else, and the papers had been full of soulful and
      surprising evidence. Certainly, Babs Shyton, the lady whose
      husband wanted to get rid of her, had written very odd
      letters to Woof-dog, otherwise known as Lord Middlesex, and
      he to her: Lucia could not imagine writing to anybody like
      that, and she would have been very much surprised if anyone
      had written to her as Woof-dog wrote to Babs. But as the
      trial went on, Lucia found herself growing warm with
      sympathy for Babs. Her husband, Colonel Shyton, must have
      been an impossible person to live with, for sometimes he
      would lie in bed all day, get up in the evening, have
      breakfast at 8 p.m., lunch a little after midnight, and
      dine heavily at 8.30 in the morning. Surely with a husband
      like that, any woman would want some sort of a Woof-dog to
      take care of her. Both Babs and he, in the extracts from
      the remarkable correspondence between them which were read
      out in court, alluded to Colonel Shyton as the S.P., which
      Babs (amid loud laughter) frankly confessed meant Stinkpot;
      and Babs had certainly written to Woof-dog to say that she
      was in bed and very sleepy and cross, but wished that
      Woof-dog was thumping his tail on the hearth-rug. That was
      indiscreet, but there was nothing incriminating about it,
      and as for the row of crosses which followed Babs's
      signature, she explained quite frankly that they indicated
      that she was cross. There were roars of laughter again at
      this, and even the Judge wore a broad grin as he said that
      if there was any more disturbance he should clear the
      court. Babs had produced an excellent impression, in fact:
      she had looked so pretty and had answered so gaily, and the
      Woof-dog had been just as admirable, for he was a strong
      silent Englishman, and when he was asked whether he had
      ever kissed Babs she said "That's a lie" in such a loud
      fierce voice that you felt that the jury had better believe
      him unless they all wanted to be knocked down. The verdict
      was expected next day, and Lucia meant to lose no time in
      asking Babs to dinner if it was in her favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court had been very hot and airless, and Lucia directed
      her chauffeur to drive round the park before going home.
      She had asked one or two people to tea at five, and one or
      two more at half-past, but there was time for a turn first,
      and, diverting her mind from the special features of the
      case to the general features of such cases, she thought
      what an amazing and incomparable publicity they gave any
      woman. Of course, if the verdict went against her, such
      publicity would be extremely disagreeable, but, given that
      the jury decided that there was nothing against her, Lucia
      could imagine being almost envious of her. She did not
      actually want to be placed in such a situation herself, but
      certainly it would convey a notoriety that could scarcely
      be accomplished by years of patient effort. Babs would feel
      that there was not a single person in any gathering who did
      not know who she was, and all about her, and, if she was
      innocent, that would be a wholly delightful result.
      Naturally, Lucia only envied the outcome of such an
      experience, not the experience itself, for it would entail
      a miserable life with Pepino, and she felt sure that dinner
      at 8.30 in the morning would be highly indigestible, but it
      would be wonderful to be as well-known as Babs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another point that had struck her, both in the trial itself
      and in the torrents of talk that for the last few days had
      been poured out over the case, was the warm sympathy of the
      world in general with Babs, whether guilty or innocent.
      "The world always loves a lover," thought Lucia, and
      Woof-dog thumping his tail on the rug by her bedroom fire
      was a beautiful image.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thoughts took a more personal turn. The idea of having
      a real lover was, of course, absolutely abhorrent to her
      whole nature, and besides, she did not know whom she could
      get. But the reputation of having a lover was a wholly
      different matter, presenting no such objections or
      difficulties, and most decidedly it gave a woman a certain
      <i>cachet,</i> if a man was always seen about with her and
      was supposed to be deeply devoted to her. The idea had
      occurred to her vaguely before, but now it took more
      definite shape, and as to her choice of this sort of lover,
      there was no difficulty about that. Hitherto, she had done
      nothing to encourage the notion, beyond having Stephen at
      the house a good deal, but now she saw herself assuming an
      air of devoted proprietorship of him; she could see herself
      talking to him in a corner, and even laying her hand on his
      sleeve, arriving with him at an evening party, and going
      away with him, for Pepino hated going out after dinner. . .
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      But caution was necessary in the first steps, for it would
      be hard to explain to Stephen what the proposed
      relationship was, and she could not imagine herself saying
      "We are going to pretend to be lovers, but we aren't." It
      would be quite dreadful if he misunderstood, and
      unexpectedly imprinted on her lips or even her hand a hot
      lascivious kiss, but up till now he certainly had not shown
      the smallest desire to do anything of the sort. She would
      never be able to see him again if he did that, and the
      world would probably say that he had dropped her. But she
      knew she couldn't explain the proposed position to him and
      he would have to guess: she could only give him a lead and
      must trust to his intelligence, and to the absence in him
      of any unsuspected amorous proclivities. She would begin
      gently, anyhow, and have him to dinner every day that she
      was at home. And really it would be very pleasant for him,
      for she was entertaining a great deal during this next week
      or two, and if he only did not yield to one of those rash
      and turbulent impulses of the male, all would be well.
      Georgie, until (so Lucia put it to herself) Olga had come
      between them, had done it beautifully, and Stephen was
      rather like Georgie. As for herself, she knew she could
      trust her firm slow pulses never to beat wild measures for
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She reached home to find that Adele had already arrived,
      and pausing only to tell her servant to ring up Stephen and
      ask him to come round at once, she went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest Adele," she said, "a million pardons. I have been
      in the Divorce Court all day. Too thrilled. Babs, dear Babs
      Shyton, was wonderful. They got nothing out of her at
      all--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: Lord Middlesex has got everything out of her already,"
      observed Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, how can you say that?" said Lucia. "Lord
      Middlesex--Woof-dog, you know--was just as wonderful. I
      feel sure the jury will believe them. Dear Babs! I must get
      her to come here some night soon and have a friendly little
      party for her. Think of that horrid old man who had lunch
      in the middle of the night! How terrible for her to have to
      go back to him. Dear me, what is her address?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She may not have to go back to him," said Adele. "If so,
      'care of Woof-dog' would probably find her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele had been feeling rather cross. Her husband had
      announced his intention of visiting his friends and
      relations in England, and she did not feel inclined to make
      a corresponding journey to America. But as Lucia went on,
      she forgot these minor troubles, and became enthralled.
      Though she was still talking about Babs and Woof-dog, Adele
      felt sure these were only symbols, like the dreams of
      psycho-analysts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sympathy is entirely with dear Babs," she said. "Think
      of her position with that dreadful old wretch. A woman
      surely may be pardoned, even if the jury don't believe her
      for--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course she may," said Adele with a final spurt of
      ill-temper. "What she's not pardoned for is being found
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you're talking as everybody talked in that dreadful
      play I went to last night," said Lucia. "Dear Olga was
      there: she is singing to-morrow, is she not? And you are
      assuming that Babs is guilty. How glad I am, Adele, that
      you are not on the jury! I take quite the other view: a
      woman with a wretched home like that must have a man with
      whom she is friends. I think it was a pure and beautiful
      affection between Babs and Woof-dog, such as any woman,
      even if she was happily married, might be proud to enjoy.
      There can be no doubt of Lord Middlesex's devotion to her,
      and really--I hope this does not shock you--what their
      relations were concerns nobody but them. George Sands and
      Chopin, you know. Nelson and Lady Hamilton. Sir Andrew
      Moss--he was the Judge, you know--dined here the other
      night; I'm sure he is broad-minded. He gave me an admission
      card to the court. . . . Ah, Stephen, there you are. Come
      in, my dear. You know Lady Brixton, don't you? We were
      talking of Babs Shyton. Bring up your chair. Let me see, no
      sugar, isn't it? How you scolded me when I put sugar into
      your tea by mistake the other day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She held Stephen's hand for as long as anybody might, or,
      as Browning says, "so very little longer," and Adele saw a
      look of faint surprise on his face. It was not alarm, it
      was not rapture, it was just surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you there?" he said. "No verdict yet, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not till to-morrow, but then you will see. Adele has been
      horrid about her, quite horrid, and I have been preaching
      to her. I shall certainly ask Babs to dine some night soon,
      and you shall come, if you can spare an evening, but we
      won't ask Adele. Tell me the news, Stephen. I've been in
      Court all day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia's quite misunderstood me," said Adele. "My sympathy
      is entirely with Babs: all I blame her for is being found
      out. If you and I had an affair, Mr. Merriall, we should
      receive the envious sympathy of everybody, until we were
      officially brought to book. But then we should acquiesce in
      even our darling Lucia's cutting us. And if you had an
      affair with anybody else--I'm sure you've got hundreds--I
      and everybody else would be ever so pleased and interested,
      until--Mark that word 'until.' Now I must go, and leave you
      two to talk me well over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia rose, making affectionate but rather half-hearted
      murmurs to induce her to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must you really be going, Adele?" she said. "Let me see,
      what am I doing to-morrow--Stephen, what is to-morrow, and
      what am I doing? Ah yes, Bertie Alton's private view in the
      morning. We shall be sure to meet there, Adele. The wretch
      has done two caricatures of Pepino and me. I feel as if I
      was to be flayed in the sight of all London. Au revoir,
      then, dear Adele, if you're so tired of us. And then the
      opera in the evening: I shall hardly dare to show my face.
      Your motor's here, is it? Ring, Stephen, will you. Such a
      short visit, and I expect Olga will pop in presently. All
      sorts of messages to her, I suppose. Look in again, Adele:
      propose yourself."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      On the doorstep Adele met Tony Limpsfield. She hurried him
      into her motor, and told the chauffeur not to drive on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "News!" she said. "Lucia's going to have a lover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Tony in the Riseholme manner
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I tell you she is. He's with her now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They won't want me then," said Tony. "And yet she asked me
      to come at half-past five."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, my dear. They will want you, both of them. . . .
      Oh Tony, don't you see? It's a stunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony assumed the rapt expression of Luciaphils receiving
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me all about it," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure I'm right," said she. "Her poppet came in just
      now, and she held his hand as women do, and made him draw
      his chair up to her, and said he scolded her. I'm not sure
      that he knows yet. But I saw that he guessed something was
      up. I wonder if he's clever enough to do it properly. . . .
      I wish she had chosen you, Tony, you'd have done it
      perfectly. They have got--don't you understand?--to have
      the appearance of being lovers, everyone must think they
      are lovers, while all the time there's nothing at all of
      any sort in it. It's a stunt: it's a play: it's a glory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But perhaps there is something in it," said Tony. "I
      really think I had better not go in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tony, trust me. Lucia has no more idea of keeping a real
      lover than of keeping a chimpanzee. She's as chaste as
      snow, a kiss would scorch her. Besides, she hasn't time.
      She asked Stephen there in order to show him to me, and to
      show him to you. It's the most wonderful plan; and it's
      wonderful of me to have understood it so quickly. You must
      go in: there's nothing private of any kind: indeed, she
      thirsts for publicity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her confidence inspired confidence, and Tony was naturally
      consumed with curiosity. He got out, told Adele's chauffeur
      to drive on, and went upstairs. Stephen was no longer
      sitting in the chair next to Lucia, but on the sofa at the
      other side of the tea-table. This rather looked as if Adele
      was right: it was consistent anyhow with their being lovers
      in public, but certainly not lovers in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Lord Tony," said Lucia--this appellation was a
      halfway house between Lord Limpsfield and Tony, and she
      left out the "Lord" except to him--"how nice of you to drop
      in. You have just missed Adele. Stephen, you know Lord
      Limpsfield?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave him his tea, and presently getting up, reseated
      herself negligently on the sofa beside Stephen. She was a
      shade too close at first, and edged slightly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful play of Tchekov's the other day," she said.
      "Such a strange, unhappy atmosphere. We came out, didn't
      we, Stephen, feeling as if we had been in some remote
      dream. I saw you there, Lord Tony, with Adele who had been
      lunching with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony knew that: was not that the birthday of the
      Luciaphils?
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a dream I wasn't sorry to wake from," he said. "I
      found it a boring dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, how can you say so? Such an experience! I felt as if
      the woe of a thousand years had come upon me, some old
      anguish which I had forgotten. With the effect, too, that I
      wanted to live more fully and vividly than ever, till the
      dusk closed round."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen waved his hands, as he edged a little further away
      from Lucia. There was something strange about Lucia to-day.
      In those few minutes when they had been alone she had been
      quite normal, but both before, when Adele was here, and now
      after Lord Limpfield's entry, she seemed to be implying a
      certain intimacy, to which he felt he ought to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morbid fancies, Lucia," he said, "I shan't let you go to a
      Tchekov play again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horrid boy," said Lucia daringly. "But that's the way with
      all you men. You want women to be gay and bright and
      thoughtless, and have no other ideas except to amuse you. I
      shan't ever talk to either of you again about my real
      feelings. We will talk about the trial to-day. My entire
      sympathies are with Babs, Lord Tony. I'm sure yours are
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Limpsfield left Stephen there when he took his leave,
      after a quarter of an hour's lighter conversation, and as
      nobody else dropped in, Lucia only asked her lover to dine
      on two or three nights the next week, to meet her at the
      private view of Herbert Alton's Exhibition next morning,
      and let him go in a slightly bewildered frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen walked slowly up the Brompton Road, looking into
      the shop windows, and puzzling this out. She had held his
      hand oddly, she had sat close to him on the sofa, she had
      waved a dozen of those little signals of intimacy which
      gave colour to a supposition which, though it did not
      actually make his blood run cold, certainly did not make it
      run hot. . . . He and Lucia were excellent friends, they
      had many tastes in common, but Stephen knew that he would
      sooner never see her again than have an intrigue with her.
      He was no hand, to begin with, at amorous adventures, and
      even if he had been he could not conceive a woman more
      ill-adapted to dally with than Lucia. "Galahad and Artemis
      would make a better job of it than Lucia and me," he
      muttered to himself, turning hastily away from a window
      full of dainty underclothing for ladies. In vain he
      searched the blameless records of his intercourse with
      Lucia: he could not accuse himself of thought, word or deed
      which could possibly have given rise to any disordered
      fancy of hers that he observed her with a lascivious eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows I am innocent," he said to himself, and froze
      with horror at the sudden sight of a large news-board on
      which was printed in large capitals "Babs wants Woof-dog on
      the hearthrug."
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew he had no taste for gallantry, and he felt morally
      certain that Lucia hadn't either. . . . What then could she
      mean by those little tweaks and pressures? Conning them
      over for the second time, it struck him more forcibly than
      before that she had only indulged in these little
      licentiousnesses when there was someone else present.
      Little as he knew of the ways of lovers, he always imagined
      that they exchanged such tokens chiefly in private, and in
      public only when their passions had to find a small
      safety-valve. Again, if she had had designs on his virtue,
      she would surely, having got him alone, have given a
      message to her servants that she was out and not have had
      Lord Limpsfield admitted. . . . He felt sure she was up to
      something, but to his dull male sense, it was at present
      wrapped in mystery. He did not want to give up all those
      charming hospitalities of hers, but he must needs be very
      circumspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, without much misgiving that he awaited her
      next morning at the doors of the little Rutland Gallery,
      for he felt safe in so public a place as a private view.
      Only a few early visitors had come in when Lucia arrived,
      and as she passed the turnstile showing the two cards of
      invitation for herself and Pepino, impersonated by Stephen,
      she asked for hers back, saying that she was only going to
      make a short visit now and would return later. She had not
      yet seen the caricature of herself and Pepino, for which
      Bertie Alton (she still stuck to this little mistake) had
      accepted a commission, and she made her way at once to
      Numbers 39 and 40, which her catalogue told her were of Mr.
      and Mrs. Philip Lucas. Subjoined to their names were the
      captions, and she read with excitement that Pepino was
      supposed to be saying "At whatever personal inconvenience I
      must live up to Lucia," while below Number 40 was the
      enticing little legend "Oh, these duchesses! They give one
      no peace!" . . . And there was Pepino, in the knee-breeches
      of levee dress, tripping over his sword which had got
      entangled with his legs, and a cocked-hat on the back of
      his head, with his eyes very much apart, and no nose, and a
      small agonized hole in his face for a mouth. . . . And
      there was she with a pile of opened letters on the floor,
      and a pile of unopened letters on the table. There was not
      much of her face to be seen, for she was talking into a
      telephone, but her skirt was very short, and so was her
      hair, and there was a wealth of weary resignation in the
      limpness of her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia examined them both carefully, and then gave a long
      sigh of perfect happiness. That was her irrepressible
      comment: she could not have imagined anything more ideal.
      Then she gave a little peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, Stephen," she said. "Bobbie--I mean Bertie--really
      is too wicked for anything! Really, outrageous! I am
      furious with him, and yet I can't help laughing. Poor
      Pepino, and poor me! Marcia will adore it. She always says
      she can never get hold of me nowadays."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a swift scrutiny to the rest of the collection,
      so as to be able to recognise them all without reference to
      her catalogue, when she came back, as she intended to do
      later in the morning. There was hardly anyone here at
      present, but the place would certainly be crowded an hour
      before lunch time, and she proposed to make a
      <i>soi-disant</i> first visit then, and know at once whom
      all the caricatures represented (for Bertie in his
      enthusiasm for caricature sometimes omitted likenesses),
      and go into peals of laughter at those of herself and
      Pepino, and say she must buy them, which of course she had
      already done. Stephen remained behind, for Hermione was
      going to say a good deal about the exhibition, but promised
      to wait till Lucia came back. She had not shown the
      smallest sign of amorousness this morning. His
      apprehensions were considerably relieved, and it looked as
      if no storm of emotion was likely to be required of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hundreds of things to do!" she said. "Let me see,
      half-past eleven, twelve--yes, I shall be back soon after
      twelve, and we'll have a real look at them. And you'll
      lunch? Just a few people coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Lucia got back, the gallery had got thick with
      visitors, and Hermione was busy noting those whom he saw
      chatting with friends or looking lovely, or being very
      pleased with the new house in Park Lane, or receiving
      congratulations on the engagement of a daughter. There was
      no doubt which of the pictures excited most interest, and
      soon there was a regular <i>queue</i> waiting to look at
      Numbers 39 and 40. People stood in front of them regarding
      them gravely and consulting their catalogues and then
      bursting into loud cracks of laughter and looking again
      till the growing weight of the <i>queue</i> dislodged them.
      One of those who lingered longest and stood her ground best
      was Adele, who, when she was eventually shoved on, ran
      round to the tail of the <i>queue</i> and herself shoved
      till she got opposite again. She saw Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, then Lucia won't be far off," she observed archly.
      "Doesn't she adore it? Where is Lucia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's been, but she's coming back," he said. "I expect her
      every minute. Ah! there she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was rather stupid of Stephen. He ought to have guessed
      that Lucia's second appearance was officially intended to
      be her first. He grasped that when she squeezed her way
      through the crowd and greeted him as if they had not met
      before that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And dearest Adele," she said. "What a crush! Tell me
      quickly, where are the caricatures of Pepino and me? I'm
      dying to see them; and when I see them no doubt I shall
      wish I was dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of Luciaphilism came into Adele's intelligent
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll look for them together," she said. "Ah thirty-nine
      and forty. They must be somewhere just ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia exerted a steady indefatigable pressure on those in
      front, and presently came into range.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I never!" she said. "Oh, but so like Pepino! How
      could Bertie have told he got his sword entangled just like
      that? And look what he says. . . . Oh, and then Me! Just
      because I met him at Marcia's party and people were wanting
      to know when I had an evening free! Of all the
      impertinences! How I shall scold him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did it quite admirably in blissful unconsciousness
      that Adele knew she had been here before. She laughed, she
      looked again and laughed again ("Mrs. Lucas and Lady
      Brixton in fits of merriment over the cartoon of Mr. Lucas
      and herself," thought Hermione.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, and there's Lord Hurtacombe," she said. "I'm sure
      that's Lord Hurtacombe, though you can't see much of him,
      and, look, Olga surely, is it not? How does he do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a very clever identification for one who had not
      previously studied the catalogue, for Olga's face consisted
      entirely of a large open mouth and the tip of a chin, it
      might have been the face of anybody yawning. Her arms were
      stretched wide, and she towered above a small man in
      shorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last scene in Siegfried, I'm sure," said Lucia. "What
      does the catalogue say, Stephen? Yes, I am right.
      'Siegfried! Brunnhilde!' How wicked, is it not? But
      killing! Who could be cross with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all splendid stuff for Luciaphils; it was amazing
      how at a first glance she recognised everybody. The
      gallery, too, was full of dears and darlings of a few
      weeks' standing, and she completed a little dinner-party
      for next Tuesday long before she had made the circuit. All
      the time she kept Stephen by her side, looked over his
      catalogue, put a hand on his arm to direct his attention to
      some picture, took a speck of alien material off his
      sleeve, and all the time the entranced Adele felt
      increasingly certain that she had plumbed the depth of the
      adorable situation. Her sole anxiety was as to whether
      Stephen would plumb it too. He might--though he didn't look
      like it--welcome these little tokens of intimacy as
      indicating something more, and when they were alone attempt
      to kiss her, and that would ruin the whole exquisite
      design. Luckily his demeanour was not that of a favoured
      swain; it was, on the other hand, more the demeanour of a
      swain who feared to be favoured, and if that shy thing took
      fright, the situation would be equally ruined. . . . To
      think that the most perfect piece of Luciaphilism was
      dependent on the just perceptions of Stephen! As the three
      made their slow progress, listening to Lucia's brilliant
      identifications, Adele willed Stephen to understand; she
      projected a perfect torrent of suggestion towards his mind.
      He must, he should understand. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Fervent desire, so every psychist affirms, is never barren.
      It conveys something of its yearning to the consciousness
      to which it is directed, and there began to break on the
      dull male mind what had been so obvious to the finer
      feminine sense of Adele. Once again, and in the blaze of
      publicity, Lucia was full of touches and tweaks, and the
      significance of them dawned, like some pale, austere
      sunrise, on his darkened senses. The situation was
      revealed, and he saw it was one with which he could easily
      deal. His gloomy apprehensions brightened, and he perceived
      that there would be no need, when he went to stay at
      Riseholme next, to lock his bedroom-door, a practice which
      was abhorrent to him, for fear of fire suddenly breaking
      out in the house. Last night he had had a miserable dream
      about what had happened when he failed to lock his door at
      The Hurst, but now he dismissed its haunting. These little
      intimacies of Lucia's were purely a public performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia, we must be off," he said loudly and confidently.
      "Pepino will wonder where we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He always bullies me like that, Adele," she said. "I must
      go: <i>au revoir,</i> dear. Tuesday next: just a few
      <i>intimes</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's relief was hardly less than Stephen's. He would
      surely not have said anything so indiscreet if he had been
      contemplating an indiscretion, and she had no fear that his
      hurry to be off was due to any passionate desire to embrace
      her in the privacy of her car. She believed he understood,
      and her belief felt justified when he proposed that the car
      should be opened.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Riseholme, in the last three weeks of social progress, had
      not occupied the front row of Lucia's thoughts, but the
      second row, so to speak, had been entirely filled with it,
      for, as far as the future dimly outlined itself behind the
      present, the plan was to go down there early in August, and
      remain there, with a few brilliant excursions till autumn
      peopled London again. She had hoped for a dash to Aix,
      where there would be many pleasant people, but Pepino had
      told her summarily that the treasury would not stand it.
      Lucia had accepted that with the frankest good-nature: she
      had made quite a gay little lament about it, when she was
      asked what she was going to do in August. "Ah, all you
      lucky rich people with money to throw about; we've got to
      go and live quietly at home," she used to say. "But I shall
      love it, though I shall miss you all dreadfully. Riseholme,
      dear Riseholme, you know, adorable, and all the delicious
      funny friends down there who spoil me so dreadfully. I
      shall have lovely tranquil days, with a trot across the
      Green to order fish, and a chat on the way, and my books
      and my piano, and a chair in the garden, and an early
      bed-time instead of all these late hours. An anchorite
      life, but if you have a week-end to spare between your Aix
      and your yacht and your Scotland, ah, how nice it would be
      if you just sent a postcard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they became anchorites, however, there was a long
      week-end for her and Pepino over the August bank-holiday,
      and Lucia looked forward to that with unusual excitement.
      Adele was the hostess, and the scene that immense
      country-house of hers in Essex. The whole world,
      apparently, was to be there, for Adele had said the house
      would be full; and it was to be a final reunion of the
      choicest spirits before the annual dispersion. Mrs.
      Garroby-Ashton had longed to be bidden, but was not, and
      though Lucia was sorry for dear Millicent's disappointment,
      she could not but look down on it, as a sort of perch far
      below her that showed how dizzily she herself had gone
      upwards. But she had no intention of dropping good kind
      Millie who was hopping about below: she must certainly come
      to The Hurst for a Sunday: that would be nice for her, and
      she would learn all about Adele's party.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were yet ten days before that, and the morning after
      the triumphant affair at the Rutland Gallery, Lucia heard a
      faint rumour, coming from nowhere in particular, that
      Marcia Whitby was going to give a very small and very
      wonderful dance to wind up the season. She had not seen
      much of Marcia lately, in other words she had seen nothing
      at all, and Lucia's last three invitations to her had been
      declined, one through a secretary, and two through a
      telephone. Lucia continued, however, to talk about her with
      unabated familiarity and affection. The next day the rumour
      became slightly more solid: Adele let slip some allusion to
      Marcia's ball, and hurriedly covered it up with talk of her
      own week-end. Lucia fixed her with a penetrating eye for a
      moment, but the eye failed apparently to penetrate: Adele
      went on gabbling about her own party, and took not the
      slightest notice of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in truth Adele's gabble was a frenzied and feverish
      man&oelig;uvre to get away from the subject of Marcia's
      ball. Marcia was no true Luciaphil; instead of feeling
      entranced pleasure in Lucia's successes and failures, her
      schemes and attainments and ambitions, she had lately been
      taking a high severe line about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's beyond a joke, Adele," she said. "I hear she's got a
      scrap-book, and puts in picture post-cards and photographs
      of country-houses, with dates below them to indicate she
      has been there--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Adele. "How heavenly of her. I must see it, or
      did you make it up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I didn't," said the injured Marcia. "And she's got
      in it a picture post-card of the moat-garden at Whitby with
      the date of the Sunday before last, when I had a party
      there and didn't ask her. Besides, she was in London at the
      time. And there's one of Buckingham Palace Garden, with the
      date of the last garden-party. Was she asked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't heard she was," said Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you may be sure she wasn't. She's beyond a joke, I
      tell you, and I'm not going to ask her to my dance. I
      won't, I won't--I will not. And she asked me to dine three
      times last week. It isn't fair: it's bullying. A
      weak-minded person would have submitted, but I'm not
      weak-minded, and I won't be bullied. I won't be forcibly
      fed, and I won't ask her to my dance. There!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be so unkind," said Adele. "Besides, you'll meet her
      down at my house only a few days afterwards, and it will be
      awkward. Everybody else will have been."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then she can pretend she has been exclusive," said
      Marcia snappily, "and she'll like that. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumours solidified into fact, and soon Lucia was forced
      to the dreadful conclusion that Marcia's ball was to take
      place without her. That was an intolerable thought, and she
      gave Marcia one more chance by ringing her up and inviting
      her to dinner on that night (so as to remind her she knew
      nothing about the ball), but Marcia's stony voice replied
      that most unfortunately she had a few people to dinner
      herself. Wherever she went (and where now did Lucia not
      go?) she heard talk of the ball, and the plethora of
      Princes and Princesses that were to attend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the thought of Princesses lightened the
      depression of this topic. Princess Isabel was rather
      seriously ill with influenza, so Lucia, driving down Park
      Lane, thought it would not be amiss to call and enquire how
      she was, for she had noticed that sometimes the papers
      recorded the names of enquirers. She did not any longer
      care in the least how Princess Isabel was; whether she died
      or recovered was a matter of complete indifference to her
      in her present embittered frame of mind, for the Princess
      had not taken the smallest notice of her all these weeks.
      However, there was the front-door open, for there were
      other enquirers on the threshold, and Lucia joined them.
      She presented her card, and asked in a trembling voice what
      news there was, and was told that the Princess was no
      better. Lucia bowed her head in resignation, and then,
      after faltering a moment in her walk, pulled herself
      together, and with a firmer step went back to her motor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this interlude her mind returned to the terrible
      topic. She was due at a drawing-room meeting at Sophy
      Alingsby's house to hear a lecture on psycho-analysis, and
      she really hardly felt up to it. But there would certainly
      be a quantity of interesting people there, and the lecture
      itself might possibly be of interest, and so before long
      she found herself in the black dining-room, which had been
      cleared for the purpose. With the self-effacing instincts
      of the English the audience had left the front row chairs
      completely unoccupied, and she got a very good place. The
      lecture had just begun, and so her entry was not unmarked.
      Stephen was there, and as she seated herself, she nodded to
      him, and patted the empty chair by her side with a
      beckoning gesture. Her lover, therefore, sidled up to her
      and took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia whistled her thoughts away from such ephemeral and
      frivolous subjects as dances, and tried to give Professor
      Bonstetter her attention. She felt that she had been living
      a very hectic life lately; the world and its empty vanities
      had been too much with her, and she needed some
      intellectual tonic. She had seen no pictures lately, except
      Bobbie (or was it Bertie?) Alton's, she had heard no music,
      she had not touched the piano herself for weeks, she had
      read no books, and at the most had skimmed the reviews of
      such as had lately appeared in order to be up to date and
      be able to reproduce a short but striking criticism or two
      if the talk became literary. She must not let the mere
      froth of living entirely conceal by its winking headiness
      of foam the true beverage below it. There was Sophy, with
      her hair over her eyes and her chin in her hand, dressed in
      a faded rainbow, weird beyond description, but rapt in
      concentration, while she herself was letting the notion of
      a dance to which she had not been asked and was clearly not
      to be asked, drive like a mist between her and these cosmic
      facts about dreams and the unconscious self. How curious
      that if you dreamed about boiled rabbit, it meant that
      sometime in early childhood you had been kissed by a
      poacher in a railway-carriage, and had forgotten all about
      it! What a magnificent subject for excited research
      psycho-analysis would have been in those keen intellectual
      days at Riseholme. . . . She thought of them now with a
      vague yearning for their simplicity and absorbing
      earnestness; of the hours she had spent with Georgie over
      piano-duets, of Daisy Quantock's ouija-board and
      planchette, of the museum with its mittens. Riseholme
      presented itself now as an abode of sweet peace, where
      there were no disappointments or heart-burnings, for sooner
      or later she had always managed to assert her will and
      constitute herself priestess of the current interests. . .
      . Suddenly the solution of her present difficulty flashed
      upon her. Riseholme. She would go to Riseholme: that would
      explain her absence from Marcia's stupid ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lecture came to an end, and with others she buzzed for
      a little while round Professor Bonstetter, and had a few
      words with her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too interesting: marvellous, was it not, dear Sophy?
      Boiled rabbit! How curious! And the outcropping of the
      unconscious in dreams. Explains so much about phobias:
      people who can't go in the tube. So pleased to have heard
      it. Ah, there's Aggie. Aggie darling! What a treat, wasn't
      it? Such a refreshment from our bustlings and
      runnings-about to get back into origins. I've got to fly,
      but I couldn't miss this. Dreadful overlapping all this
      afternoon, and poor Princess Isabel is no better. I just
      called on my way here, but I wasn't allowed to see her.
      Stephen, where is Stephen? See if my motor is there, dear.
      Au revoir! dear Sophy. We must meet again very soon. Are
      you going to Adele's next week? No? How tiresome! Wonderful
      lecture! Calming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia edged herself out of the room with these very hurried
      greetings, for she was really eager to get home. She found
      Pepino there, having tea peacefully all by himself, and
      sank exhausted in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me a cup of tea, strong tea, Pepino," she said. "I've
      been racketing about all day, and I feel done for. How I
      shall get through these next two or three days I really
      don't know. And London is stifling. You look worn out too,
      my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino acknowledged the truth of this. He had hardly had
      time even to go to his club this last day or two, and had
      been reflecting on the enormous strength of the weaker sex.
      But for Lucia to confess herself done for was a portentous
      thing: he could not remember such a thing happening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there are not many more days of it," he said. "Three
      more this week, and then Lady Brixton's party."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave several loud sneezes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a cold?" asked Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something extraordinarily like one," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia became suddenly alert again. She was sorry for
      Pepino's cold, but it gave her an admirable gambit for what
      she had made up her mind to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, that's enough," she said. "I won't have you
      flying about London with a bad cold coming on. I shall take
      you down to Riseholme to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but you can't, my dear," said he. "You've got your
      engagement-book full for the next three days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a lot of stupid things," said she. "And really, I tell
      you quite honestly, I'm fairly worn out. It'll do us both
      good to have a rest for a day or two. Now don't make
      objections. Let us see what I've got to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The days were pretty full (though, alas, Thursday evening
      was deplorably empty) and Lucia had a brisk half-hour at
      the telephone. To those who had been bidden here, and to
      those to whom she had been bidden, she gave the same
      excuse, namely, that she had been advised (by herself) two
      or three days complete rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang up The Hurst, to say that they were coming down
      to-morrow, and would bring the necessary attendants, she
      rang up Georgie (for she was not going to fall into
      <i>that</i> error again) and in a mixture of baby language
      and Italian, which he found very hard to understand, asked
      him to dine to-morrow night, and finally she scribbled a
      short paragraph to the leading morning papers to say that
      Mrs. Philip Lucas had been ordered to leave London for two
      or three days' complete rest. She had hesitated a moment
      over the wording of that, for it was Pepino who was much
      more in need of rest than she, but it would have been
      rather ludicrous to say that Mr. and Mrs. Philip Lucas were
      in need of a complete rest. . . . These announcements she
      sent by hand so that there might be no miscarriage in their
      appearance to-morrow morning. And then, as an afterthought,
      she rang up Daisy Quantock and asked her and Robert to
      lunch to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt much happier. She would not be at the fell
      Marcia's ball, because she was resting in the country.

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes before Lucia and Pepino drove off next
      morning from Brompton Square, Marcia observed Lucia's
      announcement in the <i>Morning Post.</i> She was a
      good-natured woman, but she had been goaded, and now that
      Lucia could goad her no more for the present, she saw no
      objection to asking her to her ball. She thought of
      telephoning, but there was the chance that Lucia had not
      yet started, so she sent her a card instead, directing it
      to 25 Brompton Square, saying that she was At Home,
      dancing, to have the honour to meet a string of exalted
      personages. If she had telephoned, no one knows what would
      have happened, whether Daisy would have had any lunch that
      day or Georgie any dinner that night, and what excuse Lucia
      would have made to them. . . . Adele and Tony Limpsfield,
      the most adept of all the Luciaphils, subsequently argued
      the matter out with much heat, but never arrived at a
      solution that they felt was satisfactory. But then Marcia
      did not telephone. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      The news that the two were coming down was, of course, all
      over Riseholme a few minutes after Lucia had rung Georgie
      up. He was in his study when the telephone bell rang, in
      the fawn-coloured Oxford trousers, which had been cut down
      from their monstrous proportions and fitted quite nicely,
      though there had been a sad waste of stuff. Robert
      Quantock, the wag who had danced a hornpipe when Georgie
      had appeared in the original voluminousness, was waggish
      again, when he saw the abbreviated garments, and <i>à
      propos</i> of nothing in particular had said "Home is the
      sailor, home from sea," and that was the epitaph on the
      Oxford trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had been busy indoors this afternoon, for he had
      been attending to his hair, and it was not quite dry yet,
      and the smell of the auburn mixture still clung to it. But
      the telephone was a trunk-call, and, whether his hair was
      dry or not, it must be attended to. Since Lucia had
      disappeared after that week-end party, he had had a line
      from her once or twice, saying that they must really settle
      when he would come and spend a few days in London, but she
      had never descended to the sordid mention of dates.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trunk-call, as far as he knew, could only be Lucia or
      Olga, and one would be interesting and the other
      delightful. It proved to be the interesting one, and though
      rather difficult to understand because of the aforesaid
      mixture of baby-talk and Italian, it certainly conveyed the
      gist of the originator's intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me so tired," Lucia said, "and it will be divine to get to
      Riseholme again. So come to 'ickle quiet din-din with me
      and Pepino to-morrow, Georgino. Shall want to hear all
      novelle--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the news," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie sat in the draught--it was very hot to-day--until
      the auburn mixture dried. He knew that Daisy Quantock and
      Robert were playing clock-golf on the other side of his
      garden paling, for their voices had been very audible.
      Daisy had not been weeding much lately but had taken to
      golf, and since all the authorities said that matches were
      entirely won or lost on the putting-green, she with her
      usual wisdom devoted herself to the winning factor in the
      game. Presently she would learn to drive and approach and
      niblick and that sort of thing, and then they would see. .
      . . She wondered how good Miss Wethered really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie, now dry, tripped out into the garden and shouted
      "May I come in?" That meant, of course, might he look over
      the garden-paling and talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy missed a very short putt, owing to the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, do," she said icily. "I supposed you would give me
      that, Robert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You supposed wrong," said Robert, who was now two up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie stepped on a beautiful pansy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia's coming down to-morrow," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy dropped her putter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Pepino," went on Georgie. "She says she's very tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All those duchesses," said Daisy. Robert Alton's cartoon
      had been reproduced in an illustrated weekly, but Riseholme
      up to this moment had been absolutely silent about it. It
      was beneath notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she's asked me to dinner to-morrow," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So she's not bringing down a party?" said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," remarked Robert, "if you are going on
      putting, or if you give me the match."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pouf!" said Daisy, just like that. "But tired, Georgie?
      What does that mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Georgie, "but that's what she said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means something else," said Daisy, "I can't tell you
      what, but it doesn't mean that. I suppose you've said
      you're engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No I haven't," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Vere came out from the house. In this dry weather her
      heels made no indentations on the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trunk-call, ma'am," she said to Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These tiresome interruptions," said Daisy, hurrying
      indoors with great alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie lingered. He longed to know what the trunk-call
      was, and was determined to remain with his head on the top
      of the paling till Daisy came back. So he made
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your lawn is better than mine," he said pleasantly to
      Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert was cross at this delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not saying much," he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say any more," said Georgie, rather nettled. "And
      there's the leather-jacket grub I see has begun on yours. I
      daresay there won't be a blade of grass left presently."
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert changed the conversation: there were bare patches.
      "The Museum insurance," he said. "I got the fire-policy
      this morning. The contents are the property of the four
      trustees, me and you and Daisy and Mrs. Boucher. The
      building is Colonel Boucher's, and that's insured
      separately. If you had a spark of enterprise about you, you
      would take a match, set light to the mittens, and hope for
      the best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're very tarsome and cross," said Georgie. "I should
      like to take a match and set light to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie hated rude conversations like this, but when Robert
      was in such a mood, it was best to be playful. He did not
      mean, in any case, to cease leaning over the garden paling
      till Daisy came back from her trunk-call.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beyond the mittens," began Robert, "and, of course, those
      three sketches of yours, which I daresay are
      masterpieces--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy bowled out of the dining-room and came with such
      speed down the steps that she nearly fell into the circular
      bed where the broccoli had been. (The mignonette there was
      poorish.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "At half-past one or two," said she, bursting with the news
      and at the same time unable to suppress her gift for
      withering sarcasm. "Lunch to-morrow. Just a picnic, you
      know, as soon as she happens to arrive. So kind of her.
      More notice than she took of me last time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia?" asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Let me see, I was putting, wasn't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you call it putting," said Robert. He was not often two
      up and he made the most of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I suppose you said you were engaged," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy did not trouble to reply at all. She merely went on
      putting. That was the way to deal with inquisitive
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This news, therefore, was very soon all over Riseholme, and
      next morning it was supplemented by the amazing
      announcement in <i>The Times, Morning Post, Daily
      Telegraph</i> and <i>Daily Mail</i> that Mrs. Philip Lucas
      had left London for two or three days' complete rest. It
      sounded incredible to Riseholme, but of course it might be
      true and, as Daisy had said, that the duchesses had been
      too much for her. (This was nearer the mark than the
      sarcastic Daisy had known, for it was absolutely and
      literally true that one Duchess had been too much for her.
      . . .) In any case, Lucia was coming back to them again,
      and though Riseholme was still a little dignified and
      reticent, Georgie's acceptance of his dinner-invitation,
      and Daisy's of her lunch invitation, were symptomatic of
      Riseholme's feelings. Lucia had foully deserted them, she
      had been down here only once since that fatal accession to
      fortune, and on that occasion had evidently intended to see
      nothing of her old friends while that Yahoo party ("Yahoo"
      was the only word for Mrs. Alingsby) was with her; she had
      laughed at their Museum, she had courted the vulgar
      publicity of the press to record her movements in London,
      but Riseholme was really perfectly willing to forget and
      forgive if she behaved properly now. For, though no one
      would have confessed it, they missed her more and more. In
      spite of all her bullying monarchical ways, she had
      initiative, and though the excitement of the Museum and the
      Sagas from Abfou had kept them going for a while, it was
      really in relation to Lucia that these enterprises had been
      interesting. Since then, too, Abfou had been full of vain
      repetitions, and no one could go on being excited by his
      denunciation of Lucia as a snob, indefinitely. Lucia had
      personality, and if she had been here and had taken to golf
      Riseholme would have been thrilled at her skill, and have
      exulted over her want of it, whereas Daisy's wonderful
      scores at clock-golf (she was off her game to-day) produced
      no real interest. Degrading, too, as were the records of
      Lucia's movements in the columns of Hermione, Riseholme had
      been thrilled (though disgusted) by them, because they were
      about Lucia, and though she was coming down now for
      complete rest (whatever that might mean), the mere fact of
      her being here would make things hum. This time too she had
      behaved properly (perhaps she had learned wisdom) and had
      announced her coming, and asked old friends in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgiveness, therefore, and excitement were the prevalent
      emotions in the morning parliament on the Green next day.
      Mrs. Boucher alone expressed grave doubts on the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe she's ill," she said. "If she's ill, I
      shall be very sorry, but I don't believe it. If she is, Mr.
      Georgie, I'm all for accepting her gift of the spit to the
      Museum, for it would be unkind not to. You can write and
      say that the Committee have reconsidered it and would be
      very glad to have it. But let's wait to see if she's ill
      first. In fact, wait to see if she's coming at all, first."
    </p>
    <p>
      Piggy came whizzing up with news, while Goosie shouted it
      into her mother's ear-trumpet. Before Piggy could come out
      with it, Goosie's announcement was audible everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cab from the station has arrived at The Hurst, Mamma,"
      she yelled, "with the cook and the housemaid, and a
      quantity of luggage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Mrs. Boucher, have you heard the news?" panted Piggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear, I've just heard it," said Mrs. Boucher, "and
      it looks as if they were coming. That's all I can say. And
      if the cook's come by half-past eleven, I don't see why you
      shouldn't get a proper lunch, Daisy. No need for a cup of
      strong soup or a sandwich which I should have recommended
      if there had been no further news since you were asked to a
      picnic lunch. But if the cook's here now. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy was too excited to go home and have any serious
      putting and went off to the Museum. Mr. Rushbold, the
      Vicar, had just presented his unique collection of
      walking-sticks to it, and though the Committee felt it
      would be unkind not to accept them, it was difficult to
      know how to deal with them. They could not all be stacked
      together in one immense stick-stand, for then they could
      not be appreciated. The handles of many were curiously
      carved, some with gargoyle-heads of monsters putting out
      their tongues and leering, some with images of birds and
      fish, and there was one rather indelicate one, of a young
      man and a girl passionately embracing. . . . On the other
      hand, if they were spaced and leaned against the wall, some
      slight disturbance upset the equilibrium of one and it fell
      against the next, and the whole lot went down like
      ninepins. In fact, the boy at the turnstile said his entire
      time was occupied with picking them up. Daisy had a scheme
      of stretching an old lawn-tennis net against the wall, and
      tastefully entangling them in its meshes. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Riseholme lingered on the Green that morning long after one
      o'clock, which was its usual lunch-time, and at precisely
      twenty five minutes past they were rewarded. Out of the
      motor stepped Pepino in a very thick coat and a large
      muffler. He sneezed twice as he held out his arm to assist
      Lucia to alight. She clung to it, and leaning heavily on it
      went with faltering steps past Perdita's garden into the
      house. So she was ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, Daisy and Robert Quantock were seated at
      lunch with them. Lucia certainly looked very well and she
      ate her lunch very properly, but she spoke in a slightly
      faded voice, as befitted one who had come here for complete
      rest. "But Riseholme, dear Riseholme will soon put me all
      right again," she said. "Such a joy to be here! Any news,
      Daisy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Really there was very little. Daisy ran through such topics
      as had interested Riseholme during those last weeks, and
      felt that the only thing which had attracted true,
      feverish, Riseholme-attention was the record of Lucia's own
      movements. Apart from this there was only her own putting,
      and the embarrassing gift of walking-sticks to the Museum.
      . . . But then she remembered that the Committee had
      authorised the acceptance of the Elizabethan spit, if Lucia
      seemed ill, and she rather precipitately decided that she
      was ill enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we've been busy over the Museum," she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, the dear Museum," said Lucia wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      That quite settled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should so like to accept the Elizabethan spit, if we
      may," said Daisy. "It would be a great acquisition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; delighted," said Lucia. "I will have it sent
      over. Any other gifts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy went on to the walking-sticks, omitting all mention
      of the indelicate one in the presence of gentlemen, and
      described the difficulty of placing them satisfactorily.
      They were eighty-one (including the indelicacy) and a
      lawn-tennis net would barely hold them. The invalid took
      but a wan interest in this, and Daisy's putting did not
      rouse much keener enthusiasm. But soon she recovered a
      greater animation and was more herself. Indeed, before the
      end of lunch it had struck Daisy that Pepino was really the
      invalid of the two. He certainly had a prodigious cold, and
      spoke in a throaty wheeze that was scarcely audible. She
      wondered if she had been a little hasty about accepting the
      spit, for that gave Lucia a sort of footing in the Museum.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia recovered still further when her guests had gone, and
      her habitual energy began to assert itself. She had made
      her impressive invalid entry into Riseholme, which
      justified the announcement in the papers, and now, quietly,
      she must be on the move again. She might begin by getting
      rid, without delay, of that tiresome spit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I shall go out for a little drive, Pepino," she
      said, "though if I were you I would nurse my cold and get
      it all right before Saturday when we go to Adele's. The
      gardener, I think, could take the spit out of the chimney
      for me, and put it in the motor, and I would drop it at the
      Museum. I thought they would want it before long. . . . And
      that clock-golf of Daisy's; it sounds amusing; the sort of
      thing for Sunday afternoon if we have guests with us. I
      think she said that you could get the apparatus at the
      Stores. Little tournaments might be rather fun."
    </p>
    <p>
      The spit was easily removed, and Lucia, having written to
      the Stores for a set of clock-golf, had it loaded up on the
      motor, and conveyed to the Museum. So that was done. She
      waved and fluttered a hand of greeting to Piggy and Goosey
      who were gambolling on the Green, and set forth into the
      country, satisfied that she had behaved wisely in leaving
      London rather than being left out in London. Apart from
      that, too, it had been politic to come down to Riseholme
      again like this, to give them a taste of her quality before
      she resumed, in August, as she entirely meant to do, her
      ancient sway. She guessed from the paucity of news which
      that arch-gossip, dear Daisy, had to give, that things had
      been remarkably dull in her absence, and though she had
      made a sad mistake over her week-end party, a little
      propitiation would soon put that right. And Daisy had had
      nothing to say about Abfou: they seemed to have got a
      little tired of Abfou. But Abfou might be revived:
      clock-golf and a revival of ouija would start August very
      pleasantly. She would have liked Aix better, but Pepino was
      quite clear about that. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was agreeably surprised to find her so much herself
      when he came over for dinner. Pepino, whose cold was still
      extremely heavy, went to bed very soon after, and he and
      Lucia settled themselves in the music room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First a little chat, Georgie," she said, "and then I
      insist on our having some music. I've played nothing
      lately, you will find me terribly out of practice, but you
      mustn't scold me. Yes, the spit has gone: dear Daisy said
      the Museum was most anxious to get it, and I took it across
      myself this afternoon. I must see what else I can find
      worthy of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all rather splendid. Lucia had a glorious way of
      completely disregarding the past, and pushing on ahead into
      the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you been playing much lately?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly a note," said Georgie, "there is nobody to play
      with. Piggy wanted to do some duets, but I said 'No,
      thanks.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, you've been lazy," she said, "there's been nobody
      to keep you up to the mark. And Olga? Has Olga been down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not since--not since that Sunday when you were both down
      together," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very wrong of her to have deserted Riseholme. But just as
      wrong of me, you will say. But now we must put our heads
      together and make great plans for August. I shall be here
      to bully you all August. Just one visit, which Pepino and I
      are paying to dear Adele Brixton on Saturday, and then you
      will have me here solidly. London? Yes, it has been great
      fun, though you and I never managed to arrange a date for
      your stay with us. That must come in the autumn when we go
      up in November. But, oh, how tired I was when we settled to
      leave town yesterday. Not a kick left in me. Lots of
      engagements, too, and I just scrapped them. But people must
      be kind to me and forgive me. And sometimes I feel that
      I've been wasting time terribly. I've done nothing but see
      people, people, people. All sorts, from Alf Watson the
      pugilist--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Georgie, beginning to feel the thrill of Lucia
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he came to dine with me, such a little duck, and
      brought his flute. There was a great deal of talk about my
      party for Alf, and how the women buzzed round him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who else?" said Georgie greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, who <i>not</i> else? Marcelle--Marcelle Periscope
      came another night, Adele, Sophy Alingsby, Bertie Alton,
      Aggie--I must ask dear Aggie down here; Tony--Tony
      Limpsfield; a thousand others. And then of course dear
      Marcia Whitby often. She is giving a ball to-morrow night.
      I should like to have been there, but I was just
      <i>finito.</i> Ah, and your friend Princess Isabel. Very
      bad influenza. You should ring up her house, Georgie, and
      ask how she is. I called there yesterday. So sad! But let
      us talk of more cheerful things. Daisy's clock-golf: I must
      pop in and see her at it to-morrow. She is wonderful, I
      suppose. I have ordered a set from the Stores, and we will
      have great games."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's been doing nothing else for weeks," said Georgie. "I
      daresay she's very good, but nobody takes any interest in
      it. She's rather a bore about it--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, don't be unkind about poor Daisy," said Lucia.
      "We must start little competitions, with prizes. Do you
      have partners? You and I will be partners at mixed putting.
      And what about Abfou?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Georgie that this was just the old Lucia, and
      so no doubt it was. She was intending to bag any
      employments that happened to be going about and claim them
      as her own. It was larceny, intellectual and physical
      larceny, no doubt, but Lucia breathed life into those dead
      bones and made them interesting. It was weary work to watch
      Daisy dabbing away with her putter and then trying to beat
      her score without caring the least whether you beat it or
      not. And Daisy even telephoned her more marvellous feats,
      and nobody cared how marvellous they were. But it would be
      altogether different if Lucia was the goddess of putting. .
      . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't Abfou'd for ages," said Georgie. "I fancy she
      has dropped it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we must pick everything up again," said Lucia
      briskly, "and you shan't be lazy any more, Georgie. Come
      and play duets. My dear piano! What shall we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They did quantities of things, and then Lucia played the
      slow movement of the Moonlight Sonata, and Georgie sighed
      as usual, and eventually Lucia let him out and walked with
      him to the garden gate. There were quantities of stars, and
      as usual she quoted 'See how the floor of heaven is thick
      inlaid . . .' and said she must ring him up in the morning,
      after a good night's rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a light in Daisy's drawing-room, and just as he
      came opposite it she heard his step, for which she had long
      been listening, and looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it Georgie?" she said, knowing perfectly well that it
      must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Georgie. "How late you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how is Lucia?" asked Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie quite forgot for the moment that Lucia was having
      complete rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent form," he said. "Such a talk, and such a music."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are, then!" said Daisy. "There's nothing the
      matter with her. She doesn't want rest any more--than the
      moon. What does it mean, Georgie? Mark my words: it means
      something."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, indeed, seemed in no need whatever of complete rest
      the next day. She popped into Daisy's very soon after
      breakfast, and asked to be taught how to putt. Daisy gave
      her a demonstration, and told her how to hold the putter
      and where to place her feet, and said it was absolutely
      essential to stand like a rock and to concentrate. Nobody
      could putt if anyone spoke. Eventually Lucia was allowed to
      try, and she stood all wrong and grasped her putter like an
      umbrella, and holed out of the longest of putts in the
      middle of an uninterrupted sentence. Then they had a match,
      Daisy proposing to give her four strokes in the round,
      which Lucia refused, and Daisy, dithering with excitement
      and superiority, couldn't putt at all. Lucia won easily,
      with Robert looking on, and she praised Daisy's putter, and
      said it was beautifully balanced, though where she picked
      that up Daisy couldn't imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now I must fly," said Lucia, "and we must have a
      return match sometime. So amusing! I have sent for a set,
      and you will have to give me lessons. Good-bye, dear Daisy,
      I'm away for the Sunday at dear Adele Brixton's, but after
      that how lovely to settle down at Riseholme again! You must
      show me your ouija-board too. I feel quite rested this
      morning. Shall I help you with the walking-sticks later
      on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy went uneasily back to her putting: it was too awful
      that Lucia in that amateurish manner should have beaten a
      serious exponent of the art, and already, in dark
      anticipation, she saw Lucia as the impresario of
      clock-golf, popularising it in Riseholme. She herself would
      have to learn to drive and approach without delay, and make
      Riseholme take up real golf, instead of merely putting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia visited the Museum next, and arranged the spit in an
      empty and prominent place between Daisy's fossils and
      Colonel Boucher's fragments of Samian ware. She attended
      the morning parliament on the Green, and walked beside Mrs.
      Boucher's bath-chair. She shouted into Mrs. Antrobus's
      ear-trumpet, she dallied with Piggy and Goosie, and never
      so much as mentioned a duchess. All her thoughts seemed
      wrapped up in Riseholme; just one tiresome visit lay in
      front of her, and then, oh, the joy of settling down here
      again! Even Mrs. Boucher felt disarmed; little as she would
      have thought it, there was something in Lucia beyond mere
      snobbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie popped in that afternoon about teatime. The
      afternoon was rather chilly, and Lucia had a fire lit in
      the grate of the music-room, which, now that the spit had
      been removed, burned beautifully. Pepino, drowsy with his
      cold, sat by it, while the other two played duets. Already
      Lucia had taken down Sigismund's portrait and installed
      Georgie's water-colours again by the piano. They had had a
      fine tussle over the Mozart duet, and Georgie had promised
      to practise it, and Lucia had promised to practise it, and
      she had called him an idle boy, and he had called her a
      lazy girl, quite in the old style, while Pepino dozed. Just
      then the evening post came in, with the evening paper, and
      Lucia picked up the latter to see what Hermione had said
      about her departure from London. Even as she turned back
      the page her eye fell on two or three letters which had
      been forwarded from Brompton Square. The top one was a
      large square envelope, the sort of fine thick envelope that
      contained a rich card of invitation, and she opened it.
      Next moment she sprang from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pepino, dear," she cried. "Marcia! Her ball. Marcia's ball
      to-night!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino roused himself a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ball? What ball?" he said. "No ball. Riseholme."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia pushed by Georgie on the treble music stool, without
      seeming to notice that he was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No dear, of course you won't go," she said. "But do you
      know, I think I shall go up and pop in for an hour. Georgie
      will come to dine with you, won't you, Georgie, and you'll
      go to bed early. Half past six! Yes, I can be in town by
      ten. That will be heaps of time. I shall dress at Brompton
      Square. Just a sandwich to take with me and eat it in the
      car."
    </p>
    <p>
      She wheeled round to Georgie, pressing the bell in her
      circumvolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marcia Whitby," she said. "Winding up the season. So easy
      to pop up there, and dear Marcia would be hurt if I didn't
      come. Let me see, shall I come back to-morrow, Pepino?
      Perhaps it would be simpler if I stayed up there and sent
      the car back. Then you could come up in comfort next day,
      and we would go on to Adele's together. I have a host of
      things to do in London to-morrow. That party at Aggie's. I
      will telephone to Aggie to say that I can come after all.
      My maid, my chauffeur," she said to the butler, rather in
      the style of Shylock. "I want my maid and my chauffeur and
      my car. Let him have his dinner quickly--no, he can get his
      dinner at Brompton Square. Tell him to come round at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie sat positively aghast, for Lucia ran on like a
      thing demented. Mozart, ouija, putting, the Elizabethan
      spit, all the simple joys of Riseholme fizzled out like
      damp fireworks. Gone, too, utterly gone was her need of
      complete rest; she had never been so full of raw, blatant,
      savage vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Marcia," she said. "I felt it must be an oversight
      from the first, but naturally, Georgie, though she and I
      are such friends, I could not dream of reminding her. What
      a blessing that my delicious day at Riseholme has so rested
      me: I feel I could go to fifty balls without fatigue. Such
      a wonderful house, Georgie; when you come up to stay with
      us in the autumn, I must take you there. Pepino, is it not
      lucky that I only brought down here just enough for a
      couple of nights, and left everything in London to pick up
      as we came through to go to Adele's? What a sight it will
      be, all the Royal Family almost I believe, and the whole of
      the Diplomatic corps: my Gioconda, I know, is going. Not a
      large ball though at all: not one of those great
      promiscuous affairs, which I hate so. How dear Marcia was
      besieged for invitations! how vulgar people are and how
      pushing! Goody-bye, mind you practise your Mozart, Georgie.
      Oh, and tell Daisy that I shan't be able to have another of
      those delicious puttings with her to-morrow. Back on
      Tuesday after the week-end at Adele's, and then weeks and
      weeks of dear Riseholme. How long they are! I will just go
      and hurry my maid up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie tripped off, as soon as she had gone, to see Daisy,
      and narrated to her open-mouthed disgust this amazing
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the question is," he said, "about the complete rest
      that was ordered her. I don't believe she was ordered any
      rest at all. I believe--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy gave a triumphant crow: inductive reasoning had led
      her to precisely the same point at precisely the same
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course!" she said. "I always felt there was
      something behind that complete rest. I told you it meant
      something different. She wasn't asked, and so--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so she came down here for rest," said Georgie in a
      loud voice. He was determined to bring that out first.
      "Because she wasn't asked--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the moment she was asked she flew," said Daisy.
      "Nothing could be plainer. No more rest, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's wonderful," said Georgie. "Too interesting!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sped through the summer evening on this errand of her
      own reprieve, too excited to eat, and too happy to wonder
      how it had happened like this. How wise, too, she had been
      to hold her tongue and give way to no passionate laments at
      her exclusion from the paradise towards which she was now
      hastening. Not one word of abuse had she uttered against
      Marcia: she had asked nobody to intercede: she had joined
      in all the talk about the ball as if she was going, and
      finally had made it impossible for herself to go by
      announcing that she had been ordered a few days of complete
      rest. She could (and would) explain her appearance
      perfectly: she had felt much better--doctors were such
      fussers--and at the last moment had made just a little
      effort, and here she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud explosion interrupted these agreeable reflections
      and the car drew up. A tyre had burst, but they carried an
      extra wheel, and though the delay seemed terribly long they
      were soon on their way again. They traversed another ten
      miles, and now in the north-east the smouldering glow of
      London reddened the toneless hue of the summer night. The
      stars burned bright, and she pictured Pepino at his
      telescope--no, Pepino had a really bad cold, and would not
      be at his telescope. Then there came another explosion--was
      it those disgusting stars in their courses that were
      fighting against her?--and again the car drew up by the
      side of the empty road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened?" asked Lucia in a strangled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another tyre gone, ma'am," said the chauffeur. "Never knew
      such a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia looked at her clock. It was ten already, and she
      ought now to be in Brompton Square. There was no further
      wheel that could be put on, and the tyre had to be taken
      off and mended. The minutes passed like seconds. . . .
      Lucia, outwardly composed, sat on a rug at the edge of the
      road, and tried unsuccessfully not to curse Almighty
      Providence. The moon rose, like a gelatine lozenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to count the hours that intervened between the
      tragic present and, say, four o'clock in the morning, and
      she determined that whatever further disasters might
      befall, she would go to Whitby House, even if it was in a
      dustman's cart, so long as there was a chance of a single
      guest being left there. She would go. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time, if she had only known it, the stars were
      fighting not against her but for her. The tyre was mended,
      and she got to Brompton Square at exactly a quarter past
      eleven. Cupboards were torn open, drawers ransacked, her
      goaded maid burst into tears. Aunt Amy's pearls were
      clasped round her neck, Pepino's hair in the shrine of gold
      sausage that had once been Beethoven's was pinned on, and
      at five minutes past twelve she hurried up the great stairs
      at Whitby House. Precisely as she came to the door of the
      ballroom there emerged the head of the procession going
      down to supper. Marcia for a moment stared at her as if she
      was a ghost, but Lucia was so busy curtseying that she gave
      no thought to that. Seven times in rapid succession did she
      curtsey. It almost became a habit, and she nearly curtsied
      to Adele who (so like Adele) followed immediately after.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just up from Riseholme, dearest Adele," she said. "I felt
      quite rested--How are you, Lord Tony?--and so I made a
      little effort. Pepino urged me to come. How nice to see
      your Excellency! Millie! Dearest Olga! What a lot of
      friends! How is poor Princess Isabel? Marcia looked so
      handsome. Brilliant! Such a delicious drive: I felt I had
      to pop in. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c09" id="c09">CHAPTER IX</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Pepino's cold next day, instead of being better, was a
      good deal worse. He had aches and pains, and felt feverish,
      and sent for the doctor, who peremptorily ordered him to go
      to bed. There was nothing in the least to cause alarm, but
      it would be the height of folly to go to any week-end party
      at all. Bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino telegraphed to Lady Brixton with many regrets for
      the unavoidable, and rang up Lucia. The state of his voice
      made it difficult to catch what he said, but she quite
      understood that there was nothing to be anxious about, and
      that he hoped she would go to Adele's without him. Her
      voice on the other hand was marvellously distinct, and he
      heard a great deal about the misfortunes which had come to
      so brilliant a conclusion last night. There followed a
      string of seven Christian names, and Lucia said a
      flashlight photograph had been permitted during supper. She
      thought she was in it, though rather in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was very sorry for Pepino's indisposition, but, as
      ordered, had no anxiety about him. She felt too, that he
      wouldn't personally miss very much by being prevented from
      coming to Adele's party, for it was to be a very large
      party, and Pepino--bless him--occasionally got a little
      dazed at these brilliant gatherings. He did not grasp who
      people were with the speed and certainty which were
      needful, and he had been known to grasp the hand of an
      eminent author and tell him how much he had admired his
      fine picture at the Academy. (Lucia constantly did that
      sort of thing herself, but then she got herself out of the
      holes she had herself digged with so brilliant a
      man&oelig;uvre that it didn't matter, whereas Pepino was
      only dazed the more by his misfortunes.) Moreover she knew
      that Pepino's presence somehow hampered her style: she
      could not be the brilliant mondaine, when his patient but
      proud eye was on her, with quite the dash that was hers
      when he was not there. There was always the sense that he
      knew her best in her Riseholme incarnation, in her duets
      with Georgie, and her rendering of the slow movement of the
      Moonlight Sonata, and her grabbing of all Daisy's little
      stunts. She electrified him as the superb butterfly, but
      the electrification was accompanied by slight shocks and
      surprises. When she referred by her Christian name to some
      woman with whom her only bond was that she had refused to
      dine at Brompton Square, that puzzled Pepino. . . . In the
      autumn she must be a little more serious, have some quiet
      dinner parties of ordinary people, for really up till now
      there had scarcely been an 'ordinary' person at Brompton
      Square at all, such noble lions of every species had been
      entrapped there. And Adele's party was to be of a very
      leonine kind; the smart world was to be there, and some
      highbrows and some politicians, and she was aware that she
      herself would have to do her very best, and be allusive,
      and pretend to know what she didn't know, and seem to swim
      in very distinguished currents. Dear Pepino wasn't up to
      that sort of thing, he couldn't grapple with it, and she
      grappled with it best without him. . . . At the moment of
      that vainglorious thought, it is probable that Nemesis
      fixed her inexorable eye on Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia unconscious of this deadly scrutiny turned to her
      immediate affairs. Her engagement-book pleasantly informed
      her that she had many things to do on the day when the need
      for complete rest overtook her, and now she heralded
      through the telephone the glad tidings that she could lunch
      here and drop in there, and dine with Aggie. All went well
      with these restorations, and the day would be full, and
      to-morrow also, down to the hour of her departure for
      Adele's. Having despatched this agreeable business, she was
      on the point of ringing up Stephen, to fit him in for the
      spare three-quarters of an hour that was left, when she was
      rung up and it was Stephen's voice that greeted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Stephano mio,"</i> she said. "How did you guess I was
      back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I rang up Riseholme first," said he, "and heard
      you had gone to town. Were you there last night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no cause to ask where "there" was. There had only
      been one place in London last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; delicious dance," said Lucia. "I was just going to
      ring you up and see if you could come round for a chat at
      4.45, I am free till 5.30. Such fun it was. A flashlight
      photograph."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Stephen in the Riseholme manner. "I long to hear
      about it. And were there really seven of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite," said Lucia magnificently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful! But 4.45 is no use for me. Can't you give me
      another time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, impossible," said Lucia. "You know what London is
      in these last days. Such a scrimmage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we shall meet to-morrow then," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, alas, I go to Adele's to-morrow," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but so do I," said Stephen. "She asked me this
      morning. I was wondering if you would drive me down, if
      you're going in your car. Would there be room for you and
      Pepino and me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia rapidly reviewed the situation. It was perfectly
      clear to her that Adele had asked Stephen, at the last
      moment, to fill Pepino's place. But naturally she had not
      told him that, and Lucia determined not to do so either. It
      would spoil his pleasure (at least it would have spoiled
      hers) to know that. . . . And what a wonderful entry it
      would make for her--rather daring--to drive down alone with
      her lover. She could tell him about Pepino's indisposition
      to-morrow, as if it had just occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Stephano, heaps of room," she said. "Delighted. I'll
      call for you, shall I, on my way down, soon after three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angelic," he said. "What fun we shall have."
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is probable that Nemesis at that precise moment
      licked her dry lips. 'Fun!' thought Nemesis.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Marcia Whitby was of the party. She went down in the
      morning, and lunched alone with Adele. Their main topic of
      conversation was obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw her announcement in the <i>Morning Post,"</i> said
      the infuriated Marcia, "that she had gone for a few days
      complete rest into the country, and naturally I thought I
      was safe. I was determined she shouldn't come to my ball,
      and when I saw that, I thought she couldn't. So out of
      sheer good nature I sent her a card, so that she could tell
      everybody she had been asked. Never did I dream that there
      was a possibility of her coming. Instead of which, she made
      the most conspicuous entry that she could have made. I
      believe she timed it: I believe she waited on the stairs
      till she saw we were going down to supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder!" said Adele. "Genius, if it was that. She
      curtsied seven times, too. I can't do that without loud
      cracks from my aged knees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she stopped till the very end," said Marcia. "She was
      positively the last to go. I shall never do a kind thing
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're horrid about her," said Adele. "Besides, what has
      she done? You asked her and she came. You don't rave at
      your guests for coming when they're asked. You wouldn't
      like it if none of them came."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's different," said Marcia. "I shouldn't wonder if she
      announced she was ordered complete rest in order that I
      should fall into her trap."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele sighed, but shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear, that <i>would</i> have been magnificent," she
      said. "But I'm afraid I can't hope to believe that. I
      daresay she went into the country because you hadn't asked
      her, and that was pretty good. But the other: no. However,
      we'll ask Tony what he thinks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's Tony got to do with it?" said Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, he's even more wrapped up in her than I am," said
      Adele. "He thinks of nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcia was silent a moment. Then a sort of softer gleam
      came into her angry eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me some more about her," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele clapped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's splendid," she said. "You're beginning to feel
      kinder. What we would do without our Lucia I can't imagine.
      I don't know what there would be to talk about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's ridiculous!" said Marcia relapsing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you mustn't feel that," said Adele. "You mustn't laugh
      at her ever. You must just richly enjoy her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a snob!" said Marcia, as if this was a tremendous
      discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I: so are you: so are we all," said Adele. "We all
      run after distinguished people like--like Alf and Marcelle.
      The difference between you and Lucia is entirely in her
      favour, for you pretend you're not a snob, and she is
      perfectly frank and open about it. Besides, what is a
      duchess like you for except to give pleasure to snobs?
      That's your work in the world, darling; that's why you were
      sent here. Don't shirk it, or when you're old you will
      suffer agonies of remorse. And you're a snob too. You liked
      having seven--or was it seventy?--Royals at your dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, tell me some more about Lucia," said Marcia, rather
      struck by this ingenious presentation of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I will: I long for your conversion to Luciaphilism.
      Now to-day there are going to be marvellous happenings. You
      see Lucia has got a lover--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite absolutely impossible!" said Marcia firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't interrupt. Of course he is only an official
      lover, a public lover, and his name is Stephen Merriall. A
      perfect lady. Now Pepino, Lucia's husband, was coming down
      with her to-day, but he's got a very bad cold and has put
      me off. I'm rather glad: Lucia has got more--more dash when
      he's not there. So I've asked her lover instead--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Marcia. "Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, they are much better than any play I have ever
      seen. They do it beautifully: they give each other little
      glances and smiles, and then begin to talk hurriedly to
      someone else. Of course, they're both as chaste as snow,
      chaster if possible. I think poor Babs's case put it into
      Lucia's head that in this naughty world it gave a
      <i>cachet</i> to a woman to have the reputation of having a
      lover. So safe too: there's nothing to expose. They only
      behave like lovers strictly in public. I was terrified when
      it began that Mr. Merriall would think she meant something,
      and try to kiss her when they were alone, and so rub the
      delicate bloom completely off, but I'm sure he's tumbled to
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How perfect!" said Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it? Aren't you feeling more Luciaphil? I'm sure you
      are. You must enjoy her: it shows such a want of humour to
      be annoyed with her. And really I've taken a great deal of
      trouble to get people she will revel in. There's the Prime
      Minister, there's you, there's Greatorex the pianist who's
      the only person who can play Stravinski, there's Professor
      Bonstetter the psycho-analyst, there's the Italian
      Ambassador, there's her lover, there's Tony. . . . I can't
      go on. Oh, and I must remember to tell her that Archie
      Singleton is Babs's brother, or she may say something
      dreadful. And then there are lots who will revel in Lucia,
      and I the foremost. I'm devoted to her; I am really,
      Marcia. She's got character, she's got an iron will, and I
      like strong talkative women so much better than strong
      silent men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she's got will," said Marcia. "She determined to come
      to my ball, and she came. I allow I gave her the chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those are the chances that come to gifted people," said
      Adele. "They don't come to ordinary people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose I flirted violently with her lover?" said Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele's eyes grew bright with thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't imagine what she would do," she said. "But I'm
      sure she would do something that scored. Otherwise she
      wouldn't be Lucia. But you mustn't do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just one evening," said Marcia. "Just for an hour or two.
      It's not poaching, you see, because her lover isn't her
      lover. He's just a stunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be wonderful to know what she would do," she
      said. "And it's true that he's only a stunt. Perhaps for an
      hour or two to-morrow, and then give him back."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Adele did not expect any of her guests till teatime, and
      Marcia and she both retired for after-lunch siestas. Adele
      had been down here for the last four or five days, driving
      up to Marcia's ball and back in the very early morning, and
      had three days before settled everything in connection with
      her party, assigning rooms, discussing questions of high
      importance with her chef, and arranging to meet as many
      trains as possible. It so happened, therefore, that Stephen
      Merriall, since the house was full, was to occupy the
      spacious dressing-room, furnished as a bedroom, next
      Lucia's room, which had been originally allotted to Pepino.
      Adele had told her butler that Mr. Lucas was not coming,
      but that his room would be occupied by Mr. Merriall,
      thought no more about it, and omitted to substitute a new
      card on his door. These two rooms were half way down a long
      corridor of bedrooms and bathrooms that ran the whole
      length of the house, a spacious oak-boarded corridor,
      rather dark, with the broad staircase coming up at the end
      of it. Below was the suite of public rooms, a library at
      the end, a big music-room, a long gallery of a
      drawing-room, and the dining-room. These all opened on to a
      paved terrace overlooking the gardens and tennis courts,
      and it was here, with the shadow of the house lying coolly
      across it, that her guests began to assemble. In ones and
      twos they gathered, some motoring down from London, others
      arriving by train, and it was not till there were some
      dozen of them, among whom were the most fervent Luciaphils,
      that the object of their devotion, attended by her lover,
      made her appearance, evidently at the top of her form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest Adele," she said. "How delicious to get into the
      cool country again. Marcia dear! Such adventures I had on
      my way up to your ball: two burst tyres: I thought I should
      never get there. How are you, your Excellency? I saw you at
      the Duchess's, but couldn't get a word with you. Aggie
      darling! Ah, Lord Tony! Yes, a cup of tea would be
      delicious; no sugar, Stephen, thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had not noticed quite everybody. There were one or
      two people rather retired from the tea-table, but they did
      not seem to be of much importance, and certainly the Prime
      Minister was not among them. Stephen hovered, loverlike,
      just behind her chair, and she turned to the Italian
      ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was afraid of a motor accident all the way down," she
      said, "because last night I dreamed I broke a
      looking-glass. Quaint things dreams are, though really the
      psycho-analysts who interpret them are quainter. I went to
      a meeting at Sophy's, dear Sophy Alingsby, the other
      day--your Excellency I am sure knows Sophy Alingsby--and
      heard a lecture on it. Let me see: boiled rabbit, if you
      dream of boiled rabbit--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia suddenly became aware of a sort of tension. Just a
      tension. She looked quickly round, and recognised one of
      the men she had not paid much attention to. She sprang from
      her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Professor Bonstetter," she said. "How are you? I know you
      won't remember me, but I did have the honour of shaking
      hands with you after your enthralling lecture the other
      day. Do come and tell his Excellency and me a little more
      about it. There were so many questions I longed to ask
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele wanted to applaud, but she had to be content with
      catching Marcia's eye. Was Lucia great, or was she not?
      Stephen too: how exactly right she was to hand him her
      empty cup when she had finished with it, without a word,
      and how perfectly he took it!" More?" he said, and Lucia
      just shook her head without withdrawing her attention from
      Professor Bonstetter. Then the Prime Minister arrived, and
      she said how lovely Chequers must be looking. She did not
      annex him, she just hovered and hinted, and made no direct
      suggestion, and sure enough, within five minutes he had
      asked her if she knew Chequers. Of course she did, but only
      as a tourist--and so one thing led on to another. It would
      be a nice break in her long drive down to Riseholme on
      Tuesday to lunch at Chequers, and not more than forty miles
      out of her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      People dispersed and strolled on the terrace, and gathered
      again, and some went off to their rooms. Lucia had one
      little turn up and down with the Ambassador, and spoke with
      great tact of Mussolini, and another with Lord Tony, and
      not for a long time did she let Stephen join her. But then
      they wandered off into the garden, and were seen standing
      very close together and arguing publicly about a flower,
      and Lucia seeing they were observed, called to Adele to
      know if it wasn't Dropmore Borage. They came back very
      soon, and Stephen went up to his room while Lucia remained
      downstairs. Adele showed her the library and the
      music-room, and the long drawing-room, and then vanished.
      Lucia gravitated to the music-room, opened the piano, and
      began the slow movement of the Moonlight Sonata.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half way through it, she became aware that somebody
      had come into the room. But her eyes were fixed dreamily on
      the usual point at the edge of the ceiling, and her fingers
      faultlessly doled out the slow triplets. She gave a little
      sigh when she had finished, pressed her fingers to her
      eyes, and slowly awoke, as from some melodious anæsthetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a man who had come in and who had seated himself not
      far from the key-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charming!" he said. "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia didn't remember seeing him on the terrace: perhaps he
      had only just arrived. She had a vague idea, however, that
      whether on the terrace or elsewhere, she had seen him
      before. She gave a pretty little start. "Ah, had no idea I
      had an audience," she said. "I should never have ventured
      to go on playing. So dreadfully out of practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please have a little more practice then," said the polite
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran her hands, butterfly fashion, over the keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little morsel of Stravinski?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the middle of the morsel that Adele came in and
      found Lucia playing Stravinski to Mr. Greatorex. The
      position seemed to be away, away beyond her orbit
      altogether, and she merely waited with undiminished faith
      in Lucia, to see what would happen when Lucia became aware
      to whom she was playing. . . . It was a longish morsel,
      too: more like a meal than a morsel, and it was also
      remarkably like a muddle. Finally, Lucia made an optimistic
      attempt at the double chromatic scale in divergent
      directions which brought it to an end, and laughed gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor fingers," she said. "Delicious piano, dear Adele.
      I love a Bechstein; that was a little morsel of Stravinski.
      Hectic perhaps, do you think? But so true to the modern
      idea: little feverish excursions: little bits of tunes, and
      nothing worked out. But I always say that there is
      something in Stravinski, if you study him. How I worked at
      that little piece, and I'm afraid it's far from perfect
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia played one more little run with her right hand, while
      she cudgelled her brain to remember where she had seen this
      man before, and turned round on the music-stool. She felt
      sure he was an artist of some kind, and she did not want to
      ask Adele to introduce him, for that would look as if she
      did not know everybody. She tried pictures next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Art I always think that the Stravinski school is
      represented by the Post-Cubists," she said. "They give us
      pattern in lines, just as Stravinski gives us patterns in
      notes, and the modern poet patterns in words. At Sophy
      Alingsby's the other night we had a feast of patterns. Dear
      Sophy--what a curious mixture of tastes! She cares only for
      the ultra-primitive in music, and the ultra-modern in Art.
      Just before you came in, Adele, I was trying to remember
      the first movement of Beethoven's Moonlight, those triplets
      though they look easy have to be kept so level. And yet
      Sophy considers Beethoven a positive decadent. I ought to
      have taken her to Diva's little concert--Diva
      Dalrymple--for I assure you really that Stravinski sounded
      classical compared to the rest of the programme. It was
      very creditably played, too. Mr.--" what was his name?--"Mr
      Greatorex."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had actually said the word before her brain made the
      connection. She gave her little peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you wicked people," she cried. "A plot: clearly a
      plot. Mr. Greatorex, how could you? Adele told you to come
      in here when she heard me begin my little strummings, and
      told you to sit down and encourage me. Don't deny it,
      Adele! I know it was like that. I shall tell everybody how
      unkind you've been, unless Mr. Greatorex sits down
      instantly and magically restores to life what I have just
      murdered."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele denied nothing. In fact there was no time to deny
      anything, for Lucia positively thrust Mr. Greatorex on to
      the music stood, and instantly put on her rapt musical
      face, chin in hand, and eyes looking dreamily upwards.
      There was Nemesis, you would have thought, dealing thrusts
      at her, but Nemesis was no match for her amazing quickness.
      She parried and thrust again, and here--what richness of
      future reminiscence--was Mr. Greatorex playing Stravinski
      to her, before no audience but herself and Adele who really
      didn't count, for the only tune she liked was "Land of Hope
      and Glory". . . . Great was Lucia!
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele left the two, warning them that it was getting on for
      dressing time, but there was some more Stravinski first,
      for Lucia's sole ear. Adele had told her the direction of
      her room, and said her name was on the door, and Lucia
      found it at once. A beautiful room it was, with a bathroom
      on one side, and a magnificent Charles II bed draped at the
      back with wool-work tapestry. It was a little late for
      Lucia's Elizabethan taste, and she noticed that the big
      wardrobe was Chippendale, which was later still. There was
      a Chinese paper on the wall, and fine Persian rugs on the
      floor, and though she could have criticised it was easy to
      admire. And there for herself was a very smart dress, and
      for decoration Aunt Amy's pearls, and the Beethoven brooch.
      But she decided to avoid all possible chance of
      competition, and put the pearls back into her jewel-case.
      The Beethoven brooch, she was sure, need fear no rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia felt that dinner, as far as she went, was a huge
      success. Stephen was seated just opposite her, and now and
      then she exchanged little distant smiles with him. Next her
      on one side was Lord Tony, who adored her story about
      Stravinski and Greatorex. She told him also what the
      Italian Ambassador had said about Mussolini, and the Prime
      Minister about Chequers: she was going to pop in to lunch
      on her way down to Riseholme after this delicious party.
      Then conversation shifted, and she turned left, and talked
      to the only man whose identity she had not grasped. But, as
      matter of public knowledge, she began about poor Babs, and
      her own admiration of her demeanour at that wicked trial,
      which had ended so disastrously. And once again there was
      slight tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridge and Mah-Jong followed, and rich allusive
      conversation and the sense, so dear to Lucia, of being in
      the very centre of everything that was distinguished. When
      the women went upstairs she hurried to her room, made a
      swift change into greater simplicity, and, by invitation,
      sought out Marcia's room, at the far end of the passage,
      for a chat. Adele was there, and dear (rather common) Aggie
      was there, and Aggie was being just a shade sycophantic
      over the six rows of Whitby pearls. Lucia was glad she had
      limited her splendours to the Beethoven brooch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why didn't you wear your pearls, Lucia?" asked Adele.
      "I was hoping to see them." (She had heard talk of Aunt
      Amy's pearls, but had not noticed them on the night of
      Marcia's ball.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "My little seedlings!" said Lucia. "Just seedlings,
      compared to Marcia's marbles. Little trumperies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Aggie had seen them, and she knew Lucia did not overstate
      their minuteness. Like a true Luciaphil, she changed a
      subject that might prove embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take away your baubles, Marcia," said Aggie. "They are
      only diseases of a common shell fish which you eat when
      it's healthy and wear when it's got a tumour. . . . How
      wretched it is to think that all of us aren't going to meet
      day after day as we have been doing! There's Adele going to
      America, and there's Marcia going to Scotland--what a foul
      spot, Marcia, come to Marienbad instead with me. And what
      are you going to do, Lucia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear, how I wanted to go to Aix or Marienbad," she
      said. "But my Pepino says it's impossible. We've got to
      stop quiet at Riseholme. Shekels, tiresome shekels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There she goes, talking about Riseholme as if it was some
      dreadful penance to go there," said Adele. "You adore
      Riseholme, Lucia, at least if you don't, you ought to. Olga
      raves about it. She says she's never really happy away from
      it. When are you going to ask me there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adele, as if you didn't know that you weren't always
      welcome," said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me, too," said Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A standing invitation to both of you always," said Lucia.
      "Dear Marcia, how sweet of you to want to come! I go there
      on Tuesday, and there I remain. But it's true, I do adore
      it. No balls, no parties, and such dear Arcadians. You
      couldn't believe in them without seeing them. Life at its
      very simplest, dears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be simpler than Scotland," said Marcia. "In
      Scotland you kill birds and fish all day, and eat them at
      night. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia through these months of strenuous effort had never
      perhaps felt herself so amply rewarded as she was at this
      moment. All evening she had talked in an effortless
      deshabille of mind to the great ones of the country, the
      noble, the distinguished, the accomplished, and now here
      she was in a duchess's bedroom having a goodnight talk.
      This was nearer Nirvana than even Marcia's ball. And the
      three women there seemed to be grouped round her: they
      waited--there was no mistaking it--listening for something
      from her, just as Riseholme used to wait for her lead. She
      felt that she was truly attaining, and put her chin in her
      hand and looked a little upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall get tremendously put in my place when I go back to
      Riseholme again," she said. "I'm sure Riseholme thinks I
      have been wasting my time in idle frivolities. It sees
      perhaps in an evening paper that I have been to Aggie's
      party, or Adele's house or Marcia's ball, and I assure you
      it will be very suspicious of me. Just as if I didn't know
      that all these delightful things were symbols."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele had got the cataleptic look of a figure in a stained
      glass window, so rapt she was. But she wanted to grasp this
      with full appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia, don't be so dreadfully clever," she said. "You're
      talking high over my head: you're like the whirr of an
      aeroplane. Explain what you mean by symbols."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was toying with the string of Whitby pearls, which
      Marcia still held, with one hand. The other she laid on
      Adele's knee. She felt that a high line was expected of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you know," she said. "All our runnings-about, all
      our gaieties are symbols of affection: we love to see each
      other because we partake of each other. Interesting people,
      distinguished people, obscure people, ordinary people, we
      long to bring them all into our lives in order to widen our
      horizons. We learn, or we try to learn of other interests
      beside our own. I shall have to make Riseholme understand
      that dear little Alf, playing the flute at my house, or
      half a dozen princes eating quails at Marcia's mansion,
      it's all the same, isn't it? We get to know the point of
      view of prize-fighters and princes. And it seems to me, it
      seems to me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's gaze grew a shade more lost and aloof.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me that we extend our very souls," she said,
      "by letting them flow into other lives. How badly I put it!
      But when Eric Greatorex--so charming of him--played those
      delicious pieces of Stravinski to me before dinner, I felt
      I was stepping over some sort of frontier <i>into</i>
      Stravinski. Eric made out my passport. A multiplication of
      experience: I think that is what I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      None of those present could have said with any precision
      what Lucia had meant, but the general drift seemed to be
      that an hour with a burglar or a cannibal was valuable for
      the amplification of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Odd types too," she said. "How good for one to be put into
      touch with something quite remote. Marcelle--Marcelle
      Periscope--you met him at my house, didn't you, Aggie--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why wasn't I asked?" said Marcia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a little quick smile, as at some sweet child's
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling Marcia, why didn't you propose yourself? Surely
      you know me well enough to do that. Yes, Marcelle, a
      cinema-artist. A fresh horizon, a fresh attitude towards
      life. So good for me: it helps me not to be narrow. <i>Dio
      mio!</i> how I pray I shall never be narrow. To be shocked,
      too! How shocking to be shocked. If you all had fifty
      lovers apiece, I should merely think it a privilege to know
      about them all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcia longed, with almost the imperativeness of a longing
      to sneeze, to allude directly to Stephen. She raised her
      eyes for a half second to Adele, the priestess of this cult
      in which she knew she was rapidly becoming a worshipper,
      but if ever an emphatic negative was wordlessly bawled at a
      tentative enquirer, it was bawled now. If Lucia chose to
      say anything about Stephen it would indeed be manna, but to
      ask--never! Aggie, seated sideways to them, had not seen
      this telegraphy, and spoke unwisely with her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If an ordinary good-looking woman," she said, "tells me
      that she hasn't got a lover or a man who wants to be her
      lover, I always say 'You lie!' So she does. You shall
      begin, Lucia, about your lovers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have been more unfortunate. Adele could have
      hurled the entire six rows of the Whitby pearls at Aggie's
      face. Lucia had no lover, but only the wraith of a lover,
      on whom direct light must never be flashed. Such a little
      reflection should have shown Aggie that. The effect of her
      carelessness was that Lucia became visibly embarrassed,
      looked at the clock, and got up in a violent hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gracious me!" she said. "What a time of night! Who
      could have thought that our little chat had lasted so long?
      Yes, dear Adele, I know my room, on the left with my name
      on the door. Don't dream of coming to show it me."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia distributed little pressures and kisses and
      clingings, and holding her very smart pale blue wrapper
      close about her, slid noiselessly out in her slippers into
      the corridor. It was late, the house was quite quiet, for a
      quarter of an hour ago they had heard the creaking of men's
      footsteps going to their rooms. The main lights had been
      put out, only here and there down the long silent aisle
      there burned a single small illumination. Past half a dozen
      doors Lucia tiptoed, until she came to one on which she
      could just see the name Philip Lucas preceded by a dim
      hieroglyph which of course was "Mrs." She turned the handle
      and went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two yards in front of her, by the side of the bed, was
      standing Stephen, voluptuous in honey-coloured pyjamas. For
      one awful second--for she felt sure this was her room
      <i>(and so did he)</i>--they stared at each other in dead
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you?" said Stephen, so agitated that he could
      scarcely form the syllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how dare <i>you?"</i> hissed Lucia. "Go out of my room
      instantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go out of mine!" said Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's indignant eye left his horror-stricken face and
      swept round the room. There was no Chinese paper on the
      wall, but a pretty Morris paper: there was no Charles II
      bed with tapestry, but a brass-testered couch; there was no
      Chippendale wardrobe, but something useful from Tottenham
      Court Road. She gave one little squeal, of a pitch between
      the music of the slate-pencil and of the bat, and closed
      his door again. She staggered on to the next room where
      again the legend 'Philip Lucas' was legible, popped in, and
      locked the door. She hurried to the door of communication
      between this and the fatal chamber next it, and as she
      locked that also she heard from the other side of it the
      bolt violently pulled forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on her bed in a state of painful agitation.
      Her excursion into the fatal chamber had been an awful, a
      hideous mistake: none knew that better than herself, but
      how was she to explain that to her lover? For weeks they
      had been advertising the guilt of their blameless
      relationship, and now it seemed to her impossible ever to
      resume it. Every time she gave Stephen one of those little
      smiles or glances, at which she had become so perfect an
      adept, there would start into her mind that moment of
      speechless horror, and her smile would turn to a tragic
      grimace, and her sick glance recoil from him. Worse than
      that, how was she ever to speak of it to him, or
      passionately protest her innocence? He had thought that she
      had come to his room (indeed she had) when the house was
      quiet, on the sinister errand of love, and though, when he
      had repudiated her, she had followed suit, she saw the
      recoiling indignation of her lover. If only, just now, she
      had kept her head, if only she had said at once, 'I beg
      your pardon, I mistook my room,' all might have been well,
      but how nerve herself to say it afterwards? And in spite of
      the entire integrity of her moral nature, which was
      puritanical to the verge of prudishness, she had not liked
      (no woman could) his unfeigned horror at her irruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen next door was in little better plight. He had had a
      severe shock. For weeks Lucia had encouraged him to play
      the lover, and had (so he awfully asked himself) this
      pleasant public stunt become a reality to her, a need of
      her nature? She had made it appear, when he so rightly
      repulsed her, that she had come to his room by mistake, but
      was that pretence? Had she really come with a terrible
      motive? It was her business, anyhow, to explain, and insist
      on her innocence, if she was innocent, and he would only be
      too thankful to believe her. But at present and without
      that, the idea of resuming the public loverlike demeanour
      was frankly beyond him. She might be encouraged again. . .
      . Though now he was safe with locked and bolted doors, he
      knew he would not be able to sleep, and he took a large
      dose of aspirin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was far more thorough: she never shelved
      difficulties, but faced them. She still sat on the edge of
      her bed, long after Stephen's nerves were quieted, and as
      she herself calmed down, thought it all out. For the
      present, loverlike relations in public were impossible, and
      it was lucky that in a couple of days more she would be
      interned at Riseholme. Then with a flash of genius there
      occurred to her the interesting attitude to adopt in the
      interval. She would give the impression that there had been
      a lovers' quarrel. The more she thought of that, the more
      it commended itself to her. People would notice it, and
      wonder what it was all about, and their curiosity would
      never be gratified, for Lucia felt sure, from the horror
      depicted on Stephen's face, that he as well as she would be
      for ever dumb on the subject of that midnight encounter.
      She must not look unhappy: she must on the other hand be
      more vivid and eager than ever, and just completely ignore
      Stephen. But there would be no lift for him in her car back
      to London: he would have to go by train.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The ex-lovers both came down very late next day, for fear
      of meeting each other alone, and thus they sat in adjoining
      rooms half the morning. Stephen had some Hermione-work on
      hand, for this party would run to several paragraphs, but,
      however many it ran to, Hermione was utterly determined not
      to mention Lucia in any of them. Hermione knew, however,
      that Mr. Stephen Merriall was there, and said so. . . . By
      one of those malignant strokes which are rained on those
      whom Nemesis desires to chastise, they came out of their
      rooms at precisely the same moment, and had to walk
      downstairs together, coldly congratulating each other on
      the beauty of the morning. Luckily there were people on the
      terrace, among whom was Marcia. She thought this was an
      excellent opportunity for beginning her flirtation with
      Stephen, and instantly carried him off to the kitchen
      garden, for unless she ate gooseberries on Sunday morning
      she died. Lucia seemed sublimely unaware of their
      departure, and joined a select little group round the Prime
      Minister. Between a discussion on the housing problem with
      him, a stroll with Lord Tony, who begged her to drop the
      'lord,' and a little more Stravinski alone with Greatorex,
      the short morning passed very agreeably. But she saw when
      she went into lunch rather late that Marcia and Stephen had
      not returned from their gooseberrying. There was a gap of
      just three places at the table, and it thus became a
      certainty that Stephen would sit next her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lunch was fully half over before they appeared, Marcia
      profusely apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wretchedly rude of me, dear Adele," she said, "but we had
      no idea it was so late, did we, Mr. Merriall? We went to
      the gooseberries, and--and I suppose we must have stopped
      there. Your fault, Mr. Merriall; you men have no idea of
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who could, duchess, when he was with you?" said Stephen
      most adroitly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet of you," said she. "Now do go on. You were in the
      middle of telling me something quite thrilling. And please,
      Adele, let nobody wait for us. I see you are all at the end
      of lunch, and I haven't begun, and gooseberries, as usual,
      have given me an enormous appetite. Yes, Mr. Merriall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Adele looked in vain, when throughout the afternoon Marcia
      continued in possession of Lucia's lover, for the smallest
      sign of resentment or uneasiness on her part. There was
      simply none; it was impossible to detect a thing that had
      no existence. Lucia seemed completely unconscious of any
      annexation, or indeed of Stephen's existence. There she
      sat, just now with Tony and herself, talking of Marcia's
      ball, and the last volume of risky memoirs, of which she
      had read a review in the Sunday paper, and Sophy's black
      room and Alf: never had she been more equipped at all
      points, more prosperously central. Marcia, thought Adele,
      was being wonderfully worsted, if she imagined she could
      produce any sign of emotion on Lucia's part. The lovers
      understood each other too well. . . . Or, she suddenly
      conjectured, had they quarrelled? It really looked rather
      like it. Though she and Tony were having a good Luciaphil
      meeting, she almost wanted Lucia to go away, in order to go
      into committee over this entrancing possibility. And how
      naturally she Tony'd him: she must have been practising on
      her maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the house a telephone bell rang, and a footman
      came out on to the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia, I know that's for you," said Adele. "Where-ever you
      are, somebody wants you on the telephone. If you were in
      the middle of the Sahara, a telephone would ring for you
      from the sands of the desert. Yes? Who is it for?" she said
      to the footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Lucas, my lady," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia got up, quite delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're always chaffing me, Adele," she said. "What a
      nuisance the telephone is. One never gets a rest from it.
      But I won't be a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tripped off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tony, there's a great deal to talk about," said Adele
      quickly. "Now what's the situation between the lovers?
      Perfect understanding or a quarrel? And who has been
      ringing her up? What would you bet that it was--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alf," said Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder. Tony, about the lovers. There's something. I
      never saw such superb indifference. How I shall laugh at
      Marcia. She's producing no effect at all. Lucia doesn't
      take the slightest notice. I knew she would be great. Last
      night we had a wonderful talk in Marcia's room, till Aggie
      was an ass. There she is again. Now we shall know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia came quickly along the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adele dear," she said. "Would it be dreadful of me if I
      left this afternoon? They've rung me up from Riseholme.
      Georgie rang me up. My Pepino is very far from well.
      Nothing really anxious, but he's in bed and he's alone. I
      think I had better go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh my dear," said Adele, "of course you shall do precisely
      as you wish. I'm dreadfully sorry: so shall we all be if
      you go. But if you feel you would be easier in your mind--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia looked round on all the brilliant little groups. She
      was leaving the most wonderful party: it was the highest
      perch she had reached yet. On the other hand she was
      leaving her lover, which was a compensation. But she truly
      didn't think of any of these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor old Pepino," she said. "I must go, Adele."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h1>
      <a name="c10" id="c10">CHAPTER X</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      To-day, the last of August, Pepino had been allowed for the
      first time to go out and have a half-hour's quiet strolling
      in the garden and sit in the sun. His illness which had
      caused Lucia to recall herself had been serious, and for a
      few days he had been dangerously ill with pneumonia. After
      turning a bad corner he had made satisfactory progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, who for these weeks had been wholly admirable, would
      have gone out with him now, but the doctor, after his
      visit, had said he wanted to have a talk with her, and for
      twenty minutes or so they had held colloquy in the
      music-room. Then, on his departure, she sat there a few
      minutes more, arranged her ideas, and went out to join
      Pepino.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a good cheering talk, <i>caro,"</i> she said. "There
      never was such a perfect convalescer--my dear, what a
      word--as you. You're a prize-patient. All you've got to do
      is to go on exactly as you're going, doing a little more,
      and a little more every day, and in a month's time you'll
      be ever so strong again. Such a good constitution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no sea-voyage?" asked Pepino. The dread prospect had
      been dangled before him at one time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unless they think a month or two on the Riviera in the
      winter might be advisable. Then the sea voyage from Dover
      to Calais, but no more than that. Now I know what you're
      thinking about. You told me that we couldn't manage Aix
      this August because of expense, so how are we to manage two
      months of Cannes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That delicious story of dear Marcia's," she said, "about
      those cousins of hers who had to retrench. After talking
      everything over they decided that all the retrenchment they
      could possibly make was to have no coffee after lunch. But
      we can manage better than that. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia paused again. Pepino had had enough of movement under
      his own steam, and they had seated themselves in the sunny
      little arbour by the sundial, which had so many appropriate
      mottoes carved on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor told me too that it would be most unwise of you
      to attempt to live in London for any solid period," she
      said. "Fogs, sunlessness, damp darkness: all bad. And I
      know again what's in your kind head. You think I adore
      London, and can spend a month or two there in the autumn,
      and in the spring, coming down here for week-ends. But I
      haven't the slightest intention of doing anything of the
      kind. I'm not going to be up there alone. Besides, where
      are the dibs, as that sweet little Alf said, where are the
      dibs to come from for our Riviera?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let the house for the winter then?" said Pepino.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent idea, if we could be certain of letting it. But
      we can't be certain of letting it, and all the time a
      stream of rates and taxes, and caretakers. It would be
      wretched to be always anxious about it, and always counting
      the dibs. I've been going into what we spent there this
      summer, <i>caro,</i> and it staggered me. What I vote for,
      is to sell it. I'm not going to use it without you, and
      you're not going to use it at all. You know how I looked
      forward to being there for your sake, your club, the
      Reading Room at the British Museum, the Astronomer Royal,
      but now that's all kaput, as Tony says. We'll bring down
      here anything that's particularly connected with dear
      Auntie: her portrait by Sargent, of course, though Sargents
      are fetching immense prices; or the walnut bureau, or the
      Chippendale chairs or that little worsted rug in her
      bedroom; but I vote for selling it all, freehold,
      furniture, everything. As if I couldn't go up to Claridge's
      now and then, when I want to have a luncheon-party or two
      of all our friends! And then we shall have no more
      anxieties, and if they say you must get away from the cold
      and the damp, we shall know we're doing nothing on the
      margin of our means. That would be hateful: we mustn't do
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you'll never be able to be content with Riseholme
      again," said Pepino. "After your balls and your parties and
      all that, what will you find to do here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia turned her gimlet-eye on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be a great fool if I don't find something to do,"
      she said. "Was I so idle and unoccupied before we went to
      London? Good gracious, I was always worked to death here.
      Don't you bother your head about that, Pepino, for if you
      do it will show you don't understand me at all. And our
      dear Riseholme, let me tell you, has got very slack and
      inert in our absence, and I feel very guilty about that.
      There's nothing going on: there's none of the old fizz and
      bubble and Excelsior there used to be. They're vegetating,
      they're dry-rotting, and Georgie's getting fat. There's
      never any news. All that happens is that Daisy slashes a
      golf-ball about the Green for practice in the morning, and
      then goes down to the links in the afternoon, and
      positively the only news next day is whether she has been
      round under a thousand strokes, whatever that means."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a little indulgent sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Daisy has ideas sometimes," she said, "and I don't
      deny that. She had the idea of ouija, she had the idea of
      the Museum, and though she said that came from Abfou, she
      had the idea of Abfou. Also she had the idea of golf. But
      she doesn't carry her ideas out in a vivid manner that
      excites interest and keeps people on the boil. On the boil!
      That's what we all ought to be, with a thousand things to
      do that seem immensely important and which are important
      because they seem so. You want a certain touch to give
      importance to things, which dear Daisy hasn't got. Whatever
      poor Daisy does seems trivial. But they shall see that I've
      come home. What does it matter to me whether it's Marcia's
      ball, or playing Alf's accompaniments, or playing golf with
      Daisy, or playing duets with poor dear Georgie, whose
      fingers have all become thumbs, so long as I find it
      thrilling? If I find it dull, <i>caro,</i> I shall be, as
      Adele once said, a bloody fool. Dear Adele, she has always
      that little vein of coarseness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia encountered more opposition from Pepino than she
      anticipated, for he had taken a huge pride in her
      triumphant summer campaign in London, and though at times
      he had felt bewildered and buffeted in this high gale of
      social activity, and had, so to speak, to close his
      streaming eyes and hold his hat on, he gloried in the
      incessant and tireless blowing of it, which stripped the
      choicest fruits from the trees. He thought they could
      manage, without encroaching on financial margins, to keep
      the house open for another year yet, anyhow: he
      acknowledged that he had been unduly pessimistic about
      going to Aix, he even alluded to the memories of Aunt Amy
      which were twined about 25 Brompton Square, and which he
      would be so sorry to sever. But Lucia, in that talk with
      his doctor, had made up her mind: she rejected at once the
      idea of pursuing her victorious career in London if all the
      time she would have to be careful and thrifty, and if, far
      more importantly, she would be leaving Pepino down at
      Riseholme. That was not to be thought of: affection no less
      than decency made it impossible, and so having made up her
      mind, she set about the attainment of her object with all
      her usual energy. She knew, too, the value of incessant
      attack: smash little Alf, for instance, when he had landed
      a useful blow on his opponent's face, did not wait for him
      to recover, but instantly followed it up with another and
      yet another till his victim collapsed and was counted out.
      Lucia behaved in precisely the same way with Pepino: she
      produced rows of figures to show they were living beyond
      their means: she quoted (or invented) something the Prime
      Minister had said about the probability of an increase in
      income-tax: she assumed that they would go to the Riviera
      for certain, and was appalled at the price of tickets in
      the Blue Train, and of the tariff at hotels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with all our friends in London, Pepino," she said in
      the decisive round of these combats, "who are longing to
      come down to Riseholme and spend a week with us, our
      expenses here will go up. You mustn't forget that. We shall
      be having a succession of visitors in October, and indeed
      till we go south. Then there's the meadow at the bottom of
      the garden: you've not bought that yet, and on that I
      really have set my heart. A spring garden there. A
      profusion of daffodils, and a paved walk. You promised me
      that. I described what it would be like to Tony, and he is
      wildly jealous. I'm sure I don't wonder. Your new telescope
      too. I insist on that telescope, and I'm sure I don't know
      where the money's to come from. My dear old piano also:
      it's on its very last legs, and won't last much longer, and
      I know you don't expect me to live, literally keep alive,
      without a good piano in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pepino, was weakening. Even when he was perfectly well and
      strong he was no match for her, and this rain of blows was
      visibly staggering him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to urge you, <i>caro,"</i> she continued.
      "You know I never urge you to do what you don't feel is
      best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are urging me," said Pepino.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only to do what you feel is best. As for the memories of
      Aunt Amy in Brompton Square, you must not allow false
      sentiment to come in. You never saw her there since you
      were a boy, and if you brought down here her portrait, and
      the wool-work rug which you remember her putting over her
      knees, I should say, without urging you, mind, that that
      was ample. . . . What a sweet morning! Come to the end of
      the garden and imagine what the meadow will look like with
      a paved walk and a blaze of daffodils. . . . The
      Chippendale chairs, I think I should sell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did not really want Aunt Amy's portrait either, for
      she was aware she had said a good deal from time to time
      about Aunt Amy's pearls, which were there, a little collar
      of very little seeds, faultlessly portrayed. But then
      Georgie had seen them on that night at the Opera, and Lucia
      felt that she knew Riseholme very poorly if it was not
      perfectly acquainted by now with the nature and minuteness
      of Aunt Amy's pearls. The pearls had better be sold too,
      and also, she thought, her own portrait by Sigismund, for
      the post-cubists were not making much of a mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The determining factor in her mind, over this abandonment
      of her London career, to which in a few days, by incessant
      battering, she had got Pepino to consent, was Pepino
      himself. He could not be with her in London, and she could
      not leave him week after week (for nothing less than that,
      if you were to make any solid progress in London, was any
      good) alone in Riseholme. But a large factor, also, was the
      discovery of how little at present she counted for in
      Riseholme, and that could not be tolerated. Riseholme had
      deposed her, Riseholme was not intending to be managed by
      her from Brompton Square. The throne was vacant, for poor
      Daisy, and for the matter of that poor Georgie were not the
      sort of people who could occupy thrones at all. She longed
      to queen it there again, and though she was aware that her
      utmost energies would be required, what were energies for
      except to get you what you wanted?
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now she was nothing in Riseholme: they had been sorry
      for her because Pepino had been so ill, but as his steady
      convalescence proceeded, and she began to ring people up,
      and pop in, and make plans for them, she became aware that
      she mattered no more than Piggie and Goosie. . . . There on
      the Green, as she saw from the window of her hall, was
      Daisy, whirling her arms madly, and hitting a ball with a
      stick which had a steel blade at the end, and Georgie, she
      was rather horrified to observe, was there too, trying to
      do the same. Was Daisy reaping the reward of her
      persistence, and getting somebody interested in golf? And,
      good heavens, there were Piggie and Goosie also smacking
      away. Riseholme was clearly devoting itself to golf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have to take to golf," thought Lucia. "What a
      bore! Such a foolish game."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a small white ball bounded over her
      yew-hedge, and tapped smartly against the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an immense distance to have hit a ball," she thought.
      "I wonder which of them did that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was soon clear, for Daisy came tripping through the
      garden after it, and Lucia, all smiles, went out to meet
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, dear Daisy," she said. "Did you hit that
      ball that immense distance? How wonderful! No harm done at
      all. But what a splendid player you must be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So sorry," panted Daisy, "but I thought I would have a hit
      with a driver. Very wrong of me; I had no idea it would go
      so far or so crooked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A marvellous shot," said Lucia. "I remember how
      beautifully you putted. And this is all part of golf too?
      Do let me see you do it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy could not reproduce that particular masterpiece, but
      she sent the ball high in the air, or skimming along the
      ground, and explained that one was a lofted shot, and the
      other a wind-cheater.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like the wind-cheater best," said Lucia. "Do let me see
      if I can do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She missed the ball once or twice, and then made a lovely
      wind-cheater, only this time Daisy called it a top. Daisy
      had three clubs, two of which she put down when she used
      the third, and then forgot about them, so that they had to
      go back for them. . . . And up came Georgie, who was making
      wind-cheaters too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, Lucia," he said. "It's so tarsome not to be
      able to hit the ball, but it's great fun if you do. Have
      you put down your clock-golf yet? There, didn't that go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia had forgotten all about the clock-golf. It was
      somewhere in what was called the "game-cupboard," which
      contained bowls (as being Elizabethan) and some old tennis
      rackets, and a cricket bat Pepino had used at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll put it down this afternoon," she said. "Come in after
      lunch, Georgie, and play a game with me. You too, Daisy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, but Georgie and I were going to have a real round
      on the links," said Daisy, in a rather superior manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What fun!" said Lucia sycophantically. "I shall walk down
      and look at you. I think I must learn. I never saw anything
      so interesting as golf."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was gratifying: Daisy was by no means reluctant to
      show Lucia the way to do anything, but behind that, she was
      not quite sure whether she liked this sudden interest in
      golf. Now that practically the whole of Riseholme was
      taking to it, and she herself could beat them all, having
      had a good start, she was hoping that Lucia would despise
      it, and find herself left quite alone on these lovely
      afternoons. Everybody went down to the little nine-hole
      course now after lunch, the Vicar (Mr. Rushbold) and his
      wife, the curate, Colonel Boucher, Georgie, Mrs. Antrobus
      (who discarded her ear-trumpet for these athletics and
      never could hear you call "Fore") and Piggie and Goosie,
      and often Mrs. Boucher was wheeled down in her bath-chair,
      and applauded the beautiful putts made on the last green.
      Indeed, Daisy had started instruction classes in her
      garden, and Riseholme stood in rows and practised swinging
      and keeping its eye on a particular blade of grass: golf in
      fact promised to make Riseholme busy and happy again just
      as the establishment of the Museum had done. Of course, if
      Lucia was wanting to learn (and not learn too much) Daisy
      would be very happy to instruct her, but at the back of
      Daisy's mind was a strange uneasiness. She consoled
      herself, however, by supposing that Lucia would go back to
      London again in the autumn, and by giving Georgie an awful
      drubbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia did not accompany them far on their round, but turned
      back to the little shed of a club-house, where she gathered
      information about the club. It was quite new, having been
      started only last spring by the tradesmen and townspeople
      of Riseholme and the neighbouring little town of Blitton.
      She then entered into pleasant conversation with the
      landlord of the Ambermere Arms, who had just finished his
      round and said how pleased they all were that the gentry
      had taken to golf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Mrs. Quantock, ma'am," said he. "She comes down
      every afternoon and practises on the Green every morning.
      Walking over the Green now of a morning, is to take your
      life in your hand. Such keenness I never saw, and she'll
      never be able to hit the ball at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but you mustn't discourage us, Mr. Stratton," said
      Lucia. "I'm going to devote myself to golf this autumn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll make a better hand at it, I'll be bound," said Mr.
      Stratton obsequiously. "They say Mrs. Quantock putts very
      nicely when she gets near the hole, but it takes her so
      many strokes to get there. She's lost the hole, in a manner
      of speaking, before she has a chance of winning it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia thought hard for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must see about joining at once," she said. "Who--who are
      the Committee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we are going to reconstitute it next October," he
      said, "seeing that the ladies and gentlemen of Riseholme
      are joining. We should like to have one of you ladies as
      President, and one of the gentlemen on the Committee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia made no hesitation about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be delighted," she said, "if the present
      Committee did me the honour to ask me. And how about Mr.
      Pillson? I would sound him if you like. But we must say
      nothing about it, till your Committee meets."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was beautifully settled then; Mr. Stratton knew how
      gratified the Committee would be, and Lucia, long before
      Georgie and Daisy returned, had bought four clubs, and was
      having a lesson from a small wiry caddie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning while Daisy was swanking away on the Green,
      teaching Georgie and Piggie and Goosie how to play, Lucia
      went surreptitiously down the hill and learned, while after
      tea she humbly took her place in Daisy's class and observed
      Daisy doing everything all wrong. She putted away at her
      clock-golf, she bought a beautiful book with pictures and
      studied them, and all the time she said nothing whatever
      about it. In her heart she utterly despised golf, but golf
      just now was the stunt, and she had to get hold of
      Riseholme again. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie popped in one morning after she had come back from
      her lesson, and found her in the act of holing out from the
      very longest of the stations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, what a beautiful putt!" he said. "I believe
      you're getting quite keen on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I am," said she. "It's great fun. I go down
      sometimes to the links and knock the ball about. Be very
      kind to me this afternoon and come round with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie readily promised to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I will," he said, "and I should be delighted to
      give you a hint or two, if I can. I won two holes from
      Daisy yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How clever of you, Georgie! Any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie said the sound that is spelt "Tut."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite forgot," he said. "I came round to tell you.
      Neither Mrs. Boucher nor Daisy nor I know <i>what</i> to
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      ("That's the Museum Committee," thought Lucia.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Georgie?" she said. "See if poor Lucia can
      help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Georgie, "You know Pug?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That mangy little thing of Lady Ambermere's?" asked Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Pug died, I don't know what of--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cream, I should think," said Lucia. "And cake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it may have been. Anyhow, Lady Ambermere had him
      stuffed, and while I was out this morning, she left him in
      a glass case at my house, as a present for the Museum.
      There he is lying on a blue cushion, with one ear cocked,
      and a great watery eye, and the end of his horrid tongue
      between his lips."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Lucia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you. And we don't know what to do. We can't put
      him in the Museum, can we? And we're afraid she'll take the
      mittens away if we don't. But, how can we refuse? She wrote
      me a note about 'her precious Pug.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia remembered how they had refused an Elizabethan spit,
      though they had subsequently accepted it. But she was not
      going to remind Georgie of that. She wanted to get a better
      footing in the Museum than an Elizabethan spit had given
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a dreadful thing!" she said. "And so you came to see
      if your poor old Lucia could help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we all wondered if you might be able to think of
      something," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia enjoyed this: the Museum was wanting her. . . . She
      fixed Georgie with her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I can get you out of your hole," she said. "What I
      imagine is, Georgie, that you want <i>me</i> to take that
      awful Pug back to her. I see what's happened. She had him
      stuffed, and then found he was too dreadful an object to
      keep, and so thought she'd be generous to the Museum. We--I
      should say 'you', for I've got nothing to do with it--you
      don't care about the Museum being made a dump for all the
      rubbish that people don't want in their houses. Do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, certainly not," said Georgie. (Did Lucia mean anything
      by that? Apparently she did.) She became brisk and voluble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, if you asked my opinion," said Lucia, "I should
      say that there has been a little too much dumping done
      already. But that is not the point, is it? And it's not my
      business either. Anyhow, you don't want any more rubbish to
      be dumped. As for withdrawing the mittens--only lent, are
      they?--she won't do anything of the kind. She likes taking
      people over and showing them. Yes, Georgie, I'll help you:
      tell Mrs. Boucher and Daisy that I'll help you. I'll drive
      over this afternoon--no, I won't, for I'm going to have a
      lovely game of golf with you--I'll drive over to-morrow and
      take Pug back, with the Committee's regrets that they are
      not taxidermists. Or, if you like, I'll do it on my own
      authority. How odd to be afraid of poor old Lady Ambermere!
      Never mind: I'm not. How all you people bully me into doing
      just what you want! I always was Riseholme's slave. Put
      Pug's case in a nice piece of brown paper, Georgie, for I
      don't want to see the horrid little abortion, and don't
      think anything more about it. Now let's have a good little
      putting match till lunch-time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was nowhere in the good little putting-match, and
      he was even less anywhere when it came to their game in the
      afternoon. Lucia made magnificent swipes from the tee, the
      least of which, if she happened to hit it, must have gone
      well over a hundred yards, whereas Daisy considered eighty
      yards from the tee a most respectable shot, and was
      positively pleased if she went into a bunker at a greater
      distance than that, and said the bunker ought to be put
      further off for the sake of the longer hitters. And when
      Lucia came near the green, she gave a smart little dig with
      her mashie, and, when this remarkable stroke came off,
      though she certainly hit the ground, the ball went
      beautifully, whereas when Daisy hit the ground the ball
      didn't go at all. All the time she was light-hearted and
      talkative, and even up to the moment of striking, would be
      saying "Now oo naughty ickle ball: Lucia's going to give
      you such a spank!" whereas when Daisy was playing, her
      opponent and the caddies had all to be dumb and turned to
      stone, while she drew a long breath and waved her club with
      a pendulum-like movement over the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you're marvellous," said Georgie as, three down, he
      stood on the fourth tee, and watched Lucia's ball sail away
      over a sheep that looked quite small in the distance. "It's
      only three weeks or so since you began to play at all. You
      are clever! I believe you'd nearly beat Daisy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I'm afraid you're a flatterer," said Lucia. "Now
      give your ball a good bang, and then there's something I
      want to talk to you about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see; it's slow back, isn't it?" said Georgie. "Or is
      it quick back? I believe Daisy says sometimes one and
      sometimes the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy and Piggie, starting before them, were playing in a
      parallel and opposite direction. Daisy had no luck with her
      first shot, and very little with her second. Lucia just got
      out of the way of her third and Daisy hurried by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a slice!" she said. "How are you getting on, Lucia?
      How-many have you played to get there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One at present, dear," said Lucia. "But isn't it
      difficult?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy's face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia kissed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all," she said. "And has Georgie told you that I'll
      manage about Pug for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy looked round severely. She had begun to address her
      ball and nobody must talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia watched Daisy do it again, and rejoined Georgie who
      was in a 'tarsome' place, and tufts of grass flew in the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, I had a little talk with Mr. Stratton the other
      day," she said. "There's a new golf-committee being elected
      in October, and they would so like to have you on it. Now
      be good-natured and say you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had no intention of saying anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they want poor little me to be President," said Lucia.
      "So shall I send Mr. Stratton a line and say we will? It
      would be kind, Georgie. Oh, by the way, do come and dine
      to-night. Pepino--so much better, thanks--Pepino told me to
      ask you. He would enjoy it. Just one of our dear little
      evenings again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia, in fact, was bringing her batteries into action, and
      Georgie was the immediate though not the ultimate
      objective. He longed to be on the golf-committee, he was
      intensely grateful for the promised removal of Pug, and it
      was much more amusing to play golf with Lucia than to be
      dragooned round by Daisy who told him after every stroke
      what he ought to have done and could never do it herself. A
      game should not be a lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia thought it was time to confide in him about the
      abandoning of Brompton Square. Georgie would love knowing
      what nobody else knew yet. She waited till he had failed to
      hole a short putt, and gave him the subsequent one, which
      Daisy never did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope we shall have many of our little evenings,
      Georgie," she said. "We shall be here till Christmas. No,
      no more London for us, though it's a secret at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment," said Lucia, teeing up for the last hole.
      "Now ickle ballie, fly away home. There! . . ." and ickle
      ballie flew at about right-angles to home, but ever such a
      long way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked with him to cover-point, where he had gone too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pepino must never live in London again," she said. "All
      going to be sold, Georgie. The house and the furniture and
      the pearls. You must put up with your poor old Lucia at
      Riseholme again. Nobody knows yet but you, but now it is
      all settled. Am I sorry? Yes, Georgie, course I am. So many
      dear friends in London. But then there are dear friends in
      Riseholme. Oh, what a beautiful bang, Georgie. You nearly
      hit Daisy. Call 'Five!' isn't that what they do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was feeling much surer of her ground. Georgie, bribed
      by a place on the golf-committee and by her admiration of
      his golf, and by her nobility with regard to Pug, was
      trotting back quick to her, and that was something. Next
      morning she had a hectic interview with Lady Ambermere. . .
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ambermere was said to be not at home, though Lucia had
      seen her majestic face at the window of the pink saloon. So
      she asked for Miss Lyall, the downtrodden companion, and
      waited in the hall. Her chauffeur had deposited the large
      brown-paper parcel with Pug inside on the much-admired
      tessellated pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Lyall," said Lucia. "So sad that dear Lady
      Ambermere is out, for I wanted to convey the grateful
      thanks of the Museum Committee to her for her beautiful
      gift of poor Pug. But they feel they can't . . . Yes,
      that's Pug in the brown-paper parcel. So sweet. But will
      you, on Lady Ambermere's return, make it quite clear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lyall, looking like a mouse, considered what her duty
      was in this difficult situation. She felt that Lady
      Ambermere ought to know Lucia's mission and deal with it in
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll see if Lady Ambermere has come in, Mrs. Lucas," she
      said. "She may have come in. Just out in the garden, you
      know. Might like to know what you've brought. O dear me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Miss Lyall scuttled away, and presently the door of
      the pink saloon was thrown open. After an impressive pause
      Lady Ambermere appeared, looking vexed. The purport of this
      astounding mission had evidently been conveyed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Lucas, I believe," she said, just as if she wasn't
      sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Lucia after all her Duchesses was not going to stand
      that. Lady Ambermere might have a Roman nose, but she
      hadn't any manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Ambermere, I presume," she retorted. So there they
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ambermere glared at her in a way that should have
      turned her to stone. It made no impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have come, I believe, with a message from the
      Committee of your little Museum at Riseholme, which I may
      have misunderstood."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia knew she was doing what neither Mrs. Boucher nor
      Daisy in their most courageous moments would have dared to
      do. As for Georgie . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Lady Ambermere," she said. "I don't think you've
      misunderstood it. A stuffed dog on a cushion. They felt
      that the Museum was not quite the place for it. I have
      brought it back to you with their thanks and regrets. So
      kind of you and--and so sorry of them. This is the parcel.
      That is all, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't quite all. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you aware, Mrs. Lucas," said Lady Ambermere, "that the
      mittens of the late Queen Charlotte are my loan to your
      little Museum?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia put her finger to her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mittens?" she said. "Yes, I believe there are some
      mittens. I think I have seen them. No doubt those are the
      ones. Yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was brilliant: it implied complete indifference on the
      part of the Committee (to which Lucia felt sure she would
      presently belong) as to what Lady Ambermere might think fit
      to do about mittens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Committee shall hear from me," said Lady Ambermere,
      and walked majestically back to the pink saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia felt sorry for Miss Lyall: Miss Lyall would probably
      not have a very pleasant day, but she had no real
      apprehensions, so she explained to the Committee, who were
      anxiously awaiting her return on the Green, about the
      withdrawal of these worsted relics.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bluff, just bluff," she said. "And even if it
      wasn't--Surely, dear Daisy, it's better to have no mittens
      and no Pug than both. Pug--I caught a peep of him through a
      hole in the brown paper--Pug would have made your Museum a
      laughing-stock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was she very dreadful?" asked Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a little silvery laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear Georgie, quite dreadful. You would have
      collapsed if she had said to you 'Mr. Pillson, I believe.'
      Wouldn't you, Georgie? Don't pretend to be braver than you
      are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think we ought all to be much obliged to you, Mrs.
      Lucas," said Mrs. Boucher. "And I'm sure we are. I should
      never have stood up to her like that! And if she takes the
      mittens away, I should be much inclined to put another pair
      in the case, for the case belongs to us and not to her,
      with just the label 'These Mittens did not belong to Queen
      Charlotte, and were not presented by Lady Ambermere.' That
      would serve her out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed gaily again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So glad to have been of use," she said. "And now, dear
      Daisy, will you be as kind to me as Georgie was yesterday
      and give me a little game of golf this afternoon? Not much
      fun for you, but so good for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy had observed some of Lucia's powerful strokes
      yesterday, and she was rather dreading this invitation for
      fear it should not be, as Lucia said, much fun for her.
      Luckily, she and Georgie had already arranged to play
      to-day, and she had, in anticipation of the dread event,
      engaged Piggy, Goosie, Mrs. Antrobus and Colonel Boucher to
      play with her on all the remaining days of that week. She
      meant to practise like anything in the interval. And then,
      like a raven croaking disaster, the infamous Georgie let
      her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd sooner not play this afternoon," he said. "I'd sooner
      just stroll out with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, Georgie?" said Lucia. "That will be nice then. Oh,
      how nervous I shall be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy made one final effort to avert her downfall, by
      offering, as they went out that afternoon, to give Lucia a
      stroke a hole. Lucia said she knew she could do it, but
      might they, just for fun, play level? And as the round
      proceeded, Lucia's kindness was almost intolerable. She
      could see, she said, that Daisy was completely off her
      game, when Daisy wasn't in the least off her game: she
      said, 'Oh, that was bad luck!' when Daisy missed short
      putts: she begged her to pick her ball out of bushes and
      not count it. . . . At half past four Riseholme knew that
      Daisy had halved four holes and lost the other five. Her
      short reign as Queen of Golf had come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Museum Committee met after tea at Mrs. Boucher's (Daisy
      did not hold her golfing-class in the garden that day) and
      tact, Georgie felt, seemed to indicate that Lucia's name
      should not be suggested as a new member of the Committee so
      swiftly on the heels of Daisy's disaster. Mrs. Boucher,
      privately consulted, concurred, though with some rather
      stinging remarks as to Daisy's having deceived them all
      about her golf, and the business of the meeting was chiefly
      concerned with the proposed closing down of the Museum for
      the winter. The tourist season was over, no char-a-bancs
      came any more with visitors, and for three days not a soul
      had passed the turnstile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So where's the use," asked Mrs. Boucher, "of paying a boy
      to let people into the Museum when nobody wants to be let
      in? I call it throwing money away. Far better close it till
      the spring, and have no more expense, except to pay him a
      shilling a week to open the windows and air it, say on
      Tuesday and Friday, or Wednesday and Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should suggest Monday and Thursday," said Daisy, very
      decisively. If she couldn't have it all her own way on the
      links, she could make herself felt on committees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Monday and Thursday," said Mrs. Boucher. "And
      then there's another thing. It's getting so damp in there,
      that if you wanted a cold bath, you might undress and stand
      there. The water's pouring off the walls. A couple of
      oil-stoves, I suggest, every day except when it's being
      aired. The boy will attend to them, and make it half a
      crown instead of a shilling. I'm going to Blitton
      to-morrow, and if that's your wish I'll order them. No:
      I'll bring them back with me, and I'll have them lit
      to-morrow morning. But unless you want to have nothing to
      show next spring but mildew, don't let us delay about it. A
      crop of mildew won't be sufficient attraction to visitors,
      and there'll be nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie rapped the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I vote we take the manuscript of 'Lucrezia' out, and
      that one of us keeps it till we open again," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be happy to keep it," said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie wanted it himself, but it was better not to thwart
      Daisy to-day. Besides, he was in a hurry, as Lucia had
      asked him to bring round his planchette and see if Abfou
      would not like a little attention. Nobody had talked to
      Abfou for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," he said, "and if that's all--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not sure I shouldn't feel happier if it was at the
      bank," said Mrs. Boucher. "Supposing it was stolen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie magnanimously took Daisy's side: he knew how Daisy
      was feeling. Mrs. Boucher was outvoted, and he got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that's all then, I'll be off," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy had a sort of conviction that he was going to do
      something with Lucia, perhaps have a lesson at golf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in presently?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't, I'm afraid," he said. "I'm busy till dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course, on her way home, she saw him hurrying across
      to The Hurst with his planchette.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      <a name="c11" id="c11">CHAPTER XI</a>
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia made no allusion whatever to her athletic triumph in
      the afternoon when Georgie appeared. That was not her way:
      she just triumphed, and left other people to talk about it.
      But her principles did not prevent her speaking about golf
      in the abstract.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must get more businesslike when you and I are on the
      Committee, Georgie," she said. "We must have competitions
      and handicaps, and I will give a small silver cup, the
      President's cup, to be competed for. There's no
      organisation at present, you see: great fun, but no
      organisation. We shall have to put our heads together over
      that. And foursomes: I have been reading about foursomes,
      when two people on one side hit the ball in turn. Pepino,
      I'm sure, would give a little cup for foursomes, the Lucas
      cup. . . . And you've brought the planchette? You must
      teach me how to use it. What a good employment for winter
      evenings, Georgie. And we must have some bridge
      tournaments. Wet afternoons, you know, and then tea, and
      then some more bridge. But we will talk about all that
      presently, only I warn you I shall expect you to get up all
      sorts of diversions for Pepino."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pepino adored London," she said, "and we must cheer him
      up, Georgie, and not let him feel dull. You must think of
      lots of little diversions: little pleasant bustling things
      for these long evenings: music, and bridge, and some
      planchette. Then I shall get up some Shakespeare readings,
      selections from plays, with a small part for Pepino and
      another for poor Daisy. I foresee already that I shall have
      a very busy autumn. But you must all be very kind and come
      here for our little entertainments. Madness for Pepino to
      go out after sunset. Now let us get to our planchette. How
      I do chatter, Georgie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie explained the technique of planchette, how
      important it was not to push, but on the other hand not to
      resist its independent motions. As he spoke Lucia glanced
      over the directions for planchette which he had brought
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may not get anything," he said. "Abfou was very
      disappointing sometimes. We can go on talking: indeed, it
      is better not to attend to what it does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Lucia, "let us go on talking then. How late
      you are, Georgie. I expected you half an hour ago. Oh, you
      said you might be detained by a Museum Committee meeting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we settled to shut the Museum up for the winter," he
      said. "Just an oil-stove or two to keep it dry. I
      wanted--and so did Mrs. Boucher, I know--to ask you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, for Planchette had already begun to throb in a
      very extraordinary manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe something is going to happen," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! How interesting!" said Lucia. "What do we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," said Georgie. "Just let it do what it likes.
      Let's concentrate: that means thinking of nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie of course had noticed and inwardly applauded the
      lofty reticence which Lucia had shown about Daisy's
      disaster this afternoon. But he had the strongest suspicion
      of her wish to weedj, and he fully expected that if Abfou
      'came through' and talked anything but Arabic, he would
      express his scorn of Daisy's golf. There would be scathing
      remarks, corresponding to 'snob' and those rude things
      about Lucia's shingling of her hair, and then he would feel
      that Lucia had pushed. She might say she hadn't, just as
      Daisy said she hadn't, but it would be very unconvincing if
      Abfou talked about golf. He hoped it wouldn't happen, for
      the very appositeness of Abfou's remarks before had
      strangely shaken his faith in Abfou. He had been willing to
      believe that it was Daisy's subconscious self that had
      inspired Abfou--or at any rate he tried to believe it--but
      it had been impossible to dissociate the complete Daisy
      from these violent criticisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planchette began to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably it's Arabic," said Georgie. "You never quite
      know. Empty your mind of everything, Lucia."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, and he looked up at her. She had that
      far-away expression which he associated with renderings of
      the Moonlight Sonata. Then her eyes closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planchette was moving quietly and steadily along. When it
      came near the edge of the paper, it ran back and began
      again, and Georgie felt quite sure he wasn't pushing: he
      only wanted it not to waste its energy on the tablecloth.
      Once he felt almost certain that it traced out the word
      'drive,' but one couldn't be sure. And was that
      'committee'? His heart rather sank: it would be such a pity
      if Abfou was only talking about the golf-club which no
      doubt was filling Lucia's subconscious as well as conscious
      mind. . . . Then suddenly he got rather alarmed, for
      Lucia's head was sunk forward, and she breathed with
      strange rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucia!" he said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia lifted her head, and Planchette stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, I felt quite dreamy," she said. "Let us go on
      talking, Georgie. Lady Ambermere this morning: I wish you
      could have seen her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Planchette has been writing," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Lucia. "Has it? May we look?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie lifted the machine. There was no Arabic at all, nor
      was it Abfou's writing, which in quaint little ways
      resembled Daisy's when he wrote quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vittoria," he read. "I am Vittoria."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, how silly," said Lucia, "or is it the Queen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see what she says," said Georgie. "I am Vittoria. I
      come to Riseholme. For proof, there is a dog and a
      Vecchia--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Italian," said Lucia excitedly. "You see, Vittoria
      is Italian. Vecchia means--let me see; yes, of course, it
      means 'old woman'. 'A dog, and an old woman who is angry.'
      O Georgie, you did that! You were thinking about Pug and
      Lady Ambermere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear I wasn't," said Georgie. "It never entered my
      head. Let's see what else. 'And Vittoria comes to tell you
      of fire and water, of fire and water. The strong elements
      that burn and soak. Fire and water and moonlight.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Georgie, what gibberish," said Lucia. "It's as silly as
      Abfou. What does it mean? Moonlight! I suppose you would
      say I pushed and was thinking of the Moonlight Sonata."
    </p>
    <p>
      That base thought had occurred to Georgie's mind, but where
      did fire and water come in? Suddenly a stupendous
      interpretation struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's most extraordinary!" he said. "We had a Museum
      Committee meeting just now, and Mrs. Boucher said the place
      was streaming wet. We settled to get some oil-stoves to
      keep it dry. There's fire and water for you!" Georgie had
      mentioned this fact about the Museum Committee, but so
      casually that he had quite forgotten he had done so. Lucia
      did not remind him of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I do call that remarkable!" she said. "But I daresay
      it's only a coincidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so at all," said Georgie. "I think it's most
      curious, for I wasn't thinking about that a bit. What else
      does it say? 'Vittoria bids you keep love and loyalty alive
      in your hearts. Vittoria has suffered, and bids you be kind
      to the suffering.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's curious!" said Lucia. "That might apply to Pepino,
      mightn't it? . . . O Georgie, why, of course, that was in
      both of our minds: we had just been talking about it. I
      don't say you pushed intentionally, and you mustn't say I
      did, but that might easily have come from us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's very strange," said Georgie. "And then, what
      came over you, Lucia? You looked only half-conscious. I
      believe it was what the planchette directions call light
      hypnosis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Lucia. "Light hypnosis, that means half-asleep,
      doesn't it? I did feel drowsy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a condition of trance," said Georgie. "Let's try
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia seemed reluctant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I won't, Georgie," she said. "It is so strange.
      I'm not sure that I like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't hurt you if you approach it in the right spirit,"
      said Georgie, quoting from the directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not again this evening, Georgie," said she. "Tomorrow
      perhaps. It is interesting, it is curious, and somehow I
      don't think Vittoria would hurt us. She seems kind. There's
      something noble, indeed, about her message."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much nobler than Abfou," said Georgie, "and much more
      powerful. Why, she came through at once, without pages of
      scribbles first! I never felt quite certain that Abfou's
      scribbles were Arabic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave a little indulgent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There didn't seem much evidence for it from what you told
      me," she said. "All you could be certain of was that they
      weren't English."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie left his planchette with Lucia, in case she would
      consent to sit again to-morrow, and hurried back, it is
      unnecessary to state, not to his own house, but to Daisy's.
      Vittoria was worth two of Abfou, he thought . . . that
      communication about fire and water, that kindness to the
      suffering, and, hardly less, the keeping of loyalty alive.
      That made him feel rather guilty, for certainly loyalty to
      Lucia had flickered somewhat in consequence of her
      behaviour during the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a short account of these remarkable proceedings
      (omitting the loyalty) to Daisy, who took a superior and
      scornful attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vittoria, indeed!" she said, "and Vecchia. Isn't that
      Lucia all over, lugging in easy Italian like that? And Pug
      and the angry old lady. Glorifying herself, I call it. Why,
      that wasn't even subconscious: her mind was full of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how about the fire and water?" asked Georgie. "It does
      apply to the damp in the Museum and the oil-stoves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy knew that her position as priestess of Abfou was
      tottering. It was true that she had not celebrated the
      mysteries of late, for Riseholme (and she) had got rather
      tired of Abfou, but it was gall and wormwood to think that
      Lucia should steal (steal was the word) her invention and
      bring it out under the patronage of Vittoria as something
      quite new.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pure fluke," said Daisy. "If she'd written mutton and
      music, you would have found some interpretation for it.
      Such far-fetched nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie was getting rather heated. He remembered how when
      Abfou had written 'death' it was held to apply to the
      mulberry-tree which Daisy believed she had killed by
      amateur root-pruning, so if it came to talking about
      far-fetched nonsense, he could have something to say.
      Besides, the mulberry-tree hadn't died at all, so that if
      Abfou meant that he was wrong. But there was no good in
      indulging in recriminations with Daisy, not only for the
      sake of peace and quietness, but because Georgie could
      guess very well all she was feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she didn't write about mutton and music," he observed,
      "so we needn't discuss that. Then there was moonlight. I
      don't know what that means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should call it moonshine," said Daisy brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it wrote moonlight," said Georgie. "Of course
      there's the Moonlight Sonata which might have been in
      Lucia's mind, but it's all curious. And I believe Lucia was
      in a condition of light hypnosis--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Light fiddlesticks!" said Daisy. . . . (Why hadn't she
      thought of going into a condition of light hypnosis when
      she was Abfouing? So much more impressive!) "We can all
      shut our eyes and droop our heads."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think it was light hypnosis," said Georgie firmly.
      "It was very curious to see. I hope she'll consent to sit
      again. She didn't much want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy profoundly hoped that Lucia would not consent to sit
      again, for she felt Abfouism slipping out of her fingers.
      In any case, she would instantly resuscitate Abfou, for
      Vittoria shouldn't have it all her own way. She got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, why shouldn't we see if Abfou has anything to say
      about it?" she asked. "After all, Abfou told us to make a
      museum, and that hasn't turned out so badly. Abfou was
      practical; what he suggested led to something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the notion that Daisy had thought of the museum and
      pushed flitted through George's mind, there was something
      in what she said, for certainly Abfou had written museum
      (if it wasn't 'mouse') and there was the Museum which had
      turned out so profitably for the Committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might try," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy instantly got out her planchette, which sadly wanted
      dusting, and it began to move almost as soon as they laid
      their hands on it: Abfou was in a rather inartistic hurry.
      And it really wasn't very wise of Daisy to close her eyes
      and snort: it was indeed light fiddlesticks to do that. It
      was a sheer unconvincing plagiarism from Lucia, and his
      distrust of Daisy and of Abfou immeasurably deepened.
      Furiously the pencil scribbled, going off the paper
      occasionally and writing on the table till Georgie could
      insert the paper under it: it was evident that Abfou was
      very indignant about something, and there was no need to
      inquire what that was. For some time the writing seemed to
      feel to Georgie like Arabic, but presently the pencil
      slowed down, and he thought some English was coming
      through. Finally Abfou gave a great scrawl, as he usually
      did when the message was complete, and Daisy looked
      dreamily up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been writing hard," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They examined the script. It began, as he had expected,
      with quantities of Arabic, and then (as he had expected)
      dropped into English, which was quite legible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beware of charlatans," wrote Abfou, "beware of Southern
      charlatans. All spirits are not true and faithful like
      Abfou, who instituted your Museum. False guides deceive. A
      warning from Abfou."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if that isn't convincing, I don't know what is,"
      said Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie thought it convincing too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The din of battle began to rise. It was known that very
      evening, for Colonel and Mrs. Boucher dined with Georgie,
      that he and Lucia (for Georgie did not give all the credit
      to Lucia) had received that remarkable message from
      Vittoria about fire and water and the dog and the angry old
      woman, and it was agreed that Abfou cut a very poor figure,
      and had a jealous temper. Why hadn't Abfou done something
      better than merely warn them against Southern Charlatans?
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it comes to that," said Mrs. Boucher, "Egypt is in the
      south, and charlatans can come from Egypt as much as from
      Italy. Fire and water! Very remarkable. There's the water
      there now, plenty of it, and the fire will be there
      to-morrow. I must get out my planchette again, for I put it
      away. I got sick of writing nothing but Arabic, even if it
      was Arabic. I call it very strange. And not a word about
      golf from Vittoria. I consider that's most important. If
      Lucia had been pushing, she'd have written about her golf
      with Daisy. Abfou and Vittoria! I wonder which will win."
    </p>
    <p>
      That summed it up pretty well, for it was felt that Abfou
      and Vittoria could not both direct the affairs of Riseholme
      from the other world, unless they acted jointly; and
      Abfou's remarks about the Southern charlatan and false
      spirits put the idea of a coalition out of the question.
      All the time, firm in the consciousness of Riseholme, but
      never under any circumstances spoken of, was the feeling
      that Abfou and Vittoria (as well as standing for
      themselves) were pseudonyms: they stood also for Daisy and
      Lucia. And how much finer and bigger, how much more gifted
      of the two in every way was Vittoria-Lucia. Lucia quickly
      got over her disinclination to weedj, and messages, not
      very definite, but of high moral significance came from
      this exalted spirit. There was never a word about golf, and
      there was never a word about Abfou, nor any ravings
      concerning inferior and untrustworthy spirits. Vittoria was
      clearly above all that (indeed, she was probably in some
      sphere miles away above Abfou), whereas Abfou's pages
      (Daisy sat with her planchette morning after morning and
      obtained sheets of the most voluble English) were blistered
      with denunciations of low and earth-born intelligences and
      dark with awful warnings for those who trusted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riseholme, in fact, had never been at a higher pitch of
      excited activity; even the arrival of the <i>Evening
      Gazette</i> during those weeks when Hermione had recorded
      so much about Mrs. Philip Lucas hadn't roused such emotions
      as the reception of a new message from Abfou or Vittoria.
      And it was Lucia again who was the cause of it all: no-one
      for months had cared what Abfou said, till Lucia became the
      recipient of Vittoria's messages. She had invested
      planchette with the interest that attached to all she did.
      On the other hand it was felt that Abfou (though certainly
      he lowered himself by these pointed recriminations) had
      done something. Abfou-Daisy had invented the Museum,
      whereas Vittoria-Lucia, apart from giving utterance to high
      moral sentiments, had invented nothing (high moral
      sentiments couldn't count as an invention). To be sure
      there was the remarkable piece about Pug and angry Lady
      Ambermere, but the facts of that were already known to
      Lucia, and as for the communication about fire, water and
      moonlight, though there were new oil-stoves in the damp
      Museum, that was not as remarkable as inventing the Museum,
      and moonlight unless it meant the Sonata was quite
      unexplained. Over this cavilling objection, rather timidly
      put forward by Georgie, who longed for some striking
      vindication of Vittoria, Lucia was superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Georgie, I can't tell you what it means," she said.
      "I am only the humble scribe. It is quite mysterious to me.
      For myself, I am content to be Vittoria's medium. I feel it
      a high honour. Perhaps some day it will be explained, and
      we shall see."
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, since no-one can live entirely on messages from
      the unseen, other interests were not neglected. There were
      bridge parties at The Hurst, there was much music, there
      was a reading of Hamlet at which Lucia doubled several of
      the principal parts and Daisy declined to be the Ghost. The
      new Committee of the golf-club was formed, and at the first
      meeting Lucia announced her gift of the President's Cup,
      and Pepino's of the Lucas Cup for foursomes. Notice of
      these was duly put up in the Club-house, and Daisy's face
      was of such a grimness when she read them that something
      very savage from Abfou might be confidently expected. She
      went out for a round soon after with Colonel Boucher, who
      wore a scared and worried look when he returned. Daisy had
      got into a bunker, and had simply hewed her ball to pieces.
      . . . Pepino's convalescence proceeded well; Lucia laid
      down the law a good deal at auction bridge, and the oil
      stoves at the Museum were satisfactory. They were certainly
      making headway against the large patches of damp on the
      walls, and Daisy, one evening, recollecting that she had
      not made a personal inspection of them, went in just before
      dinner to look at them. The boy in charge of them had put
      them out, for they only burned during the day, and
      certainly they were doing their work well. Daisy felt she
      would not be able to bring forward any objection to them at
      the next Committee meeting, as she had rather hoped to do.
      In order to hurry on the drying process, she filled them
      both up and lit them so that they should burn all night.
      She spilt a little paraffin, but that would soon evaporate.
      Georgie was tripping back across the green from a visit to
      Mrs. Boucher, and they walked homeward together.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie had dined at home that night, and working at a
      cross-word puzzle was amazed to see how late it was. He had
      pored long over a map of South America, trying to find a
      river of seven letters with P T in the middle, but he
      determined to do no more at it to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The tarsome thing," he said, "if I could get that, I'm
      sure it would give me thirty-one across."
    </p>
    <p>
      He strolled to the window and pushed aside the blind. It
      was a moonlight night with a high wind and a few scudding
      clouds. Just as he was about to let the blind drop again he
      saw a reddish light in the sky, immediately above his tall
      yew-hedge, and wondered what it was. His curiosity combined
      with the fact that a breath of air was always pleasant
      before going to bed, led him to open the front-door and
      look out. He gave a wild gasp of dismay and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows of the Museum were vividly illuminated by a red
      glow. Smoke poured out of one which apparently was broken,
      and across the smoke shot tongues of flame. He bounded to
      his telephone, and with great presence of mind rang up the
      fire-station at Blitton. "Riseholme," he called. "House on
      fire: send engine at once." He ran into his garden again,
      and seeing a light still in the drawing-room next door
      (Daisy was getting some sulphurous expressions from Abfou)
      tapped at the pane. "The Museum's burning," he cried, and
      set off across the Green to the scene of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time others had seen it too, and were coming out of
      their houses, looking like little black ants on a red
      table-cloth. The fire had evidently caught strong hold, and
      now a piece of the roof fell in, and the flames roared
      upwards. In the building itself there was no apparatus for
      extinguishing fire, nor, if there had been, could any one
      have reached it. A hose was fetched from the Ambermere
      Arms, but that was not long enough, and there was nothing
      to be done except wait for the arrival of the fire-engine
      from Blitton. Luckily the Museum stood well apart from
      other houses, and there seemed little danger of the fire
      spreading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the bell of the approaching engine was heard, but
      already it was clear that nothing could be saved. The rest
      of the roof crashed in, a wall tottered and fell. The
      longer hose was adjusted, and the stream of water directed
      through the windows, now here, now there, where the fire
      was fiercest, and clouds of steam mingled with the smoke.
      But all efforts to save anything were absolutely vain: all
      that could be done, as the fire burned itself out, was to
      quench the glowing embers of the conflagration. . . . As he
      watched, three words suddenly repeated themselves in
      Georgie's mind. "Fire, water, moonlight," he said a loud in
      an awed tone. . . . Victorious Vittoria!
    </p>
    <p>
      The committee, of course, met next morning, and Robert as
      financial adviser was specially asked to attend. Georgie
      arrived at Mrs. Boucher's house where the meeting was held
      before Daisy and Robert got there, and Mrs. Boucher could
      hardly greet him, so excited was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I call it most remarkable," she said. "Dog and angry old
      woman never convinced me, but this is beyond anything.
      Fire, water, moonlight! It's prophecy, nothing less than
      prophecy. I shall believe anything Vittoria says, for the
      future. As for Abfou--well--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She tactfully broke off at Daisy's and Robert's entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning," she said. "And good morning, Mr. Robert.
      This is a disaster, indeed. All Mr. Georgie's sketches, and
      the walking-sticks, and the mittens and the spit. Nothing
      left at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert seemed amazingly cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see it as such a disaster," he said. "Lucky I had
      those insurances executed. We get two thousand pounds from
      the Company, of which five hundred goes to Colonel Boucher
      for his barn--I mean the Museum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's something," said Mrs. Boucher. "And the rest?
      I never could understand about insurances. They've always
      been a sealed book to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the rest belongs to those who put the money up to
      equip the Museum," he said. "In proportion, of course, to
      the sums they advanced. Altogether four hundred and fifty
      pounds was put up, you and Daisy and Georgie each put in
      fifty. The rest, well, I advanced the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some rapid and silent calculations made. It
      seemed rather hard that Robert should get such a lot.
      Business always seemed to favour the rich. But Robert
      didn't seem the least ashamed of that. He treated it as a
      perfect matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The--the treasures in the Museum almost all belonged to
      the Committee," he went on. They were given to the Museum,
      which was the property of the Committee. Quite simple. If
      it had been a loan collection now--well, we shouldn't be
      finding quite such a bright lining to our cloud. I'll
      manage the insurance business for you, and pay you pleasant
      little cheques all round. The Company, no doubt, will ask a
      few questions as to the origin of the fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there's a mystery for you," said Mrs. Boucher. "The
      oil-stoves were always put out in the evening, after
      burning all day, and how a fire broke out in the middle of
      the night beats me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy's mouth twitched. Then she pulled herself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most mysterious," she said, and looked carelessly out of
      the window to where the debris of the Museum was still
      steaming. Simultaneously, Georgie gave a little start, and
      instantly changed the subject, rapping on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one thing we've forgotten," said he. "It wasn't
      entirely our property. Queen Charlotte's mittens were only
      on loan."
    </p>
    <p>
      The faces of the Committee fell slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A shilling or two," said Mrs. Boucher hopefully. "I'm only
      glad we didn't have Pug as well. Lucia got us out of that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the words of Vittoria about the dog and the angry
      old woman, and fire and water and moonlight occurred to
      everybody. Most of all they occurred to Daisy, and there
      was a slight pause, which might have become awkward if it
      had continued. It was broken by the entry of Mrs. Boucher's
      parlour-maid, who carried a letter in a large square
      envelope with a deep mourning border, and a huge coronet on
      the flap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Addressed to the Museum Committee, ma'am," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boucher opened it, and her face flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she's lost no time," she said. "Lady Ambermere. I
      think I had better read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please," said everybody in rather strained voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boucher read:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE OF RISEHOLME
      MUSEUM--<br>
      <br>
      Your little Museum, I hear, has been totally destroyed with
      all its contents by fire. I have to remind you therefore
      that the mittens of her late Majesty Queen Charlotte were
      there on loan, as lent by me. No equivalent in money can
      really make up for the loss of so irreplaceable a relic,
      but I should be glad to know, as soon as possible, what
      compensation you propose to offer me.<br>
      <br>
      The figure that has been suggested to me is £50, and an
      early cheque would oblige.<br>
      <br>
      <table align="right" width="300" summary="">
        <tr>
          <td align="left">
            Faithfully yours,
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="right">
          <td>
            CORNELIA AMBERMERE.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A dead silence succeeded, broken by Mrs. Boucher as soon as
      her indignation allowed her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would sooner," she said, "go to law about it, and appeal
      if it went against us, and carry it up to the House of
      Lords, than pay £50 for those rubbishy things. Why, the
      whole contents of the Museum weren't worth more than--well,
      leave it at that."
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure at which the contents of the Museum had been
      insured floated into everybody's mind, and it was more
      dignified to "leave it at that," and not let the
      imagination play over the probable end of Mrs. Boucher's
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting entirely concurred, but nobody, not even
      Robert, knew what to do next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I propose offering her £10," said Georgie at last, "and I
      call that handsome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five," said Daisy, like an auction reversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert rubbed the top of his head, as was his custom in
      perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Difficult to know what to do," he said. "I don't know of
      any standard of valuation for the old clothes of deceased
      queens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two," said Mrs. Boucher, continuing the auction, "and
      that's a fancy price. What would Pug have been, I wonder,
      if we're asked fifty pounds for two old mittens. A pound
      each, I say, and that's a monstrous price. And if you want
      to know who suggested to Lady Ambermere to ask fifty, I can
      tell you, and her name was Cornelia Ambermere."
    </p>

      This proposal of Lady Ambermere's rather damped the secret
      exaltation of the Committee, though it stirred a pleasant
      feeling of rage. Fifty pounds was a paltry sum compared to
      what they would receive from the Insurance Company, but the
      sense of the attempt to impose on them caused laudable
      resentment. They broke up, to consider separately what was
      to be done, and to poke about the ashes of the Museum, all
      feeling very rich. The rest of Riseholme were there, of
      course, also poking about, Piggie and Goosie skipping over
      smouldering heaps of ash, and Mrs. Antrobus, and the Vicar
      and the Curate, and Mr. Stratton. Only Lucia was absent,
      and Georgie, after satisfying himself that nothing whatever
      remained of his sketches, popped in to The Hurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was in the music room reading the paper. She had
      heard, of course, about the total destruction of the
      Museum, that ridiculous invention of Daisy and Abfou, but
      not a shadow of exultation betrayed itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, too sad about the Museum," she said. "All your
      beautiful things. Poor Daisy, too, her idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie explained about the silver lining to the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's so marvellous," he said, "is Vittoria. Fire,
      water, moonlight. I never heard of anything so
      extraordinary, and I thought it only meant the damp on the
      walls, and the new oil-stoves. It was prophetical, Lucia,
      and Mrs. Boucher thinks so too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia still showed no elation. Oddly enough, she had
      thought it meant damp and oil-stoves, too, for she did
      remember what Georgie had forgotten that he had told her
      just before the epiphany of Vittoria. But now this
      stupendous fulfilment of Vittoria's communication of which
      she had never dreamed, had happened. As for Abfou, it was a
      mere waste of time to give another thought to poor dear
      malicious Abfou. She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Georgie, it was strange," she said. "That was our
      first sitting, wasn't it? When I got so drowsy and felt so
      queer. Very strange indeed: convincing, I think. But
      whether I shall go on sitting now, I hardly know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but you must," said Georgie. "After all the rubbish--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia held up a finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Georgie, don't be unkind," she said. "Let us say,
      'Poor Daisy,' and leave it there. That's all. Any other
      news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie retailed the monstrous demand of Lady Ambermere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, as Robert says, it's so hard to know what to offer
      her," he concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia gave the gayest of laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, what would poor Riseholme do without me?" she
      said. "I seem to be made to pull you all out of
      difficulties. That mismanaged golf-club, Pug, and now
      there's this. Well, shall I be kind and help you once
      more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned over the leaves of her paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's it," she said. "Listen, Georgie. Sale at
      Pemberton's auction-rooms in Knightsbridge yesterday.
      Various items. Autograph of Crippen the murderer. Dear me,
      what horrid minds people have! Mother-of-pearl brooch
      belonging to the wife of the poet Mr. Robert Montgomery; a
      pair of razors belonging to Carlyle, all odds and ends of
      trumpery, you see. . . . Ah yes, here it is. Pair of riding
      gaiters, in good condition, belonging to His Majesty King
      George the Fourth. That seems a sort of guide, doesn't it,
      to the value of Queen Charlotte's mittens. And what do you
      think they fetched? A terrific sum, Georgie; fifty pounds
      is nowhere near it. They fetched ten shillings and
      sixpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Georgie. "And Lady Ambermere asked fifty
      pounds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Georgie, I suppose I must be good-natured," she
      said. "I'll draft a little letter for your committee to
      Lady Ambermere. How you all bully me and work me to death!
      Why, only yesterday I said to Pepino that those months we
      spent in London seemed a holiday compared to what I have to
      do here. Dear old Riseholme! I'm sure I'm very glad to help
      it out of its little holes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie gave a gasp of admiration. It was but a month or
      two ago that all Riseholme rejoiced when Abfou called her a
      snob, and now here they all were again (with the exception
      of Daisy) going to her for help and guidance in all those
      employments and excitements in which Riseholme revelled.
      Golf-competitions and bridge tournament, and duets, and
      real séances, and deliverance from Lady Ambermere, and
      above all, the excitement supplied by her personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're too wonderful," he said, "indeed, I don't know what
      we should do without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll scribble a little letter for you," she said,
      "bringing in the price of George the Fourth's gaiters in
      good condition. What shall we--I mean what shall you offer?
      I think you must be generous, Georgie, and not calculate
      the exact difference between the value of a pair of gaiters
      in good condition belonging to a king, and that of a pair
      of moth-eaten mittens belonging to a queen consort. Offer
      her the same; in fact, I think I should enclose a treasury
      note for ten shillings and six stamps. That will be more
      than generous, it will be munificent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sat down at her writing-table, and after a few
      minutes' thought, scribbled a couple of sides of note-paper
      in that neat handwriting that bore no resemblance to
      Vittoria's. She read them through, and approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that will settle it," she said. "If there is any
      further bother with the Vecchia, let me know. There's one
      more thing, Georgie, and then let us have a little music.
      How do you think the fire broke out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie felt her penetrating eye was on him. She had not
      asked that question quite idly. He tried to answer it quite
      idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's most mysterious," he said. "The oil stoves are always
      put out quite early in the evening, and lit again next
      morning. The boy says he put them out as usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia's eye was still on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, how do you think the fire broke out?" she
      repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Georgie felt thoroughly uncomfortable. Had Lucia
      the power of divination? . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," he said. "Have you any idea about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Lucia. "And so have you. I'll tell you my idea
      if you like. I saw our poor misguided Daisy coming out of
      the Museum close on seven o'clock last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So did I," said Georgie in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the oil-stoves must have been put out long before
      that," said Lucia. "Mustn't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how was it that there was a light coming out of the
      Museum windows? Not much of a light, but a little light, I
      saw it. What do you make of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia held up a censuring finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, you must be very dull this morning," she said.
      "What I make of it is that our poor Daisy lit the
      oil-stoves again. And then probably in her fumbling way,
      she spilt some oil. Something of the sort, anyhow. In fact,
      I'm afraid Daisy burned down the Museum."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a terrible pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are we to do?" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do?" she said. "Nothing, except never know anything about
      it. We know quite well that poor Daisy didn't do it on
      purpose. She hasn't got the pluck or the invention to be an
      incendiary. It was only her muddling, meddling ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the insurance money?" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about it? The fire was an accident, whether Daisy
      confessed what she had done or not. Poor Daisy! We must be
      nice to Daisy, Georgie. Her golf, her Abfou! Such
      disappointments. I think I will ask her to be my partner in
      the foursome for the Lucas Cup. And perhaps if there was
      another place on the golf-committee, we might propose her
      for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sighed, smiling wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pity she is not a little wiser," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia sat looking wistful for a moment. Then to Georgie's
      immense surprise she burst out into peals of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, what is the matter?" said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucia was helpless for a little, but she gasped and
      recovered and wiped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Georgie, you <i>are</i> dull this morning!" she said.
      "Don't you see? Poor Daisy's meddling has made the
      reputation of Vittoria and crumpled up Abfou. Fire, water,
      moonlight: Vittoria's prophecy. Vittoria owes it all to
      poor dear Daisy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's laughter set Lucia off again, and Pepino coming
      in found both at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Georgie," he said. "Terrible about the
      Museum. A sad loss. What are you laughing at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, <i>caro,"</i> said Lucia. "Just a little joke of
      Daisy's. Not worth repeating, but it amused Georgie and me.
      Come, Georgie, half an hour's good practice of celestial
      Mozartino. We have been lazy lately."
    </p>
