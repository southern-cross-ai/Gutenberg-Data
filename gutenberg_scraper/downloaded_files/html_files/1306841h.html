  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; OVER AND DONE.</h2>

  <p class="first">Sitting in the parsonage garden, in a white frock, with a
  pale green sash about her waist, leaning back against the red-brick wall, her
  glowing copper hair lit by the evening sun, was Judith Trevisa.</p>

  <p>She was tossing guelder-roses into the air; some dozens were strewn about
  her feet on the gravel, but one remained of the many she had plucked and
  thrown and caught, and thrown and caught again for a sunny afternoon hour. As
  each greenish-white ball of flowers went up into the air it diffused a faint
  but pleasant fragrance.</p>

  <p>"When I have done with you, my beauty, I have done altogether," said
  Judith.</p>

  <p>"With what?"</p>

  <p>Her father spoke. He had come up unperceived by the girl, burdened with a
  shovel in one hand and a bucket in the other, looking pale, weary, and
  worn.</p>

  <p>"Papa, you nearly spoiled my game. Let me finish, and I will speak."</p>

  <p>"Is it a very serious matter, Judith, and engrossing?"</p>

  <p>"Engrossing, but not serious, <i>Je m'amuse</i>."</p>

  <p>The old rector seated himself on the bench beside her, and he also leaned
  back against the red-brick, gold-and-gray-lichen-spotted wall, and looked
  into the distance before him, waiting till his daughter was ready to speak,
  not, perhaps, sorry to have a little rest first, for he was overtired. Had
  Judith not been absorbed in her ball-play with the guelder-rose bunch she
  would have noticed his haggard appearance, the green hue about his mouth, the
  sunken eyes, the beaded brow. But she was counting the rebounds of her ball,
  bent on sustaining her play as long as was possible to her.</p>

  <p>She formed a charming picture, fresh and pure, and had the old man not
  been overtired, he would have thought so with a throb of parental pride.</p>

  <p>She was a child in size, slender in build, delicate in bone, with face and
  hands of porcelain transparency and whiteness, with, moreover, that
  incomparable complexion only seen in the British Isles, and then only with
  red-gold hair.</p>

  <p>Her bronze-leather shoes were the hue of some large flies that basked and
  frisked on the warm wall, only slightly disturbed by the girl's play, to
  return again and run and preen themselves again, and glitter jewel-like as
  studs on that sun-baked, lichen-enamelled wall. Her eyes, moreover, were
  lustrous as the backs of these flies, iridescent with the changing lights of
  the declining sun, and the changed direction of her glance following the
  dancing ball of guelder-rose. Her long fingers might have been of china, but
  that when raised so that the sun struck their backs they were turned to a
  translucent rose. There was no color in her cheek, only the faintest
  suffusion of pink on the temples below where the hair was rolled back in
  waves of luminous molten copper dashing against the brick wall.</p>

  <p>"I have done my work," said the rector.</p>

  <p>"And I my play," responded the girl, letting the ball drop into her lap
  and rock there from one knee to the other. "Papa, this fellow is the
  conqueror; I have made him dance thirty-five great leaps, and he has not yet
  fallen&mdash;wilfully. I let him go down and get breath just now. There lie
  all my dancers dead about me. They failed very speedily."</p>

  <p>"You cannot be forever playing, Ju."</p>

  <p>"That is why I play now, papa. When playtime is over I shall be in earnest
  indeed."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" the old man sighed.</p>

  <p>Judith looked round, and was shocked to see how ill her father appeared to
  be.</p>

  <p>"Are you very tired, darling papa?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;overtired."</p>

  <p>"Have you been at your usual task?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ju&mdash;an unprofitable task."</p>

  <p>"Oh, papa!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, unprofitable. The next wind from the sea that blows&mdash;one will
  blow in an hour&mdash;and all my work is undone."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear papa!" Judith stooped and looked into the bucket.
  "Why!&mdash;what has made you bring a load of sand up here? We want none in
  the garden. And such a distance too!&mdash;from the church. No wonder you are
  tired."</p>

  <p>"Have I brought it?" he asked, without looking at the bucket.</p>

  <p>"You have, indeed. That, if you please, is unprofitable work, not the
  digging of the church out of the sand-heaps that swallow it."</p>

  <p>"My dear, I did not know that I had not emptied the pail outside the
  church-yard gate. I am very tired; perhaps that explains it."</p>

  <p>"No doubt about it, papa. It was work quite as unprofitable but much more
  exhausting than my ball-play. Now, papa, while you have been digging your
  church out of the sand, which will blow over it again to-night, you say, I
  have been pitching and tossing guelder-roses. We have been both wasting time,
  one as much as the other."</p>

  <p>"One as much as the other," repeated the old man. "Yes, dear, one as much
  as the other, and I have been doing it all my time here&mdash;morally,
  spiritually, as well as materially, digging the church out of the smothering
  sands, and all in vain&mdash;all profitless work. You are right, Ju."</p>

  <p>"Papa," said Judith hastily, seeing his discouragement and knowing his
  tendency to depression, "papa, do you hear the sea how it roars? I have stood
  on the bench, more than once, to look out seaward, and find a reason for it;
  but there is none&mdash;all blue, blue as a larkspur; and not a cloud in the
  sky&mdash;all blue, blue there too. No wind either, and that is why I have
  done well with my ball-play. Do you hear the roar of the sea, papa?" she
  repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ju. There will be a storm shortly. The sea is thrown into great
  swells of rollers, a sure token that something is coming. Before night a gale
  will be on us."</p>

  <p>Then ensued silence. Judith with one finger trifled with the guelder-rose
  bunch in her lap musingly, not desirous to resume her play with it. Something
  in her father's manner was unusual, and made her uneasy.</p>

  <p>"My dear!" he began, after a pause, "one must look out to sea&mdash;into
  the vast mysterious sea of the future&mdash;and prepare for what is coming
  from it. Just now the air is still, and we sit in this sweet, sunny garden,
  and lean our backs against the warm wall, and smell the fragrance of the
  flowers; but we hear the beating of the sea, and know that a mighty tempest,
  with clouds and darkness, is coming. So in other matters we must look out and
  be ready&mdash;count the time till it comes. My dear, when I am
  gone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Papa!"</p>

  <p>"We were looking out to sea and listening. That must come at some
  time&mdash;it may come sooner than you anticipate." He paused, heaved a sigh,
  and said, "Oh, Jamie! What are we to do about Jamie?"</p>

  <p>"Papa, I will always take care of Jamie."</p>

  <p>"But who will take care of you?"</p>

  <p>"Of me? Oh, papa, surely I can take care of myself!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Papa, you know how strong I am in will&mdash;how firm I can be with
  Jamie."</p>

  <p>"But all mankind are not Jamies. It is not for you I fear, as much as for
  you and him together. He is a trouble and a difficulty."</p>

  <p>"Jamie is not so silly and troublesome as you think. All he needs is
  application. He cannot screw his mind down to his books&mdash;to any serious
  occupation. But that will come. I have heard say that the stupidest children
  make the sharpest men. Little by little it will come, but it will come
  certainly. I will set myself as my task to make Jamie apply his mind and
  become a useful man, and I shall succeed, papa." She caught her father's hand
  between hers, and slapped it joyously, confidently. "How cold your hand is,
  papa! and yet you look warm."</p>

  <p>"You were always Jamie's champion," said her father, not noticing her
  remark relative to himself.</p>

  <p>"He is my twin brother, so of course I am his champion. Who else would be
  that, were not I?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no one else. He is mischievous and troublesome&mdash;poor, poor
  fellow. You will always be to Jamie what you are now, Ju&mdash;his protector
  or champion? He is weak and foolish, and if he were to fall into bad
  hands&mdash;I shudder to think what might become of him."</p>

  <p>"Rely on me, dearest father."</p>

  <p>Then he lifted the hand of his daughter, and looked at it with a faint
  smile. "It is very small, it is very weak, to fight for self alone, let alone
  yourself encumbered with Jamie."</p>

  <p>"I will do it, papa, do not fear."</p>

  <p>"Judith, I must talk very gravely with you, for the future is very dark to
  me; and I am unable with hand or brain to provide anything against the evil
  day. Numbness is on me, and I have been hampered on every side. For one
  thing, the living has been so poor, and my parishioners so difficult to deal
  with, that I have been able to lay by but a trifle. I believe I have not a
  relative in the world&mdash;none, at all events, near enough and known to me
  that I dare ask him to care for you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Papa, there is Aunt Dionysia."</p>

  <p>"Aunt Dionysia," he repeated, with a hesitating voice. "Yes; but Aunt
  Dionysia is&mdash;is not herself capable of taking charge of you. She has
  nothing but what she earns, and then&mdash;Aunt Dionysia
  is&mdash;is&mdash;well&mdash;Aunt Dionysia. I don't think you could be happy
  with her, even if, in the event of my departure, she were able to take care
  of you. Then&mdash;and that chiefly&mdash;she has chosen, against my express
  wishes&mdash;I may say, in defiance of me&mdash;to go as housekeeper into the
  service of the man, of all others, who has been a thorn in my side, a
  hinderer of God's work, a&mdash;But I will say no more."</p>

  <p>"What! Cruel Coppinger?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Cruel Coppinger. I might have been the means of doing a little good
  in this place, God knows! I only <i>think</i> I might; but I have been
  thwarted, defied, insulted by that man. As I have striven to dig my buried
  church out of the overwhelming sands, so have I striven to lift the souls of
  my poor parishioners out of the dead engulfing sands of savagery, brutality,
  very heathenism of their mode of life, and I have been frustrated. The winds
  have blown the sands back with every gale over my work with spade, and that
  stormblast Coppinger has devastated every trace of good that I have done, or
  tried to do, in spiritual matters. The Lord reward him according to his
  works."</p>

  <p>Judith felt her father's hand tremble in hers.</p>

  <p>"Never mind Coppinger now," she said, soothingly.</p>

  <p>"I must mind him," said the old man, with severe vehemence.
  "And&mdash;that my own sister should go, go&mdash;out of defiance, into his
  house and serve him! That was too much. I might well say, I have none to whom
  to look as your protector." He paused awhile, and wiped his brow. His pale
  lips were quivering. "I do not mean to say," said he, "that I acted with
  judgment, when first I came to S. Enodoc, when I spoke against smuggling. I
  did not understand it then. I thought with the thoughts of an inlander.
  Here&mdash;the sands sweep over the fields, and agriculture is in a measure
  impossible. The bays and creeks seem to invite&mdash;well&mdash;I leave it an
  open question. But with regard to wrecking&mdash;" His voice, which had
  quavered in feebleness, according with the feebleness of his judgment
  relative to smuggling, now gained sonorousness. "Wrecking, deliberate
  wrecking, is quite another matter. I do not say that our people are not
  justified in gathering the harvest the sea casts up. There always must be,
  there will be wrecks on this terrible coast; but there has been&mdash;I know
  there has been, though I have not been able to prove it&mdash;deliberate
  provocation of wrecks, and that is the sin of Cain. Had I been able to
  prove&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that now, dear papa. Neither I nor Jamie are, or will be,
  wreckers. Talk of something else. You over-excite yourself."</p>

  <p>Judith was accustomed to hear her father talk in an open manner to her.
  She had been his sole companion for several years, since his wife's death,
  and she had become the <i>confidante</i> of his inmost thoughts, his
  vacillations, his discouragements, not of his hopes&mdash;for he had none,
  nor of his schemes&mdash;for he formed none.</p>

  <p>"I do not think I have been of any use in this world," said the old
  parson, relapsing into his tone of discouragement, the temporary flame of
  anger having died away. "My sowing has produced no harvest. I have brought
  light, help, strength to none. I have dug all day in the vineyard, and not a
  vine is the better for it; all cankered and fruitless."</p>

  <p>"Papa&mdash;and me! Have you done nothing for me!"</p>

  <p>"You!"</p>

  <p>He had not thought of his child.</p>

  <p>"Papa! Do you think that I have gained naught from you? No strength, no
  resolution from seeing you toil on in your thankless work, without apparent
  results? If I have any energy and principle to carry me through I owe it to
  you."</p>

  <p>He was moved, and raised his trembling hand and laid it on her golden
  head.</p>

  <p>He said no more, and was very still.</p>

  <p>Presently she spoke. His hands weighed heavily on her head.</p>

  <p>"Papa, you are listening to the roar of the sea?"</p>

  <p>He made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Papa, I felt a cold breath; and see, the sun has a film over it. Surely
  the sea is roaring louder!"</p>

  <p>His hand slipped from her head and struck her shoulder&mdash;roughly, she
  thought. She turned, startled, and looked at him. His eyes were open, he was
  leaning back, almost fallen against the wall, and was deadly pale.</p>

  <p>"Papa, you are listening to the roar?"</p>

  <p>Then a thought struck her like a bullet in the heart.</p>

  <p>"Papa! Papa! My papa!&mdash;speak&mdash;speak!"</p>

  <p>She sprang from the bench&mdash;was before him. Her left guelder-rose had
  rolled, had bounded from her lap, and had fallen on the sand the old man had
  listlessly brought up from the church. His work, her play, were forever
  over.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; A PASSAGE OF ARMS.</h2>

  <p class="first">The stillness preceding the storm had yielded. A gale had
  broken over the coast, raged against the cliffs of Pentyre, and battered the
  walls of the parsonage, without disturbing the old rector, whom no storm
  would trouble again, soon to be laid under the sands of his buried
  church-yard, his very mound to be heaped over in a few years, and obliterated
  by waves of additional encroaching sand. Judith had not slept all night.
  She&mdash;she, a mere child, had to consider and arrange everything
  consequent on the death of the master of the house. The servants&mdash;cook
  and house-maid&mdash;had been of little, if any, assistance to her. When
  Jane, the house-maid, had rushed into the kitchen with the tidings that the
  old parson was dead, cook, in her agitation, upset the kettle and scalded her
  foot. The gardener's wife had come in on hearing the news, and had
  volunteered help. Judith had given her the closet-key to fetch from the
  stores something needed; and Jamie, finding access to the closet, had taken
  possession of a pot of raspberry jam, carried it to bed with him, and spilled
  it over the sheets, besides making himself ill. The house-maid, Jane, had
  forgotten in her distraction to shut the best bedroom casement, and the gale
  during the night had wrenched it from its hinges, flung it into the garden on
  the roof of the small conservatory, and smashed both. Moreover, the casement
  being open, the rain had driven into the room unchecked, had swamped the
  floor, run through and stained the drawing-room ceiling underneath, the drips
  had fallen on the mahogany table and blistered the veneer. A messenger was
  sent to Pentyre Glaze for Miss Dionysia Trevisa, and she would probably
  arrive in an hour or two.</p>

  <p>Mr. Trevisa, as he had told Judith, was solitary, singularly so. He was of
  a good Cornish family, but it was one that had dwindled till it had ceased to
  have other representative than himself. Once well estated, at Crockadon, in
  S. Mellion, all the lands of the family had been lost; once with merchants in
  the family, all the fortunes of these merchants industriously gathered had
  been dissipated, and nothing had remained to the Reverend Peter Trevisa but
  his family name and family coat, a garb or, on a field gules. It really
  seemed as though the tinctures of the shield had been fixed in the crown of
  splendor that covered the head of Judith. But she did not derive this wealth
  of red-gold hair from her Cornish ancestors, but from a Scottish mother, a
  poor governess whom Mr. Peter Trevisa had married, thereby exciting the wrath
  of his only sister and relative, Miss Dionysia, who had hitherto kept house
  for him, and vexed his soul with her high-handed proceedings. It was owing to
  some insolent words used by her to Mrs. Trevisa that Peter had quarrelled
  with his sister at first. Then when his wife died, she had forced herself on
  him as housekeeper, but again her presence in the house had become irksome to
  him, and when she treated his children&mdash;his delicate and dearly loved
  Judith&mdash;with roughness, and his timid, silly Jamie with harshness,
  amounting in his view to cruelty&mdash;harsh words had passed between them;
  sharp is, however, hardly the expression to use for the carefully worded
  remonstrances of the mild rector, though appropriate enough to her
  rejoinders. Then she had taken herself off and had become housekeeper to
  Curll Coppinger, Cruel Coppinger, as he was usually called, who occupied
  Pentyre Glaze, and was a fairly well-to-do single man.</p>

  <p>Mr. Trevisa had not been a person of energy, but one of culture and
  refinement; a dispirited, timid man. Finding no neighbors of the same mental
  texture, nor sympathetic, he had been driven to make of Judith, though a
  child, his companion, and he had poured into her ear all his troubles, which
  largely concerned the future of his children. In his feebleness he took
  comfort from her sanguine confidence, though he was well aware that it was
  bred of ignorance, and he derived a weak satisfaction from the thought that
  he had prepared her morally, at all events, if in no other fashion, for the
  crisis that must come when he was withdrawn.</p>

  <p>Mr. Peter Trevisa&mdash;Peter was a family Christian name&mdash;was for
  twenty-five years rector of S. Enodoc, on the north coast of Cornwall at the
  mouth of the Camel. The sand dunes had encroached on the church of S. Enodoc,
  and had enveloped the sacred structure. A hole was broken through a window,
  through which the interior could be reached, where divine service was
  performed occasionally in the presence of the church-wardens, so as to
  establish the right of the rectors, and through this same hole bridal parties
  entered to be coupled, with their feet ankle-deep in sand that filled the
  interior to above the pew-tops.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Trevisa was not the man to endure such a condition of affairs
  without a protest and an effort to remedy it. He had endeavored to stimulate
  the farmers and land-owners of the parish to excavate the buried church, but
  his endeavors had proved futile. There were several reasons for this. In the
  first place, and certainly foremost, stood this reason: as long as the church
  was choked with sand and could not be employed for regular divine service,
  the tithe-payers could make a grievance of it, and excuse themselves from
  paying their tithes in full, because, as they argued, "Parson don't give us
  sarvice, so us ain't obliged to pay'n." They knew their man, that he was
  tender-conscienced, and would not bring the law to bear upon them; he would
  see that there was a certain measure of justness in the argument, and would
  therefore not demand of them a tithe for which he did not give them the
  <i>quid pro quo</i>. But they had sufficient shrewdness to pay a portion of
  their tithes, so as not to drive him to extremities and exhaust his patience.
  It will be seen, therefore, that in the interests of their pockets the
  tithe-payers did not want to have their parish church excavated. Excavation
  meant weekly service regularly performed, and weekly service regularly
  performed would be followed by exaction of the full amount of rent-charge.
  Then, again, in the second place, should divine service be resumed in the
  church of S. Enodoc, the parishioners would feel a certain uneasiness in
  their consciences if they disregarded the summons of the bell; it might not
  be a very lively uneasiness, but just such an irritation as might be caused
  by a fly crawling over the face. So long as there was no service they could
  soothe their consciences with the thought that there was no call to make an
  effort to pull on Sunday breeches and assume a Sunday hat, and trudge to the
  church. Therefore, secondly, for the ease of their own consciences, it was
  undesirable that S. Enodoc should be dug out of the sand.</p>

  <p>Then lastly, and thirdly, the engulfment of the church gave them a
  cherished opportunity for being nasty to the rector, and retailing upon him
  for his incaution in condemning smuggling and launching out into anathema
  against wrecking. As he had made matters disagreeable to them&mdash;tried, as
  they put it, to take bread out of their mouths, they saw no reason why they
  should spend money to please him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Trevisa had made very little provision for his children, principally,
  if not wholly, because he could not. He had received from the farmers and
  land-owners a portion of tithe, and had been contented with that rather than
  raise angry feelings by demanding the whole. Out of that portion he was able
  to put aside but little.</p>

  <p>Aunt Dionysia arrived, a tall, bony woman, with hair turning gray, light
  eyes and an aquiline nose, a hard, self-seeking woman, who congratulated
  herself that she did not give way to feelings.</p>

  <p>"I feel," said she, "as do others, but I don't show my feelings as beggars
  expose their bad legs."</p>

  <p>She went into the kitchen. "Hoity-toity!" she said to the cook, "fine
  story this&mdash;scalding yourself. Mind this, you cook meals or no wage for
  you." To Jane, "The mischief you have done shall be valued and deducted from
  any little trifle my brother may have left you in his will. Where is Jamie?
  Give me that joint of fishing-rod; I'll beat him for stealing raspberry
  jam."</p>

  <p>Jamie, however, on catching a glimpse of his aunt had escaped into the
  garden and concealed himself. The cook, offended, began to clatter the
  saucepans.</p>

  <p>"Now, then," said Mrs. Trevisa&mdash;she bore the brevet-rank&mdash;"in a
  house of mourning what do you mean by making this noise, it is impertinent to
  me."</p>

  <p>The house-maid swung out of the kitchen, muttering.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Trevisa now betook herself up-stairs in quest of her niece, and found
  her with red eyes.</p>

  <p>"I call it rank <i>felo-de-se</i>," said Aunt Dionysia. "Every one
  knew&mdash;<i>he</i> knew, that he had a feeble heart, and ought not to be
  digging and delving in the old church. Who sent the sand upon it? Why,
  Providence, I presume. Not man. Then it was a flying in the face of
  Providence to try to dig it out. Who wanted the church? He might have waited
  till the parishioners asked for it. But there&mdash;where is Jamie? I shall
  teach him a lesson for stealing raspberry jam."</p>

  <p>"Oh, aunt, not now&mdash;not now!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Trevisa considered a moment, then laid aside the fishing-rod.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right. I am not up to it after my walk from Pentyre
  Glaze. Now, then, what about mourning? I do not suppose Jamie can be measured
  by guesswork. You must bring him here. Tell him the whipping is put off till
  another day. Of course you have seen to black things for yourself. Not? Why,
  gracious heavens! is everything to be thrown on my shoulders? Am I to be made
  a beast of burden of? Now, no mewling and pewking. There is no time for that.
  Whatever <i>your</i> time may be, <i>mine</i> is valuable. I can't be here
  forever. Of course every responsibility has been put on me. Just like
  Peter&mdash;no consideration. And what can I do with a set of babies? I have
  to work hard enough to keep myself. Peter did not want my services at one
  time; now I am put upon. Have you sent for the undertaker? What about
  clothing again? I suppose you know that you must have mourning? Bless my
  heart! what a lot of trouble you give me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Trevisa was in a very bad temper, which even the knowledge that it
  was seemly that she should veil it could not make her restrain. She was, no
  doubt, to a certain extent fond of her brother&mdash;not much, because he had
  not been of any advantage to her; and no doubt she was shocked at his death,
  but chiefly because it entailed on herself responsibilities and trouble that
  she grudged. She would be obliged to do something for her nephew and niece;
  she would have to provide a home for them somewhere. She could not take them
  with her to Coppinger's house, as she was there as a salaried servant, and
  not entitled to invite thither her young relatives. Moreover, she did not
  want to have them near her. She disliked young people; they gave trouble,
  they had to be looked after, they entailed expenses. What was she to do with
  them? Where was she to put them? What would they have to live upon? Would
  they call on her to part-maintain them? Miss Dionysia had a small sum put
  away, and she had no intention of breaking into it for them. It was a
  nest-egg, and was laid by against an evil day that might come on herself. She
  had put the money away for herself, in her old age, not for the children of
  her feeble brother and his lack-penny wife to consume as moth and rust. As
  these thoughts and questions passed through her mind, Aunt Dionysia pulled
  open drawers, examined cupboards, pried open closets, and searched chests and
  wardrobes.</p>

  <p>"I wonder now what he has put by for them," she said aloud.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean my dear papa?" asked Judith, whose troubled heart and shaken
  spirits were becoming angry and restless under the behavior of the hard,
  unfeeling woman.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," answered Mrs. Trevisa, facing round, and glaring malevolently
  at her niece. "It is early days to talk of this, but it must be done sooner
  or later, and if so, the sooner the better. There is money in the house, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>"I must know. You will want it&mdash;bills must be paid. You will eat and
  drink, I suppose? You must be clothed. I'll tell you what: I'll put the whole
  case into the hands of Lawyer Jenkyns, and he shall demand arrears of tithes.
  I know what quixotish conduct Peter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aunt, I will not allow this." A light flush came into the girl's
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well talking," said Aunt Dionysia; "but black is not
  white, and no power on earth can make me say that it is so. Money must be
  found. Money must be paid for expenses, and it is hard that I should have to
  find it; so I think. What money is there in the house for present
  necessities? I must know."</p>

  <p>Suddenly a loud voice was heard shouting through the house&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Mother Dunes! old Dunes! I want you."</p>

  <p>Judith turned cold and white. Who was this that dared to bellow in the
  house of death, when her dear, dear father lay up-stairs with the blinds
  down, asleep? It was an insult, an outrage. Her nerves had already been
  thrilled, and her heart roused into angry revolt by the cold, unfeeling
  conduct of the woman who was her sole relative in the world. And now, as she
  was thus quivering, there came this boisterous shout.</p>

  <p>"It is the master!" said Mrs. Trevisa, in an awestruck voice, lowered as
  much as was possible to her.</p>

  <p>To Coppinger alone she was submissive, cringing, obsequious.</p>

  <p>"What does he mean by this&mdash;this conduct?" asked Judith, trembling
  with wrath.</p>

  <p>"He wants me."</p>

  <p>Again a shout. "Dunes! old fool! the keys!"</p>

  <p>Then Judith started forward, and went through the door to the head of the
  staircase. At the foot stood a middle-sized, strongly built, firmly knit man,
  in a dress half belonging to the land and half to the sea, with high boots on
  his legs, and slouched hat on his head. His complexion was olive, his hair
  abundant and black, covering cheeks and chin and upper lip. His eyes were
  hard and dark. He had one brown hand on the banister, and a foot on the first
  step, as though about to ascend, when arrested by seeing the girl at the head
  of the stairs before him. The house was low, and the steps led without a
  break directly from the hall to the landing which gave communication to the
  bedrooms. There was a skylight in the roof over the staircase, through which
  a brilliant flood of pure white light fell over Judith, whereas every window
  had been darkened by drawn blinds. The girl had found no sombre dress
  suitable to wear, and had been forced to assume the same white gown as the
  day before, but she had discarded the green sash and had bound a black ribbon
  about her waist, and another about her abundant hair. A black lace kerchief
  was drawn over her shoulders across her breast and tied at her back. She wore
  long, black mittens.</p>

  <p>Judith stood motionless, her bosom rising and falling quickly, her lips
  set, the breath racing through her nostrils, and one hand resting on the
  banister at the stair-head.</p>

  <p>In a moment her eyes met those of Coppinger, and it was at once as though
  a thrill of electric force had passed between them.</p>

  <p>He desisted from his attempt to ascend, and said, without moving his eyes
  from hers, in a subdued tone, "She has taken the keys," but he said no more.
  He drew his foot from the step hesitatingly, and loosened his hand from the
  banister, down which went a thrill from Judith's quivering nerves, and he
  stepped back.</p>

  <p>At the same moment she descended a step, still looking steadily into the
  dark, threatening pupils, without blinking or lowering her orbs. Emboldened
  by her boiling indignation, she stood on the step she had reached with both
  feet firmly planted there, and finding that the banister rattled under her
  hand she withdrew it, and folded her arms. Coppinger raised his hand to his
  head and took off his hat. He had a profusion of dark, curly, flowing hair,
  that fell and encircled his saturnine face.</p>

  <p>Then Judith descended another step, and as she did so he retreated a step
  backwards. Behind him was the hall door, open; the light lay wan and white
  there on the gravel, for no sunshine had succeeded the gale. At every step
  that Judith took down the stair Coppinger retreated. Neither spoke; the hall
  was still, save for the sound of their breath, and his came as fast as hers.
  When Judith had reached the bottom she turned&mdash;Coppinger stood in the
  doorway now&mdash;and signed to her aunt to come down with the keys.</p>

  <p>"Take them to him&mdash;Do not give them here&mdash;outside."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Trevisa, surprised, confounded, descended the stair, went by her, and
  out through the door. Then Judith stepped after her, shut the door to exclude
  both Aunt Dionysia and that man Coppinger, who had dared, uninvited, on such
  a day to invade the house.</p>

  <p>She turned now to remount the stairs, but her strength failed her, her
  knees yielded, and she sank upon a step, and burst into a flood of tears and
  convulsive sobs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; CAPTAIN CRUEL.</h2>

  <p class="first">Captain Coppinger occupied an old farmhouse, roomy, low-
  built, granite quoined and mullioned, called Pentyre Glaze, in a slight dip
  of the hills near the cliffs above the thundering Atlantic. One ash shivered
  at the end of the house&mdash;that was the only tree to be seen near Pentyre
  Glaze. And&mdash;who was Coppinger? That is more than can be told. He had
  come&mdash;no one knew whence. His arrival on the north coast of Cornwall was
  mysterious. There had been haze over the sea for three days. When it lifted,
  a strange vessel of foreign rig was seen lying off the coast. Had she got
  there in the fog, not knowing her course; or had she come there knowingly,
  and was making for the mouth of the Camel? A boat was seen to leave the ship,
  and in it a man came ashore; the boat returned to the vessel, that thereupon
  spread sail and disappeared in the fog that re-descended over the water. The
  man gave his name as Coppinger&mdash;his Christian name, he said, was Curll,
  and he was a Dane; but though his intonation was not that of the Cornish, it
  was not foreign. He took up his residence in S. Enodoc at a farm, and
  suddenly, to the surprise of every one, became by purchase the possessor of
  Pentyre Glaze, then vacant and for sale. Had he known that the estate was
  obtainable when he had come suddenly out of the clouds into the place to
  secure it? Nobody knew, and Coppinger was silent.</p>

  <p>Thenceforth Pentyre Glaze became the harbor and den of every lawless
  character along the coast. All kinds of wild uproar and reckless revelry
  appalled the neighborhood day and night. It was discovered that an organized
  band of smugglers, wreckers, and poachers made this house the centre of their
  operations, and that "Cruel Coppinger" was their captain. There were at that
  time&mdash;just a century ago&mdash;no resident magistrates or gentry in the
  immediate neighborhood. The yeomen were bribed, by kegs of spirits left at
  their doors, to acquiesce in a traffic in illicit goods, and in the matter of
  exchange they took their shares. It was said that on one occasion a
  preventive man named Ewan Wyvill, who had pursued Coppinger in his boat, was
  taken by him, and his head chopped off by the captain, with his boat axe, on
  the gunwale. Such was the story. It was never proved. Wyvill had disappeared,
  and the body was recovered headless on the Doom Bar. That violence had been
  used was undoubted, but who had committed the crime was not known, though
  suspicion pointed to Coppinger. Thenceforth none ever called him Curll; by
  one consent he was named Cruel. In the West of England every one is given his
  Christian name. An old man is Uncle, and an old woman Aunt, and any one in
  command is a Captain. So Coppinger was known as Captain Cruel, or as Cruel
  Coppinger.</p>

  <p>Strange vessels were often seen appearing at regular intervals on the
  coast, and signals were flashed from the one window of Pentyre Glaze that
  looked out to sea.</p>

  <p>Among these vessels, one, a full-rigged schooner, soon became ominously
  conspicuous. She was for long the terror of the Cornish coast. Her name was
  The Black Prince. Once, with Coppinger on board, she led a revenue cutter
  into an intricate channel among the rocks, where, from knowledge of the
  bearings, The Black Prince escaped scathless, while the king's vessel
  perished with all on board.</p>

  <p>Immunity increased Coppinger's daring. There were certain bridle-roads
  along the fields over which he exercised exclusive control. He issued orders
  that no man should pass over them by night, and accordingly from that hour
  none ever did.[A]</p>

  <p>[A] Many stories of Cruel Coppinger may be found in Hawker's Footprints of
  Former Men in Cornwall. I have also told them in my Vicar of Morwenstow. I
  have ventured to translate the scene of Coppinger's activity further west,
  from Wellcombe to S. Enodoc. But, indeed, he is told of in many places on
  this coast.</p>

  <p>Moreover, if report spoke true&mdash;and reports do not arise without
  cause&mdash;Coppinger was not averse from taking advantage, and that unlawful
  advantage, of a wreck. By "lawful" and "unlawful" two categories of acts are
  distinguished, not by the laws of the land but by common consent of the
  Cornish conscience. That same Cornish conscience distinguished wrecking into
  two classes, as it distinguished then, and distinguishes still, witchcraft
  into two classes. The one, white witchcraft, is legitimate and profitable,
  and to be upheld; the other, black witchcraft, is reprehensible, unlawful,
  and to be put down. So with wrecking. The Bristol Channel teemed with
  shipping, flights of white sails passed in the offing, and these vessels
  were, when inward bound, laden with sugars and spices from the Indies, or
  with spirits and wines from France. If outward bound they were deep in the
  water with a cargo of the riches of England.</p>

  <p>Now, should a gale spring up suddenly and catch any of these vessels, and
  should the gale be&mdash;as it usually is, and to the Cornish folk, favorably
  is&mdash;from the northwest, then there was no harbor of refuge along that
  rock-bound coast, and a ship that could not make for the open was bound
  inevitably to be pounded to pieces against the precipitous walls of the
  peninsula. If such were the case, it was perfectly legitimate for every
  householder in the district to come down on the wreck and strip it of
  everything it contained.</p>

  <p>But, on the other hand, there was wrecking that was disapproved of, though
  practised by a few, so rumor said, and that consisted in luring a vessel that
  was in doubt as to her course, by false signals, upon a reef or bar, and
  then, having made a wreck of her, to pillage her. When on a morning after a
  night in which there had been no gale, a ship was found on the rocks, and
  picked as clean as the carcase of a camel in the desert, it was open to
  suspicion that this ship had not been driven there by wind or current; and
  when the survivors, if they reached the shore, told that they had been led to
  steer in the direction where they had been cast away by certain lights that
  had wholly deceived them, then it was also open to suspicion that these
  lights had been purposely exhibited for the sake of bringing that vessel to
  destruction; and when, further, it was proved that a certain set or gang of
  men had garnered all the profits, or almost all the profits, that accrued
  from a wreck, before the countryside was aware that a wreck had occurred,
  then it was certainly no very random conjecture that the wreck had been
  contrived in some fashion by those who profited by it. There were atrocious
  tales of murder of shipwrecked men circulating, but these were probably
  wholly, or at all events in part, untrue. If when a vessel ran upon the rocks
  she was deserted by her crew, if they took to the boats and made for shore,
  then there remained no impediment to the wreckers taking possession; it was
  only in the event of their finding a skipper on board to maintain right over
  the grounded vessel, or the mariners still on her engaged in getting her off,
  that any temptation to violence could arise. But it was improbable that a
  crew would cling to a ship on such a coast when once she was on the breakers.
  It was a moral certainty that they would desert her, and leave the wreck to
  be pillaged by the rats from shore, without offer of resistance. The
  character of the coast-wreckers was known to seamen, or rather a legend full
  of horror circulated relative to their remorseless savagery. The fear of
  wreckers added to the fear of the sea would combine to drive a crew, to the
  last man, into the boats. Consequently, though it is possible that in some
  cases murder of castaway men may have occurred, such cases must have been
  most exceptional. The wreckers were only too glad to build a golden bridge by
  which the wrecked might escape. Morally, without a question, those who lured
  a hapless merchantman upon the rocks were guilty of the deaths of those
  sailors who were upset in their boats in escaping from the vessel, or were
  dashed against the cliffs in their attempts to land, but there was no direct
  blood-guiltiness felt in such cases; and those who had reaped a harvest from
  the sea counted their gains individually, and made no estimate of the misery
  accruing thereby to others.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; HOP-O'-MY-THUMB.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Listen to me," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ju!"</p>

  <p>The orphans were together in the room that had been their father's, the
  room in which for some days he had lain with the blinds down, the atmosphere
  heavy with the perfume of flowers, and that indescribable, unmistakable scent
  of death. Often, every day, almost every hour, had Judith stolen into the
  room while he lay there, to wonder with infinite reverence and admiration at
  the purity and dignity of the dead face. It was that of the dear, dear
  father, but sublimed beyond her imagination. All the old vacillation was
  gone, the expression of distress and discouragement had passed away, and in
  their place had come a fixity and a calm, such as one sees in the busts of
  the ancient Roman Csars, but with a superadded ethereality, if such a word
  can be used, that a piece of pagan statuary never reached. Marvellous, past
  finding out, it is that death, which takes from man the spiritual element,
  should give to the mere clay a look of angelic spirituality, yet so it
  is&mdash;so it was with the dead Peter Trevisa; and Judith, with eyes filling
  as fast as dried, stood, her hands folded, looking into his face, felt that
  she had never loved, never admired him half enough when he was alive. Life
  had been the simmer in which all the scum of trivialities, of infirmities, of
  sordidness had come to and shown itself on the surface. Now Death had cleared
  these all away, and in the peaceful face of the dead was seen the
  <i>real</i>man, the nobility, sanctity, delicacy that formed the texture of
  his soul, and which had impressed the very clay wrapped about that volatile
  essence.</p>

  <p>As long as the dear father's body lay in the house Judith had not realized
  her utter desolation. But now the funeral was over, and she had returned with
  her brother to the parsonage, to draw up the blinds, and let the light once
  more enter, and search out, and revivify the dead rooms.</p>

  <p>She was very pale, with reddened eyes, and looking more fragile and
  transparent than ever she did before, worn and exhausted by tearful, wakeful
  nights, and by days of alternating gusts of sorrow and busy preparation for
  the funeral, of painful recollections of joyous days that were past, and of
  doubtful searchings into a future that was full of cloud.</p>

  <p>Her black frock served to enhance her pallor, and to make her look
  thinner, smaller than when in white or in color.</p>

  <p>She had taken her place in her father's high-backed leather chair, studded
  thick with brass nails, the leather dulled and fretted by constant use, but
  the nail-heads burnished by the same treatment.</p>

  <p>Her brother was in the same chair with her; both his arms were round her
  neck, and his head was on her shoulder. She had her right arm about his
  waist, her left was bowed, the elbow leaning on the chair arm, her hand
  folded inward, and her weary head rested on its back.</p>

  <p>The fine weather broken in upon by the gale had returned; the sun shone in
  unhindered at the window, and blazed on the children's hair; the brass nails,
  polished by friction, twinkled as little suns, but were naught in lustre to
  the gorgeous red of the hair of the twins, for the first were but brass, and
  the other of living gold.</p>

  <p>Two more lonely beings could hardly be discovered on the face of the
  earth&mdash;at all events in the peninsula of Cornwall&mdash;but the sense of
  this loneliness was summed in the heart of Judith, and was there articulate;
  Jamie was but dimly conscious of discomfort and bereavement. She knew what
  her father's death entailed on her, or knew in part, and conjectured more.
  Had she been left absolutely alone in the world her condition would have been
  less difficult than it was actually, encumbered with her helpless brother.
  Swimming alone in the tossing sea, she might have struck out with confidence
  that she could keep her head above water, but it was quite otherwise when
  clinging to her was a poor, half-witted boy, incapable of doing anything to
  save himself, and all whose movements tended only to embarrass her. Not that
  she regretted for an instant having to care for Jamie, for she loved him with
  sisterly and motherly love combined, intensified in force by fusion; if to
  her a future seemed inconceivable without Jamie, a future without him would
  be one without ambition, pleasure, or interest.</p>

  <p>The twin brother was very like her, with the same beautiful and abundant
  hair, delicate in build, and with the same refined face, but without the
  flashes of alternating mood that lightened and darkened her face. His had a
  searching, bewildered, distressed expression on it&mdash;the only expression
  it ever bore except when he was out of temper, and then it mirrored on its
  surface his inward ill-humor. His was an appealing face, a face that told of
  a spirit infantile, innocent, and ignorant, that would never grow stronger,
  but which could deteriorate by loss of innocence&mdash;the only charge of
  which it was capable. The boy had no inherent naughtiness in him, but was
  constantly falling into mischief through thoughtlessness, and he was
  difficult to manage because incapable of reasoning.</p>

  <p>What every one saw&mdash;that he never would be other than what he
  was&mdash;Judith would not admit. She acknowledged his inaptitude at his
  books, his frivolity, his restlessness, but believed that these were
  infirmities to be overcome, and that when overcome the boy would be as other
  boys are.</p>

  <p>Now these children&mdash;they were aged eighteen, but Jamie looked four
  years younger&mdash;sat in their father's chair, clinging to each other, all
  in all to one another, for they had no one else to love and who loved
  them.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Jamie."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ju, I be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't say 'I be'&mdash;say 'I am.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ju."</p>

  <p>"Jamie, dear!" she drew her arm tighter about him; her heart was bounding,
  and every beat caused her pain. "Jamie, dear, you know that, now dear papa is
  gone, and you will never see him in this world again, that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ju."</p>

  <p>"That I have to look to you, my brother, to stand up for me like a man, to
  think and do for me as well as for yourself&mdash;a brave, stout, industrious
  fellow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Ju."</p>

  <p>"I am a girl, and you will soon be a man, and must work for both of us.
  You must earn the money, and I will spend it frugally as we both require it.
  Then we shall be happy again, and dear papa in Paradise will be glad and
  smile on us. You will make an effort, will you not, Jamie? Hitherto you have
  been able to run about and play and squander your time, but now serious days
  have come upon us, and you must fix your mind on work and
  determine&mdash;Jamie&mdash;mind, screw your heart to a strong determination
  to put away childish things and be a man, and a strength and a comfort to
  me."</p>

  <p>He put up his lips to kiss her cheek, but could not reach it, as her head
  was leaning on her hand away from him.</p>

  <p>"What are you fidgeting at, my dear?" she asked, without stirring, feeling
  his body restless under her arm.</p>

  <p>"A nail is coming out," he answered.</p>

  <p>It was so; whilst she had been speaking to him he was working at one of
  the brass studs, and had loosened its bite in the chair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jamie! you are making work by thus drawing out a nail. Can you not
  help me a little, and reduce the amount one has to think of and do? You have
  not been attending to what I said, and I was so much in earnest." She spoke
  in a tone of discouragement, and the tone, more than the words, impressed the
  susceptible heart of the boy. He began to cry.</p>

  <p>"You are cross."</p>

  <p>"I am not cross, my pet; I am never cross with you, I love you too dearly;
  but you try my patience sometimes, and just now I am overstrained&mdash;and
  then I did want to make you understand."</p>

  <p>"Now papa's dead I'll do no more lessons, shall I?" asked Jamie,
  coaxingly.</p>

  <p>"You must, indeed, and with me instead of papa."</p>

  <p>"Not <i>rosa</i>, <i>ros</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, <i>rosa</i>, <i>ros</i>."</p>

  <p>Then he sulked.</p>

  <p>"I don't love you a bit. It is not fair. Papa is dead, so I ought not to
  have any more lessons. I hate <i>rosa</i>, <i>ros</i>!" He kicked the legs
  of the chair peevishly with his heels. As his sister said nothing, seemed to
  be inattentive&mdash;for she was weary and dispirited&mdash;he slapped her
  cheek by raising his hand over his head.</p>

  <p>"What, Jamie, strike me, your only friend?"</p>

  <p>Then he threw his arms round her again, and kissed her. "I'll love you;
  only, Ju, say I am not to do <i>rosa</i>, <i>ros</i>!"</p>

  <p>"How long have you been working at the first declension in the Latin
  grammar, Jamie?"</p>

  <p>He tried for an instant to think, gave up the effort, laid his head on her
  shoulder, and said:</p>

  <p>"I don't know and don't care. Say I am not to do <i>rosa</i>,
  <i>ros</i>!"</p>

  <p>"What! not if papa wished it?"</p>

  <p>"I hate the Latin grammar!"</p>

  <p>For a while both remained silent. Judith felt the tension to which her
  mind and nerves had been subjected, and lapsed momentarily into a condition
  of something like unconsciousness, in which she was dimly sensible of a
  certain satisfaction rising out of the pause in thought and effort. The boy
  lay quiet, with his head on her shoulder, for a while, then withdrew his
  arms, folded his hands on his lap, and began to make a noise by compressing
  the air between the palms.</p>

  <p>"There's a finch out there going 'chink! chink!' and listen, Ju, I can
  make 'chink! chink!' too."</p>

  <p>Judith recovered herself from her distraction, and said:</p>

  <p>"Never mind the finch now. Think of what I say. We shall have to leave
  this house."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Of course we must, sooner or later, and the sooner the better. It is no
  more ours."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is ours. I have my rabbits here."</p>

  <p>"Now that papa is dead it is no longer ours."</p>

  <p>"It's a wicked shame."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, Jamie. This house was given to papa for his life only; now it
  will go to a new rector, and Aunt Dunes[B] is going to fetch us away to
  another house."</p>

  <p>[B] Dunes is the short for Dionysia.</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"To-day."</p>

  <p>"I won't go," said the boy. "I swear I won't."</p>

  <p>"Hush, hush, Jamie! Don't use such expressions. I do not know where you
  have picked them up. We must go."</p>

  <p>"And my rabbits, are they to go too?"</p>

  <p>"The rabbits? We'll see about them. Aunt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I hate Aunt Dunes!"</p>

  <p>"You really must not call her that; if she hears you she will be very
  angry. And consider, she has been taking a great deal of trouble about
  us."</p>

  <p>"I don't care."</p>

  <p>"My dear, she is dear papa's sister."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't papa get a nicer sister&mdash;like you?"</p>

  <p>"Because he had to take what God gave him."</p>

  <p>The boy pouted, and began to kick his heels against the chair-legs once
  more.</p>

  <p>"Jamie, we must leave this house to-day. Aunt is coming to take us both
  away."</p>

  <p>"I won't go."</p>

  <p>"But, Jamie, I am going, and the cook is going, and so is Jane."</p>

  <p>"Are cook and Jane coming with us?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"We shall not want them. We cannot afford to keep them any more, to pay
  their wages; and then we shall not go into a house of our own. You must come
  with me, and be a joy and rest to me, dear Jamie."</p>

  <p>She turned her head over, and leaned it on his head. The sun glowed in
  their mingled hair&mdash;all of one tinge and lustre. It sparkled in the
  tears on her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Ju, may I have these buttons?"</p>

  <p>"What buttons?"</p>

  <p>"Look!"</p>

  <p>He shook himself free from his sister, slid his feet to the ground, went
  to a bureau, and brought to his sister a large open basket that had been
  standing on the top of the bureau. It had been turned out of a closet by Aunt
  Dionysia, and contained an accumulation of those most profitless of collected
  remnants&mdash;odd buttons, coat buttons, brass, smoked mother-of-pearl,
  shirt buttons, steel clasps&mdash;buttons of all kinds, the gathering
  together made during twenty-five years. Why the basket, after having been
  turned out of a lumber closet, had been left in the room of death, or why, if
  turned out elsewhere, it had been brought there, is more than even the
  novelist can tell. Suffice it that there it was, and by whom put there could
  not be said.</p>

  <p>"Oh! what a store of pretty buttons!" exclaimed the boy. "Do look, Ju,
  these great big ones are just like those on Cheap Jack's red waistcoat. Here
  is a brass one with a horse on it. Do see! Oh, Ju, please get your needle and
  thread and sew this one on to my black dress."</p>

  <p>Judith sighed. It was in vain for her to impress the realities of the
  situation on his wandering mind.</p>

  <p>"Hark!" she exclaimed. "There is Aunt Dunes. I hear her voice&mdash;how
  loud she speaks! She has come to fetch us away."</p>

  <p>"Where is she going to take us to?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know, Jamie."</p>

  <p>"She will take us into the forest and lose us, like as did
  Hop-o'-my-Thumb's father."</p>

  <p>"There are no forests here&mdash;hardly any trees."</p>

  <p>"She will leave us in the forest and run away."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, Jamie!"</p>

  <p>"I am sure she will. She doesn't like us. She wants to get rid of us. I
  don't care. May I have the basket of buttons?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jamie."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll be Hop-o'-my-Thumb."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE BUTTONS.</h2>

  <p class="first">It was as Judith surmised. Mrs. Dionysia Trevisa had come to
  remove her nephew and niece from the rectory. She was a woman decided in
  character, especially in all that concerned her interests. She had made up
  her mind that the children could not be left unprotected in the parsonage,
  and she could not be with them. Therefore they must go. The servants must
  leave; they would be paid their month's wage, but by dismissing them their
  keep would be economized. There was a factotum living in a cottage near, who
  did the gardening, the cinder-sifting, and boot-cleaning for the rectory
  inmates, he would look after the empty house, and wait on in hopes of being
  engaged to garden, sift cinders, and clean boots for the new rector.</p>

  <p>As it was settled that the children must leave the house, the next thing
  to consider was where they were to be placed. The aunt could not take them to
  Pentyre Glaze; that was not to be thought of. They must be disposed of in
  some other way.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Trevisa had determined on a sale of her brother's effects: his
  furniture, bedding, curtains, carpets, books, plate, and old sermons. She was
  anxious to realize as soon as possible, so as to know for certain what she
  could calculate upon as being left her for the support of Judith and her
  brother. To herself the rector had left only a ring and five guineas. She had
  not expected more. His decease was not likely to be a benefit, but, on the
  contrary, an embarrassment to her. He had left about a thousand pounds, but
  then Mrs. Trevisa did not yet know how large a bite out of this thousand
  pounds would be taken by the dilapidations on rectory, glebe, and chancel.
  The chancel of the church was in that condition that it afforded a wide
  margin for the adjudication of dilapidations. They might be set down at ten
  shillings or a thousand pounds, and no one could say which was the fairest
  sum, as the chancel was deep in sand and invisible. The imagination of the
  valuer might declare it to be sound or to be rotten, and till dug out no one
  could impeach his judgment.</p>

  <p>In those days, when an incumbent died, the widow and orphans of the
  deceased appointed a valuer, and the incoming rector nominated his valuer,
  and these two cormorants looked each other in the eyes&mdash;said to each
  other, "Brother, what pickings?" And as less resistance to being lacerated
  and cleaned to the bone was to be anticipated from a broken-hearted widow and
  helpless children than from a robust, red-faced rector, the cormorants
  contrived to rob the widow and the fatherless. Then that cormorant who had
  been paid to look after the interest of the widow and children and had not
  done it said to the other cormorant, "Brother, I've done you a turn this
  time; do me the like when the chance falls to you." Now, although nominally
  the money picked off the sufferers was to go to the account of the incomer,
  it was not allowed to pass till the cormorants had taken toll of it.
  Moreover, these cormorants were architects, builders, solicitors, or
  contractors of some sort, and looked to get something further out of the
  incoming man they favored, whereas they knew they could get nothing at all
  out of the departed man who was buried. Now we have pretended to change all
  this; let us persuade ourselves we have made the conduct of these matters
  more honest and just.</p>

  <p>Aunt Dionysia did not know by experience what valuers for dilapidations
  were, but she had always heard that valuation for dilapidations materially
  diminished the property of a deceased incumbent. She was consequently uneasy,
  and anxious to know the worst, and make the best of the circumstances that
  she could. She saw clearly enough that the sum that would remain when debts
  and valuation were paid would be insufficient to support the orphans, and she
  saw also with painful clearness that there would be a necessity for her to
  supplement their reduced income from her own earnings. This conviction did
  not sweeten her temper and increase the cordiality with which she treated her
  nephew and niece.</p>

  <p>"Now, hoity-toity!" said Aunt Dionysia; "I'm not one of your mewlers and
  pewkers. I have my work to do, and can't afford to waste time in the luxury
  of tears. You children shall come with me. I will see you settled in, and
  then Balhachet shall wheel over your boxes and whatever we want for the
  night. I have been away from my duties longer than I ought, and the maids are
  running wild, are after every one who comes near the place like horse-flies
  round the cattle on a sultry day. I will see you to your quarters, and then
  you must shift for yourselves. Balhachet can come and go between the rectory
  and Zachie Menaida as much as you want."</p>

  <p>"Are we going to Mr. Menaida's, aunt?" asked Judith.</p>

  <p>"Did I not say Zachie Menaida! If I said Zachie Menaida I suppose I meant
  what I said, or are you hard of hearing? Come&mdash;time to <i>me</i> is
  precious. Bustle&mdash;bustle&mdash;don't keep me waiting while you
  gape."</p>

  <p>After a while Mrs. Trevisa succeeded in getting her nephew and niece to
  start. Judith, indeed, was ready at the first suggestion to go with her aunt,
  glad to get over the pang of leaving the house as quickly as might be. It was
  to be the rupture of one thread of the tie that bound her to the past, but an
  important thread. She was to leave the house as a home, though she would
  return to it again and again to carry away from it such of her possessions as
  she required and could find a place for at Zachary Menaida's. But with Jamie
  it was otherwise. He had run away, and had to be sought, and when found
  coaxed and cajoled into following his aunt and sister.</p>

  <p>Judith had found him, for she knew his nooks and dens. He was seated in a
  laurel bush playing with the buttons.</p>

  <p>"Look, Ju! there is some broken mirror among the buttons. Stand still, and
  I will make the sun jump into your eyes. Open your mouth, and I will send him
  down your throat. Won't it be fun; I'll tease old Dunes with it."</p>

  <p>"Then come along with me."</p>

  <p>He obeyed.</p>

  <p>The distance to Zachary Menaida's cottage was about a mile and a quarter,
  partly through parish roads, partly through lanes, the way in parts walled
  and hedged up against the winds, in others completely exposed to every breath
  of air where it traversed a down.</p>

  <p>Judith walked forward with her aunt, and Jamie lagged. Occasionally his
  sister turned her head to reassure herself that he had not given them the
  slip; otherwise she attended as closely as she was able to the instructions
  and exhortations of her aunt. She and her brother were to be lodged
  temporarily at Uncle Zachie's, that is to say, with Mr. Menaida, an elderly,
  somewhat eccentric man, who occupied a double cottage at the little hamlet of
  Polzeath. No final arrangement as to the destination of the orphans could be
  made till Aunt Dunes knew the result of the sale, and how much remained to
  the children after the father's trifling debts had been paid, and the
  considerable slice had been cut out of it by the valuers for dilapidations.
  Mrs. Trevisa talked fast in her harsh tones, and in a loud voice, without
  undulation or softness in it, and expected her niece to hear and give account
  for everything she told her, goading her to attention with a sharp reminder
  when she deemed that her mind was relaxed, and whipping her thoughts together
  when she found them wandering. But, indeed, it was not possible to forget for
  one moment the presence and personality of Dionysia, though the subject of
  her discourse might be unnoticed.</p>

  <p>Every fibre of Judith's heart was strung and strained to the uttermost, to
  acutest feeling, and a sympathetic hand drawn across them would have produced
  a soft, thrilling, musical wail. Her bosom was so full to overflow that a
  single word of kindness, a look even that told of love, would have sufficed
  to make the child cast herself in a convulsion of grief into her aunt's arms,
  bury her face in her bosom, and weep out her pent-up tears. Then, after
  perhaps half an hour, she would have looked up through the rain into her
  aunt's face, and have smiled, and have loved that aunt passionately,
  self-sacrificingly, to her dying day. She was disposed to love her&mdash;for
  was not Dionysia the only relative she had; and was she not the very sister
  of that father who had been to her so much? But Mrs. Trevisa was not the
  woman to touch the taught cords with a light hand, or to speak or look in
  love. She was hard, angular, unsympathetic; and her manner, the intonations
  of her voice, her mode of address, the very movements of her body, acted on
  the strained nerves as a rasping file, that would fret till it had torn them
  through.</p>

  <p>Suddenly round a corner, where the narrow road turned, two hundred yards
  ahead, dashed a rider on a black steed, and Judith immediately recognized
  Coppinger on his famous mare Black Bess; a mare much talked of, named after
  the horse ridden by Dick Turpin. The recognition was mutual. He knew her
  instantly; with a jerk of the rein and a set of the brow he showed that he
  was not indifferent.</p>

  <p>Coppinger wore his slouched hat, tied under his chin and beard, a
  necessary precaution in that gale-swept country; on his feet to his knees
  were high boots. He wore a blue knitted jersey, and a red kerchief about his
  throat.</p>

  <p>Captain Cruel slightly slackened his pace, as the lane was narrow; and as
  he rode past his dark brow was knit, and his eyes flashed angrily at Judith.
  He deigned neither a glance nor a word to his housekeeper, who courtesied and
  assumed a fawning expression.</p>

  <p>When he had passed the two women he dug his spurs into Black Bess and
  muttered some words they did not hear.</p>

  <p>Judith, who had stood aside, now came forward into the midst of the
  roadway and rejoined her aunt, who began to say something, when her words and
  Judith's attention was arrested by shouts, oaths, and cries in their
  rear.</p>

  <p>Judith and her aunt turned to discover the occasion of this disturbance,
  and saw that Coppinger was off his horse, on his feet, dragging the brute by
  the rein, and was hurling his crop, or hunting-whip, as he pursued Jamie
  flying from him with cries of terror. But that he held the horse and could
  not keep up with the boy, Jamie would have suffered severely, for Coppinger
  was in a livid fury.</p>

  <p>Jamie flew to his sister.</p>

  <p>"Save me, Ju! he wants to kill me."</p>

  <p>"What have you done?"</p>

  <p>"It is only the buttons."</p>

  <p>"Buttons, dear?"</p>

  <p>But the boy was too frightened to explain.</p>

  <p>Then Judith drew her brother behind her, took from him the basket he was
  carrying, and stepped to encounter the angry man, who came on, now struggling
  with his horse, cursing Bess because she drew back, then plunging forward
  with his whip above his head brandished menacingly, and by this conduct
  further alarmed Black Bess.</p>

  <p>Judith met Coppinger, and he was forced to stay his forward course.</p>

  <p>"What has he done?" asked the girl. "Why do you threaten?"</p>

  <p>"The cursed idiot has strewn bits of glass and buttons along the road,"
  answered the Captain, angrily. "Stand aside that I may lash him, and teach
  him to frighten horses and endanger men's lives."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for what Jamie has done. I will pick up the things he has
  thrown down."</p>

  <p>Cruel Coppinger's eyes glistened with wrath. He gathered the lash of his
  whip into his palm along with the handle, and gripped them passionately.</p>

  <p>"Curse the fool! My Bess was frightened, dashed up the bank, and all but
  rolled over. Do you know he might have killed me?"</p>

  <p>"You must excuse him; he is a very child."</p>

  <p>"I will not excuse him. I will cut the flesh off his back if I catch
  him."</p>

  <p>He put the end of the crop handle into his mouth, and, putting his right
  hand behind him, gathered the reins up shorter and wound them more securely
  about his left hand.</p>

  <p>Judith walked backward, facing him, and he turned with his horse and went
  after her. She stooped and gathered up a splinter of glass. The sun striking
  through the gaps in the hedge had flashed on these scraps of broken mirror
  and of white bone, or burnished brass buttons, and the horse had been
  frightened at them. As Judith stooped and took up now a buckle, then a
  button, and then some other shining trifle, she hardly for an instant
  withdrew her eyes from Coppinger; they had in them the same dauntless
  defiance as when she encountered him on the stairs of the rectory. But now it
  was she who retreated, step by step, and he who advanced, and yet he could
  not flatter himself that he was repelling her. She maintained her strength
  and mastery unbroken as she retreated.</p>

  <p>"Why do you look at me so? Why do you walk backward?"</p>

  <p>"Because I mistrust you. I do not know what you might do were I not to
  confront you."</p>

  <p>"What I might do? What do you think I would do?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell. I mistrust you."</p>

  <p>"Do you think me capable of lashing at you with my crop?"</p>

  <p>"I think you capable of anything."</p>

  <p>"Flattering that!" he shouted, angrily.</p>

  <p>"You would have lashed at Jamie."</p>

  <p>"And why not? He might have killed me."</p>

  <p>"He might have killed you, but you should not have touched him&mdash;not
  have thought of touching him."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" She raised herself upright and looked straight into his eyes,
  in which fire flickered, flared, then decayed, then flared again.</p>

  <p>"You are no Dane, or you would not have asked 'Why not?' twice. Nay, you
  would not have asked it once."</p>

  <p>"Not a Dane?" His beard and mustache were quivering, and he snorted with
  anger.</p>

  <p>"A Dane, I have read in history, is too noble and brave to threaten women
  and to strike children."</p>

  <p>He uttered an oath and ground his teeth.</p>

  <p>"No; a Dane would never have thought of asking why not?&mdash;why not lash
  a poor little silly boy?"</p>

  <p>"You insult me! You dare to do it?"</p>

  <p>Her blood was surging in her heart. As she looked into this man's dark and
  evil face she thought of all the distress he had caused her father, and a
  wave of loathing swept over her, nerved her to defy him to the uttermost, and
  to proclaim all the counts she had against him.</p>

  <p>"I dare do it," she said, "because you made my own dear papa's life full
  of bitterness and pain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I! I never touched him, hardly spoke to him. I don't care to have to do
  with parsons."</p>

  <p>"You made his life one of sorrow through your godless, lawless ways,
  leading his poor flock astray, and bidding them mock at his warnings and
  despise his teachings. Almost with his last breath he spoke of you, and the
  wretchedness of heart you had caused him. And then you
  dared&mdash;yes&mdash;you dared&mdash;you dared to burst into our house where
  he lay dead, with shameful insolence to disturb its peace. And now&mdash;"
  she gasped, "and now, ah! you lie when you say you are a Dane, and talk of
  cutting and lashing the dead father's little boy on his father's burial day.
  You are but one thing I can name&mdash;a coward!"</p>

  <p>Did he mean it? No! But blinded, stung to madness by her words, especially
  that last, he raised his right arm with the crop.</p>

  <p>Did she mean it? No! But in the instinct of self-preservation, thinking he
  was about to strike her, she dashed the basket of buttons in his face, and
  they flew right and left over him, against the head of Black Bess, a rain of
  fragments of mirror, brass, steel, mother-of-pearl, and bone.</p>

  <p>The effect was instantaneous. The mare plunged, reared, threw Coppinger
  backward from off his feet, dashed him to the ground, dragged him this way,
  that way, bounded, still drawing him about by the twisted reins, into the
  hedge, then back, with her hoofs upon him, near, if not on, his head, his
  chest&mdash;then, released by the snap of the rein, or through its becoming
  disengaged, Bess darted down the lane, was again brought to a standstill by
  the glittering fragments on the ground, turned, rushed back in the direction
  whence she had come, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Judith stood panting, paralyzed with fear and dismay. Was he dead, broken
  to pieces, pounded by those strong hoofs?</p>

  <p>He was not dead. He was rolling himself on the ground, struggling clumsily
  to his knees.</p>

  <p>"Are you satisfied?" he shouted, glaring at her like a wild beast through
  his tangled black hair that had fallen over his face. "I cannot strike you
  nor your brother now. My arm and the Lord knows what other bones are broken.
  You have done that&mdash;and I owe you something for it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; UNCLE ZACHIE.</h2>

  <p class="first">The astonishment, the consternation of Mrs. Trevisa at what
  had occurred, which she could not fully comprehend, took from her the power
  to speak. She had seen her niece in conversation with Cruel Coppinger, and
  had caught snatches of what had passed between them. All his words had
  reached her, and some of Judith's. When, suddenly, she saw the girl dash the
  basket of buttons in the face of the Captain, saw him thrown to the ground,
  drawn about by his frantic horse, and left, as she thought, half dead, her
  dismay was unbounded. It might have been that Coppinger threatened Judith
  with his whip, but nothing could excuse her temerity in resisting him, in
  resisting him and protecting herself in the way she did. The consequences of
  that resistance she could not measure. Coppinger was bruised, bones were
  broken, and Aunt Dionysia knew the nature of the man too well not to expect
  his deadly animosity, and to feel sure of implacable revenge against the girl
  who had injured him&mdash;a revenge that would envelop all who belonged to
  her, and would therefore strike herself.</p>

  <p>The elderly spinster had naturally plenty of strength and hardness that
  would bear her through most shocks without discomposure, but such an incident
  as that which had just taken place before her eyes entirely unnerved and
  dismayed her.</p>

  <p>Coppinger was conveyed home by men called to the spot, and Mrs. Trevisa
  walked on with her niece and nephew in silence to the house of Mr. Zachary
  Menaida. Jamie had escaped over the hedge, to put a stone-and-earth barrier
  between himself and his assailant directly Judith interposed between him and
  Coppinger. Now that the latter was gone, he came, laughing, over the hedge
  again. To him what had occurred was fun.</p>

  <p>At Menaida's the aunt departed, leaving her nephew and niece with the old
  man, that she might hurry to Pentyre Glaze and provide what was needed for
  Coppinger. She took no leave of Judith. In the haze of apprehension that
  enveloped her mind glowed anger against the girl for having increased her
  difficulties and jeopardized her position with Coppinger.</p>

  <p>Mr. Zachary Menaida was an old man, or rather a man who had passed middle
  age, with grizzled hair that stood up above his brow, projecting like the
  beak of a ship or the horn of an unicorn. He had a big nose inclined to
  redness, and kindly, watery eyes, was close shaven, and had lips that,
  whenever he was in perplexity, or worried with work or thought, he thrust
  forward and curled. He was a middle-statured man, inclined to stoop.</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie, as he was commonly called behind his back, was a gentleman
  by birth. In the Roman Catholic Church there is a religious order called that
  of Minims. In England we have, perhaps, the most widely-diffused of orders,
  not confined to religion&mdash;it is that of Crotchets. To this order Mr.
  Menaida certainly belonged. He was made up of hobbies and prejudices that
  might bore, but never hurt others.</p>

  <p>Probably the most difficult achievement one can conceive for a man to
  execute is to stand in his own light; yet Mr. Menaida had succeeded in doing
  this all through his life. In the first place, he had been bred up for the
  law, but had never applied himself to the duties of the profession to which
  he had been articled. As he had manifested as a boy a love of music, his
  mother and sister had endeavored to make him learn to play on an instrument;
  but, because so urged, he had refused to qualify himself to play on
  pianoforte, violin, or flute, till his fingers had stiffened, whereupon he
  set to work zealously to practise, when it was no longer possible for him to
  acquire even tolerable proficiency.</p>

  <p>As he had been set by his father to work on skins of parchment, he turned
  his mind to skins of another sort, and became an eager naturalist and
  taxidermist.</p>

  <p>That he had genius, or rather a few scattered sparks of talent in his
  muddled brain, was certain. Every one who knew him said he was clever, but
  pitied his inability to turn his cleverness to purpose. But one must take
  into consideration, before accepting the general verdict that he was clever,
  the intellectual abilities of those who formed this judgment. When we do
  this, we doubt much whether their opinion is worth much. Mr. Menaida was not
  clever. He had flashes of wit, no steady light of understanding. Above all,
  he had no application, a little of which might have made him a useful member
  of society.</p>

  <p>When his articleship was over he set up as a solicitor, but what business
  was offered him he neglected or mismanaged, till business ceased to be
  offered. He would have starved had not a small annuity of fifty pounds been
  left him to keep the wolf from the door, and that he was able to supplement
  this small income with money made by the sale of his stuffed specimens of
  sea-fowl. Taxidermy was the only art in which he was able to do anything
  profitable. He loved to observe the birds, to wander on the cliffs listening
  to their cries, watching their flight, their positions when at rest, the
  undulations in their feathers under the movement of the muscles as they
  turned their heads or raised their feet; and when he set himself to stuff the
  skins he was able to imitate the postures and appearance of living birds with
  rare fidelity. Consequently his specimens were in request, and ornithologists
  and country gentlemen whose game-keepers had shot rare birds desired to have
  the skins dealt with, and set in cases, by the dexterous fingers of Mr.
  Zachary Menaida. He might have done more work of the same kind, but that his
  ingrained inactivity and distaste for work limited his output. In certain
  cases Mr. Menaida would not do what was desired of him till coaxed and
  flattered, and then he did it grumblingly and with sighs at being subjected
  to killing toil.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida was a widower; his married life had not been long; he had been
  left with a son, now grown to manhood, who was no longer at home. He was
  abroad, in Portugal, in the service of a Bristol merchant, an importer of
  wines.</p>

  <p>As already said, Uncle Zachie did not begin the drudgery of music till it
  was too late for him to acquire skill on any instrument. His passion for
  music grew with his inability to give himself pleasure from it. He occupied a
  double cottage at Polzeath, and a hole knocked through the wall that had
  separated the lower rooms enabled him to keep his piano in one room and his
  bird-stuffing apparatus in the other, and to run from one to the other in his
  favorite desultory way, that never permitted him to stick to one thing at a
  time.</p>

  <p>Into this house Judith and her brother were introduced. Mr. Menaida had
  been attached to the late rector, the only other gentleman in culture, as in
  birth, that lived in the place, and when he was told by Miss&mdash;or, as she
  was usually called, Mrs.&mdash;Trevisa that the children must leave the
  parsonage and be put temporarily with some one suitable, and that no other
  suitable house was available, he consented without making much objection to
  receive them into his cottage. He was a kindly man, gentle at heart, and he
  was touched at the bereavement of the children whom he had known since they
  were infants.</p>

  <p>After the first salutation Mr. Menaida led Judith and the boy into his
  parlor, the room opening out of his workshop.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said he, "what is that?" He pointed to his piano.</p>

  <p>"A piano, sir," answered Judith.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and mind you, I hate strumming, though I love music. When I am
  in, engaged at my labors, no strumming. I come in here now and then as
  relaxation, and run over this and that; then, refreshed, go back to my work,
  but, if there is any strumming, I shall be put out. I shall run my knife or
  needle into my hand, and it will upset me for the day. You
  understand&mdash;no strumming. When I am out, then you may touch the keys,
  but only when I am out. You understand clearly? Say the words after me: 'I
  allow no strumming.'"</p>

  <p>Judith did as required. The same was exacted of Jamie. Then Mr. Menaida
  said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Very well; now we shall have a dish of tea. I daresay you are tired. Dear
  me, you look so. Goodness bless me! indeed you do. What has tired you has
  been the trial you have gone through. Poor things, poor things! There, go to
  your rooms; my maid, Jump, will show you where they are, and I will see about
  making tea. It will do you good. You want it. I see it."</p>

  <p>The kind-hearted man ran about.</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul! where have I put the key of the caddy?
  And&mdash;really&mdash;my fingers are all over arsenical soap. I think I will
  leave Jump to make the tea. Jump, have you seen where I put the key? Bless my
  soul! where did I have it last? Never mind; I will break open the caddy."</p>

  <p>"Please, Mr. Menaida, do not do that for us. We can very well wait till
  the key is found."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I don't know when that will be. I shall have forgotten about it if I
  do not find the key at once, or break open the caddy. But, if you prefer it,
  I have some cherry-brandy, or I would give you some milk-punch."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no, indeed, Mr. Menaida."</p>

  <p>"But Jamie&mdash;I am sure he looks tired. A little cherry-brandy to draw
  the threads in him together. And suffer me, though not a doctor, to recommend
  it to you. Bless my soul! my fingers are all over arsenical soap. If I don't
  have some cherry-brandy myself I shall have the arsenic get into my system. I
  hope you have no cuts or scratches on your hand. I forgot the arsenic when I
  shook hands with you. Now, look here, Jump, bring in the saffron cake, and I
  will cut them each a good hunch. It will do you good, on my word it will. I
  have not spared either figs or saffron, and then&mdash;I will help you, as I
  love you. Come and see my birds. That is a cormorant&mdash;a splendid
  fellow&mdash;looks as if run out of metal, all his plumage, you know, and in
  the attitude as if swallowing a fish. Do you see!&mdash;the morsel is going
  down his throat. And&mdash;how much luggage have you? Jump! show the young
  lady where she can put away her gowns and all that sort of thing. Oh, not
  come yet? All right&mdash;a lady and her dresses are not long parted. They
  will be here soon. Now, then. What will you have?&mdash;some cold
  beef&mdash;and cider? Upon my soul!&mdash;you must excuse me. I was just
  wiring that kittiwake. Excuse me&mdash;I shall be ready in a moment. In the
  meantime there are books&mdash;Rollin's 'Ancient History,' a very reliable
  book. No&mdash;upon my word, my mind is distracted. I cannot get that
  kittiwake right without a glass of port. I have some good port. Oliver
  guarantees it&mdash;from Portugal, you know. He is there&mdash;first-rate
  business, and will make his fortune, which is more than his father ever
  did."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida went to a closet, and produced a bottle.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Jamie. I know what is good for you."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;please, Mr. Menaida, do not. He has not been accustomed to
  anything of the sort. Please not, sir."</p>

  <p>"Fudge!" said Uncle Zachie, holding up a glass and pouring cherry-brandy
  into it. "What is your age?&mdash;seventeen or eighteen, and I am fifty-two.
  I have over thirty years' more experience of the world than you. Jamie, don't
  be tied to your sister's apron-string. I know what is best for you. Girls
  drink water, men something better. Come here, Jamie!"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;I beseech you."</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul! I know what is good for him. Come to me, Jamie. Look the
  other way, Judith, if I cannot persuade you."</p>

  <p>Judith sighed, and covered her face with her hands. There was to be no
  help, no support in Uncle Zachie. On the contrary, he would break down her
  power over Jamie.</p>

  <p>"Jamie," she said, "if you love me, go up-stairs."</p>

  <p>"Presently, Ju. I want that first." And he took it, ran to his sister, and
  said:</p>

  <p>"It is good, Ju!"</p>

  <p>"You have disobeyed me, Jamie&mdash;that is bad."</p>

  <p>She stood on the threshold of further trouble, and she knew it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; A VISIT.</h2>

  <p class="first">No sleep visited Judith's eyes that night till the first
  streaks of dawn appeared, though she was weary, and her frail body and
  over-exerted brain needed the refreshment of sleep. But sleep she could not,
  for cares were gathering upon her.</p>

  <p>She had often heard her father, when speaking of Mr. Menaida, lament that
  he was not a little more self-controlled in his drinking. It was not that the
  old fellow ever became inebriated, but that he hankered after the bottle, and
  was wont to take a nip continually to strengthen his nerves, steady his hand,
  or clear his brain. There was ever ready some excuse satisfactory to his own
  conscience; and it was due to these incessant applications to the bottle that
  his hand shook, his eyes became watery, and his nose red. It was a danger
  Judith must guard against, lest this trick should be picked up by the
  childish Jamie, always apt to imitate what he should not, and acquire habits
  easily gained, hardly broken, that were harmful to himself. Uncle Zachie, in
  his good-nature, would lead the boy after him into the same habits that
  marred his own life.</p>

  <p>This was one thought that worked like a mole all night in Judith's brain;
  but she had other troubles as well to keep her awake. She was alarmed at the
  consequences of her conduct in the lane. She wondered whether Coppinger were
  more seriously hurt than had at first appeared. She asked herself whether she
  had not acted wrongly when she acted inconsiderately, whether in her
  precipitation to protect herself she had not misjudged Coppinger, whether, if
  he had attempted to strike her, it would not have been a lesser evil to
  receive the blow, than to ward it off in such a manner as to break his bones.
  Knowing by report the character of the man, she feared that she had incurred
  his deadly animosity. He could not, that she could see, hurt herself in the
  execution of his resentment, but he might turn her aunt out of his house.
  That she had affronted her aunt she was aware; Mrs. Trevisa's manner in
  parting with her had shown that with sufficient plainness.</p>

  <p>A strange jumble of sounds on the piano startled Judith. Her first thought
  and fear were that her brother had gone to the instrument, and was amusing
  himself on the keys. But on listening attentively she was aware that there
  was sufficient sequence in the notes to make it certain that the performer
  was a musician, though lacking in facility of execution. She descended the
  stairs and entered the little sitting-room. Uncle Zachie was seated on the
  music-stool, and was endeavoring to play a sonata of Beethoven that was
  vastly beyond the capacity of his stiff-jointed fingers. Whenever he made a
  false note he uttered a little grunt and screwed up his eyes, endeavored to
  play the bar again, and perhaps accomplish it only to break down in the
  next.</p>

  <p>Judith did not venture to interrupt him. She took up some knitting, and
  seated herself near the piano, where he might see her without her disturbing
  him. He raised his brows, grunted, floundered into false harmony, and
  exclaimed, "Bless me! how badly they do print music nowadays. Who, without
  the miraculous powers of a prophet, could tell that B should be natural?"
  Then, turning his head over his shoulder, addressed Judith, "Good-morning,
  missie. Are you fond of music?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, very."</p>

  <p>"So you think. Everyone says he or she is fond of music, because that
  person can hammer out a psalm tune or play the 'Rogue's March.' I hate to
  hear those who call themselves musical strum on a piano. They can't feel,
  they only execute."</p>

  <p>"But they can play their notes correctly," said Judith, and then flushed
  with vexation at having made this pointed and cutting remark. But it did not
  cause Mr. Menaida to wince.</p>

  <p>"What of that? I give not a thank-you for mere literal music-reading. Call
  Jump, set 'Shakespeare' before her, and she will hammer out a
  scene&mdash;correctly as to words; but where is the sense? Where the life?
  You must play with the spirit and play with the understanding also, as you
  must read with the spirit and read with the understanding also. It is the
  same thing with bird-stuffing. Any fool can ram tow into a skin and thrust
  wires into the neck, but what is the result? You must stuff birds with the
  spirit and stuff with the understanding also&mdash;or it is naught."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is the same with everything one does&mdash;one must do it
  heartily and intelligently."</p>

  <p>"Exactly! Now you should see my boy, Oliver. Have you ever met him?"</p>

  <p>"I think I have; but, to be truthful, I do not recollect him, sir."</p>

  <p>"I will bring you his likeness&mdash;in miniature. It is in the next
  room." Up jumped Mr. Menaida, and ran through the opening in the wall, and
  returned in another moment with the portrait, and gave it into Judith's
  hands.</p>

  <p>"A fine fellow is Oliver! Look at his nose how straight it is. Not like
  mine&mdash;that is a pump-handle. He got his good looks from his mother, not
  from me. Ah!" He reseated himself at the piano, and
  ran&mdash;incorrectly&mdash;over a scale. "It is all the pleasure I have in
  life, to think of my boy, and to look at his picture, and read his letters,
  and drink the port he sends me&mdash;first-rate stuff. He writes admirable
  letters, and never a month passes but I receive one. It would come expensive
  if he wrote direct, so his letter is enclosed in the business papers sent to
  the house at Bristol, and they forward it to me. You shall read his
  last&mdash;out loud. It will give me a pleasure to hear it read by you."</p>

  <p>"If I read properly, Mr. Menaida&mdash;with the spirit and with the
  understanding."</p>

  <p>"Exactly! But you could not fail to do that looking at the cheerful face
  in the miniature, and reading his words&mdash;pleasant and bright as himself.
  Pity you have not seen him; well, that makes something to live for. He has
  dark hair and blue eyes&mdash;not often met together, and when associated,
  very refreshing. Wait! I'll go after the letter: only, bless my soul! where
  is it? What coat did I have on when I read it? I'll call Jump. She may
  remember. Wait! do you recall this?"</p>

  <p>He stumbled over something on the keys which might have been anything.</p>

  <p>"It is Haydn. I will tell you what I think: Mozart I delight in as a
  companion; Beethoven I revere as a master; but Haydn I love as a friend. You
  were about to say something?"</p>

  <p>Judith had set an elbow on the piano and put her hand to her head, her
  fingers through the hair, and was looking into Uncle Zachie's face with an
  earnestness he could not mistake. She did desire to say something to him; but
  if she waited till he gave her an opportunity she might wait a long time. He
  jumped from one subject to another with alacrity, and with rapid
  forgetfulness of what he was last speaking about.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir, I am so very, very grateful to you for having received us into
  your snug little house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You like it? Well, I only pay seven pounds for it. Cheap, is it not? Two
  cottages&mdash;laborers' cottages&mdash;thrown together. Well, I might go
  farther and fare worse."</p>

  <p>"And, Mr. Menaida, I venture to ask you another favor, which, if you will
  grant me, you will lay me under an eternal obligation."</p>

  <p>"You may command me, my dear."</p>

  <p>"It is only this: not to let Jamie have anything stronger than a glass of
  cider. I do not mind his having that; but a boy like him does not need what
  is, no doubt, wanted by you who are getting old. I am so afraid of the habit
  growing on him of looking for and liking what is too strong for him. He is
  such a child, so easily led, and so unable to control himself. It may be a
  fancy, a prejudice of mine"&mdash;she passed her nervous hand over her
  face&mdash;"I do hope I am not offending you, dear Mr. Menaida; but I know
  Jamie so well, and I know how carefully he must be watched and checked. If it
  be a silly fancy of mine&mdash;and perhaps it is only a silly
  fancy&mdash;yet," she put on a pleading tone, "you will humor me in this,
  will you not, Mr. Menaida?"</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul! you have only to express a wish and I will fulfil it. For
  myself, you must know, I am a little weak; I feel a chill when the wind turns
  north or east, and am always relaxed when it is in the south or west; that
  forces me to take something just to save me from serious inconvenience, you
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Oh quite, sir."</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;confound it!&mdash;I am goaded on to work when
  disinclined. Why, there's a letter come to me now from Plymouth&mdash;a
  naturalist there, asking for more birds; and what can I do? I slave, I am at
  it all day, half the night; I have no time to eat or sleep. I was not born to
  stuff birds. I take it as an amusement, a pastime, and it is converted into a
  toil. I must brace up my exhausted frame; it is necessary to my health, you
  understand!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, Mr. Menaida. And you really will humor my childish whim?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, you may rely on me."</p>

  <p>"That is one thing I wanted to say. You see, sir, we have but just come
  into your house, and already, last night, Jamie was tempted to disobey me,
  and take what I thought unadvisable, so&mdash;I have been turning it over and
  over in my head&mdash;I thought I would like to come to a clear understanding
  with you, Mr. Menaida. It seems ungracious in me, but you must pity me. I
  have now all responsibility for Jamie on my head, and I have to do what my
  conscience tells me I should do; only, I pray you, do not take offence at
  what I have said."</p>

  <p>"Fudge! my dear; you are right, I dare say."</p>

  <p>"And now that I have your promise&mdash;I have that, have I not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, certainly."</p>

  <p>"Now I want your opinion, if you will kindly give it me. I have no father,
  no mother, to go to for advice; and so I venture to appeal to you&mdash;it is
  about Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger!" repeated Uncle Zachie, screwing up his brows and
  mouth. "Umph! He is a bold man who can give help against Captain Coppinger,
  and a strong man as well as bold. How has he wronged you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! he has not wronged me. It is I who have hurt him."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you!" Uncle Zachie laughed. "A little creature such as you
  could not hurt Captain Cruel!"</p>

  <p>"But, indeed, I have; I have thrown him down and broken his arms and some
  of his bones."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you?" Uncle Zachie's face of astonishment and dismay was so
  comical that Judith, in spite of her anxiety and exhaustion, smiled; but the
  smile was without brightness.</p>

  <p>"And pray, how in the name of wonder did you do that? Upon my word, you
  will deserve the thanks of the Preventive men. They have no love for him;
  they have old scores they would gladly wipe off with a broken arm, or, better
  still, a cracked skull. And pray how did you do this? With the
  flour-roller?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I will tell you the whole story."</p>

  <p>Then, in its true sequence, with great clearness, she related the entire
  narrative of events. She told how her father, even with his last breath, had
  spoken of Coppinger as the man who had troubled his life by marring his work;
  how that the Captain had entered the parsonage without ceremony when her dear
  father was lying dead up-stairs, and how he had called there boisterously for
  Aunt Dionysia because he wanted something of her. She told the old man how
  that her own feelings had been wrought, by this affront, into anger against
  Coppinger. Then she related the incident in the lane, and how that, when he
  raised his arm against her, she had dashed the buttons into his face,
  frightened his horse, and so produced an accident that might have cost the
  Captain his life.</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul!" exclaimed Mr. Menaida, "and what do you want? Is it an
  assault? I will run to my law-books and find out; I don't know that it can
  quite be made out a case of misadventure."</p>

  <p>"It is not that, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I have been racking my head to think what I ought to do under the
  circumstances. There can be no doubt that I aggravated him. I was very angry,
  both because he had been a trouble to my darling papa, and then because he
  had been so insolent as to enter our house and shout for Aunt Dunes; but
  there was something more&mdash;he had tried to beat Jamie, and it was my
  father's day of burial. All that roused a bad spirit in me, and I did say
  very bad words to him&mdash;words a man of metal would not bear from even a
  child, and I suppose I really did lash him to madness, and he would have
  struck me&mdash;but perhaps not, he might have thought better of it. I
  provoked him, and then I brought about what happened. I have been considering
  what I ought to do. If I remain here and take no notice, then he will think
  me very unfeeling, and that I do not care that I have hurt him in mind and
  body. It came into my head last night that I would ask aunt to apologize to
  him for what I had done, or, better still, should aunt not come here to-day,
  which is very likely, that I might walk with Jamie to Pentyre and inquire how
  Captain Coppinger is, and send in word by my aunt that I am sorry&mdash;very
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"Upon my soul, I don't know what to say. I could not have done this to
  Coppinger myself for a good deal of money. I think if I had, I would get out
  of the place as quickly as possible, while he was crippled by his broken
  bones. But then, you are a girl, and he may take it better from you than from
  me. Well&mdash;yes; I think it would be advisable to allay his anger if you
  can. Upon my word, you have put yourself into a difficult position. I'll go
  and look at my law-books, just for my own satisfaction."</p>

  <p>A heavy blow on the door, and without waiting for a response and
  invitation to enter, it was thrown open, and there entered Cruel Coppinger,
  his arm bandaged, tied in splints, and bound to his body, with his heavy
  walking-stick brandished by the uninjured hand. He stood for a moment
  glowering in, searching the room with his keen eyes till they rested on
  Judith. Then he made an attempt to raise his hand to his head, but
  ineffectually.</p>

  <p>"Curse it!" said he, "I cannot do it; don't tear it off my head with your
  eyes, girl. Here, you Menaida, come here and take my hat off. Come instantly,
  or she&mdash;she will do&mdash;the devil knows what she will not do to
  me."</p>

  <p>He turned, and with his stick beat the door back, that it slammed behind
  him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; A PATCHED PEACE.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Look at her!" cried Coppinger, with his back against the
  house door, and pointing to Judith with his stick.</p>

  <p>She was standing near the piano, with one hand on it, and was half turned
  toward him. She was in black, but had a white kerchief about her neck. The
  absence of all color in her dress heightened the lustre of her abundant and
  glowing hair.</p>

  <p>Coppinger remained for a moment, pointing with a half sneer on his dark
  face. Mr. Menaida had nervously complied with his demand, and had removed the
  hat from the smuggler, and his dark hair fell about his face. That face was
  livid and pale; he had evidently suffered much, and now every movement was
  attended with pain. Not only had some of his bones been broken, but he was
  bruised and strained.</p>

  <p>"Look at her!" he shouted again, in his deep commanding tones, and he
  fixed his fierce eyes on her and knitted his brows. She remained immovable,
  awaiting what he had to say. Though there was a flutter in her bosom, her
  hand on the piano did not shake.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, Captain Coppinger," said Judith, in a low, sweet voice,
  in which there was but a slight tremulousness. "I profess that I believe I
  acted wrongly yesterday, and I repeat that I am sorry&mdash;very sorry,
  Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>He made no reply. He lowered the stick that had been pointed at her, and
  leaned on it. His hand shook because he was in pain.</p>

  <p>"I acted wrongly yesterday," continued Judith, "but I acted under
  provocation that, if it does not justify what I did, palliates the wrong. I
  can say no more&mdash;that is the exact truth."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for what was wrong in my conduct&mdash;frankly sorry that you
  are hurt."</p>

  <p>"You hear her?" laughed Coppinger, bitterly. "A little chit like that to
  speak to me thus"&mdash;then, turning sharply on her, "Are you not
  afraid?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am not afraid; why should I be?"</p>

  <p>"Why? Ask any one in S. Enodoc&mdash;any one in Cornwall&mdash;who has
  heard my name."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon. I do not want to ask any one else in S. Enodoc, any
  one else in Cornwall. I ask you."</p>

  <p>"Me? You ask me why you should be afraid of me?" He paused, drew his thick
  brows together till they formed a band across his forehead. "I tell you that
  none has ever wronged me by a blade of grass or a flock of wool but has paid
  for it a thousand-fold. And none has ever hurt me as you have done&mdash;none
  has ever dared to attempt it."</p>

  <p>"I have said that I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"You talk like one cold as a mermaid. I do not believe in your
  fearlessness. Why do you lean on the piano. There, touch the wires with the
  very tips of your fingers, and let me hear if they give a sound&mdash;and
  sound they will if you tremble."</p>

  <p>Judith exposed some of the wires by raising the top of the piano. Then she
  smiled, and stood with the tips of her delicate fingers just touching the
  chords. Coppinger listened, so did Uncle Zachie, and not a vibration could
  they detect.</p>

  <p>Presently she withdrew her hand, and said, "Is not that enough? When a
  girl says, 'I am sorry,' I supposed the chapter was done and the book
  closed."</p>

  <p>"You have strange ideas."</p>

  <p>"I have those in which I was brought up by the best of fathers."</p>

  <p>Coppinger thrust his stick along the floor.</p>

  <p>"Is it due to the ideas in which you have been brought up that you are not
  afraid&mdash;when you have reduced me to a wreck?"</p>

  <p>"And you?&mdash;are you afraid of the wreck that you have made?"</p>

  <p>The dark blood sprang into and suffused his whole face. Uncle Zachie drew
  back against the wall and made signs to Judith not to provoke their
  self-invited visitor; but she was looking steadily at the Captain, and did
  not observe the signals. In Coppinger's presence she felt nerved to stand on
  the defensive, and more, to attack. A threat in his whole bearing, in his
  manner of addressing her, roused every energy she possessed.</p>

  <p>"I tell you," said he, harshly, "if any man had used the word you threw at
  me yesterday, I would have murdered him; I would have split his skull with
  the handle of my crop."</p>

  <p>"You raised your hand to do it to me," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"No!" he exclaimed, violently. "It is false; come here, and let me see if
  you have the courage, the fearlessness you affect. You women are past-masters
  of dissembling. Come here; kneel before me and let me raise my stick over
  you. See; there is lead in the handle, and with one blow I can split your
  skull and dash the brains over the floor."</p>

  <p>Judith remained immovable.</p>

  <p>"I thought it&mdash;you are afraid."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>He let himself, with some pain, slowly into a chair.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid. You know what to expect. Ah! I could fell you and trample
  on you and break your bones, as I was cast down, trampled on, and broken in
  my bones yesterday&mdash;by you, or through you. Are you afraid?"</p>

  <p>She took a step toward him. Then Uncle Zachie waved her back, in great
  alarm. He caught Judith's attention, and she answered him, "I am not afraid.
  I gave him a word I should not have given him yesterday. I will show him that
  I retract it fully." Then she stepped up to Coppinger and sank on her knees
  before him. He raised his whip, with the loaded handle, brandishing it over
  her.</p>

  <p>"Now I am here," she said, "I again ask your forgiveness, but I protest an
  apology is due to me."</p>

  <p>He threw his stick away. "By heaven, it is!" Then in an altered tone,
  "Take it so, that I ask your forgiveness. Get up; do not kneel to me. I could
  not have struck you down had I willed, my arm is stiff. Perhaps you knew
  it."</p>

  <p>He rose with effort to his feet again. Judith drew back to her former
  position by the piano, two hectic spots of flame were in her cheek, and her
  eyes were preternaturally bright.</p>

  <p>Coppinger looked steadily at her for a while, then he said, "Are you ill?
  You look as if you were."</p>

  <p>"I have had much to go through of late."</p>

  <p>"True."</p>

  <p>He remained looking at her, brooding over something in his mind. She
  perplexed him; he wondered at her. He could not comprehend the spirit that
  was in her, that sustained a delicate little frame, and made her defy
  him.</p>

  <p>His eyes wandered round the room, and he signed to Uncle Zachie to give
  him his stick again.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" said he, pointing to the miniature on the stand for music,
  where Mr. Menaida had put it, over a sheet of the music he had been playing,
  or attempting to play.</p>

  <p>"It is my son, Oliver," said Uncle Zachie.</p>

  <p>"Why is it there? Has she been looking at it? Let me see it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida hesitated, but presently handed it to the redoubted Captain,
  with nervous twitches in his face. "I value it highly&mdash;my only
  child."</p>

  <p>Coppinger looked at it, with a curl of his lips; then handed it back to
  Mr. Menaida.</p>

  <p>"Why is it here?"</p>

  <p>"I brought it here to show it her. I am very proud of my son," said Uncle
  Zachie.</p>

  <p>Coppinger was in an irritable mood, captious about trifles. Why did he ask
  questions about this little picture? Why look suspiciously at Judith as he
  did so&mdash;suspiciously and threateningly?</p>

  <p>"Do you play on the piano?" asked Coppinger. "When the evil spirit was on
  Saul, David struck the harp and sent the spirit away. Let me hear how you can
  touch the notes. It may do me good. Heaven knows it is not often I have the
  leisure, or the occasion, or am in the humor for music. I would hear what you
  can do."</p>

  <p>Judith looked at Uncle Zachie.</p>

  <p>"I cannot play," she said; "that is to say, I can play, but not now, and
  on this piano."</p>

  <p>But Mr. Menaida interfered and urged her to play. He was afraid of
  Coppinger.</p>

  <p>She seated herself on the music-stool and considered for a moment. The
  miniature was again on the stand. Coppinger put out his stick and thrust it
  off, and it would have fallen had not Judith caught it. She gave it to Mr.
  Menaida, who hastily carried it into the adjoining room, where the sight of
  it might no longer irritate the Captain.</p>

  <p>"What shall I play? I mean, strum?" asked Judith, looking at Uncle Zachie.
  "Beethoven! No&mdash;Haydn. Here are his 'Seasons.' I can play 'Spring.'"</p>

  <p>She had a light, but firm touch. Her father had been a man of great
  musical taste, and he had instructed her. But she had, moreover, the musical
  faculty in her, and she played with the spirit and with the understanding
  also. Wondrous is the power of music, passing that of fabled necromancy. It
  takes a man up out of his most sordid surroundings, and sets him in heavenly
  places. It touches fibres of the inner nature, lost, forgotten, ignored, and
  makes them thrill with a new life. It seals the eyes to outward sights, and
  unfurls new vistas full of transcendental beauty; it breathes over hot wounds
  and heals them; it calls to the surface springs of pure delight, and bids
  them gush forth in an arid desert.</p>

  <p>It was so now, as, under the sympathetic fingers of Judith, Haydn's song
  of the "Spring" was sung. A May world arose in that little dingy room; the
  walls fell back and disclosed green woods thick with red robin and bursting
  bluebells, fields golden with buttercups, hawthorns clothed in flower, from
  which sang the blackbird, thrush, the finch, and the ouzel. The low ceiling
  rose and overarched as the speed-well blue vault of heaven, the close
  atmosphere was dispelled by a waft of crisp, pure air; shepherds piped, Boy
  Blue blew his horn, and milkmaids rattled their pails and danced a ballet on
  the turf; and over all, down into every corner of the soul, streamed the
  glorious, golden sun, filling the heart with gladness.</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie had been standing at the door leading into his workshop,
  hesitating whether to remain, with a pish! and a pshaw! or to fly away beyond
  hearing. But he was arrested, then drawn lightly, irresistibly, step by step,
  toward the piano, and he noiselessly sank upon a chair, with his eyes fixed
  on Judith's fingers as they danced over the keys. His features assumed a more
  refined character as he listened; the water rose into his eyes, his lips
  quivered, and when, before reaching the end of the piece, Judith faltered and
  stopped, he laid his hand on her wrist and said: "My dear&mdash;you play, you
  do not strum. Play when you will&mdash;never can it be too long, too much for
  me. It may steady my hand, it may dispel the chill and the damp better
  than&mdash;but never mind&mdash;never mind."</p>

  <p>Why had Judith failed to accomplish the piece? Whilst engaged on the notes
  she had felt that the searching, beaming eyes of the smuggler were on her,
  fixed with fierce intensity. She could meet them, looking straight at him,
  without shrinking, and without confusion, but to be searched by them whilst
  off her guard, her attention engaged on her music, was what she could not
  endure.</p>

  <p>Coppinger made no remark on what he had heard, but his face gave token
  that the music had not swept across him without stirring and softening his
  hard nature.</p>

  <p>"How long is she to be here with you?" he asked, turning to Uncle
  Zachie.</p>

  <p>"Captain, I cannot tell. She and her brother had to leave the rectory.
  They could not remain in that house alone. Mrs. Trevisa asked me to lodge
  them here, and I consented. I knew their father."</p>

  <p>"She did not ask me. I would have taken them in."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she was diffident of doing that," said Uncle Zachie. "But really,
  on my word, it is no inconvenience to me. I have room in this house, and my
  maid, Jump, has not enough to do to attend on me."</p>

  <p>"When you are tired of them send them to me."</p>

  <p>"I am not likely to be tired of Judith, now that I have heard her
  play."</p>

  <p>"Judith&mdash;is that her name?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Judith."</p>

  <p>"Judith!" he repeated, and thrust his stick along the floor, meditatively.
  "Judith!" Then, after a pause, with his eyes on the ground, "Why did not your
  aunt speak to me! Why does she not love you?&mdash;she does not, I know. Why
  did she not go to see you when your father was alive! Why did you not come to
  the Glaze?"</p>

  <p>"My dear papa did not wish me to go to your house," said Judith, answering
  one of his many questions, the last, and perhaps the easiest to reply to.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he glanced up at her, then down on the floor again.</p>

  <p>"Papa was not very pleased with Aunt Dunes&mdash;it was no fault on either
  side, only a misunderstanding," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"Why did he not let you come to my house to salute your aunt?"</p>

  <p>Judith hesitated. He again looked up at her searchingly.</p>

  <p>"If you really must know the truth, Captain Coppinger, papa thought your
  house was hardly one to which to send two children&mdash;it was said to
  harbor such wild folk."</p>

  <p>"And he did not know how fiercely and successfully you could defend
  yourself against wild folk," said Coppinger, with a harsh laugh. "It is we
  wild men that must fear you, for you dash us about and bruise and break us
  when displeased with our ways. We are not so bad at the Glaze as we are
  painted, not by a half&mdash;here is my hand on it."</p>

  <p>Judith was still seated on the music-stool, her hands resting in her lap.
  Coppinger came toward her, walking stiffly, and extending his palm.</p>

  <p>She looked down in her lap. What did this fierce, strange man, mean?</p>

  <p>"Will you give me your hand?" he asked. "Is there peace between us?"</p>

  <p>She was doubtful what to say. He remained, awaiting her answer.</p>

  <p>"I really do not know what reply to make," she said, after awhile. "Of
  course, so far as I'm concerned, it is peace. I have myself no quarrel with
  you, and you are good enough to say that you forgive me."</p>

  <p>"Then why not peace?"</p>

  <p>Again she let him wait before answering. She was uneasy and unhappy. She
  wanted neither his goodwill nor his hostility.</p>

  <p>"In all that affects me, I bear you no ill-will," she said, in a low,
  tremulous voice; "but in that you were a grief to my dear, dear father,
  discouraging his heart, I cannot be forgetful, and so full of charity as to
  blot it out as though it had not been."</p>

  <p>"Then let it be a patched peace&mdash;a peace with evasions and
  reservations. Better that than none. Give me your hand."</p>

  <p>"On that understanding," said Judith, and laid her hand in his. His iron
  fingers closed round it, and he drew her up from the stool on which she sat,
  drew her forward near the window, and thrust her in front of him. Then he
  raised her hand, held it by the wrist, and looked at it.</p>

  <p>"It is very small, very weak," he said, musingly.</p>

  <p>Then there rushed over her mind the recollection of her last conversation
  with her father. He, too, had taken and looked at her hand, and had made the
  same remark.</p>

  <p>Coppinger lowered her hand and his, and, looking at her, said:</p>

  <p>"You are very wonderful to me."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;why so?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer, but let go his hold of her, and turned away to the
  door.</p>

  <p>Judith saw that he was leaving, and she hastened to bring him his stick,
  and she opened the door for him.</p>

  <p>"I thank you," he said, turned, pointed his stick at her, and added, "It
  is peace&mdash;though a patched one."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; C. C.</h2>

  <p class="first">Days ensued, not of rest to body, but of relaxation to mind.
  Judith's overstrained nerves had now given them a period of numbness, a sleep
  of sensibility with occasional turnings and wakenings, in which they
  recovered their strength. She and Jamie were settled into their rooms at Mr.
  Menaida's, and the hours were spent in going to and from the rectory removing
  their little treasures to the new home&mdash;if a temporary place of lodging
  could be called a home&mdash;and in arranging them there.</p>

  <p>There were a good many farewells to be taken, and Judith marvelled
  sometimes at the insensibility with which she said them&mdash;farewells to a
  thousand nooks and corners of the house and garden, the shrubbery, and the
  glebe farm, all endeared by happy recollections, now having their brightness
  dashed with rain.</p>

  <p>To Judith this was a first revelation of the mutability of things on
  earth. Hitherto, as a child, with a child's eyes and a child's confidence,
  she had regarded the rectory, the glebe, the contents of the house, the
  flowers in the garden, as belonging inalienably to her father and brother and
  herself. They belonged to them together. There was nothing that was her
  father's that did not belong to Jamie and to her, nothing of her brother's or
  her own that was not likewise the property of papa. There was no mine or
  thine in that little family of love&mdash;save only a few birthday presents
  given from one to the other, and these only special property by a playful
  concession. But now the dear father was gone, and every right seemed to
  dissolve. From the moment that he leaned back against the brick,
  lichen-stained wall, and sighed&mdash;and was dead, house and land had been
  snatched from them. And though the contents of the rectory, the books, and
  the furniture, and the china belonged to them, it was but for a little while;
  these things must be parted with also, turned into silver.</p>

  <p>Not because the money was needed, but because Judith had no settled home,
  and no prospect of one. Therefore she must not encumber herself with many
  belongings. For a little while she would lodge with Mr. Menaida, but she
  could not live there forever; she must remove elsewhere, and she must
  consider, in the first place, that there was not room in Uncle Zachie's
  cottage for accumulations of furniture, and that, in the next place, she
  would probably have to part with them on her next remove, even if she did
  retain them for a while.</p>

  <p>If these things were to be parted with, it would be advisable to part with
  them at once. But to this determination Judith could not bring herself at
  first. Though she had put aside, to be kept, things too sacred to her, too
  much part of her past life, to be allowed to go into the sale, after a few
  days she relinquished even these. Those six delightful old colored prints, in
  frames, of a fox-hunt&mdash;how Jamie had laughed at them, and followed the
  incidents in them, and never wearied of them&mdash;must they go&mdash;perhaps
  for a song? It must be so. That work-table of her mother's, of dark rosewood,
  with a crimson bag beneath it to contain wools and silks, one of the few
  remembrances she had of that mother whom she but dimly recalled&mdash;must
  that go?&mdash;what, and all those skeins in it of colored floss silk, and
  the piece of embroidery half finished? the work of her mother, broken off by
  death&mdash;that also? It must be so. And that rusty leather chair in which
  papa had sat, with one golden-headed child on each knee cuddled into his
  breast, with the flaps of his coat drawn over their heads, which listened to
  the tick-tick of his great watch, and to the tale of Little Snowflake, or
  Gracieuse and Percinet?&mdash;must that go also? It must be so.</p>

  <p>Every day showed to Judith some fresh link that had to be broken. She
  could not bear to think that the mother's work-table should be contended for
  at a vulgar auction, and struck down to a blousy farmer's wife; that her
  father's chair should go to some village inn to be occupied by sots. She
  would rather have seen them destroyed; but to destroy them would not be
  right.</p>

  <p>After a while she longed for the sale; she desired to have it over, that
  an entirely new page of life might be opened, and her thoughts might not be
  carried back to the past by everything she saw.</p>

  <p>Of Coppinger nothing further was seen. Nor did Aunt Dionysia appear at the
  rectory to superintend the assortment of the furniture, nor at Mr. Menaida's
  to inquire into the welfare of her nephew and niece. To Judith it was a
  relief not to have her aunt in the parsonage while she was there; that hard
  voice and unsympathetic manner would have kept her nerves on the quiver. It
  was best as it was, that she should have time, by herself, with no
  interference from any one, to select what was to be kept and put away what
  was to be sold; to put away gently, with her own trembling hand, and with
  eyes full of tears, the old black gown and the Oxford hood that papa had worn
  in church, and to burn his old sermons and bundles of letters, unread and
  uncommented on by Aunt Dunes.</p>

  <p>In these days Judith did not think much of Coppinger. Uncle Zachie
  informed her that he was worse, he was confined to his bed, he had done
  himself harm by coming over to Polzeath the day after his accident, and the
  doctor had ordered him not to stir from Pentyre Glaze for some time&mdash;not
  till his bones were set. Nothing was known of the occasion of Coppinger's
  injuries, so Uncle Zachie said; it was reported in the place that he had been
  thrown from his horse. Judith entreated the old man not to enlighten the
  ignorance of the public; she was convinced that naught would transpire
  through Jamie, who could not tell a story intelligibly; and Miss Dionysia
  Trevisa was not likely to publish what she knew.</p>

  <p>Judith had a pleasant little chamber at Mr. Menaida's; it was small, low,
  plastered against the roof, the rafters showing, and whitewashed like the
  walls and ceiling. The light entered from a dormer in the roof, a low window
  glazed with diamond quarries set in lead that clickered incessantly in the
  wind. It faced the south, and let the sun flow in. A scrap of carpet was on
  the floor, and white curtains to the window. In this chamber Judith ranged
  such of her goods as she had resolved on retaining, either as indispensable,
  or as being too dear to her to part with unnecessarily, and which, as being
  of small size, she might keep without difficulty.</p>

  <p>Her father's old travelling trunk, covered with hide with the hair on, and
  his initials in brass nails&mdash;a trunk he had taken with him to
  college&mdash;was there, thrust against the wall; it contained her clothes.
  Suspended above it was her little bookcase, with the shelves laden with "The
  Travels of Rolando," Dr. Aitkin's "Evenings at Home," Magnal's "Questions," a
  French Dictionary, "Paul and Virginia," and a few other works such as were
  the delight of children from ninety to a hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>Books for children were rare in those days, and such as were produced were
  read and re-read till they were woven into the very fibre of the mind, never
  more to be extricated and cast aside. Now it is otherwise. A child reads a
  story-book every week, and each new story-book effaces the impression
  produced by the book that went before. The result of much reading is the same
  as the result of no reading&mdash;the production of a blank.</p>

  <p>How Judith and Jamie had sat together perched up in a sycamore, in what
  they called their nest, and had revelled in the adventures of Rolando, she
  reading aloud, he listening a little, then lapsing into observation of the
  birds that flew and hopped about, or the insects that spun and crept, or
  dropped on silky lines, or fluttered humming about the nest, then returned to
  attention to the book again! Rolando would remain through life the friend and
  companion of Judith. She could not part with the four-volumed,
  red-leather-backed book.</p>

  <p>For the first day or two Jamie had accompanied his sister to the rectory,
  and had somewhat incommoded her by his restlessness and his mischief, but on
  the third day, and thenceforth, he no longer attended her. He had made fast
  friends with Uncle Zachie. He was amused with watching the process of
  bird-stuffing, and the old man made use of the boy by giving him tow to pick
  to pieces and wires to straighten.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida was pleased to have some one by him in his workshop to whom he
  could talk. It was unimportant to him whether the listener followed the
  thread of his conversation or not, so long as he was a listener. Mr. Menaida,
  in his solitude, had been wont to talk to himself, to grumble to himself at
  the impatience of his customers, to lament to himself the excess of work that
  pressed upon him and deprived him of time for relaxation. He was wont to
  criticise, to himself, his success or want of success in the setting-up of a
  bird. It was far more satisfactory to him to be able to address all these
  remarks to a second party.</p>

  <p>He was, moreover, surprised to find how keen and just had been Jamie's
  observation of birds, their ways, their attitudes. Judith was delighted to
  think that Jamie had discovered talent of some sort, and he had, so Uncle
  Zachie assured her, that imitative ability which is often found to exist
  alongside with low intellectual power, and this enabled him to assist Mr.
  Menaida in giving a natural posture to his birds.</p>

  <p>It flattered the boy to find that he was appreciated, that he was
  consulted, and asked to assist in a kind of work that exacted nothing of his
  mind.</p>

  <p>When Uncle Zachie was tired of his task, which was every ten minutes or
  quarter of an hour, and that was the extreme limit to which he could continue
  regular work, he lit his pipe, left his bench, and sat in his arm-chair. Then
  Jamie also left his tow-picking or wire-punching, and listened, or seemed to
  listen, to Mr. Menaida's talk. When the old man had finished his pipe, and,
  with a sigh, went back to his task, Jamie was tired of hearing him talk, and
  was glad to resume his work. Thus the two desultory creatures suited each
  other admirably, and became attached friends.</p>

  <p>"Jamie! what is the meaning of this?" asked Judith, with a start and a
  rush of blood to her heart.</p>

  <p>She had returned in the twilight from the parsonage. There was something
  in the look of her brother, something in his manner that was unusual.</p>

  <p>"Jamie! What have you been taking? Who gave it you?"</p>

  <p>She caught the boy by the arm. Distress and shame were in her face, in the
  tones of her voice.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida grunted.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, but it can't be helped&mdash;really it can't," said he,
  apologetically. "But Captain Coppinger has sent me down a present of a keg of
  cognac&mdash;real cognac, splendid, amber-like&mdash;and, you know, it was
  uncommonly kind. He never did it before. So there was no avoidance; we had to
  tap it and taste it, and give a sup to the fellow who brought us the keg, and
  drink the health of the Captain. One could not be churlish; and, naturally, I
  could not abstain from letting Jamie try the spirit. Perfectly
  pure&mdash;quite wholesome&mdash;first-rate quality. Upon my word, he had not
  more than a fly could dip his legs in and feel the bottom; but he is
  unaccustomed to anything stronger than cider, and this is stronger than I
  supposed."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Menaida, you promised me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bless me! There are contingencies, you know. I never for a moment thought
  that Captain Coppinger would show me such a favor, would have such courtesy.
  But, upon my honor, I think it is your doing, my dear! You shook hands and
  made peace with him, and he has sent this in token of the cessation of
  hostilities and the ratification of the agreement."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Menaida, I trusted you. I did believe, when you passed your word to
  me, that you would hold to it."</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;there, don't take it in that way. Jamie, you rascal, hop off to
  bed. He'll be right as a trivet to-morrow morning, I stake my reputation on
  that. There, there, I will help him up-stairs."</p>

  <p>Judith suffered Mr. Menaida to do as he proposed. When he had left the
  room with Jamie, who was reluctant to go, and struggled to remain, she seated
  herself on the sofa, and covering her face with her hands burst into tears.
  Whom could she trust? No one.</p>

  <p>Had she been alone in the world she would have been more confident of the
  future, been able to look forward with a good courage; but she had to carry
  Jamie with her, who must be defended from himself, and from the weak
  good-nature of those he was with.</p>

  <p>When Uncle Zachie came down-stairs he slunk into his workroom and was very
  quiet. No lamp or candle was lighted, and it was too dark for him to continue
  his employment on the birds. What was he doing? Nothing. He was ashamed of
  himself, and keeping out of Judith's way.</p>

  <p>But Judith would not let him escape so easily; she went to him, as he
  avoided her, and found him seated in a corner turning his pipe about. He had
  been afraid of striking a light, lest he should call her attention to his
  presence.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear, come in here into the workshop to me! This is an honor, an
  unexpected pleasure. Jamie and I have been drudging like slaves all day, and
  we're fagged&mdash;fagged to the ends of our fingers and toes."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Menaida, I am sorry to say it, but if such a thing happens again as
  has taken place this evening, Jamie and I must leave your house. I thank you
  with an overflowing heart for your goodness to us; but I must consider Jamie
  above everything else, and I must see that he be not exposed to
  temptation."</p>

  <p>"Where will you take him?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell; but I must shield him."</p>

  <p>"There, there, not a word! It shall never happen again. Now let by-gones
  be by-gones, and play me something of Beethoven, while I sit here and listen
  in the twilight."</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Menaida, I cannot. I have not the spirit to do it. I can think
  only of Jamie."</p>

  <p>"So you punish me!"</p>

  <p>"Take it so. I am sorry; but I cannot do otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Now, look here! Bless my soul! I had almost forgotten it. Here is a note
  for you, from the Captain, I believe." He went to the chimney-piece and took
  down a scrap of paper, folded and sealed.</p>

  <p>Judith looked at it and went to the window, broke the seal, and opened the
  paper. She read&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Why do you not come and see me? You do not care for what you have done.
  They call me cruel; but you are that.&mdash;C. C."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; EGO ET REGINA MEA.</h2>

  <p class="first">The strange, curt note from Cruel Coppinger served in a
  measure to divert the current of Judith's thoughts from her trouble about
  Jamie. It was, perhaps, as well, or she would have fretted over that
  throughout the night, not only because of Jamie, but because she felt that
  her father had left his solemn injunction on her to protect and guide her
  twin-brother, and she knew that whatsoever harm, physical or moral, came to
  him, argued a lack of attention to her duty. Her father had not been dead
  many days, and already Jamie had been led from the path she had undertaken to
  keep him in.</p>

  <p>But when she began to worry herself about Jamie, the bold characters, "C.
  C.," with which the letter was signed, rose before her, and glowed in the
  dark as characters of fire.</p>

  <p>She had gone to her bedroom, and had retired for the night, but could not
  sleep. The moon shone through the lattice into her chamber, and on the stool
  by the window lay the letter, where she had cast it. Her mind turned to
  it.</p>

  <p>Why did Coppinger call her cruel? Was she cruel? Not intentionally so. She
  had not wilfully injured him. He did not suppose that. He meant that she was
  heartless and indifferent in letting him suffer without making any inquiry
  concerning him.</p>

  <p>He had injured himself by coming to Polzeath to see her the day following
  his accident. Uncle Zachie had assured her of that.</p>

  <p>She went on in her busy mind to ask why he had come to see her? Surely
  there had been no need for him to do so! His motive&mdash;the only motive she
  could imagine&mdash;was a desire to relieve her from anxiety and distress of
  mind; a desire to show her that he bore no ill-will toward her for what she
  had done. That was generous and considerate of him. Had he not come she
  certainly would have been unhappy and in unrest, would have imagined all
  kinds of evil as likely to ensue through his hostility&mdash;for one thing,
  her aunt's dismissal from her post might have been expected.</p>

  <p>But Coppinger, though in pain, and at a risk to his health, had walked to
  where she was lodging to disabuse her of any such impression. She was
  grateful to him for so doing. She felt that such a man could not be utterly
  abandoned by God, entirely void of good qualities, as she had supposed,
  viewing him only through the representations of his character and the tales
  circulating relative to his conduct that had reached her.</p>

  <p>A child divides mankind into two classes&mdash;the good and the bad, and
  supposes that there is no debatable land between them, where light and shade
  are blended into neutral tint; certainly not that there are blots on the
  white leaf of the lives of the good, and luminous glimpses in the darkness of
  the histories of the bad. As they grow older they rectify their judgments,
  and such a rectification Judith had now to make.</p>

  <p>She was assisted in this by compassion for Coppinger, who was in
  suffering, and by self-reproach, because she was the occasion of this
  suffering.</p>

  <p>What were the exact words Captain Cruel had employed? She was not certain;
  she turned the letter over and over in her mind, and could not recall every
  expression, and she could not sleep till she was satisfied.</p>

  <p>Therefore she rose from bed, stole to the window, took up the letter,
  seated herself on the stool, and conned it in the moonlight. "Why do you not
  come and see me? You do not care for what you have done." That was not true;
  she was greatly troubled at what she had done. She was sick at heart when she
  thought of that scene in the lane, when the black mare was leaping and
  pounding with her hoofs, and Coppinger lay on the ground. One kick of the
  hoof on his head, and he would have been dead. His blood would have rested on
  her conscience, never to be wiped off. Horrible was the recollection now, in
  the stillness of the night. It was marvellous that life had not been beaten
  out of the prostrate man, that, dragged about by the arm, he had not been
  torn to pieces, that every bone had not been shattered, that his face had not
  been battered out of recognition. Judith felt the perspiration stand on her
  brow at the thought. God had been very good to her in sending His angel to
  save Coppinger from death and her from blood-guiltiness. She slid to her
  knees at the window, and held up her hands, the moonlight illuminating her
  white upturned face, as she gave thanks to Heaven that no greater evil had
  ensued from her inconsidered act with the button-basket than a couple of
  broken bones.</p>

  <p>Oh! it was very far indeed from true that she did not care for what she
  had done. Coppinger must have been blind indeed not to have seen how she felt
  her conduct. His letter concluded: "They call me cruel; but you are that." He
  meant that she was cruel in not coming to the Glaze to inquire after him. He
  had thought of her trouble of mind, and had gone to Polzeath to relieve her
  of anxiety, and she had shown no consideration for him&mdash;or not in like
  manner.</p>

  <p>She had been very busy at the rectory. Her mind had been concerned with
  her own affairs, that was her excuse. Cruel she was not. She took no pleasure
  in his pain. But she hesitated about going to see him. That was more than was
  to be expected of a young girl. She would go on the morrow to Coppinger's
  house, and ask to speak to her aunt; that she might do, and from Aunt
  Dionysia she would learn in what condition Captain Cruel was, and might send
  him her respects and wishes for his speedy recovery.</p>

  <p>As she still knelt in her window, looking up through the diamond panes
  into the clear, gray-blue sky, she heard a sound without, and, looking down,
  saw a convoy of horses pass, laden with bales and kegs, and followed or
  accompanied by men wearing slouched hats. So little noise did the beasts make
  in traversing the road, that Judith was convinced their hoofs must be muffled
  in felt. She had heard that this was done by the smugglers. It was said that
  all Coppinger's horses had their boots drawn on when engaged in conveying run
  goods from the place where stored to their destination.</p>

  <p>These were Coppinger's men, this his convoy, doubtless. Judith thrust the
  letter from her. He was a bad man, a very bad man; and if he had met with an
  accident, it was his due, a judgment on his sins. She rose from her knees,
  turned away, and went back to her bed.</p>

  <p>Next day, after a morning spent at the rectory, in the hopes that her aunt
  might arrive and obviate the need of her going in quest of her, Judith,
  disappointed in this hope, prepared to walk to Pentyre. Mrs. Dionysia had not
  acted with kindness toward her. Judith felt this, without allowing herself to
  give to the feeling articulate expression. She made what excuses she could
  for Aunt Dunes: she was hindered by duties that had crowded upon her, she had
  been forbidden going by Captain Cruel; but none of these excuses satisfied
  Judith.</p>

  <p>Judith must go herself to the Glaze, and she had reasons of her own for
  wishing to see her aunt, independent of the sense of obligation on her, more
  or less acknowledged, that she must obey the summons of C. C. There were
  matters connected with the rectory, with the furniture there, the cow, and
  the china, that Mrs. Trevisa must give her judgment upon. There were bills
  that had come in, which Mrs. Trevisa must pay, as Judith had been left
  without any money in her pocket.</p>

  <p>As the girl walked through the lanes she turned over in her mind the
  stories she had heard of the smuggler Captain, the wild tales of his wrecking
  ships, of his contests with the Preventive men, and the ghastly tragedy of
  Wyvill, who had been washed up headless on Doombar. In former days she had
  accepted all these stories as true, had not thought of questioning them; but
  now that she had looked Coppinger in the face, had spoken with him,
  experienced his consideration, she could not believe that they were to be
  accepted without question. That story of Wyvill&mdash;that Captain Cruel had
  hacked off his head on the gunwale with his axe&mdash;seemed to her now
  utterly incredible. But if true! She shuddered to think that her hand had
  been held in that stained with so hideous a crime.</p>

  <p>Thus musing, Judith arrived at Pentyre Glaze, and entering the porch,
  turned from the sea, knocked at the door.</p>

  <p>A loud voice bade her enter. She knew that the voice proceeded from
  Coppinger, and her heart fluttered with fear and uncertainty. She halted,
  with her hand on the door, inclined to retreat without entering; but again
  the voice summoned her to come in, and gathering up her courage she opened
  the door, and, still holding the latch, took a few steps forward into the
  hall or kitchen, into which it opened.</p>

  <p>A fire was smouldering in the great open fireplace, and beside it, in a
  carved oak arm-chair, sat Cruel Coppinger, with a small table at his side, on
  which were a bottle and glass, a canister of tobacco and a pipe. His arm was
  strapped across his breast as she had seen it a few days before. Entering
  from the brilliant light of day, Judith could not at first observe his face,
  but, as her eyes became accustomed to the twilight of the smoke-blackened and
  gloomy hall, she saw that he looked more worn and pale than he had seemed the
  day after the accident. Nor could she understand the expression on his
  countenance when he was aware who was his visitor.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Judith; "I am sorry to have intruded; but I
  wished to speak to my aunt."</p>

  <p>"Your aunt? Old mother Dunes? Come in. Let go your hold of the door and
  shut it. Your aunt started a quarter of an hour ago for the rectory."</p>

  <p>"And I came along the lane from Polzeath."</p>

  <p>"Then no wonder you did not meet her. She went by the church path, of
  course, and over the down."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to have missed her. Thank you, Captain Coppinger, for telling
  me."</p>

  <p>"Stay!" he roared, as he observed her draw back into the porch. "You are
  not going yet!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot stay for more than a moment in which to ask how you do, and
  whether you are somewhat better? I was sorry to hear you had been worse."</p>

  <p>"I have been worse, yes. Come in. You shall not go. I am mewed in as a
  prisoner, and have none to speak to, and no one to look at but old Dunes.
  Come in, and take that stool by the fire, and let me hear you speak, and let
  me rest my eyes a while on your golden hair&mdash;gold more golden than that
  of the Indies."</p>

  <p>"I hope you are better, sir," said Judith, ignoring the compliment.</p>

  <p>"I am better now I have seen you. I shall be worse if you do not come
  in."</p>

  <p>She refused to do this by a light shake of the head.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are afraid. We are wild and lawless men here, ogres that
  eat children! Come, child, I have something to show you."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for your kindness; but I must run to the parsonage; I really
  <i>must</i> see my aunt."</p>

  <p>"Then I will send her to Polzeath to you when she returns. She will keep;
  she's stale enough."</p>

  <p>"I would spare her the trouble."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! She shall do what I will. Now see&mdash;I am wearied to death with
  solitude and sickness. Come, amuse yourself, if you will, with insulting
  me&mdash;calling me what you like; I do not mind, so long as you remain."</p>

  <p>"I have no desire whatever, Captain Coppinger, to insult you and call you
  names."</p>

  <p>"You insult me by standing there holding the latch&mdash;standing on one
  foot, as if afraid to sully the soles by treading my tainted floor. Is it not
  an insult that you refuse to come in? Is it not so much as saying to me, 'You
  are false, cruel, not to be trusted; you are not worthy that I should be
  under the same roof with you, and breathe the same air?'"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Captain Coppinger, I do not mean that!"</p>

  <p>"Then let go the latch and come in. Stand, if you will not sit, opposite
  me. How can I see you there, in the doorway?"</p>

  <p>"There is not much to see when I am visible," said Judith, laughing.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! not much! Only a little creature who has more daring than any man
  in Cornwall&mdash;who will stand up to, and cast at her feet, Cruel
  Coppinger, at whose name men tremble."</p>

  <p>Judith let go her hold on the door, and moved timidly into the hall; but
  she let the door remain half open that the light and air flowed in.</p>

  <p>"And now," said Captain Coppinger, "here is a key on this table by me. Do
  you see a small door by the clock-case? Unlock that door with the key."</p>

  <p>"You want something from thence!"</p>

  <p>"I want you to unlock the door. There are beautiful and costly things
  within that you shall see."</p>

  <p>"Thank you; but I would rather look at them some other day, when my aunt
  is here, and I have more time."</p>

  <p>"Will you refuse me even the pleasure of letting you see what is
  there?"</p>

  <p>"If you particularly desire it, Captain Coppinger, I will peep
  in&mdash;but only peep."</p>

  <p>She took the key from his table, and crossed the hall to the door. The
  lock was large and clumsy, but she turned the key by putting both hands to
  it. Then, swinging open the door, she looked inside. The door opened into an
  apartment crowded with a collection of sundry articles of value: bales of
  silk from Italy, Genoa laces, Spanish silver-inlaid weapons, Chinese
  porcelain, bronzes from Japan, gold and silver ornaments, bracelets,
  brooches, watches, inlaid mother-of-pearl cabinets&mdash;an amazing congeries
  of valuables heaped together.</p>

  <p>"Well, now!" shouted Cruel Coppinger. "What say you to the gay things
  there? Choose&mdash;take what you will. I care not for them one rush. What do
  you most admire, most covet? Put out both hands and take&mdash;take all you
  would have; fill your lap, carry off all you can. It is yours."</p>

  <p>Judith drew hastily back and relocked the door.</p>

  <p>"What have you taken?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Nothing? Take what you will; I give it freely."</p>

  <p>"I cannot take anything, though I thank you, Captain Coppinger, for your
  kind and generous offer."</p>

  <p>"You will accept nothing?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That is like you. You do it to anger me. As you throw hard words at
  me&mdash;coward, wrecker, robber&mdash;and as you dash broken glass, buttons,
  buckles, in my face, so do you throw back my offers."</p>

  <p>"It is not through ingratitude&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I care not through what it is! You seek to anger, and not to please me.
  Why will you take nothing? There are beautiful things there to charm a
  woman."</p>

  <p>"I am not a woman; I am a little girl."</p>

  <p>"Why do you refuse me!"</p>

  <p>"For one thing, because I want none of the things there, beautiful and
  costly though they be."</p>

  <p>"And for the other thing&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"For the other thing&mdash;excuse my plain speaking&mdash;I do not think
  they have been honestly got."</p>

  <p>"By heavens!" shouted Coppinger. "There you attack and stab at me again. I
  like your plainness of speech. You do not spare me. I would not have you
  false and double like old Dunes."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Captain Coppinger! I give you thanks from the depths of my heart. It
  is kindly intended, and it is so good and noble of you, I feel that; for I
  have hurt you and reduced you to the state in which you now are, and yet you
  offer me the best things in your house&mdash;things of priceless value. I
  acknowledge your goodness; but just because I know I do not deserve this
  goodness I must decline what you offer."</p>

  <p>"Then come here and give me the key."</p>

  <p>She stepped lightly over the floor to him and handed him the great iron
  key to his store chamber. As she did so he caught her hand, bowed his dark
  head, and kissed her fingers.</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger!" She started back, trembling, and snatched her hand
  from him.</p>

  <p>"What! have I offended you again? Why not? A subject kisses the hand of
  his queen; and I am a subject, and you&mdash;you my queen."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; JESSAMINE.</h2>

  <p class="first">"How are you, old man?"</p>

  <p>"Middlin', thanky'; and how be you, gov'nor?"</p>

  <p>"Middlin' also; and your missus?"</p>

  <p>"Only sadly. I fear she's goin' slow but sure the way of all flesh."</p>

  <p>"Bless us! 'Tis a trouble and expense them sort o' things. Now to work,
  shall we? What do you figure up?"</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, I'm not here on reg'lar business. Huntin' on my own score
  to-day."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ay! Nice port this."</p>

  <p>"Best the old fellow had in his cellar. I told the executrix I should like
  the taste of it, and advise thereon."</p>

  <p>The valuers for dilapidations, vulgarly termed dilapidators, were met in
  the dining-room of the deserted parsonage. Mr. Scantlebray was on one side,
  Mr. Cargreen on the other. Mr. Scantlebray was on that of the "orphings," as
  he termed his clients, and Mr. Cargreen on that of the Rev. Mr. Mules, the
  recently nominated rector to S. Enodoc.</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray was a tall, lean man, with light gray eyes, a red face,
  and legs and arms that he shook every now and then as though they were
  encumbrances to his trunk and he was going to shake them off, as a poodle
  issuing from a bath shakes the water out of his locks. Mr. Cargreen was a
  bullet-headed man, with a white neckcloth, gray whiskers, a solemn face, and
  a sort of perpetual "Let-us-pray" expression on his lips and in his
  eyes&mdash;a composing of his interior faculties and abstraction from worldly
  concerns.</p>

  <p>"I am here," said Mr. Scantlebray, "as adviser and friend&mdash;you
  understand, old man&mdash;of the orphings and their haunt."</p>

  <p>"And I," said Mr. Cargreen, "am ditto to the incoming rector."</p>

  <p>"And what do you get out of this visit!" asked Mr. Scantlebray, who was a
  frank man.</p>

  <p>"Only three guineas as a fee," said Mr. Cargreen. "And you?"</p>

  <p>"Ditto, old man&mdash;three guineas. You understand, I am not here as
  valuer to-day."</p>

  <p>"Nor I&mdash;only as adviser."</p>

  <p>"Exactly! Taste this port. 'Taint bad&mdash;out of the cellar of the old
  chap. Told auntie I must have it, to taste and give opinion on."</p>

  <p>"And what are you going to do to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to have one or two little things pulled down, and other little
  things put to rights."</p>

  <p>"Humph! I'm here to see nothing is pulled down."</p>

  <p>"We won't quarrel. There's the conservatory, and the linney in Willa
  Park."</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Cargreen, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Now look here, old man," said Mr. Scantlebray. "You let me tear the
  linney down, and I'll let the conservatory stand."</p>

  <p>"The conservatory&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know; the casement of the best bedroom went through the roof of it.
  I'll mend the roof and repaint it. You can try the timber, and find it
  rotten, and lay on dilapidations enough to cover a new conservatory. Pass the
  linney; I want to make pickings out of that."</p>

  <p>It may perhaps be well to let the reader understand the exact situation of
  the two men engaged in sipping port. Directly it was known that a rector had
  been nominated to S. Enodoc, Mr. Cargreen, a Bodmin valuer, agent, and
  auctioneer, had written to the happy nominee, Mr. Mules, of Birmingham,
  inclosing his card in the letter, to state that he was a member of an
  old-established firm, enjoying the confidence, not to say the esteem of the
  principal county families in the north of Cornwall, that he was a sincere
  Churchman, that deploring, as a true son of the Church, the prevalence of
  Dissent, he felt it his duty to call the attention of the reverend gentleman
  to certain facts that concerned him, but especially the CHURCH, and facts
  that he himself, as a devoted son of the Church, on conviction, after mature
  study of its tenets, felt called upon, in the interest of that Church he so
  had at heart, to notice. He had heard, said Mr. Cargreen, that the outgoing
  parties from S. Enodoc were removing, or causing to be removed, or were
  proposing to remove, certain fixtures in the parsonage, and certain
  out-buildings, barns, tenements, sheds, and linneys on the glebe and
  parsonage premises, to the detriment of its value, inasmuch as that such
  removal would be prejudicial to the letting of the land, and render it
  impossible for the incoming rector to farm it himself without re-erecting the
  very buildings now in course of destruction, or which were purposed to be
  destroyed: to wit, certain out-buildings, barns, cattle-sheds, and linneys,
  together with other tenements that need not be specified. Mr. Cargreen added
  that, roughly speaking, the dilapidations of these buildings, if allowed to
  stand, might be assessed at 300; but that, if pulled down, it would cost the
  new rector about 700 to re-erect them, and their re-erection would be an
  imperative necessity. Mr. Cargreen had himself, personally, no interest in
  the matter; but, as a true son of the Church, etc., etc.</p>

  <p>By return of post Mr. Cargreen received an urgent request from the Rev.
  Mr. Mules to act as his agent, and to act with precipitation in the
  protection of his interests.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Mr. Scantlebray had not been neglectful of other people's
  interest. He had written to Miss Dionysia Trevisa to inform her that, though
  he did not enjoy a present acquaintance, it was the solace and joy of his
  heart to remember that some years ago, before that infelicitous marriage of
  Mr. Trevisa, which had led to Miss Dionysia's leaving the rectory, it had
  been his happiness to meet her at the house of a mutual acquaintance, Mrs.
  Scaddon, where he had respectfully, and, at this distance of time, he
  ventured to add, humbly and hopelessly admired her; that, as he was riding
  past the rectory he had chanced to observe the condition of dilapidation
  certain tenements, pig-sties, cattle-sheds, and other out-buildings were in,
  and that, though it in no way concerned him, yet, for auld lang syne's sake,
  and a desire to assist one whom he had always venerated, and, at this
  distance of time might add, had admired, he ventured to offer a suggestion:
  to wit, That a number of unnecessary out-buildings should be torn down and
  utterly effaced before a new rector was nominated, and had appointed a
  valuer; also that certain obvious repairs should be undertaken and done at
  once, so as to give to the parsonage the appearance of being in excellent
  order, and cut away all excuse for piling up dilapidations. Mr. Scantlebray
  ventured humbly to state that he had had a good deal of experience with those
  gentlemen who acted as valuers for dilapidations, and with pain he was
  obliged to add that a more unscrupulous set of men it had never been his bad
  fortune to come into contact with. He ventured to assert that, were he to
  tell all he knew, or only half of what he knew, as to their proceedings in
  valuing for dilapidations, he would make both of Miss Trevisa's ears
  tingle.</p>

  <p>At once Miss Dionysia entreated Mr. Scantlebray to superintend and carry
  out with expedition such repairs and such demolitions as he deemed expedient,
  so as to forestall the other party.</p>

  <p>"Chicken!" said Mr. Cargreen. "That's what I've brought for my lunch."</p>

  <p>"And 'am is what I've got," said Mr. Scantlebray. "They'll go lovely
  together." Then, in a loud tone&mdash;"Come in!"</p>

  <p>The door opened, and a carpenter entered with a piece of deal board in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"You won't mind looking out of the winder, Mr. Cargreen?" said Mr.
  Scantlebray. "Some business that's partick'ler my own. You'll find the
  jessamine&mdash;the white jessamine&mdash;smells beautiful."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cargreen rose, and went to the dining-room window that was embowered
  in white jessamine, then in full flower and fragrance.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Davy?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I ain't got no dry old board for the floor where it be rotten,
  nor for the panelling of the doors where broken through."</p>

  <p>"No board at all?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;all is green. Only cut last winter."</p>

  <p>"Won't it take paint?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, not well. I've dried this piece by the kitchen fire, and I
  find it'll take the paint for a time."</p>

  <p>"Run, dry all the panels at the kitchen fire, and then paint 'em."</p>

  <p>"Thanky', sir; but, how about the boarding of the floor? The boards'll
  warp and start."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Davy, that gentleman who's at the winder a-smelling to the
  jessamine is the surveyor and valuer to t'other party. I fancy you'd best go
  round outside and have a word with him and coax him to pass the boards."</p>

  <p>"Come in!" in a loud voice. Then there entered a man in a cloth coat, with
  very bushy whiskers. "How d'y' do, Spargo? What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Scantlebray, I understand the linney and cow-shed is to be
  pulled down."</p>

  <p>"So it is, Spargo."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir!" Mr. Spargo drew his sleeve across his mouth. "There's a lot
  of very fine oak timber in it&mdash;beams, and such like&mdash;that I don't
  mind buying. As a timber merchant I could find a use for it."</p>

  <p>"Say ten pound."</p>

  <p>"Ten pun'! That's a long figure!"</p>

  <p>"Not a pound too much; but come&mdash;we'll say eight."</p>

  <p>"I reckon I'd thought five."</p>

  <p>"Five! pshaw! It's dirt cheap to <i>you</i> at eight."</p>

  <p>"Why to me, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Why, because the new rector will want to rebuild both cattle-shed and
  linney, and he'll have to go to you for timber."</p>

  <p>"But suppose he don't, and cuts down some on the glebe?"</p>

  <p>"No, Spargo&mdash;not a bit. There at the winder, smelling to the
  jessamine, is the new rector's adviser and agent. Go round by the front door
  into the garding, and say a word to him&mdash;you understand, and&mdash;" Mr.
  Scantlebray tapped his palm. "Do now go round and have a sniff of the
  jessamine, Mr. Spargo, and I don't fancy Mr. Cargreen will advise the rector
  to use home-grown timber. He'll tell him it sleeps away, gets the rot, comes
  more expensive in the long run."</p>

  <p>The valuer took a wing of chicken and a little ham, and then shouted, with
  his mouth full&mdash;"Come in!"</p>

  <p>The door opened and admitted a farmer.</p>

  <p>"How do, Mr. Joshua? middlin'?"</p>

  <p>"Middlin', sir, thanky'."</p>

  <p>"And what have you come about, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Mr. Scantlebray, sir! I fancy you ha'n't offered me quite
  enough for carting away of all the rummage from them buildings as is coming
  down. 'Tis a terrible lot of stone, and I'm to take 'em so far away."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it's such a lot of work for the bosses, and the pay so
  poor."</p>

  <p>"Not a morsel, Joshua&mdash;not a morsel."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I can't do it at the price."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Joshua! Joshua! I thought you'd a better eye to the future. Don't you
  see that the new rector will have to build up all these out-buildings again,
  and where else is he to get stone except out of your quarry, or some of the
  old stone you have carted away, which you will have the labor of carting
  back?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I don't know."</p>

  <p>"But I do, Joshua."</p>

  <p>"The new rector might go elsewhere for stone."</p>

  <p>"Not he. Look there, at the winder is Mr. Cargreen, and he's in with the
  new parson, like a brother&mdash;knows his very soul. The new parson comes
  from Birmingham. What can he tell about building-stone here? Mr. Cargreen
  will tell him yours is the only stuff that ain't powder."</p>

  <p>"But, sir, he may not rebuild."</p>

  <p>"He must. Mr. Cargreen will tell him that he can't let the glebe without
  buildings; and he can't build without your quarry stone: and if he has your
  quarry stone&mdash;why, you will be given the carting also. Are you
  satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;if Mr. Cargreen would be sure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's there at the winder, a-smelling to the jessamine. You go round and
  have a talk to him, and make him understand&mdash;you know. He's a little
  hard o' hearing; but the drum o' his ear is here," said Scantlebray, tapping
  his palm.</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray was now left to himself to discuss the chicken
  wing&mdash;the liver wing he had taken&mdash;and sip the port; a conversation
  was going on in an undertone at the window; but that concerned Mr. Cargreen
  and not himself, so he paid no attention to it.</p>

  <p>After a while, however, when this hum ceased, he turned his head, and
  called out:</p>

  <p>"Old man! how about your lunch?"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming."</p>

  <p>"And you found the jessamine very sweet?"</p>

  <p>"Beautiful! beautiful!"</p>

  <p>"Taste this port. It is not what it should be: some the old fellow laid in
  when he could afford it&mdash;before he married. It is passed, and going
  back; should have been drunk five years ago."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cargreen came to the table, and seated himself. Then Mr. Scantlebray
  flapped his arms, shook out his legs, and settled himself to the enjoyment of
  the lunch, in the society of Mr. Cargreen.</p>

  <p>"The merry-thought! Pull with me, old man?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray and Mr. Cargreen were engaged on the merry-thought, each
  endeavoring to steal an advantage on the other, by working the fingers up the
  bone unduly, when the window was darkened.</p>

  <p>Without desisting from pulling at the merry-thought each turned his head,
  and Scantlebray at once let go his end of the bone. At the window stood
  Captain Coppinger looking in at the couple, with his elbow resting on the
  window-sill.</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray flattered himself that he was on good terms with all the
  world, and he at once with hilarity saluted the Captain by raising the
  fingers greased by the bone to his brow.</p>

  <p>"Didn't reckon on seeing you here, Cap'n."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not."</p>

  <p>"Come and pick a bone with us?"</p>

  <p>Coppinger laughed a short snort through his nostrils.</p>

  <p>"I have a bone to pick with you already."</p>

  <p>"Never! no, never!"</p>

  <p>"You have forced yourself on Miss Trevisa to act as her agent and valuer
  in the matter of dilapidations."</p>

  <p>"Not forced, Captain. She asked me to give her friendly counsel. We are
  old acquaintances."</p>

  <p>"I will not waste words. Give me her letter. She no longer requires your
  advice and counsel. I am going to act for her."</p>

  <p>"You, Cap'n! Lor' bless me! You don't mean to say so!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I will protect her against being pillaged. She is my
  housekeeper."</p>

  <p>"But see! she is only executrix. She gets nothing out of the
  property."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but her niece and nephew do. Take it that I act for them. Give
  me up her letter."</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray hesitated.</p>

  <p>"But, Cap'n, I've been to vast expense. I've entered into
  agreements&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With whom?"</p>

  <p>"With carpenter and mason about the repairs."</p>

  <p>"Give me the agreements."</p>

  <p>"Not agreements exactly. They sent me in their estimates, and I accepted
  them, and set them to work."</p>

  <p>"Give me the estimates."</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray flapped all his limbs, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose I carry these sort of things about with me?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt whatever they are in your pocket." Scantlebray
  fidgeted.</p>

  <p>"Cap'n, try this port&mdash;a little going back, but not to be sneezed
  at."</p>

  <p>Coppinger leaned forward through the window.</p>

  <p>"Who is that man with you?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Cargreen."</p>

  <p>"What is he here for?"</p>

  <p>"I am agent for the Reverend Mules, the newly appointed rector," said Mr.
  Cargreen, with some dignity.</p>

  <p>"Then I request you both to step to the window to me."</p>

  <p>The two men looked at each other. Scantlebray jumped up, and Cargreen
  followed. They stood in the window-bay at a respectful distance from Cruel
  Coppinger.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know who I am?" said the latter, fixing his eyes on
  Cargreen.</p>

  <p>"I believe I can form a guess."</p>

  <p>"And your duty to your client is to make out as bad a case as you can
  against the two children. They have had just one thousand pounds left them.
  You are going to get as much of that away from them as you are
  permitted."</p>

  <p>"My good sir&mdash;allow me to explain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no need," said Coppinger. "Suffice it that you are one side.
  I&mdash;Cruel Coppinger&mdash;on the other. Do you understand what that
  means?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cargreen became alarmed, his face became very blank.</p>

  <p>"I am not a man to waste words. I am not a man that many in Cornwall would
  care to have as an adversary. Do you ever travel at night, Mr. Cargreen?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Through the lanes and along the lonely roads?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, sir&mdash;now and then."</p>

  <p>"So do I," said Coppinger. He drew a pistol from his pocket, and played
  with it. The two "dilapidators" shrank back. "So do I," said Coppinger; "but
  I never go unarmed. I would advise you to do the same&mdash;if you are my
  adversary."</p>

  <p>"I hope, Captain, that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If those children suffer through you more than what I
  allow"&mdash;Coppinger drew up his one shoulder that he could move&mdash;"I
  should advise you to consider what Mrs. Cargreen will have to live on when a
  widow." Then he turned to Scantlebray, who was sneaking behind the
  window-curtain.</p>

  <p>"Miss Trevisa's letter, authorizing you to act for her?"</p>

  <p>Scantlebray, with shaking hand, groped for his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"And the two agreements or estimates you signed."</p>

  <p>Scantlebray gave him the letter.</p>

  <p>"The agreements also."</p>

  <p>Nervously the surveyor groped again, and reluctantly produced them.
  Captain Coppinger opened them with his available hand.</p>

  <p>"What is this? Five pounds in pencil added to each, and then summed up in
  the total? What is the meaning of that, pray?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray again endeavored to disappear behind the curtain.</p>

  <p>"Come forward!" shouted Captain Cruel, striking the window-sill with the
  pistol.</p>

  <p>Scantlebray jumped out of his retreat at once.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of these two five pounds?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir&mdash;Captain&mdash;it is usual; every one does it. It is
  my&mdash;what d'y' call it!&mdash;consideration for accepting the
  estimates."</p>

  <p>"And added to each, and then charged to the orphans, who pay you to act in
  their interest&mdash;so they pay wittingly, directly, and unwittingly,
  indirectly. Well for you and for Mrs. Scantlebray that I release you of your
  obligation to act for Mother Dunes&mdash;I mean Miss Trevisa."</p>

  <p>"Sir," said Cargreen, "under the circumstances, under intimidation, I
  decline to sully my fingers with the business. I shall withdraw."</p>

  <p>"No, you shall not," said Cruel Coppinger, resolutely. "You shall act, and
  act as I approve; and in the end it shall not be to your disadvantage."</p>

  <p>Then, without a word of farewell, he stood up, slipped the pistol back
  into his pocket, and strode away.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cargreen had become white, or rather, the color of dough. After a
  moment he recovered himself somewhat, and, turning to Scantlebray, with a
  sarcastic air, said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I hope <i>you</i> enjoy the jessamine. They don't smell particularly
  sweet to me."</p>

  <p>"Orful!" groaned Scantlebray. He shook himself&mdash;almost shaking off
  all his limbs in the convulsion&mdash;"Old man&mdash;them jessamines is
  orful!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE CAVE.</h2>

  <p class="first">Some weeks slipped by without bringing to Judith any
  accession of anxiety. She did not go again to Pentyre Glaze, but her aunt
  came once or twice in the week to Polzeath to see her. Moreover, Miss
  Dionysia's manner toward her was somewhat less contrary and vexatious, and
  she seemed to put on a conciliatory manner, as far as was possible for one so
  angular and crabbed. Gracious she could not be; nature had made it as
  impossible for her to be gracious in manner as to be lovely in face and
  graceful in movement.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Judith observed that her aunt looked at her with an expression
  of perplexity, as though seeking in her to find an answer to a riddle that
  vexed her brain. And so it was. Aunt Dunes could not understand the conduct
  of Coppinger toward Judith and her brother. Nor could she understand how a
  child like her niece could have faced and defied a man of whom she herself
  stood in abject fear. Judith had behaved to the smuggler in a way that no man
  in the whole countryside would have ventured to behave. She had thrown him at
  her feet, half killed him, and yet Cruel Coppinger did not resent what had
  been done; on the contrary, he went out of his way to interfere in the
  interest of the orphans. He was not the man to concern himself in other
  people's affairs; why should he take trouble on behalf of Judith and her
  brother? That he did it out of consideration for herself, Miss Trevisa had
  not the assurance to believe.</p>

  <p>Aunt Dunes put a few searching questions to Judith, but drew from her
  nothing that explained the mystery. The girl frankly told her of her visit to
  the Glaze and interview with the crippled smuggler, of his offer to her of
  some of his spoil, and of her refusal to receive a present from him. Miss
  Trevisa approved of her niece's conduct in this respect. It would not have
  befitted her to accept anything. Judith, however, did not communicate to her
  aunt the closing scene in that interview. She did not tell her that Coppinger
  had kissed her hand, nor his excuse for having done so, that he was offering
  homage to a queen.</p>

  <p>For one thing, Judith did not attach any importance to this incident. She
  had always heard that Coppinger was a wild and insolent man, wild and
  insolent in his dealings with his fellow-men, therefore doubtless still more
  so in his treatment of defenceless women. He had behaved to her in the rude
  manner in which he would behave to any peasant girl or sailor's daughter who
  caught his fancy, and she resented his act as an indignity, and his excuse
  for it as a prevarication. And, precisely, because he had offended her
  maidenly dignity, she blushed to mention it, even to her aunt, resolving in
  her own mind not to subject herself to the like again.</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa, on several occasions, invited Judith to come and see her at
  Pentyre Glaze, but the girl always declined the invitation.</p>

  <p>Judith's estimate of Cruel Coppinger was modified. He could not be the
  utter reprobate she had always held him to be. She fully acknowledged that
  there was an element of good in the man, otherwise he would not have forgiven
  the injury done him, nor would he have interfered to protect her and Jamie
  from the fraud and extortion of the "dilapidators." She trusted that the
  stories she had heard of Coppinger's wild and savage acts were false, or
  overcolored. Her dear father had been misled by reports, as she had been, and
  it was possible that Coppinger had not really been the impediment in her
  father's way that the late rector had supposed.</p>

  <p>Jamie was happy. He was even, in a fashion, making himself useful. He
  helped Mr. Menaida in his bird-stuffing on rainy days; he did more, he ran
  about the cliffs, learned the haunts of the wild-fowl, ascertained where they
  nested, made friends with Preventive men, and some of those fellows living on
  shore, without any very fixed business, who rambled over the country with
  their guns, and from these he was able to obtain birds that he believed Mr.
  Menaida wanted. Judith was glad that the boy should be content, and enjoy the
  fresh air and some freedom. She would have been less pleased had she seen the
  companions Jamie made. But the men had rough good-humor, and were willing to
  oblige the half-witted boy, and they encouraged him to go with them shooting,
  or to sit with them in their huts.</p>

  <p>Jamie manifested so strong a distaste for books, and lesson time being one
  of resistance, pouting, tears, and failures, that Judith thought it not amiss
  to put off the resumption of these irksome tasks for a little while, and to
  let the boy have his run of holidays. She fancied that the loss of his father
  and of his old home preyed on him more than was actually the case; and
  believed that by giving him freedom till the first pangs were over, he might
  not suffer in the way that she had done.</p>

  <p>For a fortnight or three weeks Judith's time had been so fully engaged at
  the parsonage, that she could not have devoted much of it to Jamie, even had
  she thought it desirable to keep him to his lessons; nor could she be with
  him much. She did not press him to accompany her to the rectory, there to
  spend the time that she was engaged sorting her father's letters and
  memoranda, his account-books and collection of extracts made from volumes he
  had borrowed, as not only would it be tedious to him, but he would distract
  her mind. She must see that he was amused, and must also provide that he was
  not at mischief. She did take him with her on one or two occasions, and found
  that he had occupied himself in disarranging much that she had put together
  for the sale.</p>

  <p>But she would not allow him wholly to get out of the way of looking to her
  as his companion, and she abandoned an afternoon to him now and then, as her
  work became less arduous, to walk with him on the cliffs or in the lanes, to
  listen to his childish prattle, and throw herself into his new pursuits. The
  link between them must not be allowed to become relaxed, and, so far as in
  her lay, she did her utmost to maintain it in its former security. But, with
  his father's death, and his removal to Mr. Menaida's cottage, a new world had
  opened to Jamie; he was brought into association with men and boys whom he
  had hardly known by sight previously, and without any wish to disengage
  himself from his sister's authority, he was led to look to others as
  comrades, and to listen to and follow their promptings.</p>

  <p>"Come, Jamie," said Judith, one day. "Now I really have some hours free,
  and I will go a stroll with you on the downs."</p>

  <p>The boy jumped with pleasure, and caught her hand.</p>

  <p>"I may take Tib with me?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, certainly, dear."</p>

  <p>Tib was a puppy that had been given to Jamie by one of his new
  acquaintances.</p>

  <p>The day was fresh. Clouds driving before the wind, now obscuring the sun
  and threatening rain, then clearing and allowing the sun to turn the sea
  green and gild the land. Owing to the breeze the sea was ruffled and strewn
  with breakers shaking their white foam.</p>

  <p>"I am going to show you something I have found, Ju," said the boy. "You
  will follow, will you not?"</p>

  <p>"Lead the way. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Come and see. I found it by myself. I shan't tell any one but you."</p>

  <p>He conducted his sister down the cliffs to the beach of a cove. Judith
  halted a moment to look along the coast with its mighty, sombre cliffs, and
  the sea glancing with sun or dulled by shadow to Tintagel Head standing up at
  the extreme point to the northeast, with the white surf lashing and heaving
  around it. Then she drew her skirts together, and descended by the narrow
  path along which, with the lightness and confidence of a kid, Jamie was
  skipping.</p>

  <p>"Jamie!" she said. "Have you seen?&mdash;there is a ship standing in the
  offing."</p>

  <p>"Yes; she has been there all the morning."</p>

  <p>Then she went further.</p>

  <p>The cove was small, with precipitous cliffs rising from the sand to the
  height of two to three hundred feet. The seagulls screamed and flashed to and
  fro, and the waves foamed and threw up their waters lashed into froth as
  white and light as the feathers on the gulls. In the concave bay the roar of
  the plunging tide reverberated from every side. Neither the voice of Jamie,
  when he shouted to his sister from some feet below, nor the barking of his
  little dog that ran with him, could be distinguished by her.</p>

  <p>The descent was rapid and rugged, yet not so precipitous but that it could
  be gone over by asses or mules. Evidence that these creatures had passed that
  way remained in the impression of their hoofs in the soil, wherever a soft
  stratum intervened between the harder shelves of the rock, and had crumbled
  on the path into clay.</p>

  <p>Judith observed that several paths&mdash;not all
  mule-paths&mdash;converged lower down at intervals in the way by which she
  descended, so that it would be possible, apparently, to reach the sand from
  various points in the down, as well as by the main track by which she was
  stepping to the beach.</p>

  <p>"Jamie!" called Judith, as she stood on the last shoulder of rock before
  reaching the beach over a wave-washed and smoothed surface. "Jamie! I can see
  that same ship from here."</p>

  <p>But her brother could not hear her. He was throwing stones for the dog to
  run after, and meet a wave as it rushed in.</p>

  <p>The tide was going out: it had marked its highest elevation by a bow of
  foam and strips of dark seaweed and broken shells. Judith stepped along this
  line, and picked out the largest ribbon of weed she could find. She would
  hang it in her bedroom to tell her the weather. The piece that had been wont
  to act as barometer was old, and, besides, it had been lost in the recent
  shift and confusion.</p>

  <p>Jamie came up to her.</p>

  <p>"Now, Ju, mind and watch me, or you will lose me altogether."</p>

  <p>Then he ran forward, with Tib dancing and yelping round him. Presently he
  scrambled up a shelf of rock inclined from the sea, and up after him,
  yelping, scrambled Tib. In a moment both disappeared over the crest.</p>

  <p>Judith went up to the ridge and called to her brother.</p>

  <p>"I cannot climb this, Jamie."</p>

  <p>But in another moment, a hundred yards to her right, round the extremity
  of the reef, came Tib and his master, the boy dancing and laughing, the dog
  ducking his head, shaking his ears, and, all but laughing also, evidently
  enjoying the fun as much as Jamie.</p>

  <p>"This way, Ju!" shouted the boy, and signed to his sister. She could not
  hear his voice, but obeyed his gestures. The reef ran athwart the top of the
  bay, like the dorsal, jagged ridge of a crocodile half buried in the
  sand.</p>

  <p>Judith drew her skirts higher and closer, as the sand was wet, and there
  were pools by the rock. Then, holding her ribbon of seaweed by the harsh,
  knotted root, torn up along with the leaf, and trailing it behind her, she
  followed her brother, reached the end of the rock, turned and went in the
  traces of Jamie and Tib in the sand parallel to her former course.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, and quite unexpectedly, on the right hand there opened before
  her, in the face of the cliff, a cave, the entrance to which was completely
  masked by the ridge she had turned. Into this cave went Jamie with his
  dog.</p>

  <p>"I am not obliged to follow you there!" protested Judith; but he made such
  vehement signs to her to follow him that she good-humoredly obeyed.</p>

  <p>The cave ran in a long way, at first at no great incline, then it became
  low overhead, and immediately after the floor inclined rapidly upward, and
  the vault took a like direction. Moreover, light appeared in front. Here, to
  Judith's surprise, she saw a large boat, painted gray, furnished with oars
  and boat-hook. She was attached by a chain to a staple in the rock. Judith
  examined her with a little uneasiness. No name was on her.</p>

  <p>The sides of the cave at this point formed shelves, not altogether
  natural, and that these were made use of was evident, because on them lay
  staves of broken casks, a four-flanged boat-anchor, and some oars. Out of the
  main trunk cave branched another that was quite dark, and smaller; in this,
  Judith, whose eyes were becoming accustomed to the twilight, thought she saw
  the bows of a smaller boat, also painted gray.</p>

  <p>"Jamie!" said Judith, now in serious alarm; "we ought not to be here. It
  is not safe. Do&mdash;do come away at once."</p>

  <p>"Why, what is there to harm us?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, do come away." She turned to retrace her steps, but Jamie
  stopped her.</p>

  <p>"Not that way, Ju! I have another by which to get out. Follow me
  still."</p>

  <p>He led the way up the steep rubble slope, and the light fell fuller from
  above. The cave was one of those into which when the sea rolls and chokes the
  entrance, the compressed air is driven out by a second orifice.</p>

  <p>They reached a sort of well or shaft, at the bottom of which they stood,
  but it did not open vertically but bent over somewhat, so that from below the
  sky could not be seen, though the light entered. A narrow path was traced in
  the side, and up this Jamie and the dog scrambled, followed by Judith, who
  was most anxious to escape from a place which she had no doubt was one of the
  shelter caves of the smugglers&mdash;perhaps of Cruel Coppinger, whose house
  was not a mile distant.</p>

  <p>The ascent was steep, the path slippery in places, and therefore
  dangerous. Jamie made nothing of it, nor did the little dog, but Judith
  picked her way with care; she had a good steady head, and did not feel giddy,
  but she was not sure that her feet might not slide in the clay where wet with
  water that dripped from the sides. As she neared the entrance she saw that
  hartstongue and maidenhair fern had rooted themselves in the sheltered nooks
  of this tunnel.</p>

  <p>After a climb of a hundred feet she came out on a ledge in the face of the
  cliff above the bay, to see, with a gasp of dismay, her brother in the hand
  of Cruel Coppinger, the boy paralyzed with fear so that he could neither stir
  nor cry out.</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed the Captain, "you here?" as he saw Judith stand before
  him.</p>

  <p>The puppy was barking and snapping at his boots. Coppinger let go Jamie,
  stooped and caught the dog by the neck. "Look at me," said the smuggler
  sternly, addressing the frightened boy. Then he swung the dog above his head
  and dashed it down the cliffs; it caught, then rolled, and fell out of
  sight&mdash;certainly with the life beaten out of it.</p>

  <p>"This will be done to you," said he; "I do not say that I would do it.
  She"&mdash;he waved his hand toward Judith&mdash;"stands between us. But if
  any of the fifteen to twenty men who know this place and come here should
  chance to meet you as I have met you, he would treat you without compunction
  as I have treated that dog. And if he were to catch you below&mdash;you have
  heard of Wyvill, the Preventive man?&mdash;you would fare as did he. Thank
  your sister that you are alive now. Go on&mdash;that way&mdash;up the cliff."
  He pointed with a telescope he held.</p>

  <p>Jamie fled up the steep path like the wind.</p>

  <p>"Judith," said Coppinger, "will you stand surety that he does not tell
  tales?"</p>

  <p>"I do not believe he will say anything."</p>

  <p>"I do not ask you to be silent. I know you will not speak. But if you
  mistrust his power to hold his tongue, send him away&mdash;send him out of
  the country&mdash;as you love him."</p>

  <p>"He shall never come here again," said Judith, earnestly.</p>

  <p>"That is well; he owes his life to you."</p>

  <p>Judith noticed that Cruel Coppinger's left arm was no more in a sling, nor
  in bands.</p>

  <p>He saw that she observed this, and smiled grimly. "I have my freedom with
  this arm once more&mdash;for the first time to-day."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; IN THE DUSK.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Kicking along, Mr. Menaida, old man?" asked Mr.
  Scantlebray, in his loud, harsh voice, as he shook himself inside the door of
  Uncle Zachie's workshop. "And the little 'uns? Late in life to become nurse
  and keep the bottle and pap-bowl going, eh, old man? How's the orphings?
  Eating their own weight of victuals at twopence-ha'penny a head, eh? My
  experience of orphings isn't such as would make a man hilarious, and feel
  that he was filling his pockets."</p>

  <p>"Sit you down, sir; you'll find a chair. Not that one, there's a dab of
  arsenical paste got on to that. Sit you down, sir, over against me. Glad to
  see you and have some one to talk to. Here am I slaving all day, worn to
  fiddlestrings. There's Squire Rashleigh, of Menabilly, must have a glaucous
  gull stuffed at once that he has shot; and there's Sir John St. Aubyn, of
  Clowance, must have a case of kittiwakes by a certain day; and an institution
  in London wants a genuine specimen of a Cornish chough. Do they think I'm a
  tradesman to be ordered about? That I've not an income of my own, and that I
  am dependent on my customers? I'll do no more. I'll smoke and play the piano.
  I've no time to exchange a word with any one. Come, sit down. What's the
  news?"</p>

  <p>"It's a bad world," said Mr. Scantlebray, setting himself into a chair.
  "That's to say, the world is well enough if it warn't for there being too
  many rascals in it. I consider it's a duty on all right-thinking men to clear
  them off."</p>

  <p>"Well, the world would be better if we had the making of it," acquiesced
  Mr. Menaida. "Bless you! I've no time for anything. I like to do a bit of
  bird-stuffing just as a sort of relaxation after smoking, but to be forced to
  work more than one cares&mdash;I won't do it! Besides, it is not wholesome. I
  shall be poisoned with arsenic. I must have some antidote. So will you,
  sir&mdash;eh? A drop of real first-rate cognac?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir&mdash;old man&mdash;I don't mind dipping a feather and
  drawing it across my lips."</p>

  <p>Jamie had been so frightened by the encounter with Cruel Coppinger that he
  was thoroughly upset. He was a timid, nervous child, and Judith had persuaded
  him to go to bed. She sat by him, holding his hand, comforting him as best
  she might, when he sobbed over the loss of his pup, and cheering him when he
  clung to her in terror at the reminiscence of the threats of the Captain to
  deal with him as he had with Tib. Judith was under no apprehension of his
  revisiting the cave; he had been too thoroughly frightened ever to venture
  there again. She said nothing to impress this on him; all her efforts were
  directed toward allaying his alarms.</p>

  <p>Just as she hoped that he was dropping off into unconsciousness, he
  suddenly opened his eyes, and said, "Ju."</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear."</p>

  <p>"I've lost the chain."</p>

  <p>"What chain, my pretty?"</p>

  <p>"Tib's chain."</p>

  <p>The pup had been a trouble when Jamie went with the creature through the
  village or through a farm-yard. He would run after and nip the throats of
  chickens. Tib and his master had got into trouble on this account;
  accordingly Judith had turned out a light steel chain, somewhat rusty, and a
  dog collar from among the sundries that encumbered the drawers and closets of
  the rectory. This she had given to her brother, and whenever the little dog
  was near civilization he was obliged to submit to the chain.</p>

  <p>Judith, to console Jamie for his loss, had told him that in all
  probability another little dog might be procured to be his companion. Alas!
  the collar was on poor Tib, but she represented to him that if another dog
  were obtained it would be possible to buy or beg a collar for him, supposing
  a collar to be needful. This had satisfied Jamie, and he was about to doze
  off, when suddenly he woke to say that the chain was lost.</p>

  <p>"Where did you lose the chain, Jamie?"</p>

  <p>"I threw it down."</p>

  <p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I shouldn't want it when Tib was gone."</p>

  <p>"And where did you throw it? Perhaps it may be found again."</p>

  <p>"I won't go and look for it&mdash;indeed I won't." He shivered and clung
  to his sister.</p>

  <p>"Where was it? Perhaps I can find it."</p>

  <p>"I dropped it at the top&mdash;on the down when I came up the steps
  from&mdash;from that man, when he had killed Tib."</p>

  <p>"You did not throw it over the cliff?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I threw it down. I did not think I wanted it any more."</p>

  <p>"I dare say it may be found. I will go and see."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no! Don't, Ju. You might meet that man."</p>

  <p>Judith smiled. She felt that she was not afraid of that man&mdash;he would
  not hurt her.</p>

  <p>As soon as the boy was asleep, Judith descended the stairs, leaving the
  door ajar, that she might hear should he wake in a fright, and entering the
  little sitting-room, took up her needles and wool, and seated herself quietly
  by the window, where the last glimmer of twilight shone, to continue her work
  at a jersey she was knitting for Jamie's use in the winter.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere was charged with tobacco-smoke, almost as much as that of
  the adjoining workshop. There was no door between the rooms; none had been
  needed formerly, and Mr. Menaida did not think of supplying one now. It was
  questionable whether one would have been an advantage, as Jamie ran to and
  fro, and would be certain either to leave the door open or to slam it, should
  one be erected. Moreover, a door meant payment to a carpenter for timber and
  labor. There was no carpenter in the village, and Mr. Menaida spent no more
  money than he was absolutely obliged to spend, and how could he on an annuity
  of fifty pounds.</p>

  <p>Judith dropped her woolwork in her lap and fell into meditation. She
  reviewed what had just taken place: she saw before her again Coppinger,
  strongly built, with his dark face, and eyes that glared into the soul to its
  lowest depths, illumining all, not as the sun, but as the lightning, and
  suffering not a thought, not a feeling to remain obscure.</p>

  <p>A second time had Jamie done what angered him, but on this occasion he had
  curbed his passion and had contented himself with a threat&mdash;nay, not
  even that&mdash;with a caution. He had expressly told Jamie, that he himself
  would not hurt him, but that he ran into danger from others.</p>

  <p>She was again looking at Coppinger as he spoke; she saw the changes in his
  face, the alterations of expression in his eyes, in his intonation. She
  recalled the stern, menacing tone in which he had spoken to Jamie, and then
  the inflexion of voice as he referred to her. A dim surmise&mdash;a surmise
  she was ashamed to allow could be true&mdash;rose in her mind and thrilled
  her with alarm. Was it possible that he <i>liked</i>
  her&mdash;liked&mdash;she could, she would give even in thought no other term
  to describe that feeling which she feared might possibly have sprung up in
  his breast. That he liked her&mdash;after all she had done? Was that why he
  had come to the cottage the day after his accident? Was that what had
  prompted the strange note sent to her along with the keg of spirits to Uncle
  Zachie? Was that the meaning of the offer of the choice of all his
  treasures?&mdash;of the vehemence with which he had seized her hand and had
  kissed it? Was that the interpretation of those words of excuse in which he
  had declared her his queen? If this were so, then much that had been
  enigmatical in his conduct was explained&mdash;his interference with the
  valuers for dilapidations, the strange manner in which he came across her
  path almost whenever she went to the rectory. And this was the signification
  of the glow in his eyes, the quaver in his voice, when he addressed her.</p>

  <p>Was it so?&mdash;could it be so?&mdash;that he liked
  her?&mdash;he&mdash;Cruel Coppinger&mdash;<i>Cruel</i> Coppinger&mdash;the
  terror of the country round&mdash;liked <i>her</i>, the weakest creature that
  could be found?</p>

  <p>The thought of such a possibility frightened her. That the wild
  smuggler-captain should hate her she could have borne with better than that
  he should like her. That she was conscious of a sense of pleased surprise,
  intermixed with fear, was inevitable, for Judith was a woman, and there was
  something calculated to gratify feminine pride in the presumption that the
  most lawless and headstrong man on the Cornish coast should have meant what
  he said when he declared himself her subject.</p>

  <p>These thoughts, flushing and paling her cheek, quickening and staying her
  pulse, so engrossed Judith that, though she heard the voices in the adjoining
  apartment, she paid no heed to what was said.</p>

  <p>The wind, which had been fresh all day, was blowing stronger. It battered
  at the window where Judith sat, as though a hand struck and brushed over the
  panes.</p>

  <p>"Hot or cold?" asked Uncle Zachie.</p>

  <p>"Thanky', neither. Water can be got everywhere, but such brandy as this,
  old man&mdash;only here."</p>

  <p>"You are good to say so. It is Coppinger's present to me."</p>

  <p>"Coppinger!&mdash;his very good health, and may he lie in clover to-morrow
  night. He's had one arm bound, I've seen; perhaps he may have two before the
  night grows much older."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida raised his brows.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you."</p>

  <p>"I daresay not," said Scantlebray. "It's the duty of all right-minded men
  to clear the world of rascals. I will do my duty, please the pigs. Would you
  mind&mdash;just another drop?"</p>

  <p>After his glass had been refilled, Mr. Scantlebray leaned back in his
  chair and said:</p>

  <p>"It's a wicked world, and, between you and me and the sugar dissolving at
  the bottom of my glass, you won't find more rascality anywhere than in my
  profession, and one of the biggest rascals in it is Mr. Cargreen. He's on the
  side against the orphings. If you've the faculty of pity in you, pity
  them&mdash;first, because they've him agin' 'em, and, secondly, because
  they've lost me as their protector. You know whom they got in place of me? I
  wish them joy of him. But they won't have his wing over them long, I can tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"You think not?"</p>

  <p>"Sure of it."</p>

  <p>"You think he'll throw it up?"</p>

  <p>"I rather suspect he won't be at liberty to attend to it. He'll want his
  full attention to his own consarns."</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray tipped off his glass.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be a dirty night," said he. "You won't mind my spending an
  hour or two with you, will you?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted. Have you any business in the place?"</p>

  <p>"Business&mdash;no. A little pleasure, maybe." After a pause, he said,
  "But, old man, I don't mind telling you what it is. You are mum, I know. It
  is this&mdash;the trap will shut to-night. Snap it goes, and the rats are
  fast. You haven't been out on the cliffs to-day, have you?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;bless me!&mdash;no, I have not."</p>

  <p>"The Black Prince is in the offing."</p>

  <p>"The Black Prince?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, and she will run her cargo ashore to-night. Now, I'm one who knows a
  little more than most. I'm one o' your straightfor'ard 'uns, always ready to
  give a neighbor a lift in my buggy, and a helping hand to the man that is
  down, and a frank, outspoken fellow am I to every one I meet&mdash;so that,
  knocking about as I do, I come to know and to hear more than do most, and I
  happen to have learnt into what cove the Black Prince will run her goods.
  I've a bone to pick with Captain Cruel, so I've let the Preventive men have
  the contents of my information-pottle, and they will be ready to-night for
  Coppinger and the whole party of them. The cutter will slip in between them
  and the sea, and a party will be prepared to give them the kindliest welcome
  by land. That is the long and short of it&mdash;and, old man, I shall dearly
  love to be there and see the sport. That is why I wish to be with you for an
  hour or two. Will you come as well?"</p>

  <p>"Bless me!" exclaimed Mr. Menaida, "not I! You don't suppose Coppinger and
  his men will allow themselves to be taken easily? There'll be a fight."</p>

  <p>"And pistols go off," said Scantlebray. "I shall not be surprised or sorry
  if Captain Cruel be washed up one of these next tides with a bullet through
  his head. Ebenezer Wyvill is one of the guards, and he has his brother's
  death to avenge."</p>

  <p>"Do you really believe that Coppinger killed him?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray shrugged his shoulders. "It don't matter much what
  <i>I</i> think, to-night, but what the impression is that Ebenezer Wyvill
  carries about with him. I imagine that if Ebenezer comes across the Captain
  he won't speak to him by word of mouth, nor trouble himself to feel for a
  pair of handcuffs. So&mdash;fill my glass again, old man, and we'll drink to
  a cold bed and an indigestible lump&mdash;somewhere&mdash;in his head or in
  his gizzard&mdash;to Cruel Coppinger, and the wiping off of old
  scores&mdash;always a satisfaction to honest men." Scantlebray rubbed his
  hands. "It is a satisfaction to the conscience&mdash;to ferret out the rats
  sometimes."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; WARNING OF DANGER.</h2>

  <p class="first">Judith, lost for awhile in her dreams, had been brought to a
  sense of what was the subject of conversation in the adjoining room by the
  mention of Coppinger's name more than once. She heard the desultory talk for
  awhile without giving it much attention, but Scantlebray's voice was of that
  harsh and penetrating nature that to exclude it the ears must be treated as
  Ulysses treated the ears of his mariners as he passed the rock of the
  Sirens.</p>

  <p>Presently she became alive to the danger in which Coppinger stood.
  Scantlebray spoke plainly, and she understood. There could be no doubt about
  it. The Black Prince belonged to the Captain, and his dealings with and
  through that vessel were betrayed. Not only was Coppinger, as the head of a
  gang of smugglers, an object worth capture to the Preventive men, but the
  belief that he had caused the death of at least one of their number had
  embittered them against him to such an extent that, when the opportunity
  presented itself to them of capturing him red-handed engaged in his smuggling
  transactions, they were certain to deal with him in a way much more summary
  than the processes of a court of a justice. The brother of the man who had
  been murdered was among the coast-guard, and he would not willingly let slip
  a chance of avenging the death of Jonas Wyvill. Coppinger was not in a
  condition to defend himself effectively. On that day for the first time, had
  he left off his bandages, and his muscles were stiff and the newly set bones
  still weak.</p>

  <p>What was to be done? Could Judith go to bed and let Coppinger run into the
  net prepared for his feet&mdash;go to his death?</p>

  <p>No sooner, however, had Judith realized the danger that menaced Coppinger
  than she resolved on doing her utmost to avert it. She, and she alone, could
  deliver him from the disgrace, if not the death, that menaced him.</p>

  <p>She stole lightly from the room and got her cloak, drew the hood over her
  head, and sallied forth into the night. Heavy clouds rolled over the sky,
  driven before a strong gale. Now and then they opened and disclosed the
  twilight sky, in which faintly twinkled a few stars, and at such times a dim
  light fell over the road, but in another moment lumbering masses of vapor
  were carried forward, blotting out the clear tract of sky, and at the same
  time blurring all objects on earth with one enveloping shadow.</p>

  <p>Judith's heart beat furiously, and timidity came over her spirit as she
  left the cottage, for she was unaccustomed to be outside the house at such an
  hour; but the purpose she had before her eyes gave her strength and courage.
  It seemed to her that Providence had suddenly constituted her the guardian
  angel of Coppinger, and she flattered herself that, were she to be the means
  of delivering him from the threatened danger, she might try to exact of him a
  promise to discontinue so dangerous and so questionable a business. If this
  night she were able to give him warning in time, it would be some return made
  for his kindness to her, and some reparation made for the injury she had done
  him. When for an instant there was a rift in the clouds, and she could look
  up and see the pure stars, it seemed to her that they shone down on her like
  angels' eyes, watching, encouraging, and promising her protection. She
  thought of her father&mdash;of how his mind had been set against Coppinger;
  now, she felt convinced, he saw that his judgment had been warped, and that
  he would bless her for doing that which she had set her mind to accomplish.
  Her father had been ever ready frankly to acknowledge himself in the wrong
  when he had been convinced that he was mistaken, and now in the light of
  eternity, with eyes undarkened by prejudice, he must know that he was in
  error in his condemnation of Coppinger, and be glad that his daughter was
  doing something to save that man from an untimely and bloody death.</p>

  <p>Not a soul did Judith meet or pass on her way. She had determined in the
  first case to go to Pentyre Glaze. She would see if Captain Cruel were there.
  She trusted he was at his house. If so, her course was simple; she would warn
  him and return to Mr. Menaida's cottage as quickly as her feet would bear
  her. The wind caught her cloak, and she turned in alarm, fancying that it was
  plucked by a human hand. No one, however, was behind her.</p>

  <p>In Pentyre lane it was dark, very dark. The rude half-walls, half-hedges
  stood up high, walled toward the lane hedged with earth and planted with
  thorns toward the field. The wind hissed through the bushes; there was an ash
  tree by a gate. One branch sawed against another, producing a weird, even
  shrill sound like a cry.</p>

  <p>The way led past a farm, and she stole along before it with the utmost
  fear as she heard the dog in the yard begin to bark furiously, and as she
  believed that it was not chained up, might rush forth at her. It might fall
  upon her, and hold her there till the farmer came forth and found her, and
  inquired into the reason of her being there at night. If found and
  recognized, what excuse could she give? What explanation could satisfy the
  inquisitive?</p>

  <p>She did not breathe freely till she had come out on the down; the dog was
  still barking, but, as he had not pursued her, she was satisfied that he was
  not at large. Her way now lay for a while over open common, and then again
  entered a lane between the hedges that enclosed the fields and meadows of the
  Glaze.</p>

  <p>A dense darkness fell over the down, and Judith for a while was uncertain
  of her way, the track being undistinguishable from the short turf on either
  side. Suddenly she saw some flashes of light that ran along the ground and
  then disappeared.</p>

  <p>"This is the road," said a voice.</p>

  <p>Judith's heart stood still, and her blood curdled in her veins. If the
  cloud were to roll away&mdash;and she could see far off its silvery fringe,
  she would become visible. The voice was that of a man, but whether that of a
  smuggler or of a coast-guard she could not guess. By neither did she care to
  be discovered. By the dim, uncertain light she stole off the path, and sank
  upon the ground among some masses of gorse that stood on the common. Between
  the prickly tufts she might lie, and in her dark cloak be mistaken for a
  patch of furze. She drew her feet under the skirt, that the white stockings
  might not betray her, and plucked the hood of her cloak closely round her
  face. The gorse was sharp, and the spikes entered her hands and feet, and
  pricked her as she turned herself about between the bushes to bring herself
  deeper among them.</p>

  <p>From where she lay she could see the faintly illumined horizon, and
  against that horizon figures were visible, one&mdash;then another&mdash;a
  third&mdash;she could not count accurately, for there came several together;
  but she was convinced there must have been over a dozen men.</p>

  <p>"It's a'most too rough to-night, I reckon," said one of the men.</p>

  <p>"No, it is not&mdash;the wind is not direct on shore. They'll try it."</p>

  <p>"Coppinger and his chaps are down in the cove already," said a third.
  "They wouldn't go out if they wasn't expecting the boats from the Black
  Prince."</p>

  <p>"You are sure they're down, Wyvill?"</p>

  <p>"Sure and sartain. I seed 'em pass, and mighty little I liked to let 'em
  go by&mdash;without a pop from my pistol. But I'd my orders. No orders
  against the pistol going off of itself, Captain, if I have a chance
  presently?"</p>

  <p>No answer was given to this; but he who had been addressed as Captain
  asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Are the asses out?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; a whole score, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"Then they'll come up the mule path. We must watch that. Lieutenant Hanson
  will be ready with the cutter to run out and stop their way back by water to
  the Prince. The Prince's men will take to the sea, and he'll settle with
  them; but Coppinger's men will run up the cliffs, and we must tackle them. Go
  on."</p>

  <p>Several now disappeared into the darkness, moving toward the sea.</p>

  <p>"Here, a word with you, Wyvill," said the Captain.</p>

  <p>"Right, sir&mdash;here I be."</p>

  <p>"Dash it!&mdash;it is so dark! Here, step back&mdash;a word in your
  ear."</p>

  <p>"Right you are, sir."</p>

  <p>They came on to the turf close to where Judith crouched.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" said the Captain, hastily.</p>

  <p>"What, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I trod on something like cloth. Have you a light?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir! Home has the dark lantern."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is nothing. What is all that dark stuff there?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see, sir," said Wyvill, stooping, and with his hand. "By George,
  sir! it's naught but fuzz."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Wyvill&mdash;a word between us. I know that if you have the
  chance you intend to send a bullet into Coppinger. I don't blame you. I won't
  say I wouldn't do it&mdash;unofficially&mdash;but looky' here, man, if you
  can manage without a bullet&mdash;say a blow with the butt-end on his
  forehead and a roll over the cliffs&mdash;I'd prefer it. In self-defence of
  course we must use fire-arms. But there's some squeamish stomachs, you
  understand; and if it can come about accidentally, as it were&mdash;as if
  he'd missed his footing&mdash;I'd prefer it. Make it pleasant all around, if
  you can."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; leave it to me."</p>

  <p>"It oughtn't to be difficult, you know, Wyvill. I hear he's broke one arm,
  so is like to be insecure in his hold climbing the cliffs. Then no questions
  asked, and more pleasant, you know. You understand me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; thank you, sir."</p>

  <p>Then they went on, and were lost to sight and to hearing. For some minutes
  Judith did not stir. She lay, recovering her breath; she had hardly ventured
  to breathe while the two men were by her, the Captain with his foot on her
  skirt. Now she remained motionless, to consider what was to be done. It was
  of no further use her going on to Pentyre Glaze. Coppinger had left it.
  Wyvill, who had been planted as spy, had seen him with his carriers defile
  out of the lane with the asses that were to bring up the smuggled goods from
  the shore.</p>

  <p>She dare not take the path by which on the preceding afternoon she had
  descended with Jamie to the beach, for it was guarded by the Preventive
  men.</p>

  <p>There was but one way by which she could reach the shore and warn
  Coppinger, and that was by the chimney of the cave&mdash;a way dangerous in
  daylight, one, moreover, not easy to find at night. The mouth of the chimney
  opened upon a ledge that overhung the sea half-way down the face of the
  precipice, and this ledge could only be reached by a narrow track&mdash;a
  track apparently traced by sheep.</p>

  <p>Judith thought that she might find her way to that part of the down from
  which the descent was to be made; for she had noticed that what is locally
  called a "new-take" wall came near it, and if she could hit this wall, she
  believed she could trace it up to where it approached the cliff: and the
  track descended somewhere thereabouts. She waited where she lay till the
  heavy clouds rolled by, and for a brief space the sky was comparatively
  clear. Then she rose, and took the direction in which she ought to go to
  reach the "new-take" wall. As she went over the down, she heard the sea
  roaring threateningly; on her left hand the glint of the light-house on
  Trevose Head gave her the direction she must pursue. But, on a down like
  that, with a precipice on one hand, in a light, uncertain at best, often in
  complete darkness, it was dangerous to advance except by thrusting the foot
  forward tentatively before taking a step. The sea and the gnawing winds
  caused the cliffs to crumble; bits were eaten out of the surface, and in
  places there were fissures in the turf where a rent had formed, and where
  shortly a mass would fall.</p>

  <p>It is said that the duties on customs were originally instituted in order
  to enable the Crown to afford protection to trade against pirates. The
  pirates ceased to infest the seas, but the duties were not only taken off,
  but were increased, and became a branch of the public revenue. Perhaps some
  consciousness that the profits were not devoted to the purpose originally
  intended, bred in the people on the coast a feeling of resentment against the
  imposition of duties. There certainly existed an impression, a conviction
  rather, that the violation of a positive law of this nature was in no respect
  criminal. Adventurers embarked in the illicit traffic without scruple, as
  they did in poaching. The profit was great, and the danger run enhanced the
  excitement of the pursuit, and gave a sort of heroic splendor to the
  achievements of the successful smuggler.</p>

  <p>The Government, to stop a traffic that injured legitimate trade and
  affected the revenue, imposed severe penalties. Smuggling was classed among
  the felonies, "without benefit of clergy," the punishment for which was death
  and confiscation of goods. The consciousness that they would be dealt with
  with severity did not deter bold men from engaging in the traffic, but made
  them desperate in self-defence when caught. Conflicts with revenue officers
  were not uncommon, and lives were lost on both sides. The smugglers were not
  bound together by any link, and sometimes one gang was betrayed by another,
  so as to divert suspicion and attention from their own misdeeds, or out of
  jealousy, or on account of a quarrel. It was so on this occasion: the success
  of Coppinger, the ingenuity with which he had carried on his defiance of the
  law, caused envy of him, because he was a foreigner&mdash;was, at all events,
  not a Cornishman; this had induced a rival to give notice to the Revenue
  officers, through Scantlebray&mdash;a convenient go-between in a good many
  questionable negotiations. The man who betrayed Coppinger dared not be seen
  entering into communication with the officers of the law. He, therefore,
  employed Scantlebray as the vehicle through whom, without suspicion resting
  on himself, his rival might be fallen upon and his proceedings brought to an
  end.</p>

  <p>It was now very dark. Judith had reached and touched a wall; but in the
  darkness lost her bearings. The Trevose light was no longer visible, and
  directly she left the wall to strike outward she became confused as
  direction, and in the darkness groped along with her feet, stretching her
  hands before her. Then the rain came down, lashing in her face. The wind had
  shifted somewhat during the evening, and it was no guidance to Judith to feel
  from what quarter the rain drove against her. Moreover, the cove formed a
  great curve in the coast-line, and was indented deeply in some places, so
  that to grope round the edge without light in quest of a point only seen or
  noticed once, seemed a desperate venture. Suddenly Judith's foot caught. It
  was entangled, and she could not disengage it. She stooped, and put her hand
  on a chain. It was Jamie's steel dog-chain, one link of which had caught in a
  tuft of rest-harrow.</p>

  <p>She had found the spot she wanted, and now waited only till the rain had
  rushed further inland, and a fringe of light appeared in the sky, to advance
  to the very edge of the cliff. She found it expedient to stoop as she
  proceeded, so as to discover some indications of the track. There were
  depressions where feet had worn the turf, and she set hers therein, and
  sought the next. Thus, creeping and groping, she neared the edge.</p>

  <p>And now came the moment of supreme peril, when, trusting that she had
  found the right path, she must go over the brink. If she were mistaken, the
  next step would send her down two hundred feet, to where she heard the roar,
  and felt the breath of the sea stream up to her from the abyss. Here she
  could distinguish nothing; she must trust to Providence to guide her steps.
  She uttered a short and earnest prayer, and then boldly descended. She could
  not stoop now. To stoop was to dive headlong down. She felt her way, however,
  with her feet, reached one firm station, then another. Her hands touched the
  grass and earth of the ragged margin, then with another step she was below
  it, and held to the rain-splashed fangs of rock.</p>

  <p>Clinging, with her face inward, feeling with her feet, and never sure but
  that the next moment might see her launched into air, she stole onward,
  slowly, cautiously, and ever with the gnawing dread in her heart lest she
  should be too late. One intense point of consciousness stood out in her
  brain&mdash;it told her that if, while thus creeping down, there should come
  the flash and explosion of fire-arms, her courage would fail, her head would
  spin, and she would be lost.</p>

  <p>How long she was descending she could not tell, how many steps she took
  was unknown to her&mdash;she had not counted&mdash;but it seemed to her an
  entire night that passed, with every change of position an hour was marked;
  then, at last, she was conscious that she stood on more level ground. She had
  reached the terrace.</p>

  <p>A little further, and on her left hand, would open the mouth of the shaft,
  and she must descend that, in profoundest darkness. A cry! A light flashed
  into her eyes and dazzled her. A hand at the same moment clutched her, or she
  would have reeled back and gone over the cliff.</p>

  <p>The light was held to pour over her face. Who held it and who grasped her
  she could not see; but she knew the moment she heard a voice
  exclaim&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Judith!"</p>

  <p>In her terror and exhaustion she could but gasp for breath for a few
  moments.</p>

  <p>By degrees her firmness and resolution returned, and she exclaimed, in
  broken tones, panting between every few words&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Captain Cruel!&mdash;you are betrayed&mdash;they are after you!"</p>

  <p>He did not press her. He waited till she could speak again, lowering the
  lantern.</p>

  <p>Then, without the glare in her eyes, she was able to speak more
  freely.</p>

  <p>"There is a boat&mdash;a Revenue cutter&mdash;waiting in the
  bay&mdash;and&mdash;above&mdash;are the Preventive men&mdash;and they will
  kill you."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said he. "And you have come to warn me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Tell me&mdash;are there any above, where you came down!"</p>

  <p>"None; they are on the ass-path."</p>

  <p>"Can you ascend as you came down?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>He extinguished his lantern, or covered it.</p>

  <p>"I must no more show light. I must warn those below." He paused, then
  said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Dare you mount alone."</p>

  <p>"I came down alone."</p>

  <p>"Then do this one thing more for me. Mount, and go to Pentyre. Tell your
  aunt&mdash;three lights&mdash;red, white, red; then ten minutes, and then,
  red, red, white. Can you remember? Repeat after me: 'Three lights&mdash;red,
  white, red; then, ten minutes, and next, red, red, and white.'"</p>

  <p>Judith repeated the words.</p>

  <p>"That is right. Lose no time. I dare not give you a light. None must now
  be shown. The boat from the Black Prince is not in&mdash;this lantern was her
  guide. Now it is out she will go back. You will remember the signals? I thank
  you for what you have done. There is but one woman would have done it, and
  that Judith."</p>

  <p>He stepped inside the shaft to descend. When hidden, he allowed his light
  again to show, to assist him in his way down. Judith only waited till her
  eyes, that had been dazzled by the light, were recovered, and then she braced
  herself to resume her climb; but now it was to be up the cliff.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; CHAINED.</h2>

  <p class="first">To ascend is easier than to go down. Judith was no longer
  alarmed. There was danger still, that was inevitable; but the danger was as
  nothing now to what it had been. It is one thing to descend in total darkness
  into an abyss where one knows that below are sharp rocks, and a drop of two
  hundred feet to a thundering, raging sea, racing up the sand, pouring over
  the shelves of rock, foaming where divided waves clash. When Judith had been
  on the beach in the afternoon the tide was out; now it was flowing, and had
  swept over all that tract of white sand and pebble where she had walked. She
  could not indeed now see the water, but she heard the thud of a billow as it
  smote a rock, the boil and the hiss of the waves and spray. To step downward,
  groping the way, with a depth and a wild-throbbing sea beneath, demanded
  courage, and courage of no mean order; but it was other to mount, to be able
  to feel with the foot the ascent in the track, and to grope upward with the
  hand from one point of clutch to another, to know that every step upward was
  lessening the peril, and bringing nearer to the sward and to safety.</p>

  <p>Without great anxiety, therefore, Judith turned to climb. Cruel Coppinger
  had allowed her to essay it unaided. Would he have done that had he thought
  it involved danger, or, rather, serious danger? Judith was sure he would not.
  His confidence that she could climb to the summit unassisted made her
  confident. As she had descended she had felt an interior qualm and sinking at
  every step she took; there was no such sensation now as she mounted.</p>

  <p>She was not much inconvenienced by the wind, for the wind was not directly
  on shore; but it soughed about her, and eddies caught her cloak and jerked
  it. It would have been better had she left her cloak above on the turf. It
  incommoded her in her climb; it caught in the prongs of rock.</p>

  <p>The rain, the water running off the rock, had wet her shoes, soaked them,
  and every step was in moisture that oozed out of them. She was glad now to
  rest on her right hand. In descending, the left had felt and held the rock,
  and it had been rubbed and cut. Probably it was bleeding.</p>

  <p>Surely there was a little more light in the sky where the sky showed
  between the dense masses of vapor. Judith did not observe this, for she did
  not look aloft; but she could see a steely tract of sea, fretted into foam,
  reflecting an illumination from above, greater than the twilight could cast.
  Then she remembered that there had been a moon a few nights before, and
  thought that it was probably risen by this time.</p>

  <p>Something chill and wet brushed her face. It startled her for a moment,
  and then she knew by the scent that it was a bunch of samphire growing out of
  the side of the crag.</p>

  <p>Shrill in her ear came the scream of a gull that rushed by in the
  darkness, and she felt, or believed she felt, the fan from the wings. Again
  it screamed, and near the ear it pierced her brain like an awl, and then
  again, still nearer, unnerving her. In the darkness she fancied that this
  gull was about to attack her with beak and claws, and she put up her left arm
  as a protection to her eyes. Then there broke out a jabber of sea-birds'
  voices, laughing mockingly, at a little distance.</p>

  <p>Whither had she got!</p>

  <p>The way was no longer easy&mdash;one step before another&mdash;there was a
  break of continuity in the path, if path the track could be called.</p>

  <p>Judith stood still, and put forward her foot to test the rock in front.
  There was no place where it could rest. Had she, bewildered by that gull,
  diverged from the track? It would be well to retreat a few steps. She
  endeavored to do this, and found that she encountered a difficulty in finding
  the place where she had just planted her foot.</p>

  <p>It was but too certain that she was off the track line. How to recover it
  she knew not. With the utmost difficulty she did reach a point in her rear
  where she could stand, clinging to the rock; but she clung now with both
  hands. There was no tuft of samphire to brush her face as she descended. She
  must have got wrong before she touched that. But where was the samphire? She
  cautiously felt along the surface of the crag in quest of it, but could not
  find it. There was, however, a little above her shoulder, a something that
  felt like a ledge, and which might be the track. If she had incautiously
  crept forward at a level without ascending rapidly enough, she was probably
  below the track. Could she climb to this point&mdash;climb up the bare rock,
  with sheer precipice below her? And, supposing that the shelf she felt with
  her hand were not the track, could she descend again to the place where she
  had been?</p>

  <p>Her brain spun. She lost all notion as to where she might be&mdash;perhaps
  she was below the path, perhaps she was above it. She could not tell. She
  stood with arms extended, clinging to the rock, and her heart beat in bounds
  against the flinty surface. The clasp of her cloak was pressing on her
  throat, and strangling her. The wind had caught the garment, and was playing
  with the folds, carrying it out and flapping it behind her over the gulf. It
  was irksome; it was a danger to her. She cautiously slid one hand to her
  neck, unhasped the mantle, and it was snatched from her shoulders and carried
  away. She was lighter without it, could move with greater facility; cold she
  was not, wet she might become, but what mattered that if she could reach the
  top of the cliff?</p>

  <p>Not only on her own account was Judith alarmed. She had undertaken a
  commission. She had promised to bear a message to her aunt from Coppinger
  that concerned the safety of his men. What the signal meant she did not know,
  but suspected that it conveyed a message of danger.</p>

  <p>She placed both her hands on the ledge, and felt with her knee for some
  point on which to rest it, to assist her in lifting herself from where she
  stood to the higher elevation. There was a small projection, and after a
  moment's hesitation she drew her foot from the shelf whereon it had rested
  and leaned the left knee on this hunch. Then she clung with both hands, and
  with them and her knee endeavored to heave herself up about four feet, that
  is, to the height of her shoulders. A convulsive quiver seized on her
  muscles. She was sustained by a knee and her hands only. If they gave way she
  could not trust to recover her previous lodgement place. One desperate
  strain, and she was on the ledge, on both knees, and was feeling with her
  hands to ascertain if she had found the track. Her fingers touched thrift and
  passed over turf. She had not reached what she sought. She was probably
  farther from it than before. As all her members were quivering after the
  effort, she seated herself on the shelf she had reached, leaned back against
  the wet rock, and waited till her racing pulses had recovered evenness of
  flow, and her muscles had overcome the first effects of their tension.</p>

  <p>Her position was desperate. Rain and perspiration mingled dripped from her
  brow, ran over and blinded her eyes. Her breath came in sobs between her
  parted lips. Her ears were full of the booming of the surge far below, and
  the scarcely less noisy throb of her blood in her pulses.</p>

  <p>When she had started on her adventurous expedition she had seen some stars
  that had twinkled down on her, and had appeared to encourage her. Now, not a
  star was visible, only, far off on the sea, a wan light that fell through a
  rent in the black canopy over an angry deep. Beyond that all was darkness,
  between her and that all was darkness.</p>

  <p>As she recovered her self-possession, with the abatement of the tumult in
  her blood she was able to review her position, and calculate her chances of
  escape from it.</p>

  <p>Up the track from the cave the smugglers would almost certainly escape,
  because that was the only way, unwatched, by which they could leave the beach
  without falling into the hands of the Preventive men.</p>

  <p>If they came by the path&mdash;that path could not be far off, though in
  which direction it lay she could not guess. She would call, and then
  Coppinger or some of his men would come to her assistance.</p>

  <p>By this means alone could she escape. There was nothing for her to do but
  to wait.</p>

  <p>She bent forward and looked down. She might have been looking into a well;
  but a little way out she could see, or imagine she saw, the white fringes of
  surf stealing in. There was not sufficient light for her to be certain
  whether she really saw foam, or whether her fancy, excited by the thunder of
  the tide, made her suppose she saw it.</p>

  <p>The shelf she occupied was narrow and inclined; if she slipped from it she
  could not trust to maintain herself on the lower shelf, certainly not if she
  slid down in a condition of unconsciousness. And now reaction after the
  strain was setting in, and she feared lest she might faint. In her pocket was
  the dog-chain that had caught her foot. She extracted that now, and groping
  along the wall of rock behind her, caught a stout tuft of coarse heather,
  wiry, well rooted; and she took the little steel chain and wound it about the
  branches and stem of the plant, and also about her wrist&mdash;her right
  wrist&mdash;so as to fasten her to the wall. That was some relief to her to
  know that in the event of her dropping out of consciousness there was
  something to hold her up, though that was only the stem of an erica, and her
  whole weight would rest on its rootlets. Would they suffice to sustain her?
  It was doubtful; but there was nothing else on which she could depend.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a stone whizzed past, struck the ledge, and rebounded. Then came
  a shower of earth and pebbles. They did not touch her, but she heard them
  clatter down.</p>

  <p>Surely they had been displaced by a foot, and that a foot passing
  above.</p>

  <p>Then she heard a shot&mdash;also overhead, and a cry. She looked aloft,
  and saw against the half-translucent vapors a black struggling figure on the
  edge of the cliff. She saw it but for an instant, and then was struck on the
  face by an open hand, and a body crashed on to the shelf at her side, rolled
  over the edge, and plunged into the gulf below.</p>

  <p>She tried to cry, but her voice failed her. She felt her cheek stung by
  the blow she had received. A feeling as though all the rock were sinking
  under her came on, as though she were sliding&mdash;not shooting&mdash;but
  sliding down, down, and the sky went up higher, higher&mdash;and she knew no
  more.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; ON THE SHINGLE.</h2>

  <p class="first">The smugglers, warned by Coppinger, had crept up the path in
  silence, and singly, at considerable intervals between each, and on reaching
  the summit of the cliffs had dispersed to their own homes, using the
  precaution to strike inland first, over the "new-take" wall.</p>

  <p>As the last of the party reached the top he encountered one of the
  coast-guards, who, by the orders of his superior, was patrolling the down to
  watch that the smugglers did not leave the cove by any other path than the
  one known&mdash;that up and down which donkeys were driven. This
  donkey-driving to the beach was not pursued solely for the sake of
  contraband; the beasts brought up loads of sand, which the farmers professed
  they found valuable as manure on their stiff soil, and also the masses of
  seaweed cast on the strand after a gale, and which was considered to be
  possessed of rare fertilizing qualities.</p>

  <p>No sooner did the coast-guard see a man ascend the cliff, or rather come
  up over the edge before him, than he fired his pistol to give the signal to
  his fellows, whereupon the smuggler turned, seized him by the throat, and
  precipitated him over the edge.</p>

  <p>Of this Coppinger knew nothing. He had led the procession, and had made
  his way to Pentyre Glaze by a roundabout route, so as to evade a guard set to
  watch for him approaching from the cliffs, should one have been so
  planted.</p>

  <p>On reaching his door, his first query was whether the signals had been
  made.</p>

  <p>"What signals?" asked Miss Trevisa.</p>

  <p>"I sent a messenger here with instructions."</p>

  <p>"No messenger has been here."</p>

  <p>"What, no one&mdash;not&mdash;" he hesitated, and said, "not a woman?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul has been here&mdash;man, woman, or child&mdash;since you
  left."</p>

  <p>"No one to see you?"</p>

  <p>"No one at all, Captain."</p>

  <p>Coppinger did not remove his hat; he stood in the doorway biting his
  thumb. Was it possible that Judith had shrunk from coming to his house to
  bear the message? Yet she had promised to do so. Had she been intercepted by
  the Preventive men? Had&mdash;had she reached the top of the cliff? Had she,
  after reaching the top, lost her way in the dark, taken a false direction,
  and&mdash;Coppinger did not allow the thought to find full expression in his
  brain. He turned, without another word, and hastened to the cottage of Mr.
  Menaida. He must ascertain whether she had reached home.</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie had not retired to bed; Scantlebray had been gone an hour;
  Zachie had drunk with Scantlebray, and he had drunk after the departure of
  that individual to indemnify himself for the loss of his company.
  Consequently Mr. Menaida was confused in mind and thick in talk.</p>

  <p>"Where is Judith?" asked Coppinger, bursting in on him.</p>

  <p>"In bed, I suppose," answered Uncle Zachie, after a while, when he
  comprehended the question, and had had time to get over his surprise at
  seeing the Captain.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure? When did she come in?"</p>

  <p>"Come in?" said the old man, scratching his forehead with his pipe. "Come
  in&mdash;bless you, I don't know; some time in the afternoon. Yes, to be sure
  it was, some time in the afternoon."</p>

  <p>"But she has been out to-night?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no," said Uncle Zachie, "it was Scantlebray."</p>

  <p>"I say she has&mdash;she has been to&mdash;" he paused, then
  said&mdash;"to see her aunt."</p>

  <p>"Aunt Dunes! bless my heart, when?"</p>

  <p>"To-night."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"But I say she has. Come, Mr. Menaida. Go up to her room, knock at the
  door, and ascertain if she be back. Her aunt is alarmed&mdash;there are rough
  folks about."</p>

  <p>"Why, bless me!" exclaimed Mr. Menaida, "so there are. And&mdash;well,
  wonders'll never cease. How came you here! I thought the guard were after
  you. Scantlebray said so."</p>

  <p>"Will you go at once and see if Judith Trevisa is home?"</p>

  <p>Coppinger spoke with such vehemence, and looked so threateningly at the
  old man, that he staggered out of his chair, and, still holding his pipe,
  went to the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Bless me!" said he, "whatever am I about? I've forgot a candle. Would you
  oblige me with lighting one? My hand shakes, and I might light my fingers by
  mistake."</p>

  <p>After what seemed to Coppinger to be an intolerable length of time, Uncle
  Zachie stumbled down the stairs again.</p>

  <p>"I say," said Mr. Menaida, standing on the steps, "Captain&mdash;did you
  ever hear about Tincombe Lane?&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Tincombe Lane is all up-hill, Or down hill, as you take it; You tumble up
  and crack your crown, Or tumble down and break it.'</p>

  <p>&mdash;It's the same with these blessed stairs. Would you mind lending me
  a hand? By the powers, the banister is not firm! Do you know how it goes
  on?&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Tincombe Lane is crooked and straight As pot-hook or as arrow. 'Tis
  smooth to foot, 'tis full of rut, 'Tis wide and then 'tis narrow.'</p>

  <p>&mdash;Thank you, sir, thank you. Now take the candle. Bah! I've broke my
  pipe&mdash;and then comes the moral&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Tincombe Lane is just like life From when you leave your mother, 'Tis
  sometimes this, 'tis sometimes that, 'Tis one thing or the other.'"</p>

  <p>In vain had Coppinger endeavored to interrupt the flow of words, and to
  extract from thick Zachie the information he needed, till the old gentleman
  was back in his chair.</p>

  <p>Then Uncle Zachie observed&mdash;"Blessy'&mdash;I said so&mdash;I said so
  a thousand times. No&mdash;she's not there. Tell Aunt Dunes so. Will you sit
  down and have a drop? The night is rough, and it will do you good&mdash;take
  the chill out of your stomach and the damp out of your chest."</p>

  <p>But Coppinger did not wait to decline the offer. He turned at once, left
  the house, and dashed the door back as he stepped out into the night. He had
  not gone a hundred paces along the road before he heard voices, and
  recognized that of Mr. Scantlebray&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I tell you the vessel is the Black Prince, and I know he was to have
  unloaded her to-night."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow he is not doing so. Not a sign of him."</p>

  <p>"The night is too dirty."</p>

  <p>"Wyvill&mdash;" Coppinger knew that the Captain at the head of the
  coast-guard was speaking. "Wyvill, I heard a pistol-shot. Where is Jenkyns?
  If you had not been by me I should have said you had acted wide of your
  orders. Has any one seen Jenkyns?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Who is that?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly a light flashed forth, and glared upon Coppinger. The Captain in
  command of the coast-guard uttered an oath.</p>

  <p>"You out to-night, Mr. Coppinger! Where do you come from?"</p>

  <p>"As you see&mdash;from Polzeath."</p>

  <p>"Humph! From no other direction?"</p>

  <p>"I'll trouble you to let me pass."</p>

  <p>Coppinger thrust the Preventive man aside, and went on his way.</p>

  <p>When he was beyond earshot, Scantlebray said&mdash;"I trust he did not
  notice me along with you. You see, the night is too dirty. Let him bless his
  stars, it has saved him."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see Jenkyns," said the officer. "I am almost certain I
  heard a pistol-shot; but when I sent in the direction whence it came, there
  was no one to be seen. It's a confounded dark night."</p>

  <p>"I hope they've not give us the slip, Captain?" said Wyvill.</p>

  <p>"Impossible," answered the officer. "Impossible. I took every precaution.
  They did not go out to-night. As Mr. Scantlebray says, the night was too
  dirty."</p>

  <p>Then they went on.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Coppinger was making the best of his way to the downs. He
  knew his direction even in the dark&mdash;he had the "new-take" wall as a
  guide. What the coast-guard did not suspect was that this "new-take" had been
  made for the very purpose of serving as a guide by which the smugglers could
  find their course in the blackest of winter's nights; moreover, in the
  fiercest storm the wall served as a shelter, under lea of which they might
  approach their cave. Coppinger was without a lantern. He doubted if one would
  avail him, in his quest; moreover, the night was lightening, as the moon rode
  higher.</p>

  <p>The smuggler captain stood for a moment on the edge of the cliffs to
  consider what course he should adopt to find Judith. If she had reached the
  summit, it was possible enough that she had lost her way and had rambled
  inland among lanes and across fields, pixy-led. In that case it was a
  hopeless task to search for her; moreover, there would be no particular
  necessity for him to do so, as, sooner or later, she must reach a cottage or
  a farm, where she could learn her direction. But if she had gone too near the
  edge, or if, in her ascent, her foot had slipped, then he must search the
  shore. The tide was ebbing now, and left a margin on which he could walk.
  This was the course he must adopt. He did not descend by the track to the
  chimney, as the creeping down of the latter could be effected in absolute
  darkness only with extreme risk; but he bent his way over the down skirting
  the crescent indentation of the cove to the donkey-path, which was now, as he
  knew, unwatched. By that he swiftly and easily descended to the beach. Along
  the shore he crept carefully toward that portion which was overhung by the
  precipice along which the way ran from the mouth of the shaft. The night was
  mending, or at all events seemed better. The moon, as it mounted, cast a
  glimmer through the least opaque portions of the driving clouds. Coppinger
  looked up, and could see the ragged fringe of down torn with gullies, and
  thrust up into prongs, black as ink against the gray of the half-translucent
  vapors. And near at hand was the long dorsal ridge that concealed the
  entrance to the cave, sloping rapidly upward and stretching away before him
  into shadow.</p>

  <p>Coppinger mused. If one were to fall from above, would he drop between the
  cliff and this curtain, or would he strike and be projected over it on to the
  shelving sand up which stole the waves? He knew that the water eddying
  against friable sandstone strata that came to the surface had eaten them out
  with the wash, and that the hard flakes of slate and ribs of quartz stood
  forth, overhanging the cave. Most certainly, therefore, had Judith fallen,
  her body must be sought on the sea-face of the masking ridge. The smuggler
  stood at the very point where in the preceding afternoon Jamie and the dog
  had scrambled up that fin-like blade of rock and disappeared from the
  astonished gaze of Judith. The moon, smothered behind clouds, and yet, in a
  measure self-assertive, cast sufficient light down into the cove to glitter
  on, and transmute into steel, the sea-washed and smoothed, and still wet,
  ridge, sloping inland as a seawall. As Coppinger stood looking upward he saw
  in the uncertain light something caught on the fangs of this saw-ridge,
  moving uneasily this way, then that, something dark, obscuring the glossed
  surface of the rock, as it might be a mass of gigantic sea-tangles.</p>

  <p>"Judith!" he cried. "Is that you?" and he plunged through the pool that
  intervened, and scrambled up the rock.</p>

  <p>He caught something. It was cloth. "Judith! Judith!" he almost shrieked in
  anxiety. That which he had laid hold of yielded, and he gathered to him a
  garment of some sort, and with it he slid back into the pool, and waded on to
  the pebbles. Then he examined his capture by the uncertain light, and by
  feel, and convinced himself that it was a cloak&mdash;a cloak with clasp and
  hood&mdash;just such as he had seen Judith wearing when he flashed his
  lantern over her on the platform at the mouth of the shaft.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment, numbed as though he had been struck on the head
  with a mallet, and irresolute. He had feared that Judith had fallen over the
  edge, but he had hoped that it was not so. This discovery seemed to confirm
  his worst fears.</p>

  <p>If the cloak were there&mdash;she also would probably be there also, a
  broken heap. She who had thrown him down and broken him, had been thrown down
  herself, and broken also&mdash;thrown down and broken because she had come to
  rescue him from danger. Coppinger put his hand to his head. His veins were
  beating as though they would burst the vessels in his temples, and suffuse
  his face with blood. As he stood thus clasping his brow with his right hand,
  the clouds were swept for an instant aside, and for an instant the moon sent
  down a weird glare that ran like a wave along the sand, leaped impediments,
  scrambled up rocks, and flashed in the pools. For one moment only&mdash;but
  that sufficed to reveal to him a few paces ahead a black heap: there was no
  mistaking it. The rounded outlines were not those of a rock. It was a human
  body lying on the shingle half immersed in the pool at the foot of the
  reef!</p>

  <p>A cry of intensest, keenest anguish burst from the heart of Coppinger.
  Prepared though he was for what he must see by the finding of the cloak, the
  sight of that motionless and wrecked body was more than he could endure with
  composure. In the darkness that ensued after the moon-gleam he stepped
  forward, slowly, even timidly, to where that human wreck lay, and knelt on
  both knees beside it on the wet sand.</p>

  <p>He waited. Would the moon shine out again and show him what he dreaded
  seeing? He would not put down a hand to touch it. One still clasped his brow,
  the other he could not raise so high, and he held it against his breast where
  it had lately been strapped. He tried to hold his breath, to hear if any
  sound issued from what lay before him. He strained his eyes to see if there
  were any, the slightest movement in it. Yet he knew there could be none. A
  fall from these cliffs above must dash every spark of life out of a body that
  reeled down them. He turned his eyes upward to see if the cloud would pass;
  but no&mdash;it seemed to be one that was all-enveloping, unwilling to grant
  him that glimpse which must be had, but which would cause him acutest
  anguish.</p>

  <p>He could not remain kneeling there in suspense any longer. In uncertainty
  he was not. The horror was before him&mdash;and must be faced.</p>

  <p>He thrust his hand into his pocket and drew forth tinder-box and flint.
  With a hand that had never trembled before, but now shaking as with an ague,
  he struck a light. The sparks flew about, and were long in igniting the
  touchwood. But finally it was kindled, and glowed red. The wind fanned it
  into fitful flashes, as Coppinger, stooping, held the lurid spark over the
  prostrate form, and passed it up and down on the face. Then suddenly it fell
  from his hand, and he drew a gasp. The dead face was that of a bearded
  man.</p>

  <p>A laugh&mdash;a wild, boisterous laugh&mdash;rang out into the night, and
  was re-echoed by the cliff, as Coppinger leaped to his feet. There was hope
  still. Judith had not fallen.</p>

  <p class="first">Coppinger did not hesitate a moment now to leave the corpse
  on the beach where he had found it, and to hasten to the cave.</p>

  <p>There was a third alternative to which hitherto he had given no attention.
  Judith, in ascending the cliff, might have strayed from the track, and be in
  such a position that she could neither advance nor draw back. He would,
  therefore, explore the path from the chimney mouth, and see if any token
  could be found of her having so done.</p>

  <p>He again held his smouldering tinder and by this feeble glimmer made his
  way up the inclined beach within the cave, passed under the arch of the rock
  where low, and found himself in that portion where was the boat.</p>

  <p>Here he knew of a receptacle for sundries, such as might be useful in an
  emergency, and to that he made his way, and drew from it a piece of candle
  and a lantern. He speedily lighted the candle, set it in the lantern, and
  then ascended the chimney.</p>

  <p>On reaching the platform at the orifice in the face of the rock, it
  occurred to him that he had forgotten to bring rope with him. He would not
  return for that, unless he found a need for it. Rope there was below, of many
  yards length. Till he knew that it was required, it seemed hardly worth his
  while to encumber himself with a coil that might be too long or too short for
  use. He did not even know that he would find Judith. It was a chance, that
  was all. It was more probable that she had strayed on the down, and was now
  back at Polzeath, and safe and warm in bed.</p>

  <p>From the ledge in front of the shaft Coppinger proceeded with caution and
  leisure, exploring every portion of the ascent with lowered lantern. There
  were plenty of impressions of feet wherever the soft and crumbly beds had
  been traversed, and where the dissolved stone had been converted into clay or
  mud, but these were the impressions of the smugglers escaping from their den.
  Step by step he mounted, till he had got about half-way up, when he noticed,
  what he had not previously observed, that there was a point at which the
  track left the ledge of stratified vertical rock that had inclined its broken
  edge upward, and by a series of slips mounted to another fractured stratum, a
  leaf of the story-book turned up with the record of infinite ages sealed up
  in it. It was possible that one unacquainted with the course might grope
  onward, following the ledge instead of deserting it for a direct upward
  climb. As Coppinger now perceived, one ignorant of the way and unprovided
  with a light would naturally follow the shelf. He accordingly deserted the
  track, and advanced along the ledge. There was a little turf in one place, in
  the next a tuft of armeria, then mud or clay, and there&mdash;assuredly a
  foot had trodden. There was a mark of a sole that was too small to have
  belonged to a man.</p>

  <p>The shelf at first was tolerably broad, and could be followed without risk
  by one whose head was steady; but for how long would it so continue? These
  rough edges, these lamin of upheaved slate were treacherous&mdash;they were
  sometimes completely broken down, forming gaps, in places stridable, in
  others discontinuous for many yards.</p>

  <p>The footprints satisfied Coppinger that Judith had crept along this
  terrace, and so had missed the right course. It was impossible that she could
  reach the summit by this way&mdash;she must have fallen or be clinging at
  some point farther ahead, a point from which she could not advance, and
  feared to retreat.</p>

  <p>He held the lantern above his head, and peered before him, but could see
  nothing. The glare of the artificial light made the darkness beyond its
  radius the deeper and more impervious to the eye. He called, but received no
  answer. He called again, with as little success. He listened, but heard no
  other sound than the mutter of the sea, and the wail of the wind. There was
  nothing for him to do but to go forward; and he did that slowly, searchingly,
  with the light near the ground, seeking for some further trace of Judith. He
  was obliged to use caution, as the ledge of rock narrowed. Here it was hard,
  and the foot passing over it made no impression. Then ensued a rift and a
  slide of shale, and here he thought he observed indications of recent
  dislodgement.</p>

  <p>Now the foot-hold was reduced, he could no longer stoop to examine the
  soil; he must stand upright and hold to the rock with his right hand, and
  move with precaution lest he should be precipitated below.</p>

  <p>Was it conceivable that she had passed there?&mdash;there in the dark? And
  yet&mdash;if she had not, she must have been hurled below.</p>

  <p>Coppinger, clinging with his fingers, and thrusting one foot before the
  other, then drawing forward that foot, with every faculty on the alert,
  passed to where, for a short space, the ledge of rock expanded, and there he
  stooped once more with the light to explore. Beyond was a sheer fall, and the
  dull glare from his lantern showed him no continuance of the shelf. As he
  arose from his bent position, suddenly the light fell on a hand&mdash;a
  delicate, childish hand&mdash;hanging down. He raised the lantern, and saw
  her whom he sought. At this point she had climbed upward to a higher ledge,
  and on that she lay, one arm raised, fastened by a chain to a tuft of
  heather&mdash;her head fallen against the rock, and feet and one arm over the
  edge of the cliff. She was unconscious, sustained by a dog-chain and a little
  bunch of ling.</p>

  <p>Coppinger passed the candle over her face. It was white, and the eyes did
  not close before the light.</p>

  <p>His position was vastly difficult. She hung there chained to the cliff,
  and he doubted whether he could sustain her weight if he attempted to carry
  her back while she was unconscious, along the way he and she had come. It was
  perilous for one alone to move along that strip of surface; it seemed
  impossible for one to effect it bearing in his arms a human burden.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Coppinger was well aware that his left arm had not recovered its
  strength. He could not trust her weight on that. He dare not trust it on his
  right arm, for to return by the way he came the right hand would be that
  which was toward the void. The principal weight must be thrown inward.</p>

  <p>What was to be done? This, primarily: to release the insensible girl from
  her present position, in which the agony of the strain on her shoulder
  perhaps prolonged her unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>Coppinger mounted to the shelf on which she lay, and bowing himself over
  her, while holding her, so that she should not slip over the edge, he
  disentangled the chain from her wrist and the stems of the heather. Then he
  seated himself beside her, drew her toward him, with his right arm about her,
  and laid her head on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>And the chain?</p>

  <p>That he took and deliberately passed it round her waist and his own body,
  fastened it, and muttered, "For life or for death!"</p>

  <p>There, for a while, he sat. He had set the lantern beside him. His hand
  was on Judith's heart, and he held his breath, and waited to feel if there
  was pulsation there; but his own arteries were in such agitation, the throb
  in his finger ends prevented his being able to satisfy himself as to what he
  desired to know.</p>

  <p>He could not remain longer in his present position. Judith might never
  revive. She had swooned through over-exhaustion, and nothing could restore
  her to life but the warmth and care she would receive in a house; he cursed
  his folly, his thoughtlessness, in having brought with him no flask of
  brandy. He dared remain no longer where he was, the ebbing powers in the
  feeble life might sink beyond recall.</p>

  <p>He thrust his right arm under her, and adjusted the chain about him so as
  to throw some of her weight off the arm, and then cautiously slid to the step
  below, and, holding her, set his back to the rocky wall.</p>

  <p>So, facing the Atlantic Ocean, facing the wild night sky, torn here and
  there into flakes of light, otherwise cloaked in storm-gloom, with the abyss
  below, an abyss of jagged rock and shingle shore, he began to make his way
  along the track by which he had gained that point.</p>

  <p>He was at that part where the shelf narrowed to a foot, and his safety and
  hers depended largely on the power that remained to him in his left arm. With
  the hand of that arm he felt along and clutched every projecting point of
  rock, and held to it with every sinew strained and starting. He drew a long
  breath. Was Judith stirring on his arm?</p>

  <p>The critical minute had come. The slightest movement, the least
  displacement of the balance, and both would be precipitated below.</p>

  <p>"Judith!" said he, hoarsely, turning his head toward her ear.
  "Judith!"</p>

  <p>There was no reply.</p>

  <p>"Judith! For Heaven's sake&mdash;if you hear me&mdash;do not lift a
  finger. Do not move a muscle."</p>

  <p>The same heavy weight on him without motion.</p>

  <p>"Judith! For life&mdash;or death!"</p>

  <p>Then suddenly from off the ocean flashed a tiny spark&mdash;far, far
  away.</p>

  <p>It was a signal from the Black Prince.</p>

  <p>He saw it, fixed his eyes steadily on it, and began to move sideways,
  facing the sea, his back to the rock, reaching forward with his left arm,
  holding Judith in the right.</p>

  <p>"For life!"</p>

  <p>He took one step sideways, holding with the disengaged hand to the rock.
  The bone of that arm was but just knit. Not only so, but that of the collar
  was also recently sealed up after fracture. Yet the salvation of two lives
  hung on these two infirm joints. The arm was stiff; the muscles had not
  recovered flexibility, nor the sinews their strength.</p>

  <p>"For death!"</p>

  <p>A second sidelong step, and the projected foot slid in greasy marl. He dug
  his heel into the wet and yielding soil, he stamped in it; then, throwing all
  his weight on the left heel, aided by the left arm, he drew himself along and
  planted the right beside the left.</p>

  <p>He sucked the air in between his teeth with a hiss. The soft soil was
  sinking&mdash;it would break away. The light from the Black Prince seemed to
  rise. With a wrench he planted his left foot on rock&mdash;and drew up the
  right to it.</p>

  <p>"Judith! For life!"</p>

  <p>That star on the black sea&mdash;what did it mean? He knew. His mind was
  clear, and though in intense concentration of all his powers on the effort to
  pass this strip of perilous path, he could reason of other things, and knew
  why the Black Prince had exposed her light. The lantern that he had borne,
  and left on the shelf, had been seen by her, and she supposed it to be a
  signal from the terrace over the cave.</p>

  <p>The next step was full of peril. With his left foot advanced, Coppinger
  felt he had reached the shale. He kicked into it, and kicked away an
  avalanche of loose flakes that slid over the edge. But he drove his foot deep
  into the slope, and rammed a dent into which he could fix the right foot when
  drawn after it.</p>

  <p>"For death!"</p>

  <p>Then he crept along upon the shale.</p>

  <p>He could not see the star now. His sweat, rolling off his brow, had run
  over his eyelids and charged the lashes with tears. In partial blindness he
  essayed the next step.</p>

  <p>"For life!"</p>

  <p>Then he breathed more freely. His foot was on the grass.</p>

  <p>The passage of extreme danger was over. From the point now reached the
  ledge widened, and Coppinger was able to creep onward with less stress laid
  on the fractured bones. The anguish of expectation of death was lightened;
  and as it lightened nature began to assert herself. His teeth chattered as in
  an ague fit, and his breath came in sobs.</p>

  <p>In ten minutes he had attained the summit&mdash;he was on the down above
  the cliffs.</p>

  <p>"Judith," said he, and he kissed her cheeks and brow and hair. "For
  life&mdash;for death&mdash;mine, only mine."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; UNA.</h2>

  <p class="first">When Judith opened her eyes, she found herself in a strange
  room, but as she looked about her she saw Aunt Dionysia with her hands behind
  her back looking out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Oh, aunt! Where am I!"</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa turned.</p>

  <p>"So you have come round at last, or pleased to pretend to come round. It
  is hard to tell whether or not dissimulation was here."</p>

  <p>"Dissimulation, aunt?"</p>

  <p>"There's no saying. Young folks are not what they were in my day. They
  have neither the straightforwardness nor the consideration for their elders
  and betters."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;where am I?"</p>

  <p>"At the Glaze; not where I put you, but where you have put yourself."</p>

  <p>"I did not come here, auntie, dear."</p>

  <p>"Don't auntie dear me, and deprive me of my natural sleep."</p>

  <p>"Have I?"</p>

  <p>"Have you not? Three nights have I had to sit up. And natural sleep is as
  necessary to me at my age as is stays. I fall abroad without one or the
  other. Give me my choice&mdash;whether I'd have nephews and nieces crawling
  about me or erysipelas, and I'd choose the latter."</p>

  <p>"But, aunt&mdash;I'm sorry if I am a trouble to you."</p>

  <p>"Of course you are a trouble. How can you be other? Don't burs stick? But
  that is neither here nor there."</p>

  <p>"Aunt, how came I to Pentyre Glaze!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't invite you, and I didn't bring you&mdash;you may be sure of
  that. Captain Coppinger found you somewhere on the down at night, when you
  ought to have been at home. You were insensible, or pretended to be
  so&mdash;it's not for me to say which."</p>

  <p>"Oh, aunt, I don't want to be here."</p>

  <p>"Nor do I want you here&mdash;and in my room, too. Hoity-toity! nephews
  and nieces are just like pigs&mdash;you want them to go one way and they run
  the other."</p>

  <p>"But I should like to know where Captain Coppinger found me, and all about
  it. I don't remember anything."</p>

  <p>"Then you must ask him yourself."</p>

  <p>"I should like to get up; may I?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say till the doctor comes. There's no telling&mdash;I might be
  blamed. I shall be pleased enough when you are shifted to your own room," and
  she pointed to a door.</p>

  <p>"My room, auntie?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so; I don't know whose else it is."</p>

  <p>Then Miss Trevisa whisked out of the room.</p>

  <p>Judith lay quietly in bed trying to collect her thoughts and recall
  something of what had happened. She could recollect fastening her wrist to
  the shrub by her brother's dog-chain; then, with all the vividness of a
  recurrence of the scene&mdash;the fall of the man, the stroke on her cheek,
  his roll over and plunge down the precipice. The recollection made a film
  come over her eyes and her heart stand still. After that she remembered
  nothing. She tried hard to bring to mind one single twinkle of remembrance,
  but in vain. It was like looking at a wall and straining the eyes to see
  through it.</p>

  <p>Then she raised herself in bed to look about her. She was in her aunt's
  room, and in her aunt's bed. She had been brought there by Captain Coppinger.
  He, therefore, had rescued her from the position of peril in which she had
  been. So far she could understand. She would have liked to know more, but
  more, probably, her aunt could not tell her, even if inclined to do so.</p>

  <p>Where was Jamie? Was he at Uncle Zachie's? Had he been anxious and unhappy
  about her? She hoped he had got into no trouble during the time he had been
  free from her supervision. Judith felt that she must go back to Mr. Menaida's
  and to Jamie. She could not stay at the Glaze. She could not be happy with
  her ever-grumbling, ill-tempered aunt. Besides, her father would not have
  wished her to be there.</p>

  <p>What did Aunt Dunes mean when she pointed to a door and spoke of her
  room?</p>

  <p>Judith could not judge whether she were strong till she tried her
  strength. She slipped her feet to the floor, stood up and stole over the
  floor to that door which her aunt had indicated. She timidly raised the
  latch, after listening at it, opened and peeped into a small apartment. To
  her surprise she saw the little bed she had occupied at her dear home, the
  rectory, her old wash-stand, her mirror, the old chairs, the framed pictures
  that had adorned her walls, the common and trifling ornaments that had been
  arranged on her chimney-piece. Every object with which she had been familiar
  at the parsonage for many years, and to which she had said good-by, never
  expecting to have a right to them any more&mdash;all these were there,
  furnishing the room that adjoined her aunt's apartment.</p>

  <p>She stood looking around in surprise, till she heard a step on the stair
  outside, and, supposing it was that of Aunt Dionysia, she ran back to bed,
  and dived under the clothes and pulled the sheets over her golden head.</p>

  <p>Aunt Dunes entered the room, bringing with her a bowl of soup. Her eye at
  once caught the opened door into the little adjoining chamber.</p>

  <p>"You have been out of bed!"</p>

  <p>Judith thrust her head out of its hiding-place, and said, frankly, "Yes,
  auntie! I could not help myself. I want to see. How have you managed to get
  all my things together?"</p>

  <p>"I? I have had nothing to do with it."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;who did it, auntie?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger; he was at the sale."</p>

  <p>"Is the sale over, aunt?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, whilst you have been ill."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am so glad it is over, and I knew nothing about it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, exactly! Not a thought of the worry you have been to me; deprived of
  my sleep&mdash;of my bed&mdash;of my bed," repeated Aunt Dunes, grimly. "How
  can you expect a bulb to flower if you take it out of the earth and stick it
  on a bedroom chair stirring broth? I have no patience with you young people.
  You are consumed with selfishness."</p>

  <p>"But, auntie! Don't be cross. Why did Captain Coppinger buy all my dear
  crinkum-crankums?"</p>

  <p>Aunt Dionysia snorted and tossed her head.</p>

  <p>Judith suddenly flushed; she did not repeat the question, but said
  hastily, "Auntie, I want to go back to Mr. Menaida."</p>

  <p>"You cannot desire it more than I do," said Miss Trevisa, sharply. "But
  whether <i>he</i> will let you go is another matter."</p>

  <p>"Aunt Dunes, if I want to go, I will go!"</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"I will go back as soon as ever I can."</p>

  <p>"Well, that can't be to-day, for one thing."</p>

  <p>The evening of that same day Judith was removed into the adjoining room,
  "her room," as Miss Trevisa designated it. "And mind you sleep soundly, and
  don't trouble me in the night. Natural sleep is as suitable to me as green
  peas to duck."</p>

  <p>When, next morning, the girl awoke, her eyes ranged round and lighted
  everywhere on familiar objects. The two mezzotints of Happy and Deserted
  Auburn, the old and battered pieces of Dresden ware, vases with flowers
  encrusted round them, but with most of the petals broken off&mdash;vases too
  injured to be of value to a purchaser, valuable to her because full of
  reminiscences&mdash;the tapestry firescreen, the painted fans with
  butterflies on them, the mirror blotched with damp, the inlaid wafer-box and
  ruler, the old snuffer-tray. Her eyes filled with tears. A gathering together
  into one room of old trifles did not make that strange room to be home. It
  was the father, the dear father, who, now that he was taken away, made home
  an impossibility, and the whole world, however crowded with old familiar odds
  and ends, to be desert and strange. The sight of all her old
  "crinkum-crankums," as she had called them, made Judith's heart smart. It was
  kindly meant by Coppinger to purchase all these things and collect them
  there; but it was a mistake of judgment. Grateful she was, not gratified.</p>

  <p>In the little room there was an ottoman with a woolwork cover representing
  a cluster of dark red, pink, and white roses; and at each corner of the
  ottoman was a tassel, which had been a constant source of trouble to Judith,
  as the tassels would come off, sometimes because the cat played with them,
  sometimes because Jamie pulled them off in mischief, sometimes because they
  caught in her dress. Her father had embroidered those dreadful roses on a
  buff ground one winter when confined to the house by a heavy cold and cough.
  She valued that ottoman for his sake, and would not have suffered it to go
  into the sale had she possessed any place she could regard as her own where
  to put it. She needed no such article to remind her of the dear
  father&mdash;the thought of him would be forever present to her without the
  assistance of ottomans to refresh her memory.</p>

  <p>On this ottoman, when dressed, Judith seated herself, and let her hands
  rest in her lap. She was better; she would soon be well; and when well would
  take the first opportunity to depart.</p>

  <p>The door was suddenly thrown open by her aunt, and in the doorway stood
  Coppinger looking at her. He raised his hand to his hat in salutation, but
  said nothing. She was startled and unable to speak. In another moment the
  door was shut again.</p>

  <p>That day she resolved that nothing should detain her longer than she was
  forced. Jamie&mdash;her own dear Jamie&mdash;came to see her, and the twins
  were locked in each other's arms.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ju! darling Ju! You are quite well, are you not! And Captain
  Coppinger has given me a gray donkey instead of Tib; and I'm to ride it about
  whenever I choose!"</p>

  <p>"But, dear, Mr. Menaida has no stable, and no paddock."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ju! that's nothing. I'm coming up here, and we shall be
  together&mdash;the donkey and you and me and Aunt Dunes!"</p>

  <p>"No, Jamie. Nothing of the sort. Listen to me. You remain at Mr.
  Menaida's. I am coming back."</p>

  <p>"But I've already brought up my clothes."</p>

  <p>"You take them back. Attend to me. You do not come here. I go back to Mr.
  Menaida's immediately."</p>

  <p>"But, Ju! you've got all your pretty things from the parsonage here!"</p>

  <p>"They are not mine. Mr. Coppinger bought them for himself."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;the donkey?"</p>

  <p>"Leave the donkey here. Pay attention to my words. I lay a strict command
  on you. As you love me, Jamie, do not leave Mr. Menaida's; remain there till
  my return."</p>

  <p>That night there was a good deal of noise in the house. Judith's room lay
  in a wing, nevertheless she heard the riot, for the house was not large, and
  the sounds from the hall penetrated every portion of it. She was frightened,
  and went into Miss Trevisa's room.</p>

  <p>"Aunt! what is this dreadful racket about?"</p>

  <p>"Go to sleep&mdash;you cannot have every one shut his mouth because of
  you."</p>

  <p>"But what is it, auntie!"</p>

  <p>"It is nothing but the master has folk with him, if you wish particularly
  to know. The whole cargo of the Black Prince has been run, and not a finger
  has been laid by the coast-guard on a single barrel or bale. So they are
  celebrating their success. Go to bed and sleep. It is naught to you."</p>

  <p>"I cannot sleep, aunt. They are singing now."</p>

  <p>"Why should they not; have you aught against it? You are not mistress
  here, that I am aware of."</p>

  <p>"But, auntie, are there many down-stairs?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know. It is no concern of mine&mdash;and certainly none of
  yours."</p>

  <p>Judith was silenced for a while by her aunt's ill-humor; but she did not
  return to her room. Presently she asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Are you sure, aunt, that Jamie is gone back to Polzeath?"</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa kicked the stool from under her feet, in her impatience.</p>

  <p>"Really! you drive me desperate. I did not bargain for this. Am I to tear
  over the country on post-horses to seek a nephew here and a niece there? I
  can't tell where Jamie is, and what is more, I do not care. I'll do my duty
  by you both. I'll do no more; and that has been forced on me, it was not
  sought by me. Heaven be my witness."</p>

  <p>Judith returned to her room. The hard and sour woman would afford her no
  information.</p>

  <p>In her room she threw herself on her bed and began to think. She was in
  the very home and head-quarters of contrabandism. But was smuggling a sin?
  Surely not that, or her father would have condemned it decidedly. She
  remembered his hesitation relative to it, in the last conversation they had
  together. Perhaps it was not actually a sin&mdash;she could recall no text in
  Scripture that denounced it&mdash;but it was a thing forbidden, and though
  she did not understand why it was forbidden, she considered that it could not
  be an altogether honorable and righteous traffic. Judith was unable to rest.
  It was not the noise that disturbed her so much as her uneasiness about
  Jamie. Had he obeyed her and gone back to Uncle Zachie? Or had he neglected
  her injunction, and was he in the house, was he below along with the
  revellers?</p>

  <p>She opened the door gently, and stole along the passage to the head of the
  stairs, and listened. She could smell the fumes of tobacco; but to these she
  was familiar. The atmosphere of Mr. Menaida's cottage was redolent of the
  Virginian weed. The noise was, however, something to which she was utterly
  unaccustomed: the boisterous merriment, the shouts, and occasional oaths.
  Then a fiddle was played. There was disputation, a pause, then the fiddle
  recommenced; it played a jig; there was a clatter of feet, then a roar of
  laughter&mdash;and then&mdash;she was almost sure she heard the voice of her
  brother.</p>

  <p>Regardless of herself, thinking only of him, without a moment's
  consideration, she ran down the stairs and threw open the door into the great
  kitchen or hall.</p>

  <p>It was full of men&mdash;wild, rough fellows&mdash;drinking and smoking;
  there were lights and a fire. The atmosphere was rank with spirits and
  tobacco; on a chair sat a sailor fiddling, and in the midst of the room, on a
  table, was Jamie dancing a jig, to the laughter and applause of the
  revellers.</p>

  <p>The moment Judith appeared silence ensued&mdash;the men were surprised to
  see a pale and delicate girl stand before them, with a crown of gold like a
  halo round her ivory-white face. But Judith took no notice of anyone
  there&mdash;her eyes were on her brother, and her hand raised to attract his
  attention. Judith had been in bed, but, disturbed by the uproar, had risen
  and drawn on her gown; her feet, however, were bare, and her magnificent hair
  poured over her shoulders unbound. Her whole mind, her whole care, was for
  Jamie; on herself not a thought rested; she had forgotten that she was but
  half clothed.</p>

  <p>"Jamie! Jamie!" she cried. "My brother! my brother!"</p>

  <p>The fiddler ceased, lowered his violin, and stared at her.</p>

  <p>"Ju, let me alone! It is such fun," said the boy.</p>

  <p>"Jamie! this instant you shall come with me. Get down off the table!"</p>

  <p>As he hesitated, and looked round to the men who had been applauding him
  for support against his sister, she went to the table, and caught him by the
  feet.</p>

  <p>"Jamie! in pity to me! Jamie! think&mdash;papa is but just dead."</p>

  <p>Then tears of sorrow, shame, and entreaty filled her eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, Ju! I'm not tied to your apron-strings," said the lad, disengaging
  himself.</p>

  <p>But in an instant he was caught from the table by the strong arm of
  Coppinger, and thrust toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Judith, you should not have come here."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Coppinger&mdash;and Jamie! why did you let him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Coppinger drew the girl from the room into the passage.</p>

  <p>"Judith, not for the world would I have had you here," said he, in an
  agitated voice. "I'll kill your aunt for letting you come down."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coppinger, she knew nothing of my coming. Come I must&mdash;I heard
  Jamie's voice."</p>

  <p>"Go," said the Captain, shaking the boy. He was ashamed of himself and
  angry. "Beware how you disobey your sister again."</p>

  <p>Coppinger's face was red as fire. He turned to Judith&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Your feet are bare. Let me carry you up-stairs&mdash;carry you once
  more."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "As I came down so I can return."</p>

  <p>"Will you forgive me?" he said, in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"Heaven forgive you," she answered, and burst into tears. "You will break
  my heart, I foresee it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; A GOLDFISH.</h2>

  <p class="first">Next day&mdash;just in the same way as the day
  before&mdash;when Judith was risen and dressed, the door was thrown open, and
  again Coppinger was revealed, standing outside, looking at her with a strange
  expression, and saying no word.</p>

  <p>But Judith started up from her chair and went to him in the passage, put
  forth her delicate white hand, laid it on his cuff, and said: "Mr. Coppinger,
  may I speak to you?"</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"Where you like&mdash;down-stairs will be best, in the hall if no one be
  there."</p>

  <p>"It is empty."</p>

  <p>He stood aside and allowed her to precede him.</p>

  <p>The staircase was narrow, and it would have been dark but for a small
  dormer-window through which light came from a squally sky covered with
  driving white vapors. But such light as entered from a white and wan sun fell
  on her head as she descended&mdash;that head of hair was like the splendor of
  a beech-tree touched by frost before the leaves fall.</p>

  <p>Coppinger descended after her.</p>

  <p>When they were both in the hall, he indicated his arm-chair by the hearth
  for her to sit in, and she obeyed. She was weak, and now also nervous. She
  must speak to the smuggler firmly, and that required all her courage.</p>

  <p>The room was tidy; all traces of the debauch of the preceding night had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>Coppinger stood a few paces from her. He seemed to know that what she was
  going to say would displease him, and he did not meet her clear eyes, but
  looked with a sombre frown upon the floor.</p>

  <p>Judith put the fingers of her right hand to her heart to bid it cease
  beating so fast, and then rushed into what she had to say, fearing lest delay
  should heighten the difficulty of saying it.</p>

  <p>"I am so&mdash;so thankful to you, sir, for what you have done for me. My
  aunt tells me that you found and carried me here. I had lost my way on the
  rocks, and but for you I would have died."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, raising his eyes suddenly and looking piercingly into
  hers, "but for me you would have died."</p>

  <p>"I must tell you how deeply grateful I am for this and for other
  kindnesses. I shall never forget that this foolish, silly, little life of
  mine I owe to you."</p>

  <p>Again her heart was leaping so furiously as to need the pressure of her
  fingers on it to check it.</p>

  <p>"We are quits," said Coppinger, slowly. "You came&mdash;you ran a great
  risk to save me. But for you I might be dead. So this rude and
  worthless&mdash;this evil life of mine," he held out his hands, both palms
  before her, and spoke with quivering voice&mdash;"I owe to you."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Judith, "as you say, we are quits. Yet no. If one account is
  cancelled, another remains unclosed. I threw you down and broke your bones.
  So there still remains a score against me."</p>

  <p>"That I have forgiven long ago," said he. "Throw me down, break me, kill
  me, do with me what you will&mdash;and&mdash;I will kiss your hand."</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to have my hand kissed," said Judith, hastily, "I let you
  understand that before."</p>

  <p>He put his elbow against the mantel-shelf, and leaned his brow against his
  open hand, looking down at her, so she could not see his face without raising
  her eyes, but he could rest his on her and study her, note her distress, the
  timidity with which she spoke, the wince when he said a word that implied his
  attachment to her.</p>

  <p>"I have not only to thank you, Captain Coppinger, but I have to say
  good-by."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;go?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I shall go back to Mr. Menaida to-day."</p>

  <p>He stamped, and his face became blood-red. "You shall not. I will
  it&mdash;here you stay."</p>

  <p>"It cannot be," said Judith, after a moment's pause to let his passion
  subside. "You are not my guardian, though very generously you have undertaken
  to be valuer for me in dilapidations. I must go, I and Jamie."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. He feared to speak, his anger choked him.</p>

  <p>"I cannot remain here myself, and certainly I will not let Jamie be
  here."</p>

  <p>"Is it because of last night's foolery you say that?"</p>

  <p>"I am responsible for my brother. He is not very clever; he is easily led
  astray. There is no one to think for him, to care for him, but myself. I
  could never let him run the risk of such a thing happening again."</p>

  <p>"Confound the boy!" burst forth Coppinger. "Are you going to bring him up
  as a milk-sop? You are wrong altogether in the way you manage him."</p>

  <p>"I can but follow my conscience."</p>

  <p>"And is it because of him that you go?"</p>

  <p>"Not because of him only."</p>

  <p>"But I have spoken to your aunt; she consents."</p>

  <p>"But I do not," said Judith.</p>

  <p>He stamped again, passionately.</p>

  <p>"I am not the man who will bear to be disobeyed and my will crossed. I
  say&mdash;Here you shall stay."</p>

  <p>Judith waited a moment, looking at him steadily out of her clear,
  glittering iridescent eyes, and said slowly, "I am not the girl to be obliged
  to stay where my common-sense and my heart say Stay not."</p>

  <p>He folded his arms, lowered his chin on his breast, and strode up and down
  the room. Then, suddenly, he stood still opposite her and asked, in a
  threatening tone:</p>

  <p>"Do you not like your room? Does that not please your humor?"</p>

  <p>"It has been most kind of you to collect all my little bits of rubbish
  there. I feel how good you have been, how full of thought for me; but, for
  all that, I cannot stay."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"I have said, on one account, because of Jamie."</p>

  <p>He bit his lips&mdash;"I hate that boy."</p>

  <p>"Then most certainly he cannot be here. He must be with those who love
  him."</p>

  <p>"Then stay."</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;I will not. I have a will as well as you. My dear papa
  always said that my will was strong."</p>

  <p>"You are the only person who has ever dared to resist me."</p>

  <p>"That may be; I am daring&mdash;because you have been kind."</p>

  <p>"Kind to you. Yes&mdash;to you only."</p>

  <p>"It may be so, and because kind to me, and me only, I, and I only, presume
  to say No when you say Yes."</p>

  <p>He came again to the fireplace and again leaned against the mantel-shelf.
  He was trembling with passion.</p>

  <p>"And what if I say that, if you go, I will turn old Dunes&mdash;I mean
  your aunt&mdash;out of the house?"</p>

  <p>"You will not say it, Mr. Coppinger; you are too noble, too generous, to
  take a mean revenge."</p>

  <p>"Oh! you allow there is some good in me?"</p>

  <p>"I thankfully and cheerfully protest there is a great deal of good in
  you&mdash;and I would there were more."</p>

  <p>"Come&mdash;stay here and teach me to be good&mdash;be my crutch; I will
  lean on you, and you shall help me along the right way."</p>

  <p>"You are too great a weight, Mr. Coppinger," said she, smiling&mdash;but
  it was a frightened and a forced smile. "You would bend and break the little
  crutch."</p>

  <p>He heaved a long breath. He was looking at her from under his hand and his
  bent brows.</p>

  <p>"You are cruel&mdash;to deny me a chance. And what if I were to say that I
  am hungry, sick at heart, and faint. Would you turn your back and leave
  me?"</p>

  <p>"No, assuredly not."</p>

  <p>"I am hungry."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him, and was frightened by the glitter in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am hungry for the sight of you, for the sound of your voice."</p>

  <p>She did not say anything to this, but sat, with her hands on her lap,
  musing, uncertain how to deal with this man, so strange, impulsive, and yet
  so submissive to her, and even appealing to her pity.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coppinger, I have to think of and care for Jamie, and he takes up all
  my thoughts and engrosses all my time."</p>

  <p>"Jamie, again!"</p>

  <p>"So that I cannot feed and teach another orphan."</p>

  <p>"Put off your departure&mdash;a week. Grant me that. Then you will have
  time to get quite strong, and also you will be able to see whether it is not
  possible for you to live here. Here is your aunt&mdash;it is natural and
  right that you should be with her. She has been made your guardian by your
  father. Do you not bow to his directions."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coppinger, I cannot stay here."</p>

  <p>"I am at a disadvantage," he exclaimed. "Man always is when carrying on a
  contest with a woman. Stay&mdash;stay here and listen to me." He put out his
  hand and pressed her back into the chair, for she was about to rise. "Listen
  to what I say. You do not know&mdash;you cannot know&mdash;how near death you
  and I&mdash;yes, you and I were, chained together." His deep voice shook.
  "You and I were on the face of the cliff. There was but one little strip, the
  width of my hand"&mdash;he held out his palm before her&mdash;"and that was
  not secure. It was sliding away under my feet. Below was death, certain
  death&mdash;a wretched death. I held you. That little chain tied us
  two&mdash;us two together. All your life and mine hung on was my broken arm
  and broken collar-bone. I held you to me with my right arm and the chain. I
  did not think we should live. I thought that together&mdash;chained together,
  I holding you&mdash;so we would die&mdash;so we would be found&mdash;and my
  only care, my only prayer was, if so, that so we might be washed to sea and
  sink together, I holding you and chained to you, and you to me. I prayed that
  we might never be found; for I thought if rude hands were laid on us that the
  chain would be unloosed, my arm unlocked from about you, and that we should
  be carried to separate graves. I could not endure that thought. Let us go
  down together&mdash;bound, clasped together&mdash;into the depths of the deep
  sea, and there rest. But it was not to be so. I carried you over that stage
  of infinite danger. An angel or a devil&mdash;I cannot say which&mdash;held
  me up. And then I swore that never in life should you be loosed from me, as I
  trusted that in death we should have remained bound together. See!" He put
  his hand to her head and drew a lock of her golden hair and wound it about
  his hand and arm. "You have me fast now&mdash;fast in a chain of
  gold&mdash;of gold infinitely precious to me&mdash;infinitely
  strong&mdash;and you will cast me off, who never thought to cast you off when
  tied to you with a chain of iron. What say you? Will you stand in safety on
  your cliff of pride and integrity and unloose the golden band and say, 'Go
  down&mdash;down. I know nothing in you to love. You are naught to me but a
  robber, a wrecker, a drunkard, a murderer&mdash;go down into Hell?'"</p>

  <p>In his quivering excitement he acted the whole scene, unconscious that he
  was so doing, and the drops of agony stood on his brow and
  rolled&mdash;drip&mdash;drip&mdash;drip from it. Man does not weep; his tears
  exude more bitter than those that flow from the eyes, and they distil from
  his pores.</p>

  <p>Judith was awed by the intensity of passion in the man, but not changed in
  her purpose. His vehemence reacted on her, calming her, giving her
  determination to finish the scene decisively and finally.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coppinger," she said, looking up to him, who still held her by the
  hair wound about his hand and arm, "it is you who hold me in chains, not I
  you. And so I&mdash;your prisoner&mdash;must address a gaoler. Am I to speak
  in chains, or will you release me?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, and clenched his hand on the gold hair.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said she, "so it must be; I, bound, plead my cause with
  you&mdash;at a disadvantage. This is what I must say at the risk of hurting
  you; and, Heaven be my witness, I would not wound one who has been so good to
  me&mdash;one to whom I owe my life, my power now to speak and entreat." She
  paused a minute to gain breath and strengthen herself for what she had to
  say.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coppinger&mdash;do you not yourself see that it is quite impossible
  that I should remain in this house&mdash;that I should have anything more to
  do with you? Consider how I have been brought up&mdash;what my thoughts have
  been. I have had, from earliest childhood, my dear papa's example and
  teachings, sinking into my heart till they have colored my very life-blood.
  My little world and your great one are quite different. What I love and care
  for is folly to you, and your pursuits and pleasures are repugnant to me. You
  are an eagle&mdash;a bird of prey."</p>

  <p>"A bird of prey," repeated Coppinger.</p>

  <p>"And you soar and fight, and dive, and rend in your own element; whereas I
  am a little silver trout&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No"&mdash;he drew up his arm wound round with her hair&mdash;"No&mdash;a
  goldfish."</p>

  <p>"Well, so be it; a goldfish swimming in my own crystal element, and happy
  in it. You would not take me out of it to gasp and die. Trust me, Captain
  Coppinger, I could not&mdash;even if I would&mdash;live in your world."</p>

  <p>She put up her hands to his arm and drew some of the hair through his
  fingers, and unwound it from his sleeve. He made no resistance. He watched
  her, in a dream. He had heard every word she had said, and he knew that she
  spoke the truth. They belonged to different realms of thought and sensation.
  He could not breathe&mdash;he would stifle&mdash;in hers, and it was
  possible&mdash;it was certain&mdash;that she could not endure the strong,
  rough quality of his.</p>

  <p>Her delicate fingers touched his hand, and sent a spasm to his heart. She
  was drawing away another strand of hair, and untwisting it from about his
  arm, passing the wavy, fire-gold from one hand to the other. And as every
  strand was taken off, so went light and hope from him, and despair settled
  down on his dark spirit.</p>

  <p>He was thinking whether it would not have been better to have thrown
  himself down when he had her in his arms, and bound to him by the chain.</p>

  <p>Then he laughed.</p>

  <p>She looked up, and caught his wild eye. There was a timid inquiry in her
  look, and he answered it.</p>

  <p>"You may unwind your hair from my arm, but it is woven round and round my
  heart, and you cannot loose it thence."</p>

  <p>She drew another strand away, and released that also from his arm. There
  remained now but one red-gold band of hair fastening her to him. He looked
  entreatingly at her, and then at the hair.</p>

  <p>"It must indeed be so," she said, and released herself wholly.</p>

  <p>Then she stood up, a little timidly, for she could not trust him in his
  passion and his despair. But he did not stir; he looked at her with fixed,
  dreamy eyes. She left her place, and moved toward the door. She had gone
  forth from Mr. Menaida's without hat or other cover for her head than the
  cloak with its hood, and that she had lost. She must return bare-headed. She
  had reached the door; and there she waved him a farewell.</p>

  <p>"Goldfish!" he cried.</p>

  <p>She halted.</p>

  <p>"Goldfish, come here; one&mdash;one word only."</p>

  <p>She hesitated whether to yield. The man was dangerous. But she considered
  that with a few strides he might overtake her if she tried to escape.
  Therefore she returned toward him, but came not near enough for him to touch
  her.</p>

  <p>"Hearken to me," said he. "It may be as you say. It is as you say. You
  have your world; I have mine. You could not live in mine, nor I in yours."
  But his voice thrilled. "Swear to me&mdash;swear to me now&mdash;that while I
  live no other shall hold you, as I would have held you, to his side; that no
  other shall take your hair and wind it round him, as I have&mdash;I could not
  endure that. Will you swear to me that?&mdash;and you shall go."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I will; indeed, indeed I will."</p>

  <p>"Beware how you break this oath. Let him beware who dares to seek you." He
  was silent, looking on the ground, his arms folded. So he stood for some
  minutes, lost in thought. Then suddenly he cried out, "Goldfish!"</p>

  <p>He had found a single hair, long&mdash;a yard long&mdash;of the most
  intense red-gold, lustrous as a cloud in the west over the sunken sun. It had
  been left about his arm and hand.</p>

  <p>"Goldfish!"</p>

  <p>But she was gone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; BOUGHT AND SOLD.</h2>

  <p class="first">Cruel Coppinger remained brooding in the place where he had
  been standing, and as he stood there his face darkened. He was a man of
  imperious will and violent passions; a man unwont to curb himself; accustomed
  to sweep out of his path whoever or whatever stood between him and the
  accomplishment of his purpose; a man who never asked himself whether that
  purpose were good or bad. He had succumbed, in a manner strange and
  surprising to himself, to the influence of Judith&mdash;a sort of witchery
  over him that subdued his violence and awed him into gentleness and modesty.
  But when her presence was withdrawn the revolt of the man's lawless nature
  began. Who was this who had dared to oppose her will to his? a mere child of
  eighteen. Women were ever said to be a perverse generation, and loved to
  domineer over men; and man was weak to suffer it. So thinking, chafing, he
  had worked himself into a simmering rage when Miss Trevisa entered the hall,
  believing it to be empty. Seeing him, she was about to withdraw, when he
  shouted to her to stay.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon for intruding, sir; I am in quest of my niece. Those
  children keep me in a whirl like a teetotum."</p>

  <p>"Your niece is gone."</p>

  <p>"Gone! where to?"</p>

  <p>"Back&mdash;I suppose to that old fool, Menaida. He is meet to be a
  companion for her and that idiot, her brother; not I&mdash;I am to be spurned
  from her presence."</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa was surprised, but she said nothing. She knew his moods.</p>

  <p>"Stand there, Mother Dunes!" said Coppinger, in his anger and humiliation,
  glad to have some one on whom he could pour out the lava that boiled up in
  his burning breast. "Listen to me. She has told me that we belong to
  different worlds&mdash;she and I&mdash;and to different races, kinds of
  being, and that there can be no fellowship betwixt us. Where I am she will
  not be. Between me and you there is a great gulf fixed&mdash;see you? and I
  am as Dives tormented in my flame, and she stands yonder, serene, in cold and
  complacent blessedness, and will not cross to me with her finger dipped in
  cold water to cool my tongue; and as for my coming near to her"&mdash;he
  laughed fiercely&mdash;"that can never be."</p>

  <p>"Did she say all that?" asked Miss Trevisa.</p>

  <p>"She looked it; she implied it, if she did not say it in these naked
  words. And, what is more," shouted he, coming before Aunt Dionysia,
  threateningly, so that she recoiled, "it is true. When she sat there in
  yonder chair, and I stood here by this hearthstone, and she spoke, I knew it
  was true; I saw it all&mdash;the great gulf unspanned by any bridge. I knew
  that none could ever bridge it, and there we were, apart for ever, I in my
  fire burning, she in Blessedness&mdash;indifferent."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," said Miss Trevisa, "that Judith should so have
  misconducted herself. My brother brought her up in a manner to my mind, most
  improper for a young girl. He made her read Rollin's 'Ancient History,' and
  Blair's 'Chronological Tables,' and really upon my word, I cannot say what
  else."</p>

  <p>"I do not care how it was," said Coppinger. "But here stands the
  gulf."</p>

  <p>"Rollin is in sixteen octavo volumes," said Aunt Dionysia; "and they are
  thick also."</p>

  <p>Coppinger strode about the room, with his hands in his deep coat pockets,
  his head down.</p>

  <p>"My dear brother," continued Miss Trevisa, apologetically, "made of Judith
  his daily companion, told her all he thought, asked her opinion, as though
  she were a full-grown woman, and one whose opinion was worth having, whereas
  he never consulted me, never cared to talk to me about anything, and the
  consequence is the child has grown up without that respect for her elders and
  betters, and that deference for the male sex which the male sex expects. I am
  sure when I was a girl, and of her age, I was very different, very different
  indeed."</p>

  <p>"Of that I have not the smallest doubt," sneered Coppinger. "But never
  mind about yourself. It is of her I am speaking. She is gone, has left me,
  and I cannot endure it. I cannot endure it," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Aunt Dionysia, "you must excuse me saying it,
  Captain Coppinger, but you place me in a difficult position. I am the
  guardian of my niece, though, goodness knows, I never desired it, and I don't
  know what to think. It is very flattering and kind, and I esteem it great
  goodness in you to speak of Judith with such warmth, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Goodness! kindness!" exclaimed Coppinger. "I am good and kind to her! She
  forced me to it. I can be nothing else, and she throws me at her feet and
  tramples on me."</p>

  <p>"I am sure your sentiments, sir, are&mdash;are estimable; but, feeling as
  you seem to imply toward Judith, I hardly know what to say. Bless me! what a
  scourge to my shoulders these children are: nettles stinging and blistering
  my skin, and not allowing me a moment's peace!"</p>

  <p>"I imply nothing," said Coppinger. "I speak out direct and plain what I
  mean. I love her. She has taken me, she turns me about, she gets my heart
  between her little hands and tortures it."</p>

  <p>"Then surely, Captain, you cannot ask me to let her be here. You are most
  kind to express yourself in this manner about the pert hussy, but, as she is
  my niece, and I am responsible for her, I must do my duty by her, and not
  expose her to be&mdash;talked about. Bless me!" gasped Aunt Dunes, "when I
  was her age I never would have put myself into such a position as to worry my
  aunt out of her seven senses, and bring her nigh to distraction."</p>

  <p>"I will marry her, and make her mistress of my house and all I have," said
  Coppinger.</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa slightly courtesied, then said, "I am sure you are
  over-indulgent, but what is to become of me? I have no doubt it will be very
  comfortable and acceptable to Judith to hear this, but&mdash;what is to
  become of me? It would not be very delightful for me to be housekeeper here
  under my own niece, a pert, insolent, capricious hussy. You can see at once,
  Captain Coppinger, that I cannot consent to that."</p>

  <p>The woman had the shrewdness to know that she could be useful to
  Coppinger, and the selfishness that induced her to make terms with him to
  secure her own future, and to show him that she could stand in his way till
  he yielded to them.</p>

  <p>"I never asked to have these children thrust down my throat, like the
  fish-bone that strangled Lady Godiva&mdash;no, who was it? Earl Godiva; but I
  thank my stars I never waded through Rollin, and most certainly kept my hands
  off Blair. Of course, Captain Coppinger, it is right and proper of you to
  address yourself to me, as the guardian of my niece, before speaking to
  her."</p>

  <p>"I have spoken to her and she spurns me."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, because you spoke to her before addressing me on the subject.
  My dear brother&mdash;I will do him this justice&mdash;was very emphatic on
  this point. But you see, sir, my consent can never be given."</p>

  <p>"I do not ask your consent."</p>

  <p>"Judith will never take you without it."</p>

  <p>"Consent or no consent," said Coppinger, "that is a secondary matter. The
  first is, she does not like me, whereas I&mdash;I love her. I never loved a
  woman before. I knew not what love was. I laughed at the fools, as I took
  them to be, who sold themselves into the hands of women; but now, I cannot
  live without her. I can think of nothing but her all day. I am in a fever,
  and cannot sleep at night&mdash;all because she is tormenting me."</p>

  <p>All at once, exhausted by his passion, desperate at seeing no chance of
  success, angry at being flouted by a child, he threw himself into the chair,
  and settled his chin on his breast, and folded his arms.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said he. "Tell me what is my way out of this."</p>

  <p>"You cannot expect my help or my advice, Captain, so as to forward what
  would be most unsatisfactory to me."</p>

  <p>"What! do you grudge her to me?"</p>

  <p>"Not that; but, if she were here, what would become of me? Should I be
  turned out into the cold at my age by this red-headed hussy, to find a home
  for myself with strangers? Here I never would abide with her as mistress,
  never."</p>

  <p>"I care naught about you."</p>

  <p>"No, of that I am aware, to my regret, sir; but that makes it all the more
  necessary for me to take care for myself."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Coppinger, "I must buy you. Is your aid worth it? Will she
  listen to you?"</p>

  <p>"I can make her listen to me," said Aunt Dunes, "if it be worth my while.
  At my age, having roughed it, having no friends, I must think of myself and
  provide for the future, when I shall be too old to work."</p>

  <p>"Name your price."</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa did not answer for a while; she was considering the terms she
  would make. To her coarse and soured mind there was nothing to scruple at in
  aiding Coppinger in his suit. The Trevisas were of a fine old Cornish stock,
  but then Judith took after her mother, the poor Scottish governess, and Aunt
  Dunes did not feel toward her as though she were of her own kin. The girl
  looked like her mother. She had no right, in Miss Trevisa's eyes, to bear the
  name of her father, for her father ought to have known better than stoop to
  marry a beggarly, outlandish governess. Not very logical reasoning, but what
  woman, where her feelings are engaged, does reason logically? Aunt Dunes had
  never loved her niece; she felt an inner repulsion, such as sprang from
  encountering a nature superior, purer, more refined than her own, and the
  mortification of being forced to admit to herself that it was so. Judith,
  moreover, was costing her money, and Miss Trevisa parted with her hard-earned
  savings as reluctantly as with her heart's blood. She begrudged the girl and
  her brother every penny she was forced, or believed she would be forced, to
  expend upon them. And was she doing the girl an injury in helping her to a
  marriage that would assure her a home and a comfortable income?</p>

  <p>Aunt Dionysia knew well enough that things went on in Pentyre Glaze that
  were not to be justified, that Coppinger's mode of life was not one
  calculated to make a girl of Judith's temperament happy,
  but&mdash;"Hoity-toity!" said Miss Trevisa to herself, "if girls marry, they
  must take men as they find them. Beggars must not be choosers. You must not
  look a gift horse in the mouth. No trout can be eaten apart from its bones,
  nor a rose plucked that is free from thorns." She herself had accommodated
  herself to the ways of the house, to the moods and manners of Coppinger; and
  if she could do that, so could a mongrel Trevisa. What was good enough for
  herself was over-good for Judith.</p>

  <p>She had been saddled with these children, much against her wishes, and if
  she shifted the saddle to the shoulders of one willing to bear it, why not?
  She had duties to perform to her own self as well as to those thrust on her
  by the dead hand of that weak, that inconsiderate brother of hers, Peter
  Trevisa.</p>

  <p>Would her brother have approved of her forwarding this union? That was a
  question that did not trouble her much. Peter did what he thought best for
  his daughter when he was alive, stuffing her head with Rollin and Blair, and
  now that he was gone, she must do the best she could for her, and here was a
  chance offered that she would be a fool not to snap at.</p>

  <p>Nor did she concern herself greatly whether Judith's happiness were at
  stake. Hoity-toity! girls' happiness! They are bound to make themselves happy
  when they find themselves. The world was not made to fit them, but they to
  accommodate themselves to the places in which they found themselves in the
  world.</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa had for some days seen the direction matters were taking, she
  had seen clearly enough the infatuation&mdash;yes, infatuation she said it
  was&mdash;that had possessed Coppinger. What he could see in the girl passed
  her wits to discover. To her, Judith was an odious little minx&mdash;very
  like her mother. Miss Trevisa, therefore, had had time to weigh the
  advantages and the disadvantages that might spring to her, should Coppinger
  persist in his suit and succeed; and she had considered whether it would be
  worth her while to help or to hinder his suit.</p>

  <p>"You put things," said Aunt Dionysia, "in a blunt and a discourteous
  manner, such as might offend a lady of delicacy, like myself, who am in
  delicacy a perfect guava jelly; but, Captain, I know your ways, as I ought
  to, having been an inmate of this house for many years. It is no case of
  buying and selling, as you insinuate, but the case is plainly this: I know
  the advantage it will be to my niece to be comfortably provided for. She and
  Jamie have between them but about a thousand pounds, a sum to starve, and not
  to live, upon. They have no home and no relative in the world but myself, who
  am incapable of giving them a home and of doing anything for them except at
  an excruciating sacrifice. If Judith be found, through your offer, a home,
  then Jamie also is provided for."</p>

  <p>He said nothing to this, but moved his feet impatiently. She went on: "The
  boy <i>must</i> be provided for. And if Judith become your wife, not only
  will it be proper for you to see that he is so, but Judith will give neither
  you nor me our natural rest until the boy is comfortable and happy."</p>

  <p>"Confound the boy!"</p>

  <p>"It is all very well to say that, but he who would have anything to say to
  Judith must reckon to have to consider Jamie also. They are inseparable. Now,
  I assume that by Judith's marriage Jamie is cared for. But how about myself?
  Is every one to lie in clover and I in stubble? Am I to rack my brains to
  find a home for my nephew and niece, only that I may be thrust out myself? To
  find for them places at your table, that I may be deprived of a crust and a
  bone under it? If no one else will consider me, I must consider myself. I am
  the last representative of an ancient and honorable family&mdash;" She saw
  Coppinger move his hand, and thought he expressed dissent. She added hastily,
  "As to Judith and Jamie, they take after their Scotch mother. I do not reckon
  them as Trevisas."</p>

  <p>"Come&mdash;tell me what you want," said Coppinger, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I want to be secure for my old age, that I do not spend it in the
  poor-house."</p>

  <p>"What do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Give me an annuity of fifty pounds for my life, and Othello Cottage that
  is on your land."</p>

  <p>"You ask enough."</p>

  <p>"You will never get Judith without granting me that."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;get Judith to be mine, and you shall have it."</p>

  <p>"Will you swear to it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And give me&mdash;I desire that&mdash;the promise in writing."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it."</p>

  <p>"Then I will help you."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me. I am her guardian."</p>

  <p>"But not of her heart?"</p>

  <p>"Leave her to me. You shall win her."</p>

  <p>"How!"</p>

  <p>"Through Jamie."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; OTHELLO COTTAGE.</h2>

  <p class="first">To revert to the old life as far as possible under changed
  circumstances, to pass a sponge over a terrible succession of pictures, to
  brush out the vision of horrors from her eyes, and shake the burden of the
  past off her head&mdash;if for a while only&mdash;was a joy to Judith. She
  had been oppressed with nightmare, and now the night was over, her brain
  clear, and should forget its dreams.</p>

  <p>She and Jamie were together, and were children once more; her anxiety for
  her brother was allayed, and she had broken finally with Cruel Coppinger. Her
  heart bounded with relief. Jamie was simple and docile as of old; and she
  rambled with him through the lanes, along the shore, upon the downs, avoiding
  only one tract of common and one cove.</p>

  <p>A child's heart is elastic; eternal droopings it cannot bear. Beaten down,
  bruised and draggled by the storm, it springs up when the sun shines, and
  laughs into flower. It is no eucalyptus that ever hangs its leaves; it is a
  sensitive plant, wincing, closing, at a trifle, feeling acutely, but not for
  long.</p>

  <p>And now Judith had got an idea into her head, that she communicated to
  Jamie, and her sanguine anticipations kindled his torpid mind. She had
  resolved to make little shell baskets and other chimney ornaments, not out of
  the marine shells cast up by the sea, for on that coast none came ashore
  whole, but out of the myriad snail-shells that strew the downs. They were of
  all sizes, from a pin's head to a gooseberry, and of various
  colors&mdash;salmon-pink, sulphur-yellow, rich brown and pure white. By
  judicious arrangement of sizes and of colors, with a little gum on cardboard,
  what wonderful erections might be made, certain to charm the money out of the
  pocket, and bring in a little fortune to the twins.</p>

  <p>"And then," said Jamie, "I can build a linney, and rent a paddock, and
  keep my Neddy at Polzeath."</p>

  <p>"And," said Judith, "we need be no longer a burden to Auntie."</p>

  <p>The climax of constructive genius would be exhibited in the formation of a
  shepherd and shepherdess, for which Judith was to paint faces and hands; but
  their hats, their garments, their shoes, were to be made of shells. The
  shepherdess was to have a basket on her arm, and in this basket were to be
  flowers, not made out of complete shells, but out of particles of sea-shells
  of rainbow colors.</p>

  <p>What laughter, what exultation there was over the shepherd and
  shepherdess! How in imagination they surpassed the fascinations of Dresden
  china figures. And the price at which they were to be sold was settled.
  Nothing under a pound would be accepted, and that would be inadequate to
  represent the value of such a monument of skill and patience! The shepherd
  and shepherdess would have to be kept under glass bells, on a drawing-room
  mantel-shelf.</p>

  <p>Judith's life had hitherto been passed between her thoughtful, cultured
  father and her thoughtless, infantile brother. In some particulars she was
  old for her age, but in others she was younger than her years. As the
  companion of her father, she had gained powers of reasoning, a calmness in
  judging, and a shrewdness of sense which is unusual in a girl of eighteen.
  But as also the associate of Jamie in his play, she had a childish delight in
  the simplest amusements, and a readiness to shake off all serious thought and
  fretting care in an instant, and to accommodate herself to the simplicity of
  her brother.</p>

  <p>Thus&mdash;a child with a child&mdash;Judith and Jamie were on the common
  one windy, showery day, collecting shells, laughing, chattering, rejoicing
  over choice snail-shells, as though neither had passed through a wave of
  trouble, as though life lay serene before them.</p>

  <p>Judith had no experience of the world. With her natural wit and feminine
  instinct she had discovered that Cruel Coppinger loved her. She had also no
  hesitation in deciding that he must be repulsed. Should he seek her, she must
  avoid him. They could not possibly unite their lives. She had told him this,
  and there the matter ended. He must swallow his disappointment, and think no
  more about her. No one could have everything he wanted. Other people had to
  put up with rejection, why not Coppinger? It might be salutary to him to find
  that he could not have his way in all things. So she argued, and then she put
  aside from her all thought of the Captain, and gave herself up to
  consideration of snail-shell boxes, baskets, and shepherds and
  shepherdesses.</p>

  <p>Jamie was developing a marvellous aptitude for bird-stuffing. Mr. Menaida
  had told Judith repeatedly that if the boy would stick to it, he might become
  as skilful as himself. He would be most happy, thankful to be able to pass
  over to him some of the work that accumulated, and which he could not
  execute. "I am not a professional; I am an amateur. I only stuff birds to
  amuse my leisure moments. Provokingly enough, gentlemen do not believe this.
  They write to me as if I were a tradesman, laying their commands upon me, and
  I resent it. I have a small income of my own, and am not forced to slave for
  my bread and 'baccy. Now, if Jamie will work with me and help me, I will
  cheerfully share profits with him. I must be director&mdash;that is
  understood."</p>

  <p>But it was very doubtful whether poor Jamie could be taught to apply
  himself regularly to the work, and that under a desultory master, who could
  not himself remain at a task many minutes without becoming exhausted and
  abandoning it. Jamie could be induced to work only by being humored. He loved
  praise. He must be coaxed and flattered to undertake any task that gave
  trouble. Fortunately, taxidermy did not require any mental effort, and it was
  the straining of his imperfect mental powers that irritated and exhausted the
  boy.</p>

  <p>With a little cajolery he might be got to do as much as did Uncle Zachie,
  and if Mr. Menaida were as good as his word&mdash;and there could be little
  doubt that so kind, amiable, and honorable a man would be that&mdash;Jamie
  would really earn a good deal of money. Judith also hoped to earn more with
  her shell-work, and together she trusted they would be able to support
  themselves without further tax on Miss Trevisa.</p>

  <p>And what a childish pleasure they found in scheming their future, what
  they would do with their money, where they would take a house, how furnish
  it! They laughed over their schemes, and their pulses fluttered at the
  delightful pictures they conjured up. And all their rosy paradise was to rise
  out of the proceeds of stuffed birds and snail-shell chimney ornaments.</p>

  <p>"Ju! come here, Ju!" cried Jamie.</p>

  <p>Then again impatiently, "Ju! come here, Ju!"</p>

  <p>"What is it, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Here is the very house for us. Do come and see."</p>

  <p>On the down, nestled against a wall that had once enclosed a garden, but
  was now ruinous, stood a cottage. It was built of wreck-timber, thatched with
  heather and bracken, and with stones laid on the thatching, which was bound
  with ropes, as protection against the wind. A quaint, small house, with
  little windows under the low eaves; one story high, the window-frames painted
  white; the glass frosted with salt blown from the sea, so that it was
  impossible to look through the small panes, and discover what was within. The
  door had a gable over it, and the centre of the gable was occupied by a
  figure-head of Othello. The Moor of Venice was black and well battered by
  storm, so that the paint was washed and bitten off him. There was a strong
  brick chimney in the midst of the roof, but no smoke issued from it, nor had
  the house the appearance of being inhabited. There were no blinds to the
  windows, there were no crocks, no drying linen about the house; it had a
  deserted look, and yet was in good repair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ju!" said Jamie, "we will live here. Will it not be fun? And I shall
  have a gun and shoot birds."</p>

  <p>"Whose house can it be?" asked Judith.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Ju, the door is open; shall we go in?"</p>

  <p>"No, Jamie, we have no right there."</p>

  <p>A little gate was in the wall, and Judith looked through. There had at one
  time certainly been a garden there, but it had been neglected, and allowed to
  be overrun with weeds. Roses, escallonica, and lavender had grown in
  untrimmed luxuriance. Marigolds rioted over the space like a weed. Pinks
  flourished, loving the sandy soil, but here and there the rude blue thistle
  had intruded and asserted its right to the sea-border land as its indigenous
  home.</p>

  <p>Down came the rain, so lashing that Judith was constrained to seek
  shelter, and, in spite of her protest that she had no right to enter Othello
  Cottage, she passed the threshold.</p>

  <p>No one was within but Jamie, who had not attended to her objection; led by
  curiosity, and excusing himself by the rain, he had opened the door and gone
  inside.</p>

  <p>The house was unoccupied, and yet was not in a condition of neglect and
  decay. If no one lived there, yet certainly some one visited it, for it had
  not that mouldy atmosphere that pervades a house long shut up, nor were dust
  and sand deep on floor and table. There was furniture, though scanty. The
  hearth showed traces of having had a fire in it at no very distant period.
  There were benches. There were even tinder-box and candle on the
  mantle-shelf.</p>

  <p>Jamie was in high excitement and delight. This was the ogre's cottage to
  which Jack had climbed up the bean-stalk. He was sure to find somewhere the
  hen that laid golden eggs, and the harp that played of itself.</p>

  <p>Judith seated herself on one of the benches and sorted her shells, leaving
  Jamie to amuse himself. As the house was uninhabited, it did not seem to her
  that any gross impropriety existed in allowing him to run in and out and peep
  round the rooms, and into the corners.</p>

  <p>"Judith," he exclaimed, coming to her from an adjoining room, "there is a
  bed in here, and there are crooks in the wall!"</p>

  <p>"What are the crooks for, dear?"</p>

  <p>"For climbing, I think."</p>

  <p>Then he ran back, and she saw no more of him for a while, but heard him
  scrambling.</p>

  <p>She rose and went to the door into the adjoining apartment to see that he
  was after no mischief. She found that this apartment was intended for
  sleeping in. There was a bedstead with a mattress on it, but no clothes.
  Jamie had found some crooks in the wall, and was scrambling up these, with
  hands and feet, toward the ceiling, where she perceived an opening,
  apparently into the attic.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jamie! what are you doing there?"</p>

  <p>"Ju, I want to see whether there is anything between the roof and the
  ceiling. There may be the harp there, or the hen that lays golden eggs."</p>

  <p>"The shower is nearly over; I shall not wait for you."</p>

  <p>She seated herself on the bed and watched him. He thrust open a sliding
  board, and crawled through into the attic. He would soon tire of exploring
  among the rafters, and would return dirty, and have to be cleared of cobwebs
  and dust. But it amused the boy. He was ever restless, and she would find it
  difficult to keep him occupied sitting by her below till the rain ceased, so
  she allowed him to scramble and search as he pleased. Very few minutes had
  passed before Judith heard a short cough in the main room, and she at once
  rose and stepped back into it to apologize for her intrusion. To her great
  surprise she found her aunt there, at the little window, measuring it.</p>

  <p>"A couple of yards will do&mdash;double width," said Miss Trevisa.</p>

  <p>"Auntie!" exclaimed Judith. "Who ever would have thought of seeing you
  here?"</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa turned sharply round, and her lips tightened.</p>

  <p>"And who would have thought of seeing you here," she answered, curtly.</p>

  <p>"Auntie, the rain came on; I ran in here so as not to be wet through. To
  whom does this house belong?"</p>

  <p>"To the master&mdash;to whom else? Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"Are you measuring the window for blinds for him?"</p>

  <p>"I am measuring for blinds, but not for him."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;who lives here?"</p>

  <p>"No one as yet."</p>

  <p>"Is any one coming to live here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I am."</p>

  <p>"Oh, auntie! and are we to come here with you?"</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa snorted, and stiffened her back.</p>

  <p>"Are you out of your senses, like Jamie, to ask such a question? What is
  the accommodation here? Two little bedrooms, one large kitchen, and a lean-to
  for scullery&mdash;that is all&mdash;a fine roomy mansion for three people
  indeed!"</p>

  <p>"But, auntie, are you leaving the Glaze?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am. Have you any objection to that?"</p>

  <p>"No, aunt, only I am surprised. And Captain Cruel lets you have this dear
  little cottage?"</p>

  <p>"As to its being dear, I don't know, I am to have it; and that is how you
  have found it open to poke and pry into. I came up to look round and about
  me, and then found I had not brought my measuring tape with me, so I returned
  home for that, and you found the door open and thrust yourself in."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry if I have given you annoyance."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's no annoyance to me. The place is not mine yet."</p>

  <p>"But when do you come here, Aunt Dunes?"</p>

  <p>"When?" Miss Trevisa looked at her niece with a peculiar expression in her
  hard face that Judith noticed, but could not interpret. "That," said Miss
  Trevisa, "I do not know yet."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you will do up that dear little garden," said Judith.</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa did not vouchsafe an answer; she grunted, and resumed her
  measuring.</p>

  <p>"Has this cottage been vacant for long, auntie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But, auntie, some one comes here. It is not quite deserted."</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa said to herself, "Four times two and one breadth torn in half
  to allow for folds will do it. Four times two is eight, and one breadth more
  is ten."</p>

  <p>Just then Jamie appeared, shyly peeping through the door. He had heard his
  aunt's voice, and was afraid to show himself. Her eye, however, observed him,
  and in a peremptory tone she ordered him to come forward.</p>

  <p>But Jamie would not obey her willingly, and he deemed it best for him to
  make a dash through the kitchen to the open front door.</p>

  <p>"That boy!" growled Miss Trevisa, "I'll be bound he has been at
  mischief."</p>

  <p>"Auntie, I think the rain has ceased, I will say good-by."</p>

  <p>Then Judith left the cottage.</p>

  <p>"Ju," said Jamie, when he was with his sister beyond earshot of the aunt,
  "such fun&mdash;I have something to tell you."</p>

  <p>"What is it, Jamie?"</p>

  <p>"I won't tell you till we get home."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jamie, not till we get back to Polzeath?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not till we get half-way home&mdash;to the white gate. Then I will
  tell you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; JAMIE'S RIDE.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Now, Jamie! the white gate."</p>

  <p>"The white gate!&mdash;what about that?" He had forgotten his promise.</p>

  <p>"You have a secret to tell me."</p>

  <p>Then the boy began to laugh and to tap his pockets.</p>

  <p>"What do you think, Ju! look what I have found. Do you know what is in the
  loft of the cottage we were in? There are piles of tobacco, all up hidden
  away in the dark under the rafters. I have got my pockets stuffed as full as
  they will hold. It is for Uncle Zachie. Won't he be pleased?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jamie! you should not have done that."</p>

  <p>"Why not? Don't scold, Ju!"</p>

  <p>"It is stealing."</p>

  <p>"No, it is not. No one lives there."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless it belongs to some one, by whatever means it was got, and
  for whatever purpose stowed away there. You had no right to touch it."</p>

  <p>"Then why do you take snail-shells?"</p>

  <p>"They belong to no one, no one values them. It is other with this tobacco.
  Give it up. Take it back again."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;to Aunt Dunes? I daren't, she's so cross."</p>

  <p>"Well, give it to me, and I will take it to her. She is now at the
  cottage, and the tobacco can be replaced."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Ju, I should like to see her scramble up the wall!"</p>

  <p>"I do not think she will do that; but she will contrive somehow to have
  the tobacco restored. It is not yours, and I believe it belongs to Captain
  Cruel. If it be not given back now he may hear of it and be very angry."</p>

  <p>"He would beat me," said the boy, hastily emptying his pockets. "I'd
  rather have Aunt Dunes' jaw than Captain Cruel's stick." He gave the tobacco
  to his sister, but he was not in a good humor. He did not see the necessity
  for restoring it. But Jamie never disobeyed his sister, when they were alone,
  and she was determined with him. Before others he tried to display his
  independence, by feeble defiances never long maintained, and ending in a
  reconciliation with tears and kisses, and promises of submission without
  demur for the future. With all, even the most docile children, there occur
  epochs when they try their wings, strut and ruffle their plumes, and crow
  very loud&mdash;epochs of petulance or boisterous outbreak of self-assertion
  in the face of their guides and teachers. If the latter be firm, the trouble
  passes away to be renewed at a future period till manhood or womanhood is
  reached, and then guide and teacher who is wise falls back, lays down
  control, and lets the pupils have their own way. But if at the first attempts
  at mastery, those in authority, through indifference or feebleness or folly,
  give way, then the fate of the children is sealed, they are spoiled for
  ever.</p>

  <p>Jamie had his rebellious fits, and they were distressing to Judith, but
  she never allowed herself to be conquered. She evaded provoking them whenever
  possible; and as much as possible led him by his affection. He had a very
  tender heart, was devotedly attached to his sister, and appeals to his better
  nature were usually successful, not always immediately, but in the long
  run.</p>

  <p>Her association with Jamie had been of benefit to Judith; it had
  strengthened her character. She had been forced from earliest childhood to be
  strong where he was weak, to rule because he was incapable of ruling himself.
  This had nurtured in her a decision of mind, a coolness of judgment, and an
  inflexibility of purpose unusual in a girl of her years.</p>

  <p>Judith walked to Othello Cottage, carrying the tobacco in her skirt, held
  up by both hands; and Jamie sauntered back to Polzeath, carrying his sister's
  basket of shells, stopping at intervals to add to the collection, then
  ensconcing himself in a nook of the hedge to watch a finch, a goldhammer, or
  a blackbird, then stopped to observe and follow a beetle of gorgeous metallic
  hues that was running across the path.</p>

  <p>Presently he emerged into the highway, the parish road; there was no main
  road in those parts maintained by toll-gates, and then observed a gig
  approach in which sat two men, one long and narrow-faced, the other tall, but
  stout and round-faced. He recognized the former at once as Mr. Scantlebray,
  the appraiser. Mr. Scantlebray, who was driving, nudged his companion, and
  with the butt-end of the whip pointed to the boy.</p>

  <p>"Heigh! hi-up! Gaffer!" called Mr. Scantlebray, flapping his arms against
  his sides, much as does a cock with his wings. "Come along; I have something
  of urgent importance to say to you&mdash;something so good that it will make
  you squeak; something so delicious that it will make your mouth water."</p>

  <p>This was addressed to Jamie, as the white mare leisurely trotted up to
  where the boy stood. Then Scantlebray drew up, with his elbows at right
  angles to his trunk.</p>

  <p>"Here's my brother thirsting, ravening to make your
  acquaintance&mdash;and, by George! you are in luck's way, young hopeful, to
  make his. Obadiah! this here infant is an orphing. Orphing! this is Obadiah
  Scantlebray, whom I call Scanty because he is fat. Jump up, will y', into the
  gig."</p>

  <p>Jamie looked vacantly about him. He had an idea that he ought to wait for
  Judith or go directly home. But she had not forbidden him to have a ride, and
  a ride was what he dearly loved.</p>

  <p>"Are you coming?" asked Scantlebray; "or do you need a more ceremonious
  introduction to Mr. Obadiah, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I've got a basket of shells," said Jamie. "They belong to Ju."</p>

  <p>"Well, put Ju's basket in&mdash;the shells won't hurt&mdash;and then in
  with you. There's a nice little portmantle in front, on which you can sit and
  look us in the face, and if you don't tumble off with laughing, it will be
  because I strap you in. My brother is the very comicalest fellow in Cornwall.
  It's a wonder I haven't died of laughter. I should have, but our paths
  diverged; he took up the medical line, and I the valuation and all that, so
  my life was saved. Are you comfortable there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Jamie, seated himself where advised.</p>

  <p>"Now for the strap round ye," said Scantlebray. "Don't be alarmed; it's to
  hold you together, lest you split your sides with merriment, and to hold you
  in, lest you tumble overboard convulsed with laughter. That brother of mine
  is the killingest man in Great Britain. Look at his face. Bless me! in church
  I should explode when I saw him, but that I am engrossed in my devotions. On
  with you, Juno!"</p>

  <p>That to the gray mare, and a whip applied to make the gray mare trot
  along, which she did, with her head down lost in thought, or as if smelling
  the road, to make sure that she was on the right track.</p>

  <p>"'Tisn't what he says," remarked Mr. Scantlebray, seeing a questioning
  expression on Jamie's innocent face, "it's the looks of him. And when he
  speaks&mdash;well, it's the way he says it more than what he says. I was at a
  Charity Trust dinner, and Obadiah said to the waiter, 'Cutlets, please!' The
  fellow dropped the dish, and I stuffed my napkin into my mouth, ran out, and
  went into a fit. Now, Scanty, show the young gentleman how to make a
  rabbit."</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Scantlebray tickled up the mare with the lash of his whip, cast
  some objurgations at a horse-fly that was hovering and then darting at
  Juno.</p>

  <p>Mr. Obadiah drew forth a white but very crumpled kerchief from his pocket,
  and proceeded to fold it on his lap.</p>

  <p>"Just look at him," said the agent, "doing it in spite of the motion of
  the gig. It's wonderful. But his face is the butchery. I can't look at it for
  fear of letting go the reins."</p>

  <p>The roads were unfrequented; not a person was passing as the party jogged
  along. Mr. Scantlebray hissed to the mare between his front teeth, which were
  wide apart; then, turning his eye sideways, observed what his brother was
  about.</p>

  <p>"That's his carcase," said he, in reference to the immature rabbit.</p>

  <p>Then a man was sighted coming along the road, humming a tune. It was Mr.
  Menaida.</p>

  <p>"How are you? Compliments to the young lady orphing, and say we're
  jolly&mdash;all three," shouted Scantlebray, urging his mare to a faster
  pace, and keeping her up to it till they had turned a corner, and Menaida was
  no more in sight.</p>

  <p>"Just look at his face, as he's a folding of that there pockyhandkercher,"
  said the appraiser. "It's exploding work."</p>

  <p>Jamie looked into the stolid features of Mr. Obadiah, and
  laughed&mdash;laughed heartily, laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.
  Not that he saw aught humorous there, but that he was told it was there, he
  ought to see it, and would be a fool if he were not convulsed by it.</p>

  <p>Precisely the same thing happens with us. We look at and go into raptures
  over a picture, because it is by a Royal Academician who has been knighted on
  account of his brilliant successes. We are charmed at a cantata, stifling our
  yawns, because we are told by the art critics who are paid to puff it, that
  we are fools, and have no ears if we do not feel charmed by it. We rush to
  read a new novel, and find it vastly clever, because an eminent statesman has
  said on a postcard it has pleased him.</p>

  <p>We laugh when told to laugh, condemn when told to condemn, and would stand
  on our heads if informed that it was bad for us to walk on our feet.</p>

  <p>"There!" said Mr. Scantlebray, the valuer. "Them's ears."</p>

  <p>"Crrrh!" went Mr. Obadiah, and the handkerchief, converted into a white
  bunny, shot from his hand up his sleeve.</p>

  <p>"I can't drive, 'pon my honor; I'm too ill. You have done me for to-day,"
  said Scantlebray the elder, the valuer. "Now, young hopeful, what say you?
  Will you make a rabbit, also? I'll give you a shilling if you will."</p>

  <p>Thereupon Jamie took the kerchief and spread it out, and began to fold it.
  Whenever he went wrong Mr. Obadiah made signs, either by elevation of his
  brows and a little shake of his head, or by pointing, and his elder brother
  caught him at it and protested. Obadiah was the drollest fellow, he was
  incorrigible, as full of mischief as an egg is full of meat. There was no
  trusting him for a minute when the eye was off him.</p>

  <p>"Come, Scanty! I'll put you on your honor. Look the other way." But a
  moment after&mdash;"Ah, for shame! there you are at it again. Young hopeful,
  you see what a vicious brother I have; perfectly untrustworthy, but such a
  comical dog. Full of tricks up to the ears. You should see him make shadows
  on the wall. He can represent a pig eating out of a trough. You see the ears
  flap, the jaws move, the eye twinkle in appreciation of the barley-meal. It
  is to the life, and all done by the two hands&mdash;by one, I may say, for
  the other serves as trough. What! Done the rabbit! First rate! Splendid! Here
  is the shilling. But, honor bright, you don't deserve it; that naughty Scanty
  helped you."</p>

  <p>"Please," said Jamie, timidly, "may I get out now and go home?"</p>

  <p>"Go home! What for?"</p>

  <p>"I want to show Ju my shilling."</p>

  <p>"By ginger! that is too rich. Not a bit of it. Do you know Mistress
  Polgrean's sweetie shop?"</p>

  <p>"But that's at Wadebridge."</p>

  <p>"At Wadebridge; and why not? You will spend your shilling there. But look
  at my brother. It is distressing; his eyes are alight at the thoughts of the
  tartlets, and the sticks of peppermint sugar, and the almond rock. Are you
  partial to almond rock, orphin?"</p>

  <p>Jamie's mind was at once engaged.</p>

  <p>"Which is it to be? Gingerbreads or tartlets, almond rock or
  barley-sugar?"</p>

  <p>"I think I'll have the peppermint," said Jamie.</p>

  <p>"Then peppermint it shall be. And you will give me a little bit, and
  Scanty a bit, and take a little bit home to Ju, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"He'll take a little bit home to Ju, Obadiah, old man."</p>

  <p>The funny brother nodded.</p>

  <p>"And the basket of shells?" asked the elder.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she is making little boxes with them to sell," said Jamie.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I may have the privilege of buying some," said Mr. Scantlebray,
  senior. "Oh, look at that brother of mine! How he is screwing his nose about!
  I say, old man, are you ill? Upon my life, I believe he is laughing."</p>

  <p>Presently Jamie got restless.</p>

  <p>"Please, Mr. Scantlebray, may I get out? Ju will be frightened at my being
  away so long."</p>

  <p>"Poor Ju!" said Scantlebray, the elder. "But no&mdash;don't you worry your
  mind about that. We passed Uncle Zachie, and he will tell her where you are,
  in good hands, or rather, nipped between most reliable knees&mdash;my
  brother's and mine. Sit still. I can't stop Juno; we're going down-hill now,
  and if I stopped Juno she would fall. You must wait&mdash;wait till we get to
  Mrs. Polgrean's." Then, after chuckling-to himself, Scantlebray, senior,
  said: "Obadiah, old man, I wonder what Missie Ju is thinking? I wonder what
  she will say, eh?" Again he chuckled. "No place in your establishment for
  that party, eh?"</p>

  <p>The outskirts of Wadebridge were reached.</p>

  <p>"Now may I get out?" said Jamie.</p>

  <p>"Bless my heart! Not yet. Wait for Mrs. Polgrean's."</p>

  <p>But presently Mrs. Polgrean's shop-window was passed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, stop! stop!" cried Jamie. "We have gone by the sweetie shop."</p>

  <p>"Of course we have," answered Scantlebray, senior. "I daren't trust that
  brother of mine in there; he has such a terrible sweet tooth. Besides, I want
  you to see the pig eating out of the trough. It will kill you. If it don't
  I'll give you another shilling."</p>

  <p>Presently he drew up at the door of a stiff, square-built house, with a
  rambling wing thrown out on one side. It was stuccoed and painted
  drab&mdash;drab walls, drab windows, and drab door.</p>

  <p>"Now, then, young man," said Scantlebray, cheerily, "I'll unbuckle the
  strap and let you out. You come in with me. This is my brother's mansion,
  roomy, pleasant, and comprehensive. You shall have a dish of tea."</p>

  <p>"And then I may go home?"</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;we shall see; shan't we, Obadiah, old man?"</p>

  <p>They entered the hall, and the door was shut and fastened behind them;
  then into a somewhat dreary room, with red flock paper on the walls, no
  pictures, leather-covered, old, mahogany chairs, and a book or two on the
  table&mdash;one of these a Bible.</p>

  <p>Jamie looked wonderingly about him, a little disposed to cry. He was a
  long way from Polzeath, and Judith would be waiting for him and anxious, and
  the place into which he was ushered was not cheery, not inviting.</p>

  <p>"Now, then," said Mr. Scantlebray, "young hopeful, give me my
  shilling."</p>

  <p>"Please, I'm going to buy some peppermint and burnt almonds for Ju and me
  as I go back."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed! But suppose you do not have the chance?"</p>

  <p>Jamie looked vacantly in his face, then into that of the stolid brother,
  who was not preparing to show him the pig feeding out of a trough, nor was he
  calling for tea.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Scantlebray, the elder; "suppose I take charge of that
  shilling till you have the chance of spending it, young man."</p>

  <p>"Please, I'll spend it now."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. You won't have the chance. Do you know where you are!"</p>

  <p>Jamie looked round in distress. He was becoming frightened at the altered
  tone of the valuer.</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Mr. Scantlebray, "you're now an honorable inmate of my
  brother's Establishment for Idiots, which you don't leave till cured of
  imbecility. That shilling, if you please?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; ALL IS FOR THE BEST IN THE BEST OF
     WORLDS.</h2>

  <p class="first">Judith returned to the cottage of Mr. Menaida, troubled in
  mind, for Aunt Dunes had been greatly incensed at the taking of the tobacco
  by Jamie, and not correspondingly gratified by the return of it so promptly
  by Judith. Miss Trevisa was a woman who magnified and resented any wrong
  done, but minimized and passed over as unworthy of notice whatever was
  generous, and every attempt made to repay an evil. Such attempts not only met
  with no favor from her, but were perverted in her crabbed mind into fresh
  affronts or injuries. That the theft of Jamie would not have been discovered
  had not Judith spoken of it and brought back what had been taken, was made of
  no account by Aunt Dionysia; she attacked Judith with sharp reproach for
  allowing the boy to be mischievous, for indulging him and suffering him to
  run into danger through his inquisitiveness and thoughtlessness. "For," said
  Aunt Dionysia, "had the master or any of his men found out what Jamie had
  done there is no telling how he might have been served." Then she had
  muttered: "If you will not take precautions, other folk must, and the boy
  must be put where he can be properly looked after and kept from interfering
  with the affairs of others."</p>

  <p>On reaching Mr. Menaida's cottage, Judith called her brother, but as she
  did not receive an answer, she went in quest of him, and was met by the
  servant, Jump. "If you please, miss," said Jump, "there's been two gen'lemen
  here, as said they was come from Mrs. Trevisa, and said they was to pack and
  take off Master Jamie's clothes. And please miss, I didn't know what to
  do&mdash;they was gen'lemen, and the master&mdash;he was out, and you was
  out, miss&mdash;and Master Jamie, he wasn't to home n'other."</p>

  <p>"Taken Jamie's clothes!" repeated Judith, in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss, they brought a portmantle a-purpose; and they'd a gig at the
  door; and they spoke uncommon pleasant, leastwise one o' them did."</p>

  <p>"And where is Jamie? Has he not come home?"</p>

  <p>"No, miss."</p>

  <p>At that moment Mr. Menaida came in.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Judith? Jamie? Where Jamie is?&mdash;why, having a ride,
  seated between the two Scantlebrays, in their gig. That is where he is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Menaida, but they have taken his clothes!"</p>

  <p>"Whose clothes?"</p>

  <p>"Jamie's."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"The two gentlemen came to this house when you and I were out, and told
  Jump that they were empowered by my aunt to pack up and carry off all Jamie's
  clothing, which they put into a portmanteau they had brought with them."</p>

  <p>"And then picked up Jamie. He was sitting on the portmanteau," said Uncle
  Zachie; then his face became grave. "They said that they acted under
  authority from Mrs. Trevisa?"</p>

  <p>"So Jump says."</p>

  <p>"It can surely not be that he has been moved to the asylum."</p>

  <p>"Asylum, Mr. Menaida?"</p>

  <p>"The idiot asylum."</p>

  <p>Judith uttered a cry, and staggered back against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Jamie! my brother Jamie!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray has such a place at Wadebridge."</p>

  <p>"But Jamie is not an idiot."</p>

  <p>"Your aunt authorized them&mdash;," mused Uncle Zachie. "Humph! you should
  see her about it. That is the first step, and ascertain whether she has done
  it, or whether they are acting with a high hand for themselves. I'll look at
  my law-books&mdash;if the latter it would be actionable."</p>

  <p>Judith did not hesitate for a moment. She hastened to Pentyre. That her
  aunt had left Othello Cottage she was pretty sure, as she was preparing to
  leave it when Judith returned with the tobacco. Accordingly she took the road
  to Pentyre at once. Tears of shame and pain welled up in her eyes at the
  thought of her darling brother being beguiled away to be locked up among the
  imbecile in a private establishment for the insane. Then her heart was
  contracted with anger and resentment at the scurvy trick played on her and
  him: She did not know that the Scantlebrays had been favored by pure
  accident. She conceived that men base enough to carry off her brother would
  watch and wait for the opportunity when to do it unobserved and unopposed.
  She hardly walked. She ran till her breath failed her, and the rapid
  throbbing of her heart would no longer allow her to run. Her dread of
  approaching the Glaze after the declaration made by Captain Cruel was
  overwhelmed in her immediate desire to know something about Jamie, in her
  anguish of fear for him. On Coppinger she did not cast a thought&mdash;her
  mind was so fully engrossed in her brother.</p>

  <p>She saw nothing of the Captain. She entered the house, and proceeded at
  once to her aunt's apartment. She found Miss Trevisa there, seated near the
  window, engaged on some chintz that she thought would do for the window at
  Othello Cottage, when she took possession of it. She had measured the piece,
  found that it was suitable, and was turning down a hem and tacking it. It was
  a pretty chintz, covered with sprigs of nondescript pink and blue
  flowers.</p>

  <p>Judith burst in on her, breathless, her brow covered with dew, her bosom
  heaving, her face white with distress, and tears standing on her eyelashes.
  She threw herself on her knees before Miss Trevisa, half crying out and half
  sobbing:</p>

  <p>"Oh, aunt! they have taken him!"</p>

  <p>"Who have taken whom?" asked the elderly lady, coldly.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes and cast a look full of malevolence at Judith. She
  never had, did not, never would feel toward that girl as a niece. She hated
  her for her mother's sake, and now she felt an unreasonable bitterness
  against her, because she had fascinated Coppinger&mdash;perhaps, also,
  because in a dim fashion she was aware that she herself was acting toward the
  child in an unworthy, unmerciful manner, and we all hate those whom we
  wrong.</p>

  <p>"Auntie! tell me it is not so. Mr. Scantlebray and his brother have
  carried my darling Jamie away."</p>

  <p>"Well, and what of that!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;will they let me have him back?"</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa pulled at the chintz. "I will trouble you not to crumple
  this," she said.</p>

  <p>"Aunt! dear aunt! you did not tell Mr. Scantlebray to take Jamie away from
  me?"</p>

  <p>The old lady did not answer, she proceeded to release the material at
  which she was engaged from under the knees of Judith. The girl, in her
  vehemence, put her hands to her aunt's arms, between the elbows and
  shoulders, and held and pressed them back, and with imploring eyes looked
  into her hard face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, auntie! you never sent Jamie to an asylum?"</p>

  <p>"I must beg you to let go my arms," said Miss Trevisa. "This conduct
  strikes me as most indecorous toward one of my age and relationship."</p>

  <p>She avoided Judith's eye, her brow wrinkled, and her lips contracted. The
  gall in her heart rose and overflowed.</p>

  <p>"I am not ashamed of what I have done."</p>

  <p>"Auntie!" with a cry of pain. Then Judith let go the old lady's arms, and
  clasped her hands over her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Really," said Miss Trevisa, with asperity, "you are a most exasperating
  person. I shall do with the boy what I see fit. You know very well that he is
  a thief."</p>

  <p>"He never took anything before to-day&mdash;never&mdash;and you had
  settled this before you knew about the tobacco!" burst from Judith, in anger
  and with floods of tears.</p>

  <p>"I knew that he has always been troublesome and mischievous, and he must
  be placed where he can be properly managed by those accustomed to such
  cases."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing the matter with Jamie."</p>

  <p>"You have humored and spoiled him. If he is such a plague to all who know
  him, it is because he has been treated injudiciously. He is now with men who
  are experienced, and able to deal with the like of Jamie."</p>

  <p>"Aunt, he must not be there. I promised my papa to be ever with him, and
  to look after him."</p>

  <p>"Then it is a pity your father did not set this down in writing. Please to
  remember that I, and not you, am constituted his guardian, by the terms of
  the will."</p>

  <p>"Oh, aunt! aunt! let him come back to me!"</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Then let me go to him!"</p>

  <p>"Hoity-toity! here's airs and nonsense. Really, Judith, you are almost
  imbecile enough to qualify for the asylum. But I cannot afford the cost of
  you both. Jamie's cost in that establishment will be 70 in the year, and how
  much do you suppose that you possess?"</p>

  <p>Judith remained kneeling upright, with her hands clasped, looking
  earnestly through her tears at her aunt.</p>

  <p>"You have in all, between you, but 45 or 50. When the dilapidations are
  paid, and the expenses of the funeral, and the will-proving, and all that, I
  do not suppose you will be found to have a thousand pounds between you, and
  that put out to interest will not bring you more than I have said; so I shall
  have to make up the deficiency. That is not pleasing to me, you may well
  suppose. But I had rather pay 25 out of my poor income, than have the name
  of the family disgraced by Jamie."</p>

  <p>"Jamie will never, never disgrace the name. He is too good. And&mdash;it
  is wicked, it is cruel to put him where you have. He is not an idiot."</p>

  <p>"I am perhaps a better judge than you; so also is Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray,
  who has devoted his life to the care and study of the imbecile. Your brother
  has weak intellects."</p>

  <p>"He is not clever; that is all. With application&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He cannot apply his mind. He has no mind that can be got to be
  applied."</p>

  <p>"Aunt, he's no idiot. He must not be kept in that place."</p>

  <p>"You had best go back to Polzeath. I have decided on what I considered
  right. I have done my duty."</p>

  <p>"It cannot be just. I will see what Mr. Menaida says. He must be released;
  if you will not let him out, I will."</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa looked up at her quickly between her half-closed lids; a
  bitter, cruel smile quivered about her lips. "If any one can deliver him, it
  will be you."</p>

  <p>Judith did not understand her meaning, and Aunt Dionysia did not care at
  that time to further enlighten her thereon. Finding her aunt inflexible, the
  unhappy girl left Pentyre Glaze and hurried back to Polzeath, where she
  implored Mr. Menaida to accompany her to Wadebridge. Go there she
  would&mdash;she must&mdash;that same evening. If he would not attend her, she
  would go alone. She could not rest, she could not remain in the house, till
  she had been to the place where Jamie was, and seen whether she could not
  release him thence by her entreaties, her urgency.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida shook his head. But he was a kind-hearted old man, and was
  distressed at the misery of the girl, and would not hear of her making the
  expedition alone, as she could not well return before dark. So he assumed his
  rough and shabby beaver hat, put on his best cravat, and sallied forth with
  Judith upon her journey to Wadebridge, one that he assured her must be
  fruitless, and had better be postponed till the morrow.</p>

  <p>"I cannot! I cannot!" she cried. "I cannot sleep, thinking of my darling
  brother in that dreadful place, with such people about him, he crying,
  frightened, driven mad by the strangeness of it all, and being away from me.
  I must go. If I cannot save him and bring him back with me, I can see him and
  console him, and bid him wait in patience and hope."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida with a soft heart and a weak will, was hung about with scraps
  of old-world polish, scraps only. In him nothing was complete&mdash;here and
  there a bare place of rustic uncouthness, there patches of velvet courtesy of
  the Queen Anne age; so, also, was he made up of fine culture, of classic
  learning alternating with boorish ignorance&mdash;here high principle, there
  none at all&mdash;a picture worked to a miniature in points, and in others
  rudely roughed in and neglected. Now he was moved as he had not been moved
  for years by the manifest unhappiness of the girl, and he was willing to do
  his utmost to assist her, but that utmost consisted in little more than
  accompanying her to Wadebridge and ringing at the house-bell of Mr. Obadiah
  Scantlebray's establishment. When it came to the interview that ensued with
  the proprietor of the establishment and jailer of Jamie, he failed
  altogether. Judith and Uncle Zachie were shown into the dreary parlor without
  ornaments, and presently to them entered Mr. Obadiah.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir, is he here?&mdash;have you got Jamie here?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray nodded his head, then went to the door and knocked with
  his fists against the wall. A servant maid appeared. "Send missus," said he,
  and returned to the parlor.</p>

  <p>Again Judith entreated to be told if her brother were there with all the
  vehemence and fervor of her tattered heart.</p>

  <p>Mr. Obadiah listened with stolid face and vacant eyes that turned from her
  to Mr. Menaida, and then back to her again. Presently an idea occurred to him
  and his face brightened. He went to a sideboard, opened a long drawer,
  brought out a large book, thrust it before Judith, and said, "Pictures."
  Then, as she took no notice of the book, he opened it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, please sir," pleaded Judith, "I don't want that. I want to know about
  Jamie. I want to see him."</p>

  <p>Then in at the door came a lady in black silk, with small curls about her
  brow. She was stout, but not florid.</p>

  <p>"What!" said she, "my dear, are you the young lady whose brother is here?
  Don't you fret yourself. He is as comfortable as a chick in a feathered nest.
  Don't you worry your little self about him now. Now your good days have
  begun. He will not be a trouble and anxiety to you any more. He is well cared
  for. I dare be sworn he has given you many an hour of anxiety. Now, O be
  joyful! that is over, and you can dance and play with a light heart. I have
  lifted the load off you, I and Mr. Scantlebray. Here he will be very
  comfortable and perfectly happy. I spare no pains to make my pets snug, and
  Scantlebray is inexhaustible in his ability to amuse them. He has a way with
  these innocents that is quite marvellous. Wait a while&mdash;give him and me
  a trial, and see what the result is. You may believe me as one of long and
  tried experience. It never does for amateurs&mdash;for relations&mdash;to
  undertake these cases; they don't know when to be firm, or when to yield. We
  do&mdash;it is our profession. We have studied the half-witted."</p>

  <p>"But my brother is <i>not</i> half-witted."</p>

  <p>"So you say, and so it becomes you to say. Never admit that there is
  imbecility or insanity in the family. You are quite right, my dear; you look
  forward to being married some day, and you know very well it might stand in
  the way of an engagement, were it supposed that you had idiocy in the family
  blood. It is quite right. I understand all that sort of thing. We call it
  nervous debility, and insanity we term nervous excitement. Scantlebray, my
  poppet, isn't it so!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Obadiah nodded.</p>

  <p>"You leave all care to us; thrust it upon our shoulders. They will bear
  it; and never doubt that your brother will be cared for in body and in soul.
  In body&mdash;always something nice and light for supper, tapioca,
  rice-pudding, batter; to-night, rolly-poly. After that, prayers. We don't
  feed high, but we feed suitably. If you like to pay a little extra, we will
  feed higher. Now, my dear, you take all as for the best, and rely on it
  everything is right."</p>

  <p>"But Jamie ought not to be locked up."</p>

  <p>"My dear, he is at school under the wisest and most experienced of
  teachers. You have mismanaged him. Now he will be treated professionally; and
  Mr. Scantlebray superintends not the studies only, but the amusements of the
  pupils. He has such a fund of humor in him." Obadiah at once produced his
  pocket-handkerchief and began to fold it. "No, dear, no ducky, no rabbit now!
  You fond thing, you! always thinking of giving entertainment to some one. No,
  nor the parson preaching either." He was rolling his hands together and
  thrusting up his thumb as the representative of a sacred orator in his
  pulpit. "No, ducky darling! another time. My husband is quite a godsend to
  the nervously prostrate. He can amuse them by the hour; he never wearies of
  it; he is never so happy as when he is entertaining them. You cannot doubt
  that your brother will be content in the house of such a man. Take my word
  for it; there is nothing like believing that all is for the best as it is.
  Our pupils will soon be going to bed. Rolly-poly and prayers, and then to
  bed&mdash;that is the order."</p>

  <p>"Oh, let me see Jamie now."</p>

  <p>"No, my dear. It would be injudicious. He is settling in; he is becoming
  reconciled, and it would disturb him, and undo what has already been done.
  Don't you say so, poppet?"</p>

  <p>The poppet nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"You see, this great authority agrees with me. Now, this evening Jamie and
  the others shall have an extra treat. They shall have the pig eating out of
  the trough. There&mdash;what more can you desire? As soon as lights are
  brought in, then rolly-poly, prayers, and the pig and the trough. Another
  time you shall see him. Not to-night. It is inadvisable. Take my word for it,
  your brother is as happy as a boy can be. He has found plenty of companions
  of the same condition as himself."</p>

  <p>"But he is <i>not</i> an idiot."</p>

  <p>"My dear, we know all about that; very nice and sweet for you to say
  so&mdash;isn't it duckie?"</p>

  <p>The duckie agreed it was so.</p>

  <p>"There is the bell. My dear, another time. You will promise to come and
  see me again? I have had such a delightful talk with you. Good-night,
  good-night. 'All is for the best in the best of worlds.' Put that maxim under
  your head and sleep upon it."</p>

  <p class="first">Some people are ever satisfied with what is certain to give
  themselves least trouble, especially if that something concerns other
  persons.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida was won over by the volubility of Mrs. Scantlebray and the
  placidity of Mr. Scantlebray to the conviction that Jamie was in the very
  best place he could possibly be in. A lady who called Judith "my dear" and
  her husband "duckie" must have a kindly heart, and a gentleman like Mr.
  Obadiah, so full of resources, could not fail to divert and gratify the minds
  of those under his charge, and banish care and sorrow. And as Mr. Menaida
  perceived that it would be a difficult matter to liberate Jamie from the
  establishment where he was, and as it was an easy matter to conclude that the
  establishment was admirably adapted to Jamie, he was content that Aunt
  Dionysia had chosen the wisest course in putting him there, and that it would
  be to the general advantage to cherish this opinion. For, in the first place,
  it would pacify Judith, and then, by pacifying her, would give himself none
  of that inconvenience, that running to and fro between Polzeath and
  Wadebridge, that consultation of law-books, that correspondence, that getting
  of toes and fingers into hot water, likely to result from the impatience, the
  unflagging eagerness of Judith to liberate her brother.</p>

  <p>Accordingly Uncle Zachie used his best endeavors to assure Judith that
  Jamie certainly was happy, had never been so happy in his life before, and
  that, under the treatment of so kind and experienced a man as Mr. Obadiah
  Scantlebray, there was reason to believe that in a short time Jamie would
  issue from under his tuition a light so brilliant as to outshine the beacon
  on Trevose Head.</p>

  <p>Judith was unconvinced. Love is jealous and timorous. She feared lest all
  should not be as was represented. There was an indefinable something in Mrs.
  Scantlebray that roused her suspicion. She could not endure that others
  should step into the place of responsibility toward Jamie she had occupied so
  long, and which she had so solemnly assured her father she would never
  abandon. Supposing that Scantlebray and his wife were amiable and considerate
  persons, might they not so influence the fickle Jamie as to displace her from
  his affections and insinuate themselves in her room?</p>

  <p>But it was not this mainly that troubled her. She was tormented with the
  thought of the lonely, nervous child in the strange house, among strange
  people, in desolation of heart and deadly fear.</p>

  <p>Whenever he had become excited during the day he was sleepless at night,
  and had to be soothed and coaxed into slumber. On such occasions she had been
  wont, with the infinite, inexhaustible patience of true love, to sit by his
  bed, pacifying his alarms, allaying his agitation, singing to him, stroking
  his hair, holding his hand, till his eyes closed. And how often, just as he
  seemed about to drop asleep, had he become again suddenly awake, through some
  terror, or some imagined discomfort? then all the soothing process had to be
  gone through again, and it had always been gone through without a murmur or
  an impatient word.</p>

  <p>Now Jamie was alone&mdash;or perhaps worse than alone&mdash;in a dormitory
  of idiots, whose strange ways filled him with terror, and his dull mind would
  be working to discover how he came to be there, how it was that his Ju was
  not with him. Who would lull his fears, who sing to him old familiar strains?
  Would any other hand rest on the hot brow and hold it down on the pillow?</p>

  <p>Judith looked up to heaven, to the stars already glimmering there. She was
  not hearkening to the talk of Uncle Zachie: she was thinking her own
  thoughts. She was indeed walking back to Polzeath; but her mind was nailed to
  that dull drab house in the suburbs of Wadebridge with the brass plate on the
  door, inscribed, "Mr. Scantlebray, Surgeon." As her eyes were raised to the
  stars, she thought of her father. He was above, looking down on her, and it
  seemed to her that in the flicker of the stars she saw the trouble in her
  father's face at the knowledge that his children were parted, and his poor
  little half-bright boy was fallen among those who had no love for him, might
  have no patience with his waywardness, would not make allowance for his
  infirmities.</p>

  <p>She sobbed, and would not be comforted by Mr. Menaida's assurances. Tired,
  foot-weary, but more tired and weary in heart and mind, she reached the
  cottage. She could not sleep; she was restless. She sought Jamie's room, and
  seated herself on the chair by his little bed, and sobbed far on into the
  night. Her head ached, as did her burning and blistered feet; and as she sat
  she dozed off, then awoke with a start, so distinctly did she seem to hear
  Jamie's voice&mdash;his familiar tone when in distress&mdash;crying, "Ju!
  Come to me, Ju!" So vividly did the voice sound to her that she could not for
  a moment or two shake off the conviction that she had in reality heard him.
  She thought that he must have called her. He must be unhappy. What were those
  people doing to him? Were they tormenting the poor little frightened
  creature? Were they putting him into a dark room by himself, and was he
  nearly mad with terror? Were they beating him, because he cried out in the
  night and disturbed the house?</p>

  <p>She imagined him sitting up on a hard bed, shivering with fear, looking
  round him in the dark, and screaming for her&mdash;and she could not help
  him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jamie!" she cried, and threw herself on her knees and put her hands
  over her eyes to shut out the horrible sight, over her ears to close them to
  the piercing cry. "They will drive him mad! Oh, papa! my papa! what will you
  say to me? Oh, my Jamie! what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>She was half mad herself, mad with fancies, conjured up by the fever of
  distress into which she had worked herself. What could she do? She could not
  breathe in that room. She could not breathe in the house. She could not
  remain so far from Jamie&mdash;and he crying for her. His voice rang still in
  her ears. It sounded in her heart, it drew her irresistibly away. If she
  could but be outside that drab establishment in the still night, to listen,
  and hear if all were quiet within, or whether Jamie were calling, shrieking
  for her. He would cry himself into fits. He would become really deranged,
  unless he were pacified. Oh! those people!&mdash;she imagined they were up,
  not knowing what to do with the boy, unable to soothe him, and were now
  wishing that she were there, wishing they had not sent her away.</p>

  <p>Judith was in that condition which is one of half craze through brooding
  on her fears, through intense sympathy with the unhappy boy so ruthlessly
  spirited away, through fever of the blood, caused by long-protracted nervous
  strain, through over-weariness of mind and body. Jamie's distress, his need
  for her became an idea that laid hold of her, that could not be dispelled,
  that tortured her into recklessness. She could not lie on her bed, she could
  not rest her head for one moment. She ran to the window, panting, and smoked
  the glass with her burning breath, so that she could not see through it.</p>

  <p>The night was still, the sky clear, and there were stars in it. Who would
  be abroad at that time? What danger would ensue to her if she went out and
  ran back to Wadebridge? If any foot were to be heard on the road, she could
  hide. She had gone out at night in storm to save Cruel Coppinger&mdash;should
  she not go out in still starlight to aid her own twin-brother, if he needed
  her? Providence had shielded her before&mdash;it would shield her now.</p>

  <p>The house was quiet. Mr. Menaida had long ago gone to bed, and was asleep.
  His snores were usually audible at night through the cottage. Jump was
  asleep, sound in sleep as any hard-worked sewing-wench. Judith had not
  undressed, had not taken off her shoes; she had wandered, consumed by
  restlessness, between her own room and that of her brother.</p>

  <p>It was impossible for her to remain there. She felt that she would die of
  imaginings of evil unless she were near Jamie, unless there were naught but a
  wall between him and her.</p>

  <p>Judith descended the stairs and once again went forth alone into the
  night, not now to set her face seaward, but landward; before she had gone
  with a defined aim in view, to warn Coppinger of his danger, now she was
  moved by a vague suspicion of evil.</p>

  <p>The night was calm, but there was summer lightning on the horizon,
  attended by no thunder, a constant flicker, sometimes a flare, as though some
  bonfire were kindled beyond the margin of the world, that was being stirred
  and added to. The air was close.</p>

  <p>Judith had no one to look to in the world to help her and Jamie&mdash;not
  her aunt, her sole relative, it was she who had sent her brother to this
  place of restraint; not Mr. Menaida, he had not the moral courage and energy
  of purpose to succor her in her effort to release Jamie; not Captain
  Coppinger&mdash;him she dare not ask, lest he should expect too much in
  return. The hand of misfortune was heavy on the girl; if anything was to be
  done to relieve the pressure, she must do it herself.</p>

  <p>As she was going hastily along the lane she suddenly halted. She heard
  some one a little way before her. There was no gate near by which she could
  escape. The lane was narrow, and the hedges low, so as not to afford
  sufficient shadow to conceal her. By the red summer flashes she saw a man
  reeling toward her round the corner. His hat was on one side of his head, and
  he lurched first to one side of the lane, then to the other.</p>

  <p>"There went three trav'llers over the moor&mdash; Ri-tiddle-riddle-rol,
  huph! said he. Three trav'llers over the moor so green, The one sang high,
  the third sang low, Ri-tiddle-riddle-rol, huph! said he, And the second he
  trolled between."</p>

  <p>Then he stood still.</p>

  <p>"Huph! huph!" he shouted. "Some one else go on, I'm done
  for&mdash;'Ri-tiddle-de.'"</p>

  <p>He saw Judith by the starlight and by the flicker of the lightning, and
  put his head on one side and capered toward her with arms extended,
  chirping&mdash;"'Ri-tiddle-riddle-rol, huph! said he.'"</p>

  <p>Judith started on one side, and the drunken man pursued her, but in so
  doing, stumbled, and fell sprawling on the ground. He scrambled to his feet
  again, and began to swear at her and sent after her a volley of foul and
  profane words. Had he contented himself with this it would have been bad
  enough, but he also picked up a stone and threw it. Judith felt a blow on her
  head, and the lightning flashes seemed to be on all sides of her, and then
  great black clouds to be rising like smoke out of the earth about her. She
  staggered into the hedge, and sank on her knees.</p>

  <p>But fear lest the tipsy ruffian should pursue her nerved her to make an
  effort to escape. She quickly rose and ran along the lane, turned the corner,
  and ran on till her feet would no longer bear her, and her breath failed.
  Then, looking back, and seeing that she was not followed, she seated herself,
  breathless, and feeling sick, in the hedge, where a glow-worm was shining,
  with a calm, steady light, very different from the flicker of the stars
  above.</p>

  <p>As she there sat, she was conscious of something warm on her neck, and
  putting her hand up, felt that it was moist. She held her fingers to the
  faint glow of the worm in the grass; there was a dark stain on her hand, and
  she was sure that it was blood.</p>

  <p>She felt her head swim, and knew that in another moment she would lose
  consciousness, unless she made an effort to resist. Hastily she bound a white
  handkerchief about her head where wounded by the stone, to stay the flow, and
  walked resolutely forward.</p>

  <p>There was now a shadow stealing up the sky to the south, and obscuring the
  stars, a shadow behind which danced and wavered the electrical light, but
  Judith heard no thunder, she had not the leisure to listen for it; all her
  anxiety was to reach Wadebridge. But the air, the oppressively sultry air,
  was charged with sound, the mutter and growl of the Atlantic. The ocean,
  never at rest, ever gives forth a voice, but the volume of its tone varies.
  Now it was loud and threatening, loud and threatening as it had been on that
  afternoon when Judith sat with her father in the rectory garden, tossing
  guelder-roses. Then, the air had been still, but burdened with the menace of
  the sea. So it was now at midnight; the ocean felt the influence of the
  distant storm that was playing far away to the south.</p>

  <p>Judith could not run now. Her feet were too sore, her strength had given
  way. Resolute though her will might be, it could not inspire with masculine
  strength the fragile little body, recently recovered from sickness. But it
  carried her into the suburbs of Wadebridge, and in the starlight she reached
  the house of Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray, and stood before it, looking up at it
  despairingly. It was not drab in color now, it was lampblack against a sky
  that flashed in the russet-light. The kerchief she had tied about her head
  had become loose. Still looking at the ugly, gloomy house, she put up her
  arms and rebound it, knotting the ends more tightly, using care not to cover
  her ears, as she was intent to hear the least sound, that issued from the
  asylum. But for some time she could hear nothing save the rush of her blood
  in her ears, foaming, hissing, like the tide entering a bay over reefs. With
  this was mingled the mutter of the Atlantic, beyond the hills&mdash;and
  now&mdash;yes, certainly now&mdash;the rumble of remote thunder.</p>

  <p>Judith had stood on the opposite side of the street looking up at
  Scantlebray's establishment; she saw no light anywhere. Now she drew near and
  crept along the walls. There was a long wing, with its back to the street,
  without a window in the wall, and she thought it probable that the inmates of
  the asylum were accommodated therein, a dormitory up-stairs, play or
  school-rooms below. There Jamie must be. The only windows to this wing opened
  into the garden; and consequently Judith stole along the garden wall, turned
  the angle, down a little lane, and stood listening. The wall was high, and
  the summit encrusted with broken glass. She could see the glass prongs by the
  flicker of the lightning. She could not possibly see over the wall; the lane
  was too narrow for her to go back far, and the wall on the further side too
  high to climb. Not a sound from within reached her ears.</p>

  <p>In the still night she stood holding her breath.</p>

  <p>Then a scream startled her.</p>

  <p>It was the cry of a gull flying inland.</p>

  <p>If a gull's cry could be heard, then surely that of her brother, were he
  awake and unhappy, and wanting her.</p>

  <p>She went further down the wall, and came on a small garden gate in it,
  fastened, locked from within. It had a stone step. On that she sank, and laid
  her head in her hands.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; FOUND.</h2>

  <p class="first">Strange mystery of human sympathy! inexplicable, yet very
  real. Irrational, yet very potent. The young mother has accepted an
  invitation to a garden-party. She knows that she never looked better than at
  present, with a shade of delicacy about her. She has got a new bonnet that is
  particularly becoming, and which she desires to wear in public. She has been
  secluded from society for several months, and she longs to meet her friends
  again. She knows that she is interesting, and believes herself to be more
  interesting than she really is. So she goes. She is talking, laughing, a
  little flushed with pleasure, when suddenly she becomes grave, the hand that
  holds the plate of raspberries and cream trembles. All her pleasure is gone.
  She knows that baby is crying. Her eye wanders in quest of her husband, she
  runs to him, touches his arm, says&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Do order the carriage; baby is crying."</p>

  <p>It is all fiddle-de-dee. Baby has the best of nurses, the snuggest,
  daintiest little cot; has a fresh-opened tin of condensed Swiss milk. Reason
  tells her that; but no! and nurse cannot do anything to pacify the child,
  baby is crying, nurse is in despair.</p>

  <p>In like manner now did Judith argue with herself, without being able to
  convince her heart. Her reason spoke and said to her&mdash;</p>

  <p>No sound of cries comes from the asylum. There is no light in any window.
  Every inmate is asleep, Jamie among them. He does not need you. He is
  travelling in dreamland. The Scantlebrays have been kind to him. The lady is
  a good, motherly body; the gentleman's whole soul is devoted to finding
  amusement and entertainment for the afflicted creatures under his care. He
  has played tricks before Jamie, made shadow-pictures on the wall, told funny
  stories, made jacks-in-the-box with his hands, and Jamie has laughed till he
  was tired, and his heavy eyes closed with a laugh not fully laughed out on
  his lips. The Scantlebrays are paid 70 for taking care of Jamie, and 70 in
  Judith's estimation was a very princely sum. The 70 per annum Mr.
  Scantlebray would corruscate into his richest fun, and Mrs. Scantlebray's
  heart overflowed with warmest maternal affection.</p>

  <p>But it was in vain that Judith thus reasoned, her heart would not be
  convinced. An indescribable unrest was in her, and would not be laid. She
  knew by instinct that Jamie wanted her, was crying for her, was stretching
  out his hands in the dark for her.</p>

  <p>As she sat on the step not only did reason speak, but judgment also. She
  could do nothing there. She had acted a foolish part in coming all that way
  in the dark, and without a chance of effecting any deliverance to Jamie now
  she had reached her destination. She had committed an egregious error in
  going such a distance from home, from anyone who might serve as protector to
  her in the event of danger, and there were other dangers she might encounter
  than having stones thrown at her by drunken men. If the watch were to find
  her there, what explanation of her presence could she give? Would they take
  her away and lock her up for the rest of the night? They could not leave her
  there. Large, warm drops, like tears from angels' eyes, fell out of heaven
  upon her folded hands, and on her bowed neck.</p>

  <p>She began to feel chilled after having been heated by her walk, so she
  rose, and found that she had become stiff. She must move about, however sore
  and weary her feet might be.</p>

  <p>She had explored the lane as far as was needful. She could not see from it
  into the house, the garden, and playground. Was it possible that there was a
  lane on the further side of the house which would give her the desired
  opportunity?</p>

  <p>Judith resolved to return by the way she had come, down the lane into the
  main street, then to walk along the front of the house, and explore the other
  side. As she was descending the lane she noticed, about twenty paces from the
  door, on the further side, a dense mass of Portugal laurel that hung over the
  opposite wall, casting a shadow of inky blackness into the lane. This she
  considered might serve her as shelter when the threatening storm broke and
  the rain poured down. She walked through this shadow, and would have entered
  the street, but that she perceived certain dark objects passing noiselessly
  along it. By the flashes of lightning she could distinguish men with laden
  asses, and one she saw turn to enter the lane where she was. She drew back
  hastily into the blot cast by the bush that swung its luxuriance over the
  wall, and drew as closely back to the wall as was possible. Thus she could
  not be seen, for the reflection of the lightning would not fall on her; every
  glare made the shadow seem the deeper. Though concealed herself, and wholly
  invisible, she was able to distinguish a man with an ass passing by, and then
  halting at the door in the wall that surrounded Mr. Obadiah's tenement. There
  the man knocked, and uttered a peculiar whistle. As there ensued no immediate
  answer he knocked and whistled again, whereupon the door was opened; and a
  word or two was passed.</p>

  <p>"How many do you want, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Four."</p>

  <p>"Any to help to carry the half-ankers!"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Well, no odds. I'll carry one and you the t'other. We'll make two
  journeys, that's all. I can't leave Neddy for long, but I'll go with you to
  your house-door."</p>

  <p>Probably the person addressed nodded a reply in the darkness; he made no
  audible answer.</p>

  <p>"Which is it, Mr. Obadiah, rum or brandy?"</p>

  <p>"Brandy."</p>

  <p>"Right you are, then. These are brandy. You won't take three brandies and
  one rum?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"All right, sir; lead the way. It's deuced dark."</p>

  <p>Judith knew what this signified. Some of the householders of Wadebridge
  were taking in their supplies of spirits from the smugglers. Owing to the
  inconvenience of it being unlawful to deal with these men for such goods,
  they had to receive their purchases at night, and with much secrecy. There
  were watchmen at Wadebridge, but on such nights they judiciously patrolled
  another quarter of the town than that which received its supplies. The
  watchmen were municipal officials, and were not connected with the excise,
  had no particular regard for the inland revenue, anyhow, owed no duties to
  the officers of the coast-guard. Their superior was the mayor, and the mayor
  was fond of buying his spirits at the cheapest market.</p>

  <p>Both men disappeared. The door was left open behind them. The opportunity
  Judith had desired had come. Dare she seize it? For a moment she questioned
  her heart, then she resolutely stepped out of the shadow of the Portugal
  laurel, brushed past the patient ass, entered the grounds of Mr.
  Scantlebray's establishment through the open garden-door, and drew behind a
  syringa bush to consider what further step she should take. In another moment
  both men were back.</p>

  <p>"You are sure you don't mind one rum?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Right you are, then; I'll have it for you direct. The other kegs are at
  t'other end of the lane. You come with me, and we'll have 'em down in a
  jiffy."</p>

  <p>Judith heard both men pass out of the door. She looked toward the house.
  There was a light low down in a door opening into the garden or yard where
  she was.</p>

  <p>Not a moment was to be lost. As soon as the last kegs were brought in the
  house-door would be locked, and though she had entered the garden she would
  be unable to penetrate to the interior of the asylum. Without hesitation,
  strong in her earnest purpose to help Jamie to the utmost of her power, and
  grasping at every chance that offered, she hastened, cautiously indeed, but
  swiftly, to the door whence the light proceeded. The light was but a feeble
  one, and cast but a fluttering ray upon the gravel. Judith was careful to
  walk where it could not fall on her dress.</p>

  <p>The whole garden front of the house was now before her. She was in a sort
  of gravelled yard, with some bushes against the walls. The main block of the
  house lay to her right, and the view of it was intercepted by a wall. Clearly
  the garden space was divided, one portion for the house, and another, that
  into which she had entered, for the wing. That long wing rose before her with
  its windows all dark above, and the lower or ground floor also dark. Only
  from the door issued the light, and she saw that a guttering tallow candle
  was set there on the floor.</p>

  <p>Hastily she drew back. She heard feet on the gravel. The men were
  returning, Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray and the smuggler, each laden with a small
  cask of spirits.</p>

  <p>"Right you are," said the man, as he set his keg down in the passage,
  "that's yours, and I could drink your health, sir."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't&mdash;prefer?&mdash;" Mr. Scantlebray made contortions with
  his hands between the candle and the wall, and threw a shadow on the surface
  of plaster.</p>

  <p>"No, thanks sir, I'd prefer a shilling."</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray fumbled in his pockets, grunted "Humph! purse up-stairs."
  Felt again, "No," groped inside the breast of his waistcoat, "another
  time&mdash;not forget."</p>

  <p>The man muttered something not complimentary, and turned to go through the
  yard.</p>

  <p>"Must lock door," said Mr. Obadiah, and went after him. Now was Judith's
  last chance. She took it at once; the moment the backs of the two men were
  turned she darted into the passage and stood back against the door out of the
  flare of the candle.</p>

  <p>The passage was a sort of hall with slated floor, the walls plastered and
  whitewashed at one time, but the wash and plaster had been picked off to
  about five feet from the floor wherever not strongly adhesive, giving a
  diseased and sore look to the wall. The slates of the floor were dirty and
  broken.</p>

  <p>Judith looked along the hall for a place to which she could retreat on the
  return of the proprietor of the establishment. She had entered that portion
  of the building tenanted by the unhappy patients. The meanness of the
  passage, the picked walls, the situation on one side of the comfortable
  residence showed her this. A door there was on the right, ajar, that led into
  the private dwelling-house, but into that Judith did not care to enter. One
  further down on the left probably gave access to some apartment devoted to
  the "pupils," as Mrs. Scantlebray called the patients.</p>

  <p>There was, however, another door that was open, and from it descended a
  flight of brick steps to what Judith conjectured to be the cellars. At the
  bottom a second candle, in a tin candlestick, was guttering and flickering in
  the draught that blew in at the yard door, and descended to this underground
  story. It was obvious to the girl that Mr. Scantlebray was about to carry or
  roll his kegs just acquired down the brick steps to his cellar. For that
  purpose he had set a candle there. It would not therefore do for her, to
  attempt to avoid him, to descend to this lower region. She must pass the door
  that gave access to the cellars, a door usually locked, as she judged, for a
  large iron key stood in the lock, and enter the room, the door of which
  opened further down the passage.</p>

  <p>She was drawing her skirts together, so as to slip past the candle on the
  passage floor for this purpose, when her heart stood still as though she had
  received a blow on it. She heard&mdash;proceeding from somewhere beneath down
  those steps&mdash;a moan, then a feeble cry of "Ju! Where are you? Ju! Ju!
  Ju!"</p>

  <p>She all but did cry out herself. A gasp of pain and horror did escape her,
  and then, without a thought of how she could conceal herself, how avoid
  Scantlebray, she ran down the steps to the cellar.</p>

  <p>On reaching the bottom she found that there were four doors, two of which
  had square holes cut in them, but with iron bars before these openings. The
  door of one of the others, one on the left, was open, and she could see casks
  and bottles. It was a wine and spirit cellar, and the smell of wine issued
  from it.</p>

  <p>She stood panting, frightened, fearing what she might discover, doubting
  whether she had heard her brother's voice or whether she was a prey to fancy.
  Then again she heard a cry and a moan. It issued from the nearest cell on her
  right hand.</p>

  <p>"Jamie! my Jamie!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Ju! Ju!"</p>

  <p>The door was hasped, with a crook let into a staple so that it might, if
  necessary, be padlocked. But now it was simply shut and a wooden peg was
  thrust through the eye of the crook.</p>

  <p>She caught up the candle, and with trembling hand endeavored to unfasten
  the door, but so agitated was she, so blinded with horror, that she could not
  do so till she had put down the candle again. Then she forced the peg from
  its place and raised the crook. She stooped and took up the candle once more,
  and then, with a short breath and a contraction of the breast, threw open the
  door, stepped in, and held up the light.</p>

  <p>The candle flame irradiated what was but a cellar compartment vaulted with
  brick, once whitewashed, now dirty with cobwebs and accumulated dust and damp
  stains. It had a stone shelf on one side, on which lay a broken plate and
  some scraps of food.</p>

  <p>Against the further wall was a low truckle bed, with a mattress on it and
  some rags of blanket. Huddled on this lay Jamie, his eyes dilated with
  terror, and yet red with weeping. His clothes had been removed, except his
  shirt. His long red-gold hair had lost all its gloss and beauty, it was wet
  with sweat and knotted. The boy's face was ghastly in the flickering
  light.</p>

  <p>Judith dropped the candle on the floor, and rushed with outstretched arms,
  and a cry&mdash;piercing, but beaten back on her by the walls and vault of
  the cell&mdash;and caught the frightened boy to her heart.</p>

  <p>"Jamie! O my Jamie! my Jamie!"</p>

  <p>She swayed herself, crying, in the bed, holding him to her, with no
  thought, her whole being absorbed in a spasm of intensest, most harrowing
  pain. The tallow candle was on the slate floor, fallen, melting, spluttering,
  flaming.</p>

  <p>And in the door, holding the brandy keg upon his shoulders, stood, with
  open eyes and mouth, Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; AN UNWILLING PRISONER.</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Obadiah stood open-mouthed staring at the twins clasped
  in each other's arms, unable at first to understand what he saw. Then a
  suspicion entered his dull brain, he uttered a growl, put down the keg, his
  heavy brows contracted, he shut his mouth, drawing in his lips so that they
  disappeared, and he clenched his hands.</p>

  <p>"Wait&mdash;I'll beat you!" he said.</p>

  <p>The upset candle was on the floor, now half molten, with a pond of tallow
  burning with a lambent blue flicker trembling on extinction, then shooting up
  in a yellow flame.</p>

  <p>In that uncertain, changeful, upward light the face of the man looked
  threatening, remorseless, so that Judith, in a paroxysm of fear for her
  brother and herself dropped, on her knee, and caught at the tin candlestick
  as the only weapon of defence accessible. It was hot and burnt her fingers,
  but she did not let go; and as she stood up the dissolved candle fell from it
  among some straw that littered the pavement. This at once kindled and blazed
  up into golden flame.</p>

  <p>For a moment the cell was full of light. Mr. Obadiah at once saw the
  danger. His casks of brandy were hard by&mdash;the fume of alcohol was in the
  air&mdash;if the fire spread and caught his stores a volume of flame would
  sweep up the cellar stair and set his house on fire. He hastily sprang in,
  and danced about the cell stamping furiously at the ignited wisps. Judith,
  who saw him rush forward, thought he was about to strike her and Jamie, and
  raised the tin candlestick in self-defence; but when she saw him engaged in
  trampling out the fire, tearing at the bed to drag away the blankets with
  which to smother the embers, she drew Jamie aside from his reach, sidled,
  with him clinging to her, along the wall, and by a sudden spring reached the
  passage, slammed the door, fastened the hasp, and had the gaoler secured in
  his own gaol.</p>

  <p>For a moment Mr. Scantlebray was unaware that he was a prisoner, so busily
  engaged was he in trampling out the fire, but the moment he did realize the
  fact he slung himself with all his force against the door.</p>

  <p>Judith looked round her. There was now no light in the cellar but the
  feeble glimmer that descended the stair from the candle above. The flame of
  that was now burning steadily, for the door opening into the yard was shut,
  and the draught excluded.</p>

  <p>In dragging Jamie along with her, Judith had drawn forth a scanty blanket
  that was about his shoulders. She wrapped it round the boy.</p>

  <p>"Let me out!" roared Scantlebray. "Don't understand. Fun&mdash;rollicking
  fun."</p>

  <p>Judith paid no attention to his bellow. She was concerned only to escape
  with Jamie. She was well aware that her only chance was by retaining Mr.
  Obadiah where he was.</p>

  <p>"Let me out!" again shouted the prisoner; and he threw himself furiously
  against the door. But though it jarred on its hinges and made the hasp leap,
  he could not break it down. Nevertheless, so big and strong was the man that
  it was by no means improbable that his repeated efforts might start a staple
  or snap a hinge band, and he and the door might come together crashing down
  into the passage between the cells.</p>

  <p>Judith drew Jamie up the steps, and on reaching the top shut the cellar
  door. Below, Mr. Scantlebray roared, swore, shouted, and beat against the
  door; but now his voice, and the sound of his blows were muffled, and would
  almost certainly be inaudible in the dwelling-house. No wonder that Judith
  had not heard the cries of her brother. It had never occurred to her that the
  hapless victim of the keeper of the asylum might be chastised, imprisoned,
  variously maltreated in regions underground, whence no sounds of distress
  might reach the street, and apprise the passers-by that all was not laughter
  within. Standing in the passage or hall above, Judith said:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jamie! where are your clothes?"</p>

  <p>The boy looked into her face with a vacant and distressed expression. He
  could not answer, he did not even understand her question, so stupefied was
  he by his terrors, and the treatment he had undergone.</p>

  <p>Judith took the candle from the floor and searched the hall. Nothing was
  there save Mr. Scantlebray's coat, which he had removed and cast across one
  of the kegs when he prepared to convey them down to his cellar. Should she
  take that? She shook her head at the thought. She would not have it said that
  she had taken anything out of the house, except only&mdash;as that was an
  extreme necessity, the blanket wrapped about Jamie. She looked into the room
  that opened beyond the cellar door. It was a great bare apartment, containing
  only a table and some forms.</p>

  <p>"Jamie!" she said, "we must get away from this place as we are. There is
  no help for it. Do you not know where your clothes were put?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. He clung to her with both arms, as though afraid, if he
  held by but one that she would slip away and vanish, as one drowning,
  clinging to the only support that sustained him from sinking.</p>

  <p>"Come, Jamie! It cannot be otherwise!" She set down the candle, opened the
  door into the yard, and issued forth into the night along with the boy. The
  clouds had broken, and poured down their deluge of warm thunder rain. In the
  dark Judith was unable to find her direction at once, she reached the
  boundary wall where was no door.</p>

  <p>Jamie uttered a cry of pain.</p>

  <p>"What is it, dear?"</p>

  <p>"The stones cut my feet."</p>

  <p>She felt along the wall with one hand till she touched the jamb, then
  pressed against the door itself. It was shut. She groped for the lock. No key
  was in it. She could as little escape from that enclosure as she could enter
  into it from without. The door was very solid, and the lock big and secure.
  What was to be done? Judith considered for a moment, standing in the pouring
  rain through which the lightning flashed obscurely, illumining nothing. It
  seemed to her that there was but one course open to her, to return and obtain
  the key from Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray. But it would be no easy matter to
  induce him to surrender it.</p>

  <p>"Jamie! will you remain at the door? Here under the wall is some shelter.
  I must go back."</p>

  <p>But the boy was frightened at the prospect of being deserted.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;Jamie, will you come back with me to the house?"</p>

  <p>No, he would not do that.</p>

  <p>"I must go for the key, dearest," she said, coaxingly. "I cannot open the
  door, so that we can escape, unless I have the key. Will you do something for
  Ju? Sit here, on the steps, where you are somewhat screened from the rain,
  and sing to me something, one of our old songs&mdash;A jolly hawk and his
  wings were gray? sing that, that I may hear your voice and find my way back
  to you. Oh&mdash;and here, Jamie, your feet are just the size of mine, and so
  you shall pull on my shoes. Then you will be able to run alongside of me and
  not hurt your soles."</p>

  <p>With a little persuasion she induced him to do as she asked. She took off
  her own shoes and gave them to him, then went across the yard to where was
  the house, she discovered the door by a little streak of light below it and
  the well trampled and worn threshold stone. She opened the door, took up the
  candle and again descended the steps to the cellar floor. On reaching the
  bottom, she held up the light and saw that the door was still sound; at the
  square barred opening was the red face of Mr. Scantlebray.</p>

  <p>"Let me out," he roared.</p>

  <p>"Give me the key of the garden door."</p>

  <p>"Will you let me out if I do?"</p>

  <p>"No; but this I promise, as soon as I have escaped from your premises I
  will knock and ring at your front door till I have roused the house, and then
  you will be found and released. By that time we shall have got well
  away."</p>

  <p>"I will not give you the key."</p>

  <p>"Then here you remain," said Judith, and began to reascend the steps. It
  had occurred to her, suddenly, that very possibly the key she desired was in
  the pocket of the coat Mr. Scantlebray had cast off before descending to the
  cellar. She would hold no further communication with him till she had
  ascertained this. He yelled after her "Let me out, and you shall have the
  key." But she paid no attention to his promise. On reaching the top of the
  stairs, she again shut the door, and took up his coat. She searched the
  pockets. No key was within.</p>

  <p>She must go to him once more.</p>

  <p>He began to shout as he saw the flicker of the candle approach. "Here is
  the key, take it, and do as you said." His hand, a great coarse hand, was
  thrust through the opening in the door, and in it was the key she
  required.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said she, "I will do as I undertook."</p>

  <p>She put her hand, the right hand, up to receive the key. In her left was
  the candlestick. Suddenly he let go the key that clinked down on the floor
  outside, and made a clutch at her hand and caught her by the wrist. She
  grasped the bar in the little window, or he would have drawn her hand in,
  dragged her by the arm up against the door, and broken it. He now held her
  wrist and with his strong hand strove to wrench her fingers from their
  clutch.</p>

  <p>"Unhasp the door!" he howled at her.</p>

  <p>She did not answer other than with a cry of pain, as he worked with his
  hand at her wrist, and verily it seemed as though the fragile bones must snap
  under his drag.</p>

  <p>"Unhasp the door!" he roared again.</p>

  <p>With his great fingers and thick nails he began to thrust at and ploughed
  her knuckles; he had her by the wrist with one hand, and he was striving to
  loosen her hold of the bar with the other.</p>

  <p>"Unhasp the door!" he yelled a third time, "or I'll break every bone in
  your fingers!" and he brought his fist down on the side of the door to show
  how he would pound them by a blow. If he did not do this at once it was
  because he dreaded by too heavy a blow to strike the bar and wound himself
  while crushing her hand.</p>

  <p>She could not hold the iron stanchion for more than another
  instant&mdash;and then he would drag her arm in, as a lion in its cage when
  it had laid hold of the incautious visitor, tears him to itself through the
  bars.</p>

  <p>Then she brought the candle-flame up against his hand that grasped her
  wrist, and it played round it. He uttered a scream of pain, and let go for a
  moment. But that moment sufficed. She was free. The key was on the floor. She
  stooped to pick it up; but her fingers were as though paralyzed, she was
  forced to take it with the left hand and leave the candle on the floor. Then,
  holding the key she ran up the steps, ran out into the yard, and heard her
  brother wailing, "Ju! I want you! Where are you, Ju?"</p>

  <p>Guided by his cries she reached the door. The key she put into the lock,
  and with a little effort turned it. The door opened, she and Jamie were
  free.</p>

  <p>The door shut behind them. They were in the dark lane, under a pouring
  rain. But Judith thought nothing of the darkness, nothing of the rain. She
  threw her arms round her brother, put her wet cheek against his, and burst
  into tears.</p>

  <p>"My Jamie! O my Jamie!"</p>

  <p>But the deliverance of her brother was not complete; she must bring him
  back to Polzeath. She could allow herself but a moment for the relief of her
  heart, and then she caught him to her side, and pushed on with him along the
  lane till they entered the street. Here she stood for a moment in
  uncertainty. Was she bound to fulfil her engagement to Mr. Obadiah? She had
  obtained the key, but he had behaved to her with treachery. He had not
  intended the key to be other than a bait to draw her within his clutch, that
  he might torture her into opening the door of his cell. Nevertheless, she had
  the key, and Judith was too honorable to take advantage of him.</p>

  <p>With Jamie still clinging to her she went up the pair of steps to the
  front door, rang the night-bell, and knocked long and loud. Then, all at once
  her strength that had lasted gave way, and she sank on the doorsteps, without
  indeed losing consciousness, but losing in an instant all power of doing or
  thinking, of striving any more for Jamie or for herself.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; A RESCUE.</h2>

  <p class="first">A window overhead was thrown open, and a voice that Judith
  recognized as that of Mrs. Obadiah Scantlebray, called: "Who is
  there?&mdash;what is wanted?"</p>

  <p>The girl could not answer. The power to speak was gone from her. It was as
  though all her faculties, exerted to the full, had at once given way. She
  could not rise from the steps on which she had sunk: the will to make the
  effort was gone. Her head was fallen against the jamb of the door and the
  knot of the kerchief was between her head and the wood, and hurt her, but
  even the will to lift her hands and shift the bandage one inch was not
  present.</p>

  <p>The mill-wheel revolves briskly, throwing the foaming water out of its
  buckets, with a lively rattle, then its movement slackens, it strains, the
  buckets fill and even spill, but the wheel seems to be reduced to
  statuariness. That stress point is but for a moment, then the weight of the
  water overbalances the strain, and whirr! round plunges the wheel, and the
  bright foaming water is whisked about, and the buckets disgorge their
  contents.</p>

  <p>It is the same with the wheel of human life. It has its periods of rapid
  and glad revolutions, and also its moments of supreme tension, when it is all
  but overstrung&mdash;when its movement is hardly perceptible. The strain put
  on Judith's faculties had been excessive, and now those faculties failed her,
  failed her absolutely. The prostration might not last long&mdash;it might
  last forever. It is so sometimes when there has been overexertion; thought
  stops, will ceases to act, sensation dies into numbness, the heart beats
  slow, slower, then perhaps stops finally.</p>

  <p>It was not quite come to that with Judith. She knew that she had rushed
  into danger again, the very danger from which she had just escaped, she knew
  it, but she was incapable of acting on the knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Who is below?" was again called from an upper window.</p>

  <p>Judith, with open eyes, heard that the rain was still falling heavily,
  heard the shoot of water from the roof plash down into the runnel of the
  street, felt the heavy drops come down on her from the architrave over the
  door, and she saw something in the roadway: shadows stealing along the same
  as she had seen before, but passing in a reversed direction. These were again
  men and beasts, but their feet and hoofs were no longer inaudible, they trod
  in the puddles and splashed and squelched the water and mud about, at each
  step. The smugglers had delivered the supplies agreed on, at the houses of
  those who dealt with them, and were now returning, the asses no longer
  laden.</p>

  <p>And Judith heard the door behind her unbarred and unchained and unlocked.
  Then it was opened, and a ray of light was cast into the street, turning
  falling rain-drops into drops of liquid gold, and revealing, ghostly, a
  passing ass and its driver.</p>

  <p>"Who is there? <i>Is</i> anyone there?"</p>

  <p>Then the blaze of light was turned on Judith, and her eyes shut with a
  spasm of pain.</p>

  <p>In the doorway stood Mrs. Scantlebray half-garmented, that is to say with
  a gown on, the folds of which fell in very straight lines from the waist to
  her feet, and with a night-cap on her head, and her curls in papers. She held
  a lamp in her hand, and this was now directed upon the girl, lying, or
  half-sitting in the doorway, her bandaged head leaning against the jamb, one
  hand in her lap, the fingers open, the other falling at her side, hanging
  down the steps, the fingers in the running current of the gutter, in which
  also was one shoeless foot.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;goodness! mercy on us!" exclaimed Mrs. Scantlebray,
  inconsiderately thrusting the lamp close into the girl's face. "It can never
  be&mdash;yet&mdash;surely it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Judith!" exclaimed a deep voice, the sound of which sent a sudden flutter
  through the girl's nerves and pulses. "Judith!" and from out the darkness and
  falling rain plunged a man in full mantle wrapped about him and overhanging
  broad-brimmed hat. Without a word of excuse he snatched the light from Mrs.
  Scantlebray and raised it above Judith's head.</p>

  <p>"Merciful powers!" he cried, "what is the meaning of this! What has
  happened? There is blood here&mdash;blood! Judith&mdash;speak. For heaven's
  sake, speak!"</p>

  <p>The light fell on his face, his glittering eyes&mdash;and she slightly
  turned her head and looked at him. She opened her mouth to speak, but could
  form no words, but the appeal in those dim eyes went to his heart, he thrust
  the lamp roughly back into Mrs. Scantlebray's hand, knelt on the steps,
  passed an arm under the girl, the other about her waist, lifted and carried
  her without a word inside the house. There was a leather-covered ottoman in
  the hall, and he laid her on that, hastily throwing off his cloak, folding
  it, and placing it as a pillow beneath her head.</p>

  <p>Then, on one knee at her side, he drew a flask from his breast pocket, and
  poured some drops of spirit down her throat. The strength of the brandy made
  her catch her breath, and brought a flash of red to her cheek. It had served
  its purpose, helped the wheel of life to turn beyond the stress point at
  which it threatened to stay wholly. She moved her head, and looked eagerly
  about her for Jamie. He was not there. She drew a long breath, a sigh of
  relief.</p>

  <p>"Are you better?" he asked, stooping over her, and she could read the
  intensity of his anxiety in his face.</p>

  <p>She tried to smile a reply, but the muscles of her lips were too stiff for
  more than a flutter.</p>

  <p>"Run!" ordered Captain Coppinger, standing up, "you woman, are you a fool?
  Where is your husband? He is a doctor, fetch him. The girl might die."</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;Captain&mdash;he is engaged, I believe, taking in his
  stores."</p>

  <p>"Fetch him! Leave the lamp here."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Scantlebray groped about for a candle, and having found one,
  proceeded to light it.</p>

  <p>"I'm really shocked to appear before you, Captain, in this state of
  undress."</p>

  <p>"Fetch your husband!" said Coppinger, impatiently.</p>

  <p>Then she withdrew.</p>

  <p>The draught of spirits had acted on Judith and revived her. Her breath
  came more evenly, her heart beat regularly, and the blood began to circulate
  again. As her bodily powers returned, her mind began to work once more, and
  again anxiously she looked about her.</p>

  <p>"What is it you want?" asked Captain Cruel.</p>

  <p>"Where is Jamie?"</p>

  <p>He muttered a low oath. Always Jamie. She could think of no one but that
  silly boy.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly she recalled her position&mdash;in Scantlebray's house, and
  the wife was on the way to the cellars, would find him, release him&mdash;and
  though she knew that Coppinger would not suffer Obadiah to injure her, she
  feared, in her present weakness, a violent scene. She sat up, dropped her
  feet on the floor, and stretched both her hands to the smuggler.</p>

  <p>"Oh, take me! take me from here."</p>

  <p>"No, Judith," he answered. "You must have the doctor to see
  you&mdash;after that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No! no! take me before he comes. He will kill me."</p>

  <p>Coppinger laughed. He would like to see the man who would dare to lay a
  finger on Judith while he stood by.</p>

  <p>Now they heard a noise from the wings of the house at the side that
  communicated with the dwelling by a door that Mrs. Scantlebray had left ajar.
  There were exclamations, oaths, a loud, angry voice, and the shrill tones of
  the woman mingled with the bass notes of her husband. The color that had
  risen to the girl's cheeks left them; she put her hands on Coppinger's breast
  and looking him entreatingly in the eyes, said:</p>

  <p>"I pray you! I pray you!"</p>

  <p>He snatched her up in his arms, drew her close to him, went to the door,
  cast it open with his foot, and bore her out into the rain. There stood his
  mare, Black Bess, with a lad holding her.</p>

  <p>"Judith, can you ride?"</p>

  <p>He lifted her into the saddle.</p>

  <p>"Boy," said he, "lead on gently; I will stay her lest she fall."</p>

  <p>Then they moved away, and saw through the sheet of falling rain the
  lighted door, and Scantlebray in it, in his shirt sleeves shaking his fists,
  and his wife behind him, endeavoring to draw him back by the buckle and strap
  of his waistcoat.</p>

  <p>"Oh, where is Jamie? I wonder where Jamie is?" said Judith, looking round
  her in the dark, but could see no sign of her brother.</p>

  <p>There were straggling houses for half a mile&mdash;a little gap of garden
  or paddock, then a cottage, then a cluster of trees, and an alehouse, then
  hedges and no more houses. A cooler wind was blowing, dispelling the close,
  warm atmosphere, and the rain fell less heavily. There was a faint light
  among the clouds like a watering of satin. It showed that the storm was
  passing away. The lightning flashes were, moreover, at longer intervals,
  fainter, and the thunder rumbled distantly. With the fresher air, some
  strength and life came back to Judith. The wheel though on the turn was not
  yet revolving rapidly.</p>

  <p>Coppinger walked by the horse, he had his arm up, holding Judith, for he
  feared lest in her weakness she might fall, and indeed, by her weight upon
  his hand, he was aware that her power to sustain herself unassisted was not
  come. He looked up at her; he could hardly fail to do so, standing, striding
  so close to her, her wet garments brushing his face; but he could not see
  her, or saw her indistinctly. He had thrust her little foot into the leather
  of his stirrup, as the strap was too long for her to use, and he did not
  tarry to shorten it.</p>

  <p>Coppinger was much puzzled to learn how Judith had come at such an hour to
  the door of Mrs. Obadiah Scantlebray, shoeless, and with wounded head, but he
  asked no questions. He was aware that she was not in a condition to answer
  them.</p>

  <p>He held her up with his right hand in the saddle, and with his left he
  held her foot in the leather. Were she to fall she might drag by the foot,
  and he must be on his guard against that. Pacing in the darkness, holding
  her, his heart beat, and his thoughts tossed and boiled within him. This girl
  so feeble, so childish, he was coming across incessantly, thrown in her way
  to help her, and he was bound to her by ties invisible, impalpable, and yet
  of such strength that he could not break through them and free himself.</p>

  <p>He was a man of indomitable will, of iron strength, staying up this girl,
  who had flickered out of unconsciousness and might slide back into it again
  at any moment, and yet he felt, he knew that he was powerless before
  her&mdash;that if she said to him, "Lie down that I may trample on you," he
  would throw himself in the foul road without a word to be trodden under by
  these shoeless feet. There was but one command she could lay on him that he
  would not perform, and that was "Let me go by myself! Never come near me!"
  That he could not obey. The rugged moon revolves about the earth. Could the
  moon fly away into space were the terrestrial orb to bid it cease to be a
  satellite? And if it did, whither would it go? Into far off space, into outer
  darkness and deathly cold, to split and shiver into fragments in the
  inconceivable frost in the abyss of blackness. And Judith threw a sort of
  light and heat over this fierce, undisciplined man, that trembled in his
  veins and bathed his heart, and was to him a spring of beauty, a summer of
  light. Could he leave her? To leave her would be to be lost to everything
  that had now begun to transform his existence. The thought came over him now,
  as he walked along in silence&mdash;that she might bid him let go, and he
  felt that he could not obey. He must hold her, he must hold her not
  <i>from</i> him on the saddle, not as merely staying her up, but to himself,
  to his heart, as his own, his own forever.</p>

  <p>Suddenly an exclamation from Judith: "Jamie! Jamie!"</p>

  <p>Something was visible in the darkness, something whitish in the hedge. In
  another moment it came bounding up.</p>

  <p>"Ju! oh, Ju! I ran away!"</p>

  <p>"You did well," she said. "Now I am happy. You are saved."</p>

  <p>Coppinger looked impatiently round and saw by the feeble light that the
  boy had come close to him, and that he was wrapped up in a blanket.</p>

  <p>"He has nothing on him," said Judith. "Oh, poor Jamie!"</p>

  <p>She had revived; she was almost herself again. She held herself more
  firmly in the saddle and did not lean so heavily on Coppinger's hand.</p>

  <p>Coppinger was vexed at the appearance of the boy, Jamie; he would fain
  have paced along in silence by the side of Judith. If she could not speak it
  mattered not so long as he held her. But that this fool should spring out of
  the darkness and join company with him and her, and at once awake her
  interest and loosen her tongue, irritated him. But as she was able to speak
  he would address her, and not allow her to talk over his head with Jamie.</p>

  <p>"How have you been hurt?" he asked. "Why have you tied that bandage about
  your head?"</p>

  <p>"I have been cut by a stone."</p>

  <p>"How came that?"</p>

  <p>"A drunken man threw it at me."</p>

  <p>"What was his name?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know."</p>

  <p>"That is well for him." Then, after a short pause, he asked further, "And
  your unshod feet?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I gave my shoes to Jamie."</p>

  <p>Coppinger turned sharply round on the boy. "Take off those shoes instantly
  and give them back to your sister."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;indeed, no," said Judith. "He is running and will cut his poor
  feet&mdash;and I, through your kindness, am riding."</p>

  <p>Coppinger did not insist. He asked: "But how comes the boy to be without
  clothes?"</p>

  <p>"Because I rescued him, as he was, from the Asylum."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;! Is that why you are out at night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I knew he had been taken by the two Mr. Scantlebrays at Wadebridge,
  and I could not rest. I felt sure he was miserable, and was dying for
  me."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;in the night you went to him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But how did you get him his freedom?"</p>

  <p>"I found him locked in the black-hole, in the cellar."</p>

  <p>"And did Scantlebray look on passively while you released him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I let Jamie out, and locked him in, in his place."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;Scantlebray in the black-hole!"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Then Coppinger laughed, laughed long and boisterously. His hand that held
  Judith's foot and the stirrup leather shook with his laughter.</p>

  <p>"By Heaven!&mdash;You are wonderful, very wonderful. Any one who opposes
  you is ill-treated, knocked down and broken, or locked into a black hole in
  the dead of night."</p>

  <p>Judith, in spite of her exhaustion, was obliged to smile.</p>

  <p>"You see, I must do what I can for Jamie."</p>

  <p>"Always Jamie."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Captain Coppinger, always Jamie. He is helpless and must be thought
  for. I am mother, nurse, sister to him."</p>

  <p>"His providence," sneered Coppinger.</p>

  <p>"The means under Providence of preserving him," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"And me&mdash;would you do aught for me?"</p>

  <p>"Did I not come down the cliffs for you?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Heaven forgive me that I forgot that for one moment," he answered, with
  vehemence. "Happy&mdash;happy&mdash;happiest of any in this vile world is the
  man for whom you will think, and scheme and care and dare&mdash;as you do for
  Jamie."</p>

  <p>"There is none such," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I know that," he answered, gloomily, and strode forward with his
  head down.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes had elapsed in silence, and Polzeath was approached. Then
  suddenly Coppinger let go his hold of Judith, caught the rein of Black Bess,
  and arrested her. Standing beside Judith, he said, in a peevish, low
  tone:</p>

  <p>"I touched your hand, and said I was subject to a queen." He bent, took
  her foot and kissed it. "You repulsed me as subject; you are my
  mistress!&mdash;accept me as your slave."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; AN EXAMINATION.</h2>

  <p class="first">Some days had elapsed. Judith had not suffered from her
  second night expedition as she had from the first, but the intellectual
  abilities of Jamie had deteriorated. The fright he had undergone had shaken
  his nerves, and had made him more restless, timid, and helpless than
  heretofore, exacting more of Judith's attention and more trying her
  endurance. But she trusted these ill effects would pass away in time. From
  his rambling talk she had been able to gather some particulars, which to a
  degree modified her opinion relative to the behavior of Mr. Obadiah
  Scantlebray. It appeared from the boy's own account that he had been very
  troublesome. After he had been taken into the wing of the establishment that
  was occupied by the imbeciles, his alarm and bewilderment had grown. He had
  begun to cry and to clamor for his release, or for the presence of his
  sister. As night came on, paroxysms of impotent rage had alternated with fits
  of whining. The appearance of his companions in confinement, some of them
  complete idiots, with half-human gestures and faces, had enhanced his
  terrors. He would eat no supper, and when put to bed in the common dormitory
  had thrown off his clothes, torn his sheets, and refused to lie down; had sat
  up and screamed at the top of his voice. Nothing that could be done, no
  representations would pacify him. He prevented his fellow inmates of the
  asylum from sleeping, and he made it not at all improbable that his cries
  would be overheard by passers-by in the street, or those occupying
  neighboring houses, and thus give rise to unpleasant surmises, and perhaps
  inquiry. Finally, Scantlebray had removed the boy to the place of punishment,
  the Black Hole, a compartment of the cellars, there to keep him till his
  lungs were exhausted, or his reason gained the upper hand, and Judith
  supposed, with some justice, that Scantlebray had done this only, or chiefly,
  because he himself would be up, and about the cellars, engaged in housing his
  supplies of brandy, and that he had no intention of locking the unhappy boy
  up for the entire night, in solitude, in his cellars. He had not left him in
  complete darkness, for a candle had been placed on the ground outside the
  Black Hole door.</p>

  <p>As Judith saw the matter now, it seemed to her that though Scantlebray had
  acted with harshness and lack of judgment there was some palliation for his
  conduct. That Jamie could be most exasperating, she knew full well by
  experience. When he went into one of his fits of temper and crying, it took
  many hours and much patience to pacify him. She had spent long time and
  exhausted her efforts to bring him to a subdued frame of mind on the most
  irrational and trifling occasions, when he had been angered. Nothing answered
  with him then save infinite forbearance and exuberant love. On this occasion
  there was good excuse for Jamie's fit, he had been frightened, and frightened
  out of his few wits. As Judith said to herself&mdash;had she been treated in
  the same manner, spirited off, without preparation, to a strange house,
  confined among afflicted beings, deprived of every familiar
  companion&mdash;she would have been filled with terror, and reasonably so.
  She would not have exhibited it, however, in the same manner as Jamie.</p>

  <p>Scantlebray had not acted with gentleness, but he had not, on the other
  hand, exhibited wanton cruelty. That he was a man of coarse nature, likely on
  provocation to break through the superficial veneer of amiability, she
  concluded from her own experience, and she did not doubt that those of the
  unfortunate inmates of the asylum who overstrained his forbearance met with
  very rough handling. But that he took a malignant pleasure in harassing and
  torturing them, that she did not believe.</p>

  <p>On the day following the escape from the asylum, Judith sent Mr. Menaida
  to Wadebridge with the blanket that had been carried off round the shoulders
  of her brother, and with a request to have Jamie's clothes surrendered. Uncle
  Zachie returned with the garments, they were not refused him, and Judith and
  her brother settled down into the routine of employment and amusement as
  before. The lad assisted Mr. Menaida with his bird skins, talking a little
  more childishly than before, and sticking less assiduously to his task; and
  Judith did her needlework and occasionally played on the piano the pieces of
  music at which Uncle Zachie had hammered ineffectually for many years, and
  she played them to the old man's satisfaction.</p>

  <p>At last the girl ventured to induce Jamie to recommence his lessons. He
  resisted at first, and when she did, on a rainy day, persuade him to set to
  his school tasks, she was careful not to hold him to them for more than a few
  minutes, and to select those lessons which made him least impatient.</p>

  <p>There was a "Goldsmith's Geography," illustrated with copper-plates of
  Indians attacking Captain Cook, the geysers, Esquimaux fishing, etc., that
  always amused the boy. Accordingly, more geography was done during these
  first days of resumption of work than history, arithmetic, or reading. Latin
  had not yet been attempted, as that was Jamie's particular aversion. However,
  the Eton Latin grammar was produced, and placed on the table, to familiarize
  his mind with the idea that it had to be tackled some day.</p>

  <p>Judith had spread the table with lesson-books, ink, slate, and
  writing-copies, one morning, when she was surprised at the entry of four
  gentlemen, two of whom she recognized immediately as the Brothers
  Scantlebray. The other two she did not know. One was thin faced, with red
  hair, a high forehead extending to the crown, with the hair drawn over it,
  and well pomatumed, to keep it in place, and conceal the baldness; the other
  a short man, in knee-breeches and tan-boots, with a red face, and with breath
  that perfumed the whole room with spirits.</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray, senior, came up with both hands extended. "This is
  splendid! How are you? Never more charmed in my life, and ready to impart
  knowledge, as the sun diffuses light. Obadiah, old man, look at your
  pupil&mdash;better already for having passed through your hands. I can see it
  at a glance; there's a brightness, a <i>Je ne sais quoi</i> about him that
  was not there before. Old man, I congratulate you. You have a
  gift&mdash;shake hands."</p>

  <p>The gentlemen seated themselves without invitation. Surprise and alarm
  made Judith forget her usual courtesy. She feared lest the sight of his
  gaolers might excite Jamie. But it was not so. Whether, in his confused mind,
  he did not associate Mr. Obadiah with his troubles on that night of distress,
  or whether his attention was distracted by the sight of so many, was
  doubtful, but Jamie did not seem to be disconcerted; rather, on the contrary,
  he was glad of some excuse for escape from lessons.</p>

  <p>"We are come," said the red-headed man, "at Miss Trevisa's
  desire&mdash;but really, Mr. Scantlebray, for shame of you. Where are your
  manners? Introduce me."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vokins," said Scantlebray, "and the accomplished and charming Miss
  Judith Trevisa, orphing."</p>

  <p>"And now, dear young lady," said the red-headed man, "now, positively, it
  is my turn&mdash;my friend, Mr. Jukes. Jukes, man! Miss Judith Trevisa."</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Vokins coughed into his thin white hand, and said, "We are come,
  naturally&mdash;and I am sure you wish what Miss Trevisa wishes&mdash;to just
  look at your brother, and give our opinion on his health."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he is quite well," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"Ah! you think so, naturally, but we would decide for ourselves, dearest
  young lady, though&mdash;not for the world would we willingly differ from
  you. But, you know, there are questions on which varieties of opinions are
  allowable, and yet do not disturb the most heartfelt friendship. It is so, is
  it not, Jukes?"</p>

  <p>The rubicund man in knee-breeches nodded.</p>

  <p>"Shall I begin, Jukes? Why, my fine little man! What an array of books!
  What scholarship! And at your age, too&mdash;astounding! What age did you say
  you were?" This to Jamie in an insinuating tone. Jamie stared, looked
  appealingly at Judith, and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"We are the same age, we are twins," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"Oh! it is not the right thing to appear anxious to know a lady's age. We
  will put it another way, eh, Jukes?"</p>

  <p>The red-faced man leaned his hands on his stick, his chin on his hands,
  and winked, as in that position he could not nod.</p>

  <p>"Now, my fine little man! When is your birthday? When you have your
  cake&mdash;raisin-cake, eh?"</p>

  <p>Jamie looked questioningly at his sister.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Come, not the day of the month&mdash;but the month, eh?"</p>

  <p>Jamie could not answer.</p>

  <p>"Come now," said the red-headed levy man, stretching his legs before him,
  legs vested in white trousers, strapped down tight. "Come now, my splendid
  specimen of humanity! In which quarter of the year? Between sickle and
  scythe, eh?" He waited, and receiving no answer, pulled out a pocket-book and
  made a note, after having first wetted the end of his pencil. "Don't know
  when he was born. What do you say to that, Jukes? Will you take your
  turn?"</p>

  <p>The man with an inflamed face was gradually becoming purple, as he leaned
  forward on his stick, and said, "Humph! a Latin grammar. Propria qu maribus.
  I remember it, but it was a long time ago I learned it. Now, whipper-snapper!
  How do you get on? Propria qu maribus&mdash;Go on." He waited. Jamie looked
  at him in astonishment. "Come! Tribu&mdash;" again he waited. "Come!
  <i>Tribuntur mascula dicas.</i> Go on." Again a pause. Then with an impatient
  growl. "Ut sunt divorum, Mars, Bacchus, Apollo. This will never do. Go on
  with the Scaramouch, Vokins. I'll make my annotations."</p>

  <p>"He's too hard on my little chap, ain't he?" asked the thin man in ducks.
  "We won't be done. We are not old enough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He is but eighteen," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"He is but eighteen," repeated the red-headed man. "Of course he has not
  got so far as that, but musa, mus."</p>

  <p>Jamie turned sulky.</p>

  <p>"Not musa, mus&mdash;and eighteen years! Jukes, this is serious, Jukes;
  eh, Jukes?"</p>

  <p>"Now look here, you fellows," said Scantlebray, senior. "You are too
  exacting. It's holiday time, ain't it, Orphing? We won't be put upon, not we.
  We'll sport, and frolic, and be joyful. Look here, Scanty, old man, take the
  slate and draw a pictur' to my describing. Now then, Jamie, look at him and
  hearken to me. He's the funniest old man that ever was, and he'll surprise
  you. Are you ready, Scanty?" Mr. Obadiah drew the slate before him, and
  signed with the pencil to Jamie to observe him. The boy was quite ready to
  see him draw.</p>

  <p>"There was once upon a time," began Mr. Scantlebray, senior, "a man that
  lived in a round tower. Look at him, draw it, there you are. That is the
  tower. Go on. And in the tower was a round winder. Do you see the winder,
  Orphing? This man every morning put his hand out of the winder to ascertain
  which way the wind blew. He put it in thus, and drew it out thus. No! don't
  look at me, look at the slate and then you'll see it all. Now this man had a
  large pond, preserved full of fish." Scratch, scratch went the pencil on the
  slate. "Them's the fish," said Scantlebray, senior. "Now below the situation
  of that pond, in two huts, lived a pair of thieves. You see them pokey things
  my brother has drawn? Them's the 'uts. When night set in, these wicked
  thieves came walking up to the pond, see my brother drawing their respective
  courses! And on reaching the pond, they opened the sluice, and whish! whish!
  out poured the water." Scratch, scratch, squeak, squeak, went the pencil on
  the slate. "There now! the naughty robbers went after fish, and got a goose!
  Look! a goo-oose."</p>

  <p>"Where's the goose?" asked Jamie.</p>

  <p>"Where? Before your eyes&mdash;under your nose. That brilliant brother of
  mine has drawn one. Hold the slate up, Scanty."</p>

  <p>"That's not a goose," said Jamie.</p>

  <p>"Not a goose! You don't know what geese are."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," retorted the boy, resentfully, "I know the wild goose and the
  tame one&mdash;which do you call that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, wild goose, of course."</p>

  <p>"It's not one. A goose hasn't a tail like that, nor such legs," said
  Jamie, contemptuously.</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray, senior, looked at Messrs. Vokins and Jukes and shook his
  head. "A bad case. Don't know a goose when he sees it&mdash;and he is
  eighteen."</p>

  <p>Both Vokins and Jukes made an entry in their pocket-books.</p>

  <p>"Now Jukes," said Vokins, "will you take a turn, or shall I?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you, Vokins," answered Jukes, "I haven't recovered <i>propria qu
  maribus</i>, yet."</p>

  <p>"Very well, my interesting young friend. Suppose now we change the subject
  and try arithmetic."</p>

  <p>"I don't want any arithmetic," said Jamie, sulkily.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;come&mdash;now we won't call it by that name; suppose some one
  were to give you a shilling."</p>

  <p>Jamie looked up interested.</p>

  <p>"And suppose he were to say. There&mdash;go and buy sweeties with this
  shilling. Tartlets at three for two pence, and barley-sugar at three
  farthings a stick, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want my shilling back," said Jamie, looking straight into the face of
  Mr. Scantlebray, senior.</p>

  <p>"And that there were burnt almonds at two pence an ounce."</p>

  <p>"I want my shilling," exclaimed the boy, angrily.</p>

  <p>"Your shilling, puff! puff!" said the red-headed man. "This is ideal, an
  ideal shilling, and ideal jam-tarts, almond rock, burnt almonds or what you
  like."</p>

  <p>"Give me back my shilling. I won it fair," persisted Jamie.</p>

  <p>Then Judith, distressed, interfered. "Jamie, dear! what do you mean? You
  have no shilling owing to you."</p>

  <p>"I have! I have!" screamed the boy. "I won it fair of that man there,
  because I made a rabbit, and he took it from me again."</p>

  <p>"Hallucinations," said Jukes.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Vokins.</p>

  <p>"Give me my shilling. It is a cheat!" cried Jamie, now suddenly roused
  into one of his fits of passion.</p>

  <p>Judith caught him by the arm, and endeavored to pacify him.</p>

  <p>"Let go, Ju! I will have my shilling. That man took it away. He is a
  cheat, a thief. Give me my shilling."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid he is excitable," said Vokins.</p>

  <p>"Like all irrational beings," answered Jukes. "I'll make a note. Rising
  out of hallucinations."</p>

  <p>"I will have my shilling," persisted Jamie. "Give me my shilling or I'll
  throw the ink at you."</p>

  <p>He caught up the ink-pot, and before Judith had time to interfere had
  flung it across the table, intending to hit Mr. Scantlebray, senior, but not
  hurt him, and the black fluid was scattered over Mr. Vokins's white
  trousers.</p>

  <p>"Bless my life!" exclaimed this gentleman, springing to his feet, pulling
  out his handkerchief to wipe away the ink, and only smearing it the more over
  his "ducks" and discoloring as well, his kerchief. "Bless my
  life&mdash;Jukes! a dangerous lunatic. Note at once. Clearly comes within the
  act. Clearly."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes all had left, and Judith was endeavoring to pacify her
  irritated brother. His fingers were blackened, and finally she persuaded him
  to go up-stairs and wash his hands clear of the ink.</p>

  <p>Then she ran into the adjoining room to Mr. Menaida. "Oh, dear Mr.
  Menaida!" she said, "what does this mean? Why have they been here?"</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie looked grave and discomposed.</p>

  <p>"My dear," said he. "Those were doctors, and they have been here, sent by
  your aunt, to examine into the condition of Jamie's intellect, and to report
  on what they have observed. There was a little going beyond the law, perhaps,
  at first. That is why they took it so easily when you carried Jamie off. They
  knew you were with an old lawyer; they knew that you or I could sue for a
  writ of Habeas Corpus."</p>

  <p>"But do you really think&mdash;that Aunt Dionysia is going to have Jamie
  sent back to that man at Wadebridge?"</p>

  <p>"I am certain of it. That is why they came here to-day."</p>

  <p>"Can I not prevent it?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think so. If you go to law&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But if they once get him, they will make an idiot or a madman of
  him."</p>

  <p>"Then you must see your aunt and persuade her not to send him there."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; ON A PEACOCK'S FEATHER.</h2>

  <p class="first">As Mr. Menaida spoke, Miss Dionysia Trevisa entered, stiff,
  hard, and when her eyes fell on Judith, they contracted with an expression of
  antipathy. In the eyes alone was this observable, for her face was
  immovable.</p>

  <p>"Auntie!" exclaimed Judith, drawing her into the sitting-room, and
  pressing her to take the arm chair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Auntie! I have so longed to see you&mdash;there have been some
  dreadful men here&mdash;doctors I think&mdash;and they have been teasing
  Jamie, till they had worked him into one of his temper fits."</p>

  <p>"I sent them here, and for good reasons. Jamie is to go back to
  Wadebridge."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;indeed no! auntie! do not say that. You would not say it if you
  knew all."</p>

  <p>"I know quite enough. More than is pleasing to me. I have heard of your
  outrageous and unbecoming conduct. Hoity! toity! To think that a
  Trevisa&mdash;but there you are one only in name&mdash;should go out at
  night, about the streets and lanes, like a common stray. Bless me! you might
  have knocked me down with a touch, when I was told of it."</p>

  <p>"I did nothing outrageous and unbecoming, aunt. You may be sure of that. I
  am quite aware that I am a Trevisa, and a gentlewoman, and something higher
  than that, aunt&mdash;a Christian. My father never let me forget that."</p>

  <p>"Your conduct was&mdash;well I will give it no expletive."</p>

  <p>"Aunt, I did what was right. I was sure that Jamie was unhappy and wanted
  me. I cannot tell you how I knew it, but I was certain of it, and I had no
  peace till I went; and, as I found the garden door open, I went in, and as I
  went in I found Jamie locked up in the cellars, and I freed him. Had you
  found him there, you would have done the same."</p>

  <p>"I have heard all about it. I want no repetition of a very scandalous
  story. Against my will I am burdened with an intolerable obligation, to look
  after an idiot nephew and a niece that is a self-willed and perverse
  Miss."</p>

  <p>"Jamie is no idiot," answered Judith, firmly.</p>

  <p>"Jamie is what those pronounce him to be, who by their age, their
  profession, and their inquiries are calculated to judge better than an
  ignorant girl, not out of her teens."</p>

  <p>"Auntie I believe you have been misinformed. Listen to me, and I will tell
  you what happened. As for those men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Those men were doctors. Perhaps they were misinformed when they went
  through the College of Surgeons, were misinformed by all the medical books
  they have read, were misdirected by all the study of the mental and bodily
  maladies of men they have made, in their professional course."</p>

  <p>"I wish, dear Aunt Dionysia, you would take Jamie to be with you a few
  weeks, talk to him, play with him, go walks with him, and you will never say
  that he is an idiot. He needs careful management, and also a little
  application&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Enough of that theme," interrupted Miss Trevisa, "I have not come here to
  be drawn into an argument, or to listen to your ideas of the condition of
  that unhappy, troublesome, that provoking boy. I wish to heaven I had not the
  responsibility for him, that has been thrust on me, but as I have to exercise
  it, and there is no one to relieve me of it, I must do my best, though it is
  a great expense to me. Seventy pounds is not seventy shillings, nor is it
  seventy pence."</p>

  <p>"Aunt, he is not to go back to the asylum. He <i>must not</i> go."</p>

  <p>"Hoity-toity! <i>must not</i> indeed. You, a minx of eighteen to dictate
  to me! Must not, indeed! You seem to think that you, and not I, are Jamie's
  guardian."</p>

  <p>"Papa entrusted him to me with his last words."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about last words. In his will I am constituted his
  guardian and yours, and as such I shall act as my
  convenience&mdash;conscience I mean, dictates."</p>

  <p>"But, Aunt! Jamie is not to go back to Wadebridge. Aunt! I entreat you! I
  know what that place is. I have been inside it, you have not. And just think
  of Jamie on the very first night being locked up there."</p>

  <p>"He richly deserved it, I will be bound."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Aunt! How could he? How could he?"</p>

  <p>"Of that Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray was the best judge. Why he had to be
  punished you do not know."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do. He cried because the place was strange, and he was among
  strange faces. Aunt&mdash;if you were whipped off to Timbuctoo, and suddenly
  found yourself among savages, and in a rush apron, as the squaw of a black
  chief, or whatever they call their wives in Timbuctoo land, would you not
  scream?"</p>

  <p>"Judith," said Miss Trevisa, bridling up. "You forget yourself."</p>

  <p>"No, Aunt! I am only pleading for Jamie, trying to make you feel for him,
  when he was locked up in an asylum. How would you like it, Aunt, if you were
  snatched away to Barthelmy fair, and suddenly found yourself among tight-rope
  dancers, and Jack Puddings?"</p>

  <p>"Judith, I insist on you holding your tongue. I object to being associated
  even in fancy, with such creatures."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;but Jamie was associated, not in fancy, but in horrible
  reality, with idiots."</p>

  <p>"Jamie goes to Scantlebray's Asylum to-day."</p>

  <p>"Auntie!"</p>

  <p>"He is already in the hands of the brothers Scantlebray."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Auntie&mdash;no&mdash;no!"</p>

  <p>"It is no pleasure to me to have to find the money, you may well believe.
  Seventy pounds is not, as I said, seventy pence, it is not seventy farthings.
  But duty is duty, and however painful and unpleasant and costly, it must be
  performed."</p>

  <p>Then from the adjoining room, "the shop," came Mr. Menaida.</p>

  <p>"I beg pardon for an interruption and for interference," said he. "I
  happen to have overheard what has passed, as I was engaged in the next room,
  and I believe that I can make a proposal which will perhaps be acceptable to
  you, Miss Trevisa, and grateful to Miss Judith."</p>

  <p>"I am ready to listen to you," said Aunt Dionysia, haughtily.</p>

  <p>"It is this," said Uncle Zachie. "I understand that pecuniary matters
  concerning Jamie are a little irksome. Now the boy, if he puts his mind to
  it, can be useful to me. He has a remarkable aptitude for taxidermy. I have
  more orders on my hands than I can attend to. I am a gentleman, not a
  tradesman, and I object to be oppressed&mdash;flattened out&mdash;with the
  orders piled on top of me. But if the boy will help, he can earn sufficient
  to pay for his living here with me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Menaida, dear Mr. Menaida! thank you so much," exclaimed
  Judith.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will allow me to speak," said Miss Trevisa, with asperity. "I
  am guardian, and not you, whatever you may think from certain vague
  expressions breathed casually from my poor brother's lips, and to which you
  have attached an importance he never gave to them."</p>

  <p>"Aunt, I assure you, my dear papa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That question is closed. We will not reopen it. I am a Trevisa. I can't
  for a moment imagine where you got those ideas. Not from your father's
  family, I am sure. Tight-rope dancers and Timbuctoos, indeed!" Then she
  turned to Mr. Menaida, and said, in her hard, constrained voice, as though
  she were exercising great moral control to prevent herself from snapping at
  him with her teeth. "Your proposal is kind and well intentioned, but I cannot
  accept it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Aunt! why not?"</p>

  <p>"That you shall hear. I must beg you not to interrupt me. You are so
  familiar with the manners of Timbuctoo and of Barthelmy Fair, that you forget
  those pertaining to England and polished society." Then, turning to Mr.
  Menaida, she said: "I thank you for your well-intentioned proposal, which,
  however, it is not possible for me to close with. I must consider the boy's
  ulterior advantage, not the immediate relief to my sorely-taxed purse. I have
  thought proper to place Jamie with a person, a gentleman of experience, and
  highly qualified to deal with those mentally afflicted. However much I may
  value you, Mr. Menaida, you must excuse me for saying that firmness is not a
  quality you have cultivated with assiduity. Judith, my niece, has almost
  ruined the boy by humoring him. You cannot stiffen a jelly by setting it in
  the sun, or in a chair before the fire, and that is what my niece has been
  doing. The boy must be isinglassed into solidity by those who know how to
  treat him. Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray is the man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To manufacture idiots, madam, out of simple innocents, it is worth his
  while at seventy pounds a year," said Uncle Zachie, petulantly.</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa looked at him stonily, and said: "Sir! I suppose you know
  best. But it strikes me that such a statement, relative to Mr. Obadiah
  Scantlebray, is actionable. But you know best, being a solicitor."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida winced and drew back.</p>

  <p>Judith leaned against the mantel-shelf, trembling with anxiety and some
  anger. She thought that her aunt was acting in a heartless manner toward
  Jamie, that there was no good reason for refusing the generous offer of Uncle
  Zachie. In her agitation, unable to keep her fingers at rest, the girl played
  with the little chimney ornaments. She must occupy her nervous, twitching
  hands about something; tears of distressed mortification were swelling in her
  heart, and a fire was burning in two flames in her cheeks. What could she do
  to save Jamie? What would become of the boy at the asylum? It seemed to her
  that he would be driven out of his few wits, by terror and ill-treatment, and
  distress at leaving her and losing his liberty to ramble about the cliffs
  where he liked. In a vase on the chimney-piece was a bunch of peacock's
  feathers, and in her agitation, not thinking what she was about, desirous
  only of having something to pick at and play with in her hands, to disguise
  the trembling of the fingers, she took out one of the plumes and trifled with
  it, waving it and letting the light undulate over its wondrous surface of
  gold and green and blue.</p>

  <p>"As long as I have responsibility for the urchin&mdash;&mdash;" said Miss
  Dionysia.</p>

  <p>"Urchin!" muttered Judith.</p>

  <p>"As long as I have the charge I shall do my duty according to my lights,
  though they may not be those of a rush-aproned squaw in Timbuctoo, nor of a
  Jack Pudding balancing a feather on his nose." There was here a spiteful
  glance at Judith. "When my niece has a home of her own&mdash;is settled into
  a position of security and comfort&mdash;then I wash my hands of the
  responsibility; she may do what she likes then&mdash;bring her brother to
  live with her if she chooses and her husband consents&mdash;that will be
  naught to me."</p>

  <p>"And in the mean time," said Judith, holding the peacock's feather very
  still before her, "in the mean time Jamie's mind is withered and
  stunted&mdash;his whole life is spoiled. Now&mdash;now alone can he be given
  a turn aright and toward growth."</p>

  <p>"That entirely depends on you," said Miss Trevisa, coldly. "You know best
  what opportunities have offered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aunt, what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Wait," said Uncle Zachie, rubbing his hands. "My boy Oliver is coming
  home. He has written his situation is a good one now."</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa turned on him with a face of marble. "I entirely fail to see
  what your son Oliver has to do with the matter, more than the man in the
  moon. May I trouble you, as you so deeply interest yourself in our concerns,
  to step outside to Messrs. Scantlebray and that boy, and ask them to bring
  him in here. I have told them what the circumstances are, and they are
  prepared."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida left the room, not altogether unwilling to escape.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Aunt Dionysia, "I am relieved to find that for a minute, we
  are by ourselves, not subjected to the prying and eavesdropping of the
  impertinent and meddlesome. Mr. Menaida is a man who never did good to
  himself or to anyone else in his life, though a man with the best intentions
  under the sun. Now, Judith, I am a plain woman&mdash;that is to say&mdash;not
  plain, but straightforward&mdash;and I like to have everything above board.
  The case stands thus. I, in my capacity as guardian to that boy, am resolved
  to consign him immediately to the asylum, and to retain him there as long as
  my authority lasts, though it will cost me a pretty sum. You do not desire
  that he should go there. Well and good. There is but one way, but that is
  effectual, by means of which you can free Jamie from restraint. Let me tell
  you he is now in the hands of Mr. Obadiah, and gagged that he may not rouse
  the neighborhood with his screams." Miss Trevisa fixed her hard eyes on
  Judith. "As soon as you take the responsibility off me, and on to yourself,
  you do with the boy what you like."</p>

  <p>"I will relieve you at once."</p>

  <p>"You are not in a condition to do so. As soon as I am satisfied that your
  future is secure, that you will have a house to call your own, and a
  certainty of subsistence for you both&mdash;then I will lay down my
  charge."</p>

  <p>"And you mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean that you must first accept Captain Coppinger, who has been good
  enough to find you not intolerable. He is&mdash;in this one
  particular&mdash;unreasonable, however, he is what he is, in this matter. He
  makes you the offer, gives you the chance. Take it, and you provide Jamie and
  yourself with a home, he has his freedom, and you can manage or mismanage him
  as you list. Refuse the chance and Jamie is lodged in Mr. Scantlebray's
  establishment within an hour."</p>

  <p>"I cannot decide this on the spur of the moment."</p>

  <p>"Very well. You can let Jamie go provisionally to the asylum&mdash;and
  stay there till you have made up your mind."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;Aunt! Never, never!"</p>

  <p>"As you will." Miss Trevisa shrugged her shoulders, and cast a glance at
  her niece like a dagger-stab.</p>

  <p>"Auntie&mdash;I am but a child."</p>

  <p>"That may be. But there are times when even children must decide momentous
  questions. A boy as a child decides on his profession, a girl&mdash;may
  be&mdash;on her marriage."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear Auntie! Do leave Jamie here for, say a fortnight, and in a
  fortnight from to-day you shall have my answer."</p>

  <p>"No," answered Miss Trevisa, "I also must decide as to my future, for your
  decision affects not Jamie only but me also."</p>

  <p>Judith had listened in great self-restraint, holding the feather before
  her. She held it between thumb and forefinger of both hands, not concerning
  herself about it, and yet with her eyes watching the undulations from the end
  of the quill to the deep blue eye set in a halo of gold at the further end,
  and the feather undulated with every rise and fall of her bosom.</p>

  <p>"Surely, Auntie! You cannot wish me to marry Cruel Coppinger?"</p>

  <p>"I have no wishes one way or the other. Please yourself."</p>

  <p>"But, Auntie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You profess to be ready to do all you can for Jamie and yet hesitate
  about relieving me of an irksome charge, and Jamie of what you consider
  barbarous treatment."</p>

  <p>"You cannot be serious&mdash;<i>I</i> to marry Captain Cruel!"</p>

  <p>"It is a serious offer."</p>

  <p>"But papa!&mdash;what would he say?"</p>

  <p>"I never was in a position to tell his thoughts and guess what his words
  would be."</p>

  <p>"But, Auntie&mdash;he is such a bad man."</p>

  <p>"You know a great deal more about him than I do, of course."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;he is a smuggler, I do know that."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;and what of that. There is no crime in that."</p>

  <p>"It is not an honest profession. They say, too, that he is a wrecker."</p>

  <p>"They say!&mdash;who say? What do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, but I am not likely to trust my future to a man of whom such
  tales are told. Auntie! Would you, supposing that you were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will have none of your suppositions, I never did wear a rush apron, nor
  act as Jack Pudding."</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;Captain Cruel of all men."</p>

  <p>"Is he so hateful to you?"</p>

  <p>"Hateful&mdash;no; but I cannot like him. He has been kind,
  but&mdash;somehow I can't think of him as&mdash;as&mdash;as a man of our
  class and thoughts and ways, as one worthy of my own, own papa. No&mdash;it
  is impossible, I am still a child."</p>

  <p>She took the end of the peacock's feather, the splendid eye lustrous with
  metallic beauty, and bowed the plume without breaking it, and, unconscious of
  what she was doing, stroked her lips with it. What a fragile fine quill that
  was on which hung so much beauty? and how worthless the feather would be when
  that quill was broken. And so with her&mdash;her fine, elastic, strong
  spirit, that when bowed sprang to its uprightness the moment the pressure was
  withdrawn; that on which all her charm, her beauty hung.</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger has, surely, never asked you to put this alternative to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I do it myself. As you are a child, you are unfit to take charge
  of your brother. When you are engaged to be married you are a woman; I shift
  my load on you then."</p>

  <p>"And you wish it?"</p>

  <p>"I repeat I have no wishes in the matter."</p>

  <p>"Give me time to consider."</p>

  <p>"No. It must be decided now&mdash;that is to say if you do not wish Jamie
  to be taken away. Don't fancy I want to persuade you; but I want to be
  satisfied about my own future. I shall not remain in Pentyre with you. As you
  enter by the front door, I leave by the back."</p>

  <p>"Where will you go?"</p>

  <p>"That is my affair."</p>

  <p>Then in at the door came the two Scantlebrays and Jamie between them,
  gagged and with his hands bound behind his back. He had run out, directly his
  examination was over, and had been secured, almost without resistance, so
  taken by surprise was he, and reduced to a condition of helplessness.</p>

  <p>Judith leaned against the mantel-shelf, with every tinge of color gone out
  of her cheeks. Jamie's frightened eyes met hers, and he made a slight
  struggle to speak, and to escape to her.</p>

  <p>"You have a close conveyance ready for your patient?" asked Aunt Dionysia
  of the brothers.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, a very snug little box on wheels. Scanty and I will sit with our
  young man, to prevent his feeling dull, you know."</p>

  <p>"You understand, gentlemen, what I told you, that in the deciding whether
  the boy is to go with you or not, I am not the only one to be considered. If
  I have my will, go he shall, as I am convinced that your establishment is the
  very place for him; but my niece, Miss Judith, has at her option the chance
  of taking the responsibility for the boy off my shoulders, and if she chooses
  to do that, why then, I fear she will continue to spoil him, as she has done
  heretofore."</p>

  <p>"It has cost us time and money," said Scantlebray, senior.</p>

  <p>"And you shall be paid, whichever way is decided," said Miss Trevisa.
  "Every thing now rests with my niece."</p>

  <p>Judith seemed as one petrified. One hand was on her bosom, staying her
  heart, the other held the peacock's feather before her, horizontally. Every
  particle of color had deserted, not her face only, but her hands as well. Her
  eyes were sunless, her lips contracted and livid. She was motionless as a
  parian statue, she hardly seemed to breathe. She perfectly understood what
  her aunt had laid upon her, her bodily sensations were dead whilst a conflict
  of ideas raged in her brain. She was the arbiter of Jamie's fate. She did not
  disguise from herself that if consigned to the keeper of the asylum, though
  only for a week or two, he would not leave his charge the same as he entered.
  And what would it avail her or him to postpone the decision a week or a
  fortnight.</p>

  <p>The brothers Scantlebray knew nothing of the question agitating her, but
  they saw that the determination at which she was resolving was one that cost
  her all her powers. Mr. Obadiah's heavy mind did not exert itself to probe
  the secret, but the more eager intellect of his elder brother was alert, and
  wondering what might be the matter that so affected the girl, and made it so
  difficult for her to pronounce the decision. The hard eyes of Miss Trevisa
  were fixed on her. Judith's answer would decide her future&mdash;on it
  depended Othello Cottage, and an annuity of fifty pounds. Jamie looked
  through a veil of tears at his sister, and never for a moment turned them
  from her, from the moment of his entry into the room. Instinctively the boy
  felt that his freedom and happiness depended on her.</p>

  <p>One or the other must be sacrificed. That Judith saw Jamie was dull of
  mind, but there were possibilities of development in it. And, even if he
  remained where he was, he was happy, happy and really harmless, if a little
  mischievous; an offer had been made which was likely to lead him on into
  industrious ways, and to teach him application. He loved his liberty, loved
  it as does the gull. In an asylum he would pine, his mind become more
  enfeebled, and he would die. But then&mdash;what a price must be paid to save
  him? Oh, if she could have put the question to her father. But she had none
  to appeal to for advice. If she gave to Jamie liberty and happiness, it was
  at the certain sacrifice of her own. But there was no evading the decision,
  one or the other must go.</p>

  <p>She stretched forth the peacock's feather, laid the great indigo blue eye
  on the bands that held Jamie, on his gagged lips, and said: "Let him go."</p>

  <p>"You agree!" exclaimed Miss Trevisa.</p>

  <p>Judith doubled the peacock's feather and broke it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30"></a>XXX. &mdash; THROUGH THE TAMARISKS.</h2>

  <p class="first">For some time after Judith had given her consent, and had
  released Jamie from the hands of the Scantlebrays, she remained still and
  white. Uncle Zachie missed the music to which he had become used, and
  complained. She then seated herself at the piano, but was distraught, played
  badly, and the old bird-stuffer went away grumbling to his shop.</p>

  <p>Jamie was happy, delighted not to be afflicted with lessons, and forgot
  past troubles in present pleasures. That the recovery of his liberty had been
  bought at a heavy price, he did not know, and would not have appreciated it
  had he been told the sacrifice Judith had been ready to make for his
  sake.</p>

  <p>In the garden behind the cottage was an arbor, composed of half a boat set
  up, that is to say, an old boat sawn in half, and erected so that it served
  as a shelter to a seat, which was fixed into the earth on posts. From one
  side of this boat a trellis had been drawn, and covered with eschalonia, and
  a seat placed here as well, so that in this rude arbor it was possible for
  more than one to find accommodation. Here Judith and Jamie often sat; the
  back of the boat was set against the prevailing wind from the sea, and on
  this coast the air is unusually soft at the same time that it is bracing,
  enjoyable wherever a little shelter is provided against its violence. For
  violent it can be, and can buffet severely, yet its blows are those of a
  pillow.</p>

  <p>Here Judith was sitting one afternoon, alone, lost in a dream, when Uncle
  Zachie came into the garden with his pipe in his mouth, to stretch his legs,
  after a few minutes' work at stuffing a cormorant.</p>

  <p>In her lap lay a stocking Judith was knitting for her brother, but she had
  made few stitches, and yet had been an hour in the summer-house. The garden
  of Mr. Menaida was hedged off from a neighbor's grounds by a low wall of
  stone and clay and sand, in and out of which grew roughly strong tamarisks
  now in their full pale pink blossom. The eyes of Judith had been on these
  tamarisks, waving like plumes in the sea-air, when she was startled from her
  reverie by the voice of Uncle Zachie.</p>

  <p>"Why, Miss Judith! What is the matter with you? Dull, eh? Ah&mdash;wait a
  bit, when Oliver comes home we shall have mirth. He is full of merriment. A
  bright boy and a good son; altogether a fellow to be proud of, though I say
  it. He will return at the fall."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it, Mr. Menaida. You have not seen him for many
  years."</p>

  <p>"Not for ten."</p>

  <p>"It will be a veritable feast to you. Does he remain long in England?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say. If his employers find work for him at home, then at home he
  will tarry, but if they consider themselves best served by him at Oporto,
  then to Portugal must he return."</p>

  <p>"Will you honor me by taking a seat near me&mdash;under the trellis?"
  asked Judith. "It will indeed be a pleasure to me to have a talk with you;
  and I do need it very sore. My heart is so full that I feel I must spill some
  of it before a friend."</p>

  <p>"Then indeed I will hold out both hands to catch the sweetness."</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;it is bitter, not sweet, bitter as gall, and briny as the
  ocean."</p>

  <p>"Not possible; a little salt gives savor."</p>

  <p>She shook her head, took up the stocking, did a couple of stitches, and
  put it down again. The sea-breeze that tossed the pink bunches of tamarisk
  waved stray tresses of her red-gold hair, but somehow the brilliancy, the
  burnish, seemed gone from it. Her eyes were sunken, and there was a greenish
  tinge about the ivory white surrounding her mouth.</p>

  <p>"I cannot work, dear Mr. Menaida; I am so sorry that I should have played
  badly that sonata last night. I knew it fretted you, but I could not help
  myself, my mind is so selfishly directed that I cannot attend to anything
  even of Beethoven's in music, nor to stocking-knitting even for Jamie."</p>

  <p>"And what are the bitter&mdash;briny thoughts?"</p>

  <p>Judith did not answer at once, she looked down into her lap, and Mr.
  Menaida, whose pipe was choked, went to the tamarisks and plucked a little
  piece, stripped off the flower and proceeded to clear the tube with it.</p>

  <p>Presently, while Uncle Zachie's eyes were engaged on the pipe, Judith
  looked up, and said hastily, "I am very young, Mr. Menaida."</p>

  <p>"A fault in process of rectification every day," said he, blowing through
  the stem of his pipe. "I think it is clear now."</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;young to be married."</p>

  <p>"To be married! Zounds!" He turned his eyes on her in surprise, holding
  the tamarisk spill in one hand and the pipe in the other, poised in the
  air.</p>

  <p>"You have not understood that I got Jamie off the other day only by taking
  full charge of him upon myself and relieving my aunt."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;good gracious, you are not going to marry your brother."</p>

  <p>"My aunt would not transfer the guardianship to me unless I were qualified
  to undertake and exercise it properly, according to her ideas, and that could
  be only by my becoming engaged to be married to a man of substance."</p>

  <p>"Goodness help me! what a startlement! And who is the happy man to be? Not
  Scantlebray, senior, I trust, whose wife is dying."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"Cruel Coppinger!" Uncle Zachie put down his pipe so suddenly on the bench
  by him that he broke it. "Cruel Coppinger! never!"</p>

  <p>She said nothing to this, but rose and walked, with her head down, along
  the bank, and put her hands among the waving pink bunches of tamarisk bloom,
  sweeping the heads with her own delicate hand as she passed. Then she came
  back to the boat arbor and reseated herself.</p>

  <p>"Dear me! Bless my heart! I could not have credited it," gasped Mr.
  Menaida, "and I had such different plans in my head&mdash;but there, no more
  about them."</p>

  <p>"I had to make my election whether to take him and qualify to become
  Jamie's guardian, or refrain, and then he would have been snatched away and
  imprisoned in that odious place again."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Miss Judith&mdash;" the old man was so agitated that he did
  not know what he was about; he put the stick of tamarisk into his mouth in
  place of his pipe, and took it out to speak, put down his hand, picked up the
  bowl of his pipe, and tapped the end of the tamarisk spill with that; "mercy
  save me! What a world we do live in. And I had been building for you a
  castle&mdash;not in Spain, but in a contiguous country&mdash;who'd have
  thought it? And Cruel Coppinger, too! Upon my soul I don't want to say I am
  sorry for it, and I can't find in my heart to say I'm glad."</p>

  <p>"I do not expect that you will be glad&mdash;not if you have any love for
  me."</p>

  <p>The old man turned round, his eyes were watering and his face
  twitching.</p>

  <p>"I have, Heaven knows! I have&mdash;yes&mdash;I mean Miss Judith."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Menaida," said the girl, "you have been so kind, so considerate, that
  I should like to call you what every one else does&mdash;when speaking of you
  to one another&mdash;not to your face&mdash;Uncle Zachie."</p>

  <p>He put out his hand, it was shaking, and caught hers. He put the ends of
  the fingers to his lips; but he kept his face averted, and the water that had
  formed in his eyes ran down his cheeks. He did not venture to speak. He had
  lost command over his voice.</p>

  <p>"You see, uncle, I have no one of whom to ask counsel. I have only aunt,
  and she&mdash;somehow&mdash;I feel that I cannot go to her, and get from her
  the advice best suited to me. Now papa is dead I am entirely alone, and I
  have to decide on matters most affecting my own life, and that of Jamie. I do
  so crave for a friend who could give me an opinion&mdash;but I have no one,
  if you refuse."</p>

  <p>He pressed her hand.</p>

  <p>"Not that now I can go back from my word. I have passed that to Aunt
  Dionysia, and draw back I may not; but somehow, as I sit and think, and
  think, and try to screw myself up to the resolution that must be reached of
  giving up my hand and my whole life into the power of&mdash;of that man, I
  cannot attain to it. I feel like one who is condemned to cast himself down a
  precipice and shrinks from it, cannot make up his mind to spring, but draws
  back after every run made to the edge. Tell me&mdash;uncle&mdash;tell me
  truly, what do you think about Captain Coppinger? What do you know about him?
  Is he a very wicked man?"</p>

  <p>"You ask me what I think, and also what I know," said Mr. Menaida,
  releasing her hand. "I know nothing, but I have my thoughts."</p>

  <p>"Then tell me what you think."</p>

  <p>"As I have said, I know nothing. I do not know whence he comes. Some say
  he is a Dane, some that he is an Irishman. I cannot tell, I know nothing, but
  I think his intonation is Irish, and I have heard that there is a family of
  that name in Ireland. But this is all guesswork. One thing I do know, he
  speaks French like a native. Then, as to his character, I believe him to be a
  man of ungovernable temper, who, when his blood is roused will stick at
  nothing. I think him a man of very few scruples. But he has done liberal
  things&mdash;he is open-handed, that all say. A hard liver, and with a rough
  tongue, and yet with some of the polish of a gentleman; a man with the
  passions of a devil, but not without in him some sparks of divine light. That
  is what I think him to be. And if you ask me further, whether I think him a
  man calculated to make you happy&mdash;I say decidedly that he is not."</p>

  <p>Rarely before in his life had Mr. Menaida spoken with such decision.</p>

  <p>"He has been kind to me," said Judith. "Very kind."</p>

  <p>"Because he is in love with you."</p>

  <p>"And gentle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Have you ever done aught to anger him!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I threw him down and broke his arm and collar-bone."</p>

  <p>"And won his heart by so doing."</p>

  <p>"Uncle Zachie, he is a smuggler."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;there is no doubt about that."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose if I were to entreat him that he would abandon smuggling?
  I have already had it in my heart to ask him this, but I could not bring the
  request over my lips."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt if you asked him to throw up his smuggling that he would
  promise to do so. Whether he would keep his promise is another matter. Many a
  girl has made her lover swear to give up gambling, and on that understanding
  has married him; but I reckon none have been able to keep their husbands to
  the engagement. Gambling, smuggling, and poaching, my dear, are in the blood.
  A man brings the love of adventure, the love of running a risk, into the
  world with him. If I had been made by my wife to swear when I married never
  to touch a musical instrument, I might out of love for her have sworn, but I
  could not have kept my oath. And you&mdash;if you vowed to keep your fingers
  from needle and thread, and saw your gown in rags, or your husband's linen
  frayed&mdash;would find an irresistible itch in the finger ends to mend and
  hem, and you would do it, in spite of your vows. So with a gambler, a
  poacher, and a smuggler, the instinct, the passion is in them and is
  irresistible. Don't impose any promise on Captain Cruel, it will not
  influence him."</p>

  <p>"They tell me he is a wrecker."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by a wrecker! We are all wreckers, after a storm, when a
  merchantman has gone to pieces on the rocks, and the shore is strewn with
  prizes. I have taken what I could, and I see no harm in it. When the sea
  throws treasures here and there, it is a sin not to take them up and use them
  and be thankful."</p>

  <p>"I do not mean that. I mean that he has been the means of luring ships to
  their destruction."</p>

  <p>"Of that I know nothing. Stories circulate whenever there is a wreck not
  in foul weather or with a wind on shore. But who can say whether they be true
  or false?"</p>

  <p>"And about that man, Wyvill. Did he kill him?"</p>

  <p>"There also I can say nothing, because I know nothing. All that can be
  said about the matter is that the Preventive man Wyvill was found at
  sea&mdash;or washed ashore without his head. A shark may have done it, and
  sharks have been found off our coast. I cannot tell. There is not a shadow of
  evidence that could justify an indictment. All that can be stated that makes
  against Coppinger is that the one is a smuggler, the other was a Preventive
  man, and that the latter was found dead and with his head off, an unusual
  circumstance, but not sufficient to show that he had been decapitated by any
  man, nor that the man who decapitated him was Coppinger."</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Menaida started up: "And&mdash;you sell yourself to this man for
  Jamie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, uncle, to make a man of Jamie."</p>

  <p>"On the chance, Judith, on the very doubtful chance of making a man of
  Jamie, you rush on the certainty of making a ruin of yourself. That
  man&mdash;that Coppinger to be trusted with you! A fair little vessel, richly
  laden, with silken sail, and cedar sides, comes skimmering over the sea,
  and&mdash;Heaven forgive me if I judge wrongly&mdash;but I think he is a
  wrecker, enticing, constraining you on to the reefs where you will break up,
  and all your treasures will&mdash;not fall to him&mdash;but sink; and all
  that will remain of you will be a battered and broken hull, and a draggled
  discolored sail. I cannot&mdash;I cannot endure the thought."</p>

  <p>"Yet it must be endured, faced and endured by me," said Judith. "You are a
  cruel comforter, Uncle Zachie. I called you to encourage me, and you cast me
  down; to lighten my load, and you heap more on."</p>

  <p>"I can do no other," gasped Mr. Menaida. Then he sprang back, with open
  mouth, aghast. He saw Cruel Coppinger on the other side of the hedge, he had
  put his hands to the tamarisk bushes, and thrust them apart and was looking
  through.</p>

  <p>"Goldfish!" called Captain Coppinger, "Goldfish, come!"</p>

  <p>Judith knew the voice and looked in the direction whence it came, and saw
  the large hands of Coppinger holding back the boughs of tamarisk, his dark
  face in the gap. She rose at once and stepped toward him.</p>

  <p>"You are ill," he said, fixing his sombre eyes on her.</p>

  <p>"I am not ill in body. I have had much to harass my mind."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that Wadebridge business."</p>

  <p>"What has sprung out of it?"</p>

  <p>"Shall I come to you, or will you to me!&mdash;through the tamarisks?"</p>

  <p>"As you will, Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"Come, then&mdash;up on to the hedge and jump&mdash;I will catch you in my
  arms. I have held you there ere this."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have taken me up, now must I throw&mdash;&mdash;" She did not
  finish the sentence; she meant, must she voluntarily throw herself into his
  arms?</p>

  <p>She caught hold of the bushes and raised herself to the top of the
  hedge.</p>

  <p>"By Heaven!" said he. "The tamarisk flowers have more color in them than
  your face."</p>

  <p>She stood on the summit of the bank, the tamarisks rising to her knees,
  waving in the wind about her. Must she resign herself to that man of whom she
  knew so little, whom she feared so greatly? There was no help for it. She
  must. He held out his arms. She sprang, and he caught her.</p>

  <p>"I have you now," he said, with a laugh of triumph. "You have come to me,
  and I will never give you up."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; AMONG THE SAND-HEAPS.</h2>

  <p class="first">Coppinger held her in his arms, shook her hair out that it
  streamed over his arm, and looked into her upturned face. "Indeed you are
  light, lighter than when I bore you in my arms before; and you are thin and
  white, and the eyes, how red. You have been crying. What! this spirit, strong
  as a steel spring, so subdued that it gives way to weeping!"</p>

  <p>Judith's eyes were closed against the strong light from the sky above, and
  against the sight of his face bent over hers, and the fire glint of his eyes,
  dark as a thundercloud and as charged with lightnings. And now there was a
  flashing of fire from them, of love and pride and admiration. The strong man
  trembled beneath his burden in the vehemence of his emotion. The boiling and
  paining of his heart within him, as he held the frail child in his arms, and
  knew she was to be his own, his own wholly, in a short space. It was for the
  moment to him as though all earth and sea and heaven were dissolved with
  nebulous chaos, and the only life&mdash;the only pulses in the
  universe&mdash;were in him and the little creature he held to his breast. He
  looked into her face, down on her as Vesuvius must have looked down on
  lovely, marble, white Pompeii, with its gilded roofs and incense-scented
  temples, and restrained itself, as long as restrain its molten heart it
  could, before it poured forth its fires and consumed the pearly city lying in
  its arms.</p>

  <p>He looked at her closed eyelids with the long golden lashes resting on the
  dark sunken dip beneath, at the delicate mouth drawn as with pain, at the
  white temples in which slowly throbbed the blue veins, at the profusion of
  red-gold hair streaming over his arm and almost touching the ground.</p>

  <p>She knew that his eyes&mdash;on fire&mdash;were on her, and she dared not
  meet them, for there would be a shrinking&mdash;from him, no responsive leap
  of flame from hers.</p>

  <p>"Shall I carry you about like this!" he asked. "I could and I would, to
  the world's end, and leap with you thence into the unfathomed abyss."</p>

  <p>Her head, leaning back on his arm, with the gold rain falling from it,
  exposed her long and delicate throat of exquisite purity of tint and beauty
  of modelling, and as it lay a little tuft of pink tamarisk blossom, brushed
  off in her lap into his arms, and then caught in the light edging of her
  dress, at the neck.</p>

  <p>"And you come to me of your own will?" he said.</p>

  <p>Then Judith slightly turned her head to avoid his eyes, and said, "I have
  come&mdash;it was unavoidable. Let me down, that we may speak together."</p>

  <p>He obeyed with reluctance. Then, standing before him, she bound up and
  fastened her hair.</p>

  <p>"Look!" said he, and threw open his collar. A ribbon was tied about his
  throat. "Do you see this?" He loosed the band and held it to her. One
  delicate line of gold ran along the silk, fastened to it by threads at
  intervals. "Your own hair. The one left with me when you first heard me speak
  of my heart's wish, and you disdained me and went your way. You left me that
  one hair, and that one hair I have kept wound round my neck ever since, and
  it has seemed to me that I might still have caught my goldfish, my saucy
  goldfish that swam away from my hook at first."</p>

  <p>Judith said calmly; "Let us walk together somewhere&mdash;to St. Enodoc,
  to my father's grave, and there, over that sand-heap we will settle what must
  be settled."</p>

  <p>"I will go with you where you will. You are my Queen, I your
  subject&mdash;it is my place to obey."</p>

  <p>"The subject has sometimes risen and destroyed the Queen; it has been so
  in France."</p>

  <p>"Yes, when the subject has been too hardly treated, too down-trodden, not
  allowed to look on and adore the Queen."</p>

  <p>"And," said Judith further, "let us walk in silence, allow me the little
  space between here and my father's grave to collect my thoughts, bear with me
  for that short distance."</p>

  <p>"As you will. I am your slave, as I have told you, and you my mistress
  have but to command."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but the slave sometimes becomes the master, and then is all the more
  tyrannous because of his former servitude."</p>

  <p>So they walked together, yet apart, from Polzeath to St. Enodoc, neither
  speaking, and it might have been a mourner's walk at a funeral. She held her
  head down, and did not raise her eyes from the ground, but he continued to
  gaze on her with a glow of triumph and exultation in his face.</p>

  <p>They reached at length the deserted church, sunken in the sands; it had a
  hole broken in the wall under the eaves in the south, rudely barricaded,
  through which the sacred building might be entered for such functions as a
  marriage, or the first part of the funeral office that must be performed in a
  church.</p>

  <p>The roof was of pale gray slate, much broken, folding over the rafters
  like the skins on the ribs of an old horse past work. The church-yard was
  covered with plain sand. Gravestones were in process of being buried like
  those whom they commemorated. Some peeped above the sand, with a fat cherub's
  head peering above the surface. Others stood high on the land side, but were
  banked up by sand toward the sea. Here the church-yard surface was smooth,
  there it was tossed with undulations, according as the sand had been swept
  over portions tenanted by the poor who were uncommemorated with head-stones,
  or over those where the well-to-do lay with their titles and virtues
  registered above them.</p>

  <p>There was as yet no monument erected over the grave of the Reverend Peter
  Trevisa, sometime rector of St. Enodoc. The mound had been turfed over and
  bound down with withes. The loving hands of his daughter had planted some of
  the old favorite flowers from the long walk at the rectory above where he
  lay, but they had not as yet taken to the soil, the sand ill agreed with
  them, and the season of the year when their translation had taken place
  dissatisfied them, and they looked forlorn, drooping, and doubted whether
  they would make the struggle to live.</p>

  <p>Below the church lay the mouths of the Camel, blue between sand-hills,
  with the Doom Bar, a long and treacherous band of shifting sands in the
  midst.</p>

  <p>On reaching the graveyard Judith signed to Captain Coppinger to seat
  himself on a flat tombstone on the south side of her father's grave, and she
  herself leaned against the headstone that marked her mother's tomb.</p>

  <p>"I think we should come to a thorough understanding," she said, with
  composure, "that you may not expect of me what I cannot give, and know the
  reason why I give you anything. You call me Goldfish. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because of your golden hair."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that was not what sprung the idea in your brain, it was
  something I said to you, that you and I stood to each other in the relation
  of bird of prey to fish, belonging to distinct modes of life and manner of
  thinking, and that we could never be to one another in any other relation
  than that, the falcon and his prey, the flame and its fuel, the wreckers and
  the wrecked."</p>

  <p>Coppinger started up and became red as blood.</p>

  <p>"These are strange words," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is the same that I said before."</p>

  <p>"Then why have you given yourself to me?"</p>

  <p>"I have resigned myself to you, as I cannot help myself any more than the
  fish can that is pounced on by the sea-bird, or the fuel that is enveloped by
  the flame, or the ship that is boarded by the wrecker."</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadily; he was quivering with excitement, anger, and
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>"It is quite right that you should know what to expect, and make no more
  demands on me that I am capable of answering. You cannot ask of me that I
  should become like you, and I do not entertain the foolish thought that you
  could be brought to be like me&mdash;to see through my eyes, feel with my
  heart. My dead father lies between us now, and he will ever be between
  us&mdash;he a man of pure life, noble aspirations, a man of books, of high
  principle, fearing God and loving men. What he was he tried to make me.
  Imperfectly, faultily, I follow him, but though unable to be like him, I
  strive after what he showed me should be my ideal."</p>

  <p>"You are a child. You will be a woman, and new thoughts will come to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Will they be good and honorable and contented thoughts? Shall I find
  those in your house?"</p>

  <p>Coppinger did not reply, his brows were drawn together and his face became
  dark.</p>

  <p>"Why, then, have you promised to come to me?"</p>

  <p>"Because of Jamie."</p>

  <p>He uttered an oath, and with his hands clenched the upper stone of the
  tomb.</p>

  <p>"I have promised my aunt that I will accept you, if you will suffer my
  poor brother to live where I live, and suffer me to be his protector. He is
  helpless and must have someone to think and watch for him. My aunt would have
  sent him to Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray's asylum, and that would have been fatal
  to him. To save him from that I said that I would be yours, on the condition
  that my home should be his home. I have passed my word to my aunt, and I will
  not go from it, but that does not mean that I have changed my belief that we
  are unfitted for each other, because we belong to different orders of
  being."</p>

  <p>"This is cold comfort."</p>

  <p>"It is cold as ice, but it is all that I have to give to you. I wish to
  put everything plainly before you now, that there may be no misapprehension
  later, and you may be asking of me what I cannot give, and be angry at not
  receiving what I never promised to surrender."</p>

  <p>"So! I am only accepted for the sake of that boy, Jamie."</p>

  <p>"It is painful for me to say what I do&mdash;as painful as it must be for
  you to hear it, but I cannot help myself. I wish to put all boldly and hardly
  before you before an irrevocable step is taken such as might make us both
  wretched. I take you for Jamie's sake. Were his happiness, his well-being not
  in the scale, I would not take you. I would remain free."</p>

  <p>"That is plain enough," exclaimed Coppinger, setting his teeth, and he
  broke off a piece of the tombstone on which he was half sitting.</p>

  <p>"You will ask of me love, honor, and obedience. I will do my best to love
  you&mdash;like you I do now, for you have been kind and good to me, and I can
  never forget what you have done for me. But it is a long leap from liking to
  loving, still I will try my best, and if I fail it will not be for lack of
  effort. Honor is another matter. That lies in your own power to give. If you
  behave as a good and worthy man to your fellows, and justly toward me, of
  course I shall honor you. I must honor what is deserving of honor, and where
  I honor there I may come to love. I cannot love where I do not honor, so
  perhaps I may say that my heart is in your hands, and that if those hands are
  clean and righteous in their dealings it may become yours some time. As to
  obedience&mdash;that you shall command. That I will render to you frankly and
  fully in all things lawful."</p>

  <p>"You offer me an orange from which all the juice has been squeezed, a nut
  without a kernel."</p>

  <p>"I offer you all I have to offer. Is it worth your while having this?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" said he angrily, starting up, "I will have what I can and wring the
  rest out of you, when once you are mine."</p>

  <p>"You never will wring anything out of me. I give what I may, but nothing
  will I yield to force."</p>

  <p>He looked at her sullenly and said, "A child in years with an old head and
  a stony heart."</p>

  <p>"I have always lived with my father, and so have come to think like one
  that is old," said Judith, "and now, alone in the world, I must think with
  ripened wits."</p>

  <p>"I do not want that precocious, wise soul, if that be the kernel. I will
  have the shell&mdash;the glorious shell. Keep your wisdom and righteousness
  and piety for yourself. I do not value them a rush. But your love I will
  have."</p>

  <p>"I have told you there is but one way by which that may be won. But
  indeed, Captain Coppinger, you have made a great mistake in thinking of me. I
  am not suited to you to make you happy and content; any more than you are
  suited to me. Look out for some girl more fit to be your mate."</p>

  <p>"Of what sort? Come, tell me!" said Coppinger scornfully.</p>

  <p>"A fine, well-built girl, dark-haired, dark-eyed, with cheeks like
  apricots, lively in mood, with nimble tongue, good-natured, not bookish, not
  caring for brush or piano, but who can take a rough word and return it; who
  will not wince at an oath, and shrink away at coarse words flung about where
  she is. All these things you know very well must be encountered by your wife,
  in your house. Did you ever read 'Hamlet,' Captain Coppinger?"</p>

  <p>He made no answer, he was plucking at the slab-cover of the tomb and
  grinding his heels into the sand.</p>

  <p>"In 'Hamlet,' we read of a king poisoned by his queen, who dipped the
  juice of cursed hebenon into his ears, and it curdled all his blood. It is
  the same with the sort of language that is found in your house when your
  seamen are there. I cannot endure it, it curdles my heart&mdash;choose a girl
  who is indifferent."</p>

  <p>"You shall not be subjected to it," said Coppinger, "and as to the girl
  you have sketched&mdash;I care not for her&mdash;such as you describe are to
  be found thick as whortle-berries on a moor. Do you not know that man seeks
  in marriage not his counterpart but his contrast? It is because you are in
  all things different from me that I love you."</p>

  <p>"Then will naught that I have said make you desist?"</p>

  <p>"Naught."</p>

  <p>"I have told you that I take you only so as to be able to make a home for
  Jamie."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And that I do not love you and hardly think I can ever."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And still you will have me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And that by taking me you wreck my life&mdash;spoil my happiness."</p>

  <p>He raised his head, then dropped it again and said, "Yes."</p>

  <p>She remained silent, also looking on the ground. Presently she raised her
  head and said: "I gave you a chance, and you have cast it from you. I am
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"A chance? What chance?"</p>

  <p>"The chance of taking a first step up the ladder in my esteem."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you."</p>

  <p>"Therefore I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"What is your meaning?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger," said Judith, firmly, looking straight into his dark
  face and flickering eyes, "I am very, very sorry. When I told you that I
  accepted your offer only because I could not help myself, because I was a
  poor, feeble orphan, with a great responsibility laid on me, the charge of my
  unfortunate brother; that I only accepted you for his sake when I told you
  that I did not love you, that our characters, our feelings were so different
  that it would be misery to me to become your wife&mdash;that it would be the
  ruin of my life, then&mdash;had you been a man of generous soul, you would
  have said&mdash;I will not force myself upon you, but I will do one thing for
  you, assist you in protecting Jamie from the evil that menaces him. Had you
  said that I would have honored you, and as I said just now, where I honor,
  there I may love. But you could not think such a thought, no such generous
  feeling stirred you. You held me to my bond."</p>

  <p>"I hold you to your bond," exclaimed Coppinger, in loud rage. "I hold you,
  indeed. Even though you can neither love nor honor me, you shall be mine. You
  likened me to a bird of prey that must have its prey or die, to a
  fire&mdash;and that must have its fuel&mdash;to a wrecker, and he must have
  his wreck, I care not. I will have you as mine, whether you love me or
  not."</p>

  <p>"So be it, then," said Judith, sadly. "You had your opportunity and have
  put it from you. We understand each other. The slave is master&mdash;and a
  tyrant."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; A DANGEROUS GIFT.</h2>

  <p class="first">"I do love a proper muddle, cruel bad, I do," said Jump, and
  had what she loved, for the preparations for Judith's marriage threw Mr.
  Menaida's trim cottage into a "proper muddle." There were the cakes to be
  baked, and for a while the interior of the house was pervaded by that most
  delicious aroma of baking bread superior to frangipani, jockey club, and wood
  violet. Then came the dusting, and after that the shaking and beating of the
  rugs and sofa and chairs. Then it was discovered that the ceilings and walls
  would be the better for white and color-wash. This entailed the turning out
  of every thing previously dusted and tidied and arranged. Neither Mr. Menaida
  nor Jump had any other idea of getting things into order than throwing all
  into a muddle in the hopes that out of chaos, exactness and order might
  spring.</p>

  <p>A dressmaker had been engaged and material purchased, for the fabrication
  of a trousseau. This naturally interested Jamie vastly, and Jump paid
  repeated visits to the dressmaker, whilst engaged on her work. On one such
  occasion she neglected the kitchen and allowed some jam to become burnt. On
  another she so interested the needlewoman and diverted her attention from her
  work, whilst cutting out that the latter cut out two right arms to the
  wedding gown. This involved a difficulty, as it was not practicable either to
  turn the one sleeve, and convert it into a left arm, nor to remove Judith's
  left arm and attach it to the right side of her body, and so accommodate her
  to the gown. The mercer at Camelford was communicated with, from whom the
  material had been procured, but he was out of it, he however was in daily
  expectation of a consignment of more of the same stuff. A fortnight later he
  was able to supply the material, sufficient for a left sleeve, but
  unfortunately of a different color. The gown had to be laid aside till some
  one could be found of Judith's size and figure with two right arms, and also
  who wanted a wedding dress, and also would be disposed to take this
  particular one at half the cost of the material, or else to let the gown
  stand over till after the lapse of a century or thereabouts, when the fashion
  would prevail for ladies to wear sleeves of a different substance and color
  from their bodies and skirts.</p>

  <p>"'Taint a sort o' a courtin' as I'd give a thankee for," said Jump. "There
  was Camelford goose fair, and whether he axed her to go wi' him and pick a
  goose I can't tell, but I know her never went. Then o' Sundays they don't
  walk one another out. And he doesn't come arter her to the back garden, and
  she go to him, and no whisperings and kissings. I've listened a score o'
  times a hoping and a wishing to see and hear the likes, and never once as I'm
  a Christian and a female. There were my sister Jane, when she was going to be
  married, her got that hot and blazin' red that I thought it were scarletine,
  but it was naught but excitement. But the young mistress, bless 'ee, her gets
  whiter and colder every day, and I'd say, if such a thing were possible, that
  her'd rather her never was a going to be married. But you see that ain't in
  natur', leastways wi' us females. I tell 'ee I never seed him once put his
  arm round her waist. If this be courtin' among gentlefolks, all I say is
  preserve and deliver me from being a lady."</p>

  <p>It was as Jump, in her vulgar way, put it. Judith alone in the house
  appeared to take no interest in the preparations. It was only after a
  struggle with her aunt that she had yielded to have the wedding in November.
  She had wished it postponed till the spring, but Cruel Coppinger and Aunt
  Dionysia were each for their several ends desirous to have it in the late
  autumn. Coppinger had the impatience of a lover; and Miss Trevisa the desire
  to be free from a menial position and lodged in her new house before winter
  set in. She had amused herself over Othello Cottage ever since Judith had
  yielded her consent, and her niece saw little of her accordingly.</p>

  <p>It suited Coppinger's interest to have a tenant for the solitary cottage,
  and that a tenant who would excite no suspicions, as the house was employed
  as a store for various run goods, and it was understood between him and Miss
  Trevisa, that he was still to employ the garret for the purposes that suited
  him.</p>

  <p>Had Othello Cottage remained long unoccupied, it was almost certain to
  attract the attention of the Preventive men, awake their suspicions, and be
  subjected to a visit. Its position was convenient, it was on the cliff of
  that cove where was the cave in which the smugglers' boats were
  concealed.</p>

  <p>Coppinger visited Polzeath and saw Judith whenever he came to Mr.
  Menaida's house, but his wooing met with no response. She endured his
  attentions, shrinking from the slightest approach to familiarity, and though
  studiously courteous was never affectionate. It would take a heavy charge of
  self-conceit to have made the Captain blind to the fact that she did not love
  him, that in truth she viewed her approaching marriage with repugnance.
  Coppinger was a proud, but not a conceited man, and her coldness and aversion
  aroused his anger, for it galled his pride. Had he been a man of noble
  impulse, he would have released her, as she had already told him, but he was
  too selfish, too bent on carrying out his own will to think of abandoning his
  suit.</p>

  <p>Her lack of reciprocation did not abate his passion, it aggravated it. It
  enlisted his self-esteem in the cause, and he would not give her up, because
  he had set his mind upon obtaining her, and to confess his defeat would have
  been a humiliation insufferable to his haughty spirit. But it was not merely
  that he would not, it was also that he could not. Coppinger was a man who
  had, all his life long, done what he willed, till his will had become in him
  the mainspring of his existence, and drove him to execute his purposes in
  disregard of reason, safety, justice, and opposition. He would eat out his
  own furious heart in impotent rage, if his will were encountered by
  impossibility of execution. And he was of a sanguine temperament. Hitherto
  every opposition had been overthrown before him, therefore he could not
  conceive that the heart of a young girl, a mere child, could stand out
  against him permanently. For a while it might resist, but ultimately it must
  yield, and then the surrender would be absolute, unconditional.</p>

  <p>Every time he came to see her, he came with hopes, almost with confidence,
  that the icy barrier would dissolve, but when in her presence the chill from
  it struck him, numbed his heart, silenced his tongue, deadened his thoughts.
  Yet no sooner was he gone from the house, than his pulses leaped, his brain
  whirled, and he was consumed with mortified pride and disappointed love. He
  could not be rough, passionate or imperious with her. A something he could
  not understand, certainly not define, streamed from her that kept him at a
  distance and quelled his insolence. It was to him at moments as if he hated
  her; but this hate was but the splutter of frustrated love. He recalled the
  words she had spoken to him, and the terms she had employed in speaking of
  the relation in which they stood to each other, the only relations to her
  conceivable in which they could stand to each other, and each such word was a
  spark of fire, a drop of flaming phosphorus on his heart, torturing it with
  pain, and unquenchable. A word once spoken can never be recalled, and these
  words had been thrown red hot at him, had sunk in and continued to consume
  where they had fallen. He was but a rapacious bird and she the prey, he the
  fire and she the fuel, he the wrecker and she the wreck. There could be no
  reciprocity between them, the bird in the talons of the hawk, rent by his
  beak could do no other than shiver and shriek and struggle to be free. The
  fuel could but expect to be consumed to ashes in the flames; and the wrecked
  must submit to the wrecker. He brooded over these similes, he chafed under
  the conviction that there was truth in them, he fought against the idea that
  a return of his love was impossible&mdash;and then his passion raged and
  roared up in a fury that was no other than hatred of the woman who could not
  be his in heart. Then, in another moment, he cooled down, and trusted that
  what he dreaded would not be. He saw before him the child, white as a lily,
  with hair as the anthers of the lily&mdash;so small, so fragile, so weak; and
  he laughed to think that one such, with no experience of life, one who had
  never tasted love, could prove insensible to his devouring passion. The white
  asbestos in the flame glows, and never loses its delicacy and its
  whiteness.</p>

  <p>And Judith was, as Jump observed, becoming paler and more silent as her
  marriage drew on. The repugnance with which she had viewed it instead of
  abating intensified with every day. She woke in the night with a start of
  horror, and a cold sweat poured from her. She clasped her hands over her eyes
  and buried her face in her pillow and trembled, so that the bed rattled. She
  lost all appetite. Her throat was contracted when she touched food. She found
  it impossible to turn her mind to the preparations that were being made for
  her wedding, she suffered her aunt to order for her what she liked, she was
  indifferent when told of the blunder made by the dressmaker in her
  wedding-gown. She could not speak at meals. When Mr. Menaida began to talk,
  she seemed to listen, but her mind was elsewhere. She resumed lessons with
  Jamie, but was too abstracted to be able to teach effectually. A restlessness
  took hold of her and impelled her to be out of doors and alone. Any society
  was painful to her, she could endure only to be alone; and when alone, she
  did nothing save pluck at her dress, or rub her fingers one over the
  other&mdash;the tricks and convulsive movements of one on the point of
  death.</p>

  <p>But she did not yield to her aversion without an effort to accustom
  herself to the inevitable. She rehearsed to herself the good traits she had
  observed in Coppinger, his kindness, his forbearance toward herself, she took
  cognizance of his efforts to win her regard, to afford her pleasure, his
  avoidance of everything that he thought might displease her. And when she
  knew he was coming to visit her, she strove with herself; and formed the
  resolution to break down the coldness, and to show him some of that semblance
  of affection which he might justly expect. But it was in vain. No sooner did
  she hear his step, or the first words he uttered, no sooner did she see him,
  than she turned to stone, and the power to even feign an affection she did
  not possess left her. And when Coppinger had departed, there was stamped red
  hot on her brain the conviction that she could not possibly endure life with
  him.</p>

  <p>She prayed long and often, sometimes by her father's grave, always in bed
  when lying wakeful, tossing from side to side in anguish of mind; often, very
  often when on the cliffs looking out to sea, to the dark, leaden, sullen sea,
  that had lost all the laughter and color of summer. But prayer afforded her
  no consolation. The thought of marriage to such a man, whom she could not
  respect, whose whole nature was inferior to her own, was a thought of horror.
  She could have nerved herself to death by the most excruciating of torments,
  but for this, not all the grace of heaven could fortify her.</p>

  <p>To be his mate, to be capable of loving him, she must descend to his
  level, and that she neither could nor would do. His prey, his fuel, his
  wreck&mdash;that she must become, but she could be nothing else&mdash;nothing
  else. As the day of her marriage approached her nervous trepidation became so
  acute that she could hardly endure the least noise. A strange footfall
  startled her and threw her into a paroxysm of trembling. The sudden opening
  of a door made her heart stand still.</p>

  <p>When her father had died, poignant though her sorrow had been, she had
  enjoyed the full powers of her mind. She had thought about the necessary
  preparations for the funeral, she had given orders to the servants, she had
  talked over the dear father to Jamie, she had wept his loss till her eyes
  were red. Not so now; she could not turn her thoughts from the all-absorbing
  terror; she could not endure an allusion to it from anyone, least of all to
  speak of it to her brother, and the power to weep was taken from her. Her
  eyes were dry; they burnt, but were unfilled by tears.</p>

  <p>When her father was dead she could look forward, think of him in paradise,
  and hope to rejoin him after having trustily executed the charge imposed on
  her by him. But now she could not look ahead. A shadow of horror lay before
  her, an impenetrable curtain. Her father was covering his face, was sunk in
  grief in his celestial abode; he could not help her. She could not go to him
  with the same open brow and childish smile as before. She must creep to his
  feet, and lay her head there, sullied by association with one against whom he
  had warned her, one whom he had regarded as the man that had marred his
  sacred utility, one who stood far below the stage of virtue and culture that
  belonged to his family and on which he had firmly planted his child. What was
  in her heart Judith could pour out before none; certainly not before Aunt
  Dionysia, devoid of a particle of sympathy with her niece. Nor could she
  speak her trouble to Uncle Zachie, a man void of resources, kind, able for a
  minute or two to sympathize, but never to go deeply into any trouble and
  understand more of a wound than the fester on the surface. Besides, of what
  avail to communicate the anguish of her heart to anyone, when nothing could
  be done to alter the circumstances. She could not now draw back. Indeed it
  never occurred to her to be possible to go back from her undertaking. To save
  Jamie from an idiot asylum she had passed her word to give her hand at the
  altar to Cruel Coppinger, and her word was sacred. Aunt Dionysia trusted her
  word. Coppinger held to it, knowing that she gave it on compulsion and
  reluctantly, yet he showed his perfect confidence in its security.</p>

  <p>"My dear Judith," said Mr. Menaida, "I am so sorry about losing you, and
  what is more, losing Jamie, for I know very well that when he is at the Glaze
  he will find plenty to amuse him without coming to see me, or anyhow, coming
  to work with me."</p>

  <p>"I hope not, dear uncle."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I lose a promising pupil." Then turning to the boy, he said: "Jamie,
  I hope you will not give up stuffing birds, or, if you have not the patience
  to do that, that you will secure the skins and prepare them for me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will," said Jamie.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, my dear boy," said Menaida, "but don't you fancy I am going to
  trust you with arsenic for preparing the skins. I shall give that to your
  sister and she will keep the supply, eh, will you not, Judith?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I will take charge of it."</p>

  <p>"And let him have it as needed; never more than is needed."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" asked Jamie.</p>

  <p>"Because it is a dangerous thing to have lying about." Menaida ran into
  the workshop, and came back with a small tin box of the poison. "Look here!
  here is a little bone spoon. Don't get the powder over your fingers. Why, a
  spoonful would make a man very ill, and two would kill him. So, Judith, I
  trust this to you. When Jamie has a skin to prepare he will go to you, and
  you will let him have only so much as he requires."</p>

  <p>"Yes, uncle."</p>

  <p>She took the little tin of arsenic and put it in her workbox, under the
  tray that contained reels and needles.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33"></a>XXXIII. &mdash; HALF A MARRIAGE.</h2>

  <p class="first">One request Judith had made, relative to her marriage, and
  one only, after she had given way about the time when it was to take place,
  and this request concerned the place. She desired to be married, not in the
  parish church of S. Minver, but in that of S. Enodoc, in the yard of which
  lay her father and mother, and in which her father had occasionally
  ministered.</p>

  <p>It was true that no great display could be made in a building half-filled
  with sand, but neither Judith nor Coppinger, nor Aunt Dionysia desired
  display, and Jump, the sole person who wished that the wedding should be in
  full gala, was not consulted in the matter.</p>

  <p>November scowled over sea and land, perverting the former into lead and
  blighting the latter to a dingy brown.</p>

  <p>The wedding-day was sad. Mist enveloped the coast, wreathed the cliffs,
  drifted like smoke over the glebe, and lay upon the ocean, dense and
  motionless, like a mass of cotton-wool. Not a smile of sun, not a glimmer of
  sky, not a trace of outline in the haze overhead. The air was full of minute
  particles of moisture flying aimlessly, lost to all sense of gravity, in
  every direction. The mist had a fringe but no seams, and looked as if it were
  as unrendable as felt. It trailed over the soil, here lifting a ragged flock
  or tag of fog a few feet above the earth, there dropping it again and
  smearing water over all it touched. Vapor condensed on every twig and leaf,
  but only leisurely, and slowly dripped from the ends of thorns and leaves;
  but the weight of the water on some of the frosted and sickly foliage brought
  the leaves down with it. Every stone in every wall was lined with trickles of
  water like snail crawls. The vapor penetrated within doors, and made all
  articles damp, of whatever sort they were. Fires were reluctant to kindle,
  chimneys smoked. The grates and irons broke out into eruptions of rust,
  mildew appeared on walls, leaks in roofs. The slate floors became dark and
  moist. Forks and spoons adhered to the hands of those who touched them, and
  on the keys of Mr. Menaida's piano drops formed.</p>

  <p>What smoke did escape from a chimney trailed down the roof. Decomposed
  leaves exhaled the scent of decay. From every stack-yard came a musty odor of
  wet straw and hay. Stable yards emitted their most fetid exudations that
  oozed through the gates and stained the roads. The cabbages in the kail-yards
  touched by frost announced that they were in decomposition, and the turnips
  that they were in rampant degeneration and rottenness. The very seaweed
  washed ashore impregnated the mist with a flavor of degeneration.</p>

  <p>The new rector, the Reverend Desiderius Mules had been in residence at St.
  Enodoc for three months. He had received but a hundred and twenty-seven
  pounds four and ninepence farthing for dilapidations, and was angry, declared
  himself cheated, and vowed he would never employ the agent Cargreen any more.
  And a hundred and twenty-seven pounds four and ninepence farthing went a very
  little way in repairing and altering the rectory to make it habitable to the
  liking of the Reverend Desiderius. The Reverend Peter Trevisa and his
  predecessors had been West Country men, and as such loved the sun, and chose
  to have the best rooms of the house with a southern aspect. But the Reverend
  Desiderius Mules had been reared in Barbadoes, and hated the sun, and elected
  to have the best rooms of the house to look north. This entailed great
  alterations. The kitchen had to be converted into parlor, and the parlor into
  kitchen, the dining-room into scullery, and the scullery into study, and the
  library enlarged to serve as dining-room. All the down-stairs windows had to
  be altered. Mr. Desiderius Mules liked to have French windows opening to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>In the same manner great transformations were made in the garden. Where
  Mr. Peter Trevisa had built up and planted a hedge there Mr. Desiderius Mules
  opened a gate, and where the late rector had laid down a drive there the new
  rector made garden beds. In the same manner shrubberies were converted into
  lawns, and lawns into shrubberies. The pump was now of no service outside the
  drawing-room window; it had to be removed to the other side of the house, and
  to serve the pump with water a new well had to be dug, and the old well that
  had furnished limpid and wholesome water was filled up. The site of the
  conservatory was considered the proper one for the well, and this entailed
  the destruction of the conservatory. Removal was intended, with a new aspect
  to the north, as a frigidarium, but when touched it fell to pieces, and in so
  doing furnished Mr. Desiderius Mules with much comment on the imposition to
  which he had been subjected, for he had taken this conservatory at a
  valuation, and that valuation had been for three pounds seven and fourpence
  ha'penny, whereas its real value was, so he declared, three pounds seven and
  fourpence without the ha'penny at the end or the three pounds before.</p>

  <p>When the Reverend Desiderius Mules heard that Captain Coppinger and Judith
  Trevisa were to be married in his church, "By Jove," said he, "they shall pay
  me double fees as extra parochial. I shall get that out of them at all
  events. I have been choused sufficiently."</p>

  <p>A post-chaise from Wadebridge conveyed Judith, Miss Trevisa, Uncle Zachie,
  and Jamie from Polzeath.</p>

  <p>The bride was restless. At one moment she leaned back, then forward; her
  eyes turned resolutely through the window at the fog. Her hands plucked at
  her veil or at her gloves; she spoke not a word throughout the drive. Aunt
  Dionysia was also silent. Opposite her sat Mr. Menaida in blue coat with
  brass buttons, white waistcoat outside a colored one, and white trousers
  tightly strapped. Though inclined to talk, he was unable to resist the
  depressing influence of his vis-a-vis, Miss Trevisa, who sat scowling at him
  with her thin lips closed. Jamie was excited, but as no one answered him when
  he spoke he also lapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>When the church-yard gate of St. Enodoc was reached, Mr. Menaida jumped
  out of the chaise with a sigh of relief, and muttered to himself that, had he
  known what to expect, he would have brought his pocket-flask with him, and
  have had a nip of cognac on the way.</p>

  <p>A good number of sight-seers had assembled from Polzeath and St. Enodoc,
  and stood in the church-yard, magnified by the mist to gigantic size. Over
  the graves of drowned sailors were planted the figure-heads of wrecked
  vessels, and these in the mist might have been taken as the dead risen and
  mingling with the living to view this dreary marriage.</p>

  <p>The bride herself looked ghostlike, or as a waft of the fog, but little
  condensed, blown through the graveyard toward the gap in the church wall, and
  blown through that also within.</p>

  <p>That gap was usually blocked with planks from a wreck, supported by beams;
  when the church was to be put in requisition, then the beams were knocked
  away, whereupon down clattered the boards and they were tossed aside. It had
  been so done on this occasion, and the fragments were heaped untidily among
  the graves under the church wall. The clerk-sexton had, indeed, considered
  that morning, with his hands in his pockets, whether it would be worth his
  while, assisted by the five bell-ringers, to take this accumulation of
  wreckage and pile it together out of sight, but he had thought that, owing to
  the fog, a veil would be drawn over the disorder, and he might be saved this
  extra trouble.</p>

  <p>Within the sacred building, over his boots in sand, stamped, and frowned,
  and paced, and growled the Reverend Desiderius Mules, in surplice, hood, and
  stole, very ill at ease and out of humor because the wedding-party arrived
  unpunctually, and he feared he might catch cold from the wind and fog that
  drifted in through the hole in the wall serving as door.</p>

  <p>The sand within was level with the sills of the windows; it cut the tables
  of commandments in half; had blotted away the majority of inhibitions against
  marriage within blood relationship and marriage kinship. The altar-rails were
  below the surface. The altar-table had been fished up and set against the
  east wall, not on this day for the marriage, but at some previous occasion.
  Then the sexton had placed two pieces of slate under the feet on one side,
  and not having found handy any other pieces, had thought that perhaps it did
  not matter. Consequently the two legs one side had sunk in the sand, and the
  altar-table formed an incline.</p>

  <p>A vast number of bats occupied the church, and by day hung like little
  moleskin purses from the roof. Complaints had been made of the
  disagreeableness of having these creatures suspended immediately over the
  head of the officiant, accordingly the sexton had knocked away such as were
  suspended immediately above the altar and step&mdash;a place where the step
  was, beneath the sand; but he did not think it necessary to disturb those in
  other parts of the church. If they inconvenienced others, it was the penalty
  of curiosity, coming to see a wedding there. Toward the west end of the
  church some wooden pew-tops stood above the sand, and stuck into a
  gimlet-hole in the top rail of one was a piece of holly, dry and brown as a
  chip. It had been put there as a Christmas decoration the last year that the
  church was used for divine worship, at the feast of Noel; <i>when</i> that
  was, only the oldest men could remember. The sexton had looked at it several
  times with his hands in his pockets and considered whether it were worth
  while pulling his hands out and removing the withered fragment, and carrying
  it outside the church, but had arrived at the conclusion that it injured no
  one, and might therefore just as well remain.</p>

  <p>There were fragments of stained glass in the windows, in the upper light
  of the perpendicular windows saints and angels in white and gold on ruby and
  blue grounds. In one window a fragment of a Christ on the cross. But all were
  much obscured by cobwebs. The cobwebs, after having entangled many flies,
  caught and retained many particles of sand, became impervious to light and
  obscured the figures in the painted glass. The sexton had looked at these
  cobwebs occasionally and mused whether it would be worth his while to sweep
  them down, but as he knew that the church was rarely used for divine offices,
  and never for regular divine worship, he deemed that there was no crying
  necessity for their destruction. Life was short, and time might be better
  employed&mdash;to whit in talking to a neighbor, in smoking a pipe, in
  drinking a pint of ale, in larruping his wife, in reading the paper.
  Consequently the cobwebs remained.</p>

  <p>Had Mr. Desiderius Mules been possessed of antiquarian tastes, he might
  have occupied the time he was kept waiting in studying the bosses of carved
  oak that adorned the wagon-roof of the church, which were in some cases
  quaint, in the majority beautiful, and no two the same. And he might have
  puzzled out the meaning of three rabbits with only three ears between them
  forming a triangle, or three heads united in one neck, a king, a queen, a
  bishop and a monk, or of a sow suckling a dozen little pigs.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Desiderius Mules had no artistic or archaeological faculty
  developed in him. His one object on the present occasion was to keep draught
  and damp from the crown of his head, where the hair was so scanty as hardly
  to exist at all. He did not like to assume his hat in the consecrated
  building, so he stamped about in the sand holding a red bandanna handkerchief
  on the top of his head, and grumbling at the time he was kept waiting, at the
  Cornish climate, at the way in which he had been "choused" in the matter of
  dilapidations for the chancel of the church, at the unintelligible dialect of
  the people, and at a good many other causes of irritation, notably at a bat
  which had not reverenced his bald pate, when he ventured beyond the range of
  the sexton's sweeping.</p>

  <p>Presently the clerk, who was outside, thrust in his head through the gap
  in the wall, and in a stage whisper announced, "They's a-coming."</p>

  <p>The Reverend Mules growled, "There ought to be a right to charge extra
  when the parson is kept waiting&mdash;sixpence a minute, not a penny less.
  But we are choused in this confounded corner of the world in every way. Ha!
  there is a mildew-spot on my stole&mdash;all come of this villainous
  damp."</p>

  <p>In the tower stood five men, ready to pull the ropes and sound a merry
  peal when the service was over, and earn a guinea. They had a firkin of ale
  in a corner, with which to moisten their inner clay between each round. Now
  that they heard that the wedding party had arrived they spat on their hands
  and heaved their legs out of the sand.</p>

  <p>Through the aperture in the wall entered the bridal party, a cloud of fog
  blowing in with them and enveloping them. They stepped laboriously through
  the fine sand, at this place less firm than elsewhere, having been dug into
  daily by the late rector in his futile efforts to clear the church.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mules cast a suspicious look into the rafters above him to see that no
  profane bat was there, and opened his book.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida was to act as father to the bride, and there was no other
  bride's-maid than Miss Trevisa. As they waded toward the alter, Judith's
  strength failed, and she stood still. Then Uncle Zachie put his arm round her
  and half carried her over the sand toward the place where she must stand to
  give herself away. She turned her head and thanked him with her eyes, she
  could not speak. So deathly was her whiteness, so deficient in life did she
  seem, that Miss Trevisa looked at her with some anxiety, and a little doubt
  whether she would be able to go through the service.</p>

  <p>When Judith reached her place, her eyes rested on the sand. She did not
  look to her left side, she could hear no steps, for the sand muffled all
  sound of feet, but she knew by the cold shudder that thrilled through her,
  that Captain Coppinger was at her side.</p>

  <p>"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here&mdash;now then order, if
  you please, and quiet, we are twenty-five minutes after time," said Mr.
  Desiderius Mules.</p>

  <p>The first few words, seven in all were addressed to the wedding party, the
  rest to a number of men and women and children who were stumbling and
  plunging into the church through the improvised door, thrusting each other
  forward, with a "get along," and "out of the road," all eager to secure a
  good sight of the ceremony, and none able to hurry to a suitable place
  because of the sand that impeded every step.</p>

  <p>"Now then&mdash;I can't stay here all day!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mules sniffed and applied the bandanna to his nose, as an indication
  that he was chilled, and that this rheum would be on the heads of the
  congregation, were he made ill by this delay.</p>

  <p>"Dearly beloved, we are gathered," he began again, and he was now able to
  proceed.</p>

  <p>"Cruel," said he in loud and emphatic tones, "wilt thou have this woman to
  thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of
  matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor, and keep her in sickness
  and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her so long as
  ye both shall live?"</p>

  <p>The response of Coppinger went through the heart of Judith like a knife.
  Then the rector addressed her. For answer she looked up at him and moved her
  lips. He took her hand and placed it in that of Coppinger. It was cold as ice
  and quivering like an aspen leaf. As Captain Coppinger held it, it seemed to
  drag and become heavy in his hand, whilst he pronounced the words after the
  rector, making oath to take Judith as his own. Then the same words were
  recited to her, for her to repeat in order after the priest. She began, she
  moved her lips, looked him pleadingly in the face, her head swam, the fog
  filled the whole church and settled between her and the rector. She felt
  nothing save the grip of Coppinger's hand, and sank unconscious to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Go forward," said Cruel. Mr. Menaida and Aunt Dionysia caught Judith and
  held her up. She could neither speak nor stir. Her lips were unclosed, she
  seemed to be gasping for breath like one drowning.</p>

  <p>"Go on," persisted Cruel, and holding her left hand he thrust the ring on
  her fourth finger, repeating the words of the formula.</p>

  <p>"I cannot proceed," said the Reverend Desiderius.</p>

  <p>"Then you will have to come again to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"She is unconscious," objected the rector.</p>

  <p>"It is momentary only," said Aunt Dionysia; "be quick and finish."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mules hesitated a moment. He had no wish to return in like weather on
  another day; no wish again to be kept waiting five and twenty minutes. He
  rushed at the remainder of the office and concluded it at a hand gallop.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, "the registers are at the rectory. Come there."</p>

  <p>Coppinger looked at Judith.</p>

  <p>"Not to-day. It is not possible. She is ill&mdash;faint. To-morrow.
  Neither she nor I nor the witnesses will run away. We will come to you
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie offered to assist Judith from the church.</p>

  <p>"No," said Cruel, peremptorily, "she is mine now."</p>

  <p>She was able with assistance to walk, she seemed to recover for a moment
  in the air outside, but again lapsed into faintness on being placed in the
  chaise.</p>

  <p>"To Pentyre Glaze," ordered Coppinger; "our home."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34"></a>XXXIV. &mdash; A BREAKFAST.</h2>

  <p class="first">"She has been over-exerted, over-excited," said Miss
  Trevisa. "Leave her to recover; in a few days she will be herself again.
  Remember, her father died of heart complaint, and though Judith resembles her
  mother rather than a Trevisa, she may have inherited from my brother just
  that one thing she had better have let him carry to his grave with him."</p>

  <p>So Judith was given the little room that adjoined her aunt's, and Miss
  Trevisa postponed for a week her migration to Othello Cottage.</p>

  <p>Aunt Dionysia was uneasy about her niece; perhaps her conscience did
  suffer from some qualms when she saw how Judith shrank from the union she had
  driven her into for her own selfish convenience. She treated her in the
  wisest manner, now she had brought her to the Glaze, for she placed her in
  her old room next her own, and left her there to herself. Judith could hear
  her aunt walking about and muttering in the adjoining chamber, and was
  content to be left alone to recover her composure and strength.</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie and Jump were, however, in sore distress; they had made the
  trim cottage ready, had prepared a wedding breakfast, engaged a helping hand
  or two, and no one had come to partake. Nor was Mr. Desiderius Mules in a
  cheerful mood. He had been invited to the breakfast, and was hungry and cold.
  He had to wait while Mr. Menaida ran up to Pentyre to know whether any one
  was going to honor his board. While he was away the rector stamped about the
  parlor, growling that he believed he was about to be "choused out of his
  breakfast. There was really no knowing what these people in this
  out-of-the-world corner might do." Then he pulled off his boots and shook the
  sand out, rang for Jump, and asked at what hour precisely the breakfast was
  to be eaten, and whether it was put on table to be looked at only.</p>

  <p>From Pentyre Glaze Mr. Menaida was not greatly successful in obtaining
  guests. He found some wild-looking men there in converse with Coppinger, men
  whom he knew by rumor to belong to a class that had no ostensible profession
  and means of living.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida had ordered in clotted cream, which would not keep sweet many
  days. It ought to be eaten at once. He wanted to know whether Coppinger, the
  bride, Miss Trevisa, anyone was coming to his house to consume the clotted
  cream. As Jamie was drifting about purposeless, and he alone seemed disposed
  to accompany Uncle Zachie, the old gentleman carried him off.</p>

  <p>"I s'pose I can't on the spur of the moment go in and ask over St. Minver
  parson?" asked Menaida, dubiously, of the St. Enodoc parson. "You see I
  daresay he's hurt not to have had the coupling of 'em himself."</p>

  <p>"Most certainly not," said Mr. Mules; "an appetite is likely to go into
  faintness unless attended to at once. I know that the coats of my stomach are
  honeycombed with gastric juice. Shall I say grace? Another half-hour of delay
  will finish me."</p>

  <p>Consequently but three persons sat down to a plentiful meal; but some
  goose, cold, had hardly been served, when in came Mr. Scantlebray, the agent,
  with a cheery salutation of "Hulloa, Menaida, old man! What, eating and
  drinking? I'll handle a knife and fork with you, unasked. Beg pardon, Mr.
  Mules. I'm a rough man, and an old acquaintance of our good friend here. Hope
  I see you in the enjoyment of robust health, sir. Oh, Menaida, old man! I
  didn't expect such a thing as this. Now I begin to see daylight, and
  understand why I was turned out of the valuership, and why my brother lost
  this promising young pupil. Ah, ha! my man, you have been deprived of fun,
  such fun, roaring fun, by not being with my brother Scanty. Well, sir," to
  Mr. Mules, "what was the figure of the valuation? You had a queer man on your
  side. I pity you. A man I wouldn't trust myself. I name no names. Now tell
  me, what did you get?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred and twenty-seven pounds four and ninepence farthing.
  Monstrous&mdash;a chouse."</p>

  <p>"As you say, monstrous. Why that chancel, show me the builder who will
  contract to do that alone at a hundred and twenty-seven pounds? And the
  repairs of the vestry&mdash;are they to be reckoned at four and ninepence
  farthing? It is a swindle. I'd appeal. I'd refuse. You made a mistake, sir,
  let me tell you, in falling into certain hands. Yes&mdash;I'll have some
  goose, thank you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray ate heartily, so did the Reverend Desiderius, who had the
  honeycomb cells of his stomach coats to fill.</p>

  <p>Both, moreover, did justice to Mr. Menaida's wine, they did not spare it;
  why should they? Those for whom the board was spread had not troubled to come
  to it, and they must make amends for their neglect.</p>

  <p>"Horrible weather," said the rector. "I suppose this detestable sort of
  stuff of which the atmosphere is composed is the prevailing abomination one
  has to inhale throughout three-quarters of the year. One cannot see three
  yards before one."</p>

  <p>"It's bad for some and good for others," answered Scantlebray. "There'll
  be wrecks, certainly, after this, especially if we get, as we are pretty sure
  to get, a wind ashore."</p>

  <p>"Wrecks!" exclaimed the Rector, "and pray who pays the fees for drowned
  men I may be expected to bury?"</p>

  <p>"The parish," answered Uncle Zachie.</p>

  <p>"Oh, half-a-crown a head," said Mr. Mules, contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"There are other things to be had besides burial fees out of a wreck,"
  said Scantlebray; "but you must be down early before the coast-guard are
  there. Have you donkeys?"</p>

  <p>"Donkeys! What for?"</p>

  <p>"I have one, a gray beauty," exclaimed Jamie; "Captain Coppinger gave her
  to me."</p>

  <p>"Well, young man, then you pick up what you can, when you have the chance,
  and lade her with your findings. You'll pick up something better than
  corpses, and make something more than burial half-crowns."</p>

  <p>"But why do you suppose there will be wrecks?" inquired the rector of St.
  Enodoc. "There is no storm."</p>

  <p>"No storm, certainly, but there is fog, and in the fog vessels coming up
  the Channel to Bristol get lost as to their bearings, get near our cliffs
  without knowing it, and then&mdash;if a wind from the west spring up and
  blows rough&mdash;they are done for, they can't escape to the open. That's
  it, old man. I beg your Reverence's pardon, I mean, sir. When I said that
  such weather was bad for some and good for others you can understand me
  now&mdash;bad for the wrecked, good for the wreckers."</p>

  <p>"But surely you have no wreckers here?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray laughed. "Go and tell the bridegroom that you think so.
  I'll let you into the knowledge of one thing"&mdash;he winked over his
  glass&mdash;"there's a fine merchantman on her way to Bristol."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Know! Because she was sighted off St. Ives, and the tidings has run up
  the coast like fire among heather. I don't doubt it that it has reached
  Hartland by this; and with a thick fog like to-day there are a thousand
  hearts beating with expectation. Who can say? She may be laden with gold-dust
  from Africa, or with tin from Barca, or with port from Oporto."</p>

  <p>"My boy Oliver is coming home," said Mr. Menaida.</p>

  <p>"Then let's hope he is not in this vessel, for, old man, she stands a bad
  chance in such weather as this. There is Porth-quin, and there is Hayle Bay
  ready to receive her, or Doom Bar on which she may run, all handy for our
  people. Are you anything of a sportsman, sir?"</p>

  <p>"A little&mdash;but I don't fancy there is much in this precious
  country&mdash;no cover."</p>

  <p>"What is fox-hunting when you come to consider&mdash;or going after a
  snipe or a partridge? A fox! it's naught, the brush stinks, and a snipe is
  but a mouthful. My dear sir, if you come to live among us, you must seek your
  sport not on the land but at sea. You'll find the sport worth something when
  you get a haul of a barrel of first-rate sherry, or a load of silver ingots.
  Why, that's how Penwarden bought his farm. He got the money after a
  storm&mdash;found it on the shore out of the pocket of a dead man. Do you
  know why the bells of St. Enodoc are so sweet? Because, so folks say, melted
  into them are ingots of Peruvian silver from a ship wrecked on Doom Bar."</p>

  <p>"I should like to get some silver or gold," said Jamie.</p>

  <p>"I daresay you would, and so perhaps you may if you look out for it. Go to
  your good friend, Captain Coppinger, and tell him what you want. He has made
  his pickings before now on shore and off wrecks, and has not given up the
  practice."</p>

  <p>"But," said Mr. Mules, "do you mean to tell me that you people in this
  benighted corner of the world live like sharks, upon whatever is cast
  overboard?"</p>

  <p>"No, I do not," answered Scantlebray. "We have too much energy and
  intelligence for that. We don't always wait till it is cast overboard, we go
  aboard and take what we want."</p>

  <p>"What, steal!"</p>

  <p>"I don't call that stealing when Providence and a southwest wind throws a
  ship into our laps, when we put in our fingers and pick out the articles we
  want. What are Porth-quin and Hayle Bay but our laps, in which lie the wrecks
  heaven sends us? And Doom Bar, what is that but a counter on which the good
  things are spread, and those first there get the first share?"</p>

  <p>"And pray," said Mr. Desiderius Mules, "have the owners of the vessels,
  the passengers, the captains, no objections to make?"</p>

  <p>"They are not there. Don't wait for our people. If they do&mdash;so much
  the worse for them." Then Scantlebray laughed. "There's a good story told of
  the Zenobia, lost four years ago. There was a lady on board. When she knew
  the vessel was on Doom Bar she put on all her jewelry, to escape with it. But
  some of our people got to the wreck before she got off it, and one lobe of
  her ears got torn off."</p>

  <p>"Torn off?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;in pulling the earrings off her."</p>

  <p>"But who pulled the earrings off her?"</p>

  <p>"Our people."</p>

  <p>"Gracious heavens! Were they not brought to justice?"</p>

  <p>"Who did it? no one knew. What became of the jewelry? no one knew. All
  that was known was that Lady Knighton&mdash;that was her name&mdash;lost her
  diamonds and the lobe of her right ear as well."</p>

  <p>"And it was never recovered?"</p>

  <p>"What! the lobe of her ear?"</p>

  <p>"No, the jewelry."</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word I have got among a parcel of scoundrels. It is high time
  that I should come and reform them. I'll set to work at once. I'll have St.
  Enodoc dug out and restored, and I'll soon put an end to this sort of
  thing."</p>

  <p>"You think so?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know me. I'll have a bazaar. I'll have a ball in the Assembly
  Rooms at Wadebridge. The church shall be excavated. I'm not going in there
  again with the bats, to have my boots filled with sand, I can tell
  you&mdash;everything shall be renovated and put to rights. I'll see to it at
  once. I'll have a pigeon shooting for the sake of my chancel&mdash;I daresay
  I shall raise twenty pounds by that alone&mdash;and a raffle for the font,
  and an Aunt Sally for the pulpit. But the ball will be the main thing, I'll
  send and get the county people to patronize. I'll do it, and you barbarians
  in this benighted corner of the world shall see there is a man of energy
  among you."</p>

  <p>"You'd best try your hand on a wreck. You'll get more off that."</p>

  <p>"And I'll have a bran pie for an altar-table."</p>

  <p>"You won't get the parishioners to do anything for the restoration of the
  church. They don't want to have it restored."</p>

  <p>"The Decalogue is rotten. I ran my umbrella through the Ten Commandments
  this morning. I'll have a gypsy camp and fortune-telling to furnish me with
  new Commandments."</p>

  <p>"I've heard tell," said Scantlebray, "that at Ponghill, near Stratton, is
  a four-post bed of pure gold came off a wreck in Bude Bay."[C]</p>

  <p>[C] An exaggeration. The bed of seventeenth century Italian work, is gilt.
  It is now in a small farmhouse.</p>

  <p>"When I was in the North," said the rector of St. Enodoc, "we had a savage
  who bit off the heads of rats, snap, skinned them and ate them raw, and
  charged sixpence entrance; but that was for the missionaries. I should hardly
  advocate that for the restoration of a church; besides, where is the savage
  to be got? We made twenty-seven pounds by that man, but expenses were heavy
  and swallowed up twenty-five; we sent two pounds to the missionaries."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida stood up and went to the window.</p>

  <p>"I believe the wind has shifted to the north, and we shall have a
  lightening of the fog after sunset."</p>

  <p>"Shall we not have a wreck! I hope there'll be one," said Jamie.</p>

  <p>"What is the law about wreckage, Menaida, old man?" asked Scantlebray,
  also coming to the window.</p>

  <p>"The law is plain enough. No one has a right to goods come to land; he who
  finds may claim salvage&mdash;naught else; and any persons taking goods cast
  ashore, which are not legal wreck, may be punished."</p>

  <p>"And," said Scantlebray, "what if certain persons give occasion to a ship
  being wrecked, and then plundering the wreck?"</p>

  <p>"There the law is also plain. The invading and robbing of a vessel, either
  in distress or wrecked, and the putting forth of false lights in order to
  bring a vessel into danger, are capital felonies."</p>

  <p>Scantlebray went to the table, took up a napkin, twisted it and then flung
  it round his neck, and hung his head on one side.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;this, Menaida, old man?"</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie nodded.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Jim, my boy, a word with you outside." Scantlebray led Jamie
  into the road. "There's been a shilling owing you for some time. We had
  roaring fun about it once. Here it is. Now listen to me. Go to Pentyre, you
  want to find gold-dust on the shore, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Or bars of silver?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, beg Captain Coppinger, if he is going to have a Jack o' Lantern
  to-night, to let you be the Jack. Do you understand? and mind&mdash;not a
  word about me. Then gold-dust and bars of silver and purses of shillings.
  Mind you ask to be Jack o' Lantern. It is fun. Such fun. Roaring fun."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35"></a>XXXV. &mdash; JACK O' LANTERN.</h2>

  <p class="first">Evening closed in; Judith had been left entirely to herself.
  She sat in the window, looking out into the mist and watching the failing of
  the light. Sometimes she opened the casement and allowed the vapor to blow in
  like cold steam, then became chilled, shivered, and closed it again. The wind
  was rising and piped about the house, piped at her window. Judith, sitting
  there, tried with her hand to find the crevice through which the blast drove,
  and then amused herself with playing with her finger-tops on the openings and
  regulating the whistle so as to form a tune. She heard frequently Coppinger's
  voice in conversation, sometimes in the hall, sometimes in the court-yard,
  but could not catch what was spoken. She listened, with childish curiosity,
  to the voice that was now that of her lord and husband, and endeavored to
  riddle out of it some answer to her questions as to what sort of a master he
  would prove. She could not comprehend him. She had heard stories told of him
  that made her deem him the worst of men, remorseless and regardless of
  others, yet toward her he had proved gentle and considerate. What, for
  instance, could be more delicate and thoughtful than his behavior to her at
  this very time! Feeling that she had married him with reluctance, he had kept
  away from her and suffered her to recover her composure without affording her
  additional struggle. A reaction after the strain on her nerves set in; the
  step she had dreaded had been taken, and she was the wife of the man she
  feared and did not love. The suspense of expectation was exchanged for the
  calmer grief of retrospect.</p>

  <p>The fog all day had been white as wool, and she had noticed how parcels of
  vapor had been caught and entangled in the thorn bushes as the fog swept by,
  very much as sheep left flocks of their fleece in the bushes when they broke
  out of a field. Now that the day set, the vapor lost its whiteness and became
  ash gray, but it was not as dense as it had been, or rather it was compacted
  in places into thick masses with clear tracts between. The sea was not
  visible, nor the cliffs, but she could distinguish out-buildings, tufts of
  furze and hedges. The wind blew much stronger, and she could hear the boom of
  the waves against the rocks, like the throbbing of the unseen heart of the
  world. It was louder than it had been. The sound did not come upon the wind,
  for the fog that muffled all objects from sight, muffled also all sounds to
  the ear, but the boom came from the vibration of the land. The sea flung
  against the coast-line shook the rocks, and they quivered for a long distance
  inland, making every wall and tree quiver also, and the sound of the sea was
  heard not through the ears but through the soles of the feet.</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa came in.</p>

  <p>"Shall I light you a pair of candles, Judith?"</p>

  <p>"I thank you, hardly yet."</p>

  <p>"And will you not eat?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, presently, when supper is served."</p>

  <p>"You will come down-stairs?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear that."</p>

  <p>"Aunt, I thought you were going to Othello Cottage the day I came
  here."</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger will not suffer me to leave at once till you have
  settled down to your duties as mistress of the house."</p>

  <p>"Oh, auntie! I shall never be able to manage this large
  establishment."</p>

  <p>"Why not! You managed that at the rectory."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it was so different."</p>

  <p>"How so?"</p>

  <p>"My dear papa's requirements were so simple, and so few, and there were no
  men about except old Balhachet, and he was a dear, good old humbug. Here, I
  don't know how many men there are, and who belong to the house, and who do
  not. They are in one day and out the next&mdash;and then Captain Coppinger is
  not like my own darling papa."</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, he is not. Shall I light the candles? I have something to
  show you."</p>

  <p>"As you will, aunt."</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa went into her room and fetched a light, and kindled the two
  candles that stood on Judith's dressing-table.</p>

  <p>"Oh, aunt! not three candles."</p>

  <p>"Why not? We shall need light."</p>

  <p>"But three candles together bring ill-luck; and we have had enough
  already."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! Don't be a fool. I want light, for I have something to show
  you."</p>

  <p>She opened a small box and drew forth a brooch and earrings that flashed
  in the rays of the candle.</p>

  <p>"Look, child! they are yours. Captain Coppinger has given them to you.
  They are diamonds. See&mdash;a butterfly for the breast, and two little
  butterflies for the ears."</p>

  <p>"Oh, auntie! not for me. I do not want them."</p>

  <p>"This is ungracious. I daresay they cost many hundreds of pounds. They are
  diamonds."</p>

  <p>Judith took the brooch and earrings in her hand; they sparkled. The
  diamonds were far from being brilliants, they were of good size and purest
  water.</p>

  <p>"I really do not want to have them. Persuade Captain Coppinger to return
  them to the jeweller, it is far too costly a gift for me,
  far&mdash;far&mdash;I should be happier without them." Then,
  suddenly&mdash;"I do not know that they have been bought? Oh, Aunt Dunes,
  tell me truly. Have they been bought? I think jewellers always send out their
  goods in leather cases, and there is none such for these. And see&mdash;this
  earring&mdash;the gold is bent, as if pulled out of shape. I am sure they
  have not been bought. Take them back again, I pray you."</p>

  <p>"You little fool!" said Miss Trevisa, angrily. "I will do nothing of the
  kind. If you refuse them&mdash;then take them back yourself. Captain
  Coppinger performs a generous and kind act that costs him much money, and you
  throw his gift in his face, you insult him. Insult him yourself with your
  suspicions and refusals&mdash;you have already behaved to him outrageously. I
  will do nothing for you that you ask. Your father put on me a task that is
  hateful, and I wish I were clear of it."</p>

  <p>Then she bounced out of the room, leaving her candle burning along with
  the other two.</p>

  <p>A moment later she came back hastily and closed Judith's shutters.</p>

  <p>"Oh, leave them open," pleaded Judith. "I shall like to see how the night
  goes&mdash;if the fog clears away."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I will not," answered Miss Trevisa, roughly. "And mind you.
  These shutters remain shut, or your candles go out. Your window commands the
  sea, and the light of your window must not show."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because should the fog lift, it would be seen by vessels."</p>

  <p>"Why should they not see it?"</p>

  <p>"You are a fool. Obey, and ask no questions."</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa put up the bar and then retired with her candle, leaving
  Judith to her own thoughts, with the diamonds on the table before her.</p>

  <p>And her thoughts were reproachful of herself. She was ungracious and
  perhaps unjust. Her husband had sent her a present of rare value, and she was
  disposed to reject it, and charge him with not having come by the diamonds
  honestly. They were not new from a jeweller, but what of that? Could he
  afford to buy her a set at the price of some hundreds of pounds? And because
  he had not obtained them from a jeweller, did it follow that he had taken
  them unlawfully? He might have picked them up on the shore, or have bought
  them from a man who had. He might have obtained them at a sale in the
  neighborhood. They might be family jewels, that had belonged to his mother,
  and he was showing her the highest honor a man could show a woman in asking
  her to wear the ornaments that had belonged to his mother.</p>

  <p>He had exhibited to her a store-room full of beautiful things, but these
  might be legitimately his, brought from foreign countries by his ship the
  Black Prince. It was possible that they were not contraband articles.</p>

  <p>Judith opened her door and went down-stairs. In the hall she found
  Coppinger with two or three men, but the moment he saw her he started up,
  came to meet her, and drew her aside into a parlor, then went back into the
  hall and fetched candles. A fire was burning in this room, ready for her,
  should she condescend to use it.</p>

  <p>"I hope I have not interrupted you," she said, timidly.</p>

  <p>"An agreeable interruption. At any time you have only to show yourself and
  I will at once come to you, and never ask to be dismissed."</p>

  <p>She knew that this was no empty compliment, that he meant it from the
  depth of his heart, and was sorry that she could not respond to an affection
  so deep and so sincere.</p>

  <p>"You have been very good to me&mdash;more good than I deserve," she said,
  standing by the fire with lowered eyes, "I must thank you now for a splendid
  and beautiful present, and I really do not know how to find words in which
  fittingly to acknowledge it."</p>

  <p>"You cannot thank and gratify me better than by wearing what I have given
  you."</p>

  <p>"But when? Surely not on an ordinary evening?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;certainly. The Rector has been up this afternoon and desired to
  see you, he is hot on a scheme for a public ball to be given at Wadebridge
  for the restoration of his church, and he has asked that you will be a
  patroness."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;oh&mdash;I!&mdash;after my father's death?"</p>

  <p>"That was in the late spring, and now it is the early winter, besides, now
  you are a married lady&mdash;and was not the digging out and restoring of the
  church your father's strong desire?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but he would never have had a ball for such a purpose."</p>

  <p>"The money must be raised somehow. So I promised for you. You could not
  well refuse&mdash;he was impatient to be off to Wadebridge and secure the
  assembly rooms."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;Captain Coppinger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger?"</p>

  <p>Judith colored. "I beg your pardon&mdash;I forgot. And now&mdash;I do not
  recollect what I was going to say. It matters nothing. If you wish me to go I
  will go. If you wish me to wear diamond butterflies I will wear them."</p>

  <p>"I thank you." He held out his hands to her.</p>

  <p>She drew back slightly and folded her palms as though praying. "I will do
  much to please you, but do not press me too greatly. I am strange in this
  house, strange in my new situation; give me time to breathe and look round
  and recover my confidence. Besides, we are only half-married so far."</p>

  <p>"How so?"</p>

  <p>"I have not signed the register."</p>

  <p>"No, but that shall be done to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, to-morrow&mdash;but that gives me breathing time. You will be
  patient and forbearing with me." She put forward her hands folded and he put
  his outside them and pressed them. The flicker of the fire lent a little
  color to her cheeks and surrounded her head with an aureole of spun gold.</p>

  <p>"Judith, I will do anything you ask. I love you with all my soul, past
  speaking. I am your slave. But do not hold me too long in chains, do not
  tread me too ruthlessly under foot."</p>

  <p>"Give me time," she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"I will give you a little time," he answered.</p>

  <p>Then she withdrew her hands from between his and sped up stairs, leaving
  him looking into the fire with troubled face.</p>

  <p>When she returned to her room the candles were still burning, and the
  diamonds lay on the dressing-table where she had left them. She took the
  brooch and earrings to return them to their box, and then noticed for the
  first time that they were wrapped in paper, not in cotton-wool. She tapped at
  her aunt's door, and entering asked if she had any cotton-wool that she could
  spare her.</p>

  <p>"No, I have not. What do you want it for?"</p>

  <p>"For the jewelry. It cannot have come from a shop, as it was wrapped in
  paper only."</p>

  <p>"It will take no hurt. Wrap it in paper again."</p>

  <p>"I had rather not, auntie. Besides, I have some cotton-wool in my
  workbox."</p>

  <p>"Then use it."</p>

  <p>"But my workbox has not been brought here. It is at Mr. Menaida's."</p>

  <p>"You can fetch it to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"But I am lost without my needles and thread. Besides, I do not like to
  leave my workbox about. I will go for it. The walk will do me good."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, it is falling dark."</p>

  <p>"I will get Uncle Zachie to walk back with me. I must have my workbox.
  Besides, the fresh air will do me good, and the fog has lifted."</p>

  <p>"As you will, then."</p>

  <p>So Judith put on her cloak and drew a hood over her head and went back to
  Polzeath. She knew the way perfectly, there was no danger, night had not
  closed in. It would be a pleasure to her to see the old bird-stuffer's face
  again, and she wanted to find Jamie. She had not seen him nor heard his
  voice, and she supposed he must be at Polzeath.</p>

  <p>On her arrival at the double cottage, the old fellow was delighted to see
  her, and to see that she had recovered from the distress and faintness of the
  morning sufficiently to be able to walk back to his house from her new home.
  Her first question was after Jamie. Uncle Zachie told her that Jamie had
  breakfasted at his table, but he had gone away in the afternoon and he had
  seen no more of him. The fire was lighted, and Uncle Zachie insisted on
  Judith sitting by it with him and talking over the events of the day, and on
  telling him that she was content with her position, reconciled to the change
  of her state.</p>

  <p>She sat longer with him than she had intended, listening to his
  disconnected chatter, and then nothing would suffice him but she must sit at
  the piano and play through his favorite pieces.</p>

  <p>"Remember, Judith, it is the last time I shall have you here to give me
  this pleasure."</p>

  <p>She could not refuse him his request, especially as he was to walk back to
  Pentyre with her. Thus time passed, and it was with alarm and self-reproach
  that she started up on hearing the clock strike the half-past, and learned
  that it was half-past nine, and not half-past eight, as she supposed.</p>

  <p>As she now insisted on departing, Mr. Menaida put on his hat.</p>

  <p>"Shall we take a light?" he asked, and then said: "No, we had better not.
  On such a night as this a moving light is dangerous."</p>

  <p>"How can it be dangerous?" asked Judith.</p>

  <p>"Not to us, my dear child, but to ships at sea. A stationary light might
  serve as a warning, but a moving light misleads. The captain of a vessel, if
  he has lost his bearings, as is like enough in the fog, as soon as the mist
  rises, would see a light gliding along and think it was that of a vessel at
  sea, and so make in the direction of the light in the belief that there was
  open water, and so run directly on his destruction."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, no, Uncle, we will not take a light."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida and Judith went out together, she with her workbox under her
  arm, he with his stick, and her hand resting on his arm. The night was dark,
  very dark, but the way led for the most part over down, and there was just
  sufficient light in the sky for the road to be distinguishable. It would be
  in the lane, between the walls and where overhung by thorns, that the
  darkness would be most profound. The wind was blowing strongly and the sound
  of the breakers came on it now, for the cloud had lifted off land and sea,
  though still hanging low. Very dense overhead it could not be, or no light
  would have pierced the vaporous canopy.</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie and Judith walked on talking together, and she felt cheered
  by his presence, when all at once she stopped, pressed his arm, and said:</p>

  <p>"Oh, do look, uncle! What is that light?"</p>

  <p>In the direction of the cliffs a light was distinctly visible, now rising,
  now falling, observing an unevenly undulating motion.</p>

  <p>"Oh, uncle? It is too dreadful. Some foolish person is on the downs going
  home with a lantern, and it may lead to a dreadful error, and a wreck."</p>

  <p>"I hope to heaven it is only what you say."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"That it is not done wilfully."</p>

  <p>"Wilfully!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, with the purpose to mislead. Look. The movement of the light is
  exactly that of a ship on a rolling sea."</p>

  <p>"Uncle, let us go there at once and stop it."</p>

  <p>"I don't know, my dear; if it be done by some unprincipled ruffian he
  would not be stopped by us."</p>

  <p>"It must be stopped. And, oh, think! you told me that your Oliver is
  coming home. Think of him."</p>

  <p>"We will go."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida was drawn along by Judith in her eagerness. They left the road
  to Pentyre, and struck out over the downs, keeping their eyes on the light.
  The distance was deceptive. It seemed to have been much nearer than they
  found it actually to be.</p>

  <p>"Look! it is coming back!" exclaimed Judith.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is done wilfully. That is to give the appearance of a vessel
  tacking up Channel. Stay behind, Judith. I will go on."</p>

  <p>"No. I will go with you. You would not find me again in the darkness if we
  parted."</p>

  <p>"The light is coming this way. Stand still. It will come directly on
  us."</p>

  <p>They drew up. Judith clung to Uncle Zachie's side, her heart beating with
  excitement, indignation, and anger.</p>

  <p>"The lantern is fastened to an ass's head," said Uncle Zachie; "do you see
  how as the creature moves his head the light is swayed, and that with the
  rise and fall in the land it looks as though the rise and fall were on the
  sea. I have my stick. Stand behind me, Judith."</p>

  <p>But a voice was heard that made her gasp and clasp the arm of Uncle Zachie
  the tighter.</p>

  <p>Neither spoke.</p>

  <p>The light approached. They could distinguish the lantern, though they
  could not see what bore it; only&mdash;next moment something caught the
  light&mdash;the ear of a donkey thrust forward.</p>

  <p>Again a voice, that of some one urging on the ass.</p>

  <p>Judith let go Menaida's arm, sprang forward with a cry: "Jamie! Jamie!
  what are you doing!"</p>

  <p>In a moment she had wrenched the lantern from the head of the ass, and the
  creature, startled, dashed away and disappeared in the darkness. Judith put
  the light under her cloak.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jamie! Jamie! Why have you done this! Who ever set you to this wicked
  task?"</p>

  <p>"I am Jack o' Lantern," answered the boy. "Ju! now my Neddy is gone."</p>

  <p>"Jamie, who sent you out to do this? Answer me."</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger!"</p>

  <p>Judith walked on in silence. Neither she nor Uncle Zachie spoke, only
  Jamie whimpered and muttered.</p>

  <p>Suddenly they were surrounded, and a harsh voice exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"In the king's name. We have you now&mdash;showing false lights."</p>

  <p>Judith hastily slung the lantern from beneath her cloak, and saw that
  there were several men about her, and that the speaker was Mr.
  Scantlebray.</p>

  <p>The latter was surprised when he recognized her.</p>

  <p>"What!" he said, "I did not expect this&mdash;pretty quickly into your
  apprenticeship. What brings you here! And you, too, Menaida, old man?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing simpler," answered Uncle Zachie. "I am accompanying Mrs.
  Coppinger back to the Glaze."</p>

  <p>"What, married in the morning and roving the downs at night?"</p>

  <p>"I have been to Polzeath after my workbox&mdash;here it is," said
  Judith.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are out of your road to Pentyre&mdash;I suppose you know that,"
  sneered Scantlebray.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," replied Mr. Menaida. "It is dark enough for any one to stray.
  Why! you don't suspect me, do you, of showing false lights and endeavoring to
  wreck vessels! That would be too good a joke&mdash;and the offence, as I told
  you&mdash;capital."</p>

  <p>Scantlebray uttered an oath and turned to the men and said: "Captain Cruel
  is too deep for us this time. I thought he had sent the boy out with the
  ass&mdash;instead he has sent his wife&mdash;a wife of a few hours, and never
  told her the mischief she was to do with the lantern&mdash;hark!"</p>

  <p>From the sea the boom of a gun.</p>

  <p>All stood still as if rooted to the spot.</p>

  <p>Then again the boom of a gun.</p>

  <p>"There is a wreck!" exclaimed Scantlebray. "I thought so&mdash;and you,
  Mistress Orphing, you're guilty." He turned to the men. "We can make nothing
  of this affair with the lantern. Let us catch the sea-wolves falling on their
  prey."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36"></a>XXXVI. &mdash; THE SEA-WOLVES.</h2>

  <p class="first">On the Doom Bar.</p>

  <p>That very merchantman was wrecked, over which so many Cornish mouths had
  watered, ay, and Devonian mouths also, from the moment she had been sighted
  at St. Ives.</p>

  <p>She had been entangled in the fog, not knowing where she was, all her
  bearings lost. The wind had risen, and when the day darkened into night the
  mist had lifted in cruel kindness to show a false glimmer, that was at once
  taken as the light of a ship beating up the Channel. The head of the
  merchantman was put about, a half-reefed topsail spread, and she ran on her
  destruction. With a crash she was on the bar. The great bowlers that roll
  without a break from Labrador rushed on behind, beat her, hammered her
  farther and farther into the sand, surged up at each stroke, swept the decks
  with mingled foam and water and spray.</p>

  <p>The main-mast went down with a snap. Bent with the sail, at the jerk, as
  the vessel ran aground, it broke and came down&mdash;top-mast, rigging, and
  sail, in an enveloping, draggled mass. From that moment the captain's voice
  was no more heard. Had he been struck by the falling mast and stunned or
  beaten overboard? or did he lie on deck enveloped and smothered in wet sail,
  or had he been caught and strangled by the cordage? None knew, none inquired.
  A wild panic seized crew and passengers alike. The chief mate had the
  presence of mind to order the discharge of signals of distress&mdash;but the
  order was imperfectly carried out. A flash, illuminating for a second the
  glittering froth and heaving sea, then a boom&mdash;almost stunned by the
  roar of the sea, and the screams of women and oaths of sailors, and then
  panic laid hold of the gunner also and he deserted his post.</p>

  <p>The word had gone round, none knew from whom, that the vessel had been
  lured to her destruction by wreckers, and that in a few minutes she would be
  boarded by these wolves of the sea. The captain, who should have kept order,
  had disappeared, the mate was disregarded, there was a general <i>sauve qui
  peut</i>. A few women were on board. At the shock they had come on deck, some
  with children, and the latter were wailing and shrieking with terror. The
  women implored that they might be saved. Men passengers ran about asking what
  was to be done, and were beaten aside and cursed by the frantic sailors. A
  Portuguese nun was ill with sea-sickness, and sank on the deck like a log,
  crying to St. Joseph between her paroxysms. One man alone seemed to maintain
  his self-possession, a young man, and he did his utmost to soothe the excited
  women and abate their terrors. He raised the prostrate nun and insisted on
  her laying hold of a rope, lest in the swash of the water she should be
  carried overboard. He entreated the mate to exert his authority and bring the
  sailors to a sense of their duty, to save the women instead of escaping in
  the boat, regardful of themselves only.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a steady star, red in color, glared out of the darkness, and
  between it and the wreck heaved and tossed a welter of waves and foam.</p>

  <p>"There is land," shouted the mate.</p>

  <p>"And that shines just where that light was that led us here," retorted a
  sailor.</p>

  <p>The vessel heeled to one side, and shipped water fore and aft, over either
  rail, with a hiss and heave. She plunged, staggered, and sank deeper into the
  sand.</p>

  <p>A boat had been lowered and three men were in it, and called to the women
  to be sharp and join them. But this was no easy matter, for the boat at one
  moment leaped up on the comb of a black wave, and then sank in its yawning
  trough, now was close to the side of the ship, and then separated from it by
  a rift of water. The frightened women were let down by ropes, but in their
  bewilderment missed their opportunity when the boat was under them, and some
  fell into the water, and had to be dragged out, others refused to leave the
  wreck and risk a leap into the little boat. Nothing would induce the sick nun
  to venture overboard. She could not understand English; the young passenger
  addressed her in Portuguese, and finally, losing all patience and finding
  that precious time was wasted in arguing with a poor creature incapable of
  reasoning in her present condition, he ordered a sailor to help him, caught
  her up in his arms, and proceeded to swing himself over, that he might carry
  her into the boat.</p>

  <p>But at that moment dark figures occupied the deck, and a man arrested him
  with his hand, while in a loud and authoritative voice he called, "No one
  leaves the vessel without my orders. Number Five, down into the boat and
  secure that. Number Seven, go with him. Now, one by one, and before each
  leaves, give over your purses and valuables that you are trying to save. No
  harm shall be done you, only make no resistance."</p>

  <p>The ship was in the hands of the wreckers.</p>

  <p>The men in the boat would have cast off at once, but the two men sent into
  it, Numbers Five and Seven, prevented them. The presence of the wreckers
  produced order where there had been confusion before. The man who had laid
  his hand on the Portuguese nun, and had given orders, was obeyed not only by
  his own men, but by the crew of the merchant vessel, and by the passengers,
  from whom all thoughts of resistance, if they ever rose, vanished at once.
  All alike, cowed and docile, obeyed without a murmur, and began to produce
  from their pockets whatever they had secured and hoped to carry ashore with
  them.</p>

  <p>"Nudding! me nudding!" gasped the nun.</p>

  <p>"Let her pass down," ordered the man who acted as captain. "Now the
  next&mdash;you!" he turned on the young passenger who had assisted the
  nun.</p>

  <p>"You scoundrel," shouted the young man, "you shall not have a penny of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"We shall see," answered the wrecker, and levelled a pistol at his head.
  "What answer do you make to this?"</p>

  <p>The young man struck up the pistol, and it was discharged into the air.
  Then he sprang on the captain, struck him in the chest, and grappled with
  him. In a moment a furious contest was engaged in between the two on the wet,
  sloping deck, sloping, for the cargo had shifted.</p>

  <p>"Hah!" shouted the wrecker, "a Cornishman."</p>

  <p>"Yes, a Cornishman," answered the youth.</p>

  <p>The wrecker knew whence he came by his method of wrestling.</p>

  <p>If there had been light, crew, invaders, and passengers would have
  gathered in a circle and watched the contest; but in the dark, lashed by
  foam, in the roar of the waves and the pipe of the wind, only one or two that
  were near were aware of the conflict. Some of the crew were below. They had
  got at the spirits and were drinking. One drunken sailor rushed forth
  swearing and blaspheming and striking about him. He was knocked down by a
  wrecker, and a wave that heaved over the deck lifted him and swept him over
  the bulwarks.</p>

  <p>The wrestle between the two men in the dark taxed the full nerves and the
  skill of each. The young passenger was strong and nimble, but he had found
  his match in the wrecker. The latter was skilful and of great muscular power.
  First one went down on the knee, then the other, but each was up again in a
  moment. A blinding whiff of foam and water slashed between them, stinging
  their eyes, swashing into their mouths, forcing them momentarily to relax
  their hold of each other, but next moment they had leaped at each other
  again. Now they held each other, breast to breast, and sought, with their
  arms bowed like the legs of grasshoppers, to strangle or break each other's
  necks. Then, like a clap of thunder, beat a huge billow against the stern,
  and rolled in a liquid heap over the deck, enveloping the wrestlers, and
  lifted them from their feet and cast them, writhing, pounding each other, on
  the deck.</p>

  <p>There were screams and gasps from the women as they escaped from the
  water; the nun shrieked to St. Joseph&mdash;she had lost her hold and fell
  overboard, but was caught and placed in the boat.</p>

  <p>"Now another," was the shout.</p>

  <p>"Hand me your money," demanded one of the wreckers. "Madam, have no fear.
  We do not hurt women. I will help you into the boat."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing&mdash;nothing but this! what shall I do if you take my
  money?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry&mdash;you must either remain and drown when the ship breaks up
  or give me the purse."</p>

  <p>She gave up the purse and was safely lodged below.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" gasped the captain of the wreckers in a moment of
  relaxation from the desperate struggle.</p>

  <p>"An honest man&mdash;and you a villain," retorted the young passenger, and
  the contest was recommenced.</p>

  <p>"Let go," said the wrecker, "and you shall be allowed to depart&mdash;and
  carry your money with you."</p>

  <p>"I ask no man's leave to carry what is my own," answered the youth. He put
  his hand to his waist and unbuckled a belt, to this belt was attached a pouch
  well weighted with metal. "There is all I have in the world&mdash;and with it
  I will beat your brains out." He whirled the belt and money bag round his
  head and brought it down with a crash upon his adversary, who staggered back.
  The young man struck at him again, but in the dark missed him, and with the
  violence of the blow and weight of the purse was carried forward, and on the
  slippery inclined planks fell.</p>

  <p>"Now I have you," shouted the other; he flung himself on the prostrate man
  and planted his knee on his back. But, assisted by the inclination of the
  deck, the young man slipped from beneath his antagonist, and half-rising
  caught him and dashed him against the rail.</p>

  <p>The wrecker was staggered for a moment, and had the passenger seized the
  occasion he might have finished the conflict; but his purse had slipped from
  his hand, and he groped for the belt till he found one end at his feet, and
  now he twisted the belt round and about his right arm and weighted his fist
  with the pouch.</p>

  <p>The captain recovered from the blow, and flung himself on his adversary,
  grasped his arms between the shoulder and elbow, and bore him back against
  the bulwark, drove him against it, and cast himself upon him.</p>

  <p>"I've spared your life so far. Now I'll spare you no more," said he, and
  the young man felt one of his arms released. He could not tell at the time,
  he never could decide after how he knew it, but he was certain that his enemy
  was groping at his side for his knife. Then the hand of the wrecker closed on
  his throat, and the young man's head was driven back over the rail, almost
  dislocating the neck.</p>

  <p>It was then as though the young man saw into the mind of him who had cast
  himself against him, and who was strangling him. He knew that he could not
  find his knife, but he saw nothing, only a fire and blood before his eyes
  that looked up into the black heavens, and he felt naught save agony at the
  nape of his neck, where his spine was turned back on the bulwarks.</p>

  <p>"Number Seven! any of you! an axe!" roared the wrecker. "By heaven you
  shall be as Wyvill! and float headless on the waves."</p>

  <p>"Coppinger!" cried the young man, by a desperate effort liberating his
  hand. He threw his arms round the wrecker. A dash and a boil of froth, and
  both went overboard, fighting as they fell into the surf.</p>

  <p>"In the King's name!" shouted a harsh voice.</p>

  <p>"Surround&mdash;secure them all. Now we have them and they shall not
  escape."</p>

  <p>The wreck was boarded by, and in the hands of, the coast-guard.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37"></a>XXXVII. &mdash; BRUISED NOT BROKEN.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Come with me, uncle!" said Judith.</p>

  <p>"My dear, I will follow you like a dog, everywhere."</p>

  <p>"I want to go to the rectory."</p>

  <p>"To the rectory! At this time of night!"</p>

  <p>"At once."</p>

  <p>When the down was left there was no longer necessity for hiding the
  lantern, as they were within lanes, and the light would not be seen at
  sea.</p>

  <p>The distance to the parsonage was not great, and the little party were
  soon there, but were somewhat puzzled how to find the door, owing to the
  radical transformations of the approaches effected by the new rector.</p>

  <p>Mr. Desiderius Mules was not in bed. He was in his study, without his
  collar and necktie, smoking, and composing a sermon. It is not only
  <i>lucus</i> which is derived from <i>non lucendo</i>. A study in many a
  house is equally misnamed. In that of Mr. Mules's house it had some claim,
  perhaps, to its title, for in it, once a week, Mr. Desiderius cudgelled his
  brains how to impart form to an inchoate mass of notes; but it hardly
  deserved its name as a place where the brain was exercised in absorption of
  information. The present study was the old pantry. The old study had been
  occupied by a man of reading and of thought. Perhaps it was not unsuitable
  that the pantry should become Mr. Mules's study, and where the maid had
  emptied her slop-water after cleaning forks and plates should be the place
  for the making of the theological slop-water that was to be poured forth on
  the Sunday. But&mdash;what a word has been here
  used&mdash;theological&mdash;another <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>, for there
  was nothing of theology proper in the stuff compounded by Mr. Mules.</p>

  <p>We shall best be able to judge by observing him engaged on his sermon for
  Sunday.</p>

  <p>In his mouth was a pipe, on the table a jar of bird's-eye; <i>item</i>, a
  tumbler of weak brandy and water to moisten his lips with occasionally. It
  was weak. Mr. Mules never took a drop more than was good for him.</p>

  <p>Before him were arranged in a circle his materials for composition. On his
  extreme left was what he termed his treacle-pot. That was a volume of
  unctuous piety. Then came his dish of flummery. That was a volume of ornate
  discourses by a crack ladies' preacher. Next his spice-box. That was a little
  store of anecdotes, illustrations, and pungent sayings. Pearson on the Creed,
  Bishop Andrews, or any work of solid divinity was not to be found either on
  his table or on his shelves. A Commentary was outspread, and a
  Concordance.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Desiderius Mules sipped his brandy and water, took a long
  whiff of his pipe, and then wrote his text. Then he turned to his Commentary
  and extracted from it junks of moralization upon his text and on other texts
  which his Concordance told him had more or less to do with his head text.
  Then he peppered his paper well over with quotations, those in six lines
  preferred to those in three.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the manufacturer of the sermon, "I must have a little treacle.
  I suppose those bumpkins will like it, but not much, I hate it myself. It is
  ridiculous. And I can dish up a trifle of flummery in here and there
  conveniently, and&mdash;let me see. I'll work up to a story near the tail
  somehow. But what heading shall I give my discourse? 'Pon my word I don't
  know what its subject is&mdash;we'll call it General Piety. That will do
  admirably. Yes, General Piety. Come in! Who's there?"</p>

  <p>A servant entered and said that there were Mr. Menaida and the lady that
  was married that morning, at the door, wanting to speak with him. Should she
  show them into the study?</p>

  <p>Mr. Mules looked at his brandy and water, then at his array of material
  for composition, and then at his neckerchief on the floor, and said: "No,
  into the drawing-room." The maid was to light the candles. He would put on
  his collar and be with them shortly.</p>

  <p>So the sermon had to be laid aside.</p>

  <p>Presently Mr. Desiderius Mules entered his drawing-room, where Judith,
  Uncle Zachie, and Jamie were awaiting him.</p>

  <p>"A late visit, but always welcome," said the rector. "Sorry I kept you
  waiting, but I was <i>en deshabille</i>. What can I do for you now, eh?"</p>

  <p>Judith was composed, she had formed her resolution.</p>

  <p>She said, "You married me this morning when I was unconscious. I answered
  but one of your questions. Will you get your prayer-book and I will make my
  responses to all those questions you put to me when I was in a dead
  faint."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not necessary. Sign the register and it is all right. Silence gives
  consent, you know."</p>

  <p>"I wish it otherwise, particularly, and then you can judge for yourself
  whether silence gives consent."</p>

  <p>Mr. Desiderius Mules ran back into his study, pulled a whiff at his pipe
  to prevent the fire from going out, moistened his untempered clay with brandy
  and water, and came back again with a Book of Common Prayer.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said he. "'Wilt thou have this man,' and so on&mdash;you
  answered to that, I believe. Then comes 'I, Judith, take thee, Curll, to my
  wedded husband'&mdash;you were indistinct over that, I believe."</p>

  <p>"I remember nothing about it. Now I will say distinctly my meaning. I will
  <i>not</i> take Curll Coppinger to my wedded husband, and thereto I will
  never give my troth&mdash;so help me, God."</p>

  <p>"Goodness gracious!" exclaimed the rector. "You put me in a queer
  position. I married you, and you can't undo what is done. You have the ring
  on your finger."</p>

  <p>"No, here it is. I return it."</p>

  <p>"I refuse to take it. I have nothing whatever to do with the ring. Captain
  Coppinger put it on your hand."</p>

  <p>"When I was unconscious."</p>

  <p>"But am I to be choused out of my fee&mdash;as out of other things!"</p>

  <p>"You shall have your fee. Do not concern yourself about that. I refuse to
  consider myself married. I refuse to sign the register, no man shall force me
  to it, and if it comes to law, here are witnesses, you yourself are a
  witness, that I was unconscious when you married me."</p>

  <p>"I shall get into trouble! This is a very unpleasant state of
  affairs."</p>

  <p>"It is more unpleasant for me than for you," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"It is a most awkward complication. Never heard of such a case before.
  Don't you think that after a good night's rest and a good supper&mdash;and
  let me advise a stiff glass of something warm, taken medicinally, you
  understand&mdash;that you will come round to a better mind."</p>

  <p>"To another mind I shall not come round. I suppose I am half
  married&mdash;never by my will shall that half be made into a whole."</p>

  <p>"And what do you want me to do?" asked Mr. Mules, thoroughly put out of
  his self-possession by this extraordinary scene.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," answered Judith, "save to bear testimony that I utterly and
  entirely refuse to complete the marriage which was half done&mdash;by
  answering to those questions with a consent, which I failed to answer in
  church because I fainted, and to wear the ring which was forced on me when I
  was insensible, and to sign the register now I am in full possession of my
  wits. We will detain you no longer."</p>

  <p>Judith left along with Jamie and Mr. Menaida, and Mr. Mules returned to
  his sermon. He pulled at his pipe till the almost expired fire was rekindled
  into glow, and he mixed himself a little more brandy and water. Then with his
  pipe in the corner of his mouth he looked at his discourse. It did not quite
  please him, it was undigested.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Desiderius. "My mind is all of a whirl, and I can do
  nothing to this now. It must go as it is&mdash;yet stay, I'll change the
  title. General Piety is rather pointless. I'll call it Practical Piety."</p>

  <p>Judith returned to Pentyre Glaze. She was satisfied with what she had
  done; anger and indignation were in her heart. The man to whom she had given
  her hand had enlisted her poor brother in the wicked work of luring
  unfortunate sailors to their destruction. She could hardly conceive of
  anything more diabolical than this form of wrecking: her Jamie was involved
  in the crime of drawing men to their death. A ship had been wrecked, she knew
  that by the minute guns, and if lives were lost from it, the guilt in a
  measure rested on the head of Jamie. But for her intervention he would have
  been taken in the act of showing light to mislead mariners, and would
  certainly have been brought before magistrates and most probably have been
  imprisoned. The thought that her brother, the son of such a father, should
  have escaped this disgrace through an accident only, and that he had been
  subjected to the risk by Coppinger, filled her veins with liquid fire.
  Thenceforth there could be nothing between her and Captain Cruel, save
  antipathy, resentment, and contempt on her part. His passion for her must
  cool or chase itself away. She would never yield to him a hair's breadth.</p>

  <p>Judith threw herself on her bed, in her clothes. She could not sleep.
  Wrath against Coppinger seethed in her young heart. Concerned she was for the
  wrecked, but concern for them was over-lapped by fiery indignation against
  the wrecker. There was also in her breast self-reproach. She had not accepted
  as final her father's judgment on the man. She had allowed Coppinger's
  admiration of herself to move her from a position of uncompromising
  hostility, and to awake in her suspicions that her dear, dear father might
  have been mistaken, and that the man he condemned might not be guilty as he
  supposed.</p>

  <p>As she lay tossing on her bed, turning from side to side, her face now
  flaming, then white, she heard a noise in the house. She sat up on her bed
  and listened. There was now no light in the room, and she would not go into
  that of her aunt to borrow one. Miss Trevisa might be asleep, and would be
  vexed to be disturbed. Moreover resentment against her aunt for having forced
  her into the marriage was strong in the girl's heart, and she had no wish to
  enter into any communications with her.</p>

  <p>So she sat on her bed, listening.</p>

  <p>There was certainly disturbance below. What was the meaning of it?</p>

  <p>Presently she heard her aunt's voice down-stairs. She was therefore not
  asleep in her room.</p>

  <p>Thereupon Judith descended the stairs to the hall. There she found Captain
  Coppinger being carried to his bedroom by two men, while Miss Trevisa held a
  light. He was streaming with water that made pools on the floor.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter? Is he hurt? Is he hurt seriously?" she asked, her
  woman's sympathy at once aroused by the sight of suffering.</p>

  <p>"He has had a bad fall," replied her aunt. "He went to a wreck that has
  been cast on Doom Bar, to help to save the unfortunate, and save what they
  value equally with their lives&mdash;their goods, and he was washed
  overboard. Fell into the sea, and was dashed against that boat. Yes&mdash;he
  is injured. No bones broken <i>this</i> time. This time he had to do with the
  sea and with men. But he is badly bruised. Go on," she said to those who were
  conveying Coppinger. "He is in pain, do you not see this as you stand here?
  Lay him on his bed, and remove his clothes. He is drenched to the skin. I
  will brew him a posset."</p>

  <p>"May I help you, aunt?"</p>

  <p>"I can do it myself."</p>

  <p>Judith remained with Miss Trevisa. She said nothing to her till the posset
  was ready. Then she offered to carry it to her husband.</p>

  <p>"As you will&mdash;here it is," said Aunt Dionysia.</p>

  <p>Thereupon Judith took the draught, and went with it to Captain Coppinger's
  room. He was in his bed. No one was with him, but a candle burned on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"You have come to me, Judith?" he said with glad surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I have brought you the posset. Drink it out to the last
  drop."</p>

  <p>She handed it to him; and he took the hot caudle.</p>

  <p>"I need not finish the bowl?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;to the last drop."</p>

  <p>He complied, and then suddenly withdrew the vessel from his lips. "What is
  this&mdash;at the bottom?&mdash;a ring?" He extracted a plain gold ring from
  the bowl.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this? It is a wedding-ring."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;mine."</p>

  <p>"It is early to lose it."</p>

  <p>"I threw it in."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;Judith&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"I return it to you."</p>

  <p>He raised himself on one elbow and looked at her fixedly with threatening
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?"</p>

  <p>"That ring was put on my finger when I was unconscious. Wait till I accept
  it freely."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;Judith&mdash;the wedding is over."</p>

  <p>"Only a half wedding."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;well&mdash;it shall soon be a whole one. We will have the
  register signed to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Judith shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You are acting strangely to-night," said he.</p>

  <p>"Answer me," said Judith. "Did you not send out Jamie with a light to
  mislead the sailors, and draw them on to Doom Bar?"</p>

  <p>"Jamie, again!" exclaimed Coppinger, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have to consider for Jamie. Answer me, did you not send
  him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He burst in angrily, "If you will&mdash;yes&mdash;he took the light to the
  shore. I knew there was a wreck. When a ship is in distress she must have a
  light."</p>

  <p>"You are not speaking the truth. Answer me, did you go on board the
  wrecked vessel to save those who were cast away?"</p>

  <p>"They would not have been saved without me. They had lost their
  heads&mdash;every one."</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger," said Judith, "I have lost all trust in you. I return
  you the ring which I will never wear. I have been to see the rector and told
  him that I refuse you, and I will never sign the register."</p>

  <p>"I will force the ring on to your finger," said Coppinger.</p>

  <p>"You are a man, stronger than I&mdash;but I can defend myself, as you know
  to your cost. Half married we are&mdash;and so must remain, and never, never
  shall we be more than that."</p>

  <p>Then she left the room, and Coppinger dashed his posset cup to the ground,
  but held the ring and turned it in his fingers, and the light flickered on
  it, a red gold ring like that red gold hair that was about his throat.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38"></a>XXXVIII. &mdash; A CHANGE OF WIND.</h2>

  <p class="first">After many years of separation, father and son were together
  once more. Early in the morning after the wreck in Dover Bar, Oliver Menaida
  appeared at his father's cottage, bruised and wet through, but in health and
  with his purse in his hand.</p>

  <p>When he had gone overboard with the wrecker, the tide was falling and he
  had been left on the sands of the Bar, where he had spent a cold and
  miserable night, with only the satisfaction to warm him that his life and his
  money were his. He was not floating, like Wyvill, a headless trunk, nor was
  he without his pouch that contained his gold and valuable papers.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida was roused from sleep very early to admit Oliver. The young
  man had recognized where he was, as soon as sufficient light was in the sky,
  and he had been carried across the estuary of the Camel by one of the boats
  that was engaged in clearing the wreck, under the direction of the captain of
  the coast-guard. But three men had been arrested on the wrecked vessel, three
  of those who had boarded her for plunder, all the rest had effected their
  escape, and it was questionable whether these three could be brought to
  justice, as they protested they had come from shore as salvers. They had
  heard the signals of distress and had put off to do what they could for those
  who were in jeopardy. No law forbad men coming to the assistance of the
  wrecked. It could not be proved that they had laid their hands on and kept
  for their own use any of the goods of the passengers or any of the cargo of
  the vessel. It was true that from some of the women their purses had been
  exacted, but the men taken professed their innocence of having done this, and
  the man who had made the demand&mdash;there was but one&mdash;had
  disappeared. Unhappily he had not been secured.</p>

  <p>It was a question also whether proceedings could be taken relative to the
  exhibition of lights that had misguided the merchantman. The coast-guard had
  come on Mr. Menaida and Judith on the downs with a light, but he was
  conducting her to her new house, and there could be entertained against them
  no suspicion of having acted with evil intent.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, father," said Oliver, after he was rested, had slept and
  fed, "I am pretty sure that the scoundrel who attacked me was Captain
  Coppinger. I cannot swear. It is many years now since I heard his voice, and
  when I did hear it, it was but very occasionally. What made me suspect at the
  time that I was struggling with Captain Cruel was that he had my head back
  over the gunwale and called for an axe, swearing that he would treat me like
  Wyvill. That story was new when I left home, and folk said that Coppinger had
  killed the man."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida fidgeted.</p>

  <p>"That was the man who was at the head of the entire gang. He it was who
  issued the orders which the rest obeyed; and he, moreover, was the man who
  required the passengers to deliver up their purses and valuables before he
  allowed them to enter the boat."</p>

  <p>"Between ourselves," said Uncle Zachie, rubbing his chin and screwing up
  his mouth, "between you and me and the poker, I have no doubt about it, and I
  could bring his neck into the halter if I chose."</p>

  <p>"Then why do you not, father? The ruffian would not have scrupled to hack
  off my head had an axe been handy, or had I waited till he had got hold of
  one."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There are a deal of things that belong to all things," he said. "I was on
  the down with my little pet and idol, Judith, and we had the lantern, and it
  was that lantern that proved fatal to your vessel."</p>

  <p>"What, father! We owe our wreck to you?"</p>

  <p>"No, and yet it must be suffered to be so supposed, I must allow many hard
  words to be rapped out against me, my want of consideration, my
  scatterbrainedness. I admit that I am not a Solomon, but I should not be such
  an ass, such a criminal, as on a night like the last to walk over the downs
  above the cliffs with a lantern. Nevertheless I cannot clear myself."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because of Judith."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand."</p>

  <p>"I was escorting her home, to her husband's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is she married?"</p>

  <p>"'Pon my word, I can't say; half and half&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you."</p>

  <p>"I will explain, later," said Mr. Menaida. "It's a perplexing question,
  and though I was brought up at the law, upon my word I can't say how the law
  would stand in the matter."</p>

  <p>"But how about the false lights?"</p>

  <p>"I am coming to that. When the Preventive men came on us, led by
  Scantlebray&mdash;and why he was with them, and what concern it was of his, I
  don't know&mdash;when the guard found us, it is true Judith had the lantern,
  but it was under her cloak."</p>

  <p>"We, however, saw the light for some time."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but neither she nor I showed it. We had not brought a light with us.
  We knew that it would be wrong to do so, but we came on someone driving an
  ass with a lantern affixed to the head of the brute."</p>

  <p>"Then say so."</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;that person was Judith's brother."</p>

  <p>"But he is an idiot."</p>

  <p>"He was sent out with the light."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, that person who sent him will be punished and the silly boy
  will come off scot free."</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;he who sent the boy was Judith's husband."</p>

  <p>"Judith's husband! Who is that?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"Well, what of that? The man is a double-dyed villain. He ought to be
  brought to justice. Consider the crimes of which he has been guilty. Consider
  what he has done this past night. I cannot see, father, that merely because
  you esteem a young person, who may be very estimable, we should let a
  consummate scoundrel go free, solely because he is her husband. He has
  brought a fine ship to wreck, he has produced much wretchedness and alarm.
  Indeed, he has been the occasion of some lives being lost, for one or two of
  the sailors, thinking we were going to Davy Jones's locker, got drunk and
  were carried overboard. Then, consider, he robbed some of the unhappy,
  frightened women as they were escaping. Bless me!" Oliver sprang up and paced
  the room. "It makes my blood seethe. The fellow deserves no consideration.
  Give him up to justice; let him be hung or transported."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida passed his hand through his hair, and lit his pipe.</p>

  <p>"'Pon my word," said he, "there's a good deal to be said on your
  side&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is everything to be said on my side," urged Oliver, with vehemence.
  "The man is engaged on his nefarious traffic. Winter is setting in. He will
  wreck other vessels as well, and if you spare him now, then the guilt of
  causing the destruction of other vessels and the loss of more lives will rest
  in a measure on you."</p>

  <p>"And yet," pleaded Menaida, senior, "I don't know&mdash;I don't
  like&mdash;you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are moved by a little sentiment for Miss Judith Trevisa, or&mdash;I
  beg her pardon&mdash;Mrs. Cruel Coppinger. But it is a mistake, father. If
  you had had this sentimental regard for her, and value for her, you should
  not have suffered her to marry such a scoundrel, past redemption."</p>

  <p>"I could not help it. I told her that the man was bad&mdash;that is to
  say&mdash;I believed he was a smuggler, and that he was generally credited
  with being a wrecker as well. But there were other influences&mdash;other
  forces at work&mdash;I could not help it."</p>

  <p>"The sooner we can rid her of this villain the better," persisted Oliver.
  "I cannot share your scruples, father."</p>

  <p>Then the door opened and Judith entered.</p>

  <p>Oliver stood up. He had reseated himself on the opposite side of the fire
  to his father, after the ebullition of wrath that had made him pace the
  room.</p>

  <p>He saw before him a delicate, girlish figure&mdash;a child in size and in
  innocence of face, but with a woman's force of character in the brow, clear
  eyes, and set mouth. She was ivory white; her golden hair was spread out
  about her face&mdash;blown by the wind, it was a veritable halo, such as is
  worn by an angel of La Fiesole in Cimabue. Her long, slender, white throat
  was bare; she had short sleeves, to the elbows, and bare arms. Her stockings
  were white, under the dark-blue gown. Oliver Menaida had spent a good many
  years in Portugal, and had seen flat faces, sallow complexions, and dark
  hair&mdash;women without delicacy of bone and grace of figure&mdash;and, on
  his return to England, the first woman he saw was Judith&mdash;this little,
  pale, red-gold-headed creature, with eyes iridescent and full of a soul that
  made them sparkle and change color with every change of emotion in the heart
  and of thought in the busy brain.</p>

  <p>Oliver was a fine man, tall, with a bright and honest face, fair hair, and
  blue eyes. He started back from his seat and looked at this child-bride who
  entered his father's cottage. He knew at once who she was, from the
  descriptions he had received of her from his father in letters from home.</p>

  <p>He did not understand how she had become the wife of Cruel Coppinger. He
  had not heard the story from his father, still less could he comprehend the
  enigmatical words of his father relative to her half-and-half marriage. As
  now he looked on this little figure, that breathed an atmosphere of perfect
  purity, of untouched innocence, and yet not mixed with that weakness which so
  often characterizes innocence&mdash;on the contrary blended with a strength
  and force beyond her years&mdash;Oliver's heart rose with a bound and smote
  against his ribs. He was overcome with a qualm of infinite pity for this
  poor, little, fragile being, whose life was linked with that of one so
  ruthless as Coppinger. Looking at that anxious face, at those lustrous eyes,
  set in lids that were reddened with weeping, he knew that the iron had
  entered into her soul, that she had suffered and was suffering then; nay,
  more, that the life opening before her would be one of almost unrelieved
  contrariety and sorrow.</p>

  <p>At once he understood his father's hesitation when he urged him to
  increase the load of shame and trouble that lay on her. He could not withdraw
  his eyes from Judith. She was to him a vision so wonderful, so strange, so
  thrilling, so full of appeal to his admiration and to his chivalry.</p>

  <p>"Here, Ju! here is my Oliver, of whom I have told you so much!" said
  Menaida, running up to Judith. "Oliver, boy! she has read your letters, and I
  believe they gave her almost as great pleasure as they did me. She was always
  interested in you. I mean ever since she came into my house, and we have
  talked together about you, and upon my word it really seemed as if you were
  to her as a brother."</p>

  <p>A faint smile came on Judith's face; she held out her hand and said:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have come to love your dear father, who has been to me so kind,
  and to Jamie also; he has been full of thought&mdash;I mean kindness. What
  has interested him has interested me. I call him uncle, so I will call you
  cousin. May it be so?"</p>

  <p>He touched her hand; he did not dare to grasp the frail, slender white
  hand. But as he touched it, there boiled up in his heart a rage against
  Coppinger, that he&mdash;this man steeped in iniquity&mdash;should have
  obtained possession of a pearl set in ruddy gold&mdash;a pearl that he was,
  so thought Oliver, incapable of appreciating.</p>

  <p>"How came you here?" asked Judith. "Your father has been expecting you
  some time, but not so soon."</p>

  <p>"I am come off the wreck."</p>

  <p>She started back and looked fixedly on him.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;you were wrecked?&mdash;in that ship last night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. After the fog lifted we were quite lost as to where we were, and ran
  aground."</p>

  <p>"What led you astray?"</p>

  <p>"Our own bewilderment and ignorance as to where we were."</p>

  <p>"And you got ashore?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was put across by the Preventive men. I spent half the night on
  Doom Bar."</p>

  <p>"Were any lives lost?"</p>

  <p>"Only those lost their lives who threw them away. Some tipsy sailors, who
  got at the spirits, and drank themselves drunk."</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;did any others&mdash;I mean did any wreckers come to your
  ship?"</p>

  <p>"Salvors? Yes; salvors came to save what could be saved. That is always
  so."</p>

  <p>Judith drew a long breath of relief; but she could not forget Jamie and
  the ass.</p>

  <p>"You were not led astray by false lights?"</p>

  <p>"Any lights we might have seen were sure to lead us astray, as we did not
  in the least know where we were."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Judith. Then she turned to Uncle Zachie.</p>

  <p>"I have a favor to ask of you."</p>

  <p>"Anything you ask I will do."</p>

  <p>"It is to let Jamie live here, he is more likely to be well employed, less
  likely to get in wrong courses, than at the Glaze. Alas! I cannot be with him
  always and everywhere, and I cannot trust him there. Here he has his
  occupation; he can help you with the birds. There he has nothing, and the men
  he meets are not such as I desire that he should associate with. Besides, you
  know, uncle, what occurred last night, and why I am anxious to get him
  away."</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered the old man; "I'll do my best. He shall be welcome
  here."</p>

  <p>"Moreover, Captain Coppinger dislikes him. He might in a fit of anger
  maltreat him; I cannot say that he <i>would</i>, but he makes no concealment
  of his dislike."</p>

  <p>"Send Jamie here."</p>

  <p>"And then I can come every day and see him, how he is getting on, and can
  encourage him with his work, and give him his lessons as usual."</p>

  <p>"It will always be a delight to me to have you here."</p>

  <p>"And to me&mdash;to come." She might have said, "to be away from Pentyre,"
  but she refrained from saying that. With a faint smile&mdash;a smile that was
  but the twinkle of a tear&mdash;she held out her hand to say farewell.</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie clasped it, and then, suddenly, she bent and kissed his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"You must not do that," said he, hastily.</p>

  <p>She looked piteously into his eyes, and said, in a whisper that he alone
  could hear&mdash;"I am so lonely."</p>

  <p>When she was gone the old man returned to the ingle nook and resumed his
  pipe. He did not speak, but every now and then he put one finger furtively to
  his cheek, wiped off something, and drew very vigorous whiffs of tobacco.</p>

  <p>Nor was Oliver inclined to speak; he gazed dreamily into the fire, with
  contracted brows, and hands that were clenched.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour thus passed. Then Oliver looked up at his father, and
  said: "There is worse wrecking than that of ships. Can nothing be done for
  this poor little craft, drifting in fog&mdash;aimless!&mdash;and going on to
  the rocks?"</p>

  <p>Uncle Zachie again wiped his cheek, and in his thoughtlessness wiped it
  with the bowl of his pipe and burnt himself. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me what you meant when you said she was but half married," said
  Oliver.</p>

  <p>Then his father related to him the circumstances of Judith's forced
  engagement, and of the incomplete marriage of the day before.</p>

  <p>"By my soul!" exclaimed Oliver. "He must&mdash;he shall not treat her as
  he did our vessel."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Oliver! if I had had my way&mdash;I had designed her for you."</p>

  <p>"For me!"</p>

  <p>Oliver bent his head and looked hard into the fire, where strange forms of
  light were dancing&mdash;dancing and disappearing.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Menaida said, between his whiffs: "Surely a change of wind,
  Oliver. A little while ago, and she was not to be considered; justice above
  all, and Judith sacrificed, if need be&mdash;now it is Judith above all."</p>

  <p>"Yes," musingly, "above all."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39"></a>XXXIX. &mdash; A FIRST LIE.</h2>

  <p class="first">As a faithful, as a loving wife almost, did Judith attend to
  Coppinger for the day or two before he was himself again. He had been
  bruised, that was all. The waves had driven him against the boat, and he had
  been struck by an oar; but the very fact that he was driven against the boat
  had proved his salvation, for he was drawn on board, and his own men carried
  him swiftly to the bank, and, finding him unable to walk, conveyed him home.
  On reaching home a worse blow than that of the oar had struck him, and struck
  him on the heart, and it was dealt him by his wife. She bade him put away
  from him for ever the expectation, the hope, of her becoming his in more than
  name.</p>

  <p>Pain and disappointment made him irritable. He broke out into angry
  complaint, and Judith had much to endure. She did not answer him. She had
  told him her purpose, and she would neither be bullied nor cajoled to alter
  it.</p>

  <p>Judith had much time to herself; she wandered through the rooms of Pentyre
  during the day without encountering anyone, and then strolled on the cliffs;
  wherever she went she carried her trouble with her, gnawing at her heart.
  There was no deliverance for her, and she did not turn her mind in that
  direction. She would remain what she was&mdash;Coppinger's half-wife, a wife
  without a wedding-ring, united to him by a most dubiously legal ceremony. She
  bore his name, she was content to do that; she must bear with his love turned
  to fury by disappointment. She would do that till it died away before her
  firm and unchangeable opposition.</p>

  <p>"What will be said," growled Coppinger, "when it is seen that you wear no
  ring?"</p>

  <p>"I will wear my mother's, and turn the stone within," answered Judith,
  "then it will be like our marriage, a semblance, nothing more."</p>

  <p>She did appear next day with a ring. When the hand was closed, it looked
  like a plain gold wedding hoop. When she opened and turned her hand, it was
  apparent that within was a small brilliant. A modest ring, a very inexpensive
  one, that her father had given to her mother as a guard. Modest and
  inexpensive because his purse could afford no better; not because he would
  not have given her the best diamonds available, had he possessed the means to
  purchase them.</p>

  <p>This ring had been removed from the dead finger of her mother, and Mr.
  Peter Trevisa had preserved it as a present for the daughter.</p>

  <p>Almost every day Judith went to Polzeath to give lessons to Jamie, and to
  see how the boy was going on. Jamie was happy with Mr. Menaida, he liked a
  little desultory work, and Oliver was kind to him, took him walks, and talked
  to him of scenes in Portugal.</p>

  <p>Very often, indeed, did Judith, when she arrived, find Oliver at his
  father's. He would sometimes sit through the lesson, often attend her back to
  the gate of Pentyre. His conduct toward her was deferential, tinged with
  pity. She could see in his eyes, read in his manner of address, that he knew
  her story, and grieved for her, and would do anything he could to release her
  from her place of torment, if he knew how. But he never spoke to her of
  Coppinger, never of her marriage, and the peculiar features that attended it.
  She often ventured on the topic of the wreck, and he saw that she was probing
  him to discover the truth concerning it, but he on no occasion allowed
  himself to say anything that could give her reason to believe her husband was
  the cause of the ship being lost, nor did he tell her of his own desperate
  conflict with the wrecker captain on board the vessel.</p>

  <p>He was a pleasant companion, cheerful and entertaining. Having been
  abroad, though not having travelled widely, he could tell much about
  Portugal, and something about Spain. Judith's eager mind was greedy after
  information, and it diverted her thoughts from painful topics to hear and
  talk about orange and lemon groves, the vineyards, the flower-gardens, the
  manners and customs of the people of Portugal, to see sketches of interesting
  places, and of the costumes of the peasantry. What drew her to Oliver
  specially was, however, his consideration for Jamie, to whom he was always
  kind, and whom he was disposed to amuse.</p>

  <p>The wreck of the merchantman on Doom Bar had caused a great commotion
  among the inhabitants of Cornwall. All the gentry, clergy, and the farmers
  and yeomen not immediately on the coast, felt that wrecking was not only a
  monstrous act of inhumanity, but was a scandal to the county, and ought to be
  peremptorily suppressed, and those guilty of it brought to justice. It was
  currently reported that the merchantman from Oporto was wilfully wrecked, and
  that an attempt had been made to rob and plunder the passengers and the
  vessel. But the evidence in support of this view was of little force. The
  only persons who had been found with a light on the cliffs were Mr. Menaida,
  whom every one respected for his integrity, and Judith, the daughter of the
  late rector of St. Enodoc, the most strenuous and uncompromising denouncer of
  wrecking. No one, however malicious, could believe either to be guilty of
  more than imprudence.</p>

  <p>The evidence as to the attempt of wreckers to invade the ship, and plunder
  it and the passengers also broke down. One lady alone could swear that her
  purse had been forcibly taken from her. The Portuguese men could hardly
  understand English, and though she asserted that she had been asked for
  money, she could not say that anything had been taken from her. It was quite
  possible that she had misunderstood an order given her to descend into the
  boat.</p>

  <p>The night had been dark, the lady who had been robbed could not swear to
  the identity of the man who had taken her purse, she could not even say that
  it was one of those who had come to the vessel, and was not one of the crew.
  The crew had behaved notoriously badly, some had been drunk, and it was
  possible that one of these fellows, flushed with spirits, had demanded and
  taken her money.</p>

  <p>There were two or three St. Enodoc men arrested because found on the ship
  at the time, but they persisted in the declaration that, hearing signals of
  distress, they had kindled a light and set it in the tower window of the
  church as a guide to the shipwrecked, and had gone to the vessel aground on
  Doom Bar, with the intention of offering every assistance in their power to
  the castaways. They asserted that they had found the deck in confusion. The
  seamen drunk and lost to discipline, the passengers helpless and frightened,
  and that it was only owing to them that some sort of order was brought about,
  or attempted. The arrival of the coast-guard interfered with their efforts to
  be useful.</p>

  <p>The magistrates were constrained to dismiss the case, although possessed
  with the moral conviction that the matter was not as the accused represented.
  The only person who could have given evidence that might have consigned them
  to prison was Oliver, and he was not called upon to give witness.</p>

  <p>But, although the case had broken down completely, an uneasy and angry
  feeling prevailed. People were not convinced that the wreck was accidental,
  and they believed that but for the arrival of the guard, the passengers would
  have been robbed and the ship looted. It was true enough that a light had
  been exhibited from St. Enodoc tower, but that served as a guide to those who
  rushed upon the wreck, and was every whit as much to their advantage as to
  that of the shipwrecked men. For, suppose that the crew and passengers had
  got off in their boats, they would have made, naturally, for the light, and
  who could say but that a gang of ruffians was not waiting on the shore to
  plunder them as they landed.</p>

  <p>The general feeling in the county was one of vexation that more prompt
  action had not been taken, or that the action taken had not been more
  successful. No man showed this feeling more fully than Mr. Scantlebray, who
  hunted with the coast-guard for his own ends, and who had felt sanguine that
  in this case Coppinger would be caught.</p>

  <p>That Coppinger was at the bottom of the attempt, which had been partly
  successful, few doubted, and yet there was not a shadow of proof against him.
  But that, according to common opinion, only showed how deep was his
  craft.</p>

  <p>The state of Judith's mind was also one of unrest. She had a conviction
  seated in her heart that all was not right, and yet she had no sound cause
  for charging her husband with being a deliberate wrecker. Jamie had gone out
  with his ass and the lantern, that was true, but was Jamie's account of the
  affair to be relied on? When questioned he became confused. He never could be
  trusted to recall, twenty-four hours after an event, the particulars exactly
  as they occurred. Any suggestive queries drew him aside, and without an
  intent to deceive he would tell what was a lie, simply because he could not
  distinguish between realities and fleeting impressions. She knew that if she
  asked him whether Coppinger had fastened the lantern to the head of his
  donkey, and had bidden him drive the creature slowly up and down the
  inequalities of the surface of the cliffs, he would assent, and say it was
  so; but, then, if she were to say to him, "Now, Jamie, did not Captain
  Coppinger tell you on no account to show the light till you reached the shore
  at St. Enodoc, and then to fix it steadily," that his face would for a moment
  assume a vacant, then a distressed expression, and he would finally say that
  he believed it really was so. No reliance was to be placed on anything he
  said, except at the moment, and not always then. He was liable to
  misunderstand directions, and by a stupid perversity to act exactly contrary
  to the instructions given him.</p>

  <p>Judith heard nothing of the surmises that floated in the neighborhood, but
  she knew enough to be uneasy. She had been somewhat reassured by Oliver
  Menaida; she could see no reason why he should withhold the truth from her.
  Was it, then, possible after all that Captain Coppinger had gone to the
  rescue of the wrecked people, that he had sent the light not to mislead, but
  to direct them aright?</p>

  <p>It was Judith's fate&mdash;so it seemed&mdash;to be never certain whether
  to think the worst of Coppinger, or to hold that he had been misjudged by
  her. He had been badly hurt in his attempt to rescue the crew and
  passengers&mdash;according to Aunt Dionysia's account. If she were to believe
  this story, then he was deserving of respect.</p>

  <p>Judith began to recover some of her cheerfulness, some of her freshness of
  looks. This was due to the abatement of her fears. Coppinger had angrily,
  sullenly, accepted the relation which she had assured him must subsist
  between them, and which could never be altered.</p>

  <p>Aunt Dionysia was peevish and morose indeed. She had been disappointed in
  her hope of getting into Othello Cottage before Christmas; but she had
  apparently received a caution from Coppinger not to exhibit ill-will toward
  his wife by word or token, and she restrained herself, though with manifest
  effort. That sufficed Judith. She no longer looked for, cared for love from
  her aunt. It satisfied her if Miss Trevisa left her unmolested.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Judith enjoyed the walk to Polzeath every day, and, somehow, the
  lessons to Jamie gave her an interest that she had never found in them
  before. Oliver was so helpful. When Jamie was stubborn, he persuaded him with
  a joke or a promise to laugh and put aside his ill-humor, and attack the task
  once more. The little gossiping talk after the lesson with Oliver, or with
  Oliver and his father, was a delight to her. She looked forward to it, from
  day to day, naturally, reasonably, for at the Glaze she had no one with whom
  to converse, no one with the same general interests as herself, the same
  knowledge of books, and pleasure in the acquisition of information.</p>

  <p>On mountain sides there are floral zones. The rhododendron and the gentian
  luxuriate at a certain level, above is the zone of the blue hippatica, the
  soldanella, and white crocus; below is the belt of mealy primula and lilac
  clematis. So is it in the world of minds&mdash;they have their levels, and
  can only live on those levels. Transplant them to a higher or to a lower zone
  and they suffer, and die.</p>

  <p>Judith found no one at Pentyre with whom she could associate with
  pleasure. It was only when she was at Polzeath with Uncle Zachie and Oliver
  that she could talk freely and feel in her element.</p>

  <p>One day Oliver said to her, "Judith"&mdash;for, on the understanding that
  they were cousins, they called each other by their Christian
  names&mdash;"Judith! are you going to the ball at Wadebridge after
  Christmas?"</p>

  <p>"Ball, Oliver, what ball?"</p>

  <p>"That which Mr. Mules is giving for the restoration of his church."</p>

  <p>"I do not know. I&mdash;yes, I have heard of it; but I had clean forgotten
  all about it. I had rather not."</p>

  <p>"But you must, and promise me three dances, at least."</p>

  <p>"I do not know what to say. Captain Coppinger"&mdash;she never spoke of
  her husband by his Christian name, never thought of him as other than Captain
  Coppinger. Did she think of Oliver as Mr. Menaida, junior? "Captain Coppinger
  has not said anything to me about it of late. I do not wish to go. My dear
  father's death&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But the dance is after Christmas. And, you know, it is for a sacred
  purpose. Think, every whirl you take puts a new stone on the foundations, and
  every setting to your partner in quadrille adds a pane of glass to the
  battered windows."</p>

  <p>"I do not know," again said Judith, and became grave. Her heart fluttered.
  She would like to be at the ball&mdash;and dance three dances with
  Oliver&mdash;but would Captain Coppinger suffer her? Would he expect to dance
  with her all the evening? If that were so, she would not like to go. "I
  really do not know," again she said, clasped her hands on her knees, and
  sighed.</p>

  <p>"Why that sigh, Judith?"</p>

  <p>She looked up, dropped her eyes in confusion, and said faintly, "I do not
  know," and that was her first lie.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40"></a>XL. &mdash; THE DIAMOND BUTTERFLY.</h2>

  <p class="first">Poor little fool! Shrewd in maintaining her conflict with
  Cruel Coppinger&mdash;always on the defensive, ever on guard, she was sliding
  unconsciously, without the smallest suspicion of danger, into a state that
  must eventually make her position more desperate and intolerable. In her
  inexperience she had never supposed that her own heart could be a traitor
  within the city walls. She took pleasure in the society of Oliver, and
  thought no wrong in so doing. She liked him, and would have reproached
  herself had she not done so.</p>

  <p>Her relations with Coppinger remained strained. He was a good deal from
  home; indeed, he went on a cruise in his vessel, the Black Prince, and was
  absent for a month. He hoped that in his absence she might come to a better
  mind. They met, when he was at home, at meals; at other times not at all. He
  went his way, she went hers. Whether the agitation of men's minds relative to
  the loss of the merchantman, and the rumors concerning the manner of its
  loss, had made Captain Cruel think it were well for him to absent himself for
  a while, till they had blown away, or whether he thought that his business
  required his attention elsewhere, or that by being away from home his wife
  might be the readier to welcome him, and come out of her vantage castle, and
  lay down her arms, cannot be said for certain; probably all these motives
  combined to induce him to leave Pentyre for five or six weeks.</p>

  <p>While he was away Judith was lighter in heart. He returned shortly before
  Christmas, and was glad to see her more like her old self, with cheeks
  rounder, less livid, eyes less sunken, less like those of a hunted beast, and
  with a step that had resumed its elasticity. But he did not find her more
  disposed to receive him with affection as a husband. He thought that probably
  some change in the monotony of life at Pentyre might be of advantage, and he
  somewhat eagerly entered into the scheme for the ball at Wadebridge. She had
  been kept to books and to the society of her father too much, in days gone
  by, and had become whimsical and prudish. She must learn some of the
  enjoyments of life, and then she would cling to the man who opened to her a
  new sphere of happiness.</p>

  <p>"Judith," said he, "we will certainly go to this ball. It will be a
  pleasant one. As it is for a charitable purpose, all the neighborhood will be
  there. Squire Humphrey Prideaux of Prideaux Place, the Matthews of
  Roscarrock, the Molesworths of Pencarrow, and every one worth knowing in the
  country round for twelve miles. But you will be the queen of the ball."</p>

  <p>Judith at first thought of appearing at the dance in her simplest evening
  dress; she was shy and did not desire to attract attention. Her own position
  was anomalous, because that of Coppinger was anomalous. He passed as a
  gentleman in a part of the country not very exacting that the highest culture
  should prevail in the upper region of society. He had means, and he owned a
  small estate. But no one knew whence he came, or what was the real source
  whence he derived his income. Suspicion attached to him as engaged in both
  smuggling and wrecking, neither of which were regarded as professions
  consonant with gentility. The result of this uncertainty relative to
  Coppinger was that he was not received into the best society. The gentlemen
  knew him and greeted him in the hunting-field, and would dine with him at his
  house. The ladies, of course, had never been invited, because he was an
  unmarried man. The gentlemen probably had dealings with him about which they
  said nothing to their wives. It is certain that the Bodmin wine-merchant
  grumbled that the great houses of the north of Cornwall did not patronize him
  as they ought, and that no wine-merchant was ever able to pick up a
  subsistence at Wadebridge. Yet the country gentry were by no means given to
  temperance, and their cellars were being continually refilled.</p>

  <p>It was not their interest to be on bad terms with Coppinger, one must
  conjecture, for they went somewhat out of their way to be civil to him.</p>

  <p>Coppinger knew this, and thought that now he was married an opportunity
  had come in this charity ball for the introduction of Judith to society, and
  that to the best society, and he trusted to her merits and beauty, and to his
  own influence with the gentlemen, to obtain for her admission to the houses
  of the neighborhood. As the daughter of the Rev. Peter Trevisa, who had been
  universally respected, not only as a gentleman and a scholar, but also as a
  representative of an ancient Cornish family of untold antiquity, she had a
  perfect right to be received into the highest society of Cornwall, but her
  father had been a reserved and poor man. He did not himself care for
  associating with fox-hunting and sporting squires, nor would he accept
  invitations when he was unable to return them. Consequently Judith had gone
  about very little when at St. Enodoc rectory. Moreover, she had been but a
  child, and was known only by name to those who lived in the neighborhood. She
  was personally acquainted with none of the county people.</p>

  <p>Captain Cruel had small doubt but that, the ice once broken, Judith would
  make friends, and would be warmly received. The neighborhood was scantily
  peppered over with county family-seats, and the families found the winters
  tedious, and were glad of any accession to their acquaintance, and of another
  house opened to them for entertainment.</p>

  <p>If Judith were received well, and found distraction from her morbid and
  fantastic thoughts, then she would be grateful to him&mdash;so thought
  Coppinger&mdash;grateful for having brought her into a more cheerful and
  bright condition of life than that in which she had been reared. Following
  thereon, her aversion for him, or shyness toward him, would give way.</p>

  <p>And Judith&mdash;what were her thoughts? Her mind was a little fluttered,
  she had to consider what to wear. At first she would go simply clad, then her
  aunt insisted that, as a bride, she must appear in suitable garb, that in
  which she had been married, not that with the two sleeves for one side, which
  had been laid by. Then the question of the jewellery arose. Judith did not
  wish to wear it, but yielded to her aunt's advice. Miss Trevisa represented
  to her that, having the diamonds, she ought to wear them, and that not to
  wear them would hurt and offend Captain Coppinger, who had given them to her.
  This she was reluctant to do. However, she consented to oblige and humor him
  in such a small matter.</p>

  <p>The night arrived, and Judith was dressed for the ball. Never before had
  Coppinger seen her in evening costume, and his face beamed with pride as he
  looked on her in her white silk dress, with ornaments of white satiny bugles
  in sprigs edging throat and sleeves, and forming a rich belt about the waist.
  She wore the diamond butterfly in her bosom, and the two earrings to match. A
  little color was in her delicately pure cheeks, brought there by excitement.
  She had never been at a ball before, and with an innocent, childish
  simplicity she wondered what Oliver Menaida would think of her in her
  ball-dress.</p>

  <p>Judith and Coppinger arrived somewhat late, and most of those who had
  taken tickets were already there. Sir William and Lady Molesworth were there,
  and the half-brother of Sir William, John Molesworth, rector of St. Breock,
  and his wife, the daughter of Sir John S. Aubyn. With the baronet and his
  lady had come a friend, staying with them at Pencarrow, and Lady Knighton,
  wife of an Indian judge. The Matthews were there; the Tremaynes came all the
  way from Heligan, as owning property in St. Enodoc, and so, in duty bound to
  support the charity; the Prideauxs were there from Place; and many, if not
  all, of the gentry of various degrees who resided within twelve to fifteen
  miles of Wadebridge were also there.</p>

  <p>The room was not one of any interest, it was long, had a good floor, which
  is the main thing considered by dancers, a gallery at one end for the
  instrumentalists, and a draught which circulated round the walls, and cut the
  throats of the old ladies who acted as wall-fruit. There was, however, a room
  to which they could adjourn to play cards. And many of the dowagers and old
  maids had brought with them little silver linked purses in which was as much
  money as they had made up their minds to lose that evening.</p>

  <p>The dowager Lady Molesworth in a red turban was talking to Lady Knighton,
  a lady who had been pretty, but whose complexion had been spoiled by Indian
  suns, and to her Sir William was offering a cup of tea.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Lady Knighton, "how tremulous my hand is. I have been like
  this for some years&mdash;indeed ever since I was in this neighborhood
  before."</p>

  <p>"I did not know you had honored us with a visit on a previous occasion,"
  said Sir William.</p>

  <p>"It was very different from the present, I can assure you," answered the
  lady. "Now it is voluntarily&mdash;then it was much the contrary. Now I have
  come among very dear and kind friends, then&mdash;I fell among thieves."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"It was on my return from India," said Lady Knighton. "Look at my hand!"
  She held forth her arm, and showed how it shook as with palsy. "This hand was
  firm then. I even played several games of spellikins on board ship on the
  voyage home, and, Sir William, I won invariably, so steady was my hold of the
  crook, so evenly did I raise each of the little sticks. But ever since then I
  have had this nervous tremor that makes me dread holding anything."</p>

  <p>"But how came it about?" asked the baronet.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you, but&mdash;who is that just entered the room?" she
  pointed with trembling finger.</p>

  <p>Judith had come in along with Captain Coppinger, and stood near the door,
  the light of the wax candles twinkling in her bugles, glancing in flashes
  from her radiant hair. She was looking about her, and her bosom heaved, she
  sought Oliver, and he was near at hand. A flush of pleasure sprang into her
  cheeks as she caught his eye, and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"I demand my dance!" said he.</p>

  <p>"No, not the first, Oliver," she answered.</p>

  <p>Coppinger's brows knit.</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh! do you not know? Mr. Menaida's son, Mr. Oliver."</p>

  <p>The two men's eyes met, their irises contracted.</p>

  <p>"I think we have met before," said Oliver.</p>

  <p>"That is possible," answered Captain Cruel, contemptuously, looking in
  another direction.</p>

  <p>"When we met I knew you without your knowing me," pursued the young man,
  in a voice that shook with anger. He had recognized the tone of the voice
  that had spoken on the wreck.</p>

  <p>"Of that I, neither, have any doubt as to its possibility. I do not
  recollect every Jack I encounter."</p>

  <p>A moment after an idea struck him, and he turned his head sharply, fixed
  his eyes on young Menaida, and said, "Where did we meet?"</p>

  <p>"'Encounter' was your word."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;encounter!"</p>

  <p>"On Doom Bar."</p>

  <p>Coppinger's color changed. A sinister flicker came into his sombre
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Then," said he slowly, in low vibrating tones, "we shall meet again."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, we shall meet again, and conclude our&mdash;I use your
  term&mdash;'encounter.'"</p>

  <p>Judith did not hear the conversation. She had been pounced upon by Mr.
  Desiderius Mules.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;positively I must walk through a quadrille with you," said the
  rector. "This is all my affair; it all springs from me, I arranged
  everything. I beat up patrons and patronesses. I stirred up the neighborhood.
  It all turns as a wheel about me as the axle. Come along, the band is
  beginning to play. You shall positively walk through a quadrille with me."
  Mr. Mules was not the man to be put on one side, not one to accept a refusal;
  he carried off the bride to the head of the room and set her in one
  square.</p>

  <p>"Look at the decorations," said Mr. Mules, "I designed them. I hope you
  will like the supper. I drew up the <i>menu</i>. I chose the wines, and I
  know they are good. The candles I got at wholesale price&mdash;because for a
  charity. What beautiful diamonds you are wearing. They are not paste, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I believe not."</p>

  <p>"Yet good old paste is just as iridescent as real diamonds. Where did you
  get them? Are they family jewels? I have heard that the Trevisas were great
  people at one time. Well, so were the Mules. We are really De Moels. We came
  in with the Conqueror. That is why I have such a remarkable Christian name.
  Desiderius is the French Dsir, and a Norman Christian name. Look at the
  wreaths of laurel and holly. How do you like them?"</p>

  <p>"The decorations are charming."</p>

  <p>"I am so pleased that you have come," pursued Mr. Mules. "It is your first
  appearance in public as Mrs. Captain Coppinger. I have been horribly
  uncomfortable about&mdash;you remember what. I have been afraid I had put my
  foot into it, and might get into hot water. But now you have come here, it is
  all right; it shows me that you are coming round to a sensible view, and that
  to-morrow you will be at the rectory and sign the register. If inconvenient,
  I will run up with it under my arm to the Glaze. At what time am I likely to
  catch you both in? The witnesses, Miss Trevisa and Mr. Menaida, one can
  always get at. Perhaps you will speak to your aunt and see that she is on the
  spot, and I'll take the old fellow on my way home."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mules, we will not talk of that now."</p>

  <p>"Come! you must see, and be introduced to, Lady Molesworth."</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile Lady Knighton was telling her story to a party round
  her.</p>

  <p>"I was returning with my two children from India; it is now some years
  ago. It is so sad, in the case of Indians, either the parents must part from
  their children, or the mother must take her children to England and be parted
  from her husband. I brought my little ones back to be with my husband's
  sister, who kindly undertook to see to them. We encountered a terrible gale
  as we approached this coast; do you recollect the loss of the Andromeda?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," answered Sir William Molesworth; "were you in that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to my cost. One of my darlings so suffered from the exposure that
  she died. But, really, I do not think it was the wreck of the vessel which
  was worst. It was not that, not that alone, which brought this nervous tremor
  on me."</p>

  <p>"I remember that case," said Sir William. "It was a very bad one, and
  disgraceful to our county. We have recently had an ugly story of a wreck on
  Doom Bar, with suspicion of evil practices; but nothing could be proved,
  nothing brought home to anyone. In the case of the Andromeda there was
  something of the same sort."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, there were evil practices. I was robbed."</p>

  <p>"You! surely, Lady Knighton, it was not of you that the story was
  told?"</p>

  <p>"If you mean the story of the diamonds, it was," answered the Indian lady.
  "We had to leave the wreck, and carry all our portable valuables with us. I
  had a set of jewellery of Indian work, given me by Sir James&mdash;well, he
  was only plain Mr. Knighton then. It was rather quaint in design: there was a
  brooch representing a butterfly, and two emeralds formed
  the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Excuse me one moment, Lady Knighton," said Sir William. "Here comes the
  new rector of St. Enodoc, with the bride, to introduce her to my wife. I am
  ashamed to say we have not made her acquaintance before."</p>

  <p>"Bride! what&mdash;his bride?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no; the bride of a certain Captain Coppinger, who lives near
  here."</p>

  <p>"She is pretty, very pretty; but how delicate!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Lady Knighton sprang to her feet, with an exclamation so shrill
  and startling that the dancers ceased, and the conductor of the band,
  thinking an accident had occurred, with his baton stopped the music. All
  attention was drawn to Lady Knighton, who, erect, trembling from head to
  foot, stood pointing with shaking finger to Judith.</p>

  <p>"See! see! My jewels, that were torn from me! Look!" She lifted the hair,
  worn low over her cheeks, and displayed one ear; the lobe was torn away.</p>

  <p>No one stirred in the ball-room; no one spoke. The fiddler stood with bow
  suspended over the strings, the flutist with fingers on all stops. Every eye
  was fixed on Judith. It was still in that room as though a ghost had passed
  through in winding-sheet. In this hush, Lady Knighton approached Judith,
  pointing still with trembling hand.</p>

  <p>"I demand, whence comes that brooch? Where&mdash;from whom did you get
  those earrings? They are mine; given me in India by my husband. They are
  Indian work, and not to be mistaken. They were plucked from me one awful
  night of wreck by a monster in human form, who came to our vessel, as we
  sought to leave it, and robbed us of our treasures. Answer me&mdash;who gave
  you those jewels?"</p>

  <p>Judith was speechless. The lights in the room died to feeble stars. The
  floor rolled like a sea under her feet; the ceiling was coming down on
  her.</p>

  <p>She heard whispers, murmurs&mdash;a humming as of a swarm of bees
  approaching ready to settle on her and sting her. She looked round her. Every
  one had withdrawn from her. Mr. Desiderius Mules had released her arm, and
  stood back. She tried to speak, but could not. Should she make the confession
  which would incriminate her husband?</p>

  <p>Then she heard a man's deep voice, heard a step on the floor. In a moment
  an arm was round her, sustaining her, as she tottered.</p>

  <p>"I gave her the jewels. I, Curll Coppinger, of Pentyre. If you ask where I
  got them&mdash;I will tell you. I bought them of Willy Mann, the pedlar. I
  will give you any further information you require to-morrow. Make room; my
  wife is frightened."</p>

  <p>Then, holding her, looking haughtily, threateningly, from side to side,
  Coppinger helped Judith along&mdash;the whole length of the
  ball-room&mdash;between rows of astonished, open-eyed, mute dancers. Near the
  door was a knot of gentlemen. They sprang apart, and Coppinger conveyed
  Judith through the door, out of the light, down the stairs, into the open
  air.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch41"
     name="ch41"></a>XLI. &mdash; A DEAD-LOCK.</h2>

  <p class="first">The incident of the jewellery of Lady Knighton occasioned
  much talk. On the evening of the ball it occupied the whole conversation, as
  the sole topic on which tongues could run and brains work. I say tongues run
  and brains work and not brains work and tongues run, for the former is the
  natural order in chatter. It was a subject that was thrashed by a hundred
  tongues of the dancers. Then it was turned over and rethrashed. Then it was
  winnowed. The chaff of the tale was blown into the kitchens and servants'
  halls, it drifted into tap-rooms, where the coachmen and grooms congregated
  and drank; and there it was rethrashed and rewinnowed.</p>

  <p>On the day following the ball, the jewels were returned to Lady Knighton,
  with a courteous letter from Captain Coppinger, to say that he had obtained
  them through the well-known Willy Mann, a pedlar who did commissions for the
  neighborhood, who travelled from Exeter along the south coast of Devon and
  Cornwall, and returned along the north coast of both counties.</p>

  <p>Everyone had made use of this fellow to do commissions, and trustworthy he
  had always proved. That was not a time when there was a parcels' post, and
  few could afford the time and the money to run at every requirement to the
  great cities, where were important shops when they required what could not be
  obtained in small country towns. He had been employed to match silks, to
  choose carpets, to bring medicines, to select jewellery, to convey
  love-letters.</p>

  <p>But Willy Mann had, unfortunately, died a month ago, having fallen off a
  wagon and broken his neck.</p>

  <p>Consequently it was not possible to follow up any further the traces of
  the diamond butterflies. Willy Mann, as was well known, had been a vehicle
  for conveying sundry valuables from ladies who had lost money at cards, and
  wanted to recoup by parting with bracelets and brooches. That he may have
  received stolen goods and valuables obtained from wrecks was also
  probable.</p>

  <p>So, after all the thrashing and winnowing, folks were no wiser than
  before, and no nearer the solution of the mystery. Some thought that
  Coppinger was guilty, others thought not, and others maintained a neutral
  position. Some again thought one thing one day and the opposite the next, and
  some always agreed with the last speaker's views. Whereas others again always
  took a contrary opinion to those who discussed the matter with them.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the matter went through a course much like a fever. It blazed
  out, was furious, then died away; languor ensued&mdash;and it gave symptoms
  of disappearing.</p>

  <p>The general mistrust against Coppinger was deepened, certainly, and the
  men who had wine and spirits and tobacco through him, resolved to have wine
  and spirits and tobacco from him, but nothing more. They would deal with him
  as a trader, and not acknowledge him as their social fellow. The ladies
  pitied Judith, they professed their respect for her; but as beds are made so
  must they be lain on, and as is cooked so must be eaten. She had married a
  man whom all mistrusted, and must suffer accordingly; one who is associated
  with an infected patient is certain to be shunned as much as the patient.
  Such is the way of the world, and we cannot alter it, as the making of that
  way has not been intrusted to us. On the day following the ball, Judith did
  not appear at Polzeath, nor again on the day after that.</p>

  <p>Oliver became restless. The cheerful humor, the merry mood that his father
  had professed were his, had deserted him. He could not endure the thought
  that one so innocent, so child-like as Judith, should have her fortunes
  linked to those of a man of whom he knew the worst. He could not, indeed,
  swear to his identity with the man on the wreck who had attempted to rob the
  passengers, and who had fought with him. He had no doubt whatever in his own
  mind that his adversary and assailant had been Coppinger, but he was led to
  this identification by nothing more tangible than the allusion made to
  Wyvill's death, and a certain tone of voice which he believed he recognized.
  The evidence was insufficient to convict him, of that Oliver was well aware.
  He was confident, moreover, that Coppinger was the man who had taken the
  jewels from Lady Knighton; but here again he was wholly unsupported by any
  sound basis of fact on which his conviction could maintain itself.</p>

  <p>Toward Coppinger he felt an implacable anger, and a keen desire for
  revenge. He would like to punish him for that assault on the wreck, but
  chiefly for the wrongs done to Judith. She had no champion, no protector. His
  father, as he acknowledged to himself, was a broken reed for one to lean on,
  a man of good intentions, but of a confused mind, of weakness of purpose, and
  lack of energy. The situation of Judith was a pitiful one, and if she was to
  be rescued from it, he must rescue her. But when he came to consider the way
  and means, he found himself beset with difficulties. She was married after a
  fashion. It was very questionable whether the marriage was legal, but,
  nevertheless, it was known through the county that a marriage had taken
  place, Judith had gone to Coppinger's house, and had appeared at the ball as
  his wife. If he established before the world that the marriage was invalid,
  what would she do? How would the world regard her? Was it possible for him to
  bring Coppinger to justice?</p>

  <p>Oliver went about instituting inquiries. He endeavored to trace to their
  source, the rumors that circulated relative to Coppinger, but always without
  finding anything on which he could lay hold. It was made plain to him that
  Captain Cruel was but the head of a great association of men, all involved in
  illegal practices; men engaged in smuggling, and ready to make their profit
  of a wreck, when a wreck fell in their way. They hung together like bees.
  Touch one, and the whole hive swarmed out. They screened one another, were
  ready to give testimony before magistrates that would exculpate whoever of
  the gang was accused. They evaded every attempt of the coast-guard to catch
  them; they laughed at the constables and magistrates. Information was passed
  from one to another with incredible rapidity; they had their spies and their
  agents along the coast. The magistrates and country gentry, though strongly
  reprobating wrecking, and bitterly opposed to poaching, were of broad and
  generous views regarding smuggling, and the preventive officer complained
  that he did not receive that support from the squirearchy which he expected
  and had a right to demand.</p>

  <p>There were caves along the whole coast, from Land's End to Hartland, and
  there were, unquestionably, stores of smuggled goods in a vast number of
  places, centres whence they were distributed. When a vessel engaged in the
  contraband trade appeared off the coast, and the guard were on the alert in
  one place, she ran a few miles up or down, signalled to shore, and landed her
  cargo before the coast-guard knew where she was. They were being constantly
  deceived by false information, and led away in one direction while the
  contraband goods were being conveyed ashore in an opposite quarter.</p>

  <p>Oliver learned much concerning this during the ensuing few days. He made
  acquaintance with the officer in command of the nearest station, and resolved
  to keep a close watch on Coppinger, and to do his utmost to effect his
  arrest. When Captain Cruel was got out of the way, then something could be
  done for Judith. An opportunity came in Oliver's way of learning tidings of
  importance, and that when he least expected it. As already said, he was wont
  to go about on the cliffs with Jamie, and after Judith ceased to appear at
  Mr. Menaida's cottage, in his unrest he took Jamie much with him, out of
  consideration for Judith, who, as he was well aware, would be content to have
  her brother with him, and kept thereby out of mischief.</p>

  <p>On one of these occasions he found the boy lag behind, become uneasy, and
  at last refuse to go farther. He inquired the reason, and Jamie, in evident
  alarm, replied that he dare not&mdash;he had been forbidden.</p>

  <p>"By whom?"</p>

  <p>"He said he would throw me over, as he did my doggie, if I came here
  again."</p>

  <p>"Who did?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>Jamie was frightened, and looked round.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't say," he answered, in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Must not say what, Jamie?"</p>

  <p>"I was to let no one know about it."</p>

  <p>"About what?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid to say. He would throw me over. I found it out and showed it
  to Ju. I have never been down there since."</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger found you somewhere, and forbade your ever going to
  that place again?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," in a faltering voice.</p>

  <p>"And threatened to fling you over the cliffs if you did!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," again timidly.</p>

  <p>Oliver said quietly, "Now run home and leave me here."</p>

  <p>"I daren't go by myself. I did not mean to come here."</p>

  <p>"Very well. No one has seen you. Let me see, this wall marks the spot. I
  will go back with you."</p>

  <p>Oliver was unusually silent as he walked to Polzeath with Jamie. He was
  unwilling further to press the boy. He would probably confuse him, by
  throwing him into a paroxysm of alarm. He had gained sufficient information
  for his purpose from the few words he let drop. "I have never been down there
  since," Jamie had said. There was, then, something that Coppinger desired
  should not be generally known concealed between the point on the cliff where
  the "new-take" wall ended and the beach immediately beneath.</p>

  <p>He took Jamie to his father, and got the old man to give him some setting
  up of birds to amuse and occupy him, and then returned to the cliff. It did
  not take him long to discover the entrance to the cave beneath, behind the
  curtain of slate reef, and as he penetrated this to the farthest point, he
  was placed in possession of one of the secrets of Coppinger and his band.</p>

  <p>He did not tarry there, but returned home another way, musing over what he
  had learned, and considering what advantage he was to take of it. A very
  little thought satisfied him that his wisest course was to say nothing about
  what he had learned, and to await the turns of fortune, and the
  incautiousness of the smugglers.</p>

  <p>From this time, moreover, he discontinued his visits to the coast-guard
  station, which was on the farther side of the estuary of the Camel, and which
  could not well be crossed without attracting attention. There was no trusting
  anyone, Oliver felt&mdash;the boatman who put him across was very possibly in
  league with the smugglers, and was a spy on those who were in communication
  with the officers of the revenue.</p>

  <p>Another reason for his cessation of visits was that, on his return to his
  father's house, after having explored the cave, and the track in the face of
  the cliff leading to it, he heard that Jamie had been taken away by
  Coppinger. The Captain had been there during his absence, and had told Mr.
  Menaida that Judith was distressed at being separated from her brother, and
  that, as there were reasons which made him desire that she should forego her
  walks to Polzeath, he, Captain Coppinger, deemed it advisable to bring Jamie
  back to Pentyre.</p>

  <p>Oliver asked himself, when he heard this, with some unease, whether this
  was due to his having been observed with the boy on the downs near the place
  from which access to the cave was had. Also, whether the boy would be
  frightened at the appearance of Captain Cruel so soon after he had approached
  the forbidden spot, and, in his fear, reveal that he had been there with
  Oliver and had partially betrayed the secret.</p>

  <p>There was another question he was also constrained to ask himself, and it
  was one that made the color flash into his cheek. What was the particular
  reason why Captain Coppinger objected to the visits of his wife to Polzeath
  at that time? Was he jealous? He recalled the flare in his eyes at the ball,
  when Judith turned to him, held out her hand, and called him by his Christian
  name.</p>

  <p>From this time all communication with Pentyre Glaze was cut off; tidings
  relative to Judith and Jamie were not to be had. Judith was not seen, Aunt
  Dionysia rarely, and from her nothing was to be learned. It would hardly
  comport with discretion for inquiries to be made by Oliver of the servants of
  the Glaze; but his father, moved by Oliver and by his own anxiety, did
  venture to go to the house and ask after Judith. He was coldly received by
  Miss Trevisa, who took the opportunity to insult him by asking if he had come
  to have his bill settled&mdash;there being a small account in his favor for
  Jamie. She paid him, and sent the old fellow fuming, stamping, even swearing,
  home, and as ignorant of the condition of Judith as when he went. He had not
  seen Judith, nor had he met Captain Coppinger. He had caught a glimpse of
  Jamie in the yard with his donkey, but the moment the boy saw him he dived
  into the stable, and did not emerge from it till Uncle Zachie was gone.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Menaida, still urged by his son and by his own feelings,
  incapable of action unless goaded by these double spurs, went to the rectory
  to ask Mr. Mules if he had seen Judith, and whether anything had been done
  about the signatures in the register.</p>

  <p>Mr. Desiderius was communicative.</p>

  <p>He had been to Pentyre about the matter. He was, as he said, "in a stew
  over it" himself. It was most awkward; he had filled in as much as he could
  of the register, and all that lacked were the signatures&mdash;he might say
  all but that of the bride and Mr. Menaida, for there had been a scene. Mrs.
  Coppinger had come down, and, in the presence of the Captain and her aunt, he
  had expostulated with her, had pointed out to her the awkward position in
  which it placed himself, the scruple he felt at retaining the fee, when the
  work was only half done; how, that by appearing at the ball, she had shown to
  the whole neighborhood that she was the wife of Captain Coppinger, and that,
  having done this, she might as well append her name to the entry in the
  register. Then Captain Coppinger and Miss Trevisa had made the requisite
  entries, but Judith had again calmly, but resolutely, refused.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mules admitted there had been a scene. Mr. Coppinger became angry, and
  used somewhat violent words. But nothing that he himself could say, no
  representations made by her aunt, no urgency on the part of her husband could
  move the resolution of Judith, "which was a bit of arrant tomfoolery," said
  Mr. Desiderius, "and I told her so. Even that&mdash;the knowledge that she
  went down a peg in my estimation&mdash;even that did not move her."</p>

  <p>"And how was she?" asked Mr. Menaida.</p>

  <p>"Obstinate," answered the rector, "obstinate as a&mdash;I mean as a
  donkey, that is the position of affairs. We are at a dead-lock."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch42"
     name="ch42"></a>XLII. &mdash; TWO LETTERS.</h2>

  <p class="first">Oliver Menaida was summoned to Bristol by the heads of the
  firm which he served, and he was there detained for ten days.</p>

  <p>Whilst he was away, Uncle Zachie felt his solitude greatly. Had he had
  even Jamie with him he might have been content, but to be left completely
  alone was a trial to him, especially since he had become accustomed to having
  the young Trevisa in his house. He missed his music. Judith's playing had
  been to him an inexpressibly great delight. The old man for many years had
  gone on strumming and fumbling at music by great masters, incapable of
  executing it, and unwilling to hear it performed by incompetent
  instrumentalists. At length Judith had seated herself at his piano, and had
  brought into life all that wondrous world of melody and harmony which he had
  guessed at, believed in, yearned for, but never reached. And now that he was
  left without her to play to him, he felt like one deprived of a necessary of
  life.</p>

  <p>But his unrest did not spring solely from a selfish motive. He was not at
  ease in his mind about her. Why did he not see her anymore? Why was she
  confined to Pentyre! Was she ill? Was she restrained there against her will
  from visiting her old friends? Mr. Menaida was very unhappy because of
  Judith. He knew that she was resolved never to acknowledge Coppinger as her
  real husband; she did not love him, she shrank from him. And knowing what he
  did&mdash;the story of the invasion of the wreck, the fight with
  Oliver&mdash;he felt that there was no brutality, no crime which Coppinger
  was not capable of committing, and he trembled for the happiness of the poor
  little creature who was in his hands. Weak and irresolute though Mr. Menaida
  was, he was peppery and impulsive when irritated, and his temper had been
  roused by the manner of his reception at the Glaze, when he went there to
  inquire after Judith.</p>

  <p>Whilst engaged on his birds, his hand shook, so that he could not shape
  them aright. When he smoked his pipe, he pulled it from between his lips
  every moment to growl out some remark. When he sipped his grog, he could not
  enjoy it. He had a tender heart, and he had become warmly attached to Judith.
  He firmly believed in identification of the ruffian with whom Oliver had
  fought on the deck, and it was horrible to think that the poor child was at
  his mercy; and that she had no one to counsel and to help her.</p>

  <p>At length he could endure the suspense no longer. One evening, after he
  had drank a good many glasses of rum and water, he jumped up, put on his hat,
  and went off to Pentyre, determined to insist on seeing Judith.</p>

  <p>As he approached the house he saw that the hall windows were lighted up.
  He knew which was Judith's room, from what she had told him of its position.
  There was a light in that window also. Uncle Zachie, flushed with anger
  against Coppinger, and with the spirits he had drank, anxious about Judith,
  and resenting the way in which he had been treated, went boldly up to the
  front door and knocked. A maid answered his knock, and he asked to see Mrs.
  Coppinger. The woman hesitated, and bade him be seated in the porch. She
  would go and see.</p>

  <p>Presently Miss Trevisa came, and shut the door behind her, as she emerged
  into the porch.</p>

  <p>"I should like to see Mrs. Coppinger," said the old man.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry&mdash;you cannot," answered Miss Trevisa.</p>

  <p>"But why not?"</p>

  <p>"This is not a fit hour at which to call."</p>

  <p>"May I see her if I come at any other hour?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say."</p>

  <p>"Why may I not see her?"</p>

  <p>"She is unwell."</p>

  <p>"If she is unwell, then I am very certain she would be glad to see Uncle
  Zachie."</p>

  <p>"Of that I am no judge, but you cannot be admitted now."</p>

  <p>"Name the day, the hour, when I may."</p>

  <p>"That I am not at liberty to do."</p>

  <p>"What ails her? Where is Jamie?"</p>

  <p>"Jamie is here&mdash;in good hands."</p>

  <p>"And Judith."</p>

  <p>"She is in good hands."</p>

  <p>"In good hands!" exclaimed Mr. Menaida, "I should like to see the good,
  clean hands worn by anyone in this house, except my dear, innocent little
  Judith. I must and will see her. I must know from her own lips how she is. I
  must see that she is happy&mdash;or at least not maltreated."</p>

  <p>"Your words are an insult to me, her aunt, and to Captain Coppinger, her
  husband," said Miss Trevisa, haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Let me have a word with Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"He is not at home."</p>

  <p>"Not at home!&mdash;I hear a great deal of noise. There must be a number
  of guests in the hall. Who is entertaining them, you or Judith!"</p>

  <p>"That is no concern of yours, Mr. Menaida."</p>

  <p>"I do not believe that Captain Coppinger is not at home. I insist on
  seeing him."</p>

  <p>"Were you to see him&mdash;you would regret it afterwards. He is not a
  person to receive impertinences and pass them over. You have already behaved
  in a most indecent manner, in encouraging my niece to visit your house, and
  sit, and talk, and walk with, and call by his Christian name, that young
  fellow, your son."</p>

  <p>"Oliver!" Mr. Menaida was staggered. It had never occurred to his fuddled,
  yet simple mind, that the intimacy that had sprung up between the young
  people was capable of misinterpretation. The sense that he had laid himself
  open to this charge made him very angry, not with himself, but with Coppinger
  and with Miss Trevisa.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what," said the old man, "if you will not let me in I
  suppose you will not object to my writing a line to Judith?"</p>

  <p>"I have received orders to allow of no communication of any kind
  whatsoever between my niece and you or your house."</p>

  <p>"You have received orders&mdash;from Coppinger?" the old man flamed with
  anger. "Wait a bit! There is no command issued that you are not to take a
  message from me to your master?"</p>

  <p>He put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a note-book, and tore out of
  it a page. Then, by the light from the hall window, he scribbled on it a few
  lines in pencil.</p>

  <p>"Sir!&mdash;You are a scoundrel. You bully your wife. You rob, and attempt
  to murder those who are shipwrecked.&mdash;Zachary Menaida."</p>

  <p>"There," said the old man, "that will draw him, and I shall see him, and
  have it out with him."</p>

  <p>He had wafers in his pocket-book. He wetted and sealed the note. Then he
  considered that he had not said enough, so he opened the page again, and
  added: "I shall tell all the world what I know about you." Then he fastened
  the note again, and directed it. But as it suddenly occurred to him that
  Captain Coppinger might refuse to open the letter, he added on the outside,
  "The contents I know by heart, and shall proclaim them on the house-tops." He
  thrust the note into Miss Trevisa's hand, and turned his back on the house,
  and walked home snorting and muttering. On reaching Polzeath, however, he had
  cooled, and thought that possibly he had done a very foolish thing, and that
  most certainly he had in no way helped himself to what he desired, to see
  Judith again. Moreover, with a qualm, he became aware that Oliver, on his
  return from Bristol, would in all probability greatly disapprove of this
  fiery outburst of temper. To what would it lead? <i>Could</i> he fight
  Captain Coppinger? If it came to that, he was ready. With all his faults Mr.
  Menaida was no coward.</p>

  <p>On entering his house he found Oliver there, just arrived from Camelford.
  He at once told him what he had done. Oliver did not reproach him; he merely
  said, "A declaration of war, father! and a declaration before we are quite
  prepared."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I suppose so. I could not help myself. I was so incensed."</p>

  <p>"The thing we have to consider," said Oliver, "is what Judith wishes, and
  how it is to be carried out. Some communication must be opened with her. If
  she desires to leave the house of that fellow, we must get her away. If,
  however, she elects to remain, our hands are tied: we can do nothing."</p>

  <p>"It is very unfortunate that Jamie is no longer here; we could have sent
  her a letter through him."</p>

  <p>"He has been removed to prevent anything of the sort taking place."</p>

  <p>Then Oliver started up. "I will go and reconnoitre, myself."</p>

  <p>"No," said the father. "Leave all to me. You must on no account meddle in
  this matter."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because"&mdash;the old man coughed. "Do you not understand&mdash;you are
  a young man."</p>

  <p>Oliver colored, and said no more. He had not great confidence in his
  father's being able to do anything effectual for Judith. The step he had
  recently taken was injudicious and dangerous, and could further the end in
  view in no way.</p>

  <p>He said no more to old Mr. Menaida, but he resolved to act himself, in
  spite of the remonstrance made and the objection raised by his father. No
  sooner was the elder man gone to bed, than he sallied forth and took the
  direction of Pentyre. It was a moonlight night. Clouds indeed rolled over the
  sky, and for awhile obscured the moon, but a moment after it flared forth
  again. A little snow had fallen and frosted the ground, making everything
  unburied by the white flakes to seem inky black. A cold wind whistled
  mournfully over the country. Oliver walked on, not feeling the cold, so
  glowing were his thoughts, and came within sight of the Glaze. His father had
  informed him that there were guests in the hall; but when he approached the
  house, he could see no lights from the windows. Indeed, the whole house was
  dark, as though everyone in it were asleep, or it were an uninhabited ruin.
  That most of the windows had shutters he was aware, and that these might be
  shut so as to exclude the chance of any ray issuing he also knew. He could
  not therefore conclude that all the household had retired for the night.</p>

  <p>The moon was near its full. It hung high aloft in an almost cloudless sky.
  The air was comparatively still&mdash;still it never is on that coast, nor is
  it ever unthrilled by sound. Now, above the throb of the ocean, could be
  heard the shrill clatter and cry of the gulls. They were not asleep; they
  were about, fishing or quarrelling in the silver light.</p>

  <p>Oliver rather wondered at the house being so hushed&mdash;wondered that
  the guests were all dismissed. He knew in which wing of the mansion was
  Judith's room, and also which was Judith's window. The pure white light shone
  on the face of the house and glittered in the window-panes.</p>

  <p>As Oliver looked, thinking and wondering, he saw the casement opened, and
  Judith appeared at it, leaned with her elbow on the sill, and rested her face
  in her hand, looking up at the moon. The light air just lifted her fine hair.
  Oliver noticed how delicately pale and fragile she seemed&mdash;white as a
  gull, fragile as porcelain. He would not disturb her for a moment or two; he
  stood watching, with an oppression on his heart, and with a film forming over
  his eyes. Could nothing be done for the little creature? She was moped up in
  her room. She was imprisoned in this house, and she was wasting, dying in
  confinement.</p>

  <p>And now he stole noiselessly nearer. There was an old cattle-shed
  adjoining the house, that had lost its roof. Coppinger concerned himself
  little about agriculture, and the shed that had once housed cows had been
  suffered to fall to ruin, the slates had been blown off, then the rain had
  wetted and rotted the rafters, and finally the decayed rafters had fallen
  with their remaining load of slates, leaving the walls alone standing.</p>

  <p>Up one of the sides of this ruinous shed Oliver climbed, and then mounted
  to the gable, whence he could speak to Judith. But she must have heard him,
  and been alarmed, for she hastily closed the casement. Oliver, however, did
  not abandon his purpose. He broke off particles of mortar from the gable of
  the cow-house and threw them cautiously against the window. No notice was
  taken of the first or the second particle that clickered against a pane; but
  at the third a shadow appeared at the window, as though Judith had come to
  the casement to look out. Oliver was convinced that he could be seen; as he
  was on the very summit of the gable, and he raised his hands and arms to
  ensure attention.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the shadow was withdrawn. Then hastily he drew forth a scrap of
  paper, on which he had written a few words before he left his father's house,
  in the hopes of obtaining a chance of passing it to Judith, through Jamie, or
  by bribing a servant. This he now wrapped round a bit of stone and fastened
  it with a thread. Next moment the casement was opened and the shadow
  reappeared.</p>

  <p>"Back!" whispered Oliver, sufficiently loud to be heard, and he
  dexterously threw the stone and the letter through the open window.</p>

  <p>Next moment the casement was shut and the curtains were drawn.</p>

  <p>He waited for full a quarter of an hour but no answer was returned.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch43"
     name="ch43"></a>XLIII. &mdash; THE SECOND TIME.</h2>

  <p class="first">No sooner had Oliver thrown the stone with note tied round
  it into Judith's room through the window, than he descended from a position
  which he esteemed too conspicuous should anyone happen to be about in the
  night near the house. He ensconced himself beneath the cow-shed wall in the
  shadow, where concealed, but was ready should the casement open to step forth
  and show himself.</p>

  <p>He had not been there many minutes before he heard steps and voices, one
  of which he immediately recognized as that of Cruel Coppinger. Oliver had not
  been sufficiently long in the neighborhood to know the men in it by their
  voices, but looking round the corner of the wall he saw two figures against
  the horizon, one with hands in his pockets, and by the general slouch, he
  thought that he recognized the sexton of S. Enodoc.</p>

  <p>"The Black Prince will be in before long," said Coppinger. "I mean next
  week or fortnight, and I must have the goods shored here, this time. She will
  stand off Porth-leze, and mind you get information conveyed to the captain of
  the coast-guard that she will run her cargo there. Remember that. We must
  have a clear coast here. The stores are empty and must be refilled."</p>

  <p>"Yes, your honor."</p>

  <p>"You have furnished him with the key to the signals?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Cap'n."</p>

  <p>"And from Porth-leze there are to be signals to the Black Prince to come
  on here&mdash;but so that they may be read the other way&mdash;you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Cap'n."</p>

  <p>"And what do they give you every time you carry them a bit of
  information?"</p>

  <p>"A shilling."</p>

  <p>"A munificent government payment! and what did they give you for the false
  code of signals?"</p>

  <p>"Half a crown."</p>

  <p>"Then here is half a guinea&mdash;and a crown for every lie you impose on
  them."</p>

  <p>Then Coppinger and the sexton went further. As soon as Oliver thought he
  could escape unobserved he withdrew and returned to Polzeath.</p>

  <p>Next day he had a talk with his father.</p>

  <p>"I have had opinions, in Bristol," said he, "relative to the position of
  Judith."</p>

  <p>"From whom?"</p>

  <p>"From lawyers."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;and what did they say?"</p>

  <p>"One said one thing and one another. I stated the case of her marriage,
  its incompletion, the unsigned register, and one opinion was that
  nevertheless she was Mrs. Coppinger. But another opinion was that, in
  consequence of the incompleteness of the marriage, it was none&mdash;she was
  Miss Trevisa. Father, before I went to the barristers and obtained their
  opinions, I was as wise as I am now, for I knew then, what I know now, that
  she is either Mrs. Coppinger, or else that she is Miss Trevisa."</p>

  <p>"I could have told you as much."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me&mdash;but I may be uncharitable," said Oliver, grimly,
  "that the opinion given was this way or that way according as I showed myself
  interested for the legality or against the legality of the marriage. Both of
  those to whom I applied regarded the case as interesting and deserving of
  being thrashed out in a court of law, and gave their opinions so as to induce
  me to embark in a suit. You understand what I mean, father? When I seemed
  urgent that the marriage should be pronounced none at all, then the verdict
  of the consulting barrister was that it was no marriage at all, and very good
  reasons he was able to produce to show that. But when I let it be supposed
  that my object was to get this marriage established against certain parties
  keenly interested in disputing it, I got an opinion that it was a good and
  legal marriage, and very good reasons were produced to sustain this
  conclusion."</p>

  <p>"I could have told you as much&mdash;and this has cost you money?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;naturally."</p>

  <p>"And left you without any satisfaction?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"No satisfaction is to be got out of law&mdash;that is why I took to
  stuffing birds."</p>

  <p>"What is that noise at the door?" asked Oliver.</p>

  <p>"There is some one trying to come in, and fumbling at the hasp," said his
  father.</p>

  <p>Oliver went to the door and opened it&mdash;to find Jamie there,
  trembling, white, and apparently about to faint. He could not speak, but he
  held out a note to Oliver.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with you?" asked the young man.</p>

  <p>The boy, however, did not answer, but ran to Mr. Menaida, and crouched
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"He has been frightened," said the old man. "Leave him alone. He will come
  round presently and I will give him a drop of spirits to rouse him up. What
  letter is that?"</p>

  <p>Oliver looked at the little note given him. It had been sealed, but torn
  open afterward. It was addressed to him, and across the address was written
  in bold, coarse letters with a pencil, "Seen and passed. C. C." Oliver opened
  the letter and read as follows:</p>

  <p>"I pray you leave me. Do not trouble yourself about me. Nothing can now be
  done for me. My great concern is for Jamie. But I entreat you to be very
  cautious about yourself where you go. You are in danger. Your life is
  threatened, and you do not know it. I must not explain myself, but I warn
  you. Go out of the country&mdash;that would be best. Go back to Portugal. I
  shall not be at ease in my mind till I know that you are gone, and gone
  unhurt. My dear love to Mr. Menaida&mdash;Judith."</p>

  <p>The hand that had written this letter had shaken, the letters were hastily
  and imperfectly formed. Was this the hand of Judith who had taught Jamie
  caligraphy, had written out his copies as neatly and beautifully as
  copper-plate?</p>

  <p>Judith had sent him this answer by her brother, and Jamie had been
  stopped, forced to deliver up the missive, which Coppinger had opened and
  read. Oliver did not for a moment doubt <i>whence</i> the danger sprang with
  which he was menaced. Coppinger had suffered the warning to be conveyed to
  him with contemptuous indifference&mdash;it was as though he had scored
  across the letter&mdash;"Be forewarned, take what precautions you
  will&mdash;you shall not escape me."</p>

  <p>The first challenge had come from old Menaida, but Coppinger passed over
  that as undeserving of attention, but he proclaimed his readiness to cross
  swords with the young man. And Oliver could not deny that he had given
  occasion for this. Without counting the cost, without considering the risk;
  nay, further, without weighing the right and wrong in the matter, Oliver had
  allowed himself to slip into terms of some familiarity with Judith, harmless
  enough were she unmarried, but hardly calculated to be so regarded by a
  husband. They had come to consider each other as cousins, or they had
  pretended so to consider each other, so as to justify a half-affectionate,
  half-intimate association, and before he was aware of it Oliver had lost his
  heart. He could not and he would not regard Judith as the wife of Coppinger,
  because he knew that she absolutely refused to be so regarded by him, by
  herself, by his father, though by appearing at the ball with Coppinger, by
  living in his house, she allowed the world to so consider her. Was she his
  wife? He could not suppose it when she had refused to conclude the marriage
  ceremony, when there was no documentary evidence for the marriage. Let the
  question be mooted in a court of law; what could the witnesses say, but that
  she had fainted, and that all the latter portion of the ceremony had been
  performed over her when unconscious, and that on her recovery of her
  faculties she had resolutely persisted in resistance to the affixing of her
  signature to the register.</p>

  <p>With respect to Judith's feelings toward himself Oliver was ignorant. She
  had taken pleasure in his society, because he had made himself agreeable to
  her, and his company was a relief to her after the solitude of Pentyre and
  the association there with persons with whom she was wholly out of
  sympathy.</p>

  <p>His quarrel with Coppinger had shifted ground. At first he had resolved,
  should occasion offer, to conclude with him the contest begun on the wreck,
  and to chastise him for his conduct on that night. Now, he thought little of
  that cause of resentment, he desired to punish him for having been the
  occasion of so much misery to Judith. He could not now drive from his head
  the scene of the girl's wan face at the window, looking up at the moon.</p>

  <p>Oliver would shrink from doing anything dishonorable, but it did not seem
  to him that there could be aught wrong and unbecoming a gentleman in
  endeavoring to snatch this hapless child from the claws of the wild beast
  that had struck it down.</p>

  <p>"No, father," said he hastily, as the old fellow was pouring out a pretty
  strong dose of his great specific and about to administer it to Jamie, "no
  father, it is not that the boy wants; and remember how strongly Judith
  objects to his being given spirits."</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear!" exclaimed Uncle Zachie, "to be sure she does, and she made
  me promise not to give him any. But this is an exceptional case."</p>

  <p>"Let him come to me, I will soothe him. The child is frightened, or stay,
  get him to help you with that kittiwake. Jamie, father can't get the bird to
  look natural; his head does not seem to me to be right. Did you ever see a
  kittiwake turn his neck in that fashion? I wish you would put your fingers to
  the throat, and bend it about, and set the wadding where it ought to be.
  Father and I can't agree about it."</p>

  <p>"It is wrong," said Jamie. "Look, this is the way." His mind was diverted.
  Always volatile, always ready to be turned from one thing to another, Oliver
  had succeeded in interesting him, and had made him forget for a moment the
  terrors that had shaken him.</p>

  <p>After Jamie had been in the house for half an hour, Oliver advised him to
  return to the Glaze. He would give him no message, verbal or written. But the
  thought of having to return renewed the poor child's fears, and Oliver could
  hardly allay them by promising to accompany him part of the way.</p>

  <p>Oliver was careful not to speak to him on the subject of his alarm, but he
  gathered from his disjointed talk that Judith had given him the note and
  impressed on him that it was to be delivered as secretly as possible; that
  Coppinger had intercepted him, and suspecting something, had threatened and
  frightened him into divulging the truth. Then Captain Cruel had read the
  letter, scored over it some words in pencil, given it back to him, and
  ordered him to fulfil his commission, to deliver the note.</p>

  <p>"Look you here, Jamie," was Mr. Menaida's parting injunction to the lad as
  he left the house, "there's no reason for you to be idle when at Pentyre. You
  can make friends with some of the men and get birds shot. I don't advise your
  having a gun, you are not careful enough. But if they shoot birds you may
  amuse your leisure in skinning them, and I gave Judith arsenic for you. She
  keeps it in her workbox, and will let you have sufficient for your purpose as
  you need it. I would not give it to you, as it might be dangerous in your
  hands as a gun. It is a deadly poison, and with carelessness you might kill a
  man. But go to Judith when you have a skin ready to dress and she will see
  that you have sufficient for the dressing. There, good-by, and bring me some
  skins shortly."</p>

  <p>Oliver accompanied the boy as far as the gate that led into the lane
  between the walls enclosing the fields of the Pentyre estate. Jamie pressed
  him to come farther, but this the young man would not do. He bade the poor
  lad farewell, bid him divert himself as his father had advised, with bird
  stuffing, and remained at the gate watching him depart. The boy's face and
  feebleness touched and stirred the heart of Oliver. The face reminded him so
  strongly of his twin sister, but it was the shadow, the pale shadow of Judith
  only, without the intelligence, the character, and the force. And the
  helplessness of the child, his desolation, his condition of nervous alarm
  roused the young man's pity. He was startled by a shot, that struck his gray
  hat simultaneously with the report.</p>

  <p>In a moment he sprang over the hedge in the direction whence the smoke
  rose, and came upon Cruel Coppinger with a gun.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you!" said the latter, with a sneer, "I thought I was shooting a
  rabbit."</p>

  <p>"This is the second time," said Oliver.</p>

  <p>"The first," was Coppinger's correction.</p>

  <p>"Not so&mdash;the second time you have levelled at me. The first was on
  the wreck when I struck up your hand."</p>

  <p>Coppinger shrugged his shoulders. "It is immaterial. The third time is
  lucky, folks say."</p>

  <p>The two men looked at each other with hostility.</p>

  <p>"Your father has insulted me," said Coppinger. "Are you ready to take up
  his cause? I will not fight an old fool."</p>

  <p>"I am ready to take up his cause, mine also, and that of&mdash;&mdash;"
  Oliver checked himself.</p>

  <p>"And that of whom?" asked Coppinger, white with rage, and in a quivering
  voice.</p>

  <p>"The cause of my father and mine own will suffice," said Oliver.</p>

  <p>"And when shall we meet?" asked Captain Cruel, leaning on his gun and
  glaring at his young antagonist over it.</p>

  <p>"When and where suits me," answered Oliver, coldly.</p>

  <p>"And when and where may that be?"</p>

  <p>"When and where!&mdash;when and where I can come suddenly on you as you
  came on me upon the wreck. With such as you&mdash;one does not observe the
  ordinary rules."</p>

  <p>"Very well," shouted Coppinger. "When and where suits you, and when and
  where suits me&mdash;that is, whenever we meet again&mdash;we meet
  finally."</p>

  <p>Then each turned and strode away.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch44"
     name="ch44"></a>XLIV. &mdash; THE WHIP FALLS.</h2>

  <p class="first">For many days Judith had been as a prisoner in the house, in
  her room. Some one had spoken to Coppinger and had roused his suspicions,
  excited his jealousy. He had forbidden her visits to Polzeath; and to prevent
  communication between her and the Menaidas, father and son, he had removed
  Jamie to Pentyre Glaze.</p>

  <p>Angry and jealous he was. Time had passed, and still he had not advanced a
  step, rather he had lost ground. Judith's hopes that he was not what he had
  been represented, were dashed. However plausible might be his story to
  account for the jewels, she did not believe it.</p>

  <p>Why was Judith not submissive? Coppinger could now only conclude that she
  had formed an attachment for Oliver Menaida&mdash;for that young man whom she
  singled out, greeted with a smile, and called by his Christian name. He had
  heard of how she had made daily visits to the house of his father, how Oliver
  had been seen attending her home, and his heart foamed with rage and
  jealousy.</p>

  <p>She had no desire to go anywhere, now that she was forbidden to go to
  Polzeath, and when she knew that she was watched. She would not descend to
  the hall and mix with the company often assembled there, and though she
  occasionally went there when Coppinger was alone, took her knitting and sat
  by the fire, and attempted to make conversation about ordinary matters, yet
  his temper, his outbursts of rancor, his impatience of every other topic save
  their relations to each other, and his hatred of the Menaidas, made it
  intolerable for her to be with him alone, and she desisted from seeking the
  hall. This incensed him, and he occasionally went up-stairs, sought her out
  and insisted on her coming down. She would obey, but some outbreak would
  speedily drive her from his presence again.</p>

  <p>Their relations were more strained than ever. His love for her had lost
  the complexion of love and had assumed that of jealousy. His tenderness and
  gentleness toward her had been fed by hope, and when hope died they vanished.
  Even that reverence for her innocence and the respect for her character that
  he had shown was dissipated by the stormy gusts of jealousy.</p>

  <p>Miss Trevisa was no more a help and stay to the poor girl than she had
  been previously. She was soured and embittered, for her ambition to be out of
  the house and in Othello Cottage had been frustrated. Coppinger would not let
  her go till he and his wife had come to more friendly terms. On her
  chimney-piece were two bunches of lavender, old lavender from the rectory
  garden of the preceding year. They had become so dry that the seeds fell out,
  and they no longer exhaled scent unless pressed.</p>

  <p>Judith stood at her chimney-piece pressing her finger on the dropped
  seeds, and picking them up by this means to throw them into the small fire
  that smouldered in the grate. At first she went on listlessly picking up a
  seed and casting it into the fire, actuated by her innate love of order,
  without much thought&mdash;rather without any thought&mdash;for her mind was
  engaged over the letter of Oliver and his visit the previous night outside.
  But after a while, while thus gathering the grains of lavender, she came to
  associate them with her trouble, and as she thought&mdash;"Is there any
  escape for me, any happiness in store?"&mdash;she picked up a seed and cast
  it into the fire. Then she asked: "Is there any other escape for me than to
  die&mdash;to die and be with dear papa again, now not in S. Enodoc Rectory
  garden, but in the garden of Paradise?" And again she picked up and cast away
  a grain. Then, as she touched her fingertip with her tongue and applied it to
  another lavender seed, she said: "Or must this go on&mdash;this nightmare of
  wretchedness, of persecution, of weariness to death without dying, for
  years?" And she cast away the seed shudderingly. "Or"&mdash;and again, now
  without touching her finger with her tongue, as though the last thought had
  contaminated it&mdash;"or will he finally break and subdue me, destroy me and
  Jamie, soul and body?" Shivering at the thought she hardly dare to touch a
  seed, but forced herself to do so, raised one, and hastily shook it from
  her.</p>

  <p>Thus she continued ringing the change, never formulating any scheme of
  happiness for herself&mdash;certainly, in her white, guileless mind, not in
  any way associating Oliver with happiness, save as one who might by some
  means effect her discharge from this bondage&mdash;but he was not linked, not
  woven up with any thought of the future.</p>

  <p>The wind clickered at the casement. She had a window toward the sea;
  another, opposite, toward the land. Hers was a transparent chamber, and her
  mind had been transparent. Only now, timidly, doubtfully, not knowing herself
  why, did she draw a blind down over her soul, as though there were something
  there that she would not have all the world see, and yet which was in itself
  innocent. Then a new fear woke up in her, lest she should go mad. Day after
  day, night after night, was spent in the same revolution of distressing
  thought, in the same bringing up and reconsidering of old difficulties,
  questions concerning Coppinger, questions concerning Jamie, questions
  concerning her own power of endurance and resistance. Was it possible that
  this could go on without driving her mad?</p>

  <p>"One thing I see," murmured she; "all steps are broken away under me on
  the stair, and one thing alone remains for me to cling to&mdash;one only
  thing&mdash;my understanding. That"&mdash;she put her hands to her
  head&mdash;"that is all I have left. My name is gone from me. My friends I am
  separated from. My brother may not be with me. My happiness is all gone. My
  health may break down, but to a clear understanding I must hold; if that
  fails me I am lost&mdash;lost indeed."</p>

  <p>"Lost indeed!" exclaimed Coppinger, entering abruptly. He had caught her
  last words. He came in in white rage, blinded and forgetful in his passion,
  and with his hat on. There was a day when he entered the boudoir with his
  head covered, and Judith, without a word, by the mere force of her character
  shining out of her clear eyes, had made him retreat and uncover. It was not
  so now. She was careless whether he wore the hat or not when he entered her
  room. "So!" said he, in a voice that foamed out of his mouth, "letters pass
  between you! Letters&mdash;I have read that you sent. I stayed your
  messenger."</p>

  <p>"Well," answered Judith, with such composure as she could muster. She had
  already passed through several stormy scenes with him, and knew that her only
  security lay in self-restraint. "There was naught in it that you might not
  read. What did I say? That my condition was fixed&mdash;that none could alter
  it; that is true. That my great care and sorrow of heart is for Jamie; that
  is true. That Oliver Menaida has been threatened; that also is true. I have
  heard you speak words against him of no good."</p>

  <p>"I will make good my words."</p>

  <p>"I wrote, and hoped to save him from a danger, and you from a crime."</p>

  <p>Coppinger laughed. "I have sent on the letter. Let him take what
  precautions he will. I will chastise him. No man ever crossed me yet but was
  brought to bite the dust."</p>

  <p>"He has not harmed you, Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"He! Can I endure that you should call him by his Christian name, while I
  am but Captain Coppinger? That you should seek him out, laugh, and talk, and
  flirt with him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Captain Coppinger!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," raged he, "always Captain Coppinger, or Captain Cruel, and he is
  dear Oliver! sweet Oliver!" He well-nigh suffocated in his fury.</p>

  <p>Judith drew herself up and folded her arms. She had in one hand a sprig of
  lavender from which she had been shaking the over-ripe grains. She turned
  deadly white.</p>

  <p>"Give me up his letter. Yours was an answer!"</p>

  <p>"I will give it to you," answered Judith, and she went to her workbox,
  raised the lid, then the little tray containing reels, and from beneath it
  extracted a crumpled scrap of paper. She handed it calmly, haughtily to
  Coppinger, then folded her arms again, one hand still holding the bunch of
  lavender.</p>

  <p>The letter was short. Coppinger's hand shook with passion so that he could
  hardly hold it with sufficient steadiness to read it. It ran as follows:</p>

  <p>"I must know your wishes, dear Judith. Do you intend to remain in that den
  of wreckers and cut-throats? or do you desire that your friends should bestir
  themselves to obtain your release? Tell us, in one word, what to do, or
  rather what are your wishes, and we will do what we can."</p>

  <p>"Well!" said Coppinger, looking up. "And your answer is to the
  point&mdash;you wish to stay."</p>

  <p>"I did not answer thus. I said&mdash;leave me."</p>

  <p>"And never intended that he should leave you," raged Coppinger. He came
  close up to her with his eyes glittering, his nostrils distended and snorting
  and his hands clinched.</p>

  <p>Judith loosened her arms, and with her right hand swept a space before her
  with the bunch of lavender. He should not approach her within arm's length;
  the lavender marked the limit beyond which he might not draw near.</p>

  <p>"Now, hear me!" said Coppinger. "I have been too indulgent. I have humored
  you as a spoilt child. Because you willed this or that, I have submitted. But
  the time for humoring is over. I can endure this suspense no longer. Either
  you are my wife or you are not. I will suffer no trifling over this any
  longer. You have as it were put your lips to mine, and then sharply drawn
  them away&mdash;and now offer them to another."</p>

  <p>"Silence!" exclaimed Judith. "You insult me."</p>

  <p>"You insult and outrage me!" said Coppinger, "when you run from your home
  to chatter with and walk with this Oliver, and never deign to speak to me.
  When he is your dear Oliver, and I am only Captain Coppinger; when you have
  smiles for him you have black looks for me. Is not that insulting, galling,
  stinging, maddening?"</p>

  <p>Judith was silent. Her throat swelled. There was some truth in what he
  said; but, in the sight of heaven, she was guiltless of ever having thought
  of wrong, of having supposed for a moment that what she had allowed herself
  had not been harmless.</p>

  <p>"You are silent," said Coppinger. "Now hearken! With this moment I turn
  over the page of humoring your fancies and yielding to your follies. I have
  never pressed you to sign that register&mdash;I have trusted to your good
  sense and good feeling. You cannot go back. Even if you desire it, you cannot
  undo what has been done. Mine you are, mine you shall be&mdash;mine wholly
  and always. Do you hear?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And agree?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>He was silent a moment, with clinched teeth and hands looking at her, with
  eyes that smote her, as though they were bullets.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he. "Your answer is no."</p>

  <p>"My answer is no, so help me God."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he, between his teeth. "Then we open a new chapter."</p>

  <p>"What chapter is that?"</p>

  <p>"It is that of compulsion. That of solicitation is closed."</p>

  <p>"You cannot, whilst I have my senses. What!" She saw that he had a great
  riding-whip in his hand. "What&mdash;the old story again! You will strike
  me?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not you. I will lash you into submission&mdash;through
  Jamie."</p>

  <p>She uttered a cry, dropped the lavender, that became scattered before her,
  and held up her hands in mute entreaty.</p>

  <p>"I owe him chastisement. I have owed it him for many a day&mdash;and
  to-day above all&mdash;as a go-between."</p>

  <p>Judith could not speak. She remained as one frozen&mdash;in one attitude,
  in one spot, speechless. She could not stir, she could not utter a word of
  entreaty, as Coppinger left the room.</p>

  <p>In another minute a loud and shrill cry reached her ears from the court
  into which one of her windows looked. She knew the cry. It was that of her
  twin brother, and it thrilled through her heart, quivered in every nerve of
  her whole frame.</p>

  <p>She could hear what followed; but she could not stir. She was rooted by
  her feet to the floor, but she writhed there. It was as though every blow
  dealt the boy outside fell on her: she bent, she quivered, her lips parted,
  but cry she could not, the sweat rolled off her brow; she beat with her hands
  in the air. Now she thrilled up with uplifted arms, on tip-toe, then
  sank&mdash;it was like a flame flickering in a socket before it expires: it
  dances, it curls, it shoots up in a tongue, it sinks into a bead of light, it
  rolls on one side, it sways to the other, it leaps from the wick high into
  the air, and drops again. It was so with Judith&mdash;every stroke dealt,
  every scream of the tortured boy, every toss of his suffering frame, was
  repeated in her room, by her&mdash;in supreme, unspeaking anguish, too
  intense for sound to issue from her contracted throat.</p>

  <p>Then all was still, and Judith had sunk to her knees on the scattered
  lavender, extending her arms, clasping her hands, spreading them again, again
  beating her palms together, in a vague, unconscious way, as if in breathing
  she could not gain breath enough without this expansion and stretching forth
  of her arms.</p>

  <p>But, all at once, before her stood Coppinger, the whip in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Well! what now is your answer?"</p>

  <p>She breathed fast for some moments, laboring for expression. Then she
  reared herself up and tried to speak, but could not. Before her, threshed out
  on the floor, were the lavender seeds. They lay thick in a film over the
  boards in one place. She put her finger among them and drew No.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch45"
     name="ch45"></a>XLV. &mdash; GONE FROM ITS PLACE.</h2>

  <p class="first">There are persons, they are not many, on whom Luck smiles
  and showers gold. Not a steady daily downpour of money but, whenever a little
  cloud darkens their sky, that same little cloud, which to others would be
  mere gloom, opens and discharges on them a sprinkling of gold pieces.</p>

  <p>It is not always the case that those who have rich relatives come in for
  good things from them. In many cases there are such on whom Luck turns her
  back, but to those of whom we speak the rain of gold, and the snow of scrip
  and bonds come unexpectedly, but inevitably. Just as Pilatus catches every
  cloud that drifts over Switzerland, so do they by some fatality catch
  something out of every trouble, that tends materially to solace their
  feelings, lacerated by that trouble. But not so only. These little showers
  fall to them from relatives they have taken no trouble to keep on good terms
  with, from acquaintances whom they have cut, admirers whose good opinion they
  have not concerned themselves to cultivate, friends with whom they have
  quarrelled. Gideon's fleece, on one occasion, gathered to itself all the dew
  that fell, and left the grass of the field around quite dry. So do these
  fortunate persons concentrate on themselves, fortuitively it seems, the dew
  of richness that descends and might have, ought to have, dropped elsewhere;
  at all events, ought to have been more evenly and impartially distributed.
  Gideon's fleece, on another occasion was dry, when all the glebe was
  dripping. So is it with certain unfortunates, Luck never favors them. What
  they have expected and counted on they do not get, it is diverted, it drops
  round about them on every side, only on them it never falls.</p>

  <p>Now, Miss Trevisa cannot be said to have belonged to either of these
  classes. To the latter she had pertained till suddenly, from a quarter quite
  unregarded, there came down on her a very satisfactory little splash. Of
  relatives that were rich she had none, because she had no relatives at all.
  Of bosom friends she had none, for her bosom was of that unyielding nature,
  that no one would like to be taken to it. But, before the marriage of her
  brother, and before he became rector of S. Enodoc, when he was but a poor
  curate, she had been companion to a spinster lady, Miss Ceely, near S.
  Austell. Now the companion is supposed to be a person without an opinion of
  her own, always standing in a cringing position to receive the opinion of her
  mistress, then to turn it over and give it forth as her own. She is, if she
  be a proper companion, a mere echo of the sentiments of her employer.
  Moreover, she is expected to be amiable, never to resent a rude word, never
  to take umbrage at neglect, always to be ready to dance attendance on her
  mistress, and with enthusiasm of devotion, real or simulated, to carry out
  her most absurd wishes, unreasoningly. But Miss Trevisa had been, as a
  companion, all that a companion ought not to be. She had argued with Miss
  Ceely, invariably, had crossed her opinions, had grumbled at her when she
  asked that anything might be done, raised difficulties, piled up objections,
  blocked the way to whatever Miss Ceely particularly set the heart on having
  executed. The two ladies were always quarrelling, always calling each other
  names, and it was a marvel to the relatives of Miss Ceely that she and her
  companion hung together for longer than a month. Nevertheless they did. Miss
  Trevisa left the old lady when Mr. Peter Trevisa became rector of S. Enodoc,
  and then Miss Ceely obtained in her place quite an ideal companion, a very
  mirror&mdash;she had but to look on her face, smile, and a smile was
  repeated, weep, and tears came in the mirror. The new companion grovelled at
  her feet, licked the dust off her shoes, fawned on her hand, ran herself off
  her legs to serve her, grew gray under the misery of enduring Miss Ceely's
  jibes and sneers and insults, finally sacrificed her health in nursing her.
  When Miss Ceely's will was opened it was found that she had left
  nothing&mdash;not a farthing to this obsequious attendant, but had bequeathed
  fifteen hundred pounds, free of legacy duty, and all her furniture and her
  house to Miss Trevisa, with whom she had not kept up correspondence for
  twenty-three years. It really seemed as if leathery, rusty Aunt Dionysia,
  from being a dry Gideon's fleece, were about to be turned into a wet and
  wringable fleece. No one was more astounded than herself.</p>

  <p>It was now necessary that Miss Trevisa should go to S. Austell and see
  after what had come to her thus unsolicited and unexpectedly. All need for
  her to remain at Pentyre was at an end.</p>

  <p>Before she departed&mdash;not finally, but to see about the furniture that
  was now hers, and to make up her mind whether to keep or to sell it&mdash;she
  called Judith to her.</p>

  <p>That day, the events of which were given in last chapter, had produced a
  profound impression on Jamie. He had become gloomy, timid, and silent. His
  old idle chatter ceased. He clung to his sister, and accompanied her wherever
  she went; he could not endure to be with Coppinger. When he heard his voice,
  caught a glimpse of him, he ran away and hid. Jamie had been humored as a
  child, never beaten, scolded, put in a corner, sent to bed, cut off his
  pudding, but the rod had now been applied to his back and his first
  experience of corporal punishment was the cruel and vindictive hiding
  administered, not for any fault he had committed but because he had done his
  sister's bidding. He was filled with hatred of Coppinger, mingled with fear,
  and when alone with Judith would break out into exclamations of entreaty that
  she would run away with him, and of detestation of the man who held them
  there, as it were prisoners.</p>

  <p>"Ju," said he, "I wish he were dead. I hate him. Why doesn't God kill him
  and set us free!"</p>

  <p>At another time he said, "Ju, dear! You do not love him. I wish I were a
  big strong man like Oliver, and I would do what Captain Cruel did."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Cruel shot at Oliver."</p>

  <p>This was the first tidings Judith had heard of the attempt on Oliver's
  life.</p>

  <p>"He is a mean coward," said Jamie. "He hid behind a hedge and shot at him.
  But he did not hurt him."</p>

  <p>"God preserved him," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"Why does not God preserve us! Why did God let that
  beast&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush, Jamie!"</p>

  <p>"I will not&mdash;that wretch&mdash;beat me? Why did He not send lightning
  and strike him dead?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you, darling. We must wait and trust."</p>

  <p>"I am tired of waiting and trusting. If I had a gun I would not shoot
  birds, I would go behind a hedge and shoot Captain Coppinger. There would be
  nothing wrong in that, Ju?"</p>

  <p>"Yes there would. It would be a sin."</p>

  <p>"Not after he did that to Oliver."</p>

  <p>"I would never&mdash;never love you, if you did that."</p>

  <p>"You would always love me whatever I did," said Jamie. He spoke the truth,
  Judith knew it. Her eyes filled, she drew the boy to her passionately and
  kissed his golden head.</p>

  <p>Then came Aunt Dionysia and summoned her into her own room. Jamie
  followed.</p>

  <p>"Judith," began Aunt Dunes, in her usual hard tones, and with the same
  frozen face, "I wish you particularly to understand. Look here! You have
  caused me annoyance enough while I have been here. Now I shall have a house
  of my own at S. Austell, and if I choose to live in it I can. If I do not, I
  can let it, and live at Othello Cottage. I have not made up my mind what to
  do. Fifteen hundred pounds is a dirty little sum, and not half as much as
  ought to have been left me for all I had to bear from that old woman. I am
  glad for one thing that she has left me something, though not much. I should
  have despaired of her salvation had she not. However her heart was touched at
  the last, though not touched enough. Now what I want you to understand is
  this&mdash;it entirely depends on your conduct whether after my death this
  sum of fifteen hundred pounds and a beggarly sum of about five hundred I have
  of my own, comes to you or not. As long as this nonsense goes on between you
  and Captain Coppinger&mdash;you pretending you are not married, when you are,
  there is no security for me that you and Jamie may not come tumbling in upon
  me and become a burden to me. Captain Coppinger will not endure this fooling
  much longer. <i>He</i> can take advantage of your mistake. <i>He</i> can
  say&mdash;I am not married. Where is the evidence? Produce proof of the
  marriage having been solemnized&mdash;and then he may send you out of his
  house upon the downs in the cold. What would you be then, eh? All the world
  holds you to be Mrs. Coppinger. A nice state of affairs, if it wakes up one
  morning to hear that Mrs. Coppinger has been kicked out of the Glaze, that
  she never was the wife. What will the world say, eh? What sort of name will
  the world give you, when you have lived here as his wife."</p>

  <p>"That I have not."</p>

  <p>"Lived here, gone to balls as his wife when you were not. What will the
  world call you, eh?"</p>

  <p>Judith was silent, holding both her hands, open against her bosom. Jamie
  beside her, looking up in her face, not understanding what his aunt was
  saying.</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;or rather very ill!" continued Miss Trevisa. "And then
  you and this boy here will come to me to take you in, come and saddle
  yourselves on me, and eat up my little fund. That is what will be the end of
  it, if you remain in your folly. Go at once to the rector, and put your name
  where it should have been two months ago, and your position is secure, he
  cannot drive you away, disgusted at your stubbornness, and you will relieve
  me of a constant source of uneasiness. It is not that only, but I must care
  for the good name of Trevisa, which you happen to bear, that that name may
  not be trailed in the dust. The common sense of the matter is precisely what
  you cannot see. If you are not Coppinger's wife you should not be here. If
  you are Coppinger's wife, then your name should be in the register. Now here
  you have come. You have appeared in public with him. You have but one course
  open to you, and that is to secure your position and your name and honor. You
  cannot undo what is done, but you can complete what is done insufficiently.
  The choice between alternatives is no longer before you. If you had purposed
  to withdraw from marriage, break off the engagement, then you should not have
  come on to Pentyre, and remained here. As, however, you did this, there is
  absolutely nothing else to be done, but to sign the register. Do you hear
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And you will obey?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Pig-headed fool," said Miss Trevisa. "Not one penny will I leave you.
  That I swear, if you remain obstinate."</p>

  <p>"Do not let us say anything more about that, aunt. Now you are going away,
  is there anything connected with the house you wish me to attend to? That I
  will do readily."</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are several things," growled Miss Trevisa, "and, first of all,
  are you disposed to do anything, any common little kindness for the man whose
  bread you eat, whose roof covers you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, aunt."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. Captain Coppinger has his bowl of porridge every
  morning. I suppose he was accustomed to it before he came into these parts,
  and he cannot breakfast without it. He says that our Cornish maids cannot
  make porridge properly, and I have been accustomed to see to it. Either it is
  lumpy, or it is watery, or it is saltless. Will you see to that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, aunt, willingly."</p>

  <p>"You ought to know how to make porridge, as you are more than half
  Scottish."</p>

  <p>"I certainly can make it. Dear papa always liked it."</p>

  <p>"Then you will attend to that. If you are too high and too great a lady to
  put your hand to it yourself, you can see that the cook manages it aright.
  There is a new girl in now, who is a fool."</p>

  <p>"I will make it myself. I will do all I can do."</p>

  <p>"Then take the keys. Now that I go, you must be mistress of the house. But
  for your folly, I might have been from here, and in my own house, or rather
  in that given me for my use, Othello Cottage. I was to have gone there
  directly after your marriage, I had furnished it, and made it comfortable,
  and then you took to your fantastic notions, and hung back, and refused to
  allow that you were married, and so I had to stick on here two months. Here,
  take the keys." Miss Trevisa almost flung them at her niece. "Now I have two
  thousand pounds of my own, and a house at S. Austell, it does not become me
  to be doing menial service. Take the keys. I will never have them back."</p>

  <p>When Miss Trevisa was gone, and Judith was by herself at night, Jamie
  being asleep, she was able to think over calmly what her aunt had said. She
  concerned herself not the least, relative to the promise her aunt had made of
  leaving her two thousand pounds, were she submissive, and her threat of
  disinheriting her, should she continue recalcitrant, but she did feel that
  there was truth in her aunt's words when she said that she, Judith, had
  placed herself in a wrong position&mdash;but it was a wrong position into
  which she had been forced, she had not voluntarily entered it. She had,
  indeed, consented to become Coppinger's wife, but when she found that
  Coppinger had employed Jamie to give signals that might mislead a vessel to
  its ruin she could not go further to meet him. Although he had endeavored to
  clear himself in her eyes, she did not believe him. She was convinced that he
  was guilty, though at moments she hoped, and tried to persuade herself that
  he was not. Then came the matter of the diamonds. There, again, the gravest
  suspicion rested on him. Again he had endeavored to exculpate himself, yet
  she could not believe that he was innocent. Till full confidence that he was
  blameless in these matters was restored, an insuperable wall divided them.
  Never would she belong to a man who was a wrecker, who belonged to that class
  of criminals her father had regarded with the utmost horror.</p>

  <p>Before she retired to bed, she picked up from under the fender the scrap
  of paper on which Oliver's message had been written. It had lain there
  unobserved where Coppinger had flung it, now, as she tidied her room, and
  arranged the fire-rug, she observed it. She smoothed it out, folded it, and
  went to her workbox to replace it where it had been before.</p>

  <p>She raised the lid, and was about to put the note among some other papers
  she had there, a letter of her mother's, a piece of her father's writing,
  some little accounts she had kept, when she was startled to see that the
  packet of arsenic Mr. Menaida had given her was missing.</p>

  <p>She turned out the contents of her workbox. It was nowhere to be found,
  either there, or in her drawers. Her aunt must have been prying into the box,
  have found and removed it, so Judith thought, and with this thought appeased
  her alarm. Perhaps, considering the danger of having arsenic about, Aunt
  Dionysia had done right in removing it. She had done wrong in doing so
  without speaking to Judith.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch46"
     name="ch46"></a>XLVI. &mdash; A SECOND LIE.</h2>

  <p class="first">Next day, Miss Trevisa being gone, Judith had to attend to
  the work of the house. It was her manifest duty to do so. Hitherto she had
  shrunk from the responsibility, because she shrank from assuming a position
  in the house to which she refused to consider that she had a right. Judith
  was perfectly competent to manage an establishment, she had a clear head, a
  love of order, and a power of exacting obedience of servants without
  incessant reproof. Moreover, she had that faculty possessed by few of
  directing others in their work so that each moved along his or her own line
  and fulfilled the allotted work with ease. She had managed her father's
  house, and managed it admirably. She knew that, as the king's government must
  be carried on, so the routine of a household must be kept going. Judith had
  sufficient acquaintance also with servants to be aware that the wheel would
  stop or move spasmodically, unless an authoritative hand were applied to it
  to keep it in even revolution. She knew also that whatever happened in a
  house&mdash;a birth, a death, a wedding, an uproar&mdash;the round of common
  duties must be discharged, the meals prepared, the bread baked, the milk
  skimmed, the beds made, the carpets swept, the furniture dusted, the windows
  opened, the blinds drawn down, the table laid, the silver and glass
  burnished. Nothing save a fire which gutted a house must interfere with all
  this routine. Miss Trevisa was one of those ladies who, in their own opinion,
  are condemned by Providence never to have good servants. A benign Providence
  sheds good domestics into every other house, save that which she rules. She
  is born under a star which inexorably sends the scum and dregs of servantdom
  under her sceptre. Miss Trevisa regarded a servant as a cat regards a mouse,
  a dog regards a fox, and a dolphin a flying-fish, as something to be run
  after, snapped at, clawed, leaped upon, worried perpetually. She was
  incapable of believing that there could be any good in a servant, that there
  was any other side to a domestic save a seamy side. She could make no
  allowance for ignorance, for weakness, for lightheartedness. A servant in her
  eyes must be a drudge ever working, never speaking, smiling, taking a hand
  off the duster, without a mind above flue and tea-leaves, and unable to soar
  above a cobweb; with a temper perfect in endurance of daily, hourly
  fault-finding, nagging, grumbling, a mind unambitious also of commendation.
  Miss Trevisa held that every servant that a malign Providence had sent her
  was clumsy, insolent, slatternly, unmethodical, idle, wasteful, a gossip, a
  gadabout, a liar, a thief, was dainty, greedy, one of a cursed generation;
  and when in the Psalms, David launched out in denunciation of the enemies of
  the Lord, Miss Trevisa, when she heard or read these Psalms, thought of
  servantdom. Servants were referred to when David said, "Hide me from the
  insurrection of the wicked doers, who have whet their tongues like a sword,
  that they may privily shoot at him that is perfect," <i>i.e.</i>, me, was
  Miss Trevisa's comment. "They encourage themselves in mischief; and commune
  among themselves how they may lay snares, and say, that no man shall see
  them." "And how," said Miss Trevisa, "can men be so blind as not to believe
  that the Bible is inspired when David hits the character of servants off to
  the life!"</p>

  <p>And not the Psalms only, but the Prophets were full of servants'
  delinquencies. What were Tyre and Egypt but figures of servantdom shadowed
  before. What else did Isaiah lift up his testimony about, and Jeremiah lament
  over, but the iniquities of the kitchen and the servants' hall. Miss Trevisa
  read her Bible, and great comfort did it afford her, because it did denounce
  the servant maids so unsparingly and prepared brimstone and outer darkness
  for them.</p>

  <p>Now Judith had seen and heard much of the way in which Miss Trevisa
  managed Captain Coppinger's house. Her room adjoined that of her aunt, and
  she knew that if her aunt were engaged on&mdash;it mattered not what
  absorbing work, embroidery, darning a stocking, reading a novel, saying her
  prayers, studying the cookery book&mdash;if a servant sneezed within a
  hundred yards, or upset a drop of water, or clanked a dust-pan, or clicked a
  door-handle, Miss Trevisa would be distracted from her work and rush out of
  her room, just as a spider darts from its recess, and sweep down on the
  luckless servant to worry and abuse her.</p>

  <p>Judith, knowing this, knew also that the day of Miss Trevisa's departure
  would be marked with white chalk, and lead to a general relaxation of
  discipline, to an inhaling of long breaths, and a general stretching and
  taking of ease. It was necessary, therefore, that she should go round and see
  that the wheel was kept turning.</p>

  <p>To her surprise, on entering the hall, she found Captain Coppinger
  there.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," she said, "I thought you were out."</p>

  <p>She looked at him and was struck with his appearance, the clay-like color
  of his face, the dark lines in it, the faded look in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are you unwell?" she asked; "you really look ill."</p>

  <p>"I am ill."</p>

  <p>"Ill&mdash;what is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"A burning in my throat. Cramp and pains&mdash;but what is that to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"When did it come on?"</p>

  <p>"But recently."</p>

  <p>"Will you not have a doctor to see you?"</p>

  <p>"A doctor!&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>"Was the porridge as you liked it this morning? I made it."</p>

  <p>"It was good enough."</p>

  <p>"Would you like more now?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"And to-morrow morning, will you have the same?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;the same."</p>

  <p>"I will make it again. Aunt said the new cook did not understand how to
  mix and boil it to your liking."</p>

  <p>Coppinger nodded.</p>

  <p>Judith remained standing and observing him. Some faces when touched by
  pain and sickness are softened and sweetened. The hand of suffering passes
  over the countenance and brushes away all that is frivolous, sordid, vulgar;
  it gives dignity, purity, refinement, and shows what the inner soul might be
  were it not entangled and degraded by base association and pursuit. It is
  different with other faces, the hand of suffering films away the assumed
  expression of good nature, honesty, straightforwardness, and unmasks the evil
  inner man. The touch of pain had not improved the expression of Cruel
  Coppinger. It cannot, however, with justice be said that the gentler aspect
  of the man, which Judith had at one time seen, was an assumption. He was a
  man in whom there was a certain element of good, but it was mixed up with
  headlong wilfulness, utter selfishness, and resolution to have his own way at
  any cost.</p>

  <p>Judith could see, now that his face was pain-struck, how much of evil
  there was in the soul that had been disguised by a certain dash of masculine
  overbearing and brusqueness.</p>

  <p>"What are you looking at?" asked Coppinger, glancing up.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking," answered Judith.</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of you&mdash;of Wyvill, of the wreck on Doom Bar, of the jewels of Lady
  Knighton, and last of all of Jamie's maltreatment."</p>

  <p>"And what of all that?" he said in irritable scorn.</p>

  <p>"That I need not say. I have drawn my own conclusions."</p>

  <p>"You torment me, you&mdash;when I am ill? They call me Cruel, but it is
  you who are cruel."</p>

  <p>Judith did not wish to be drawn into discussion that must be fruitless.
  She said, quietly, in altered tone, "Can I get you anything to comfort
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;go your way. This will pass. Besides, it is naught to you. Go; I
  would be left alone."</p>

  <p>Judith obeyed, but she was uneasy. She had never seen Coppinger look as he
  looked now. It was other, altogether, after he had broken his arm. Other,
  also, when for a day he was crippled with bruises, after the wreck. She
  looked into the hall several times during the day. In the afternoon he was
  easier, and went out; his mouth had been parched and burning, and he had been
  drinking milk. The empty glass was on the table. He would eat nothing at
  mid-day. He turned from food, and left the room for his own chamber.</p>

  <p>Judith was anxious. She more than once endeavored to draw Coppinger into
  conversation relative to himself, but he would not speak of what affected
  him. He was annoyed and ashamed at being out of his usual rude health.</p>

  <p>"It is naught," he said, "but a bilious attack, and will pass. Leave me
  alone."</p>

  <p>She had been so busy all day, that she had seen little of Jamie. He had
  taken advantage of Captain Coppinger not being about, to give himself more
  license to roam than he had of late, and to go with his donkey on the cliffs.
  Anyhow Judith on this day did not have him hanging to her skirts. She was
  glad of it, for, though she loved him, he would have been an encumbrance when
  she was so busy.</p>

  <p>The last thing at night she did was to go to Coppinger to inquire what he
  would take. He desired nothing but spirits and milk. He thought that a
  milk-punch would give him ease and make him sleep. That he was weak and had
  suffered pain she saw, and she was full of pity for him. But this she did not
  like to exhibit, partly because he might misunderstand her feelings, and
  partly because he seemed irritated at being unwell, and at loss of power;
  irritated, at all events, at it being observed that he was not in his usual
  plenitude of strength and health.</p>

  <p>That night the Atlantic was troubled, and the wind carried the billows
  against the cliffs in a succession of rhythmic roars that filled the air with
  sound and made the earth quiver. Judith could not sleep, she listened to the
  thud of the water-heaps flung against the rocks; there was a clock on the
  stairs and in her wakefulness she listened to the tick of the clock, and the
  boom of the waves, now coming together, then one behind the other, now the
  wave-beat catching up the clock-tick, then falling in arrear, the ocean
  getting angry and making up its pace by a double beat. Moreover flakes of
  foam were carried on the wind and came, like snow, against her window that
  looked seaward striking the glass and adhering to it.</p>

  <p>As Judith lay watchful in the night her mind again recurred to the packet
  of arsenic that had been abstracted from her workbox. It was inconsiderate of
  her to have left it there; she ought to have locked her box. But who could
  have supposed that anyone would have gone to the box, raised the tray and
  searched the contents of the compartment beneath? Judith had been
  unaccustomed to lock up anything, because she had never had any secrets to
  hide from any eye. She again considered the probability of her aunt having
  removed it, and then it occurred to her that perhaps Miss Trevisa might have
  supposed that she&mdash;Judith&mdash;in a fit of revolt against the
  wretchedness of her life might be induced to take the poison herself and
  finish her miseries. "It was absurd if Aunt Dunes thought that," said Judith
  to herself; "she can little have known how my dear Papa's teaching has sunk
  into my heart, to suppose me capable of such a thing&mdash;and then&mdash;to
  run away like a coward and leave Jamie unprotected. It was too absurd."</p>

  <p>Next morning Judith was in her room getting a large needle with which to
  hem a bit of carpet edge that had been fraying for the last five years, and
  which no one had thought of putting a thread to, and so arresting the
  disintegration. Jamie was in the room. Judith said to him:</p>

  <p>"My dear, you have not been skinning and stuffing any birds lately, have
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No, Ju."</p>

  <p>"Because I have missed&mdash;but, Jamie, I hope you have not been at my
  workbox?"</p>

  <p>"What about your workbox, Ju?"</p>

  <p>She knew the boy so well, that her suspicions were at once aroused by this
  answer. When he had nothing to hide he replied with a direct negative or
  affirmative, but when he had done what his conscience would not quite allow
  was right, he fell into equivocation, and shuffled awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Jamie," said Judith, looking him straight in the face, "have you been to
  my box?"</p>

  <p>"Only just looked in."</p>

  <p>Then he ran to the window. "Oh, do see, Ju, how patched the glass is with
  foam!&mdash;and is it not dirty?"</p>

  <p>"Jamie, come back. I want an answer."</p>

  <p>He had opened the casement and put his hand out and was wiping off the
  patches of froth.</p>

  <p>"What a lot of it there is, Ju."</p>

  <p>"Come here, instantly, Jamie, and shut the window."</p>

  <p>The boy obeyed, creeping toward her sideways, with his head down.</p>

  <p>"Jamie, did you lift the tray?"</p>

  <p>"Only on one side, just a little bit."</p>

  <p>"Did you take anything from under the tray?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer immediately. She looked at him searchingly and in
  suspense. He never could endure this questioning look of hers, and he ran to
  her, put his arms round her waist, and clasped to her side, hid his face in
  her gown.</p>

  <p>"Only a little."</p>

  <p>"A little what?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Jamie, no lies. There was a blue paper there containing poison, that you
  were not to have unless there were occasion for it&mdash;some bird skin to be
  preserved and dressed with it. Now, did you take that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Go and bring it back to me immediately."</p>

  <p>"I can't."</p>

  <p>"Why not? Where is it?"</p>

  <p>The boy fidgeted, looked up in his sister's face to see what expression it
  bore, buried his head again, and said:</p>

  <p>"Ju! he is rightly called Cruel. I hate him, and so do you, don't you, Ju?
  I have put the arsenic into his oatmeal, and we will get rid of him and be
  free and go away. It will be jolly."</p>

  <p>"Jamie!" with a cry of horror.</p>

  <p>"He won't whip me and scold you any more."</p>

  <p>"Jamie! Oh, my Lord, have pity on him! have pity on us!"</p>

  <p>She clasped her hands to her head, rushed from the room, and flew down the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>But ten minutes before that Judith had given Coppinger his bowl of
  porridge. He had risen late that morning. He was better, he said, and he
  looked more himself than the preceding day. He was now seated at the table in
  the hall, and had poured the fresh milk into the bowl, had dipped the spoon,
  put some of the porridge to his mouth, tasted, and was looking curiously into
  the spoon, when the door was flung open, Judith entered, and without a word
  of explanation, caught the bowl from him and dashed it on the floor.</p>

  <p>Coppinger looked at her with his boring, dark eyes intently, and said:
  "What is the meaning of this?"</p>

  <p>"It is poisoned."</p>

  <p>Judith was breathless. She drew back relieved at having cast away the
  fatal mess.</p>

  <p>Coppinger rose to his feet, and glared at her across the table, leaning
  with his knuckles on the board. He did not speak for a moment, his face
  became livid, and his hands resting on the table shook as though he were
  shivering in an ague.</p>

  <p>"There is arsenic in the porridge," gasped Judith.</p>

  <p>She had not time to weigh what she should say, how explain her conduct;
  but one thought had held her&mdash;to save Coppinger's life while there was
  yet time.</p>

  <p>The Captain's dog that had been lying at his master's feet rose, went to
  the spilt porridge, and began to lap the milk and devour the paste. Neither
  Judith nor Coppinger regarded him.</p>

  <p>"It was an accident," faltered Judith.</p>

  <p>"You lie," said Coppinger, in thrilling tones, "you lie, you murderess!
  You sought to kill me."</p>

  <p>Judith did not answer for a moment. She also was trembling. She had to
  resolve what course to pursue. She could not, she would not, betray her
  brother, and subject him to the worst brutality of treatment from the
  infuriated man whose life he had sought.</p>

  <p>It were better for her to take the blame on herself.</p>

  <p>"I made the porridge&mdash;I and no one else."</p>

  <p>"You told me so, yesterday." He maintained his composure marvellously, but
  he was stunned by the sudden discovery of treachery in the woman he had loved
  and worshipped.</p>

  <p>"You maddened me by your treatment, but I did not desire that you should
  die. I repented and have saved your life."</p>

  <p>As Judith spoke she felt as though the flesh of her face stiffened, and
  the skin became as parchment. She could hardly open her mouth to speak and
  stir her tongue.</p>

  <p>"Go!" said Coppinger, pointing to the door. "Go, you and your brother.
  Othello cottage is empty. Go, murderess, poisoner of your husband, there and
  wait till you hear from me. Under one roof, to eat off one board, is
  henceforth impossible. Go!" he remained pointing, and a sulphurous fire
  flickered in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Then the hound began to howl, threw itself down, its limbs were
  contracted, it foamed at the mouth, and howled again.</p>

  <p>To the howlings of the poisoned and dying dog Judith and Jamie left
  Pentyre.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch47"
     name="ch47"></a>XLVII. &mdash; FAST IN HIS HANDS.</h2>

  <p class="first">Judith and Jamie were together in Othello
  Cottage&mdash;banished from Pentyre with a dark and threatening shadow over
  them, but this, however, gave the boy but little concern; he was delighted to
  be away from a house where he had been in incessant terror, and where he was
  under restraint; moreover, it was joy to him to be now where he need not meet
  Coppinger at every turn.</p>

  <p>Judith forbade his going to Polzeath to see Uncle Zachie and Oliver
  Menaida, as she thought it advisable, under the circumstances, to keep
  themselves to themselves, and above all not to give further occasion for the
  suspicions and jealousy of Coppinger. This was to her, under the present
  condition of affairs, specially distressing, as she needed some counsel as to
  what she should do. Uncle Zachie at his best was a poor adviser, but on no
  account now would she appeal to his son. She was embarrassed and alarmed. And
  she had excuse for embarrassment and alarm. She had taken upon herself the
  attempt that had been made on the life of Coppinger, and he would, she
  supposed, believe her to be guilty.</p>

  <p>What would he do? Would he proceed against her for attempted murder? If
  so, the case against her was very complete. It could be shown that Mr.
  Menaida had given her this arsenic, that she had kept it by her in her
  workbox while at the Glaze, that she had been on the most unsatisfactory
  terms with Captain Coppinger, and that she had refused to complete her
  marriage with him by appending her signature to the register. She was now
  aware&mdash;and the thought made her feel sick at heart and faint&mdash;that
  her association with the Menaidas had been most injudicious and had been
  capable of misinterpretation. It had been misinterpreted by Coppinger, and
  probably also by the gossips of Polzeath. It could be shown that a secret
  correspondence had been carried on between her and Oliver, which had been
  intercepted by her husband. This was followed immediately by the attempt to
  poison Coppinger. The arsenic had been given him in the porridge her own
  hands had mixed, and which had been touched by no one else. It was natural to
  conclude that she had deliberately purposed to destroy her husband, that she
  might be free to marry Oliver Menaida.</p>

  <p>If she were prosecuted on the criminal charge of attempted murder, the
  case could be made so conclusive against her that her conviction was
  certain.</p>

  <p>Her only chance of escape lay in two directions&mdash;one that she should
  tell the truth, and allow Jamie to suffer the consequences of what he had
  done, which would be prison or a lunatic asylum. The other was that she
  should continue to screen him and trust that Coppinger would not prosecute
  her. He might hesitate about proceeding with such a case, which would attract
  attention to himself, to his household, and lay bare to the public eye much
  that he would reasonably be supposed to wish to keep concealed. If, for
  instance, the case were brought into court the story of the enforced marriage
  must come out, and that would rake up once more the mystery of the wreckers
  on Doom Bar, and of Lady Knighton's jewels. Coppinger might and probably
  would grasp at the other alternative&mdash;take advantage of the incompletion
  of the marriage, repudiate her, and let the matter of the poisoned porridge
  remain untouched.</p>

  <p>The more Judith turned the matter over in her head the more sure she
  became that the best course, indeed the only one in which safety lay, was for
  her to continue to assume to herself the guilt of the attempt on Coppinger's
  life. He would see by her interference the second time, and prevention of his
  taking a second portion of the arsenic, that she did not really seek his
  life, but sought to force him, through personal fear, to drive her from his
  house and break the bond by which he bound her to him. For the sake of this
  going back from a purpose of murder, or from thinking that she had never
  intended to do more than drive him to a separation by alarm for his own
  safety; for the sake of the old love he had borne her, he might forbear
  pressing this matter to its bitter consequences, and accept what she
  desired&mdash;their separation.</p>

  <p>But if Judith allowed the truth to come out, then her husband would have
  no such compunction. It would be an opportunity for him to get rid of the boy
  he detested, and even if he did not have him consigned to jail, then it would
  be only because he would send him to an asylum.</p>

  <p>Judith went out on the cliffs. The sea was troubled, far as the horizon,
  strewn with white horses shaking their manes, pawing and prancing in their
  gallop landward. There was no blue, no greenness in the ocean now. The dull
  tinctures of winter were in it. The Atlantic wore its scowl, was leaden and
  impatient. The foam on the rocks was driven up in spouts into the air and
  carried over the downs, it caught in the thorn bushes like flocks of wool,
  and was no cleaner. It lay with the thin melting snow and melted with it into
  a dirty slush. It plastered the face of Othello Cottage as though, in brutal
  insolence, Ocean had been spitting at the house that was built of the wreck
  he had failed to gulp down, though he had chewed the life out of it. The foam
  rested in flakes on the rushes where it hung and fluttered like tufts of
  cotton-grass. It was dropped about by the wind for miles inland as though the
  wind were running in a paper chase. It was as though sky and sea were
  contending in a game of pelting the land, the one with snow, the other with
  foam, the one sweet, the other salt. Judith walked where, near the edge of
  the cliffs, there was no snow, and looked out at the angry ocean. All without
  was cold, rugged, ruffled, wretched; and within her heart burned a fire of
  apprehension, distress, almost of despair. All at once she came upon Mr.
  Desiderius Mules, walking in an opposite direction, engaged in wiping the
  foam-flakes out of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Halloo! you here Mrs. Coppinger?" exclaimed the rector; "glad to see you.
  I'm not here like S. Anthony preaching to the fishes, because I am a
  practical man. In the first place, in such a disturbed sea the fishes would
  have enough to do to look after themselves and would be ill-disposed to lend
  me an ear. In the next place the wind is on shore, and they would not hear me
  were I to lift up my voice. So I don't waste words and over-strain my larynx.
  If the bishop were a mile or a mile and a half inland, it might be different,
  he might admire my zeal. And what brings you here?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Mules!" exclaimed Judith, with a leap of hope in her
  heart&mdash;here was someone who might if he would be a help to her. She had
  indeed made up her own mind as to what was the safest road on which to set
  her feet, but she was timid, shrank from falsehood, and earnestly craved for
  someone to whom she could speak, and from whom she could obtain advice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Mules! will you give me some advice and assistance?"</p>

  <p>"Advice, by all means," said the rector. "I'll turn and walk your way, the
  froth is blown into my face and stings it. My skin is sensitive, so are my
  eyes. Upon my word, when I get home my face will be as salt as if I had
  flooded it with tears&mdash;fancy me crying. What did you say you
  wanted&mdash;advice?"</p>

  <p>"Advice and assistance."</p>

  <p>"Advice you shall have, it is my profession to give it. I mix it with
  pepper and salt and serve it out in soup plates every week&mdash;am ready
  with it every day, Mrs. Coppinger. I have buckets of it at your disposal,
  bring your tureen and I'll tip in as much of the broth as you want, and may
  you like it. As to assistance, that is another matter. Pecuniary assistance I
  never give. I am unable to do so. My principles stand in the way. I have set
  up a high standard for myself and I stick to it. I never render pecuniary
  assistance to any one, as it demoralizes the receiver. I hope and trust it
  was not pecuniary assistance you wanted."</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Mules&mdash;not that, only guidance."</p>

  <p>"Oh, guidance! I'm your sign-post, where do you want to go!"</p>

  <p>"It is this, sir. I have given poison to Mr. Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"Mercy on me!" the rector jumped back and turned much the tinge of the
  foam plasters that were on his face.</p>

  <p>"That is to say, I gave him arsenic mixed with his porridge the day before
  yesterday, and it made him very ill. Yesterday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush, hush!" said Mr. Mules, "no more of this. This is ghastly. Let us
  say it is hallucination on your part. You are either not right in your head
  or are very wicked. If you please&mdash;don't come nearer to me. I can hear
  you quite well, hear a great deal more than pleases me. You ask my advice,
  and I give it: Sign the register, that will set me square, and put me in an
  unassailable position with the public, and also, secondarily, it will be to
  your advantage. You are now a nondescript, and a nondescript is
  objectionable. If you please&mdash;you will excuse me&mdash;I should prefer
  <i>not</i> standing between you and the cliff. There is no knowing what a
  person who confesses to poisoning her husband might do. If it be a case of
  lunacy&mdash;well, more reason that I should use precautions. My life is
  valuable. Come, there is only one thing you can do to make me
  comfortable&mdash;sign the register."</p>

  <p>"You will not mention what I have told you to anyone?"</p>

  <p>"Save and defend us! I speak of it!&mdash;I! Come, come, be rational. Sign
  the register and set my mind at ease, that is all I want and ask for, and
  then I wash my hands of you."</p>

  <p>Then away went Mr. Desiderius Mules, with the wind catching his coat
  tails, twisting them, throwing them up against his back, parting them, and
  driving them one on each of him, taking and cutting them and sending them
  between his legs.</p>

  <p>Judith stood mournfully looking after him. The sign-post, as he had called
  himself was flying from the traveller whom it was his duty to direct.</p>

  <p>Then a hand was laid on her arm. She started, turned and saw Oliver
  Menaida, flushed with rapid walking and with the fresh air he had
  encountered.</p>

  <p>"I have come to see you," he said. "I have come to offer you my father's
  and my assistance. We have just heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"That Captain Coppinger has turned you and Jamie out of his house."</p>

  <p>"Have you heard any reason assigned?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;so it is said&mdash;he had beaten the boy, and you were
  incensed, angry words passed&mdash;and it ended in a rupture."</p>

  <p>"That, then, is the common explanation?"</p>

  <p>"Everyone is talking about it. Everyone says that. And now, what will you
  do?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Jamie and I are at Othello Cottage, where we are comfortable.
  My aunt had furnished it intending to reside in it herself. As for our food,
  we receive that from the Glaze."</p>

  <p>"But this cannot continue."</p>

  <p>"It must continue for a while."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"The future is not open to my eyes."</p>

  <p>"Judith, that has taken place at length which I have been long
  expecting."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"This miserable condition of affairs has reached its climax, and there has
  been a turn."</p>

  <p>Judith sighed. "It has taken a turn, indeed."</p>

  <p>"Now that Captain Coppinger has been brought to his senses, and he sees
  that your resolve is not to be shaken, and he releases you, or you have
  released yourself from the thraldom you have been in. I do not suppose the
  popular account of the matter is true, wholly."</p>

  <p>"It is not at all true."</p>

  <p>"That matters not. The fact remains that you are out of Pentyre Glaze and
  your own mistress. The snare is broken and you are delivered."</p>

  <p>Again Judith sighed, and she shook her head despondingly.</p>

  <p>"You are free," persisted Oliver, "just consider. You were hurried through
  a marriage when insensible, and when you came to consciousness you did what
  was the only thing you could do&mdash;you absolutely refused your signature
  that would validate what had taken place. That was conclusive. That ceremony
  was as worthless as this sea-foam that blows by. No court in the world would
  hold that you were bound by it. The consent, the free consent, of each party
  in such a convention is essential. As to your being at Pentyre, nothing
  against that can be alleged; Miss Trevisa was your aunt and constituted your
  guardian by your father. Your place was by her. To her you went when my
  father's house was no longer at your service through my return. At Pentyre
  you remained as long as Miss Trevisa was there. She went, and at once you
  left the house."</p>

  <p>"You do not understand."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, I think I do. But no matter as to details. When your aunt
  went, you went also&mdash;as was proper under the circumstances. We have
  heard, I do not know whether it be true, that your aunt has come in for a
  good property."</p>

  <p>"For a little something."</p>

  <p>"Then, shall you go to her and reside with her?"</p>

  <p>"No; she will not have Jamie and me."</p>

  <p>"So we supposed. Now my father has a proposal to make. The firm to which I
  belong has been good enough to take me into partnership, esteeming my
  services far higher than they deserve, and I am to live at Oporto, and act
  for them there. As my income will now be far larger than my humble
  requirements, I have resolved to allow my dear father sufficient for him to
  live upon comfortably where he wills, and he has elected to follow me, and
  take up his abode in Portugal. Now what he has commissioned me to say
  is&mdash;will you go with him? Will you continue to regard him as Uncle
  Zachie, and be to him as his dear little niece, and keep house for him in the
  sunny southern land?"</p>

  <p>Judith's eyes filled with tears.</p>

  <p>"And Jamie is included in the invitation. He is to come also, and help my
  father to stuff the birds of Portugal. A new ornithological field is opening
  before him, he says and he must have help in it."</p>

  <p>"I cannot," said Judith, in a low tone, with her head sunk on her breast.
  "I cannot leave here till Captain Coppinger gives me leave."</p>

  <p>"But, surely, you are no longer bound to him?"</p>

  <p>"He holds me faster than before."</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand this."</p>

  <p>"No; because you do not know all."</p>

  <p>"Tell me the whole truth. Let me help you. Let my father help you. You
  little know how we both have our hearts in your service."</p>

  <p>"Well, I will tell you."</p>

  <p>But she hesitated and trembled. She fixed her eyes on the wild, foaming,
  leaden sea, and pressed her bosom with both hands.</p>

  <p>"I poisoned him."</p>

  <p>"Judith!"</p>

  <p>"It is true, I gave him arsenic, once; that your father had let me have
  for Jamie. If he had taken it the second time, when I offered it him in his
  bowl of porridge, he would be dead now. Do you see&mdash;he holds me in his
  hands and I cannot stir. I could not escape till I know what he intends to do
  with me. Now go&mdash;leave me to my fate."</p>

  <p>"Judith&mdash;it is not true! Though I hear this from your lips I will not
  believe it. No; you need my father's, you need my help more than ever." He
  put her hand to his lips. "It is white&mdash;innocent. I <i>know</i> it, in
  spite of your words."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch48"
     name="ch48"></a>XLVIII. &mdash; TWO ALTERNATIVES.</h2>

  <p class="first">When Judith returned to Othello Cottage, she was surprised
  to see a man promenading around it, flattening his nose at the window, so as
  to bring his eyes against the glass, then, finding that the breath from his
  nostrils dimmed the pane, wiping the glass and again flattening his nose. At
  first he held his hands on the window-ledge, but being incommoded by the
  refraction of the light, put his open hands against the pane, one on each
  side of his face. Having satisfied himself at one casement, he went to
  another, and made the same desperate efforts to see in at that.</p>

  <p>Judith coming up to the door, and putting the key in, disturbed him, he
  started, turned, and with a nose much like putty, but rapidly purpling with
  returned circulation, disclosed the features of Mr. Scantlebray, Senior.</p>

  <p>"Ah, ha!" said that gentleman, in no way disconcerted; "here I have you,
  after having been looking for my orphing charmer in every direction but the
  right one. With your favor I will come inside and have a chat."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said Judith, "but I do not desire to admit visitors."</p>

  <p>"But I am an exception. I'm the man who should have looked after your
  interests, and would have done it a deal better than others. And so there has
  been a rumpus, eh? What about?"</p>

  <p>"I really beg your pardon, Mr. Scantlebray, but I am engaged and cannot
  ask you to enter, nor delay conversing with you on the doorstep."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jimminy! don't consider me. I'll stand on the doorstep and talk with
  you inside. Don't consider me; go on with what you have to do and let me
  amuse you. It must be dull and solitary here, but I will enliven you, though
  I have not my brother's gifts. Now, Obadiah is a man with a genius for
  entertaining people. He missed his way when he started in life; he would have
  made a comic actor. Bless your simple heart, had that man appeared on the
  boards, he would have brought the house down&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt whatever he missed his way when he took to keeping an
  asylum," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"We have all our gifts," said Scantlebray. "Mine is architecture, and 'pon
  my honor as a gentleman, I do admire the structure of Othello Cottage,
  uncommon. You won't object to my pulling out my tape and taking the plan of
  the edifice, will you?"</p>

  <p>"The house belongs to Captain Coppinger; consult him."</p>

  <p>"My dear orphing, not a bit. I'm not on the best terms with that gent.
  There lies a tract of ruffled water between us. Not that I have given him
  cause for offence, but that he is not sweet upon me. He took off my hands the
  management of your affairs in the valuation business, and let me tell
  you&mdash;between me and you and that post yonder"&mdash;he walked in and
  laid his hand on a beam&mdash;"that he mismanaged it confoundedly. He is your
  husband, I am well aware, and I ought not to say this to you. He took the job
  into his hands because he had an eye to you, I knew that well enough. But he
  hadn't the gift&mdash;the faculty. Now I have made all that sort of thing my
  specialty. How many rooms have you in this house? What does that door lead
  to?"</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Scantlebray, you must excuse me; I am busy."</p>

  <p>"O, yes&mdash;vastly busy. Walking on the cliffs, eh! Alone, eh? Well, mum
  is the word. Come, make me your friend and tell me all about it. How came you
  here? There are all kind of stories afloat about the quarrel between you and
  your husband, and he is an Eolus, a Blustering Boreas, all the winds in one
  box. Not surprised. He blew up a gale against me once. Domestic felicity is a
  fable of the poets. Home is a region of cyclones, tornadoes,
  hurricanes&mdash;what you like; anything but a Pacific Ocean. Now, you won't
  mind my throwing an eye round this house, will you&mdash;a scientific eye?
  Architecture is my passion."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Scantlebray, that is my bedroom; I forbid you touching the handle.
  Excuse me&mdash;but I must request you to leave me in peace."</p>

  <p>"My dear creature," said Scantlebray, "scientific thirst before all. It is
  unslakable save by the acquisition of what it desires. The structure of this
  house, as well as its object, has always been a puzzle to me. So your aunt
  was to have lived here&mdash;the divine, the fascinating Dionysia, as I
  remember her years ago. It wasn't built for the lovely Dionysia, was it? No.
  Then for what object was it built? And why so long untenanted? These are nuts
  for you to crack."</p>

  <p>"I do not trouble myself about these questions. I must pray you to
  depart."</p>

  <p>"In half the twinkle of an eye," said Scantlebray. Then he seated himself.
  "Come, you haven't a superabundance of friends. Make me one and unburden your
  soul to me. What is it all about? Why are you here? What has caused this
  squabble? I have a brother a solicitor at Bodmin. Let me jot down the items,
  and we'll get a case out of it. Trust me as a friend, and I'll have you
  righted. I hear Miss Trevisa has come in for a fortune. Be a good girl, set
  your back against her and show fight."</p>

  <p>"I will thank you to leave the house," said Judith, haughtily. "A moment
  ago you made reference to your honor as a gentleman. I must appeal to that
  same honor which you pride yourself on possessing, and, by virtue of that,
  request you to depart."</p>

  <p>"I'll go, I'll go. But, my dear child, why are you in such a hurry to get
  rid of me? Are you expecting some one? It is an odd thing, but as I came
  along I was overtaken by Mr. Oliver Menaida, making his way to the
  downs&mdash;to look at the sea, which is rough, and inhale the breeze of the
  ocean, of course. At one time, I am informed, you made daily visits to
  Polzeath, daily visits while Captain Coppinger was on the sea. Since his
  return, I am informed, these visits have been discontinued. Is it possible
  that instead of your visiting Mr. Oliver, Mr. Oliver is now visiting
  you&mdash;here, in this cottage?"</p>

  <p>A sudden slash across the back and shoulders made Mr. Scantlebray jump and
  bound aside. Coppinger had entered, and was armed with a stout
  walking-stick.</p>

  <p>"What brings you here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I came to pay my respects to the grass-widow," sneered Scantlebray, as he
  sidled to the door and bolted, but not till, with a face full of malignity,
  he had shaken his fist at Coppinger, behind his back.</p>

  <p>"What brings this man here?" asked the Captain.</p>

  <p>"Impertinence&mdash;nothing else," answered Judith.</p>

  <p>"What was that he said about Oliver Menaida?"</p>

  <p>"His insolence will not bear reporting."</p>

  <p>"You are right. He is a cur, and deserves to be kicked, not spoken to or
  spoken of. I heed him not. There is in him a grudge against me. He thought at
  one time that I would have taken his daughter&mdash;do you recall speaking to
  me once about the girl that you supposed was a fit mate for me! I
  laughed&mdash;I thought you had heard the chatter about Polly Scantlebray and
  me. A bold, fine girl, full of blood as a cherry is full of juice&mdash;one
  of the stock&mdash;but with better looks than the men, yet with the
  assurance, the effrontery of her father. A girl to laugh and talk with, not
  to take to one's heart. I care for Polly Scantlebray! Not I! That man has
  never forgiven me the disappointment because I did not take her. I never
  intended to. I despised her. Now you know all. Now you see why he hates me. I
  do not care. I am his match. But I will not have him insolent to you. What
  did he say?"</p>

  <p>It was a relief to Judith that Captain Coppinger had not heard the words
  that Mr. Scantlebray had used. They would have inflamed his jealousy, and
  fired him into fury against the speaker.</p>

  <p>"He told me that he had been passed, on his way hither, by Mr. Oliver
  Menaida, coming to the cliffs to inhale the sea air and look at the angry
  ocean."</p>

  <p>Captain Coppinger was satisfied, or pretended to be so. He went to the
  door and shut it, but not till he had gone outside and looked round to see,
  so Judith thought, whether Oliver Menaida were coming that way, quite as much
  as to satisfy himself that Mr. Scantlebray was not lurking round a corner
  listening.</p>

  <p>No! Oliver Menaida would not come there. Of that Judith was quite sure. He
  had the delicacy of mind and the good sense not to risk her reputation by
  approaching Othello Cottage. When he had made that offer to her she had known
  that his own heart spoke, but he had veiled its speech and had made the offer
  as from his father, and in such a way as not to offend her. Only when she had
  accused herself of attempted murder did he break through his reserve to show
  her his rooted confidence in her innocence, in spite of her confession.</p>

  <p>When the door was fast, Coppinger came over to Judith, and, standing at a
  little distance from her, said:</p>

  <p>"Judith, look at me."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes to him. He was pale and his face lined, but he had
  recovered greatly since that day when she had seen him suffering from the
  effects of the poison.</p>

  <p>"Judith," said he, "I know all."</p>

  <p>"What do you know?"</p>

  <p>"You did not poison me."</p>

  <p>"I mixed and prepared the bowl for you."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but the poison had been put into the oatmeal before, not by
  you, not with your knowledge."</p>

  <p>She was silent. She was no adept at lying; she could not invent another
  falsehood to convince him of her guilt.</p>

  <p>"I know how it all came about," pursued Captain Coppinger. "The cook,
  Jane, has told me. Jamie came into the kitchen with a blue paper in his hand,
  asked for the oatmeal, and put in the contents of the paper so openly as not
  in the least to arouse suspicion. Not till I was taken ill and made inquiries
  did the woman connect his act with what followed. I have found the blue
  paper, and on it it is written, in Mr. Menaida's handwriting, which I know,
  'Arsenic. Poison: for Jamie, only to be used for the dressing of bird-skins,
  and a limited amount to be served to him at a time.' Now I am satisfied,
  because I know your character, and because I saw innocence in your manner
  when you came down to me on the second occasion, and dashed the bowl from my
  lips&mdash;I saw then that you were innocent."</p>

  <p>Judith said nothing. Her eyes rested on the ground.</p>

  <p>"I had angered that fool of a boy, I had beaten him. In a fit of sullen
  revenge, and without calculating either how best to do it, or what the
  consequences would be, he went to the place where he knew the arsenic
  was&mdash;Mr. Menaida had impressed on him the danger of playing with the
  poison&mdash;and he abstracted it. But he had not the wit or cunning
  generally present in idiots&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He is no idiot," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"No, in fools," said Coppinger, "to put the poison into the oatmeal
  secretly when no one was in the kitchen. He asked the cook for the meal and
  mingled the contents of the paper into it so openly as to disarm
  suspicion."</p>

  <p>He paused for Judith to speak, but she did not.</p>

  <p>He went on: "Then you, in utter guilelessness, prepared my breakfast for
  me, as instructed by Miss Trevisa. Next morning you did the same, but were
  either suspicious of evil through missing the paper from your cabinet, or
  drawer, or wherever you kept it, or else Jamie confessed to you what he had
  done. Thereupon you rushed to me to save me from taking another portion. I do
  not know that I would have taken it; I had formed a half-suspicion from the
  burning sensation in my throat, and from what I saw in the spoon&mdash;but
  there was no doubt in my mind after the first discovery that you were
  guiltless. I sought the whole matter out, as far as I was able. Jamie is
  guilty&mdash;not you."</p>

  <p>"And," said Judith, drawing a long breath, "what about Jamie?"</p>

  <p>"There are two alternatives," said Coppinger; "the boy is dangerous. Never
  again shall he come under my roof."</p>

  <p>"No," spoke Judith, "no, he must not go to the Glaze again. Let him remain
  here with me. I will take care of him that he does mischief to no one. He
  would never have hurt you had not you hurt him. Forgive him, because he was
  aggravated to it by the unjust and cruel treatment he received."</p>

  <p>"The boy is a mischievous idiot," said Coppinger; "he must not be allowed
  to be at large."</p>

  <p>"What, then, are your alternatives?"</p>

  <p>"In the first place, I propose to send him back to that establishment
  whence he should never have been released, to Scantlebray's Asylum."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no!" gasped Judith. "You do not know what that place
  is. I do. I got into it. I saw how Jamie had been treated."</p>

  <p>"He cannot be treated too severely. He is dangerous. You refuse this
  alternative?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed, I do."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Then I put the matter in the hands of justice, and he is
  proceeded against and convicted as having attempted my life with poison. To
  jail he will go."</p>

  <p>It was as Judith had feared. There were but two destinations for Jamie,
  her dear, dear brother, the son of that blameless father&mdash;jail or an
  asylum.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no! no&mdash;no! not that!" cried Judith.</p>

  <p>"One or the other. I give you six hours to choose," said Coppinger. Then
  he went to the door, opened it, and stood looking seaward. Suddenly he
  started, "Ha! the Black Prince." He turned in the door and said to Judith:
  "One hour after sunset come to Pentyre Glaze. Come alone, and tell me your
  decision. I will wait for that."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch49"
     name="ch49"></a>XLIX. &mdash; NOTHING LIKE GROG.</h2>

  <p class="first">The Black Prince had been observed by Oliver Menaida. He did
  not know for certain that the vessel he saw in the offing was the smuggler's
  ship, but he suspected it, as he knew that Coppinger was in daily expectation
  of her arrival. He brought his father to the cliffs, and the old man at once
  identified her.</p>

  <p>Oliver considered what was to be done.</p>

  <p>A feint was to be made at a point lower down the coast so as to attract
  the coast-guard in that direction; whereas, she was to run for Pentyre as
  soon as night fell, with all lights hidden, and to discharge her cargo in the
  little cove.</p>

  <p>Oliver knew pretty well who was confederate with Coppinger, or were in his
  employ. His father was able to furnish him with a good deal of information,
  not perhaps very well authenticated, all resting on gossip. He resolved to
  have a look at these men, and observe whether they were making preparations
  to assist Coppinger in clearing the Black Prince the moment she arrived off
  the cove. But he found that he had not far to look. They were drawn to the
  cliffs one after another to observe the distant vessel.</p>

  <p>Oliver now made his way to the coast-guard station, and to reach it went
  round by Wadebridge, and this he did because he wished to avoid being noticed
  going to the Preventive Station across the estuary at the Doom Bar above St.
  Enodoc. On reaching his destination he was shown into an ante-room, where he
  had to wait some minutes, because the captain happened to be engaged. He had
  plenty to occupy his mind. There was that mysterious confession of Judith
  that she had tried to poison the man who persisted in considering himself as
  her husband, in spite of her resistance, and who was holding her in a
  condition of bondage in his house. Oliver did not for a moment believe that
  she had intentionally sought his life. He had seen enough of her to gauge her
  character, and he knew that she was incapable of committing a crime. That she
  might have given poison in ignorance and by accident was possible; how this
  had happened it was in vain for him to attempt to conjecture; he could,
  however, quite believe that an innocent and sensitive conscience like that of
  Judith might feel the pangs of self-reproach when hurt had come to Coppinger
  through her negligence.</p>

  <p>Oliver could also believe that the smuggler captain attributed her act to
  an evil motive. He was not the man to believe in guilelessness, and when he
  found that he had been partly poisoned by the woman whom he daily tortured
  almost to madness, he would at once conclude that a premeditated attempt had
  been made on his life. What course would he pursue? Would he make this
  wretched business public and bring a criminal action against the unfortunate
  and unhappy girl who was linked to him against her will?</p>

  <p>Oliver saw that if he could obtain Coppinger's arrest on some such a
  charge as smuggling, he might prevent this scandal, and save Judith from much
  humiliation and misery. He was therefore most desirous to effect the capture
  of Coppinger at once and <i>flagrante delicto</i>.</p>

  <p>As he waited in the ante-room a harsh voice within was audible which he
  recognized as that of Mr. Scantlebray. Presently the door was half opened,
  and he heard the coast-guard captain say:</p>

  <p>"I trust you rewarded the fellow for his information. You may apply to
  me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"O royally, royally."</p>

  <p>"And for furnishing you with the code of signals?"</p>

  <p>"Imperially&mdash;imperially."</p>

  <p>"That is well&mdash;never underpay in these matters."</p>

  <p>"Do not fear! I emptied my pockets. And as to the information you have
  received through me&mdash;rely on it as you would on the Bank of
  England."</p>

  <p>"You have been deceived and befooled," said Oliver, unable to resist the
  chance of delivering a slap at a man for whom he entertained a peculiar
  aversion, having heard much concerning him from his father.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"That the shilling you gave the clerk for his information, and the
  half-crown for his signal table were worth what you got&mdash;the information
  was false, and was intended to mislead."</p>

  <p>Scantlebray colored purple. "What do you know? You know nothing. You are
  in league with them."</p>

  <p>"Take care what you say," said Oliver.</p>

  <p>"I maintain," said Scantlebray, somewhat cowed by his demeanor, "that what
  I have said to the captain here is something of which you know
  nothing&mdash;and which is of importance to him to know."</p>

  <p>"And I maintain that you have been hoodwinked," answered Oliver. "But it
  matters not. The event will prove which of us is on the right track."</p>

  <p>"Yes," laughed Scantlebray, "so be it; and let me bet you, Captain, and
  you Mr. Oliver Menaida&mdash;that I am on the scent of something else. I
  believe I know where Coppinger keeps his stores, and&mdash;but you shall see,
  and Captain Cruel also, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>Rubbing his hands he went out.</p>

  <p>Then Oliver begged a word with the Preventive captain, and told him what
  he had overheard, and also that he knew where was the cave in which the
  smugglers had their boat and to which they ran the cargo first, before
  removing it to their inland stores.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so certain the Black Prince dare venture nigh the coast
  to-night," said the Captain, "because of the sea and the on-shore wind. But
  the glass is rising and the wind may change. Then she'll risk it for certain.
  Now, look you here. I can't go with you myself to-night, because I must be
  here; and I can only let you have six men."</p>

  <p>"That will suffice."</p>

  <p>"Under Wyvill. I cannot, of course, put them under you, but Wyvill shall
  command. He bears a grudge against Coppinger, and will be rejoiced to have
  the chance of paying it out. But, mind you, it is possible that the Black
  Prince dare not run in, because of the weather, at Pentyre Cove, she may run
  somewhere else, either down the coast or higher up. Coppinger has other ovens
  than one. You know the term. His store-places are ovens. We can't find them,
  but we know that there are several of them along the coast, just as there are
  a score of landing-places. When one is watched, then another is used, and
  that is how we are thrown out. There are plenty of folk interested in
  defrauding the revenue in every parish between Hartland and Land's End, and
  let the Black Prince, or any other smuggling vessel appear where she will,
  there she has ready helpers to shore her cargo, and convey it to the ovens.
  When we appear it is signalled at once to the vessel, and she runs away up or
  down the coast, and discharges somewhere else, before we can reach the point.
  Now, I do not say that what you tell me is not true, and that it is not
  Coppinger's intent to land the goods in the Pentyre Cove, but if we are
  smelt, or if the wind or sea forbid a landing there, away goes the Black
  Prince and runs her cargo somewhere else. That is why I cannot accompany you,
  nor can I send you with more than half a dozen men. I must be on the look
  out, and I must be prepared in the event of her coming suddenly back and
  attempting to land her goods at Porth-leze, or Constantine, or Harlyn. What
  you shall do is&mdash;remain here with me till near dusk, and then you shall
  have a boat and my men and get round Pentyre, and you shall take possession
  of that cave. You shall take with you provisions for twenty-four hours. If
  the Black Prince intends to make that bay and discharge there, then she will
  wait her opportunity. If she cannot to-night, she will to-morrow night. Now,
  seize every man who comes into that cave, and don't let him out. You
  see?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Wyvill shall be in command, and you shall be the guide, and I
  will speak to him to pay proper attention to what you recommend. You
  see?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;now we shall have something to eat and to drink, which is
  better, and drink that is worth the drinking, which is best of all. Here is
  some cognac, it was run goods that we captured and confiscated. Look at it. I
  wish there were artificial light and you would see, it is liquid
  amber&mdash;a liqueur. When you've tasted that, ah-ha! you will say, 'Glad I
  lived to this moment.' There is all the difference, my boy, between your best
  cognac and common brandy&mdash;the one, the condensed sunshine in the queen
  of fruit sublimed to an essence; the other, coarse, raw fire&mdash;all the
  difference that there is between a princess of blood royal and a gypsy wench.
  Drink and do not fear. This is not the stuff to smoke the head and clog the
  stomach."</p>

  <p>When Oliver Menaida finally started, he left the first officer of the
  coast-guard, in spite of his assurances, somewhat smoky in brain, and not in
  the condition to form the clearest estimate of what should be done in a
  contingency. The boat was laden with provisions for twenty-four hours, and
  placed under the command of Wyvill.</p>

  <p>The crew had not rowed far before one of them sang out:</p>

  <p>"Gearge!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, mate!" responded Wyvill.</p>

  <p>"I say, Gearge. Be us a going round Pentyre?"</p>

  <p>"I reckon we be."</p>

  <p>"And wet to the marrowbone we shall be."</p>

  <p>"I reckon we shall."</p>

  <p>Then a pause in the conversation. Presently from another, "Gearge!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, Will!"</p>

  <p>"I say Gearge! where be the spirits to? There's a keg o' water, but sure
  alive the spirits be forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Bless my body!" exclaimed Wyvill, "I reckon you're right. Here's a
  go."</p>

  <p>"It will never do for us to be twenty-four hours wi' salt water outside of
  us and fresh wi'in," said Will. "What's a hat wi'out a head in it, or boots
  wi'out feet in 'em, or a man wi'out spirits in his in'ard parts?"</p>

  <p>"Dear, alive! 'Tis a nuisance," said Wyvill. "Who's been the idiot to
  forget the spirits?"</p>

  <p>"Gearge!"</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, Samson!"</p>

  <p>"I say, Gearge! hadn't us better run over to the Rock and get a little
  anker there?"</p>

  <p>"I reckon it wouldn't be amiss, mate," responded Wyvill. To Oliver's
  astonishment and annoyance, the boat was turned to run across to a little
  tavern, at what was called "The Rock."</p>

  <p>He remonstrated. This was injudicious and unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"Onnecessary," said Wyvill. "Why, you don't suppose fire-arms will go off
  wi'out a charge? It's the same wi' men. What's the good of a human being
  unless he be loaded&mdash;and what's his proper load but a drop o'
  spirits."</p>

  <p>Then one of the rowers sang out:</p>

  <p>"Water-drinkers are dull asses When they're met together. Milk is meat for
  infancy; Ladies like to sip Bohea; Not such stuff for you and me, When we're
  met together."</p>

  <p>Oliver was not surprised that so few captures were effected on the coast,
  when those set to watch it loved so dearly the very goods they were to watch
  against being imported untaxed.</p>

  <p>On reaching the shore, the man Samson and another were left in charge of
  the boat, while Wyvill, Will, and the rest went up to the Rock Inn to have a
  glass for the good of the house, and to lade themselves with an anker of
  brandy which, during their wait in the cave, was to be distributed among
  them. Oliver thought it well to go to the tavern as well. He was impatient
  and thought they would dawdle there, and, perhaps, take more than the nip to
  which they professed themselves content to limit themselves. Pentyre Point
  had to be rounded in rough water, and they must be primed to enable them to
  round Pentyre.</p>

  <p>"You see," said Wyvill, who seemed to suppose that some sort of an
  explanation of his conduct was due. "When ropes be dry they be terrible
  slack. Wet 'em and they are taut. It is the same wi' men's muscles. We've
  Pentyre Point to get round. Very strainin' to the arms, and I reckon it
  couldn't be done unless we wetted the muscles. That's reason. That's
  convincin'."</p>

  <p>At the Rock Tavern the Preventive men found the clerk of S. Enodoc, with
  his hands in his pockets, on the settle, his legs stretched out before him,
  considering one of his knees that was threadbare, and trying to make up his
  mind whether the trouser would hold out another day without a thread being
  run through the thin portion, and whether if a day, then perhaps two days,
  and if perchance for two days, then for three. But if for three, then why not
  for four! And if for four, then possibly for five&mdash;anyhow, as far as he
  could judge, there was no immediate call for him to have the right knee of
  his trouser repaired that day.</p>

  <p>The sexton-clerk looked up when the party entered, and greeted them each
  man by name, and a conversation ensued relative to the weather. Each
  described his own impressions as to what the weather had been, and his
  anticipations as to what it would be.</p>

  <p>"And how's your missus?"</p>

  <p>"Middlin'&mdash;and yours?"</p>

  <p>"Same, thanky'. A little troubled wi' the rheumatics."</p>

  <p>"Tell her to take a lump o' sugar wi' five drops o' turpentine."</p>

  <p>"I will, thanky"&mdash;and so on for half an hour, at the end of which
  time the party thought it time to rise, wipe their mouths, shoulder the
  anker, and return to the boat.</p>

  <p>No sooner were they in it, and had thrust off from shore, and prepared to
  make a second start, than Oliver touched Wyvill and said, pointing to the
  land, "Look yonder."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>"There is that clerk. Running, actually running."</p>

  <p>"I reckon he be."</p>

  <p>"And in the direction of Pentyre."</p>

  <p>"So he be, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"And what do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," answered Wyvill, confusedly. "Why should I? He can't say
  nothing about where we be going. Not a word of that was said while us was
  there. I don't put no store on his running."</p>

  <p>"I do," said Oliver, unable to smother his annoyance. "This folly will
  spoil our game."</p>

  <p>Wyvill muttered, "I reckon I'm head of the consarn and not you."</p>

  <p>Oliver deemed it advisable, as the words were said low, to pretend that he
  did not hear them.</p>

  <p>The wind had somewhat abated, but the sea was running furiously round
  Pentyre. Happily the tide was going out, so that tide and wind were
  conflicting, and this enabled the rowers to get round Pentyre between the
  Point and the Newland Isle, that broke the force of the seas. But when past
  the shelter of Newland, doubling a spur of Pentyre that ran to the north, the
  rowers had to use their utmost endeavors, and had not their muscles been
  moistened they might possibly have declared it impossible to proceed. It was
  advisable to run into the cove just after dark, and before the turn of the
  tide, as, in the event of the Black Prince attempting to land her cargo
  there, it would be made with the flow of the tide, and in the darkness.</p>

  <p>The cove was reached and found to be deserted. Oliver showed the way, and
  the boat was driven up on the shingle and conveyed into the smugglers' cave
  behind the rock curtain. No one was there. Evidently, from the preparations
  made, the smugglers were ready for the run of the cargo that night.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Will, one of the Preventive men, "us hev' a' labored uncommon.
  What say you, mates? Does us desarve a drop of refreshment or does us not?
  Every man as does his dooty by his country and his king should be paid for
  't, is my doctrine. What do y' say, Gearge? Sarve out the grog?"</p>

  <p>"I reckon yes. Sarve out the grog. There's nothing like grog&mdash;I think
  it was Solomon said that, and he was the wisest of men."</p>

  <p>"For sure; he made a song about it," said one of the coast-guard. "It
  begins:</p>

  <p>"'A plague of those musty old lubbers, Who tell us to fast and to think.
  And patient fall in with life's rubbers, With nothing but water to
  drink.'"</p>

  <p>"To be sure," responded Wyvill, "never was a truer word said than when
  Solomon was called the wisest o' men."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch50"
     name="ch50"></a>L. &mdash; PLAYING FORFEITS.</h2>

  <p class="first">"Here am I once more," said Mr. Scantlebray, walking into
  Othello Cottage with a rap at the door but without waiting for an invitation
  to enter. "Come back like the golden summer, but at a quicker rate. How are
  you all? I left you rather curtly&mdash;without having had time to pay my
  proper <i>cong</i>."</p>

  <p>Judith and Jamie were sitting over the fire. No candle had been lighted,
  for, though a good many things had been brought over to Othello Cottage for
  their use, candles had been forgotten, and Judith did not desire to ask for
  more than was furnished her, certainly not to go to the Glaze for the things
  needed. They had a fire, but not one that blazed. It was of drift-wood, that
  smouldered and would not flame, and as it burned emitted a peculiar odor.</p>

  <p>Jamie was in good spirits, he chattered and laughed, and Judith made
  pretence that she listened, but her mind was absent, she had cares that had
  demands on every faculty of her mind. Moreover, now and then her thoughts
  drifted off to a picture that busy fancy painted and dangled before
  them&mdash;of Portugal, with its woods of oranges, golden among the burnished
  leaves, and its vines hung with purple grapes&mdash;with its glowing sun, its
  blue glittering sea&mdash;and, above all, she mused on the rest from fears,
  the cessation from troubles which would have ensued, had there been a chance
  for her to accept the offer made, and to have left the Cornish coast for
  ever.</p>

  <p>Looking into the glowing ashes, listening to her thoughts as they spoke,
  and seeming to attend to the prattle of the boy, Judith was surprised by the
  entry of Mr. Scantlebray.</p>

  <p>"There&mdash;disengaged, that is capital," said the agent. "The very thing
  I hoped. And now we can have a talk. You have never understood that I was
  your sincere friend. You have turned from me and looked elsewhere, and now
  you suffer for it. But I am like all the best metal&mdash;strong and bright
  to the last; and see&mdash;I have come to you now to forewarn you, because I
  thought that if it came on you all at once there would be trouble and
  bother."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr. Scantlebray. It is true that we are not busy just now, but
  it does not follow that we are disposed for a talk. It is growing dark, and
  we shall lock up the cottage and go to bed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will not detain you long. Besides I'll take the wish out of your
  heart for bed in one jiffy. Look here&mdash;read this. Do you know the
  handwriting?"</p>

  <p>He held out a letter. Judith reluctantly took it. She had risen; she had
  not asked Scantlebray to take a seat.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "that is the writing of Captain Coppinger."</p>

  <p>"A good bold hand," said the agent, "and see here is his seal with his
  motto, <i>Thorough</i>. You know that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;it is his seal."</p>

  <p>"Now read it."</p>

  <p>Judith knelt at the hearth.</p>

  <p>"Blow, blow the fire up, my beauty," called Scantlebray to Jamie. "Don't
  you see that your sister wants light, and is running the risk of blinding her
  sweet pretty eyes." Jamie puffed vigorously and sent out sparks snapping and
  blinking, and brought the wood to a white glow, by which Judith was able to
  decipher the letter.</p>

  <p>It was a formal order from Cruel Coppinger to Mr. Obadiah Scantlebray to
  remove James Trevisa that evening, after dark, from Othello Cottage to his
  idiot asylum, to remain there in custody till further notice. Judith remained
  kneeling, with her eyes on the letter, after she had read it. She was
  considering. It was clear to her that directly after leaving her Captain
  Coppinger had formed his own resolve, either impatient of waiting the six
  hours he had allowed her, or because he thought the alternative of the Asylum
  the only one that could be accepted by her, and it was one that would content
  himself, as the only one that avoided exposure of a scandal. But there were
  other asylums than that of Scantlebray, and others were presumably better
  managed, and those in charge less severe in their dealings. She had
  considered this, as she looked into the fire. But a new idea had also at the
  same time lightened in her mind, and she had a third alternative to
  propose.</p>

  <p>She had been waiting for the moment when to go to the Glaze and see
  Coppinger, and just at the moment when she was about to send Jamie to bed and
  leave the house Scantlebray came in.</p>

  <p>"Now then," said the agent, "what do you think of me&mdash;that I am a
  real friend?"</p>

  <p>"I thank you for having told me this," answered Judith, "and now I will go
  to Pentyre. I beg that you will not allow my brother to be conveyed away
  during my absence. Wait till I return. Perhaps Captain Coppinger may not
  insist on the removal at once. If you are a real friend, as you profess, you
  will do this for me."</p>

  <p>"I will do it willingly. That I am a real friend I have shown you by my
  conduct. I have come beforehand to break news to you which might have been
  too great and too overwhelming had it come on you suddenly. My brother and a
  man or two will be here in an hour. Go by all means to Captain Cruel, but,"
  Scantlebray winked an eye, "I don't myself think you will prevail with
  him."</p>

  <p>"I will thank you to remain here for half an hour with Jamie," said
  Judith, coldly. "And to stay all proceedings till my return. If I
  succeed&mdash;well. If not, then only a few minutes have been lost. I have
  that to say to Captain Coppinger which may, and I trust will, lead him to
  withdraw that order."</p>

  <p>"Rely on me. I am a rock on which you may build," said Scantlebray. "I
  will do my best to entertain your brother, though, alas! I have not the
  abilities of Obadiah, who is a genius, and can keep folks hour by hour going
  from one roar of laughter into another."</p>

  <p>No sooner was Judith gone than Scantlebray put his tongue into one side of
  his cheek, clicked, pointed over his shoulder with his thumb, and seated
  himself opposite Jamie on the stool beside the fire which had been vacated by
  Judith. Jamie had understood nothing of the conversation that had taken
  place, his name had not been mentioned, and consequently his attention had
  not been drawn to it away from some chestnuts he had found, or which had been
  given to him, that he was baking in the ashes on the hearth.</p>

  <p>"Fond of hunting, eh?" asked Scantlebray, stretching his legs and rubbing
  his hands. "You are like me&mdash;like to be in at the death. What do you
  suppose I have in my pocket? Why, a fox with a fiery tail. Shall we run him
  to earth? Shall we make an end of him? Tally-ho! Tally-ho! here he is. Oh,
  sly Reynard, I have you by the ears." And forth from the tail-pocket of his
  coat Scantlebray produced a bottle of brandy. "What say you, corporal, shall
  we drink his blood? Bring me a couple of glasses and I'll pour out his
  gore."</p>

  <p>"I haven't any," said Jamie. "Ju and I have two mugs, that is all."</p>

  <p>"And they will do famously. Here goes&mdash;off with the mask!" and with a
  blow he knocked away the head and cork of the bottle. "No more running away
  for you, my beauty, except down our throats. Mugs! That is famous. Come,
  shall we play at army and navy, and the forfeit be a drink of Reynard's
  blood?"</p>

  <p>Jamie pricked up his ears; he was always ready for a game of play.</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Scantlebray. "You are in the military, I am in the
  nautical line. Each must address the other by some title in accordance with
  the profession each professes, and the forfeit of failure is a pull at the
  bottle. What do you say! I will begin. Set the bottle there between us. Now
  then, Sergeant, they tell me your aunt has come in for a fortune. How much?
  What is the figure, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," responded Jamie, and was at once caught up with "Forfeit!
  forfeit!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, by Jimminy, there am I, too, in the same box. Take your swig,
  Commander, and pass to me."</p>

  <p>"But what am I to call you?" asked the puzzle-headed boy.</p>

  <p>"Mate, or captain, or boatswain, or admiral."</p>

  <p>"I can't remember all that."</p>

  <p>"Mate will do. Always say mate, whatever you ask or answer. Do you
  understand, General!"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Forfeit! forfeit! You should have said 'Yes, mate.'" Mr. Scantlebray put
  his hands to his sides and laughed. "Oh, Jimminy! there am I again. The
  instructor as bad as the pupil. I'm a bad fellow as instructor, that I am,
  Field-Marshal. So&mdash;your Aunt Dionysia has come in for some thousands of
  pounds&mdash;how many do you think! Have you heard?"</p>

  <p>"I think I've heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mate! Mate!"</p>

  <p>"I think I've heard, Mate."</p>

  <p>"Now, how many do you remember to have heard named? Was it five thousand?
  That is what I heard named&mdash;eh, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, more than that," said Jamie, in his small mind catching at a chance
  of talking-big, "a great lot more than that."</p>

  <p>"What, ten thousand?"</p>

  <p>"I dare say; yes, I think so."</p>

  <p>"Forfeit! forfeit! pull again, Centurion."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mate, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand&mdash;why, at five per cent. that's a nice little sum for
  you and Ju to look forward to when the old hull springs a leak and goes to
  the bottom."</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Jamie, vaguely. He could not look beyond the day, moreover
  he did not understand the figurative speech of his comrade.</p>

  <p>"Forfeit again, General! But I'll forgive you this time, or you'll get so
  drunk you'll not be able to answer me a question. Bless my legs and arms! on
  that pretty little sum one could afford one's self a new tie every Sunday.
  You will prove a beau and buck indeed some day, Captain of Thousands! And
  then you won't live in this little hole. By the way, I hear old Dunes
  Trevisa, I beg pardon, Field-Marshal Sir James, I mean your much respected
  aunt, Miss Trevisa, has got a charming box down by S. Austell. You'll ask me
  down for the shooting, won't you, Commander-in-Chief?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will," answered Jamie.</p>

  <p>"And you'll give me the best bedroom, and will have choice dinners, and
  the best old tawny port, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, to be sure," said the boy, flattered.</p>

  <p>"Mate! mate! forfeit! and I suppose you'll keep a hunter?"</p>

  <p>"I shall have two&mdash;three," said Jamie.</p>

  <p>"And if I were you, I'd keep a pack of fox-hounds."</p>

  <p>"I will."</p>

  <p>"That's for the winter, and other hounds for the summer."</p>

  <p>"I am sure I will, and wear a red coat."</p>

  <p>"Famous! but&mdash;there I spare you this time&mdash;you forfeited
  again."</p>

  <p>"No, I won't be spared," protested the boy.</p>

  <p>"As for a wretched little hole like this Othello Cottage&mdash;&mdash;"
  said Scantlebray. "But, by the bye, you have never shown me over the house.
  How many rooms are there in it, Generalissimo of His Majesty's Forces!"</p>

  <p>"There's my bedroom there," said Jamie.</p>

  <p>"Yes; and that door leads to your sister's?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. And there's the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"And up-stairs!"</p>

  <p>"There's no up-stairs."</p>

  <p>"Now, you are very clever&mdash;clever. By Ginger, you must be to be
  Commander-in-chief; but 'pon my word, I can't believe that. No up-stairs.
  There must be up-stairs."</p>

  <p>"No, there's not."</p>

  <p>"But by Jimminy! with such a roof as this house has got, and a little
  round window in the gable. There must be an up-stairs."</p>

  <p>"No there's not."</p>

  <p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

  <p>"Because there are no stairs at all." Then Jamie jumped up, but rolled on
  one side, the brandy he had drunk had made him unsteady. "I'll show you
  mate&mdash;mate&mdash;yes, mate. There three times now will do for times I
  haven't said it. There&mdash;in my room. The floor is rolling; it won't stay
  steady. There are cramps in the wall, no stairs, and so you get up to where
  it all is."</p>

  <p>"All what is?"</p>

  <p>"Forfeit, forfeit!" shouted Jamie. "Say general or something military. I
  don't know. Ju won't let me go up there; but there's tobacco, for one
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Where's a candle, Corporal?"</p>

  <p>"There is none. We have no light but the fire." Then Jamie dropped back on
  his stool, unable to keep his legs.</p>

  <p>"I am more provident than you. I have a lantern outside, unlighted, as I
  thought I might need it on my return. The nights close in very fast and very
  dark now, eh, Commander?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray went outside the cottage, looked about him, specially
  directing his eyes toward the Glaze. Then he chuckled and said:</p>

  <p>"Sent Miss Judith on a wild goose chase, have I? Ah ha! Captain Coppinger,
  I'll have a little entertainment for you to-night. The preventives will
  snatch your goods at Porth-leze or Constantine, and here&mdash;behind your
  back&mdash;I'll attend to your store of tobacco and whatever else I may
  find."</p>

  <p>Then he returned and going to the fire extracted the candle from the
  lantern and lighted it at a burning log.</p>

  <p>"Halloa, Captain of thousands! Going to sleep? There's the bottle. You
  must make up forfeits. You've been dishonest I fear and not paid half. That
  door did you say?"</p>

  <p>But Jamie was past understanding a question, and Mr. Scantlebray could
  find out for himself now what he wanted to know. That this house had been
  used by Coppinger as a store for some of the smuggled cargoes he had long
  suspected, but he had never been able to obtain any evidence which would
  justify the coast-guard in applying to the justices for a search-warrant. Now
  he would be able to look about it at his leisure, while Judith was absent. He
  did not suppose Coppinger was at the Glaze. He assumed that an attempt would
  be made, as the clerk of St. Enodoc had informed him, to land the cargo of
  the Black Prince to the west of the estuary of the Camel, and he supposed
  that Coppinger would be there to superintend. He had used the letter sent to
  his brother to induce the girl to go to Pentyre, and so leave the cottage
  clear for him to search it.</p>

  <p>Now, holding the candle, he entered the bedroom of Jamie, and soon
  perceived the cramps the boy had spoken of that served in place of stairs.
  Above was a door into the attic, whitewashed over, like the walls. Mr.
  Scantlebray climbed, thrust open the door and crept into the garret.</p>

  <p>"Ah, ha!" said the valuer. "So, so, Captain! I have come on one of your
  lairs at last. And I reckon I will make it warm for you. But, by Ginger, it
  is a pity I can't remove some of what is here."</p>

  <p>He prowled about in the roomy loft, searching every corner. There were a
  few small kegs of spirit, but the stores were mostly of tobacco.</p>

  <p>In about ten minutes Mr. Scantlebray reappeared in the room where was
  Jamie. He was without his candle. The poor boy, overcome by what he had
  drunk, had fallen on the floor and was in a tipsy sleep.</p>

  <p>Scantlebray went to him.</p>

  <p>"Come along with me," he said. "Come, there is no time to be lost. Come,
  you fool!"</p>

  <p>He shook him, but Jamie would not be roused, he kicked and struck out with
  his fists.</p>

  <p>"You won't come? I'll make you."</p>

  <p>Then Scantlebray caught the boy by the shoulders to drag him to the door.
  The child began to struggle and resist.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I'm not concerned for you, fool," said Scantlebray. "If you like to
  stay and take your chance&mdash;my brother will be here to carry you off
  presently. Will you come?"</p>

  <p>Scantlebray caught the boy by the feet and tried to drag him, but Jamie
  clung to the table-legs.</p>

  <p>Scantlebray uttered an oath&mdash;"Stay, you fool, and be smothered! The
  world will get on very well without you."</p>

  <p>And he strode forth from the cottage.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch51"
     name="ch51"></a>LI. &mdash; SURRENDER.</h2>

  <p class="first">Scantlebray was mistaken. Coppinger had not crossed the
  estuary of the Camel. He was at Pentyre Glaze awaiting the time when the tide
  suited for landing the cargo of the Black Prince. In the kitchen were a
  number of men having their supper and drinking, waiting also for the proper
  moment when to issue forth.</p>

  <p>At the turn of the tide the Black Prince would approach in the gathering
  darkness and would come as near in as she dare venture. The wind had fallen,
  but the sea was running, and with the tide setting in she would approach the
  cove.</p>

  <p>Judith hastened toward the Glaze. Darkness had set in, but in the north
  were auroral lights, first a great, white halo, then rays that shot up to the
  zenith, and then a mackerel sky of rosy light. The growl and mutter of the
  sea filled the air with threat like an angry multitude surging on with blood
  and destruction in their hearts.</p>

  <p>The flicker overhead gave Judith light for her cause; the snow had melted
  except in ditches and under hedges, and there it glared red or white in
  response to the changing, luminous tinges of the heavens. When she reached
  the house she at once entered the hall; there Coppinger was awaiting her. He
  knew she would come to him when her mind was made up on the alternatives he
  had offered her, and he believed he knew pretty surely which she would
  choose. It was because he expected her that he had not suffered the men
  collected for the work of the night to invade the hall.</p>

  <p>"You are here," he said. He was seated by the fire; he looked up, but did
  not rise. "Almost too late."</p>

  <p>"Almost, maybe, but not altogether," answered Judith. "And yet it seems
  unnecessary, as you have already acted without awaiting my decision."</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?"</p>

  <p>"I have been shown your letter."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Obadiah Scantlebray is premature."</p>

  <p>"He is not at Othello Cottage yet. His brother came beforehand to prepare
  me."</p>

  <p>"How considerate of your feelings," sneered Captain Cruel. "I would not
  have expected that of Scantlebray."</p>

  <p>"You have not awaited my decision," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"That is true," answered Coppinger, carelessly. "I knew you would shrink
  from the exposure, the disgrace of publication of what has occurred here. I
  knew you so well that I could reckon beforehand on what you would elect."</p>

  <p>"But, why to Scantlebray? Are there not other asylums?"</p>

  <p>"Yes: so long as that boy is placed where he can do no mischief, I care
  not."</p>

  <p>"Then, if that be so, I have another proposal to make."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Coppinger stood up.</p>

  <p>"If you have any regard for my feelings, any care for my happiness, you
  will grant my request."</p>

  <p>"Let me hear it."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Menaida is going to Portugal."</p>

  <p>"What!"&mdash;in a tone of concentrated rage&mdash;"Oliver?"</p>

  <p>"Oliver and his father. But the proposal concerns the father."</p>

  <p>"Go on." Coppinger strode once across the room, then back again. "Go on,"
  he said, savagely.</p>

  <p>"Old Mr. Menaida offers to take Jamie with him. He intends to settle at
  Oporto, near his son, who has been appointed to a good situation there. He
  will gladly undertake the charge of Jamie. Let Jamie go with them. There he
  can do no harm."</p>

  <p>"What, go&mdash;without you! Did they not want you to go, also?"</p>

  <p>Judith hesitated and flushed. There was a single tallow candle on the
  table. Coppinger took it up, snuffed it, and held the flame to her face to
  study its expression. "I thought so," he said, and put down the light
  again.</p>

  <p>"Jamie is useful to Mr. Menaida," pleaded Judith, in some confusion, and
  with a voice of tremulous apology.</p>

  <p>"He stuffs birds so beautifully, and Uncle Zachie&mdash;I mean Mr.
  Menaida&mdash;has set his heart on making a collection of the Spanish and
  Portuguese birds."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; he understands the properties of arsenic," said Coppinger, with
  a scoff.</p>

  <p>Judith's eyes fell. Captain Cruel's tone was not reassuring.</p>

  <p>"You say that you care not where Jamie be, so long as he is where he
  cannot hurt you," said Judith.</p>

  <p>"I did not say that," answered Coppinger. "I said that he must be placed
  where he can injure no one."</p>

  <p>"He can injure no one if he is with Mr. Menaida, who will well watch him,
  and keep him employed."</p>

  <p>Coppinger laughed bitterly. "And you? Will you be satisfied to have the
  idolized brother with the deep seas rolling between you?"</p>

  <p>"I must endure it. It is the least of evils."</p>

  <p>"But you would be pining to have wings and fly over the sea to him."</p>

  <p>"If I have not wings I cannot go."</p>

  <p>"Now hearken," said Coppinger. He clinched his fist and laid it on the
  table. "I know very well what this means. Oliver Menaida is at the bottom of
  this. It is not the fool Jamie who is wanted in Portugal, but the clever
  Judith. They have offered to take the boy, that through him they may attract
  you, unless," his voice thrilled, "they have already dared to propose that
  you should go with them."</p>

  <p>Judith was silent.</p>

  <p>Coppinger clinched his second hand and laid that also on the table. "I
  swear to heaven," said he, "that if I and that Oliver Menaida meet again, it
  is for the last time for one or other of us. We have met twice already. It is
  an understood thing between us, when we meet again, one wets his boots in the
  other's blood. Do you hear? The world will not hold us two any longer.
  Portugal may be far off, but it is too near Cornwall for me."</p>

  <p>Judith made no answer. She looked fixedly into the gloomy eyes of
  Coppinger, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You have strange thoughts. Suppose&mdash;if you will&mdash;that the
  invitation included me, I could not have accepted it."</p>

  <p>"Why not! You refuse to regard yourself as married, and if unmarried, you
  are free&mdash;and if free, ready to elope with&mdash;&mdash;" he would not
  utter the name in his quivering fury.</p>

  <p>"I pray you," said Judith, offended, "do not insult me."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;insult you? It is a daily insult to me to be treated as I have
  been. It is driving me mad."</p>

  <p>"But, do you not see," urged Judith, "you have offered me two alternatives
  and I ask for a third, yours are jail or an asylum, mine is exile. Both yours
  are to me intolerable. Conceive of my state were Jamie either in jail or with
  Mr. Scantlebray. In jail&mdash;and I should be thinking of him all day and
  all night in his prison garb, tramping the tread-mill, beaten, driven on,
  associated with the vilest of men, an indelible stain put, not on him only,
  but on the name of our dear, dear father. Do you think I could bear that? or
  take the other alternative? I know the Scantlebrays. I should have the
  thoughts of Jamie distressed, frightened, solitary, ill-treated, ever before
  me. I had it for a few hours once and it drove me frantic. It would make me
  mad in a week. I know that I could not endure it. Either alternative would
  madden or kill me. And I offer another&mdash;if he were in exile, I could at
  least think of him as happy among the orange groves, in the vineyards, among
  kind friends, happy, innocent&mdash;at worst, forgetting me. <i>That</i> I
  could bear. But the other&mdash;no, not for a week&mdash;they would be
  torture insufferable." She spoke full of feverish vehemence, with her hands
  outspread before her.</p>

  <p>"And this smiling vision of Jamie happy in Portugal would draw your heart
  from me."</p>

  <p>"You never had my heart," said Judith.</p>

  <p>Coppinger clinched his teeth. "I will hear no more of this," said he.</p>

  <p>Then Judith threw herself on her knees, and caught him and held him,
  lifting her entreating face toward his.</p>

  <p>"I have undergone it&mdash;for some hours. I know it will madden or kill
  me. I cannot&mdash;I cannot&mdash;I cannot," she could scarce breathe, she
  spoke in gasps.</p>

  <p>"You cannot what?" he asked, sullenly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot live on the terms you offer. You take from me even the very wish
  to live. Take away the arsenic from me&mdash;lest in madness I give it to
  myself. Take me far inland from these cliffs&mdash;lest in my madness I throw
  myself over&mdash;I could not bear it. Will nothing move you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing." He stood before her, his feet apart, his arms folded, his chin
  on his breast, looking into her uplifted, imploring face. "Yes&mdash;one
  thing. One thing only." He paused, raking her face with his eyes.
  "Yes&mdash;one thing. Be mine wholly&mdash;unconditionally. Then I will
  consent. Be mine; add your name where it is wanting. Resume your
  ring&mdash;and Jamie shall go with the Menaidas. Now, choose."</p>

  <p>He drew back. Judith remained kneeling, upright, on the floor with arms
  extended&mdash;she had heard and at first hardly comprehended him. Then she
  staggered to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Coppinger, "what answer do you make?" Still she could not
  speak. She went to the table with uncertain steps. There was a wooden form by
  it. She seated herself on this, placed her arms on the board, joining her
  hands, and laid her head, face downward, between them on the table.</p>

  <p>Coppinger remained where he was, watching and waiting. He knew what her
  action implied&mdash;that she was to be left alone with her thoughts, to form
  her resolve undisturbed. He remained, accordingly, motionless, but with his
  eyes fixed on the golden hair that flickered in the dim light of the one
  candle. The wick had a great fungus in it&mdash;so large and glaring that in
  another moment it must fall, and fall on Judith's hand. Coppinger saw this
  and he thrust forth his arm to snuff the candle with his fingers, but his
  hand shook, and the light was extinguished. It mattered not. There were
  glowing coals on the hearth, and through the window flared and throbbed the
  auroral lights.</p>

  <p>A step sounded outside. Then a hand was on the door. Coppinger at once
  strode across the hall, and arrested the intruder from entering.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?"</p>

  <p>"Hender Pendarvis"&mdash;the clerk of St. Enodoc. "I have some'ut
  partickler I must say."</p>

  <p>Coppinger looked at Judith; she lay motionless, her head between her arms
  on the board. He partly opened the door and stepped forth into the porch.</p>

  <p>When he had heard what the clerk of St. Enodoc had to say, he answered
  with an order, "Round to the kitchen&mdash;bid the men arm and go by the
  beach."</p>

  <p>He returned into the hall, went to the fireplace and took down a pair of
  pistols, tried them that they were charged, and thrust them into his
  belt.</p>

  <p>Next he went up to Judith, and laid his hand on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Time presses," he said; "I have to be off. Your answer." She looked up.
  The board was studded with drops of water. She had not wept, these stains
  were not her tears, they were the sweat of anguish off her brow that had run
  over the board.</p>

  <p>"Well, Judith, our answer."</p>

  <p>"I accept."</p>

  <p>"Unreservedly?"</p>

  <p>"Unreservedly."</p>

  <p>"Stay," said he. He spoke low, indistinctly articulated sentences. "Let
  there be no holding back between us. You shall know all. You have wondered
  concerning the death of Wyvill&mdash;I know you have asked questions about
  it. I killed him."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>"You heard of the wreckers on that vessel cast on Doom Bar. I was their
  leader."</p>

  <p>Again he paused.</p>

  <p>"You thought I had sent Jamie out with a light to mislead the vessel. You
  thought right. I did have her drawn to her destruction, and by your
  brother."</p>

  <p>He paused again. He saw Judith's hand twitch: that was the only sign of
  emotion in her.</p>

  <p>"And Lady Knighton's jewels. I took them off her&mdash;it was I who tore
  her ear."</p>

  <p>Again a stillness. The sky outside shone in at the window, a lurid red.
  From the kitchen could be heard the voice of a man singing.</p>

  <p>"Now you know all," said Coppinger. "I would not have you take me finally,
  fully, unreservedly without knowing the truth. Give me your resolve."</p>

  <p>She slightly lifted her hands; she looked steadily into his face with a
  stony expression in hers.</p>

  <p>"What is it!"</p>

  <p>"I cannot help myself&mdash;unreservedly yours."</p>

  <p>Then he caught her to him, pressed her to his heart and kissed her wet
  face&mdash;wet as though she had plunged it into the sea.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," said he, "to-morrow shall be our true wedding."</p>

  <p>And he dashed out of the house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch52"
     name="ch52"></a>LII. &mdash; TO JUDITH.</h2>

  <p class="first">In the smugglers' cave were Oliver Menaida and the party of
  Preventive men, not under his charge, but under that of Wyvill. This man,
  though zealous in the execution of his duty, and not averse, should the
  opportunity offer, of paying off a debt in full with a bullet, instead of
  committing his adversary to the more lenient hands of the law, shared in that
  failing, if it were a failing, of being unable to do anything without being
  primed with spirits, a failing that was common at that period, to
  coast-guards and smugglers alike. The latter had to be primed in order to run
  a cargo, and the former must be in like condition to catch them at it. It was
  thought, not unjustly, that the magistrates before whom, if caught, the
  smugglers were brought, needed priming in order to ripen their intellects for
  pronouncing judgment. But it was not often that a capture was effected. When
  it was, priming was allowed for the due solemnization of the fact by the
  captors; failure always entitled them to priming in order to sustain their
  disappointment with fortitude. Wyvill had lost a brother in the cause, and
  his feelings often overcame him when he considered his loss, and their
  poignancy had to be slaked with the usual priming. It served, as its
  advocates alleged, as a great stimulant to courage; but it served also, as
  its deprecators asserted, as a solvent to discipline.</p>

  <p>Now that the party were in possession of the den of their adversaries,
  such a success needed, in their eyes, commemoration. They were likely,
  speedily, to have a tussle with the smugglers, and to prepare themselves for
  that required the priming of their nerves and sinews. They had had a sharp
  struggle with the sea in rounding Pentyre Point, and their unstrung muscles
  and joints demanded screwing up again by the same means.</p>

  <p>The Black Prince had been discerned through the falling darkness drawing
  shoreward with the rising tide; but it was certain that for another hour or
  two the men would have to wait before she dropped anchor, and those ashore
  came down to the unloading.</p>

  <p>A lantern was lighted, and the cave was explored. Certainly Coppinger's
  men from the land would arrive before the boats from the Black Prince, and it
  was determined to at once arrest them, and then await the contingent in the
  boats, and fall on them as they landed. The party was small, it consisted of
  but seven men, and it was advisable to deal with the smugglers piecemeal.</p>

  <p>The men, having leisure, brought out their food, and tapped the keg they
  had procured at the Rock. It was satisfactory to them that the Black Prince
  was apparently bent on discharging the cargo that night and in that place,
  thus they would not have to wait in the cave twenty-four hours, and not,
  after all, be disappointed.</p>

  <p>"All your pistols charged?" asked Wyvill.</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then take your suppers while you may. We shall have hot work presently.
  Should a step be heard below, throw a bit o' sailcloth over the lantern,
  Samson."</p>

  <p>Oliver was neither hungry nor thirsty. He had both eaten and drunk
  sufficient when at the station. He therefore left the men to make their
  collation, prime their spirits, pluck up their courage, screw up their
  nerves, polish their wits, all with the same instrument, and descended the
  slope of shingle, stooped under the brow of rock that divided the lower from
  the upper cave, and made his way to the entrance, and thence out over the
  sands of the cove. He knew that the shore could be reached only by the
  donkey-path, or by the dangerous track down the chimney&mdash;a track he had
  not discovered till he had made a third exploration of the cave. Down this
  tortuous and perilous descent he was convinced the smugglers would not come.
  It was, he saw, but rarely used, and designed as a way of escape only on an
  emergency. A too-frequent employment of this path would have led to a
  treading of the turf on the cliff above, and to a marking of the line of
  descent, that would have attracted the attention of the curious, and revealed
  to the explorer the place of retreat.</p>

  <p>Oliver, therefore, went forward toward the point where the donkey-path
  reached the sands, deeming it advisable that a watch should be kept on this
  point, so that his party might be forewarned in time of the approach of the
  smugglers.</p>

  <p>There was much light in the sky, a fantastic, mysterious glow, as though
  some great conflagration were taking place and the clouds over head reflected
  its flicker.</p>

  <p>There passed throbs of shadow from side to side, and as Oliver looked he
  could almost believe that the light he saw proceeded from a great bonfire,
  such as was kindled on the Cornish Moors on Midsummer's Eve, and that the
  shadows were produced by men and women dancing round the flames and
  momentarily intercepting the light.</p>

  <p>Then ensued a change. The rose hue vanished suddenly, and in its place
  shot up three broad ribbons of silver light; and so bright and clear was the
  light that the edge of the cliff against it was cut as sharp as a black
  silhouette on white paper, and he could see every bush of gorse there, and a
  sheep&mdash;a solitary sheep.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he was startled by seeing a man before him, coming over the
  sand.</p>

  <p>"Who goes there?"</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;Oliver! I have found you!" the answer was in his father's
  voice. "Oh, well, I got fidgeted, and I thought I would come and see if you
  had arrived."</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake, you have told no one of our plans?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;bless you, boy&mdash;not I. You know you told me yourself, before
  going to the station, what you intended, and I was troubled and anxious, and
  I came to see how things were turning out. The Black Prince is coming in; she
  will anchor shortly. She can't come beyond the point yonder. I was sure you
  would be here. How many have you brought with you?"</p>

  <p>"But six."</p>

  <p>"Too few. However, now I am with you, that makes eight."</p>

  <p>"I wish you had not come, father."</p>

  <p>"My boy, I did not come only on your account. I have my poor little Ju so
  near my heart that I long to put out if only a finger to liberate her from
  that ruffian, whom by the way I have challenged."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but I have stepped in as your substitute. I shall, I trust, try
  conclusions with Coppinger to-night. Come with me to the cave I told you of.
  We will send a man to keep guard at the foot of the donkey path."</p>

  <p>Oliver led the way; the sands reflected the illumination of the sky, and
  the foam that swept up the beach had a rosy tinge. The waves hissed as they
  rushed up the shore, as though impatient at men speaking and not listening to
  the voice of the ocean, that should subdue all human tongues, and command
  mute attention. And yet that roar is inarticulate, it is like the foaming
  fury of the dumb, that strives with noise and gesticulation to explain the
  thoughts that are working within.</p>

  <p>In the cave it was dark, and Oliver lighted a piece of touchwood as a
  means of observing the shelving ground, and taking his direction, till he
  passed under the brow of rock and entered the upper cavern.</p>

  <p>After a short scramble, the dim yellow glow of light from this inner
  recess was visible, when Oliver extinguished his touchwood and pushed on,
  guided by this light.</p>

  <p>On entering the upper cave he was surprised to find the guards lying about
  asleep, and snoring. He went at once to Wyvill, seized him by the arm and
  shook him, but none of his efforts could rouse him. He lay as a log, or as
  one stunned.</p>

  <p>"Father! help me with the others," said Oliver in great concern.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida went from one to the other, spoke to each, shook him, held the
  lantern to his eyes; he raised their heads; when he let go his hold, they
  fell back.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" asked Oliver.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said old Menaida, "I'll tell you what this means. There is a
  rogue among them, and their drink has been drugged with deadly night-shade.
  You might be sure of this&mdash;that among six coast-guards one would be in
  the pay of Coppinger. Which is it? Whoever it is, he is pretending to be as
  dead drunk and stupefied as the others, and which is the man, Noll?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell. This keg of brandy was got at the Rock Inn."</p>

  <p>"It was got there and there drugged, but by one of this company. Who is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Oliver, waxing wrathful, "and what is more, notice was sent to
  Coppinger to be on his guard. I saw the sexton going in the direction of
  Pentyre."</p>

  <p>"That man is a rascal."</p>

  <p>"And now we shall not encounter Coppinger. He will be warned and not
  come."</p>

  <p>"Trust him to come. He has heard of this. He will come and murder them all
  as he did Wyvill."</p>

  <p>Oliver felt as though a frost had fallen on him.</p>

  <p>"Hah!" said old Menaida. "Never trust anyone in this neighborhood; you
  cannot tell who is not in the pay or under the control of Coppinger, from the
  magistrate on the bench to the huckster who goes round the country. Among
  these six men, one is a spy and a traitor. Which it is we cannot tell. There
  is nothing else to be done but to bind them all, hand and foot. There is
  plenty of cord here."</p>

  <p>"Plenty. But surely not Wyvill."</p>

  <p>"Wyvill and all. How can you say that he is not the man who has done it?
  Many a fellow has carried his brother in his pocket. What if he has been
  bought?"</p>

  <p>Old Menaida was right. He had not lived so many years in the midst of
  smugglers without having learned something of their ways. His advice must be
  taken, for the danger was imminent. If, as he supposed, full information had
  been sent to Captain Cruel, then he and his men would be upon them
  shortly.</p>

  <p>Oliver hastily brought together all the cord of a suitable thickness he
  could find, and the old father raised and held each Preventive man, while
  Oliver firmly bound him hand and foot. As he did not know which was shamming
  sleep, he must bind all. Of the six, five were wholly unconscious what was
  being done to them, and the sixth thought it advisable to pretend to be as
  the rest, for he was quite aware that neither Oliver nor his father would
  scruple to silence him effectually did he show signs of animation.</p>

  <p>When all were made fast, old Mr. Menaida said:</p>

  <p>"Now, Noll, my boy, are you armed?"</p>

  <p>"No, father. When I went from home I expected to return. I did not know I
  should want weapons. But these fellows have their pistols and cutlasses."</p>

  <p>"Try the pistols. There, take that of the man Wyvill. Are you sure they
  are loaded?"</p>

  <p>"I know they are."</p>

  <p>"Well, try."</p>

  <p>Oliver took Wyvill's pistol, and put in the ramrod.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, it is loaded."</p>

  <p>"Make sure. Draw the loading. You don't know what it is to have to do with
  Coppinger."</p>

  <p>Oliver drew the charge, and then, as is usual, when the powder has been
  removed, blew down the barrel. Then he observed that there was a choke
  somewhere. He took the pistol to the lantern, opened the side of the lantern
  and examined it. The touch-hole was plugged with wax.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Mr. Menaida. "The man who drugged the liquor waxed the
  touch-holes of the pistols. Try the rest."</p>

  <p>Oliver did not now trouble himself to draw the charges; he cocked each
  man's pistol and drew the trigger. Not one would discharge. All had been
  treated in like manner.</p>

  <p>Oliver thought for a moment what was to be done. He dared not leave the
  sleeping men unprotected, and he and his father alone were insufficient to
  defend them.</p>

  <p>"Father," said he, "there is but one thing that can be done now: you must
  go at once, fly to the nearest farmhouses and collect men, and, if possible,
  hold the donkey path before Coppinger and his men arrive. If you are too
  late, pursue them. I will choke the narrow entrance, and will light a fire.
  Perhaps they may be afraid when they see a blaze here, and may hold off.
  Anyhow, I can defend this place for a while. But I don't expect that they
  will attack it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida at once saw that his son's judgment was right, and he hurried
  out of the cave, Oliver holding the light to assist him to descend, and then
  he made his way over the sands to the path, and up that to the downs.</p>

  <p>No sooner was he gone than Oliver collected what wood and straw were
  there, sailcloth, oilcloth, everything that was combustible, and piled them
  up into a heap, then applied the candle to them, and produced a flame. The
  wood was damp and did not burn freely, but he was able to awake a good fire
  that filled the cavern with light. He trusted that when the smugglers saw
  that their den was in the possession of the enemy they would not risk the
  attempt to enter and recover it. They might not, they probably did not, know
  to what condition the holders of the cave were reduced.</p>

  <p>The light of the fire roused countless bats that had made the roof of the
  cave their resting-place, and they flew wildly to and fro with whirr of wings
  and shrill screams.</p>

  <p>Oliver set to work with all haste to heap stones so as to choke the
  entrance from the lower cave, by which he anticipated that the smugglers
  would enter, should they resolve on so desperate a course. But owing to the
  rapid inclination, the pebbles yielded, and what he piled up rolled down. He
  then, with great effort, got the boat thrust down to the opening, and by main
  force drew it partly across. It was not possible for him completely to block
  the entrance, but by planting the boat athwart it, he could prevent several
  men from entering at once, and whoever did enter must scramble over the
  bulwarks of the boat.</p>

  <p>All this took some time, and he was thus engaged, when his attention was
  suddenly arrested by the click of a pistol brought to the cock. He looked
  hastily about him, and saw Coppinger, who, unobserved, had descended by the
  chimney, and now by the light of the fire was taking deliberate aim at him.
  Oliver drew back behind a rock.</p>

  <p>"You coward!" shouted Captain Cruel. "Come out and be shot."</p>

  <p>"I am no coward," answered Oliver. "Let us meet with equal arms. I have a
  cutlass." He had taken one from the side of a sleep-drunk coast-guard.</p>

  <p>"I prefer to shoot you down as a dog," said Coppinger.</p>

  <p>Then holding his pistol levelled in the direction of Oliver, he approached
  the sleeping men. Oliver saw at once his object: he would liberate the
  confederate. He stepped out from behind the rock, and immediately the pistol
  was discharged. A bat fell at the feet of Oliver. Had not that bat at the
  moment whizzed past his head and received the ball in its soft and yielding
  body, the young man would have fallen shot through his head.</p>

  <p>Coppinger uttered a curse, and put his hand to his belt and drew forth his
  second pistol. But Oliver sprang forward, and with a sweep of his cutlass
  caught him on the wrist with the blade as he was about to touch the trigger.
  The pistol fell from his hand, and a rush of blood overflowed the back of the
  hand.</p>

  <p>Coppinger remained for one minute motionless. So did Oliver, who did not
  again raise his cutlass.</p>

  <p>But at that moment a harsh voice was heard crying, "There he is, my men,
  at him; beat his brains out. A guinea for the first man who knocks him over,"
  and from the further side of the boat, illumined by the glare from the fire,
  were seen the faces of Mr. Scantlebray, his brother, and several men, who
  began to scramble over the obstruction.</p>

  <p>Then, and then only in his life, did Coppinger's heart fail him. His right
  hand was powerless; the sharp blade had severed the tendons, and blood was
  flowing from his wrist in streams. One pistol was discharged, the other had
  fallen. In a minute he would be in the hands of his deadly enemies.</p>

  <p>He turned and fled. The light from the fire, the illumined smoke, rose
  through the chimney, and by that he could run up the familiar track, reach
  the platform in the face of the cliff, thence make his way by the path up
  which he had formerly borne Judith. He did not hesitate, he fled, and Oliver,
  also without hesitation, pursued him. As he went up the narrow track, his
  feet trod in and were stained with the blood that had fallen from Coppinger's
  wounded arm, but he did not notice it&mdash;he was unaware of it till the
  morrow.</p>

  <p>Coppinger reached the summit of the cliffs. His feet were on the down. He
  ran at once in the direction of Othello Cottage. His only chance of safety
  lay there. There he could hide in the attic, and Judith would never betray
  him. In his desperate condition, wounded, his blood flowing from him in
  streams, hunted by his foes, that one thought was in
  him&mdash;Judith&mdash;he must go to Judith. She would never betray him, she
  would be hacked to death rather than give him up. To Judith as his last
  refuge!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch53"
     name="ch53"></a>LIII. &mdash; IN THE SMOKE.</h2>

  <p class="first">Judith left Pentyre Glaze when she had somewhat recovered
  herself after the interview with Coppinger and her surrender. She had fought
  a brave battle, but had been defeated and must lay down her arms. Resistance
  was no longer possible if Jamie was to be saved from a miserable fate. Now by
  the sacrifice of herself she had assured to, him a future of calm and
  innocent happiness. She knew that with Uncle Zachie and Oliver he would be
  cared for, kindly treated, and employed. Uncle Zachie himself was not to be
  trusted; whatever he might promise, his good nature was greater than his
  judgment. But she had confidence in Oliver, who would prove a check on the
  over-indulgence which his father would allow. But Jamie would forget her. His
  light and unretentive mind was not one to harbor deep feeling. He would
  forget her when on board ship in his pleasure at running about the vessel
  chattering with the sailors, and would only think of her if he wanted aught
  or was ill. Rapidly the recollection of her, love for her, would die out of
  his mind and heart; and as it died out of his, her thought and love for him
  would deepen and become more fixed, for she would have no one, nothing in the
  world to think of and love save her twin-brother.</p>

  <p>She walked on in the dark winter night, lighted only by the auroral glow
  overhead, and was conscious of a smell of tobacco-smoke that so persistently
  seemed to follow her that she was forced to notice it. She became uneasy,
  thinking that someone was walking behind the hedge with a pipe, watching her,
  perhaps waiting to spring out upon her when distant from the house, where her
  cries for help might not be heard.</p>

  <p>She stood still. The smell was strong. She climbed the hedge on one side
  and looked over; as far as she could discern in the red glimmer from the
  flushed sky there was no one there. She listened, she could hear no step. She
  walked hastily on to a gate in the hedge on the opposite side and went
  through that. The smell of burning tobacco was as strong there. Judith turned
  in the lane and walked back in the direction of the house. The smell pursued
  her. It was strange. Could she carry the odor in her clothes? She turned
  again and resumed her walk toward Othello Cottage. Now she was distinctly
  aware that the scent came to her on the wind. Her perplexity on this subject
  served as a diversion of her mind from her own troubles.</p>

  <p>She emerged upon the downs, and made her way across them toward the
  cottage that lay in a dip, not to be observed except by one close to it. The
  wind when it brushed up from the sea was odorless.</p>

  <p>Presently she came in sight of Othello Cottage, and in spite of the
  darkness could see that a strange, dense, white fog surrounded it, especially
  the roof, which seemed to be wearing a white wig. In a moment she understood
  what this signified. Othello Cottage was on fire, and the stores of tobacco
  in the attic were burning. Judith ran. Her own troubles were forgotten in her
  alarm for Jamie. No fire as yet had broken through the roof.</p>

  <p>She reached the door, which was open. Mr. Scantlebray in leaving had not
  shut the door, so as to allow the boy to crawl out should he recover
  sufficient intelligence to see that he was in danger.</p>

  <p>It is probable that Scantlebray, senior, would have made further efforts
  to save Jamie, but that he believed he would meet with his brother, and two
  or three men he was bringing with him, near the house, and then it would be
  easy unitedly to drag the boy forth. He did, indeed, meet with Obadiah, but
  also at the same time with Uncle Zachie Menaida and a small party of
  farm-laborers, and when he heard that Mr. Menaida desired help to secure
  Coppinger and the smugglers, he thought no more of the boy and joined
  heartily in the attempt to rescue the Preventive men and take Coppinger.</p>

  <p>Through the open door dashed Judith, crying out to Jamie whom she could
  not see. There was a dense, white cloud in the room, let down from above, and
  curling out at the top of the door, whence it issued as steam from a boiler.
  It was impossible to breathe in this fog of tobacco-smoke, and Judith knew
  that if she allowed it to surround her she would be stupefied. She therefore
  stooped and entered, calling Jamie. Although the thick mattress of white
  smoke had not as yet descended to the floor, and had left comparatively clear
  air beneath it&mdash;the in-draught from the door&mdash;yet the odor of the
  burning tobacco impregnated the atmosphere. Here and there curls of smoke
  descended, dropped capriciously from the bed of vapor above, and wantonly
  played about.</p>

  <p>Judith saw her brother lying at full length near the fire. Scantlebray had
  drawn him partly to the door, but he had rolled back to his former position
  near the hearth, perhaps from feeling the cold wind that blew in on him.</p>

  <p>There was no time to be lost. Judith knew that flame must burst forth
  directly&mdash;directly the burning tobacco had charred through the rafters
  and flooring of the attic and allowed the fresh air from below to rush in
  and, acting as a bellows, blow the whole mass of glowing tobacco into flame.
  It was obvious that the fire had originated above in the attic. There was
  nothing burning in the room, and the smoke drove downward in strips through
  the joints of the boards overhead.</p>

  <p>"Jamie, come, come with me!" She shook the boy, she knelt by him and
  raised him on her knee. He was stupefied with cognac, and with the fumes of
  the burning tobacco he had inhaled.</p>

  <p>She must drag him forth. He was no longer half-conscious as he had been
  when Mr. Scantlebray made the same attempt; the power to resist was now gone
  from him.</p>

  <p>Judith was delicately made, and was not strong, but she put her arms under
  the shoulders of Jamie and herself on her knees and dragged him along the
  floor. He was as heavy as a corpse. She drew him a little way and desisted,
  overcome, panting, giddy, faint. But time must not be lost. Every moment was
  precious. Judith knew that overhead in the loft was something that would not
  smoulder and glow, but burst into furious flame&mdash;spirits. Not, indeed,
  many kegs, but there were some. When this became ignited their escape would
  be impossible. She drew Jamie further up; she was behind him. She thrust him
  forward as she moved on upon her knees, driving him a step further at every
  advance. It was slow and laborious work. She could not maintain this effort
  for long and fell forward on her hands, and he fell also at the same time on
  the floor.</p>

  <p>Then she heard a sound, a roar, an angry growl. The shock of the fall, and
  striking his head against the slate pavement, roused Jamie momentarily and he
  also heard the noise.</p>

  <p>"Ju! the roar of the sea!"</p>

  <p>"A sea of fire, Jamie! Oh, do push to the door."</p>

  <p>He raised himself on his hands, looked vacantly round, and fell again into
  stupid unconsciousness. Now still on her knees, but with a brain becoming
  bewildered with the fumes, she crept to his head, placed herself between him
  and the door, and holding his shoulders, dragged him toward her, she moving
  backward.</p>

  <p>Even thus she could make but little way with him; his boot-tops caught in
  the edge of a slate slab ill fitted in the floor and held him, so that she
  could not pull him to her with the additional resistance thus caused. Then an
  idea struck her. Staggering to her feet, holding her breath, she plunged in
  the direction of the window, beat it open, and panted in the inrush of pure
  air. With this new current wafted in behind her she returned amid the smoke,
  and for a moment it dissipated the density of the cloud about her. The window
  had faced the wind, and the rush of air through it was more strong than that
  which entered by the door. And yet this expedient did not answer as she had
  expected, for the column of strong, cold air pouring in from a higher level
  threw the cloud into confusion, stirred it up as it were, and lessened the
  space of uninvaded atmosphere below the descending bed of vapor.</p>

  <p>Again she went to Jamie. The roar overhead had increased, some vent had
  been found, and the attic was in full flagrance. Now, drawing a long breath
  at the door, near the level of the ground, she returned to her brother and
  disengaged his foot from the slate, then dragged, then thrust, sometimes at
  his head, sometimes at his side; then again she had her arms round him, and
  swung herself forward to the right knee sideways; then brought up the other
  knee, and swung herself with the dead weight in her arms again to the right,
  and thus was able to work her way nearer to the door, and, as she got nearer
  to the door, the air was clearer, and she was able to breathe freer.</p>

  <p>At length she laid hold of the jamb with one hand, and with the other she
  caught the lappel of the boy's coat, and assisted by the support she had
  gained, was able to drag him over the doorstep.</p>

  <p>At that moment passed her rushed a man. She looked, saw and knew
  Coppinger. As he rushed passed, the blood squirting from his maimed right
  hand fell on the girl lying prostrate at the jamb to which she had clung.</p>

  <p>And now within a red light appeared, glowing through the mist as a fiery
  eye, not only so, but every now and then a fiery rain descended. The burning
  tobacco had consumed the boards and was falling through in red masses.</p>

  <p>Judith had but just brought her brother into safety, or comparative
  safety, and now another, Coppinger, had plunged into the burning cottage,
  rushed to almost certain death. She cried to him as well as she could with
  her short breath. She could not leave him within. Why had he run there? She
  saw on her dress the blood that had fallen from him. She went outside the hut
  and dragged Jamie forth and laid him on the grass. Then, without hesitation,
  inhaling all the pure air she could, she darted once more into the burning
  cottage. Her eyes were stung with the smoke, but she pushed on, and found
  Coppinger under the open window, fallen on the floor, his back and head
  against the wall, his arms at his side, and the blood streaming over the
  slate pavement from his right gashed wrist. Accident or instinct&mdash;it
  could not have been judgment&mdash;had carried him to the only spot in the
  room where pure air was to be found, and there it descended like a rushing
  waterfall, blowing about the prostrate man's wild long hair.</p>

  <p>"Judith!" said he, looking at her, and he raised his left hand. "Judith,
  this is the end."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Captain Coppinger, do come out. The house is burning. Quick, or it
  will be too late."</p>

  <p>"It is too late for me," he said. "I am wounded." He held up his
  half-severed hand. "I gave this to you and you rejected it."</p>

  <p>"Come&mdash;oh, do come&mdash;or you and I will be burnt." In the
  inrushing sweep of air both were clear of the smoke and could breathe.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I am followed. I will not be taken. I am no good
  now&mdash;without my right hand. I will not go to jail."</p>

  <p>She caught his arm, and tearing the kerchief from her neck, bound it round
  and round where the veins were severed.</p>

  <p>"It is in vain," he said. "I have lost most of my blood. Ju!"&mdash;he
  held her with his left hand&mdash;"Ju, if you live, swear to me, swear you
  will sign the register."</p>

  <p>She was looking into his face&mdash;it was ghastly, partly through loss of
  blood, partly because lighted by the glare of the burning tobacco that
  dropped from above. Then a sense of vast pity came surging over her along
  with the thought of how he had loved her. Into her burning eyes tears
  came.</p>

  <p>"Judith!" he said, "I made my confession to you&mdash;I told you my sins.
  Give me also my release. Say you forgive me."</p>

  <p>She had forgotten her peril, forgotten about the fire that was above and
  around, as she looked at his eyes, and, holding the maimed right arm, felt
  the hot blood welling through her kerchief and running over her hand.</p>

  <p>"I pray you, oh, I pray you, come outside. There is still time."</p>

  <p>Again he shook his head. "My time is up. I do not want to live. I have not
  your love. I could never win it, and if I went outside I should be captured
  and sent to prison. Will you give me my absolution?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" And in her trembling concern for him&mdash;in the
  intensity of her pity, sorrow, care for him&mdash;she drew his wounded hand
  to her and pressed it against her heaving bosom.</p>

  <p>"What I mean is, can you forgive me?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed&mdash;indeed I do."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;all I have done?"</p>

  <p>"All."</p>

  <p>She saw only a dying man before her, a man who might be saved if he would,
  but would not because her love was everything to him, and <i>that</i> he
  never, never could gain. Would she make no concession to him? could she not
  draw a few steps nearer? As she looked into his face and held his bleeding
  arm to her bosom, pity overpowered her&mdash;pity, when she saw how strong
  had been this wild and wicked man's love. Now she truly realized its depth,
  its intensity, and its tenderness alternating with stormy blasts of passion,
  as he wavered between hope and fear, and the despair that was his when he
  knew he must lose her.</p>

  <p>Then she stooped, and, the tears streaming over her face, she kissed him
  on his brow, and then on his lips, and then drew back, still holding his
  maimed hand, with both of hers crossed over it, to her heaving bosom.
  Kneeling, she had her eyes on his, and his were on hers&mdash;steady,
  searching, but with a gentle light in them. And as she thus looked she became
  unconscious, and sank, still holding his hand, on the floor.</p>

  <p>At that instant, through the smoke and raining masses of burning tobacco,
  plunged Oliver Menaida. He saw Judith, bent, caught her in his arms, and
  rushed back through the door.</p>

  <p>A moment after and he was at the entrance again, to plunge through and
  rescue his wounded adversary; but the moment when this could be done was
  past. There was an explosion above, followed by a fall as of a sheet of blue
  light, a curtain of fire through the mist of white smoke. No living man could
  pass that. Oliver went round to the window, and strove to enter by that way;
  the man who had taken refuge there was still in the same position, but he had
  torn the kerchief of Judith from the bleeding arm, and he held it to his
  mouth, looking with fixed eyes into the falling red and blue fires and the
  swirling flocks of white smoke.</p>

  <p>There were iron bars at the window. Oliver tore at these to displace
  them.</p>

  <p>"Coppinger!" he shouted, "stand up&mdash;help me to break these bars!"</p>

  <p>But Coppinger would not move, or, possibly, the power was gone from him.
  The bars were firmly set. They had been placed in the windows by Coppinger's
  orders and under his own supervision, to secure Othello Cottage, his
  store-place, against invasion by the inquisitive.</p>

  <p>At length Oliver succeeded in wrenching one bar away, and now a gap was
  made through which he might reach Coppinger and draw him forth through the
  window. He was scrambling in when the Captain staggered to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Let me alone," said he. "You have won what I have lost. Let me alone. I
  am defeated."</p>

  <p>Then he stepped into the mass of smoke and falling liquid blue fire and
  dropping masses of red glowing tobacco. A moment more, and the whole of the
  attic floor, with all the burning contents of the garret, fell in.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch54"
     name="ch54"></a>LIV. &mdash; SQUAB PIE.</h2>

  <p class="first">Next morning, at an early hour, Judith, attended by Mr.
  Zachary Menaida, appeared at the rectory of St. Enodoc. She was deadly pale,
  but there was decision in her face. She asked to see Mr. Desiderius Mules in
  his study, and was shown into what had, in her father's days, been the
  pantry.</p>

  <p>Mr. Menaida had a puzzled look in his watery eyes. He had been up all
  night, and indeed it had been a night in which few in the neighborhood had
  slept, excepting Mr. Mules, who knew nothing of what had happened. The
  smugglers, alarmed by the fire at Othello Cottage, and by the party collected
  by Mr. Menaida to guard the descent to the beach, had not ventured to force
  their way to the cave. The Black Prince, finding that no signal was made from
  the ledge above the cave, suspected mischief, heaved anchor and bore away.
  The stupefied members of the Preventive service were conveyed to the nearest
  cottages, and there left to recover. As for Othello Cottage, it was a blazing
  and smoking mass of fire, and till late on the following day could not be
  searched. There was no fire-engine anywhere near; nor would a fire-engine
  have availed to save either the building or its contents.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Mules appeared, Judith said in a quiet but firm tone, "I have
  come to sign the register. Mr. Menaida is here. I do it willingly, and with
  no constraint."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. This is most considerate to my feelings. I wish all my flock
  would obey my advice as you are now doing," said the rector, and produced the
  book, which Judith signed with trembling hand.</p>

  <p>Mr. Desiderius was quite ignorant of the events of the night. He had no
  idea that at that time Captain Coppinger was dead.</p>

  <p>It was not till some days later that Judith understood why, at the last
  moment, with death before his eyes, Coppinger had urged on her this
  ratification of her marriage. It was not till his will was found, that she
  understood his meaning. He had left to her, as his wife, everything that he
  possessed. No one knew of any relatives that he had, for no one knew whence
  he came. No one ever appeared to put in a claim against the widow.</p>

  <p>On the second day the remains of the burnt cottage were cleared away, and
  then the body of Cruel Coppinger was found, fearfully charred, and disfigured
  past recognition. There were but two persons who knew that this blackened
  corpse belonged to the long dreaded captain, and these were Judith and
  Oliver. When the burnt body was cleared from the charred fragments of
  clothing that were about it one article was discovered uninjured. About his
  throat Coppinger had worn a silk handkerchief, and this as well as the collar
  of his coat had preserved his neck and the upper portion of his chest from
  injury such as had befallen the rest of his person. And when the burnt
  kerchief was removed, and the singed cloth of the coat-collar, there was
  discovered round the throat a narrow black band, and sewn into this band, one
  golden thread of hair, encircling the neck.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Are our readers acquainted with that local delicacy entitled, in Cornwall
  and Devon, Squab Pie? To enlighten the ignorant, it shall be described.
  First, however, we premise that of squab pies there are two sorts: Devonian
  squab and Cornish squab. The Cornish squab differs from the Devonian squab in
  one particular; that shall be specified presently.</p>

  <p><i>How to Make a Squab Pie.</i>&mdash;Take half a pound of veal, cut into
  nice square pieces, and put a layer of them at the bottom of a pie-dish.
  Sprinkle over these a portion of herbs, spices, seasoning, lemon-peel, and
  the yolks of eggs cut in slices; cut a quarter of a pound of boiled ham very
  thin, and put in a layer of this. Take half a pound of mutton cut into nice
  pieces, and put a layer of them on the top of the veal. Sprinkle as before
  with herbs and spices. Take half a pound of beef, cut into nice pieces, and
  put a layer of them on top of the mutton. Sprinkle as before with herbs and
  spices. Cut up half a dozen apples very fine, also half a dozen onions, mix,
  and proceed to ram the onions and apples into every perceivable crevice. Take
  half a dozen pilchards, remove the bones, chop up and strew the whole pie
  with pilchards. Then fill up with clotted cream, till the pie-dish will hold
  no more. (For Cornish squab add, treated in like manner, a cormorant.)
  Proceed to lay a puff paste on the edge of the dish. Then insert a tablespoon
  and stir the contents, till your arm aches. Cover with crust or ornament it
  with leaves, brush it over with the yolk of an egg, and bake in a well-heated
  oven for one or one and a half hour, or longer, should the pie be very large
  (two in the case of a Cornish squab, and the cormorant very tough).</p>

  <p>In one word, a squab pie is a scrap pie. So is the final chapter of a
  three-volume novel. It is made up, from the first word to the last, of scraps
  of all kinds, toothsome and the reverse.</p>

  <p>Now let the reader observe&mdash;he has been already supplied with scraps.
  He has learned the result of Mr. Menaida's collecting men to assist him
  against the smugglers. Also of his expedition along with Judith to the
  rectory of St. Enodoc. Also he has heard the provisions of Captain
  Coppinger's will; also that this will was not contested. He has also heard of
  the recovery of the Captain's body from the burnt cottage.</p>

  <p>Is not this a collection of scraps cut very small? But there are more, of
  a different character, with which this chapter will be made up, before the
  pie-crust closes over it with a flourishing "Finis" to ornament it.</p>

  <p>Mr. Scantlebray had lost his wife, who had been an ailing woman for some
  years, and being a widower, cast about his eyes for a second wife, after the
  way of widowers. There was not the excuse of a young family needing a prudent
  housewife to manage the children, for Mr. Scantlebray had only one daughter,
  who had been allotted by her father and by popular opinion to Captain
  Coppinger, but had failed to secure him. Mr. Scantlebray, though an active
  man, had not amassed much money, and if he could add to his comforts, provide
  himself with good eating and good drinking, by marrying a woman with money,
  he was not averse to so doing. Now, Mr. Scantlebray had lent a ready ear to
  the voice of rumor which made Miss Dionysia Trevisa the heiress who had come
  in for all the leavings of that rich old spinster, Miss Ceely, of St.
  Austell, and Mr. Scantlebray gave credit to this rumor, and acting on it,
  proposed to and was accepted by Miss Dionysia.</p>

  <p>Now when, after marriage, Mr. Scantlebray found out that the sweet
  creature he had taken to his side was worth under a quarter of the sum he had
  set down at the lowest figure, at which he could endure her, and when the
  late Miss Trevisa, now the second Mrs. Scantlebray, learned from her
  husband's lips that he had married her only for her money, and not for her
  good looks or for any good quality she was supposed to be endowed with, the
  reader, knowing something of the characters of these two persons, may
  conjecture, if he please, what sort of scenes ensued daily between them, and
  it may be safely asserted that the bitterest enemies of either could not have
  desired for each a more unenviable lot than was theirs.</p>

  <p>Very shortly after the death of Captain Coppinger, Judith and Jamie left
  Bristol in a vessel, with Uncle Zachie, bound for Lisbon. Oliver Menaida had
  gone to Oporto before, to make arrangements for his father. It was settled
  that Judith and her brother should live with the old man, and that the girl
  should keep house for him. Oliver would occupy his old quarters, that
  belonged to the firm in which he was a partner.</p>

  <p>It is a strange thing&mdash;but after the loss of Coppinger Judith's mind
  reverted much to him, she thought long and tenderly of his considerations for
  her, his patience with her, his forbearance, his gentleness toward her, and
  of his intense and enduring love. His violence she forgot, and she put down
  the crimes he had committed to evil association, or to an irregulated,
  undisciplined conscience, excusable in a measure in one who had not the
  advantages she had enjoyed, of growing up under the eye of a blameless,
  honorable, and right-minded father.</p>

  <p>In the Consistory Court of Canterbury is a book of the marriages performed
  at the Oporto factory, by the English chaplain resident there. It begins in
  the year 1788 and ends in 1807. The author has searched this volume in vain
  for a marriage between Oliver Menaida and Judith Coppinger. If such a
  marriage did take place, it must have been after 1807, but the book of
  register of marriages later than this date is not to be found in the
  Consistory Court.</p>

  <p>Were they married?</p>

  <p>On inquiry at St. Enodoc no information has been obtained, for neither
  Judith nor the Menaidas had any relatives there with whom they communicated.
  If Mrs. Scantlebray ever heard, she said nothing, or, at all events, nothing
  she said concerning them has been remembered.</p>

  <p>Were they ever married?</p>

  <p>That question the reader must decide as he likes.</p>
