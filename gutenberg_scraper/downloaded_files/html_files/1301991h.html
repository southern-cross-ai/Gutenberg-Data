<h2>EARLY HISTORY OF VICTORIA.</h2>
<hr class="2">
<a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4>FIRST PERMANENT SETTLEMENT.</h4>
<p class="negindent">Timidity of Governments about formation of
new settlements&mdash;Governor Bourke's despatch about one
projected at Twofold Bay&mdash;Lord Aberdeen adverse&mdash;The
First Founders of Victoria&mdash;The Hentys&mdash;Circumstances
leading to their settlement at Portland Bay&mdash;Their
application for land there&mdash;Governor Arthur favours
formation of settlement&mdash;Claims of the Hentys&mdash;Their
correspondence on the subject with the Government&mdash;Final
adjustment&mdash;Proposed removal of Tasmanian Blacks to
Portland.</p>
<p>E<small>XPLORATION</small> had now done its work. The long
unknown region of Victoria had been crossed and re-crossed from
end to end; Hume and Hovell had almost intersected the territory;
Major Mitchell had struck through it from the North to its
South-western extremity, and had then pursued a route which
brought him out at its North-eastern boundary. He was more than
able to confirm Hume and Hovell's favourable judgment of the
country, and to dispel every vestige of lingering doubt, which
previous condemnatory expressions and statements had raised and
so long sustained. The judgment of Oxley and the prediction of
Tuckey were now for ever set aside. So impressed was the last
great Victorian explorer with the beauty and fertility of the
region through which he passed, that he gave it the name of
Australia Felix, which the Colony would probably have retained,
had not her Majesty, on its separation from New South Wales,
signified her desire that it should be called after herself.</p>
<p>There have, however, always been some minds in which an
obscurity of apprehension as to the advantages of colonization,
even under the most favourable circumstances, has been
insuperable. In spite of the splendid success which has attended
the founding of so many Colonies, each new project of
colonization has been strongly opposed or seriously questioned,
on the ground of the expense it must occasion&mdash;an outlay,
which these short-sighted objectors fail to perceive, has, within
a few years, almost invariably been repaid with compound interest
by the profits directly or indirectly derived from new
settlements.</p>
<p>This timidity, against which all our colonizing experience has
been a standing protest, nearly lost us New Zealand, prevented a
more timely annexation of Fiji, and leaves New Guinea open for
some undesirable neighbour.</p>
<p>This feeling was more justifiable when Sir Richard Bourke and
Lord Aberdeen wrote the despatches to which we are about to
refer, than it has been since so much subsequent experience has
been acquired. Much light is thrown by the following
correspondence in the Record Office, upon the early views of the
governments, both in England and New South Wales, respecting the
attempts to settle the territory of Victoria.</p>
<p>In a despatch of July 4th, 1834, Governor Bourke encloses to
Mr. Sec, Stanley&mdash;the late Lord Derby&mdash;a letter from
Mr. James Atkinson, respecting a project, of Colonel Verner of
the County Armagh and other gentlemen with whom Mr. Atkinson was
connected, for the formation of a settlement near Twofold Bay, of
a number of families from the North of Ireland. The Governor does
not approve of granting the concessions asked for. He
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Already have the flocks and herds of the colonists
spread themselves over a large portion of this southern country.
They are to be found in great numbers in Monaroo Plains to the
westward of Twofold Bay, and some are said to roam as far to the
southward as Cape Howe. . . . . The excellence of the pastures in
the part of the colony I am describing has induced the graziers
to resort to it, and much of the fine wool which is exported to
England is taken from sheep depastured on vacant crown land
beyond the limits assigned for the location of settlers. It is
not the policy nor would it he within the power of the government
to prevent an occupation which produces so profitable a return,
but being unauthorized it is understood by the occupiers that
they cannot under such circumstances expect protection from the
government. If a settlement be made as proposed by Col. Verner,
or any other authorized settlement be established on the Southern
Coast it will then be impossible to deny to persons already
occupying lands in these parts the privilege of converting that
occupation into property by purchase in the manner now fixed by
regulation. This being effected, the Colonists thus regularly
located, will claim the protection of the government, and the
establishment of churches, schools, courthouses, gaols,
custom-houses, a regular police and military force; and the
numerous institutions of civilized life will be required in a
country of great extent and slender population to the support of
which institutions the persons to be benefited by them will not
for some time be in a condition to contribute in any considerable
degree.<br>
<br>
"I have with reference to the proposed plan, thought it right to
bring thus briefly before you the actual condition of the
southern part of this colony and to state the certain effect upon
expenditure consequent upon throwing it open to location. I beg,
however, I may not be understood as opposing such a measure. On
the contrary I would avoid as much as possible any obstacle to
the profitable employment of rearing sheep, for which great
extent of country is required. This pursuit may indeed be
continued for some time longer in its present form without much
inconvenience, but the prevailing desire of the colonists to
spread to the southward, the advantage which would result from
enabling the graziers now scattered over that country to embark
their wool for Europe, and salted meats for home or foreign
consumption at Twofold Bay and to supply Van Diemen's Land from
thence with live cattle induce me to think it would not be
premature to extend the authorized limits of location as far to
the Southward as that harbour. The augmenting revenue of the
colony (derived, it is true, almost entirely from the duties of
customs levied at Sydney) appears equal to the support of some
additional establishment for the service of the southern country,
and it would, perhaps, be desirable, as a measure of precaution,
to disperse in that direction under legal restraint, and in
military custody some of the numerous bodies of convicts who may
be expected to arrive from Great Britain under the present system
of transportation. With regard to the second point, it is to be
remarked, that if the principle of competition be abandoned, and
if the regulated price of land be reduced in favour of persons
brought out at the cost of an association, a similar reduction
may be claimed with perfect fairness by all persons who arrive at
their own charge, and thus a material, and, in my opinion an
injurious change will be made in the system under which the
vacant Crown Lands have been disposed of since the 1st July,
1831. I cannot therefore recommend that the land which the
association, might select should be disposed of otherwise than by
auction under the usual conditions or that the minimum rate
should be less than five shillings an acre. The association
would, however, be at liberty, as a matter of course, to avail
itself of the aids offered to emigration by the bounties and
advances payable under the existing regulations . . .<br>
<br>
"In concluding this despatch I would observe that it is not
beyond the southern boundary alone the flocks and herds of the
Colonists have wandered for suitable pastures. They are numerous
to the South West along the banks of the Murrumbidgee and to the
North they have crossed the Mountain Range into Liverpool Plains.
Here, indeed, and still more northerly on the banks of Peers
River, five hundred thousand acres of land have been granted to
the Australian Agricultural Company. In every direction the
desire of procuring good pastures for sheep has led the Colonists
far beyond the limits of location. The unauthorized occupants
must not, however, be permitted to continue so long as to create
any title to the land in the occupier. Under the provisions of an
act of council passed last year, 4 Gul. IV. No. 10 measures may
be taken to prevent such a fraud on the Crown."</blockquote>
<p>In a memorandum * or minute with the Van Diemen's Land Papers
of 1835, written adversely to Batman's enterprise, it is stated
that "a proposition was made (27th February, 1835) by Colonel
Verner, M.P. for purchasing land in the neighbourhood of Twofold
Bay," and that the application from an agent of his association
was sent home by Sir R. Bourke, July 4th, 1834.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A portion of this has already been quoted on
the subject of the abandonment of the settlement at Western Port,
vol. i. p. 251.]</p>
<p>It is further stated that "Colonel Verner's project was
negatived, and Lord Aberdeen in his despatch to Sir B. Bourke
(December 25th, 1834) expressed a decided objection to the
extension of the Colony beyond its present limits, on the ground
that such a measure would tend directly to counteract and defeat
one principal object which the government had in view in the late
change in the land regulations, viz. the concentration of
Colonists; and also on the ground of the increased expenditure
which would attend the extension of that machinery of government,
which the settlers in the new district would soon demand. Sir R.
Bourke was further directed to discourage generally any projects
of the like kind as many schemes of that nature, ostensibly for
the purpose of encouraging emigration but in reality for the
benefit of the projectors, had been encouraged by H.M. Government
without realizing those projects of Public good which could alone
justify the extraordinary privileges granted to private
individuals."</p>
<p>When a project for colonizing a place so near Sydney as
Twofold Bay was thus discountenanced, it was not to be expected
that a settlement at the distance of Portland Bay would be more
favourably regarded. But, at the very time the Twofold Bay scheme
was the subject of correspondence, between the Secretary of State
and the Governor of New South Wales, the first permanent
settlement in Victoria was being successfully established.</p>
<p>The Messrs. Henty are undoubtedly the first founders of
Victoria, although from the fact that Portland is so far from the
principal centres of the progress of the Colony, those who
established the first permanent settlements on the shores of Port
Phillip Bay seem to be regarded as the first founders of
Victoria. Even had no other centres of colonization been
established, there is little doubt that there was sufficient
vitality in that formed at Portland, to have made it the medium
of the occupation of the whole territory. The Hentys are
therefore clearly entitled to the chief place among the founders
of the Colony.</p>
<p>The expedition which thirty years before, under government
auspices, made a futile effort to colonize Victoria, had, on
abandoning the attempt as hopeless, crossed to Tasmania&mdash;a
territory which appeared to offer better prospects of success;
and it was from Tasmania that now, in 1834 and 1835, proceeded
those three expeditions which under private management, so well
laid the foundations of a great Colony. The pasture-lands of
Tasmania having become occupied, the settlers, doubting the
wisdom of allowing "the kangaroo to reign undisturbed lord of the
soil," and "to retain for ages" that lordship, had for some time
seriously contemplated an inroad upon Lord Kangaroo's domains.
The Hentys led the invasion; Batman and Fawkner carried it on in
another direction.</p>
<p>Something must be said of the founders of the Colony before
speaking of their enterprise. In the part which they took in this
great event, as well as in their subsequent careers, the members
of the Henty family certainly proved themselves to be Colonists
who would have been a credit to any new community. Mr. Thomas
Henty was a landowner and banker at West Tarring in Sussex. He
was one of the few gentlemen&mdash;'their number was but
six&mdash;who kept flocks of Merino sheep. He laid the foundation
of his stock from purchases made at the sale of King George
III.'s Merinos, which were presented to that monarch by the King
of Spain. Mr. Henty's first connexion with the Colonies arose
from the sale of select rams for exportation to Australia, He had
frequently sent specimens of his stock to the exhibitions of the
Board of Trade, and was always successful. Having seven
sons&mdash;most of whom still live&mdash;he determined on trying
his fortune in the new country. Accordingly, in 1829 he
despatched three of them to Western Australia with stock and
outfit, and no less than forty servants. Such an importation, in
accordance with the land regulations, entitled his family to a
grant of upwards of 80,000 acres. Being disappointed with the
quality of the soil, the Hentys proceeded in 1832 to Tasmania,
intending to take up land there under the favourable regulations
until then in force, but which, on arriving, they found had only
just been altered.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards Mr. Thomas Henty himself went out to
Tasmania, from whence he proceeded to see the land at Swan River,
of which, like his sons, he formed an unfavourable opinion. "On
his voyage"&mdash;so runs a statement in a copy of a letter
written to their agents in England, in the possession of Mr. Wm.
Henty&mdash;"he stopped at a great many parts along the coast,
among others at Portland Bay, which he liked, and he thought as
it was totally unoccupied, and far removed from all the
settlements, that it was not likely to be required by the
government for years to come, and might perhaps therefore be
obtained by him."</p>
<p>From the following documents it will be seen how the members
of the family sought to be allowed to take up land at Portland,
Colonel Arthur, Governor of Van Diemen's Land, was clearly
favourable to their undertaking, and would gladly have had the
territory placed under his government.</p>
<p>Less has been published about this first settlement than about
that established at Port Phillip. It was, however, formed by the
landing of Mr. Edward Henty and his brother Stephen, who, sailing
from Launceston in October, with a considerable agricultural
outfit of cattle, sheep, and servants, landed at Portland Bay,
November 19th, 1834. We have no details of the early days of the
settlement. It is to be hoped, however, that its founders may yet
make public the leading incidents of their enterprise, for it is
desirable that minute particulars of such a historical event
should be given to the world.</p>
<p>The documents immediately following, copies of which are in
the Record Office, contain some important facts, and have an
interesting bearing on our subject. In a letter to Governor
Arthur, dated Launceston, February 17th, 1834, Mr. James Henty
encloses the following memorial, and explains the treatment
pursued by his brother towards the blacks in Western
Australia:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote">"Copy.</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"To the Right Hon. E.G. Stanley,
Chief Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>
<p class="negindent2">"The humble Memorial of Thos. Henty, late
of West Tarring in the County of Sussex, Landowner and Banker and
now of Launceston in the Colony of Van Diemen's Land</p>
<blockquote>     "Sheweth&mdash;<br>
<br>
"That your Memorialist having a family of seven sons the youngest
of whom is nineteen years of age was induced to part with his
landed property in England and emigrate to Van Diemen's Land on
the expectation of obtaining land under the regulations which
existed in 1830. On his arrival here he found that the new system
of selling lands had in a great measure deprived him of the means
of providing for his sons in the manner he expected and was
prepared to do.<br>
<br>
"Your Memorialist having thus been shut out of land by the
operation of the present regulations has been compelled to hire
land in the Colony at an exorbitant rent and is now not so well
off as he was in England simply from the effect of the Land
Regulations at present in force.<br>
<br>
"Your Memorialist having also suffered most severe and unexpected
losses at Swan River, humbly submits that the proposition he now
makes may receive the favourable consideration of His Majesty's
Government more especially as it is founded upon the principle of
selling land which is now invariably adopted in the Colonies.<br>
<br>
"Your Memorialist with the aid of his sons has made several
excursions on the South Coast of New Holland altogether apart
from the settled part of the Country. During these periodical
visits they have found out islands, rivers, headlands and made
various other geographical discoveries which have not been laid
down in any Chart or Map hitherto published, he has also
ascertained that many parts of the South Coast are faced with
land to a considerable extent well calculated for sheep, a great
portion of which your Memorialist conceives can be made available
by industrious settlers. With this opinion, both himself and his
sons are desirous of settling on some portion of this country;
and without asking or requiring any protection from the
Government or causing it to incur any expense whatever, propose
that himself and each of his sons, be permitted to purchase from
Government two thousand five hundred acres of land (2500) at five
shillings an acre, such land to be selected by themselves between
the parallels of 136 and 145 degrees East Longitude, under such
restrictions as may be thought necessary. That being the first to
settle in the country, greater expenses and greater difficulties
will have to be encountered which will deprive them of a certain
portion of their capital, and this capital they will require to
enable them to bring the land into profitable cultivation. On
these grounds they ask, on the payment of a deposit of five per
cent, they be permitted to have a credit of ten years to pay the
remainder of the purchase-money, to be secured by mortgage on the
land, bearing interest at five per cent.<br>
<br>
"Your Memorialist respectfully begs further to state that in
forming settlements in these colonies, the settler and aborigines
have generally come into hostile collision, and mutual acts of
aggression have been the consequence. In this respect your
Memorialist feels himself perfectly safe. Four of his sons having
had considerable experience in the management and treatment of
the Natives at Swan River and King George's Sound; at which
latter place they are better managed and under better controul
than in most others.<br>
<br>
"A son of your Memorialist was living within three miles of the
settlement at King George's Sound between one and five years, in
the midst of whole tribes of aborigines totally unprotected and
such was the good feeling kept up between them, that no instance
of misconduct occurred among them; they were taught to labour
for, and earn the food with which they were occasionally
supplied.<br>
<br>
"The experience thus gained he hopes will be considered
sufficient guarantee that the same system can be pursued in other
places and thus by proper management the views of His Majesty's
Government in establishing a friendly intercourse and mutual good
feeling with the Aborigines on the South Coast may be
facilitated.<br>
<br>
"Your Memorialist begs further to state that he has an order for
land in the Colony of Western Australia to the extent of 80,000
acres, and which, should the proposition now submitted be acceded
to, he will at once abandon; which will show that the object of
your Memorialist is not to become a land-jobber but a real and
bond fide settler.<br>
<br>
"Your Memorialist's eldest son is on the point of proceeding to
England and will have the honour to lay before His Majesty's
Government such information as he may possess respecting the
South Coast of New Holland.</blockquote>

bound will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">(Signed)         "<small>THOMAS
HENTY.   <br>
G.J. HENTY."         </small></p>
<p>In his despatch of April 18th, 1834, to Mr. Secretary Hay,
Governor Arthur encloses copies of the Memorial and of Mr. J.
Henty's letter, and says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Henty who left England in 1830 and afterwards
remained for some months at Swan River where having settled he
suffered considerable losses arrived in this colony in 1832 where
he met with a farther disappointment in the cessation of the
system of granting lands under the Quit rent.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Henty and his family are highly respectable and deserve, so
far as it can be consistently given, the support of the
Government."</blockquote>
<p>Having stated the substance of the Memorial, the Governor
proceeds,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Such a proposal I should recommend for favourable
consideration did it not involve in some of its details an
invasion of the general principle under which lands are sold, and
might, therefore, be injurious as a precedent for other
applications which the government could not acquiesce in, and yet
might be embarrassed in revising.<br>
<br>
"The settlement of the land pointed out by Mr. Henty is, however,
most desirable&mdash;the country is rich, well watered and within
a very short distance of Launceston,&mdash;indeed Mr. Henty's
application and his proposal to cede so much land at Swan River,
if allowed to purchase an estate there, affords strong evidence
of the high opinion that has been entertained of it upon
inspection.<br>
<br>
"Its proximity to Launceston, and the easy communication across
the Straits unquestionably point it out as a station of
importance to this colony, where the available territory has
already been almost entirely appropriated, leaving but few spots
for the selection of new immigrants, who might therefore, be sent
to that station, and be protected by a small military party
detached from this colony.<br>
<br>
"Other arrangements might also be made from hence, which would
not only save the first settlers from much of the distress
commonly incident to the first occupation of a new country, which
has been so much felt at Swan River, but what is of more moment
might save them from coming into collision with the natives, who
from Captain Sturt's narrative appear to be numerous in that part
of New Holland.<br>
<br>
"My services are quite at Mr. Secretary Stanley's command, if he
would wish me personally to superintend for a few weeks the first
formation of the settlement, and would desire a report upon its
adaptation upon which His Majesty's Government might entirely
rely. So soon as a sufficient reinforcement of troops arrives in
this garrison I could without apprehension of my absence being
injuriously felt, cross the Straits for a short time, and nothing
would individually afford me greater gratification than being
instrumental in aiding in the occupation of that part of the
coast by means which might tend to secure the protection and
promote the civilization of the Aborigines. When once New Holland
is fully stocked with improved sheep, Great Britain will
thenceforth be little dependant upon the Continent for wool, and
in the promotion of this speculation the land on the Southern
Coast might be sold and the proceeds applied to emigration.
Convicts holding tickets of leave who have served with good
conduct for a period which renders them eligible for emancipation
might obtain that indulgence on condition of residing in Southern
Australia&mdash;a measure which would be advantageous in drafting
off part of our convict population, and thereby making room for
the usual succession of transported felons to be certainly
punished and probably reformed in Van Diemen's
Land."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter from Worthing, Sussex, dated September 20th, 1834,
to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Right Hon. T.
Spring Rice, M.P., Mr. James Henty&mdash;who had come to England
to press the claim&mdash;states the circumstances respecting the
allotment of 84,000 acres at Swan River, and the removal of
himself and brothers to Tasmania with the forty people whom they
had brought from England. Mr. James Henty&mdash;with the
remainder of the property, which had not been removed by his
brother, Mr. Stephen Henty, who had preceded him&mdash;sailed
from Swan River in January, 1832, and reached Launceston March
1st. Here he "found that on the 10th February preceding new land
regulations had been issued by which the system of granting land
in proportion to the property of the settler was abolished, and
instead of that system all land was to be sold at not less than
5<i>s</i>. per acre."</p>
<p>He proceeds to say that his brother, on his arrival from Swan
River had no opportunity of informing him of the change of the
Tasmanian land regulations. Mr. Henty continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The regulations that were alone known to us when we
determined on proceeding to V.D. Land induced us to form that
resolution. Those regulations would have entitled myself and my
brother Stephen each to a maximum grant of 2560 acres and under
the belief that we should obtain grants, my father with the rest
of his family (3 sons and 1 daughter) left England for V.D. Land
in the month of October, 1831, and that step he adopted in
consequence of my having written informing him of my intention to
quit Swan River and go to V.D. Land where I and my brother
Stephen would be entitled to Maximum grants."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Henty goes on to say that people who left England, or had
begun to prepare to do so, before hearing of the new regulations,
and all who had embarked from Swan River except his family, had
obtained grants under the old regulations.</p>
<p>In a reply to Mr. James Henty of October 2nd, 1834, in the
possession of Mr. Wm. Henty, Sir George Grey says, "I have to
express Mr. Spring Rice's regret that he does not perceive in
your statements sufficient grounds to warrant his admitting your
claim, or that of your brothers, to maximum grants of land upon
the old terms."</p>
<p>With a short letter, dated London, February 11th, 1835, to Mr.
Secretary Hay, Mr. James Henty forwards the following
statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Thomas Henty a landed proprietor in the county
of Sussex having successfully introduced into the Colonies of Van
Diemen's Land and New South Wales a considerable number of his
improved Merino sheep determined in 1828 on emigrating to
Australia with his family consisting of ten individuals. He was
induced to alter his original intention of going to the older
settlements in consequence of the determination of His Majesty's
Government in 1829 to establish a Colony at Swan River upon the
reports of Captain Stirling and Mr. J. Fraser, the former
commanding His Majesty's Ship <i>Success</i> and the latter
holding the appointment of Colonial Botanist at Sydney from
whence they sailed to examine it some time previous.<br>
<br>
"The Reports of these gentlemen were decidedly favourable as
regarded the quality of the soil and the capabilities of the
place for a colony which induced Mr. Henty to send three of his
sons to the proposed new settlement. The party was fully equipped
with every necessary for such an undertaking including amongst
implements and other things ten horses, ten choice cows and
bulls, one hundred and eighty pure bred Merino and South Devon
sheep and upwards of forty labourers and mechanics.<br>
<br>
"The vessel arrived at the Swan River in October 1829 the value
of the property landed by Messrs. Henty entitled them by the
government regulations to 84,413 acres of land which was
accordingly allotted to them by the Lieutenant-Governor.<br>
<br>
"It was evident to every unprejudiced mind that the quality of
the land was far inferior to that described by Messrs. Stirling
and Fraser, but having embarked so much property in the
undertaking the Messrs. Hentys were unwilling to form a hasty
opinion of its capabilities and every possible pains were taken
during the next two years to find suitable land. In the course of
their investigations every part of the settlement was visited,
viz. Port Augusta (at Cape Lewin), Cape Naturaliste, Ports Vasse,
Leschenault and Murray, the Swan and Canning Rivers to their
sources across the Darling Range of Mountains to the Avon River
and along its banks for thirty miles and King George's Sound from
which several journeys into the interior for 50 or 60 miles were
made.<br>
<br>
"No land being found in any way calculated for farming purposes,
they determined to abandon the settlement for Van Diemen's Land
to which place, at a great cost they removed in 1831.<br>
<br>
"On the receipt of this intelligence from his sons Mr. Thos.
Henty, who was then occupied in disposing of his property and
arranging his affairs in England, made an application to Lord
Goderich for land in Van Diemen's Land stating the circumstances
attending their abandonment of the Swan River. New regulations
for the disposal of Crown Lands in that Colony having been some
months previously issued by Government, the application was not
acceded to, but a letter was given to him by Lord Howick, then
Under Secretary for the Colonies authorizing him to reselect his
land at Swan River if he found after visiting the Settlement that
the land allotted to him was not as it had been described and was
unfit for his purposes.<br>
<br>
"At the time he accepted that letter he believed that his son's
removal to Van Diemen's Land would have entitled him to a grant
according to the amount in value of the property they had
conveyed there from Swan River so that in the event of his not
finding land to suit his purposes at Swan River he should he able
to fall back on the minor grant at Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>
"All his arrangements having been previously made for emigrating
to Van Diemen's Land, he was under the necessity of embarking for
that Colony in October 1831 accompanied by five of his family the
youngest of whom was 17 years of age.<br>
<br>
"On his arrival at Van Diemen's Land he found to his utter
astonishment and dismay that his sons had not been able to get
away from Swan River in time by a few weeks, to entitle him to
claim land in Van Diemen's Land under the old regulations
consequently he was left in the distressing situation of an
emigrant with a large family of young men, a considerable number
of labourers and mechanics and a quantity of very superior live
stock, unequalled in value by any ever imported, without the
possession of an acre of land or the means of acquiring it under
the new regulations notwithstanding he had expended upwards of
&pound;10,000 in sending his sons to Swan River and conveying his
family and property to the Southern Hemisphere. Though he had the
greatest confidence in the opinion and judgment of his eldest son
with reference to the capabilities of the Swan River Settlement,
another son was dispatched in 1832 to report upon it, and in the
following year he was induced in compliance with Lord Howick's
letter to embark for the same place accompanied by a third son,
in order fully to satisfy himself on the subject and to show that
he had taken every possible means to acquire an accurate and
perfect knowledge of the soil and settlement.<br>
<br>
"The result of these several opinions has fully confirmed that
formed by the eldest son in 1831, which in the words of Mr. T.
Henty are as follows&mdash;'Upon the banks of the Swan and
Canning Rivers there are some spots of good alluvial land but the
country generally is the reverse of what it is described to be by
Mr. Fraser. . . . . . Speaking of the settlement generally I
think it a miserable place for colonizing&mdash;deep sand or
granite generally covered with grass-tree, Zamia and gigantic
timber are the prominent features, scarcely any herbage (except
in small flats) and not at all calculated for the object I had in
view that of keeping a flock of fine long wooled sheep fitting
for the-finest fabrics, cattle and horses. The little money I
have left if invested there would be sunk without a chance of any
return.' Again speaking of King George's Sound he says, 'Sir R.
Spencer said the country had been much misrepresented. I quite
agree with him if any party or parties intend settling here, I
strongly recommend them to send out confidential persons who
understand agriculture to find land before they venture to go out
themselves.'<br>
<br>
"During the progress of the several voyages undertaken by Messrs.
Henty along the South Coast of New Holland they have visited and
explored the following places entirely at their own expense under
the expectation that His Majesty's Government would allow them to
locate themselves on any part of the Coast vizt. King's Island at
the entrance of Bass's Straits, Portland Bay in the 142nd degree
of East Longitude, Lady Juliana Percy's Islands, Cape
Bridgewater, and a deep Bay to the west not laid down by Flinders
called by Mr. Henty Mount's Bay, Kangaroo Island, Spencer's Gulf,
Encounter Bay, into which there are two openings (one a new
discovery) Port Lincoln, Althorpes, Wedges, Flinders, Thistle,
Snake, Middle and Goose Islands. Many of these places were
explored interiorly particularly at Portland Bay, which they
traversed in various directions for forty miles and found soil
generally good and covered with excellent grass well adapted for
sheep and cattle.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Henty having at a great expense complied with the terms of
the letter of the Under Secretary claims permission to select his
land again agreeably to that authority, but as he finds it
impossible to make any selection at the Swan River which will
afford him a prospect of return and his deliberate opinion being,
that money invested there will be certainly sunk or in other
words irrevocably lost to himself and his family he prays that
His Majesty's Government will permit him to make his selection at
Portland Bay on the South Coast of New Holland in the 142 degree
East Longitude and in such case he asks of the Government to give
him one fourth of the quantity of land that was allotted to him
at the Swan River which with his family of ten, and forty
labourers he undertakes to locate within one year without expense
or charge to the Government of any kind whatever.<br>
<br>
"His claim upon Government is based upon grounds deserving the
best consideration; he was induced to embark the greatest part of
his fortune in the Swan River Settlement upon the faith of the
report of Government officers (Captain Stirling and Mr. Fraser)
whose statements have proved at variance with the truth. His
sons' unavoidable detention at Swan River with the wreck of that
property after they were prepared to leave, deprived him of the
means of obtaining a minor grant of land under the old land
regulations and throwing upon him the burden (burden, because he
had no land) of keeping his valuable stock of sheep cattle and
horses and maintaining without beneficial employment 43 labourers
whom he had conveyed there. He has explored the whole of the
South-west Coast of New Holland after personally investigating
the Swan River Settlement under the expectation that Government
would allow him to re-select his grant if he should find land fit
for agricultural operations. Such are the grounds that give him a
claim upon the bounty of the Government&mdash;he is now between
60 and 70 years of age&mdash;he has expended his property in a
delusive scheme which received countenance from Government and
which would involve him and his family in certain ruin, if he
invested the remainder of his property there. He now submits that
it would be an act of justice to authorize him to settle upon
land which he considers to be calculated for the object he
originally had in view in embarking his property at Swan River
vizt. the production of the finest kinds of wool. The spot he
seeks permission to locate himself family and labourers upon is
in a part of Australia wholly unexplored excepting by himself, at
the least 500 miles distant from any other settlement and not
within the boundaries of the South Australian Parliamentary
grant."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter to the Earl of Aberdeen of March 14th, 1835, Earl
Surrey encloses the statement, and speaks of the Henty family as
"most enterprising and highly respectable", and "well known to me
in Sussex, where they sold their estate to go out." Lord Surrey
further says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. James Henty has since he received Mr. Hay's
answer, heard from his father that in pursuance of his scheme to
settle at Portland he has actually chartered a ship from Van
Diemen's Land with thirty-one head of cattle, pigs, live-stock in
general, farming implements &amp;c. Labourers &amp;c., a frame of
a house and other requisites of location.<br>
<br>
"The die is now cast and Mr. Henty must abide the result of his
scheme whether Government choose to protect him or not. Of this
he cares little as he is determined to run the risk of being
protected but what he requires of the Government is that in the
event of the District in the neighbourhood of Portland Bay ever
becoming a Government Colony they will protect Mr. Henty in his
priority of settlement&mdash;that is they will not disturb but
will confirm his possession against any new comer."</blockquote>

Surrey:**&mdash;</p>

"The object which this gentleman, as well as his father, are
desirous of accomplishing, is one which could not with propriety

<blockquote>"Four acres of land only had been enclosed to secure
the stock as it had been landed and no buildings had been
erected, those of your Memorialists who had proceeded there
having lived in tents. . . .<br>

"The result of their labours and expenditure has been the
occupation of six stations, of which one is at Portland Bay,
another fifteen miles distant at Cape Bridge water, three at the
open country about sixty miles inland called 'Merino Downs'
situate on the River Wannon near its junction with the Glenelg
and another station on the road from Portland Bay.<br>
<br>
"They have erected two considerable houses at Portland Bay, one
of them containing twelve rooms and two others at 'Merino Downs',
all of a substantial build, and also constructed the following
buildings&mdash;viz. nine yards&mdash;shed, large barn, store,
stable, carpenters blacksmith and shoe-makers' shop, dairy and
other buildings. The value of the buildings, fencing, and other
improvements that have been erected at Portland Bay, exceeds the
sum of Five thousand pounds independent of the fences and the
houses and buildings inland which together with the building of
bridges, formation of roads and other expenses and improvements
cannot in the whole be estimated at less than &pound;8000 to
&pound;10,000.<br>
<br>
"They have fenced in 135 acres (as measured by the Government
Surveyors) in one paddock and other smaller paddocks&mdash;of the
former sixty acres have been cleared and grubbed of stumps at an
expense of not less than twenty-five pounds an acre and are now

"They have three portions of about 40 acres 15 acres and ten
acres respectively fenced in at the inland stations and

"From Portland Bay to the interior they have with much labour and
expense laid out and made an excellent road though the country is
very heavy and its difficulties such as could not have been
surmounted except by a party comprising great strength. This road
crosses three rivers by means of bridges of their own erecting
which has made the route open and easily accessible to future
settlers.<br>

<p>By a letter of March 31st, 1840, Mr. Deas Thomson, Colonial
Secretary, informs the Messrs. Henty of the decision of the
Executive Council at Sydney, refusing the prayer of the Memorial,
and stating that the Council could not "perceive any ground on
which this case can be distinguished from those of other
unauthorized occupiers."</p>
<p>In a despatch of April 11th, 1840, Sir George Gipps encloses a
letter addressed to the Secretary of State from the seven sons
and one stepson&mdash;in the Memorial "son-in-law"&mdash;of the
late Mr. Henty, namely Messrs. Jas. Henty, Samuel Bryan, C.S.
Henty, W. Henty, Edwd. Henty, S.G. Henty, Jno. Henty, and F.B.
Henty, requesting that they may be confirmed in or receive
compensation for land occupied by them at Portland. The following
extract from the despatch gives an estimate, formed at the time,
of the services rendered by the founders of one of the most
valuable of colonies. Governor Gipps says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The Messrs. Henty, like the first settlers at Port
Phillip, claim to have rendered good service to the Government,
and to the Colony of N.S. Wales, by opening a district of county,
which might otherwise have remained unoccupied for a number of
years; but so far from considering this any advantage, I look
upon it as directly the reverse; not only because the dispersion
of population is increased by it, but because also we are forced
prematurely to incur considerable expense in the formation of a
new establishment. I have already, in consequence of the
proceedings of the Messrs. Henty, been obliged to send two
expeditions to Portland Bay, and I am under the necessity of
organizing a Police Force there, and of laying out a Town,
besides incurring expense for the protection of the
aborigines."</blockquote>
<p>In their letter to Lord John Russell, Secretary of State for
the Colonies, of April 3rd, 1840, enclosed in the preceding
despatch of 11th, the Messrs. Henty say&mdash;speaking of the
purchase from the natives attempted to be set up by Batman's
Association&mdash;"such kind of claim they could have obtained
and might now obtain for a handful of flour," but that "the
Memorialists think, however, they pay greater respect to the
British authority in forbearing to rest their claims on a title
adverse to the Crown."</p>
<p>Speaking of Lord Aberdeen's response, they say,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Henty's application for 22000 acres was refused
but the Memorialists considered encouragement was given in
official language to cultivate and improve a spot at that time as
little thought of for a place of settlement as the Gulf of
Carpentaria is at present. They looked upon his Lordship as
declaring in other words that a property of whose value they
would be the sole creators should not be taken from them simply
because they could not give it the power of motion.<br>
<br>
"Contrary to the wishes of the Memorialists and contrary perhaps
to the expectations of Lord Aberdeen at the time, the Colony of
New South Wales has leaped&mdash;not marched to these its most
western confines."</blockquote>
<p>In a despatch of November 10th, 1840,* to Sir George Gipps, in
reply to one from him of April 11th, Lord John Russell says, "The
reasons which you have assigned for declining to recognize the
claims of the Messrs. Henty appear to me conclusive. You will
have the goodness, therefore, to inform those gentlemen that I do
not feel justified in complying with their application."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Copy in possession of Mr. William Henty.]</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps, in a despatch of October 27th, 1840, in the
Record Office, informs Lord John Russell of the first sale of
land at Portland Bay. He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As the sale of these allotments took place at
Melbourne on the 15th inst., I have not yet received an official
account of it; but I learn from authentic sources that 337 acres,
offered for sale, produced the sum of &pound;17,245 10<i>s</i>.
5<i>d</i>. being at the average rate of more than &pound;50 per
acre.<br>
<br>
"The sale included 20 acres of building land in the proposed
town, which sold at the rate of &pound;551 6<i>s</i>. per acre;
50 acres of land fit for gardens, or the erection of villas, in
the immediate neighbourhood of the town which produced &pound;64
per acre; and 267 acres of land fit for cultivation, within the
distance of two miles from the town which sold for &pound;11
7<i>s</i>. per acre.<br>
<br>
"When it is borne in mind, that as yet only one house (that of
Mr. Henty's) exists in the place, and that the nearest Government
establishment is 150 miles distant, this result will, I doubt
not, be considered by your Lordship as highly satisfactory; at
any rate, I trust it will be taken as a proof that the measures
which I adopted for opening the district were not
premature."</blockquote>
<p>This is, certainly, an early departure from the view taken in
the despatch of April 11th. The Governor continues,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I cannot abstain from remarking to your Lordship,
that had Portland Bay been opened on the South Australian
principle, the produce of the sale of land now reported, would
have been &pound;337 instead of &pound;17,245 10<i>s</i>.
5<i>d</i>.</blockquote>
<p>The despatch announces the appointment of Mr. James Blair as
Police Magistrate at Portland Bay, and Mr. F.A. Powlett as
Commissioner of Crown Lands for the district between Portland Bay
and Port Phillip.</p>
<p>In a despatch of December 4th, 1840, Sir George Gipps encloses
to the Secretary of State Mr. Blair's letter to Mr. La
Trobe&mdash;Superintendent of the Port Phillip
District&mdash;dated November 13th, reporting the condition of
Portland Bay. The Magistrate says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"The township consists at present of one good house and six
decent cottages, besides a few huts, and contains a population of
at least one hundred souls. The population of the entire district
amounts to about six hundred."</p>
<p>Mr. Blair does not speak favourably of the labouring classes;
but be considers the harbour better than he expected, and that it
might be made more available by the construction of a jetty at a
cost of &pound;300 or &pound;400&mdash;an opinion in which, he
states, Mr. Henty and Captain Moore concur with him. He
adds,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have examined a list of the vessels which have visited it
since the 1st of January last and find that up to the 13th of
November, 49 vessels whose tonnage amounted to 7010 tons had been
here and all of them with the exception of 5 whalers and 2
revenue cutters were traders.</p>
<p>"I also ascertained that at least 1700 bales of wool will be
shipped here this year and two vessels are expected immediately
to load for England."</p>
<p>In a letter to Mr. William Henty, of October 7th, 1842, kindly
lent to the author by that gentleman, the Colonial Secretary at
Sydney&mdash;in reply to one from him, "praying on behalf of the
Messrs. Henty that the proceedings may be stayed which were
instituted to remove these gentlemen from the land occupied by
them at Portland Bay"&mdash;promises compliance with the request,
"until his Excellency receives the despatch which it seems he may
expect from Lord Stanley, but his Excellency can by no means
promise that they shall not be immediately resumed after his
Excellency shall have received it, and possess a knowledge of the
contents of it; and though any proceedings that are incomplete
may be stayed, his Excellency cannot revoke or undo anything that
has been done."</p>
<p>On October 28th, 1842, Mr. La Trobe writes to Mr. Wm. Henty,**
to Launceston, stating that he had received directions from
Sydney to the above effect, and had "instructed the Police
Magistrate at Portland to take no further steps for the removal
of any improvements that you may have made on the Town Lands in
question until fresh directions are given to him.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Letter in his possession.]</p>
<p>"I shall," continues Mr. La Trobe&mdash;with more courtesy
than is displayed in the official communications from
Sydney&mdash;"regret if the steps which it appeared imperative on
the Government to take in regard to your removal, previously to
any intimation being received that your claims were likely to
form a subject of fresh discussion with the Home Government,
should prove to have been disadvantageous to the interests of
your family."</p>
<p>The more favourable response of Lord Stanley, to the
application of the agents of Messrs. Henty in this country, is
conveyed in a despatch to Sir Geo. Gipps of May 27th, 1842.***
His Lordship says after the opening paragraph,&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[*** A copy is among the papers of Mr. Wm.
Henty.]</p>
<blockquote>"I am of opinion that the concluding part of the
letter of Lord Aberdeen to Lord Surrey contains an implied
promise of a favourable consideration of the claims of the
Messrs. Henty in reference to such portion of the land in
question as might be actually under cultivation and fenced.<br>
<br>
"With respect, therefore, to any lands that may be proved to come
within this description, I am prepared so far to alter the former
decisions on this claim, as to authorize you either to allow the
parties a pre-emption of such lands at the amount which it may be
estimated that they would now realize without any improvements
upon them, or if they have been already sold, to pay the Messrs.
Henty the difference between that estimated value and the price
actually received by the government. The value to be assumed for
the purposes of this arrangement will be determined by the Local
authorities, having regard to the price fetched by adjacent or
similar lots in an unimproved state, and to any other
circumstances that they may find ought to be taken into account,
in order to arrive at a correct and equitable conclusion.<br>
<br>
"I wish at the same time distinctly to explain to you, that my
judgment in this case proceeds on the expectation which the words
employed in a former letter of the Secretary of State relating
exclusively to the Messrs. Henty, may be supposed to have created
in their minds, and that therefore the decision is not to be
viewed as a general precedent or as opening the door to the wide
extent of the demands which, I observe, it was at one time feared
in the Council might arise out of a concession to this
application."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter from Melbourne of February 22nd, 1843,* Mr. La
Trobe informs the Messrs. Henty of the purport of the decision of
Executive Council in Sydney,&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* Copy in Mr. William Henty's possession.]</p>
<blockquote>"That in conformity with the authorization of the
Secretary of State you should be allowed a pre-emption of such
lands as might be actually under cultivation and fenced at the
amount which it may be estimated that they would now realize
without any improvements upon them; or if they have been already
sold that Messrs. Henty should be paid the difference between
that estimated value, and the price actually received by the
Government.<br>
<br>
"In obedience to the instruction conveyed to me I have the honour
to state that I shall take immediate measures to ascertain the
improvements effected upon the several portions of land amounting
to 131&frac12; acres, of which a list is enclosed more especially
as regards the fencing and cultivation of the same, and the
period when such improvements were effected.<br>
<br>
"And such further steps as may appear necessary for ascertaining
the present value of each portion of the said lands if in an
unimproved state, and any other information requisite to carry
into effect, the decision of the Council."</blockquote>
<p>The following is the list of the allotments, making up the
131&frac12; acres, mentioned in the letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>In a subsequent minute of the Executive Council, of May 30th,
1843, and communicated by Mr. La Trobe, July 4th, in a letter in
Mr. Wm. Henty's possession, it was provided that the 82 acres of
county lands above specified, "should be granted to the Messrs.
Henty at &pound;2 per acre, being twice the established minimum
price; and when it was borne in mind that they were all small and
choice lots, his Excellency considered such a price to be a
moderate one. But his Excellency observed that there were at some
if not all of the places buildings standing on detached pieces of
land, and which consequently would not be included in the 82
acres." These, it was provided, might be purchased at the same
price, if measured in the manner described. As to the town lands,
the Hentys were permitted to buy them, and also a further
quantity in one continuous block, "equal to what had been already
sold or appropriated by the government at the price of &pound;100
an acre.</p>
<p>"His Excellency lastly proposed that they should be further
allowed &pound;118 compensation for the damage done to their
house"; and that the Messrs. Henty "give up altogether their
claim to the lands which have either been sold or appropriated in
any other way by the government."</p>
<p>In a letter to Mr. La Trobe of October 18th, 1843, the Messrs.
Henty decline the condition as to the waiver of their claims,
object to the insufficiency of the compensation proposed, and to
the high price put upon the land.</p>
<p>This letter was overlooked at Sydney, and no reply sent until
January 20th, 1846, when the refusal of the government to accede
to the claims put forward was communicated to Mr. La Trobe. The
difference between the government and the Messrs. Henty was,
however, afterwards finally adjusted upon the terms expressed in
the following document, a copy of which Mr. Wm. Henty has kindly

<blockquote>"The above arrangements to be considered final, but
only admitted and concluded upon its being satisfactorily shown
that the claims of the Messrs. Henty upon the Government of New
South Wales are thereby fully met and extinguished.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right">(Signed)       <small>"C.J. LA
TROBE."</small>   </p>
<p>Thus were the first founders of the most successful of
Colonies rewarded. They were declared to have done positive harm,
"by opening a district of country, which might otherwise have
remained unoccupied for a number of years." But although Sir
George Gipps wrote in these terms in April, 1840, we have heard
the different strain which he was obliged to adopt so soon after
as the following October. The idea of keeping the area of
colonization contracted was dissipated by the settlement of
Victoria, but the merit of the founders of the Colony was not
recognized. Without going the length of granting the Hentys the
full quantity of land they might have had in Western Australia,
the government might at least have given them the few acres, for
which they had to pay a high price. Considering the circumstances
connected with their going to Western Australia&mdash;their
having been too late to avail themselves of the favourable land
regulations which had just ceased to exist on their arrival in
Tasmania&mdash;and the fact that they were undoubtedly the very
first pioneers of Victoria&mdash;some exception might have been
made in their favour, without the possibility of any such
concession being set up as a precedent. Batman, as we shall see,
could not have put forward so strong a claim, even had he not
attempted to derive a title from the natives independently of the
Crown.</p>
<p>In a despatch of January 27th, 1835, to Mr. Spring Rice,
Governor Arthur commends a proposal of Mr. G.A. Robinson, who was
in charge of the Tasmanian natives on Flinders Island, to remove
them to Portland Bay. The despatch states that their numbers
since they were sent to the island, were reduced to 130. Colonel
Arthur thinks that, under Mr. Robinson's care, they might be made
of use in promoting good relations with the natives on the
mainland, and suggests that a small party of troops should be
sent to Portland Bay. His desire to undertake the direction of
the settlement in connexion with his government is evident, for
he says,&mdash;</p>
<p>"The experience, however, derived from the process of
colonizing in Van Diemen's Land may I think be turned to the best
account in forming the new settlements now projected in New
Holland, and also in subjecting to some regulations the settlers
who have without authority sent from this Colony several flocks
of sheep to be depastured on a part of the opposite
coast&mdash;very near the Eastern boundary of the proposed Colony
of Southern Australia."</p>
<p>With a despatch of March 10th, Governor Arthur sends a copy of
the correspondence with Mr. Robinson. In a letter of February
11th that gentleman, speaking of a previous expression of his
views, says, "I stated it to be my opinion that a friendly
communication might be effected with the aborigines of New
Holland, at Norfolk or Portland Bay. After mature consideration
on this subject I am convinced as to the practicability of such a
measure, and feel persuaded it would be attended with very
beneficial results, both to the government and the aboriginal
natives, themselves. No scheme could be better adapted to
ameliorate the condition of the aboriginal inhabitants and of
affording protection to the emigrants who are fast crowding to
the shores of New Holland than the one under consideration." Mr.
Robinson then goes at some length into the details of his
scheme.</p>
<p>Sir John Franklin, Governor of Van Diemen's Land, in a
despatch to Lord Glenelg, August 3rd, 1837, encloses a report of
Mr. Robinson, dated June 24th, in which that gentleman states
that the mortality which had taken place among the natives on
Flinders Island&mdash;seventeen deaths between January and
June&mdash;induces him "ardently to desire that his Majesty's
Government may accede to the removal of the present establishment
to the adjacent coast of New Holland and where the Flinders
Island aborigines would not only be found efficient, but willing
auxiliaries in aiding the work of civilization, so urgently
needed by the numerous tribes inhabiting that vast Continent."
Sir John Franklin says, "So many objections present themselves to
this, however, that I feel unable to entertain the idea."</p>
<p>With a despatch of January 31st, 1838, Lord Glenelg, sends to
Sir George Gipps, Governor of New South Wales, copies of Sir John
Franklin's despatch, and of Mr. Robinson's report, and
communicates his intention to appoint Mr. Robinson chief
aboriginal protector at Port Phillip, with four assistants,
Messrs. Seivewright, Thomas, Dredge, and Parker. With reference
to the removal of the Van Diemen's Land natives, the Secretary of
State says he should not feel himself "justified in directing the
adoption of it in opposition to such a statement" as that of the
Governor of Van Diemen's Land, with whom he directs Sir George
Gipps to communicate, remarking that, if "the result of the
personal observations of Sir John Franklin, in the visit which he
stated himself to be about to make to Flinders Island, should be
such as to entirely satisfy him that the natives might be so
removed without personal risk or danger to themselves, and with
their own free consent important advantages might be anticipated
from the formation in New Holland of an aboriginal settlement
comparatively so far advanced in civilization."</p>
<p>In a letter of Mr. Montagu, Colonial Secretary of Van Diemen's
to Mr. Deas Thomson, Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, dated
August 22nd, 1838, Mr. Robinson's acceptance of the office of
Chief Protector at Port Phillip is notified, and it is stated
that that gentlemen "is fully empowered by Sir John Franklin to
make any arrangement which may meet the concurrence of Sir George
Gipps, for the removal of the aborigines from Flinders Island to
New Holland; his Excellency has after very mature consideration
arrived at the opinion that such a measure will meet the calls of
humanity towards the Van Diemen's Land natives themselves, and of
policy towards the British settlers, in the increased safety they
may expect by the admixture of the domesticated Blacks with the
less civilized tribes, and the consequent decrease of hostility
on the part of the latter towards the whites."</p>
<p>The number of the blacks was stated in the letter to be
eighty-six, and they were possessed of a flock of 1300 sheep,
which it was proposed they should take with them.</p>
<p>Sir Geo. Gipps, on November 10th, 1838, communicates the final
decision respecting the removal of the Tasmanian aborigines, to
the Secretary of State, Lord Glenelg, informing him that his
despatch of January 31st had arrived at a time "when very great
irritation existed in the Colony in consequence of the collisions
between the settlers and the natives," "so that the project of
removing the Blacks from Flinders Island was no sooner known than
it was met with the most decided opposition by all classes in the
Colony; and even in the Council, I could not find a single member
who would look upon it favourably." It is also stated that Mr.
Robinson, who had been examined before the Executive Council, had
returned to Van Diemen's Land, from whence he was going to Port
Phillip, taking one native family as his personal attendants.</p>

<p>Nearly a year before Batman's expedition, we find some
Tasmanian Colonists turning their attention to the waste
territories on the Australian mainland.</p>
<p>In August, 1834, a joint letter was addressed from Launceston
to the Secretary for the Colonies, in which the writers state
that, "in consequence of the great difficulty of now obtaining
any extent of tolerably good land" in Van Diemen's Land, they
"are desirous of forming a settlement on the Southern Coast of
New Holland, between the Longitudes 135&deg; and 150&deg;." They
ask to be allowed to purchase in fee the number of acres,
respectively standing against their names, at five shillings an
acre&mdash;payment of five per cent, to be made in three months,
and the remainder in ten years. They speak of their experience as
settlers, their possession of stock and facilities for conveying
it to the opposite coast. The following are the names of the
applicants who applied for ten thousand acres each, Geo. P. Ball,
J.P., W.H. Browne, Theodore Bartley, J.P., Andrew Gatenby, and A.
Clarke; Lieut.-Col., Joseph Haslewood, applied for 20,000, and
St. John E. Browne and Henry Browne for 5000 each.</p>

<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I have the honour of
reporting to your Excellency for the information of His Majesty's
Government, the result of an expedition undertaken by myself, at
the expense and in conjunction with several gentlemen,
inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land, to Port Phillip, on the South
Western" (Eastern in pencil in margin) "point of New Holland, for
the purpose of forming an extensive Pastoral Establishment, and
combining therewith the civilization of the native tribes who are
living in that part of the country.<br>
<br>
"Before I enter into the details, I deem it necessary to state
for the information of His Majesty's Government, that I am a
native of Kew South Wales, and that for the last six years I have
been most actively employed in endeavouring to civilize the
aboriginal natives of Van Diemen's Land, and in order to enable
the local Government of this Colony to carry that important
object into full effect, I procured from New South Wales eleven
original natives of New Holland, who were, under my guidance
mainly instrumental in carrying into effect the humane objects of
this Government towards the Aborigines of this Island.<br>
<br>
"I also deem it necessary to state that I have been for many
years impressed with the opinion that a most advantageous
settlement might be formed at Western Port or Port Phillip, and
that in 1827, Mr. J.T. Gellibrand and myself addressed a joint
letter to the Colonial Government of New South Wales soliciting
permission to occupy land at Port Phillip, with an undertaking to
export to that place stock to the value of &pound;6000, and which
was to be placed for a certain number of years under my personal
direction and superintendence.<br>
<br>
"This application was not granted by the Sydney Government
because the land was beyond the limits of that Territory, and the
occupation of Western Port had been altogether
abandoned.***</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[*** "Qy date?" in pencil in margin.]</p>
<blockquote>"It occurred to myself and some of the gentlemen who
are associated with me that, inasmuch as the Sydney natives, who
were living with me, had become well acquainted with the English
language and manners, and had acquired habits of industry and
agricultural pursuits, they might therefore be considered
civilized, and as the available lands in this Colony were
occupied by flocks and sheep, and fully stocked, it would be a
favourable opportunity of opening a direct friendly intercourse
with the Tribes in the neighbourhood of Port Phillip, and by
obtaining from them a grant of a portion of that Territory upon
equitable principles, not only might the resources of this Colony
be considerably extended, but the object of civilization of a
large portion of the Aborigines of that extensive country.<br>
<br>
"In pursuance of arrangements based upon these principles, I
proceeded on the 12th May, 1835, in a vessel from Launceston,
accompanied by seven Sydney natives, and proceeded to Port
Phillip, on the South Western Extremity of New Holland, where I
landed on the 26th May.<br>
<br>
"On the evening of our arrival at Port Phillip we saw the native
fires at a distance of about five miles. I then made my
arrangements for the purpose of opening an intercourse with the
natives by means of those under my charge. I equipped them in
their native dresses, and early in the morning we landed. I
desired the natives to proceed unarmed and they preceded me a few
hundred yards. When we had advanced within half a mile, we saw
the native huts and smoke. My natives then proceeded quietly up
to the huts, expecting that we should find the Tribe asleep, but
when they had got to the huts it appeared that the natives had
fled a few hours previously, leaving behind them their baskets
and other articles.<br>
<br>
"I concluded from this that the natives had discerned the vessel,
and had quitted their huts through fear; and as I thought it
probable they might in consequence quit the coast for a season, I
determined immediately to put my natives upon the track, and if
possible, overtake them, and at once obtain their confidence.<br>
<br>
"My natives followed the track which appeared to have been very
circuitous, and after we had proceeded about ten miles, we at
length saw a Tribe consisting of twenty women and twenty four
children.<br>
<br>
"My natives then made to them some of their friendly signals,
which it appeared were understood; and in the course of a few
minutes, my natives joined the Tribe, and after remaining with
them, as I judged, a sufficient length of time to conciliate
them, and explain my friendly disposition, I advanced alone and
joined them, and was introduced to them by my natives, two of
whom spoke nearly the same language, and so as to be perfectly
intelligible to them.<br>
<br>
"The two interpreters explained to them, by my directions, that I
had come in a vessel from the other shores, that I was, although
a white, a countryman of theirs, and would protect them, and I
wished them to return with me to their huts, where I had left
some presents for them.<br>
<br>
"After some conversation, the whole party, women and children,
returned with me and my natives towards the huts, until they came
within sight of the shore; they then stopt and hesitated in
proceeding, and as I understood from the interpreters, were
afraid I should take them by force, and ill use them as some of
their Tribe had been already.<br>
<br>
"After the strong assurances on my part of my sincerity and
friendly disposition, and that no harm should be done to them,
they then proceeded to the huts, where I gave them a pair of
blankets each, tomahawks, knives, scissors, looking-glasses, and
I affixed round the neck of each woman and child a necklace.<br>
<br>
"As soon as I had distributed the presents, they were informed by
the interpreters that they might depart and join their friends,
and I left them and proceeded on board the vessel. They appeared
by my conduct to them highly gratified and excited, and showed by
their manners that the fullest confidence existed.*</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Arden in his pamphlet, "Latest Information
with regard to Australia Felix," published in Melbourne 1840,
says, "By an inspection of Mr. Batman's journal, the writer is
inclined to think this meeting took place upon the banks of the
Weirabee&mdash;the Ex of the present settlers."]</p>
<blockquote>"On the next and five following days, I employed
myself in surveying the country, and although I saw several
native fires, I abstained from intruding upon them, leaving the
interview I had with the women to have its full effect upon the
Tribes before I visited them again.<br>
<br>
"On the seventh day I proceeded towards the place where I had
seen the fires, and where I had reason to believe the Tribes were
and I sent my natives forward with the same instructions as upon
the first occasion. We remained up the country all night and
proceeded early next morning under the expectation of reaching
the Tribes. After we had proceeded about seven miles we fell in
with a native man and his wife and three children, who received
my natives with apparent cordiality and informed them that the
women to whom I had given the presents, although belonging to
another Tribe, had communicated to them the reception they had
met with from me.<br>
<br>
"I learned from this native where the Chiefs of the Tribes were
stationed and also their names, and this man most readily offered
at once to act as our guide, and take us to the spot. We then
proceeded with the man his wife and children, towards the huts of
the Chiefs, but it appeared that the guide took us past the spot
where the Chiefs were, and some of the children having observed a
white man, gave the alarm, and almost immediately we found the
Tribe in our rear, advancing towards us with spears and in a
menacing position. My natives with the man woman and children,
then called out to the Tribe, and they immediately dropt their
spears and other implements in the grass, and the two sable
parties advanced towards each other, and I shortly followed
them.<br>
<br>
"Some conversation then took place between my natives and the
Tribe,&mdash;the object of my visit and my intentions were then
explained to them, and the Chiefs then pressed me to proceed with
them to see their wives and children, which is one of the
strongest demonstrations of peace and confidence. Upon my
assenting to this request the Chiefs then inquired of my
interpreters, whether I would allow them to take up their
implements of war, which I immediately assented to, and the
principal Chief then gave me his best spear to carry, and I in
return gave him my gun. We then proceeded towards the huts, and
when a short distance from them, the Chief called out to the
women not to be alarmed, and I was then introduced to the whole
tribe, consisting of upwards of twenty men, containing altogether
fifty-five men women and children.<br>
<br>
"I joined this Tribe about 12 o'clock and staid with them until
12 o'clock the next day, during which time I fully explained to
them that the object of my visit was to purchase from them a
tract of their country, that I intended to settle among them with
my wife and seven daughters, and that I intended to bring to the
country sheep and cattle. I also explained my wish to protect
them in every way, to employ them the same as my own natives, and
also to clothe and feed them, and I also proposed to pay them an
annual tribute in necessaries as a compensation for the enjoyment
of the land. The chiefs appeared most fully to comprehend my
proposals, and much delighted with the prospect of having me to
live amongst them. I then explained to them the boundaries of the
land I wished to purchase, and which are defined by hills to
which they have affixed native names and the limits of the land
purchased by me are defined in the Chart, which I have the honour
of transmitting taken from personal Survey.<br>
<br>
"On the next day the Chiefs proceeded with me to the boundaries
and they marked with their own native marks, the trees which were
at the comers of the boundaries, and they also gave me their own
private mark, which is kept sacred by them, even so much so that
the women are not allowed to see it.<br>
<br>
"After the boundaries had been thus marked and described, I
filled up, as accurately as I could define it, the land agreed to
be purchased by me from the Chiefs, and the deed when thus filled
up was most carefully read over and explained to them by the two
interpreters, so that they most fully comprehended its purport
and effect. I then filled up two other parts of the deed, so as
to make it in triplicate, and the three principal Chiefs and five
of the subordinate Chiefs then executed each of the deeds, each
part being separately read over, and they each delivered to me a
piece of the soil for the purpose of putting me in possession
thereof, and understanding that it was a form by which they
delivered to me the tract of land.<br>
<br>
"I have the honour of enclosing herewith a copy of each of the
deeds executed by the natives to me, which I confidently trust
will most clearly manifest that I have proceeded upon an
equitable principle, that my object has not been possession and
expulsion, or what is worse, extermination, but, possession and
civilization; and the reservation of the annual tribute to those
who are the real owners of the soil will afford evidence of the
sincerity of my professions, in wishing to protect and civilize
these tribes of benighted, but intelligent people; and I
confidently trust that the British Government will duly
appreciate the Treaty which I have made with these Tribes, and
will not in any manner molest the arrangements which I have made,
but that I shall receive the support and encouragement of not
only the local Government, but that of the British Government, in
carrying the objects into effect.<br>
<br>
"I quitted Port Phillip on the 14th day of June, having parted
with the Tribes in the most conciliatory manner, leaving five of
my natives with three white men to commence a garden near the
harbour, and to erect a house for my temporary occupation on my
return with my wife and family.<br>
<br>
"I arrived at Launceston after a passage of 36 hours, which will
at once show the geographical advantages of this territory to Van
Diemen's Land; and in a few years I have no hesitation in
affirming, from the nature of the soil, that the exports of wool
and meat to Van Diemen's Land will form a considerable feature in
its commercial relations.<br>
<br>
"I traversed the country in opposite directions about fifty
miles, and having had much experience in land and grazing in Kew
South Wales and in this Colony, I have no hesitation in asserting
that the general character of the country is decidely superior to
any which I have ever seen. It is interspersed with fine rivers
and creeks, and the Downs were extended on every side as far as
the eye could reach, thickly covered with grass of the finest
description, and containing an almost indescribable extent of
fine land fit for any purposes.<br>
<br>
"I have now finally to report that the following are the
gentlemen who are associated with me in the Colonization at Port
Phillip; many of whom will reside with their establishments at
Port Phillip, and all of whom are prepared and intend immediately
to export stock which will he under my general guidance and
immediate superintendence:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"C. Swanston, Thomas Bannister, James Simpson, J.T. Gellibrand,
J. and W. Robertson, Henry Arthur, H. Wedge, John Sinclair, J.T.
Collicott, A. Cotterell, W.G. Sams, M. Connolly, George
Mercer.<br>
<br>
"The quantity of stock exported this year will be at least 20,000
breeding ewes, and one of the leading stipulations will be, that
none but married men of good character, with their families, will
be sent either as overseers or servants, so that by no
possibility any personal injury shall be offered to the natives
or their families; and it is also intended, for the purpose of
preserving due order and morals that a Minister or Catechist
shall be attached to the establishment at the expense of the
Association.<br>
<br>
"The Chiefs to manifest their friendly feeling towards me,
insisted upon my receiving from them two native cloaks and
several baskets made by the women, and also some of their
implements of defence, which I beg to transmit. The women
generally are clothed with cloaks of a description somewhat
similar, and they certainly appear to me to be of a superior race
to any Natives which I have ever seen.</blockquote>

<br>
<p>If, as is stated in the deed, it were "fully interpreted and
explained to the said Chiefs", and as Batman says in his letter,
"it was explained to them by the two interpreters so that they
most fully comprehended its purport and effect," they must have
possessed a wonderful aptitude for English conveyancing; for
within a few days their legal minds had grasped the import of the
words "give grant enfeoff and confirm unto," and had acquired a
due appreciation of the solemnity of "signed sealed and
delivered."</p>
<p>There is a second deed in the same terms, and between the same
parties, except that the name of Cooloolook appears at the
commencement&mdash;it being doubtless inadvertently omitted at
the beginning of the original or preceding copy of the first
deed. It deals with a tract of only a hundred thousand acres, for
which a smaller number of blankets is to be given. The tribe is
called "Iramoo and Geelong." The description of the land is "All
that tract of country situate and being in the bay of Port
Phillip known by the name of Indented Head but called by us
Geelong, extending across from Geelong Harbour about due South
for ten miles more or less to the head of Port Phillip taking in
the whole neck or tract of land and containing about One Hundred
Thousand acres."</p>
<p>In an indenture ** of the 29th of June, 1835, between Batman
of the one part and Chas. Swanston, Thomas Bannister, James
Simpson, Joseph Tice Gellibrand, John and Wm. Robertson, Henry
Arthur, John Hilder Wedge, John Sinclair, John Thos. Collicott,
Anthony Cotterell, Wm. Geo. Sams, and Michael Conolly, all
described as of Van Diemen's Land, and Geo. Mercer as of
Edinburgh of the other part, the deeds of purchase from the
Aborigines are recited, and it is declared that Batman stands
seised of the two tracts of land in the said deeds, in trust to
hold for himself two undivided seventeenth parts, and for the
others an undivided seventeenth each, and two other undivided
seventeenth parts as Geo. Mercer may appoint. It was agreed that
for twelve months Batman and Wedge shall manage the land, in
conjunction with such of the other parties as may see fit to go
to it, and that each of them shall send over five hundred
breeding ewes within six months, and five hundred more within
twelve. Among other things it was provided that the two tracts
shall be surveyed and divided into seventeen parts&mdash;that no
liquor of any description shall be landed&mdash;that Batman shall
have the sole management of the natives&mdash;that the servants
shall be of good character, and if possible, married
men&mdash;that, on the confirmation of the grant by the Crown,
the shares of the party shall be conveyed to them in fee
simple&mdash;that none of them shall dispose of their interests
for five years&mdash;that a medical man and catechist shall be
provided&mdash;that a committee, consisting of Messrs. Swanston,
Gellibrand, and Simpson, shall have power to carry the object of
the deed into execution, and that one consisting of Messrs.
Connolly, Sinclair, and Arthur shall superintend the shipment of

<blockquote>"Copy.</blockquote>

Office</i>,   <br>
3<i>rd July</i>, 1835.           </p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I am directed to inform
you that the Lieut.-Governor having perused with much interest
the account contained in your report "of the 25th ult., of your
expedition to Port Phillip, is highly gratified with the very
favourable opinion you have been enabled to form of the fertility
of the adjacent territory; thus confirming the various statements
which have been made respecting it since the first occupation of
that country in 1803 by Governor Collins, and more especially by
Messrs. Hovell and Hume, and Captain Wright, whose reports have
long since been in the possession of His Majesty's
Government.<br>
<br>
"Though divided only by a few hours' sail from the most fertile
portion of Van Diemen's Land, Port Phillip is not within the
jurisdiction of this Government. His Excellency would, therefore,
only observe that the recognition of the rights supposed to have
been acquired by the Treaty into which you have entered with the
natives, would appear to be a departure from the principle upon
which a Parliamentary sanction, without reference to the
Aborigines, has been given to the settlement of Southern
Australia, as part of the possessions of the Crown.<br>
<br>
"The Lieut.-Governor will have great pleasure, however, in
forwarding your report to His Majesty's Government, and in
representing the enterprise manifested by yourself, the
respectability of the parties interested in the undertaking, and
the humane consideration which His Excellency is informed it is
their intention to extend towards the Aboriginal inhabitants of
Iramoo, but which justice and humanity alike require as a
preliminary in the occupation of every new country; but at the
same time the Lieut.-Governor would remark, for the reasons he
has assigned, that he considers it would not be prudent in the
gentlemen associated with you to incur expense in any reliance
upon a confirmation from the Crown of your title to the land
under the agreement into which you have entered; an opinion which
His Excellency cannot avoid expressing although he is very
sensible that the colonization of the country you have examined
would, on account of its proximity, be highly conducive to the
prosperity of Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>
"I am also to observe that in reference to the application of Mr.
Henty to be allowed, under certain conditions, to locate a grant
of land on the Southern Coast of New Holland, His Majesty's
Government declined to accede to his proposal, conceiving that to
have done so would be to deviate from the principles involved in
the Act for the Settlement of Southern Australia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>&mdash;I have the honour to
enclose for your information the copy of a letter which I have
received from Mr. John Batman, a settler in this Colony, who has
recently visited the opposite Coast of New
Holland,&mdash;examined a portion of the country in the vicinity
of Port Phillip&mdash;and on behalf of an Association, of which
it appears he is the agent, purchased 600,000 acres of land from
one of the Native Tribes.<br>
<br>
"The settlement of this district would unquestionably be highly
advantageous to Van Diemen's Land. Its extensive plains, and rich
pastures are capable of supporting large herds of cattle and
sheep,&mdash;and as the distance between the two ports might be
traversed by a steam boat in about twenty-four hours, it might
very rapidly be covered with flocks and herds from this
Colony&mdash;indeed I have no doubt that the foundation would
soon be laid for a very beneficial intercourse between the two
countries.<br>
<br>
"It would afford me therefore, great pleasure were the facilities
which might be afforded by this Government rendered availing in
the settlement of this very valuable territory,&mdash;which might
I submit, with a view to economy, be placed temporarily under the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>
"As regards the request of the Association that their feoffment
in the land in question by the Aborigines should be confirmed by
the Crown, I am constrained, notwithstanding the great
respectability of the gentlemen interested in the arrangement, to
observe that it does not appear to me that it can be advocated on
any valid grounds.<br>
<br>
"The land was taken possession of by Col. Collins for the Crown
previous to the settlement of Van Diemen's Land,&mdash;and
subsequently, by Captain Wright in 1826, when a Military Post
was, for a period, established there:&mdash;Messrs. Hovell and
Hume, moreover, of whose journey I have an imperfect account
before me&mdash;explored the country in 1824 and 1825.<br>
<br>
"It appears, also, from a comparison of the descriptions given by
Messrs. Hovell and Hume,&mdash;and Mr. Batman, that they had met
with several tribes in the same district, who distinguished it by
different names,&mdash;a circumstance which would render the
original ownership doubtful, even were it true in contemplation
of law, that a migratory savage tribe, consisting of from,
perhaps, 30 to 40 individuals, roaming over an almost unlimited
extent of country, could acquire such a property in the soil as
to be able to convey it so effectually as to confer to the
purchasers any right of possession which would be recognized in
our Courts of law.<br>
<br>
"In order, however, that the subject may be fully before His
Majesty's Government, I have thought it proper to transmit a copy
of the Deed of transfer which was executed by the native
Chiefs.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Batman is an enterprising settler&mdash;he has acted with
prudence as well as humanity, in making it his first effort to
conciliate the native tribe with whom he negotiated, and I trust
that the good feeling which he appears to have established will
be perpetuated&mdash;were a liberal grant of land given him in

Arthur is informed in the following terms of the views of the
Colonial Minister, in reply to his communication of July
4th:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** Record Office.]</p>
<blockquote>"Without entering at present into the question of the
right possessed by the Chiefs who were the contracting parties to
the territory of which they agreed to dispose, or of the justness
and fairness of the terms of the arrangement, I shall simply
advert to the practical question at issue; namely&mdash;the
expediency of confirming the grant to the Association.<br>
<br>
"All schemes promoting settlements by private individuals or
companies in the unlocated districts of Australia have of late
years been discouraged by H.M. Government, as leading to fresh
establishments involving the mother country in an indefinite
expense, and exposing both the natives and the new settlers to
many dangers and calamities. And there is so much of prudence and
of justice and I think I may add of humanity in this policy, that
I do not feel disposed to depart from it in the present
instance.<br>
<br>
"The conduct of Mr. Batman towards the natives has been such as
to make me regret that I find it my duty not to advise H.M. to
sanction the proceedings of that gentleman and his
associates.<br>
<br>
"Your proposal of forming a settlement in the vicinity of Port
Phillip and of placing it under the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of Van Diemen's Land requires and shall have serious
consideration. At present I shall only observe that it seems to
me open to some very serious objections."</blockquote>

<p class="quote" align="center">"Description of the Country
around Port Phillip.<br>
By J.H. Wedge."</p>
<blockquote>"In traversing the interior of the country my
attention was directed to that part of it from the northern
extremity of the Port, round to the westward, including Indented
Head and embracing about forty miles inland. In describing the
country I will take the several parts in the order which I
examined them.<br>
<br>
"The Peninsula of Indented Head first attracted my
attention&mdash;its extent is about one hundred thousand acres.
It is bounded on the west by the Barwurn, a river discovered by
myself, which empties itself into Bass's Straits, a few miles to
the westward of Indented Head, and in its course passes within
about three miles of the western extremity of Port Phillip. The
Eastern part of the Peninsula for about four or five miles from
the margin of the Port, is a low and flat surface, the soil being
light and sandy, and well covered with grass, thinly wooded with
the honeysuckle, she-oak, mimosa and eucalyptus. The land then
swells into low tiers, and alternates with beautiful hill and
dale. On these hills the soil is of finer quality, and the grass
more luxuriant than the plains; these hills gradually decline to
the westward in gentle undulations, and terminate at the Barwurn,
in some places in steep banks, varying in height from thirty to
sixty feet. It is a great drawback to the availability of the
Peninsula that the river Barwurn is subject to the tides, and is
consequently salt up to where it is joined by another river,
about three miles from the western extremity of the Port;
otherwise it would be one of the finest situations for
sheep-farming I have ever met with. On the Peninsula there are
many small water-holes, which afford the natives a supply of
water, but it is brackish and of bad quality, although I
experienced no bad effects from the use of it. At the junction of
the rivers, above alluded to, the one coming from the north-west
is called the Yaloak by the natives; the other coming from the
westward I have named the Byron, into which about ten or twelve
miles up another stream falls, which I have named the Leigh.
These rivers pass through very extensive open plains much further
than the eye can reach, and from Buckley's information at least
one hundred and fifty miles to the westward. About fifteen miles
in a south-west direction from the junction of the Byron with the
Yaloak is a lake called by the natives Moderwarrie, the
intermediate country being grassy hills (called by the natives
Barrubull) of moderate elevation, thickly covered with she-oak
trees; and around the lake an undulating grassy country thickly
timbered extends to the westward. On approaching the coast to the
westward, the country gradually becomes more thickly timbered,
and the quality of the soil not so good. The coast hence tends
nearly south-west to Cape Otway, the country being hilly and
thickly wooded, and from its appearance I should not deem it fit
for agricultural pursuits, although it not unfrequently happens
that very erroneous ideas are formed by judging of the nature of
a country by distant observations. "Near the northern extremity
of the Port, and about three or four miles from it, two rivers
form a junction, the one coming from the north and the other from
the eastward; and their united waters are discharged into the
Port together. Both these rivers are navigable for vessels of
about sixty tons, for five or six miles above the junction. There
is a bar at the mouth of these rivers which precludes large
vessels from entering&mdash;but up to the bar vessels of the
largest burden can approach and find secure anchorage. The
country between these rivers extending to the north forty or
fifty miles, and to the east about twenty-five miles, to a tier
of mountains, which range from the back of Western Port in a
northerly direction, is undulating and intersected with valleys
and is moderately wooded, especially to the east and
north-east&mdash;to the north there are open plains. The soil is
a sandy loam and is generally of good quality and in some of the
valleys very rich&mdash;the surface is everywhere thickly covered
with grass intermixed with rib grass and other herbs. I think
very highly of this part of the country and consider it to be
well adapted for agricultural pursuits. It will be desirable to
form townships at the head of the Saltwater in each of these
rivers. The liver coming from the eastward is called by the
natives Yarrow Yarrow.<br>
<br>
"The country between the river coming from the northward and the
western extremity of the Port, and from twenty-five to forty
miles inland, is open and partakes more of the nature of Downs,
the whole is thickly covered with a light growth of grass, the
soil being in general stiff and shallow. About midway there is a
river falling into the Port which comes from the north-west. I do
not know whether it is navigable any distance inland, as I
crossed it in the first instance about twelve or fourteen miles
above the entrance into the Port, and in the second a
considerable deal higher up at the foot of a range of hills which
bound the plains on the north-west; about Station Mount (called
by the Natives Villamanata) the country is wooded, with this
exception and here and there along the shore of the Port, and
along the course of the river just mentioned, the plains are
quite open, as much so as the heaths of Cambridgeshire, and I
have no doubt they will become valuable sheep stations for
breeding flocks, although it is probable they are affected by the
droughts in the dry summers; but there is no country without its
disadvantages, and I do not think it will be worse, nor indeed so
bad in that respect as New South Wales, as it is more exposed to
the south and westerly winds, from which direction the rains
come. And as far as my observations went very heavy dews are
prevalent.<br>
<br>
"The country to the north and north-west of these is broken and
hilly and I am inclined to think from its appearance, it is
extensively adapted for pastoral purposes. There is a great
deficiency of timber, fit for building and fencing purposes, the
want of which will be seriously felt in this part of the country,
whenever it becomes thickly inhabited. On the whole I think
favourably of the country for the general purposes of
colonization.<br>
<br>
"During all my wanderings in Van Diemen's Land I never fell in
with an emu in its wild state&mdash;this pleasure was reserved
till my recent visit to Port Phillip; I saw there on several
occasions, altogether about twenty in number; I had not before a
conception of the stateliness and grandeur of these birds.<br>
<br>
"There is not many kangaroos in that portion of the country which
I examined, but those I did fall in with are the largest I have
ever seen, and they are very swift of foot.<br>
<br>
"There are large birds of the crane kind, and the wild goose,
black swans, wild ducks and teals, in abundance and they are all
with the exception of the quails, very wild and difficult to get
at. There are wild native dogs which appear to me to be a
description of small wolf, and I fear great watchfulness will be
necessary to protect the sheep from their
depredations."</blockquote>
<p>On the chart accompanying Wedge's description, we have the
river "Yaroyaro" marked. The "Weariby" runs up in a N.W.
direction; and a little to the east of the point to which it is
traced is "Mount Bunyinyoke," which is about in the position of
Mount Blackwood. Just to the N.W. of Mount Villumanata, Station
Peak, are "Yowwham Hills," a short distance to the west of which
we find "Onnikie Yamwham Hills". At the site of Geelong
"Cayariya" is marked, and at the other side of a small stream,
which stands in the position of Cowie's Creek, the name Gurweeth
is inscribed. The upper part of the Barwourne, as it is written,
is called the River Yaloak. This is joined close to the Cayariya
by a river, which is formed some distance up by the junction of
the River Leigh and the River Byron. The Barrabull Hills are
marked and close to them Lake Modewarrie, and, running a little
to the south of this is the Biouvac rivulet, which enters the sea
a little to the west of the Barwourne. The other names of places
mentioned on the chart are Mount Montac, close to or forming part
of the Barrabull Hills, and to the south a place called Erip near
the coast; close to Indented Head the Bellarine Hills are marked,
and two places named Noondeit and Urnawillock. On the bay,
between where Williamstown now is and the mouth of the Werribee,
is a place marked Marung, and on the plains to the north of
Station Peak is Diabuggorita. Wedge's track crosses the Weariby
close to where it is joined by another stream, in a locality
which would nearly correspond with that of Bacchus' Marsh. The
site of Melbourne is neither named nor delineated on this
chart.</p>

respecting "the plan of the country which Mr. Wedge has presented
to me&mdash;it will afford the Secretary of State some idea of
the fine tract of sheep-land upon which Messrs. Batman have
'squatted'&mdash;and I have great pleasure in adding that another
still more extensive tract of fine open country has been lately
discovered, situated between Port Phillip, and Portland Bay,
where Mr. Henty has established himself without so far as I know
any authority."</p>

<blockquote>"Narrative of an Excursion amongst the Natives of
Port Phillip on the South Coast of New Holland. By J.H.
Wedge.<br>
<br>
"On landing at Port Phillip on the 7th of August, 1835, at the
encampment of the party left for the purpose of maintaining the
friendly intercourse which had been established with the
Aborigines of that part of New Holland, I found seven families of
the natives residing in their huts around. The greater part of
their tribe was absent at the time on a hunting excursion; but a
boy came down with the white men to welcome us on our
arrival;&mdash;an old man (Pewitt) and his two wives were at the
huts, together with some young girls, who had been promised in
marriage to the Sydney natives left by the first party. I soon
learnt that the most friendly understanding existed with the
natives&mdash;indeed I scarcely needed this information, for it
was evident from the light-hearted playfulness of the boy and the
cheerfulness of the old man, and the vivacious loquacity of the
females, who came and shook hands with me on my arrival. They
were evidently desirous to inform me by signs that the families
who inhabited the several huts were out hunting and that they
would come home in the evening.<br>
<br>
"On the return of the various families with game which they had
obtained during the day, the members severally welcomed me by a
shake of the hand and a grin in their countenances devoid of
suspicion.<br>
<br>
The only married female of our party, and her four little
daughters, with whom the natives were much
delighted&mdash;particularly attracted their attention. Although
they brought home with them a plentiful supply of provisions,
consisting of various edible roots, kangaroo rats and calkeit
(the young ants in a fly state taken from hollow trees) yet they
soon began to importune us for bread and other things, not even
excepting the cutlery, from this I inferred at once that to
satisfy their newly acquired appetite for our food and other
things which we brought with us, such as knives, tomahawks and
blankets, was a sure way of conciliating them. In this conclusion
at which I arrived, I was fully confirmed by Buckley, who gave me
a general outline of the characters of the different natives as
they arrived, one of whom (Murradonnanuke) he pointed out as more
to be dreaded on account of his treachery than any of the other
chiefs. As one of the main objects I had in view, besides
examining the country was to make myself acquainted with the
habits and dispositions of the natives, I devoted the first few
days after my arrival to studying their characters;&mdash;for
this purpose I went out hunting with them daily and spent the
greater part of my time amongst them; I soon satisfied myself
that with a little tact and management, there was no danger to be
apprehended from them, although I learnt from Buckley that in the
treatment of each other they were treacherous. To command their
respect I found it was necessary to make them fully understand
that it was in our power not only to minister to their wants and
comforts, but amply to avenge any outrage. In impressing them
with this idea, Buckley was of great use to us by making known to
them the ample means we had of furnishing them with food,
blankets, &amp;c. and explaining the object we had in view in
settling amongst them, and our desire to be on friendly terms
with them, which was mainly compassed by evincing a confidence
devoid of fear in our deportment towards them, and by abstaining
from any act which might lead them to doubt the sincerity of our
intentions. I learnt from Buckley that they were cannibals, his
statement on this head was confirmed by the two youths who
attached themselves to me during my stay in New Holland, and who
accompanied me on the several excursions I made into the
interior, but they do not seem to indulge in this horrible
propensity except when the tribes are at war with each other,
when the bodies of those who are killed are roasted and their
bones are infallibly picked by the teeth of their enemy; of this
custom they make no secret, and on being questioned, speak of it
as a matter of course, and describe the mode of preparing the
victim for the repast. Disgusting as is this practice, the
process of which is too revolting to commit to paper, a still
more horrible one, if possible prevails&mdash;that of the mothers
destroying many of their infants at their birth&mdash;the cause
by which they appear to be thus influenced is the custom the
women have of nursing their children till they are three or four
years old; to get rid therefore, of the trouble and inconvenience
of finding sustenance for two, should a second be born before the
eldest is weaned, they destroy the youngest immediately after it
is born. Although this explanation was given me by
Buckley&mdash;and I have no doubt this is in most instances the
case, yet some women perpetrate the murder of their infants from
mere wantonness, and as it would seem to us, (and which is found
even in the brute creation)&mdash;a total absence of maternal
feeling.<br>
<br>
"One woman in particular, the wife of Nullaboin I think, was
pointed out to me who had destroyed ten out of eleven of her
children, one of whom she killed a few days previous to my
arrival at the port.<br>
<br>
"Notwithstanding the increase of the tribes is thus kept down.
Polygamy is common amongst them; few of the men having less than
two wives and some of them four or more. The women as is the case
with most savages are quite *** subservient to the men and are
kept in excellent discipline&mdash;Chastisement promptly follows
the least offence and a fire stick is not unfrequently the
instrument of correction. The wealth of the men may he said to
consist in the number of their wives, for the chief employment is
in procuring food for their Lords. On one occasion I was witness
to a scene that afforded me some amusement, although it was no
fun to the four women concerned. My attention was attracted by
the outcry of the women who were undergoing chastisement from
their husband (Murradonnanuke) who punished them by throwing fire
sticks at them in the most furious manner; on inquiring I learnt
that the only cause of their offence, arose from the poor
creatures not having brought home that evening a quantity of
provisions sufficient to satisfy his insatiable appetite. In the
regulations which prevail respecting their wives they have one
which seems to have some connexion with, or similar to the Mosaic
Law&mdash;on the death of a husband his wives, whatever be their
number, become the property of the eldest of his brothers, or his
next of kin. The men are jealous of their wives; should any
intrigue be discovered, it would probably lead to the death of
one or both of the offending parties, although if the husband
receives what he considers to be an adequate compensation he is
accommodating to his friends in allowing them the favours of his
wives, and I have understood that these indulgences are always to
be purchased by bestowing upon the husband a liberal supply of
food. The women are not allowed to have a voice on these
occasions, but must obey the dictates of their tyrants. I do not
believe that infidelity is frequent amongst the women, unless
sanctioned by the husband&mdash;during the whole time I was among
them, I never observed any advances or levity of conduct, on
their part, although it is not at all improbable that they are
restrained by the dread of the consequences that would ensue were
they to be detected in an illicit amour. In bestowing daughters
for wives, they are promised as soon as they are born, and on
these occasions the parents receive presents of food, opossum and
kangaroo rugs, dubs spears &amp;c. from the person to whom she is
betrothed; and this arrangement is considered to be binding,
although it sometimes happens that these promises are broken by
the parents, especially when the man, who has received the
promise belongs to another and distant tribe. When this occurs it
creates a feeling of enmity, and it is not unfrequently taken up
by the whole tribe, who make common cause with the aggrieved
party. If therefore determined on being revenged they never lose
sight of their object till they have satisfied themselves by a
general conflict with the tribe to whom the offending party
belongs, or it sometimes happens that the poor girl and the
husband are singled out, and at the dead of night the unerring
spear gives both a passport to that land where the inhabitants
live without hunting. Their revenge thus satiated, again they
become friends.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[*** "Although they are designated 'savages' in
contradistinction to ourselves who are called civilized beings
yet no people upon earth, in a state of nature so little deserve
the appellation, if kind-heartedness has any influence in our
minds in wiping away the stigma of our refined expression, which
in this narrative is merely used for the purposes of
description."]</p>
<blockquote>"The men are prohibited from looking at the mother of
the girl given them in marriage. This singular custom is observed
with the strictest caution, on passing the huts of the
mother-in-law, or any place where they suppose her to be, they
carefully turn their heads in another direction, and evince great
concern, if by any chance they should see her&mdash;although I am
not aware of any penalty being attached to the offence save that
of incurring the displeasure of the parents. On meeting with
Nullaboin I took notice that a young girl who had just entered
the married state carefully avoided to look at him for what
reason I can't divine, unless it was that the old man had been
promised her first daughter. From inquiries which I made on the
spot, I am induced to believe that feeling of enmity does not
exist permanently amongst the different tribes, as it is
terminated by a Battle Royal, something after the style of a row
at an Irish Fair.<br>
<br>
"A short time previous to my departure a few men with their wives
from an adjoining tribe came to that amongst whom I was living,
with an invitation to join them in a conflict which they
meditated with an adjoining tribe; they sent two or three young
men to the tribe to the westward, inviting them also to join in
their warlike excursion (or foray) on the occasion. I learnt that
this hostile feeling had been created by one of these men having
lost one of his eyes in a scuffle, with a man belonging to the
Western Port tribe, this accident happened about eight months
previously, and although the party who thus sought to avenge
himself was the aggressor, having wounded his antagonist with a
spear, he nevertheless had determined on having satisfaction, and
had succeeded in inducing his own tribe and that with which I was
living, and probably would influence the other also, to whom the
embassy of the young men had been despatched to espouse the cause
of his odd eye, in fighting for which some lives would in all
probability be lost, and a few heads broken, without enabling him
to see a whit the better. They also gave especial invitation to
the seven Sydney natives, and requested they would take their
guns with them. This of course I discouraged and I was not
without hopes that they might be induced through the influence of
Buckley to forego their intention of taking their revenge,
although from what he said I concluded there was not much chance
of such a result.<br>
<br>
"Buckley said the time of their meeting was very uncertain, that
it might happen in a week or two, or it might be put off for some
months, but that the collision was almost certain to take place
sooner or later. In these conflicts it does not often happen that
many lives are lost, seldom more than one or two, and frequently
all return from the fight alive, and no other mischief is done,
save a few heads broken, or an impression made on their coatless
backs by a club or spear, so expert are they in avoiding the
missiles of their opponents; all feeling of hostility ceases with
the battle and cordiality again prevails till it is interrupted
by the impulse of their feelings, which are extremely sensitive,
in fact they are nearly as pugnacious as though their birthplace
had been the Green Island.<br>
<br>
"Like others uncivilized and in a state of nature, they are
astonishingly dextrous in the use of weapons employed by them in
the defence of their persons, and in procuring food; and in
tracking each other, as well as the kangaroo, and other animals
they are very expert&mdash;the most trifling disarrangement of
the grass, a broken twig or the slightest thing which indicates
the direction of the object of pursuit is at once perceived by
them, and they follow the track with ease at a brisk
pace&mdash;on several occasions I witnessed their adroitness in
this respect. In fact their perceptions in seeing, hearing, and
smelling are surprisingly acute,&mdash;and in the pursuit of
their game, they evince that patient perseverance so peculiar to
man living in a state of nature.<br>
<br>
"Their food consists principally of kangaroo and other animals,
fish and roots of various sorts, black swans, ducks and many
other birds&mdash;and in fact there is scarcely any animal or
bird that comes amiss to them&mdash;and many reptiles, amongst
them a species of snake, come within their bill of fare. In their
appetites they are quite ravenous and the quantity they devour at
one meal, would astonish even a London Alderman, although they
are not quite so fastidious in the quality of their viands.<br>
<br>
"I could not learn that they have any religious observances, and
indeed from the information, I gathered from Buckley, I am led to
believe that they have no idea whatever of a Supreme Being,
although it is somewhat difficult to reconcile the fact of their
believing in a future state, for they certainly entertain the
idea that after death they again exist, being transformed into
white men. This is obviously a new idea since they have become
acquainted with us, and is an evidence that the friendly
intercourse we have established with them, will by degrees
operate upon their minds and gradually work an amelioration in
their condition&mdash;of this being ultimately effected I
entertain very sanguine expectations; and I think I am warranted
in doing so by the result of the experiments I made to induce
them to habits of industry, whilst residing amongst them. The men
on several occasions rendered assistance in carrying sods for the
erection of our huts, and many of the women were almost
constantly employed in making baskets during the last week or ten
days previous to my departure. In repayment for those and other
services I gave them bread on the completion of their task, with
which they were well satisfied and I have but little doubt if
proper arrangements were made and attention paid that great
progress might be made in a short time, towards establishing more
civilized habits. Their whole time may be said to be devoted to
procuring food during the day&mdash;all their thoughts seem to be
directed towards ministering to their appetites, the women are
the drudges of their husbands, and are seldom idle during the
day, being for the most part employed either in getting the
various edible roots, with which the country abounds, or in
making baskets and nets and any other occupation dictated by
their husbands.<br>
<br>
"Their habitations are of the most rude and simple construction,
the materials with which they are made being the branches of
trees laid with tolerable compactness and pitched at an angle of
about 45 degrees&mdash;in shape they form a segment of a circle,
and their size is in proportion to the number of inmates of which
the family is composed."</blockquote>

Port Phillip country from Mr. Wedge (who lately resigned his post
in my department on Colonel Arthur refusing him a month's leave
of absence). The natives appear very tractable, and open to
imbibe any habits that may be inculcated in them. To be sure they
are not of the most amicable manners,&mdash;the feeding on the
flesh of their enemies, and destroying their children on a
principle of economy being amongst their ordinary practices. Mr.
Wedge has been teaching them to make baskets, by rewarding the
industrious with increased rations. This is all very well while
it lasts, but the first outrage committed by a white man will
destroy the friendly feeling and then superior force must be the
social standard. What will the King's Government do with regard
to these volunteering settlers of Port Phillip? I fancy that they
will be allowed to keep the tracts of land they have taken, on
paying some moderate sum per acre.<br>

of some sort,&mdash;and I suppose you will send thither a
resident and a small government establishment.<br>
<br>
"It promises to be a fine sheep country but although there are
many large rivers, streamlets are few, and it cannot be termed a
well watered country. Of fuel the greatest deficiency exists and
it is plain that even the first inhabitants will suffer great
inconvenience from this disadvantage."</blockquote>

<p>T<small>HE</small> romantic story of William Buckley&mdash;the
white man who, after living for upwards of thirty years with the

connected with the history of the colonization of Victoria as to
be clearly entitled to have a chapter devoted to it. All the
official documents on the subject, given in the next few pages,
are to be found in the Record Office, among the correspondence of
both the Colonies from which they came.</p>
<p>Mr. Wedge brings Buckley&mdash;who had appeared at the first
camp of the Colonists at Port Phillip a few days after their
arrival&mdash;under the notice of the Government of Tasmania, in

<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;In reference to the
Petition of William Buckley for a free pardon which I have the
honour to enclose herewith, I beg to bear testimony to the very
essential service he has rendered in becoming the means of
communication with the natives, and I have no hesitation in
saying that through him there is every probability of making
permanent the friendly intercourse that was commenced by Mr.
Batman in his recent excursion, already detailed by that
gentleman to the Government, with the natives, and from the
circumstance of his having saved the lives of the eight men left
here by Mr. Batman, together with the circumstance of his having
made a voluntary offer of becoming in future the medium of
communication with the aborigines, I beg most earnestly to
recommend his petition to the favourable consideration of His
Excellency the Lieut. Governor; and in doing so I scarcely need
advert to the danger that would ensue to the lives of those who
may in future reside here by his being driven to despair by the
refusal of his petition which would probably induce him to join
the natives again; and in which event there is no calculating on
the mischief that might ensue by the hostile feelings that he
would have it in his power to instil into the breasts of the
natives. I doubt not, as an act of humanity towards those who may
come to sojourn in this settlement, the above circumstance will
have weight in the consideration His Excellency will bestow on
the prayer of the Petition. If I may be allowed, I would
respectfully suggest that it should at once be conceded to him,
and his free Pardon sent by the next vessel that will be
despatched to this place.<br>
<br>
"Buckley is a most interesting character; from his long residence
amongst the natives he has acquired a great influence with them,
as well as their habits and language; in fact he had nearly
forgotten his native tongue, and it was some days before he could
express himself in it. The two men who absconded with him left
him before he joined the natives, and he has never seen or heard
of them since, he supposes they were killed by the natives.
Buckley is gigantic in size, measuring in height six feet five
inches and seven eighths without shoes, and of good proportions;
and I have no doubt but he is indebted for his life. to his
ferocious appearance. From the circumstances of his being obliged
to direct the whole of his attention to self-preservation, and to
procuring food for subsistence, his memory has almost altogether
failed him as to time and events which occurred previous to his
leaving England. He forgets the name of the vessel he came in, as
well as that of the Captain and the Commandant of the settlement.
From his information the natives are in the lowest grade of
ignorance, having no idea of a Supreme Being. Although I have
had, as jet but a short intercourse with them I am inclined to
give credence to his statement. The few days I have been here I
have devoted to studying their character, and I have acquired
sufficient confidence in them to trust myself amongst them. I
went a circuit of about twenty miles with them
yesterday.</blockquote>

Supplementary Militia about two years, when he volunteered into
the 4th Regiment of the Foot or King's Own, of which Regiment he
was attached to the third Batallion and continued therein between
two and three years, during which time he accompanied that
Regiment in an expedition to Holland.<br>
<br>
"That your Petitioner was afterwards convicted of receiving
stolen property and was transported for life.<br>
<br>
"That your Petitioner arrived at Port Phillip, New Holland, about
thirty years ago, and on the breaking up of the establishment
your Petitioner with two others (the name of one was William
Marmon) absconded and subsisted on the sea Coast for about 12
months, when he fell in with a family of natives with whom he has
continued up to the present time, that your petitioner has at
various times suffered great privations from the want of
food.<br>
<br>
"That your petitioner, previously to his joining the natives,
returned to Port Phillip with the intention of surrendering
himself to the authorities, but was prevented from doing so by
the departure of the establishment.<br>
<br>
"That your petitioner has never seen a white man since that
period until he came to the establishment formed by Mr. Batman,
Mr. Wedge, and other gentlemen in July 1835.<br>
<br>
"That your petitioner two days previously to joining the
establishment learnt from the natives that white men were in the
neighbourhood, and that they, with others, intended to spear
them, for the sake of the plunder which they would get.<br>
<br>
"That your petitioner remonstrated with them and dissuaded them
from their intentions. That your petitioner has ever since
exerted himself and has succeeded in convincing them of the
friendly disposition of the white men towards the natives.<br>
<br>
"That your petitioner will continue to do all in his power to
render permanent the good understanding that has been
established, for which services your petitioner humbly prays for
the indulgence of a Free Pardon.<br>
<br>
"And your petitioner will ever pray."</blockquote>
<p>The Colonial Secretary thus replies to the
petition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The undersigned acquaints William Buckley that
Lieut. Governor Arthur having had under his consideration the
subject of his Petition together with a letter from John H.
Wedge, Esq., in support thereof detailing the circumstances under
which he became connected with the natives of New Holland and
having also considered the laudable disposition evinced by
William Buckley to promote a friendly feeling amongst the
Aborigines towards the whites who have recently visited the Coast
of New Holland, His Excellency has been pleased to grant him a
free Pardon. The undersigned is however directed to impress upon
William Buckley that in granting this boon it is the expectation
of the Lieut. Governor that he will persevere in the same
conciliatory course which he has commenced with so much advantage
to the parties concerned and the cause of humanity
generally.</blockquote>

Lieut. Governor your letter of the 9th July last enclosing a
Petition from William Buckley a runaway convict recently
discovered at Port Phillip after having been for some years
domesticated with the natives of that part of the Coast of New
Holland, and His Excellency having considered the subject of your
representation of this man's conduct and the services he has
rendered in promoting a friendly disposition between the
Aborigines with whom he has been so long associated and the

far he is legally authorized to grant a free pardon to William
Buckley, as he is not within the jurisdiction of this Government,

considerations of policy the indulgence will be acceded to by His

any outrages upon the white immigrants, which might lay the
foundation of a war of extermination and His Excellency also
entertains the sanguine hope that if this man's energies and
influence be well devoted the Aborigines may be so thoroughly
conciliated as to ensure a lasting amity between them and the

<p>In a despatch of August 28th, 1835, to Lord Glenelg, Governor
Arthur also explains his reason for pardoning Buckley:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"With reference to my despatch of the 4th July last,
enclosing Mr. Batman's letter in elucidation of the circumstances
under which he had visited the opposite Coast of New Holland, in
furtherance of the views of an association on whose behalf he had
concluded a treaty with the natives for an extent of pasture land
in the vicinity of Port Phillip I have the honour to transmit for
your Lordship's perusal a letter which has been received from Mr
Wedge, one of these adventurers (a very respectable person
recently an officer in the Survey Department) in Dutergalla,
soliciting a free pardon for a man of the name of Buckley, who
had been with the Aborigines ever since 1803, having been one of
the convicts sent thither when Col. Collins endeavoured to form a
settlement on the Southern Coast of New Holland.<br>
<br>
"Buckley who is a man of extraordinary stature, after absconding
joined a tribe of Natives, with whom he has associated himself
for thirty two years and by whom he has long been acknowledged as
their chief. Notwithstanding Mr. Batman's pacific negotiations it
seems the Blacks had meditated an hostile attack upon the persons
he had left at Port Phillip&mdash;the execution of which was
prevented by Buckley's interposition, and hence Mr. Wedge has
expressed great anxiety that Buckley's petition for a pardon for
the offence for which he was so many years ago transported should
be granted.<br>
<br>
"No doubt whatever of course exists in my mind that the
Lieut.-Governor of this Colony has no lawful authority to grant a
pardon under such circumstances&mdash;but although I consider Mr.
Batman, Mr. Wedge, and their followers, to be nothing more or
less than unauthorized intruders, and to have consequently no
claim to protection,&mdash;I have nevertheless felt it to be my
duty at once to grant the prayer of Buckley's
Petition;&mdash;from very dear bought experience I know that such
a man at the head of a tribe of savages may prove a most
dangerous foe, and his good offices cannot be too soon
propitiated by an apparent act of grace,&mdash;a copy of the
instrument I issued, I have the honour to enclose,&mdash;and I
humbly beg to advise that His Majesty would be graciously pleased
to grant this man a pardon.<br>
<br>
"Your Lordship will perceive by the Colonial Secretary's
communication that care has been taken that the interference of
Government in this matter shall not be construed into any
recognition of the right of the association to establish a
settlement at Port Phillip;&mdash;and as, whatever the final
decision of His Majesty's Government with regard to the
disposition of the soil may be there can be no question it is of
infinite importance to establish friendly intercourse with the
aborigines, I hope the course I have pursued will meet with your
approbation."</blockquote>
<p>In a communication of the 22nd October, 1835, the Colonial
Secretary of New South "Wales acknowledges a letter of the
Colonial Secretary of Van Diemen's Land, dated the 5th
ultimo, "enclosing copies of communications from Mr. J.H. Wedge,
and a convict named William Buckley," and stating that Colonel
Arthur had acceded to the application of the latter for a pardon.
The Governor of New South Wales desires to inform the Governor of
Van Diemen's Land, that "he shall be glad to find that
Lieut.-Governor Arthur has obtained the good will of Buckley upon
such easy terms."</p>
<p>Colonel Arthur, in enclosing the following account of Buckley,
by Mr. Wedge, in his despatch to Mr. Hay, of January 28th, 1836,
remarks that it "contains some valuable suggestions as to the
mode of preserving the friendship of the natives." Mr. Wedge
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"William Buckley is a native of Morton near
Macclesfield in Cheshire and is now about fifty-five years old.
He entered the supplementary Militia of that county at an early
age, to the third Batallion of which he was attached; and in
about two years afterwards volunteered into the fourth Regiment
of the Line. He accompanied the army commanded by the late Duke
of York, to Holland, and soon after his return from that
expedition was convicted of mutiny and sentenced to
transportation for life. He arrived at Port Phillip in 1802 with
the detachment of Prisoners destined to form an establishment at
that place; and whilst there was employed at his trade of
stone-mason in assisting to erect a building for the reception of
Government stores. A short time previous to the abandonment of
the settlement by Governor Collins, he absconded with two other
men named Marmon and Pye. Whilst in the Bush the party
experienced great difficulty in procuring food, and suffered
great privations, their chief subsistence being cockles and
mussels which they picked up on the beach of Port
Phillip.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Note in the margin&mdash;"The offence for
which Buckley was transported was for mutiny, he with 6 others
having turned out to shoot the Duke of Kent at Gibraltar."]</p>
<blockquote>"Pye left his companions before they got to the river
at the Northern extremity of the Port. The natives having set
fire to the grass, afforded them the opportunity of obtaining
fire which they were afterwards careful to keep with them. His
other comrade (Marmon) continued with him till they had wandered
nearly round the Port, and then left him somewhere on Indented
Head, with the intention of returning to the establishment and
surrendering himself to the authorities; but whether he or Pye
succeeded in their object he cannot tell, as he never saw or
heard of them afterwards; he thinks it probable they fell in with
the natives and were killed by them. Continuing along the beach
by himself he completed the circuit of the Port and afterwards
proceeded a considerable distance along the Coast towards Cape
Otway. At this period repenting of the step he had taken, and
being tired of his precarious life, and in constant dread of
falling in with the natives he determined on returning to the
establishment.<br>
<br>
"Soon after he had returned to the neighbourhood of Indented Head
he fell in with the family of natives with whom he continued to
live till he joined the party left by Mr. Batman. His memory
fails him as to dates, but he supposes his falling in with the
natives to have occurred about twelve months after he left the
settlement. He was received with kindness by the natives who
supplied him with food. The name of the Chief or head of the
family was Nullaboin, to whom he attached himself; and he
continued with him and accompanied him in his wanderings till he
joined the party left by Mr. Batman on the 12th July 1835. From
the time he was abandoned by his comrades up to this period, a
lapse of three and thirty years&mdash;he had never seen a white
man. For the first few years of his sojourn with the natives his
mind and time were fully occupied in guarding against the
treachery of other natives whom they occasionally mixed with, and
in procuring food; and indeed this may have been said to be the
case ever afterwards, although from his having acquired a perfect
knowledge of their language, and become acquainted with their
habits, the danger to be apprehended from them latterly was not
so great, and not more so than was the case with the natives with
regard to each other, for he was entirely identified as one of
themselves. He, as is every other white person is known by the
name Ammijaic. The natives gave him a wife, but discovering that
she had a preference to another man, he relinquished her, but it
cost her and her paramour dearly&mdash;they were punished with
death for violating the custom which prevails&mdash;for when once
a female is promised as a wife, which generally happens as soon
as born, the promise is considered binding; and the individual
receiving the promise recompenses the parents with
presents&mdash;such as kangaroo or opossum rugs, shields, clubs,
and the like. Buckley has no family, legitimate or illegitimate.
During the whole course of his residence, and amidst all his
wanderings there were no interesting events, save the fact of his
having passed thirty three years of his life amongst savages, and
of his having retrograded from the habits of civilized life and
lapsed into those of the savage; for in fact he was one amongst
them, and except in cannibalism, he adopted their mode of life in
everything. Indeed, isolated as he was, and without the
necessaries of life to which he had been accustomed, or the means
of procuring them, it was scarcely possible for him to do
otherwise. Although to some it may appear strange that he should
not have introduced some improvement in their mode of life, yet
by those who have some experience by a residence in uncivilized
countries, the difficulty of doing so will be fully understood.
In fact as I have before said, his whole attention must have been
directed to self-preservation, both in procuring food and in
guarding against treachery. For an individual situated as was
Buckley, to conciliate the natives, he must conform to their
customs&mdash;if they hunt he must hunt with them; and he must
participate in all their pastimes. If their condition is to be
ameliorated it must he by numbers and by force of example; by
becoming acquainted with the comforts of civilization may he
likely to lead them to be desirous of partaking thereof.<br>
<br>
"Although Buckley was always anxious to return amongst his
countrymen, he had for many years lost all hope of having an
opportunity of doing so.<br>
<br>
"The circumstances which led to his discovering the party left by
Mr. Batman in his neighbourhood, were that two of the natives
having stolen an axe, and being told by some of the natives that
had been longer at the establishment than themselves, that they
would be punished for the theft, they went away and on falling in
with Buckley told him that white men were in the neighbourhood,
and also the cause of their coming away from them, and intimated
that they would induce other natives to join them for the purpose
of returning to spear the white men. Buckley dissuaded them from
making the attempt, stating that there were a great many white
men where they came from, and that if any of the white men were
killed, numbers would come and kill every black man that they
could find. Thus intimidated they abandoned their intention.
Buckley then went in search of Mr. Batman's party, and in two
days joined them. They were living in a sod hut which they had
built and several native families were encamped about them. On
Buckley's coming to the place he was observed by one of the men,
and it was with no little surprise, if not with a mixture of
fear, that he and the other men contemplated the approach of a
man so gigantic in appearance and whose general aspect, erect as
he was and enveloped in his kangaroo skin rug, with his long
beard and a head of hair of thirty-three years' growth, and
bearing his spears, shield and clubs, was well calculated to
instil fear into any one; but on this as well as on many other
occasions during their intercourse with the natives, they showed
great tact and presence of mind by not evincing fear if they felt
any. They were impressed with the belief that Buckley was the
head chief, and were doubtful whether he was peaceably inclined
or not. Buckley went direct to the native encampment and sat
himself down amongst them, apparently taking but little notice of
the white men. They, however, went to him, and soon recognized
the features of an European; and on questioning him, with some
difficulty learnt who he was. He could not then express himself
in English, and on being asked questions he only repeated them as
do all savages&mdash;at least all that I have fallen in
with,&mdash;and it was about ten days before he could so collect
himself as to express himself with any degree of fluency in his
own language, and it not unfrequently happened that he put and
answered questions in the language of the natives. Buckley in
height is six feet six inches without shoes&mdash;is well
proportioned, with an erect military gait. He subsisted, in
common with the natives, on roots of various sorts, fish kangaroo
and any other animals that chance brought in his way. Although
his life was a wandering one, yet he resided principally on the
sea coast, and in the neighbourhood of Indented Head; and never
migrated far except I think upon one occasion only, when he went
about one hundred and fifty miles to the westward of Port
Phillip. On one occasion Buckley accompanied me on an excursion
for a week, during which he fell in with the family that he had
lived with. If I had any doubts as to the fact of his never
having seen a white man during his residence with the natives
(and I confess, knowing that the sealers were in the habit of
sometimes visiting this part of the coast, I was not without them
at first) they were now entirely removed. Nullaboin and his
family had never seen a white man, till he saw me, he viewed and
examined me with great curiosity, opening my waistcoat and shirt,
to ascertain whether the whole of my body was white. The women
were equally curious, much more so than is consistent with our
notions of female delicacy. They were very attached to Buckley,
and both Nullaboin and his wife cried bitterly when he left
them.<br>
<br>
"Buckley resides at present at the settlement formed by the
gentlemen who have associated to form a new Colony through the
means of the friendly intercourse established with the
Aborigines, and he has expressed his intention of remaining for
the purpose of being the medium of communication with the
natives. On receiving his conditional pardon, which His
Excellency the Lieut.-Governor so humanely and promptly granted
him on being made acquainted with his case, as a reward for his
meritorious conduct in preventing the natives from attacking the
white men, his feelings were powerfully excited, so much so, that
it was some time before he had the power of utterance. Never
shall I forget the joy that beamed in his countenance when I
communicated that he was a free man, and again received within
the pale of civilized society.<br>
<br>
"In desiring me to convey his grateful acknowledgments to the
Lieut.-Governor for his kindness, and to the gentleman who had
interested himself in his behalf he was powerfully agitated, and
if ever man was sincere in giving vent to his feelings, Buckley
was so in expressing his thanks on this occasion."</blockquote>
<p>Among the papers in the Record Office, relating to Collins'
settlement at Port Phillip in 1803-4, the author has not
discovered the name of Wm. Buckley in any list of prisoners
except in a return of "Persons victualled at full allowance", in
which '"Time commenced", is put down October 17th, 1803, "Time
discharged" December 27th, and "No. of days victualled" 72.
Buckley is described as a prisoner. December 27th was the day the
convicts escaped. His name also appears in the "Clothing List
from 16th October to 31st December, 1804."</p>
<p>With a despatch of November 19th, 1837, Sir Richard Bourke
transmits a petition of Wm. Buckley to the Governor, praying as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That he may receive the indulgence of a grant of
land, or such other assistance, as to your Excellency may seem
fitting, in order that your petitioner may not in his old age he
reduced to distress. Your Petitioner presumes not to make this
request on the ground of his own deserts, but on the circumstance
of his having during a period of thirty two years resided amongst
the natives of Port Phillip; without ever during that period seen
a white man.&mdash;And also your Petitioner respectfully sheweth
that on the arrival of the party who first commenced sending
stock and settling on the said Territory of Port Phillip, your
Petitioner was instrumental in explaining the nature and object
of their being there, and by this means inducing an amicable
understanding between them. That your Petitioner from his age,
and his having been separated from civilized life, during thirty
two years, is unable to gain his livelihood, as others are; and
further he has by joining his countrymen, so far displeased (his
adopted countrymen during thirty-two years) the natives of Port
Phillip, that he could not with that safety, comfort, or
satisfaction, which be hitherto enjoyed again join them, he
therefore most earnestly and respectfully entreats the humane
consideration of your Excellency to his very peculiar case,"
&amp;c.</blockquote>
<p>In forwarding the petition, the Governor remarks that Buckley
"obtained presents and a salary of seventy-five pounds a year
from the Port Phillip Association, which salary is continued to
him by this government. He asks in addition for a grant of land,
and appears to apprehend destitution in his old age. He has,
however, been very carefully attended to and provided with
everything needful, and as his services with the aborigines are
sometimes required at a distance from the settlement he has had a
horse given to him. I believe he would wish in future to be
exempted from any duty, and as he is growing old and in
consideration of the services he has rendered as an interpreter
and mediator, I beg leave to recommend that he be allowed a
pension of one hundred pounds a year, and receive a gratuity of
one year in advance."</p>
<p>Lord Glenelg, in reply to Sir G. Gipps, June 4th, 1838,
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"To the application for a grant of land I must in any
case have returned a decided refusal, but I confess that in the
present instance I do not see any sufficient reason to justify
the grant of a pension as suggested by Sir R. Bourke. Buckley has
already obtained presents and a salary of &pound;75 a year for
services which he has rendered, but especially when taken in
connexion with his former history they do not appear to me
sufficient to warrant any further remuneration from the
public."</blockquote>
<p>According to Buckley's own statement **&mdash;which is often
far from clear&mdash;his memory, especially as to time, being
very defective&mdash;he was born at Macclesfield in 1780 and
brought up a bricklayer, after receiving a small amount of
education. He, however, did not long continue at his trade.
Having served some time in the Cheshire Militia, he entered the
4th regiment, the King's Own, with which he went to Gibraltar and
fought in Holland, under that Earl of Chatham whose fame, unlike
his father's, is derived from having on one occasion done
nothing&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[** Buckley's narrative, as told by himself, has
been put into a readable form by Mr. Morgan, in his "Life and
Adventures of Buckley," published at Hobart Town in 1852, from
which the following facts have been chiefly gathered.]</p>
<p class="poem">"The Earl of Chatham with sword drawn<br>
Was waiting for Sir Richard Strachan;<br>
While Sir Richard, longing to be at 'em,<br>
Was waiting for the Earl of Chatham."</p>
<p>Buckley returned to England re-enlisted, receiving a bounty,
the army authorities gladly retaining him in the service on
account of his height&mdash;six feet five. Soon afterwards he was
tried, convicted, and sentenced to transportation for some
offence, the nature of which is not mentioned in Mr. Morgan's
book, though the same statement as that given in Mr. Wedge's
account was current in Australia&mdash;namely, that he had been
concerned, when at Gibraltar, in an attempt against the life of
the Duke of Kent. He was one of the convicts landed by Collins at
Port Phillip in October, 1803. On the night of December the 27th,
according to Collins' despatch of February 28th, 1804, and the
diary of the Rev. Mr. Knopwood, six convicts attempted to escape;
one of them was stopped by a shot from a sentry, which wounded
him severely, another was also captured, and a third surrendered;
but three succeeded in making their escape. One of these was
Buckley.</p>
<p>His account is that the runaways, on taking to the bush,
entertained some wild idea of going overland to Sydney, through
hundreds of miles of the uncolonized and unexplored territory.
They had with them some food, and a few things, among others a
kettle, which they soon threw away, and, singular to say, it was
picked up more than thirty years afterwards. Buckley and his two
companions wandered round Port Phillip Bay, crossing the Yarra a
day or two after their escape. The supply of food which they had
taken with them soon becoming exhausted, they were obliged to
subsist on shell-fish, which they picked up on the shore, and on
gum, found on some of the trees. At length, travelling round to
the western side of the bay, to where it becomes narrow near the
Heads, they saw the Calcutta lying near the eastern shore, some
three or four miles from them. By this time the privations and
hardships they had endured convinced them of the folly of what
they had done, and though fearing punishment much, if they should
again become prisoners, they feared starvation more; so for six
days they did all they could to attract the notice of the people
on board the <i>Calcutta</i>, by lighting fires at night, and
hoisting shirts on trees by day. At last, to their great joy,
they saw a boat moving off from the <i>Calcutta</i>, and coming
towards them; but when it had reached about half way over, to
their despair it turned round and went back to the vessel. Unable
longer to hope for rescue from the man-of-war, Buckley's two
companions thought they had better walk round the bay again and
give themselves up at the settlement; but he, being of a
different opinion, let them go, taking with them the gun the
party had carried off. He never saw or heard anything more of
them, nor has their fate ever been ascertained. "Whenever
Buckley, who was far from a bright man, was asked about them, he
never could or would give any more information, and it seemed
always disagreeable to him to be spoken to upon the subject.</p>
<p>And now Buckley was a lone man&mdash;likely never again to
behold the face of a civilized beings but to meet death from the
hand of the first savage who might see him. He soon lost count of
time. On the first day of his solitary wanderings he came in
sight of a camp of about a hundred blacks. Seeing some of them
coming towards where he was, he ran off, and in swimming a river,
extinguished a fire-stick he carried with him; and consequently
he had for some time to endure the privation of being without
fire, until he at length came upon a camp-fire left by the
blacks, at which he lighted another stick. He lived for some
months after this at a place, with the native name of Nooraki,
where he made himself a kind of hut in a hollow of a rock by the
shore. One day, however, some blacks discovered him, and brought
him off to their camp, where he remained for the night. In the
morning he refused to accompany them where they were going, or to
give them one of his old, worn-out stockings&mdash;which they
seemed much to fancy&mdash;as a pledge that he would remain till
their return. When they were gone he went off, and continued
alone for some time. Finding himself without food, he repented
leaving the blacks, who had seemed disposed to treat him well,
and resolved if possible to rejoin them. In trying to do so, he
got lost in the bush, and was for three days without food. At
night his fire attracted wild dogs, or dingoes, as they are
called, and opossums, which made a great noise around him.</p>
<p>After this he went to the coast, in hope of being rescued by
some passing vessel. One day, being caught by the tide be climbed
a cliff into a cavern, which was partially flooded at high water.
Here he passed the night. While in this place some monsters of
the deep came in at the entrance of what had been their
undisturbed retreat; but, on a noise being made by the strange
intruder, they speedily plunged back again into the sea.</p>
<p>How long this solitary existence lasted Buckley could not say.
Desiring to terminate it, he again started in search of the
blacks, and soon came upon the grave of a native chief, who had
been slain. The warrior's spear was stuck in it. Taking the
weapon with him, Buckley proceeded on his way, and, in a day or
two becoming exhausted, lay down and fell asleep. He was found in
this condition by the blacks, who brought him to their camp, and
treated him very kindly&mdash;giving him gum and water, and fine
fat grubs, which are found in the rotten roots of dead trees and
considered great delicacies by the aborigines.</p>
<p>To the possession of the spear Buckley ascribes the kindness
he received; for, it being the belief of the blacks that after
death they will, as they express it, "jump up white fellow," they
concluded that he was their departed chief come to life again.
They accordingly called him by that worthy's
name&mdash;Murrangurk. The brother of the deceased, convinced of
his fraternity, admitted him to share the family mia mia with
himself, his wife, and son. For some time Buckley doubted the
continuance of this good reception. He could not make out the
extraordinary demeanour of his new friends. The tribe surrounded
him, the men beating their breasts and heads with clubs, and the
women tearing out their hair by handfuls. This, he afterwards
discovered, was by way of lamentation for the sufferings they
supposed he had undergone when killed. A great corroboree, or
native dance, also took place.</p>
<p>Another version of his discovery by the natives, slightly
differing from that of Mr. Morgan, above given, represented him
as being found sitting or lying upon the mound beneath which one
of the tribe had been buried.</p>
<p>Buckley could now no longer complain of solitude, though
unable to boast of his society. He acquired the aboriginal
language, and learned to use the native weapons and to live as a
black. He relates how he was often disgusted by the frequent
serious and mortal encounters between different tribes, and the
murders which took place,&mdash;almost always on account of the
fair sex. He states also that many of the natives were cannibals,
under "particular circumstances," such as in two instances he
mentions,&mdash;one where, by way of revenge they ate part of a
man they had killed, and another where they partook of a portion
of one of their murdered friends, out of respect for the
deceased. Buckley expressed horror at these proceedings, and
frequently acted as peacemaker. The blacks took great care of
him&mdash;on going to fight making him keep to the rear. He
continued with them a long time, wandering from place to place,
as their habit was, and never remaining long in any locality;
until at length his supposed brother, sister-in-law, and nephew,
with whom he had so long resided, were all cruelly murdered. This
event caused him deep grief. He says he wept for hours, and never
suffered more distress of mind during his strange wanderings; for
from these poor savages he had received the greatest kindness
they could show a near relative. This horrible event so completed
his disgust with the blacks that he left them. In a few days,
however, meeting some of them, who told him that the remains of
his friends had been burned, he went to the place, and carefully
collecting the ashes, buried them.</p>
<p>After this he went off to the coast&mdash;again hoping for the
chance of being rescued by some passing ship, and lived by
himself for a year, or perhaps two, in a dwelling he made close
to a stream, where, by means of a weir, he was able to catch
plenty of fish. Karaaf is the name of the place, which is shown,
three or four miles from the fashionable watering-place of
Queenscliff, which stands on the west shore of Port Phillip Bay
close to the Heads.</p>
<p>Some of the blacks discovered his retreat, and after a time he
returned to live with the tribe, but again left them in disgust,
and went back to his residence at Karaaf, where some blacks
visited him. He tells the extraordinary story, that they
compelled him to take a wife, a widow of the tender age of
twenty. Why they should have obliged him to do so then, and not
previously, he does not say. He was soon deprived of his bride,
for the blacks again visited him and carried her
off&mdash;seemingly not much to her concern and certainly little
to his grief, as he confesses. He continued for some time to live
alone till another black woman came to him. For some time he took
care of a blind native boy, until the poor fellow was
murdered.</p>
<p>One day Buckley met some blacks near Indented Head, carrying a
flag which they informed him they had taken from a small ship, to
which they had swum out, while the people belonging to it were on
shore. Buckley hastened off to the place, but found the ship had
been moved further out from land. He endeavoured to induce some
of the people on board to come to him, but was quite unable to
call out to them in his mother tongue. At night he lighted a
fire, but they evidently thought he was a native who hoped to
entice them ashore to fall into the hands of his tribe. Next day
a boat put off, and as it approached land he renewed his signals.
It came within three hundred yards, and then, turning off,
steered along the coast, on which the men landed two or three
miles off. Buckley hastened in the direction, arriving at the
spot just as the boat was moving away with some wood, which the
people on board had cut; and, to his dreadful disappointment,
though he was so near to them, they would not wait to hold any
communication with him, but went off, "laughing at my violent
gesticulations and unintelligible cries, little thinking who I
was, or that I was any other than I appeared to be in my native
dress"&mdash;to quote the words in which Mr. Morgan dresses
Buckley's account of the circumstance.</p>
<p>All hope of present rescue being over, it occurred to him that
the men might have dropped something that would be of use to him;
so, looking about where they had been, he discovered a place
where the ground had been recently opened and filled up. Removing
the earth, in hope of making a discovery of value, he at length
came upon the body of a white man wrapped in a blanket. His first
thought was to take this shroud, which would have been of great
use to him. He could not, however, bring himself to do so, but
left it with the corpse and again filled up the grave.</p>
<p>Some time after this, he came upon an eight-oared boat lying
on the beach, rigged with blankets for sails, and was told by
some blacks that they had met two white men and tried to inform
them of his being in the neighbourhood; but, that after the
strangers had remained with them some days and recovered their
strength by being well fed, they had gone off by themselves.
Buckley heard some months afterwards, that they had been murdered
by the blacks near the Yarra.</p>
<p>A learned theory respecting the support of the earthy
entertained by the tribe with which Buckley sojourned, is thus
given in his Life by Mr. Morgan:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"They (the aborigines) have a notion that the world
is supported by props, which are in the charge of a man who lives
at the furthest end of the earth. They were dreadfully alarmed on
one occasion when I was with them, by news passing from tribe to
tribe, that unless they could send him a supply of tomahawks for
cutting some more props with, and some more rope to tie them
with, the earth would go by the run, and all hands would be
smothered. Fearful of this, they began to think, and enquire and
calculate, where the highest mountains were, and how to get at
them and on them so as to have some chance of escape from the
threatened danger. Notwithstanding this forethought, they set to
provide the needful and succeeded in this way. Passing on the
word to the tribes along the coast some settlers at a very great
distance were robbed of axes, and saws and rope, and tires of
dray wheels all of which were forwarded on from tribe to tribe,
to the old gentleman on the other side, and as was supposed in
time to prevent the capsize, for it never happened. A tribute of
this description is paid whenever possible; but who the knowing
old juggling receiving thief is, I could never make
out."</blockquote>
<p>Passing over much that is told of Buckley, one day he met two
blacks with coloured handkerchiefs, which they informed him had
been given them by three white men, who with six blacks were in
two white houses, and that they had been left by a
"koorong"&mdash;a ship&mdash;which had gone away. His informants,
Buckley stated, also told him they were going to collect the
tribe to make an attack on the whites. Buckley started off in the
direction in which they were described to be, and, after a long
journey, at length caught sight of the Union Jack floating from a
pole. He approached the tents, and sat down near
them&mdash;thinking how he should introduce himself&mdash;and on
perceiving he was observed, went forward. The whites could not
make him out. They seemed astonished at his complexion, height,
and appearance. He could not speak or understand a word of
English. At length, some bread being offered him, and the word
pronounced, he was able to repeat it. He showed the letters W.B.
on his arm, and it is related by one of the white men that after
they had several times said "W for William and B for Burgess," he
said "W for William and B for Buckley;" and thus it was
ascertained that he was English.</p>
<p>He from that time remained with the new arrivals, who proved
to be Batman's party. When the blacks found he had left them,
they informed him that they intended to attack the whites, and
would kill him as well as them if he would not side with the
tribe. He at first pretended to consent, in order to keep them
from their purpose, and advised them to postpone it till the
return of Batman&mdash;who having landed the first detachment of
his party, had gone back to Tasmania for the rest&mdash;when
there would be more booty to plunder. He did not at first tell
the whites, being unwilling to excite them against the blacks. On
the latter becoming impatient at Batman's not returning as soon
as they expected, Buckley warned the colonists, and told the
blacks that he would be against them if they were hostile, but
that they should have presents if they behaved well. No
aggression was ever attempted by the natives upon Batman's party;
on the contrary they were always so very quiet, that Buckley's
story has been pronounced, unreliable by some very good
authorities among the early colonists.</p>
<p>On returning in the <i>Rebecca</i>, Batman found the
mysterious stranger with his party, and was informed by him that
he had come to the country about twenty years before, in a ship,
the name of which he had forgotten; whereas it was thirty-two
years since he had arrived by the <i>Calcutta</i> in
1803&mdash;so far was he out in his reckoning of time. The
<i>Rebecca</i> went back almost immediately to Van Diemen's Land;
and returned, bringing a pardon for Buckley from Governor Arthur,
dated, according to Mr. Morgan, August 21st * 1835; and he
continued to act as interpreter to the party.</p>
<p class="foot">[* We have seen it was the 28th.]</p>
<p>Soon afterwards the camp of the expedition was removed to
Melbourne, where he entered the service of Captain Lonsdale, who
came down from Sydney with&mdash;singular to say&mdash;a
detachment of Buckley's old regiment. He also acted as constable,
and accompanied Governor Bourke in a short expedition he made on
visiting the settlement; he also took part in the search for
Gellibrand and Hesse.</p>
<p>Feeling he was not trusted as he thought he should have been,
Buckley left Port Phillip in 1837, and went over to Tasmania,
where he was presented to the Governor, Sir John, and to Lady
Franklin. He was made store-keeper at the Immigrant's Home
shortly after, and subsequently gate-keeper at the Female
Nursery. He held the latter employment until 1852, when he was
put on a pension of twelve pounds a year, to which the Government
of Victoria added an annuity of forty pounds. This income he
enjoyed until his death, on February 2nd, 1856, which resulted
from being thrown out of a cart. Not long after going to Tasmania
he married a widow with one daughter.</p>
<p>Such are the chief incidents of a real career as romantic as
the imaginary adventures of Robinson Crusoe. It is to be
regretted that Buckley was a dull man, with such a bad memory;
for there have, doubtless, been lost many incidents of his bush
life, which would have greatly enhanced the interest and value of
his biography. Defoe could not have had a better foundation upon
which to have built a work of fiction.</p>
<p>Little inferior in interest to Buckley's life with the blacks
of Victoria was the more recent sojourn of a man named Morrill
with those of Queensland.</p>

colonization.</p>
<p>A<small>N</small> account of the part taken by John Pascoe
Fawkner now falls into its proper place in the order of our
history of the colonization of Port Phillip. It is somewhat
remarkable, that in the Record Office papers, the name of the
founder of Melbourne is scarcely mentioned. One letter from him
exists, strongly opposing the claims of Batman and his
Association, and in no measured terms attacking some of its
members. The following particulars have, therefore, been drawn
from various sources&mdash;the author being able to add but
little to already published information respecting Fawkner's
share in the work of colonizing Victoria.* That little, however,
the author ventures to think, decides the question as to
Fawkner's claim to the title of founder of Melbourne.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Besides other sources of information
indicated, the author has drawn a considerable portion of his
facts respecting Fawkner's expedition from the writings of Mr.
Bonwick, Mr. Westgarth, and Mr. Rusden.]</p>
<p>Batman had only just initiated the natives into the mysteries
of English conveyancing, with a success which afforded cause for
self-congratulation, when Port Phillip Bay, which his party began
to consider their own, was entered by the <i>Enterprise</i>,
fifty-ton schooner, bearing the rival expedition of John Pascoe
Fawkner. Shortly after Batman&mdash;whom it has been said he
wanted to join&mdash;had commenced his colonizing preparations,
Fawkner also began to organize a party in Van Diemen's Land,
which consisted of Captain Lancey, George Evans, Robert Hay Marr,
W. Jackson, James, a blacksmith, and Wyse, a ploughman. By the
middle of July, 1835, Fawkner's party was ready to put to sea;
but a storm driving them back, they were unable finally to set
out until August 4th. The expedition then embarked under the
command of Captain Lancey, Fawkner being prevented by
indisposition from accompanying it. The <i>Enterprise</i> reached
Western Port on the 7th; the party, however, not being pleased
with the look of the country, steered on the 15th towards Port
Phillip Heads, which were entered next day. After spending a few
days in taking soundings, and sending a boat up the river as far
as the site of Melbourne, the <i>Enterprise</i> proceeded on the
29th up the Yarra Yarra. She had previously gone up the Saltwater
River for a short distance, mistaking it for the main branch of
the stream.</p>
<p>About eight miles up the Yarra, some falls of slight elevation
prevented the little craft from advancing further, and she was
moored on the 30th just opposite where the Melbourne Custom House
now stands. At this part of the river the banks were picturesque
and the scenery, consisting of small hills or rises lightly
timbered, presented an English park-like appearance, such as
distinguishes the open forest country, which is one of the
peculiar features of Australian landscape. The site was selected
in accordance with the instructions of Fawkner, whose previous
experience&mdash;he having been a boy or youth in Collins'
expedition in 1803-4,&mdash;made him careful to direct his
comrades to establish themselves only in a place possessing a
good and permanent supply of fresh water; and on his arrival, on
October 10th, he approved of the selection. The expedition lost
no time in establishing itself and beginning to cultivate the
soil.</p>
<p>According to one account the <i>Enterprise</i> was seen
entering the Bay by Batman's party at Indented Head; according to
another that one of them unexpectedly came upon her lying in the
Yarra; but, however it may have been, the rival colonists had
scarcely settled themselves on the banks of the Yarra, when one
of Batman's party came and ordered them off the land claimed by
the Association. They, however, refused to go; and, in September,
1835, according to Arden, the Batmanites changed head-quarters
from Indented Head to the vicinity of the rival camp&mdash;taking
up their position on a pleasant little hill close to the Yarra,
long known as Batman's Hill. A quarter of a century ago this was
a fashionable promenade, where a military band played once or
twice a week; but a few years later, this historic hill was
handed over to navvies, and cut away, in order that some
improvements might be carried out. It certainly deserved more
consideration.</p>
<p>Shortly after their rivals had established themselves in their
vicinity, the Fawknerites removed to the opposite, the south side
of the Yarra, where the furrows of a large field, cultivated by
the founder of Melbourne, were long visible. Although it is to be
regretted that Fawkner always spoke of Batman and his party with
considerable asperity, the hostility of the two sets of colonists
seems soon to have died away, as they found it impossible to keep
the place to themselves; for the reports of their success and of
the available nature of the country, soon attracted other people
to the new settlement. Even with Fawkner's expedition Mr. John
Aitkin, the first Victorian squatter, came over from Tasmania on
his own account, in a schooner called the
<i>Endeavour</i>&mdash;bringing some sheep, with which he
commenced what turned out a most successful squatting career.</p>
<p>The following statement respecting his expedition was made by
Fawkner in the <i>Argus</i> of September 12th, 1868.</p>
<blockquote>"Melbourne completed its thirty-third year on
Saturday last. On the 29th of August, 1835, the first landing
took place on a small rising ground, on which our tent was
pitched on the evening of August 29th. Our horses were then
landed and sent to graze. Early in 1835 I resolved to attempt to
settle in Port Phillip, having been one of those who landed on
Point Nepean from the <i>Calcutta</i>, under Governor David
Collins, to colonize at Port Phillip. This was on October 19th,
1803. Governor Collins declared the place unfit for settlement,
and took the whole of the people to the Derwent. I sought out
some friends to come with me in 1835, and five persons agreed to
help to found the new colony. Their names were Robert Hay Marr,
William Jackson, Samuel Jackson, Captain John Lancey, and George
Evans. They all deserted me; some went away, and others took to
sheep-farming, and I alone remained to found the famous city of
Melbourne. I purchased a schooner, the <i>Enterprise</i>, to
bring my horses, cattle, and household goods; and in six days
after landing had five acres of land ploughed and sown with
wheat. This produced 100 bushels in January, 1836. A wilderness
in 1835, a fine flourishing colony in 1868, though only
thirty-three years old."</blockquote>
<p>Forty-three years have not yet elapsed since the falls of the
Yarra stopped the <i>Enterprise</i>, and Fawkner's party landed
on the quiet rural banks of the river. From that day all that was
rural and quiet rapidly began to pass away; first to give place
to a small hut village, soon to be expanded into a town; the town
into a bustlings crowded metropolis. It would have been a flight
of fancy far too high for sober imagination to have conceived on
that famous day, August 29th, 1835, when the placid waters of the
Yarra were ruffled by Fawkner's little ship, that they were so
soon to be disturbed by a ceaseless throng of vessels of various
sorts and sizes; that their purity was to be darkened by the
pollutions of trade; the fresh air of their banks contaminated by
smoke and steam&mdash;the atmosphere of commercial prosperity;
and the stillness of ages broken by the harsh screech of the
civilizing locomotive, and the many sounds of industry and
commerce. But here, as at many other points in early colonial
history, when we think of the pictures which fancy might have
painted, but never even ventured to sketch, we must remember
Burke's description of colonial progress&mdash;"fiction lags
after fact, invention is unfruitful, and imagination cold and
barren."</p>

<br>
<small>[Map of Port Phillip Bay and Batman's Tract of Land,
1835]</small></p>
<br>
<p>The question which colonists first saw and selected the site
of Melbourne seems never to have been finally set at rest, though
the evidence for determining it appears conclusive. There exists
in the Record Office a map delineating Port Phillip Bay, and
Batman's tract of land, having inscribed upon it the words "In
Col. Arthur's No. 53 of 4 July, 1835,"&mdash;the first despatch,
already given, reporting Batman's colonizing enterprise. The map
clearly delineates the country, and completely decides the
question which of the two founders of the settlements on Port
Phillip Bay first visited, and which selected, the site of
Melbourne. From the accompanying extract from this chart of
Batman's, it will be observed that he had selected an extensive
reserve for a township, reaching about as far as Sandridge. Only
a portion, less than a third of the whole area, is on the north
side of the Yarra, which is called River Batman. Its limits
extend from the junction of the Saltwater River, and the northern
and eastern boundary-lines just take in the lagoon at the western
extremity of the present city so that certainly no part of its
site east of Spencer Street, is included in the reserve, though
the greater part, if not the whole, is within the area of the
extensive tract marked as purchased from the natives.</p>
<p>Batman evidently intended to have the town on the south side
of the river; for across the portion of the reserve, on the north
side is written "Extensive marsh reserved for a public common,"
whilst on that at the south are the words "Reserved for a
Township and other public purposes." It is clear, therefore,
that, though Batman first visited the site of Melbourne,
Fawkner's party selected it, and were the first to settle upon
it. The point at Williamstown is in the chart in the Record
Office called Point Harwood. The land between Geelong and Bass's
Strait is described, as "called Geelong by the natives," and the
elevation in the centre of it is named Wedge's Range. The largest
of the Station Peak Hills is marked as Mount Collicott, and the
two others Mounts Vilumanata and Cottrell.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mr. Rusden gives a similar chart in his
"Discovery of Port Phillip."]</p>
<p>It is satisfactory, therefore, that to the leaders of the
three expeditions which inaugurated the colonization of Port
Phillip, due credit for their respective shares in the great
enterprise can be fairly meted out. The Hentys were the very
first pioneers of the colony; Batman the first colonizer of the
shores of Port Phillip Bay, and Fawkner the founder of
Melbourne.</p>
<p>Until his death, on September 4th, 1869, Fawkner bore the
undisputed title of "the oldest inhabitant", being the only man
in the colony who had been in Collins's expedition. He continued
from the establishment of two houses of legislature in Victoria,
to be one of the representatives in the Upper House of the
electoral district in which Melbourne is comprised. He had
previously taken an active part in politics in the first
Victorian legislature, as well as before one was established, and
was always a straightforward politician. The <i>Argus</i> of
September 11th, 1869, in its memoir of him, states that he was
seventy-six years of age, having been born in London August 20th,
1792, that 228 carriages attended his funeral, and 10,000 or
12,000 people lined the streets through which it passed. Mr.
Edward Henty is the remaining survivor of the three founders of
the colony. The address presented to the Duke of Edinburgh on his
visit to Melbourne, by inhabitants of the colony of twenty-five
years' standing, was read by Mr. Henty, as the first founder of
Victoria; and Fawkner made some observations to the Prince on the
interesting occasion. It is to be regretted that Batman, the
other of the founders of Victoria, lived to see so little of the
progress of the settlement, and that his family did not derive
greater benefit from his exertions.</p>
<p>The earliest pamphlet published in the colony is probably that
of Mr. George Arden&mdash;a copy of which the author has in his
possession.*** It appeared in the year 1840, and consists of 118
closely printed pages, containing much valuable information; but
is by no means accurate with respect to the history of the colony
prior to its settlement. The discovery of Port Phillip Bay is
stated to have been made by Flinders in 1798, and Murray's name
is not once mentioned in connexion with it. Speaking of Collins'
expedition Mr. Arden says,&mdash;"In the absence of all official
data, and any published accounts, the writer has been obliged to
resort to tradition, chiefly oral, for the purpose of recording
as clear and consecutive a chain of events connected with this
expedition as in pursuance of his original scheme it was found
necessary to acquire."</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Its full title is "Latest Information with
regard to Australia Felix, the finest Province of the great
Territory of New South Wales; including the History, Geography,
Natural Resources, Government, Commerce and Finances of Port
Phillip; Sketches of the Aboriginal Population, and Advice to

Melbourne."]</p>
<p>Infant Melbourne was up to and for some time after Governor
Bourke visited and named it, generally called "the Settlement".
In Mr. Stewart's report we shall see, that it also went by the
extraordinary name of Bearbrass, perhaps a misprint for
Baregrass. It was supposed it would have been called Glenelg
after the Colonial Minister.</p>
<p>The appearance and condition of the place, shortly after the
rival parties of Batman and Fawkner were established there, at
the end of the year of its foundation, 1835, are thus described
in Mr. Arden's pamphlet just referred to,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The settlement was composed of two weather-boarded
huts, with brick chimnies, and eight or ten sod erections,
occupied by Dr. Cotter, the superintendent and others, the
servants of the Association; the sum total of the population
could not have exceeded fifty. The number of live stock in the
place had been pretty accurately estimated at 100 head of cattle
and 1400 sheep, six horses, and a small proportion of dogs,
rabbits, and poultry; three stations had been formed within a
distance of ten miles, which were known by the names of their
respective owners&mdash;Connolly's, Swanston's, and Solomon's;
the number of shipping entered inwards was eight&mdash;one
barque, two brigs, four schooners, and one cutter; finally, the
country had been explored northward to an extent of twenty miles
by a party of gentlemen, and found in every portion to exceed the
utmost expectation that had been formed of its fertility. During
the early months of the following year (1836) this germ of the
future capital was rapidly progressing. The first adventurers
began to open their eyes to the necessity of acquiring neighbours
and friends for mutual protection and support; each one,
accordingly wrote to those in whom he might be interested,
counselling their immediate translation to the land of
promise."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Arden further on gives a later description of
Melbourne:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"When the writer first saw this settlement, in
January, 1838, a few months after its authorized establishment,
it presented more the appearance of the villages he had seen in
the interior of India; a nucleus of huts embowered in the forest
foliage and peering at itself in the river stream that laved the
thresholds of its tenements&mdash;than any collection of
buildings formed by European hands. It was at the time possessed
of two wooden houses, serving the purposes of hotels or inns to
the settlers, who frequented the little town upon the occasion of
their bringing their wool produce to the port, or new arrivals
before they committed themselves to the trials and privations of
the 'bush'. A small square wooden building, with an old ship's
bell suspended from a most defamatory-looking, gallows-like
structure, fulfilled the duty of church or chapel to the various
religious denominations, whence, however, the solemn voice of
prayer and praise, sounding over the yet wild country, had an
effect the most interesting and impressive. . . . Two or three
shops, forming general emporiums for every description of
immediately useful articles, although exceedingly inferior,
opened their stores to the public, whilst a branch establishment
of a Van Diemen's Land Bank flourished on its monetary exchanges,
discounts, and circulation.". . . .<br>
<br>
"The writer left for Sydney in February of the same year, and on
his return, after the lapse of six months, so great was the
general improvement, so rapid had been its progress, as to render
it impossible for the memory to keep pace with the movement;
brick buildings were numerous, some boasting of two and even
three stories; the hotels wore transformed into handsome and
convenient inns, and the lines of streets had been cleared,
marked, and were in some parts under a process of partial
Macadamization; branches of two Sydney Banks were in active
operation and the population had well-nigh quadrupled its former
number, bringing with them or rather in their wake houses of
agency, and a multitude of intermediate dealers, fully alive to
all the advantages deducible from an incipient
trade."</blockquote>
<p>A few words descriptive of the site of Melbourne, as seen by
the same eye-witness, before it had quite lost its early rural
aspect, cannot but be interesting. He thus speaks of the place in
1840,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The principal part of the town is laid out in a low
fertile valley, the rich soil of which, extending back with a
gentle slope from the river banks, affords a fine material for
the numerous gardens which are attached to several houses of the
place. The extreme ends of the town are carried over two rising
and picturesque eminences, and the whole situated, as it were on
the verge of a beautiful park, the grounds and scenery in the
suburbs partaking in a manner most pleasing to English
recollections, of all the quiet subdued interest of an old
English domain."</blockquote>
<p>To the energy and enterprise of Fawkner, "the father of
Melbourne," much of its early success and progress seem due. Like
Batman at Indented Head, he lost no time in breaking the new
soil. He opened the first inn for the colonists, and provided
them with the first newspaper. The Victorian press&mdash;the
growth of which has probably been unsurpassed in any community,
young or old&mdash;first had an existence January 1st, 1838, when
Fawkner brought out the "Melbourne Advertiser". It appeared at
first weekly, for nine times in manuscript, and afterwards in
print. The circulation was limited to one number, which was kept
at Fawkner's hotel, for the Melbourne public to read. The issue
of this organ of opinion was interrupted, by the proprietor's
omission to give the security in Sydney, required in those days
before starting a paper in New South Wales. On a change in the
law, enabling him to enter into the suretyship in Melbourne, he
again brought out his paper, Feb. 16th, 1839, under the title of
the "Port Phillip Patriot." * In the interim, Mr. Arden's paper,
the "Port Phillip Gazette," appeared on October 27th, 1838. Mr.
Bonwick describes the difficulty of printing the first
number&mdash;the type being old and imperfect, and some makeshift
contrivance serving the purpose of a printing-press.** The "Port
Phillip Herald" appeared in January 1840; and in October of the
same year, the "Geelong Advertiser,"&mdash;the only one of the
four journals still existing under the same name,&mdash;came out
as a weekly paper. The others were bi-weekly.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The "Patriot" was afterwards merged in the
"Melbourne Daily News," which in its turn was merged in the
"Argus."]</p>
<p class="foot">[** The first number of the "Advertiser" is given
by Mr. Bonwick in his "Discovery, &amp;c., of Port Phillip," and
the second by Mr. Westgarth in his "Colony of Victoria."]</p>
<p>The first public religious service took place in Melbourne in
April, 1836, when the Rev. Mr. Orton, a Wesleyan clergyman, read
the Church of England service to a congregation which occupied
seats placed under the she-oak trees on the eastern slope of
Batman's Hill. Mr Orton preached from the text, "Except a man be
born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." For some time
after this, the police magistrate. Captain Lonsdale, read the
Church service every Sunday at the primitive Court-house. The
first Church of England clergyman, the Rev. J.C. Grylls, arrived
October 12th, 1838, and preached from one of St. Paul's grandest
texts, which was most appropriate for a first sermon after the
foundation of a young city,&mdash;"I determined not to know
anything among you, save Jesus Christ and Him crucified." The
foundation of the first Church, St. James's, was laid November
9th, 1839, adjoining the wooden building which for some time
served the purposes of both church and school-room." ***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The accounts of the services and the texts
are given by Mr. Bonwick, who also gives extensive particulars
respecting the land sales, and the names of purchasers.]</p>
<p>The first land sale in Melbourne took place June 1st, 1837,
and the second November 1st&mdash;average prices at the former
being 35<i>l</i>. the half-acre lot, and at the latter
42<i>l</i>. A purchaser at one of these sales is reported to have
forfeited his deposit-money for half an acre&mdash;afterwards
worth thousands of pounds&mdash;in one of the most leading parts
of the city.</p>
<p>The wonderful increase in the value of Melbourne land, in the
forty years which have elapsed, since these first sales took
place, is noted in the following short paragraph, in the
<i>Argus</i> of October 31st, 1877: "As showing the great value
of Melbourne city property, it may be mentioned that a block of
land in Collins Street East, with a frontage of sixty-six feet,
was recently passed in, the owner declining to accept
46,500<i>l</i>., the highest bid. This is at the rate of over
700<i>l</i>. per foot."</p>
<p>The injury to the new settlement and the hardship to its
colonists, of the sales of land in it being held at Sydney, were
forcibly pointed out in the following documents, which exist in
the Record Office. In a letter to Lord Glenelg, dated Hobart
Town, December 6th, 1836, Mr. G. Mackillop encloses two
memorials&mdash;"as chairman of two public meetings of persons
who were possessed of sheep and other live-stock at Port Phillip
before that settlement was lately taken possession of by the
Sydney Government, but who are not concerned with the company and
association who some time since purchased large districts of the
country from the blacks. "Mr. Mackillop states that the first
meeting was held October 6th and the second on November 22nd;
that the second memorial was also signed in a day or two after
the meeting "by several persons who intend to proceed to Port
Phillip; "and "that no settlers have yet gone or are likely to go
there with sheep from New South Wales, at least for some years."
He also says, "When I forwarded the memorial last referred to, to
General Bourke, I took occasion to mention, that several
gentlemen of respectability have lately arrived in this island,
on their way to Port Phillip, from England and India; but on
their arrival they have been much disappointed to find they
cannot get there for the present even allotments on which they
could during the 'present summer build cottages for their
families.'"</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"To His Excellency General Sir
Richard Bourke, Governor-in-Chief of New South Wales,  &amp;c.,
&amp;c.,  &amp;c.<br></p>
<blockquote>       "May it please your Excellency,&mdash;<br>
<br>
"We the undersigned either proprietors of stock at Port Phillip,
or now intending to go there as settlers, beg to state the
following circumstances for the consideration of your
Excellency.<br>
<br>
"About three months ago authentic information was received here
from London that instructions had been sent to your Excellency
from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to sell the land at
Port Phillip forthwith; and on such information being made
public, several families proceeded from this Island to that place
in the expectation they would be able to purchase land
immediately, at all events sufficient for a homestead. Other
families proposed to follow but are now deterred from doing so by
the tenor of your Excellency's Proclamation of the 9th September
last, since made public here, as by it, it does not appear, that
any of the land will be sold for the present;&mdash;nor after it
shall have been surveyed, we imagine from the tenor of the Land
Regulations of New South Wales will any of it be disposed of till
it shall have been advertised for three months in the Sydney
Government Gazette.<br>
<br>
"We are aware that in ordinary cases little hardship results to
the Immigrant in New South Wales from these regulations; but we
would submit to your Excellency, that the case is widely
different at Port Phillip. In New South Wales an immigrant finds
no difficulty in procuring a temporary abode in which he can
remain till the land he intends to purchase be brought to sale;
nor has he difficulty in procuring grain or provisions of any
kind for his family at moderate prices;&mdash;but at Port Phillip
there is no house nor place of any kind, in which the settler can
lodge himself, or his family, nor can he get grain or provisions
of any sort except by importing them from Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>
"Hence it would be a great favour to the settlers at Port
Phillip, if small allotments of land could be sold to them soon
after their arrival. If the allotment required by the settler be
in a Township, or in any place the acting authority there may
consider likely to become one, the quantity of land might be
restricted, say to one or two acres, or even to half an acre; and
the purchaser be bound to build a house on it of a certain value
and within a certain period; or, if the Colonist require land for
a small farm, where he could grow grain, and fatten pigs and
other stock for the use of his sheep establishment, perhaps he
might be allowed, without occasioning much inconvenience to the
officers of the Survey Department, to select a portion of land,
say one two or three hundred acres, according as his flock of
sheep in the Colony may be large or small, and which allotment
might be sold either at a fixed price, or be put up for sale by
auction at the Township at Port Phillip. We are aware that what
we are recommending is contrary to the Sydney Land Regulations,
but the exigency of the case requires a special remedy. If what
we propose or some similar remedy be not adopted, the Colonists
now at Port Phillip will not be able to construct houses for
their families before the ensuing winter, nor to get land
prepared for seed crops by next spring. We hope, therefore, the
interests of this growing Colony will induce your Excellency to
deviate from the Sydney standing Regulations in this case, and to
adopt some such measures as those we have recommended. It is
obvious, that it must be very inconvenient to families to remain
during the winter at Port Phillip in temporary buildings, the
thermometer Fahrenheit being often there as low as 26 deg. This
circumstance we doubt not will have due influence with your
Excellency.<br>
<br>
"We beg further to represent,&mdash;it appears to us that all the
land at Port Phillip should be sold there, and not at
Sydney&mdash;Our reasons for saying so are as follows&mdash;<br>
<br>
"It is known to your Excellency, that all the settlers at Port
Phillip were formerly Colonists in this Island; and it is
therefore very probable that more than nine-tenths of them know
of no one at Sydney, whom they would be willing to trust to act
as their agents in the purchase of land and in paying for it.<br>
<br>
"It would be extremely inconvenient too, for settlers at Port
Phillip to have to go to Sydney every time they may have!
occasion to purchase land. In. illustration of this we may
remark, that though eighty or ninety vessels have arrived at Port
Phillip in the last twelve months, it is only lately that any
have come there from Sydney with either stock or merchandise, and
it is therefore extremely improbable that the Colonist would be
able to get a passage from Port Phillip direct to Sydney at the
time he may wish to go there. If he have to come here on his way
to Sydney, the expense, besides the loss of time, would be
ruinous to him, as the following statement will show. He would
have to pay&mdash;</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>"In the case of a Colonist with small capital the
land he may be in quest of, may not sell for more than two or
three hundred pounds, yet to get to Sydney to purchase it, he is
obliged to incur an expense of 90<i>l</i>. as explained above;
besides the loss of two or three months of his time, which may be
even much more prejudicial to his interests. Nor is this the only
inconvenience, after he has got to Sydney, it is quite uncertain
that he shall be able to purchase the land on account of which he
has incurred so much expense. Parties there, trusting entirely
perhaps to his knowledge of its value, may outbid him, in the
expectation that they will be able to resell thereafter at a
profit; or what is more likely still the land may be purchased by
parties who expect to induce him to take it off their hands
immediately at an advanced price.<br>
<br>
"On the other hand we think that the land at Port Phillip would
be sooner sold, and bring more money if put up for sale there
than if it be disposed of at Sydney. If it be sold at Sydney,
many persons at Port Phillip desirous to purchase will be
deterred by the expense from remitting their funds to Sydney
under the uncertainty whether at an auction sale they will be
able to get the land they wish to purchase at what they consider
its fair market value; whereas if the land were put up for sale
at Port Phillip all parties desirous of purchasing it would be on
the spot, and hence there would be no chance of any sections of
it being sold much below their value.<br>
<br>
"It will, however, in most cases, in our opinion, be more
convenient for the purchasers to pay for the land at Sydney than
at Port Phillip, though purchased at the latter place; and should
that happen, it will be for the interest of Government to grant
all facilities in this respect, that can be conceded without
inconvenience, for the more facilities that are given as to the
modes of payment, the more money the land is likely to bring.<br>
<br>
"From all the accounts we have heard or seen of the land at Port
Phillip it will certainly bring a very unusually large sum of
money into the Sydney Treasury, when put up for sale. As this
fact must be well known to your Excellency, we do not suppose
that yon will object to what we have just proposed, on the ground
either of the extra trouble, or expense, that may have to be
incurred by the Government on account of the land being at Port
Phillip.<br>
<br>
"There is only one other matter which we wish to bring to your
Excellency's consideration. Many parties here, who propose to
purchase land at Port Phillip, are possessed of large properties
in this Island, but any large amount of gold could not be
withdrawn from this without seriously affecting the currency of
this place. We think it likely that a great proportion of the
proceeds of the land at Port Phillip may be intended to be
remitted to the English Government for the purpose of promoting
Emigration to these Colonies. If this be the intention of your
Excellency, we beg leave respectfully to suggest that bills on
His Majesty's Treasury may be received in part payment of the
land to be sold in Port Phillip, say to the amount of two-thirds
of the purchase price, or such other proportion as your
Excellency may consider expedient. We make this suggestion, not
because the withdrawing of gold from this would derange the
circulation of Van Diemen's Land, but because by granting the
facility asked for, the purchasers would be better able to pay
for the land at Port Phillip, and thus the amount produced by it
would likely be augmented.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Arden says that Williamstown "was evidently intended by
nature to be the principal settlement of the province," but "a
species of caprice which it is difficult to account for drew the
whole stream of emigrants to locate at Melbourne. . . . The
secret of this preference evidently lies in the fact of Melbourne
having had a supply of fresh water from the river which ran
through its centre, while at Williamstown the operation of
well-sinking was requisite for the attainment of this absolute
necessary of life; the introduction, however, of steam on the
Yarra, and the clearance of the river banks so as to admit of the
extension of the two towns towards each other, will before many
years have elapsed complete the facilities of communication to
such a degree as to render a division between the populations of
these settlements even less nominal than that existing between
the 'City' and 'Westminster'." The writer seems not to have
considered the greater distance between Melbourne and
Williamstown. He continues,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Williamstown, at this time, contains about one hundred
buildings, including two hotels, eight or ten mercantile stores
upon a scale quite equal to any in Melbourne, and one or two
retail shops. A small pier to afford accommodation for ships,
boats, and a lighthouse for the direction of vessels navigating
the bay at night have been lately constructed; a well, which
contributes greatly to the comfort of the inhabitants, was sunk
by mutual subscription." The want of a wharf, place of worship,
and school is mentioned, and it is stated that "Land is almost as
valuable as at Melbourne."</p>
<p>Geelong was founded shortly after Melbourne, about forty miles
from it, on the opposite, the western comer of Port Phillip Bay.
Sir R. Bourke, when he visited and named Melbourne, went there
also and gave directions about laying out the town. Speaking of
Geelong and its backward condition, Mr. Arden in his pamphlet
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The principal cause is to be found in the improper
retention of town allotments in the hands of the Government;
until the month of August in the present year" (1840), "not a
single building site had been alienated to desiring purchasers,
with the exception of a few in 1838, and these having been
disposed of in Sydney were bought by speculators, whose last
object it was either to settle themselves or part with the
possession on improving leases. Thus up to this hour Geelong
presents a few straggling houses, comprising in one spot the
dwelling of the police magistrate and constabulary, and in
another locality nearly a mile distant a few mercantile stores
and private buildings. The number, however, of inhabitants in the
immediate neighbourhood, occupying suburban lands previously
sold, supply the church of the town with a congregation, which
upon occasions exceeds the number of two hundred.". . . . .<br>
<br>
"Geelong is the seat of a magisterial bench, having a resident
justice of the peace, and being a court of judicature for the
Crown Commissioner of the district; a coast waiter from the
Customs department is stationed at the township, for the
inspection of vessels receiving and discharging goods under an
entrance or clearance from the sub-collector at Melbourne. The
local government will, it is expected, take some notice of this
township under its present improving aspect and afford a small
sum for the erection of a pier upon the beach, a police office
and watch-house in some more convenient portion of the town than
is now occupied by the magistrate, for a supply of water as well
to the residents as the shipping, and in support of a stronger
police for the extensive and unprotected district attached to the
town. A branch of the Port Phillip Bank is stationed at Geelong,
and there are resident directors of the Melbourne Insurance and
Steam Packet Companies; a newspaper, to be styled the 'Geelong
Advertiser', which will shortly be published in the township,
must become an invaluable commercial and political
agent."</blockquote>
<p>The preceding extracts, descriptive of the early condition of
the infant settlement and of its two leading towns. penned on the
spot at the time, point a striking contrast between the past and
the present and give some conception of colonial progress in a
few short years.</p>
<p>Geelong stands on a beautiful arm of Port Phillip Bay. Its
harbour is good, and would have made the town a very formidable,
if not a successful rival to Melbourne, but for the bar dividing
the deep water near shore from that further out. The air at
Geelong is considered better than at Melbourne; and the
surrounding country, especially about the Barrabool Hills, is
very fertile. Many people think Geelong would have been a better
site for the capital of the colony than Melbourne. Certainly,
before the existence of railway communication between Melbourne
and Hobson's Bay and the construction of piers at Williamstown
and Sandridge, Geelong presented greater advantages as a port
than Melbourne. The site of Melbourne, however, had a strong
recommendation to its founders&mdash;in the abundant supply of
water afforded by the Yarra, possessed by no other locality round
Port Phillip Bay. The Barwon, the river at Geelong, is not as
fine, and is a little distance from the town. Melbourne could not
well have been placed nearer the mouth of the Yarra, which below
the city runs between very flat banks.</p>
<p>Mr. Arden tells us that as "early as the year 1833, Portland
Bay was frequented by vessels from Van Diemen's Land for the
value of its fisheries. The first vessel which filled with oil
from the whaling ground of the port, was the 'Socrates', the
property of the Launceston Fishing Company, a mercantile house of
Hobarton. Incited by the success of this venture, other
shipowners entered into the lucrative field of competition thus
laid open to them, until year after year the fleet of whalers
increased to the number of fourteen, which annually carry away
from fifteen hundred to two thousand tons of oil in a single
season. Mr. Henty, the industrious, enterprising, and fortunate
settler, whose name and success are so intimately acquainted with
the early history of this port, was led from the result of shrewd
calculations, based upon personal observation and trustworthy
reports, to form a whaling establishment on the coast. Obliged to
provide for the necessities of his own charge, he was led to
enter into cultivation to some extent. His farming operations
have proved as successful as his other speculations, while the
fortunate returns of a few seasons have enabled him to import
cattle and sheep from Launceston. Thus of every natural resource,
an incipient commerce has been created by the energy, it may be
said, of a single individual, to whose benefit as well as of
those who may follow in his steps, it cannot fail early to
conduce."</p>
<p>It is further stated that Captain Fyans, Police Magistrate of
Geelong, and Assistant Surveyor Smythe were sent in May and
returned in August, 1839, to report upon the eligibility of
Portland Bay for a government settlement; and that they were "in
raptures of its beauty and fertility," and pronounced it "the
finest site for a settlement throughout the colonies." A census
then taken by Captain Fyans gave the population at three hundred.
It is elsewhere stated to possess three or four stores.</p>
<p>Mr. Arden says that at Port Fairy, "Mr. Griffiths, of Van
Diemen's Land, has a fishing-station there, said to be
productive." Mitchellstown, he speaks of as "prettily situated on
the river Goulburn, at a distance of eighty miles from Melbourne,
and on the direct line of mail communication between this town
and Sydney. . . .</p>
<p>A small inn, known as the Travellers' Rest, with some
stockyards and paddocks for the accommodation of cattle driving
along the road for Melbourne, Portland, or Adelaide, has been for
some time licensed at this place."</p>
<p>A township, in a favourable locality for travellers, is also
spoken of as "marked out for location at the Violet River, about
forty miles beyond Michellstown on the way to Sydney, and nearly
equidistant between the rivers Goulburn and Ovens," The "village
reserve of Pentridge," Arden reports, "will shortly, it is
expected, be open for purchase."</p>
<p>Mr. Arden mentions some explorations of the territory made
subsequently to its settlement. He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Hawdon leaving Melbourne, crossed the country in
a N.N.E. direction, until arrived at the junction of the Goulburn
with the Murray, where keeping the river as a line of travel, he
followed its banks into the Crown province"&mdash;South
Australia&mdash;"within a distance of fifty miles from Adelaide;
Mr. Eyre," in 1838, "more original and ambitious, discarded this
virtually safe route, struck across Australia Felix in a
longitudinal direction, and crossing the Loddon and Yarraine
rivers, came upon the Wimmera not far from its sources, with the
view of following the stream until it should lead (as he
expected) to nearly the same point of the Murray as that to which
his precursor, Mr. Hawdon, would arrive by a longer and more
tedious route; it need hardly be repeated that his bolder project
failed from the sudden termination of the Wimmera in a salt
lake," Hindmarsh, "situate just beyond the line of longitude that
divides this province from the neighbouring Colony, in a desert
sandy waste; nor needs it to be shown how, with an indefatigable
temperament, he succeeded in reaching at last the banks of the
Murray, northward of his position, and met with final success on
that road. . . . . The most extraordinary, however, of these
overland journeys, and certainly the most important, as
displaying the natural facilities of the country for
topographical research is that performed by Messrs. Hawdon and
Mundy in a <i>tandem</i>, of which may be found the following
account in the Gazette * of September 21st,
1839:&mdash;</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* The "Port Phillip Gazette", Mr. Arden's
journal.]</p>
<blockquote>"'We hasten to lay before the public the welcome
intelligence of the safe arrival of Messrs. Hawdon and Mundy at
Adelaide. These gentlemen left the stations in the neighbourhood
of Mount Macedon, on the 11th July, and drove in a tandem through
the uninhabited country of Australia Felix, with as much ease as
they might have done through an English park, to the junction of
the Murray with Lake Alexandrina, crossing that river on the 8th
of August. This journey of five hundred and forty miles was
accomplished in twenty-seven days. Their average daily rate of
travelling appears to have been about twenty miles. Tuesday 16th,
the travellers arrived at a station of Mr. Bowerman's, on a
rivulet which by them was considered as a tributary of the
Yarraine. Mr. Allan, the gentleman in charge of the property,
showed them the skull of a human being, which Mr. Hawdon
describes as being of a highly intellectual formation, and
indubitably that of a European; on the back of the skull were the
marks of two blows inflicted by a tomahawk. This circumstance
leads on the part of the South Australian Register, to an
interesting conjecture respecting the deplored yet unknown fate
of Messrs. Gellibrand and Hesse.&mdash;Thursday, the 18th, they
crossed for seventeen miles over a succession of stringy bark
ranges forming the lowest and eastern extremity of the Australian
Pyrenees so named by Major Mitchell. On the 19th passed through a
picturesque country, bounded on the right by the mountain ranges
of the Grampians, the summits of which are described as of
conical termination, indicating volcanic origin and action, and
encamped by moonlight on the Hopkins! (St. Iago what a name!) On
the day following, the travellers, in following down the valley
of this river, met a native skulking among the reeds, whose
fright or desire of treachery, prevented any communication. On
the 21st 'it snowed heavily.' As the day cleared up, however, the
party pursued their excursion for twenty miles, driving at the
rate of eight miles an hour, through a beautiful open forest of
she-oak. This day they rounded the most southern point of the
Grampians.<br>
<br>
"'On the 22nd they reached the upper part of the river called by
Major Mitchell the Wannon. 'Large broad and deep sheets of water,
occasionally extending a mile in length, were covered with ducks
and swans.' Tuesday, 23rd, continued along the banks of this
river for twenty-five miles, through a most beautiful forest, and
over a thick carpeting of grass; the country altogether being of
exactly the same description as that on the Yarra Yarra, eight
miles from Melbourne. To-day they fell in with a tribe of blacks,
who ran shouting and screaming after the gig. Mr. Mundy, it
appears, having a natural antipathy to these children of nature,
flogged the horses with such a will as to leave them far: behind.
On Wednesday, 24th, Messrs. Hawdon and Mundy were agreeably
surprised by meeting with a shepherd and his flock, upon some
fertile plains at the edge of a forest, which were found to be
the property of the Messrs. Winter, whose arrival at Portland
Bay, we noticed some weeks past in the Gazette. At this station
they passed the night, whence they proceeded by an hour and a
quarter's drive to Mr. Henty's station, forty miles north of
Portland Bay. 'The Messrs. Henty', says Mr. Hawdon, 'have the
merit of discovering and first settling in this fine country, and
in my opinion have displayed singular judgment in the selection.'
Friday, 26th, reached the junction of the Wannon and Glenelg, the
latter having at this season very little water running in its
bed. 'Having now', continues the journal, 'proceeded down the
Wannon from its source to the Glenelg, I can safely say that on
either side the whole distance, one hundred miles, it is the most
beautiful country and the richest land yet seen in
Australia&mdash;well might Major Mitchell call it Australia
Felix.' About thirty miles W.N.W of their crossing-place at the
Glenelg, they came upon a lake nine miles square; it was
subsequently called by Mr. Holloway Lake Mundy. This lake, by
their computation, is situated in the 141st degree of longitude,
the boundary-line between the two Colonies.<br>
<br>
"From this date to the moment of their crossing the Murray, at a
point where some gentlemen from Adelaide were making a special
survey, nothing of interest appears to have occurred. The
country, although containing sufficient water and grass to enable
them, by easy stages, to complete their undertaking, <i>was yet
in comparison to our side of the Glenelg, a
desert</i>."</blockquote>
<p>It is to be regretted that such petty jealousy of the sister
settlement of South Australia, should in one or two instances he
so early exhibited. The pamphlet speaks in one place of "the
vaunted Adelaide." This childish feeling among young communities
must be put away, as they pass from infancy to maturity.</p>
<p>The mysterious disappearance of Mr. Gellibrand&mdash;whose
name was connected with one of the earliest projects for
colonizing Port Phillip,&mdash;and of Mr. Hesse, was a melancholy
event in the early history of Victoria. The story is briefly
told. The two gentlemen left Geelong together to ride to
Melbourne, over the plains which extend almost the whole distance
between the two places&mdash;the Bay being close at hand on the
right and scarcely ever out of view. It is difficult to conceive
how any one taking a direct course, could have been lost even in
those days. The travellers, however, never reached their
destination, and although search was promptly made, no certain
traces of them or of their horses were ever discovered. Remains,
which, it was thought, might be theirs, were found some time
afterwards, but it is most doubtful if they were. Their names
were given to two hills in the opposite direction to that in
which they set out&mdash;there having at one time been some
reason to believe they had perished in that neighbourhood.</p>

the property of Mr. M'Killop, in charge of Mr. Clarke. Entered
Port Philip Heads about 3 p.m. on the 26th, it then blowing
strong from the S.W., flood tides; passed the brig <i>Chilli</i>,
ashore in the Eastern Channel with the nucleus of the late Mr.
John Aitkin's since celebrated sheep on board; came to single
anchor about five miles south of the Bed Bluff. Gale increasing,
parted from her anchor and went ashore; landed the stock next
morning with loss of one sheep. A pastoral association, called
the Great Lake Company, chartered and fitted out the brig
<i>Henry</i>, Capt. White, to take their stock from Tasmania to
Victoria, the <i>Hetty</i> having been condemned. Mr. Clarke
returned to George Town, and took charge of the company's stock
as manager, which were brought over by the <i>Henry</i> in three
trips, with a loss of 17 sheep. Mr. Clarke camped with his sheep
at the Saltwater River, opposite the present racecourse, and
commenced shearing on the 9th November, 1836, finished on the
27th. The sheep were like all those then in Tasmania, scabby;
they were dressed by the manager, as they came from the shears,
with a mixture of tobacco, water, salt, and soap; they were cured
of scab, and remained dean for three years, until infected by
scabby sheep which were brought into their neighbourhood. On the
29th November Mr. Clarke started with the sheep for where Bacchus
Marsh now is, where he remained until the beginning of 1838, when
he decided to occupy and reside at the locality called by him,
and since known as, the Pentland Hills, where he had already
formed out-stations. Mount Blackwood, at that time, was called
Clarke's Big Hill. Mr. Clarke gave up the country about the Marsh
to Captain Bacchus and son, who had brought sheep from Tasmania,
and were then encamped at the Parete Creek. The members of the
Great Lake Company were Thomas Winter, Charles M'Lauchlan,
manager Bank of Van Diemen's Land,&mdash;Dobson, father of Judge
Dobson, of Tasmania, and James Clarke."</blockquote>
<p>For a short time the colonizers of Victoria came exclusively
from Tasmania, bringing their flocks by sea. Their favourable
reports of the country soon, however, caused a stream of
colonization to flow from the opposite direction,&mdash;the
occupied territories of New South Wales,&mdash;from whence a
number of settlers poured in with their flocks and herds across
the Upper Murray. These "overlanders," as they were called,
meeting the tide of colonists advancing from the seaboard,
assisted materially in effecting the rapid occupation of the new
country. The "overlanders" commenced to move forward, soon after
the return of Mitchell's expedition.</p>
<p>The colonization of the Australian Continent has proceeded
from three great starting-points,&mdash;first, the original
settlement founded at Sydney in 1788, from which colonists
pushing north have occupied the greater part of the east coast of
Australia, up to its northern extremity, Cape York; then there
was Port Phillip, from which the tide of colonization, flowing
north and east, soon became mingled with that flowing south and
west from New South Wales; and lastly from the South Australian
settlement&mdash;established at Adelaide, within a few months of
that formed at Melbourne&mdash;flowed eastward a tide of
colonization which soon met that flowing westward from Port
Phillip. Thus, in a few years&mdash;by the meeting of these three
separate streams of colonists, commencing from different
sources&mdash;a long unbroken expanse of settled country fringed
the southern and eastern shores of Australia, and has ever since
been growing wider and wider, by the spread of population inland;
so that what a few years ago was but a fringe to the great
Island-Continent has been widening into a mantle.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> steps taken by the Sydney Government, in
the interval between the establishment of Batman's party at Port
Phillip, and the arrival of the sanction of the Home Government,
to the district being opened up for settlement, are clearly
detailed in the official documents contained in this chapter. The
first of these is the letter of Sir Richard Bourke, informing the
Colonial Minister of the state of things at Port Phillip, and the
last is the despatch of Lord Glenelg, authorizing the
establishment of British rule in what is now the self-governing
colony of Victoria. Governor Bourke thus writes *;&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* The documents in this chapter are copied from

<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Government House,
Sydney</i>,   <br>
10<i>th October</i>, 1835.          </p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;Being informed by the
Lieut.-Governor of Van Diemen's Land that several British
subjects connected with this Colony have taken possession of a
tract of land on the South-Western ** Coast of New Holland in
virtue of a treaty with a tribe of aboriginal natives, it becomes
my duty to report to your Lordship this intrusion upon part of
the territory described in the Commission which I have the honour
to hold from His Majesty. The particulars are contained in the
correspondence which has passed between Mr. Batman a settler of
Van Diemen's Land and the Government of that Island. Copies of
that correspondence received by me from Lieut.-Governor Arthur
accompany this despatch.*** From Mr. Batman's letter your
Lordship will perceive that this gentleman and his associates
rest their claim to a recognition by His Majesty's Government of
their treaty with the natives, rather on the merits of their
undertaking than to any Title to the land which that Treaty is
presumed to convey. It also appears that Colonel Arthur without
holding out any prospect of such recognition, has undertaken to
submit their case to His Majesty's Government and entertains a
favourable opinion of the parties. To him, therefore, as the
officer under whose immediate charge those parties reside, I
would leave the representation of every particular regarding
their personal character, views and resources; but I have
considered it incumbent on me immediately to protest against any
consequences derogatory to the rights of the British Crown that
might be imagined to flow from the alleged Treaty. I have
accordingly issued, with the advice of the Executive Council of
this Colony, a Proclamation of which I transmit a copy. It is not
my present intention, and I shall probably not see cause to take
any other step in this matter until I have had the honour to
receive your Lordship's commands on the subject. In the mean time
there is little doubt that Mr. Batman and his party will continue
to convey cattle to Port Phillip, and to invest capital in
building and other improvements at that place.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** In a letter to Mr. Hay, of December 21st, Sir
Richard corrects this obvious mistake, though intimating that he
need scarcely do so.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Batman's letter of June 25th and Mr.
Montagu's of July 3rd.]</p>
<blockquote>"Having thus briefly laid before your Lordship the
present state and probable prospects of this unauthorized
expedition, I may perhaps be permitted to offer some observations
upon the policy of allowing the occupation of land so distant
from the seat of Government and other located parts of the
Colony. To Mr. Batman's proceeding there appears weighty
objections, not only in the irregular mode he has had recourse to
for obtaining land, but on account of the absence of any
provision for the control and government of the inhabitants of
the intended settlement. It is hopeless to expect that any
precautions he can adopt in the choice of shepherds and labourers
will preclude occasional disorders among a population wholly
released from legal restraint. In such emergencies there will be
no accessible authority, military or civil. The undertaking must
sooner or later prove a total failure, unless supported by the
interference and protection of Government. If this support be
afforded, it is but reasonable that the settlement should
contribute to the revenue of the Government which upholds it, and
that its lands should be acquired under the general regulations
of this Colony, or under such others as His Majesty's Government
may see fit to impose.<br>
<br>
"I have before had occasion to submit to the Secretary of State
the opinion I entertain of the propriety of extending in a
southern direction the limits within which land may be acquired
from the Crown in New South Wales. On this subject, I beg leave
to refer your Lordship to my despatch of the 4th July 1834 No.
59, in which I communicated a proposal of Mr. James Atkinson for
the settlement of Twofold Bay by means of emigration from the
North of Ireland. Though I objected to Mr. Atkinson's plan in
many particulars, I expressed myself in favour of an extension of
the limits of location as far as Twofold Bay provided the lands
were to be disposed of under the existing regulations. In this
opinion, however, I was not honoured with the concurrence of your
Lordship's predecessor. The Earl of Aberdeen has stated, in his
despatch of the 26th of December last, that 'His Majesty's
Government are not prepared to authorize a measure the
consequence of which would be to spread over a still further
extent of Territory a population which it was the object of the
late Land Regulations to concentrate.'<br>
<br>
"After this intimation, it is only on account of the question
being forced upon me by the transaction I have related, that I am
induced to revert to the subject. In recurring to it, I am bound
to state that further reflection, and the advantages of personal
observation afforded by a recent excursion to Twofold Bay and the
neighbouring country, have more strongly than ever impressed me
with the correctness of the opinions expressed in my despatch of
July 1834. On the excursion alluded to I found the greater part
of the vast tract of fertile land lying between the County St.
Vincent and Twofold Bay depastured by flocks and herds, attended
by shepherds and stockmen, the pastures already contributing
largely to the wealth of the Colony, and exceeding in importance
many of the districts where land is disposable by sale or on
lease.<br>
<br>
"An export of live stock from Twofold Bay to Van Diemen's Land
had commenced, and is likely to increase and a considerable
supply of grain and other agricultural produce would in all
probability be furnished from the district for the Sydney Market,
in the event of the land there being thrown open to purchase.<br>
<br>
"Admitting, as every reasonable person must, that a certain
degree of concentration is necessary for the advancement of
wealth and civilization, and that it enables Government to become
at once efficient and economical, I cannot avoid perceiving the
peculiarities which, in this Colony, render it impolitic, and
even impossible, to restrain dispersion within limits that would
be expedient elsewhere. The wool of New South Wales forms, at
present, and is likely long to continue, its chief wealth. It is
only by a free range over the wide expanse of native herbage
which the Colony affords the production of this staple article
can be upheld at its present rate of increase in quantity, or
standard of value in quality. The proprietors of thousands of
acres already find it necessary equally with the poorer settlers,
to send large flocks beyond the present boundary of location to
preserve them in health throughout the year. The Colonists must
otherwise restrain the increase, or endeavour to raise artificial
food for their stock. Whilst nature presents all around an
unlimited supply of the most wholesome nutriment, either course
would seem a perverse rejection of the Bounty of Providence, and
the latter would require more labour than can at present be
obtained in the Colony, or Immigration profitably supply.
Independently of these powerful reasons for allowing dispersion,
it is not to be disguised that the Government is unable to
prevent it. No adequate measures could be resorted to for the
general and permanent removal of intruders from waste lands,
without incurring probably a greater expense than would be
sufficient to extend a large share of the control and protection
of Government over the country they desire to occupy. One
principal objection to dispersion thus becomes as powerful
against its restraint.<br>
<br>
"I do not, however, mean to admit the claim of every wanderer in
search of pasture to the protection of a civil or military force.
The question, I would beg leave to submit, is simply this. How
may this Government turn to the best advantage a state of things
which it cannot wholly interdict? It may I would suggest, be
found practicable, by means of the sale of land in situations
peculiarly advantageous, however distant from other locations, to
procure the means of diminishing the evils of dispersion; and, by
establishing Townships and Ports, and facilitating the
intercourse between remote and more settled districts of this
vast Territory, to provide, though but imperfectly, centres of
civilization and Government, and thus gradually to extend the
power of order and social union to the most distant parts of the
wilderness.<br>
<br>
"Such are the considerations which rendered me unwilling to
oppose the settlement of Twofold Bay. The same considerations
induce me to believe that it will be more desirable to impose
reasonable conditions on Mr. Batman and his associates, than to
insist on their abandoning their undertaking. I would propose
that a township be marked out, both at Twofold Bay and in some
eligible spot on the coast to which Mr. Batman's party has
proceeded. The Town allotments and the adjoining Territory might
then be declared open to location according to the existing
regulations, and I have no doubt that in both places considerable
purchases would at once be made. The proceeds might be at first
excepted from the rule which assigns this branch of the revenue
as a fund for encouraging emigration, and applied in the
beginning towards defraying the expenses attendant upon the new
settlements. The outlay would chiefly be required for the survey
and measurement of the land; the appointment of a Police
Magistrate with a Constabulary Force; and of an officer of
customs.<br>
<br>
"I would also earnestly recommend that a provision be made for
schools in which the children of persons of different religious
tenets may be instructed without distinction, on the plan now
adopted in Ireland. The means of education secured, I should feel
disposed to leave it to the voluntary contributions of the
inhabitants to provide for churches and clergy. To aid all alike,
where the creeds are various, seems impossible, and a partial
distribution of the public funds appears nearly allied to
injustice.<br>
<br>
"In the event of a Township being established at Twofold Bay, it
would be desirable to form a road from thence to Minaro Plains, a
part of which would pass over a rocky range of mountain. The
remoteness of this work would render it a very desirable
employment for the convicts of the second class sent here to
labour for a certain period on the public works before assignment
to settlers.<br>
<br>
"I beg leave to observe that it is in consideration of the
capital expended by Mr. Batman and his associates, that I am
inclined to recommend so early an occupation of Port Phillip.
This measure would have otherwise appeared to me premature, and I
should have preferred witnessing the success of the nearer
establishment of Twofold Bay before suggesting the more distant
settlement. It is with reference to Van Diemen's Land chiefly
that the occupation in the neighbourhood of Port Phillip may be
regarded as advantageous. I consider Twofold Bay as ripe for
settlement, as sufficient advantages are already derived from the
lands behind it to admit of their purchase (by the occupiers and
others) being rendered the means of the gradual introduction of
the various Institutions of Society. To refrain from their
introduction, through the fear of encouraging dispersion, is, I
am persuaded, a fallacious policy. The dispersion will go on
notwithstanding the discouragement, but accompanied by much evil
that might be prevented by the guidance and control of authority
opportunely introduced."</blockquote>

<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Launceston</i>,          <br>
23<i>rd October</i>, 1835.   </p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I had the honour, in the
month of July last, of transmitting you a report of my
proceedings at Port Phillip for the purpose of effecting an
amicable settlement with the natives of that part of New Holland,
and of the Treaty concluded by me for the occupation of a certain
tract of country under a certain annual tribute, and to be used
for Pastoral purposes, and in that report, I communicated to your
Excellency, the names of the gentlemen who are associated with me
in forming the settlement.<br>
<br>
"At that time it was considered by the members of the
Association, that the Territory in question was beyond the
jurisdiction of His Excellency the Governor of New South Wales,
and the report was therefore addressed to your Excellency for the
purpose of being transmitted to the British Government under the
expectation of the Crown confirming the land thus ceded upon such
terms as might appear equitable and just, and for that purpose
full instructions were transmitted by the gentlemen of the
Association to responsible agents in London to represent their
interests with the British Government and to fulfil such
conditions as they might agree with the Crown for a full
confirmation or grant of the Territory in question; but as it now
appears by the Governor-in-Chief's Proclamation, that His
Excellency exercises jurisdiction over the Territory in question
as part of New South Wales; I have the honour to solicit, that
you will be pleased to fully inform His Excellency General Bourke
of the proposed plans of the Association, their capacity for
carrying them into execution, and the principles under which they
wish to establish a Colony at Port Phillip.<br>
<br>
"I have the honour to inform your Excellency, that the
Association does not possess any community of interest, but the
stock will be the separate property of each party shipping, and
be placed upon separate establishments; and that so soon as the
pleasure of the British Government is known, with respect to the
terms upon which the Territory may be granted that a division of
the lands will then be formally made, and from that period each
party will form a separate and distinct permanent establishment,
famishing a proportion of quit rent or tribute payable for the
same, and also of other expenses which will be necessarily
imposed in carrying the objects of civilization into effect.<br>
<br>
"The parties have engaged two ships for the transmission of stock
and supplies, and in the coarse of six months they will have
property there to the value of twenty-five thousand pounds, at
least; and there can be little doubt that in a very short space
of time a Colony of great importance&mdash;not only to the mother
country but to both the Colonies will be established.<br>
<br>
"The Association has already felt some inconvenience by
individuals who have recently quitted the Port of Launceston, and
in defiance of our occupation of the land from the natives, have
fixed themselves on part of the Territory, and serious
apprehensions are entertained that they will materially check, if
not destroy the principle of colonization, unless controlled by
competent authority, and I am therefore requested most
respectfully to suggest the propriety of proper authority being
given to some individual for the purpose of enabling the members
of the Association to carry on unimpeded the principles of
colonization and civilization, until the pleasure of the British
Government may be communicated, and maturer plans adopted; and I
am authorized to add, that the members of the Association will
most cheerfully defray such portion of the expense attendant upon
this measure, as the local governments may consider fair and
reasonable.<br>
<br>
"I propose immediately to proceed with my family to Port Phillip,
to take, with Mr. Wedge, the direction of the affairs of the
Association, and the arrangements of the Native Tribes, and as
the vessels will be engaged for the next six months in conveying
stock from this Port to Port Phillip, the Association will be
happy to carry into effect any arrangements for buildings, for
such persons as the Government may think fit to send.<br>
<br>
"I have the honour of reporting the progress made by the
Association since July last with the Native Tribes&mdash;from
that period up to the commencement of this month, when Mr. Wedge
left Port Phillip, the intercourse has been kept up upon the most
friendly terms, and from eighty to a hundred natives have been
clothed and supplied with daily rations at the expense of the
Association. The natives have been partially occupied in habits
of industry, and I have not the least hesitation in affirming,
that if no unforeseen obstacles occur, a gradual system of
civilization will obtain.<br>
<br>
"In the report the Association communicated their intention of
engaging a surgeon and catechist; this pledge has been realized,
and Doctor Thomson proceeds with me to execute those
duties."</blockquote>

"I am to state for the information of Sir Richard Bourke, that
Lieutenant-Governor Arthur has lately conferred with Mr. J.H.
Wedge, formerly an officer of the Survey Department of Van
Diemen's Land, who resigned his appointment for the purpose of
settling on the Southern Coast of New Holland; and it appears
from his statement, that the Aborigines are cannibals, addicted
to infanticide, and are also in other respects, in the most
uncivilized state. Little dependence can therefore be placed upon
them, unless impressed with that appearance of strength and
determination among the white settlers, which the latter will not
be able to present if they are not united among themselves, and
if their intercourse with the blacks be not marked by uniformity
of purpose as well as by mild and conciliatory spirit.<br>
<br>
"I am further to observe, that it is at the same time perfectly
evident to Lieutenant-Governor Arthur, that a consistent course
of such conduct cannot be expected from the settlers at
Dutergalla, unless the District be placed under some form of
Government, and although His Excellency is aware that the
association are not in strictness entitled to any protection from
the Government as they are unauthorized intruders on the lands
which they now occupy&mdash;nevertheless, from considerations of
humanity, and in order to prevent the possibility of the
commencement of an exterminating war between them and the
Aborigines, the evil consequences of which would certainly extend
to any more regular settlement which His Majesty's Government
might afterwards establish, Lieutenant-Governor Arthur would take
the liberty of drawing the attention of the Government of New
South Wales to the present situation of these emigrants; and he
is further induced to do so, because the vicinity of the
Territory of Dutergalla to Van Diemen's Land, and the easy
navigation between the opposite coasts will, it may be feared,
hold out strong inducements to the convicts to endeavour to
escape thither, in the hope, if no Government be constituted, of
leading a lawless life, or of receiving high wages in a situation
where labour will unquestionably, for a long period, bear a very
high value.<br>
<br>
"I am to add that Lieutenant-Governor Arthur would have great
pleasure in co-operating with Sir Richard Bourke for the purpose
of conferring upon the settlers at Dutergalla some of the more
indispensable advantages which can only be enjoyed when there is
a power to carry laws into force, and to protect the lives and
properties of the individuals constituting the
community."</blockquote>
<p>The Governor of New South Wales, in a despatch of December
21st, 1836, encloses the correspondence relating to Batman's
application for Government protection, also an extract from the
minutes of the Executive Council of December 17th, approving his
Excellency's decision not to extend the authority of the
Government to what is called the territory of Dutergalla. His
Excellency assigns the following reason:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Considering, however, that Mr. Batman's occupation
is wholly unauthorized, and having reference to the instruction
received from the Earl of Aberdeen (in His Lordship's Despatch of
December 25th 1834) to discountenance every undertaking having a
tendency to disperse the population of the Colony, I do not feel
myself at liberty to extend to these adventurers even that degree
of assistance which Colonel Arthur appears inclined to concede,
without the direct permission of His Majesty's Government. Having
consulted the Executive Council, I find their view of the case to
coincide with my own, as your Lordship will perceive by the
extract of proceedings transmitted herewith.<br>
<br>
"I have accordingly informed Colonel Arthur to this effect, and
have now only to await your Lordship's commands upon the whole
question as submitted in my former and present
despatch."</blockquote>
<p>The members of the Executive Council present were the
Governor, the Colonial Secretary, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Snodgrass; and their concurrence is expressed almost in the same
terms as those of the despatch above quoted.</p>
<p>In a despatch] to Mr. Secretary Hay, of January 28th, 1836,
Governor Arthur also encloses copies of the preceding
correspondence, "respecting the territory of Dutergallar",
remarking that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"As Dutergallar is so near Van Diemen's Land, and
especially the northern portion of the Island, it was my wish to
have taken an active interest in its settlement. I have since,
however, perceived from the perusal of a Proclamation of Sir
Richard Bourke, defining the limits of his Government, that it
forms an integral portion of the Colony of New South Wales, and
of course, I have in consequence determined not to interfere with
His Excellency's jurisdiction, retaining as I nevertheless do,
the strongest desire that some form of government should he
established there, and impressed as I am with the importance, and
as I have suggested to Sir Richard Bourke, of appointing a
resident authority for the purpose of preventing the intermixture
with the settlers of runaway convicts, and of above all
maintaining some uniform course, such as, after patient inquiry,
may appear to be the best adapted for the purpose of conciliating
the natives and preventing bloodshed."</blockquote>
<p>The following in the Record Office, is the account given of
his visit to Port Phillip by Mr. Stewart, who is described in Mr.
Arden's pamphlet, as "the police magistrate of the Goulburn
District in New South Wales:"&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Copy Report by George Stewart,
Esq., to the Colonial Secretary<br>
at Sydney, dated 18th June, 1836."</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Sydney</i>, 10<i>th June</i>,
1836.</p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;In obedience to the
commands of His Excellency the Governor conveyed to me in your
letter of the 4th ultimo, I embarked on board the Revenue Cutter
on the 6th of that month for the purpose of proceeding to Port
Phillip; and when off the Heads of Port Jackson, I delivered to
Captain Roach his sealed instructions.<br>
<br>
"2. Our arrival at Port Phillip was delayed by contrary winds,
but we reached it on the 25th of May, and on the 27th I had the
pleasure of seeing Mr. John Wedge, who resides about thirty (30)
miles west of what is called the Settlement. To this gentleman
and all other residents, I am indebted for all the information
which they readily afforded me.<br>
<br>
"3. I have, in the first place, to report, that the parties who
are believed to have committed the two outrages at Western Port,
one upwards of 18 months ago, and the other in March last, have
long since left the Colony.<br>
<br>
"The principal accused of perpetrating the first, commanded a
sealing vessel, and was killed by the natives in the vicinity of
Spencer's Gulph. One of the females he carried from Western Port
is reported to have been with him at the time he was killed. The
perpetrator of the latter, is, I have every reason to believe, a
half-caste named Tomlins, at present employed in a whaling
establishment at Portland Bay. In the spring of the year, when
the whaling season is over, it is the custom of the men belonging
to the establishment to employ themselves in collecting Mimosa
bark, during which employment an attack was made upon a native
family, in which two women were wounded. It is expected that next
season they will again return to Western Port, when, should the
Government not deem it necessary to make any Police
Establishment, I have every reason to hope that the
delinquent&mdash;and his accomplices, if any, will be apprehended
by the residents of Port Philip.<br>
<br>
"4. The only aggression known to have been attempted by an
European at Port Phillip upon any of the blacks was committed by
a Stockman, who some time ago attempted forcibly to violate the
person of one of their females, and who, on that account, was
sent back to Van Diemen's Land by Messrs. Wedge and Batman, with
which punishment the friends of the female were quite
satisfied.<br>
<br>
"5. The Port Philip residents appear to be treating the blacks
with great kindness, and are endeavouring to instil habits of
industry into them. But, like all savages, they will steal when
they can find any opportunity; and three of them are reported to
have speared two white men near 'Indented Head', that they might
possess themselves of some flour these, two were carrying. The
tribe they belonged to, however, offered to give them up to the
Europeans for punishment, which offer, under existing
circumstances, was declined.<br>
<br>
"6. The only convicts that are known to have escaped to Port
Philip, are two from Van Diemen's Land, who secreted themselves
in the <i>Caledonia</i> trader, on her trip from Launceston. They
are supposed to be lurking within ten miles of the Settlement,
and during my stay of eight days, I used every exertion for their
apprehension, but having completed every other object of His
Excellency's instructions, I did not feel myself at liberty to
detain the cutter longer, and accordingly I embarked on the 3rd
instant on my return to Sydney. I had less inducement to delay my
departure, knowing that the residents are keeping a strict watch
on these men, and there is little chance of their long escaping
detection. Such is the feeling, indeed, among the persons now
forming the establishment at Port Philip, that they expressed to
me their determination to use their best endeavours to apprehend
any convict who may escape thither, and to forward him by the
first opportunity to the police of either New South Wales or Van
Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>
"7. On the 1st June, I held a conference with the aboriginal
natives, and I distributed to them some of the blankets which
were placed at my disposal for that purpose. So far as my
information extends I am of opinion the number frequenting the
country occupied by Europeans is about eight hundred (800) of
which four hundred (400) have assembled on the Settlement at one
time. Their movements are, however, very uncertain; and though I
was somewhat surprised that, from the moans I adopted of sending
notice that blankets would be distributed, a larger number did
not meet, the residents accounted for the circumstance in various
ways, and my impression is, that either the shortness of the
notice, or some feast at which they were supposed to be present,
occasioned the small assemblage. Messrs. Wedge and Batman having
undertaken the charge of the remainder of the blankets, and
promised to distribute them to the natives, I have no doubt His
Excellency will approve my having left them with these gentlemen
for that purpose, and I am informed by Buckley that even if I
remained another fortnight I might not see more of them.<br>
<br>
"8. The use of tobacco is yet unknown to them, and it would not
be appreciated had any been distributed.<br>
<br>
"The respectable residents are anxious to prevent their acquiring
a taste for either it or spirits; and by their advice I have
brought it back to Sydney. The articles most prized by the blacks
are blankets, tomahawks, knives and brass ornaments.<br>
<br>
"9. The blacks above alluded to are divided into seven (7)
principal tribes, and the following, as far as I have been able
to ascertain, is the name of each, its chief, and the country it
inhabits, viz.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I am inclined to think it has not been sufficiently
ascertained what distinguishing title the chief prizes most, but
have been led to believe that they designate themselves as the
chief of such a tribe, and not the king of such a country.<br>
<br>
"10. On the same day of my holding the conference with the
natives, there was a meeting of the Europeans at the Settlement,
and I embraced that opportunity of promulgating the Proclamation
of His Excellency Sir Richard Bourke, and circulated copies of
each, for the purpose of their being posted up at the various
stations of Europeans.<br>
<br>
"11. I further, agreeably to my instructions, embraced the
opportunity of my stay at Port Philip, to collect all the
information I could relative to that Settlement, and neighbouring
country, and the following is the result of my inquiries. The Bay
of Port Philip is about 100 miles in circumference, and, owing to
the numerous shoals, is of rather difficult access. All the
vessels, with the exception of one, which always chooses the
western passage, go by the eastern channel, although the western
is the more direct to the Settlement, owing to the former not
being so well known. The town 'Bearbrass', is on the left hand of
the Yarro Yarro, about seven miles from its month, which at
present consists of thirteen buildings, viz. three
weatherboarded, two slate, and eight turf huts.<br>
<br>
"The whole amount of European population consists of 142 males
and 35 females; of these, nine are proprietors claiming under Mr.
Batman's treaty with the natives in June 1835; four of whom
reside on their lands, and some of the others are soon expected
to follow their example.<br>
<br>
"Twenty-four others are individuals who have settled in the
vicinity without any regard to the above treaty and the remainder
are composed of *             and servants of the
above.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* This blank is in the printed copy of the
report.]</p>
<blockquote>"The number of sheep grazing at Port Philip when I
left was computed at 26,500, the number of horses at 57, and of
homed cattle 100. The estimated value of the whole stock,
together with farming implements, &amp;c. was computed at
80,000<i>l</i>. There was last year under cultivation 60 acres,
and the settlers have now brought the means to cultivate to any
extent which under the tenure of their circumstances, they may
deem expedient. I could not find, however, that their object was
so much agriculture as to secure pasture for their stock. The
wheat which had been grown, Mr. Batman assured me, was of
excellent quality.<br>
<br>
"12. The Europeans occupy an extent of about 100 miles of
country, but no person is known to have penetrated more than 70
miles within land, and the most distant station is not, that I
could learn, more than 35 miles from the township.<br>
<br>
"The soil is generally available for all agricultural purposes,
and for the most part, open grassy plains or downs. A very
considerable tract of fine country is represented as extending to
the westward of Port Philip. The land in other directions beyond
the limits claimed by the proprietors who acquired under Mr.
Batman's treaty with the natives, is not known to any extent, but
it is supposed there is an available country extending to the
north and north-west, as well as to the eastward as far as the
western extremity of the Australian Alps.<br>
<br>
"13. The country about Port Philip did not suffer last season
from the severe drought that was experienced in New South Wales
and Van Diemen's Land; and Buckley states that during his long
experience of upwards of thirty years, he has never seen the
pastures materially affected by the want of rain nor the country
daring all that period flooded. In a ride which I took across the
country between the two branches of the Yarro, I observed on some
plains considerable cracks in the ground, which I thought mast
have been caused by the dry weather, but, on my remarking the
circumstance, I was told that the pasture did not suffer in the
least.<br>
<br>
"14. Little appears to be known by the residents of Port Philip
relative to the country about Western Port; but the impression
seems to be, that there is at the latter place but a small extent
of available country compared with the former. On our way to Port
Philip, being caught in the straights by a gale of wind, which
injured the sails of the cutter so materially as to compel us to
put into Western Port to repair, I took the opportunity of
visiting the country where the Settlement formerly was, (about
eight miles from where we anchored,) and walked for some miles
through as rich a country as I have seen. It was thickly clothed
with Kangaroo grass, upwards of three feet in height, and in
mentioning this at Port Philip, I was informed that, in that
direction, there are excellent cattle stations, but the ground is
considered too wet for sheep.<br>
<br>
"I beg to annex a long and interesting communication addressed to
me by Mr. George M'Killop, an intelligent gentleman lately from
India, who has embarked a large capital in the Port Phillip
speculation.<br>
<br>
"It is perhaps unnecessary for me to draw the attention of His
Excellency to any separate portion of that letter, except it be
the important subject mentioned in the postscript, viz., the
smuggling of tobacco, which, together with spirits, I found were,
by means of the vessels trading thither, constantly imported
without duty either at Sydney or Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>
"For His Excellency's information, the following list of the
vessels now employed in bringing stock from Van Diemen's Land is
given:&mdash;</blockquote>

regulate the introduction of those articles of trade.<br>

STEWART</small>.   </p>
<blockquote>"To the Honourable the Colonial Secretary,
&amp;c."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Stewart was accompanied in the revenue cutter by Captain
Roach.</p>
<p>Mr. Arden, in his pamphlet says that Mr. Stewart was enabled
to gather the following points of statistical
information:&mdash;"In the six months which had elapsed since the
close of the preceding year"&mdash;1835&mdash;"the settlement had
assumed the appearance of a village; several buildings, although
of a rude construction, having been erected; of these many had
their plot of garden ground attached; a blacksmith's forge was at
work; soil fit for the manufacture of bricks had been discovered
and experimentally tried, and upwards of fifty acres of rich
light black loam had been brought into general cultivation. The
number of sheep which had been imported amounted to sixteen
thousand nine hundred and seventy-five, which, in addition to
those belonging to the colony in December, and their subsequent
increase, would give a total of twenty thousand; the number of
shipping arrivals had been in all thirty-five barques, brigs, and
schooners, besides the revenue cutter <i>Prince George</i>, and
the population had increased to upwards of two hundred; stations
had been formed in number proportionate to the increase of stock,
and the surrounding country for fifty miles laid open for
location."</p>
<p>On April 6th, 1836, General Bourke writes to Lord Glenelg,
"The emigration from Van Diemen's Land to Port Phillip continues
in active operation. I trust I shall soon be honoured by your
lordship's commands on the subject; lest such confusion should
prevail there as may require an interference upon my own
responsibility." The instructions so much desired, were, when
this was written, a week old, by the date of the following
despatch of Lord Glenelg:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"13<i>th April</i>.   </p>
<blockquote>"G.<br>
"Governor Bourke,<br>
    &amp;c.     &amp;c.<br>
<br>
"Sir,&mdash;I have received your Despatch dated the 10th of
October last No. 99, reporting the proceedings of Mr. Batman and
others at Port Phillip and Twofold Bay and suggesting the
measures which ought to be adopted to meet this new exigency in
the affairs of your Government.<br>
<br>
"I approve of the course which you have hitherto pursued on this
subject, and especially of your Proclamation maintaining the
right of the Crown to the soil on which these new settlements
have been effected. Although many circumstances have contributed
to render me anxious that the aborigines should be placed under a
zealous and effective protection, and that their rights should be
studiously defended, I yet believe that we should consult very
ill for the real welfare of that helpless and unfortunate race,
by recognizing in them any right to alienate to private
adventurers the land of the Colony. It is indeed enough to
observe that such a concession would subvert the foundation on
which all proprietary rights in New South Wales at present rest
and defeat a large part of the most important regulations of the
Local Government.<br>
<br>
"It is altogether superfluous to enter on the present occasion
into any discussion or formal statement of the principles which
form the basis of the rules according to which land is disposed
of in the Australian Colonies. The views of the Earl of Ripon
have been adopted and enforced by every one of his successors.
The object of Lord Ripon's rules would counteract the tendency of
settlers in a new country to disperse themselves as detached
families over its surface, and to promote the co-operation of the
inhabitants in all works of public utility, and in the employment
of labour and capital. But to suppose that Lord Ripon could have
contemplated the concentration of the people as the ultimate end
to be aimed at, or that he regarded it in any other light than as
the means through which other great social purposes were to be
attained, would indeed be entirely to misapprehend his policy. He
deprecated dispersion in so far as it might interfere with the
advancement of the Colony in wealth and other social advantages,
and with the maintenance of those religious and scholastic
establishments to which he was so justly attached. But he would
not have deprecated ** concentration at the expense of any of
those objects.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** Query "advocated," but so in original.]</p>
<blockquote>"If, however, my information be accurate, the Eastern
shores of New Holland, at least on the Southern half of that
great region so far as they have hitherto been explored whether
coastwise or inland, present a physical impediment to the close
concentration of the inhabitants, with which it would be only
futile to contend by human laws. The age of manufacturing
industry is of course remote, even tillage can scarcely be
pursued advantageously to any great extent, while the whole
surface of the country exhibits a range of sheep walks which
though not naturally fertile, are yet when occupied in large
masses, of almost unrivalled value for the production of the
finest description of wool. New South Wales is therefore not only
marked out by nature for a Pastoral Country but for a country of
which the pasturage must from the quality of the soil inevitably
separate the shepherds and herdsmen, and all their associates
from the general seat of Government and from each other. The
principle of counteracting dispersion when reduced to practice,
must unavoidably be narrowed within the limits which these
physical peculiarities of the Colony dictate and require.<br>
<br>
"But that principle must also bend to a necessity of a different
kind. It is wholly vain to expect that any positive laws,
especially those of a very young and thinly peopled country, will
be energetic enough to repress the spirit of adventure and
speculation in which the unauthorized settlements at Port Phillip
and Twofold Bay have originated. The motives which are urging
mankind especially in these days of general peace and increasing
population, to break through the restraints which would forbid
their settling themselves and their families in such situations
are too strong to be encountered with effect by ordinary means.
To engage in such a struggle would be wholly irrational. All that
remains for the Government in such circumstances, is to assume
the guidance and direction of enterprizes which though it cannot
prevent or retard it may yet conduct to happy results.<br>
<br>
"It may indeed admit of serious doubt whether the settlers at
Port Phillip and Twofold Bay have not in reality given birth to
undertakings which most deliberate reflection would have
recommended rather than discouraged. Each of these places will
probably at a time more or less distant form the nucleus of a new
and flourishing settlement, interchanging with the districts at
present occupied in the vicinity of Sydney many articles of
internal commerce, and contributing to expedite the general
occupation by the people of this kingdom or their descendants of
those vast territories in which our national wealth and industry
have already, in the last half-century converted an unproductive
waste, into two great and flourishing provinces. In producing and
multiplying such results as these it has I believe always
occurred, and is perhaps inevitable that the sanguine ardour of
private speculation should quicken and anticipate the more
cautious movements of the Government.<br>
<br>
"I have entered on these general remarks not as supposing that
they could convey to you any new information or suggestions, but
from my solicitude to show that in yielding to the unforeseen
exigency which has arisen H.M. Government are not forgetful of,
or departing from those important principles of colonization
which Lord Ripon so earnestly inculcated. In truth I know not how
under the new circumstances of the case, effect could be given to
those principles, unless the Local Government should as you
propose place itself at the head of the undertakings in which the
unauthorized settlers have engaged.<br>
<br>
"The settlement at Port Phillip will probably be reinforced by a
large number of emigrants, and a considerable introduction of
capital from Scotland. I enclose for your information copies of
the correspondence in which I have already been engaged with some
gentlemen on that subject. You will perceive that I had to a
considerable extent anticipated your own views.<br>
<br>
"Respecting the arrangements to be made for settling a form of
government at Port Phillip and Twofold Bay, I advance no further
than to express my general concurrence in your views, and to
sanction your acting on them in the manner which you propose. I
feel that writing at this distance on a subject so novel and
peculiar, I should rather encumber than assist you by attempting
to enter with more minuteness into the details of your
plan.&mdash;I have the honour to be, &amp;c.
&amp;c."</blockquote>
<p>Never was a Government more completely drawn along by a few of
its subjects, than in the colonization of Victoria. While
despatches were passing between the Secretary of State and the
Governor of New South Wales, evolving theories about dispersion
of population, the problem was practically taken in hand and
solved by the founders of Victoria, at Portland and Port Phillip
Bays. By the action of a few individuals the
Government&mdash;which so recently had refused to sanction the
area of colonization being carried as far even as Twofold
Bay&mdash;was now obliged to authorize its extension to a much
greater distance. The Imperial Government gave way with a very
good grace; and there seems little doubt, from his statesmanlike
despatch, that Lord Glenelg was convinced that the time had
arrived for a great advance in the march of Australian
colonization.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> first step towards the extension of the
authority of the New South Wales Government to Port Phillip, was,
as we have seen, the sending of Mr. Stewart to report upon the
new settlement. Mr. Arden describes the efforts made by the early
Colonists, to supply the want of regularly constituted authority.
He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"During his" Mr. Stewart's, "visit a meeting was held
of the staid and elderly inhabitants, chiefly stock proprietors,
for the purpose of framing certain resolutions, the object of
which should be the creation of a provisional government previous
to the appointment of a Police Magistrate for the district. The
mainspring of this temporary order of rule seems to have
consisted in the erection of a Court of Appeal, to which any
member of the community was privileged to have access against the
real or fancied aggressions of another: its authority, however,
rested upon the simple plan of causing inquiry and proclaiming
award, no power having been vested in them to infringe the
personal freedom of the subject. Another point of almost equal
importance was the desire evinced to the meeting to bind each
other down by some very wholesome and prudent rules in respect to
their relative position with the aborigines, a determination to
refrain from encouraging a use of fire-arms amongst the savages,
and to protect the harmless and more peaceable among them from
any system of wanton aggression. These, when subscribed to, were
submitted to the perusal of the magistrate before mentioned, who
was well pleased to find so respectable a community in so wild a
land, having evidently been impressed with very unfavourable
ideas regarding the character of this nest of adventurers. The
date of this circumstance, by reference to Mr. Fawkner's Journal,
was the 1st of June, 1836."</blockquote>
<p>Much light is thrown upon this laudable proceeding of the
pioneers of Victoria, in the "Australasian" of December 20th,
1873, by the following important letter and document from Mr.
Henry Creswick, an early Colonist. The former&mdash;as does Mr.
Stewart's Report&mdash;completely vindicates Victoria from Mr.
Trollope's insinuation that the infant settlement bore the taint
of convictism; the latter is of great historical interest, and
shows the high value which the founders of the colony set upon
law and order and the establishment of constituted authority.</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"<i>To the Editor of the</i>
<small>AUSTRALASIAN</small>,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;With many others who have
read Mr. Trollope's <i>Australia and New Zealand</i>, I am ready
to admit that, considering the tune he gave himself to collect
the information which he has so fearlessly published, his book is
a marvellous production of genius. I must, however, challenge the
correctness of Chapter 42, . . wherein is stated,&mdash;'Even
Port Phillip which is now Victoria, was first occupied by
convicts sent thither from the parent colony&mdash;though it is
right to say that the convict system never took root there, and
that the attempt never reached fulfilment. On the same principle
New South Wales sent an offshoot convict dep&ocirc;t to King
George's Sound, which is now part of Western Australia&mdash;an
unhappy colony which, in its sore distress, as I have just
explained, was destined to save itself from utter destruction, by
delivering itself to the custody of 'compelled immigrants', who
could be made to come thither and work when others would not
come. In this all the now existing Australian Colonies, except
South Australia, have either owed their origin to convicts, or
have been at one period of their existence fostered by convict
labour.'<br>
<br>
"Now what would the general reader infer from this but that Port
Phillip (now Victoria) was in some way or other founded on
'compelled immigrants'. I here state, and defy contradiction,
that Port Phillip (now Victoria) was in no way indebted to
'compelled immigration' for its formation. It is true that the
country now known as Victoria, which can only be said to date
from the arrival of the Hentys at Portland, and Batman, Fawkner,
and others at Melbourne, the former in 1834, and the latter in
1835, was occupied by Governor Collins with a cargo in 1803, and
abandoned almost immediately for Hobart Town. This clearly cannot
be said to have anything to do with Port Phillip, now Victoria;
and further, the Imperial Government sent out about 1844 as 'free
immigrants' prisoners from Pentonville, and immediately the
colonists discovered the class of persons which were being
foisted upon them, they not only refused to have them, but sent
the ships away which contained them, and would not allow them to
be landed.<br>
<br>
"I, therefore, consider Mr. Trollope's remarks unjust to
Victoria, for while I do not wish to cast a single reflection
upon any of the other colonies for their origin, I do not see
that our good neighbour, South Australia, should alone have the
benefit of the following:&mdash;'But South Australia has never
been blessed or cursed with the custody of a single British
exile.'<br>
<br>
"In support of the position I have now taken, it is fortunate
that I have the opportunity of submitting herewith for
publication the oldest constitution which pertains to the history
of Port Phillip, which, with other interesting colonial matters,
I recently found among the papers of the late Dr. Alexander
Thomson of Geelong; and it should, I think, carry conviction to
the mind of Mr. Trollope that his cursory view and report of our
early history is simply incorrect and liable, if not corrected,
to remain to our prejudice. I may add that the Old Colonists'
Association, at the formation of their Society put forth the
following statement:&mdash;'The Colony of Victoria having been
established by the enterprise and energy of the early settlers,
without assistance of any kind from the Imperial Government, thus
avoiding, fortunately, the reproach of convict taint, so
generally attendant on any pecuniary aid afforded by the parent
state to young colonies, it has been thought well to place on
record, by the establishment of an Old Colonists' Association,
the names of those who have been instrumental in founding, on a
broad and firm basis, a colony which promises to outstrip in
wealth and greatness all the Colonial dependencies of the British
crown. Yours, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. James Simpson, the arbitrator, was a much respected
gentleman, who was afterwards, for some years, magistrate in
Melbourne. Dr. Thomson was an energetic and useful colonist, who
came over with Batman. He afterwards resided in Geelong, which he
represented in the first legislature of Victoria, having also
previously been member for Port Phillip in the Legislative
Council in Sydney.</p>
<p>Nothing further could be done till the receipt of the
permission, contained in Lord Glenelg's despatch of April 13th,
1836. On its arrival Governor Bourke was not slow to act upon it,
as appears by the following communication addressed by him to
Lord Glenelg *:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* All the subsequent documents in this chapter
are copied from those in the Record Office.]</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Government House,
Sydney</i>,   <br>
"15<i>th September</i>, 1836.      </p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;In acknowledging the
receipt of your Lordship's despatch of the 13th April last, No.
142, I have the honour to state that I lost no time in acting
upon the permission it contains to open the country about Port
Phillip to settlers, and to establish civil authority in the
district for the protection of the Aborigines, and the due
administration of the laws.<br>
<br>
"His Majesty's ship <i>Rattlesnake</i> being in Port Jackson when
your Lordship's despatch was received, I proposed to Captain
Hobson to proceed to Port Phillip immediately, taking with him
Captain Wm. Lonsdale, of the 4th Regiment of Infantry, whom I
have appointed Police Magistrate of the District, and who is to
command a small detachment of that corps which I have since
ordered there. In the Government Notice of which I have the
honour to transmit a copy, I intimated to the inhabitants of N.S.
Wales and Van Diemen's Land the authorized occupation of the
shores of Port Phillip Bay.<br>
<br>
"I have despatched to that place a party of three surveyors with
the necessary apparatus and attendants. I propose to have the
land measured off into sections, and portions put up periodically
for sale in conformity to His Majesty's instructions. By a
previous measurement of this sort the selections by individuals,
in which, all sales originate in this part of the colony and the
delay and inconvenience attendant on this process will be
avoided.<br>
<br>
"I have also appointed an Officer of Customs, and a Tide Waiter
to reside at Port Phillip, the constant intercourse with
Launceston rendering an immediate arrangement necessary.<br>
<br>
"I have the honour to enclose a list of the appointments which
have up to this time been made; and a copy of my instructions to
Captain Lonsdale. I propose that the whole expense of the
establishment and contingent charges at that place shall for the
present be defrayed by the revenues of Crown Lands, the amount of
which will I anticipate be much augmented by the sale of lands of
that District.<br>
<br>
"I have caused a communication to be made to Mr. Batman and his
associates, informing them of His Majesty's command that the
district should be opened for location, and requesting that some
person on the part of the Company should attend at Sydney to
arrange the terms on which the Association will be permitted to
retain some part of the land they had taken possession of. I
propose to take the benefit of the advice of the Executive
Council in making the arrangement.<br>
<br>
"I beg leave to observe that although I find by the Act of
Parliament, that the Southern Australian Company have received
authority to occupy a large portion of the territory placed by
His Majesty under the government of New South Wales, I have had
no intimation whatever of this circumstance, nor of the formation
or proceedings of the Company from His Majesty's Government. I
have been led to make this observation from remarking that the
part of Port Phillip called Geelong, which will probably be used
as the Harbour, is not above one hundred miles distant from the
142nd degree of East Longitude, which forms the Eastern Boundary
of the Company's grant. The flocks of the colonists will probably
ere long be spread over the intermediate space,&mdash;and with
them convict servants will be brought within the neighbourhood of
the Company's possessions. If this should prove an inconvenience
to either government, it must be remedied in the best ways it
can. It would have been quite impossible to have restricted the
settlers of New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land from the use of
convict servants in the district of Port Phillip.</blockquote>

location of settlers on the vacant Crown Lands adjacent to the
shores of Port Phillip under the same regulations as are now in
force for the alienation of Crown Lands in other parts of New
South Wales, and several persons having already passed over there
from Van Diemen's Land, His Excellency the Governor has been
pleased to appoint Captain William Lonsdale of the 4th or King's
Own Regiment, to be Police Magistrate for that district, of which
all persons concerned are hereby required to take notice.
Arrangements are in progress for effecting the survey and
measurement of such parts of the land near Port Phillip as it may
be expedient to dispose of in the first instance; but until the
same shall have been completed, of which due notice will be
given, no applications for purchase can be entertained. In the
meantime, it is distinctly to be understood by those persons who
may be desirous of resorting to Port Phillip from other parts of
New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land, that no advantage will be
obtained by the occupation of any land at that place previously
to its conveyance by a legal instrument from the Government of
New South Wales, as without such title the land (unless required
for public purposes) will be subject to be put up for
competition, at a public sale, and sold to the best
bidder.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;His Majesty's Government
having been pleased to authorize the occupation of the vacant
Crown Lands on the shores of and adjacent to Port Phillip to
which district several persons have already passed over from Van
Diemen's Land, it has been deemed expedient by His Excellency Sir
Richard Bourke to appoint a Civil and Military force for the
preservation of good order in those parts.<br>
<br>
"I am in consequence commanded to inform you that his Excellency
has been pleased to name you to be Police Magistrate for the
district of Port Phillip, to which place you are to hold yourself
in readiness to repair at your earliest convenience, a passage
being provided for you in His Majesty's ship
<i>Rattlesnake</i>.<br>
<br>
"The following are the general Instructions by which you are to
be guided in the discharge of the duties confided to you.<br>
<br>
"Under your Commission of the Peace, and in the capacity of
Police Magistrate, you will exercise the ordinary jurisdiction of
a Justice, the laws of England in force in this part of the
colony, and the acts of the Governer and Council being equally
applicable to the district in which you are to be placed as to
any other part of New South Wales. In order to provide for the
due administration of those laws in cases where the presence of
two justices is required, it is intended to give a commission of
the peace to the subaltern officer who proceeds with the
detachment of His Majesty's troops ordered to that station. To
execute your warrants and orders one district and two ordinary
constables, will be appointed and directed to accompany you, and
you are authorized to select a clerk either from the military on
the station, or to employ any competent person whom you may find
on the spot. You will be required to forward to this government,
and to the Attorney-General and Principal Superintendent of
Convicts, the same description of returns and reports, as are now
furnished by Police Magistrates from other parts of the
territory, excepting the Monthly Confidential report, the form of
which is not applicable to the district in which you are to
reside. I am, however, to desire that on the last day of every
mouth you prepare a report, in which you are to narrate every
important transaction occurring in that month, with which you may
think it advisable this government should be made acquainted.
This report is to be marked Confidential and addressed to the
Governor himself. In addition to this monthly communication you
are to understand that when any circumstance of importance arises
requiring immediate report to Government, you are expected to
take the readiest means of furnishing such information. I should
add that for some time it will be proper for you to make your
communications in duplicate and probably to use the Port of
Launceston, in Van Diemen's Land, as the channel of intercourse
with Sydney.<br>
<br>
"Having thus pointed out to you the general line of your duty,
and the extent of your powers as Police Magistrate at Port
Phillip, I am further commanded to inform you that Sir Richard
Bourke placing entire confidence in your intelligence and
discretion is desirous of giving to you the general
superintendence in the new settlement of all such matters as
require the immediate exercise of the authority of the
government. For this purpose I have to acquaint you that His
Excellency has directed a branch of the Surveyor-General's
Department to repair to Port Phillip for immediate measurement of
a portion of the district. A copy of the Instructions given to
the officer in charge upon his undertaking this duty and such as
he may subsequently receive will be forwarded to you. He will be
directed to communicate with you upon any subject requiring the
interference of your authority, and to follow such directions as
he may in any case receive from you. Without interfering with his
professional duty you will attend to his proceedings and report
to me for the Governor's information, whether in your opinion due
diligence is used by himself and those under his immediate
orders, and whether the instructions he has received are
carefully followed. This officer will also be appointed a
Commissioner of Crown Lands, and it will be his duty to bring
before you the case of any intruder whom you may find it
necessary for the public service to remove from those lands under
the provisions of the act of the Governor and Council 7 Gul. 4
No. 4.<br>
<br>
"In like manner the instructions given to an officer of customs,
whom it is proposed to station at Port Phillip, will be made
known to you. He will be directed to apply to you in any case of
doubt or difficulty requiring immediate decision and to act upon
your instructions, and you will afford him every assistance in
your power to facilitate the execution of his duty.<br>
<br>
"A gentleman having been appointed surgeon and catechist by the
residents now at Port Phillip, you are authorized to place the
name of this individual, if you think him qualified, on the
Abstract of the District at his present rate of pay from the date
of your landing, and to inform him that he is thenceforward to
consider himself in the employment of this Government and placed
under your orders.<br>
<br>
"You will report to me for Sir Richard Bourke's information the
conduct and proceedings of those, or any other officers in the
civil service of this Government who may be placed within your
district.<br>
<br>
"Immediately after landing at Port Phillip you are to take an
accurate census of every person then residing in the District,
specially noting those who have occupied any portion of the land
by erecting a hut or grazing cattle or sheep and distinguishing
those who have done either or both. It will be convenient to take
this census as nearly as possible in the form set forth in the
late act. You may employ for this purpose such of the constables,
or other persons as you find necessary, paying them at the
authorized rates. You should be careful to engage trusty persons
on this service lest unfair claims should hereafter be advanced
upon the plea of an early occupation which never existed. You
will also carefully note all subsequent arrivals or
occupations.<br>
<br>
"If before the arrival of the transport, which is to follow with
the military detachment, you should require any aid to the Civil
Power, you will apply to Captain Hobson of his Majesty's ship
<i>Rattlesnake</i>, who, I doubt not, will readily afford you
very necessary assistance.<br>
<br>
"It will be one of your most important duties to protect the
aboriginal natives of the district from any manner of wrong and
to endeavour to conciliate them by kind treatment and presents,
assuring them that this Government is most anxious to maintain a
friendly intercourse with them, and to improve by all practicable
means their moral and social condition. With a view to this
improvement you will endeavour to establish them in a village,
and to induce them to offer their labour in return for food and
clothing. You will continue to employ as the medium of
communication with them the European named "Buckley" who has so
long resided amongst them, allowing him the same salary as he now
receives from Mr. Batman and his associates. Should the conduct
of the natives be violent or dishonest, you will endeavour to
restrain them by the gentlest means, informing them that they
must consider themselves subject to the laws of England, which
being put in force for their protection, must equally operate for
their restraint or punishment if they offend the whites. They
must accordingly be sent to Sydney for trial if they commit a
crime of such magnitude as to require it. You will take an early
opportunity of reporting to me for the Governor's information the
number of the Aborigines with whom you have been able to
communicate, the steps you have taken for acquiring their
confidence and good will, and the general result of your
exertions for their advantage, suggesting at the same time any
further measures which you would desire to see adopted in their
favour.<br>
<br>
"A Government notice of your appointment has been issued and
printed, which you will cause to be posted and circulated at Port
Phillip. You will draw the attention of any person who may desire
to occupy land in the district to that part of the notice which
treats of this subject. It is not intended that you should
actually prevent free persons either with or without stock from
passing into the district, nor that you should disturb the
occupation of those already there as long as they conduct
themselves honestly and peaceably, but you will discourage any
person from occupying land before he acquires a title and
particularly caution him from effecting improvements which will
serve to augment competition when the land is put up for sale. It
is the desire of this Government to expedite as much as possible
the regular location of settlers In those parts, as a preliminary
step to which a survey and measurement of the lands are ordered.
The premature occupation by individuals will give them no
advantage at the time of sale.<br>
<br>
"If you should at any time desire to remove any person from the
lands of the Crown whose conduct is such as to render his
presence there injurious to the public service you will not
scruple to use all legal means to effect this object. If payment
of the fine imposed on unauthorized occupation by the Act be not
made, the offender must be committed to Sydney Gaol for the
period specified by 5 Gul. IV. No. 22. It is to be hoped,
however, that by the proper union of moderation and firmness, the
necessity for so disagreeable a proceeding may be wholly
avoided.<br>
<br>
"It is proper to inform you that the application made to His
Majesty's Government by Mr. Batman and those gentlemen connected
with him for permission to occupy a large portion of the Crown
Lands at Port Phillip has been referred to the Government of New
South Wales for consideration. Measures will be immediately taken
for conferring with Mr. Batman and his associates on this
subject.<br>

information upon any other matters connected with your civil
employment which may not have been adverted to in these

<blockquote>"G.<br>
"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I have received your despatch No. 101
of the 15th of September last, reporting the measures which you
had taken for opening the country in the vicinity of Port Phillip
for colonization and for providing for the good order and
government of that Settlement, and I have to convey to you my
general approval of those measures.<br>
<br>
"Having conferred with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury
with regard to the establishment of officers whom you have sent
down to Port Phillip, I see no reason to disapprove of the
allowances which you have attached to those appointments. I
should however, wish that the system of granting rations to the
civil officers should be discontinued as soon as the Settlement
shall have been sufficiently established.<br>
<br>
"I must also impress on you the importance of adhering rigidly to
the principle of the existing regulations as to the disposal of
land, and of fixing such a minimum price for its sale as in the
possible absence of the same degree of competition which exists
elsewhere will afford a security against improvident
appropriation of Crown land at an inadequate price. As this
settlement although within your Government is at a considerable
distance from Sydney, I think it essential that separate accounts
should be kept of the sale of the Crown lands in the District of
Port Phillip, and that the proceeds of such sales should be
applied to the improvement of this new settlement and especially
in the introduction of free emigrants, which would supply the
demand for labour without the use of convicts. I am therefore
anxious that you should take measures as soon as possible for
directing immigration to this settlement, as well as to other
parts of the Colony and that you should abstain to the utmost
practicable extent from the assignment of convicts to the
settlers in the Port Phillip District. The objections to the
system which at present prevails in New South Wales with respect
to the assignment of convicts would exist in a still greater
degree in a new settlement, where there cannot be the same means
of conferring order and imposing restraint which are available in
an older settlement, while there must be greater facilities of
escape, aided by the circumstance to which you have referred of
the vicinity of a part of Port Phillip District to the Eastern
boundary of South Australia. Nor at a moment when H.M. Government
are preparing to put an end to the system of assignment in New
South Wales should I consent without the greatest reluctance to
its extension, even to a limited degree to any new
settlement.<br>
<br>
"It is also of importance that the recent arrangements with
regard to the means of religious instruction should be extended
as soon as possible to the settlement of Port Phillip.<br>
<br>
"With regard to the Colony of Southern Australia, the publicity
which from the peculiar circumstances under which it had
originated has attended the various stages of its formation and
particularly the fact of its having been constituted under the
authority of an Act of Parliament appeared to render any formal
announcement to you on that subject unnecessary. It is however
important that in regulating the upset price of land at Port
Phillip you should not exclude from your consideration the price
below which land cannot be acquired within the Colony of South
Australia. I have, &amp;c."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"G.<br>
"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I am directed by Lord Glenelg to
request that you will state to the Lords Commissioners of the
Treasury that the country at Port Phillip, on the S.E. Coast of
New South Wales has been thrown open to settlers under the
following circumstances.<br>
<br>
"In the commencement of the year 1835, a large body of persons
proceeded (from Van Diemen's Land chiefly) to Port Phillip, and
having formed themselves into an organized Association, took
possession of considerable tracts of land under grants from the
native chiefs. With this semblance of title they readily
attracted new settlers and established a correspondence and
agency with a wealthy society in this country from whom they made
arrangements for obtaining pecuniary and other aids. The desire
of joining the new settlement became so strong as to be described
by Colonel Arthur as a 'mania' affecting all classes in Van
Diemen's Land. Within a very short space of time Port Phillip
assumed the appearance of an established settlement, with
extensive and valuable flocks and herds; and judging from the
progress of the adventure, it seems not unreasonable to infer
that before any instructions from this country could arrive at
the place, the population would have become so numerous as to
render hopeless any attempt to dislodge them by authority or by
force.<br>
<br>
"When intelligence of these proceedings reached Lord Glenelg from
the respective Governors of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land
his Lordship felt the indispensable necessity of adopting the
earliest and most effective measures for arresting the progress
of these unauthorized settlements. He was peculiarly anxious to
do all in his power for the protection of the settlers in South
Australia, against the consequences to be apprehended from the
facility of obtaining land gratuitously in a neighbouring
settlement.<br>
<br>
"His Lordship was also desirous of preventing the calamities
which might be anticipated from collisions amongst the settlers
at Port Phillip as well as between them and the natives of that
District.<br>
<br>
"On review of all the circumstances attending this spontaneous
immigration to Port Phillip, it appeared to Lord Glenelg the
preferable course for H.M. Government to authorize its
settlement; and he accordingly instructed Sir R. Bourke to
execute his own proposal to throw open the land for sale and to
send down a small establishment of officers for the government of
the place.<br>
<br>
"I enclose for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the
Treasury, an extract of a despatch from Sir Richard Bourke,
reporting the appointments which he has considered it necessary
to create for this purpose, and also the salaries and allowances
which have been assigned to the respective functionaries. In
addition to the officers enumerated in the enclosed schedules Sir
R. Bourke has authorized Captain Lonsdale, the Chief Officer of
the settlement, to take into the service of the Government, (on
the pay they were receiving) a gentleman employed by the settlers
as a surgeon and catechist, if he should be found qualified, and
also an Englishman who had been domiciled for many years among
the natives, and who had been used by the settlers as an
Interpreter. The allowance to the surgeon, is understood to
amount to &pound;180 per annum; what the other receives is not
known.<br>
<br>
"I am to request that, in laying these papers before the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury, you will inform them that Lord
Glenelg is of opinion that the scale of expenditure proposed by
Sir R. Bourke on account of this settlement should be
sanctioned.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">"I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"(Signed)           <small>JAMES
STEPHEN</small>."   </p>
<p>Mr. Spearman of the Treasury writes to Mr. Stephen, April
21st, 1837:&mdash;"I have it in command to request that you will
state to Lord Glenelg, that My Lords see no reason to disapprove
of the proceedings reported by Sir R. Bourke, in respect to the
settlement at Port Phillip."</p>
<p>In a despatch of July 26th, 1837, Lord Glenelg remarks to Sir
Richard Bourke:&mdash;"Your Commission as Governor of New South
Wales asserts Her Majesty's Sovereignty over every part of the
Continent of New Holland which is not embraced in the Colonies of
Western or Southern Australia. Hence I conceive it follows that
all the natives inhabiting those territories must be considered
as subjects of the Queen, and as within H.M. allegiance."</p>
<p>The letter of Sir Richard Bourke to Lord Glenelg, reporting
his visit to Melbourne, though not as descriptive as could have
been desired, must always be regarded as highly interesting and
important. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Government House,
Sydney</i>,   <br>
13<i>th June</i>, 1837.           <br></p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;I have had occasion to
mention incidentally in despatches addressed to your Lordship,
that I had thought it necessary to go from hence to Port Phillip
in the month of March last for the arrangement of various matters
connected with the successful occupation of that remote portion
of this Government. I delayed making any specific report of what
I observed during my visit, or directed to be done in consequence
of it until I could forward a map of the country over which I
travelled. By the kind assistance of Captain King, of the Royal
Navy, who accompanied me on the tour, I am now enabled to
transmit a sketch of the grounds adjacent to the waters of Port
Phillip, extending inland in a northerly direction to Mount
Macedon, the nearest point of Major Mitchell's late survey, with
which it is thus connected. To the country thus described, which,
when more accurately defined hereafter, will probably form one
country of a large size, I have, at the desire of the residents,
permitted my name to be attached on the manuscript, awaiting His
Majesty's gracious allowance before any publication takes place.
If your Lordship thinks well of having this sketch added to the
map of the Colony which I presume Major Mitchell is about to
publish in London, I have to request he may be informed on the
subject.<br>
<br>
"I have now to acquaint your Lordship that I found on my arrival
on the spot selected for a settlement by Mr. Batman on the banks
of the Yarra River, at the head of the inland sea called Port
Phillip, an assembled population consisting of from sixty to
seventy families. The situation appearing to be well chosen I
directed a Town to be immediately laid out, which your Lordship
will perceive by the map has received the name of Melbourne.
Conceiving it to be an object of some importance to enable the
families I have mentioned to place themselves with as little
delay as possible on property of their own, I directed one
hundred allotments to be measured and offered for sale at
Melbourne on the first of this month. I also directed a few
allotments to be put up in Williamstown, on the shore of Hobson's
Bay, where stores and commercial establishments are likely to be
soon formed. I have not yet received an account of the sales, but
I have no doubt the allotments were readily purchased at advanced
prices.<br>
<br>
"I found at the beginning of March last that the population in
the whole district exceeded 500 souls, and before I left
Melbourne at the end of that month, the flocks which had been
sent from Van Diemen's Land numbered more than 100,000 sheep. The
country which I traversed by the routes marked blue on the sketch
is of a varied description, but generally the pasture maybe
described as superior in quality to the average of the districts
of New South Wales, which have been earlier settled. It is not
for the most part well watered, but the general character of the
country is such as to render it a very desirable position for
settlers, whether graziers or agriculturists, and there is, I
think, little doubt of it soon becoming the resort of emigrants
from Europe, as it is now of those inhabitants of Van Diemen's
Land, who find it difficult to extend their possessions, or to
establish their families to their liking on the land remaining
for selection in that Colony.<br>
<br>
"As there is thus little doubt that this settlement will increase
rapidly in numbers and wealth, it becomes of some importance to
consider what way its Government can be best administered, and
the inhabitants obtain the benefit of the essential institutions
of civil society.<br>
<br>
"With respect to the Government, I apprehend that the great
distance between Sydney and Melbourne, whether the communication
be by land or water, will render it extremely difficult for some
time at least to keep up those frequent references upon ordinary
as well as important subjects which are required to be made to
the seat of Government. The distance by land exceeds 550 miles,
and the route passing for nearly 400 miles through a country as
yet but little traversed or known, the time required to
accomplish it On horseback can hardly be taken at less than ten
days. A passage by water may be effected in steam vessels in
about four days; but the steamers to encounter in winter the sea
on the eastern and southern coast of New South Wales must be of
considerable size and power, and the establishment of such will
not, I imagine, be attractive to private speculation until the
new settlement has made so considerable a progress as to create a
commercial intercourse of some importance between the two places.
But it may be further observed that the vicinity of Launceston in
Van Diemen's Land to Port Phillip seems to point the former as
the mart to which the inhabitants of the latter will for some
time resort. To keep up therefore a regular and frequent
intercourse between the districts of Port Phillip and Sydney
appears for the present impracticable, but a sure though limited
communication might be established by means of a Government steam
vessel. To diminish the necessity for more frequent intercourse,
I would suggest the appointment of a military officer as
Lieutenant-Governor or Commandant of the Southern Districts, with
civil as well as military authority. To a functionary of this
character, all the officers of the Government at Port Phillip and
in the Southern Districts might be required to report and receive
his orders, whilst periodical reports should be made on his part
to the Government at Sydney.<br>
<br>
"With respect to legislation, I do not consider that the
appointment of a Lieutenant-Governor would render necessary a
separate Council or Assembly for the Southern Districts of New
South Wales. There would be no great inconvenience in requiring
the attendance at Sydney for the Session of those who might be
appointed or elected Members of the Colonial Legislature.<br>
<br>
"With respect to the administration of the Law your Lordship will
perceive by the annexed letter of the Attorney-General of this
Colony, that he proposes the addition of a fourth Judge to the
Bench of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in order that one
of the four may be available for holding Assizes twice a year at
Port Phillip, and discharging the other duties both there and in
Sydney, which he describes. The arrangement proposed by Mr.
Plunket would probably be sufficient for some time, without the
institution at Port Phillip of Quarter Sessions, or a Court of
Requests. But to provide with regularity a passage between Sydney
and Melbourne for the Judge and attendants on the Court, it would
be necessary to establish the Government vessel to which I have
referred in a former paragraph of this Despatch, and on which
subject I have the honour to address your Lordship a separate
Despatch by this opportunity under another cover.<br>
<br>
"The expense which it may be necessary to incur under the
proposed arrangement is detailed in an annexed schedule and
submitted for consideration. I imagine the whole charge for Port
Phillip may for some time be defrayed by the sale of land within
the District and the receipt of duties of customs. The latter for
the Quarter ending the 5th January amounted to &pound;329
0<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>
"In my despatch of the 15th September last No. 101 I informed
your Lordship of the measures I had adopted for opening to
location the District in question, and of the appointments I had
made from hence for the purpose. I found when at Port Phillip
that the Police Magistrate Captain William Lonsdale, late of the
4th Foot, had conducted the varied duties of his station with
great ability and zeal; and through his activity and discretion
the comfort of the settlers, and the preservation of good order
in the District had been fully provided for. I found also that
great kindness and attention had been paid to the Aboriginal
Natives both by him and the Missionary Langhorne. I have given to
them both, every assistance in my power, and I indulge a hope
notwithstanding some unfortunate circumstances that the
intercourse between these Natives and the white population of
Port Phillip will be carried on with greater benefit to the
former than has hitherto been experienced in other parts of New
South Wales.<br>
<br>
"I have not had occasion to make any material addition to the
Establishments for Port Phillip reported in my Despatch of the
15th September last. Additions both to the fixed and contingent
charges will however be unavoidable as the settlement increases
in numbers. The expenditure on account of the settlement from the
occupation of this Government in October last to the close of the
year, amounts to about &pound;3000, and has been defrayed from
the Revenue of Crown Lands, to which Revenue it is probable the
sale of Crown Lands situated within the District will hereafter
make a considerable addition. I propose to put such lands up to
sale as soon as the necessary surveys are completed.<br>

<p>It has already been mentioned, that Melbourne had previously
been known as the "Settlement", and by the singular
designation&mdash;"Bearbrass".</p>
<p>Mr. Arden complains, as early as 1840, of the area of the
town, as originally planned, being already too cramped. It
consisted of a frontage to the Yarra of only a mile, with a
breadth of three quarters. He says, "It is evident that Sir
Richard Bourke, in allowing so confined a portion, could have
formed no accurate estimate of the unrivalled growth it has since
manifested."</p>
<p>In the letter from Mr. Attorney-General Plunket to the
Colonial Secretary, a copy of which accompanies Governor Bourke's
despatch and bears the same date, June 13th, the difficulty of
administering justice at Port Phillip without the appointment of
a fourth Judge, is forcibly pointed out and illustrated. Mr.
Plunket says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In the case of Rex <i>v</i>. Whitehead for murder
committed at Port Phillip (lately tried at the Supreme Court) the
witnesses arrived the day after the regular Criminal sittings
ended. I endeavoured to have a day specially fixed for the trial
after giving the necessary notice to the prisoner; but my doing
so out of course was a cause of well-founded complaint, and
although the trial came on as soon as possible, the expenses paid
to witnesses not exceeding two in number (for a third though
material neglected to come at all) amounted to &pound;115
11<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. and after a close examination of their
actual expenses by the Crown Solicitor I am satisfied that sum
barely covered them."</blockquote>
<p>He also says, "At present I fear Port Phillip is not
sufficiently populous to admit of the introduction of Grand
Juries though it is for Petty Juries."</p>

<blockquote>"It is proposed to continue the appointment of a

<p>In a letter to A.Y. Spearman, Esq., the expenditure proposed
by Sir Richard Bourke in his despatch of June 13th, is
recommended to the Treasury, with the exception of that for a
government steam vessel, which Lord Glenelg defers for the
present to bring before the Treasury.</p>
<p>On September 10th, 1837, Sir Richard Bourke writes in the
following high terms of Captain Hobson and his officers, several
of whose names are borne on parts of Port Phillip Bay:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;His Majesty's ship
<i>Rattlesnake</i> having lately returned to the Indian Station
after a year's duty in these seas, I feel myself called upon to
bring under your Lordship's notice, the services which have been
rendered to this Colony by her commander. Captain William Hobson
and by several of the officers under his orders. Captain Hobson
was here at the time I received your Lordship's permission to
occupy Port Phillip, and having proposed to him to take the naval
charge of the expedition directed to proceed from hence, he most
readily undertook the duty and remained in Port Phillip in
constant and active employment, until the most necessary
arrangements were made on shore, and he had laid down buoys to
facilitate the navigation through some intricate channels, and
made considerable progress in a survey of the waters of Port
Phillip Bay. Upon a second visit he completed his charts, three
in number,&mdash;a general one of the coast of Port
Phillip;&mdash;one of the several navigable channels;&mdash;and a
third of Hobson's Bay. These have in the usual course of service
been forwarded to the Admiralty Hydrographer, but he has left
duplicates with me with permission to have them engraved, and as
many copies taken as the immediate exigencies of the service may
require. He has thus rendered the trade of this colony, and of
Van Diemen's Land very important benefit.<br>
<br>
"Having brought this service under your Lordship's notice it is
my duty, and I know it is Captain Hobson's wish, that I should
mention the names of those officers of the <i>Rattlesnake</i>,
who were principally engaged in making the survey. A large share
of the fatiguing duty of the measurement, and the task of laying
all the work down fell to Mr. Shortland, a mate of some standing,
and much respected by his commander. Lieutenant Symonds took the
next considerable part of the fatiguing duty in boats, and a part
was performed by Lieutenant Henry. Observations were made on
board by the first Lieutenant Richards, and the Master Pope. I
trust your Lordship will do me the favour to lay the names of
these meritorious officers before the Lords of the Admiralty,
with this brief account of the services they rendered to the
colony, in the hope that it may meet with encouragement and
reward.<br>
<br>
"To Captain Hobson I am further Indebted for the very able report
on the state of New Zealand, a copy of which I had the honour to
transmit with my despatch of the 9th inst. I have every reason to
believe that the recent pacification of the tribes which I have
reported, is in great measure attributable to the exertions made
by Captain Hobson when at New Zealand to effect so desirable an
object.<br>
<br>
"I have only to add that upon every occasion in which the
services of the Naval force under his command were required, I
obtained from Captain Hobson the most zealous and efficient
assistance.</blockquote>

<small>"RICHARD BOURKE</small>."   </p>
<p>In a letter of September 15th, 1837, to the Colonial Secretary
at Sydney, Messrs. Gibbs, collector, and Cooper, controller,
say,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"We beg to report that having taken into
consideration the state of trade now carrying on at Port
Phillip;&mdash;its extraordinary increase as compared with the
shortness of time which has elapsed since the formation of the
settlement and the rapid rise into importance which it has made;
together with the circumstances, that from the distance at which
it is situate from Port Jackson, the intercourse with Sydney is
unfrequent&mdash;and the difficulty and risk in conveying the
public money to the Treasury consequently great&mdash;we are of
opinion that it must ere long, if not immediately, become a
separate Port&mdash;for it is almost impossible to have that
control which is necessary for the good of the service, over
persons placed at a station five hundred miles distant, the
passage to and from which is seldom made in less than a month and
many weeks intervening between the departure of one vessel and
another.<br>
<br>
"Should the Governor take the same view of the case, which we are
inclined to think from the several conversations we have had the
honour to hold with his Excellency, he does&mdash;we beg to state
that the Controller of this Port would be happy to go down as
collector and take charge of the department there, on the same
salary as he now holds, from which measure it is apparent many
advantages must arise. . . . .<br>
<br>
"In accordance with the views of His Excellency the Governor, the
Controller would be willing also to undertake the duties of
Treasurer and Collector of Internal revenue, should no objection
be made to it, and we do not deem the union of these offices with
that of collector of customs incompatible.<br>
<br>
"The additional establishment necessary in this case, will be a
Collector, Collector's clerk and housekeeper at Melbourne, and in
the event of its being separated from Sydney, we would recommend
that it be made a free warehousing Port, and that its limits
should extend from the 37 degree of South Latitude to the western
limits of the colony."</blockquote>
<p>In a despatch of September 14th, 1837, enclosing this letter,
Sir Richard Bourke, "coincides in opinion," and recommends the
appointment of Mr. Cooper, as collector, allowing him "to act as
Under Treasurer, to receive monies and pay out on the Governor's
warrant," with "a salary of 200<i>l</i>. in addition to that of
collector."</p>
<p>In a letter of May 21st, 1838, from Mr. Spearman of the
Treasury to Mr. Stephen of the Colonial Office, Lord Glenelg is
informed that "the arrangements relating to the Customs
Establishment at Port Phillip, New South Wales, proposed in the
despatch of Governor Sir Richard Bourke, of the 14th September
last," cannot be sanctioned, on account of "so large an addition
to the expense of the establishment, . . . more especially as the
services of Mr. Cooper will continue to be required at the head
office in Sydney," My lords remark,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That the very recent formation of the settlement at
Port Phillip, and the limited information that has yet been
obtained as to the trade likely to be carried on there, have
prevented the Commissioners of Customs from offering an opinion
as to the nature and extent of the Establishment it will
eventually be proper to place there, and my Lords have therefore
considered it sufficient and the most expedient course, to leave
Mr. Webb the present Sub-Collector in charge of the Department at
that station, and that he should carry on the duties of it with
such assistance as the Governor on consulting with the principal
officers at Sydney may think necessary for a period of two years,
at the expiration of which time the requisite information for
enabling the Commissioners to suggest a more permanent
arrangement will doubtless be obtained. My Lords have, therefore,
conveyed the proper directions . . . that the present
Sub-Collector at Port Phillip should take charge of any sums that
may be received on account of land sales and any other branches
of Colonial Revenue at that station, and disburse or otherwise
dispose of the same in such manner as the Governor of New South
Wales may direct."<br>
<br>
"My Lords will not object to sanction the issue of a moderate
remuneration to the Sub-Collector, not exceeding &pound;100 per
annum, for the extra duty." **</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** May 29th, 1838, Lord Glenelg communicates
this decision to Sir George Gipps.]</p>
<p>With a despatch of January 16th, 1839, Sir G. Gipps encloses
to the Secretary of State a correspondence between the Colonial
Officers of Customs, and Mr. Deas Thomson, Colonial Secretary, on
the subject of the appointment of a Landing and Tide Surveyor at
Port Phillip,</p>
<p>Mr. W. Gibbes, collector, and Mr. Geo. Cooper, controller of
customs, in a letter of December 6th, 1838, point out the
necessity of appointing such an officer and recommend Mr. Le
Soeuf at a salary of 200<i>l</i>., and that Mr. Webb, the
sub-collector at Port Phillip, where the revenue had lately so
much increased, should be allowed a clerk at a salary of
100<i>l</i>. a year.</p>
<p>Mr. Deas Thomson writes in reply on December 31st, that the
Governor considers the appointments would occasion a large extra
expenditure, and desires further information as to the duties
performed by Mr. Webb. Messrs. Gibbes and Cooper, reply on the
27th, that the duties of Mr. Webb are most multifarious, and that
the revenue already amounts to 12,000<i>l</i>. per annum, adding
that "they must also repeat their opinion that a boat with a crew
of four men will be necessary to enable the duty to be correctly
done.'"</p>
<p>In a despatch of August 13th, 1839, the Marquis of Normanby,
Secretary for the Colonies, approves of the appointment which Sir
G. Gipps had sanctioned.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Willis, in a letter of December 15th, 1838,
expresses his opinion to the Governor, that the additional Judge
proposed to be appointed to the Supreme Court of the Colony
should reside, not at Sydney, as Chief Justice Dowling
recommended, but at Port Phillip.</p>
<p>A letter of December 26th, 1838, announces to Mr. Croke, his
appointment as Clerk of the Crown at Port Phillip, at a salary of
400<i>l</i>. a year. In a despatch of February 15th, 1839, Sir
Geo. Gipps announces his appointment of Mr. Hy. Nelson
Carrington, as Clerk of the Crown at Port Phillip, at the salary
of 200<i>l</i>. a year; but on July 18th, the Marquis of Normanby
refers to the fact that Lord Glenelg had previously appointed Mr.
Croke to that office. The arrival of Mr. Croke at Sydney on July
25th, 1839, and his re-embarkation for Port Phillip October 29th,
are announced in a despatch from the Governor of October 30th. On
October 3rd, 1839, Sir G. Gipps reports the establishment of
Courts of Request at Melbourne and Port Macquarie, and in another
despatch of the same date recommends the appointment of Mr. Ed.
Brewster, of the Irish Bar, to the Chairmanship of the Quarter
Sessions already established at the former, and also as
Commissioner of the Court of Requests, with a salary of
350<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>By despatch of October 21st, 1839, to the Marquis of Normanby,
Sir Geo. Gipps announces the appointment of Mr. C.M. Lewis to the
situation of Harbour-Master at Port Phillip, at a salary of
200<i>l</i>. a year.</p>
<p>In a despatch of October 30th, 1839, Sir G. Gipps states that
Mr. Croke will have no duties to perform as Clerk of the Crown
till the establishment of Assize or Circuit Courts at Port
Phillip, but that he is to act as Crown Prosecutor at Quarter
Sessions and Legal Adviser to the Government at Port Phillip. The
Governor also states that besides Mr. Brewster just mentioned,
and Mr. Croke, there was a third law officer at Port Phillip, Mr.
Carrington, Clerk of the Peace and to the Petty Sessions.</p>
<p>In writing on June 14th, 1837, Sir R. Bourke strongly
recommends to Lord Glenelg the appointment of Col. Kenneth
Snodgrass as Lieut.-Governor or Commandant at Port Phillip; and
in one of the 16th, Mr. Kinchela, who occupies temporarily a seat
on the Bench, is recommended as fourth Judge, should it be
decided to appoint one.</p>
<p>On January 20th, 1838, Mr. Spearman of the Treasury announces
to the Colonial Office, the Lords Commissioners' approval of an
allowance for the Commandant at Port Phillip at the rate of
800<i>l</i>., and also of the appointment of an additional Puisne
Judge recommended in the despatch of Sir Richard Bourke. A letter
from the Treasury of March 9th, conveys the concurrence in the
appointment of a Police Magistrate, &amp;c., at Geelong. Other
appointments recommended, except those relating to the customs,
were subsequently confirmed.</p>
<p>A letter from the Treasury of January 29th, 1838, requests
Lord Glenelg to direct that the sum of 5<i>l</i>. 4<i>s</i>.
0<i>d</i>. "incurred for victualling Captain Lonsdale and other
persons on board H.M.S. <i>Rattlesnake</i>, on their passage
between Sydney and Port Phillip," should be charged to the
account of the Government of New South Wales.</p>
<p>In writing on April 3rd, 1838, to Sir George Gipps, Lord
Glenelg says, with reference to some of the despatches of that
governor's predecessor,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have read with much satisfaction the report which
those despatches contain of the rapid progress of the new
settlement . . . The circumstances of the settlement fully
justify the appointment of a permanent Commandant, and I shall
take an early opportunity of signifying Her Majesty's selection
of an officer qualified to fill that appointment. Adverting to
the special authority which it is proposed to delegate to the
Commandant, H.M. Government do not object to sanction the
allowance of &pound;800 per annum which your predecessor has
recommended for the officer who may be selected for that command,
in lieu of all allowances for lodging, fuel, light and rations.
H.M. Government also approve of the appointment of an additional
Puisne Judge to the Judicial Establishment of your Government,
with a view to the holding Assizes at that remote district, as
well as to provide for an increased efficiency on the Bench. The
other appointments recommended by Sir R. Bourke are also
approved, including those in the District of Geelong. I have much
satisfaction in conveying to you Her Majesty's compliance with
the desire of the residents in that portion of the Colony that it
should bear the name of your predecessor under whose Government
the settlement was established."</blockquote>
<p>The author has not found among any of the documents, the exact
date of the appointment, made about this time, of Mr. Justice
Willis, as first resident judge at Port Phillip of the Supreme
Court of New South Wales, nor of his entry upon his duties. The
subsequent removal of the learned judge, for want of temper on
the Bench, was the subject of protracted discussion and inquiry.
Mr. Willis only died within the last few months.</p>
In the following letter, Mr. La Trobe thanks Lord Glenelg for his
appointment as Superintendent of Port Phillip.
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;I beg leave to express
my sense of the kindness which I have experienced at your
Lordship's hands, and of the confidence with which I have been
already honoured. I trust, my Lord, that in signifying my
grateful acceptance of the appointment which your Lordship has
now offered me, I am not acting presumptuously; and that your
Lordship will never have to remark, that I have underrated the
difficulties and responsibilities of the station in question, and
have overrated my own capacity and talents for meeting them. I
have the honour to be, my Lord,</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Your Lordship's humble and
obedient servant,</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<small>CHARLES JOSH. LA
TROBE</small>.   </p>
<p class="quote">      "<i>Sackville Street</i>,<br>
"19<i>th December</i>, 1838."</p>
<p>The letter officially notifying his appointment to Mr. La
Trobe is dated February 4th, 1839. The Colonial Office, on
January 7th, 1839, informs the Treasury, "that his Lordship has
appointed Mr. C.J. La Trobe to the office of superintendent at
that settlement," Port Phillip, "and moves their Lordships to
sanction the issue to Mr. La Trobe of a suitable rate of
allowance for the passage of himself and family. Mr. La Trobe
will have to proceed in the first instance to Sydney for the
purpose of communicating with Governor Sir George Gipps; and Lord
Glenelg considers that 400<i>l</i>. would not be more than
adequate allowance, being half the amount granted under the
existing regulations to the Governors of New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land, and recently granted to the Governor of Western
Australia."</p>
<p>Sir Geo. Gipps in a letter to the Marquis of Normanby, dated
Sydney, November 4th, 1839, acknowledges Lord Glenelg's despatch
of January 29th, 1839, informing him of "the appointment of Mr.
C.J. La Trobe as Superintendent of Port Phillip", and says, "I
have the honour to report to your Lordship that Mr. La Trobe
arrived at Sydney on the 26th July last; and that after remaining
a sufficient time at the seat of this Government to make himself
acquainted with our general method of conducting business, Mr. La
Trobe embarked for Port Phillip, and by a report from him
recently received, I learn that he arrived at Melbourne, and
entered on his duties on the 1st of October last."</p>
<p>The despatch encloses printed copy of a commission dated
September 9th, 1839, issued to Mr. La Trobe by the Governor, with
the advice of the Executive Council. It states that the Queen
through Lord Glenelg, Secretary of State for the Colonies, "had
been pleased to command that you, Chas. Joseph La Trobe, Esq.,
shall be appointed superintendent of the said
District"&mdash;which, both in the commission and letter of
instructions, is defined as lying to the south of the
thirty-sixth degree of south latitude, and between the one
hundred and forty-first and the one hundred and forty-sixth
degrees of east longitude.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Secretary of State, also of November 4th,
the Governor writes, "there is one point in these instructions to
which I think it right to ask your Lordship's attention in a
particular manner, namely, the limits which I have prescribed for
the District of Port Phillip, as it is possible that
circumstances may at some future period arise to make those
limits of importance. The features of the country not being
sufficiently known, to enable me to define the District by
natural boundaries, I have directed it to be considered as
consisting of that part of the Territory of New South Wales,"
described as above. "The Territory included within this boundary,
will be easily ascertained by the inspection of any map of
Australia."</p>
<p>The letter of instructions dated Sydney, September 10th, 1839,
to "His Hon. Chas. Joseph La Trobe, Esq." and signed by "E. Deas
Thomson," Colonial Secretary, after defining the area of Port
Phillip District, proceeds, "Within these limits you will
exercise the powers of a Lieut.-Governor, and will stand in the
same position in respect to the Governor of New South Wales, as
the Governor himself stands in with respect to the Right Hon. the
Secretary of State for the Colonies."</p>
<p>The instructions are very specific, regulations for the
collection and expenditure of revenue at Port Phillip being also
issued.</p>
<p>In consequence of the infant state of the settlement, Mr. La
Trobe deemed it expedient to take out a wooden house with him
from England.</p>
<p>In a despatch of July 14th, 1840, Sir Geo. Gipps informs Lord
J. Russell of the appointment of Captain Lonsdale, as
Sub-Treasurer at Melbourne, where the Governor anticipated the
revenue for the year would not be less than 200,000<i>l</i>. Sir
George spoke of Captain Lonsdale having, as Police Magistrate,
given great satisfaction to himself and his predecessor.</p>
<p>It is most desirable that the names of worthy men should be
preserved, in connexion with the laying of the foundation of the
Colony, in which they bore an honourable part. The particulars
respecting the offices which they held, serve also to illustrate
the early condition and requirements of the young community.</p>

been firmly established, are to be found in the Record Office. In
this chapter a selection is made from these papers, which will be
found useful and instructive, in illustrating the interesting
progress of the colony in various particulars.</p>
<p>The following memorial was addressed by a number of the
earliest settlers of Port Phillip, to His Excellency Sir Richard
Bourke, K.C.B.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>June</i> 8<i>th</i>,
1837.   </p>
<blockquote>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;As proprietors of Stock
depasturing in the Western District of Port Phillip we venture to
address ourselves to your Excellency, relying upon the interest
you have already taken in the welfare of this settlement.<br>
<br>
"Having yourself personally and on the spot ascertained the
number and importance of the various stations in this direction
we do not think it necessary to trouble you again with
statistical returns, but we cannot refrain from informing your
Excellency that since your visit progress has been made with a
rapidity which even the History of Port Phillip singular as it is
had not warranted us to expect.<br>
<br>
"But this increase has most unavoidably been accompanied by an
evil which we deeply deplore, but are without assistance unable
to check. Attracted by the expectations of receiving provisions
and clothing which have hitherto been liberally supplied them an
unusual number of natives have for some time past been collecting
in this neighbourhood and these forsaking their usual modes of
procuring food are depending upon the supplies they obtain either
by begging or plunder.<br>
<br>
"Hitherto the forbearance of our overseers and servants has been
deserving of all praise, to such an extent indeed, as evidently
to have strengthened an impression which is from some cause
unhappily entertained by the natives that they may act thus with
impunity. We are enabled to adduce the testimony of numerous and
disinterested visitors in proof of this forbearance; but we
cannot reasonably hope that it will always be exercised under the
increasing annoyances and inroads to which we are now daily
subjected. Already actual aggressions of the most determined
character have been made at some of our stations, the inevitable
consequence of which we painfully anticipate but are powerless to
prevent.<br>
<br>
"Under these circumstances we are constrained to appeal to you
for protection both for the natives and ourselves, most earnestly
entreating your Excellency to adopt such measures as may in your
judgment seem best calculated to avert any painful collision.<br>
<br>
"We would most respectfully ask your Excellency to appoint a
Police Magistrate to this district who may also act as Coroner;
and to place under his control a small body of Mounted Police
which traversing the district would by its presence we think
prevent hostilities, or should they unhappily occur, at least
control their violence.<br>
<br>
"We are however aware that an objection to this request, may
under the present state of things be urged by your Excellency, on
the ground of the expense a compliance with it would entail upon
your Government. We beg therefore to assure you (so strongly do
we feel the pressing necessity for such a precautionary measure)
of our willingness most readily to defray in any manner you may
propose the whole cost of such an establishment.<br>
<br>
"We bring this subject under your Excellency's notice from a
conviction that the enlightened policy which admits of the
propriety of assisting and directing a Colony of the British
Crown daily advancing and which must continue to advance in
importance will not fail to be recognized and acted upon under
your administration.<br>
<br>
"We may urge our request on the score of humanity and justice
since we feel assured that some prompt and efficient measures now
may save the lasting regret to which neglect must otherwise give
rise.<br>
<br>
"In the confident expectation that our communication will receive
your earliest convenient consideration we have the honour to
subscribe ourselves</blockquote>

<br>
<p>In a despatch of September 11th, 1837, transmitting the
preceding document to the Secretary of State, Sir Richard Bourke
describes these colonists as located "upon the Western shores of
Port Phillip, and along the rivers which flow into that estuary,
or into the sea adjacent," and says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"They evince a very laudable anxiety to prevent on
their part any aggression upon the natives and seem willing to
make considerable sacrifices to establish an amicable intercourse
with them.<br>
<br>
"The District which these settlers occupy and which may be called
by the native name of 'Geelong' is between 60 and 80 miles
distant from Melbourne and thus too far removed from the Civil
establishment at that place to derive any effective assistance
from it.<br>
<br>
"Under these circumstances I have thought it right to appoint a
Police Magistrate for Geelong with a small constabulary. I have
not directed any military to be stationed there, relying upon the
good disposition of the settlers to provide the magistrate with
such a force as shall enable him to execute the laws and to
preserve peace between them and the Aborigines. To the latter
object the protection and civilization of the Native blacks, I
have most earnestly called the Magistrate's attention and have
furnished him with instructions and with the necessary means as I
hope of accomplishing my wishes. I have appointed Captain Fyans
late of the 4th Regiment to this Magistracy, and place the
greatest reliance on his activity, humanity, good temper, and
considerate disposition.<br>
<br>
"This appointment will, I trust, meet with your Lordship's
approbation; at the same time I would beg leave to observe that
it is not calculated to obviate the expediency of those proposed
for adoption in my despatch before referred to. The necessity for
appointing a Lieutenant-Governor or Commandant, to control the
several subordinate functionaries placed at so great a distance
from the principal seat of Government becomes more apparent as
the number of these functionaries is enlarged. The increasing
exigencies of the Southern Districts will speedily require
further appointments, nor can they with reason be withheld as the
Local revenue to be derived from Land sales and customs will no
doubt furnish sufficient means for meeting the expense.<br>
<br>
"A schedule of the appointments now reported is annexed, which I
hope your Lordship will be pleased to confirm.</blockquote>

       "20<i>th September</i>, 1837."</p>
<p>The following letter of Col. Snodgrass, Acting-Governor of New
South Wales, written between the departure of Sir R. Bourke, and
the arrival of Sir G. Gipps, gives some interesting particulars
respecting the opening up of the Port Phillip territory.</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Government House,
Sydney</i>,   <br>
"23<i>rd February</i>, 1838.      </p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;I have the honour to
report to your Lordship that in consequence of more than one
murder being committed in the vicinity of Port Phillip under
circumstances proving the serious deficiency of means for
preventing such outrages, and for pursuing the
perpetrators,&mdash;I considered it necessary to order a sergeant
and six rank and file of the Mounted Police to proceed to that
Territory as a protection to the peaceable and well-disposed
Inhabitants and to aid the Civil Power established at Melbourne
and Geelong (the two principal Towns) in the execution of their
duties. The late Governor Sir Richard Bourke brought under your
Lordship's notice the establishment of a land communication with
Port Phillip which commenced running from the beginning of the
present year. To this it was also necessary to afford protection,
and by having a party of Mounted Police at the extremities of the
road for the interception of robbers or runaways this will be in
a great measure accomplished. I am happy at being able to state
that the mail has been run regularly by the contractor, and the
road is now travelled upon daily without difficulty or danger by
those who are removing with their sheep and cattle to this new
country. I am, however, sorry to acquaint your Lordship that the
surveying party has not made the progress that was anticipated in
the laying out and measurement of the Lands for public sale at
Port Phillip. This has been a great disappointment to many
immigrants as well as to people who are desirous to proceed from
this part of the country and Van Diemen's Land to settle there,
and I therefore, to hasten so desirable an object, ordered two
more surveyors and a clerk to proceed thither, and the surveyors
have accordingly gone by land with a full surveying equipment. By
this means the best line of road will be marked and places for
fixing the few punts required across the rivers will be pointed
out without much loss of time, as even in doing this they will
arrive at their destination fully equipped nearly as soon and at
much less expense than if forwarded by sea, taking into
consideration the detention in waiting for a vessel, and the
great uncertainty of the time the voyage might occupy. It did not
appear to me advisable to withdraw any of the Mounted Police from
their stations within the located boundaries of this Colony, and
I was therefore obliged to add to the number of the men required
for Port Phillip to the strength of that corps from the regiments
of Infantry serving in the command. I do not, however, consider
that it will be necessary to augment the present strength of the
Surveyor-General's Department, in consequence of the numbers
required for Port Phillip, by more than one assistant-surveyor
and one clerk. The establishment at Port Phillip will consist,
including the present augmentation, of one Surveyor and four
Assistant-Surveyors with one clerk,&mdash;but two of the
Assistant-Surveyors (the number now added) may be brought back to
head-quarters by the end of this year, and as the demand for land
to be measured for sale in this part of the country is likely to
be comparatively limited until at least that time, there is
sufficient strength left here to meet the demand,</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right">"I have the honour to be,"
&amp;c.            <br>
"(Signed)            <small>K. SNODGRASS</small>."   </p>
<p>Early troubles with the natives have unfortunately to be
recorded. On May 2nd, 1838, in a P.S. to a despatch of April
27th, Sir Geo. Gipps writes to Lord Glenelg,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"From the South, we have accounts of a large convoy
of sheep and cattle belonging to a gentleman of the name of
Faithfull having been attacked on the 13th ult. on the way to
Port Phillip, and eight men killed out of eighteen, who formed
Mr. Faithfull's party. The particulars of this last occurrence I
have not yet received, but I have directed a civil stipendiary
magistrate and a party of the mounted police to proceed with all
possible haste to the spot, and have given them particular
instructions for their guidance. The blacks who are supposed to
have murdered the two men belonging to the surveying party have
been taken, and will be tried before the Supreme
Court."</blockquote>
<p>The following letter of Colonel White, of the 96th Regiment,
dated Left Bank of the Ovens, April 15th, 1838, informs the
Colonial Secretary, "of a most furious attack having been made on
18 men of Mr. Wm. Faithfull's, at the Swampy River or Winding
Swamp, by about 300 of the aboriginal natives. It appears that on
the morning of the 10th inst., when they were putting their
bullocks to, the dash was made, when eight of the white men were
unfortunately slain, and property, I believe considerable,
destroyed. Mr. George Faithfull was on his way to this party when
he fell in with one of the mangled corpses of the white men;
several were found and buried. Mr. Faithfull has fallen back on
my station with the escaped people, and one wounded man, who is
so dreadfully lacerated, that I believe he cannot survive."</p>
<p>A memorial, signed by eighty-two colonists, landowners and
proprietors of stock, dated Sydney, June 8th, 1838, calls the
attention of Sir George Gipps to the state of "the new settlement
at Port Phillip. . . . arising from the hostility of the
aborigines." and states that "many have been obliged to abandon
their stations," and that "the intercourse by land between this
part of the territory and Port Phillip, if it has not already
ceased, has become one of imminent danger to life and property."
The memorialists state, that "they are not aware of any
aggression. . . . which could have excited the blacks," but that
they "have been stimulated by their natural cupidity and
ferocity."</p>
<p>The Colonial Secretary, in a reply of June 23rd, states, "That
in order to afford the settlers in those districts all the
protection in His Excellency's power, he despatched a party,
consisting of an officer and 12 men of the mounted police, to the
River Ovens, as soon as he heard of the late massacre of Mr.
Faithfull's men, and that this party has since been increased to
21; so that with the seven that were originally at Melbourne,
there will be a party of one officer and 28 mounted policemen,
independently of the military force, which by a recent addition
of 12, now amounts to 44; and that a discretionary power has been
given to the police magistrate at Melbourne to cause parties of
infantry to advance, if necessary, into the interior. . . . it is
also the Governor's intention to establish posts at convenient
distances along the road, from Yass to Port Phillip, in order to
keep open the communication, and that a permanent addition will
be made to the mounted police for this purpose." The reply
further states, that as Sir Geo. Gipps, "has the most positive
directions from Her Majesty's Government to treat the aboriginal
natives as subjects of Her Majesty, it is entirely out of his
power to authorize the levying of war against them, or to give
sanction to any measures of indiscriminate retaliation."</p>
<p>In Sir George Gipps' despatch of July 21st,
1838&mdash;forwarding the memorial and his reply, to Lord
Glenelg,&mdash;the Governor says, "It is necessary that I should
explain to your Lordship that some of the gentlemen who signed
the memorial had previously waited upon me and requested that I
would either myself levy war against the blacks, or sanction the
enrolment of a militia for the purpose and allow them to be
supplied with arms and munitions of war from Her Majesty's
stores." The despatch also encloses a "short abstract of the
principal outrages between blacks and whites, which have been
reported in the last three months," with the remark "that a great
proportion of these acts of violence have occurred in the
neighbourhood of Port Phillip, or on the road between the settled
parts of this colony and that place." The statement mentions
three outrages "to the north of Sydney," and describes the
following, "On the Port Phillip or southern side of the
Colony:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"1. Between the rivers Ovens and Goulburn, a large
convoy of sheep and cattle, belonging to Mr. W. Pitt Faithfull,
and under the charge of fifteen white men, was attacked by a
party of blacks, said to have been 800 strong. Seven of the white
men were killed and the rest, as well as the whole of the cattle,
dispersed in all directions. This occurrence took place about 400
miles from Sydney, and 150 from Port Phillip.<br>
<br>
"2. On the 15th April the cattle station of Mr. Samuel Jackson,
near Port Phillip, was attacked by about fifty blacks, some of
whom had fire-arms; about fifty sheep were carried away, though
some of them were afterwards recovered.<br>
<br>
"3. On the 22nd April the station of Mr. John Gardiner, near Port
Phillip, was attacked by a party of blacks; some of whom had
fire-arms. They were, however, repulsed, and two of them who were
subsequently taken were recognized as having been under the
instruction of Mr. Langhorne, missionary at Port Phillip. No
lives were lost, though shots were fired on both sides.<br>
<br>
"4. On or about the same day a flock of 520 sheep, belonging to
Mr. Kenneth Clark, was driven away from his station to a distance
of seven or eight miles by the blacks. All were, however,
recovered with the exception of forty-three.<br>
<br>
"5. On the 6th May the flocks of Dr. Jonathan Clark were attacked
by a party of blacks, who had dogs with them, and twenty sheep
were carried off.<br>
<br>
"6. On the 19th May, Thomas Jones, a servant in the employ of Mr.
Bowman, was murdered by the blacks, about sixty miles from Port
Phillip. On the preceding day a flock of sheep had been driven
away from Mr. Bowman's station, though all were subsequently
recovered, with the exception of four.<br>
<br>
"7. On or about the 22nd May all the stations on the Burwan
Creeks, extending to a distance of more than thirty miles from
Geelong, (on the western side of Port Phillip,) were attacked,
for the second time, by a party of about sixty blacks. Several
huts were plundered; one flock of sheep was driven to a distance
of seven or eight miles, three were killed and twenty-five
wounded From another station sixteen lambs were carried off, and
from a third, six sheep and six lambs; and other mischief is
reported to have been done to a considerable extent.<br>
<br>
"June 1st, a black man, supposed to have been engaged in a murder
committed some months ago, near Geelong, was drowned in an
attempt to escape from the persons who were in pursuit of
him.<br>
<br>
"June 9th, seven or eight blacks were killed in defending a flock
of sheep which they had carried away from the station of Mr.
Yaldwyn, about eighty miles from Port Phillip. On this occasion
the blacks are said to have defended themselves with great
bravery.<br>
<br>
"N.B. A great number of less important outrages have come
indirectly to the knowledge of the Government, or been reported
in the newspapers. And it is said that a white woman, the wife of
a soldier, has been murdered between Melbourne and Geelong,
though no official account has been received of it.<br>
<br>
       "<i>July</i>, 1838."</blockquote>
<p>Lord Glenelg in a long despatch of January 31st, 1838, already
cited&mdash;in reference to the proposed removal of the Tasmanian
blacks to Portland&mdash;announces his intention to appoint
protectors. In a despatch of November 3rd, 1838, Sir G. Gipps
expresses to Lord Glenelg, doubts whether the Legislative Council
would vote the sum for the protectors; but remarks that
"fortunately as the Protectors are all nominated for Port
Phillip, the whole expenses of which are as yet paid out of the
Crown Revenue, it was not necessary in the late session to bring
the question before them. I may here be permitted to observe,
that the simple fact of the expense of the settlement being
defrayed out of the territorial Revenue (without any reference to
the Council) would seem to imply that the right to appropriate
this revenue had not passed away entirely from the Crown."</p>
<p>Unhappily, during the first few years, too many collisions
between the settlers and the natives have to be
recorded&mdash;often provoked by the aggressions of the latter;
the former were, however, sometimes to blame for the severity of
the punishments inflicted. One or two trials of white men for
murders of aborigines took place; but there can be no doubt that
the great majority of the early settlers treated the blacks with
humanity and kindness. There are a good many reports on the
subject of these collisions, as well as respecting the aborigines
generally, in the Record Office. The question of improving their
condition is treated at great length, in a report of the
proceedings of the Executive Council of New South Wales of 1849.
The abolition of the Protectors was recommended, Governor Fitzroy
consenting; and no means seemed available to preserve the native
race.</p>
<p>On September 6th, 1837, Governor Bourke replies to a despatch
of Lord Glenelg, of February 15th, on the subject of the price of
Crown Lands, making the following observations with respect to
those at Port Phillip:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"My attention is there called to the discretionary
power vested in me by recent instructions, of fixing the upset
price of land at Port Phillip, at a lower rate than elsewhere,
but 'for the purpose only,' as your Lordship observes, 'of
enabling me to determine such a minimum as would prevent the
inevitable result of fixing it too high, namely, an unauthorized
occupation without purchase,&mdash;and a consequent dispersion of
settlers throughout the territory.'<br>
<br>
"It will long before this have been made known to your Lordship,
that I have not found it necessary to avail myself of this
discretion, and I am happy to find that your Lordship's further
explanation so fully upholds the interpretation placed by the
Legislative Council upon the previous instruction received upon
this subject, and justifies the desire which I have uniformly
felt to maintain the present regulations inviolate, both in
respect to the upset price, and to competition, whenever land is
offered for sale by this Government. The survey at Port Phillip
has not yet proceeded so far as to allow of any land being
disposed of out of the townships of Melbourne and William's Town,
but the half-acre allotments sold at these places having been put
up at a minimum rate of &pound;5 have realized an average price
of &pound;35 19<i>s</i>. each, and I have no apprehension of any
difficulty in disposing of country sections in the neighbourhood
of the port and rivers as fast as they can be measured for sale,
at a price at least equal to that at which the waste lands are
disposable in the more ancient settlements. Such being the case,
the South Australian Commissioners will have no further cause for
the alarm expressed in the letter of their Chairman, lest the
land at Port Phillip should be sold at a lower rate than
elsewhere in this colony."</blockquote>

<p>A memorial, dated Glasgow, October 23rd, 1838&mdash;from
Messrs. John Dennistoun, Patrick Wood, Frederick Adamson, John
Cross Buchanan, and William Cross, "proprietors of stock and
intending purchasers of land at Port Phillip"&mdash;prays that
sales of land shall take place there, and the money be remitted
to send out emigrants.</p>
<p>A reply is sent from the Colonial Office, dated November 10th,
enclosing a copy of a letter of the same date, addressed to
Governor Gipps, which runs thus:&mdash;"I think it obviously
desirable that arrangements should be made for effecting the
sales of land within the settlement at Port Phillip, and although
it might be inconvenient to separate the accounts of receipt and
expenditure of the revenue in different districts of the colony,
it is but reasonable that a fair proportion of the revenue
derived from the sale of land should be applied in facilitating
emigration to Port Phillip. I have therefore to request that you
will from time to time inform me of the amount derived from the
sale of land at Port Phillip."</p>
<p>By a proclamation in the New South Wales Government Gazette of
May 22nd, 1839, Governor Sir George Gipps, in accordance with the
act of that year of Her Majesty's reign&mdash;"To restrain the
unauthorized occupation of Crown Lands"&mdash;declares certain
lands, "beyond the limits at present allotted for location,"
divided into nine districts, the boundaries of which are
defined:&mdash;1. Port Macquarie District. 2. New England
District. 3. Liverpool Plains District. 4. Blight District. 5.
Wellington District. 6. Lachlan District. 7. Morumbidgee
District. 8. Monaroo District; and 9. Port Phillip District. The
whole of the Lands comprised in the District lying to the south
of the main range, between the Rivers Owens and Goulburn, and
adjacent to Port Phillip."</p>
<p>On October 1st, 1838, Sir George Gipps writes to Lord
Glenelg:&mdash;"The settlement of Port Phillip is, I am happy to
say, rapidly advancing; the first sale of land for agricultural
purposes took place on the 12th inst., when the prices realized
far exceeded my expectations. I enclose for your Lordship's
information a return of all the land that has been sold since the
settlement was first established. The number of inhabitants of
all descriptions is supposed now to exceed 3000, of whom,
however, a considerable number are convicts, as it has been found
impossible to prevent prisoners from being taken there,
notwithstanding the desire expressed by your Lordship to limit
the number as much as possible; and I must respectfully express
an opinion, that if it had been intended to prevent altogether
the assignment of convicts in that part of the territory, it
would have been better to have made it a separate
government."</p>

<p>In a despatch of December 10th, 1839, Sir George Gipps sends
the Marquis of Normanby the following "Return of all land sold at
Port Phillip, since the settlement was first opened in 1837,"
remarking,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Your Lordship will perceive by this Return that the
gross quantity of land sold is 86,208 acres, and the total sum
produced &pound;117,477 4<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. consequently that
the land has realized on the whole, the average price of
27<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. per acre, including both Town and
Country.<br>
<br>
"If we deduct 117 acres within the Town of Melbourne, which sold
at "nearly &pound;209 per acre, and nearly 2469 acres, within
five miles of the Town, which produced about &pound;10 9<i>s</i>.
per acre we shall still find that the agricultural or pastoral
land, sold in lots of 640 acres each realized 16<i>s</i>.
1<i>d</i>. per acre; the upset price having been at the first
sales only 5<i>s</i>., and at the latter 12<i>s</i>. per
acre.<br>
<br>
"I would beg, however, your Lordship's attention to the fact,
that this land has been sold continuously, according as the
survey advanced, with such reserve only as it is prudent to make
for the future advantage of the people; and that consequently
good land and bad has been sold together."</blockquote>

<p>In another letter of the same date, the Governor says, "Our
land sales at Port Phillip have exceeded my expectations."</p>
<p>A despatch to Lord John Russell, dated June 30th, 1840, from
Sir George Gipps reports the exceedingly satisfactory state of
the revenue, resulting from "&pound;233,219 2<i>s</i>.
8<i>d</i>., having been realized by the sale of 125,554 acres,
being at the average of &pound;1 17<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. per
acre," and that "the average of Town allotments in Melbourne is
&pound;939 per acre; of Town allotments in Country Towns (or
villages rather) &pound;88 per acre; the average of Country Land
at Port Phillip, &pound;1 15<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. per acre; the
average of other Country Land, 13<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. per acre."
The Governor says, "I could not safely have made any report on
the subject earlier, as the account of a great Land Sale on the
10th and 11th of the present month, at Port Phillip, which
realized &pound;104,000 reached me only a day or two ago."</p>
<p>In a despatch of December 19th, 1840, Sir George Gipps
encloses to Lord John Russell, the report of a Board appointed to
estimate the value of the unsold lands within five miles of
Melbourne and Geelong, exclusive of the towns themselves, from
which it appears that those of the former, amounting to 34,900
acres, were valued at &pound;872,500 being &pound;25 an acre, and
those of the latter to 25,320 acres at &pound;81,210, being
&pound;3 an acre. A "return of all land sold in the District of
Port Phillip, from the opening of the Settlement (in June 1837)
to the 10th December, 1840,'" gives 159,664 acres, yielding
&pound;223,058 7<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>., and 364 acres. Town
allotments yielding &pound;107,709 16<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>On August 20th, 1838, Mr. W.H. Dutton stated, before a
committee of the Legislative Council at Sydney on the subject of
emigration, that he had stations "beyond the Grampian Hills at
Portland Bay, more than 1000 miles from Sydney." Mr. S.K.
Salting, "a merchant resident in Sydney, and having grazing
establishments, in the district of Port Phillip, near Mount
Macedon, between 400 and 500 miles from Sydney," stated that he
had recently returned from Port Phillip, after being there nearly
a month, where he found a great want of labour, wages being
15<i>s</i>. a week. Mr. Salting's opinion was that&mdash;"The
establishments in Port Phillip are much in want of labour; in
fact are decidedly distressed for it. I would have been equally
so, but for the measures which I have taken to introduce
labourers for myself. . . . I think that in a district comprised
within a line drawn from Geelong on the west to Mount Macedon,
thence to the River Goulburn, and along that river and the Yarra
Yarra, so as to terminate at Western Port, from 1000 to 1500
shepherds and labourers might find employment immediately. I do
not think there is at present any great want of domestic
servants, except in the town of Melbourne."</p>
<p>The two next communications must have crossed each other; for
Sir George Gipps writes to Lord Glenelg, October 1st, 1838, in
the letter already referred to,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I beg leave to recommend to your Lordship, that a
Government emigrant ship should, as soon as possible, be sent to
Port Phillip, and that another should follow after a lapse of
four or five months.<br>
<br>
"A mixed company of emigrants, partly mechanics and partly
farm-labourers, would be most acceptable; and the mechanics
should consist principally of carpenters, bricklayers (not
masons), and smiths.</blockquote>
<p>In a letter of November 10th, 1838, Lord Glenelg expresses a
wish "that if practicable arrangements shall be made for sending
a ship with emigrants at an early period direct to that
settlement."</p>
<p>In a memorandum of December 19th, 1840, "on the disposal of
Lands in the Australian Provinces", Sir George Gipps, at
considerable length, informs the Secretary of State on the
subject, and states that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"A very large proportion of the land which is to form
the new district of Port Phillip is already in the licensed
occupation of the squatters of New South Wales, a class of
persons whom it would be wrong to confound with those who bear
the same name in America, and who are generally persons of mean
repute and of small means, who have taken unauthorized possession
of patches of land. Among the squatters of New South Wales are
the wealthiest of the land, occupying with the permission of the
Government, thousands and tens of thousands of acres. Young men
of good families and connexions in England, officers of the army
and navy, graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, are also in no small
number amongst them."</blockquote>
<p>In a despatch of April 3rd, 1844, Sir George again speaks in
high terms of the squatters of New South Wales, among whom, he
says, there were "a great number of young men, every way entitled
to be called gentlemen&mdash;young men of education, and many of
good family and connexions in Europe. The presence of young men
of this description beyond the boundaries, has been highly
advantageous, first in lessening the rudeness of society in what
is called the 'Bush', and secondly as affording the materials for
a local magistracy. On a former occasion I remarked how unjust it
would be to confound the squatters of Australia with those who
bear the same name in America."</p>

1838, appears,&mdash;</p>

Phillip was &pound;15,000, and that for the latter it was

embraced in the schedule from the establishment of the department
on 1st of March, 1828&mdash;"extending the communication by post
from Port Phillip to Morton Bay and from Sydney westward to
Wellington, travelling overland at this date, at the rate of
<i>two hundred and eighty thousand four hundred and sixty
four</i> miles for the year, exclusive of mails conveyed by steam
and sailing vessels, with a despatch and regularity quite
unexampled in a department of so recent a formation." The annual
extensions are thus recorded,&mdash;</p>

obliged to remain content with having their English letters

<p>The report also states that the Committee have not taken any
evidence with respect to the necessary Police Establishments for
the districts of Port Phillip, because they could not obtain
sufficient data respecting "that important part of the colony,
but recommend that His Honour the Superintendent should be
requested to make investigations into the state of its Police
Establishments."</p>
<p>A return of the Mounted Police reports that, "twenty in all
are stationed in five parties in the district of Port Phillip,
and on the line of route from Port Phillip to the river
Hume."</p>
<p>A despatch of June 25th, 1839, from Sir George Gipps informs
the Secretary of State, that the Treasury having refused to
sanction the removal to Port Phillip of Mr. Cooper the
Comptroller, the contingent proposal to make Melbourne a free
warehousing Port had fallen through, and therefore that the
indulgence of allowing goods to be shipped in bond had been
withdrawn. Sir George informs Lord Glenelg that he had again
allowed it, and expresses the hope that his Lordship will "in
consideration of the rising commerce of Port Phillip, and the
daily increasing importance of the town of Melbourne, approve of
what he has done;" and that on his "Lordship's representation to
the Lords of the Treasury an Order in Council may be procured
declaring Melbourne a free warehousing Port, similar to that
which on the 20th November, 1835, was issued in favour of the
Ports of Sydney, Hobart Town, and Launceston."</p>
<p>In a memorial of merchants, stockholders, &amp;c., at Port
Phillip, printed at the "Port Phillip Gazette" Office, Melbourne,
and enclosed by Sir George Gipps in his despatch, the following
facts are stated,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That so late only as the month of June, 1837, did
the waste and uncultivated land of this now flourishing town
become the legal property of individuals; that at the sale then
and the three subsequently held for the town allotments and
country sections in the district (total 371 town allotments and
56,326 acres of land), no less a sum than &pound;69,099
16<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. has been realized by the Colonial
Government, being &pound;21,858 11<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. greater
than the aggregate amount obtained by the sale of waste land in
the whole territory of New South Wales, for the years 1832-3-4,
that followed the promulgation of Lord Ripon's regulations,
restricting the alienations of Crown Lands thenceforth to the
system of sales by auction; that in the short period of little
more than one year-and-a-half, where all before was a forest, a
town has arisen of well-constructed and substantial buildings,
which in a short time bids fair to riyal the metropolis itself,
from the energy and enterprise everywhere apparent, and from the
circumstance of its being the capital from whence all the
interior stations must draw their supplies,&mdash;stations
extending from the Murray northerly to the Glenelg westerly,
embracing a territory almost unlimited in extent of soil,
unequalled for its fertility, and no less admirably calculated
for the pasturage of stock than for the maintenance of a dense
population. . . .<br>
<br>
"But above all, as connected with the growing prosperity of the
town of Melbourne, your memorialists would entreat your
Excellency's serious attention to the large amount of capital
invested in this district; the quantity of stock alone
depasturing in these fertile plains being estimated to exceed
500,000 sheep and 15,000 head of cattle; whilst the export of
wool for the present season, the second year of its existence,
will amount to upwards of 750,000 pounds, being positively a
greater quantity by 342,884 pounds, than was exported from the
entire Colony of New South Wales in 1827. Next year, in
consequence of the extraordinary immigration of settlers with
their flocks and herds pouring in to this favoured district from
New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, and of capitalists from
South Australia, it is anticipated that our export will not be
less than 1,500,000 pounds&mdash;a quantity equal to the export
from the entire Colony of New South Wales, even so late as the
year 1832, being sufficient to load fifteen ships direct to
England. Independent of this extraordinary export, this district
has directly and indirectly through the enterprising spirit of
its Colonists, promoted the Colonization of its sister Colony of
South Australia, by an export of no less than forty-five hundred
head of cattle, and twenty-five thousand sheep, the importance of
which importation at Adelaide has been most gratefully
acknowledged. Melbourne, owing to the indomitable energy and
enterprising spirit of its valued Colonist Mr. Joseph Hawdon, was
the first that established the feasibility of supplying the Royal
Province of South Australia with stock, by an overland route, and
thus opened a communication from which invaluable benefits must
flow. The cause of geographical knowledge in which the whole
civilized world is deeply interested, was thus also promoted at
the expense of a private Port Phillipian, as Mr. Hawdon traversed
a line of country not less than five hundred miles previously
unexplored; and next year it is his intention to prosecute his
researches still further into the interior of this vast
continent, in order to open a market at Swan River in Western
Australia."<br>

Chairman."   </p>
<p>Mr. Deas Thomson, Colonial Secretary, in a letter of June
17th, 1839, informs some of the gentlemen who had waited on the
Governor with this memorial, that on the day the letter was
written directions bad been given "for facilities to be afforded
to the Commerce of the town of Melbourne, similar to those which
in the latter part of the year 1837 were granted to it, but
subsequently discontinued in consequence of the non-arrival of
any definite orders on the subject from England", and that
"instructions had been given for the admission at Melbourne of
goods on bond so soon as stores fit for the purpose" should be
erected.</p>
<p>A despatch of December 26th, 1839, from the Colonial Office,
conveys Lord John Russell's recommendation to the Treasury, that
Sir George Gipps' proceedings in the matter should be sanctioned;
and by letter of Feb. 6th, 1840, their Lordships convey to the
Secretary for the Colonies, their consent to the "establishment
of a Free Port and Free Warehousing Port at Melbourne." In a
despatch of Nov. 27th, 1844, Sir George Gipps, enclosed a printed
petition, dated Sept. 25th from the Legislative Council of New
South Wales, presented by the Speaker, praying that the town of
Geelong may "be declared either a Free Warehousing Port, or Port
of Entry and Clearance," Geelong is described as "the only
natural outlet available," of the "district of Grant," which is
stated to have had an "export of wool, tallow, hides, wheat, and
various other articles of merchandise, the value of which, during
the present year, may be estimated at not less than
&pound;150,000." Sir George dissents from the prayer of the
petition, which was not granted.</p>
<p>A similar memorial from the inhabitants of the place was also
refused; but the privilege was ultimately conferred on Geelong
and Portland in 1848.</p>
<p>In a despatch dated September 28th, 1840, from Sir George
Gipps to the Secretary of State, Lord John
Russell&mdash;"transmitting a report of the discovery and
occupation of that Colony during the period of his administration
of the Government,"&mdash;his Excellency says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Our flocks and herds already stray over a country
900 miles long by 300 wide."</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<blockquote>"The quantity of stock on which assessment was paid
for the half-year ending the 31st December, 1839, was 7088
horses; 371,699 homed cattle; 1,334,593 sheep; and the number of
licensed stations was 694. . . . Towards the north, stations
already extend to the country behind Morton Bay, 300 miles beyond
the limits of location; to the south and west, they extend beyond
Port Phillip, to the boundaries of South Australia."</blockquote>
<p>Speaking of the Australian Alps or Snowy Mountains, Sir George
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Although a cattle station has been pushed beyond
these mountains by a gentleman of the name of MacAlister, the
country between them and the sea was altogether unknown until the
month of March last, when Count Streleski. . . . . attempted and
achieved the exploration of it."</blockquote>
<p>The Governor encloses a copy of this worthy discoverer's
account of his expedition, remarking,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I cannot do so without making your Lordship aware of
the feelings of respect and esteem which have been excited
towards him amongst the people of this Colony. . . . .<br>
<br>
"The district of Port Phillip was opened, and the town of
Melbourne founded, by Sir Richard Bourke in the year 1837; but,
with the exception of a few town allotments, no land had been
sold when I entered on the government of New South Wales in the
month of February, 1838.<br>
<br>
"Aided by the resources of this Colony, but without the
assistance of borrowed money, and unaided by artifice or
delusion, or by attempts in England to calumniate its elder
sister, this new settlement has, I believe, in the judgment of
all impartial persons, equalled, if not surpassed, its boastful
rival in South Australia.<br>
<br>
"The map which I transmit herewith will show the quantity of land
surveyed, and also the quantity sold at Port Phillip; the number
of acres sold up to the present time is 159,494; and the net
amount realized, &pound;312,700 10<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>., being an
average rate &pound;1 19<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. per acre. The net
amount of other revenues collected at Melbourne was in the year
1837, &pound;2538 15<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>.; 1838, &pound;2819
17<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>.; 1839, &pound;14,703 5<i>s</i>.
10<i>d</i>., and in the first six months of 1840, &pound;11,747
3<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>
"To the westward of Port Phillip, and near upon the confines of
South Australia, is Portland Bay, where an unauthorized
settlement was formed in 1835 by some gentlemen from Van Diemen's
Land, in the same manner that the first unauthorized settlement
was formed at Melbourne and Geelong by the Port Phillip
Association. The attention of the Government was drawn to
Portland Bay in 1839; and the necessity of forming a settlement
there manifested itself shortly afterwards, when the fact was
ascertained that stations had been established in the fine
country to the north of it on the River Glenelg, visited by Sir
Thomas Mitchell in 1836, and by him called Australia
Felix."</blockquote>
<p>The despatch gives the result of the report&mdash;a printed
copy of which it encloses&mdash;of Mr. Tyers' expedition, which
ascertained that the mouth of the River Glenelg was to the east
of the 141&deg;, the boundary of New South Wales and South
Australia. Sir George Gipps then proceeds,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In the immediate neighbourhood of Portland Bay,
there is a narrow slip of good land, between which and the
fertile lands of the Australia Felix of Major Mitchell, there is
an intervening tract of poor country of nearly forty miles in
extent; as this latter is however easily traversed, there can be
little doubt that the good lands will speedily be
occupied,&mdash;and a Government Establishment at Portland Bay
has become therefore indispensable.<br>
<br>
"A Town indeed has been laid out by Mr. Tyers, and the first
allotments will be sold on the 15th October next.</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<blockquote>"Along the whole of the road from Sydney to Port
Phillip, villages have been laid out, and Police Stations formed
by the Government, according to the intention reported in my
despatch of 21st July, 1838; this road is therefore now as safe,
and as easily traversed, as any other in the Colony&mdash;indeed
it may be mentioned as a proof of the open and accessible
character of the country that this road, or at least the portion
of it which lies between Yass and Melbourne, about 880 miles in
extent, has been opened at no coat whatever to the Government,
and very little to individuals; and that it is not only
practicable, but easy throughout its whole length for carriages
of any description.". . . . .</blockquote>
<p>In the report of Count Streleski's exploration of Gippsland,
enclosed with the despatch, the explorer among other interesting
particulars describes his ascent of and view from Mount
Kosciusko"&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Once on the crest of the range, the remainder of the
ascent to its highest pinnacle was accomplished with comparative
ease. On the 15th February, about noon, I found myself on an
elevation of 6510 feet above the level of the sea, seated on
perpetual snow, a lucid sky above me, and below an uninterrupted
view over more than 7000 square miles. . . . The particular
configuration of this eminence struck me so forcibly, by the
similarity it bears to the tumulus elevated at Krakow over the
tomb of the patriot Kosciusko, that, although in a foreign
country, on foreign ground, but amongst a free people, who
appreciate freedom and its votaries, I could not refrain from
giving it the name of Mount Kosciusko."</blockquote>
<p>Count Streleski thus gives his impression of the territory
which he explored, and to which he gave the name of the then
governor of New South "Wales:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Scarcely any spot I know, either within or without
the boundaries of New South Wales, on a large or small scale, can
boast more advantages than Gippsland. On an extent of 5600 square
miles it has upwards of 250 miles of sea-coast; two already known
harbours, that of Comer Inlet and Western Port, besides those for
small craft, which more than probably exist where her rivers
disembogue; eight rivers, in addition to a navigable lake and
lagoons which bisect 100 miles of its length; 8600 square miles
of forest, plains, valleys, which in richness of soil, pasturage
and situation cannot be surpassed; 2000 square miles of coast
range, with the most excellent quality of blue gum-tree and black
butt, embracing valleys large and deep, and holding out high
expectations for the cattle-breeder."</blockquote>
<p>The report of Mr. Tyers contains many interesting particulars
respecting different places in Western Victoria. His expedition
started from Melbourne on October 8th, 1839, and proceeding
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Geelong to Portland and the Glenelg returned by
"Boninyon",&mdash;where the Mount was ascended&mdash;reaching
Melbourne again March 5th. The list of "Native Names of several
Hills, Rivers, &amp;c., derived from the information of the
native Blacks <i>Tommy</i> and <i>Billy</i>" is interesting.</p>

<p>Two small charts are contained in the printed report of the
expedition.</p>
<p>In a report to Mr. La Trobe of December 30th, 1843, Mr.
Robinson, Chief Protector of Aborigines, describes a journey of
inspection, of upwards of 1000 miles, which he had made through
the territory, and communicates some geographical corrections. He
states that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Tongwillum is the original name of the Murray, at
least both above and below the Goulburn to beyond the Loddon, as
far as I visited it, was so. There is an error evidently in the
map of this part of the country, for Mount Hope instead of being
delineated near the Goulburn, is from twenty-five to thirty miles
distant; the Campaspie is also a distinct river, uniting its
waters with the Murray about five miles west of the junction of
the Goulburn; the Yarragne, or, as called by the natives,
'Warren', on the outward line, and the Loddon on the return line,
is one and the same river. The Loddon, therefore, on the outward
line is a misnomer, and were I privileged to name this river, it
should be the La Trobe."</blockquote>
<p>Only in the mountainous region of Gippsland was anything left,
till a comparatively recent date, for explorers to accomplish.
The last expedition of real discovery in the territory of
Victoria, was that of Dr. Mueller among the Australian
Alps&mdash;a printed report of which, in the form of a letter
from the explorer dated December 16th, 1854, is enclosed in a
despatch of Governor Sir Charles Hotham. Dr. Mueller ascended
Mount Wellington on November 14th, and estimated its height at
5000 feet&mdash;"a snow storm lasting, here, even at so advanced
a season, for a whole day." Crossing the Dividing Range between
the waters of Gippsland and the Murray, lie ascended, December
3rd, the two highest mountains of the Bogong Range. The explorer
says, "Considering that mountains of such altitude, probably the
two highest in the Australian Continent deserve distinctive
names, I solicit His Excellency's permission to name the grandest
of both Mount Hotham, and the second in height Mount La
Trobe,&mdash;as I trust to be entitled to the great honour of
being the first man who ever reached these commanding summits of
the Australian highland. . . . After extending my journeys over
several mountains in the neighbourhood, and an exploration of the
Upper Milta Milta, I went over a generally fertile country to
Omeo." Dr. Mueller remarks that he had passed over ranges never
before traversed by civilized men. Thus, may be said to end the
history of the exploration of Victoria.</p>
<p>In a short despatch of November 10th, 1841, Sir George Gipps
records his visit to Port Phillip. He says, "I am happy to be
able to report to your Lordship that I found the progress made by
the settlements of Melbourne and Geelong to be fully equal to my
expectations. I was struck with the beauty of the country at both
places, and with the quantity of land already brought into
cultivation on the River Yarra Yarra."</p>
<p>The Governor was only absent from Sydney thirteen
days&mdash;six of which he passed at Port Phillip. The one other
fact stated in this brief account of the visit, is that the
inhabitants were gratified to see His Excellency and showed
"every demonstration of attachment" to the Crown.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<h4>THE PORT PHILLIP ASSOCIATION AND ITS CLAIM.</h4>
<p class="negindent">Correspondence between Mr. Mercer and the
Colonial Office&mdash;Dr. Lushington's opinion as to the purchase
from the natives&mdash;Statements of progress of
Settlement&mdash;Claims of other Colonists besides those of the
Association&mdash;Decision of Executive Council at
Sydney&mdash;Approved by Colonial Office&mdash;Opinion of Mr.
Burge as to acquisition of lands from Aborigines&mdash;Mr.
Swanston's unfortunate attempt to land sheep&mdash;Growth of the
New Settlement&mdash;Final adjustment of the claims of the
Association.</p>
<p>T<small>HERE</small> exist also in the Record Office * a most
voluminous, and doubtless complete correspondence, and set of
documents concerning the claims of Batman's "Port Phillip
Association." Most of the letters to the Government on behalf of
that body were written by Mr. Mercer, who represented it in the
United Kingdom. It is only possible, and desirable, to give an
abstract of the most important particulars contained in these
documents, with extracts from them in which facts connected with
the progress of the new settlement are set forth.</p>
<p class="foot">[* All the documents in this chapter have been
derived from this source&mdash;a large proportion of them having
been printed in Parliamentary papers.]</p>
<p>In a letter from Edinburgh of January 26th, 1836, Mr. George
Mercer asks Lord Glenelg to recognize the treaty with the blacks,
and forwards copies of Batman's narrative, "the originals of two
treaties, executed in triplicate," with the natives, a map of the
land and other documents. He suggests that, should the Government
object to recognize and confirm the treaties with the natives, "a
Crown grant of this Territory be issued in the names of John
Batman and Charles Swanston, Esquires," on behalf of the
Association; and intimates that, the natives will never be able
to place reliance in white men, if the Association is "disturbed
in the enjoyment of the lands ceded by the Tribes under Treaties,
tabooed with the sacred symbols of their chiefs which cannot and
will not on their parts be broken."</p>
<p>A reply of February 15th, 1836, from the Under-Secretary
informs Mr. Mercer that the territory being within the Commission
of Sir Richard Bourke, Lord Glenelg considers "it is impossible
for H.M. Government to acknowledge any title to Lands acquired
there except upon the terms prescribed in that Commission and the
accompanying instructions."</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer, whose letters are marked by much ability, writes
again, March 16th, suggesting that Sir Richard's Commission,
&amp;c., probably refers "alone to a penal Colony," and that Port
Phillip "will not therefore under the slow and regular march of
population be located as a Penal Colony until some very distant
period." He proposes that Port Phillip should be dissevered from
New South Wales, remarking that "these lands unless formed into a
free Colony must I am humbly of opinion be dormant or be grazed
by squatters only for a century to come." It is also suggested in
the letter that the Association should be treated as the Van
Diemen's Land Company had been, and that the 750,000 acres should
be granted them at a quit-rent of &pound;1406 5<i>s</i>. for the
benefit of the Colony. He states the value of the stock of the
Association at Port Phillip to be from "20 to &pound;30,000."</p>
<p>In a reply of March 30th, Mr. Mercer is informed that Lord
Glenelg has sent instructions to the Governor of New South Wales
to appoint magistrates, &amp;c., at Port Phillip, and to put up
land "at such a reduced upset price as upon full consideration of
the state of the infant settlement, he may think reasonable," but
that the "disposing of Public lands at a quit-rent has been
generally abandoned on the most ample experience of the many and
insuperable difficulties with which it is attended."</p>
<p>On April 6th, Mr. Mercer again writes to Lord Glenelg, that he
had received communications from the members of the Association
up to the 30th October, informing him that considerable progress
had been made in forming the infant settlement. He submits on
behalf of the Association, that "it would be inequitable to admit
other parties to enter into competition with them at public
auction, for property, the whole value of which has been created
by their exertions and with their capital," and that they are
entitled "to the special favour of the Government." He asks that
they may be exempted from the rule, "prescribing sale by public
auction," and His Lordship having declined the quit-rent
proposal, that a purchase in fee simple should be allowed on
terms he proceeds to submit. These are that the Association
should be allowed to buy from the Crown not only the tract ceded
by the natives to Mr. Batman, but an additional one to the
eastward of it, and another of about equal extent to the
westward&mdash;the whole comprising "about 3000 square miles. For
this," says Mr. Mercer, "I should propose a price of Twenty
pounds (&pound;20) per square mile over head of surface. . . .
one half the amount to be paid by equal instalments in ten
years,"&mdash;to be expended upon emigration from Great Britain
or otherwise, as the Government may deem proper; the other moiety
on roads and public buildings, &amp;c., under the control of a
board of four members, two to be appointed by the Government, and
two by the Association; the superior government officer to have a
casting voice; the money to be expended in the course of ten
years, or extended by the Board over a greater period.</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer encloses the following opinion of Dr. Lushington,
as to the rights of the Association. The facts and documents
connected with the acquisition of the tract of land at Port
Phillip having been laid before Dr. Lushington, he had been asked
by the Association,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"1. Whether the grants obtained by the Association
are valid?<br>
<br>
"2. Whether the right of soil is or is not vested in the
Crown?<br>
<br>
"3. Whether the Crown can legally oust the Association from their
possessions?<br>
<br>
"4. What line of conduct or stipulations would you advise the
Association to pursue and make with the British Government; in
particular ought they to offer Government any specific terms, and
ought the whole of the documents now laid before you to be at
once communicated to Government, or ought such communications to
embrace only part of them; and if so what part?"</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Copy, Opinion of Dr.
Lushington.</p>
<blockquote>"1. I am of opinion that the grants obtained by the
Association are not valid without the consent of the Crown.<br>
<br>
"2 &amp; 3. I do not think that the right to this territory is at
present vested in the Crown, but I am of opinion that the Crown
might oust the Association, for I deem it competent to the Crown
to prevent such settlements being made by British subjects if it
should think fit.<br>
<br>
"4. I think the most advisable course the Association can pursue
is to give the Crown the fullest information on all points. I
think it unwise and unsafe to hold back any document or
information whatever. Indeed the so doing might invalidate the
security the Association might derive from the grants or acts of
the Crown.<br>
<br>
"I further think that it would not be expedient in the first
instance to propose specific terms. The best course would be
after giving free information to request the countenance,
sanction, and aid of the Crown. Of course afterwards the security
of the lands by confirmation or grant from the Crown should be
obtained, under what conditions or restrictions must be matter

"This present plan is truly speaking the planting of a new
colony, and nothing can be safely or effectually done but by the
authority of the Crown,</blockquote>

<p class="quote" align="right">"(Signed),          <small>STEPHEN
LUSHINGTON</small>.   </p>
<blockquote> "<i>Great George Street,<br>
   January</i> 18<i>th</i>, 1836."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter of April 14th, 1836, in reply to one from Mr.
Mercer of the 6th, Sir George Grey says, with respect to the
opinion of Dr. Lushington, that he&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"'Does not think that the right to the territory
adjacent to Port Phillip is at present vested in the Crown,' Lord
Glenelg is sensible of the great weight which is due to the
deliberate judgment of Dr. Lushington on a question of this
nature. As, however, the grounds on which Dr. Lushington denies
the title of the Crown to the territory in question are not
explained, and as Lord Glenelg is not aware of any fact or
principle which can be alleged in support of such conclusion,
which would not apply with equal force to all the waste lands in
every other part of the Colony of New South Wales, His Lordship
must decline to acquiesce in this doctrine, and cannot but
believe that it was advanced by Dr. Lushington under a
misapprehension of some of the most material parts of the
case.<br>
<br>
"Port Phillip and all the neighbouring territory, forming a
portion of the Colony of New South Wales, the land in that
vicinity cannot be disposed of, except according to the rules by
which General Bourke is required by the King's Commission and by
His Majesty's instructions, under the sign-manual to alienate
such property. Interests of very great and constantly increasing
importance are involved in the steadfast adherence to those
rules, and any departure from them at the present moment would
involve a breach of faith to the numerous persons who have
engaged their property in effecting settlements in other parts of
the Colony of New South Wales and in the new Colony of Southern
Australia.<br>
<br>
"The suggestion that the new colony should be formed in the
southern portion of New South Wales, of which the infant
settlement at Port Phillip should be the future capital, raises a
question of great importance and difficulty, on which it would be
impossible that His Majesty's Government should form a decision
without much previous inquiry. They would probably think it right
to postpone any such measure until after it should have been
maturely considered by the respective Governors of the existing
Australian Settlements. It is fit, however, that you should be
distinctly apprised that a very considerable time must elapse
before the establishment of such a new colony, even should it
ultimately be thought right so to abridge the limits of the
Colony of New South Wales.<br>
<br>
"The proposal which, on behalf of the gentlemen with whom you are
associated, you have made for effecting the purchase at Port
Phillip, of a territory of 3000 square miles, at a sum of
&pound;60,000, of which one half will be paid by annual
instalments, in the next ten years, and the remainder would be
invested in local improvements, has received Lord Glenelg's
careful attention. His Lordship directs me to state, that the
objections to the adoption of that proposal appear to him
insuperable.<br>
<br>
"He conceives that His Majesty's Government could not enter into
such an arrangement with a society of gentlemen possessing no
corporate character, however undoubted may be their claims to
respect and confidence as individuals. In the modern history of
Colonization no incorporated body has eyer received a grant, or
has been permitted to make a purchase at all approaching in
magnitude to that which it is the desire of yourself and your
associates to effect. To place a territory so extensive under any
other management than that of the responsible officers of the
Crown would, in Lord Glenelg's opinion, be to create an
unconstitutional power, which, if not subversive of the authority
of the local government, would unavoidably fetter its movements,
and impair its influence even when most essential to the public
welfare. Further, His Lordship has no grounds on which he could
be justified in entering into a contract of such magnitude. He
has not before him any evidence of the value of the land which it
is proposed to purchase, and thinks it indispensable not to act
on such a subject except with the advantage of the previous
advice of the Governor of the Colony.<br>
<br>
"For these reasons Lord Glenelg must adhere to the decision
announced to you in my letter of the 30th ultimo, of directing
General Bourke to put up the land at Port Phillip for sale, at
such a reduced upset price as, upon a full consideration of the
state of the infant settlement, he may think reasonable. His
Lordship, however, will instruct the Governor to have a careful
and just regard to the various circumstances stated in your
letter, and to make every arrangement which may appear to him to
be reasonable for protecting the fair claims of the persons who
have already resorted to Port Phillip, to a priority in the
purchase, on moderate and easy terms, of any lands which they may
have already occupied, or on which they may have actually
effected any improvement."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter of April 23rd, Mr. Mercer states that "it was
foreign to his wish to build upon Dr. Lushington's legal
opinion." As to his "Lordship's objections to the Association not
possessing a Corporate character," he suggests that these "may be
removed by extending that character to the associated body. . . .
and that with reference to the extent of the territory this may
at your Lordship's pleasure be limited." He goes on to propose
"that immediate instructions be given to locate a maximum grant
of four square miles or 2560 acres in Geelong and Dutigalla
(Anglice Port Phillip) to each member of the Association (17)
selected by himself or agent either free or at any very reduced
price your Lordship may determine upon&mdash;that permanent
buildings may be forthwith erected, and the plough brought to
bear upon lands held by a tenure more secure in your Lordship's
judgment than that under which they are now occupied. These
selections would I presume be dispersed over the ceded territory
with a view to form nuclei for enlarged farms and holdings by
purchase or otherwise when the government arrangement shall have
been completed." He asks that squatters should be prevented from
intruding on lands ceded to the Association, stating that "some
reckless people" have attempted to do so, and that, "as the
natives whose sacred symbols are attached to the treaties may
fancy themselves in honour bound forcibly to expel such, the
consequence may be unpleasant if not fatal."</p>
<p>The letter suggests that "if Port Phillip be constituted a
subordinate colony. . . . Western Port might be considered a
better location . . . . the proximity . . . . to Van Diemen's
Land might be taken to render Hobart Town a more eligible station
for control than Sydney." and that the members of the Association
being connected with Tasmania, "intercourse with the chief
authorities would be greatly facilitated by decreased
distance."</p>
<p>On May 10th Mr. Mercer is informed that Lord Glenelg can only
refer to Sir George Grey's "former letters", to carry out the
principles of which he has instructed Sir Richard Bourke, and
expresses the hope that the letters "will be found to embrace
every provision which is required by a due regard to the
interests and reasonable expectations of all parties by whom the
settlement at Port Phillip has been made."</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer on June 29th again writes from Edinburgh, repeating
the request, in his last letter, for "a copy or substance of the
instructions" sent to the Governor of New South Wales. He says
that his recent letters from the Association inform him that,
"confident of obtaining ultimate possession." they "are
proceeding with cultivation and other improvements," supplying a
larger number of natives than they anticipated with subsistence,
and also preparing "to furnish them with mental food."</p>
<p>Sir George Grey, in a letter of July 9th, declines to furnish
the copy of the instructions.</p>
<p>In a letter from C. Swanston, J.T. Gellibrand, and James
Simpson,&mdash;"a committee of the Geelong and Dutigalla
Association,"&mdash;to Governor Arthur, dated September 14th,
1836, it is stated, that "The territories of Dutigalla and
Geelong were granted by the natives in June,&mdash;the first
occupation with sheep was in November last, and the present
population consists of 157 males, and 35 females and children,
and the number of sheep grazing may be computed at 50,000; the
number of horses at 65; and of horned cattle 160. The estimated
value of the whole stock, together with other property, cannot
fall short of &pound;100,000, and during the past year the Colony
has given employment to eleven vessels."</p>
<p>Mention is made of the fact, that Mr. Stewart had been
informed of the murder by the blacks, "for the purpose of
obtaining flour," of two white men, "Mr. Franks and his
shepherd." The writers of the letter say, "We have never relied
upon any legal title to the land as <i>against</i> the Crown, but
we have solicited a confirmation of the grants by the Crown, upon
such terms as the King's Government may consider just and
equitable. And in order that we may not be misunderstood, we
entreat the British Government to recognize the Colony, to
appoint a government suitable to its infantine circumstances; and
we pledge to pay such quit-rent as shall be sufficient to
discharge all the expenses of such government." After speaking of
what the Association had done, and the hardship that other people
should be allowed to enter, upon equal terms, into the advantages
to be derived from its having opened up the country, the letter
states that, "the erection of a temporary place for the
celebration of Divine worship has been commenced, and we are
making arrangements with the Missionary Society in this Colony to
procure the settlement there of two of its members."</p>
<p>The letter concludes with a reference to an observation in one
of September 1st, 1836, in which Mr. Montagu, Colonial Secretary,
states that "schemes for making settlements. . . . in unlocated
districts of Australia have of late years been discouraged by
H.M.'s Government, as tending to fresh establishments involving
the Mother Country in an indefinite expense;" and Governor Arthur
is requested on his return to England, "to report his opinion
upon the question of the probability of the settlement formed at
Port Phillip ever 'involving the Mother Country in an indefinite
expense', or of its proving one of the most valuable Colonies
under the dominion of Great Britain."</p>
<p>The same gentlemen, in a letter to Sir B. Bourke of September
26th, 1836, disclaim the idea suggested in the letter of the
Under-Secretary to Mr. Mercer of April 14th, of desiring "the
possession of power or of any authority which might be subversive
of that to be exercised by the Crown," or "that it was in
contemplation to establish a proprietary government at Port
Phillip. . . . . The sole object of the Association has been the
occupation of territory upon the principle already defined, the
powers of Government being wholly exercised by the Crown."</p>
<p>In a copy of a long letter to Governor Bourke&mdash;enclosed
with the minutes of the Executive Council hereafter
cited&mdash;dated Hobart Town, September 26th, 1836, Messrs. C.
Swanston, J.T. Gellibrand, and James Simpson state that, "The
exports from the settlement to the Mother Country in the month of
January next will be to the amount of at least <i>nine thousand
pounds</i>."</p>
<p>In another letter to Sir Richard Bourke, of October 15th,
1836&mdash;also enclosed with the minutes of the Executive
Council&mdash;Mr. John Dobson transmits "a memorial from the
proprietors of stock at Port Phillip (unconnected with those
parties who style themselves the 'Port Phillip Company')." They
say that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Understanding that your Excellency intends to give
indulgences in the shape of grants of lands or otherwise to other
parties who have associated themselves in a company and have
purchased land from the Aboriginal Natives there," they "beg
leave to express a hope that your Excellency will extend the same
indulgences to us, as we have suffered all the privations and
gone to all the expenses necessarily attendant upon the formation
of a new and distant colony as much as the other parties have
done.<br>
<br>
"We also beg leave to state to your Excellency, that we had the
same opportunity as the Company for purchasing lands from the
natives, but we abstained from doing so, under the impression
that it would have been interfering with the just prerogative of
the Crown, and an infringement upon the rights and privileges of
your Excellency's Government.<br>
<br>
"While we confess that in all we have done at Port Phillip, we
have had in view the promotion of our own private interests, it
must be evident to your Excellency (from the account Mr. Stewart
has given you of that place) that by our exertions and those of
the Company, one of the finest countries in these Colonies has
been brought to the notice of the public, and will ere long, we
have no doubt, be one of the most valuable appendages to your
Excellency's Government.<br>
<br>
"Relying that your Excellency will see that there is no real
difference between our case and that of the Company, and hoping
that you will extend to us whatever indulgences you may be
pleased to grant to them, we have sent Mr. John Dobson, one of
our number, to your Excellency with power to act for us and to
give such explanation as may be required.</blockquote>

<p>Enclosed with the minutes of the Council is another letter,
from "the undersigned residents of Van Diemen's Land, having
embarked certain capital in stock to send to Port Phillip." They
say,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"We beg to lay before your Excellency our claims to
participate in any advantages in the disposal of land or
otherwise as your Excellency may be pleased to afford others, as
well as to show the causes which have prevented our having stock
there at this moment.<br>
<br>
"We had all of us made preparations by purchase of sheep and
otherwise to send stock to Port Phillip long previous to
receiving your Excellency's intimation that your Excellency would
favour those <i>only</i> who had up to that period actually
established themselves there.<br>
<br>
"That we shall be able to prove to your Excellency that the
purchase of sheep had actually been made long previously, that we
had so arranged our affairs, some by the sale of stock, one by
the sale of his business, to carry the speculation into effect,
and the principal causes which have prevented us doing so may be
found in the following:&mdash;<br>
<br>
1st. The time of the year (viz. the winter).<br>
2nd. The Lambing season.<br>
3rd. The scarcity of shipping calculated for the conveyance of
stock."<br>
<br>
In conclusion, they deem it unnecessary to depute any of their
body to present the memorial, being,&mdash;<br>
"Fully satisfied to trust" it "upon the broad basis of its own
merits and your Excellency's known justice and
impartiality.</blockquote>

<p>The following document was also taken into
consideration:&mdash;</p>
<p class="negindent">"Memoranda of Statement made before the
Executive Council of Charles Swanston, J.T. Gellibrand, and James
Simpson, Esquires, on behalf of the Port Phillip Association on
the 19th October, 1836.</p>
<blockquote>"The grounds of our claim we conceive to be our
treaty with the Native Tribes for the tracts of land obtained
from them upon conditions set forth in the grant dated the 6th
June, 1835. Our engagement to use our best endeavours to effect
their civilization&mdash;the large expenditure we have incurred
in forming the settlement, and the considerable quantity of stock
we have exported thither. We do not pretend to any legal title,
but to an equitable consideration of our claim to the whole or
any part of the tracts of land in question. This claim would seem
to have been recognised by Lord Glenelg, as will appear on
reference to sir George Grey's letter to Mr. Mercer dated 14th
April, 1836.</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<blockquote>"The Deputation proceeded to state that in round
numbers the quantity of stock belonging to the Association of
Port Phillip was around 20,700 sheep&mdash;a small proportion was
shipped after Mr. Stewart's arrival and the publication of the
Governor's Proclamation of 3rd May 1836. The number of sheep we
have stated includes the increase. About 19,000 sheep arrived at
Port Phillip previously to Mr. Stewart's publication of the
Governor's Proclamation before referred to. That includes the
whole number shipped by all persons as well as the Association.
No shipment of stock took place on account of the Association
until the latter end of October or the beginning of November,
1835. The possession of the land was taken in June, 1835. The
contract with Mr. Batman was entered into by Mr. Batman on the
6th of the same month. Mr. John Faulkner took down a few horses
to Port Phillip in the month of August or September, 1835.<br>
<br>
"Considerable purchases of stock were made by individuals
belonging to the Association for the purpose of being sent to
Port Phillip previously to the publication in Van Diemen's Land
of the Governor's Proclamation of the 26th of August, 1835,
immediately upon Mr. Batman's return from Port Phillip. We have
no hesitation in saying that three-fourths were actually
purchased prior to the publication of that Proclamation. Mr.
Batman sold his estate and Mr. Wedge relinquished his situation
in the Survey Department, previously. Mr. Wedge did this having
been refused leave by the Lieut.-Governor to proceed to Port
Phillip. To every 1000 sheep may be added about 600<i>l</i>. or
700<i>l</i>. of expenses. Estimating the number of sheep at
13,000 the expenses attendant on their transmission and
settlement may be taken at 6000<i>l</i>. or 7000<i>l</i>.<br>
<br>
"The whole expenses of the Association connected with the
management of the settlement, and the civilization of the natives
have amounted to about 2390<i>l</i>., which includes two years'
supplies. This expense will not be diminished as regards the
natives. We consider ourselves bound to continue it, whatever may
be the determination of the Government. We consider that we are
bound to expend about 800<i>l</i>. annually for the benefit of
the natives. We have made no distinction in respect of the
natives from whatever quarter they may have come. There are
about. 700 or 800 natives in the neighbourhood of Port Phillip.
There have never been more than 200 or 300 supplied with bread at
any one time. We would willingly receive any grant the Government
may give us on condition of expending the amount we have
mentioned for the benefit of the natives.<br>

to the individuals specified:&mdash;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Of these all but 500 were shipped to Port Phillip
prior to the publication of the Governor's Proclamation of 3rd

individuals which were previously purchased but not shipped.
Besides the sheep there were about 100 horses and 57 head of
cattle previously shipped to the settlement.<br>

<p class="negindent">"Memoranda of Statement made before the
Executive Council by John Dobson, Esq. on behalf of certain
parties settled at Port Phillip on 19th October, 1836.</p>
<blockquote>"In December, 1835, we chartered a ship to take stock
to Port Phillip. There was no stock sent to Port Phillip by the
parties whom I represent until after the receipt of the
Governor's Proclamation of the 26th August, 1835. I have every
reason to believe and in fact I know that no stock was sent there
by any one previously. We throw ourselves entirely on the
clemency of the Government. We merely prefer our claim as equal
to that of any other persons. The parties I represent consist of
about 44 individuals. They possess at Port Phillip about 14,000
sheep, 40 head of cattle, and at least 20 horses. We all sent
ploughs, wheat, &amp;c., and a year's supplies. We took every
means to conciliate the natives by feeding them and otherwise.
Mr. Dobson then withdrew."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter of October 20th, 1836, to Governor Bourke, Messrs.
Swanston, Gellibrand, and Simpson say with reference to the
occupation of the territory by the Association subsequent to the
Proclamation of August, 1835,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Had we withdrawn from the occupation of the
territory of Port Phillip, and abandoned our Treaty with the
Natives, the necessary consequence would have been, that at the
present moment, instead of a settlement having been formed
consisting of two hundred persons and stock of the value of one
hundred thousand pounds, and the first steps laid towards
civilization, that the plains of Port Phillip would have been
exclusively occupied by the native tribes and this extensive
field for British enterprise would have remained
unproductive."</blockquote>
<p>In this letter the opinions of Dr. Lushington, Mr. Burge,
K.C., Sir Wm. Follet, and Mr. Pemberton are enclosed.</p>
<p>The decision of the Executive Council appears from the
following documents. The Extract of Minute 25&mdash;dated October
21st, 1836, and transmitted in Governor Bourke's despatch of
November 12th, 1836, subsequently given&mdash;thus deals with the
main question raised by the Association:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The Secretary of State for the Colonies in
authorizing the sale of the vacant Crown Land in the
neighbourhood of Port Phillip, having directed the Government of
New South Wales to take into consideration 'the fair claims of
the persons who have already resorted to that place to a priority
in the purchase, on easy and moderate terms, of any lands which
they may have already occupied, or on which they may have
effected any improvements',** the Governor and Executive Council
have given their best attention to this subject. They have
carefully perused the documents transmitted to the Governor by
Lord Glenelg and have had the advantage of a personal
communication with a deputation from the Association preferring
these claims. To comply literally with the Secretary of State's
Instructions which are to put the land at Port Phillip up to
sale, and at the same time to allow any priority of purchase,
seemed to the Council impracticable. They endeavoured therefore
in the first place to ascertain in what the fair claims of these
persons consisted, and in what way their case was distinguishable
from that of numerous other unauthorized occupiers of Crown Lands
in New South Wales, who have been hitherto regarded as having no
title whatever to any advantage or priority in purchase of land.
The Council are of opinion, that it is only in so far as the
claim under investigation is distinguished by some peculiar
feature, which entitles it to favour, that it can be considered
as fair, and as such coming within the scope and meaning of the
instructions of the Secretary of State.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** "Extract from Sir George Grey's letter to Mr.
Mercer, April 14th, 1836."]</p>
<blockquote>"After mature deliberation, the Council are unable to
perceive such distinction, unless it be in the belief,
entertained by the Association, that their title to the land,
under the purchase from the natives, could be sustained by law,
or would be recognized by the Government, and that under this
impression they incurred considerable expense in providing for
the occupation of the land so obtained.<br>
<br>
"As discovery and transfer of capital may probably be advanced as
additional grounds of property, it may be proper to state why the
Council find it impossible to admit their validity. The former is
wholly unsubstantiated. The existence of the tract of country
resorted to by the Association was not unknown; and, even if it
be shown that they have been the first to bring to light its
peculiar advantages, this is no more than can be alleged by the
remote stockholders on every side of the Colonial boundary with
respect to the various portions of land which they severally
explored and occupy. The transfer of capital from Van Diemen's
Land to New South Wales can furnish no claim, inasmuch as no
advantage is allowed in the purchase of land to settlers arriving
with their capital from England, or any other part of the world.
Limiting, therefore, the claims in question, to the steps taken
and the expenses incurred by the Association under an erroneous
opinion that their purchase from the blacks could be sustained,
it is in the next place to be inquired, what claims of such a
nature subsisted at the date of the receipt in Van Diemen's Land
of the Proclamation of the Governor of New South Wales, dated the
26th August, 1835. From this date it is evidently impossible for
the Government to recognize the origin of any claim to preference
without encouraging by a positive bounty a disregard of its own
authority. The Secretary of State's approval of the Proclamation
referred to, clearly shows that it could not be His Lordship's
intention thus to invalidate it, and thereby destroy the effect
of any similar act of this Government upon similar occasions.<br>
<br>
"For the foregoing reasons the Council are of opinion, that the
expense incurred by the Association prior to the date referred to
can alone be regarded as supporting any claim whatever to
preference from the Government. Even with regard to this, the
Council do not consider any positive right to be established, but
that whatever advantage or compensation may be awarded will be
wholly gratuitous, and only justifiable under the express
authority received from His Majesty's Government. This concession
is of itself a considerable boon; and in addition to which the
administration of the law and the protection of a military force
have been provided for the settlers at Port Phillip; and measures
are in progress by which they may convert under the existing
regulations an unauthorized occupation into a legal
possession.<br>
<br>
"With respect to the engagement entered into with the natives, by
which certain articles are to be delivered to them by the
Association annually the Council are of opinion, that in
consideration of the land being now offered for sale, the
engagement should be upheld by, and at the expense of the local
Government, and that all actual expenditure of the Association on
this account should be allowed to them. The Council, therefore,
advise, that the Association be called upon to furnish to this
Government a detailed account of the expenses they incurred prior
to the receipt in Van Diemen's Land of the Government
Proclamation, of the 26th August, 1835, above referred to, in
providing for the occupation of the land they obtained from the
natives at Port Phillip. On the admission of this account, or
such part thereof as may be approved, the Council further
recommend, that the Association be allowed the amount, together
with the expenses incurred on behalf of the natives, as a
remission in the purchase of land at that place. They advise
also, that the land be set up at the usual price of five
shillings per acre, as it is represented to be not inferior in
any respect and in fertility much superior to the general average
of lands hitherto sold in New South Wales.<br>
<br>
"With respect to the other claimants whose memorials have been
laid before the Council, or whose agent has been heard in their
behalf, it does not appear that any other persons than the
members of the Association before referred to, can advance any
fair claim to remission upon the grounds above recognized.
Independently of which the direction of the Secretary of State
with regard to such claims must be considered as limited to the
Association whose agent he was addressing in the correspondence
laid before the Council, and by whom alone any pretensions had
been advanced for His Lordship's consideration.<br>
<br>
"If it should appear to the Association that the remission now
conceded to them in the purchase of land is a less considerable
advantage than would seem to have been contemplated by the
Secretary of State, when addressing Mr. Mercer on the 14th April
last, it is to be recollected that the extent of the fair claim
of the Association was left to the consideration of this
Government, and the Council have availed themselves, in such
consideration, of their local experience, their knowledge of the
situation of other unauthorized occupiers of Crown Lands and of
facts connected with the occupation of the Association which do
not appear to have been known to the Secretary of State.<br>
<br>
"The Council have also carefully considered the general effect
which a more extended concession in favour of the applicants
would have had upon the principles under which Crown Lands are
alienated by sale in this Colony, For want of these means of
information it appears from the whole tenor of the correspondence
of the Secretary of State, both with the Government and the agent
of the Association, that whilst his Lordship inculcates the
necessity of adhering to the regulations for the sale of Crown
Lands, he avoids expressing any definitive opinion upon the
claims brought under consideration, and the Council, in applying
their additional means of information to the case, conceive that
they have best fulfilled the intentions of His Majesty's
Government, and the trust imposed in them, in coming to such a
decision as that information appeared to them to
prescribe."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter to Mr. Alexander M'Leay, Colonial Secretary, dated
Sydney, October 29th, 1836, Messrs. Swanston, Gellibrand, and
Simpson acknowledge the Minute of the Executive Council of the
21st inst., which they remark only allows "an abatement in the
purchase-money for lands publicly sold, whereas it is clearly the
intention of the Secretary of State, that we are to be allowed
<i>priority of purchase at a moderate upset price</i>, and which
can only be construed to mean a privilege of selecting such lands
as we may reasonably require, and purchasing them at the upset
price, and which the Council by the minute has fixed at <i>five
shillings per acre</i>." They contend that the Governor's
Proclamation of August, 1835, should not be applied to the
Association on account of the obligations into which they had
previously entered with the natives, &amp;c., and that their
continued occupation was in no disrespect to it. As to the
portion of the Minute which requires an account of the expense
incurred on behalf of the natives prior to the
Proclamation&mdash;so that "a remission in the purchase of land"
may be allowed in respect of it&mdash;they say that, up to the
time specified, they are not able to furnish an accurate account;
but "beg to state, that the whole amount of the expenses incurred
on that head by the Association, from June, 1835, to September,
1836, amounts to &pound;2390, which has been paid from time to
time by sundry calls upon the shareholders, amounting to 17 in
number." The expense prior to the Proclamation&mdash;"in
providing for the occupation of the 'land purchased from the
natives'"&mdash;consisted of "the purchase and charter of
vessels, for the transmission of stock, which cost &pound;2600,
<i>Norval</i> and <i>Adelaide</i>.</p>
<p>"The sale by Mr. Batman of his estate in Van Diemen's Land,
and the breaking up of his establishment for the express purpose
of proceeding to Port Phillip and where he and his family now
reside, and the contracts entered into by him for the purchase of
stock, &pound;2300. Contracts and purchase of Captain Swanston
for the sole purpose of being sent to Port Phillip to the extent
of &pound;3500. The like by Mr. Gellibrand &pound;1100, Mr.
Sinclair &pound;500, Mr. Arthur &pound;600, Mr. Conolly
&pound;600." It is also stated that Mr. Wedge relinquished
&pound;400 a year as Assistant-Surveyor to go to Port
Phillip.</p>
<p>The concluding paragraph of Sir Geo. Grey's letter to Mr.
Mercer of April 14th, 1836, is quoted, and also the passage from
that of May 10th, which ends with the words "parties by whom the
<i>settlement of Port Phillip has been made</i>." These latter
words are in italics. The request is made that each member of the
Association shall be allowed to purchase 7000 acres at five
shillings an acre&mdash;"the extent of land which will be
requisite for the agistment of the present flocks and those which
have been purchased since the receipt of Sir George Grey's letter
of the 14th April, 1836; the terms of which have induced several
members of the Association to make further extensive purchases,
with the ultimate intention of permanent occupancy," or that they
may "occupy such above portions of land until the further
pleasure of the Secretary of State is ascertained."</p>
<p>Minute 26 of November 1st, 1836, advises with regard to the
compensation to the Association&mdash;</p>

<p>By a letter to the Colonial Secretary, dated Sydney, November
1st, 1836, the three gentlemen acknowledge the receipt of the
Minute of the Council "upon the letter of the 29th ult.," and ask
"that, as the Council has now defined the upset price, and also
the amount of compensation to which the members of the
Association are fairly entitled, that each member of the
Association may now be permitted to have priority of purchase to
the extent of 1647, one thousand six hundred and forty-seven
acres, which at the upset price will absorb the sum recommended
and which will enable each member to secure a <i>homestead</i>
for the protection and agistment of part of the flocks."</p>
<p>Minute 27, November 2nd, 1836, refuses the application "that
each member of the Association may be permitted to have priority
of purchase to the extent of 1647 acres each, which at the upset
price will absorb the sum recommended." The reason assigned is,
that "it is only in the way of remission that they can be granted
the amount of expenses which have been allowed to them, it being
indispensable that the land should be pat up to sale." Mr.
M'Leay, in a letter of November 10th, announces this decision,
which was in accordance with the principle laid down in the
Minute of the 21st ult.</p>
<p>The following copy of a despatch of Sir Richard Bourke to Lord
Glenelg, clearly explains the preceding decision of the Executive
Council respecting the claims of Batman's Association:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Government House,
Sydney</i>,   <br>
"12<i>th November</i>, 1836.        </p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;With reference to your
Lordship's despatch of the 13th April last No. 142 upon the
occupation of Port Phillip, and to my communication upon the same
subject of the 15th September last, in my despatch No. 101, I
have now the honour to inform your Lordship that I have conferred
with the deputies from the Association whose attendance I
requested, and have received several applications from other
bodies and individuals seeking land at Port Phillip. The claims
of the Association made known to your Lordship by Mr. Mercer and
those of other parties preferred to this Government have been
severally considered by the Executive Council, and I transmit
herewith the minutes of their proceedings and other papers upon
these subjects.<br>
<br>
"The Minute No. 25 contains so full an exposition of the grounds
upon which the Council came to the decision therein recorded, as
to leave little to be added in the way of explanation. I would
briefly remark that in refusing to allow to the Association the
acquisition of land at Port Phillip unless by the process of
public sale under the existing regulations, the Council were
influenced by a consideration of the actual state of a large
portion of the Colony in which land is occupied in the same
unauthorized manner as at Port Phillip. The occupiers might claim
a conveyance from the Crown with as much reason and upon the same
terms as the Association claim for their usurpation. In acceding
to all these demands, the system under which the disposal by
auction of vacant Crown Lands in New South Wales has hitherto
been so successfully conducted, would be at once broken up; and
some millions of acres I believe I may say without exaggeration,
would be required to satisfy the claims of those who have driven
their sheep and cattle into remote and fertile districts of which
they may boast to be the first discoverers.<br>
<br>
"In allowing to the Association without any rigid scrutiny of the
account of the money they expended whilst under the erroneous
impression that the land they proposed to occupy was not within
the limits of this Government, and that their bargain with the
blacks was valid, the Council have treated that body with great
consideration. I believe the Association feel this to be the
case, and would have been satisfied with the arrangement had the
Council consented to their last proposition, and given land
without a public sale, instead of allowing the value in a
remission of the purchase money at an auction held under the
terms of the existing regulations. The Council however could not
for the reasons already stated depart from the principle by which
its decision was governed; and your Lordship will probably
receive a renewed application from the Company. I would strongly
recommend that the decision of the Council be fully confirmed.
Any relaxation will establish a precedent of which the numerous
occupants beyond the limits will not fail to avail themselves
when the opportunity offers, as soon may be the case. Their claim
to a similar indulgence would then be irresistible. At present
they expect no preference when their land shall be put up to
sale. The claim of the Association on the score of improvements
is merely nominal. These have not exceeded the erection of a
temporary bark hut, and the cultivation of a little wheat for
their shepherds. It is probable that when the land is divided and
put up to sale in sections, each will get that portion upon which
his rude settlement has been formed.<br>
<br>
"Upon the whole I think the decision of the Executive Council has
not created any very bitter disappointment to the Company, and
has been generally satisfactory to the rest of the community. As
a precedent, if confirmed by your Lordship, it will materially
facilitate the adjustment of future claims when the land to the
westward of Twofold Bay is declared open to location. I have the
honour," &amp;c.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right">"(Signed)          <small>RICHD.
BOURKE</small>."   </p>
<p>In reply to the preceding despatch. Lord Glenelg writes, July
10th, 1837, signifying his "approval and confirmation of the
resolutions of the Council, and of the proceedings of the local
Government."</p>
<p>The Secretary of State says that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The reasons assigned . . for an inflexible adherence
to the principle of sales by auction according to the present
system are conclusive, and it is clearly shown that a departure
from that principle in the present case would involve a sacrifice
of the best interests of the Australian Colonies.*** Another
motive for adhering to this principle might have been drawn from
the contiguity of Port Phillip to South Australia. The granting
of land without purchase in that part of New South Wales would of
course have been wholly incompatible with the prosperity of the
adjacent Colony, as a competition would thus be created for
settlers and for the investment of capital, with which it would
have been impossible for South Australia where the upset price of
lands is fixed by Parliament at 12/- per acre, to
contend."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[*** The first time they appear to have been so
called in any of the despatches.]</p>
<p>Lord Glenelg states that he is "more strongly" confirmed, by
the opinions of Sir Wm. Follet and Messrs. Burge and Pemberton,
in his views as to the rights of the Crown and the invalidity of
the title from the natives.</p>
<p>His Lordship further says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I perceive that much stress is laid on the language
of the letters which by my direction Sir Geo. Grey addressed to
Mr. Mercer. It is argued, that those letters recognize a right on
the part of the settlers, first to a priority of purchase of the
lands which they had occupied or improved; and secondly, to a
protection of all their claims and reasonable expectations. The
Council observing that priority of purchase and a sale by auction
being wholly incompatible and contradictory, understand Sir
George Grey's letters as leaving it open to them to refuse the
required priority. This construction was completely in accordance
with Sir George Grey's language, as it is with the reason of the
case. Mr. Mercer was not informed that any priority of purchase
would be accorded to the Association, or that any of their claims
or expectations would be admitted excepting such as might be
found fair and reasonable. On the contrary he was distinctly
informed, that the local Government of New South Wales would be
directed to put up the land at Port Phillip for sale at an upset
price. It appeared to me however, that under the circumstances of
the case there might possibly be some particular spots, for
example the sites of buildings, gardens or other enclosures,
which it might be reasonable to except from this general rule.
But cautious of making even that concession without the advantage
of the previous inquiries and advice of the local Government, I
expressly declared that such arrangements only could be made for
this purpose 'as might appear to the Governor to be reasonable.'
Thus the general principle of sales by auction was distinctly
affirmed, and the propriety of admitting the proposed exception
from it was referred to the discretion of the local Government.
That discretion having been maturely exercised, on a full
consideration of all the facts of the case, and of all the
principles bearing on them, I cannot admit that there is any
inconsistency between the assurances conveyed to Mr. Mercer and
the ultimate decision which in deference to the opinion of the
local Government I now sanction and adopt. I am,
&amp;c."</blockquote>
<p>The very learned opinion of Mr. Burge&mdash;referred to in the
above despatch, and elsewhere in the discussion of the claim of
the Association&mdash;has an interest beyond that question, as it
ably treats of the law relating to the acquisition of territory
from aboriginal inhabitants. The historical facts cited in the
opinion relieve it from the dryness of an ordinary legal
document. It is therefore given unabridged, and is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"1 and 2. I am of opinion, that, as against the
Crown, the grants obtained by the Association are not valid, and
that, as between Great Britain and her own subjects, as well as
the subjects of foreign states, the right to the soil is vested
in the Crown. It has been a principle adopted by Great Britain as
well as by the other European States, in relation to their
settlements on the Continent of America, that the title which
discovery conferred on the Government, by whose authority or by
whose subjects the discovery was made, was that of the ultimate
dominion in and sovereignty over the soil, even whilst it
continued in the possession of the Aborigines.&mdash;Vattel, B.
2. 18. This principle was reconciled with humanity and justice
towards the Aborigines, because the dominion was qualified by
allowing them to retain, not only the rights of occupancy, but
also a restricted power of alienating those parts of the
territory which they occupied. It was essential that the power of
alienating should be restricted. To have allowed them to sell
their lands to the subjects of a foreign State would have been
inconsistent with the right of the State, by the title of
discovery to exclude all other States from the discovered
country. To have allowed them to sell to her own subjects would
have been inconsistent with their relation <i>of
subjects</i>.<br>
<br>
"The restriction imposed on their power of alienation consisted
in the right of pre-emption of these lands by that state, and in
not permitting its own subjects or foreigners to acquire a title
by purchase from them without its consent. Therein consists the
sovereignty of a dominion or right to the soil asserted, and
exercised by the European Government against the Aborigines, even
whilst it continued in their possession. The Commission granted
by England to Cabot, the charter to Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1578,
and which was afterwards renewed to Sir Walter Raleigh, the
charter to Sir Thomas Gates and others in 1606, and to the Duke
of Lennox and others in 1620, the grants to Lord Clarendon in
1663, and to the Duke of York in 1664, recognize the right to
take possession on the part of the Crown, and to hold in absolute
property, notwithstanding the occupancy of the natives.<br>
<br>
"The cession of 'all Nova Scotia or Acadia, with its ancient
boundaries', made by France to Great Britain by the 12th Article
of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1703, and the cession of other lands
in America, made at the peace of 1763, comprised a great extent
of territory which was in the actual occupation of the Indians.
Great Britain on the latter occasion surrendered to France all
her pretensions to the country west of the Mississippi, although
she was not in possession of a foot of land in the district thus
ceded. But that which Great Britain really surrendered was her
sovereignty, or the exclusive right of acquiring and of
controlling the acquisition by others of lands in the occupation
of the Indians.<br>
<br>
"On the cession by Spain to France of Florida, and by France to
Spain of Louisiana, and on the retrocession of Louisiana by Spain
to France, and the subsequent purchase of it by the United States
from France, these powers were transferring and receiving
territories, the principal parts of which were occupied by the
Indians.<br>
<br>
"The history of American colonization furnishes instances of
purchases of land from the native Indians by individuals. The
most memorable is the purchase made by William Penn. It has,
however, been observed by Chief-Justice Marshall, in the case of
Johnson <i>v</i>. Mcintosh, 8 Wheaton's Rep. 570, that this
purchase was not deemed to have added to the strength of his
title. Previously to this purchase the lands called Pennsylvania,
and which comprised those subsequently purchased by him, had been
granted by the Crown to him and his heirs in absolute property,
by a charter in 1681, and he held a title derived from James II.
when Duke of York. He was, in fact, as a proprietary governor,
invested with all the rights of the Crown," except those which
were specially reserved. Another instance is the purchase from
the Narraghansetts Indians of the lands which formed the Colonies
of Rhode Island and Providence. They were made by persons whose
religious dissensions had driven them from Massachusetts. The
state of England at this period might account for this
transaction having escaped the attention of the Government. It is
evident, however, that the settlers were not satisfied with the
title acquired by this purchase, for on the restoration of
Charles II. they solicited and obtained from the Crown a charter,
by which Providence was incorporated with Rhode Island. The grant
is made to them 'of our Island called Rhode Island', and of the
soil as well as the powers of Government. The judgment of Lord
Hardwicke in the case of Penn <i>v</i>. Lord Poltimore, 1 Ves.
454, is, not inconsistent with, but in many respects supports,
this view of the rights of the Crown and its grantees.<br>
<br>
"In all the Colonies which now constitute the United States, the
Crown either granted to individuals the right in the soil,
although occupied by the Indians, as was the case in most of the
proprietary Governments, or the right was retained by the Crown,
or vested in the Colonial Government. The United States at the
termination of the Revolution acquired the right to the soil
which had been previously vested in the Crown, for Great Britain
by treaty relinquished all claim 'to the proprietary and
territorial rights of the United States.' The validity of titles
acquired by purchases from the Indians has been on several
occasions the subject of decision in the Courts of the United
States. The judgment of Chief-Justice Marshall in the case of
Johnson <i>v</i>. Mcintosh, contains the elaborate opinion of the
Supreme Court, that the Indian title was subordinate to the
absolute ultimate title of the Government, and that the purchase
made otherwise than with the authority of the Government, was not
valid. A similar decision was given by the same Court in the case
of Worcester <i>v</i>. the State of Georgia, in January, 1832. 3
Kent's Com. 382, and the case referred to in note, p. 385.<br>
<br>
"3. I am of opinion that the Crown can legally oust the
Association from their possession.<br>
<br>
"The enterprise manifested by the expedition,&mdash;the
respectability of the parties engaged in it,&mdash;and the
equitable and judicious manner in which they conducted the
intercourse with the native tribes, and made their purchase,
afford a strong ground for anticipating that the Crown would, in
conformity with its practice on other occasions, on a proper
application, give its sanction to, and confirm the purchase which
the Association has made. Lord Hardwicke, in the case which has
been referred to, expressed a very strong opinion, that the
possession of persons making these settlements ought to receive
the fullest protection.<br>
<br>
"There is no ground for considering that the lands comprised in
this purchase are affected by the act erecting South Australia
into a Province, 4 &amp; 5 W. IV., c. 95. They are clearly not
within the boundaries assigned to the territory which is the
subject of the act, and therefore the Crown is not precluded from
confirming the purchase.<br>
<br>
"4. I am of opinion that the Association should make an
application to the Government for a confirmation of the above
purchase, and accompany it with a full communication, not only of
all the documents now laid before me, but of every other
circumstance connected with the acquisition.</blockquote>

<p>In a subsequent opinion dated December 11th, which Mr. Burge
was asked to give, as to what the Association should do, the
learned gentleman says&mdash;"I confess it appears to me that
neither the present nor any preceding Government has applied
itself to the colonization and settlement of those immense
territories to which Great Britain claims a right of sovereignty
with the attention, and upon the principles, which this great and
interesting subject demands. The principle upon which, in the
earlier history of this country, colonization proceeded, and was
encouraged by the Government, is abandoned, and no new principle
substituted in which a just consideration is had for the
enterprising exertions of individuals in making those settlements
which the Government itself will not make."</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer does not again address the Colonial Minister till
December 14th, 1836, when he writes from Edinburgh enclosing a
certificate from the "legally-appointed Inspector of Stock at
George Town, Van Diemen's Land," stating that between November
1st, 1835, and May 7th, 1836, the date of the certificate, there
had "been exported from George Town for Port Phillip on the Coast
of New Holland" 19,246 ewes, 86 horses, and 41 head of homed
cattle. Mr. Mercer says that subsequently, in the course of the
month of May, 1100 more ewes were sent to Port Phillip, making
above 20,000 sheep in seven months, and that the Association had
expended about &pound;50,000. He also forwards "a print of the
'Hobart Town Gazette' of 1st of April, 1836, containing
Government Notice No. 75 of the 31st March following upon a
letter from Port Phillip, 15th March, addressed by Mr. Wedge a
member of the associated body to Mr. Colonial Secretary. Montagu,
respecting the firing at and wounding of some blacks at Western
Port by some men employed collecting mimosa bark." The Gazette
also contains Sir Richard Bourke's Proclamation of August 26th,
1835, respecting the treaty with the natives. Mr. Mercer
remarks:&mdash;"I may be permitted to observe that your
Lordship's instructions to His Excellency General Bourke up to
that period scarcely appear to me to convey such specific orders
to grant special immunities to the discoverers and founders of
that Colony as from the ultimate paragraph of Sir George Grey's
letter of 14th in reply to my address of 6th April, I had
flattered myself with the hope of finding;" and he trusts that
subsequent instructions may have been more favourable. He also
states that the late accounts inform him, that in consequence of
the occupation by other settlers of the adjoining tracts,
proposed for purchase in his letter of April 6th, "the
Association had relinquished the intention of extending its
territories by further treaties with the Native Chiefs;" and that
the other Colonists respect "the boundaries marked out by the
Treaties." He offers &pound;30 a square mile "for the ceded tract
in extent more or less one thousand square miles"&mdash;the money
to be expended at the discretion of the Government for the
benefit of such tract. He suggests as possible, but hopes
improbable, that were part of it offered for sale, the natives
might, "not unsupported by imprescriptable right and natural
justice, principles to which they are fully alive, governed by
their already pledged faith under treaties bearing their sacred
symbols, object to what they might consider an arbitrary disposal
of their property, and might possibly deem themselves justified
or even bound in honour to dispossess and eject, <i>vi et
armis</i>, any settler or occupant not being one of the
Association." He further suggests that the claim might be made
the subject of legislation or inquiry by a Committee of the House
of Commons. The letter also says that other persons besides those
of the Association, have commenced to erect stores and to form
stations at Port Phillip, and that "orders for goods have been
received in Edinburgh to furnish these stores for the supply of
the yet scanty but daily increasing population; and," he
observes, "I may safely add that in a very few years duly
fostered by the British Government and under the philanthropic
conciliatory and civilizing system adopted by the body now
located there this settlement will prove to be the most
flourishing free Colony in the Hemisphere." He states that he is
preparing to send a few "emigrants specially for Port Phillip by
the first good and sufficient vessel that may sail from
Leith."</p>
<p>In a reply of December 30th, Sir George Grey says "that after
the instructions which his Lordship has already addressed to the
Governor of New South Wales, he could not without producing
extreme and irreparable confusion, take out of the hands of that
officer the duty of superintending the formation of the
settlements which are in progress at Port Phillip; nor could His
Lordship without neglecting the just claims of the settlers in
South Australia accede to the proposals which you have made."</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer replies, at some length, from Edinburgh, January
27th, 1837, asking that the question may be reconsidered by the
Government, or that it would sanction a motion for a Committee in
the House of Commons to take into consideration "the state of
this important and rapidly improving Colony."</p>
<p>In a reply from the Colonial Office, as long after as July
31st&mdash;Mr. Mercer having withheld the letter, not sending it
till forwarding the following of June 23rd&mdash;he is informed
"that the arrangements for selling lands in the vicinity of Port
Phillip have been maturely considered by the Governor and Council
of New South Wales. . . . and that the lands there are now
actually in the course of sale by public auction at a fixed upset
price." "The Association are also informed, that they "may obtain
at such auction any quantity of land which they may wish to
purchase, but Lord Glenelg does not feel himself justified in
entering on behalf of Her Majesty's Government into any
arrangements with members of the Association for the acquisition
of lands on any other principle."</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer, in writing on June 23rd, 1837, among other things,
says, "Colonel Torrens in his evidence given on the 29th June,
1836, before the Select Committee of the House of Commons, is
pleased to designate the Association 'Squatters'&mdash;this term
as applied to them by this witness and others, I beg distinctly
to repudiate; because according to the <i>lex loci</i>, such as
it may be, they are legitimate occupants of the lands in
question."</p>
<p>The Under-Secretary replies on July 31st, that "Lord Glenelg
has found no reason to doubt either the lawfulness, the justice,
or the prudence of the measures taken by Sir R. Bourke on the
advice of the Executive Council of his Government in regard to
the settlement at Port Phillip. His Lordship has, therefore,
signified to that officer his approbation of those measures."</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer, in an answer of August 18th, comments upon the
reason assigned by the Executive Council at Sydney, of the
impracticability of a literal compliance with Lord Glenelg's
instructions&mdash;"to give those by whom the settlement at Port
Phillip had been made, priority of purchase of the lands occupied
or improved by them at a price under 5<i>s</i>." On the faith of
this Mr. Mercer states that he had invested &pound;15,000 "in
stocking the territory at Port Phillip."</p>
<p>On November 18th, 1837, Mr. Mercer again addresses the
Secretary of State, commending to him the petition of Mr.
Swanston, next referred to, and says,&mdash;"Lest your Lordship
should not have received despatches of June from Sydney, I have
the honour to state that five squares, comprising one hundred
allotments in the town of Melbourne (the plan consisting of
Twenty-four Squares) had been sold on the 1st June, 1837, at an
average of thirty eight pounds Stirling per lot, each containing
seventy-six perches. The site of this city was selected by Sir
Richard Bourke, in the tract originally set apart for public
purposes, by the Association, as shown by the map with your
Lordship, about six or seven miles from the mouth of the Yarra
Yarra River."</p>
<p>The statement of Mr. Swanston, dated Hobart Town, January
16th, 1837, from which the following extract is taken, was
addressed to the Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, and
transmitted to Lord Glenelg. The writer alleges that, being, as
one of the members of Association, pledged to take steps to
occupy the country, he had made arrangements with that view prior
to the Governor's Proclamation of August 26th, 1835. He
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"In the month of November, 1835, a shipment of part
of the sheep which had been purchased in pursuance of the pledge
given, was made by the undersigned from 'George Town', per
<i>Norval</i>, and were landed at the Indented Head, at the
entrance of Port Phillip; but in consequence of the then insecure
state of that part of the settlement, and the alarm entertained
by the shepherds in proceeding through 'Geelong' to the River
Exe, where the station was then fixed, 500 young ewes were lost;
and notwithstanding every search was immediately made, and which
was continued for some months, the missing sheep have never been
recovered.<br>
<br>
"The undersigned is induced to believe from subsequent
representations made by some of the natives that the sheep were
driven away by a party of natives towards the Lake Moodewarie,
and there destroyed.<br>
<br>
"In the month of December, 1835, the undersigned shipped on board
the <i>Norval</i> the remainder of his stock, consisting of 1048
ewes, and 84 pure Saxon rams. The vessel most unfortunately
encountered a severe gale of wind when distant from the entrance
of Port Phillip about thirty miles. The gale lasted three days,
during which time the vessel lay to, and for the ultimate
preservation of the stock, the captain went to 'Western Port',
intending to land the stock on the main opposite Porpoise Head,
but finding that that part of the country would not afford any
water or sustenance, he then proceeded to Red Point, and landed
the entire cargo near the place where the settlement had formerly
been established by the Government of New South Wales, and had
been abandoned in 1826. During the operation of landing the cargo
at Western Port, the weather continued boisterous, and the boats
being unfitted for the purpose, one was upset, when the
undersigned had to deplore the loss of two men, and of Mr.
Moodie, his overseer, who was in charge of the stock and
cargo.<br>
<br>
"The natives of Western Port are very numerous, and had been a
few weeks before wounded and injured by a party of Barkers who
were stationed a few miles off. These men represented to the
shepherds the danger of their employment on shore, and the
certainty of their being speared by the natives; and such was the
intimidation produced that the property of the undersigned was
wholly exposed&mdash;the sheep strayed through an unknown country
covered with grass three feet high, so as effectually to conceal
them; and although the undersigned procured a vessel to be
despatched with other men, accompanied by several natives of New
South. Wales to Western Port within a fortnight after the
landing, yet they were only able to collect out of the whole
flock 78 sheep, and which were taken to Port
Phillip.</blockquote>

<blockquote>but the present value of that stock with their
increase would be at the most moderate computation
&pound;5600."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Swanston asks for "some compensation in allowance in the
purchase of lands at the Colony which he has so materially
assisted in establishing."</p>
<p>The Colonial Secretary, Mr. Deas Thomson, in a letter of
February 4th, 1837, declines to accede to Mr. Swanston's request;
and on its being referred to Sir R. Bourke, after his return to
England, he writes on July 24th, 1838, that he cannot come to any
decision different from that above communicated to Mr. Swanston.
This reply was sent to Mr. Mercer in a letter of July 31st,
1838.</p>
<p>In writing from Edinburgh on May 24th, 1838, Mr. Mercer
further urges upon Lord Glenelg the claims of his Association,
alleging that the Sydney Government had wholly failed "in
effectuating his Lordship's intention." Mr. Mercer encloses a
printed pamphlet dated May, 1838, containing a statement of the
"Case of the Association," one or two extracts from which may
more clearly show the progress of colonization.</p>
<blockquote>"The first occupation of the country by the
Association was in November, 1835, and so rapidly did the
settlement increase, that in September 1836, a period of little
more than ten months, the population consisted of 157 males, 35
females and children, 50,000 sheep, 65 horses, and 160 homed
cattle. The value of the whole stock was not less than
&pound;100,000, and in the course of the year eleven vessels had
been employed for the transport of commodities to and from the
settlement.</blockquote>
<p>It goes on,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"That in June, 1837, the foundations of a town to be
called Melbourne, were laid on the banks of the Yarroo, upon a
part of the tract acquired by the Association from the natives
and which they willingly gave up to the Government to the extent
of 30,000 acres, for the purpose of being sold in small lots for
the benefit of the lesser emigrants; and that 100 allotments of
town land, the town comprising 480, were put up to sale, and were
purchased at high rates, amounting in the whole to
&pound;3800,&mdash;the allotments being seventy-six perches (not
half an acre) each; the sale averaging &pound;80 per acre, while
the town lots, lately sold at Adelaide, the new capital of South
Australia, only brought &pound;6 7<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per acre,
the difference being caused by the small number of lots exposed
to sale in the one case, and the greater extent exposed in the
other."</blockquote>
<p>It is further stated that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The European settlers occupy an extent of about 100
miles of country, but the furthest station from the township is
not more than fifty miles distant. The whole country is under
sheep, except about sixty acres in cultivation, producing wheat
of excellent quality, and other grain for the use of the
inhabitants." "The number" of natives "frequenting the country
occupied by Europeans may be about 800."</blockquote>
<p>In a reply of June 18th Mr. Mercer is informed that the claims
of the Association "appear to his Lordship to have met with a
full and fair consideration from the local Government of New
South Wales. The reasons assigned by Sir R. Bourke and in the
report of the Council for an adherence to the principle of sale
by auction in this case appeared to Lord Glenelg to be
conclusive, and his Lordship feels that the utmost indulgence
which could necessarily be claimed by the Association has been
conceded to it by the allowance of the sum of &pound;7000."</p>
<p>In a letter of July 30th, 1938, Mr. Swanston informs Sir Geo.
Gipps that the Association, in order to show "the practicability
of carrying through the instructions "is "prepared to select land
to the extent of seven thousand pounds in one or more blocks. . .
. at five shillings an acre, that being the upset price fixed
upon land at Port Phillip."</p>
<p>The correspondence between Mr. C. Swanston and the Colonial
and Imperial Governments, is of some length. In his letter to
Lord Glenelg of October, 1838, from Hobart Town, Mr. Swanston
urges the claim of the Association, and states that, whilst
relying upon their interpretation of Sir Geo. Grey's letter of
April 14th, 1836, being carried out,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Some of their lands have been sold by the Crown to
others at an enormous price which they never would have attained
but for the improvements effected by the Association, that they
have been deprived of their homesteads, and their stations, and
that they have actually sustained the precise inconvenience (I
would venture to substitute the word injury) which Mr. Stephen
has stated it was the object of your Lordship's instructions to
prevent.<br>
<br>
"The sale of lands to which I allude took place on the 12th
ultimo, and in the full expectation that some sufficient
instructions must have been received by his Excellency Sir George
Gipps, to carry out your Lordship's promises to the Association,
I addressed a letter to His Excellency, recapitulating the
circumstances, connected with the claims of the Association. . .
. . and at the same time an agent was sent from Van Diemen's Land
by the Association at a very considerable expense to confer with
Sir George Gipps. His Excellency, however, declined affording
them the protection they required, as he had not received any
communication from your Lordship upon the subject, and considered
that he was therefore bound to abide by the instruction in your
Lordship's despatch No 341 dated 10th July, 1837, upon the
subject addressed to his predecessor.</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<blockquote>"The agent accomplished all that under such
circumstances he was enabled to do by leaving a protest with the
Governor against the sale of the lands which the Company had
occupied and upon which they had effected improvements. And your
Lordship will perceive that he was deterred from adopting the
course usually resorted to, viz. making open protest at the sale,
by the intimation made to him in the Colonial Secretary's letter
of the 8th September, 1838, 'that any interference on his part to
affect the biddings at the sale, would be held to annul the
agreement under which seven thousand pounds have been allowed to
the Association.'<br>
<br>
"But the Association had not the opportunity to purchase even if
so disposed, inasmuch as, as has been shown in Mr.
Under-Secretary Stephen's correspondence, the remission of seven
thousand pounds in the price of lands so purchased would have
been to the Association in fact no remission at
all."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Swanston says further, "that Port Phillip is now a
flourishing settlement already yielding a considerable revenue to
the Crown, and bidding fair at no distant day to rival if not
surpass its most advanced neighbours, and that in bringing about
these results the Association have been mainly instrumental."</p>
<p>In a despatch of April 8th, 1839, the Marquis of Normanby, who
had succeeded Lord Glenelg, informs Sir Geo. Gipps that he
approved of his "having referred the Association to Lord
Glenelg's despatch of 10th July, 1837, as the rule by which your
proceedings in the case would be guided;" and that there is no
ground for Mr. Swanston alleging that the absence of instructions
from the Secretary of State to the Governor had placed the
Association in an unfavourable situation.</p>
<p>In a despatch from Sir G. Gipps of November 24th, 1841, we
have the last official record of the claim of the Port Phillip
Association. The Governor says,&mdash;"Referring to the long
correspondence which has taken place on the subject of the
compensation granted, to the extent of &pound;7000, to the
persons who formed the 'Port Phillip Association', and
particularly to Lord Normanby's despatch of the 8th April, 1839,
I have the honour to report to your Lordship, that this business
has been brought to a final settlement on the principle laid down
in Lord Glenelg's despatch of the 10th July, 1837, and that the
lands (being 10,416 acres) purchased by the members of the
Association, at Port Phillip, to the amount of &pound;7000, have
been granted in trust to Mr. S.A. Donaldson, a merchant of
Sydney&mdash;he having been duly authorized to receive the same,
as Trustee, by the parties interested."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<h4>OTHER CLAIMS AND APPLICATIONS FOR LAND.</h4>
<p class="negindent">Claims of colonists not belonging to the
Association&mdash;Mackillop's memorial&mdash;Application for land
at Western Port&mdash;Project for working coal there and running
steamer between Port Phillip, Tasmania and
Adelaide&mdash;Batman's application for grant of
land&mdash;Correspondence respecting it&mdash;Batman's death.</p>
<p>S<small>OME</small> further claims made upon the Government by
early settlers in Victoria, and projects suggested for developing
the newly occupied territory cannot well be omitted from notice.
It is clear that the Government had good reason to be cautious in
not departing from its rules with respect to the disposal of
lands, though in some few very exceptional instances, it might
with perfect safety have, to a limited extent, relaxed their
stringent application in favour of the very first founders of
valuable new settlements.</p>
<p>We have already referred to Mr. Mackillop's letter to Lord
Glenelg of December 6th, 1836, enclosing two memorials adopted at
public meetings at Hobart Town on October 6th and November 22nd.
The first of these has already been given, and the second, which
ably urges the claim of other early settlers to the consideration
shown for the members of the Port Phillip Association, is as
follows:*&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the Record Office.]</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"To His Excellency Genl. Sir
Richard Bourke, Governor-in-Chief<br>
of New South Wales, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.<br></p>
<blockquote>"<small>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR
EXCELLENCY</small>,&mdash;We have had the honour to receive by
Mr. Dobson, Mr. Secy. McLeay's letter of the 24th ult. and a copy
of the Minute of the Executive Council of New South Wales of the
21st ult. which accompanied it; and crave permission respectfully
to make the following observations in reference thereto.<br>
<br>
"In the Minute of the Council it is stated&mdash;'It does not
appear that any other persons than the members of the Association
before referred to can advance any fair claims to remission upon
the ground above recognized.'<br>
<br>
"In opposition to this, we would refer to the clear and explicit
explanation of the Right Hon. the Sec. of State for the Colonies,
quoted in the Minute of the Council. It states the Sydney
Government are to take into consideration the fair claims of the
persons who have already resorted to that place (Port Phillip) to
a priority in the purchase, on easy and moderate terms, of any
lands they may have already occupied, or on which they may have
actually effected improvements.' **</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[** Letter of Sir. Geo. Grey to Mr. Mercer of
April 14th, 1836.]</p>
<blockquote>"We beg respectfully to observe, that it is
impossible for us to suppose, that in writing as above, the
Secretary of State meant to refer more particularly to the
members of the Association than to the other settlers at Port
Phillip.<br>
<br>
"The Executive Council are pleased to state, in substance, that
they can see no difference between the case of settlers at Port
Phillip, and that of other persons holding unauthorized
possession of Crown Lands in the other parts of the New South
Wales territory. There is, however, in our humble opinion, a wide
difference, and which we doubt not Lord Glenelg had in view at
the time he wrote the despatch above quoted. This difference we
beg respectfully to bring to the notice of your Excellency.<br>
<br>
"Settlers occupying Crown Lands in the other parts of New South
Wales are protected in their persons and properties by your
Excellency's Government; for though there be no magistrates
residing in the territories which have not yet been advertised
for sale, the nearest magistrate we understand always affords
assistance to those settlers, when he is required to do so. At
Port Phillip the case was widely different before the arrival
there of Captain Lonsdale. We were subjected to constant
annoyances and losses by the unruly conduct of our servants. We
do not however trouble you with a recapitulation of the
particulars of these matters, as the many entreaties transmitted
to your Government praying you to send a magistrate to Port
Phillip must have convinced your Excellency that these evils were
grievously felt by all the settlers.<br>
<br>
"It must be known to your Excellency too that though Convicts are
only assigned at Sydney to persons actually possessed of land in
New South Wales, assigned servants are not restrained from
proceeding out of the territories which have yet been advertised
for sale. Hence we have been informed, that almost three-fourths
of the whole of the inhabitants of the extensive district of
country called Monera are convicts. This is a great advantage
allowed to occupiers of Government land in other parts of the New
South Wales territory, but which could not have been granted to
us at Port Phillip, because even though we had qualified
ourselves to hold assigned servants, they would not certainly
have been allowed to go to a distant place like Port Phillip,
where there was no civil power to control them.<br>
<br>
"In New South Wales the settlers have always the means of
communicating with the natives of any new country into which they
may penetrate, through the blacks they may take with them from
the settled country. At Port Phillip we had to treat with blacks
who had never before seen an European, except Mr. Buckley, and in
this way were subjected to much anxiety and no little danger.<br>
<br>
"We beg further to remark that in point of fact. Port Phillip is
an entirely new and distinct Colony, and is in no wise connected
with the other parts of New South Wales, except by being placed
under your Excellency's control. In illustration of this remark,
we would observe, that up to the time Captain Lonsdale came
there, though 70 or 80 vessels had arrived from Van Diemen's
Land, not one had come to it from any port in New South Wales,
with either stock or merchandize. In a new Colony like Port
Phillip too it must be known to your Excellency that the
immigrant meets with many difficulties, which he would not have
to encounter on his arrival in the other parts of New South
Wales. In the latter he readily finds a temporary residence for
his family and all sorts of provisions and stock procurable on
the spot. At the former he has to import, not only his flocks,
but his servants, provisions, house, &amp;c., in fact
everything.<br>
<br>
"Our case as compared with that of the Association, we believe
stands thus. It was known or ought to have been known, to all the
parties who invested capital at Port Phillip, that that place had
long ago been declared by the English Government to be part of
the New South Wales Territory. Notwithstanding this state of
things, the Association purchased large tracts of the country
from the natives. We could have done the same, but were
restrained by the consideration that such proceedings would be
considered disrespectful to your Excellency and the British
Government. We do not think, however, that for this forbearance
we are the less entitled to consideration either from your
Excellency or the British Government.<br>
<br>
"It appears to us, that Lord Glenelg has taken an enlightened and
comprehensive view of the compensation or indulgence, that should
be granted to the settlers, when he bases it on the
<i>bona-fide</i> occupancy of the land in pasture, and other
agricultural purposes. We have, we believe, imported as large a
number of sheep (the other stock is of comparatively little
value) into Port Phillip as the members of the Association, and
are therefore, we conceive, entitled to an equal amount of
compensation. Such certainly was the intention of the Right Hon.
the Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time he wrote the
despatch already referred to.<br>
<br>
"We respectfully submit, the Association are either legally
entitled to the land they claim (and if that be your Excellency's
opinion, it must be conceded to them, however inexpedient it may
be to the interests of the new Colony that so fair a portion of
its territories should fall into the hands of a few individuals),
or they are not legally entitled to it. If they be not entitled
to it, they can be considered as unauthorized occupiers of the
land like ourselves and deemed deserving of consideration in the
same ratio as the other settlers; and that ratio, in our humble
opinion, can only be determined in the manner clearly pointed out
by the Eight Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
viz.&mdash;the quantity of land occupied by the depasturage of
sheep, or other agricultural purposes up to the time of the
arrival of Captain Lonsdale in the Colony.<br>
<br>
"The Association we freely admit may have made more presents to
the natives of Port Phillip than we did, but as our flocks were
in detached situations in the country, and we knew the
Association were in the habit of giving the blacks flour, we were
induced, that we might not excite their enmity against us, to do
the same thing; and in this way incurred very considerable
expense.<br>
<br>
"In conclusion we would respectfully observe that the quantity of
compensation to the occupiers of land at Port Phillip previous to
the arrival of any constituted authority, will not operate
prejudicially as a precedent in the other territories under your
Excellency's control, as no other Colony is likely to be
established within the bounds of these territories, where the
first settlers will be entirely beyond the protection of the New
South Wales Police, will be entirely without the assistance of
Convict labour, and will have to incur the risk and expense of a
sea voyage for every individual person, animal or thing they
bring into the new Colony. No one, who has not actually
experienced the difficulties attending the formation of a new and
totally distinct Colony, where everything has to be imported by
sea, can be fully aware of the trouble and expense attending such
a proceeding. We doubt not however that these circumstances, have
been fully stated to Lord Glenelg, and that it is in
consideration of them, that he has determined we are entitled to
consideration in the purchase of land in the new
Colony.</blockquote>
<p>This memorial which bears the same date as that previously
referred to, is also certified as "a true copy", by "G.
Mackillop, Chairman of the Meeting," and is signed by all the
same subscribers, except Messrs. T. and W. Robertson, Steal,
Brown and Caldwell.</p>
<p>In a reply to it, dated Sydney, January 2nd, 1837, Mr. Deas
Thomson informs Mr. Mackillop that the Government could not
entertain the request, it having been "only in pursuance of the
instructions of the Secretary of State that the claims of the
Association were entertained here, and as the Council were of
opinion that the Instructions had reference to that Body only, it
would have been inconsistent with the view which the Council took
of the unauthorized occupation generally to have extended to the
memorialists the advantages which the instructions confined to
the Association."</p>
<p>By letter of June 14th, 1838, to Sir Geo. Gipps, Lord Glenelg
"fully concurs in the decision of Sir Richard Bourke conveyed to
the parties interested by the Colonial Secretary's letter of the
2nd January, 1837."</p>
<p>In a memorial to the Secretary of State, dated Hobart Town,
January 31st, 1838, Messrs. Chas. McLachlan, Geo. Fred. Bead, and
G. Mackillop ask for remission of purchase-money of land, to
persons "not connected with the Association who had shipped sheep
to Port Phillip previous to the arrival there of the first Police
Magistrate," on the same terms as the 7000<i>l</i>. remission was
conceded to the Association. The memorialists ably contend that
they are as well if not better entitled to such a concession than
the Association, which in respect of its purchase from the
natives had set itself up "in opposition to the Government."</p>
<p>It is urged that the Secretary of State's instructions were
intended to apply to all persons who had resorted to the
settlement up to the period specified. The memorial states, and
founds an argument in favour of its object upon the fact,
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. G. Mackillop wishing, in the beginning of 1835,
to establish a communication between the South West extremity of
Monera (the province in New South Wales behind Twofold Bay) and
Port Phillip or Western Port&mdash;proceeded from Monera, by the
Southern end of the Australian Alps, for about 100 miles in the
direction of these ports. In this journey he came to Omio, which
will at some future period be found to be one of the finest sheep
districts in New South Wales. No European had ever before been
within 50 or 60 miles of that place, and he may therefore be said
to have discovered it."</blockquote>
<p>Sir George Gipps in a despatch of April, 17th, 1838, enclosing
the above, deprecates the reopening of the question of
compensation, which he says appears "to have been set at rest by
your Lordship's despatch of July 10th, 1837," approving of the
proceedings of the Executive Council; and Lord Glenelg, in a
reply of November 9th, 1838, endorses that view.</p>
<p>In a letter of January 3rd, 1839, Sir Geo, Grey informs Mr.
Mackillop, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"On a review of the case Sir George Gipps was
informed, that he was right in the conclusion at which he had
arrived, that the whole question of compensation to the original
settlers at Port Phillip was set at rest by the instruction of
the Secretary of State addressed to the Governor of New South
Wales in July, 1837;&mdash;and that Sir George Gipps was directed
to return an answer to the applicants to that
effect."</blockquote>
<p>In a despatch of January 14th, 1836, from Governor Arthur to
Lord Glenelg, information is given of the refusal of the
Executive Council to accede to the application of the Van
Diemen's Land Company, to be allowed to exchange: a large tract
of their land for some in another district, and His Excellency
goes on to suggest that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Should your Lordship, however, be disposed without
such consideration" (as had been previously mentioned in the
despatch), "to take a more favourable view of their claims, I
would submit that these might possibly be satisfied by conceding
a portion of the territory of Dutergalla or Iraumoo, on the coast
of New Holland; and it is perhaps proper I should add that whilst
I concur with the Council in the opinion that the Government has
redeemed every promise made to the Directors. . . . I have the
honour to submit the copy of a letter received by the Colonial
Secretary from Mr. Curr, suggesting the course I have now thrown
out for the consideration of His Majesty's Government, although I
clearly perceive the same difficulty will present itself at
Dutergalla, which has so obviously existed here, in the jealousy
of the Colonists generally that lands have been alienated on more
favourable terms to the Company than to private
settlers."</blockquote>
<p>The suggestion made by Mr. Curr, Secretary of the Company, on
December 4th, 1835, to the Colonial Secretary of Van Diemen's
Land, was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have not had the honour to receive any
communication from His Excellency on the subject of the Van
Diemen's Land Company's claim for an exchange of land. If His
Excellency admits that they have claims, but feels also a
difficulty in satisfying them out of the land remaining unlocated
in this island, he may perhaps think it right to advise that land
should be granted to them adjacent to Port Phillip.<br>
<br>
"I venture to suggest this with the view to remove what may
appear to His Excellency a real difficulty, but at the same time
I must remind him that the Company by their present Charter can
only hold lands in Van Diemen's Land and its
dependencies."</blockquote>
<p>It need scarcely be added that this idea was not carried
out.</p>
<p>With a despatch of April 5th, 1836, Sir Richard Bourke, in
forwarding the annexed application to Viscount Glenelg,
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Amongst the many speculations in land which are
afloat in this and the neighbouring Colony, I have the honour to
submit, in a letter from Van Diemen's Land, one of the most
plausible. I have therefore consented to place the project before
your Lordship, though I cannot recommend that the regulations
under which land is now sold should be varied, either on behalf
of this or any other application which has yet been brought under
my notice.<br>
<br>
"Western Port is immediately adjoining Port Phillip, and if your
Lordship should consent to the sale of land at the latter place,
as recommended in my despatch of the 10th October last. No. 99,
the sale at Western Port will soon follow in extension of the
occupations at the former; as it is probable the line of sea
coast, when affording good pasture, will be preferred to the
interior of the country."</blockquote>
<p>The letter in question of March 10th, 1836, was addressed to
Mr. McLeay, Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, by Mr. R.L.
Murray, of Dyrryrne, Van Diemen's Land, on behalf "of a party of
gentlemen here and myself." They desired "to be permitted to
purchase from the Crown fifty thousand acres of land at Western
Port, to be selected fairly as respects water and every other
frontage, taking good and bad together. For this," he says, "we
beg to offer five shillings an acre, and to pay to the Government
a quit rent of ten shillings for one hundred acres towards
defraying the expense of a Government establishment for our
protection."</p>
<p>A letter of application, dated Hobart Town, May 18th, 1838, is
addressed to Mr. Deas Thomson, Colonial Secretary of New South
Wales, for permission to work the coal-mines of Western Port. It
bears the signatures of Messrs. C. Swanston, Charles McLachlan,
Thos. Learmonth, John Dobson, G. Mackillop, Geo. Cartwright, Jas.
Allport, and Hugh Murray. It states that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"There are at present about 200,000 sheep in the New
Colony of Port Phillip, chiefly ewes imported from this Island in
the last three years, and their produce, and that there are also
about 50,000 sheep now on their way to the same place from Yass.
You probably also know that the whole population of Port Phillip
does not at present exceed 1500 persons.<br>
<br>
"It must be evident to you therefore there is not the least
probability there will be a market in Port Phillip for many years
for one-tenth part of the fat wethers that must be produced by
these flocks. Under these circumstances, we the undersigned,
proprietors of sheep and cattle at Port Phillip, have for some
time contemplated establishing in conjunction with other persons
residing there a large and efficient steamer to run between Port
Phillip, Adelaide and this Island; but in order that we may be
able to do this, it is indispensable that we have the use of the
coal which has long been known to exist at Western Port." "It
would be impossible," they point out, "for a steamer to carry a
sufficient quantity to take her from this to Port Phillip, from
thence to Adelaide and back here."</blockquote>
<p align="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>
<blockquote>"If the farmers at Port Phillip be not able to
dispose of their stock in this Island for want of a steamer it
must be evident to His Excellency from the fact we have already
referred to, that the New Colony will be ere long brought into a
state of extreme pecuniary embarrassment, and that hence it will
be impossible for the New South Wales Government to sell land
there or to make the place pay for the Civil and Military
Establishment now in it."</blockquote>
<p>This application gave rise to a question&mdash;respecting
which there are many letters and documents&mdash;as to whether
the monopoly of coal granted to the Australian Agricultural
Company for thirty-one years from 1830, would prevent other
persons from working the Western Port seams.</p>
<p>On December 7th, 1838, Lord Glenelg acquaints the Australian
Company, that the Law Officers of the Crown have given it as
their opinion that "the arrangement in question does not appear
to them to impose any restriction whatever on Her M. right of
working any coal-mines in the Colony. That it does prevent Her M.
from granting coal-mines to other persons to be worked by them
without the previous sanction of the Secretary of State; but that
with such sanction Her M. may, without at all infringing the
terms of the arrangement, make a grant of land including the coal
mines, or authorize any person to work coal-mines reserved to
H.M." The opinion is also given, that the Government might allow
convict labour to be employed in working such mines.</p>
<p>In an opinion signed J. Campbell and R.W. Rolfe, it is stated
that "although the only circumstance particularly mentioned in
the letter and despatch of the 31st July, 1828," addressed to the
Company, "as likely to induce the Home Government to interfere
with the monopoly of the Company is the sale of coal <i>at an
exorbitant price</i>, yet the power reserved is quite general and
might be exercised whenever any circumstances should render it
necessary. And in truth unless the Company mean to say that they
will supply coal in abundance <i>at Port Phillip</i> from their
mines at Newcastle, at the same price at which coal might be
raised and sold from the mines supposed to exist in the
neighbourhood of Port Phillip, we think the very case
contemplated by the despatch of July 31st, 1828, will have
arisen. The excess of cost occasioned by the carriage of the coal
700 miles will make the price at Port Phillip <i>an
exorbitant</i> price within the fair meaning of the parties when
they were settling the terms of the agreement in July, 1828."</p>
<p>In a despatch of June, 1839, Sir G. Gipps is informed of this
opinion, and that it will rest with him "to take such measures as
may appear most advisable for ensuring to the settlers at Port
Phillip the benefit of those mines."</p>
<p>The claims of one of the founders of Port Phillip, and of his
family, cannot but be regarded with interest. The following
letter is from the original document in the Record Office,
bearing Batman's own signature.</p>

"The Memorial of John Batman<br>
   "Most respectfully showeth<br>
<br>
"That your Memorialist is a native of this Colony and has resided
in Van Diemen's Land Fifteen years and begs to refer your
Lordship to the late Lieut.-Governor Colonel Arthur for the
services he rendered to that Government at different periods.
That your Memorialist was an extensive Farmer and grazier in that
Colony and from his frequent excursions through the island when
employed by that Government to suppress the outrages of the
aborigines upon the settlers, and also at other times on private
business enabled him to form a perfect knowledge of its
capabilities for grazing&mdash;some of the most extensive
graziers agreed with him in opinion that it would be highly
desirable that some outlet should be obtained for the surplus
stock, and therefore calculated, that the southern parts of New
South Wales afforded the greatest facilities for that purpose.
That your Memorialist in May 1835 chartered a small vessel and
proceeded to this place and after exploring it for some time
found the country to be well adapted for all purposes but more
particularly for sheep. That your Lordship's Memorialist during
his perambulation into the interior opened a friendly intercourse
with the aborigines which feeling exists to this present period.
On your Memorialist's return to Van Diemen's Land he left the
three white servants who accompanied him in his expedition to
keep up the friendly feeling then existing between him and the
natives with supplies and sundry clothing to distribute among any
other tribe who might come down and of whom he had not met with.
From the favourable report he gave of the country he passed over
and the treaty he entered into with the natives induced a number
of gentlemen to form themselves into a Company with a view of
sending sheep to Port Phillip. Nearly thirty thousand were
exported the first year besides horses, cattle, &amp;c. and your
Lordship's Memorialist is convinced that fully forty thousand
sheep besides other stock will be imported this season. Feeling
the necessity of keeping up the good understanding, so happily
commenced and already established, the vessel was sent back with
further supplies with your Memorialist's brother wife and four
children to take charge of the establishment and to use all means
in his power to protect and conciliate the aborigines, which he
fully carried into effect up to your Lordship's Memorialist's
arrival with his family, consisting of his wife, seven daughters,
son, and thirty servants. It then became necessary for your
Memorialist to incur considerable expense in erecting suitable
dwellings, stores, garden, &amp;c. for their reception; he
likewise further begs leave to state he has imported stock and
other property to the amount of ten thousand pounds sterling and
consequently trusts your Lordship will take all the above
circumstances into your most favourable consideration and grant
him the land he has improved upon extending to about twenty acres
not being in the township now laid out.</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="center">"He remains with all due
respect<br>
         "Your Lordship's most humble and obedient servant,</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<small>JOHN
BATMAN</small>."   </p>
<p>In a despatch of April 28th, 1837, Sir Richard Bourke
transmits to Lord Glenelg the preceding memorial, in which Mr.
Batman "applies for a grant of land adjoining the Township of
Melbourne"&mdash;the local government having refused to accede to
a similar application, which they could not have granted
consistently with their views expressed in a despatch of the
previous 12th November, "For the present Mr. Batman has been
informed that although no title can be conferred upon him, and he
is to abstain from erecting any additional buildings or
enclosures, he is at liberty to continue his occupation of the
house and garden until further notice."</p>
<p>Lord Glenelg, in reply to Sir R. Bourke, writes on 29th
September, 1837,&mdash;"My despatch of the 10th July last will
have removed the doubts which you entertained on this case. I
entirely approve your decision on Mr. Batman's claim, and of your
having permitted him to occupy the house and garden until farther
notice. I have to request that you will inform Mr. Batman that I
regret my inability to comply with the prayer of his
memorial."</p>
<p>Batman writes again to the Secretary of State,&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Melbourne, Port
Phillip</i>,   <br>
"30<i>th March</i>, 1838.        </p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;I have had the honour
of perusing a letter addressed by the Acting Governor of New
South Wales, to Mr. Henry Batman of Melbourne, Port Phillip,
dated the 23rd February, 1838, stating that the Right Honourable
the Secretary of State 'regrets his inability to comply with your
prayer for a grant of land at Melbourne.'<br>
<br>
"Upon inquiry I find my brother, Mr. Henry Batman, to whom the
letter was addressed, did not memorialize your Lordship upon this
subject. I therefore conclude that the letter was intended for
me, having forwarded a memorial to your Lordship dated March,
1837. Sir Richard Bourke in transmitting this memorial, was
pleased to recommend it, and to express a wish that Her Majesty's
Government would accede to its prayer.<br>
<br>
"I now take the liberty of re-stating my case to the
consideration of your Lordship, in the full hope that Her
Majesty's Government will be induced to grant me the land, upon
which the house and premises in which I now reside, with my
family&mdash;not exceeding twenty acres&mdash;I have already
expended upwards of &pound;1500 in improvements on the land, and
if the instructions issued to the authorities in New South Wales
for the sale of land are carried into effect, I need not inform
your Lordship how ruinous the result would be to my large
family.<br>
<br>
"I am induced still further to press upon your Lordship's
consideration this circumstance in consequence of a letter
received by John Spottiswoode, Esq. Solicitor, in London, to the
Port Phillip Association, from James Stephen, Esq., dated 27th
July, 1837, in which your Lordship is pleased to express it to
have been your intention to have afforded to the Association
similar advantages to those now claimed by me, had there been
sufficient grounds for such consideration. I take the liberty of
quoting a paragraph from Mr. Stephens' letter in support of this
impression. 'If for example, a house and garden occupying
together an acre of land had been formed at the expense of the
Association it appeared to His Lordship unreasonable that any
such improved spot should be the object of general competition.'
'Supposing for the sake of illustration, the general upset price
to have been fixed not at the usual rate of 5<i>s</i>., but at
the reduced rate of 4<i>s</i>., then it was His Lordship's design
that the acre of ground, with the house and all the other
improvements upon it, should be offered to the Association at
4<i>s</i>.'<br>
<br>
"As my improvements were made prior to the Government Resident's
occupation of the settlement, I respectfully submit that my case
is clearly one that your Lordship anticipated. As the first
occupant of the country, and one through whose means a friendly
intercourse has been established with the natives, I humbly hope
that your Lordship will allow me to purchase the land in question
at a moderate price and not subject it to public competition.<br>
         I have the honour to be my Lord,</blockquote>
<p class="quote" align="right">"Your Lordship's most obedient
humble servant,       <br>
"(Signed)                   <small>JOHN BATMAN</small>."   </p>
<p>On August 25th, 1838, Lord Glenelg writes to Sir George
Gipps,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have received an application from Mr. John Batman
of Port Phillip for permission to purchase at a moderate price
and not subject to public competition a portion of land in that
settlement not exceeding twenty acres, on which he states that
the house and premises inhabited by himself and his family are
situated, having already expended upwards of &pound;1500 in
improvements on the land. You will be so good as to call on Mr.
Batman for a copy of his letter.<br>
<br>
"If on the receipt of his application the result should be to
show to the conviction of yourself and your Council that the
facts are accurately stated by Mr. Batman, the case would appear
plainly to fall within the principle laid down in the letter
which was addressed by my directions to the Port Phillip
Association on the 27th July, 1837&mdash;the scope and meaning of
which was correctly interpreted in the Minute of the Executive
Council of your Government No. 25, dated 21st October, 1836.
Under these circumstances I am of opinion that in the purchase of
the land on which his house was built with any adjacent land
actually cultivated by him as a garden or improved by any
material outlay previously to the arrival at Port Phillip of the
general Instructions on the subject of the disposal of the Crown
Land in that settlement Mr. Batman should be allowed the fair
value of such improvements."</blockquote>
<p>Sir G, Gipps, on July 30th, 1839, writes to the Marquis of
Normanby, Secretary of State for the Colonies, with respect to
Batman's claim, which, the despatch states, had only resulted in
the Government having "as an indulgence, consented to allow the
materials of the houses, and everything else that is moveable to
be taken away for the benefit of Mr. Batman's family."</p>
<p>The following copy of a letter from Batman is enclosed with
the despatch:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Melbourne, Port

"12<i>th March</i>, 1839.   </p>
<blockquote>"To the Hon. the Colonial Secretary,<br>

&amp;c.<br>
     "Sydney,<br>

<br>
"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;I have the honour to acknowledge
receipt of your letter of the 24th January last, respecting my
letter to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State, applying
to him to purchase the land at the minimum price, that I have
made improvements upon, and where I now reside and have done so
upwards of three years.<br>
<br>
"I herewith forward according to your request, copy of the letter
addressed by me to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State,
also copy of memorial forwarded through General Bourke applying
for a grant of the above mentioned land, but which I found could
not be acceded to, but that in all probability I might be allowed
to purchase it without competition, and therefore applied
accordingly.<br>
<br>
"I also have the honour of transmitting tor His Excellency's
further information, a plan of the land and the improvements
thereupon, as it was on the arrival of the Government here and as
it is now.<br>
<br>
I beg further to remark that I have imported at very considerable
expense and trouble from Van Diemen's Land and Sydney, upwards of
one thousand fruit-trees of every description, which are now in a
highly flourishing state and from which I anticipate much benefit
to the Colony."<br>
<br>
"His Excellency will I trust perceive my case at the present
moment to be one of greater hardship than it was prior to the
present date, in consequence of the increase in the value of land
at the settlement, thereby rendering me incapable of purchasing
if such land is placed up to Public competition and from the
various documents produced explanatory of my situation, I may
perhaps venture to hope that His Excellency will take all the
circumstances of my case into his most favourable
consideration.</blockquote>

sir,           <br>
"Your obedient humble servant,</p>
<p align="right" class="quote">"(Signed)          <small>JOHN
BATMAN</small>."   </p>
<p>A copy of Captain Lonsdale's letter to the Governor, dated
Melbourne, 6th May, 1839, is also given, in which nine queries
respecting Batman's land are answered.</p>
<p>In reply to the first it is stated that "in 1835 or the
beginning of 1836, he," Batman, "put up the wooden house he
brought from Van Diemen's Land upon the ground he now wishes to
obtain;" to the second, that it was "included in the boundary
described by the Association as the limit of their intended
possession," and that Batman had "received his share of the
7000<i>l</i>. equally with the other members;" to the third, that
Batman has no actual right to have his case considered separately
from that of the Association; he had, however, some sanction from
Sir Richard Bourke, on his visit to Melbourne, for occupying the
land, pending the consideration of his application for higher
compensation, on the score of the extra exertion he had undergone
and the improvements he had effected in establishing the
settlement; to the fourth, that the value of the improvements was
about 400<i>l</i>.; to the fifth, that "the house and about half
of the stores were put up in 1835, or beginning of 1836, the
men's hut and barn in the end of 1836, and the remainder within
two years, the gardens were formed in 1835 and 1836. The house is
made of wood as also the kitchen, and are, therefore moveable;
"to the sixth, it is answered that the land "is quite close to
the South West extremity of the Town, in fact the end street runs
through the original garden;" to the seventh and
eighth,&mdash;"Some of the Town allotments which are in the
immediate neighbourhood of this land have been sold at various
and high prices, the upset price being 150<i>l</i>. per acre.
From the position of this land I expect it would fetch as high a
price as any of the Town allotments if it was laid out in the
same manner;" to ninth, an answer is given explaining the plans
sent; it is stated that Batman had occupied in the quarter
indicated more than he could claim, "as part of it forms a
portion of the Town of Melbourne;" and that the land "which would
come within the meaning of the correspondence is the land on
which the houses stand, the two portions marked on the plan No.
1, 'Garden', except that part which is in Spencer Street, and the
portion marked in the same plan 'Under Cultivation Fenced
in.'"</p>
<p>Captain Lonsdale concludes, "I beg to return your Excellency's
letter as you desire and the two plans, and to add that after a
protracted illness Mr. Batman died last night."</p>
<p>A copy of the minute of the Executive Council, dated June 7th,
1839, is also enclosed. After reciting the documents laid before
the Council, including the preceding letter from Captain
Lonsdale, the minute runs,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The Council, after perusing and attentively
considering the various papers submitted to them by the Governor,
are of opinion that Mr. Batman has not established any sufficient
grounds for disturbing the question of compensation, to himself
and the other primary settlers at Port Phillip, which appears to
the Council to have been set at rest by Lord Glenelg's despatch
addressed to Sir Richard Bourke, dated 10th July, 1837. Under
which circumstances they recommend that a communication be made
to Mr. Batman's representatives that his application cannot be
complied with."</blockquote>
<p>A despatch to Sir Geo. Gipps, of December 16th, 1839, from the
Colonial Office, then presided over by Lord John Russell, thus
speaks,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I approve of your adoption of the advice of the
Executive Council on Mr. Batman's claims and of your having
allowed the materials of the house and other moveables to be
taken away for the benefit of the family of Mr. Batman. . . .
before the land is given up to the Colonial
Government."</blockquote>
<p>In a petition to the Queen, dated Melbourne, July 25th, 1848,
and enclosed to Lord Stanley by Sir Charles Fitzroy in a despatch
of September 6th, 1848, Batman's widow, son, and seven daughters
unsuccessfully applied for a grant of land at Port Phillip. They
state that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"John Batman in consequence of the exposure of his
person, under all changes of weather and from sleeping many
months in the open air, while engaged in traversing and exploring
this country, contracted a disease which having confined him to
his house and bed for two years, terminated his existence in May,
1839, at the age of thirty-nine years, leaving behind him a
family of eight children, seven of whom are females of from eight
to sixteen years of age and one boy seven years
old."</blockquote>
<p>Batman and his family were certainly not generously treated.
The Government&mdash;even after becoming convinced that the first
founders of the new settlements had done good instead of
pernicious work&mdash;seemed afraid of making even the most
trifling concessions to them, lest these should be taken as
precedents for other claims, which, from the exceptional
positions of the founders, could not have been made out by any
other persons.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> purpose of this work is now accomplished.
The history of Victoria, from the earliest discovery of the
territory of the colony to its permanent occupation by British
inhabitants, has been related <i>in extenso</i> from the most
authentic and original sources of information. It would not,
however, be desirable that we should stop short at this point. It
is therefore intended, in this and the two next chapters, to
note, on a much more abbreviated scale, the leading landmarks in
the history of the colony from the time of its settlement, as the
Port Phillip District of New South Wales, to its erection into
the separate colony of Victoria, and subsequent investment with
all the rights of constitutional self-government. With this
important events in the year 1856, the early history of Victoria
may be considered to have completely closed.</p>
<p>Only the most leading incidents of the period of which we are
about to treat can be given&mdash;many others of interest being
omitted, so that the remaining portion of this work may not run
to the length of that which precedes.</p>
<p>Municipal institutions were conferred on Melbourne by Act of
the Government and Legislative Council of New South Wales, 6
Vict. No. 7&mdash;"An Act to incorporate the inhabitants of the
town of Melbourne." It contained 115 sections, and was similar to
the measure preceding it, No. 8, for incorporating Sydney. It
divided the town into four wards, Gipps, Bourke, La Trobe, and
Lonsdale.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The extracts in this chapter, with scarcely an
exception, are a token from despatches, Parliamentary Papers, and
Colonial Government Gazettes in the Record Office.]</p>
<p>In a despatch of November 27th, 1842, Sir George Gipps states
that he had decided that the style of the Mayor of Sydney should
be "Right Worshipful", and that of the Mayor of Melbourne
"Worshipful". This was approved of by Lord Stanley in a despatch
of July 3rd, 1848.</p>
<p>The order of precedence of the Superintendents of Port
Phillip, communicated by Sir George Gipps, December 23rd, 1842,
and approved by the Secretary of State, was arranged as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"The Governor.<br>
  The Chief Justice.<br>
  The Commander of the Forces.<br>
  The Bishop.<br>
  The Superintendent of Port Phillip.</p>
<p>This was done to avoid the possibility of a question being
raised whether, under the Act establishing the corporation, the
Mayor of Melbourne might not have claimed precedence of the
Superintendent.</p>
<p>In writing, December 26th, 1842, to Lord Stanley, Sir George
Gipps enclosed a copy of a despatch from Mr. La Trobe, dated
Melbourne, December 14th, informing him of the first municipal
elections for that place, and that Mr. Henry Condell had, on the
previous day, been sworn in first Mayor, before the Resident
Judge of the Supreme Court. A return, enclosed in Mr. La Trobe's
despatch, gives the particulars of the election as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<br>
<p class="quote" align="center">The electoral body consisted of
&pound;25 householders.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary representation at first prescribed for Port
Phillip was on the strictest homoeopathic system. In a despatch,
dated Sydney, January 1st, 1839, Sir George Gipps communicates to
the Secretary of State his views on the subject of the creation
of a legislature for New South Wales, which he thought should
contain not less than one half, or more than two thirds of
members elected by the people; and that "a power should be
reserved of adding one member for the District of Port Phillip
whenever its population shall amount to seven thousand souls, and
a second when it shall amount to fifteen thousand."</p>
<p>An act of a special session of the Legislative Council of New
South Wales, 6 Vict. No. 16, to provide for the division of the
colony into electoral districts, was passed, February 23rd, 1843,
to carry out the Imperial statute 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 76, of
1842&mdash;"An Act for the Government of New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land"&mdash;which conferred upon the former a
Legislative Council of thirty-six members&mdash;twenty-four of
whom were to be elected, and twelve nominated by the Crown. It
was provided by the Imperial Act, that Sydney and Melbourne
should be electoral districts&mdash;the former returning two
members, and the latter one, and the District of Port Phillip at
least five; and that the electoral qualification should be the
possession of a freehold estate of the clear value of &pound;200,
or as a householder occupying a dwelling of the clear annual
value of &pound;20. Members were required to have freehold
property worth &pound;2000, or of the clear annual value of
&pound;200.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council which preceded that which was thus
constituted, consisted of fifteen members nominated by the
Crown&mdash;some of them being official, and some non-official.
This body was established by the Imperial Act 9 Geo. IV. c.
83.**</p>

<p>In a despatch of July 18th, 1843, Governor Gipps informs Lord
Stanley of the first Parliamentary election which ever took place
in Australia. The list of constituencies and members which he
encloses, being of such historical interest, is appended

<p>The Governor, in a despatch of August 9th, 1843, reports that
the Council met on 1st of that month, and had elected Mr.
Alexander McLeay speaker, who was presented next day to his
Excellency, by whom his election was approved. Sir George also
states that he opened the session on the 3rd, with a speech, in
person.</p>
<p>Lord Stanley, in acknowledging the letter reporting the
meeting of this legislature says, "I have been much gratified to
observe the good feeling which appears to have pervaded that Body
at a moment of acknowledged difficulty."</p>
<p>The Sydney <i>Morning Herald</i> of August 2nd states, "that
all the members were present at the first meeting of the council
except Dr. Thomson, who has not arrived from Port Phillip, in
consequence of the detention of the steamer, and Mr. Jones, who
it is said will not take his seat." The <i>Herald</i> of the same
date gives a long debate on the election of the Speaker&mdash;Mr.
Edward Hamilton having been nominated in opposition to Mr.
McLeay.</p>
<p>The first vacancy in this first Australian representative
legislature was caused by the resignation of Mr. Richard Jones, a
non-official nominee. Sir George Gipps informs Lord Stanley of
the fact in a despatch of November 10th, 1848, and states that,
subject to Her Majesty's approval, he had filled the seat by the
appointment of Mr. Robert Lowe&mdash;"a Barrister of England, and
of New South Wales. . . . Mr. Lowe has been but a short time in
the colony, but he was for many years a distinguished member of
the University of Oxford, where he was a Fellow of Magdalen
College, and for some time one of the Examining Masters. He is a
man of first-rate abilities, and a fluent speaker." Thus began
the public life of one who is now, and has for some years; been
among the most prominent figures in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>On September 13th, 1844, the Governor informs the Secretary of
State of the resignation of Mr. Lowe, "on the 28th
ultimo"&mdash;a week and a day after a famous speech, presently
to be noticed&mdash;and of the appointment of Mr. John Lamb to
the vacant seat. Mr. Lowe retired in consequence of not being
able to agree sufficiently with the policy of the Government to
continue a nominee. He was afterwards for some years a very
leading representative member of the Council.</p>
<p>A despatch of Sir George Gipps of July 26th, 1844, announces
the election of Sir Thomas Mitchell and Mr. Adolphus Young, now
M.P. for Helston, in the room of Messrs. Condell and Thomson,
resigned. The resignation of Sir Thomas is, however, reported in
a despatch of August 18th.</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps, on May 23rd, 1846, informs the Secretary of
State, Right Hon. W.E. Gladstone, of the resignation of the
Speaker, Mr. Alexander McLeay, and the election in his stead of
Dr. Nicholson&mdash;"one of the members representing the District
of Port Phillip."</p>
<p>No briefer or more emphatic summary of the first ten years'
progress of our new colony could be given, than that in the
Governor's speech closing the session of the Legislative Council,
November 13th, 1845&mdash;just eleven years after the Hentys had
founded the first settlement in the Port Phillip territory. Sir
George Gipps says,&mdash;"Lastly, gentlemen, I may assert with
confidence and with some degree, I trust, of honest exultation,
that in no part of the wide dominions of the British Crown, at no
period within England's history, was a Colony planted and brought
to maturity, without expense of any sort to the Parent State,
surpassing in energy, wealth, and character, that which has
silently grown up in the course of the last ten years, within
your Southern Boundary, the Settlement of Port Phillip."</p>
<p>The desire for separation from New South Wales, and for the
formation of their district into a distinct Colony, was early
displayed by the people of Port Phillip, and was strongly
intensified by their having to send representatives to the
Legislative Council in Sydney.</p>
<p>The printed papers on the question, laid before the Imperial
Parliament, were very voluminous, comprising petitions,
particulars of the protracted inquiry before the Executive
Council of New South Wales, which preceded its decision of April,
1846, and the views of various persons competent to express
opinions on the subject.</p>
<p>Among the most remarkable papers is a printed
report&mdash;also in the <i>Morning Herald</i> of the
21st&mdash;of a debate in the Legislative Council in Sydney on
August 20th, 1844, when Dr. Lang moved,&mdash;"That a humble
address be presented to her Majesty the Queen, praying that her
Majesty will graciously be pleased to direct that the requisite
steps be taken for the speedy and entire separation of the
district of Port Phillip from the territory of New South Wales,
and its erection into a separate and independent Colony." The
speech of the mover was long and able; the seconder was Mr.
Robinson. On a division the Ayes were six, namely, "Dr.
Nicholson, Mr. Walker, Mr. Young, Mr. Lowe, Dr. Lang, Mr.
Robinson (teller). Noes nineteen&mdash;Mr. Murray, the
Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, the Colonial Secretary,
the Collector of Customs, Mr. Macarthur, Mr. Lord, Mr. Therry,
the Commander of the Forces, Mr. Cowper, Mr. Bland, Mr. Panton,
Mr. Foster, Captain Dumaresq, Mr. Lawson, Mr. Coghill, Mr.
Bradley, Mr. Icely, the Colonial Treasurer (teller)."</p>
<p>All the members who voted for the resolution spoke upon it.
One speech is especially remarkable as a first display of the
parliamentary powers of a man who has since commanded the ear of
the House of Commons, and held high office in the English
Cabinet. It also eloquently expresses very laudable aspirations
after the permanent unity and confederation of the British
Empire. Mr. Robert Lowe began by saying that, "As a general rule,
he thought that their interests"&mdash;those of the
Colonies&mdash;"were not consulted by frittering them away into
minute particles, but by combining as large a territory into a
single state as could be effectually controlled by a single
government. He cordially agreed in the abstract truth of the
motto prefixed to the article in the newspaper of that morning,
that 'union is strength', and he would extend that principle to
the whole Colonial Empire of Great Britain. He hoped and believed
that the time was not remote, when Great Britain would give up
the idea of treating the dependencies of the Crown as children,
who were to be cast adrift by their parent as soon as they
arrived at manhood, and substitute for it the far wiser and
nobler policy of knitting herself and her Colonies into one
mighty confederacy, girdling the earth in its whole
circumference, and confident against the world in arts and arms.
Neither could he agree that the separation would be otherwise
than injurious, in some extent at least, to New South Wales. It
implied the loss of a fertile and wealthy province, already
paying much more into the treasury than it drew out of it; and he
was also fearful that a separation might be attended with that
animosity and ill-feeling which are so apt to prevail between
neighbouring states, and that the result might be a war of
tariffs and restrictive duties, which he held in utter horror and
aversion; but still, compelled by the force of truth and justice,
he was bound to say that these considerations came too late;"
because, he contended, the administration of the district had
been from the first conducted upon a system distinct from the
rest of New South Wales.</p>
<p>We have seen that a week after this speech Mr. Lowe resigned
his nominee membership. We again hear of him&mdash;in a report in
these papers,* from the Sydney <i>Morning Herald</i>, of January
21st, 1848&mdash;making a very eloquent and powerful speech at a
public meeting in Sydney, in opposition to the proposal of Earl
Grey, in view of the separation of Port Phillip, to alter the
existing Constitution of New South Wales in an anti-popular
direction. The mover of one of the resolutions on this occasion
was Mr. Michie, the present Agent-General for Victoria, who made
one of his able, eloquent, and amusing speeches. Mr. Lowe is
again found at a public meeting in Sydney, eloquently denouncing
the evil system of transportation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Printed Parliamentary Paper, New South Wales,
1849, laid before the Imperial Parliament.]</p>
<p>According to a return moved for by Dr. Lang, in the
Legislative Council July 26th, 1844, and laid on the table and
ordered to be printed August 27th, 1844, the total number of
electors for the whole of New South Wales was in 1843-44, 9315;
in 1844-45, 8477; for the Port Phillip District, 470 and 475
respectively, and for the town of Melbourne 859 and 591
respectively.</p>
<p>A report, dated September 27th, 1844, of a Committee of the
Legislative Council, of which Rev. Dr. Lang was chairman,
recommends an extension of the suffrage, and that the town of
Melbourne, which bears a somewhat similar relation to Port
Phillip, to that which the City of Sydney bears to this part of
the Colony, and which has a constituency of 591 electors, should
return two members to the Legislature instead of one as at
present; for it seems preposterous that the 591 electors of that
large sea-port town should only return one member, while the 475
electors of the district, who are probably by no means superior
individually, either in property or intelligence to the electors
of Melbourne, should return so many as five."</p>
<p>Among the earliest documents on the question of separation is
a petition ** to the Legislative Council from 2194 inhabitants of
Port Phillip, praying for separation, which was ordered to be
printed August 21st, 1844.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Printed Parliamentary Paper, Port Phillip,
1860.]</p>
<p>With a despatch of January 12th, 1845, in which he expresses
no opinion on the subject. Sir George Gipps forwarded to the
Secretary of State a memorial from the six members for Port
Phillip, advocating the separation. It is signed "B. Boyd, Thos.
Walker, Adolphus Wm. Young, Chas. Nicholson, John Dunmore Lang,
and Jno. Phelps Robinson (M.C. for Melbourne)." Among other
statements the population of the District for 1843 is given at
25,000; revenue, &pound;61,343 14<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.;
expenditure, &pound;54,352; imports, &pound;183,321; exports,
&pound;277,672; sheep, 2,000,000; cattle, 140,000; horses,
5000.</p>
<p>A similar petition from the Town Council of Melbourne to the
Queen, signed by the Mayor, Mr. Henry Moor, is enclosed in a
subsequent despatch to Lord Stanley, also without comment of the
Governor.</p>
<p>The petition of the members for Port Phillip was referred by
Lord Stanley to Sir G. Gipps, in a despatch *** of June 12th,
1845, and the Governor states the decision of the Executive
Council upon it in one of April 29th, 1846. He gives an extract
from the minutes of the proceedings of that body of April 1st,
when separation was approved. Sir G. Gipps states, by his casting
vote&mdash;the Colonial Secretary and Commander of the Forces
voting for it, and the Bishop of Australia and the Colonial
Treasurer against. The form of Legislature recommended was that
of a Nominee Council.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** This and following are printed with the
Papers on the separation of Port Phillip, laid before the
Imperial Parliament in 1850, and are contained in a volume among
the New South Wales Papers in the Record Office.]</p>
<p>The documents laid before the Executive Council contain a very
able despatch, of March 3rd, 1846, from Mr. La Trobe, in which
the advantages and disadvantages of separation are exhaustively
examined and weighed with judicial fairness, the Superintendent's
judgment, however, decidedly inclining in favour of the measure.
Mr. Ed. Curr, chairman of the "Separation Committee," took an
active and able part in promoting the cause, and his name is
attached to a number of letters and documents on the subject
contained in the Parliamentary papers.</p>
<p>The electors of Port Phillip took most effective means of
demonstrating to the Home Government, that they regarded
representation in the Legislature of New South Wales as of no
value to them. At the general election of 1848 they abstained
from making any nomination for the five seats for the District;
and Earl Grey was elected for Melbourne by a large majority over
a candidate who could have served. In a despatch of September
23rd, 1848, Sir Chas. FitzRoy communicates this fact&mdash;of
which he had been informed by Mr. La Trobe, in a letter to the
Colonial Secretary of July 21st. The Returning Officer for the
district, Mr. Pohlman, describes what took place at the
nomination, in a letter to the Superintendent dated the previous
day. He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have the honour to request that your Honour will
be pleased to forward to His Excellency the Governor the enclosed
Writ of Election, which was transmitted to me, as Returning
Officer, to return five members to serve in the Legislative
Council of New South Wales for the electoral district of Port
Phillip, and to state to your Honour that, at the meeting held by
me this day for such election, there were no persons elected to
serve as members of the Legislative Council of this district.<br>
<br>
"The only candidate placed in nomination was Mr. Foster, who was
in the first instance proposed by Messrs. Wills and Williams,
electors of the district; but this gentleman, after several
electors had addressed the meeting without proposing any other
candidates, declined, on the suggestion of his friends, the
nomination made in his favour; and the electors who had moved and
seconded his nomination, withdrew the resolution which they had
proposed to that effect, and before any other candidate had been
named.<br>
<br>
"There being no time fixed for keeping open the meeting for
nomination, at the expiration of one hour from the commencement
thereof, I called upon the electors in due form a second time to
propose members to be returned under the writ, and no candidate
having been named, I closed the meeting.<br>
<br>
"I beg to add that there was no obstruction or interruption by
any riot or open violence which would have justified me in
adjourning the meeting under the 21st section of the
act."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Andrew Russell, Returning Officer for Melbourne, writes to
Mr. La Trobe July 27th:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I have the honour to enclose the writ addressed to
me by his Excellency the Governor, for the election of a member
to serve in the Legislative Council for the city of Melbourne
whereupon I have certified the return of 'The Right Hon. Henry
Grey'" (Earl Grey in the Peerage of Great Britain).<br>
<br>
"I beg leave to request that your Honour will transmit the writ,
together with the accompanying voting papers, to his Excellency
the Governor, by to-morrow's overland mail."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. La Trobe, in forwarding the writs on July 28th, expresses
his regret to the Governor at the course taken by the electors;
and Sir Chas. FitzRoy, in his despatch of September 22nd to the
Secretary of State, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"With respect to your Lordship's election for the
city of Melbourne, as the Crown Law Officers (as your Lordship
will perceive from the copy of their opinion annexed) have
pronounced it to be valid, I have not considered it advisable to
interfere further than by abstaining to notify it in the usual
manner in the Gazette, to show that the Government would in no
way make itself a party to a proceeding which it could not but
consider to be improper and unbecoming, if not actually intended
to be insulting."</blockquote>
<p>The opinion of Messrs. Plunkett and Foster, Attorney-General
and Solicitor-General of New South Wales was:&mdash; "That there
is no enactment or provision in the Constitutional Act (5 &amp; 6
Vict., c. 76) which prevents a British peer from being elected,
and sitting as a member of the Legislative Council of this
Colony; neither can it be taken for granted that Earl Grey has
not sufficient landed property within the Colony to qualify him
to take his seat. It appears to us, therefore, that whatever may
have been the intention of the electors of Melbourne in returning
Lord Grey, there is nothing illegal on the face of that return,
and that for the present, at least, he must be considered in law
as their representative."</p>
<p>With other papers forwarded by Sir C. FitzRoy in a despatch of
September 23rd, 1848, is a memorial to Earl Grey, signed "A.
Russell, Mayor of Melbourne," and adopted at a public meeting
over which he presided. This document presses the arguments in
favour of separation, and explains the circumstances connected
with the abortive elections. It is stated that the&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Six seats during five years have been occupied by no
fewer than seventeen members. . . . One representative went to
England, retaining his seat during his absence for nearly three
sessions, without producing even a remonstrance from his
constituents. Two elected resident members never sat at all, and
but one resident member ever sat out more than a single session.
Elections came at last to be attended by not more than a dozen or
twenty persons, few of whom were electors. . . . At the last
election, prior to the dissolution, when a nomination was called
for by the returning officer, there was actually no candidate at
all, and two electors present put in the name of Charles Hotson
Ebden, Esq., without pre-concert between themselves, or privity
with the gentleman so elected. . . . .<br>
<br>
"It was in this state of the question that a general election was
appointed to take place in the present month of July, 1848, and
the nominations at the hustings were to be made in Melbourne on
the 20th July of five members for the district of Port Phillip,
and on the 25th, of one member for the City of Melbourne. When
about four hundred persons, forming a fair average of the
district, assembled on the first day mentioned, the candidates
were found to be as follows:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"John Fitzgerald Leslie Foster, Esq., an inhabitant of Port
Phillip, having represented the district for a period of two
years, and of whose re-election there was no doubt.<br>
<br>
"William Sprott Boyd, Esq., of Sydney, who had published an
address to the electors.<br>
<br>
"Archibald Boyd, Esq., of Sydney, who without his knowledge, had
been put forward by a body of electors.<br>
<br>
"Robert Lowe, Esq. of Sydney, who without his knowledge, and
known to be a candidate with two other constituencies in New
South Wales Proper, would certainly have been put in
nomination.<br>
<br>
"There were two other candidates, named Adam Bogue, Esq. of
Sydney, who had addressed the electors, but who had failed, as
far as the public knows, to find any person to put him in
nomination, and a C. Campbell, Esq., also of Sydney, a person
whose very identity is still disputed amongst the electors, and
who also had failed to find any person to put him in nomination.
There were, therefore, it is believed only four candidates for
five seats. Such were the facts, when after the gentleman first
named had been duly nominated and seconded, two electors without
pre-concert between themselves, connected with parties differing
most widely from each other, and on grounds equally distinct,
addressed the electors. . . . . . Their arguments were
successful; the candidate consented with reluctance certainly and
we believe with very honest reluctance to retire; his nomination
was cancelled, no election of the five representatives took
place, and the writ of election was duly returned. It was
perfectly understood at the hustings, that a single elector
determined to fill the vacancies could have caused five members
to be returned, but nearly absolute unanimity prevailed, and at
all events not a single voice expressed a valid dissent. . . .
.<br>
<br>
"On the 25th July, the election of one member for the City of
Melbourne was to take place, when the unanimity which had
characterized the meeting of the 20th was at an end. . . . .<br>
<br>
"The result was that those who were in favour of a <i>bon&acirc;
fide</i> election put Mr. John Fitzgerald Leslie Foster again in
nomination, which obliged those who were in favour of
non-election to nominate a candidate who could not possibly take
his seat, and the name of your Lordship, as one known to, and
held in respect by the people, was the one used.<br>
<br>
"The result of the poll on the following day was, for
non-election, 295; for Mr. Foster, 102; majority for
non-election, 193."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Foster, now Mr. Fitzgerald, recently told the author that
he was not aware of his nomination till the poll had begun.</p>
<p>It must in all fairness be admitted, that the memorialists
make out a very good vindication of the course which was
taken.</p>
<p>Mr. La Trobe, however, in a letter of August 10th, forwarding
the memorial to the Colonial Secretary at Sydney, speaks of the
non-election of members for the district as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"Both injudicious in itself, and unjust towards the
large body of electors . . .<br>
<br>
"As to the results of the city election, although, on the day of
nomination, the great body of the electors may have been
unprepared for the step taken at the meeting, the election in
question has become the deliberate act of the majority by the
result of the subsequent poll.<br>
<br>
"I cannot bring myself under any course of reasoning, however
much disposed otherwise to respect individuals who have assisted
in bringing about this result, or have yielded, under one impulse
or other, to the movement, to consider this so-called 'election'
in any other light than improper, impolitic and absurd.<br>
<br>
"With reference to the document now forwarded, and the statements
it contains, I may be allowed to observe, that the longer that
act of separation from New South Wales, which has been so long an
object of desire of the inhabitants of Port Phillip, and the hope
which has now been for some time officially held out, is delayed,
the more difficult will the task of governing become, and that in
the present state of the public mind, in as far as it can be
supposed to be represented and influenced by those who are
forward in every political movement, the less disposed will the
people be found to do justice to themselves or the Government
placed over them. Every subject and every matter of interest,
past and present, will continue to be received through a partial,
if not through a false and distorted, medium."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. La Trobe concludes by expressing the opinion that the
proceedings to which he refers, as well as other considerations,
demonstrate that "for some years to come at least," the only form
of government suitable for the proposed new Colony will be "a
Governor, Executive and Nominee Council."</p>
<p>Governor FitzRoy&mdash;in forwarding, on September 23rd, to
Earl Grey Mr. La Trobe's despatch and the memorial says, "Mr. La
Trobe's remarks respecting this memorial, and the extraordinary
course pursued by the electors on the occasion referred to,
appear to me to be so clear and judicious, that I feel it
unnecessary to do more than express my entire concurrence with
them, and particularly with the concluding portion, which throws
a doubt on the expedience in uniting Port Phillip into a separate
Colony, of granting it a representative Legislature."</p>
<p>On December 4th, 1848, Governor FitzRoy informs Lord Grey of
the result of the new elections for Port Phillip, which had taken
place in the consequence of the non-return of members at the
general election. Geelong, instead of Melbourne, had been made
the head polling-place. The Governor expresses satisfaction that
the second attempt to elect candidates, who could not take their
seats, had failed, and strongly censures those who had made it.
In a letter to Mr. La Trobe from Mr. Pohlman, the Returning
Officer, a copy of which is forwarded, that gentleman
says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I enclose for your Honour's information an abstract
showing the mode in which the electors voted."<br>
<br>
"Abstract of the general state of the Poll at the close of the
election, for the return of Five members to serve in the
Legislative Council of New South Wales for the electoral district
of Port Phillip, as made up from the voting papers kept at the
several Polling Places within the said
District:&mdash;</blockquote>

<h4>PORT PHILLIP FROM ITS COLONIZATION TO ITS SEPARATION FROM NEW

<p>S<small>OME</small> particulars respecting the Colony during
this transition period of its history, must be noticed, before we
speak of the success of the separation movement. A question of no
less importance than the curtailment of the territory, which is
the smallest on the Australian mainland, was at one time a
subject of serious consideration. The proposal was made in the
interest of South Australia.</p>
<p>The Governor of that Colony, now Sir George Grey, Premier of
New Zealand, in a despatch of Sept. 30th, 1844, submitted to Lord
Stanley that the boundary of South Australia and New South Wales
should be rectified, so as to correspond more nearly with the
natural features of the country.</p>
<p>The Secretary of State * on May 28th, 1845, remitted the
consideration of the question to the government in Sydney, and
Sir George Gipps communicated the result to the Secretary of
State in a despatch of April 29th, 1846. Governor Grey's proposal
was, to make the Glenelg and Wimmera, with a line drawn from Lake
Hindmarsh to the junction of the Darling with the Murray, the new
boundary. Copies of two letters accompany the despatch of
Governor Gipps,&mdash;both advocating rectification in the
opposite direction to that proposed, namely, the extension of the
western boundary of New South Wales to the Murray&mdash;the one
from Sir Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General, and the other from
Mr. La Trobe. Both are able, that of the Superintendent of Port
Phillip is particularly so, and contains some interesting facts
respecting the colonization of the territory. Its date is
December 22nd, 1845. Mr. La Trobe says that Governor Grey's
proposal "does not remedy existing difficulties and only
partially substitutes clear natural boundaries for that which is
so manifestly objectionable. "He points out that this is
particularly so to the north of Lake Hindmarsh, remarking
that,&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* This and the documents relating to the
consideration of the question by the Sydney Government are in the
printed Parliamentary Papers of 1850, in the Record Office,
already referred to.]</p>
<blockquote>"The geographical position of this Lake like the
correct course of the river just named, is merely conjectural;
but it is considered to lie about seventy miles north west by
north from Mount Zero, and consequently that it is well to the
East of the 141&deg; Meridian.<br>
<br>
"Stations have now been established to within thirty and forty
miles of its southern shore. It is supposed to be about sixteen
miles across.<br>
<br>
"A stream which may be considered the continuation of the
Wimmera, emerges from the northern shore, taking a course due
north towards the Murray, which is conjectured to be still about
170 or 200 miles distant."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. La Trobe further contends that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The examination that the tract of country lying
within the 141 and 142 degrees of east longitude and to the south
of the Murray has been subjected to since Governor Grey's
despatch to the Secretary of State was written, has shown that
although the strip of country in that parallel which he would
take from the Port Phillip District and add to South Australia
may not be of very great value when compared with the abundant
and wide-extended pastures to the eastward, yet it is worth
something, and admits of occupation for pastoral purposes to a
certain extent. The fact is, that it has not only long been fully
occupied by the settlers of my district and along the course of
the streams, with great advantage, but the Mount Gambler country
beyond, within the province of South Australia, and much of the
available country to the north, has been gradually explored and
occupied by the settlers from the Port Phillip
district&mdash;with which the lines of communication are
tolerably clear and open, while those to the westward which
connect it with the settled districts of South Australia have
been, until recently, held almost impassable, from the character
of the intervening desert country which separates them from the
river Murray to the north-west, or from the impenetrable scrub
which occupies the great bend of the same river to the northward.
In fact, from my personal knowledge of the country, and the
information I receive, even up to this date it would appear that
two-thirds of the stations in that quarter, whether on the one
side or the other of the 141&deg; of east longitude, are offsets
from stations in the Port Phillip District; and as the proposed
plan would go to take from the southern or Port Phillip District
a portion of useful territory, without any just equivalent, I at
least must dispute the justice of His Excellency's scheme, in
that view, if in no other.<br>
<br>
"Still, considering, that it is advisable to adopt a natural
boundary, if possible between South Australia and the Southern
district, I beg to express my full concurrence with the view
taken by the Surveyor General of New South Wales. If such natural
boundary or boundaries are to be determined upon it will surely
be held advisable to fix upon one which from its decided and
continued character would be what it pretends to be&mdash;will
admit of no dispute, require no immediate survey, strike every
eye as the natural and proper division between the two colonies;
and give to the Port Phillip District the tract of country which
falls more naturally to it&mdash;as the manner in which it has
been principally occupied, proves than to the adjacent
colony&mdash;such a boundary would be the river Murray from its
junction with the Darling to its mouth."</blockquote>
<p>Though there can be no question as to the most natural
boundary, the decision of the New South Wales Executive Council,
as given in an extract from the Minutes of April 1st, 1846, seems
strictly equitable and the only one which could well have been
arrived at, considering the circumstances of the respective
colonies. The conclusion of the Council was that,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"The natural boundaries recommended by Governor Grey
were not distinct or perfect enough to justify so large a
concession of country on the part of New South Wales as their
adoption would require.<br>
<br>
"The course of the Murray suggested by the Surveyor-General of
New South Wales, and the Superintendent of Port Phillip as an
amendment on Governor Grey's proposal was not open to any
objection on the score of indistinctness; but seeing that the
adoption of that boundary would not only deprive South Australia
of a very large tract of seaboard country, but would also leave
the capital of that colony within the distance of forty miles
from its border, the Council could not in justice support that
suggestion.<br>
<br>
"Being unable to recommend either of the boundaries proposed, the
Council advised an adherence to the 141st degree of east
longitude."</blockquote>
<p>It was also recommended that the respective limits should be
clearly ascertained by a commission to be appointed by the
Crown.</p>
<p>Governor Sir Charles FitzRoy writes to the Secretary of State,
January 8th, 1848, that the measurement of the boundary had been
successfully conducted by Mr. Surveyor Wade, "as far as the 36th
degree of latitude. being a total distance from the sea of
upwards of 123 miles.</p>
<p>"Here he was unfortunately compelled to abandon the further
marking of the line until another opportunity, in consequence of
the impossibility of obtaining supplies for his party;" but the
object had "for all practical purposes been effected, as there is
reason to suppose that the scrub in which the survey has for the
present terminated extends to the Murray."</p>
<p>A proclamation of the Governor of South Australia, published
in the Government Gazette of that colony, adopting this boundary
accompanies the despatch.</p>
<p>It is impossible in these pages to enter into the discussion
of political questions, but the importance of some of them
requires that they should not altogether be omitted from mention.
One of the most prominent of these has undoubtedly been the Land
Question. It will, therefore, be desirable briefly to relate how
the protracted controversy upon that question had its origin in
Victoria. It arose from the fact that, at a time when the
squatters were the only great producing class, upon whom the
Australian colonies depended, it was deemed expedient to give
them some fixed tenure, and greater facilities for purchasing the
Crown lands which they held and for which no extensive demand
seemed likely to arise.</p>
<p>The New South Wales Government Gazette, of Oct 5th, 1847,
contains the famous Orders of the Queen in Council of March 9th,
for regulating the sale and occupation of Crown lands in New
South Wales. These orders have probably given rise to a greater
amount of political discussion than any other measure connected
with the Australian colonies. They provided that for the purposes
contemplated. New South Wales should be divided into three
districts&mdash;"the settled, the intermediate, and the unsettled
districts."</p>
<p>The first-named was, in Port Phillip, to comprehend all lands
within twenty-five miles of Melbourne, fifteen of Geelong, ten of
Portland and Alberton, three of any point of the sea, and two
from the banks of the Glenelg as far as a point, to be fixed by
the Governor, not lower than the junction of the Crawford nor
higher than the Wannon.</p>
<p>The intermediate district was to include the whole of the
counties Bourke, Grant, and Normanby and of the Gippsland
district not included in the settled district.</p>
<p>The unsettled district was to consist of all lands of the
colony not within either of the others. The Governor was
empowered to grant leases in it, for pastoral purposes, "for any
term of years not exceeding fourteen." During that tenure the
land on any run was only to be saleable to the occupant, and at
its expiration it might be put up at a price to be fixed by
valuation, at which the occupier should be entitled to purchase
it; but on his declining to do so, it should be offered to the
public at that price plus the value of any improvements he might
have made upon the land. If none of the run or less than
one-fourth, were thus sold, the squatter should be entitled to a
renewal of his lease.</p>
<p>In the intermediate district the regulations were the same,
except that the leases were to be only for eight years and the
Governor might on the expiration of each year, by giving sixty
days' notice, put up any of the land&mdash;the lessee having the
same right of pre-emption provided for on the sale of lands in
the unsettled district at the expiration of the leases. Extensive
powers were, however, reserved to the Governor, notwithstanding
the leases, of entering upon the runs for purposes of selling,
granting, or otherwise disposing of any lands for numerous public
purposes specified, "or for otherwise facilitating the
improvement and settlement of the colony."</p>
<p>In the settled district leases were to be granted only for one
year at a time, and provision was made for owners of purchased
land being allowed free pasturage over adjacent Crown lands.</p>
<p>It was provided that the lessees should only be permitted to
cultivate land for their own use, and provision was made for
estimating the amount of rent to be paid; and the Colonial
Legislature was empowered to put assessment upon stock.</p>
<p>The New South Wales Government Gazette of Dec. 30th, 1848,
contains the proclamation&mdash;in accordance with Her Majesty's
Letters Patent of Feb. 20th, 1846&mdash;of thirty-one new
counties, with a description of their areas and limits; of these
the following are in Victoria,&mdash;Follet, Dundas, Villiers,
Ripon, Hampden, Heytesbury, Polwarth, Grenville, Talbot,
Dalhouse, Anglesey, Evelyn, and Mornington. The object of this
step was to facilitate the carrying out of the Orders in
Council.</p>
<p>But these not having been put in force at the time of the gold
discovery, were set aside&mdash;the Government in response to the
cry "Unlock the lands" putting them up to public auction in all
parts of Victoria. The squatters were only allowed the right of
pre-emption, at &pound;1 an acre, over 640 acres on which their
homesteads were situated. This policy respecting the land
received the sanction of the Duke of Newcastle. Had the Orders in
Council been in force&mdash;and their terms would imply that it
was optional with the Governor to proclaim them&mdash;a nice
legal question might have arisen whether the proviso for
"facilitating the improvement and settlement of the colony" was
sufficient to have authorized the Governor in throwing open the
lands to sale by public auction. By this system alone were all
lands sold for some years after the gold discovery.</p>
<p>The squatters' tenure&mdash;though they were the wealthiest
class in New South Walesa-did not entitle them to vote for the
Legislative Council; but on Feb. 23rd, 1849, we find Mr. La Trobe
forwarding a petition from "the lessees of land in Port Phillip,"
adopted at a public meeting at Geelong, on the 26th of the same
month, praying that the elective franchise might be conferred
upon them. It was stated, among other things, that the existing
suffrage, being "restricted to householders of &pound;20 per
annum, and to freeholders to the value of &pound;200 . . . has
excluded a large body of the tenant farmers, and the whole of the
pastoral interest."</p>
<p>It was pointed out that "the principal wealth of Port Phillip
consists in its flocks and herds, comprising respectively about
5,000,000 of sheep, and 500,000 head of cattle; that nearly all
the exports of the colony are produced by the graziers; the total
amount of colonial produce exported in 1847 (the last official
return) being &pound;652,122, of which &pound;647,579 was
produced by the pastoral population."</p>
<p>The writer may perhaps mention the distinct recollection,
impressed on his juvenile memory, of his father starting, on a
very hot summer morning, to attend the meeting in question.</p>
<p>Attention appears to have been first called to the defences of
Melbourne by a despatch from Governor Gipps to Mr. Gladstone of
June 20th, 1846&mdash;enclosing a copy of a memorial, forwarded
by Mr. La Trobe, from the Mayor and Town Council of Melbourne,
pointing out the defenceless condition of the Port. It is signed
"J.F. Palmer, Mayor", and states that Melbourne contains 2333
houses, 10,954 inhabitants; exports &pound;400,000 of produce;
imports &pound;100,000 of British merchandise; and that the
military stationed in the town did not exceed fifty-four
persons.</p>
<p>It is now time to give the official particulars respecting the
creation of the Bishopric of Melbourne, and the appointment and
entry upon the sphere of his labours of the excellent Prelate,
who, for more than a quarter of a century laboured with so much
zeal, energy, and faithfulness in planting the Gospel in the new
land. Nothing but pure devotion could, in those days, have
induced a Senior Wrangler to go to such an insignificant place as
our colony then was. Melbourne may always be proud of her first
bishop. It will be well for the colony if the pure and simple
Christianity which he taught take deep root in it. On his
arrival, he found but three Church of England clergymen in the
whole diocese.</p>
<p>On March 28th, 1848, Sir Charles FitzRoy informs Earl Grey,
that he had received his Lordship's despatch ** of August 27th,
1847, containing a copy of letters patent, "reconstituting the
Bishopric of Australia by reducing the same to a See to be styled
the Bishopric of Sydney," and also "erecting three distinct
Bishop's Sees, styled the Bishoprics of Newcastle, Adelaide, and
Melbourne;" and the letters patent of Dr. Tyrrell of Newcastle,
"and the Rev. Charles Perry, D.D., to be ordained and consecrated
Bishops." The Governor also states "that the Lord Bishop of
Melbourne arrived at Melbourne on the 23rd January, and was
installed in the Cathedral Church of St. James on 18th February
last."</p>
<p class="foot">[** The despatches here referred to are in the
Record Office.]</p>
<p>About the same time Dr. Goold became first Roman Catholic
bishop.</p>
<p>It has been the endeavour of the author not to give more
statistics than are absolutely necessary; but to exclude them
altogether would impair the historical value of any work on the
progress of the colony. A few figures showing its position
shortly before separation, will not be found uninteresting.</p>
<p>From the printed abstract of the Census of New South Wales,
taken March 2nd, 1846, and forwarded to the Secretary of State,
it appears that the total population of the whole colony was
189,609&mdash;that of the Port Phillip district being 32,879;
Melbourne numbered 10,954 inhabitants; Geelong with its suburbs
1911; Portland 510; Brighton 509; Richmond 402; Williamstown 322;
Belfast 269; Brunswick 164. These are the only towns in Port
Phillip mentioned in the returns. Geelong is divided into North
Geelong 982; South Geelong 388; Newtown 256; Ashby 150; Irishtown
135.</p>
<p>The total population of Victoria, according to the census
taken on March 2nd, 1851&mdash;just before the separation from
New South Wales, and published in the Victorian Government
Gazette, of Aug. 6th&mdash;was 77,345, of whom 23,143 were in the
police district of Melbourne; 8291 of Geelong; 2342 of Portland;
3846 of Belfast; 2064 of Kilmore; 1673 of Colac; 904 of
Alberton.</p>
<p>The following figures are taken from a memorial of members for
the Port Phillip district, sent by Mr. La Trobe in a despatch ***
of February 11th, 1850, and forwarded by Governor FitzRoy on the
22nd, to the Secretary of State. The returns are dated Audit
Office, New South Wales, August 15th, 1849, and signed "Wm.
Lithgow, Auditor-General."</p>

<br>
<p>The memorial points out that, allowing for its share in
general expenses, common to the whole of New South Wales, a
considerable amount of the revenue of Port Phillip had not been
expended in that district.</p>
<p>Sir G. Gipps sailed for England, July 11th, 1846, and his
successor. Sir Charles FitzRoy, arrived in Sydney, August
2nd.</p>
<p>In a despatch * to the new Governor, of July 1st, 1847, Earl
Grey announces the intention of the Government to introduce a
Bill, in the next Session of Parliament, for the separation of
Port Phillip from New South Wales, and that the new colony was to
receive the name of Victoria; and Sir Charles FitzRoy, in one of
March 27th, 1848, encloses an address from the inhabitants of
Port Phillip, expressing "the liveliest emotions of joy and
gratitude, that it is the determination of your Majesty's
Government to take immediate measures to erect Port Phillip into
a separate colony, to be named after your Most Gracious Majesty,
the Colony of Victoria." Some other name must have been chosen,
had the proposal of a Major Sullivan **&mdash;made in 1842, to
form a British settlement in New Caledonia, to be called the
"Colony of Victoria"&mdash;been carried out.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Printed Parliamentary Papers, 1849.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** In the New South Wales Correspondence, Record
Office.]</p>
<p>At length the long-desired separation was conceded, by the
passing through the Imperial Parliament of "An Act for the better
Government of Her Majesty's Australian Colonies," August 5th,
1850. It provided, in Sect. 1, that "the territories now
comprised within the said District of <i>Port Phillip</i>,
including the <i>Town of Melbourne</i>, and bounded on the North
and North-east by a straight line drawn from <i>Cape How</i> to
the nearest source or the River <i>Murray</i>, and thence by the
course of that river to the Eastern Boundary of the Colony of
<i>South Australia</i>, shall be separated from the Colony of
<i>New South Wales</i>, and shall cease to return members to the
Legislative Council of such colony, and shall be erected into and
thenceforth form a separate colony, to be known and designated
the Colony of <i>Victoria</i>."</p>
<p>It was provided that the number of members of the Victorian
Legislature and the electoral districts, should be determined by
the Governor and Council of New South Wales, also that one-third
of the members should be nominated by the Crown. The voting
qualification required was the possession for six months of a
freehold estate of the clear annual value of &pound;100, or of a
house or leasehold in possession, of the clear annual value of
&pound;10, or a licence to depasture on Crown lands. The
authority of the Governor of New South Wales over Victoria was to
cease from the issue of the writs for the election of the first
Legislative Council of the new Colony. Power was also given to
the Governors and Legislative Councils of New South Wales and
Victoria, to alter the electoral districts and increase the
number of members of the Councils of their respective
colonies&mdash;the number of nominee members to be always in
proportion. The Act provided for the establishment of a Supreme
Court in Victoria, and also empowered the existing non-elective
Legislative Councils in South Australia and Tasmania, to
establish similar Legislatures to those of New South Wales and
Victoria.</p>
<p>In a long despatch, of August 30th, 1850, Earl Grey informs
Sir Charles FitzRoy that this act had become law. His lordship
concludes in these eloquent terms:&mdash;"Her Majesty's
Government have had no other object in view but that of
establishing in the Australian Colonies a system of government
founded on the same principles of well-regulated freedom, under
which the inhabitants of this country have enjoyed so large a
measure of security and prosperity, and under which the British
Empire has risen to so high a pitch of greatness and power. It is
my earnest and confident hope that by this Act of Parliament, the
foundation is laid upon which institutions may gradually be
raised, worthy of the great nation of British origin which seems
destined rapidly to rise up in the Southern hemisphere, and to
spread our race and our language, and carry the power of the
British Crown over the whole of the vast territory of
Australia."</p>
<p>The appointment of the first Governor of Victoria is
communicated to Governor FitzRoy by Earl Grey, who writes,
September 14th, 1850, "I have now to inform you, that having
every reason to be satisfied with the manner in which Mr. La
Trobe has hitherto administered the affairs of the district of
Port Phillip, under the existing arrangement, I have advised Her
Majesty to appoint him the first Lieut.-Governor of the new
Colony of Victoria."</p>
<p>The first despatch,*** doubtless, ever written to a Governor
of Victoria, was that in the Parliamentary Papers, headed
"January, 1851," without a date, addressed by Earl Grey, to
Lieut.-Governor La Trobe, in which he is told, "You will receive
your own commission as Lieut.-Governor through Sir C. FitzRoy;
and in conferring it on you. Her Majesty's Government have great
pleasure in acknowledging the services which you have rendered to
the community of Victoria, during your long and careful
superintendency of its affairs, while constituting a district of
New South Wales."</p>
<p class="foot">[*** This and the two preceding despatches are in
the volume of the New South Wales Correspondence, Record Office,
on the separation of Port Phillip.]</p>
<p>Mr. La Trobe had been Superintendent of Port Phillip during
the long period since 1839. His services had been highly
appreciated by his superiors. He had only been absent from his
post a few months, when&mdash;as Sir Charles FitzRoy informs Mr.
Gladstone, in a despatch of October 24th, 1846&mdash;he had, in
accordance with the Secretary of State's instructions, proceeded
on the 9th of that month, to assume the temporary administration
of the Government of Van Diemen's Land. This was on the death of
the Governor of that colony. Sir Eardley Wilmot. Captain Lonsdale
acted as Superintendent in his absence. Sir Charles takes this
opportunity of speaking in the following high terms of Mr. La
Trobe. "In conclusion, I trust that I may not be considered
presumptuous in saying, that, having obtained a pretty accurate
acquaintance with Mr. La Trobe's character and sterling good
qualities, during a month that he passed in this house soon after
my arrival here, I do not believe that you could have selected a
person more worthy of your confidence or one better adapted to
perform the difficult task which you have assigned to him."</p>
<p>This high testimony no doubt influenced, if it did not
determine, the subsequent selection of a Governor for the new
colony. It would certainly have been a matter of regret, if Mr.
La Trobe&mdash;who had so conscientiously and assiduously
discharged his duties, who had acquired so much experience of
Port Phillip from its early existence, and who was also a man of
no small capacity, as well as of the highest character and of an
estimable disposition&mdash;had not been made first Governor of
Victoria.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> Port Phillip District of New South Wales
had now become the Crown Colony of Victoria. It was impossible
that its local affairs could any longer have been conducted from
a distance of so many hundred miles, even had the means of
communication not been very defective. It was fortunate that the
new Government had been so far constituted&mdash;though its
arrangements were anything but complete&mdash;when required to
meet the unexpected and momentous events with which it had to
grapple, within a few weeks after coming into existence. We shall
now proceed to notice some of the particulars connected with the
organization of the new colony, and with the contemporaneous
discovery of gold.</p>
<p>The first despatch of the first Governor of Victoria is that
of Mr. La Trobe, No. 1, dated July 22nd, 1851,* in which he
informs Earl Grey, among other things, of the receipt of his
commission as Lieutenant-Governor. In another despatch, of the
same date, Mr. La Trobe describes the steps taken to carry out
the separation of the two colonies, which the Imperial Act
provided should date from the issue of the writs for the election
of the Legislature. These, Mr. La Trobe states, were sent out on
July 1st. He was himself sworn in as Lieut.-Governor on the 15th,
as next day were the three members of his Executive Council,
namely, the Principal Law Officer, the Treasurer, and the
Collector of Customs. A supplement to the Victoria Government
<i>Gazette</i>, July 15th, announces the appointments of the
chief officers of the Government, subject to Her Majesty's
approval.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the Record Office, as are the other
despatches, and Victoria Government Gazettes, quoted in this
chapter.]</p>
<p>The principal of these, taken from the complete list given,
were:&mdash;Colonial Secretary, William Lonsdale; Colonial
Treasurer, Alastair Mackenzie; Auditor-General, Chas. Hotson
Ebden; Postmaster-General, Alex. McCrae; Attorney-General,
William Foster Stawell; Solicitor-General, Redmond Barry; Master
in Equity, Robert Williams Pohlman; Surveyor-General, Robert
Hoddle; Sheriff, James Simpson; Crown Solicitor, Henry Field
Gurner. In this list also appears, among non-political officials,
the name of a future English Cabinet Minister, "Hugh Culling
Eardley Childers."</p>
<p>Captain Lonsdale&mdash;who was the earliest ruler of the Port
Phillip settlement on its legal establishment, and had in the
interval worthily discharged the office of Treasurer&mdash;became
Colonial Secretary, accepting the office only provisionally after
some hesitation.</p>
<p>The particulars of the installation of the Governor and the
names of the gentlemen attending his first levee, are given in
the <i>Argus</i> of July 16th.</p>
<p>On August 2nd Mr. La Trobe writes, that steps are being taken
for the election of the twenty members of the Legislative
Council, for which the writs would be returnable October 1st.</p>
<p>Numerous loyal addresses, on the occasion, appear in the
Victoria Government <i>Gazette</i>&mdash;that of the Mayor and
Corporation of Melbourne leading off, with expressions of
"attachment to the institutions of the British Empire."</p>
<p>The following return to the writs for the election of the
representative members of the first Legislative Council of the
colony, were published in the Government <i>Gazette</i> of
October 29th:&mdash;</p>

<p>On December 3rd, Mr. La Trobe informs Earl Grey of the meeting
of the Legislative Council, November 11th, and in a second
despatch of the same date, of his consent to the selection of
"James Frederick Palmer, Esq., as Speaker of the House."</p>
<p>The Governor, also under the same date, encloses a financial
statement which he had laid before the Council, showing that the
revenue of Victoria (exclusive of territorial revenue) had been
for 1850, &pound;122,781; for 1851 to October 31st,
&pound;118,268 5<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. and it was anticipated that
it would reach &pound;143,268 5<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>. for that
year; and for 1852, &pound;175,350, to meet an expenditure of
&pound;173,063 18<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>The Legislature was prorogued from January 6th to February
10th, 1852.</p>
<p>We have already noted the entry into public life of a
gentleman who was to become a member of the English Cabinet; that
of one who was to be his colleague, in the same Cabinet, has now
to be recorded.</p>
<p>In a despatch of October 22nd, 1852, Mr. La Trobe announces
that he has nominated&mdash;and asks that the appointment may be
confirmed&mdash;"Hugh Culling Eardley Childers to be
Auditor-General of this Colony, in the room of Charles Hotson
Ebden, Esq., resigned." On December 14th, 1853, Mr. La Trobe
notifies the appointment of Mr. Childers as Collector of Customs,
in the place of Mr. Cassells, deceased.</p>
<p>Sir William A'Beckett, who had been some years resident-judge
in Port Phillip of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, was
first judge of Victoria; and on the appointment, shortly after
separation, of the Solicitor-General, Mr. Barry, as a puisne
judge. Sir William became Chief Justice.</p>
<p>Mr. La Trobe acknowledges, on July 20th, 1853, the Duke of
Newcastle's despatch of March 19th, informing him of the
appointment of Mr. John F. Leslie Foster as Colonial Secretary of
Victoria, and reports that that gentleman had arrived and entered
upon the duties of his office. Mr. Foster, as we have seen, had
represented the Port Phillip District in the Legislative Council
of New South Wales, and it was he who contested Melbourne with
Earl Grey when that nobleman was elected. Captain Lonsdale
resumed his position as Colonial Treasurer on Mr. Foster becoming
Colonial Secretary.</p>
<p>In a despatch of July 27th, 1853, Mr. La Trobe, in compliance
with the request of the Secretary of State, gives the following
list of the elective members of the Legislative Council at that
date. Their number had been increased since the general
election&mdash;the new seats having been filled up just before
the despatch was written:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first official announcement of the great fact of the
discovery of gold in Victoria is thus communicated to Earl Grey
by Mr. La Trobe:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="right">"<i>Melbourne</i>, 25<i>th
August</i>, 1851.   </p>
<blockquote>"<small>MY LORD</small>,&mdash;It is my duty, however
briefly, to report to Her Majesty's Government that the discovery
of large deposits of gold within the Colony of N.S. Wales, in May
last, has been followed, within the last six weeks, by undoubted
proof being adduced of the extension of the gold-field to this
Colony.<br>
<br>
"At this time, I am officially made aware of three distinct
localities, where considerable numbers of persons have
congregated for the purpose of obtaining the precious
metal.***</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[*** In margin, "Clunes, Upper Loddon, Buninyong,
Deep Creek, a tributary of the Yarra Yarra River."]</p>
<blockquote>"2. It is true the result has been, as far as I can
ascertain, but moderate; but quite of sufficient importance to
justify the issue, with the concurrence of my Executive Council
of a Proclamation, declaring the rights of the Crown, in respect
of the gold found in its natural place of deposit, within the
Colony of Victoria; and further the promulgation of Regulations
to ensure order and legalize the search, under similar conditions
as those prescribed by Sir Chas. FitzRoy in New South Wales,
previous to the separation of the Colonies. They will commence to
take effect on the 1st of September.<br>
<br>
"3. The gold at 'Clunes Diggings' is found in an alluvial
composed in a great measure of the decomposed quartz rock, which
constituted the original matrix. The specimens I have seen from
the workings at Buninyong are all embedded in compact quartz.
Those from the Deep Creek, which is only 16 miles from Melbourne,
show themselves in grains in contact with a slaty rock.<br>
<br>
"4. I have little doubt, viewing the similarity of the geological
structure of a great portion of Victoria to that of the portion
of New South Wales in which the gold deposits are shown to exist,
but that it will be found very widely extended in Victoria
also.<br>
<br>
"It is certain that, between two and three years ago, specimens
of far greater richness than any latterly produced, were
exhibited as found in the District of the Pyrenees, and were most
undoubtedly from that part of the country. Circumstances,
however, prevented the discovery from being followed up.<br>
<br>
"5. It will be my duty to take the earliest opportunity of
reporting further to your Lordship upon the subject. I have,
&amp;c."</blockquote>
<p>The Proclamation, dated August 15th, in the <i>Gazette</i> of
the 16th, declared that all persons taking gold from the soil or
digging for it should be prosecuted, unless authorized to do so,
but that regulations for the issue of licences for the purpose
would be speedily published.</p>
<p>In his next despatch on the subject of the gold discoveries,
dated October 10th, 1851, which is of considerable length, Mr. La
Trobe thus first mentions the opening of Ballarat. The Governor,
among other things, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"However, early in September I obtained conclusive
information that a very considerable amount of gold began to find
its way into the towns from the vicinity of Buninyong. It was
ascertained, that the original workings near the township had
been abandoned, on the discovery of another locality producing
the precious metal in far greater abundance in the valley of the
River Leigh, about seven miles to the Northward and that a very
large conflux of adventurers was pouring into the District. . . .
.<br>
<br>
"On Monday last the 6th inst. 1800 licences had been issued for
the current month. . . . .<br>
<br>
"A personal visit and inspection of the ground, from which I
returned a few days ago, has been of great use to me, in forming
a judgment of the real state of the case.<br>
<br>
"The locality now known by the name of the 'Ballarat Diggings'
lies about six miles in a direct line from the remarkable
volcanic hill still known by the native name of
'Buninyong.'"</blockquote>
<p>Mr. La Trobe enters into a description of the locality, mining
operations, and yield, speaks of "Golden Point", and states that
at the time of his visit "there were between 400 and 500 cradles
on the stream irrespective of other expedients for washing the
ore, and probably no less than 2500 persons, either working or
making their preparatory arrangements, while the arrivals were
computed at 100 daily; and one or two thousand were known to be
on the roads from Melbourne and Geelong."</p>
<p>In another despatch, of October 30th, Mr. La Trobe continues
his able and graphic description of the development of the gold
discoveries&mdash;which, at Ballarat, had already reached the
first pitch of success, and were losing their early
attractiveness. 2246 licences had been issued during the month.
The conduct of the miners is thus commended: "The official
reports I have received show that as great a degree of good order
continues to prevail amongst the large number congregated at
Ballarat as could possibly be looked for, under the extraordinary
circumstances which have brought the adventurers together."</p>
<p>This despatch goes on to describe the opening of the second
great Victorian gold-field. The Governor says,&mdash;"The
workings, which I stated in my previous despatch had commenced
near Mount Alexander . . . have, within the past fortnight
unexpectedly been attended by results which have drawn aside for
the moment the public attention which had been almost solely
absorbed by Ballarat, and directed a strong current of
adventurers in that direction, both from Melbourne and its
vicinity and from the Buninyong District itself."</p>
<p>Mr. La Trobe&mdash;who thoroughly acquainted himself with all
parts of the territory under his government by personal visits,
and who had a keen appreciation of its best scenery&mdash;soon
made his appearance at Mount Alexander, as he had done at
Ballarat. He says,&mdash;"Having received timely and correct
information of the state of matters at the new ground, I have
made it a point to pay an early visit to it." He states that the
search for gold in this quarter "originated in a small piece
combined with quartz being picked up by a shepherd on his folding
ground;" and that "although the certain intelligence could only
have been spread a few days previous, I found on my arrival on
the ground that there were upwards of 250 men on the spot." Mr.
La Trobe mentions that on his return to Melbourne he "found the
whole population again under renewed excitement in consequence of
the reports from these workings."</p>
<p>In a despatch of December 3rd, 1851, we have a further
account, from the descriptive pen of Mr. La Trobe, of the
progress of the gold-fields. He thus estimates the results up to
that time,&mdash;"Great as the excitement was in the case of
Ballarat workings, there can be no doubt but that which now
pervades the community is far more general, and threatens to be
far more lasting in its character and serious in its results. I
have no reason to believe that at any time there may have been
more than 6000 people congregated in the country about Ballarat.
There can be no doubt, I think, that in the area of fifteen miles
square, in the neighbourhood of Mount Alexander, there are at
this time above double that number." It is also stated that the
miners at Ballarat are "now reduced to about 1600 steady
workers."</p>
<p>In the three despatches referred to and also in one of January
12th, 1852, Mr. La Trobe describes the extraordinary effects upon
all classes of the community, upon all interests, industries, and
callings, of the excitement of the gold fever; people were
abandoning every position to seek their fortunes at the
diggings&mdash;the civil service losing its officers, "the
resignation of by far the greater majority of the constabulary
turnkeys, &amp;c.," having been received. The author and many of
his readers can never forget the period in question. Mr. La Trobe
also points out the difficulties of carrying on his new
government, which had not been fully set in operation when this
immense revolution arose, to put it to the severest of tests. A
magic spell seemed upon the young colony, in the interval between
the issuing of the writs for the election and the meeting of its
first Legislature; for when that Assembly was opened the whole
aspect of affairs was completely changed. Few men ever occupied a
more trying position than that of Mr. La Trobe, when suddenly
placed in such unprecedented circumstances; and whilst we cannot
enter into the merits of political questions or approve of some
of his measures, justice to the memory of that worthy man
requires that it should be said, that he acquitted himself well,
that he displayed much ability, and perhaps made as few mistakes
as any tried statesman might have committed if occupying his
position.</p>
<p>On July 21st, 1858, Mr. La Trobe acknowledges the acceptance
of his resignation, and thanks the Duke of Newcastle for the
terms in which he had received it. In a despatch of May 5th,
1854, Mr. La Trobe informs the Secretary of State of his
approaching departure for England, and on the 8th Mr. Foster, the
Colonial Secretary, announces that he had entered upon the
position of Acting Governor in the place of Mr. La Trobe, who had
left on the 5th, in the <i>Golden Age</i>.</p>
<p>Thus terminated Mr. La Trobe's long official connexion with
Victoria, which had existed since October, 1839. Many rulers have
seen vast political changes affect the countries over which they
have presided, but few have witnessed such a transformation as
that which developed the little settlement of which Mr. La Trobe
became chief in 1839, into the great Colony, the governorship of
which he gave up in 1854. He did not again enter public life. His
sight failed him some years before his death, which took place in
this country, December 4th, 1875, at the age of seventy-four.</p>
<p>In a despatch, of June 26th, 1854, Sir Charles Hotham informs
the Duke of Newcastle of his arrival on the 21st. Next day the
new Governor landed and was sworn in. He describes the cordial
reception he received, and the warm-hearted loyalty of the
people.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council had raised the salary of the Governor
to fifteen thousand a year. This was done in the hope that the
Governor of Victoria might be made Governor-General of Australia;
for it would have been anomalous that a Provincial Governor
should have a much higher income. The Colonial Office, however,
got over the difficulty by abolishing the title of
Governor-General of Australia on the first vacancy in the
governorship of New South Wales. Melbourne was, however, made
head-quarters of the troops in Australia'.</p>
<p>In a despatch to Sir George Grey, Secretary of State, dated
November 18th, 1854, Sir Charles Hotham reports the burning by
the populace of the Eureka Hotel at Ballarat, in consequence of a
murder in which the landlord was supposed to have been
implicated. This was the commencement of the disturbances,
which&mdash;having for their chief irritating cause the obnoxious
licence regulations&mdash;at length culminated in the collision
of December 3rd, between the authorities and the
diggers&mdash;the one solitary exception to the peaceful tenor of
Victorian history. The details of the riots and of their
suppression&mdash;by the taking of the Eureka Stockade, in which
the rioters had entrenched themselves&mdash;are given in a
despatch, with enclosures of Sir Charles Hotham, dated December
20th. The stockade was attacked by Captain Thomas of the 40th
Regiment, early on the morning of December 3rd, and taken, some
of the insurgents having been killed and wounded and more than a
hundred made prisoners. There was a loss on the part of the
military of three privates; and subsequently Captain Wise, of the
40th, and Lieut. Paull, of the 12th, died from the effects of
wounds received in the encounter.</p>
<p>A commission was appointed to report upon the government of
the gold-fields. The grievance of which the diggers complained,
the licence, was removed, and the revenue made up for the loss by
an export duty on gold. It was not so much the fee for the
licence, thirty shillings a month, which was the source of
objection&mdash;although it pressed unfairly upon the
unsuccessful gold digger&mdash;as the interference with the
liberty of the subject, which was involved in every man on the
gold-fields being always liable to be called upon by the police,
whose duty it was to inquire for licences. Whoever did not happen
to have one in his pocket might, at any time, have been taken
away from his work to produce his licence or to answer before the
gold Commissioner for not having one.</p>
<p>Under date December 14th, 1854, Sir Charles Hotham advises Sir
Geo. Grey, of the resignation, on the 5th&mdash;two days after
the encounter at Ballarat&mdash;of Mr. Foster, Colonial
Secretary, and of the nomination in his place of Mr. William
Clarke Haines, member of the Legislative Council for the County
Grant. The resignation of Mr. Foster was undoubtedly a concession
to the popular feeling at the moment; but it would be unfair to
infer from it that that gentleman was mainly responsible for the
administration of the gold-fields which led up to the
disturbances. The question how far he and his colleagues, as well
as Governor Hotham, should share that responsibility, has been
the subject of a very extensive controversy, upon which it would
be impossible to enter and improper to pronounce a judgment in
these pages. In 1867, a committee of the Victorian Assembly
reported upon the question in Mr. Fitzgerald's favour.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to describe, or even to name, the
numerous works and institutions which had their origin in
Victoria before the period at which this work terminates. It may
be safely said, however, that in no part of the world has more
been done for the instruction and education of the inhabitants.
The provincial newspapers, libraries, and literary institutions,
appear in far greater proportion to those of the mother country,
and probably of any other community. It need scarcely be said
that Melbourne and its suburbs are as amply provided with a press
and institutions. The old Crown Colony Legislative Council of
Victoria, as well as the Parliament established by the new
constitution, have been always most liberal in providing for the
literary wants of the colony.</p>
<p>In a few months after separation from New South Wales, the
Melbourne University was incorporated by Act of the Legislative
Council, which became law on January 22nd, 1853; its Council, was
appointed in the following April; the foundation of the buildings
laid in August 1854; and they were opened October 1855, although
the University had already begun operations. Royal Letters Patent
recognizing the degrees of the University were granted in 1859,
and the Senate appointed in 1867. The Act of the Legislature
incorporating the University, conferred upon it an endowment of
9000<i>l</i>. a year. The first Chancellor was Sir Redmond Barry,
who still holds the office. The Legislative Council also provided
for the formation of the Melbourne Public Library, at the same
time that it determined upon the establishment of the
University.</p>
<p>It would be neither possible nor desirable, to do more than
mention some of the leading political questions which have arisen
in Victoria. The rise of the land question has already been
referred to, so have the measures connected with the organization
of the territory, upon its first settlement, and also upon its
separation from New South Wales. The introduction of
Constitutional Government has yet to be spoken of. But before
coming to it, something must be said about the question of
transportation, which for some time caused considerable
excitement in all the Australian colonies. This has been the only
question which ever caused any serious difference between those
colonies and the mother country; and there is no reason why it
should not continue as the solitary exception to the rule of
harmony which distinguishes their relations.</p>
<p>Neither before nor after separation was there transportation
to any part of Victoria; but the attractions of gold drew to her
territory, from New South Wales and Tasmania, many convicts on
the expiration of their terms of punishment. The question of
continuing transportation, therefore, affected Victoria as much
as any of the other colonies. Convicts had not been sent to New
South Wales for some years before separation; but they continued
to be received in Tasmania till 1853, after the gold discovery.
Victoria, being so much interested in the question, took a
leading part in the agitation which resulted in transportation to
the neighbouring colony being finally stopped in that year. In
order also to prevent our colony from being infested, as it must
otherwise have been for some years, with prisoners as they came
out of the penal establishments of Tasmania, the Legislative
Council passed the "Convicts Prevention Act of 1852. This measure
was directed against the conditional pardons granted by the
Governor of Tasmania, which rendered convicts free to go wherever
they pleased, except back to England. Numbers of them availed
themselves of the privilege to cross over to the gold-fields of
Victoria, where they contributed largely to augment the amount of
crime, which, but for their presence, would have been remarkably
small. It was provided that any convict who should arrive in
Victoria until three years had elapsed from the date of his
pardon or the expiration of his sentence, should be liable to
imprisonment for two years, or to be sent back to Tasmania; and
the onus of proving themselves free rested on all persons coming
from that colony. The Governor having reserved the Act for
sanction in England&mdash;it continuing in the mean time in force
in Victoria&mdash;the Royal Assent was refused, on the ground
that the Act was an interference with the prerogative of mercy.
On the news of its rejection reaching the colony, the Council
immediately passed it a second time, and on being again sent to
England it was allowed. By the united action of all the other
Australian colonies, transportation to Western Australia was also
subsequently abolished by the Imperial Government.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council of Victoria, was also obliged to adopt
stringent measures to protect the colony against another
inundation of objectionable intruders. The Chinese were at one
time arriving in such numbers, as to afford serious ground for
alarm lest they should either outnumber the British population,
or form an undesirably large minority of the inhabitants of the
colony. An Act was, therefore, passed imposing a capitation tax
of 10<i>l</i>. a head on every Chinaman coming into the colony,
and a fine of 100<i>l</i>. on the captain of any ship bringing
more than one Celestial to every ten tons of cargo. The Act
having served its purpose, was subsequently repealed.</p>
<p>It now remains for us to see our colony completely freed from
the leading strings of irresponsible, Crown-Colony rule, and
invested with the full powers of Constitutional self-government.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies in the first Ministry of
the late Earl Derby, Sir John Pakington, now Lord
Hampton&mdash;in a circular despatch of December 15th, 1852, to
the Governors of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and
Tasmania&mdash;invited the Legislative Councils of these colonies
to exercise the powers, with which they were invested by Imperial
Statute 13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 59, and frame new Constitutions for
their respective colonies. After considerable discussion the
Victorian Act passed the Legislative Council March 24th, 1854,
and was transmitted to England on the following day along with a
despatch from Governor La Trobe.</p>
<p>The Constitution Act of Victoria, the 18 &amp; 19 Vict., c. 55
in the Imperial Statute Book, received the Royal Assent July
16th, 1855&mdash;no substantial change having been made in the
measure as passed by the Legislative Council. It established two
Houses of Parliament&mdash;the Upper retaining the name of the
Old Legislature and the Lower to be called the Legislative
Assembly. The Legislative Council is to consist of thirty
members, five to be elected by each of the six Provinces, into
which, for the purpose, the colony was divided. The House cannot
be dissolved; but by one member for each Province retiring every
two years, its complete renovation is effected in ten years. Its
members must be thirty years of age and possess freehold estate
worth 5000<i>l</i>. or 500<i>l</i>. a year. The electoral
qualification requires that a man shall have resided a year in
the colony and possess a freehold worth 1000<i>l</i>. or
100<i>l</i>., or a leasehold with a reserved rent of
100<i>l</i>., or of 100<i>l</i>. clear annual value for a term of
five years. The franchise for the Upper House is also conferred
upon graduates of any University in the British Empire,
barristers, solicitors, qualified medical practitioners,
officiating ministers of all denominations, and retired military
and naval officers.</p>
<p>The Act provided that the Legislative Assembly should consist
of sixty members, each with a property qualification of freehold
estate worth 2000<i>l</i>. or 200<i>l</i>. a year. The electoral
qualification was the possession for six months, of freehold
property worth 50<i>l</i>. or 5<i>l</i>. a year, of 10<i>l</i>.
leasehold, or premises of that yearly value, of a licence of
Crown lands for a year or of a salary of 100<i>l</i>. per annum.
The educated classes upon whom the suffrage for the Council is
conferred are also entitled to vote for the Assembly. The
duration of the Assembly was fixed at five years.</p>
<p>It was also provided that no responsible ministry can meet the
Assembly unless four of its members are returned to it.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See the author's paper on the Constitutions of
the Australian Colonies, Proceedings of the Royal Colonial
Institute, Session 1869-70.]</p>
<p>The alterations in the new Constitution, though made after the
period beyond which this work is not intended to go, may with
advantage be briefly mentioned. In the first Session of the first
Parliament under this Constitution, the liberal franchise for the
Assembly&mdash;which was within the reach of every one with the
least industry to acquire and steadiness to save&mdash;was
extended to all men of twenty-one years of age, who shall be
registered in the electoral districts in which they reside; and
the property qualification of members was abolished. Subsequently
the number of members and electoral districts have been more than
once increased and altered; and the qualifications for both
members and electors of the Council have been reduced one half.
Payment of members has also been in force for some time, and has
been the cause of the recent dead-lock between the two Houses.
The Assembly is now elected for only three years.</p>
<p>In a special issue of the Government <i>Gazette</i>, of
November 23rd, 1855, Sir Chas. Hotham proclaimed the New
Constitution, which the Act provided should be proclaimed by the
Governor within a month of the receipt by him of a copy of the
statute. The operative part of the proclamation runs as
follows:&mdash;"And whereas I, Sir Charles Hotham,
Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the said colony of
Victoria, did at ten of the clock, post meridian, on the
twenty-third day of October, in the present year, receive from
Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies a
copy of the said Act and Order in Council appended hereto,
declaring Her Majesty's Assent to the said reserved Bill so
amended as aforesaid. Now, therefore, I, Sir Charles Hotham,
Captain-General and Commander-in-Chief of the said Colony of
Victoria, do by this Proclamation proclaim the said Act of
Parliament,** and the said reserved Bill so assented to as
aforesaid, and do hereby notify and declare the said Act of
Parliament, and the said Bill so assented to, to be proclaimed
accordingly."</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Constitution Act passed by the
Legislative Council, and the Act of the Imperial Parliament
enabling her Majesty to assent to it.]</p>
<p>The Proclamation is countersigned "William C. Haines."</p>
<p>The <i>Gazette</i> of November 28th, 1855, announces the
appointment of the first responsible ministry of Victoria, all
the gentlemen nominated having, as appears, with two exceptions,
previously held the same offices. Mr. Molesworth had been acting
Solicitor-General. By the Constitution Act they became entitled
to pensions of 800<i>l</i>. on being deprived, on political
grounds, of their offices, the tenure of which had previously
been permanent. The names and offices specified
were,&mdash;"William Clarke Haines, Esquire, Chief Secretary of
Victoria; William Foster Stawell, Esquire, Attorney-General of
the said Colony; Charles Sladen, Esquire, Treasurer of the said
Colony, <i>vice</i> William Lonsdale, Esquire, released from
office on political grounds; Charles Pasley, Esquire,
Commissioner of Public Works of the said Colony; Hugh Culling
Eardley Childers, Esquire, Commissioner of Trade and Customs of
the said Colony; Andrew Clarke, Esquire, Surveyor-General of the
said Colony; Robert Molesworth, Esquire, Solicitor-General of the
said Colony, <i>vice</i> James Croke, Esquire, released from
office on political grounds."</p>
<p>The Government <i>Gazette</i> Extraordinary of December 10th,
1855, contains a proclamation constituting these gentlemen and
General Macarthur, the Commander of the Forces, the Executive
Council of Victoria, and also one announcing that, on the same
day, Sir Chas. Hotham had taken the oaths as Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief of the Colony.</p>
<p>The principle of ministerial responsibility had now been
established, though the Parliament under the New Constitution had
not been elected; so that Ministers were bound to resign, on
sustaining a defeat, upon any important question of policy or
vote of confidence in the old Legislative Council. This body had
to continue its sittings some time longer, in order to prepare
the way for the new Parliament which was to succeed it. It was
not long before the first ministerial crisis was brought about.
An amendment to the Act, introduced by the Government, for the
regulation of the elections of the new Parliament, was adopted,
declaring that votes should be recorded by Ballot. It was moved
by Mr. Wm. Nicholson, and, after two nights' discussion, carried
against the Ministry, on December 19th, 1855, by 33 votes to 25.
Whereupon Mr. Haines and his colleagues resigned; but, after an
ineffectual attempt on the part of Mr. Nicholson to form a
Government, they remained in office, which they held for upwards
of a year&mdash;till some time after the meeting of the new
Parliament.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Hotham died, after a short illness, on the last
day of 1856.</p>
<p>The Government <i>Gazette</i> of January 4th, 1856, contains a
proclamation of the same date, of Major-General Macarthur,
Commander of the Forces in Australia, announcing that in
consequence of the death of Sir Chas. Hotham, he had assumed the
office of Governor, which he held for nearly a year, till
succeeded by Sir Henry Barkly on December 26th.</p>
<p>All the arrangements having been completed, the elections for
the first Parliament of Victoria duly took place, and the full
list of the members of both Houses appeared in the Government
<i>Gazette</i> of November 6th, 1856. The names certainly should
be recorded before closing the early history of the colony. Those
of the Legislative Council or Upper House were:&mdash;</p>

<p>This first Parliament of Victoria met November 21st, 1856. Sir
James Palmer, who had been Speaker of the old Legislative
Council, was chosen first President of the new Upper House. In
the Legislative Assembly there was a contest for the chair
between two excellent early colonists&mdash;with respect to whom
the only feeling could have been that of regret that both could
not have been made Speaker&mdash;Dr., now Sir Francis, Murphy,
and the late Mr. Charles James Griffith. The former was the
successful candidate. Parliament was opened by the Acting
Governor, General Macarthur.</p>
<p>And now that the little settlement on the banks of the Yarra
of 1835 had grown into the metropolis of the self-governing
Province of Victoria of 1856&mdash;with two Houses of Parliament
and responsible ministers&mdash;the colony had clearly passed
from the early and obscure era of its history to times when every
event in its career would be amply recorded.</p>

<h4>SOME PERSONAL REMINISCENCES.</h4>

crisis in the Port Phillip Settlement&mdash;Its
effects&mdash;"Boiling-down" sheep&mdash;Irrigation with
Soup&mdash;The Aborigines&mdash;Kangaroos, emu,
dingoes&mdash;"Black Thursday"&mdash;Description of that terrible
day&mdash;The author's earliest recollections of his native
city&mdash;Visit to Melbourne in overcrowded days of gold

its neighbourhood&mdash;Early recollections of the
place&mdash;Importance of preserving early colonial history.</p>
<p>H<small>AVING</small> recorded, so extensively, the
information of others respecting Victoria, the author may now be
permitted to give a few of his own early personal recollections
of the colony, as well as some which he has heard from those
whose memories go back to more remote periods.</p>
<p>His parents arrived in Hobson's Bay in December, 1839, by the
<i>Westminster</i>, the second or third ship which had sailed
direct to Port Phillip from this country. The passage occupied
over a hundred days. From the imperfect sailing directions which
then existed. Cape Otway was mistaken for one of Port Phillip
Heads, and the ship had some difficulty in clearing the shore,
upon which, had the wind been less favourable, she must have run.
The captain had only some directions printed in an early colonial
newspaper, to guide him in entering Port Phillip. The author's
father has told him that when he first landed at The Beach, now
Sandridge, there was but one small habitation; and how he and
some of his fellow-passengers, in walking from that place to
Melbourne, got in among the bush-wood on the south side of the
Yarra, and had some difficulty in finding their way. They were
ferried across the river in a boat.</p>
<p>The infant city was at this time in a very primitive state,
being just four years and four months old. Its buildings were
few, and the accommodation for its population quite insufficient,
so that many people were living in tents. The author's father,
however, was favourably impressed with the young settlement, and
determined to remain at Port Phillip, though he had taken his
passage from London to Sydney. Accordingly, before leaving the
ship, which remained some time in Hobson's Bay, he, with the
captain's permission, had a large tent of four or five rooms,
made by the sailors, and it was pitched among a number of others
on the Eastern Hill, not far from where the Melbourne Club now
stands. On moving, in a few weeks, to the station which he had
bought, he sold the tent for as much as, if not more than, it had
cost. Some two or three years afterwards he bought, for three or
four hundred pounds, one of the best sites, of about an acre, in
this very best part of Melbourne, but unfortunately was induced
to sell it, not many months after, for what was considered at the
time a good profit, of fifty or a hundred pounds.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* &pound;700 a foot has, as we have seen, been
recently asked for land in the immediate neighbourhood.]</p>
<p>The station, Yallock Vale, about forty-five miles from
Melbourne and ten from Bacchus' Marsh and Ballan, had, in the
short interval since the territory had been occupied, belonged to
three proprietors, before it was purchased by the author's
father. These gentlemen were Messrs. James Simpson, Blackney, and
Hawkey. It was at the time, perhaps, about half way from
Melbourne to the confines of the country which had been taken up
by settlers in the direction in which it lay. The writer has
often heard his father say how that for some years, in riding to
Melbourne he has struck across the plains, without seeing a
track, fence, habitation, or human being&mdash;except sometimes a
solitary shepherd with his flock&mdash;until reaching the
immediate neighbourhood of Melbourne.</p>
<p>The author has also had the advantage of hearing, from the
lips of some of the earliest colonists, accounts of what they
themselves had seen. From the late Mr. J.A. Cowie, whose station
adjoined his father's, he has heard that when he first went up
the Yarra, he saw Fawkner ploughing a piece of ground where the
Melbourne wharves now are; and Mr. David Stead, Mr. Cowie's
partner&mdash;who is probably the only survivor of those who went
to Port Phillip about the same time as Batman&mdash;told the
author only two years ago, that when he first saw Melbourne it
consisted of two huts built of sods, one inhabited by Batman's
party and the other by Fawkner's. Messrs. Cowie and Stead at
first had a station near Geelong, at the creek which bears the
name of the former.</p>
<p>The progress of the newly occupied territory was early
retarded by the occurrence of one of those crises which are
common in the history of young communities; but that which so
seriously affected Port Phillip, as well as New South Wales
generally, about 1842-3, was of unusual severity&mdash;thoroughly
proving the stability of the foundations of the new settlement.
The author has often heard it spoken of by his father and other
early colonists. It was occasioned by the great fall in the price
of sheep, which, having increased out of all proportion to the
demand for meat of the limited population, became of no value
except for their wool. In a few months they fell from thirty
shillings a-head, at which the writer's father had purchased his
on taking the station, to eighteen pence.</p>
<p>The prospect was for a time so gloomy that many people with
energies only adapted for smooth and prosperous circumstances,
and some even of a hopeful and persevering temperament, gave up
the settlement as lost. Many sold out when things were lowest, in
the belief that ruin was inevitable. Mercantile houses in Sydney
and Melbourne gave way, and in their fall dragged down numerous
squatters throughout the country, who were ruined by being
suddenly called upon to repay advances which the merchants had
made them.</p>
<p>It was the custom for houses to ship wool to be sold in
England, for the squatters, giving them in the meantime credit
upon it. Those who had not taken advances to the full value, in
many instances, lost by the failure of their merchants in the
crisis, whatever they were entitled to receive upon the sale of
their wool; and those who had taken more than their wool
realized, being unexpectedly called upon to refund, were unable
to do so. The banks too often pressed squatters, who were in
their hands, with unnecessary severity. Many who eventually were
able to weather the storm, were frequently unable to pay their
servants, and were obliged to give them horses and other stock
for wages.</p>
<p>Numbers, however, determined to bear up, if possible. against
the depression&mdash;believing that the elasticity of a country
evidently possessed of such natural resources would be sufficient
to enable it not only to right itself, but to obtain a speed of
progress not previously reached. These expectations proved
incorrect, only in so far as the most favourable anticipations
fell short of what was realized.</p>
<p>The crisis sifted the ranks of the settlers, weeding out those
who were idle, unsteady, and without perseverance. Some were able
to pay their passages from the colony; others required to be
assisted; and all who returned to England gave Australia a bad
name. At no time was it more excusable to do so; but colonists
whose want of success is due to themselves, invariably blame the
colony.</p>
<p>During the depression the foundations of many fortunes were
laid. Believers in better times to come, took the opportunity to
invest when stock, stations, and town lands were at the lowest.
Capital could not have been laid out to greater advantage even
when Port Phillip was first colonized; thousands of pounds
invested during the crisis were soon multiplied by tens.
Squatters who were able to struggle through it were making
progress; their flocks were increasing; and it was not for years
after it had passed, that their stations became fully
stocked.</p>
<p>The great panic is remembered by old colonists as the darkest
period in their colonial history; and it was not for some years
that Australia recovered from the shock.</p>
<p>The first step which turned the tide of ill-fortune was the
introduction of the system of boiling down sheep. When stock
became almost worthless, it occurred to many people that, when a
fleece of wool was worth from half-a-crown to three shillings in
England, and a sheep's tallow three or four more, the value of
the animal in Australia ought to exceed eighteen pence or two
shillings. Accordingly thousands of fat sheep were annually
boiled down after shearing, and thus the average price rose to
about six shillings ahead, until the demand for mutton created by
the influx of people attracted by the gold discovery, increased
it more than three-fold; and then "boiling down", which had saved
the country, had to be given up&mdash;only to be partially
revived, a few years ago, when the supply of meat in Australia
had again largely outgrown the demand, and the system of
meat-preserving for exportation had not yet finally displaced the
more primitive system. During the boiling-down period, mutton was
almost valueless in Melbourne&mdash;legs being sold for five
shillings a dozen, and a single one for sixpence; and even then
the poorer classes rejected them.</p>
<p>The Messrs. Learmonth at Buninyong, seven miles from Ballarat,
annually "boiled down" so many of their sheep, that they found it
answered their purpose to have a place of their own, instead of
sending their fat stock, as was generally done, to a public
"boiling-down" establishment. The author well remembers visiting
it a year or two before the gold discovery, and seeing numbers of
sheep prepared for the process. No finer mutton could have
existed. The working-men came in, and helped themselves to
whatever joints or slices they liked to take out of the sheep, as
they hung skinned and ready to be cut up, before being thrown
into the melting vat. This was of large size, and in it the meat
was left till all the tallow was extracted from it. The offal
remaining consisted of flesh, so much overdone as to drop from
the bone, and of rich liquid which would have made fine soup or
jelly. This was applied to the strangest purpose for which such a
thing was ever used. Major, now Sir Arthur Cotton&mdash;being on
furlough from India, on a visit to his brothers-in-law, the
Messrs. Learmonth&mdash;tried an irrigation experiment at their
place on a limited scale. He had a dam thrown across a small
creek, and with some sluices and trenches to convey the water,
was able to carry the soup or gravy and other offal from the
boiling-down establishment over some of the adjoining land.
Magnificent crops were thus produced in some of the fields, and
splendid vegetables and fruits in the garden. This incident will
certainly stand unique in the history of soup, jelly, and
irrigation. The greater part of the refuse meat had to be carted
away some distance from the place.</p>
<p>The aborigines were in the early days comparatively numerous
in the neighbourhood in which the writer lived, but fortunately
not troublesome, as they were in other parts of the country;
they, however, rapidly decreased in numbers, though they were
well treated by the settlers. The author's father has told him of
some two or three hundred having assembled to hold a
<i>corroberie</i>, or native dance, on his station, not long
after he went to it; and he himself can remember their coming
round in considerable numbers&mdash;perhaps at times as many as
fifty or a hundred; but latterly never more than about half a
dozen. For the last few years, however, before 1859, when he left
the colony, they were never to be seen, and had become all but
extinct in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>They were the most primitive of people, with no recollections
of the past, nor ideas of the future; they lived for the day on
what they could find. Whatever notion they possessed of an
after-state was probably derived as recently as their contact
with the whites; for the author has often heard them thus express
themselves&mdash;"Blackfellow die, jump up whitefellow;
whitefellow die, jump up blackfellow."</p>
<p>Kangaroo and emu were also numerous in the neighbourhood in
the early days, but had almost completely disappeared before the
time to which the writer's recollection reaches back. Dingoes, or
native dogs continued for some years to be destructive, but were
finally exterminated by means of strychnine, although Kangaroo
dogs were of great service in destroying them; so much so that no
station was without a few of these fine animals. The writer well
remembers when, in order to protect sheep from being attacked by
dingoes, it was indispensable to have them folded at night, and
for the shepherd to sleep beside his flock, in a movable wooden
structure, called a watch-box, built on wheels, so that it might
be moved when the hurdles of the fold were changed to fresh
ground, as they were every day or two.</p>
<p>In the early days, and for the first few years, all the
habitations in the Bush were mere wooden huts, of a very
primitive description; but the settlers soon made these dwellings
more comfortable, and in a few years substituted for them
substantial houses of brick and stone, which, for the most part,
would have been no discredit as country residences in
England&mdash;especially as attached to them were usually
beautiful gardens producing flowers at all seasons and abounding
in fruits of numerous varieties.</p>
<p>Thursday, February 6th, 1851, can never be forgotten by those
who were then in Victoria. It will always with them bear the
appropriate name, given at the time, of "Black Thursday". The
author, as a child, certainly, never had anything so vividly
impressed upon his recollection. Every summer bush-fires were
more or less common in the country; but never before or after was
there such a day of universal fire in almost every part of
Victoria. It had been preceded by an unusually long period of
excessive heat, with strong hot winds from the north; and the
pastures, which at the time of year are always dry, were thus
rendered extremely inflammable. The result was that in all parts
of the country, wherever it caught fire, by accident or
otherwise, the flames swept everything before them. All attempts
to stop them, by the ordinary means of beating them out with
branches of trees, were fruitless. Men were obliged to fly from
them as best they could, and in some instances were unable to
escape, and lost their lives; homesteads, huts, wool-sheds,
bridges, stacks, and crops were demolished; flocks of sheep
destroyed as well as cattle, horses, and other animals; birds
were seen to fall from the trees, and numbers of them were
afterwards found dead. The flames ran along the ground at an
incredible speed, and, where the grass was long, in a perfect
wall. As they advanced they were frequently preceded by various
patches of fire, which were kindled by pieces of loose bark,
blown by the gale from the gum-trees, often for a considerable
distance&mdash;wide beaten roads and broad streams, which would
have stopped most bush-fires, affording no check to this terrible
one.</p>
<p>The writer's experience will convey some idea of what Black
Thursday really was. When the fire was first observed upon his
father's station, all the men were sent to do what could be done
to check it; but as soon as they got near the flames, they were
obliged to fly from them, and, escaping back, concentrated their
efforts on saving the house. As the fire came bounding up to it,
the writer's father was about to mount his horse, and he himself
his pony; but they had only time to turn both animals adrift and
rush in at the gate of the enclosure in which the kitchen stood.
The horse was so badly burnt that it was a question next day
whether he would not have to be shot, but with care he ultimately
recovered; the pony only had her flowing tail considerably
singed.</p>
<p>The house and kitchen were built of brick, but roofed with
wooden shingles. The former stood in a garden, of upwards of an
acre, and the latter in an enclosure&mdash;both being surrounded
with wooden paling, which, catching fire in many places, had to
be broken down. A quantity of wood for fuel, piled close to the
kitchen, was soon in flames, which threatened to catch the roof
of the building, from whence they would certainly have spread to
that of the house. By applying wet blankets, for several hours,
to the side of the kitchen roof which was in danger, it was with
difficulty prevented from igniting.</p>
<p>Before evening, three bridges, haystacks, crops, fences, huts,
and the building in which a year's supplies for the station had
just been laid in, were reduced to ashes. The two large gardens,
in which fruits, flowers, vegetables, and various plants had been
flourishing with Australian luxuriance, appeared to be utterly
destroyed; only a few of the trees, however, died. The gardener,
after walking about a day or two, thinking of giving up his place
in despair, set to work and, digging about the roots of the
trees, saturated them with water, which he carried up the steep
banks of the creek running between the two gardens. The fruit
trees, which were mostly of the kinds common in England, cast
their leaves, but soon came out with fresh foliage, and in some
instances with blossoms, which even produced a small quantity of
fruit. At a neighbouring station, a large new wool-shed&mdash;in
which was a carriage recently obtained from England&mdash;was
burned, so were a horse and cart and a number of sheep; and,
worst of all, a human life was lost. One small farmer in another
part of the country, who was prosperous in the morning, had
before night lost his crops, his habitation, and his wife.</p>
<p>At the station of the author's father, all but a very few of
the sheep were saved, and so was the wool-shed&mdash;from which
all the wool of the year's shearing had not been carted away. On
the very morning of Black Thursday a flock of several hundred
sheep had been sent off to a neighbour to whom they had been
sold. When the fire came down, the author's father despatched a
trustworthy young man after them, who, riding at great speed,
overtook them about five miles away, just as the fire was upon
them. The shepherd, in great terror, was crying like a child.
There being no time to lose, the young man dismounted, set fire
to the grass in advance of the sheep, from which the flames ran
with great velocity. He and the shepherd immediately put out a
few yards of the grass&mdash;which was burning back against the
high wind towards the sheep&mdash;and safely drove them in upon
the burnt ground before the fire in the rear had time to come
up.</p>
<p>On many stations the pastures were completely swept away, or
the grass left was quite insufficient for the stock. The latter
was the case at the station of the writer's father, who had to
send away several thousand sheep until the grass grew again. This
did not take place for some time, as but little rain fell for two
months after Black Thursday.</p>
<p>It was from the darkness of the day in Melbourne and Geelong,
rather than from the charring effects of the fire, that the name
was derived. In Melbourne the heat was excessive, and the
atmosphere thick and smoky. It was known that great fires were
raging in the country. Much uneasiness was felt lest one should
break out in the city; for with the high, hot wind, it was
impossible to say how far it might have carried destruction.
Burnt leaves were falling everywhere&mdash;some being carried on
board vessels many miles out at sea, and even across to Tasmania,
where the atmosphere was so much affected, as to inform the
inhabitants of the great fires on the mainland. The night
following this awful, fiery day presented a grand but terrible
spectacle. Vast tracts of country, over which the fire had swept,
exhibited a brilliant illumination of burning trees and logs,
sending forth showers of sparks; but then for weeks after there
was nothing to be seen but burnt grass, charred trees, and
withered leaves. The neighbouring colonies did not experience the
horrors of Black Thursday.</p>
<p>The author's earliest recollections of his native city are, of
course, of a very indistinct nature. He can just remember being
brought down, from the Bush, to Melbourne and Geelong, when he
could not have been more than five years of age. Of the latter
place, as well as of Williamstown, where he was about the same
time, he has only a confused idea of having seen a few houses. Of
Melbourne, which he must have visited a few months before or
after, he retains a more distinct remembrance&mdash;some
incidents calculated to impress themselves on the mind of a child
having struck him. One of these serves strongly to contrast the
Melbourne of the past and of the present. The street boys had an
amusement, which he much envied them; they were in the habit of
chasing, catching, and riding the goats, which browsed about the
principal streets of the infant city. Either on this visit, or
the one of which he is about to speak, he was driven along a mere
bush road, to the Beach, now Sandridge&mdash;here there was only
one habitation&mdash;and for the first time bathed in the
sea.</p>
<p>The writer does not distinctly remember Melbourne before the
year 1847, when he was staying with his parents at Brighton for
about three months&mdash;from March to May&mdash;during which
time he occasionally went into town. In fact he believes he
attended St. James's Church every Sunday, except one unfavourable
day, when he was present at the service at Brighton, where an
estimable early colonist, the late Dr. Wilmot, used to read
prayers in a schoolroom.</p>
<p>St. James's was then the only Church of England in Melbourne,
or its vicinity&mdash;one at Geelong being probably the only
other in the colony. St. Peter's, on the Eastern Hill, was at the
time in course of erection. The other leading denominations were
also represented by about one church each. As far as the author
remembers their names, the clergymen of the different churches
were the Rev. A.C. Thomson, Church of England; Rev. Irvine
Hetherington, Church of Scotland; Rev. James Forbes, Free Church;
Rev. Alex. Morrison, Independent; either the Rev. Mr. Waterfield
or Butters, Wesleyan; and Rev. Father Geogheghan, Roman Catholic.
The Rev. Mr. Collins was the Church of England, and the Rev. A.
Love, Church of Scotland, Minister at Geelong.</p>
<p>The country and the road between Brighton and Melbourne were
nothing but "bush." There was no habitation between the former
and the Yarra, except about midway, where some half-dozen houses
were to be seen peeping out among the gum-trees at the side of
the "bush" road. This was embryo St. Kilda. The Yarra was then
crossed by a wooden toll bridge, which has long since
disappeared. It stood close to Prince's Bridge, which the author
well remembers observing at the time, in course of
construction.</p>
<p>He also recollects walking up to St. Peter's Church, which was
unfinished. It stood out alone as the extreme limit of the town,
no buildings being seen beyond it, Collingwood and Melbourne not
having then grown out to meet each other, and the district by
Carlton Gardens having no existence. Down towards the Richmond
Paddock, as it was called, were the houses of Mr. La Trobe and
Captain Lonsdale, and perhaps one or two others. What existed of
Richmond and Collingwood were quite isolated suburbs, which the
author has no recollection of having seen.</p>
<p>He has a clear remembrance of the limits of the city at this
time in another direction. Only one side of Lonsdale Street was
in existence, the other being quite unbuilt, with the exception
of St. Francis' Roman Catholic Church, which was the farthest
edifice on the outer side, in the direction of the country. It
was quite a walk in those days, out beyond the houses, to the Old
Cemetery&mdash;a fact which is impressed on the author's mind by
a visit to the grave of his grandfather, who had recently been
interred there. Near the Cemetery was the Flag-staff Hill, where
vessels coming up the Bay were signaled. At this time the arrival
or departure of a ship was an event in the history of the little
community. Perhaps, besides the <i>Shamrock</i> steamer, which
ran to Sydney and Tasmania, and one or two which plied in the
Bay, there were not as many as four or five coasting crafts at
once in the river; and at times Hobson's Bay probably could not
always boast of the presence of even a single ship.</p>
<p>When staying at Brighton, the author was much impressed by
seeing a vessel sailing down the Bay for England&mdash;so much so
that he still remembers her name, which he gave to a toy ship
which was shortly afterwards made for him&mdash;the
<i>Achilles</i>; but, in these primitive days of Melbourne a
boy's brass cannon was not to be had to put on board her.</p>
<p>At this time also great quantities of melons were to be seen
growing in the gardens and fields about Brighton; in fact
generally throughout the country more attention seemed then to be
given to their cultivation than afterwards&mdash;when, the colony
being older, the various kinds of fruit-trees for which the
climate is so well adapted, had had time to come into full
bearing.</p>
<p>The author thinks it must have been about two years after his
visit of 1847 when he was again in Melbourne; but after that he
was there regularly about once a year&mdash;sometimes going to or
from Geelong in one of the three steamers which were then the
means of communication between the two places. The improvement in
both towns was observable; but not so very striking till
subsequently to the gold discovery, when after an absence of a
few months, much had to be noted, especially in the development
of Melbourne and its suburbs.</p>
<p>The writer was an eye-witness of the immense change in the
colony, its capital and some of its other towns, effected by the
rush to the gold fields. A book might easily be devoted to this
period of Victorian history&mdash;about which much more has been
written than of any other. He well remembers going in to
Melbourne by the Keilor Road, when that road was being
made&mdash;men of all ranks and conditions being employed upon
it, at ten shillings a day wages. He can never forget reaching
Melbourne one evening, when the city was in its most overcrowded
condition. His father had driven him in from the station; and
they had to go the round of a number of hotels and boarding
establishments before they could get any accommodation. At one
place the landlady put on an expression of amusement and surprise
at the simplicity of any one inquiring if she had a room to let.
"Oh, no," was the reply, "I have people sleeping on tables and
chairs, already." At last they were informed at Hockin's Hotel,
Lonsdale Street, that perhaps they might have a bed on the floor
of the coffee-room; but that as to anything like dinner or
tea&mdash;the regular time for these being past&mdash;that was
out of the question. They had to go the round of several livery
stables before they could get their horses taken in. At last they
succeeded, paying either 1<i>l</i>. or 1<i>l</i>. 10<i>s</i>. a
day for each horse, the latter price being at one time reached;
but the people, though promising to give them plenty of food and
water, said they could not groom them. Having so far arranged for
themselves and their horses, the writer went with his father to
the house of a friend to beg for something to eat, which was soon
kindly provided by the lady and her daughter, though they were
without servants. On going back to Hockin's Hotel, they were,
however, agreeably surprised to find that, instead of being
obliged to sleep on the floor of the coffee-room, a good bedroom
was ready for them, which they occupied for the few nights they
were in town.</p>
<p>Had they not succeeded here, their only remaining hope of
getting housed for the night was, that the author should be left
in charge of the friends who had given them tea, and that his
father should avail himself of whatever sleeping accommodation he
might have been able to obtain in the Melbourne Club. But even
there also members often could not find a bed.</p>
<p>It was about this time that an eminent member of the Sydney
Bar, Mr. Darvell, came down to accept a seat on the Bench of the
Supreme Court of Victoria; but on arriving in Melbourne, he in
vain went the round of hotels and boarding-houses, in search of a
room for the night, and had at last to content himself with
sleeping in an armchair in the Melbourne Club. He determined to
decline the judgeship and returned by the first steamer to
Sydney.</p>
<p>At this time the boilers of a steamer which were lying on the
wharf, were gladly resorted to as a sleeping place, by people who
could have well paid for beds, if they were to have been had for
money. To supply the deficiency of accommodation&mdash;but the
provision proved inadequate&mdash;a town of tents was formed a
short distance across Princes' Bridge, on the St. Kilda Road, and
was called by the appropriate name of Canvas Town. It existed for
some months, was regularly laid out in streets, and contained
several thousand inhabitants. The author visited it when it had
about attained its greatest dimensions.</p>
<p>These were the days too of fabulous prices, when provisions
and all the other necessaries of life were at a famine value in
Melbourne and Geelong; but at the gold-fields the cost of the
carriage, about 1<i>l</i>. a ton per mile, or 120<i>l</i>. to
Bendigo, had at one time to be added to the price of everything.
There was then no cultivation near the diggings, to supply the
sudden demand. The squatters had only been allowed to grow on the
Crown lands what they required for the use of their stations, and
there were no other inland consumers of farm produce. Everything,
therefore, had to be brought from a distance by carriers, over
unmade roads; and in the few places where agriculture had been
carried on, numbers of farmers for a year or two left their land
uncultivated, in order to seek less certain fortune in the
pursuit of gold-digging.</p>
<p>The infatuation of this pursuit had also induced people to
abandon all kinds of regular professions, callings, and
positions. The Government service became inadequately supplied
with officials; the police force was quite below the required
strength, Melbourne for a time having only a very few men on
duty. To make up for the deficiency, a distinct body of gentlemen
was enrolled as a mounted force, styled Cadets. Many young men,
unaccustomed to labour, who soon found gold-digging did not suit
them, were glad to join this body, which existed for a year or
two.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all the disorganization occasioned by the rush
to the gold-fields, order was on the whole remarkably well
maintained. It is true that there was for a time bushranging, or
"sticking up", as it was called, along the roads to the diggings;
a gold-escort was on one occasion robbed; and the <i>Nelson</i>,
a ship lying in Hobson's Bay, was boarded at night, and a large
quantity of the gold, with which she was about to sail for
England, was carried off. This state of things, however, was of
short duration. It existed, more or less in 1852-3-4, but passed
away with the excitement of those years; and Victoria speedily
settled down into one of the most orderly communities in the
world. Its peace was never interrupted by any serious
disturbance, except the Ballarat riots.</p>
<p>The author well remembers the neighbourhood of Ballarat for
two or three years before gold was thought of. In fact some
months before the discovery, he passed near the field, if not
over it, on the occasion of a day's excursion which, as a boy he
made to Lake Burrumbut, with some friends from Buninyong. The
whole country then, about 1849 or 1850, was devoted to sheep
pasture. There were no farms, and not a fence to be seen along
the bush road, or rather track, between the Lake and Buninyong;
and at the former the only habitation was an out-station of the
Messrs. Learmonth&mdash;nothing but the "bush" pure and
simple!</p>
<p>When the country was first colonized, Lake Burrumbut was quite
dry. A lady still living in Victoria, a friend of the author,
informed him that in the early days she once drove across the bed
of the lake. A hill close to it was called Mount Misery, from the
circumstance that some of the first explorers of the
neighbourhood were much distressed at failing to find any water.
The story was told of them&mdash;and the author gives it as
repeated to him from a colonist who heard it from one of the
party, the late Dr. Thomson&mdash;that they reached the
neighbourhood of Buninyong, being still in great want of water.
They camped after dark, and one of the explorers having got up in
the night, to gather some wood to put on the fire, unexpectedly
discovered what they so much needed, by suddenly walking or
falling into a creek or pond.</p>
<p>The fact that in many places, where water was not to be found
when the country was first settled, and that, even in ponds which
were dry within the author's recollection, it is now permanent,
is proof that the depasturing of stock on the land has made the
soil firm and no longer porous, and that its cultivation has
attracted moisture.</p>
<p>But to return to Ballarat. A few weeks after the gold was
discovered, when the first rush to the place was at its greatest
height, the author's father, with his neighbour, Mr. Griffith,
spent a day there, and saw quantities of gold being procured. One
man was observed sitting with a lump of earth picking out the
nuggets with a knife, as if they were plums in a pudding. The
writer's father, in looking about, in the most casual way, found
one or two little pieces. A good many people were of course quite
unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The visitors were told of a Melbourne doctor who, as was said
of some of his profession, had taken to "opening veins with the
pickaxe instead of with the lancet." He with some other gentlemen
had been up at Ballarat. They had left their horses at a grazing
paddock, some miles away, and had walked to the diggings. The
first day was spent in excavating earth from the side of the
hill&mdash;loads of which the doctor carried on his back to the
creek, where it was to be washed. When this process took place,
towards evening, scarcely a speck of gold was to be seen. The
doctor, in disgust started off, carrying his saddle, to where he
had left his horse, and, mounting him, set out to return to
Melbourne that very night.</p>
<p>The author himself visited Ballarat, three or four months
later, in January or February, 1852, after the great rush was
over, and most of the people had gone off to the Mount Alexander
diggings. He was driven over from Buninyong, with one or two
other boys. They spent the afternoon, and had a sort of picnic
dinner on the flat by the river. The town of Ballarat had at that
time no existence whatever; no habitations were to be seen,
except a few tents, chiefly about the Government camp at Golden
Point. This hill was one heap of excavated earth, among which a
few people were still at work. The writer washed out a little of
the soil, in a small tin dish or vessel, at the bottom of which
he found a few specks of gold.</p>
<p>Mr. Withers, in his History of Ballarat, published in 1870,
speaks of the site as one on which the emu and kangaroo were
often hunted by the early colonists; and the Rev. Thomas Hastie,
of Buninyong, in a statement contributed to Mr. Withers' book,
says, "I often passed the spot on which Ballarat is built. . . .
and there could not be a prettier spot imagined. It was the very
picture of repose. There was, in general, plenty of grass and
water, and often I have seen the cattle in considerable numbers
lying in quiet enjoyment after being satisfied with the pasture.
There was a beautiful clump of wattles where Lydiard Street now
stands, and on one occasion, when Mrs. Hastie was with me, she
remarked, 'What a nice place for a house, with the flat in front
and the wattles behind.'" Mr. Hastie describes how the hut-keeper
of a shepherd's hut near Ballarat, complained that, "the solitude
was so painful that he could not endure it, for he saw no one
from the time the shepherds went out in the morning till they
returned at night. I was the only person he had ever seen there
who was not connected with the station."</p>
<p>The first discovery of gold in Victoria was made within a mile
or two of Buninyong, by a wheelwright named Hiscock, who on
grubbing up a tree by the roots, observed something bright in the
earth attached to them. It proved to be gold. The author has
visited the place and seen the tree in question, which should
certainly be preserved and the spot marked. Though this was
undoubtedly the first practical discovery of gold ever followed
up, it is pretty certain that the mineral had more than once
before been found in different parts of the colony. Mr. La Trobe,
as we have seen, states that some had been previously obtained in
the Pyrenees; and the author has heard on undoubted authority of
a shepherd at Mount Alexander, who one evening brought home a
piece of something, which most probably was gold; but on being
laughed at by his fellow-servants, he threw it away. The writer
also remembers a shepherd in his father's employment a few years
before the great discovery, who talked so much about gold and of
knowing parts of the country where it was to be found, that he
was set down as under a delusion, if not insane upon the
subject.</p>
<p>The author has now given a few early colonial reminiscences.
It is most desirable that as many as possible of such facts of
the early history of all the colonies, should be preserved. It is
the duty of those who possess them to put them on record; and it
is to be feared that not a few of much interest have already
perished. The author hopes that what little he has done, may
induce some of the remaining early colonists to commit their
personal recollections to writing. If, wherever there is a
literary institution or library in Australia, the information
respecting the neighbourhood or district in which it exists, were
collected from the oldest inhabitants, a vast amount of very
valuable and interesting facts would be preserved.</p>
<p>The writer cannot do better than close this chapter with the
words of a letter he received not long since, from Dr. Garran, of
Sydney. "There is a great deal of early history in all these
colonies still to be gathered from oral sources, and which will
be lost, except as tradition, when the present generation is
gone."</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>
<br>
<p>A <small>FRIEND</small>, to whom the author mentioned that he
was engaged upon this work, remarked, that he was not aware that
Victoria had any history. But, like all colonies, she has had
much. What a variety of discoveries, adventures, enterprises and
incidents, have had to be noted, since the day when Cook first
saw the land at Point Hicks, till the colony was fully explored,
and finally inhabited!&mdash;and even in the much briefer sketch,
of the development of the sparsely peopled district of Port
Phillip, into a separate and subsequently self-governing
province, much had to be mentioned; but how much more to be
omitted!</p>
<p>The events and incidents, therefore, which demand notice in
any history of our colony, are numerous and various; the men who
took part in them a goodly number; not a few of them heroes.
Victoria will ever treasure their memories, as those of her own
children, though they were born before she had any existence. But
they are as truly hers, as though generations of their
forefathers had lived upon and laid their ashes in her soil; for
theirs was the same flesh and blood which will be possessed by
all her future sons, whom no length of time can sever from the
great Imperial race to which they belong. The traditions, heroes
and heritages of that race in this its ancient seat; are the
property of its newest offshoots, whose achievements likewise
belong to the people of the parent land. We have only been
speaking of the large amount of history, and the many heroes,
which Victoria alone has produced; these, plus those of 80 many
other colonies, make up a large array, which forms no
inconsiderable portion of the great aggregate of British
fame.</p>
<p>"Peace hath her victories no less renowned than war." Some of
the most brilliant of these have been achieved amidst the most
tranquil scenes of colonization, in those new Australian lands,
which bear not a single stain of battlefield. That flag, so
renowned for "braving the battle and the breeze," has never
attained such real fame, as when leading to those peaceful
triumphs of exploration and colonization, whereby British
civilization, our just laws, our free institutions, and our
Scriptural Christianity have been so widely extended, and a
grander Empire established than any which, in the whole annals of
the world, was ever won by the sword of the mightiest
conqueror.</p>
<p>Victoria has had a history, but without a single dark page to
mark a contrast. Had there been such pages in it, had there been
wars, bloodshed, and battles to record&mdash;distress and
disturbance, instead of progressive prosperity and
tranquillity&mdash;then no one would have doubted that our Colony
had had a history. Happy would it have been for most lands, if
they had had no history in this sense in which Victoria, and all
Australia, may be said to have had none. The tragic and the
horrible are surely too much regarded as the necessary
ingredients of history.</p>
<p>Besides the heroes of exploration&mdash;many of whom, we have
seen, accomplished deeds of the greatest magnitude and
daring&mdash;Victoria possessed amongst her founders, numbers of
colonists of whom any young community might be justly proud.
There were amongst them men of all ranks and conditions; British
officers, who had previously done good service to the Empire, in
the array and navy; men of high character and education, of
capacity, industry, and perseverance&mdash;in fact of all those
qualities which have made the name of Great Britain famous in the
arts of peace and war, and which have extended her commerce and
her Empire far and wide over the face of the globe.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to make out a perfect list&mdash;though
most desirable if such a thing could be done&mdash;of those
worthy men, the early settlers of Victoria, who came from various
quarters; some across from Tasmania; others "overlanders" from
New South Wales; and many direct from the old country. It would
be invidious to mention names when some of the most deserving
might be left out. Though there were doubtless exceptions to the
rule, Victoria was fortunate in her early pioneers; and later in
her career she has had many sterling public and private men to
whom she is indebted, more than may be supposed, for her
progress, and the safe conduct of her affairs, through the many
difficulties of her unprecedented growth. Those who have taken
their places, will not do badly if they act as well and as
faithfully in her best interests. As one by one the pioneers drop
off, they leave blanks which cannot be filled; for Victoria can
have no more founders, those who first began the work and early
joined in carrying it on, having performed their parts so
well.</p>
<p>One of these, who not very many weeks ago expressed a kind
wish to see these pages, is already gone; and in Mr. Edward
Wilson we have an illustration of how, in one of many ways,
energy, public spirit, and large-hearted sympathies, in
individual colonists, have promoted the early development of the
new land, and secured well merited, but hard earned, success and
fortune to the possessors of these virtues.</p>
<p>Providence has so richly endowed our fair land with one of the
best of climates, with a large extent of fertile soil, with vast
mineral wealth, and other great natural resources, that Victoria
can produce from beneath her soil great richness, and, better
still, from her fields, gardens, and pastures, the various
plants, birds, and animals of every clime, except those which can
only exist at the Poles or in the Tropics.</p>
<p>Her past, when once her infant struggles for existence were
over, has been one continuous, forward march of unprecedented
development. When we look at the colony now, and think what it
was but a few years ago&mdash;within the memory of so many living
men&mdash;it seems as if generations must have intervened whilst
all that we contemplate has grown up. It seems impossible that
some should still be living who set foot upon her land, as its
first permanent inhabitants.</p>
<p>And, having so far exclusively treated of the past, shall we
close without a word about the future? With such a progress, with
such a past, with such resources, we cannot fear for the future
of Victoria. Men of our Anglo-Saxon race will never, as other
peoples have done, mar some of God's most highly gifted lands. It
would require the weight of much bad government to retard the
progress of any of our Australian colonies However wise or unwise
Free trade or Protection may be, neither can make or mar
Victoria.</p>
<p>The colony probably possesses all the essentials of a
self-contained State, to an extent exceeded or equalled by few
other territories of its size; so that it might with less risk
act upon the Chinese principle of exclusion. Victoria may,
therefore, look forward to be great within herself, and feel the
utmost confidence in energetically developing her vast resources.
But, though she might be great in isolation, how much more so
must she be as one of a splendid group of Australian States,
working out in harmony their wide, common interests, either with
or without intercolonial federal union. How much greater still
must she and each and all of them appear, as members of a grand
future Confederation of Great Britain! In the strength and
security of such a union Victoria&mdash;as well as every other
colony, in or out of Australia, and even the mother country
herself&mdash;may pursue her own individual career, with a safety
and confidence with respect to external relations and Foreign
Powers, which alone can be enjoyed, in the light, but most
effective bond of Imperial Confederacy.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Victoria is essential to the attainment of
full perfection by her noble sister colonies, as theirs is to
her; and they will all realize the fact, the more they grow out
of the infant stages, which are always the most jealous stages of
colonial existence.</p>
<p>The true light in which to view every colony or division of
the Empire, whether it be important or unimportant, is as a unit
of a great whole. It is for those who belong to that unit to
think and do their very best of and for it. It is desirable that
every man should consider his colony or division of the Empire
the very best, so long as he entertains no unworthy feelings
toward any of the others. Thus we shall have all our people
making the best of the units; and these by such a process of
energetic development, of healthy competition and friendly
rivalry, will be brought to the highest condition of efficiency,
and make up the grand total,&mdash;the Empire. Complete
provincial self-government, in some instances with inter-colonial
confederation, will be essential to perfect the organization of
our British fellow-countrymen in all our dominions&mdash;the
keystone of the system being Imperial Federation.</p>
<p>The future of Victoria, as of her sister colonies, lies in
retaining a perfect individuality in the brilliant constellation
of States, which will revolve round the great centre of Imperial
unity. She is destined to shine brightly among these. The highest
perfection, the most complete greatness, strength, and fame of
which she or any of them, or even the mother country herself, is
capable, are not to be found in the isolation of single
communities, or even of great groups of states, but in the unity
of a common Empire&mdash;whose magnificent territories stretch
into every clime and quarter of the globe, and whose combined
strength will, with the blessing of God, be a sure guarantee of
security and peace to the weakest as well as the strongest member
of that Empire.</p>
<p>Its extended commerce, the marvellous improvements in
communication, the practical annihilation of distance, the growth
of so many common interests&mdash;all tend to facilitate the
creation of an organization for the management of the joint
affairs of that Empire; and unless the constructive genius
whereby the British people have always adapted themselves to the
circumstances of the past fail them, in those of the
future,&mdash;unless statesmen become extinct among us, a
practical Federal organization will be forthcoming as soon as it
is needed. The rise in so few years of the Australian Colonies,
and most conspicuously of Victoria, shows how soon they may be
expected to take their place, and enter into their full
privileges, as members of an Empire&mdash;the wisdom and
patriotism of whose united people may make the grandest the world
has ever seen, or can see.</p>
<p>If the past history of British Colonization has been full of
interest, the future is full of hope&mdash;of great and noble
expectations. We have watched the growth of one infant state,
from the embryo stage of its existence. We now see it passing
through a period of transition, and cannot but look forward with
more intense interest to a grand transformation, in which
Victoria, and her sister colonies, in Australia, America, and
Africa, shall cease to be the infants&mdash;though always proud
to be the children&mdash;of Old England, and will become her
partners in that great heritage of Empire, which she has so nobly
won for them all, as well as for herself.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>
<br>
<p>A<small>RBITRATION</small> appears to have been resorted to by
the early colonists even before the resolutions of the meeting on
June 1st, 1836, as will be seen by the award, a copy of which
has, at the last moment, been kindly placed in the author's hands
by Mr. J. Vesey Fitzgerald.</p>
<p align="center">"<small>FAC-SIMILE COPY OF FIRST JUDICIAL
DECISION GIVEN IN VICTORIA</small>.<br>
<br>
<i>Photolithographed by John Noone.</i></p>
<p class="negindent4">We award in the dispute between Mr. Henry
Batman and Mr. John Pascal Fawkener&mdash;on the first
Claim&mdash;thirty Shillings. On the second claim nothing, altho'
a strong presumption is on our minds that some hasty expressions
of Mr. Batman may have led Bullett to destroy the
Rabbits,&mdash;On the third Claim damage Five Shillings; and a
fine of Twenty Shillings in consideration of its being an act of
unauthorized aggression; and in the fourth Claim nothing, as it
does not appear that Mr. Batman set the dogs on the
calf.&mdash;We cannot omit remarking that there has been a degree
of forbearance on the part of Mr. Fawkener highly gratifying to
us and if generally practised very conducive to the general
good.</p>
