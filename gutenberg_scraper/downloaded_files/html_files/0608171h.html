<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER  I. &mdash; A MATTER OF SHEEP</h2>

<p class="first">A LITTLE pile of opened letters, with their
neatly-slit envelopes pinned to them, lay beside the typewriter
on the desk: the girl who sat back from the desk in her
comfortable chair, reading a novel, was tall, but not too tall;
she had piquantly irregular features, brown hair with reddish
shades in it, and deep, blue eyes, long-lashed. Her principal
attraction was expressiveness, both of eyes and lips, though she
could render her face as wooden as a doorpost if she chose.</p>

<p>She put the novel down on the desk as a tall, youngish man,
with exceptionally large feet and hands, came into the doorway of
the room and, paused for a moment, reflected as he always did
when he first saw her for the day that he had been wise in his
choice of a secretary. He looked ungainly, at a first glance, by
reason of those feet and hands, but a second glance would
convince anyone that he was nothing of the sort. Clean-shaven,
pleasantly ugly, he gave the girl a smile as she looked up at
him.</p>

<p>"Morning, Miss Brandon," he said.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Green," she answered. "There are&mdash;yes,
twenty-two inquiries, none of them very interesting."</p>

<p>"We'd better get an editorial regrets done, I think," he
said.</p>

<p>She looked a question at him, and he explained:</p>

<p>"You know. Not&mdash;'the editor regrets'&mdash;in our case,
but the same sort of thing. 'Messrs. Gees have given careful
consideration to your case as stated in your letter, and regret
they are unable to offer any advice.' Something like
that&mdash;get it engraved in copperplate and run on to decent
paper. It'll save you answering each one individually."</p>

<p>"But I've so little to do, as it is," she pointed out.</p>

<p>"I know," he assented gravely. "It's growing into weeks since
we wound up the Kestwell case, and I put the balance of that
twelve thousand pounds away in the safe. And we've spent over two
of the twelve thousand already, including my new car."</p>

<p>"We?" she queried stiffly.</p>

<p>"Well, I saw you putting a new typewriter ribbon on a couple
of days ago," he said, "and I suppose you paid the window
cleaner. I didn't."</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang before she could reply. She removed
the receiver and listened, and then replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think eleven o'clock would be all right. Will
you hold on while I ask one of the principals?"</p>

<p>With her hand over the mouthpiece she looked up at
Green&mdash;or Gees, as his intimate friends always called
him:</p>

<p>"A Mr. Tyrrell from Cumberland is in London&mdash;his letter
is among those on the desk&mdash;and wants to see you at eleven
o'clock, Mr. Green."</p>

<p>"Okay by me," he answered. "Tell him I also yearn."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Tyrrell"&mdash;she spoke into the
receiver&mdash;"our Mr. Green will be pleased to see you at
eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>She replaced the receiver, and turned over several of the
letters, eventually picking out one which she handed to Gees.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "it will be as well to see what he wants
before he gets here, and there's half an hour to go. I hope the
poke contains a real pig&mdash;we get so many silly
inquiries."</p>

<p>He glanced at the sheet of paper. Pinned at the top left-hand
corner was a small clipping, evidently from some agony column. It
read&mdash;</p>

<p>"Consult <span class="smcap">Gee's Confidential Agency</span>
for everything, from mumps to murder. Initial consultation, two
guineas&mdash;37, Little Oakfield Street, Haymarket, London,
S.W.I."</p>

<p>"Ah," Gees observed complacently. "Our old 'mumps to murder'
is still pulling 'em in, then, even from the wilds of Cumberland.
But&mdash;Oh! What the&mdash;? Am I a goat? The man's daft!"</p>

<p>"He enclosed a check for two guineas," Miss Brandon
remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I said he was daft, didn't I? Sheep? Does he think we're
a veterinary establishment, or a dumb friends' league?"</p>

<p>"I suppose sheep come between mumps and murder," she said
reflectively, "and he is the only one who sent the two guineas in
advance."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll talk to him, wurzel-worrier from the wilds
though he may be, and unless he stops the check he won't see his
two guineas any more. Now what about the rest of them, Miss
Brandon?"</p>

<p>He drew up a chair, and, seated at the end of her desk, went
through the other letters. As he put the last one down, he shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Editor's regrets are strongly indicated, Miss Brandon," he
observed, "and in the next advertisement we'll put a note to the
effect that a stamped addressed envelope must accompany all
inquiries. We shall be three bob and more down by the time you've
told all this lot that I don't feel inclined to take up their
cases. And that&mdash;" as the doorbell rang "&mdash;will be our
sheepist, I take it."</p>

<p>Rising, he went to the next room, which formed his own office,
and left her to admit the visitor. Presently she opened his
door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tyrrell to see you, Mr. Green," she announced.</p>

<p>"Ah! Come in, Mr. Tyrrell. Take that chair&mdash;it's
comfortable."</p>

<p>The visitor lowered six feet of bone and muscle into the
leather-upholstered armchair at the end of Gee's desk&mdash;he
did not know that he was directly facing a concealed microphone,
the wires of which terminated in a pair of earphones which Miss
Brandon could fit on in her room if Gees put his foot on a buzzer
stud under his desk. The net effect of him, Gees decided was
brown: brown tweed suit, well cut, with brown brogue shoes, and
he had brown eyes and a sun-browned, pleasant sort of face. An
open-air man, and a good sort, with a pleasant, honest smile.</p>

<p>"You got my letter, I hope, Mr. Green?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gees nodded at his desk. "It's here," he answered. "All I can
gather is that you want my advice about losing sheep&mdash;or
rather, about how not to lose sheep. To begin, now&mdash;have you
advertised?"</p>

<p>Tyrrell shook his head. "Not that sort of loss," he
answered.</p>

<p>"You'd better state the case," Gees advised. "The where and
the how and the why, and make it as full as you like. Though I
must warn you in advance that I know next to nothing about
sheep&mdash;on the hoof, that is. Saddle of mutton at
Simpson's&mdash;yes. Otherwise&mdash;but tell me all about it,
since you've come for a consultation."</p>

<p>His visitor smiled, thought awhile, and then began.</p>

<p>"You know Cumberland, Mr. Green?"</p>

<p>"I have a hope of visiting the lake district some day," Gees
answered, "but it hasn't materialized yet. That is&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"Not the lake district&mdash;I can see Skiddaw from my bedroom
window, but if you don't know Cumberland that conveys nothing to
you. I own about two thousand acres, Mr. Green&mdash;Tyrrells
have owned it for centuries and the greater part of it is sheep
run, though there is some arable land as well. But, in the main,
sheep farming. A far-flung country&mdash;my nearest neighbor is
well over a mile away&mdash;was, rather, until McCoul took
Locksborough Castle and decided to rebuild enough of it to live
in. Rather wild country, it would seem to you, I think. And,
since last March, I have lost over fifty sheep."</p>

<p>"And where do I come in?" Gees inquired.</p>

<p>"Those sheep have been killed&mdash;mangled horribly&mdash;by
some great dog or dogs," Tyrrell proceeded. "I've had the police
on it, of course, but with no result, except that they have
proved to me that no dog capable of doing the damage is kept
within twenty miles of my land&mdash;that is, no dog which is not
kept under proper control."</p>

<p>"In that case, what do you think I could do?" Gees asked
again.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But there's this about it. Sitting here talking
to you, the whole thing seems incredible, preposterous. My head
shepherd, a man named Cottrill, is a straight, practical,
unimaginative man of about forty, but&mdash;well, in such a
district as that old legends survive, and there is a vein of
superstition in the most practical of the people. He says it's
unearthly, and that no dog as we know dogs is responsible for the
damage. I've been out nights with him, watching&mdash;to no
purpose, of course. They were the nights when nothing
happened."</p>

<p>"Still, what could I do?" Gees insisted.</p>

<p>"Find what is destroying my sheep," Tyrrell answered
promptly.</p>

<p>"When the police who know the district have failed?" Gees
pointed out, and shook his head. "I'm afraid, Mr.
Tyrrell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they have merely approached the problem on routine
lines," Tyrrell interrupted. "Checked up all the dogs within a
reasonable radius of my flocks, and virtually proved them
innocent. After that, they own, they are at a standstill. And I
know this is no ordinary dog."</p>

<p>"The specter hound of Man, eh?" Gees observed
meditatively.</p>

<p>"Something like that, I honestly believe," Tyrrell assented
with a hint of nervous earnestness. "Oh, I know it sounds damned
silly, sitting here with a telephone handy and cars honking
outside&mdash;all the twentieth century round us. If you come to
undertake this problem for me, you'll step back a couple of
centuries, back into a world where people still believe that
solid, material things are not all of life."</p>

<p>"As you believe, evidently," Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"I have an open mind," Tyrrell admitted. "Look here, Mr.
Green&mdash; first of all, though, would this fall to you, or
would any other member of your firm undertake it, if it is
undertaken?"</p>

<p>"It would fall to me. I am the firm&mdash;all of it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;your secretary said one of the principals would see
me," Tyrrell pointed out. "So I assumed&mdash;and the name of the
firm is plural. You mean&mdash;you are Gees? All of it?"</p>

<p>"Gregory George Gordon Green," Gees said solemnly.
"Therefore."</p>

<p>"Well, look here, then. So far, I've lost fifty sheep, and if
this goes on for another six months, I shall not only lose fifty
more, but Cottrill will go, and so will others of my men. They
regard it as a curse on the place, especially those who have seen
the carcasses. If you'll undertake to kill this dog or whatever
it is&mdash;put an end to the trouble for me, I'll pay you fifty
pounds."</p>

<p>Gees considered it. "I will undertake a week's investigation
for that sum," he offered. "That is, on the understanding that
the fee is paid whether I lay the ghost or no&mdash;even if it's
merely a matter of sitting up a night or two with a gun and
shooting a dog."</p>

<p>"Umm-m!" Tyrrell grunted doubtfully. "And yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" Gees asked in the pause.</p>

<p>"Well," Tyrrell echoed, with an air of decision, "I'll pay
that, and another fifty to hold you a second week if the first is
not enough to solve the mystery. I'll go that far, for I read all
that Kestwell case and know what you did in it, and now I see
you&mdash;well!"</p>

<p>"For these bouquets, much thanks, Mr. Tyrrell," Gees said
gravely. "Shall we say&mdash;if I arrive the day after to-
morrow?"</p>

<p>"That will suit me," Tyrrell assented. "I'll meet you at the
station&mdash;it's an eight mile drive to my
place&mdash;Dowlandsbar."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I shall drive all the way," Gees said. "I run a
Rolls-Bentley, and can do it in the day comfortably.
Stay&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"You'd better let me put you up," Tyrrell answered. "The only
inn, the <i>Royal George</i>, is the better part of two miles
from me, and the accommodation there is&mdash;well, rather
primitive. Yes, I'll put you up."</p>

<p>"Very good of you, I'm sure," Gees told him, and rose to his
feet to indicate that the interview was at an end. "Expect me in
time for dinner, the day after to-morrow, at&mdash;yes,
Dowlandsbar." He glanced at the address at the top of Tyrrell's
letter to get the name right.</p>

<p>Tyrrell, risen too, held out his hand. "I'll do my best to
make you comfortable in the wilds," he promised. "Since seeing
you, I've got faith in you, Mr. Green. I believe you may be able
to solve my problem."</p>

<p>"We'll see. I make no promises. But I'll do my best."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"A likeable chap," Gees observed to Miss Brandon after his
caller had gone. "Public school type, but not too much so. And
I've always had it in mind to have a look at the lake district,
though he's rather out of it, by what he says. Still, I can move
on, after killing the dog, or dogs. It's a dog killing his sheep,
that's all."</p>

<p>"And you say he's going to pay you fifty pounds to go and kill
it?" she asked, with patent incredulity.</p>

<p>"Ah, but he's got a bee about it being a ghost dog," Gees
pointed out. "The local police have exonerated all the dogs in a
twenty mile radius, he says&mdash;but I know from the time I
spent on my father's Shropshire estates that if a dog gets the
sheep-worrying habit, he'll travel far more than twenty miles in
a night to gratify his tastes."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" she began, and stopped, thinking it over.</p>

<p>"It's got him down," Gees explained. "There was a point in our
talk when I could see belief in the supernatural in his eyes. I
don't wonder. He lives eight miles from a station, and his local
is the best part of two miles from where he
lives&mdash;Dowlandsbar, heaven save us!"</p>

<p>"His local?" she asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Short for pub&mdash;the nearest bar to lean against," he
explained. "And his next door neighbor is half a mile away and
named McCoul, so what have you? I start early in the morning the
day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and I remain in charge here?"</p>

<p>"Obviously. Go over the inquiries as they come in each
morning&mdash; open all the letters whether they're marked
'Personal' or no. I've no low intrigues on, just now, so you
won't get shocked. Send editor's regrets in every case where you
feel it's possible, and if you come across anything interesting
write and say the matter is receiving consideration, and on
receipt of our initial fee of two guineas we shall be happy to
communicate further. Then send that particular inquiry on to me,
and I'll see what I think of it. Of course, if Tyrrell's
right&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off, and stood thoughtful by her desk for awhile.</p>

<p>"You mean, about the supernatural?" she inquired
eventually.</p>

<p>"It would be sub-natural, if anything, in a case of this
sort," he answered. "I'm going to spend the rest of the day in
the British Museum library, Miss Brandon, and when you've
finished discouraging the rest of our inquirers you can get on
with your novel. One of these days, there may be some work for
you again, and till then I like the decorative effect of having
you here. If I'm not back at your usual time for closing down,
just put the cover on your typewriter and go."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Green. Do you&mdash;do you think this is
super&mdash;no, sub-natural, as you called it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when I come back from Dowlandsbar." he
answered, "and since I don't start till the day after to-morrow,
that's some while ahead. But a nice holiday in the lake
district&mdash;or somewhere near it&mdash;before the end of
September, and a check for fifty pounds for taking it&mdash;well,
what have you? I'd be sub-natural myself if I didn't. See you
tomorrow morning, if not this evening, Miss Brandon."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Green."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER  II. &mdash;  BEYOND ODDER</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a one-armed, crankily-sagging signpost
beside the road, and, glancing up at it as he slowed, Gees read
on its decrepit arm</p>

<p class="sign">ODDER 3<br> DOWLANDSBAR 6</p> <br>

<p>and, having got too far past it by the time that he read his
destination thereon, braked to a stop, reversed, and then swung
the long bonnet of the Rolls-Bentley into the narrow, uneven way
indicated by the sign.</p>

<p>"The shades of night were falling fast," he quoted to himself,
"and if that lad had had to drive along a lane like this, it's
not 'Excelsior' he'd have been shouting to the landscape, but
Gordelpus."</p>

<p>The nose of the car went burrowing down and down, and the
narrow lane wound snakily until there appeared a hump-backed
bridge of grey stone, just wide enough to admit the car between
its weathered parapets. But, short of the bridge, Gees braked
suddenly to a standstill, for, looking down the bonnet into the
gathering gloom of evening, he saw the vanguard of a flock of
sheep on the hump of the bridge, and beyond them, as far as the
next bend of the lane, was a greyish mass of their fellows. They
went scuttering past the car, enveloping it in a woolly flood,
and darkness had advanced perceptibly when the shepherd, a tall,
gaunt, black being with a patient dog walking beside him, came
abreast.</p>

<p>"Good evening," Gees saluted him. "Am I right for
Dowlandsbar?"</p>

<p>"Aye, ye're right," said the shepherd, "an' can't go wrong.
Through Odder, an' 'tis but a step. Ye'll see the slats of the
roof above the trees. A long hoose&mdash;Squire Tyrrell's place.
Gude night to ye."</p>

<p>"Good night, and thank you," Gees answered, and went on.</p>

<p>As it had burrowed down to the bridge, so the nose of the long
car now sought heaven for awhile. The hard-pumped
tires&mdash;Gees always traveled with tires ten pounds above the
recommended pressure&mdash;bumped and scraped in the ruts of the
lane, and even with the perfect springing and steering of this
car ten miles an hour was the limit for safety. The crest of the
climb gave place to descent with such abruptness that Gees feared
lest his exhaust pipe should scrape on the summit of the ridge:
again he dipped down and down and down, until he saw four
cottages of grey stone, two on each side of the way, and beyond
them an inn which declared itself as the <i>Royal George</i>,
with, almost facing it, a slightly larger cottage with a brightly
lighted window in which were displayed bottles of old-fashioned
sweets, packages of much-advertised soaps, and cigarette
placards, together with a festoon of sausages.</p>

<p>"Odder," said Gees to himself, noting the white-lettered, blue
enamel plate which declared this emporium as a post office and
gave the name, "but it should be Much Odder".</p>

<p>By this time, he had switched on his headlights, and the
village slid into darkness behind him as the car wheels splashed
through a tiny rivulet that crossed his way without the formality
of a bridge.</p>

<p>He traveled another tortuous mile or so, dipping and lifting,
and then into the long ray of his headlights came a man who kept
to the middle of the lane and, as the car approached him, raised
his right hand above his head. Recognizing Tyrrell, Gees braked
to a standstill.</p>

<p>"It is you, of course," Tyrrell observed as he came abreast
the car. "I thought I'd come along and act as guide."</p>

<p>"Kind of you," Gees answered, and opened the near side door.
"I know now why you talk about fells in this part of the
world."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Tyrrell seated himself in the car as he spoke. "Why,
then?"</p>

<p>"Because when my radiator wasn't pointing horizontally upward
along this trail, it fell, and I wondered if I were going to fall
too&mdash;out over the windscreen. Yes, fells by all means,
here."</p>

<p>"That's an old one," Tyrrell told him. "I suppose you know
nearly everyone in the district has one leg longer than the
other?"</p>

<p>"I'll buy it," Gees offered. "Hereditary disability?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. Walking along the slopes of the hills does
it."</p>

<p>"They never come back, then," Gees reflected. "Well, I don't
wonder at it. What do I do&mdash;just go ahead?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;keep straight," Tyrrell bade.</p>

<p>"Since this lane would break a snake's back, I'll forgive you
for that advice," Gees promised. "But why guide me, if I can't go
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Because Locksborough Castle gateway is half a mile this side
of mine, and you'd probably have turned in at it if I hadn't come
along."</p>

<p>"If there's a borough round here, it's a rotten one," Gees
declared solemnly. "A sound one would have gone off to level
ground long ago."</p>

<p>"It never was a borough," Tyrrell told him. "Amber&mdash;he's
our vicar and a bit of an archaeologist&mdash;he explains it as a
corruption of barrow, Danish or more ancient, and the Norman
occupation didn't destroy the name, though they built a castle on
the site. Here&mdash;this is the gateway. No&mdash;bear to the
right, don't go in. That's why I met you."</p>

<p>Two rugged monoliths reared up almost directly in front of the
car, and Gees swerved sharply to the right to pass them and keep
to the uneven, narrow main way. Beyond them, as he passed, he
caught a glimpse of rugged, jagged-topped walls rising against
the clear night sky.</p>

<p>"Ruins," he observed. "I thought you said somebody lived
there?"</p>

<p>"It was possible to restore the keep&mdash;three floors of
it&mdash;to a habitable state, and McCoul bought the place and
did the restoring," Tyrrell explained. "The rest of it is still
ruinous. If he hadn't taken it, I think the ancient monuments
people would have taken it over. You know&mdash;the National
Trust. But McCoul is a bit of an antiquarian."</p>

<p>"And your nearest neighbor," Gees remembered, and felt that
his London flat and office, in which he had talked with this man
only two days before, was already several worlds and centuries
away.</p>

<p>"Yes. I&mdash;er&mdash;I hope you don't mind, but he and his
daughter Gyda are dining with us tonight. It was arranged before
I went to London, and I forgot about it when we arranged for you
to come today."</p>

<p>"Well, I packed a tuxedo, thank God," Gees reflected
piously.</p>

<p>"Well, really!" Tyrrell protested. "Did you think I wanted you
to bring your own provisions when I asked you to stay with
me?"</p>

<p>"A tuxedo," Gees explained, "is an apology for not dressing
for dinner&mdash;respectability without tails. You'd call it a
dinner jacket."</p>

<p>"Oh, sorry," Tyrrell apologized. "Here&mdash;turn in here.
Left."</p>

<p>Gees swung the wheel in time, and found himself on a graveled
drive which, after the bumpy, rutted lane, made driving a
pleasure.</p>

<p>"The term is American, I believe," he explained. "My father
wants to brain me every time he hears it, being a soldier of the
old school."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Tyrrell queried interestedly. "What regiment?"</p>

<p>"Oh, some obscure crowd of footsloggers for a
start&mdash;Coldstreams, as a matter of fact. But being a general
with a K.C.B., he doesn't brag about his regimental service. I
went for distinction when I joined up&mdash;the Metropolitan
police was my mark. But their discipline was so strict that I
chucked it after two years, and wished I'd gone for the army
instead, as the old man did. Still, it was useful for my present
business. What I don't know about police methods&mdash;well!"</p>

<p>He swung the car alongside a long frontage of grey stone, a
two-storied mansion with deeply set windows&mdash;most of it
showed plainly in the ray of the headlights before he swerved to
halt beside the deeply-receded, wide main entrance. A pendent
electric bulb in a quaint old lantern revealed a great oaken door
with vast hinges of scroll worked iron&mdash;it was an antique in
itself, that door, as Gees realized.</p>

<p>"Well, constable," Tyrrell observed, "you'll have good time
for a bath and change before dinner, if you feel like it. We'll
get your traps out, and then I'll show you where to stable this
beauty."</p>

<p>Gees followed him out from the car, and went to the back to
open it up and haul out his big suitcase. Then he turned to
Tyrrell.</p>

<p>"You're a good scout, and I like you," he said.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The floor boards of the room were old as time, with wide
cracks between them, and the floor sloped as, in a past age, the
foundations of the house had settled. The furniture was plainly
Jacobean, all but the full-length mirror, which, Gees decided,
was more probably Tudor, re-silvered. There was a press in which
he dared not hang his clothes lest he should never find them
again, so vast it was. And, like the floor, the ceiling beams
were black with age.</p>

<p>He made a final adjustment of his tie before the mirror: the
electric light by which he had dressed was incongruous in such an
apartment, and he could hear the engine, by which in all
probability the light was provided, pulsing somewhere. Beat,
beat&mdash;miss&mdash;beat&mdash;miss&mdash;beat, beat, beat.
Suction gas plant, he decided, and, opening his door, switched
off the light and passed along the corridor until he came to the
head of the staircase. There, for a moment or two, he paused.</p>

<p>The staircase itself was magnificent. Wide stairs curved down
to the big entrance hall of Dowlandsbar, and there was a
balustrade which was pure renaissance, black, like the floor and
ceiling beams in his room, with age, and so delicately carved as
to appear the work of a Cellini or Da Vinci. The hall into which
he gazed as he stood, for the moment unnoticed by the people
occupying it, had an oaken floor black and old as the rest of the
house's woodwork that he had seen so far, and there were rugs,
and little tables, and a great fireplace inside which Tyrrell
stood warming himself at a log fire, while, nearly facing him,
stood a man and a woman who for the period of this little pause
absorbed all Gees' attention.</p>

<p>The man, he decided, was somewhere in the fifties, and stood
well over six feet in height. His hair was iron grey, as was the
half of moustache that Gees could see&mdash;both the man and
woman were in profile to him. Of greyhound leanness, and with an
almost regal pose, the man accentuated his own height. Tyrrell
was tall, as was Gees himself, but this man appeared to stand
over him, look down on him&mdash;such was the impression Gees
gathered in this first view&mdash;and the profile was hawk-like,
finely, even beautifully molded. An arresting type, this man,
and, if his mentality were equal to his appearance, one worth
knowing.</p>

<p>And the woman, at a first glance, would be about the same age,
for her hair was snow-white, a crown of little ripples that shone
softly, like old satin in the lighting of the big hall. Gees saw
her more nearly three-quarter face than in profile, and saw that,
like the man, she had classically fine features&mdash;gazing down
from his height, he could not see their eyes&mdash;with richly
red lips almost too full for such a face, and daintily molded
chin over a neck that Praxiteles might have rejoiced to model.
She too was of unusual height, almost as tall as Gees himself,
and very slenderly-fashioned, with beautiful, ringless hands.
"Give her a bow and arrow," said Gees to himself as he began to
descend the stairs, "and there's Artemis&mdash;in grey crêpe-de-
chine or something of the sort. But what a pair!"</p>

<p>But, as he faced her and was introduced to Gyda McCoul, he
found his estimate of her age was wrong&mdash;the white hair had
misled him as he had looked down, for she was obviously still in
her twenties. Her eyes were amber and green&mdash;he could never
determine their real color, or whether they were green-flecked
amber or amber-flecked green. Either way, they completed as
bizarre an attractiveness as he had ever seen, though, as for a
moment he took her hand, he felt a sense of&mdash;was it fear? Or
was it that faint thrill that comes with the sight and
realization of something utterly new, an unhoped experience to be
faced? He could not tell, and he turned for his introduction to
the man and met the gaze of a pair of eyes as nearly black as any
he had seen. Here again was new experience: McCoul's eyes held
all the fire and light of youth, while his faintly-lined face was
that of one who has known all things&mdash;the face of a
disillusioned cynic and old, past belief.</p>

<p>These were first impressions, and then Tyrrell spoke:</p>

<p>"Mr. Green has driven all the way from London, so he ought to
be the hungriest of us all, if he isn't. But it's poured ready
for you, Green." And, with the final statement, he indicated a
cocktail glass on the occasional table by the corner of the
fireplace&mdash;the others, as Gees noted, already had their
glasses in their hands.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I'm superlatively hungry," he said as he
took up the glass and turned again to face the woman&mdash;or
girl, perhaps. "At present, I'm rather lost in amazement over
this miracle of a house. The little I've seen of it so far, that
is. What do you think of it, Miss McCoul? Don't you envy him his
collection of antiques?"</p>

<p>"She need not," Tyrrell put in, before she could reply.</p>

<p>"But I do," she said, after a brief pause in which Gees took
in Tyrrell's remark and prayed that he himself was not destined
to act alone in the matter of the sheep while his host went love-
making. And she smiled, revealing perfectly-even, shining white
teeth.</p>

<p>"From London in a day," McCoul remarked, and Gees glanced at
him to meet the gaze of his uncannily dark eyes&mdash;so dark
that there was no distinguishing between iris and pupil. "I
wonder what the legionaries marching north to the wall would have
thought of it?"</p>

<p>"We are not far from the old Roman wall, I suppose?" Gees
inquired.</p>

<p>"It's a goodish step," Tyrrell told him. "Mr. Green has come
here to help me with my sheep mystery," he explained to the other
two. "To put an end to the trouble, I hope. Two more killed last
night, Green&mdash;"</p>

<p>A voice from the side of the hall announcing that dinner was
served interrupted him, and the four of them passed through a
doorway under the staircase to a dining-room lighted only by the
candles on the table, and, like all the rest that Gees had seen
of the house, furnished in a way that would have made an antique-
collector choke with jealousy. As they seated themselves, Tyrrell
looked at Gees.</p>

<p>"Very plain feeding, you'll find," he observed. "My cook is no
Brillat-Savarin. You're in the wilds, here&mdash;all
primitive."</p>

<p>It was difficult of belief, Gees felt as he glanced at Gyda
McCoul's grey dinner frock, and then at her father's perfectly-
tailored jacket. A dumpily-built maid waited on them, and evinced
good training as she did it. But for the absence of a waiter in
tails, they might have been in one of the better class London
restaurants, and both soup and fish were as good as the service
and table appointments. A remark by Gees set them all talking of
place names&mdash;Oswaldstwhistle, Odder, Much Hadham, Nether
Wallop, Wig-Wig, and other curiosities of naming, provided light
chatter through which Gees observed that neither McCoul nor his
daughter appeared to appreciate the really good plain cooking of
the first two courses. Then the maid placed a dish before
Tyrrell, and, removing the cover, revealed a large joint of
beef.</p>

<p>"Plain fare, Green, as I warned you," Tyrrell observed. "Also
as a warning, it's underdone&mdash;very, because&mdash;well!" He
gave Gyda McCoul a glance which said she would understand and
appreciate what he meant.</p>

<p>"Specially for me and my father," she said, with pleasure in
her voice. "Oh, but you shouldn't, Mr. Tyrrell! Quite possibly
Mr. Green doesn't like it as underdone as we do&mdash;do you, Mr.
Green?"</p>

<p>"You can save a spot of the outside when it comes my turn,
Tyrrell," Gees counseled. In actuality, he hated underdone
meat.</p>

<p>Then he watched, and saw red slices&mdash;half-raw, they
looked to him&mdash;laid on the plates of the other two, while
Tyrrell reserved a portion of more fully cooked meat for himself
and Gees. And there was a hard glitter in McCoul's black eyes as
he looked down at the plate set before him: he may not have been
hungry at the beginning of the meal, but, if his expression went
for anything, he was avid for that red flesh, and the girl, too,
seemed to rouse to greater appreciation of her meal. Tyrrell,
himself, like Gees, took an outside cut.</p>

<p>"I did remark that I lost two more last night, didn't I?" he
asked as he helped himself to vegetables.</p>

<p>"You did," Gees assented. "I suppose you fold them at night
since this trouble started? Or do you leave them out and take the
risk?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they're folded, of course," Tyrrell answered, as if
surprised at the question, "and Cottrill&mdash;that's my
shepherd&mdash; he's kept watch night after night, but nothing
happens the nights he's on watch. Then, immediately he
relaxes&mdash;the very first night he thinks the trouble is
over&mdash;two more are killed. Always two&mdash; it's not the
promiscuous harrying and mangling you usually get when a dog
takes to sheep-worrying, but just two carcasses, and no trace of
what did it. More beef, Mr. McCoul?"</p>

<p>"I will have another slice, thanks," McCoul assented, and Gees
took his plate to pass it while Tyrrell carved red, dripping
stuff, nauseating to Gees' sight. It was not merely underdone,
but almost raw.</p>

<p>"And you, Miss McCoul?" Tyrrell asked, poising his carving
knife.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, even at the risk of being thought
greedy."</p>

<p>Again Tyrrell carved, and Gees got a glimpse of the girl's
teeth&mdash;beautiful, even teeth, between full, red lips that
needed no artificial coloring. She was innocent of make-up of any
kind, Gees decided, except for the powder that all women use.</p>

<p>"Always two, eh?" Gees observed, and shook his head as Tyrrell
gestured the invitation of a second helping at him. He emptied
his glass, and the maid refilled it with a burgundy that bespoke
a fine taste in vintages and careful ageing. "Clockwork
regularity."</p>

<p>"A fiendish sort of instinct," Tyrrell amended, "as if there
were more than instinct in it&mdash;some human knowledge behind
the mad things that do this. I've sat up all night with a gun,
and Mr. McCoul has kept watch with me several times this summer,
but&mdash; nothing. No sign of trouble, as long as there's anyone
about, and Cottrill is getting tired of constantly folding the
sheep in fine weather. It's no joke, rounding up the flock on
these hills night after night&mdash;and to no purpose."</p>

<p>"Except that you might have lost more, if you didn't," Gees
said.</p>

<p>"There is that, of course," Tyrrell assented moodily.</p>

<p>"Are you an expert at this sort of thing, Mr. Green?" the girl
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, my father has a little place in Shropshire&mdash;runs
one of the few surviving herds of aurochs on it, and some sheep,"
Gees explained, though he hated the sight of the general's
Shropshire estate. "I would hardly call myself an
expert&mdash;just cognizant, say."</p>

<p>"General Sir George Green, that is?" McCoul asked
interestedly.</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;he is ex-service," Gees answered, "though most
men of his age are, nowadays. Why, do you know him, sir?"</p>

<p>McCoul shook his head. "The aurochs," he explained. "I had the
pleasure of seeing the herd, once. No, I have not met your
father."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Green!" Gyda McCoul laughed, and something in the
laugh reminded Gees of the sound he had made as a child by
tapping pendent glass lusters with a long nail. "A little place,
you call it. I was there with my father to see the aurochs, and
it's a wonderful estate!"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what the income-tax people think," he conceded
without enthusiasm, "which makes my father's life one long strain
on two ends that refuse to meet. An estate is the very deuce, and
when my turn comes to inherit&mdash;heaven keep it away and the
old chap alive for years yet&mdash;I shall sell it and give the
aurochs to the Zoo, or something."</p>

<p>"Then you must be the Mr. Green who calls himself
Gees&mdash;the one who became famous over the Kestwell case?"
McCoul suggested.</p>

<p>Gees gave him a steady stare, and not a friendly one&mdash;it
was not McCoul he hated at that moment, but himself, for
betraying his identity, and Tyrrell for revealing his purpose in
being here to these people.</p>

<p>"Quite accidentally," he said. "I didn't do anything,
really."</p>

<p>"Enough to make me feel you'd be the man to save the rest of
my sheep," Tyrrell put in. "Though there's no similarity in the
cases, of course&mdash;Anarchists, or whatever you like to call
that gang you ran to earth, are not exactly like mad dogs with
extra intelligence."</p>

<p>"I fail to see any difference," Gees dissented.</p>

<p>He saw McCoul nod appreciation of his remark. The talk flowed
on, and all the while Gees watched and studied this amazing pair.
For they were amazing: there was a vitality about McCoul which
belonged to a world-beating athlete in his early twenties rather
than to a grey-headed man with a grown-up daughter, and the girl
herself, equally vital and alive, betrayed ever and again a range
of knowledge and worldly-wisdom more characteristic of a middle-
aged woman than one of her age. And in the mellow light of the
candles, that white hair of hers was like ripples of purest sea-
foam on wave crests, and her eyes deepened to a darkness that was
more amethyst and emerald than mere amber and green&mdash;Gees
saw or imagined a wistful tenderness in them, once, as she gazed
across at Tyrrell, and felt anew that he must go dog-hunting
alone.</p>

<p>"Gyda?" he echoed the name after McCoul had spoken it in
addressing her. "What an unusual name&mdash;unusually attractive,
I mean."</p>

<p>"A corruption of Bridget," McCoul explained as she smiled at
Gees. "Or rather, of Brigid, which is the form I prefer."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you trace descent from Finn McCoul?" Gees half-
asked, with the very faintest hint of amusement in the query.</p>

<p>"There is no reason why Finn should have been given more
prominence than many others," McCoul said with a frown. "We were
kings in Ireland before the O'Neills had won to
chieftainship."</p>

<p>"Was Eochaid one of the family?" Gees inquired
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Eochaid?" Gyda fired out the name sharply, almost
fearfully.</p>

<p>He gave her a steady look. "Married Etain of the fairy folk,"
he said, "and had his year. Dalua warned him at the start, I
believe&mdash;the whole story has been told by Fiona McLeod,
which is how I know."</p>

<p>"I see." She relaxed, patently relieved by the explanation,
and McCoul gave an audible sigh, as might a man after passing a
dangerous moment. Tyrrell offered liqueurs, and a discussion of
the relative merits of Cointreau and old liqueur brandy swept
away a brief but not less real tension. For a moment, Gees knew,
Gyda McCoul had been definitely afraid. Of what, he questioned
inwardly?</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Another brief moment of tension arose later, just before
father and daughter set out for home, when Tyrrell observed that
the neighborhood was rich in antiquities, and Gees, remembering a
previous remark of his in connection with archeology,
questioned:</p>

<p>"You said the vicar was strong on it, I believed? Amber, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It is," Tyrrell answered, after an awkward silence.</p>

<p>"There is a feud, Mr. Green," Gyda explained, coming to the
rescue. "My father and Mr. Amber hate each other&mdash;you didn't
know, of course."</p>

<p>"I see," he said. "It was evident that I'd dropped a brick of
some sort, but naturally I didn't know anything about it."</p>

<p>Being by this time very much alive to impressions, he sensed
more in the momentary tension than the mere quarrel between the
two men. An expression in Tyrrell's eyes indefinable beyond that
it was a decidedly unhappy look, went to show that he was
involved, in some way. Then McCoul decided on going, and Tyrrell
offered to walk as far as his gateway with him and his
daughter.</p>

<p>"In that case," Gees remarked, "I'd like to act escort
too."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must be tired, after driving from London today,"
Gyda protested. "And we don't need an escort at all, really."</p>

<p>But Gees saw Tyrrell's gaze at her, and knew he would be doing
the man a good turn if he could manage to pair with her father.
"I insist," he said, "if only as exercise after sitting still all
day."</p>

<p>Eventually they set out, and Gees' maneuvering placed him
ahead beside McCoul, with the other two following. The September
night was mild and fine, and they went coatless and hatless into
the light of the moon a day or two past its full, along the
graveled drive and out to the rutted lane. At first, Tyrrell's
and Gyda McCoul's voice sounded to Gees and her father as they
walked, but McCoul took long strides, and the voices in rear
faded out&mdash;as Gees knew they would.</p>

<p>"Not your first visit to Cumberland, surely, Mr. Green?"
McCoul asked in consequence of a remark Gees had made on the
quality of the lane.</p>

<p>"Not the first&mdash;no," he answered, "for I went through
Carlisle in a sleeping berth on my way to Aberdeen and that's
Cumberland, of course. Came back east coast, so I didn't see much
of the district."</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't," McCoul observed, and his tone suggested
that he resented having his leg pulled.</p>

<p>"It would be an interesting county, if it were ironed out,"
Gees said.</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand," McCoul admitted stiffly.</p>

<p>"Well, there'd be so much more of it if it were flattened,"
Gees pointed out brightly. "So much is up-ended. A hill or two
here and there&mdash;yes, but when it's all in roof
sections&mdash;well, where are you?"</p>

<p>"In Cumberland, apparently," McCoul said coldly.</p>

<p>"That's how it struck me," Gees assented. "And eerie, too,
especially in moonlight like this. As if one might see the Daoine
Shih peering from behind a crag like that." He pointed, as he
spoke, to a hump of grey rock showing a score yards beyond the
low stone wall that bounded the lane. "And a crock of gold under
the rock," he ended.</p>

<p>"What do you know of the Daoine Shih?" McCoul demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, one picks up things, here and there," Gees evaded with
surface carelessness. "Legends, you know, and all that sort of
thing. I've always felt sorry for Eochaid&mdash;any human would,
I think."</p>

<p>"You seem to have that legend on your mind," McCoul
accused.</p>

<p>"Not more than a good many others. I'm merely interested, and
Tyrrell told me you had antiquarian tastes. Lived here long?"</p>

<p>"We arrived in March," McCoul answered. "I bought the castle
last year, but it took some time to make any of it habitable.
There was nothing but the bare walls when I bought it."</p>

<p>"And the servant problem?" Gees asked. "How does Miss McCoul
manage about that? It's difficult to get servants in a place like
this, surely&mdash;that is, I don't really know if it is, of
course."</p>

<p>"I brought a kern from the wilds of Gallway, and he does
nearly everything for us," McCoul explained. "One of my own
clan."</p>

<p>"Galway, eh?" Gees reflected aloud. "I must go to Ireland,
some day. The wild and woolly part of it, I mean&mdash;get
impressions."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know Ireland either?" McCoul inquired
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Well, nothing to speak of," Gees confessed. "I've done the
ritual tour of Killarney and drunk Guinness in Dublin, and I own
to having been in a faction fight near Cork, long ago, but the
real Ireland, the land of the Daoine Shih&mdash;no. I must look
it up."</p>

<p>By that time, they had come in sight of the two stone pillars
beyond which the rugged walls of Locksborough Castle reared upon
a hillock, distinct and ruinous in the moonlight. McCoul halted
and looked back: Tyrrell and Gyda were just in sight, and her
silver-white head was very close to her companion's, Gees saw as
he too looked back.</p>

<p>"Now what do you know of the fairy folk?" McCoul
demanded&mdash;there was a trace of menace in the query, as Gees
realized.</p>

<p>"Legend only, as I told you before," he said cheerfully.
"But&mdash; these pillars." He nodded at the two gigantic stones
which marked the entrance to the castle grounds. "Never used as
posts, surely?"</p>

<p>"I really couldn't say," McCoul answered stiffly.</p>

<p>"Stonehenge would be far more perfect if the people of a
century or two ago hadn't broken up some of the stones for road
making," Gees pursued meditatively, ignoring his companion's
resentment. "And Avebury&mdash;Avebury is a tragedy, from the
point of view of anyone with a respect for the old beliefs. These
pillars remind me of Avebury&mdash;they belonged to something
much bigger, once. In the days when the Daoine Shih were not
afraid to show themselves&mdash;but men feared instead."</p>

<p>"You're a strange man, Mr. Green," McCoul said with odd
abruptness.</p>

<p>"What man isn't?" Gees retorted, gazing straight into the
black eyes&mdash;in that light they were quite black&mdash;that
searched for hidden meanings in his words. "We're all strangers
to each other."</p>

<p>McCoul gave him no answer. The other two came up with them,
and Gyda McCoul smiled at Gees&mdash;she looked unearthly, a
slender, perfect figure with her uncovered white hair shining in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful night, Mr. Green," she said softly.</p>

<p>So very softly, almost as if the words embodied a temptation,
and yet, to him, her voice was like metal striking on glass
lustres, a glassy tinkling&mdash;or the touch on a knife blade on
a plate on which half-raw beef dripped redly. He could not forget
that beef.</p>

<p>"Marvelous," he assented. "I'd like to roam about these
hills&mdash; except that I should probably get lost and caught by
the fairy folk."</p>

<p>"Mr. Green has the fairy folk on his brain," McCoul put in
coldly. "For tonight, he appears able to talk of nothing
else."</p>

<p>"But it is none too warm," the girl said with an abrupt change
of manner&mdash;to Gees it seemed that she shrank from him
suddenly. "So many thanks to you for a delightful evening, Mr.
Tyrrell. Good-night, Mr. Green&mdash;we shall meet again, I
expect. Father, we must go."</p>

<p>It was dismissal, and Tyrrell, realizing it, took her hand and
kissed it before bidding good night to McCoul&mdash;Gees
contented himself with a more formal parting. Then the two stood
and watched while father and daughter walked between the
monoliths and on toward the old castle. Not till they were within
the shadow of its wall did either speak. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pretty far gone, aren't you?" Gees queried acidly.</p>

<p>"It was not for that I agreed to your coming here, was it?"
Tyrrell retorted, with a trace of real anger.</p>

<p>"Possibly not," Gees said equably, "but I managed you a
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with the lady, and I'm so dog-tired I wouldn't
care if you carried me back. I haven't had such an interesting
evening since I ditched an airplane in the sea off Worthing.
Let's go home, shall we?"</p>

<p>"By all means," Tyrrell assented coldly.</p>

<p>"No good, like that," Gees said, and did not move. "You
fetched me here&mdash;at fifty pounds a week, to get at the
bottom of a mystery for you, and I've started on the job already.
If you're going all icy, I'll forego my wage and start back to-
morrow. Do we carry on, or do we carry on? You're the finance of
the business."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?" Tyrrell asked, evidently mystified.</p>

<p>"That I am the hired man," Gees told him. "Do I carry on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be a blasted fool, man!" Tyrrell adjured with
sudden heartiness. "Of course you carry on. I'm sorry&mdash;I
ought to have known you took this walk because of me, and you
must be nearly falling asleep as you talk, after that drive
today. What have you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Gees interrupted ruthlessly. "Give me a few hours
to arrange my impressions. I believe I've jumped into something
big, big and old. And I haven't been here ten minutes, yet. Let's
go home."</p>

<p>But, before turning to go, he gazed up at the reared stones
that marked the gateway, and at the part-ruined castle on its
mound beyond.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER  III. &mdash;  COTTRILL</h2>

<p class="first">TWEED-JACKETED, and wearing a pair of jodhpurs
he had thought at the last moment to thrust into his suitcase
before leaving London, Gees mounted a stubby little pony and
urged it to catch up with Tyrrell, who in breeches and leggings
was already riding a similar pony away from the long frontage of
Dowlandsbar. They rode down the graveled drive and out to the
rutted lane, where Tyrrell turned east, away from Locksborough
Castle and Odder. It was a still morning with some of the warmth
of summer about it, and a bluish haze veiling the rugged ridges
among which they rode. Glancing back before they began their
descent into the first deep hollow, Gees saw the two monoliths
which marked the entry to McCoul's habitation, and the castle
itself, ruinous except for the square, massive grey keep, a
rambling jumble of broken-down walls set on its little height,
and surrounded by grass-grown earthworks which reminded him of
Maiden Castle in Dorset, though they were of not such tremendous
proportions as that old stronghold.</p>

<p>"And this lane leads where?" he asked, noting the grass that
grew between the ruts, and evidence of little care and less
use.</p>

<p>"It will bring you out on to the main Carlisle road," Tyrrell
answered, "about eight miles away. You can give your pony his
head&mdash;he won't let you down. But with that car of yours, I'd
advise you to go back the way you came. This lane is no joke for
a car, in this direction. There are only two farms, and it gets
worse as it goes on."</p>

<p>"I'd call it one big joke all the way," Gees comment sourly.
"Why don't you do something about it&mdash;make a road of it,
say?"</p>

<p>Tyrrell shook his head. "I want it kept like this," he
explained. "Otherwise, tourists and char-à-bancs, and all the
rest of it."</p>

<p>"Something in that, of course," Gees remarked. "Look here, I
did some thinking over the early tea your maid brought me. Has
anyone beside you been losing sheep or are you the only one?"</p>

<p>"As far as I know, I'm the only sufferer," Tyrrell
answered.</p>

<p>"Umm-m! And how does your land run&mdash;who are
neighbors?</p>

<p>"Toward Odder, McCoul is next me," Tyrrell explained. "About
two hundred acres go with the castle, most it useless ground,
heather and stones. On this side, a man named Bandon is tenant of
the farm that joins on to land, and he doesn't run sheep&mdash;he
has a dairy farm of sorts, and you can't graze cattle on land
that sheep have been over, as probably you know. And both north a
south is waste land&mdash;as is a good deal of mine, for that
matter. We turn off, here."</p>

<p>He swung his pony to the right and passed through an opening
in the low stone wall, and Gees, following noted the rough three-
barred gate that guarded the opening&mdash;it was no more than a
rude hurdle&mdash;laid against the farther side of the wall. They
faced a declivity of&mdash;for one unused to the country,
appalling steepness, and Gees drew rein.</p>

<p>"Give him his head," Tyrrell advised. "I'll show the way."</p>

<p>And they rode down, while Gees queried inward whether he would
slide along his pony's neck and over its head, but, with Tyrrell
leading, came safely to comparative level, a sheltered area of
three or four acres of rich grass land, cropped close inside a
large sheep fold that was empty, now, except for a small, dark
man and a patient dog, and two woolly things lying beside one of
the hurdles that formed the fold.</p>

<p>"That's Cottrill," Tyrrell stated as he dismounted at the
entrance to the fold, and Gees followed suit. They tied their
reins to one of the hurdles. "I told him to leave those
carcasses&mdash;wanted you to see them and get some
idea&mdash;we'll have a word with him, first."</p>

<p>He led on, and Gees, following, found himself facing a sturdy,
honest-looking little man of nearly middle age, with dog-like
brown eyes and close-clipped black beard and moustache, who
touched his hat at Tyrrell and gave this stranger an inquiring
glance.</p>

<p>"Cottrill&mdash;my shepherd, Green," Tyrrell stated.
"Cottrill, this is Mr. Green, who is going to put an end to our
troubles. I brought him to have a look at these two carcasses
before you burn them."</p>

<p>Gees offered his hand, and the man gripped it firmly, while
Tyrrell let his eyebrows go up at this acknowledgment of the
introduction.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, sir," Cottrill said, in a pleasant voice
with hardly any trace of dialect in it, "and I hope the master's
right about you."</p>

<p>"He's a bit optimistic, perhaps," Gees remarked. "You have had
six months of this trouble, I understand, and all the killings in
pairs."</p>

<p>"That's so, sir. A sort of what you might call method about
it. I've come across sheep-worrying dogs in my time, but never
anything like this. It's got on my nerves, to tell the truth.
I'm&mdash;well, scared."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Gees observed. "Any special reason for being
scared?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Cottrill glanced at his master, and caught a nod
which invited him to be as frank as he liked. "The devilish
calculation of it&mdash;not like ordinary sheep-worrying. I've
sat up night after night, and the master's sat up, and even Mr.
McCoul from the castle has watched with him this summer, and as
long as we watch&mdash;nothing! But as soon as we don't
watch&mdash;well, there's another two done in. As if them things
had knowledge, not like animals, but more like humans. And it's
gettin' me down. Because, you see, the sheep are my people, as
you might say."</p>

<p>"I know," Gees said. "You take it as against yourself."</p>

<p>"I'd trust Cottrill to do his damndest," Tyrrell put in.</p>

<p>"I've done it, sir," the man said. "But&mdash;they're too much
for me."</p>

<p>"They?" Gees asked. "More than one, then?"</p>

<p>"Two, sir," Cottrill answered. "I sighted 'em, back in
May."</p>

<p>"You never told me this." Gees turned to Tyrrell,
accusingly.</p>

<p>"I thought it better for him to tell you," Tyrrell answered.
"He's the one who saw them. Tell that tale, Cottrill."</p>

<p>"It'd be about the middle of May," the shepherd said. "I'd
begun this folding, of course, and we'd had a fortnight clear of
these things, with me watching every night&mdash;that was after
we'd put the police on to it, and much use <i>they</i> are, too!
Mr. Tyrrell said I needn't watch, that night, so I was on my way
home&mdash;there was a bit of mist come in off the sea, and it
was gettin' dark, and dimmish like as I went off to my home.
About a couple of miles away from where I was folding 'em,
then&mdash;another bit of grass rather like this, only away over
there"&mdash;he pointed up to the summit of a ridge away from the
lane&mdash;"and I hadn't a gun with me, that night. And I saw
'em, two of 'em&mdash;grey shapes away in the mist&mdash;just
glimpsed 'em for a moment. Great things like donkeys."</p>

<p>"Long-eared, eh?" Gees surmised thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No, I couldn't say I saw any ears. The size of donkeys, I
mean. They showed up against the sky, and I went after 'em, but,
of course, I couldn't find anything. Then I went off back to the
fold as quick as I could, and got there in time to find two
carcasses all mangled like the two over there"&mdash;he nodded at
where the two carcasses lay&mdash;"and no sign of pad-marks nor
nothing to tell me where them things come from or where they
went&mdash;and there's never been any sign to guide us, either.
That sight of 'em I got&mdash;just the grey shapes, and no
more."</p>

<p>"And you went back," Gees observed, marveling at the courage
of the man who had thought nothing of going back to his sheep
when two ravening beasts, "the size of donkeys," had been
abroad.</p>

<p>"As I'm tellin' you, sir," Cottrill said. "But Jimmy
here"&mdash;he gestured at his dog, which looked up at mention of
his name&mdash; "I've never known him act as he did then. Turned
reg'lar coward, he did&mdash;stuck his tail between his legs and
whined and cringed&mdash; didn't you, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>The dog stood up to wag his tail at being addressed, and then
again sat down and gazed at his master. He was of nondescript
breed, Gees saw, more collie than anything, sturdily built and
shaggy.</p>

<p>"Something he didn't like facing, eh?" Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"Something he would not face, sir," the man amended. "Stuck
behind me, and when I touched him he was all quivering with
fright. I tell you, sir, just as I've told the master, them grey
things are more than dogs. They're devils, and know as much as
devils know. Lord, if only I'd had my gun, that night! If only to
make a blood trail to follow."</p>

<p>"Put that more plainly, Cottrill," Gees invited. "Devils, you
say&mdash;what do you mean by devils?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I've had Jimmy here from a pup, and trained him up
to his job. The sweetest tempered dog in a hundred mile, and as
brave as a lion, against anything he can understand&mdash;things
that live like him and me and you, sir, if you don't mind my
puttin' it that way. And if he puts his tail between his legs and
goes all trembly, it's because of something he can't understand,
if you get me, sir. Unearthly, I'd say."</p>

<p>"Things that live like him and me and you." Gees picked out
the words and echoed them thoughtfully as he gazed at the
dog.</p>

<p>"There you are!" Tyrrell exclaimed, with a note of
exasperation. "Cottrill's got it&mdash;even Moore, the policeman,
looks at it like that, I believe! They're all set on believing
there's something unearthly about this&mdash;but ghosts don't go
in for material killings like those." He nodded at the two
carcasses lying beyond them, inside the fold.</p>

<p>"And you're bitten by the same bug yourself," Gees
accused.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think," Tyrrell owned.</p>

<p>"You're not a native of this district, are you?" Gees turned
to the shepherd and addressed the question to him.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir," the man answered with a smile. "Born an' bred
here, an' my father was shepherd at Dowlandsbar before me."</p>

<p>"But you don't talk like a native," Gees persisted. "What have
you done with your Cumberland dialect, if you were born
here?"</p>

<p>Again Cottrill smiled. "Well, you see, sir, there was the
war&mdash;I was just a bit of a boy when I joined up in time to
do a bit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Military Cross," Tyrrell put in, "and recommended for a
commission."</p>

<p>"Which I didn't want," Cottrill went on, "and after I got
demobbed I thought I'd see a bit of the world. So I went out to
the States and did a bit of roving there, got off to Peru down
the west coast an' went across the Andes to Buenos
Aires&mdash;fooled about, as you might say, sir, on this job an'
that job. But all the time I could see these fells&mdash;they
pulled me back at the finish, an' here I am an' here I'll
stop."</p>

<p>"Believing that some things don't live like him and me and
you." Gees stooped and patted the dog as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, sir, but keepin' an open mind. These
fells&mdash;</p>

<p>He did not end it, but looked up at the heights about them.
They were in a basin-like depression, pierced at its northern end
by a narrow cut, along which flowed the tiny rivulet which had
its source in a spring on the eastern hillside. And, as Cottrill
ceased speaking, Gees felt the utter silence as a thing almost
tangible: there was no breath of wind, no token of life of any
kind on the hills that shut them in-until a solitary carrion crow
sailed over them, a black and ominous thing against the hazed and
cloudless sky.</p>

<p>"You were saying&mdash;?" Gees asked, after a long pause.</p>

<p>"An open mind, sir," the man answered. "Here we've got
sunshine&mdash; full day&mdash;and it's difficult to believe
anything but what you see. But after nightfall it's
different&mdash;the fells have their own secrets. Before Mr.
McCoul took the castle an' had it repaired to live in, I doubt if
you'd get anyone in Odder to come past that gateway in the dark.
It's old, a graveyard of the very old dead, the people who were
here in the very beginning of things, an' they say they can
feel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rank superstition, Cottrill!" Tyrrell broke in impatiently.
"As a man who has seen the world, you ought to know better than
to give heed to those old women's tales. And we came here for Mr.
Green to see these carcasses&mdash;the way they were killed is
real and material enough, with no ghastliness about it. You can't
accuse a ghost of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, though," Gees interrupted in turn. "What tales do they
tell of the castle, Cottrill? What was it&mdash;did anyone see a
ghost there?"</p>

<p>Cottrill shook his head. "No, sir&mdash;I never heard of
anyone seeing anything. But the feel of it&mdash;even in
daylight."</p>

<p>"That is, until Mr. and Miss McCoul came to live there, and
humanised it again?" Gees suggested, ignoring Tyrrell's evident
impatience.</p>

<p>"I suppose so, sir. I haven't heard so much about it since
they came to live in it. Not that that would have anything to do
with our losin' sheep like this, though. I just told you because
you asked."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;thank you very much, Cottrill. Now we'll look at
these sheep, since that was the idea in coming here&mdash;eh,
Tyrrell?"</p>

<p>"It was," Tyrrell answered shortly, and moved toward the
carcasses.</p>

<p>The other two followed him, and the dog got up and padded
sedately beside his master until they had walked nearly halfway
across the fold. But then, abruptly, Jimmy stopped, whined, and
sat down, looking up at Cottrill with eyes as nearly human as a
dog's can be, and in them an expression half-fearful, half-
pleading. Gees stopped to observe him.</p>

<p>"That's curious," he remarked.</p>

<p>"He's been the same every time, sir," Cottrill said.</p>

<p>"I'd have to carry him to get him near them corpses, and even
then he'd fight to break away from me an' darned near bite me to
do it. An' him that'd tackle anything on four legs or two, if I
set him at it. Jimmy!"</p>

<p>With the last word he called to the dog, and both Gees and
Tyrrell stopped to watch. But Jimmy crouched down fearfully and
whined, evidently more fearful of obeying the call than of what
might happen to him for refusing. Cottrill went back and patted
him, and he thumped the ground with his tail once or twice, as if
glad of this absolution.</p>

<p>"Now, Jimmy&mdash;come on, old chap!" Cottrill adjured
him.</p>

<p>But again the dog crouched and whined, in abject fear.</p>

<p>"All right, then," Cottrill said reassuringly, and turned to
go on. "He's never disobeyed me about anything else," he
explained, "an' I'd trust him with anything, anywhere. But this
is&mdash;well, too much for him to stand, by the look of it. He
won't go near 'em."</p>

<p>Following him and Tyrrell, Gees looked down at the two
horribly mangled carcasses. "I don't wonder," he said rather
grimly. "But"&mdash;he bent over one of them&mdash;"ripped and
torn like that, and no blood?"</p>

<p>"There never is, sir," Cottrill said.</p>

<p>Bending down, Gees took hold of a foreleg and turned the stiff
carcass over so that it lay on its back. There was a great, ugly
tear beginning at the throat of the animal, and running back to
its shoulder, and the flap of fleece and skin hung loosely back,
showing the bloodless flesh torn and gnawed&mdash;where the meat
should have been thickest, bone gleamed whitely. And the mangling
of the rest of it was sickening to see.</p>

<p>"They always drink all the blood like that, sir," Cottrill
said in a matter-of-fact way, "an' then have a feed off the
meat."</p>

<p>Gees straightened himself. "Two killed like this, every time?"
he asked, gazing at the other, equally mangled carcass.</p>

<p>"No more, an' no less," the shepherd confirmed him.</p>

<p>Gees looked back at the dog, down with his head on his
forepaws, now, faced toward them and watchful. Again the silence
wrapped round him like a fourth presence here. Then Tyrrell
moved, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you make of it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing, yet," Gees answered imperturbably. "Give me
time."</p>

<p>He snuffed at the air as might a hound seeking a scent.</p>

<p>Then he took a petrol lighter from his pocket, flicked it, and
held it up. The tiny flame stood straight&mdash;there was no
breeze to deflect it.</p>

<p>"Do you smell anything?" he asked of Cottrill.</p>

<p>"Ah, I wondered if you'd get it too, sir," the man said.</p>

<p>"What do you get?" Gees asked, putting his lighter away.</p>

<p>"It's like&mdash;an' yet not like&mdash;the wires in front of
Passchendaele, sir," Cottrill said slowly. "I was there, an' the
corpses hung an' rotted on the wire, an' the smell, when the wind
drove it&mdash;like what I get after one of these killin's, and
yet not like it. This is fouler."</p>

<p>"Very faint, but foul, as you say," Gees confirmed him. "But
it doesn't come from those." He nodded at the carcasses before
him.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not from them," Cottrill said gravely.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you two talking about?" Tyrrell demanded.
"I can't smell anything unusual." And he too sniffed, and shook
his head.</p>

<p>Gees disregarded him. "Cottrill," he said, "when the police
took it up&mdash;at least, I suppose they took it up&mdash;what
did they do?"</p>

<p>"Had a search for dogs all round," the shepherd answered, "an'
couldn't find one they could blame, anywhere, let alone two. Then
Inspector Feather&mdash;he's the big noise around here&mdash;he
asked me to let him know instantly the next killing happened, an'
he brought a blood-hound to see if he could track the things that
did it."</p>

<p>"And the bloodhound?" Gees asked&mdash;though he felt he knew
the answer.</p>

<p>"Just like Jimmy there." Cottrill nodded at his waiting dog.
"They couldn't get it near the killings, an' when they made a
cast round with it, it just shivered an' crouched an' wouldn't
work&mdash;wouldn't even try for a scent. An' I remember that
scent you picked up&mdash;just now was much stronger,
then&mdash;it was fair hellish. But the hound wouldn't take
it."</p>

<p>"I must see this Inspector Feather," Gees half-mused. "What
are his views now&mdash;I suppose you still report the
killings."</p>

<p>"I do," Tyrrell put in, "and I've raved at him. Also he's had
six men on watch for a week on end, all with shotguns, and never
a trigger was pulled. While they watched, nothing
happened&mdash;as always."</p>

<p>"Well, what does he do now?" Gees persisted.</p>

<p>"Comes up and sees me, and regrets. To hell with his regrets!
Offers to keep men on watch as long as I like and what's the use?
He could keep men on for six months, if he would, and the night
after they go off it would happen again. It always does, when
Cottrill gets a night's sleep. I feel like rounding up every
sheep I own and putting them into a sale yard, except that I hate
being beaten."</p>

<p>"You're not beaten, yet," Gees said thoughtfully. "Neither am
I."</p>

<p>"Do you mean you're going to put an end to it, then?" Tyrrell
asked.</p>

<p>Gees gave him a whimsical sort of smile. "As I asked
before&mdash;give me time," he answered. "I want to see several
people, including this Inspector Feather and some of his men,
and"&mdash;he turned to Cottrill&mdash;"for awhile I'm going to
leave you alone, as far as looking after the sheep is concerned.
You may have one or two more killings before I come in to stop
them, but I may want to talk to you at times."</p>

<p>Cottrill shook his head. "The sheep are my people," he
said.</p>

<p>"I know," Gees assented, "but&mdash;without being
irreverent&mdash;it is expedient that two should die&mdash;or
four should die&mdash;for the rest. For the present, I am not
watching sheep, but going straight for the things that play hell
with them, and&mdash;as you've noted already&mdash;drink
blood."</p>

<p>"Vampires?" Cottrill only half-questioned.</p>

<p>"No. You're a thinking being, Cottrill, so it's safe to tell
you I'm not sure what they are. I've got to find out, first."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, sir," Cottrill said earnestly. "I wouldn't
wonder if you did get to the bottom of it. I'll do just as you
say."</p>

<p>"Then carry on, you and Mr. Tyrrell, as if I were not
here&mdash;until I feel like getting busy at the sheep end. I'm
on the other end, first."</p>

<p>"Not dogs?" Again it was only half a question.</p>

<p>Gees smiled. "Perhaps dogs," he said. "Except&mdash;that
smell."</p>

<p>"I get you, sir," and Cottrill smiled. "Half-dogs, say."</p>

<p>"And what the hell all this means&mdash;" Tyrrell began, and
broke off.</p>

<p>"There's a good deal of hell about it, as Cottrill has found
out," Gees told him. "Or rather, a state between earth and
hell&mdash; this is about the most interesting business I've run
up against since I ditched an airplane in the sea off
Worthing&mdash;and made money out of it."</p>

<p>With a last glance at the two carcasses, he turned away.</p>

<p>"I've seen enough, and heard more," he remarked. "I've got a
hunger I wouldn't sell, and I suppose you do have lunch, at
Dowlandsbar&mdash;what a glorious name for any place! Do we go
back, or do we go back?"</p>

<p>Tyrrell, making no reply, walked beside him. As they neared
the dog it stood up, gazing anxiously up at its master.</p>

<p>"Good old Jimmy!" Cottrill said encouragingly, and the dog
wagged his tail vigorously. "We're both scared, an' you're honest
about it."</p>

<p>"By the way"&mdash;Gees stopped abruptly&mdash;"what do you do
with those?" He turned his head to nod at the two carcasses they
had left.</p>

<p>"Burn 'em," Tyrrell answered. "They'll be carted to a heap of
brushwood and stuff at Dowlandsbar, and a few cans of paraffin
make sure of their being altogether destroyed. Nobody would touch
that meat."</p>

<p>"Which goes to show that the bug has bitten you too," Gees
observed. "Well, Cottrill, we shall meet again. I don't blame you
for being scared. It's natural, considering everything."</p>

<p>"Glad to've met you, sir," the man said, with a hint of
earnestness.</p>

<p>"And I you," Gees answered sincerely.</p>

<p>He untied his pony and mounted to return, his feet looking
bigger than ever as they hung down below the turn-ups of the
jodhpurs. Tyrrell led the way up to the lane.</p>

<p>"Think you've got to the bottom of it, do you?" he asked as
Gees came abreast of him beyond the stone wall. There was a trace
of derision in the query.</p>

<p>"As far down as the neck," Gees answered imperturbably, "and
I've got to get all the way down to the feet and the ground under
them. Don't be so damned impatient&mdash;I've not been here a
day, yet."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash;  INSPECTOR FEATHER</h2>

<p class="first">EXTERIORLY, as Gees decided when he came out
from the house after a huge and satisfying lunch with his host,
Dowlandsbar was utterly devoid of architectural pretensions: it
was no more than a big, oblong stone box, divided into
compartments by the interior partitioning walls and dumped on a
ledge of a hillside so that it faced south-west&mdash;if the
ledge had been artificially terraced in the side of the hill, the
work had been done so long ago that no trace of it remained. The
thickness of the grey stone walls was that of a fortress, and, as
Gees had already noted, the interior walls were of little less
solidity. Slate-roofed above its two stories, it was a grim-
looking habitation&mdash;but inside was a treasure house of the
handicraft of past ages. There was a huddle of outbuildings
tucked away at the inner end of the house, viewing it from the
lane, and before it, over the ridge that it faced, showed the
ragged tops of Locksborough Castle's ruined walls, with the
boxlike keep rising apparently undamaged in their midst, its
arrow-slit windows and even the machicolations that crowned it
intact. No other dwelling-house or building was in sight.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you some things," Gees stated, as Tyrrell came
to stand beside him. "To begin with, how many men do you
employ?"</p>

<p>"Six&mdash;eight, altogether, and three maids in the
house&mdash;which is including the cook," Tyrrell answered.
"You're an odd sort of inquiry agent, Green," he added, with
amusement evident in his tone.</p>

<p>"Not an agent at all&mdash;a principal," Gees dissented. "I
like the way you've taken me in as a brother, too, instead of
putting me out to board or leaving me to fend for myself. But
where do your men live?"</p>

<p>"You'll find their cottages quite near by&mdash;two of them in
the glen just outside the gate, but on the other side of the
lane."</p>

<p>"M'yah! Houses have a way of hiding themselves in country like
this, of course. How old is this house of yours, by the way?"</p>

<p>"Does it matter to your inquiry?" Tyrrell countered dryly.</p>

<p>"I don't know what does matter, yet," Gees said. "Never mind,
if it pains you. Magnificent weather for September, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"The newest part of the house&mdash;that is, the end nearest
to the outbuildings, which you can see is an addition if you look
closely at this front wall&mdash;is not less than three hundred
years old," Tyrrell explained rather morosely. "This main doorway
is much older."</p>

<p>"Much," Gees agreed, turning to look at the house and taking
out his cigarette case. "Have one&mdash;no? I will, then. It
looks to me as if the original builder made it a one-story
fabric, and then a later occupant lifted the roof and put another
floor under it&mdash; and a still later one put that new end on,
three hundred years ago, you say. Bless me, how time flies! And
yours is an old family, I gather?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how you gather it," Tyrrell said, "but you
happen to be right. A relative of my ancestors achieved some
distinction in the New Forest with a bow and arrow, not many
years after the Conquest."</p>

<p>"Saxon, eh?" Gees conjectured thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Mainly Danish, my branch of the family," Tyrrell
dissented.</p>

<p>"And settled here? But the Danes stuck to the East coast,
surely?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! They allied with the Irish, in the early days, and
came across the Irish Sea to see what they could find on this
West coast, quite a few of them. Vikings used to winter at
Dublin, and hire themselves and their men for the wars between
Irish chiefs, and some of them came over here and settled. Also,
this was part of Northumbria in those days, and that was nearly
all Danish."</p>

<p>"Quite so," Gees agreed. "There was a chap named Siward, earl
or something of the sort. I must look it all up, some time."</p>

<p>"And what has all this to do with my sheep?" Tyrrell inquired
acidly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, yet," Gees answered with unruffled placidity.
"I'm getting the feel of the place. Do you know who built that
castle?" He nodded at the ruined walls beyond the ridge that they
faced.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was William de&mdash;Guillaume, he called himself,
Guillaume de Boisgeant." He spelt out the surname after speaking
it. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Umm-m!" Gees took no heed of the final query. "I'd hate to be
called wooden giant, myself. Would that be&mdash;when did he
build?"</p>

<p>"In Stephen's time, and the name is supposed to imply that he
came from somewhere near Ghent, or his ancestors did. Spelling
was a mere wild amusement in those days. But he built on the site
of something much older&mdash;that hillock where the castle
stands is peppered with Roman brick, and even the Romans built on
older earthworks. And now have you had enough of archaeology, or
shall I go inside and fetch out a few volumes of the
<i>Britannica</i>? You've only to say the word."</p>

<p>"Put that differently, and I ought to be thinking sheep,
dreaming sheep, and talking sheep," Gees observed thoughtfully.
"Slaughtered sheep, that is, bled white by what killed them.
Well, perhaps. Tyrrell, if you don't let me tackle this in my own
way, it won't get done. If you do&mdash;well, I'll amend the
terms we made in London&mdash;in my office. I'll accept fifty
pounds for putting an end to your trouble, whether it takes a
week or seven months, and nothing at all if I don't end it."</p>

<p>"Then you're sure of success?" Tyrrell asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"No. I don't know yet what is killing your sheep, but I've
seen for myself that these are no normal killings, which
simplifies it, enormously. The abnormal is bound to declare
itself, if you look for it long enough and in the right way. And
I haven't asked you a single question that does not bear on the
problem, though you may find that hard to believe.
But&mdash;who's that coming through the gateway?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Feather&mdash;the one in civilian clothes," Tyrrell
answered after only a glance at the small touring car advancing
along the drive, "and that copper with him is Constable Moore,
our local muddler. I telephoned Feather about this last killing
as soon as Cottrill reported it to me&mdash;I've telephoned him
each time it happened, and he's come out each time to show me how
useless he is about it."</p>

<p>"I didn't suspect the existence of a telephone," Gees
observed. "What is it, a Marconi contraption? You've got no wire
visible."</p>

<p>"Since the wire came down with the snow every winter, and put
me out of communication, I had it laid underground," Tyrrell
explained. "It comes up to join the ordinary wires at the end of
the lane."</p>

<p>"You're not a poor man, are you?" Gees remarked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well?" Tyrrell asked, and smiled amusedly.</p>

<p>"And yet you live in a place like this?"</p>

<p>"You heard Cottrill say how the fells pulled him back,"
Tyrrell said. "So with all of us who belong here&mdash;and my
people have lived in this house for centuries. It's in the blood
of us to stay."</p>

<p>"There is no escape," Gees reflected aloud. "And you mean to
marry Gyda McCoul and rear up successors to feel like
that&mdash;and stay here."</p>

<p>"I've not asked her to marry me, yet," Tyrrell admitted,
"but&mdash; yes, I do mean that. Does it also bear on the problem
of the sheep?"</p>

<p>"Call it a mere statement of what I saw as obvious last
night," Gees countered. "And now&mdash;the inspector. Let us be
practical."</p>

<p>The final observation was a fruit of his survey of the man who
got out of the car after pulling on his handbrake at the corner
of the house, instead of driving up to stop abreast the main
entrance. A very large man, though still active in all his
movements, clad in a suit of grey tweed that fitted him none too
well, he looked more military than police with his squared
shoulders, brownish-red face in which his grey eyes were deeply
set under bushy brows, and big, cavalry moustache hiding his
mouth. Following him came Constable Moore, equally large, but of
a slow, lumbering type&mdash;Hercules with sciatica, Gees
mentally dubbed him. The inspector, approaching Tyrrell and Gees
as they stood on the graveled frontage, saluted by touching his
soft felt hat.</p>

<p>"Afternoon, sir," he said to Tyrrell. "I thought I'd just look
you up over this last outrage, to see if there's anything
different about it."</p>

<p>"In fact," Tyrrell interrupted savagely, "to show your damned
incompetence once more. I'm utterly fed-up with you, Inspector
Feather."</p>

<p>For some seconds, the inspector appeared as if about to choke,
and his reddish face took on a purplish tinge. Then he achieved
control over himself, and spoke in a way that Gees admired.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. I'm sorry to have intruded on you. I hope you
have no objection to my seeing your shepherd, Cottrill, about
it?"</p>

<p>"See him by all means," Tyrrell snapped back. "And after that,
what are you going to do about it? Go home and dream again?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Tyrrell," Feather asked coolly, "if a man of yours has
bungled some piece of work, do you castigate him in front of
others?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Inspector," Tyrrell said frankly, realizing his
own lack of decency, "and I take it all back. Green, this is
Inspector Feather, who has tried to get to the bottom of this
trouble&mdash;though with no success, so far. Inspector, Mr.
Green, from London, who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is just looking round your wonderful country and admiring it,
and enjoying my friend's hospitality," Gees put in. "Though I've
not seen much of it yet, having only arrived last night. I expect
your duties take you over a fairly extensive territory,
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Some few miles to cover, sir," Feather answered, far more
placably than he had spoken to Tyrrell, so far. "It's a sparsely
populated area, this, and I do a good bit of driving about in the
course of a week."</p>

<p>"And in all your driving, I suppose, you've never come across
a case like this," Gees suggested. "One so difficult, I
mean."</p>

<p>"That is the case, sir. It's&mdash;well, baffling, say, I find
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, very, I should think," Gees assented encouragingly. "Mr.
Tyrrell has been telling me all about it, and we went to see the
carcasses of these last two sheep this morning. I suppose you've
tried everything? I know a little about police work, by the
way."</p>

<p>"Is that so, sir?" The inspector accorded him a slight
increase of respect, and Tyrrell frowned heavily, but did not
interrupt them. "Yes, I think I've done everything possible.
Drummed up six men this summer&mdash;though it's difficult for me
to spare as many&mdash; and put them on watch over the
sheep&mdash;and the very night after they were taken off it
happened again. Moore, here, has watched with Cottrill, too. I've
had a census of dogs taken all over my district, and exonerated
every one of 'em, and last June we had that drive, you'll
remember, Mr. Tyrrell."</p>

<p>"Drive?" Gees echoed. "How do you mean that, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Got every man we could, and two troops of boy scouts, and
started early in the morning to beat all the countryside for
miles&mdash;I had an idea it might be an animal or animals
escaped from some menagerie or something&mdash;they're big beasts
that do this, as you can see from the carcasses, and I had an
idea there might be something hiding in the fells and coming out
to play this devil's game with Mr. Tyrrell's sheep. But we found
nothing&mdash;except for one wild cat that one of my men
shot."</p>

<p>"Which was not big enough to do damage of that sort," Gees
observed.</p>

<p>"Not by a long chalk, sir. Mr. Tyrrell"&mdash;he turned from
Gees as he spoke&mdash;"I propose to organize another drive. We
may find something if we do, and I can get more men into it, this
time."</p>

<p>Tyrrell made a slight grimace. "Do what you like," he said,
"but if you stop to reflect, you'll remember that these killings
have all been exactly alike, pointing the fact that the same
beasts have done them all the time. Add to that, there has been
as much as a fortnight interval between two killings&mdash;and if
those things are hidden in the fells, what do they live on? Do
they starve for a fortnight?"</p>

<p>"Well, there are rabbits, sir," Feather ventured.</p>

<p>"Do you think, in six months, we should not have come across
some sign if they had been killing rabbits?" Tyrrell demanded.
"Do you think Cottrill or somebody would have gone all this time
without finding some sign of the things themselves? He, for one,
tramps every bit of the fells with that dog of his&mdash;and he's
seen nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but I'm suggesting they may lie up outside the
bounds of your land, and come in to kill. I propose a twenty-mile
drive from north to south, and adding in the boy scouts we can
get, there'll be between one and two hundred people beating the
country, this time."</p>

<p>"With intervals of fifty yards, and the size of these things
that do the killings, they ought to find them if they're there,"
Gees put in.</p>

<p>"At least, it seems to me worth trying," Feather said
hopefully, "and it's got to be done while this weather lasts, if
at all. Once the autumn rain and fogs begin, it would be a mere
waste of time."</p>

<p>"When do you propose to undertake it, then?" Tyrrell
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, today's Tuesday&mdash;Friday, I'd say. I can get my
crowd together and out here by about eleven on Friday morning, if
you agree."</p>

<p>"And do I feed them, or pay them?" Tyrrell asked acidly.</p>

<p>"No more than you did before, sir," Feather answered, and Gees
sensed the resentment that his quiet tone concealed&mdash;he was
a genius at keeping his temper, evidently. "The boys will bring
their own food and treat it all as a lark, and I shall look after
the rest of them&mdash;that is, the county will have to stand the
expense. But"&mdash;he turned to address Gees&mdash;"it'll be
more than fifty yards intervals, sir. With that, you'd only cover
a front of five thousand yards, not the full width of Mr.
Tyrrell's own land. From one to two hundred yards apart, I want
them&mdash;and those things are big enough to see at that
distance."</p>

<p>"You're going by Cottrill's glimpse of them and his
description," Gees suggested, after a moment's pause for
thought.</p>

<p>"To some extent, sir. But if you see things like these by
night, with probably a bit of haze about, they're bound to look
bigger than reality. Cottrill said they were as big as donkeys,
but anything the size of a Great Dane would be big enough to do
what they're doing."</p>

<p>"Still doing," Tyrrell amended for him, sourly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tyrrell," he said gravely, "if you can suggest anything I
have not done in connection with this case, I shall be most happy
to do it."</p>

<p>There followed an awkward minute or so, and Gees feared lest
Tyrrell should break out into open rage. But, instead, he
laughed.</p>

<p>"You win, Inspector," he said. "No&mdash;I'm sore over it, as
you'd be if they were your sheep, but I haven't an idea in my
head beyond what you've done and propose to do. You want to see
Cottrill, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to see him, and inspect the carcasses, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, he'll be over in Anker's Glen&mdash;and you'll find
four of my men carting the hurdles to make him a new fold. That
is, unless he's gone out on the fells to see to his sheep, and in
that case the men making the new fold will tell you where to find
him. If this keeps on much longer, there will be nowhere to put
fresh folds for him."</p>

<p>"You mean that you move the sheep each time?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"Necessarily," Tyrell answered. "Sheep are the worst fools of
all animals, but you won't get them down on to that ground where
the killing took place for another two months, at least. Cottrill
knows he can't, now, and so he folds in a fresh place after a
killing."</p>

<p>"You get that, Inspector?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"The smell of blood, I expect," Feather said. "In the same
way, I've seen sheep go nearly mad over being driven into a
slaughter house. All animals are the same when there's blood
about."</p>

<p>But, Gees thought and did not say, there had been no blood at
the scene of this last killing. Instead, there had been a faint
reek that had a sickening, loathsome quality, a scent he could no
more forget than define. He nodded a grave assent to the
inspector's statement.</p>

<p>"That is so," he said. "Well, I shall be here to take part in
your drive&mdash;and good luck to it. This is a ghastly
affair."</p>

<p>"It's against my professional pride, sir," Feather said, "and
I'd do anything to put an end to it, as Mr. Tyrrell knows."</p>

<p>He took his leave, and the stout constable, who had stood in
the background and said nothing throughout the interview, though
he had heard it all, followed his superior and climbed unhandily
into the car. Gees watched meditatively as the inspector started
his engine, reversed and turned, and eventually went off down the
drive toward the gateway.</p>

<p>"His professional pride," he observed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"What do you make of him, Gees?" Tyrrell inquired.</p>

<p>"Ah! That's real friendliness, calling me that," Gees
answered, and smiled. "I make less of him than I do of you, over
it."</p>

<p>"Explicate?" Tyrrell asked, after a thoughtfully frowning
pause.</p>

<p>"Well, he lived up to the best traditions of the force, took
all your insults as if they had been compliments," Gees
explained, "and you didn't show up as the world's most perfect
little gentleman against him, either. I'm being frank, and you
can kick me out, if you like."</p>

<p>"No, I won't. Feather's a sound officer, really, but I'm so
sore over this that I say more than I mean, probably," Tyrrell
admitted.</p>

<p>"Well, say a little less about me, from henceforth," Gees
urged gently. "You were about to tell him I'd come here to
investigate this business when I broke in and stopped you at it.
I don't want a board put up at the gateway to say Gees is
investigating something between mumps and murder on this spot. I
don't want you to shout my purpose in being here at any more of
your friends or retainers, but just to play the simple innocent
with a vast interest in Cumberland, which I'm now seeing for the
first time. And if you tell the police I'm conducting a private
investigation for you, you put the police's backs
up&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>"With consequent loss of interest on their part," Tyrrell
suggested.</p>

<p>"Possibly," Gees admitted. "Wow, but that was a whale of a
lunch! Do you know what I feel like doing, at this moment?"</p>

<p>"Haven't the faintest idea," Tyrrell answered.</p>

<p>"Going to my room, pulling down the bed cover, and settling
down for an hour or so before tea. It must be this air, I
think."</p>

<p>"Just as you like." He sounded as if the idea did not appeal
to him.</p>

<p>"Permission granted, obviously," Gees remarked. "You're
thinking I ought to be up and about, of course, doing my
damndest. But, as I told you, the terms of the contract are now
fifty all in if I succeed, and nothing if I fail&mdash;and I do
it in my own way."</p>

<p>"I'll see that you're wakened for tea," Tyrrell promised, far
less stiffly. "And&mdash;you think well of Inspector Feather,
apparently?"</p>

<p>"As a police officer&mdash;yes," Gees answered. "Trained to
routine work and employing all the best police methods&mdash;more
than he told you or me, almost certainly. Feather is no fool,
within his limitations."</p>

<p>"Meaning&mdash;?" Tyrrell queried interestedly.</p>

<p>"I told you, the abnormal is bound to declare itself if you
look for it long enough and in the right way&mdash;but you
mustn't look for it in normal ways. Which is why I'm going to
climb on to my little bed and either think or not&mdash;I think I
want some more material to think over, before I really begin
thinking. We'll see."</p>

<p>He turned toward the house and made for the entrance.</p>

<p>Tyrrell, unmoving, watched him go, and smiled.</p>

<p>"You can't help liking the chap," he told himself.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER  V. &mdash; BAR TALK</h2>

<p class="first">THERE had been five scones in the dish, all hot
and buttery, when Tyrrell had called Gees down from his room for
tea. One remained, now. Gees, who had had three, looked at the
lonely survivor, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Take it," Tyrrell urged. "I'm turning on to cake."</p>

<p>"Then it would be a pity to waste this," Gees said, seizing
the scone. "It must be this air that's getting me down."</p>

<p>"Getting the scones down, too," Tyrrell gibed.</p>

<p>"I want to borrow a suit of clothes," Gees announced
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Tyrrell surveyed his figure&mdash;"apart from
hands and feet, you and I are much of a size, I should say.
Anything of mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Gees interrupted. "Good of you and all that, but have
you a man working for you of about my size? I want a working
suit."</p>

<p>"There's Weelum," Tyrrell said, after a moment's thought.
"He'd be about your build if somebody hit him on the nose and
pushed his head back. You know&mdash;stoops. But I think a suit
of his would fit you."</p>

<p>"A dirty suit," Gees explained. "Everyday, corduroy, reach-me-
down uglies. The uglier the better. Can you borrow one without
his knowing it's for me? And a cap or hat&mdash;I'll muddy a pair
of my own shoes."</p>

<p>"Is this disguise?" Tyrrell asked. "I mean, if it is, you've
got to wear boots, not shoes. Farm hands don't, you'll find."</p>

<p>"Quite right," Gees assented. "I packed a pair of heavy boots,
fortunately. Experience of Shropshire mud made me do it. Well,
suit, and hat, to make a farm laborer of me. Can you do it,
unbeknown?"</p>

<p>"I think so," Tyrrell assented rather dubiously. "For
when?"</p>

<p>"This evening&mdash;to walk to Odder and mingle with the gay
throng in the <i>Royal George</i> on terms of fraternity and
equality."</p>

<p>"And is <i>that</i> how you expect to discover what's killing
my sheep?" Tyrrell demanded with heavy sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Part of it," Gees answered placidly. "I wish you'd be a
little less anxious to keep my nose hard down on the sheepstone,
but as a matter of fact this is relevant to my idea of pursuing
the abnormal by abnormal paths. How do you approach this Weelum,
as you called him?"</p>

<p>"I don't," Tyrrell answered. "I approach my cook. Weelum is
her son, and illegitimate at that. He lives on the premises with
her, and I expect I could persuade her to let me have a suit of
his and say nothing about it for the evening&mdash;say nothing to
him, that is."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, of course, she'll tell the world," Gees suggested,
"but it will be too late to damage me, then. All right, Weelum
let it be. Oh, one other thing, though. I want Cottrill with
me."</p>

<p>"Cottrill?" Tyrrell echoed, in blank stupefaction. "But he'll
be watching by the sheep tonight, man. Always, after a
killing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There will be no killing tonight," Gees interrupted. "I want
him to come pub-crawling with me, as far as Odder and the
<i>Royal George</i>."</p>

<p>"You'll never get him away from his sheep," Tyrrell
prophesied.</p>

<p>"Well, will you get him to come here and see me after he's
finished his folding?" Gees asked. "Will he be near enough for
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can send and get him to come over before dark. But I
assure you it will be impossible to get him away from the
flock."</p>

<p>"I'll take the assurance&mdash;and Cottrill too, after I've
had a word with him. Now will you go and see about a suit of
Weelum's workaday fustian? I may have to make alterations in it
to fit it, or anything."</p>

<p>"It shall be done," Tyrrell promised, and, having finished his
tea, went off to that part of the house over which his cook
ruled.</p>

<p>It came to pass some two hours later that Cottrill, arriving
at the house in answer to a summons, faced his master just as
there emerged from the house a being at whom he frowned in a
puzzled way, since, as nearly as he could tell, it was a stranger
to these parts. Soiled corduroy trousers over enormous feet, an
old grey gabardine coat of which the sleeves were too short by an
inch or two, and which was soiled as if its owner had gone
ditching in it for years; a blue striped shirt, a muffler of dark
wool round the neck, and a dirty old cap pulled well down over
the eyes, completed the outfit.</p>

<p>"How do I look, Tyrrell?" Gees asked, and Cottrill first
smiled and then chuckled as he recognized the voice.</p>

<p>"Villainous," Tyrrell answered unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" Gees remarked with deep satisfaction. "Now,
Cottrill, I suppose you blow along to the <i>Royal George</i> at
Odder occasionally, if things are quiet enough to give you an
evening off?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I have been known to do such a thing," the
shepherd admitted, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll go along together tonight, and I'll
be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not tonight, sir," Cottrill interrupted gravely. "I shall be
keeping an eye on the fold, after what happened night before
last."</p>

<p>"Whether you do or no, there will be no more killings
tonight," Gees told him with utter certainty in his tone, "and I
assure you it will be far more useful if you come and give me the
freedom of the bar."</p>

<p>"I'd be uneasy, sir. It's not as if&mdash;well, you see, the
sheep are my people. And to leave them alone in the fresh fold,
tonight&mdash;"</p>

<p>His gesture implied refusal to think of such a thing. Then
Tyrrell spoke&mdash;his look at Gees' face determined him.</p>

<p>"They close at ten, Cottrill," he said. "I'll take a shot gun
and go down to Anker's Glen, and you can come and relieve me
after knock-out. Mr. Green is set on making this expedition
tonight."</p>

<p>"Because, after today, too many people will know me&mdash;I
should be recognized by someone in spite of these clothes," Gees
explained.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're sure, Mr. Tyrrell&mdash;" Cottrill began, and
again did not end it. Evidently he was reluctant to leave his
sheep to the care of any other. "And I don't see what use&mdash;"
he began again.</p>

<p>"As I remarked to Mr. Tyrrell," Gees told him, "this is an
abnormal case, and you've got to use abnormal methods to get at
the cause of the trouble. It may be quite useless, this little
jaunt, but I want to try it&mdash;and if I go alone, the men in
that bar will shut up like oysters."</p>

<p>"An' I'm to be the oyster-knife," Cottrill suggested. "All
right, sir, since Mr. Tyrrell is goin' to keep watch. I'll
come."</p>

<p>"Good! I'll be George&mdash;just George, for the evening.
Friend of a cousin of yours, shall we say? From down
south&mdash;Sussex, for choice."</p>

<p>"I think I can back that amount of fiction, sir."</p>

<p>"Not sir&mdash;George." He looked at his watch. "If I meet you
outside the gate in about an hour's time, that will give you a
chance to get something to eat, and it will be very nearly dark
by then, too."</p>

<p>"Right you are, sir. I'll be there," Cottrill promised.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;George!" Gees insisted. "Start practicing it
now."</p>

<p>"All right, George. I'll be there in an hour from now."</p>

<p>He went down the drive, Jimmy following him. The dog was
plodding wearily, Gees noted, and Cottrill himself seemed none
too fresh.</p>

<p>"I wonder how many miles they've done today already?" Gees
mused. He thought of how he had seen the sheep scattered to graze
on the hillsides, and what it meant to collect them all and fold
them for the night. "And Odder's nearly three miles away," he
added.</p>

<p>"He'll be all right after a rest and some food," Tyrrell said,
"but I doubt whether this idea of yours will lead to
anything."</p>

<p>"We'll see," Gees said. "No other idea has led to anything, so
far, so at the worst I shall merely come out even.
But&mdash;dinner, eh?"</p>

<p>Tyrrell led the way inside, and then gestured Gees to precede
him.</p>

<p>"You're sure that maid of yours can keep quiet&mdash;till to-
morrow?" Gees asked. "It would be a pity if a word from her got
ahead of me."</p>

<p>"It won't," Tyrrell promised. "I've seen to that already."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Night had fully fallen when Cottrill and Gees went off toward
Odder: Tyrrell, with a double-barreled breechloader in the crook
of his arm and about a dozen cartridges loaded with number three
shot, had set out for Anker's Glen half an hour earlier. Since
the moon would not rise till after ten o'clock, and the haze was
thicker than on the preceding night, the darkness in the hollow
to which the two descended after leaving Dowlandsbar gateway was
of such a quality that Gees stumbled more than once in the ruts
of the unkempt lane.</p>

<p>"This reek's comin' off Solway, I reckon," Cottrill remarked.
He halted, wetted his forefinger by sticking it in his mouth, and
held it up to test the air. "Yes," he added as they went on.
"West, with a bit of north in it&mdash;there'll be a fog by
mornin', George."</p>

<p>"Ah! You oughter see what a Lunnon fog's like," Gees
responded.</p>

<p>"Bad enough here, in winter," Cottrill said.</p>

<p>They passed over a stone bridge that Gees remembered from the
night before, since it had given him little more than a foot of
clearance on each side of his car, and bent to the steep ascent
beyond. The tall stones of the entrance to Locksborough Castle
reared ghostly in the haze, and Gees saw that Cottrill signed the
cross on himself as he passed the twin pillars. He was about to
comment on it when with a little thrill down the spine he
realized that a specter-like grey figure was showing above the
low stone wall between them and the castle lands, and advancing
toward them. Then it resolved itself into the form of a woman,
and Cottrill uttered a cheery "Good night" as they came
abreast.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Cottrill, isn't it?" Gees recognized Gyda McCoul's
voice.</p>

<p>"That same, miss," Cottrill said, and paused. "It's a foggy
sort of night&mdash;I'm afraid our good weather's breakin' up at
last."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not!" As she spoke, she took a step forward,
seemed to stumble, and recovered herself within a yard of
Gees&mdash;he could see her snow-white hair, uncovered, and see,
too, a half-luminous quality in her eyes, before she backed away
from him. "This awful lane!" she exclaimed. "It makes an evening
walk almost impossible. But surely you should be watching the
sheep tonight, Mr. Cottrill?"</p>

<p>"No, miss, I'm takin' a night off wi' George here&mdash;he's
come all the way from Sussex to have a look at us up here. There
won't be nothing happen to the sheep again as soon after the last
killin' as this."</p>

<p>"Well, you know best, of course," she said. "Good night, Mr.
Cottrill. And good night, George, too." And she went on toward
the monolith-guarded entry to the castle, while Cottrill and Gees
resumed their way. And, Gees realized, there had been a spice of
mockery in her voice when she had bidden him good night: she had
recognized him, he knew.</p>

<p>"They say she walks about a lot o' nights," Cottrill observed,
when be felt sure the subject of the remark was beyond hearing.
"Restless, like. Ever see a white head like hers before,
George?"</p>

<p>"Not quite so striking," Gees admitted. "It's very
attractive."</p>

<p>"Mighty pretty," Cottrill agreed, "but a bit uncanny. I saw
one like it in Valparaiso, but she had a face you could camp out
on&mdash; got some Arauco blood in her, and her hair was
straight, not curly like Miss McCoul's."</p>

<p>"There's a prospect that she won't be Miss McCoul much longer,
I understand," Gees observed after they had tramped some way in
silence.</p>

<p>"Aye," Cottrill assented, and Gees divined from his tone that
this was a subject he was not inclined to discuss.</p>

<p>Again they went on in silence, topped the rise beyond the
castle, and went winding down into Odder. The village emporium
was closed, Gees noted: he saw, too, the squat steeple of a
little church that he had not observed from his car&mdash;it was
set back from the lane and tucked into a slope that rendered it
inconspicuous. Then they turned toward the <i>Royal George</i>,
from the frontage of which a band of light lay out across the
lane, and in it the thickening reek of the night swirled smokily.
Cottrill opened a door, and the two entered a big, low ceilinged
room, paneled shoulder-high with painted and grained deal
planking. There were settles round three sides, a plain deal
table with two scrubbed, backless forms as seats for it in the
middle of the room, a dart board hung in the corner by the
window, and a bar at which a red-faced man in shirt-sleeves
presided. A dozen or so of men dressed much as was Gees himself
sat round on the settles, in twos and threes, and against the bar
lounged a well-dressed youngster who screwed up his eyes to gaze
at the new-comers in a way that suggested he had been drinking
freely. The sag of the pint tankard he held suggested it,
too.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Co-Cottrill!" he hiccupped. "Good old Cottrill!
How-how's sheep-killing going on, Cottrill? All-all dead
yet?"</p>

<p>"Not all, Master Harold," Cottrill answered stiffly, as he
approached the bar. "Two pints, tankards, Mr. Querrett. I've got
a friend from Sussex come to see us. George, this is Mr.
Querrett, an' if you can find better beer between here an'
Sussex&mdash;well, you're clever. Why, hullo, Harry! How goes it,
Ben? Taters all clamped yet?"</p>

<p>"Aye, an' a rare crop, too," Ben, a grey-headed ancient,
responded.</p>

<p>"They hain't begun clampin' of 'em yet, down in Sussex," Gees
put in, addressing himself to both Cottrill and the ancient.</p>

<p>"You jest coom from theer, then?" Ben inquired friendlily.</p>

<p>"Aye," he answered. "Come up through the sheers."</p>

<p>"Through what, mister?" The ancient put a hand to his ear for
the reply, and the rest of the men in the room listened too.</p>

<p>"The sheers," Gees repeated. "Lemme see, now. There was
Birksheer, an' Oxfordsheer, an' Shropsheer, an'
Lancasheer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Geography lesson, gentlemen all!" the youngster by the bar
broke in. "Counties of England in their or-order, by the man from
Sussex. Dirty county, Sussex, by the look of him. Refill, please,
Querrett." He slid his tankard across the bar and released it
with the order.</p>

<p>"No, Master Harold, you get no more to drink here tonight,"
Querrett answered firmly, and put the empty tankard away after
handing two to Cottrill. Gees took one of the two and silently
toasted the shepherd with it before he drank, and discovered it
was very good beer indeed.</p>

<p>"No more t'-night?" the youth demanded harshly. "Why, 'ts'not
nine, yet! Not half-pas' eight. Don' be silly, man!"</p>

<p>"It's nearer nine than half-past eight," Querrett told him
firmly, "and if it were only seven you wouldn't get another drop
across this bar. It's time you went home. Good night, Master
Harold."</p>

<p>Gazing round the room blinkingly, as if inclined to appeal
against the decision, the youth sensed that the landlord's
suggestion was approved. He stuck his hands in his pockets and
walked unsteadily to the door, pausing there to look back into
the room as he held on to the handle. He grinned, foolishly, and
opened the door.</p>

<p>"Good nigh', ev'ybody," he said, and went out, slamming the
door.</p>

<p>"If I'd had a boy like that, I'd ha' leathered him black an'
blue," Ben said solemnly. "Reckon he'll break Mr. Amber's heart,
this way."</p>

<p>"An' his sister's as well," said another. "She's fair
worritted over his ways. 'T'ain't as if he could carry his
drink."</p>

<p>"The vicar's son, eh?" Gees asked of Cottrill.</p>

<p>"Aye. He's at college at Oxford&mdash;they give 'em far too
long holidays, an' don't discipline 'em when they're there,"
Cottrill answered. "What d'ye think of our Cumberland beer,
George?"</p>

<p>"Fine stuff," Gees said reverently. "You were right about
it."</p>

<p>"That young feller oughter be leathered," Ben insisted to the
company in general. "If I had a son like him, I'd leather him, I
would."</p>

<p>"An' how are things down yure way, mister?" A brawny
individual in a shabby velveteen jacket put the question to Gees
as he set a pint glass on the bar and gestured Querrett to refill
it.</p>

<p>"Oh, slow," Gees answered. "But I come into a bit o' money, so
I reckoned I'd travel a bit an' see me old friend here." He
indicated Cottrill by a nod. "An' havin' come into that bit o'
money," he added, "I reckon it's up to me to stand me footin',
like. What'll everyone have, now?" He looked round the room to
see how the invitation would be received, trusting to Cottrill's
sponsorship to justify it.</p>

<p>"Well, that's very kind o' your friend, Mr. Cottrill," Ben
said, and finished his drink hastily. "I'll drink his health in
another pint, wi' pleasure, an' I reckon the rest of us'll do the
same."</p>

<p>"Drink up, chaps," Cottrill admonished heartily.</p>

<p>"George is a warm member, an' he can afford it. Half for me
this time, Mr. Querrett&mdash;I don't want to make the pace too
hot, an' we've just had pints."</p>

<p>The landlord bustled between the bar and his taps&mdash;he had
the beer in casks at the back&mdash;and eventually every member
of the party had a fresh drink at Gees' expense. They toasted
him, and old Ben smacked his lips loudly as he lowered his
tankard after a long draught.</p>

<p>"An' how d'ye like our part o' the world, mister?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"You've got too many hills, an' not enough trees," Gees
answered.</p>

<p>"You don't want to be all smothered up in woods, do you?" Ben
demanded. "As f'r the hills, I reckon the Almighty put 'em
there."</p>

<p>"An' trees," another observed, "there's a fine clump round Mr.
Tyrrell's place&mdash;reg'lar little wood, it is. Don't want
trees everywhere you go. It'd make it stiflin' like, besides the
mess o' leaves."</p>

<p>"All round that old ruin we passed on the way here, there's no
more trees'n hair on a baby's chin," Gees declared gravely.</p>

<p>"Ah, that'll be Locksborough," Ben remarked. "Well, there was
some fine rowans, but Mr. McCoul had 'em all cut down an' the
roots pizened. It beat us, that did&mdash;unless maybe he
reckoned to use 'em as firewood."</p>

<p>"That way, he wouldn't ha' had the roots pizened," another
suggested.</p>

<p>"Happen he wouldn't," Ben said, and dismissed the subject.
"Well, Mr. Cottrill, what's yure news? Yu're a bit of a stranger,
these days."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Cottrill agreed. "It's some while since I called
in for a pint, ain't it? News? Nothing good, I can assure you,
Ben."</p>

<p>"You hain't found out what's a-doin' of it yet, then?"</p>

<p>Cottrill shook his head. "Neither hide nor hoof," he
answered.</p>

<p>"I was talkin' to Moore tonight," the velveteen-jacketed man
put in, "and he told me there's to be another drive, come Friday
mornin'."</p>

<p>"Aye, an' if any o' them boys go tromplin' round my tater
clamp, I'll leather 'em," Ben promised.</p>

<p>"The things that kill them sheep ain't likely to hide in your
tater clamp, Ben," velveteen-jacket said slily, and won a general
laugh.</p>

<p>"Happen they don't," Ben snapped when the laugh subsided.
"D'you know where they do hide, since you talk so sure about
it?"</p>

<p>"Happen you know as much as I do about 'em," velveteen
retorted.</p>

<p>"What d'you chaps make o' these things, then?" Gees ventured,
opening the subject for which he had made this excursion. "I'm a
stranger about heer," he added apologetically, "an' know no
more'n what Mr. Cottrill told me, about losin' his sheep by dogs
o' some sort."</p>

<p>"Well, mister, that's what it is," Ben said, and suggested by
his tone that he intended to say no more on the subject.</p>

<p>"But you been callin' of 'em things, not dogs," Gees pointed
out.</p>

<p>"It'd be back about the middle o' July, mister," the velveteen
man said slowly, after a pause in which nobody moved or spoke,
"an' Jack Baldwin&mdash;he ain't here tonight&mdash;Jack was
comin' along from Dowlandsbar way, same as it might be you an'
Mr. Cottrill tonight. Top o' the rise this side the old castle,
he sighted two things t'other side the wall alongside the
road&mdash;things, he called 'em, not dogs. They was goin' like
all possessed across country, Jack said&mdash;it was nigh on
dark, but not quite. Jack said they loped over the wall a score
paces in front o' him, an' then took the other wall an' went
outer sight in a dip t'ords the castle. An' Jack said he'd take
his oath they warn't dogs nor yet nuthin' a dog'd come near,
though they was four-legged."</p>

<p>"More like big cats?" Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"No. Like dogs, Jack said, but not dogs. Because, he said,
there was a smell went with 'em that made him nigh sick, a smell
no dog could live with&mdash;they was to wind'ard of him, an' he
got the smell as they went across his front. Ye know, sometimes a
dog'll roll on a dead rat or anything an' get a powerful stink on
him, but Jack said it was not a bit like that. More&mdash;more
like bad chemicals, he reckoned..."</p>

<p>"I were here when he come in that night," another interrupted,
"an' he were white as a sheet, an' what he said about the smell
were that if any of us ever got to hell, it'd be what we'd find.
The reek o' the pit where the damned frizzle, he said, not bein'
careful o' his words at anytime, ain't Jack. An' if you went by
the look o' him, he'd seen the davvle hisself, that night. All to
pieces, he were."</p>

<p>"An' they're what's killin' Mr. Tyrrell's sheep," the
velveteen man added. "An' 'tis my belief no mortal man can tackle
'em, even if he could find 'em, any more'n ye could tackle the
old dead risen."</p>

<p>"The old dead risen?" Gees echoed questioningly.</p>

<p>"The man's a stranger," Ben cut in, "or he'd know there's
things round these fells we don't talk about, lest we get their
ill-will." He tilted his tankard, and ceremoniously spilled a
gout of its contents on the sanded floor, and with amazement Gees
saw that half a dozen others, Cottrill among them, did the same.
It was a sort of libation, as if the men who made it feared lest
the "old dead" should hear themselves discussed, and so must be
propitiated.</p>

<p>An odd quiet followed, and the occupants of the bar looked at
each other uneasily: there was fear in the atmosphere of the
place, Gees sensed, and a lad by the window let out a little yelp
as the door went clattering open and a wild-eyed, bare-headed
man, his grizzled hair all tousled, almost ran in and, steadying,
approached the bar.</p>

<p>"F'r the love av the Virgin, Misther Querrett, gimme a double
whisky, an' make it big!" he pleaded rather than ordered.</p>

<p>"Shaun Ammon, Mr. McCoul's man at the castle," Cottrill
whispered explanatorily to Gees. "Why, Shaun, what's wrong?" he
asked, as the landlord took down a bottle and a man by the door
shut it hastily.</p>

<p>"Ah, sure, I've seen an' smelt 'em," Shaun answered half-
sobbingly. "Beyant the church, waitin' be the wall o' the
graveyard. Eyes like fires glowin' at ye&mdash;great grey things
crouchin', an' one growled as I wint by. An' hell itself'll smell
no worse than thim."</p>

<p>"There!" the velveteen man exclaimed. "Wasn't that what Jack
said? The reek o' the pit where the damned frizzle was his
words."</p>

<p>"But how come you to be out this way so late, Shaun?" Querrett
asked. "You've never been here after dark before, I know."</p>

<p>The man finished his neat whisky and put the glass down. "I'll
be throublin' ye f'r the same again, Misther Querrett," he said,
"F'r I nade it, if iver a man did. How'm I here so late, ye're
askin'? It was the masther, Misther McCoul&mdash;Miss Gyda went
f'r one o' her walks, an' since she was out a long while, he sez
to me&mdash;'Shaun,' he sez, 'I mislike Miss Gyda bein' out alone
so late, with all the happenin's that happen these days&mdash;go
find her, she wint t'ords Odder, an' ye'll find her forninst the
village, sure.' An' I kem out lookin' f'r her, but divil a sight
of her could I see. An' bein' so near, a dhrink sthruck me as a
frind in nade, an' I kem on past the churchyard&mdash;but not f'r
ten barrels av the craythur would I have kem if I'd known what
I'd see!"</p>

<p>Cottrill emptied his tankard and put it down. Then he turned
to Gees and gripped the stick&mdash;it was almost a
cudgel&mdash;he had brought.</p>

<p>"I dunno how you feel about this," he said, "but if the grey
things are still there&mdash;but I wish I had my gun with me."
And he moved toward the door, while Gees, comprehending his
intent, followed.</p>

<p>"Nay, come back!" Ben called to them. "Can ye face devils from
the pit wi' no more than a stick, man? Come back! Death's out
there!"</p>

<p>"Aye, the old dead, mayhap," and Cottrill lifted his stick
aloft, "but I cut this from a mountain ash myself. And I'm
going."</p>

<p>He went out to the night. Gees, following him, looked back and
saw a huddle of frightened faces as the occupants of the bar
crowded round the doorway. Cottrill, hurrying, glanced back too
for a moment.</p>

<p>"If they had the guts of a louse among 'em, they'd come too,"
he said. "Hullo! Tom Cotton's a man, at least. Comin' with us,
Tom?"</p>

<p>The velveteen-jacketed man, running to catch up with them,
eased his pace to fall in beside Cottrill. "Aye," he said. "If so
be as we might track 'em down an' put an end to this devil's
business."</p>

<p>They hurried on, and came to the low wall bounding the
churchyard. Again Gees caught the vile reek he had smelt that
morning by the sheep fold, but of whatever had caused it there
was no sign, though they searched all four sides of the
quadrangle. Then, standing in the misty, utter stillness to
listen for a moment, vainly, Cottrill shook his head.</p>

<p>"Might be anywhere, by this time," he said. "In the churchyard
itself, mayhap. There's hiding enough among the tombs."</p>

<p>"The old dead wouldn't go in consecrated ground," Tom Cotton
said.</p>

<p>"Are they, then?" Cottrill turned on him and put the question
sharply, almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"This smell," Tom said. "That, or&mdash;" He did not end
it.</p>

<p>"Ssh!" Cottrill cautioned him. "Don't speak of
<i>them</i>."</p>

<p>"You goin' back home, or stoppin' the night here?" Tom asked
after another long silence in which they looked over the
wall.</p>

<p>"Back home, of course," Cottrill answered. "Why?"</p>

<p>"It's more'n I'd do, tonight," Tom said. "But there's that
poor chap Ammon&mdash;he'll never dare go back to the castle
alone. If&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," Cottrill said, "he can come with us. Now, though. I'm
not stopping in there any longer, nor goin' in again. Tell him,
will you."</p>

<p>Tom went off toward the inn, and Cottrill and Gees went a
little way back toward it. Presently Shaun Ammon came hurrying
toward them.</p>

<p>"May the saints in glory look down an' reward yez, gentlemen,"
he accosted them. "'Tis meself that'd niver dare go back alone,
an' no breakfast there'd have been for the masther in the mornin'
av I'd sthayed, an' Miss Gyda's hot wather to make tonight,
too."</p>

<p>"You'll be rather late with it," Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"An' maybe I will, but Miss Gyda's a forgivin' sort. Ah, me
head's all rattlin' wi' the fright, an' I can't think. Av you two
gentlemen would come as far as the dureway, I'll remimber it in
me prayers. The divil is out tonight, sure, an' all his angels
too."</p>

<p>"We'll see you home, Shaun," Gees promised.</p>

<p>"May the blessin' av Mary rest on ye, gentlemen," Shaun prayed
fervently. "'Tis no night to go alone, be the powers!"</p>

<p>As they climbed to the ridge between them and the old castle,
Gees could hear the Irishman drawing long, shuddering breaths, as
if the terror of what he had seen were still on him. And, until
they had seen him open a postern door at one corner of the old
keep, and enter, no more words were spoken except for the "Good
nights" of all three. Then, as the two turned to go back to the
lane, Cottrill spoke.</p>

<p>"It looks as if they were coming out into the open at last,"
he said. "God send it, before I go mad."</p>

<p>"Soon, now," Gees said soothingly.</p>

<p>"You mean that?"</p>

<p>Cottrill stopped to face his man while he put the question.
But, before Gees could answer, they both faced toward Dowlandsbar
to listen. Not from Dowlandsbar itself, but from beyond it, came
the faint report of a gun. Then again it sounded to them, and
faint echoes of the report volleyed among the fells and died
out.</p>

<p>"The master!" Cottrill whispered. "Nobody else would be
shooting at this time of night. They're there among the
sheep!"</p>

<p>He turned and ran, and Gees, following at first, caught him up
and kept beside him on the way to Anker's Glen.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; ATTACK</h2>

<p class="first">FROM the top of Brownhill Scar, a humped mound
or hillock on the ridge over which a path led to Anker's Glen,
Tyrrell paused to look back at the last of the sunset afterglow,
pink and emerald shading to deepening turquoise between horizon
and zenith. A little light remained on such heights as this, but
in the valleys the shadows were deepening fast, and the light
haze that would later become a misty reek was thickening.
Dowlandsbar, a mile and more to the west from the Scar, was
hidden by the intervening height; to the east, far off and no
more than a glimmering point, Tyrrell could see the coalesced
lights of the farmhouse where Bandon, whose land formed the
eastern boundary to Tyrrell's own, lived. There was no other sign
of human occupancy of the rugged landscape: cottages, what there
were of them, were set low down in the glens for the sake of
water, and of winter shelter too.</p>

<p>Nearly all Tyrrell's land was, like his homestead, on the
north side of the lane which formed his only way to main roads
and the urgencies of what claims to be the higher form of
civilization, but the glen in which the sheep were folded for
this night was part of some two hundred acres on the south side.
The lane itself averaged an east and west direction, though its
persistent divergences from the average as it followed the
conformations of the ground made this hard of belief to one who
did not know the countryside.</p>

<p>Heather-clad, rock-scarred, the heights grew obscure and their
outlines softened with the coming of darkness: from this height
on which he paused Tyrrell could look down into Anker's Glen, a
wide valley of rich grass in which the new fold showed as a
grayish oval in the dimness, filled as it was with the fleecy
backs of his sheep. He broke his gun, slipped in two of the
cartridges from his pocket, and snapped the breech closed again
before following the narrow sheep track that led down the
hillside toward the fold. There might be no need of it&mdash;Gees
had said there would be no killings&mdash;but fear had lain over
these fells for six months, now, and was over them tonight. And
Gees was a stranger who had been here but a bare twenty-four
hours&mdash; how could he tell what might happen in the hours of
darkness?</p>

<p>There were scrubby clumps of broom on the hillside, any one of
which might have hidden a target for the breechloader, but
appeared void of any occupancy when Tyrrell passed them. Between
him and the fold, and less than a dozen yards distant from it,
rose up a solitary mountain ash, the only tree in sight, its red
clusters of berries black in the deepening gloom. As he came into
the shadow of its boughs a flapping sounded among them, and a
lone carrion crow sailed off to westward, a black blot against
the very last of the sky's light. Startled, even chilled by the
sight, Tyrrell half raised his gun to aim at the evil thing, but
then lowered it again&mdash;it was too uncertain a shot. But that
lessening speck against the darkening west was ominous,
threatful: fear lay heavy over the fells, tonight.</p>

<p>He made the round of the fold, slowly, since it would be two
hours and more before Cottrill would relieve him of his watch,
and came back to the lone tree. The sheep were quiet, some of
them cropping the grass inside the fold, others placidly cud-
chewing, but, Tyrrell noted, not one of all the flock was lying
down. With a sudden gust of irritation he reflected that they
ought to be out, scattered all over the fells, on such a night as
this, rather than cooped together to scatter at dawn and be
rounded up again in the next dusk. Cottrill had stood the
abnormal situation splendidly up to the present, had made no
complaint, though he could not have had a score nights in bed all
this summer, but he could not go on, Tyrrell knew. The mere
physical strain would be too much for him when winter approached,
and, in addition to that, the uncanny, almost unearthly nature of
these killings would break any man's nerve, even one with such
unthinking courage as Cottrill had shown&mdash;up to now!</p>

<p>Tyrrell, watchful of his man, was convinced that he would not
stand much more of it. He had agreed to Gees' suggestion of
taking Cottrill with him to Odder as much for the shepherd's sake
as for anything, believing that such an evening off, among the
cronies he would meet in the bar of the <i>Royal George</i>,
would have a tonic effect. That Gees himself would get anything
of value out of the expedition, Tyrrell did not believe for a
moment. A group of laborers and the like, gossiping over their
beer, could contribute nothing in the way of enlightenment as to
how the sheep were killed.</p>

<p>Leaned against the tree, his gun in the crook of his arm, he
gave himself up to reflection. Gees&mdash;what could Gees learn
that others had not learned&mdash;what could he do that had not
been done already? Impulse alone, at first, had led
him&mdash;Tyrrell&mdash;to send that two-guinea check in response
to the semi-comic advertisement that had caught his eye, and then
the man himself&mdash;Tyrrell had wanted to know more of him, and
had so far believed in one who might prove an utter charlatan
that there, in London, he had agreed to risk fifty pounds for a
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>There, in the heart of civilization, the problem had appeared
utterly different from what it did here. The superstition it had
wakened had seemed a foolish thing, but here on the scene of the
killings Tyrrell was not so sure that it was foolish. In ordinary
times, his men were common-sense beings: for years he had heard
no more than old tales told half-skeptically, in the way that
grownups regard children's fairy tales, stories of interest and
no more. But in these last six months all that had altered, and
even Cottrill, traveled and common-sense man that he was, seemed
to believe in the presence of something un-human, evil, fearsome.
Others made vague allusions&mdash;Tyrrell had heard the
phrase&mdash;"the old dead," and noted a sudden change of subject
if he came on two men talking. Did they believe the old dead
could rise and do evil on earth again? He had seen Jack Baldwin,
one of his workmen, seated under a wall and eating his midday
snack of bread and bacon, and had seen the man carefully cut off
a piece of his meal and throw it over his shoulder&mdash;not
cutting out something unfit for his own eating, but choosing a
morsel of the best to throw away. Propitiating ... what? For
there was something, not the "old dead," but something else that
these men believed existed, and they would never speak of it in
Tyrrell's hearing.</p>

<p>And all this superstitious belief had grown up in the past six
months, he reflected. Before the killings began, his men and
their neighbors had been quite normal in their outlook. Was there
a fire behind this smoke, or were they all silly and credulous
over something that had a perfectly natural and reasonable
explanation? And why the devil should he himself go cold with
superstitious fright when a carrion crow flapped out from a tree
and flew off into the night? He had seen carrion crows flying
over the fells all his life, and had regarded them as part of
that life, birds that had their uses, foul though they might be.
Was this folly infecting him?</p>

<p>What would Gyda think of him, if she knew he yielded though
ever so little to credence of these fantastic beliefs? For as
long as he could remember, the inhabitants of the district had
shunned Locksborough Castle ruins in all but the brightest of
daylight, feared it as a haunt of the "old dead," whoever or
whatever they might be, and as a place of ill-omen, but Gyda's
father had bought and restored it, and now he and she lived there
with no sign of fear of their surroundings. A little thrill of
another sort took Tyrrell as he recollected her walking beside
him in the darkness toward her home, her shining head so close to
his shoulder, her voice soft and caressing&mdash;and the pulsing,
wonderful vitality of her that stirred him as did the strange,
luminous softness of her eyes&mdash;such eyes as he had never
seen before. Soon, perhaps, he would have her as mistress of
Dowlandsbar, pillow that shining head on his shoulder and feel
the warm prisoning of her white arms. Gyda, his wife! From his
first sight of her, he had loved her.</p>

<p>The rattle of a displaced stone high up on the hillside
startled him from his long reverie. Darkness was heavy about him,
now, and the haze of the day had thickened to a misty reek in
which the nearest hurdles of the sheepfold, only a dozen yards
distant from the tree, had merged into an indistinct grayness. He
must have been dreaming here a long time, for that falling stone
could only mean that Cottrill was coming down to relieve him. And
the sheep, surely, knew that someone beside himself was here, for
the grey mass of them was moving, milling round and
about&mdash;but <i>away</i> toward the centre of the fold! They
were crowding inward on each other with little "Urr's" and grunts
and coughings, and now there was quite a space between the edge
of their mass and the hurdles, and still they milled round,
crowding in to the centre of their mass. And Tyrrell
knew&mdash;it was not Cottrill coming down the hillside! A
shudder of fear took him&mdash;not such fear as men know in
facing normal danger, but such unreasoning terror as grips and
holds a child that finds itself alone in the dark. He pressed his
back hard against the tree, felt for and found the safety catch
of his gun and slid it off, and waited through an eternity of
stillness, save for the rustle and grunts and coughs of the
milling, frightened sheep.</p>

<p>Twenty yards away, or more, beyond the deeper shadow cast by
the foliage of the tree, something moved toward the fold, a grey
blot on the misty darkness. With his worst paroxysm of fear
passed, Tyrrell lifted his gun to his shoulder, but knew the
muzzle was wavering&mdash;he tried to grip the barrel and steady
it, and so held his fire. Another, more whitish shape joined the
first, and now he had the gun steady on them both, but a choking,
hellish reek came to his nostrils, a sickening smell as that of
death itself. He wanted to cough, to cry out, but could make no
sound. The two shapes moved on toward the fold, and from within
it came a collective, moaning noise, such as he had never heard
from sheep or any animals&mdash;it was the last extremity of
terror expressed in sound. The two things leaped the hurdles,
long, gaunt shapes, they seemed, and then Tyrrell pressed the
trigger of his right barrel, heard the echoes of the shot go
clattering along the fells, and let off the left barrel too.
There came to his singing ears a low, angry howl, half-doglike,
half-human, and the two things leaped back out of the fold and
came at him as he broke the gun and fumbled in his pocket for
fresh cartridges when the empty shells dropped at his feet. But
he could not get at the cartridges: his pipe and tobacco pouch
would get in the way of his fingers.</p>

<p>At just such a distance as the branches of the tree reached
over, the two things stopped, and, fumbling feverishly for
cartridges, Tyrrell saw four eyes gleaming at him like points of
fire. He got out two cartridges, but in his clumsy, fumbling
haste dropped them both when he tried to insert them in the
breech of the gun. The two things turned their heads so that he
could see only two points of light, and at that a sudden rage and
fear lest they should escape took him. He snapped the gun breech
shut, clubbed it, and charged out at them&mdash;here were real
things, no ghosts, his brain told him in that moment. The slight
downward slope from the tree trunk gave him pace for his rush.
Now he saw the things clearly, almost as if it were day instead
of darkness-as if, his brain told him, they were luminous. Gaunt
grey things with little, pointed ears, and the one that shrank
back from him was more nearly white than the other. That other
sprang at him as his foot dropped into a hole, and as he fell the
impetus of his rush carried him sliding face downward over the
short, thick grass. And now it was over him, on him. The
poisonous reek of its breath came to his nostrils as he saw white
teeth dropping toward his face&mdash;a snarling growl, and the
whitish beast charged its fellow and knocked him in the ribs with
such force that he rolled over and over, and Tyrrell heard the
grating tear of his coat and felt a stinging pain in his
shoulder. He saw the two beasts rolling over and over close
beside him, heard that snarling growl again&mdash; and then
consciousness left him.</p>

<p>"Master! Master, for God's sake wake up! Say something! No,
he's not dead, an' I can't find any hurt except this scratch.
Master!"</p>

<p>Tyrrell sat up, slowly, with Gees kneeling beside him and
holding his arm. Then, with Gees still holding him, he began
retching, and was violently and horribly sick. As he put up a
hand to his forehead at the end of the paroxysm he realized that
his hair was sodden with dew: he could not remember losing his
hat: it must have fallen off when he made that rush from under
the tree, and he had lain here a long while. All that had
happened was clear in his mind, intolerably, awfully clear.</p>

<p>"Feel better, now?" Gees asked, while Cottrill peered
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes. Let me stand up. I'm all right, now. Only, I've been in
hell&mdash;no, hell came here to me. The sheep&mdash;another
killing?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, master," Cottrill said. "I've been around, an' the
sheep are all right. What&mdash;was it <i>they</i> again,
then?"</p>

<p>"Things&mdash;wolf things," Tyrrell said. "Not wolves, not
dogs&mdash;not anything that lives as we live. I believe it all,
now. Straight from hell, they came&mdash;Cottrill, I must sell
the flock. It's&mdash; hopeless."</p>

<p>"No," Gees said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll pay you your fifty pounds!" Tyrrell retorted
harshly.</p>

<p>"You blasted fool! I'll ram the check down your throat!" Gees
fired back with sudden heat. "Did you think I meant that,
then?"</p>

<p>"Ram nothing!" Cottrill growled. "Who the hell are you to talk
like that to the master, after what he's been through
tonight?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Tyrrell demanded fiercely. "You told me
there would be no killings tonight, or I'd never have let
Cottrill go with you on your fool pubcrawl. What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean"&mdash;Gees took a long breath while he got back his
self-control&mdash;"that what you have seen tonight, whatever it
is, is sub-human, not supernatural, and the human is stronger
than the sub-human. I've been here one day, and already I know
enough to feel sure that if you give me time, I'll beat the sub-
human, and you can leave your flock out on the fells all night
and every night, and Cottrill here can sleep in his bed till
lambing time. And you may keep your fifty pounds!"</p>

<p>"That is, you can go right away and find these things, and
destroy them?" Tyrrell asked, and made a gibe of the
question.</p>

<p>"No," Gees answered.</p>

<p>"Then what's your certainty? What do you know&mdash;what can
you do?"</p>

<p>"Find them&mdash;put an end to it," Gees answered coolly.</p>

<p>"I've been out with him tonight, Master," Cottrill said,
almost timidly, "an' I believe he might, if you give him a
chance. He's got the brains, an' he's got the guts for it, too.
Excuse me, of course."</p>

<p>"What of your no killings tonight?" Tyrrell demanded. "There
would have been a killing, if I hadn't been here with that
gun."</p>

<p>"I was mistaken," Gees said, and the way in which he broke off
indicated that he repressed a further explanation. "Well, what
about it, Tyrrell? Do I turn the car out and go back to-morrow
morning?"</p>

<p>Tyrrell reached up and put his hand to his shoulder. He felt
the torn fabric of his coat and underclothing, and a wad of
bandage.</p>

<p>"Who tied that up?" he asked, disregarding Gees' final
question.</p>

<p>"Mr. Green," Cottrill answered, "by match light. I struck the
matches. It's a scratch&mdash;whatever did it didn't go deep,
sir."</p>

<p>"Fortunately, I had two handkerchiefs on me," Gees added.</p>

<p>They stood silent for awhile. Cottrill picked up the gun,
broke it and found it unloaded, and closed the breech again.</p>

<p>"Gees," Tyrrell said at last, "I'm an ill-conditioned swine,
and feel like one, but if you'd lived through these last six
months with us&mdash;with Cottrill and me, that is&mdash;well! I
apologize to you, and if I break out again, put it down to the
strain of this&mdash;this beastliness we're enduring. Don't go
back&mdash;stay and see it through with me, and ask me what you
like if you can restore us to normal&mdash;end it for us."</p>

<p>"Sound enough," Gees said, "and I've told you what I'll ask,
for the week or for as many months as there are days in the week.
And if you'll have patience, I will end it, soon, perhaps. I
can't say more than that, or put a limit to the time. Only, it
shall end."</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;what?" Tyrrell asked. "How much&mdash;what are
they?"</p>

<p>"I'm not telling you a thing," Gees said inflexibly. "Instead,
I want you to tell me what you know and saw&mdash;all that
happened here."</p>

<p>After another pause, Tyrrell told all that he could remember
of his vigil and what had happened at its end. By the time he had
finished the story, his voice was unsteady and he was trembling
at the recollection of the things he had seen and smelt and
felt.</p>

<p>"Then I lost consciousness," he ended, "but somehow, as if the
memory of it belonged to someone else rather than to me, I have a
sense that one of them, the whitish one, came back and stood over
me, and sniffed at me&mdash;at my shoulder where that scratch is.
It may have licked the scratch, even, though since I was dead
unconscious when you two found me, I don't know how I know this.
And it was the horrible stench that sent me off&mdash;they didn't
hurt me, except for the scratch."</p>

<p>"Licked you&mdash;yes," Gees mused. "You don't know which way
they went, do you? That isn't in your consciousness?"</p>

<p>"No, I have no idea," Tyrrell answered.</p>

<p>"No. They scared Shaun Ammon by the churchyard wall at Odder,
and then came straight here, evidently&mdash;came the same way as
you did, since you heard that stone roll, up on the path. I think
we are a little nearer locating them, but&mdash;no. Can you walk
home?"</p>

<p>"A damned silly question," Tyrrell answered, and laughed a
little. "Obviously the two of you can't carry me&mdash;I've got
to walk home."</p>

<p>"Yes, but do you feel fit for the tramp?" Gees persisted.</p>

<p>"Even if I do, we can't leave Cottrill here alone," Tyrrell
said. "Unless I stop here till morning, it means leaving the
flock unguarded, for I'm not going to take that walk in the dark
alone.""'Scuse me, sir," Cottrill broke in, "if I have this gun
an' as many cartridges as you have on you, I'll be quite happy
here alone. Your mistake was in comin' out from under the
tree&mdash; you said they didn't do anything but stand away an'
watch while you stayed under the tree&mdash;which is where I'll
stay to watch, when you go."</p>

<p>"And what the devil has the tree to do with it?" Tyrrell
demanded.</p>

<p>"Ygdrasil," Gees said.</p>

<p>"Who the devil's he, and what has he to do with the tree and
these hell's fiends that wouldn't come under it?" Tyrrell asked
again.</p>

<p>"You're right, Mr. Green," Cottrill said with deep
conviction.</p>

<p>"Are you two in conspiracy to talk double Dutch at me?"
Tyrrell asked. "What has the tree special in the way of
virtue?"</p>

<p>"Ygdrasil&mdash;the world ash," Gees said. "Never
mind&mdash;it would take half the night to explain my theory
fully, and bring in some few things altogether unconnected with
trees&mdash;and you've had enough for one night without a pack of
explanations. But Cottrill knows&mdash;hand him the cartridges,
and I'll go back with you. It'll be midnight, soon."</p>

<p>"If you could look in at my place on the way an' let Jimmy
loose, sir, I'd be glad," Cottrill asked as Tyrrell took his
remaining cartridges from his pocket and handed them over. "He'll
find me, if you just untie him. Thank ye,
sir&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;is that all?"</p>

<p>"You'll find the other two somewhere under the tree," Tyrrell
answered. "I dropped them when I was trying to reload the
gun."</p>

<p>They set off at last to climb the hillside. Cottrill, under
the ash Ygdrasil, strained his eyes toward Brownhill Scar in an
effort at seeing them as they came against the skyline. But,
though he could vaguely distinguish the outline of the height,
the mist had thickened too much for human or any other figures to
be discernible on it. He turned his coat collar up over his ears
and settled to his vigil.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Tyrrell kicked at a log in the wide fireplace of the entrance
hall of Dowlandsbar, and with a crackle a shower of sparks flew
out, proving that there was still plenty of life under the white
wood-ashes. Then he took up the whisky decanter the maid had set
out with siphon and glasses on the occasional table by the corner
of the fireplace, poured himself about half a tumbler of the
spirit, and poised the decanter over the second glass while he
looked up at Gees.</p>

<p>"One for you?" he asked. "We can do with them, I think."</p>

<p>"About half that quantity, thanks," Gees answered. "I'll
tackle it when I come down&mdash;won't be a minute."</p>

<p>He ran up the staircase, his clumsy boots thudding on the
carpet, and disappeared. Presently he came down again, still
wearing Weelum's garments, but he had donned over them a fleecy
overcoat and had exchanged the dirty cap for a tidier one of his
own. Tyrrell stared at him.</p>

<p>"Now what the devil next?" he demanded irritably.</p>

<p>"Cottrill," Gees said. "I'm going back to him. Not that I
anticipate any more trouble near the sheep tonight, but I want to
talk to him&mdash;get his views clearly. He knows more than I
thought."</p>

<p>"You mean you're going back there alone?" Tyrrell asked
incredulously. "After what happened to me&mdash;alone over the
fells?"</p>

<p>Gees took his right hand from his coat pocket, and, shining
darkly in his grasp, there showed the blued steel of a fair-sized
automatic pistol barrel. "Webley thirty-eight is going with me,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Leave it, man," Tyrrell urged. "You can see him to-
morrow."</p>

<p>"Let's get this all square," Gees said. He dropped the pistol
back in his coat pocket and squirted soda water into the glass
Tyrrell had set for him with a stiff tot of whisky. "You're all
agreed in your own mind that I'm to stay and see this business
through. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I want you to see it through," Tyrrell
assented.</p>

<p>"Then I'll see it through, but on one condition, which is that
what I say, goes. There's precious little that I shall ask of
you, or of anyone else, until the finish of it, and then I may
ask a good deal&mdash;but I want you to trust me absolutely
unless you find out I'm a dud, and not question any decision of
mine&mdash;even this one. Does that go?"</p>

<p>"I think I can promise it," Tyrrell said thoughtfully.
"Yes&mdash;I'll take your advice about it&mdash;and your
instructions, if you wish it."</p>

<p>"I shall wish it, later on," Gees admitted. He gulped down his
drink and put the glass back on the table. "I wonder if you
realize that you've had a miraculous escape from death
tonight&mdash; and death in as ugly a shape as ever a man faced,"
he added gravely.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;why didn't they make an end of me?" Tyrrell
asked.</p>

<p>"I may yet be able to answer even that question," Gees said.
"In the meantime, you'd better go to bed. See you in the
morning."</p>

<p>He went out, closing the big entrance door on himself quietly,
but saw before he went that Tyrrell was already pouring himself
another half-tumbler of whisky. Well, Gees reflected, probably he
needed it, after the experience to which he had been subjected.
Although physically intact, he was badly shaken, and the spirit
might help him to sleep.</p>

<p>The night mist had thickened still more since they had come
in, and visibility was limited to a dozen yards or less, although
the moon had risen. Through the grayness Gees could see the
narrow line of beech and elm trees which the worthies of Odder
designated a wood, an unkempt shrubbery running parallel with the
graveled drive to the gateway, with thick undergrowth of
brushwood and saplings. His big, heavily-shod feet thudded on the
gravel until he was halfway along the drive&mdash;and then with a
shiver that went all the way down his spine he stopped abruptly,
for there, in the undergrowth, at perhaps six yards distance,
burned four tiny fires. Points of reddish light, set in pairs,
and as he stood gazing at them they began to move, while he heard
the low snarling that had chilled Tyrrell's blood in Anker's
Glen.</p>

<p>His thumb pushed off the safety catch of the Webley as the
pistol came out from his pocket, and four shots, hard on each
other, crashed on the stillness. There was a howl as the glaring
eyes vanished, a crackle and flurry of the undergrowth&mdash;Gees
chanced two more shots at random, and then the front door of the
house opened to reveal light beyond the cloudiness across which
two shapes leaped, to vanish again in the hollow towards which
Dowlandsbar stood faced.</p>

<p>"Gees?" Tyrrell shouted, agitatedly. "Are you safe?"</p>

<p>"Quite safe," Gees shouted back.</p>

<p>For a minute or so he stood irresolute, and then, slowly, he
went back toward the lighted doorway. Tyrrell faced him, wide-
eyed.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what&mdash;?" He seemed unable to end the
question.</p>

<p>"Waiting for me," Gees answered. "I didn't expect that, so
soon. But&mdash;I don't think I'll go to Cottrill tonight, not
even with Mr. Webley to keep me company. They won't go after him,
but they might follow me and attack again from behind. No&mdash;I
think I'll go to bed."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, so soon?" Tyrrell asked.</p>

<p>"If I were you," Gees said slowly, "I'd tell Feather he
needn't organise that drive for Friday. Yes&mdash;he'd better
cancel it."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to tell him that?" Tyrrell asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. It would be quite useless, and a waste of his time
too."</p>

<p>"Look here! How much do you know?" Tyrrell demanded
impatiently.</p>

<p>"All of it, except what, exactly, is doing all this. Something
not quite material, though material enough to be felt and seen
and smelt. The old dead, perhaps&mdash;and perhaps not. Give me
time, man."</p>

<p>He went and stood gazing into the fireplace: the log that
Tyrrell had stirred was almost enveloped in pale flame, now; down
in front of it were embers red as the eyes that had glowed at him
from the copse beside the drive&mdash;glowed by virtue of the
inward fire of the things to which they belonged, for there had
been no other light for them to reflect. Glowed, Gees felt, like
points of the fires of hell.</p>

<p>"They live, but not as we live," he said, half to himself.
"Drinking warm blood, rending raw flesh, like lions and all the
cat tribe&mdash;and yet&mdash;pah! More dog-like, wolf-
like&mdash;I saw them as they went across the light.
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four people have seen them
tonight. No&mdash;three, though. Utterly evil&mdash;well, some of
them would be that, though not all."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you talking about?" Tyrrell questioned.</p>

<p>Gees turned to face him. "Do you know the 'Fairy Song'?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No, I don't. What have fairy songs to do with things like
these?"</p>

<p>"'They laugh, and are glad, and are terrible'," Gees quoted.
"Good night, Tyrrell&mdash;I'm off to bed."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; AMBER</h2>

<p class="first">TYRRELL removed the cover from the chafing dish,
and revealed yet another egg reposing among pinkish scrolls of
fried bacon.</p>

<p>"Ought a man to eat three of them at breakfast?" Gees
inquired.</p>

<p>"Hand me your plate," Tyrrell responded, "but you say it's the
air again, I'll heave the dish at you."</p>

<p>"It would be a pity to waste that one," Gees observed, passing
his plate, "and you couldn't warm up the bacon very well,
either."</p>

<p>Later, as he applied himself to toast and marmalade, Tyrrell
inquired if he had made any plans for the day.</p>

<p>"Several," he admitted. "As a beginning, if you don't mind my
using your telephone, I want a word with Eve Madeleine."</p>

<p>"With who?" Tyrrell asked, obviously startled by the name,
Gees conjectured, for he could think of nothing else startling in
his reply.</p>

<p>"Shush, man!" he admonished gravely. "You mean with whom,
surely. Eve Madeleine, I said. My secretary&mdash;I have to call
her Miss Brandon to her face, but as soon as she's out of sight
she becomes Eve Madeleine, and it really is her name, too. One of
these days I shall get it mixed and either call her Miss
Madeleine or Eve Brandon to her face, and then she'll walk out on
me and I'll have to get another."</p>

<p>"You are an ass!" Tyrrell observed. "A remarkably charming
girl, I thought, when I called to see you the other day."</p>

<p>"The other day!" Gees echoed thoughtfully. "It's hardly
credible that this is only my second breakfast here. Things are
humming."</p>

<p>"None of what has happened seems credible, in daylight,"
Tyrrell said. "And after telephoning? You said you had several
plans."</p>

<p>"Principally, a talk with the archeological parson you told me
you keep. The Reverend Walter Edward Amber, vicar of Odder, M.A.,
of Balliol, one s., one d. How long has he had the living?"</p>

<p>"A good thirty years," Tyrrell answered. "Where did you get
those particulars?" He sounded rather constrained, Gees thought.
Gyda McCoul had explained that there was a feud between her
father and the vicar, and, of course, Tyrrell sided with the
McCouls for her sake.</p>

<p>"Most of them from an ordinary work of reference I found on a
shelf in your hall," he answered. "Also, I've met the s., when I
was boozing with Cottrill last night. A most objectionable pup, I
thought him&mdash;the s., not Cottrill. I trust the father is a
better type."</p>

<p>"He's&mdash;well, rather a hot-tempered man," Tyrrell said
slowly. "A Gael from Caithness, though you'd never guess it by
his accent. His people are landowners up there, with hardly a
sixpence among them."</p>

<p>"Poor and proud, eh?" Gees suggested. "And since he came from
wild country like that, he doesn't mind a place like this. But
how does a man from Caithness happen to get educated at
Balliol?"</p>

<p>"You'd better ask him," Tyrrell said rather irritably. "And if
you don't like this country, why breathe on it? What's wrong with
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," Gees answered. "The air is wonderful&mdash;if
you so much as lift that dish, I'll throw the marmalade pot!
Another point while I think of it. What made the McCouls come and
settle in a place like this? A girl like that, you'd think, would
hardly."</p>

<p>"Ask McCoul, if you want to know," Tyrrell snapped,
interrupting. "The place is good enough for us who live in
it&mdash;all of us."</p>

<p>Having finished his breakfast, Gees pushed back his chair,
lighted himself a cigarette, and looked at his watch. He shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Too early, yet, to call Eve Madeleine," he observed.
"Tyrrell, if you'll accept the remark in the spirit in which it
is spoke, it's not only Gaels from Caithness who are hot
tempered. If you came to Piccadilly Circus and asked me why Eros
wasn't wearing a chest protector, or remarked that the girls
round there looked lonely, I wouldn't get all hot and bothered.
I'm merely trying to get the hang of things here."</p>

<p>"And adding a few comments as you go on," Tyrrell
interrupted.</p>

<p>"I won't crab the country any more. After all, if you had
factories and cinemas and char-a-bancs, you'd only get smoke and
petrol fumes and spoil this marvelous air&mdash;leave that dish
alone, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Tyrrell laughed as he stubbed out his cigarette end and stood
up.</p>

<p>"But you'll have to make this visit to the vicar without any
sponsorship from me," he remarked, suddenly grave again. "And I
suppose I'd better tell you, though&mdash;well!" He made a long
pause, as if doubtful about the telling, and then resumed. "You
see, my father and Amber were great friends, and young Harold and
his sister and I&mdash;Harold was no more than a baby, of course,
for most of it&mdash;well, we sort of grew up together, if you
understand. They were as free of this place as I was of the
vicarage&mdash;I don't know why I'm telling you all this."</p>

<p>"I think I do, though," Gees said thoughtfully. "It's not so
much because of Amber himself that I'm to see him on my
own&mdash;isn't that it? Nor because of Harold, if you want the
t's crossed and i's dotted."</p>

<p>"I had an idea you'd understand," Tyrrell assented gratefully.
"A thing like that is difficult to put into words, and I
feel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Guilty about the girl," Gees thought but did not say. "Well,"
he said aloud, "all this is irrelevant to my purpose in seeing
Amber, and it merely puts me <i>au fait</i> to an extent that
prevents me from putting my foot into things&mdash;and believe
me, it's some foot, mine! Now, I think, I'll go and have a word
with Eve Madeleine, and if she hasn't got there I shall get 'no
reply' and it won't cost anything. Where do you keep your
telephone, though?"</p>

<p>"In the hall. Open the wall cabinet on the left of the
fireplace, and you'll see it sitting inside. Microphone
instrument&mdash;quite modern. That and the electric lighting
plant are my concessions to your style of living, but I wouldn't
have a wireless set if you paid me."</p>

<p>"Stout feller," Gees observed. "Persevere in that
resolve."</p>

<p>He went out to the entrance hall and found the telephone, with
a comfortable chair before it in which to wait after he had
called Trunks. And, presently, he heard his secretary's voice
announcing her identity, or rather, his own, under the pseudonym
he used for his office.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gees at this end, too," he told her. "I won't tell you
anything about myself, except that it's marvelous air here. What
have you at your end of the table? Any inquiries worth following
up?"</p>

<p>"Only one," she answered. "A man in Sussex suspects his wife
of being poisoned&mdash;she's still alive, but unwell, he writes,
and he's afraid of being suspected of poisoning her and thinks
you might&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you got his initial two guineas consultation fee?" Gees
interrupted. "If not, get it. If you have, arrange him a
consultation for&mdash;let me see. Yes, a week from today, at
eleven-thirty."</p>

<p>"I haven't got it yet," she said. "I'll write and suggest it
and tell him&mdash;you expect to be back a week from today,
then?"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Brandon, I'd hate to suggest his coming all the
way up here! If I'm not back then, and he sends the two guineas,
it will be quite easy to write and put him off till I do get
back."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see. Of course," she assented. "But the wife may
die."</p>

<p>"He'll be no worse off," Gees responded cheerfully. "That is,
if he's suspected of poisoning, attempted murder is nearly as bad
as murder, and so he'll only be a little worse off. Anything
else?"</p>

<p>"No, except for inquiries I needn't trouble to report to
you."</p>

<p>"There's one born every minute, of course," he remarked. "But
I want you to do something for me, Miss Brandon, which is my main
reason for ringing you. Pack and send me as quickly as you can
the most informative work on Norse mythology you can lay hands
on&mdash;try Bumpus and the Times Book Club, and Hatchard, and
anyone else you can think of, and get the best&mdash;not the
<i>Golden Bough</i>, though. I know pretty much all there is in
that. Any book specially devoted to the Norse gods and legends,
and hurry it."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Green. It shall go off today."</p>

<p>"Add to that, anything you can lay hands on which gives
Druidical and pre-Druidical rites and observances in this
country, going back to the flint age, if possible. I don't know
where you'll find that, but look up the bibliography of the
subject in the <i>Britannica</i>, and get and send me something.
What's that?... I said, Druidical and pre-Druidical&mdash;you
know, the chaps who used to sacrifice to the mistletoe and wear
woad-de-chine&mdash;woad! Blue paint. Druids. Oh, Lord!"</p>

<p>"I understand, Mr. Green. Ancient Britons."</p>

<p>"They're the ones. But don't forget the flint age too."</p>

<p>"Very good, Mr. Green. Both books shall go off today."</p>

<p>"And in case you want to talk to me, the telephone number here
is Odder, six. Odder, short for more peculiar." He spelt it out.
"And that's all for now. Spare no expense over the books,
though."</p>

<p>"It is more peculiar, too," he said to himself as he replaced
the microphone and closed the cabinet, "and now Ho for
Amber&mdash;Amber, Ho!"</p>

<p>Tyrrell, entering the hall in time to hear the final
apostrophe, shook his head as Gees turned to face him.</p>

<p>"One would think you were enjoying these horrors," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"It's the&mdash;well, the climate is invigorating," Gees
answered. "I'm not enjoying the horrors any more than you are,
but, as I assured you last night, they are not going to last much
longer. And it's a conviction of mine that if you try to live on
a high note all the time, you break down. High C occasionally,
but B natural for everyday use."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">To use his own expression, Gees turned out the buzzwagon for
his visit to Odder vicarage. In ordinary language, he started up
the Rolls-Bentley and went down the drive in it, but, after he
had got into the lane, he changed his mind and reversed to drive
back and run the car into the big shed where the ancient two-
seater that contented Tyrrell was also stabled. When he came back
to the frontage of the house, Tyrrell hailed him from the
doorstep of the main entrance.</p>

<p>"Changed your mind about going, eh?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Partly," Gees answered. "One sees so much more, on foot."</p>

<p>He kept on and, emerging again from the gateway, plodded along
the lane, crossed the narrow stone bridge, and so came up abreast
the monoliths marking the main entrance to Locksborough Castle.
There he halted, and gazed along the short, grassy track that
ended before the keep.</p>

<p>"Oomph!" he mused. "Strong enough, till firearms came in."</p>

<p>There was no sign of life about the place. The massive square
of the keep towered high, apparently as sound and strong as the
builders had left it: round, it stretched a ruined wall, in some
parts not a foot above ground level, in others rising to eight
feet or so, and sometimes altogether razed, though the line of it
was easy to trace. Altogether, it enclosed four acres or more of
ground, including that on which the keep stood, and within the
enclosure were ruined fragments of other buildings that had been,
all of grey stone or flint work. Like most of the strongholds of
its day, the castle and its adjacent buildings had formed a
complete community, the retainers and craftsmen of the place
being within call of their feudal lord. And round and about, from
Odder on the one side to Dowlandsbar on the other, were tracts of
fertile land in the valleys that might support cattle and sheep,
or, broken up from pasturage, bear corn crops for the people of
the castle.</p>

<p>There were, too, as Gees saw, lines and mounds denoting older
fortifications: the moat remained, dry, now, and filled in to a
grassy, level strip from bank to bank before the entrance to the
keep, which showed as an inconspicuous doorway in the mighty
stone wall, with, above it, arrow slit windows which, as Gees
knew, admitted more light to the interior than one would guess
from an outside survey. But, disconnected and altogether apart
from the ridge raised by excavating the moat, other raised lines
of turf, sunken, perhaps, in the many centuries since they had
been heaped up, until they were but little above the normal
level, ran maze-like about the edges of the slight eminence. It
had evidently appealed to successive races as worthy of being
fortified: Romans, as Gees knew already had built on it; those
trenches and a long barrow at the far side from the lane pointed
to works perhaps even earlier than those of the Roman occupation,
and perhaps to Danish or even Saxon work, while the two remaining
monoliths by the entrance were obviously pre-Roman. Up into
mediaeval times, and perhaps later, Locksborough had certainly
been a place of some importance.</p>

<p>Now, outwardly, it was a ruin, for the sky showed through the
top-most arrow-slit of the keep&mdash;McCoul must have roofed in
the part that he used at a lower level than that slit, which
marked what had been the highest story. And of him and his
daughter, and of Shaun Ammon, Gees could see nothing, though he
stood at gaze by the gateway for some minutes. At last he went
on, crossed the ridge beyond, and dropped down into Odder to see
a squat, square grey house quite near the church, a dwelling of
far too imposing a size and character to rank in with the
cottages, though it was of less content, evidently, than
Dowlandsbar. By its position and character, Gees decided it was
the vicarage, and made his way there to pull at an old-fashioned
bell-handle beside the pale, weathered oaken door, at which a
clangorous tolling sounded within.</p>

<p>A dumpy little maidservant, strikingly like the one who waited
at table at Dowlandsbar, opened to him after a very brief
interval, and in answer to his inquiry for Mr. Amber requested
him to step inside. He waited in a narrow hallway, and presently
found himself facing an elderly man of middle height, red-haired,
and with keen, kindly grey eyes. A dog-collar proclaimed his
calling: but for his wearing it, Gees would have taken him for a
farmer who preferred black attire.</p>

<p>"Mr. Green, I think," he said by way of opening. "Do come in
and sit down." He gestured at the door by which he had come into
the hall.</p>

<p>Gees preceded him into the room and saw, seated by the
fireplace at its far side, a woman taller than and little less
old than Amber: she had been beautiful in her youth, Gees
decided, and was still more than normally attractive of feature
as well as of expression.</p>

<p>"My wife, Mr. Green," Amber said. "My dear, this is the
gentleman staying with Mr. Tyrrell. Do sit down, Mr. Green, won't
you?"</p>

<p>Gees acknowledged the introduction, and turned again to Amber.
"Yes, but how do you know my name and where I am, before I've
even spoken?" he inquired with a smile.</p>

<p>Amber smiled too. "Our Jenny and Mr. Tyrrell's Annie are
sisters," he explained. "All Odder knows about you and your
wonderful car."</p>

<p>"I see," Gees remarked, and seated himself in the chair the
vicar indicated. "Gath and the streets of Astalon aren't in it
with Odder."</p>

<p>Mrs. Amber laughed, a friendly, cheery little laugh. "We have
so little to gossip about," she half-apologized, "and according
to Jenny, you are here to put an end to the sheep-killing at
Dowlandsbar."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, that is so," Gees admitted, realizing that it would
be useless to deny it, and mentally damning Tyrrell for
announcing the fact. Probably Tyrrell had spoken of it in
advance, for Gees could not recollect his mentioning
his&mdash;Gees'&mdash;purpose in his maid's hearing. And, with
Jenny's sister in Tyrrell's household, Gees realized, there could
be little going on at Dowlandsbar that was not known here.</p>

<p>"You will be doing us all a great service," Amber said. "There
are all sorts of stories going about the village and round the
cottages in the fells for miles&mdash;about these killings. A
revival of old superstitions, and a general fear of something
uncanny."</p>

<p>"It was concerning that side of it, sir, that I ventured to
come and see you," Gees stated. "I'm afraid&mdash;well, it is
uncanny."</p>

<p>Amber glanced at his wife. "Perhaps you would like to come
into my study for a little while," he suggested. "I
think&mdash;you will understand, my dear. Either of the children
might come in while we talk."</p>

<p>"In other words, Mr. Green, he's afraid my nerves won't stand
it," Mrs. Amber said. "Perhaps he's right, though. But I hope to
see you again before you go&mdash;can you stay to lunch with
us?"</p>

<p>"It's awfully good of you," he answered, while the vicar
waited by the door of the room. "Some other day&mdash;no, though,
I will accept. Tyrrell will understand when I don't come
back."</p>

<p>"You can telephone him&mdash;we are civilized enough for
that," she said. "I'm glad you can stay&mdash;now go and talk
your secrets."</p>

<p>She spoke with sincere friendliness, Gees felt. Though he had
been in the house only a few minutes, he liked its atmosphere,
liked these people, and felt himself among friends as he entered
the vicar's untidy study and seated himself at the latter's
invitation. Amber drew up a chair for himself, sat down, and
polished a pair of glasses with his handkerchief before fitting
them on his nose.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Green, how can I help you?" he asked gravely.</p>

<p>"So far, though I've hardly known you five minutes, you've
helped me by merely being alive," Gees responded with equal
gravity. "But as to this particular matter you're an enthusiastic
archeologist, I understand. Conversant with pretty much all there
is to know about Odder and its surrounding country&mdash;and
ruins."</p>

<p>"Well, that would be saying a good deal," Amber hedged. "Say
that I am interested in the subject&mdash;and have been all my
life."</p>

<p>"Concerning Locksborough Castle, now," Gees suggested.</p>

<p>He saw the vicar's mouth tighten, and waited through a long
pause.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;you mean its history, I suppose?" The question came
at last.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I understand you would not be inclined to talk
about its present-day state&mdash;or its occupants either."</p>

<p>"On the other hand," Amber said slowly, "I have no objection
to saying to anyone that the man McCoul was rude to me, most
rude, with no reason or provocation whatever, and that I will
have nothing to do with him until he apologizes. Which," he
ended, "is not likely to happen."</p>

<p>"Then we'll leave him alone, for the time being," Gees
suggested. "The history of the place, and any legends,
especially."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, the castle was built by Guillaume de
Boisgeant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Couldn't you begin before that?" Gees interrupted. "A long
while before. Those two stones by the gateway for a start,
say&mdash;or earlier."</p>

<p>"The legendary period, eh?" The vicar smiled, as if not ill-
pleased at finding one interested in his own subject.
"Understand, there is only legend, nothing really certain before
de Boisgeant's time."</p>

<p>"I think the legendary period will interest me most of all,"
Gees observed quietly, and offered a cigarette which the vicar
accepted. He took one for himself, and lighted them both.</p>

<p>"You have a reason in asking&mdash;or no?" Amber inquired.</p>

<p>"A most decided reason&mdash;the object of my visit here."</p>

<p>"I see-e." He sounded gravely reflective. "Well, Mr. Green,
there are some things I should prefer not to state without good
reason, because they lie outside the province of the Thirty-nine
Articles. I am, as perhaps you do not know, Celtic by
birth&mdash; Gaelic, in fact, and perhaps, in my study of my
hobby, which is old things and old times, I have come to give
credence to things which ordinary people would regard as
fantastic&mdash;non-existent things, from the material view-
point. And it is understood between us that whatever I
say&mdash;" He paused, and gazed at his guest as if he preferred
only to imply the rest.</p>

<p>"I came to you for help," Gees said. "Whatever you tell me,
you tell me only. And&mdash;very few things are fantastic, I am
finding out."</p>

<p>"So! Well, Locksborough Castle&mdash;yes. The name, by the
way, is a corruption of Loki's Barrow&mdash;the place never was a
borough, though in old time it had a certain importance. And Loki
was the god of deceit and illusion in Norse mythology&mdash;the
deity of evil, in fact."</p>

<p>"Alternatively, Dalua," Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"Ah! You're not altogether a neophyte in these paths, I see.
Yes, analogous, say. But if you want all the story, we must go
back beyond Loki&mdash;or Loge, as he becomes in the Wagnerian
legend and in German."</p>

<p>"I certainly do want all the story," Gees said decidedly.</p>

<p>"I did a little digging there when I was younger and more
energetic, after getting permission from the then owner to
disturb the turf," Amber said. "The north trench and its
corresponding&mdash;parapet, I suppose you would call
it&mdash;gave me evidence of very early occupation indeed. I
found eleven flint arrow-heads, and two stone hatchets, most
beautifully worked, and another implement which I took to be a
scraper&mdash;used for scraping skins before dressing them. The
curator of York Museum, whom I happen to know and who is a final
court of appeal on such matters, confirmed my opinion on this.
And then I traced and mapped those early earthworks, defining
them, as nearly as I could, apart from the later work. I believe,
if the site were fully excavated, it would prove as rich in
traces of early man in Britain as Maiden Castle in Dorset, or,
say, Avebury. There was certainly a settlement there, and those
early men fortified it after their fashion. Cleverly, too."</p>

<p>"And-?" Gees asked. "The type of men they were, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Flint men, one may call them," the vicar said, half-musingly.
"I should say they had a religion of sorts in their later stages,
they probably erected the monoliths, and almost certainly most of
those standing stones were cut and used in the building of the
castle, long later. Put the first race as existing between two
and three thousand years ago, and perhaps farther back than that.
A people who believed in fierce gods, made human sacrifices to
them, and were fierce themselves. Evil, from our point of view.
They are the race that our people here call the 'old dead,' and
undoubtedly they had an extensive settlement on the site. I do
not think the Druid cult prevailed here, in spite of the
monoliths. I believe this was a fiercer, less cultured and more
bloodthirsty race dying out before the Roman occupation, and
leaving behind, among the early British inhabitants of the
country, a legend of evil&mdash;staining the site, as one might
say, with cruelties that would cause it to be regarded as
haunted. By the victims of the cruelties, possibly, but more
probably by the authors of them."</p>

<p>"And that belief persisted," Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"Among such Britons as inhabited here, though they were
sparse, being on the edge of the Pict country," the vicar
answered. "Still, even in those days there were probably flocks
of sheep about these fells&mdash;the Britons were a far more
civilized race than is generally credited today, and the good
grazing would bring their flocks here. Then came the Romans, and
they seized on the site as admirable for a stronghold. They had
no fears of hauntings, being a practical people, and this, before
the wall was built, was in my opinion one of their citadels. It
ought to be excavated&mdash;nobody knows what treasures of the
Roman occupation lie under that turf. But apparently, in these
days, there is money for everything but the extension of
knowledge. Research, in every direction, limps and
starves&mdash;the possibility of war takes all the money, and
places like this keep their secrets."</p>

<p>"And, after the Roman occupation?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"Danish realization of the strength of the site," Amber
answered unhesitatingly, "and now we come to something more like
certainty, although it must still be regarded as legend. But,
well inside the fortifications of the flint men, there is a long
barrow. I should say that, inside it and well below the present
ground level, there is a long ship buried with the Viking to whom
it belonged by the place where the steering oar or rudder came in
to the afterdeck, and his arms beside him. I don't know if you
know that that was a custom of theirs?"</p>

<p>Gees shook his head. "I didn't know it," he confessed.</p>

<p>"It was so. When some famous man died, they buried him with
his ship. And this, I think, was a pirate of the worst
sort&mdash;Loki's barrow, remember. The god of deceit, the god of
evil. From somewhere, perhaps from service with the Irish kings
of that day, this Viking sailed into Solway, perhaps, or perhaps
beached his ship somewhere near the coast where Silloth stands
today, or came in as far as Whitrigg, and then came ravaging
inland with his crew. They may have found Picts here, since the
Romans had gone long since&mdash;whatever they found, they ousted
it and took possession, and when the captain of the long ship
died they hauled it here and buried him in it&mdash;in that long
barrow at Locksborough. And heaven alone knows what atrocities
they committed to make their occupation safe. There is a
tale&mdash;I don't believe it, myself&mdash;that on the eleventh
of October every year the old Viking comes out from his barrow
and can be seen on it, winged helmet and byrnie and all the rest
of his war gear, challenging any who will to come and fight with
him. According to the legend, one of the de Boisgeants did sally
out from the castle to take up the challenge, and after fighting
the specter withered away and died."</p>

<p>"Interesting," Gees observed. "I hope to be back in London
before the eleventh of October. If not, I shall stay in bed that
night."</p>

<p>"Thorfinn Thorfinnsson, the Viking in question, has not
appeared on any of the occasions that I have watched for him,"
the vicar said.</p>

<p>"Oh, you took that much trouble?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"I did. He existed, past question, and I believe he is buried
on the site, long ship and all. Now, since you seem interested, a
digression. Have you ever heard of the Daione Shih&mdash;Duione
Sidhe"&mdash;he spelt out both forms of the words&mdash;"the
Shee, as they are best known?"</p>

<p>Gees quoted:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"There was a breeze in the whispering fern.<br>
And a star that danced in the stream.<br>
When the Men of Peace came riding by<br>
Betwixt a dream and a dream.<br>
'Twixt Beltane fire and Hallow-e'en<br>
Men that have sight may see<br>
The hosts who pass, nor stir the grass&mdash;<br>
The riding of the Shee."</p>

<p><br>
"Ah! The woman who wrote that had genius," Amber said "'Men
that have sight'&mdash;it is not a pleasant gift, that sight, as
I know. But by that sight I know you have a purpose in what you
have asked me, Mr. Green, or I should not be telling you all
this."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I came to the right man," Gees observed.</p>

<p>The vicar smiled. "If you did," he retorted. "But where was I?
Yes&mdash;you mentioned Dalua, before I began telling all
this."</p>

<p>"I did. Identical with Loki, I make him."</p>

<p>"Practically. There are differences. Dalua belongs to the Erse
legends, and is almost purely Erse. Loki, who is supposed to
watch over Thorfinn Thorfinnsson in his barrow&mdash;and to watch
to this day, too!&mdash;belongs in the Norse mythology. That
is"&mdash;a dreamy look took the keenness from his grey
eyes&mdash;"if it is no more than mythology."</p>

<p>"You mean-?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"I mean that men can create evil by their thoughts," the vicar
answered slowly. "Words, and even thoughts, are vibrations that
go on endlessly, and so with beliefs. I think that when the
belief in the old Norse gods was strong, they
existed&mdash;Valhalla fell because belief died out, and its gods
failed for lack of human support, but enough belief may remain in
superstition and fear to give them a shadowy life to this day.
And if ever superstition and fear centred round a place, it is
round Locksborough, and very much alive in these last six
months."</p>

<p>"Giving renewed vitality to Loki, you would say?"</p>

<p>"I see you understand&mdash;yes. Reanimating the evil of the
place&mdash;I have not begun on the de Boisgeants, yet, and I'm
afraid you find me long-winded on my pet subject. If
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," Gees interrupted. "It is all
valuable."</p>

<p>"Yes. I believe you are on the right track, Mr. Green, though
materialists would laugh at both of us. Yes. Well, let us
consider Loki and Dalua as identical, and turn to Erse legend for
a moment. Do you know, by any chance, the legend of Eochaid and
Etain, originally written by Fiona McLeod, and turned into the
opera <i>The Immortal Hour</i> by Rutland Boughton? The substance
of the legend, mean?"</p>

<p>"Quite well," Gees answered. "Dalua promised Eochaid
happiness&mdash; Eochaid was a king in Ireland, young and
romantic, and Dalua promised him happiness much as Mephistopheles
promised Faust. Dalua, as I remember it, brought Eochaid and
Etain together, and the king married her, and at the end of a
year Etain went off with Midir, prince of the fairy folk, back to
her own people, and left Eochaid desolate."</p>

<p>"Near enough," the vicar said. "Add in that Etain was not
human at all, but was a daughter of the Shee&mdash;the fairy
folk. Then add in that when Midir tempted her away from Eochaid,
she left behind with him a child&mdash;it may have been daughter,
or it may have been son. But it was only half-human, and that
strain of the Shee persisted in the race to which Eochaid
belonged. It may have been that the Shee kept an interest in the
child, and brought it in touch with their own kind when it grew
up. There may have been other interminglings of the human and the
Men of Peace, as I should call them in my own country, and
probably there were. So that, to this very day, the strain
persists."</p>

<p>For a long time Gees sat silent. Then he looked the vicar
straight in the eyes, and met an unwavering, sincere gaze.</p>

<p>"That's a strange thing for a man of your profession to say,
Mr. Amber," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I know," the vicar answered quietly. "In this room."</p>

<p>"Certainly," Gees assented. "Even if I did so much as mention
it outside&mdash;which I wouldn't dream of doing&mdash;I should
only raise a laugh from my hearers."</p>

<p>"Not all of them, if they belonged to this district," Amber
dissented. "But now, for a moment or two, the Duoine
Sidhe&mdash;the Shee."</p>

<p>"Legend pure and simple," Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"Simple, say," the vicar dissented again. "There must be some
Celtic blood in you, Mr. Green, judging by your patience with
these fantastic theories. Never mind. You must consider the Shee
as timeless ones, knowing nothing of human ageing or the passing
of time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Immortal, say," Gees interposed.</p>

<p>"No. Oh, no! Get that out of your head at once. Not subject to
human ailments, or changeable by age, as we are, but far from
immortal. Etain and her descendants, Midir and his kind, in human
shape, could be destroyed. I repeat that&mdash;could be
destroyed." He looked at Gees in an intent way, as if he would
put all the insistence he could into the statement. "Don't think
for one moment that they are immortal."</p>

<p>"Subject, say, to the accidents of humanity," Gees
suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;otherwise, the Shee would people the earth, and
possibly subdue humanity, since we neglect all but the material,"
the vicar assented. "As it is, they are a failing race, for they
have no children among themselves. Only as when Etain came to
Eochaid&mdash;and because of that, they take human shape and size
and try desperately to mate with the human race. Else, they must
eventually die out altogether."</p>

<p>"And that," Gees said, "is why Tyrrell was not torn to pieces
in Anker's Glen last night."</p>

<p>"I don't get that," the vicar said quickly. "What was it?"</p>

<p>"No, please! I've come to get all you can tell me&mdash;I'll
tell you about this later, if you like. Back to the
Shee&mdash;the fairy folk."</p>

<p>"One thing," the vicar said earnestly. "You must not regard
the Shee as evil&mdash;many of them are beneficent beings. As
with humanity, there are good and evil among them&mdash;some
devoted to Dalua, some to better and even noble ideals. But, all
the time&mdash; and they are out of time&mdash;soulless, and
therefore heartless, as we conceive those words. Feelingless,
say&mdash;unable to enter into human emotions, though they may
seem just as capable as was Etain of feeling&mdash;of love."</p>

<p>"Seem," Gees commented. "But, in reality&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They counterfeit human emotions to attract human beings,"
Amber stated. "If there is reality in it&mdash;I do not know. No
human being can ever know. But of fixity of
purpose&mdash;nothing, beyond the one aim. To perpetuate the
race, to achieve survival&mdash;and it is many a day since they
dared to face humanity, to assert that such a race exists."</p>

<p>"Because they are sub-human," Gees observed after a pause.</p>

<p>"Quite so! You have them in legend&mdash;the rhymes of true
Thomas, and others of the kind. Mr. Green, they do exist! You may
think I violate the creed by which I live in saying it,
but&mdash;they do exist."</p>

<p>"Are we&mdash;or are we not&mdash;getting rather away from
Locksborough Castle in this?" Gees asked. "I believe
you&mdash;the Shee do exist."</p>

<p>"And we are not getting away," the vicar insisted earnestly.
"Don't you see that&mdash;there you have a place stained and
soaked in evil, and I have more to tell you on that point yet. A
place, humanly speaking, abhorrent, haunted by evil, if not by
visible ghosts, and a place from which all the people of the
district shy away. What more probable than that the more evil of
the Shee, the dregs that sub-human race, say, should use it,
haunt it, come there to consort with their familiars..."</p>

<p>He broke off and sat thoughtful. There seemed to Gees
something that he had been about to say, and had not said.</p>

<p>"And all this time," Gees said, "I have not mentioned McCoul's
name!"</p>

<p>"Nor I," Amber said quickly. "If I accused a fellow human
being of having traffic with these Men of Peace, without just and
full cause, I should be guilty of a sin which will not be
forgiven either in this world or the next. I am telling you
legend, and no more."</p>

<p>"The legend of Eochaid and Etain," Gees said thoughtfully. He
remembered how, at dinner with Tyrrell, Gyda McCoul had appeared
fearful at the mere mention of that legend. "Yes. And you say
they are timeless&mdash;that is, out of time as far as age is
concerned. Yes. So if, assuming such a thing could be, Etain
appeared today, she would be just as young and just as charming
as when she persuaded Eochaid to take her as his queen&mdash;for
the year that ended so badly for him?"</p>

<p>"She would be unchanged," Amber assented. "If it could
happen."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything to prevent it from happening?" Gees
asked.</p>

<p>"I must own, I had not considered such a thing," the vicar
admitted.</p>

<p>"No? Well, think it over. And you said you had more to tell
me, about the subsequent reasons for the avoidance of
Locksborough by the local inhabitants. Concerning this de
Boisgeant, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The vicar had no chance to answer. The door of the room
appeared to fall inward, and Gees looked up and started up at the
appearance of a girl who, charging into the room, blew away the
illusion of yesterdays that the two men had created between them.
All Gees could tell in that first sight of her was that she had
chestnut-red hair that would have set Roussetti aflame with
longing for his palette and brushes and all his genius for
reproduction on canvas, and eyes like the vicar's own, but of a
deeper, more sea-like blue-grey. She halted in midcourse, and
stared at this unexpected stranger as he stood up.</p>

<p>"Oh, daddy, I've just come in," she said. "I didn't know you
were not alone in here. Where's&mdash;I'm so sorry! I didn't
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear," Amber said, "don't run away. This is Mr. Green, who
is staying at Dowlandsbar and lunching with us today. I was just
about to tell him the history of the de Boisgeants at
Locksborough when you fell&mdash;yes, fell, by the way of
it&mdash;into the room and interrupted us."</p>

<p>"I didn't fall at all, Mr. Green," the girl said, with a shy
smile at him. "And, since daddy won't finish the introduction,
I'm Madeleine Amber, though everybody calls me Madge,
and&mdash;it's so nice to see anybody new in these wilds. Daddy,
what do I do? Is this all quite private, or may I hear about the
sins of the de Boisgeants again? Mr. Green, don't let him throw
me out. It's too fascinating, and he's so clever about it. I
believe he's ferreted out everything there is to know about that
fiendish family."</p>

<p>The vicar looked at his watch. "Lunch is in half an hour," he
said. "I don't think we need mind her hearing the history of the
de Boisgeants, Mr. Green. She knows it fairly well."</p>

<p>"Having met Miss Amber," Gees said, "I should hate to part
from her until I'm forced to it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Green," she said severely, "You were obviously born a
flatterer. Now be honest, and tell me to get out because I'm not
wanted."</p>

<p>"I'll be perfectly honest," he answered. "You'll find this
quite a comfortable chair, and it's so nice to see anybody new in
these wilds. If you go away, I shall feel desolate&mdash;and the
tale of the de Boisgeants won't suffer, sir?" he added, turning
to the vicar. "I hope not, because I'm here to get all the story
you can tell me."</p>

<p>"As far as that part of it goes," Amber said, "I can assure
you that Madge's presence will make no difference at all&mdash;if
she chooses to stay, that is. She knows it all so well already."
He looked at the girl, who gave Gees a smile which declared her
intention.</p>

<p>"Daddy's being pontifical," she remarked, "Those de
Boisgeants&mdash; Mr. Green, if you call them dirty dogs, you
won't be exceeding the speed limit. A Rolls-Bentley, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," he agreed, "but the speed would frighten the de
Boisgeants. We're centuries behind them in our talk. Can it
possibly interest a lady so obviously modern?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Green," she said calmly, "I understand that daddy is
going to tell you about the sins of the de Boisgeants, and when
did you ever meet a member of my sex who was not interested in
anyone's sins, either of yesterday or today? Why, we live on
them!"</p>

<p>"Madge, darling!" the vicar exclaimed feebly.</p>

<p>"Proceed, daddy," she commanded. "I can almost see Mr. Green's
ears waggling. He wants to know the sins of the de Boisgeants.
What I don't know about them isn't worth knowing. Daddy,
proceed."</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; MADELEINE AMBER</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a minute or two Amber disregarded his
daughter's injunction and sat silent, while the girl, seating
herself on the arm of his chair, smiled in a friendly way at
Gees. She had just as fine features as her mother, and a wild-
rose complexion slightly tanned by sun and wind; there was about
her an utter un-self-consciousness that added to her
attractiveness, and Gees, remembering what Tyrrell had implied
concerning her, felt that the man was a fool. This child of the
open with her very obvious sense of humor was worth ten of an
exotic being like Gyda McCoul: the contrast between them, was, to
use Gees' own simile, that between high C and B natural. If,
eventually, Tyrrell did marry Gyda, as seemed to be his intent,
he would be compelled to live in an intensity that might and
probably would prove wearing: with this girl, he would have found
comradeship and a far saner happiness. But it was his affair:
Gyda had fascinated him: she might so far fit into the life he
lived as to content him, but it was doubtful if she could adapt
herself to that extent, and, from what Gees had seen of Tyrrell,
the man was incapable of adapting himself at all. Madeleine
Amber, at this first meeting, showed herself as capable of
sympathy and understanding and, with no loss of her own
individuality, as one who would fit her life to that of the man
she chose. So Gees saw her, and on better acquaintance found no
cause to modify his judgment.</p>

<p>"Yes," the vicar said at last, "the de Boisgeants. There is in
existence a script written by Mancius, a monk of York, and
because of what was done by the de Boisgeants of his day, he
gives a brief history of the family. The first of them built this
castle in Stephen's time, and made it a veritable hell for the
inhabitants of the district. Perhaps you recollect a little of
the history of that time, Mr. Green, before the coming of the
Plantagenets. All England, one might say, was one great torture
chamber. The barons and feudal lords ravaged and killed and
tortured just as they chose, and castles like Locksborough sprang
up all over the country, each one of them a nest of
plunderers&mdash; law ceased to exist, and in the phrase of the
time, no man reaped what he had sown. It was, I think, the most
evil time this land has ever known, and among those devils in
human shape who made it so Guillaume de Boisgeant was not the
least. He was killed, just before Henry Plantagenet came to the
throne, by his own son&mdash; murdered in his bed."</p>

<p>"Quite an interesting family, evidently," Gees observed.</p>

<p>"Charming people," Madeleine Amber put in. "Wait,
though&mdash;daddy hasn't really begun, yet." She put her arm
round the vicar's neck and leaned against the back of his chair.
He looked up at her and smiled.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt, Madge&mdash;and stop tickling at once. Yes,
Mr. Green, they were an unusually foul nest of brigands, even for
those bad days. Mancius tells how Guillaume had his men-at-arms
roast one of his prisoners alive in the great hall of the castle
while the family were at dinner, apparently as an entertainment.
Other stories, too&mdash;the floors of the dungeons under the
castle must have been soaked with blood, many a time. And the son
who killed his father was, as you may guess, no better than that
father. King Henry restored the country to order gradually, but
this part of it was far from any centre of authority. York,
probably, would be the main seat of administration, but York was
far away, and Jean, the second de Boisgeant&mdash;he murdered his
wife, by the way, to please one of his lights o' love, while he
ruled here Jean did what he liked, to a very great extent. That
is, he kept the countryside in terror, just as his father had
done. He did not live long&mdash;one of his own men-at-arms
stabbed him, the dispute, according to Mancius, being over the
men-at-arms' daughter. What had happened to her, and what
happened to her father after the stabbing, I leave you to
imagine, and even if Madge were not here I should not
particularize."</p>

<p>"Don't mind me, daddy," the girl said. "We moderns, you
know."</p>

<p>"That's because I tell her the young people of today seem to
have lost all their reticence," Amber explained. "Now the third
de Boisgeant, Hugh, was credited with the study of the black arts
in addition to his other villainies&mdash;he experimented on
children much after the way of the original Bluebeard, Gilles de
Laval, who flourished long later in France. Gilles, after he had
slaughtered about two hundred children, paid the penalty for his
crimes, but that was in a rather more civilized age. Hugh de
Boisgeant was carrying on his practices at the time when Richard
of the Plantagenets was in Palestine, and when Richard was
imprisoned, all England was scoured to pay his ransom. De
Boisgeant went to York and handed over some part of the plunder
he and his forbears had collected here, paid in a great sum
toward the ransom, and so won immunity for himself. He returned
here, and one eleventh of October went out to the long barrow to
do battle with the spectre viking, Thorfinn Thorfinnison. He came
back unwounded, but after that night he gradually wasted
away&mdash; and not so very gradually, either. By All Soul's Day
he was dead, a fleshless skeleton, almost. This is as Mancius
tells the tale in his script."</p>

<p>"Actually," Madeleine added, "he caught cold and developed
tuberculosis. Daddy's been looking for the spectre, and there
isn't one."</p>

<p>"Or pernicious anemia," Gees suggested, smiling at her. "All
the same, I'd hate to go looking for that specter myself. And the
next of the family, sir&mdash;or was this Hugh the last of
them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! He left two sons. Geoffrey, the younger of the two,
went to his brother's room one night and stabbed him in his
sleep, and then took his brother's wife&mdash;she had been
Eleanor de Morville, a relative of that de Morville who helped to
assassinate Thomas A. Beckett, but I do not know the degree of
relationship. King John came to the throne, and in the state in
which England was then, the crime went unpunished, as did most of
the crimes of these de Boisgeants. Now&mdash;this, as nearly as I
can quote it from memory, is the story that Mancius tells. Two
years after murdering his brother, Geoffrey went hunting at a
distance, which may mean anything, but since Mancius speaks of a
great forest I take it to mean Inglewood Forest, which was of far
greater extent then than now. In this great forest he met a fair
damsel of middle earth&mdash; that is, one of the Shee&mdash;and
constrained her and took her to his castle. But she would not
yield herself to him except as his wife, so they were married
according to the customs of her people&mdash;of her people, mind,
not normally with bell and candle&mdash; and a week later Eleanor
was buried, leaving no children. That is how Mancius tells it,
and if Geoffrey killed Eleanor or had her killed, she probably
got no more than she deserved, for almost certainly she had been
a party to the murder of her husband, the elder of the two
brothers."</p>

<p><i>"Anno tertii, Johannes regnant,"</i> Madeleine
observed.</p>

<p>"My dear, your Latin lacks finish," the vicar remarked. "But
it was in the third year of John's reign that the damsel of
middle earth comes into the story, as you say. She bore Geoffrey
two children, a boy and a girl. Geoffrey himself set to work to
restore the family fortunes, get back some equivalent of what his
father had paid toward King Richard's ransom. That is to say, he
tortured and murdered after the custom of the family for miles
round, and stained Locksborough with blood as heavily and evilly
as ever it had been stained in the days of the old dead&mdash;the
first people of all on the site. The children grew up, and their
mother retained her youth&mdash;I told you that they are out of
time, her people, and do not age as do human beings. Geoffrey
died, apparently a natural death, which was strange for that
family, and the woman of middle earth took her daughter and
disappeared&mdash; both of them disappeared, leaving the son,
Colum, to inherit and rule here. Observe the name, Colum. Erse,
and by that you may form your own conclusion as to the origin of
the damsel of middle earth who became his mother."</p>

<p>"She belonged to the lordly ones in the hollow hills,"
Madeleine said. "Daddy took mother and me to see <i>The Immortal
Hour</i> when we were in London, and I'm sure she was one of the
Irish fairy folk."</p>

<p>"Or from our own country," the vicar went on. "Mind, Mr.
Green, I am telling you this story as I read it in Mancius and
other sources, and you may take it as a fairy tale, if you like.
To return to the de Boisgeants, though. Colum took his father's
place, and was no better than that father&mdash;there was no
exception among them, but they were all evil and did evil. You
must think of Locksborough of that day as a little town,
inhabited by fierce men who gathered there because they were
driven out from among their kind&mdash;criminals, all of
them&mdash;and stole wives where they would. A place of fear, for
the normal inhabitants of the district, peopled by a band that
lived by plunder, and ruled, then, by Colum de Boisgeant, who was
the lord of the castle when John died and the third Henry came to
the throne. Colum had married, but into what family is not told.
He had three sons, the eldest of whom was killed in some raid.
The other two quarrelled and fought in their father's lifetime,
and Hugh, youngest of the family, killed his brother and was
forced to flee from his father's vengeance for the deed.
Fratricide, you may observe, was a hobby in the family. Colum is
supposed to have been poisoned by his wife&mdash;whether the
accusation were just or no, she was burned to death in the castle
yard, and a nephew&mdash;it is quite impossible to ascertain how
there was a nephew, or where he came from&mdash; appeared and
claimed the estate. But Hugh, the son, came back with a young
wife of surpassing beauty who, he said, was his cousin&mdash;and
that, you must realize, put them within the prohibited degree
according to church law of that time, but there was still no law,
either ecclesiastical or civil, to touch Locksborough. Hugh had
the nephew toasted over a slow fire, and took possession. The
wife of surpassing beauty appears to have followed in the
footsteps of the original Hugh, for children disappeared from the
district and she was credited with having made away with them and
with practicing unholy rites. Also, according to Mancius, she was
a daughter of middle earth. If that were so, it would make her
son&mdash;for she had a son&mdash;three-quarter of the race of
the Shee, and only one quarter human. Now&mdash;and mark this and
make what you like of it&mdash;she named the son Diarmid."</p>

<p>"I don't see&mdash;" Gees said, and did not end it.</p>

<p>"No? Well, leave it for the present. Diarmid de Boisgeant was
still a young man when he brought home a wife, another being of
great beauty according to Mancius, and they had a little
daughter&mdash;Hugh was a grandfather while he was still a
middle-aged man. Patience, Mr. Green. He was the last of them, so
far as occupation there is concerned."</p>

<p>"But the son, Diarmid," Gees pointed out, "and the wife and
daughter. You mean&mdash;they didn't inherit after Hugh?"</p>

<p>"We can leave them for a minute or two," the vicar said,
looking at his watch. "Madge, dear, will you go and ask your
mother to ring through to Dowlandsbar and tell Mr. Tyrrell that
Mr. Green is lunching with us? We ought to have thought of it
sooner, really."</p>

<p>She rose from her perch on the arm of the chair and went out.
Gees noted that her color heightened at the request.</p>

<p>"The last of them," her father said when the door had closed.
"Yes, Hugh de Boisgeant. Mr. Green, has Mr. Tyrrell told you of a
farm&mdash;Bandon is the name of the man occupying it&mdash;which
adjoins his land?"</p>

<p>"He did mention it&mdash;yes," Gees assented.</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, somewhere on that farm, in the time of the de
Boisgeants, was a small priory built round a holy well. You
know&mdash;there had been miraculous cures, and the monkish
settlement grew up on the spot because of pilgrims resorting to
it&mdash;the well had been discovered, or rather its properties
had, by Saint Brenda, and it had been famous before the de
Boisgeants built this castle. It is impossible to locate it
today, or to find any trace of the priory, either. It was rich
with gifts, jewels and gold&mdash; all the treasures that the
grateful of those days bestowed on it for their cures. One
winter's night Hugh de Boisgeant and his men attacked the place.
They slaughtered every monk but one, who escaped and somehow got
to York. They burned the priory and every building attached to it
to the ground, and came back to Locksborough with the
treasure&mdash;Hugh feared neither God nor man, though he may
have had some respect for his master the devil. He wanted that
treasure, and he took it in his own way."</p>

<p>"I begin to see&mdash;but go on," Gees said.</p>

<p>Engrossed in his story, the vicar took no heed of the
comment.</p>

<p>"Hugh should not have let that monk escape," he said. "The
time was still lawless&mdash;Edward Longshanks had not yet come
to restore order to England&mdash;but this terrible sacrilege was
too much for what government there was. A de Vere&mdash;one of
the family which held the earldom of Oxford and lost the battle
of Barnet for Earl Warwick&mdash;a de Vere was sent here to call
de Boisgeant to account for this and other crimes. He besieged
the castle for two months before it fell. He hanged de Boisgeant
and every other man who came out from the surrender, broke up the
stronghold entirely, but for some reason or other did not damage
the keep, which stands as it did when de Boisgeant swung from the
top. One man, Diarmid, is known to have escaped vengeance. Hugh
de Boisgeant's wife was killed in the sack of the place, and
Diarmid's wife too, but Diarmid and his daughter were never
found. What became of them is not known&mdash;Mancius' record
ends with the siege and sack of the castle."</p>

<p>"And the treasure&mdash;all that they took from the priory?"
Gees asked.</p>

<p>The vicar shook his head. "That was never traced, either," he
said. "Legend has it that Hugh&mdash;the Hugh who destroyed the
priory to win it&mdash;sits over it in full armor somewhere
within the bounds of the outer wall, and any who search for it
will wither away as his ancestor did after giving battle to the
specter of Thorfinn Thorfinnsson. There have been searches for
it, but the owner of the place who sold it to McCoul discouraged
anything of the sort, and the treasure ranks in the district as
fairy gold, better left alone."</p>

<p>"Yes, better left alone," Gees echoed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I have told you the story of the de Boisgeants at what you
may consider unpardonable length," the vicar remarked, "but there
was a purpose in it&mdash;to show you that the family followed
evil&mdash;was altogether bad. Now look back to the beginning of
it. Apart from the Roman occupation&mdash;there is no record of
that, and there have been no excavations&mdash;apart from it,
every race that has occupied Locksborough has added evil to
it&mdash;from the fall of the de Boisgeants, it has been shunned
and regarded as no place for human habitation&mdash;until McCoul
bought it and restored just so much of the keep as would make a
habitation for him and his daughter. Its reputation, apparently,
does not weigh with him. I know he got it for next to
nothing&mdash;the previous owner was glad to sell at any price,
and I understand McCoul drove a hard bargain over it. Also, he
spent as little as possible to make it habitable."</p>

<p>"And Diarmid de Boisgeant and his daughter were untraced,"
Gees observed, after a long pause in which the vicar sat,
apparently doubtful as to his guest's opinion of the story he had
told&mdash;and of himself for telling such a blend of fact and
immaterial, fantastic fancy.</p>

<p>"Diarmid and Lynette de Boisgeant were never traced," Amber
said.</p>

<p>"Lynette, eh? That takes us into a different breed of
legend&mdash;the Arthurian, surely," Gees half-questioned.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. If you accept the legendary part, probably
the women of middle earth who came into this family were
conversant with things far outside the Cumberland fells&mdash;the
name may have originated in a memory of a previous experience,
contact with different people."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad I came to you, sir," Gees remarked
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"If I have helped&mdash;" the vicar began, but got no further.
Again the door burst open, and Madeleine Amber stormed into the
room.</p>

<p>"Daddy, it's mutton. Forgive me, Mr. Green, but mother always
has fits about mutton getting cold quickly, and&mdash;lunch is
ready."</p>

<p>"Tell her to keep the cover on the dish for another two
minutes while we have a small wash," the vicar bade. "I'll take
you along, Mr. Green. Did you ring Dowlandsbar, Madge?"</p>

<p>"Mother did," she answered. "I'll go and tell her you're
coming to lunch in time for dinner&mdash;he's never in time for
meals, Mr. Green."</p>

<p>"A distinct slander," Amber said. "Run along, child."</p>

<p>"So," Green remarked as he followed his host, "if one accepts
this as you have just told it, Diarmid de Boisgeant was only one-
quarter human, and, assuming that his wife belonged to middle
earth, his daughter who escaped with him was only one-eighth
human?"</p>

<p>"It would seem so," Amber confirmed him, "but I have not told
you all this story as fact of today&mdash;you must make allowance
for the superstitions of the age in which Mancius wrote&mdash;the
beginning of Edward the First's reign. Also, his script is on
parchment sheets in blackletter Latin, very carefully written,
but the Latin is rather like my daughter's. And one sentence of
the script is utterly obscure, as far as relation to the rest
goes. After explaining how the fall of the castle was brought
about by de Vere and his men, Mancius tells how Hugh de Boisgeant
was hanged and search for Diarmid and his daughter proved
fruitless. Then he says&mdash;'Neither were the "loupi" seen by
the beseigers.' There is no other reference anywhere in the
script to these 'loupi,' by which I take it he means wolves."</p>

<p>"No other reference, eh?" Gees asked thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"None. I take it that they form a part of the story that he
meant to tell, or thought he had told earlier. Kept as pets,
possibly. Wolves were exterminated in this country in Edward's
reign, remember."</p>

<p>"And they're the sort of pets people like the de Boisgeants
would keep," Gees reflected. A not altogether irrelevant thought
of the four eyes he had seen like points of fire in the copse at
Dowlandsbar drifted into his mind as he dried his hands and
followed his host to the dining room, where the rest of the
family waited for the vicar.</p>

<p>"My son Harold, Mr. Green," Mrs. Amber introduced. "Walter, do
please begin carving at once. Tepid mutton&mdash;will you sit
here, Mr. Green?&mdash;tepid mutton is worse than warm ice-
pudding, don't you think?"</p>

<p>The vicar said a brief grace, and Jenny removed the covers.
Gees seated himself opposite Madge, and saw the boy staring at
him in a puzzled way as he too took his seat.</p>

<p>"Worse," Gees said solemnly, "than white pigs in
Birksheer."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" Harold murmured, and turned crimson. "The man from
Sussex!"</p>

<p>"Worse," Gees added, "than a geography lesson." Observing the
boy's slack mouth and morning-after appearance, he had no mind to
spare him.</p>

<p>"You have met Harold before, Mr. Green?" Mrs. Amber asked.</p>

<p>"Once," he answered, "but I didn't think he would recognize
me. We were both in character parts on a fairly full stage when
we met."</p>

<p>"He's never told us about joining any dramatic society at
Oxford," Madge remarked. "But did daddy branch off into
geography, Mr. Green?"</p>

<p>"Only slightly," he answered. "Over a priory on Bandon's farm
that is vanished altogether, today. And he merely mentioned
it."</p>

<p>"And the one monk who escaped to York," she observed. "I know.
If mother hadn't lectured him severely, he'd still be looking for
that priory instead of visiting his parishioners."</p>

<p>"But Bandon is one of my parishioners, my dear," the vicar
protested mildly, "and your gift of exaggeration amounts to
misrepresentation."</p>

<p>"I should never have thought that farm would be in your
parish," Gees remarked. "Then, of course, you count in
Dowlandsbar too?"</p>

<p>"That is so," the vicar answered. "Mine is a widespread
charge. Before the black death, there was a populous village
between Dowlandsbar and Bandon's place, but it disappeared
utterly in Richard the Second's time. The plague unpeopled these
fells by two-thirds."</p>

<p>"Has daddy told you about the dungeons at Locksborough, Mr.
Green?" Madge asked, after a silence devoted to the destruction
of roast mutton.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he answered. "I hope he will, though."</p>

<p>"I wish he could&mdash;all of it," she said, "but Ben Latimer
prevents him from finding out. Not poor old Ben himself, of
course, but what happened to him in connection with these
McCouls."</p>

<p>Gees noted the shade of contempt in her voice as she mentioned
the McCouls. "And what did happen&mdash;if I may ask?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>The vicar took up the story. "Ben," he explained, "is by way
of being a builder. An old man, now&mdash;employs labor when he
needs it, which is not often, and is a very good stone mason
himself."</p>

<p>"Also, he owns a tater clamp, and threatens to leather people
if they appear likely to go near it," Gees observed.</p>

<p>"And this is your second day here!" the vicar remarked, gazing
hard at him. "How much more do you know about him, may I
ask?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Gees answered. "I happened to meet him&mdash;in
character."</p>

<p>Again Harold's face turned brick red, and he scowled.</p>

<p>"I see," the vicar said&mdash;but he did not see, obviously.
"Ben is a good, sound workman, and when McCoul bought the castle
and grounds, he got Ben to put two floors in the keep and roof
them in&mdash;it was a mere shell, with all the floors either
destroyed by de Vere and his men at the time of their siege of
the place, or else&mdash;and more probably&mdash;taken as
building material later. Practically all the cottages in Odder,
and this house too, are built of stone from Locksborough. In
addition to putting in the two floors, Ben cleared the ground
floor and made it habitable. One slab of stone stood up above the
rest in the flooring, and in order to level it with the rest Ben
took it up, and discovered a stairway leading to
vaults&mdash;dungeons and a torture chamber, I judge by what Ben
described to me of their fittings. By McCoul's order he replaced
the stone and cemented it in&mdash;but, he told me, before he
finished his work there McCoul had removed all the cement, and
the stone slab was loose from the rest of the flooring."</p>

<p>"The wine-cellar is under the dining-room," Gees observed.</p>

<p>"It may be," the vicar assented seriously. "In any case,
McCoul evidently intended to maintain access to the dungeons,
which had gone undiscovered until he arrived and Ben cleared that
floor&mdash;it was feet deep in rubble and debris of all sorts.
But when Ben had finished his work&mdash;he employed as many as
twelve men on it, at one part of the reconstruction&mdash;when he
had finished, he naturally sent in his account, having paid off
his men and incurred a good deal of expense for materials. That
account was not paid. Ben's wife fell ill, and my wife was the
angel she always is in these cases&mdash;to your face, my
dear&mdash;and she found Ben literally starving himself to
provide invalid necessities for his wife. For one in his
position, the repairs to the castle had been a very big contract,
and he had put all his savings into it rather than go to McCoul
for money in advance. When he was in danger of being sold up I
went to McCoul, and it was then that I experienced the worst
rudeness I have ever endured from any man. A week after I had
buried old Mrs. Latimer&mdash;the second week in August, it would
be&mdash;I understood from Ben that the account had been paid in
full. Had it been paid sooner, I believe she might have
lived."</p>

<p>"It was a shameful thing, Mr. Green," Mrs. Amber said. "And
when Walter took Madge and me to London for our holiday&mdash;we
came back only three weeks ago&mdash;I saw Miss McCoul in a
theatre one night, wearing jewels that would have paid poor old
Ben's account ten times over."</p>

<p>"Umm'm! What sort of jewels, Mrs. Amber?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you, except that they struck me as very
fine."</p>

<p>"There was a moon of diamonds&mdash;you know, a crescent, set
in gold," Madge said. "She wore it as a dress ornament, up
towards the left shoulder&mdash;Oh, what diamonds! Antique, by
the look of it. And a ruby pendant&mdash;I'm sure it must have
been a ruby. I've never seen such a lovely stone. She came into
the cloak room while I was there, and looked at me as if I'd been
a performing frog. Oh, yes, she had a bracelet,
too&mdash;diamonds and one big emerald, in platinum. The other
two things looked antique, but the bracelet was quite modern, and
I should say almost priceless. I wouldn't dare wear such things
in a public place like a theatre, even if I had them."</p>

<p>"Which isn't likely," the vicar murmured gently.</p>

<p>"Quite modern, eh?" Gees queried. "The setting&mdash;yes. But
the cutting of the stones, especially the emerald. The
faceting?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that," Madge said dubiously.</p>

<p>"No, it's a silly sort of remark of mine. And you say that the
crescent and pendant looked antique?"</p>

<p>"I think so," she answered. "The setting was very heavy."</p>

<p>He smiled. "You're an observant sort of person,
evidently."</p>

<p>"Tater clamps, and leatherings," she fired back, and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Ah, but they were thrown at me," he said. "In the bar of the
<i>Royal George</i> last night, in fact. I went there with a view
to getting the sense of the meeting&mdash;the feel of Odder, I
might call it."</p>

<p>He saw the vicar gaze at his son with a sort of dawning
understanding of the character parts Gees and Harold had played,
and saw, too, that Harold gave him a resentful look. But he had
no pity for the boy.</p>

<p><i>"The George,"</i> the vicar said slowly, "takes the place
of a club for the men of the village. Querrett, the landlord, is
a very good man indeed, and Mrs. Querrett and my wife, I might
say, are joint trustees in every case of illness in the parish. A
very fine pair, the Querretts."</p>

<p>"So you were Mr. Cottrill's George, Mr. Green?" Madge accused
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I had to get there somehow," he admitted, "and if I'd gone as
myself I should have been frozen out of learning anything."</p>

<p>"I wish I could see more of Cottrill," the vicar observed.
"That man combines knowledge of the legends of this district with
a sound practicality acquired in his travels, and everybody likes
him."</p>

<p>"Ygdrasil," Gees murmured thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"The world ash! Did he talk to you of that?" Amber
demanded.</p>

<p>"We're going to talk about it," Gees said. "That is, I mean
him to talk about it. From what I can see, your folklore ranges
from Erse to the Germanic, and for a stranger there's almost too
much of it. But I have hopes of digesting all I've
swallowed&mdash;before lunch, that is." He gave Mrs. Amber an
anxious glance with the last sentence.</p>

<p>"I do hope our Cumberland cookery hasn't been too primitive
for you," she said anxiously.</p>

<p>"Bring it to London, tell me where I can find it, and tell
everyone that's my alternative address," he assured her.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she said. "We are primitive, you know."</p>

<p>"Then you conceal the fact remarkably well."</p>

<p>"Apology for what doesn't need it is mother's long suit,"
Madge told him. "Mr. Green, how much do you know about faceting
jewels?"</p>

<p>"Just a little," he answered. "One hears these things."</p>

<p>"And Ygdrasil, and white pigs in Berkshire&mdash;though you
pronounced it wrong&mdash;and the way you simply lapped up
daddy's tale of the de Boisgeants&mdash;Mr. Green, is there
anything you don't know?"</p>

<p>"Quite a good deal," he answered promptly. "For instance, and
to revert to Mancius for a moment, what are 'loupi,' in your
opinion?"</p>

<p>"Badly spelt for Latin, of course, but I think 'lupus' is
second declension," she answered. "And the
French&mdash;'loup.'"</p>

<p>"I might have thought of it myself," he said.</p>

<p>"In other words," she observed severely, "you knew it
already."</p>

<p>Later, when he had announced his intention of leaving, the
vicar came out to find his hat and coat for him.</p>

<p>"I do hope you'll come and see us again, Mr. Green," he
invited sincerely. "It is so rarely that I meet anyone interested
in my subject."</p>

<p>"My stay here will be short one, I hope," Gees responded, "but
I've enjoyed today so much that it won't be my fault if I don't
fit in another visit. You've been a real friend, Mr. Amber."</p>

<p>He started as a hand grasped his arm, and, looking round saw
Madge beside him, tweed-clad and wearing an impudent little
hat.</p>

<p>"Say I've been a friend too," she begged. "And say that you'll
endure my walking with you on your way back&mdash;Mr. Cottrill's
landlady has had a baby, from which you mustn't deduce any more
than you're meant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Madge! My dear!" the vicar interposed warningly.</p>

<p>"The younger generation is utterly devoid of reticence daddy,"
she said. "Mrs. Nevern has had a baby, Mr. Green, quite
recently&mdash;a fortnight ago, in fact&mdash;and I want to go
and see her, and it. The 'it' is to distinguish it from her,
because it's a girl too."</p>

<p>Gees glanced at the basket hanging from her hand. "Let me
carry that for you," he asked.</p>

<p>"How nice of you! Be careful&mdash;eggs. I must see that
baby."</p>

<p>He bade good-bye to Amber, and set out with the girl.</p>

<p>"Errand of mercy, eh?" he suggested, as they passed the
churchyard.</p>

<p>"Curiosity," she answered. "Did you ever meet any girl or
woman who wasn't curious over a baby? And I'm a parson's
daughter."</p>

<p>"I don't see the application," he said, after a moment's
thought.</p>

<p>"No?" she queried, and laughed. "Well, we're always worse than
the average, though my daddy is enough to make a saint of anyone.
All the same, I shall scream for help if you dare to regard me as
a saint."</p>

<p>"You're not," he said dryly.</p>

<p>"Give me that basket!" she ordered sharply.</p>

<p>"I won't," he retorted. "Ah, Ygdrasil again."</p>

<p>They passed under a mountain ash, its berries shining redly in
the afternoon sunlight. Madge looked up at it.</p>

<p>"No, carry the basket," she adjured. "You're one of us,
obviously. I don't know when I've liked a man so much&mdash;not
as a man, mind you, or anything sentimental and dam-foolish, but
as one of us."</p>

<p>"Us being whom?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Daddy's got sight," she explained, "and he liked you. So did
mother. Therefore, you must be one of us. <i>Quod
erat</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Faciendum,"</i> Gees concluded for her. "I feel made for
life."</p>

<p>"If you can, slosh Harold one for us," she asked. "I know he
saw you in the <i>George</i>, and was heavily boozed. You're
outside, of course, and all tied up with problems outside our
little family affairs. But if you get a chance, slosh him
heavily."</p>

<p>"I won't forget," he promised.</p>

<p>"You see, mother's sad about him," she explained, "and daddy
feels the lad is too old to be put over his knee and half-
murdered&mdash;which is what ought to happen to that ungrateful
brother of mine. Daddy could do so much more for his people here
if it were not for what he's spending on putting Harold on his
feet by sending him to his own college&mdash;Balliol&mdash;and it
seems such utter waste&mdash;am I saying too much, Mr.
Green?"</p>

<p>He looked down at her, met her gaze, as she trudged up hill
beside him, and saw a nervous anxiety lest she had overstepped
the bounds with a stranger.</p>

<p>"When you say too much, I'll tell you, Miss Amber," he
said.</p>

<p>"I knew you were one of us," she said contentedly. "Big enough
to shoulder other people's troubles, in spite of your own."</p>

<p>"But I have none of my own," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"Then your father was not an impecunious parson," she
declared. "Though, mind you, I wouldn't change my daddy for Jawn
D. Rockefeller, and I wouldn't do anything to grieve him for ten
Jawn D. Rockefellers and all they own. Mind those eggs!"</p>

<p>"The eggs," he stated gravely, "shall be guarded as&mdash;as
I'd guard you, if one of the de Boisgeants' 'loupi'
appeared."</p>

<p>"They don't appear in daylight," she said solemnly.</p>

<p>They topped the ridge, and came within sight of the two
monoliths guarding the entrance to Locksborough Castle.</p>

<p>"No, they don't appear in daylight," the girl repeated.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; AT DOWLANDSBAR</h2>

<p class="first">"YES, Mrs. Amber, that will be quite all right.
I shall understand he is lunching with you, and expect him when
he gets here."</p>

<p>Tyrrell put the receiver back on its rest, closed the cabinet,
and turned to face Annie, sister of the maid-of-all work at the
vicarage.</p>

<p>"Miss McCoul, sir," she said. "Say's she'd like to see you,
sir."</p>

<p>Gyda McCoul stood in the open doorway, to his sight a picture
of perfection as he turned from the telephone cabinet.</p>

<p>"Unquestionably, the gods are good," he said, as he hurried
toward her with both hands outstretched, and a smile that
emphasised the words in his eyes more than on his lips.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you think so," she answered, and gave him her two
hands to hold momentarily. "My father is busy, and I came to ask
how you are after your terrible experience last night. I do
hope&mdash;but you are quite yourself, I see. It wasn't so very
terrible, then?"</p>

<p>"It was terrible enough," he answered sombrely. "But&mdash;how
do you know what happened last night? Who has been telling
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know what gossip is," she said evasively. "Your man
Cottrill, and&mdash;but I am glad to see you, Mr. Tyrrell! As
soon as I heard, I made up my mind to come and see you,
because&mdash;well, just because!"</p>

<p>"Because?" he echoed, and reached for her hands
again&mdash;but they evaded his, and she smiled as she stepped
back from him.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;well, a neighbor," she said, with surface
lightness.</p>

<p>"No more?" he asked, and, advancing, forced her to a
standstill. "Gyda, you know! I've loved you from the first time I
saw you, and you've never given me a chance to tell you all that
you mean to me. My dear&mdash;Gyda&mdash;if only you could care
for me." His arms went round her&mdash;they had the hall to
themselves, for Annie had gone about her work, and the girl,
knowing herself alone with him, yielded to his clasp and looked
up into his eyes, steadily, unwaveringly.</p>

<p>"But I do," she said, very softly. Her shining white head lay
against his shoulder, and the soft velvet of her lips was his. He
lifted her arm to place it round his neck, and, little given as
he was to any softer emotion, the tender clasp that he won made
him fear lest she should divine too soon the strength of his
passion for her. With her strange eyes half-closed, she rested in
his clasp, to him a fragile being, infinitely dear.</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;Gyda&mdash;from the first sight of you&mdash;no
other thought," he said, half-incoherently. "And
now&mdash;incredible! That you care."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do!" she whispered back. "I know&mdash;"</p>

<p>But then she released herself from his hold and stood back:
Annie, the maid, entered from the back of the hall, and Tyrrell
turned to face her, knowing that Gyda's new relationship with him
would be news in Odder before many hours had passed. He did not
care: in the happiness of his new certainty he cared for nothing
but the girl beside him.</p>

<p>"Could you tell me, sir&mdash;beg pardon, sir," Annie asked,
"but is the lady staying for lunch here?"</p>

<p>"Miss McCoul is staying for lunch," Tyrrell said, "but you
need only lay for two&mdash;Mr. Green will not be in for lunch.
And&mdash;Annie&mdash;Miss McCoul and I are going to be married.
You may as well know."</p>

<p>Annie looked from one to the other of them, at a loss for
words, for a moment or so. Then she folded her hands before her,
primly.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. I'm sure I hope you'll be happy, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Annie. Lay lunch for two, please."</p>

<p>He made the response quite formal. There had been a lack of
enthusiasm in the girl's reception of his announcement that
angered him, momentarily. But then, he reflected, her sister was
in service at the vicarage, and all Odder had looked for a match
between him and Madge Amber until these McCouls had come to live
here. Added to that, Gyda's unusual appearance, her snow-white
hair and green-flecked, amber eyes, went against her with the
simple country folk, while her father's treatment of Ben Latimer
and his antagonism to the vicar rendered both McCoul and herself
objects of dislike. It was nothing, Tyrrell told himself: as his
wife she would soon live down their present opinion.</p>

<p>Gyda smiled at him and shook her head as Annie vanished.</p>

<p>"I didn't say I could stay to lunch with you," she said.</p>

<p>"Darling, I simply won't let you go," he answered "Your
father&mdash; are you thinking he may wonder what has become of
you?"</p>

<p>"I told him I was coming here. But&mdash;this Mr. Green?"</p>

<p>"Gone to the vicarage&mdash;lunching there, they tell me,"
Tyrrell said. "Why&mdash;what about him, dearest?" Again he
passed his arm round her and held her. "You don't dislike him, do
you?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing of him," she answered, with a shade of
constraint.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;but don't let's talk about him or anything else,
today, except you. And I've won you-I can't believe it, yet!
Gyda&mdash;I love your name! And you, wonderful one&mdash;I love
you! May I tell you?"</p>

<p>"There are many ways of telling." She hid her face against his
shoulder to answer whisperingly. "I&mdash;dear, I want them
all."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">In mid-afternoon, Gees handed Madge Amber her basket back,
outside the gateway of Dowlandsbar.</p>

<p>"Do come and see us again, Mr. Green," she asked.</p>

<p>"I think I can promise that&mdash;yes, I will," he answered.
"And if you or any of your people are in London at any time. I
hope you'll give me a chance to show how I appreciate the
kindness I've experienced at your home today. It was a real
experience for me, Miss Amber."</p>

<p>"But daddy liked you, you see," she said, "and he's got
sight&mdash;I don't mean the sight of the physical eye. Now I
must go and see Mrs. Nevern and her baby&mdash;good-bye for the
present, Mr. Green."</p>

<p>For a minute or two he watched her on her way. Tyrrell felt
uncomfortable over the way he had treated her, evidently, but if
she felt his defection as a loss, she gave no sign of it. But
then, Gees decided, she had far too much good sense to wear her
heart on her sleeve, or pine for a thing that was beyond her
reach. Healthy-minded, a little too outspoken, perhaps, but very
attractive, lovable.</p>

<p>He put her out of his mind, for there was so much else of
moment needing thought, arising out of his visit to the vicarage.
Amber's story, the plunder of the old-time priory&mdash;and
Gyda's jewels! Had McCoul unearthed what Hugh de Boisgeant had
buried, centuries before? If the wealth of the priory had been
hidden at Locksborough, surely someone must have found it, long
ago? And yet it may have been hidden so securely that one who
sought it must know where to search.</p>

<p>Amber believed, but would not say, that there was some
connection between the hounds that formed Gees' errand here and
the old castle&mdash;some connection between them and the
McCouls, perhaps. But Gees felt now that he knew why such a man
as McCoul had bought the place, installed himself and his
daughter in it. He had been a poor man when he came
there&mdash;his failure to pay Latimer for so long proved
it&mdash;and, suddenly, had been able to pay and produce fine
jewels&mdash;antique jewels, too!&mdash;for his daughter's wear.
By keeping his discovery of the priory treasures secret, he
evaded the laws regarding treasure-trove, and probably during his
and his daughter's visit to London of which Madge had
spoken&mdash;other visits too, in all likelihood&mdash;he had
disposed of some part of the gems and gold that had once decked a
shrine. Thirteenth and fourteenth century golden ornaments would
be immensely valuable for their workmanship, and there were
markets for such things in which no questions as to their origin
would be asked, as Gees knew.</p>

<p>But there was no proof&mdash;there was no proof of anything,
nor even suspicion enough on which to act in any way. The vicar
and Gees himself might be certain that McCoul had discovered what
Hugh de Boisgeant had hidden, and might believe that it was
McCoul who loosed the vile hounds to their killings, but open
accusation of anything of the sort would be akin to lunacy on
their part. It was difficult&mdash;damned difficult, Gees told
himself. And yet there must be a way.</p>

<p>He came to the doorway of Dowlandsbar and found Tyrrell
standing out on the step, gazing across at all that showed of
Locksborough above the intervening ridge. There was a softened
look in Tyrrell's eyes, and he appeared free of the nervous
irritability that the strain of the past six months had induced
in him. He smiled at Gees.</p>

<p>"News for you," he said. "I didn't lunch alone, after
all."</p>

<p>"No-o," Gees, said softly. "But she's gone, evidently."</p>

<p>"How&mdash;why, do you know already?" Tyrrell asked in
surprise.</p>

<p>"I can see what you've got on the shoulder of your coat,
man."</p>

<p>Tyrrell looked down, and then reached up to detach one silver,
shining hair. He held it carefully between his fingers and
smiled.</p>

<p>"I hadn't noticed it," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you going to congratulate me? I know! Come in
and have a drink on it."</p>

<p>"Don't want a drink&mdash;till tea time," Gees answered, "but
I hope you'll be happy, all the same&mdash;when this sheep
trouble is settled."</p>

<p>"I can forget even that, today," Tyrrell said confidently.
But, for a moment, a frown clouded his expression. Gees had shown
no more enthusiasm over his news than had Annie&mdash;and, he
realized, had acknowledged it with just such words as she had
used.</p>

<p>"But look there!" Gees said suddenly, and pointed towards the
castle.</p>

<p>Swathes of whitish reek were veiling the machicolations of the
keep, and as Gees spoke they thickened, while over the ridge came
the advance guard of the fog. Locksborough appeared to sway in
the haze, and while they looked it vanished entirely. The
sunlight striking on Dowlandsbar was suddenly dimmed, and then
put out like a candle, while the air grew chill as the first
wreaths of vapor swirled round the doorway. And now the ridge
over which the fog had marched so suddenly was invisible behind a
white, icy wall, solid-seeming as they gazed.</p>

<p>"This is what I've been afraid of, but I didn't expect it so
soon," Tyrrell said. "I mean&mdash;I hoped those grey things
would have been destroyed before the winter fogs began. This is
rolling in off Solway, and heaven only knows how long it will
last. The sheep&mdash;Cottrill&mdash;" He broke off, and all the
nervousness that his joy of the day had driven out, for a little
while, returned. "I wonder if he&mdash;" he began again, and
again did not speak all the thought aloud.</p>

<p>"Where is Cottrill?" Gees asked, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>"Out&mdash;where would he be?" Tyrrell answered. "I went to
see him in Anker's Glen this morning, after you'd gone. He wanted
to keep the gun for the present, so I let him have it&mdash;he
won't come to any harm, though. But with this coming on so
suddenly, he won't be able to get the sheep back to the fold
tonight&mdash;they scatter in all directions during the day, and
to find them and get them together in this&mdash;well!"</p>

<p>"Yes, an impossible task," Gees assented thoughtfully.
"But&mdash; something else. Which is the Neverns'
cottage&mdash;where Cottrill lives?"</p>

<p>"About a quarter of a mile along the lane, on the other side
from here&mdash;it's in a hollow, and the gate from the lane is
painted blue. Why, though? Cottrill is out on the fells, now. You
can't&mdash; "</p>

<p>"Not Cottrill at all, for this," Gees interrupted. "Miss Amber
is there&mdash;at Nevern's place, and she can't go home alone in
this. I'll get my Webley." He went into the house, and Tyrrell
heard him taking the staircase two or more steps at a time as he
went up.</p>

<p>He came out with his big overcoat on, a minute later.</p>

<p>"Back for tea, I expect," he said without pausing. "I've had
one meal with them today. Save me a bun if I'm late. I'm
beginning to feel peckish again already&mdash;it's the air."</p>

<p>Hurrying on, he crossed the lane when he emerged from the
drive and, keeping over to the right hand side, soon came in
sight of a little blue gate. He opened it and found himself
descending a steep pathway, down which he went slowly and
cautiously, since the white fog that wrapped round him was now so
thick as to reduce visibility to a couple of yards or less. A
door showed, and he knocked and waited. The door was opened, and
a small girl looked up at him timidly.</p>

<p>"I want to see Miss Amber, dear," he said. "Is she here?"</p>

<p>"Miss Madge?" the child shrilled. "Here's a gempleman for
you!"</p>

<p>The girl appeared, her empty basket in her hand, and stared at
him wonderingly. Apparently she was ready to return home.</p>

<p>"I've come to escort you, Miss Amber," he said. "I'll wait, if
you're not ready&mdash;I'm not in any hurry, except to catch you
before you start. That is to say, the hurry is over since you
haven't gone."</p>

<p>"I was just going&mdash;how very kind of you, Mr. Green! But
you ought not to have troubled&mdash;I can't possibly lose my way
to the village."</p>

<p>"A worse thing than losing your way might have happened, if
you'd gone alone," he said. "It was not that I had in mind."</p>

<p>She glanced down at the small girl, who stood listening. Then
she stooped and kissed the child, and faced him again.</p>

<p>"All ready," she said. "Good-bye, Ethel&mdash;take care of
mother. The gentleman means I might fall into a ditch and get
muddy."</p>

<p>"It wasn't what you meant, I know," she said to Gees as they
emerged to the lane and the blue gate clattered against its post,
"but I wanted Ethel to feel cheerful about being in the cottage
with only her sick mother and the baby till Nevern gets back
tonight."</p>

<p>"I was a fool to say what I did in her hearing," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"I don't think she caught your meaning," she dissented. "And
even if she did, the cottage is shaded by a rowan. You might have
seen the red berries if you'd looked up and if the fog would let
you."</p>

<p>"Do you think its being there makes any difference?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"It's what they think that counts," she pointed out
sagely.</p>

<p>"Well, what is the special significance of the tree,
then?"</p>

<p>"The mountain ash&mdash;oh, Mr. Green! Surely you know quite
well how they regard it as a protection from all evil? Some kind
of survival of the old reverence for it as Ygdrasil, the world
ash-tree of power."</p>

<p>"And McCoul cut his down and poisoned the roots," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"So you know that too? Yes&mdash;eight beautiful rowans
between the moat and the keep doorway. And he had the roots
poisoned with arsenic. A big auger hole bored in the centre of
each of them after the trees had been cut down, and the powder
poured in, and then a piece of metal sheeting nailed over the
hole. Ben Latimer told me how it was done."</p>

<p>"What you might call a series of deciduous murders," he
commented.</p>

<p>"Deciduous&mdash;oh, yes. Of course&mdash;they're not
coniferous."</p>

<p>"And McCoul didn't want protection from evil&mdash;hold up,
Miss Amber. Take my arm, won't you?" For she had stumbled and
almost fallen over one of the potholes of the lane, and, by her
expression as she limped onward, had wrenched her ankle rather
severely.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, and leaned rather heavily on him for
support. "It's painful at first&mdash;my foot twisted. Not
seriously&mdash; I shall lose the feeling of it in a minute or
two, but just at first&mdash;and if anyone from the village sees
us like this, they'll think I'm a brazen hussy and walking out
with you already."</p>

<p>"Well, you're walking home with me instead," he replied. "And
now what about a cigarette&mdash;or isn't smoking one of your
virtues?"</p>

<p>"I'd love one," she assented. "I left my case at home, by
mistake, and was just wondering if I were brazen enough to ask
for one."</p>

<p>They stopped while he produced his case and lighted cigarettes
for her and himself. And, though he put the case away and offered
his arm again, he did not go on when she took it. She looked up
at him.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what&mdash;why do you look like that?" she
demanded. "What is it? Did you"&mdash;he felt her fingers tighten
on his arm&mdash;"did you hear anything?" She stared up into his
face, her own eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Quiet!" he bade, his right hand in his overcoat pocket.</p>

<p>They stood quite still. The shadow of a shape seemed to pass
in the reeking whiteness beyond the low stone wall. The dead
stalk of one of last summer's tall weeds crackled, and Gees' hand
came out from his pocket. There was a soft rustling, as of pads
on grass&mdash;and then it died out, leaving utter stillness in
which they stood for nearly a minute facing each other. Then
Madge's fingers slackened.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said. "That is, nothing now. There might have
been!"</p>

<p>"I'm very glad I saved you from going home alone," he said
gravely.</p>

<p>She held up her cigarette with over half an inch of ash on its
end. "I did keep still, when you told me," she said, and
smiled&mdash; but he could see that her lips were trembling, and,
as her hand trembled too, the ash fell. "I&mdash;I don't know how
to thank you, Mr. Green."</p>

<p>"It was a rabbit, or something, probably," he said
reassuringly. "You said yourself that those&mdash;the other
things&mdash;don't come out in daylight, so it couldn't have been
anything to fear."</p>

<p>"But this is not daylight," she dissented. "I&mdash;do believe
I want to be sensible, won't you? But I'm so glad you're with me,
now."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad I'm with you&mdash;and that's no compliment,
but the truth," he said lightly. "And you're eminently
sensible."</p>

<p>"I wish I were!" she exclaimed. "You are being good to me, Mr.
Green. If I had started from the cottage and been alone
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you're not," he interrupted. "I'm taking care of
that&mdash;and of you, till you're safe at home. And my friends
usually call me Gees."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a name! But do you mean me to call you that,
then?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly I do, Madge. We've known each other quite a
long time, now&mdash;let's keep moving. This fog is icy, and your
coat's thin."</p>

<p>They went on, down toward the stone bridge between Dowlandsbar
and Locksborough. Gees kept well to the left side of the lane,
for guidance by means of the low whitethorn hedge that formed a
boundary here. So they came to the bridge, and, halfway over it,
Madge dropped her basket and clung to Gees' arm with both hands,
pressing close to him. For something went past them with a rush
on the far side of the bridge, a softly-padding shape that
vanished in a moment&mdash;and again Gees scented a foul reek
that he recognized. The padding went up the hill behind them,
towards Dowlandsbar and the open fells, and died out.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed fearfully. "The other one!"</p>

<p>He saw terror in her eyes, and held up the Webley for her to
see.</p>

<p>"You're quite safe," he said reassuringly. "And it's gone, as
frightened of us as you are of it. A dog, most likely."</p>

<p>"No." She released her grip on him as she shook her head. "Not
a dog&mdash;you know it was not a dog. There is no dog as big as
that anywhere near here. It was the other one&mdash;they are out,
Mr. Green."</p>

<p>He put his hands on her shoulders, the pistol still grasped in
his right hand. "Now look here, my child," he said, "you've got
to pull yourself together. Even if they are out, they are not
after us. I'll land you safely at home, never fear. Will you
believe it?"</p>

<p>She gazed up at him. "Ye-yes," she said shakily. "Oh, what
must you think of me for being such a coward? But&mdash;they're
not of earth."</p>

<p>"Quite probably there's a perfectly rational explanation for
them," he said. "Things not of earth don't descend to killing
sheep&mdash;they don't do material damage either to animals or
human beings. Now come along and be sensible, before your father
begins to worry about you."</p>

<p>She achieved a smile and took his arm again. "Why, yes," she
said, as they went on uphill. "But I'm keeping close to you till
we get there. And then&mdash;what about you? You can't go back
alone?"</p>

<p>"I both can and shall," he answered decidedly. "I told Tyrrell
I should be back for tea, and asked him to keep some for me."</p>

<p>She made no reply, and Gees wondered whether mention of
Tyrrell had silenced her. They tramped on, and passed where two
ghostly things rose in the reek&mdash;the standing stones at the
entrance to Locksborough. And then, nearing Odder, they heard
voices, and two beings loomed up and stopped within sight of
them. Gees recognized Harold Amber and a brawny being in
velveteen coat and corduroys&mdash;Tom Cotton.</p>

<p>"We were coming to fetch you home, Madge," Harold said.
"Father got worried about you, and asked Tom to come along with
me."</p>

<p>Cotton peered hard at Gees, and smiled broadly. "Glad to meet
you agin, sir," he said. "You took us all in nicely, last
night."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it," Gees answered. "And now I needn't come any
farther, Miss Amber. Why, hullo! What's Jimmy doing here?" For a
dog appeared from beyond Cotton in the fog and sat down beside
him.</p>

<p>"That ain't Jimmy&mdash;it's his sister&mdash;belongs to me,"
Cotton explained in jerks. "Same litter, but she's got better
brains."</p>

<p>"You can't possibly go back to Dowlandsbar alone, Mr. Green,"
Madge said. "Tom, we saw the grey things&mdash;they passed us.
They are out."</p>

<p>Again Gees held up the Webley. "I've got a friend with me," he
said, "and the pair of us are a match for any other pair."</p>

<p>"Aye, maybe, mister," Cotton remarked, "but so be as you ain't
ashamed o' my company, I'll walk along with you, an' go an' see
my sister&mdash;Mrs. Nevern, that is. I ain't been near her since
the baby was born, an' now's my chance. If so be the fog don't
lift, I can turn in along o' Cottrill for the night. Miss
Amber'll be safe wi' her brother&mdash;it ain't more'n a quarter
of a mile to the vicarage from here."</p>

<p>"That seems a reasonable way of saving us from escorting each
other about all night," Gees observed. "I'll say good-bye here,
Miss Amber, and leave you to your brother's care for the rest of
your way."</p>

<p>He glanced at Harold, who, he noted, had refrained from
speaking a word to him. Madge Amber held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you want to get back," she said. "Oh, my basket!
I must have dropped it down by the bridge. Could you keep it for
me if you see it&mdash;till we see you again, Gees?" With the
last word, she smiled, and Gees smiled back as he released her
hand.</p>

<p>"I'll save it for you," he promised. "Now we'll go."</p>

<p>But, when she and Harold had vanished in the fog, he stood for
a minute or two listening, and Tom Cotton listened too.</p>

<p>"It's all right, mister," Tom said at last. "They're too near
home to come to any harm. That was a rare trick you played on us
last night!"</p>

<p>They started toward Dowlandsbar, and the dog walked quietly
beside its master. Cotton turned up his coat collar and buttoned
it, for the white reek that enveloped them was chilling.</p>

<p>"You didn't reckon we had anything to do wi' this sheep
killin', did you, mister?" he inquired after a silent half-mile
or so.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be such a fool," Gees answered, "but I didn't want
to freeze you all up by appearing as my natural self, so I got
Cottrill to give me the freedom of the house, to learn what I
could."</p>

<p>"About the killin's, that'll be," Cotton surmised. "Well, it
didn't do no good, did it? We'd nuthin' to tell useful,
like."</p>

<p>"I found it very useful," Gees dissented. "It gave me an idea
of what you are all like&mdash;put me in touch with the
place."</p>

<p>"Aye, it would," Cotton agreed gravely. "I never thought o'
that. Well, 's'long as I'm in the <i>George</i> if you happen in,
you'll be welcome. Any friend o' Miss Amber's good enough for
me&mdash;an' all of us, too."</p>

<p>"A general favorite, is she?" Gees encouraged him.</p>

<p>"All of 'em, except that silly young devil," Cotton told him.
"In fifty mile round, there ain't a man to touch our parson. If
anyone's in trouble&mdash;an' Mrs. Amber, too. Salt o' the earth,
them three."</p>

<p>"And what do you do?" Gees inquired after another period of
silence. "That is, if I'm entitled to ask you such a
question."</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I worked at Bandon's up to midsummer, but then he cut
down, times not bein' too good, an' me bein' a single man I had
to go. Got a few odd jobs since, enough to keep me an' Effie in
grub."</p>

<p>"Effie being your sister, I suppose," Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"Lord, no, sir! This is Effie. All right, old gal," he said as
the dog looked up at him, "we're just talkin' about you, that's
all. No, Mrs. Nevern's my sister, an' I ain't been near her for
some while, lest she should think I was cadgin' a meal, but I
just finished a fortnight on a stable-roofin' job wi' Ben
Latimer, so now I can go an' see her wi' a few mutton chops in my
poachin' pocket an' a drop o' somethin' good for me an'
Nevern&mdash; which I'd got all ready before the fog come over
an' Mr. Amber asked me to go an' meet Miss Madge. So there it is,
an' here I am. But Miss Madge said you'd seen they devil hounds.
Didn't try to go for you, did they?"</p>

<p>"On the other hand, we hardly saw them," Gees answered. "They
passed us in the fog, going toward Dowlandsbar, separately."</p>

<p>"That'd be&mdash;both of 'em was the other side o' this
place?" He jerked his thumb toward the shadowy monoliths of
Locksborough, abreast them as he spoke&mdash;and, Gees saw, he
crossed himself.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, they were both on the Dowlandsbar side," Gees
said.</p>

<p>"Aye, last night, when Ammon spotted 'em by the churchyard,
was the only time they've been seen or heard on the Odder side o'
the castle. Mister, I thought about that, an' you know what I
think?"</p>

<p>"That they were waiting to get me alone," Gees said
quietly.</p>

<p>"Aye, you've hit it, mister! Master Tyrrell let it get about
that you'd be comin' from London to track 'em down, an' they were
after you. They got a lot more sense'n any animals&mdash;look at
the way they don't go near the sheep as long as Cottrill's on
watch, an' the first night he's off, there's two more done in.
They ain't animals. They know!"</p>

<p>"It looks like it," Gees admitted. "But what are they,
then?"</p>

<p>"That man McCoul," Cotton answered indirectly. "S'posin' he's
what he looks to be? Locksborough's queer, haunted by no end o'
things. An' you'd say as soon as you look at him&mdash;he ain't
altogether natural. Black magic, I make it. S'posin' he's havin'
truck wi' the old dead, the bloody old dead buried there, an'
raises 'em. They lived an' died in blood, if all that's said is
true, an' if he raised 'em for his own ends they'd go out after
blood. Why he'd want to raise 'em I don't know, an' it's no use
askin' me, but I say these things are the old dead, raised to
life in the shape o' wolves by that man McCoul." He spat as he
ended, a gesture obviously directed against the man McCoul.</p>

<p>Gees stooped and picked up Madge's basket, for by this time
they had reached the stone bridge, and he had been looking for
it.</p>

<p>"Apparently you don't like McCoul," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Like him?" Cotton echoed, and at the sound of the words the
dog padding beside him growled. "All right, Effie," he said to
her. "You ain't no cause to concern yourself&mdash;yet. He come
to live here in March, an' them things first appeared in March.
He's in league wi' the devil, his father, an' he raises the hell
hounds for his own ends an' lets 'em out to hunt for blood, which
is the only reward he can give 'em an' the only one they want.
Else, why'd he poison the rowans, the only good things that ever
came out o' the earth at Locksborough, bar grass which'll grow
even on a suicide's grave&mdash;grow anywhere? An' his cat-eyed
witch daughter&mdash;in old time, they'd ha' burned her at the
stake, an' a damned good thing too! Ben Latimer's wife'd be alive
today if it wasn't for them McCouls. Do I like McCoul!"</p>

<p>"Apparently, as I said, you do not," Gees remarked again. "But
what proof have you of any of this? What evidence, even?"</p>

<p>"If I had a shadow of anything to back what I'm sayin', I'd
raise all Odder against 'em, get 'em stoned whenever they show
their faces," Cotton said savagely, and the dog growled again.
"Here, Effie, don't get fretted, old girl! You're like our
inspector, sir, if you'll forgive me for sayin' it. He goes
smellin' around for evidence, lookin' up every dog for miles
round, an' it's here&mdash;here all the time! An' if you've come
down from London to do the same, well&mdash;an' maybe I'll be
givin' offence by sayin' it, but I say it all the same&mdash;if
that's all you reckon to do, you'd better go back. It ain't no
good."</p>

<p>"No?" Gees asked gently. "What ought I to do, then?"</p>

<p>He halted outside the gateway of Dowlandsbar, and gazed at
Cotton as he asked it. Cotton shook his head, and grinned.</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, sir, I don't know," he said. "No. Well,
will you be all right between here and the Neverns' place, or
shall I walk as far as the gate with you?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"Lord love you, sir, you're a real good sort, but I'll be
quite all right. Come an' see us in the <i>George</i>
again&mdash;an' you needn't come from Sussex, next time. I'll
stand bail for you, if Cottrill ain't there."</p>

<p>They parted with a hearty handshake, and Gees went on&mdash;he
kept a careful eye on the copse beside the drive, but it was
innocent of any presence such as had tenanted it the preceding
night. When he came into the big hall of the house, Tyrrell
gestured silently at a tray on the table beside the fireplace.
Gees went to it and removed a cover.</p>

<p>"Man, you're a friend!" he said. "Four scones all hot and
buttered, and I'm ravenous, though I had a whale of a lunch. It
must be the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut it out!" Tyrrell interrupted, almost shouting.</p>

<p>"Fog, I was going to say," Gees completed. "Have you had
tea?"</p>

<p>"Aye," Tyrrell said. "I waited some time, and then gave you
up."</p>

<p>"Ah! That's the air," Gees told him, and grinned widely. He
put Madge's basket down, and poured himself cup of tea.</p>

<p>Tyrrell stood up and put down the book he had been reading.
"I'm a little troubled in my mind about Cottrill, Gees," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes?" Gees bit a scone, and, because he could speak no more,
looked the rest of the question.</p>

<p>"Yes. I know he's out on the fells with the sheep&mdash;was
when this fog came down&mdash;and I don't know if he'll be able
to get back."</p>

<p>"What can you do?" Gees asked, before taking a second
bite.</p>

<p>"Nothing, till the fog lifts, of course."</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was 'of course.' When will the fog
lift?"</p>

<p>"Oh, why ask such a blasted silly question?" Tyrrell
aimed.</p>

<p>Gees took two more bites, and there was no more of that one.
He took a drink of tea, and refilled the cup. Then he took
another scone.</p>

<p>"What time was it when Miss McCoul left?" he asked.</p>

<p>"About half an hour before you got back&mdash;why?" Tyrrell
answered.</p>

<p>"Is McCoul on the telephone?" Gees disregarded Tyrrell's
query.</p>

<p>"No. I wish they were, now&mdash;especially with this
fog."</p>

<p>"Aye," Gees said thoughtfully. "It's a pity."</p>

<p>"Here, what do you mean?" Tyrrell demanded sharply. Gees gazed
full at him for some seconds. "The grey shapes are out," he said
at last.</p>

<p>"The&mdash;Cottrill&mdash;out there!" Tyrrell almost gasped
the words. Then a blaze of anger came into his eyes. "Here, what
the hell do you mean, asking about McCoul and the telephone like
that? Do you dare suggest <i>he</i> has anything to do with the
grey shapes?"</p>

<p>"Quiet&mdash;quiet, man!" Gees bade. "Did I say anything of
the sort?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, no, you didn't," Tyrrell half-stammered. "But
you asked&mdash;about him&mdash;and about Gyda. It sounded as
if&mdash;" He did not end it, but stood looking at Gees in a
puzzled, half-resentful way.</p>

<p>"So the fog may last days?" Gees suggested thoughtfully,
taking no heed of Tyrrell's attitude.</p>

<p>"May last days, and may all be cleared off by tomorrow
morning&mdash; or even sooner," Tyrrell said more easily. "There
is no telling."</p>

<p>"In that case, nothing can be done till to-morrow morning, or
sooner," Gees said, and bit away nearly half of the scone between
his fingers. "That is, except to finish these, and take care of
that basket. I've promised to return it to Miss Amber."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;did she mention me?" Tyrrell asked awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Now would she?" Gees retorted, and laughed. "Besides, after
what you told me before I went to escort her, would it matter if
she did?"</p>

<p>Tyrrell shook his head, gravely, and less in negation than in
concern, and Gees finished the scone he held and took
another.</p>

<p>"I haven't had such an appetite for years," he said. "It must
be"&mdash;he made a long pause and gazed hard at Tyrrell&mdash;"a
renewal of my youth&mdash;Yah!"</p>

<p>And he bit into the third scone.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; MISSING</h2>

<p class="first">INSTEAD of the view of Locksborough Castle and
the valley between it and Dowlandsbar, Gees saw only a blank
whiteness when he looked out from his window next morning, and
the daylight was so far reduced by the fog that he had to turn on
the electric light for his shave. He went downstairs to find
Tyrrell standing before a log fire in the dining-room, anxiety in
every line of his face.</p>

<p>"Bad," Tyrrell said. "It's bad. Utterly unexpected&mdash;no
warning of it. No fall in temperature&mdash;nothing! Let's have
breakfast."</p>

<p>He rang, and Annie brought in their breakfast of kidneys and
bacon. Tyrrell removed the cover and looked at Gees.</p>

<p>"Are you still under the influence of the air about here?" he
asked. "I mean&mdash;how many kidneys, and much bacon do you
want?"</p>

<p>"It must be bad," Gees answered. "I'll have a lot,
please."</p>

<p>Tyrrell helped him liberally, and, after some hesitation, took
one rasher of bacon for himself and sat gazing at it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to sell the flock," he announced abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well, you can't till the fog lifts," Gees told him, "and if
you don't eat, you'll get so weak that you won't be able to sell
anything. And not all your fretting will push the fog away. Eat,
man!"</p>

<p>Tyrrell shook his head. "It's no use," he said. "I was awake
half the night, listening, thinking. The gods are against
me&mdash;a fog like this ought not to happen so early in the
year. And the grey things were out last night, you
said&mdash;that will be two more gone, at the least. Cottrill
could never fold them after the fog dropped down."</p>

<p>"He might," Gees said. "Anker's Glen is on the south side of
the lane, and you told me you only have two hundred acres on that
side&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he drove them across the lane in the morning," Tyrrell
interrupted. "There's not much more than twenty acres of good
grass in that two hundred, and since it's sheltered we save it as
late in the year as we can. When the fog dropped down, they were
scattered all over the fells, easy game for the grey things. And
I've not heard from Cottrill either, which means he didn't get
back last night."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's got a hut or two out on the sheep runs?" Gees
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! He knows how to take care of himself. He'd make a
fire for himself, and he keeps tinned stuff out there for use in
the lambing season, when he knows he'll have to be out all night.
But&mdash;" He broke off and looked at the piece of bacon,
untouched on his plate.</p>

<p>"Then it means two more sheep gone," Gees said. "I told
you&mdash;or rather, I believe I told him&mdash;two or four more.
In that, you must realize, I was reckoning without this fog. I
counted on having a plan of campaign arranged to make it no more
than four at the outside, but the fog upsets my calculations as
much as it upsets you, apparently. And now it may be six, or even
eight, if they stick to their habit of pairs and no more. But
eight is the limit&mdash;don't sell the flock."</p>

<p>"Look here, how much do you know?" Tyrrell demanded
acridly.</p>

<p>"So far as telling you anything I could prove is concerned,
nothing," Gees answered. "In my own mind, everything about it."
He applied himself industriously to kidneys and bacon, and passed
his cup for more coffee, disregarding Tyrrell's expression of
impatience.</p>

<p>"Damn it, man!" Tyrrell observed as he refilled the cup.
"Can't you be more explicit? If you know everything about
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And can't prove a single word of what I know," Gees
interrupted. "Tyrrell, we're up against something&mdash;as you've
realized, if only you bring yourself to admit it, that you can
boil down to one word&mdash;fear. Fear of the uncanny, fear of
the unnatural, and you've got to face the fact that it is
unnatural. Those things have chosen their times, acted as no dogs
would act if they were worrying sheep&mdash;you admit that?"</p>

<p>"I've got to admit it," Tyrrell said after a pause for
thought.</p>

<p>"As nearly as I can make out, they appeared twice in six
months, before I got here&mdash;two men saw them, and obviously
it was through carelessness on their part&mdash;I'm regarding
them as beings with more sense than mere animals. Since I arrived
here, you've seen them, Shaun Ammon has seen them, and I've seen
them&mdash;and Miss Amber was scared to the point of holding on
to me like death by glimpsing them. Apparently you rather
advertised the fact that I was coming here to end the trouble,
and they're out after me, as nearly as I can make it out to catch
me alone, though the way I loosed off with the Webley the night
before last rather discouraged them. But they don't like me,
and&mdash;I want you to take particular notice of
this&mdash;<i>they</i> like you!"</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean by that?" Tyrrell asked
amazedly.</p>

<p>"Why weren't you torn to pieces in Anker's Glen the night
before last?" Gees asked in reply. "There you were, ready to be
torn."</p>

<p>"I've wondered over that, myself," Tyrrell admitted, and
shuddered at the recollection. "That thing over me, stinking at
me, and the other one charging it and knocking it away before I
lost consciousness!"</p>

<p>"Queer&mdash;you've got to admit it. By the way, if you're not
eating the rest of those kidneys, I am. You can't warm 'em up,
and it's a pity to waste them. Might I?" He held out his
plate.</p>

<p>"By all means," Tyrrell assented, and scooped the remainder of
the contents of the dish on to the plate. "I'd sooner keep you
for a week than a fortnight, if you go on eating at this rate.
But I don't understand&mdash;what is the queerness? You're so
damned mysterious about it."</p>

<p>"Because I've no proof. I've nothing that would justify me in
saying one word&mdash;about anything. Yet, in my own mind, I
know."</p>

<p>"What?" Tyrrell asked.</p>

<p>"Something so fantastic," Gees said soberly, "that you'd
probably turf me straight out if I put it into words. Miss Amber
said it yesterday, though I wouldn't agree for fear of
frightening her too much&mdash;these things are not of earth. And
yet they are, in a sense, material enough to do material damage.
Neither brutes nor human, though."</p>

<p>"They must be one or other, surely," Tyrrell said, after a
long pause in which he watched kidneys and bacon disappear with
incredible swiftness. "Or halfway between brute and
human&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neither," Gees interposed. "There is another state, and if I
said that within hearing of a bus-load of London office workers,
they'd jeer themselves black in the face. And now the
marmalade"&mdash;he reached for it&mdash;"as a groundwork for the
final drink of coffee and the post-prandial cigarette. Good word,
post-prandial&mdash;good, sound, Victorian epithet. What do we do
with ourselves this morning?"</p>

<p>"What the hell can you do?" Tyrrell demanded savagely, and
gestured at the window, beyond which showed a blank
whiteness.</p>

<p>Gees made no reply, but finished his toast and marmalade. Then
he produced his cigarette case and offered it. Tyrrell took
one.</p>

<p>"I know," Gees said, as he lighted his own cigarette. "We'll
go out to the front door and look at the weather. It may thin
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" Tyrrell interrupted disgustedly. "Can't you see
I'm all on edge? Unable to do anything, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly," Gees interrupted in turn. "Unable, even, to get rid
of me, unless you turn me out into this wet blanket. I've told
you I know what's wrong, and I've told you I'll put it right, if
you give me time. And I know, too"&mdash;he spoke very
seriously&mdash;"you've got a fear, now, behind and distinct from
your original fear. Justifiably, too."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, man?" Tyrrell demanded with sharp
anxiety.</p>

<p>Gees shook his head, silently&mdash;and the door of the room
opened to admit Annie, at whom Tyrrell stared with a sort of
angry questioning over the interruption as she approached
him.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," she said, "it's Mr. Cotton wants to see
you. About Mr. Cottrill, he said, and could he see you now?"</p>

<p>"One minute, Annie&mdash;tell him in one minute." Tyrrell
waited until she had gone out. "Now, Gees," he demanded, "what
did you mean by that remark&mdash;a fear behind my original fear?
Out with it, man!"</p>

<p>"After I've laid your ghosts&mdash;not before," Gees answered
with a sort of inflexible determination in his tone. "You'd
better see this man Cotton, and if you don't mind, I'll come too.
About Cottrill, he said&mdash;it may be something more important
than I could tell you."</p>

<p>Tyrrell stood up. "All right," he said coldly. "We will see
this man Cotton. But if you mean what I think you mean&mdash;" He
broke off, and stood for a half-minute or so gazing intently at
Gees.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you nothing that I can't prove," Gees said. "So
far, I can prove nothing. Ergo, I'll tell you nothing. And
Cotton's waiting."</p>

<p>They went out, then, to the front doorway, where Tom Cotton
stood waiting, silhouetted against the white curtain of the fog,
with his dog Effie patient and still beside him. He touched his
hat to Tyrrell.</p>

<p>"It's about Cottrill, sir," he said, without waiting for
Tyrrell to speak. "I kipped in at my sister's place last night,
an' he didn't turn up all night. Ain't turned up yet, either. I
reckoned, considerin' what's been happenin' lately, I'd come
along an' tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes," Tyrrell said, "and what do you think I'm going to do
about it, Cotton?"</p>

<p>"I don't see as how anyone can do anything, till this fog
lifts, sir," Cotton said dubiously. "Weelum told me the fold is
in Anker's Glen, now, so I s'pose I might get that far wi'out
losin' myself, but it's ten to one against his bein' there, for
foldin' 'em last night was past mortal man's doin', I know.
But&mdash;he's out there, somewhere."</p>

<p>"Well?" Tyrrell snapped out the query, sharply.</p>

<p>"An' the grey things was out, too, sir," Cotton said
soberly.</p>

<p>"Possibly. But that doesn't mean anything has happened to
Cottrill," Tyrrell said. "He's got a gun of mine, and there's the
dog."</p>

<p>"Aye, sir, but what gets me is that he knows these fells as no
other man knows 'em," Cotton pointed out. "I'd trust him to find
his way in this, or in the blackest night, from here to Whitrigg,
cross-country all the way. If he'd suffered no damage, he'd have
been back, now."</p>

<p>"Then what do you propose about it?" Tyrrell asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I'm pretty much at home about these fells myself,
but I don't propose to go over 'em alone, while the grey things
are about. I reckoned, if so be as there was two or three of us,
now." He paused, and glanced from Tyrrell to Gees and back,
questioningly.</p>

<p>"You mean, you'd guide in this?" Gees poked an index finger
toward the dense fog that enfolded them, and the gesture was
incredulous.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I don't say I'd go everywhere," Cotton answered.
"But the tracks I know, an' there's a good man somewhere out
there, maybe needin' our help. I'd do my damndest to find him,
though not alone."</p>

<p>There followed a silence, in which Tyrrell stood
irresolute.</p>

<p>"A good man," Cotton said again, earnestly. "One o' the best
shepherds that ever whistled a dog, an' a good man as well."</p>

<p>"Well, do you want me to come with you?" Tyrrell demanded
harshly.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I wouldn't ask that. I'd rather you didn't, to tell
the truth. If you got a couple o' breechloaders, an' I took
Weelum an' Nevern&mdash;neither of 'em's doin' anything till the
fog lifts, I'll be bound&mdash;wi' them two, I'd make as good a
search as I could."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, then," Tyrrell bade.</p>

<p>He went back into the house, and Gees and Cotton waited in
silence until he returned, carrying a pair of hammerless breech
loading shot guns. He handed them to Cotton, who took them
reverently, as one who could appreciate a beautiful pair of guns
when he saw them.</p>

<p>"There!" Tyrrell said, and, putting his hand in his pocket,
brought out a handful of cartridges. "Loaded with number
three&mdash; stuff to stop a bull, let alone a dog." He handed
the cartridges over and produced more. "Three dozen,
altogether&mdash;but what about you, though?"</p>

<p>"I'll take Cottrill's own gun," Cotton said, "an' bein' a
twelve-bore, it'll take these cartridges. Thankye, sir. I'll find
Weelum, an' then go along an' pick up Nevern on the way&mdash;an'
come back here to let you know after we've found him, some time
today."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, Cotton," Tyrrell said. "Fetch him
back&mdash;tell him not to trouble about the sheep till the fog
lifts. He can do nothing till then, and he's better sitting over
a fire than out there."</p>

<p>"Aye, that's right, sir. I'll find Weelum an' do my best."</p>

<p>He took four steps, and was no more than an indistinct shadow:
two more, and he had vanished altogether, while, such was the
deadening quality of the fog, even the sound of his footsteps
ceased to reach Tyrrell and Gees by the doorway. The stillness
about them was absolute.</p>

<p>"I wonder why he didn't want you?" Gees reflected aloud.</p>

<p>"Wants to go his own way, and is afraid I might give orders, I
expect," Tyrrell said. "Also I know none of them like my
friendship with the McCouls. It's made a difference, but"&mdash;a
note of determination came into his voice&mdash;"I'll make them
accept her! That is, unless I sell out and go. This&mdash;these
killings&mdash;can't go on."</p>

<p>"Quite so," Gees assented. "But what would you do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Tyrrell said doubtfully. "As you remarked, I'm
not a poor man, and I suppose I'd find something&mdash;I don't
know. But you see&mdash;perhaps you've seen already, that
is&mdash;how this hellish business is getting me down. I'm not
myself, Gees. I'm losing poise, getting irritable and hating
myself for it. My nerve is going, I know."</p>

<p>"Not to be wondered at, after six months of it," Gees
commented. "Let's go in&mdash;it's chilly out here." He turned to
the doorway.</p>

<p>"Why, yes." Tyrrell followed him into the big hall and closed
the door. "I think I'll go over and see McCoul and Gyda. Cotton
won't be back for hours, and there's nothing else to do."</p>

<p>"I'll come with you," Gees offered. "Or"&mdash;as he saw
Tyrrell's sudden stare&mdash;"don't you want me? Just as you
like."</p>

<p>"Yes, come along," Tyrrell said. "I'll get my coat."</p>

<p>Gees, getting his own coat, slipped the Webley in its pocket.
They set out, guiding themselves by keeping to the edge of the
drive and then to the side of the lane. Tyrrell, evidently
engrossed in thought, kept silence until they came to the stone
bridge, and Gees, except for swearing when he stubbed his toe
against a stone, made no remark. Then Tyrrell halted and looked
back, as if he sought to pierce the fog that prisoned them from
sight of their surroundings.</p>

<p>"I'm badly worried about Cottrill," he said. "I wonder if I
ought to have gone? He'd have gone home last night,
unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gees waited. Presently Tyrrell faced about again.</p>

<p>"He may have been out where he didn't think it safe to try
getting back, though," he said, as if to comfort himself with the
supposition. "And Cotton's got two good men with him&mdash;no, I
could do nothing more than they can, if I did go. Not as much, in
fact."</p>

<p>They bent to the ascent that faced them, and came to the
standing stones at the entrance to Locksborough, where Gees
halted.</p>

<p>"I won't come in with you, after all," he said. "Go on
alone."</p>

<p>"Why, what on earth's the idea?" Tyrrell asked in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, just changed my mind," Gees answered. "I mean it,
though."</p>

<p>"It isn't&mdash;it isn't because you don't want to meet
her&mdash;them&mdash;is it?" Tyrrell demanded, with a hint of
resentful suspicion.</p>

<p>"Not that at all," Gees answered frankly. "Something
altogether different, I assure you. And you'll want her to
yourself."</p>

<p>He smiled as he said it, and Tyrrell looked reassured. "Odd of
you after coming so far," he said. "Still, just as you like."</p>

<p>"Go on, man," Gees urged. "I'd only be the unwanted one."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;see you for lunch, then," Tyrrell said, and went
on.</p>

<p>He vanished almost instantly along the grassy way leading to
the castle. Gees gave him two minutes or less, and then followed,
his hand gripping the Webley in his coat pocket, and his thumb on
the safety catch in readiness to slide it off. The track was easy
to follow, in spite of the fog, and he held to it until he came
to the outer end of the causeway built up to form a level
crossing over the deep, steep-sided moat. Here he turned off to
make the circuit of the moat by way of its outer edge, going
slowly, and gazing down all the time. The slope of the cutting,
he saw, was so steep as to render climbing either up or down
difficult, if not impossible, for the greater part of the
circumference. But, at a point which he judged as almost opposite
the causeway, a path ran down diagonally, grass grown and
evidently little used. He took it and, reaching the bottom of the
moat, found it dry and grass-grown. Then, ascending by the path
again, he resumed his tour of the circumvallation, and came back
to the causeway. That diagonal path made a second means of entry
to the walled enclosure in which the keep and all the rest of the
castle buildings had stood, and, except for these two points, the
moat formed an almost, but not quite, impassable obstacle. One
could clamber up or down that slope, but only with great
difficulty and even risk of falling and rolling down.</p>

<p>"And that," Gees told himself, "is that."</p>

<p>Silently he crossed the causeway, and came under the towering
wall of the keep by the deeply-set door which guarded the main
entrance. He noted that its latch turned by an old-fashioned iron
ring, like the fastenings of church doors, but the door itself
was new-looking. A pause to inspect it, and then he set off to
circle the keep itself. He came to the postern by which he had
seen Shaun Ammon enter, a tiny portal set deep in the thickness
of the massive wall, and showing an ordinary brass knob as means
of opening. At sight of that Gees nodded his head as if some
theory he held were being confirmed, and went on. At the back was
yet another entrance, and it appeared to him that it had been cut
in the wall not long since, and again the door was brass-knobbed
and modern, while beside it stood a big, galvanized water tank,
with a pipe leading into it from a semi-rotary pump. Here,
evidently, was the water supply, and probably the means of access
that Ammon generally used. Gees went on, found the fourth wall of
the square blank and solid, and halted at the corner of the
frontage.</p>

<p>For a period that he could not have measured as time he stood,
his back pressed against the solid stone, his right hand gripping
the pistol in his pocket, and every nerve a-quiver with something
approaching panic terror. There was no sight nor sound, to his
physical senses, to cause him fear, but he had a consciousness
that the whiteness which now seemed to press on him was filled
with presences, evil things not of earth&mdash;though he gripped
the pistol, he knew it was quite useless against these impalpable
presences. He would have shouted, useless though any cry would be
with the thickness of the wall intervening between him and any
other human being, but he had no voice. He would have moved away,
but had no power of movement&mdash;and yet, so far as sight or
feeling told him, there was nothing to prevent cry or movement.
Yet there were things crowding on him, foul as murder in the
dark, more fearful, more evil, than any tangible
beings&mdash;Amber's tale of the old dead came into his mind, and
that other tale of the specter of Thorfinnsson, whose human
assailant had withered away after battle with him. And though he
stood in utter silence, yet there were voices at his
ears&mdash;voices that told of unimaginable evil, yet made no
sound.</p>

<p>"In the name of God!" he whispered
desperately&mdash;whispered, because he had no voice. But with
the whisper he was alone again, drawing a long breath of more
than relief and, lifting his hand to his forehead, he found it
wet with a cold sweat.</p>

<p>He had seen nothing, heard nothing, felt nothing. To all
outward sense, he had experienced no more than a waking
nightmare&mdash;but he knew now why the people of Odder feared to
pass the standing stones in the dark, and knew that his own soul
had been given a glimpse of the presences that throng hell. They
had gone, and earth and air were clear of them, for this present,
but they might return.</p>

<p>He went along the wall toward the main entrance. Suddenly a
tall figure loomed before him in the fog, and resolved itself
into McCoul, standing by the doorway and gazing at him
bleakly.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Green," McCoul said. "Lost your way in the fog,
eh?"</p>

<p>"I must have done," Gees answered, and, seeing the faint,
satiric smile that grew about McCoul's lips, felt sure the man
knew that he had not lost his way&mdash;knew, possibly, where he
had been, and why.</p>

<p>"Won't you come in? I suppose you came to take Mr. Tyrrell
back for lunch, since he said he would have to go. He is inside,
with my daughter." And McCoul gestured toward the open door and
stood back, waiting for Gees to precede him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I will," Gees assented, and entered through the
mighty wall&mdash;it was over a dozen feet in thickness, he
saw.</p>

<p>Inside, he saw that the apartment to which he had entered ran
the full width of the keep from right to left, but lacked
possibly a third of its depth. Remembering the water tank and
pump by the doorway at the back, he decided that Shaun Ammon had
his quarters and kitchen there, but there appeared to be no
communication between the back premises and this great room, in
which he could see, as means of ingress, only the door by which
he had entered and, in the left-hand front corner as he stood,
the beginning of a spiral stairway set in the thickness of the
wall. There was a plain, white plaster ceiling a good twenty feet
from the floor, which was of new-looking pine boards, unstained
and unpolished, but with rugs scattered over it&mdash;and, in the
vast area of the room, they looked like mere postage stamps. As
for the sparse furnishing, Gees decided that everything had been
delivered in plain vans, and that in making his selection McCoul
had determined on keeping the monthly payments as low as he could
with decency. And the uncovered grey stone walls gave the place a
grim, chill look.</p>

<p>Yet there was warmth enough; in each end wall was a fireplace,
in each a log fire burned, and each had its big wicker basket of
sawn logs for replenishing the fires at need. By the one at the
left side, not far from the gaping, gloomy staircase entrance,
stood Tyrrell and Gyda, clearly defined in the light of a pendent
Aladdin lamp, the light of which supplemented such as was
admitted through the four arrow-slits, two in the front wall and
one at each end. Gees advanced toward the pair, and McCoul
followed him, breaking away to put more logs on the fire before
which a long, plush-upholstered settee was placed.</p>

<p>"I found Mr. Green outside," McCoul said, addressing nobody in
particular. "It appears that he lost his way in the fog."</p>

<p>"Not difficult," Tyrrell observed. "But&mdash;Gees, old chap,
what's wrong with you? You look as if you'd seen a ghost."</p>

<p>"It was nothing," Gees answered&mdash;quite truthfully. "I'd
no idea I looked anything different from the
ordinary&mdash;morning, Miss McCoul." It was a belated
salutation, he felt.</p>

<p>"Good morning." She stretched out her hand, and he took it and
felt her clasp as something warm, vital, even thrilling. And she
smiled at him: she was different, softer, more woman and less
mystery, than when he had seen her at dinner at Dowlandsbar.
Again she was wearing grey, a plainly-cut, fleecy-looking frock
that set off her perfect figure and appeared to emphasize her
height. "I suppose you have come to drag Philip away?"</p>

<p>"To make a morning call myself, say," he suggested. "From what
I know of Tyrrell, the man who wants to drag him anywhere ought
to turn out with a four-horse team and a crowbar to prize him
loose from what he's holding. You have spacious quarters here,
Miss McCoul."</p>

<p>"And that is about all you can say for them," she said, and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he dissented. "Think of the historic associations of
the place. And you might stumble on the de Boisgeant treasure at
any moment&mdash;the plunder of the old priory that de Vere
couldn't find."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid neither my father nor I have been interested in
the history of the place," she said, her smile vanishing.</p>

<p>"Tyrrell, I thought you told me Mr. Mccoul had antiquarian
tastes?" Gees accused. "You hear what Miss McCoul is telling
me?"</p>

<p>"My interest is in ancient architecture," McCoul put in,
turning from the fire. "Early Gothic, for instance&mdash;this
keep is no more than a stone box, as you may have noticed. Its
occupants&mdash;I am not interested in them. They built for use,
and ignored symmetry or decoration."</p>

<p>"But that, now"&mdash;Gees nodded at a blurred escutcheon
carved in the stone over the fireplace. "There's decoration,
surely&mdash;the arms of the de Boisgeants, I take it.
Two&mdash;yes, two wolves, couchant and regardant, as supporters
to a&mdash;I don't know, though. If that thing in the middle were
a bit clearer, I should say it was a harp. And if there ever were
a motto on that scroll underneath, it has worn away."</p>

<p>"I have not studied heraldry," McCoul said, very stiffly.</p>

<p>"Philip has been telling me he is very anxious about his
shepherd," Gyda cut in&mdash;Gees had an impression that she was
determined to change the subject of conversation. "I do hope
nothing has happened to the man. It must be awful, being lost on
the fells in this fog. And those awful dogs that have been
killing the sheep&mdash;not that they would dare to attack a man,
and I understand the shepherd has a gun with him."</p>

<p>"You think they are dogs, then?" Gees asked, gazing full at
her.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" Again she smiled at him. "What else?"</p>

<p>"I believe," Tyrrell put in, "Gees&mdash;that is,
Green&mdash;has a theory about these things, Gyda, and believes
they are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Several theories," Gees cut in harshly, and glared at
Tyrrell. "For instance, if a couple of beasts of any kind got
loose from a menagerie, they could hide among the fells and do
damage like this."</p>

<p>"Quite a feasible solution," McCoul remarked approvingly. "And
if that is the case, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Green, how do you propose
to catch them?"</p>

<p>"By another drive," Gees answered promptly, "such as I
understand was organized by the police earlier in the year."</p>

<p>"Ah, possibly," McCoul said, as if he considered the
suggestion and would deliver a verdict on it later. "Yes,
possibly."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," Tyrrell remarked, "if we're going back for
lunch&mdash;" He glanced at his wrist watch, and then at Gees,
and did not end it.</p>

<p>Then Gees looked at his watch, and discovered to his amazement
that two full hours had passed since he had parted from Tyrrell
by the monoliths. He recalled the timeless terror in which he had
stood backed against the wall of the keep&mdash;it had lasted far
longer than he had thought. McCoul touched his arm, and glanced
at Tyrrell significantly.</p>

<p>"Shall we make our adieux outside, Mr. Green?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Gees assented. "Considerate of you to think of it,
sir."</p>

<p>They went out. From the corner of his eye, as he passed out
from the place, Gees saw Gyda's arms go up and about Tyrrell's
neck. Outside, McCoul looked up at the sky, and nodded
approvingly.</p>

<p>"The fog is thinning, Mr. Green," he said, "and I believe I
can feel the beginning of a breeze. Do come and see us again
while you're here, won't you? Though, I understand, you are not
staying long."</p>

<p>"No, not long," Gees answered, "but we shall meet again."</p>

<p>McCoul gave him a long, questioning look, but did not put the
question into words. And his eyes, Gees felt as he met that gaze,
were twin wells of blackness in which dwelt hypnotic power. For
awhile they stood, the will of each strained to its utmost,
McCoul compelling, and Gees resisting. Then Tyrrell came out, and
McCoul relaxed and smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I think we shall meet again," and there was
in the words a sound as of one sword blade grinding along
another. "You will always be welcome, as Mr. Tyrrell's
friend."</p>

<p>"Thanks so much, Mr. McCoul," Gees answered. "I shall look
forward to our next meeting."</p>

<p>"And now we'll go and see about that lunch," Tyrrell said
heartily. "The fog is thinning, obviously, and we may have news
of Cottrill when we get back. If so, Mr. McCoul, I shall accept
Gyda's invitation for tea this afternoon. I&mdash;er&mdash;well,
you know, it's all new."</p>

<p>"May it never grow old," McCoul answered. "I shall hope to see
you, and hand you over to her care for tea."</p>

<p>At the inner end of the causeway across the moat, Gees glanced
behind him. The fog had certainly thinned, for he could see the
towering frontage of the keep as a darkness in the reek, and,
before it, a figure that he knew was McCoul's, though it was but
a line against the background of stone.</p>

<p>"May it never grow old," Tyrrell, beside him, echoed softly.
"It can't&mdash;man, she's wonderful! I never dreamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lost himself in recollection.</p>

<p>"That steak we had for lunch yesterday was wonderful too,"
Gees said. "I hope there's something as good today."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you hog!" Tyrrell gasped.</p>

<p>"Aye, hoping there's good offal in the trough. Step it out,
man, or your gong will have gone before we get there."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER  XI. &mdash; FOUND</h2>

<p class="first">BY mid-afternoon, when Tyrrell, more anxious
than ever now over what might have happened to Cottrill, went out
to the front of the house to gaze toward the entrance to the
drive, a south-west breeze had driven the fog away, and the
rugged landscape was plain to sight in the soft, slight warmth of
the late autumn sun. Gees, following his host, saw him gazing
toward the tower of Locksborough, and realized that his thoughts
were divided between Cottrill and Gyda, fear for the one and
longing for the other.</p>

<p>"If only they'd come back!" he said. "She's expecting me."</p>

<p>"They are coming back, now," Gees said.</p>

<p>Tyrrell spun on his heels to face toward the drive entrance.
Only one of the three who had set out appeared&mdash;Cotton, with
a breechloader in the crook of his arm and his dog plodding
beside him. And, because of the way he walked, Tyrrell made no
move toward him, but stood until, with his message in his eyes
before he spoke, Cotton faced him.</p>

<p>"Found?" Tyrrell asked&mdash;though he knew. "Speak, man!"
There was, in that adjuration, the anger that bespeaks fear.</p>

<p>"Aye, found," Cotton said. "Him an' Jimmy, in Valgersby. Up at
the top end among the rocks, an' his throat torn like the sheep.
God!" He made a queer gesture with his free hand. "That a man
should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean he's dead?" Tyrrell's words were whispered.</p>

<p>"I left Nevern an' Weelum by the body, while I come to tell of
it," Cotton answered. "Neither'd stay alone, so I come back to
tell it."</p>

<p>"You came back alone?" Gees asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"I fear God&mdash;nought else, mister," Cotton said. "I
reckoned"&mdash;he addressed Tyrrell again&mdash;"maybe the
police'd want to see the body where 'tis lyin', so I told 'em not
to move it, not to touch it, till I'd seen you an' heard what you
say. But Weelum an' Nevern'll never stop in the Cleft after
sundown&mdash;Weelum's all of a tremble wi' fright now. Was when
I left 'em there to come an' tell you about it."</p>

<p>Tyrrell glanced at the westerning sun. "Wait," he said, and
went within the house. Presently Gees heard the faint "Ting!" of
the telephone bell, and then the murmur of Tyrrell's voice.</p>

<p>"Where is this place&mdash;Valgersby, Cotton?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Valgersby Cleft, sir&mdash;it's more'n three mile from here,
that way"&mdash;he gestured over the roof of
Dowlandsbar&mdash;"an' a sort of valley between two ridges, like
all of 'em. Only the sides are a bit steep compared wi' most of
'em, an' the top end, where we found him, is sort of walled all
round wi' rock. I've heard my old grandfer say, when I was a boy,
he could remember when there was a sheep farmer lived there, an'
there's the remainders of a house there yet, but it's all part o'
Mr. Tyrrell's land, now. Cottrill had a hut there, for the
lambin'."</p>

<p>"And being out that way, meant to go to the hut for the night,
rather than try to find his way back through the fog," Gees
suggested.</p>

<p>"I reckon that'd be it, sir, except&mdash;he'd gone up past
the hut to the top end, where it's shut in by the rocks. I reckon
he found them things there, knew they were there, an' went after
'em. Got one cornered betwixt him an' the rocks, I'd say, because
the right barrel of his gun'd been fired&mdash;an' then the other
one sprung on him from behind. That's how I read the signs of
it&mdash;an' the stock of the gun is tooth-marked, where one of
'em took hold of it to drag it away from him. All tooth-
marked&mdash;deep marks, too. Lion's strength in the jaws that
did it&mdash;a little more, an' they'd ha' broken the wood to
pieces."</p>

<p>Tyrrell came out to them. "I've talked to Moore," he said.
"He's ringing through to tell Inspector Feather and then coming
along with Doctor Markham. He wants the body left where it is
till he's talked to Feather, so I'm going to Valgersby without
waiting for them. Are you coming with me, Gees?" He gave a glance
toward Locksborough as he spoke. "Or perhaps&mdash;no, though. I
told her&mdash; she'll understand."</p>

<p>"What'll I do, Mr. Tyrrell?" Cotton asked. "D'you want me to
come?"</p>

<p>"If you'll wait here&mdash;not here, but by the gate&mdash;for
Moore and the doctor, and then come along with them," Tyrrell
said. "And whatever Moore says, I'm not leaving the body out
there all night. Perhaps you could help to bring it in,
if&mdash;will you do that, Cotton?" The final question was an
appeal, as if he had no right to ask it.</p>

<p>"Aye, I'd do anything for Cottrill, alive or dead," Cotton
said soberly. "I'll wait as you say, sir, an' come along with
'em."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Tyrrell said, almost humbly. "Shall we go,
Gees?"</p>

<p>They stayed only to get overcoats and sticks&mdash;Gees put
his automatic pistol in the pocket of his overcoat&mdash;and then
set off, Tyrrell making a pace that, Gees knew, would render
overcoats superfluous before they reached the Cleft, if he kept
it up.</p>

<p>"I blame myself," he said. "And yet, with that fog, what could
I do? If others had gone out last night, it might have meant
other lives."</p>

<p>"As far as I can see, you could do nothing," Gees
assented.</p>

<p>"This alters everything," Tyrrell declared after a silence. "I
must sell the flock at once&mdash;next week. Nobody&mdash;no
shepherd would think of taking Cottrill's place, with that danger
to face. I must sell."</p>

<p>"Much may happen before next week," Gees pointed out.</p>

<p>"You've done nothing!" Tyrrell retorted fiercely. "No more
than Feather has done&mdash;except that you've talked about what
you may do. And what can you do&mdash;what can any man do,
against this?"</p>

<p>No reply was possible, Gees felt. He could understand how
Tyrrell felt over this tragedy, how he saw no possibility of
tracking down the beasts that had killed Cottrill. And Tyrrell
was right, of course. No shepherd would risk taking Cottrill's
place, to face this danger.</p>

<p>"I want to give you every chance," Tyrrell said in an altered
tone. "I haven't altogether lost faith in you, Gees, so stay out
your week&mdash;longer, if you like. But I don't see that you or
any man can do anything. It looks utterly hopeless, to me."</p>

<p>"I'll stay out the week, at least," Gees promised.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">The valley ran north and south, narrowing at its northern end
to a horseshoe-like tract, not more than twenty yards from side
to side, shut in by almost perpendicular walls of bare rock some
twenty to thirty feet in height, and quite unclimbable. In the
point of the shoe a dark, irregular line on the rock marked where
a spring oozed and trickled, and there were tufts of moss like
green warts on the smooth stone to mark its way. Where the valley
widened from the horseshoe stood a rough hut of unmortared
stones, roofed by an old tarpaulin that was held down to the
walls by big stones laid on its edges, and round this erection
the walls of an old-time house rose a foot or less above the
short, thick grass. And, between the house and the trickle of
water, Nevern and Weelum stood well back from something that had
been covered by an overcoat. Near by lay the carcass of the dog
Jimmy, its throat a mess of mangled flesh, and a gash behind the
shoulders where jaws that had met to crush the animal's backbone
had torn away the skin and flesh. Between Jimmy's bared teeth
Gees found a few coarse, grizzled hairs: the dog had fought back,
evidently, but whatever had killed him had been a thing of far
greater strength than any dog.</p>

<p>Then, while they waited for Moore and the doctor, Gees
ventured to lift the overcoat and look beneath it, but dropped it
again and stood back, sick with horror. Something had set teeth
into Cottrill's carotid artery above the shoulder-blade&mdash;the
clothing was ripped away from the left shoulder&mdash;and had
torn away the side of his neck. Cottrill's swarthy face, as Gees
remembered it, was now ashy grey, and the lips were whitish,
leaden-looking. <i>They</i> had bled him as they had the sheep,
and then, down towards the ribs, had eaten.</p>

<p>Gees staggered towards the rock wall, and was violently sick.
He sat down on the grass, and Tyrrell stood over him and looked
down.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;they didn't touch his face," he said. "Thank God,
they didn't touch his face! But&mdash;don't look, Tyrrell! Don't
look!"</p>

<p>"Don't fear it," Tyrrell answered, shuddering. "Can you-?"</p>

<p>He did not end it, but Gees understood, and got on his
feet.</p>

<p>"By the living God, I'll get them!" he said.
"Tyrrell&mdash;trust me, man! I'll get them, I tell you! It's got
to end."</p>

<p>Then, speaking no more, they waited, and a little apart from
them Nevern and Weelum waited too. The edge of sunlight crept up
the rock on the eastern side of the cleft, foot by foot, and
after an interval that no one of the four thought to reckon as
time Moore, heavy and slow of movement, and Doctor Markham, a
rather shabby, middle-aged little man, came up the valley and
joined them. Tyrrell gestured at the overcoat as he nodded a
greeting at the doctor.</p>

<p>"There," he said. "But&mdash;you can do nothing. Dead long
since."</p>

<p>"It must be examined, Mr. Tyrrell," Markham answered
gravely.</p>

<p>He went and removed the overcoat to make his examination, and,
standing back from him, they saw him start and heard his
exclamation of horror. Then he knelt&mdash;what he did, none of
the four knew&mdash;and after what seemed a long time replaced
the overcoat, and, rising to his feet, gestured to Moore, who had
been standing back with the others, his helmet in his hand. The
man went toward him.</p>

<p>"There is no purpose in leaving the body here," Markham said.
"I can tell you&mdash;he has been dead more than twelve hours,
and there are not four ounces of blood left in the body. The
opening of the carotid artery was the cause of death. There is no
purpose in leaving the body here and from what I have seen it
would not be wise to leave it, unless you care to stay the night
and watch over it."</p>

<p>"God forbid, sir!" Moore exclaimed. "I'd be next, if I
did."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will arrange, Mr. Tyrrell," Markham
suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes." Tyrrell looked down the valley, toward the lane, and
saw Cotton and his dog approaching. "Nevern&mdash;you and
Weelum&mdash;get a hurdle or something&mdash;no, you'll find
planks in that hut, though, to put him on. We'll take turns at
carrying him back&mdash;there's no time to send for a cart before
sunset. A wide plank, if you can find it."</p>

<p>The two went toward the hut, and Cotton approached
Tyrrell.</p>

<p>"I stopped to tell my sister he wouldn't come back,
sir&mdash;Mrs. Nevern, that is. Are you takin' him back,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, carrying him," Tyrrell answered somberly.</p>

<p>"I was thinkin', sir&mdash;I'll take his place, if you
like."</p>

<p><i>"What?"</i> Tyrrell exclaimed, thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"Take his place," Cotton repeated calmly. "Y'see, sir, Effie
here is as good as Jimmy was&mdash;better, if anything, wi'
sheep, an' if I take his place I might stand a chance o' gettin'
them. To even things up for him&mdash;the best man for miles, he
was." There were tears in the man's eyes as he ended his
explanation, chokily.</p>

<p>Tyrrel held out his hand. "Tom, you're a good man, too," he
said. "But I wouldn't let you or any man take the risk of night
watching, after this. You may have Cottrill's place, at
Cottrill's pay, but run no risks. I shall blame myself if you
do&mdash;and suffer by it."</p>

<p>Nevern, carrying a wide deal plank, came out from the
shepherd's hut, and Weelum followed him. The doctor and Moore
helped them to place the body on the plank, and then, Nevern at
the head end and Weelum carrying the other, they set off without
waiting for any word from Tyrrell, and Moore and Markham went
with them. Gees picked up the gun that Cottrill had carried, and
saw, near the butt-plate, indentations a quarter-inch and more
deep in the polished walnut of the stock. There was, too, a gouge
in the under side of the wood where a piece had been bitten out
altogether. Breaking the gun, Gees saw a fired shell in the right
barrel and an untouched cartridge in the left.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," Cotton said to Tyrrell, after a long pause in
which he watched Gees' movements, "if so be the grey things are
to get me, they'll get me, whether you take me on or no, for as
sure as God made me I'll haunt these fells till they or I come to
an end. If so be I'm to get them, it'll be so&mdash;I shan't go
before my time. An'&mdash;you go along, sir, an' I'll fold 'em in
Anker's Glen tonight."</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the sort," Tyrrell declared firmly.
"It's far too late to set about rounding up the flock, and as one
of those who found the body you'll be wanted by Inspector Feather
to tell your tale. No. Whatever I lose by it, the sheep stay out,
tonight."</p>

<p>"All right, sir. Just as you say, and I'll be after 'em in the
mornin'. There may be one or other on its back&mdash;I'll do my
best to take his place. An' poor old Jimmy&mdash;I'd like to bury
him, sir."</p>

<p>"To-morrow," Tyrrell said. "You'll come back with us,
now."</p>

<p>They followed the way the bearers had gone down the line of
the valley until they reached the lane and saw the more slowly-
moving little party going on ahead. Then Gees spoke abruptly.</p>

<p>"Where do you burn the carcasses of the sheep, Tyrrell?"</p>

<p>"Down in the dip the other side of the house," Tyrrell
answered. "There's a line of trees and brushwood along the stream
that goes under the stone bridge, as you may have noticed, and it
takes a lot of wood, as well as cans of paraffin. And then we
bury what's left of the bones."</p>

<p>"Ah! Can you pile me a heap ready for a burning&mdash;a big
heap?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I could have it done," Tyrrell answered. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it may be needed soon&mdash;any time, now," Gees
said. "A big pile&mdash;half as big again as you'd make for two
sheep, say, and fully a dozen cans of paraffin if you have that
many about the place."</p>

<p>"As many as you want," Tyrrell assured him. "I always keep a
big stock for the engine that runs my electric light
plant&mdash;in winter, we get practically cut off, at times, so I
run no risks."</p>

<p>"Good! A dozen two-gallon cans, and a big pile. I'd like it
laid and the paraffin cans put beside it&mdash;with a bucket to
throw more paraffin on the fire as needed&mdash;tonight, if you
can manage it."</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;why do you want this done?" Tyrrell
demanded.</p>

<p>"Remember what I told you," Gees said. "If I'm to put an end
to this&mdash;this hellishness, it's got to be in my own way, and
what I say goes. And that&mdash;making the pile ready, is all I
shall ask of you."</p>

<p>"All right, it shall be done," Tyrrell promised, rather
sulkily, "but I wish you were not so damned mysterious about
things."</p>

<p>"I've got to be," Gees told him. "You may see that I have my
reason for that, even, later on. If all goes well, not much later
on."</p>

<p>"Twenty-four gallons o' paraffin," Cotton remarked abruptly,
as Tyrrell did not speak again. "You're goin' to have a mighty
fire, mister."</p>

<p>"I shall need it, I think," Gees said. "Also, I shall want a
word with you later, Cotton. Don't go back from Dowlandsbar to
wherever you're going before you've seen me. Have you got a
twelve-bore gun?"</p>

<p>"Aye sir. Most of us round here like a bit o' rabbitin'."</p>

<p>"Good! And you've got that pair of beauties as well as this
I'm carrying, Tyrrell. Four-yes, four will be enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn all this mystery!" Tyrrell broke out harshly. "Why
the devil can't you say plainly what you mean to do, man?"</p>

<p>But Gees, foreseeing all that he hoped to do, was unruffled by
the outburst, for he knew that to tell Tyrrell would be to spoil
all.</p>

<p>"You promised I should carry out my contract in my own way,"
he said. "This <i>is</i> my way. Until you think I've failed, let
me follow it!"</p>

<p>They caught up with the other four and their burden. Constable
Moore had relieved Weelum, who now carried the pair of guns.
Cotton drew alongside Nevern and touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Give it over to me, Bill," he said. "You've had about enough,
I reckon, an' he was my friend. Let me take that end."</p>

<p>They made the exchange, and the little party went on in
silence for awhile. Where the lane topped the last ridge before
Dowlandsbar, Gees paused for a second to look round the fells.
The sun was no more than a half hour above the horizon; bare,
treeless ridges, rock-spotted, purpled with heather, lay soaking
in the mellow sunset light. A line of rooks straggled across the
sky to northward, heading for a clump of firs in the very far
distance, and Tyrrell's sheep dotted the nearer sides of the
heights in ones and twos and little groups. From the hollows in
which cottages were hidden lines of smoke rose and wavered north-
eastward in the faint breeze that brought a tang of the sea, and
a light haze began to gather with the approach of night.</p>

<p>"He's light, so light," Tom Cotton said softly, as if to
himself. "He was never more'n a little man, but he had a heart of
gold."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">Inspector Feather, in company with a lank, dour-looking,
uniformed police sergeant, came out from the shed in which
Cottrill's body had been placed at Dowlandsbar, and saw Gees and
Tom Cotton waiting outside. Following the two police officers
came Tyrrell and Doctor Markham, and the doctor spoke to Tyrrell
as they emerged.</p>

<p>"I should like to wash my hands, Mr. Tyrrell," he said.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, doctor," Tyrrell answered, and led on toward
the house. But, when Feather and the sergeant would have followed
them, Gees held up a beckoning finger, and they paused.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Inspector?" Gees asked, accenting the
first pronoun as if he anticipated an opinion of value.</p>

<p>"Make of it?" the inspector snapped. "What can I make of it?
You said, when I saw you before, you knew something of police
work, so I expect you know this means my resignation. Six months
of sheep-worrying might pass, but with a man killed&mdash;well!
I'm finished."</p>

<p>"Because you can't get what's doing it?" Gees suggested. "No,
stay here, Cotton"&mdash;as Tom turned away&mdash;"I want you
too."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> want?" Feather demanded sharply. "What
the&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Inspector," Gees said in the pause, "if you caught these
things, put an end to it, you wouldn't have to resign, would
you?"</p>

<p>"If!" Feather echoed bitterly. "What can I do? I've tried
everything I know. A couple of regiments of soldiers to comb all
this country&mdash;for a month on end, and <i>then</i> it's began
again! What can I do?"</p>

<p>"I'll forfeit five hundred pounds to any charity you like to
name, or to you personally if you like, if those two things are
alive at the end of another fortnight," Gees said. "That is, if
you'll put yourself under my orders, and unless they're charged
with murder and held for trial&mdash;which is next to impossible.
Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;charged with murder&mdash;dogs?" Feather gasped in
semi-stupefaction. "Here&mdash;five hundred pounds&mdash;what are
you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Saving your resignation, if you do as I tell you," Gees
answered.</p>

<p>"Well, but what&mdash;who are you, anyhow?" Feather
demanded.</p>

<p>"Remember the Kestwell case?" Gees asked in reply.</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "There's no police officer in all
England who doesn't," he said. "A proper cause celebre,
that."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm Gees."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" Feather exclaimed. "And you want me
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off, staring, and shook his head. "Gees!" he
murmured.</p>

<p>"I want two good men, and absolute secrecy," Gees told him
calmly. "That is, in addition to this very good man&mdash;you,
Tom Cotton. Four of us, with our hearts in it&mdash;and good
shots, too. We've got to be good shots, and bag our game without
reloading. To save you from resigning, Inspector&mdash;will you
follow my lead, and get these things?"</p>

<p>"Gladly, so long as you don't go outside the law," Feather
promised.</p>

<p>"Right! I suppose you can handle a twelve-bore breechloader,
eh?"</p>

<p>"As well as the next man. So can Rapkin, here&mdash;Sergeant
Rapkin, Mr. Gees&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Green, isn't it? This
business has got me down."</p>

<p>"Green&mdash;Gees, anything you like, as long as you play in
with me. You've got to lose a few nights' sleep, watching for
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it, that's been done for six months, now!" Feather
interrupted. "If that's all you can do, we've done it
already."</p>

<p>"Wait, man!" Gees urged gently. "Watching in a certain place.
Supposing I know where these things hide, and we wait for them
there&mdash;wait to catch them coming out or going in? I know, I
tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how do you know?" the inspector asked dubiously.</p>

<p>"That's my business. Resign if you like, of course. But I'll
put up five hundred pounds, and put the check into anyone's hands
you like to appoint&mdash;made payable to you, in the event of
failure."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned," Feather said rather feebly.</p>

<p>"Not yet," Gees assured him. "Come under my orders&mdash;do as
I tell you, and you won't be&mdash;that is, you won't have to
resign through failing to catch these things. Are you game to try
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," Feather answered decidedly. "And for your
fourth man&mdash;Sergeant Rapkin here. A better shot than I am,
if anything."</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you, Sergeant," Gees said to the man. "Now, do
either of you know anything about Locksborough?" He nodded
towards the castle.</p>

<p>"You don't mean&mdash;these silly rumors about Mr. McCoul?"
Feather asked incredulously. "Because if you're after him, I'll
have nothing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want you to meet McCoul&mdash;I don't want you to
have anything to do with McCoul," Gees interrupted. "Beast, not
men, we're after."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you said Locksborough," Feather said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>will</i> you do as I tell you?" Gees broke out, with a
momentary gust of impatience. "Locksborough isn't McCoul,
man!"</p>

<p>"It's damned near him, though," Feather pointed out. "Well,
what do you want us to do? Go there? If so, when? And what
for?"</p>

<p>"There is a moat round Locksborough," Gees said quietly.
"There are two ways of crossing it, one at the front, and one at
the back. Some night while we watch&mdash;it may be tonight,
those things will come out and go back in by one of those two
ways. Cotton and I will watch all night in front, and you and
Sergeant Rapkin will watch the back way&mdash;I'll post you, and
come and tell you when to leave your posts, every night that we
have to keep watch. Take it or leave it."</p>

<p>Inspector Feather gazed towards the house, and saw the doctor
standing on the doorstep, apparently waiting to speak to him.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, Sergeant?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, if the gentleman knows what he's talking about&mdash;"
the Sergeant said noncommittally, and left it at that. "All
right!" Feather made up his mind. "I'll try it, Mr. Green, on the
strength of what you did in the Kestwell case. Half a minute
while I have a word with Doctor Markham, and then I'll come back.
You'd better come along with me, Sergeant&mdash;he wants to know
about the inquest."</p>

<p>They went off, and Gees turned to Cotton. "Are you in on this,
Tom?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Up to the neck, Sir," Cotton answered. "If so be as reckon
you know, I'll trust you. An' since it's Locksborogh&mdash;" he
broke off and gazed toward the frowning outlined as it was
against the last of the sunset. "Aye, I felt it was there, all
the time," he ended.</p>

<p>"I think," Gees remarked, as he saw Feather and the sergeant
returning, "you're the surest of us all, Tom. Don't
go&mdash;listen."</p>

<p>They waited, and the two police officers faced Gees again.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked. "Do I put up the five hundred as proof of my
belief in myself. I'll write the check now, you like."</p>

<p>"No, Sir," Feather said. "Here's two men witnesses to what
you've said about it, and if I counted you one who'd go back on
his word I'd have nothing to do with you. It's because I believe
you won't have to write the check that I'll stand in with you.
And now, what?"</p>

<p>"Is there a private room at the <i>Royal George</i>?" Gees
inquired.</p>

<p>"There's a little snuggery round the back," the inspector
admitted.</p>

<p>"Right. Now see Mr. Tyrrell, tell him you want to a couple of
guns, one for yourself and one for the sergeant, and ten rounds
apiece loaded with number three. I'll meet you in that snuggery
at half-past nine tonight, and till then, say nothing."</p>

<p>"You can trust me for that," Feather said decidedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought I could. Tom, can you be here at nine
tonight?"</p>

<p>"Just when you say, sir," Cotton answered unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Nine it is, then, and we'll go together. Mind, Inspector, it
may be tonight, or six or ten nights hence. But if you have
patience, the thing I'm waiting for will happen&mdash;and then
you won't have to resign. I'm as sure of it as I am of death or
an income tax form."</p>

<p>"Nine-thirty at the <i>George</i>, Sir," the inspector
answered. "It's irregular, and all that, but so's the whole
business from start to finish. And I believe you know what you're
talking about."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER  XII. &mdash;  VAIN VIGIL</h2>

<p class="first">"WE will have a look in the bar, first," Gees
suggested. "It's not quite half-past nine, and I'd like to get
the feeling of the meeting."</p>

<p>"Right you are, sir," Tom Cotton assented, and led way toward
the main entrance of the <i>Royal George</i>. Gees spared a
thought for Tyrrell, glooming at home alone. He had had an idea
of accompanying Gees as far as the gateway of the castle, with a
view to calling Gyda, but, when Gees had stated that he might
stay at the vicarage talking to Amber up to any hour, had decided
not to risk it. That, as Gees knew, would be the decision of
everyone in the district, as soon as the news of Cottrill's death
got about: nobody would venture out alone after dark, which, for
Gees, simplified matters to some extent.</p>

<p>He followed Cotton into the bar, and saw twice as many men
there as when he had visited the place with Cottrill. As he and
Cotton went up to the counter, he heard buzz of talk, and
Cottrill's name separated itself from the general gabble in more
than one place. The news got round&mdash;possibly Constable Moore
had been talking. But there it was, and there was no other
subject for discussion, for that night.</p>

<p>"Pints, Tom, eh?" Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"Pints it is, sir," Tom assented, as Querrett nodded a genial
welcome at them both before turning to fill another order.</p>

<p>He returned, and Gees requested two pints. Querrett grinned at
him.</p>

<p>"Thankye, sir. Takin' it to Sussex with you?"</p>

<p>"Inside," Gees answered. "I'd hate to let beer like yours go
flat."</p>

<p>"Eh, the man from Sussex!" It was Ben Latimer's voice. "Howde
do, mister? Have they started clampin' up their taters down yure
way yet?"</p>

<p>"I really couldn't say, Mr. Latimer," Gees answered. "I hope
to be going back in a day or two, and I'll write and let you
know, if you like. Meanwhile, what do you say to a
pint&mdash;beer, not taters?"</p>

<p>"Mister, that's a fine idea," Ben assented gravely. "An' to
think that the last time you come in heer, 'twas wi' poor
Cottrill! Ah, a good man if ever there was one! Straight as an
ash-plant, he was."</p>

<p>Gees turned to the bar to order another pint, and took the two
that Querrett had already filled, handing one to Cotton and
taking the other to Ben. Returning to get his own and pay, he saw
Harold Amber enter, and saw, too, that the lad checked
momentarily at sight of him, and then came on up to the bar in a
swaggering, defiant sort of way. Then, with his own tankard in
his hand, Gees turned to Ben.</p>

<p>"What was that you said?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only't he oughter come in, when the fog dropped down,
mister," Ben said. "Whether 'twas the old dead, or them"&mdash;he
splashed some part of his drink on the floor as he spoke the
accented word&mdash;"he oughter come in. You knew him&mdash;he
brought you heer, an' stood for you.</p>

<p>"Aye, he did," Gees assented. "But what do you
think&mdash;what, Ben?"</p>

<p>"Mister"&mdash;the old man looked up at him&mdash;"three more
year, an' I make my threescore an' ten. From a child I've' heard
tales, fairy tales like Jack an' the beanstalk, an' put no more
to 'em than a grown man should. I've believed what I've seen, the
good grass on the earth, an' trees, an' flowers bloomin', an' the
cattle on a thousand hills, as the Book says&mdash;an' sheep too.
An' men friendly an' not afraid, men like Cottrill doin' their
jobs an' payin' no heed to fairy tales, no more than I did. An'
then this&mdash;a thing no mortal man can believe in
daylight&mdash;things that know as much as men, an' act like men,
except that men don't drink blood. Fairy tales, people of the
hills, Men of Peace," and again he splashed drink on the floor
with the words, "an' the tales that made us shiver when we were
little children are true! True, mister! There's no man heer'll go
home alone tonight. We know. Hear 'em talk&mdash;listen to any of
'em. The things that do this've tasted human blood, an' we know.
The old dead, or <i>them</i>." And again, with the last word, he
spilled beer on the floor. "Heer's to you, mister," he ended,
and, lifting the tankard, drank of its depleted contents.</p>

<p>"Mr. Green?" Harold Amber stood beside Gees. "Can I have a
word with you? Sorry to interrupt, and all that, but&mdash;well,
you know."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't," Gees said. "Excuse me, Mr.
Latimer&mdash;just a moment. Well?" He faced Harold. "What is
it?"</p>

<p>"Must you show me up in front of my father?" Harold asked
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," Gees said, thoughtfully. "For a start,
could I? You're rather a blot, aren't you? Show you
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>He caught the fist raised to strike him, twisted the
youngster's arm, and Harold moaned feebly with the pain of it. So
quietly was the altercation conducted that nobody saw enough to
interfere.</p>

<p>"Don't," Gees warned, quietly. "Don't be a bigger fool than
you are now, and never tackle a full-grown man till you're sure
he's drunker than you are, Harold Amber. And before you get drunk
on this very good beer, understand that there isn't a yokel in
this bar that doesn't despise you as a chap that can't carry his
drink&mdash;I saw that, the last time I was in here. I'm not
going to do sob-stuff over your mother and father and what your
damned silliness means to them, but just telling you&mdash;you're
letting yourself down. When a village like Odder despises you,
you must be a blot. You are a blot&mdash;turn yourself round and
be a man."</p>

<p>He released Harold's wrist, then, and the boy rubbed his
shoulder wincingly, his face dull red with anger. But he made no
reply, and after a second or two Gees turned and saw Ben Latimer
nod at him approvingly. Evidently the old man had heard some part
of Gees' admonition.</p>

<p>"Do him a power o' good, that will, when he's had time to
think it over," he said. "Us chaps can't talk to him like that,
more's the pity, but he can't reckon he's any cut above you.
Mister, they're sayin' you come here after them things that
killed poor Cottrill." He made more than half a question of the
final statement.</p>

<p>Gees shook his head. "It's a police business, now," he
answered.</p>

<p>"Aye, I s'pose it is," Ben assented regretfully. "But 'tis no
use tellin' Jack Moore or that inspector chap what we're
beginnin' to know is true&mdash;what we do know is true! Tell 'em
to look for what that black-eyed devil's got hid under
Locksborough, an' they'd call ye silly."</p>

<p>"Why, what has he got hidden there?" Gees seated himself on
the bench beside the old man, that their talk might not be
overheard.</p>

<p>"Keeps 'em down there, mister," Ben accused. "Things he's
raised by his black arts, an' lets 'em out to go ravenin'. Unholy
things, raised from their graves for his own use, whatever that
may be. Else, why did he go to live at a place like that? No
ordinary man'd go to live at a place where you can feel the old
dead round you, even in daylight."</p>

<p>Gees shook his head. "If he kept things like these, that man
Ammon wouldn't stay," he dissented. "You saw him in here the
other night."</p>

<p>"Ammon?" Ben echoed skeptically. "He's no more'n a half-wit.
Moreover, mister, I had the doin' o' that place for the
McCouls&mdash; put in two floors an' roofed it in, an' did the
partitionin' of it. An' Ammon is shut off so he can't tell what's
goin' on. The entrance to the underpart is by a stairway at the
front corner o' the ground floor, an' Ammon's two rooms at the
back are altogether cut off from the big front room where the two
fireplaces are. To get in there, he's got to go up a little
staircase to the first floor, an' then come down into that big
front room, an' McCoul's only got to bolt the door at the top o'
the stairs on the first floor to keep Ammon from knowin' anything
o' what goes on, either in that big room or in the dungeons
under."</p>

<p>Again Gees shook his head. "What goes on, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How should I know, mister? I never studied black magic, nor
seen it worked. But you mark my words, it'll be well to keep
childern indoors after dark, round here. Else, they'll begin to
disappear as 'tis said they did in the far-back days, when there
was black magic goin' on at Locksborough. As there is now, wi'
Diarmid McCoul makin' it."</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> name did you say?" Gees asked, startled.</p>

<p>"Why, Diarmid McCoul&mdash;<i>his</i> name," Ben answered.
"'Twas on the agreement I had for my work there, an' on the check
he sent me too late to save my wife. She'd be alive today, but
for him&mdash;rot his soul!"</p>

<p>For a minute or more Gees sat silent, recalling the vicar's
story of the siege of Locksborough and the end of the de
Boisgeants. Then, realizing that Ben in his bitterness was
capable of accusing McCoul of anything, he glanced at his watch
and rose to his feet&mdash;by this time Inspector Feather would
be wondering what had become of him.</p>

<p>"Well, I must go, Mr. Latimer," he said. "I shall see you
again, I hope, and talk about more pleasant things."</p>

<p>"Aye, I'm here most nights," Ben said. "But 'tis a pity you're
givin' up lookin' for them things. Maybe as you say 'tis a police
job, now, but police ways ain't no use, here. They don't
believe."</p>

<p>Gees bade him good night, and went to the door, where Tom
Cotton already stood waiting for him. They emerged from the
place.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes to ten, mister," Tom said reprovingly.</p>

<p>"I know," Gees answered. "Latimer was interesting. Which way
now?"</p>

<p>"Just here," Tom said, indicating a door near the corner of
the inn frontage. "We might ha' gone through by that door at the
end o' the bar, but this way's better, so we're not seen. Aye,
Ben'll always talk against McCoul an' his daughter, if he's half
a chance, an' no wonder, either, the way he was kep' waitin' for
his money while his wife died."</p>

<p>He opened the door, and they entered a small room, lighted by
an ordinary paraffin lamp standing on a red cloth-covered centre
table. Inspector Feather and Sergeant Rapkin, both in heavy,
uniform overcoats, stood side by side on the hearthrug, and four
double-barreled breech loading guns leaned against the wall
opposite them.</p>

<p>"You're rather late, Mr. Green," the inspector remarked
coldly.</p>

<p>"I am," Gees agreed, "but I haven't wasted the time."</p>

<p>"And now what?" Feather asked. "You're in charge, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"If I'm not, you may as well go back and write out that
resignation of yours," Gees answered. "I want my instructions
carried out implicitly, perfectly. All three of you must
understand and agree to that."</p>

<p>"It is understood," Feather told him, very coldly indeed, and
Tom Cotton nodded and murmured some form of indistinct
assent&mdash;but Gees knew it was genuine enough. He gestured at
the guns by the wall.</p>

<p>"One each, as arranged," he said. "Load them in here, and slip
the safety catches off before we pass the standing stones on our
way to Locksborough&mdash;and then keep your fingers off the
triggers till it's time to shoot. Further to that, no word is to
be spoken by any one of you, once we get outside this room, and
as far as possible you are to make no sound. Now,
Inspector&mdash;and you too, Sergeant&mdash;do you know anything
about Locksborough? Could you find your way about there?"</p>

<p>Both men shook their heads, and waited for him to speak
again.</p>

<p>"No, I thought not. Well, there's a moat all round the place,
dry, now, but with sides as good as unclimbable, except in two
places. One is a causeway filled in to make a road to the front
of the keep, and the other is a narrow, diagonal path running
down and up the sides of the moat at the back. Your post,
Inspector, and yours, Sergeant, is where that path comes up the
outer side of the moat, or rather, a few yards back from where it
comes up, so that you get anything coming up that path between
you and the sky&mdash;and if you get one of them, I think Tom
here and I will get the other, unless you can bag both. There is
a little mound set back from the edge of the moat, and there
you'll lie, after I've posted you, either till we get them or
till I come from behind&mdash;from behind, mind, for you're to
shoot anything that shows in front&mdash;to tell you the watch is
over for tonight."</p>

<p>"Do you mean, if a man shows up against the sky, you want us
to fire at him?" Feather asked incredulously. "Because, if
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll stake my own life no man will show up," Gees
interrupted. "That path leads nowhere, except to grass land and
the valley where the stream runs between the castle grounds and
Dowlandsbar, and it would be dangerous in the dark even for a man
who knows it. All you'll see, if you see anything, will be four-
legged things. Is it all clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, except that neither of us will shoot until we're sure
whatever shows up <i>is</i> four-legged," Feather answered. "I'll
detain a man, if you think fit, since I'm following your
instructions, but I won't shoot him."</p>

<p>"That's agreed&mdash;detain him by all means," Gees said.
"Finally, no word spoken, no smoking, and no sound of any kind.
Agreed?"</p>

<p>"Quite," Feather assured him. "Though whether this is any
use&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Back out if you like," Gees said in the pause.</p>

<p>"No, I won't back out. For six months, now, I've been badgered
over this business, and officially reprimanded twice for not
catching the things, whatever they are. After the inquest to-
morrow it won't stop at a reprimand unless I can show results,
and I've got a wife and family to think about. We'll try your
way, and see what happens."</p>

<p>"Tonight, and for several nights, nothing may happen," Gees
warned him. "All I feel sure about is that they will come out
eventually."</p>

<p>"Then why not a search warrant, at once?" Feather
inquired.</p>

<p>"Could you get one?" Gees asked in reply. "You have no
evidence of any sort to offer, and I certainly wouldn't come
forward to give you any, because I know perfectly well that a
search on a warrant, however thorough you might make it, would be
utterly useless."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose we've got to do as you say," Feather responded
after a long pause. "But aren't we rather late about
starting?"</p>

<p>"You may leave that to me. Now, take a gun apiece and load it,
and we'll start&mdash;you and the sergeant will follow us two.
And mind, once outside here, no word is to be spoken by any one
of us. I'll point you and the sergeant to your places, and then
Tom and I will take ours."</p>

<p>He took a gun and loaded it from the cartridges already in his
pocket, and the other three followed suit. Then they went out
and, turning away from the lighted entrance, went up and out from
the village. There was no soul in sight: tonight, and for many
nights to come, Gees felt certain, nobody would remain abroad in
Odder: the frequenters of the <i>Royal George</i> would come and
go only in pairs or more, and would both come and go straight
from and to their homes.</p>

<p>With the coming of night, the south-west breeze that had
driven away the fog had strengthened. Clouds obscured the sky,
and the night was dark as any Gees had known, though clear; the
air was soft, threatful of rain. There would be little hardship,
clad as they were, in their watch, unless the rain came down
before dawn. Silently they came to the standing stones and passed
between them, and now Gees, gesturing to Cotton to fall behind
him, took the lead, the other three following in single file.
Then the raised embankment of the moat's outer edge showed dimly,
while beyond it two lines of light in the lower wall of the keep
showed that the ground floor was occupied. Gees led on, swerving
off before he reached the causeway to circle the moat on its
outer side.</p>

<p>Peering downward, he found the point where the diagonal path
emerged at the back. There, waiting till the other three grouped
round him in a little hollow, he took Feather by the sleeve and
led him to his post, gesturing him to lie down, and then
returning to place the sergeant beside him. From where they lay,
the entrance to the path showed as a V-shaped cut in the
embankment, clear of the keep and outlined against the night sky.
He pointed toward it, kneeling beside Feather, and won a nod in
response. Then he rose and went back to where Tom Cotton waited,
and, gesturing to Tom to follow, led the way to the front of the
keep again, noting, as he passed, the lighted arrow-slit in the
side wall, corresponding to the two strips of light in front.</p>

<p>The pair of them crossed over the grass-grown causeway. At its
inner end, a score yards or so distant from the front of the
keep, were the moss-grown remains of an outer fortification that
had once housed the drawbridge windlass, in all probability.
Silently, so faced that they commanded both the entrance to the
keep and the causeway, the two lay down and began their watch,
side by side in a niche of the ruined wall, which, here, rose
little more than a foot from the ground level, and so afforded
concealment for their bodies but still gave them full range of
view, both toward the causeway and the main entrance to the keep.
From the clock in Odder church tower eleven strokes sounded to
them faintly, not long after they had lain down with guns
ready.</p>

<p>A long age went by. The night-breeze moaned eerily over and
about the two watchers, and once it seemed to Gees that he heard
faint voices in it, high up, as if someone were speaking and some
other answering at the very top of the old keep&mdash;or even as
if the sounds came from the air itself, and they who spoke
floated independently of any support. It may have been fancy, he
knew, but he heard Tom Cotton beside him breathe sharply,
suddenly, as if he too heard or fancied the sounds. Then came a
faint click at which both tensed to full watchfulness. Gees saw
the doorway as an oblong of faint light that did not ray outward,
and then saw McCoul's tall figure emerge and stand outlined
against the light. A minute or less passed, and Gyda appeared
beside her father, who stood out from the light and became a mere
shadow against the wall as he made way for her.</p>

<p>"He will not come, now," they heard her say.</p>

<p>"No," McCoul's voice answered. "I could have told you that an
hour ago. And if he had, he would have brought Green with
him."</p>

<p>Gyda laughed, the tinkling laugh that reminded Gees of metal
tapping on glass. He could see the shining whiteness of her head
in the faint light from the doorway, and all the line of her
slender figure.</p>

<p>"You might have entertained him," she said.</p>

<p>"Pah!" McCoul exclaimed impatiently. "But he will not come
tonight, your Philip. It is far too late, now."</p>

<p>"Father!" Gees heard, and knew it was no imagining of his, a
sudden eagerness in her voice as she spoke the word.</p>

<p>"No," McCoul said, as if it were a forbidding. "Not
tonight."</p>

<p>He returned through the doorway. A minute or more the girl
stood before it, and then she followed him, and the door was
closed. Not only closed, for Gees heard the sharp clack of bolts
being shot into their sockets. He recollected them, one at the
top and one at the bottom of the door, heavy iron bolts, level
with equally heavy hinges.</p>

<p>Watching, he saw a third arrow-slit illuminated in the wall,
some twenty feet or more above the first two, and decided that
either McCoul or Gyda had gone up from the ground floor&mdash;it
was unlikely that Shaun Ammon was responsible for the light, at
this late hour. Midnight struck from Odder church tower, and,
minutes later, the two lower lines of light in the wall of the
keep vanished, and a second slit above became illuminated. The
McCouls were going to bed, apparently.</p>

<p>First one, and then the other, of this second pair of lights
was extinguished after another long interval. Then, with a touch
on Cotton's shoulder, Gees rose to his feet, and Tom rose
too.</p>

<p>Together they went round to where Gees had posted the two
police officers, and Gees signaled to them to get up. The four
went single file back to the lane, and, out beyond the monoliths,
Gees spoke.</p>

<p>"Over for tonight," he said, keeping his voice down almost to
a whisper. "It may mean many nights of watching, Inspector."</p>

<p>"I'll risk a few more," Feather answered, "if the weather
keeps as it is now. Though, to tell the truth, I'm not in love
with it. With your idea, I mean. You seem pretty sure, I
know."</p>

<p>"Five hundred pounds sure, as I told you," Gees said.
"Meanwhile, where do I find you to-morrow, to make any necessary
arrangements?"</p>

<p>"The inquest will be at the <i>George</i> at three o'clock,
and I shall be there. Moore is putting up Rapkin for the night,
and I'm staying at the <i>George</i>. What about these
guns&mdash;are you taking them?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you'd better take charge of all four of them, if you
will. I've something else in my pocket&mdash;and a police permit
to carry it."</p>

<p>They separated, Cotton and Gees going toward
Dowlandsbar,&mdash;Cotton had arranged to lodge with the Neverns,
as Cottrill had done before him&mdash;and the two police officers
taking the opposite direction. Late though it was after Gees had
parted from Cotton, he found the front door of Dowlandsbar
unlocked and Tyrrell seated before the fire in the hall. Tyrrell
looked round at him rather unamiably as he entered.</p>

<p>"Had a good evening?" he asked. "What's that on your
coat?"</p>

<p>Gees looked down. The front of the coat was green stained from
pressing against the ruins of the gatehouse at Locksborough.</p>

<p>"It's as dark as a stack of black cats, and I bumped against
something," he answered. "It'll brush off&mdash;looks like that
stuff that you get on old dead branches, which is what it is,
probably. Yes, I had quite a good time, thanks, and now"&mdash;he
yawned behind his hand&mdash;"I think a spot of ear-pounding is
indicated. You didn't sit up for me, did you? I mean, I'm sorry
if I kept you up."</p>

<p>"Not in the least," Tyrrell assured him, more cordially. "If
I'd felt like going to bed, I'd have gone."</p>

<p>"Well"&mdash;Gees turned toward the staircase&mdash;"I feel
like going to bed, and I'm going. Good night, mine host."</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER  XIII. &mdash; A SURVEY</h2>

<p class="first">LOW-HANGING clouds were chasing swiftly across
the sky when Gees looked out from his window the next morning:
there had been a little rain in the night, as the state of the
drive in front of the house showed, but now it had ceased, though
still, from the direction in which the clouds were driving, the
wind was in the south-west&mdash;the rainy quarter. As he shaved
Gees queried whether the police inspector would consent to a
night's watching in the rain: to his practical, unimaginative
mind, the vigil they had already kept and its lack of any result
was evidence of the slenderness of their chance of saving him
from resigning, and with him, as with Tyrrell, Gees was and knew
himself at a disadvantage in that he could not tell of what he
believed. If he did anything of the sort, Tyrrell would turn him
out of the house instantly, and Inspector Feather would decline
to have anything more to do with him: he had to keep his plans
and his belief as well from Tyrrell's knowledge, and make use of
Feather and his sergeant without disclosing the actual nature of
that use.</p>

<p>By the time he and Tyrrell had finished breakfast&mdash;a
silent meal, for Tyrrell seemed very depressed&mdash;the sun had
begun to break through the clouds, and when, with a cigarette
apiece, they went out to the front of the house, shadow and
sunlight were chasing each other across the grassy slopes between
them and the square tower of Locksborough. For a little while
Tyrrell stood gazing at the old keep.</p>

<p>"I want to go and see&mdash;see Gyda," he said, with an odd
kind of constraint for such a remark. "Would you care to walk
over with me?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, if you don't think I should be in the way,"
Gees answered. "Now, or have you things to do before you
start?"</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;or practically now," Tyrrell said. "I've been round
my men, and had a talk with Cotton&mdash;told him he can fold the
sheep tonight if he prefers to do so, but is not to stop out on
watch over them&mdash;before you came down. It's not too early to
go&mdash; there." He nodded toward the castle and made half a
question of the statement.</p>

<p>"No, I should think not," Gees agreed, but rather
dubiously.</p>

<p>"Gees"&mdash;Tyrrell faced him with the air of a man who
drives himself to put the question&mdash;"what do you think of
her&mdash;Gyda?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, I've seen practically nothing of her," Gees
answered, rather embarrassed by the question. "Very
unusual&mdash;unusually attractive, I mean. Not a bit ordinary.
But my opinion doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"I had an impression that you disliked her," Tyrrell said.</p>

<p>"I? My dear chap, why on earth should I dislike her? I know
what it is, you're all strung up over yesterday's
tragedy&mdash;and you were badly strung up before it happened,
too. You're imagining all sorts of things, with no foundation
whatever. A very charming girl, and very attractive, in her own
way. And I can't say fairer than that."</p>

<p>"You don't sound&mdash;oh, I don't know what it is!" Tyrrell
exclaimed impatiently. "But you see, all Odder's cold-shouldering
them, her and her father, because Amber must go and poke his nose
into something that was not his concern, and McCoul very rightly
put him in his place over it. The result is the same as if McCoul
had been in the wrong&mdash;Amber's been here thirty years, more
or less, and nobody must go against him. McCoul is a stranger,
and they take years to accept strangers, here. I know, when I
marry Gyda, I've got to fight the whole crowd of them to get
recognition for her, to get her accepted as belonging here."</p>

<p>"Umm'm! Is it worth while?" Gees asked incautiously.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;do you mean is <i>she</i> worth while?" Tyrrell
demanded sharply, "because, if you do, you're insulting my future
wife, and the sweetest girl, and best, too, I've ever
met&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be so damned silly!" Gees interrupted. "You spoke
of selling out the sheep and getting out from here, and I merely
questioned whether it wouldn't be better to do that than try to
overcome local prejudice, which I know can be a very fearsome
thing. And from what I've seen of this place so far, ranging
yourself in opposition to Amber is like butting your head against
a brick wall. It would be better for you, and better for Gyda
Tyrrell, to start new elsewhere."</p>

<p>"For her, yes, perhaps," Tyrrell said, his transient wrath all
evaporated, "but for me&mdash;the Reformation hadn't begun when a
Tyrrell first lived at Dowlandsbar, and it would be an uprooting,
a hard thing."</p>

<p>"I expect she will make the decision for you," Gees remarked
after a pause. "They generally do, the dear things! You'll be
wax, as usual in such cases, and think you're deciding everything
yourself, too."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall have to sell the flock," Tyrrell said
decidedly. "After this&mdash;Cottrill, I mean&mdash;I'll have no
more men on night watching, even if any of them would do it. I
believe Tom Cotton would, if I'd let him, but I won't. And so,
the sheep must go, worse luck."</p>

<p>"When?" Gees asked after another pause.</p>

<p>"I'll go over to Carlisle and arrange it early next week. It's
a big flock, and I don't want to lose money by being too hasty
over it."</p>

<p>"In other words, you've quite lost faith in me?" Gees
suggested.</p>

<p>"While it was only sheep," Tyrrell answered, "I was prepared
to carry on and give you your chance. Now a man has been killed,
I'm not sure if I have any right to let you take risks over it.
In any case, I won't. Make what inquiries you like, and stay as
long as you like to make them, but at night, the sheep take their
chance. You don't."</p>

<p>"Well, they're your sheep," Gees observed calmly. "But while
I'm here, one thing I want to ask you. Neither with the McCouls,
nor with anyone else, do I wish you to say one word as to what I
am doing or where I spend my time. The fact that I was not here
with you last night, for instance&mdash;I don't want that known,
anywhere. I don't want anything at all known about me. Can you
remember that?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Short of actual lying, I can promise it," Tyrrell
answered. "By the way, that brushwood pile you asked me to have
made. It's down there"&mdash;he gestured toward the stream in the
valley before them, "but you didn't find a use for it last night,
after all."</p>

<p>"I might, before I go," Gees said. "I suppose it'll stay
there?"</p>

<p>"Till it's wanted for another pair of sheep, as it's certain
to be before I can get rid of them. Those things will come
back."</p>

<p>He turned toward the house abruptly. "Let's go," he said. "I
shall have to attend that inquest this afternoon, so it won't be
possible to see her then. And&mdash;you're a good chap, Gees, if
you weren't so infernally secretive over something you've found
out. I know there is something, and you're holding it back from
me. What is it?"</p>

<p>Again he faced about as he put the question. Gees shook his
head.</p>

<p>"I know nothing," he said. "No more than you know, when it
comes down to stark facts. My conclusions may be wrong&mdash;I've
seen no more than you've seen, and as for what actually killed
your sheep and their shepherd, frankly, I don't know. So I can't
tell you."</p>

<p>"Sell out here&mdash;it's no use staying&mdash;take her right
away from the place"&mdash;Tyrrell thought aloud. "Come
on&mdash;let's go."</p>

<p>They crossed the causeway in mid-morning, and Gyda came out
from the keep to meet them, her shining, snow-white hair
uncovered, and a smile of welcome in her strange eyes as she gave
both her hands to Tyrrell and spared Gees a momentary nod of
greeting, and no more.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad to see you!" she exclaimed. "This terrible
news about the shepherd, Philip&mdash;is it really true he was
killed?"</p>

<p>"Quite," Tyrrell answered, still holding her hands. "The
inquest is to be this afternoon, so I came over this morning to
see you. I shall have to attend it, so&mdash;well, here I
am."</p>

<p>"How did you hear of Cottrill's death, Miss McCoul?" Gees
asked.</p>

<p>"Why, Shaun told me," she answered, and, withdrawing her hands
from Tyrrell's, gazed full at him. "Shaun&mdash;our cook and
general servant. The boy from the store brought up some goods for
us this morning, and he told Shaun, who couldn't keep a thing
like that to himself. Philip, how terrible for you! What will you
do about it?"</p>

<p>"Sell the sheep, dear," Tyrrell answered. "I wanted to talk to
you about it&mdash;about a good many things. Later, of
course."</p>

<p>McCoul came out and joined them, coatless, and with his shirt-
sleeves rolled up from his skinny, sinewy arms. Seen thus, he
appeared leaner and taller than ever, and nodded down at both his
visitors.</p>

<p>"Morning, gentlemen," he said. "I've been sawing logs as a
means of exercise&mdash;our fireplaces eat up a good deal of
wood, and I make it one of my amusements. Philip, I see you're
occupied. Mr. Green, can I offer you anything? Some mid-morning
refreshment, now?"</p>

<p>"Too early, thanks," Gees answered. The man was altogether too
effusive, he felt, though, possibly, he wanted to leave Tyrrell
and his daughter alone, and chose this way of doing it.</p>

<p>"Well, come and tell me what you're doing about this latest
tragedy," he suggested. "Something will have to be done now, of
course."</p>

<p>"It becomes a police affair," Gees answered, and saw Gyda,
with her hand on Tyrrell's arm, begin to draw him apart. "When
human life is in danger, amateurs like myself must walk
carefully."</p>

<p>"Ah! Yes!" McCoul nodded gravely. "Human life&mdash;yes.
Then"&mdash;he began to walk toward the entrance, and Gees
followed, leaving the other two to themselves&mdash;"you mean you
withdraw altogether?"</p>

<p>"I shall not stay here much longer," Gees answered evasively.
"I like Tyrrell, and he's not anxious for me to go for a day or
two."</p>

<p>"No, poor fellow," McCoul assented. "Glad of a congenial
spirit to divert his thoughts. Yes. I wonder&mdash;would you care
to see over the castle, Mr. Green? That is, the keep&mdash;the
rest of it, as you can see, is nothing but grassgrown bits of
wall. I conclude it was easier to take stone from here than to
quarry it for more modern dwellings."</p>

<p>"I'd very much like to see over it," Gees answered. He glanced
behind him, and saw Tyrrell and Gyda crossing the causeway to its
outer end. The girl had her hand on Tyrrell's arm, and was gazing
up at him as they walked. McCoul too paused to look back.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're fully occupied in each other, and we shall be
doing them a kindness by effacing ourselves," he said. "Well,
consider me the custodian of this ruin, Mr. Green, and present me
with sixpence if you think my patter deserves it. Observe these
walls, fifteen feet thick at ground level, and twelve at the top.
Built in the days of King Stephen, and today the cement between
the stones is as hard as the stones themselves. Imperishable,
almost, walls like these."</p>

<p>"Most of these structures erected before the Black Death are,"
Gees observed. "They had the secret of enduring cement,
then."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see you are one of the initiate," McCoul said heartily.
"It is so. When the plague fell on England, the master craftsmen
were swept off so suddenly that they had no chance to impart
their secrets to others, and so one may almost date a building by
the quality of its cement. That is, having regard to the nature
of the architecture. You cannot confuse the Norman arch with the
later Gothic, and all this keep is pure Norman, though late. They
built for eternity, not for time. Now see this!" They had reached
the doorway, and McCoul pointed to two deep grooves just within
it. "The portcullis-iron, and with projecting spikes, when it
existed. Above, the slit through which was let down. And in the
thickness of the wall a tiny chamber which contained the
windlass. That chamber is empty now. Iron was valuable in the
early days, and no trace of the mechanism is left. But we will go
up into the chamber, if you wish, and you can see where the
windlass stood."</p>

<p>"I don't think we will, thanks," Gees said, and, meeting
McCoul's gaze, felt that there was a challenge in it. He began to
understand that his host had seized this opportunity of
proving&mdash; what? Looking back before entering the thickness
of the doorway, he saw Tyrrell and Gyda making the outer circuit
of the moat, and now Tyrrell's arm was round the girl's waist:
they walked as lovers walk.</p>

<p>"Then what would you wish to see?" McCoul asked. "There is a
fine view from the top, or there are the old dungeons?"</p>

<p>"Anything you care to show me," Gees answered, emerging from
the thickness of the wall into the long apartment he had already
seen. "I think&mdash;well, what about the view from the top."</p>

<p>"Mr. Green"&mdash;McCoul faced him, and, as once before, Gees
felt and resisted the hypnotic power of the man's eyes&mdash;"I
don't know if you know that the oafs of this village&mdash;and
others who should know better as well as the mere
clods&mdash;attribute to me some part in the things that have
happened this summer. The killing of Mr. Tyrrell's sheep, I mean.
You, I know, came here to investigate these things, and now you
have an opportunity of proving for yourself that there is nothing
in this place, nothing and nobody except myself and my daughter
and our servant Shaun Ammon. The two outside will thank us for
leaving them alone as long as you wish, and I should like to show
you the whole of the place."</p>

<p>"Purely as a matter of interest, if you do," Gees said
calmly.</p>

<p>"Then just as a matter of interest&mdash;unless you tire,"
McCoul suggested&mdash;but Gees knew it was more than that. "This
way&mdash;we will begin at the top and come downwards, if you
will. This staircase"&mdash;he pointed to the opening of the
spiral way in the corner of the room&mdash;"and halfway up to our
first floor you will see the entrance to the passage that leads
to the windlass room in the thickness of the wall. But we will go
all the way up, first&mdash;I will lead the way, if you'll
follow."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly&mdash;it's very good of you to take the
trouble."</p>

<p>He followed to the staircase and began the climb. Round and
round and round he went, passing four exit doorways in
succession, and coming out at last, rather breathless and weary,
to an embrasure at the summit, whence he could see the moss-
grown, crumbling sentrywalk, with its breast-high curtain wall,
running along all four walls of the tower. He looked over the
curtain and saw Odder nestling in its valley to the west&mdash;it
was just visible beyond the intervening ridge&mdash;and,
eastward, Dowlandsbar and the rugged country beyond.</p>

<p>"If it were a clear day," McCoul said beside him, "you might
see Skiddaw, but the distances are too clouded. It is not a long
view, today. And there"&mdash;he pointed down inside the
fabric&mdash;"is our roof. I would not go to the expense of
having it placed here at the top, and so far we have made no use
of the top floor that the roof covers. Nor do I think we shall,
now. Down there"&mdash;again he pointed, this time toward an old
trench beyond the moat in which Tyrrell and Gyda stood
together&mdash;"is something that makes me think I shall have
little more use for this place."</p>

<p>"You would leave them, then?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. They will have no need of me. But there is much to
show you&mdash;little here, except for the strength of the place
this view reveals. All the surrounding heights are beyond
bowshot, and archers here have the advantage of trajectory, you
may observe."</p>

<p>"Had," Gees amended thoughtfully. "Till guns came in."</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;had," McCoul amended. "There&mdash;there, you
see, is the place where they heated the pitch to throw down on
besiegers, but in the last siege wood became so scarce that most
of the pitch was not used, and they had to be content with
toppling stones down. Shall we make the circuit of the walls, or
would you rather go down again?"</p>

<p>"Down, I think," Gees said. There were places where weather-
worn stones sloped dangerously toward the inner side, and in
spite of McCoul's apparent cordiality he felt he would rather not
trust himself along that old-time sentry walk with the man. An
accident would be so easy to contrive, and could never be
questioned, after.</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;as you wish," He entered the stairway again,
and Gees followed. At the first exit to which they came on their
downward way, McCoul stepped out on to a bare flooring of deal
planks, and Gees, coming after him, found himself in an utterly
empty apartment which, under its lofty, plain white ceiling,
seemed vast. It was bounded by the four outer walls, their stones
rough from the chisels of the men who had quarried them, and,
except for the oblong hole leading to the spiral stairway, there
was no visible means of access to it.</p>

<p>"Nothing to show you here," McCoul said, "except that there is
nothing. I wish you to assure yourself of that, Mr. Green."</p>

<p>"It is entirely unnecessary," Gees assured him, looking him
full in the eyes. And, for that once, he had the satisfaction of
seeing McCoul's gaze fall before his own. McCoul turned toward
the stair.</p>

<p>"We will take the next floor, then," he said.</p>

<p>"Supporting a floor across this distance must have been a big
business," Gees suggested. "Even if the supporting beams run from
front to back, considering this as the front, it's a long
span."</p>

<p>"Steel girders, four of them&mdash;Latimer put them up,"
McCoul explained, and Gees realized anew the magnitude of the
contract old Ben had undertaken. "Each floor is the same, and the
cross beams rest on the girders. It is all very solid&mdash;quite
safe. Let us go."</p>

<p>He led down to the next floor. Here they came out to an oak-
walled passage leading from front to back, with one door on the
left as they faced inward, and two on the right. McCoul opened
the left-hand door, and revealed a room sparsely furnished,
occupying the full half of the floor space on this floor: there
was a narrow divan bed against the far wall, with the clothes
thrown back from it in disarray.</p>

<p>"My daughter's room," McCoul stated. "She is rather untidy,
you may observe, even apart from the fact that Ammon has not yet
made the bed or done anything to the room. And no exit but this,
observe."</p>

<p>Irritated at the persistent mockery in the man's voice, Gees
took a couple of steps into the room to look round it, and then
emerged again. McCoul closed that door and opened the one
opposite. "My room," he announced. "Occupying only the front half
of this side, you will note. Behind it is our dining-room, with a
stairway down to Ammon's quarters."</p>

<p>There was nothing in this bare, even poorly furnished
apartment to give Gees pause, and he emerged as McCoul opened the
third door of the corridor and revealed a fairly well-appointed
dining-room, oak-furnished with leather upholstery, and its walls
tapestry-hung. McCoul crossed it and drew aside a tapestry
curtain to reveal a stout door, fitted with a bolt which he shot
into its socket before turning to face Gees.</p>

<p>"There," he remarked, with a note of satisfaction. "That is
Ammon's only communicating way with all I have shown you, and now
he is barred out until he comes round by the front and unbolts
this door. And, as you see, these three rooms are all of this
floor."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," Gees answered quietly. "And the walls, you say,
are fifteen feet thick, so if I chose to doubt that you are
showing me everything&mdash;well, you can get a lot into fifteen
feet, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Why the insinuation, Mr. Green?" McCoul asked coldly.</p>

<p>"Because you're not earning the custodian's sixpence," Gees
answered with a smile. "You're suspecting me of suspecting you,
apparently."</p>

<p>"Coincidence&mdash;my arrival here coinciding with the
beginning of this outbreak of sheep-worrying&mdash;has caused me
to be suspect," McCoul said. "I wish to convince one
man&mdash;and one who has interested himself in the affair on Mr.
Tyrrell's behalf, at that&mdash;that there is no possibility of
my being connected with it. That is why I am endeavoring to show
you everything, and to make you realize you miss nothing that
there is within these walls. That is why I barred Ammon out till
you have seen him, prevented him from coming out from his own
room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, Mr. McCoul," Gees interrupted. "Do you think that
I suspect you of keeping here two such hounds&mdash;if they are
hounds,&mdash;as have killed over fifty sheep and a man on
Dowlandsbar lands?"</p>

<p>McCoul smiled. "I merely wish to prove to you&mdash;to one
man, as I said, and a reasonable man at that&mdash;that I do
not," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then lead on," Gees invited. "We'll miss out the windlass
room, though, and go down. The dungeons ought to be interesting,
if it's possible to see them. I know the ground floor room, of
course. Oh, by the way, there's a postern door at the corner of
the wall in front. Does that lead into the big front room
downstairs?"</p>

<p>"No," McCoul answered. "It gives access to a passage in the
thickness of the wall, leading straight through to Ammon's
quarters&mdash;into the kitchen, in fact. But he rarely uses it,
since it is badly lighted and the floor is not in very good
condition."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, the dungeons, eh?"</p>

<p>Down on the ground floor, McCoul raised two sections of board,
and, getting his fingers under the edge of a stone slab, lifted
it up on end, revealing a stone staircase that went down into
black darkness. The effortless way in which he raised the massive
thing proved that he had strength far beyond the ordinary, and
there was no sign of undue strain about him as, flicking the dust
from his hands, he took up a big electric torch which lay on a
table beside the fireplace. He clicked the light on, and,
pointing the torch at Gees, momentarily dazzled him.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid this is all the light here, unless we go round and
get candles from Shaun," he observed. "But if I go first, this
will give light enough to show you everything. Bare cells, and a
torture chamber which you may find rather interesting. The rack
is still there."</p>

<p>He entered the stair, and Gees, with yellow spots still
wavering before his eyes after the beam of the torch had struck
on them, followed his lead. A half-score of damp stone steps took
them down to a passage-way of equally damp earth, with a slimy
stone wall to either side, and in each wall were
doorways&mdash;the doors had rotted, long since, and only traces
of them remained. Each doorway gave access to a cell, some so
small that a man could neither stand upright or lie at length in
them, others somewhat larger. McCoul flicked off the torch, and
the darkness, in spite of the aperture behind at the top of the
stair, was so intense as to seem tangible. He flicked it on
again, and moved forward, sending a ray into each doorway as they
passed, and waiting while Gees looked in before going on to the
next earth-floored, terrible prison.</p>

<p>"There was no light, as you see," he said. "The things done
down here would not bear light. There is air, from some crevice
that I have not found. Sometimes the prisoners were meant to
live."</p>

<p>"Darkness like that is death itself," Gees observed. "No man
could live in it for long&mdash;days only, I should think."</p>

<p>"Their nerves were tuned differently," McCoul said.
"Hence&mdash; this!"</p>

<p>They had come to the end of the passage, Gees saw, and now
stood in the entrance to a large, low-ceiled chamber which, as
nearly as the torchlight declared it, was circular in shape. At
the far side the ray revealed a rotted wooden structure, enough
of which remained to show that it was, as McCoul had said, a
rack, on which many a man had shrieked in torment, if Amber's
tale of the de Boisgeants were true. A rusted brazier, and a
little pile of moldering implements beside it, came next into the
light as McCoul swung it round, and then he advanced to the
centre of the chamber, where was a raised, coffin-shaped
stone.</p>

<p>"A unique survival, I think," he said, throwing the light on
it. "I have never seen another. Observe, Mr. Green, those sunken
channels would fit arms and legs, and there is a depression into
which the head would lie. Iron clamps&mdash;here are the holes
for them&mdash;would hold the patient down at the knees and waist
and neck and forearms, while the surgeons at the brazier yonder
operated on him&mdash;or her, as the case might be. And here, and
here&mdash;these channels for the blood to run off into vessels.
See how the stone is blackened with it, to this day."</p>

<p>"I think I've seen enough," Gees said.</p>

<p>But McCoul swept the light round the slimy stone walls,
revealing pairs of rusty manacles high up, so that one in them
must hang by his wrists; fetters pendent from the ceiling, for
hanging victims head downward while, as he observed, the brazier
was placed under them, and other hellish devices which he
explained until Gees felt sick with the horror of it. Then,
turning, as if by accident he sent the ray of the torch full into
Gees' eyes again, temporarily blinding him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said calmly, "their nerves were tuned differently.
Shall we go back? I think except for a cell or two we may have
missed, I have shown you all there is underground here."</p>

<p>He went back to the passage between the cells, but halted
before one doorway and threw the light across to its far wall,
high up.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;yes, this must be the one," he said. "A rough
sort of carving on the stone, if you care to examine it before
going up."</p>

<p>Still dazzled by the light, Gees took one unthinking step
forward&mdash;but then, almost beyond the edge of the light, he
caught a whitish glimmer as of lead or some such metal, and flung
out a hand to grip the edge of the doorway as he felt McCoul's
hand on his back. He could have sworn that McCoul had tried to
push him forward, though the pressure was only momentary, and the
instant that his hand went out to grasp the wall, it ceased,
while McCoul gripped his coat and pulled him back.</p>

<p>"My God, the wrong one!" he exclaimed, and there might have
been fear for his guest in his voice, or the rage of
disappointment. "If you'd taken another step&mdash;thank heaven I
realized in time!"</p>

<p>He dropped the ray of the torch and revealed a stonewalled,
circular hole occupying nearly all the area, and going down to
blackness. And the glimmer of metal that Gees had seen was a
leaden pipe. It was the well, he realized, from which Shaun Ammon
pumped water into the tank beside his door at the back of the
keep, and if he had fallen down there and McCoul had gone up the
stairs and replaced their covering&mdash;or even if he had gone
to get help&mdash;there would have been little chance of anything
but a corpse coming out of that doorway. And McCoul had tried to
push him in: he felt utterly certain of it.</p>

<p>"Well, all's well that ends well," McCoul said awkwardly.</p>

<p>"That well very nearly ended me," Gees retorted, and felt
inclined to add&mdash;"or you did," but refrained. "I won't
bother about any carvings on the stones, thank you all the
same."</p>

<p>"Just as you please," McCoul said coolly. "And in that case,
we will go up again. Except for Shaun Ammon's quarters, you have
seen all there is of the keep, now&mdash;as I wished you
should."</p>

<p>"We won't bother about Ammon's quarters, either, thanks," Gees
said. "I expect Tyrrell will be wondering what has become of
me."</p>

<p>If McCoul could have had his way, he knew now, Tyrrell would
have had far more cause for wonder.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER  XIV. &mdash; IMPLICATIONS</h2>

<p class="first">BACK in the big ground-floor apartment although
the Aladdin lamp had not been lighted and the arrow slits
afforded no more than a dimness, Gees felt grateful for the light
after the blackness of the dungeons. Tyrrell and Gyda had
returned from their communings outside the walls, and now the
girl sat on the settee before the fireplace, while Tyrrell,
standing before her, appeared as almost a different man: the
strained look had gone from his face altogether, and, Gees
thought with a twinge of pity for him, he seemed as happy as a
bridegroom.</p>

<p>"Father, do put on your coat!" Gyda exclaimed as McCoul turned
from replacing the stone he had up-ended to descend into the
dungeons. "I wonder you didn't think of it before. What must Mr.
Green think of you?"</p>

<p>McCoul advanced and took up the coat, which lay across the
back of the settee. "It would only have got stained, down there,"
he said, and rolled down his shirt sleeves to put it on.</p>

<p>"You look as if you'd been seeing ghosts, Gees," Tyrrell
accused.</p>

<p>Gees glanced at himself in a long mirror on the wall beside
the fireplace, and saw good ground for the remark: the color had
not yet come back to his face after his experience on the edge of
the well. Then he looked at his hands, and saw them soiled with a
greenish slime from the walls that he had gripped to save
himself.</p>

<p>"No, not ghosts," he said, and held up his hands. "I
wonder"&mdash;he turned to McCoul&mdash;"would it be possible to
get rid of this?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," McCoul answered. "Up the stair, in the
passage leading to the windlass room&mdash;I had better show
you."</p>

<p>Again he led the way up, and turned in at the first exit from
the spiraling way. Gees found himself in a narrow, dark tunnel in
the wall, in which he could scarcely stand upright. By the light
of his torch McCoul revealed a hole in the side of this passage
and opened a door of modern, unpainted deal, and there was a
bathroom about ten feet by six, lighted by an arrow slit in the
outer thickness of the mighty wall. A cheap-looking enameled
bath, a towel rail, a plywood wall cabinet, a basin with taps
beside the bath, and a plain Windsor chair, were all its
furnishings. McCoul paused in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Soap and towel&mdash;there is a clean one, I see," he said.
"Shall I stay, or will you find your own way down?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can manage, thanks," Gees answered. "But you have water
laid on to this height? An unexpected luxury."</p>

<p>"Rain water, collected from the roof into a tank higher up,"
McCoul explained. "If that should fail, there is it pump to force
up a supply. You will find a clothes brush in the cupboard
there."</p>

<p>Taking off his coat to wash, Gees found that he had need of
the brush&mdash;and of more than that, for the stains from the
dungeon walls remained on his sleeves after he had done his best
to get rid of them. He came out from the bathroom and closed the
door, and, save for the very faint semblance of light at the
entrance to the stairway, stood in absolute blackness. A match
guided him back&mdash;he had no mind to explore in the direction
of the windlass chamber&mdash;and he returned to the ground
floor, to find the other three standing before the fireplace.</p>

<p>"I hear Mr. McCoul just saved you from a very nasty accident,"
Tyrrell observed as Gees joined them.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "Just. How deep is that well, Mr.
McCoul?"</p>

<p>"Sixty feet, to the water level," McCoul said.</p>

<p>"Then it would have been a very nasty accident," Gees
commented, and again, looking McCoul full in the eyes, saw him
avert his gaze.</p>

<p>"Are you staying here much longer, Mr. Green?" Gyda asked.</p>

<p>"I shall have to get back next week," he answered, "to
investigate a case which looks"&mdash;again he glanced at
McCoul&mdash; "like attempted murder. Almost impossible to prove,
though, from what I know of it."</p>

<p>He saw the strained look reappear momentarily on Tyrrell's
face, but, as if she read her lover's thoughts, Gyda clasped his
hand as he stood beside her, and the expression passed.</p>

<p>"Mr. McCoul," Tyrrell said, "I'd like you and Gyda to dine
with me again tonight, if you will. She has already
consented."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, thank you very much," McCoul answered slowly, after
a brief pause in which his brows contracted and then relaxed.</p>

<p>Gees thought hard for an excuse&mdash;he did not want to be a
member of the party, and he had to find some reason for absence,
quickly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I shall not be able to be with you, Tyrrell," he
said. "When I rang my secretary yesterday, I asked her to send me
some rather important papers to Carlisle, and I thought of
turning out the car and going over for them after the inquest. I
may be very late back."</p>

<p>"Umph!" Tyrrell looked rather disconcerted. "Well, I'm sorry.
But why Carlisle&mdash;why didn't you have them sent to
Dowlandsbar?"</p>

<p>"Because I had an idea I might have left
Dowlandsbar&mdash;finished all I came to do here. And I must have
those papers&mdash;they're urgent."</p>

<p>"This is the first I've heard of them," Tyrrell said, with
frigid skepticism. "Bearing on your attempted murder case,
perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Indirectly," Gees answered. "You're thinking of the problem
of getting back here after dinner and returning alone, of
course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I know!" Tyrrell's expression lightened. "I'll turn
out my car, Gyda, and drive you and your father back here."</p>

<p>"There is no need," McCoul said. "I have not the slightest
fear of walking back with Gyda. An escort is quite
unnecessary."</p>

<p>"What do you say, Gyda?" Tyrrell asked, and pressed her hand.
"Are we to say good night at Dowlandsbar, or here?"</p>

<p>She gave him a smile. "It is for you to say," she answered.
"Then that's settled," he said happily. "Go and get your old
documents, Gees, and I'll expect you back when I see you.
Midnight, eh?"</p>

<p>"I'd better stay for dinner in Carlisle," Gees said
reflectively. "Since I'm not sure what time I shall be back, I
mean&mdash;and that would make it midnight or thereabouts. Or I
might even put up there for the night, instead of risking the
drive along your lane in the dark. If so, I could ring through
and tell you I'm not returning till morning."</p>

<p>"Just as you like." Tyrrell appeared to have forgotten his
skepticism, perhaps in anticipation of driving Gyda back and
managing an interval alone with her, at which, obviously, McCoul
would willingly connive. "You do as you like, and I'll expect you
and your father about seven, Gyda. We can tell him all we've been
talking about, then."</p>

<p>"In that case, my absence will be a boon," Gees observed
drily.</p>

<p>The glance Gyda gave him was assurance that she would consider
it in that light. Tyrrell took her arm and moved forward from the
fireplace.</p>

<p>"Time to be going," he said. "It's much later than I
thought."</p>

<p>He went out with her, and Gees and McCoul followed. They
emerged to the sunlight of full day, brilliant after the gloom
within the keep.</p>

<p>"I shall be sorry to miss seeing you and Miss McCoul tonight,"
Gees observed to McCoul. "And very many thanks for showing me
round. You proved an admirable cicerone, once you'd got over
suspecting me of suspecting you. Your explanation of the methods
of torture in the old days, for instance. You must have studied
that subject pretty thoroughly."</p>

<p>"In the course of a long life, one learns much," McCoul
answered.</p>

<p>"True in your case," Gees remarked thoughtfully. He nodded at
the hump of grass-grown ruin before them: beyond it, Gyda and
Tyrrell had already crossed the causeway, and were going on
toward the monoliths. "That will be where the drawbridge was
managed, I suppose?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," McCoul said. "It was a tower in the outer wall, with an
arch slotted for the portcullis and the mechanism for both
portcullis and drawbridge in a chamber over the arch. Only
starvation&mdash;" He broke off abruptly, with the air of one who
had already said too much.</p>

<p>"Then de Vere's men didn't succeed in breaking a way through
the outer wall, even?" Gees suggested coolly.</p>

<p>"Breaking&mdash;" McCoul almost gasped, evidently caught off
his guard for the moment. Then he recovered himself. "I am afraid
I have not looked up the history of the place sufficiently to
tell you what happened in the final siege, Mr. Green," he said
coldly.</p>

<p>"No? Well, many thanks for all you have told and shown me,"
Gees remarked. "And now I'd better chase after
Tyrrell&mdash;after lunch, rather, for obviously Tyrrell is
interested in only one person, for the present. Good-bye, Mr.
McCoul&mdash;I hope we shall meet again."</p>

<p>And he hurried off, but slackened his pace after he had
crossed the causeway. Tyrrell and Gyda had already emerged to the
lane and turned toward Dowlandsbar, and, for the moment, Gees did
not want to overtake them. Quite apart from their absorption in
each other, he had plenty to think over, in addition to the fact
that McCoul had attempted to push him into the well under the
keep. For he knew that for a fact.</p>

<p>Up at the summit of the tower, McCoul had spoken as if the
old-time strength of the place were a thing of today. "Archers
here <i>have</i> the advantage of trajectory," he had said, and
had acknowledged the slip when Gees had pointed it out. Then, in
the torture chamber, he had described the nature and uses of the
various implements with the certainty and detail of one who had
actually witnessed their use. And, just now, he had spoken of the
gate-house tower in a way that only one who knew it could have
spoken&mdash;or had he a vivid imagination that he called to use
in answering Gees' question? This last was a possibility.</p>

<p>From beyond a bend in the lane, where, Gees decided, she had
paused for a last embrace with Tyrrell, Gyda appeared, and as she
faced him Gees saw that she looked radiant with happiness, as
might any girl who had just parted from her lover for only a few
hours.</p>

<p>"So kind of you to linger, Mr. Green," she greeted him, "and
very kind of you to give Philip and me so much time to
ourselves."</p>

<p>"But I found your father so very interesting&mdash;almost
overpoweringly so, in fact," he answered&mdash;and knew that, if
he had not grasped at the sides of the cell in time, McCoul would
have overpowered him.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she said. "Do forgive me for neglecting you,
though. I do hope we shall see you again before you go."</p>

<p>"I hope so, too&mdash;and now I must hurry after Tyrrell."</p>

<p>They went their ways. Before he rounded the bend in the lane
Gees looked back and saw the slender, almost perfect grace of the
girl's receding figure, and her silvery little head held
high&mdash; she went as one quite happy, quite carefree. Then he
went on, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Tyrrell waited for him in the gateway of Dowlandsbar, and he
too looked quite happy, and laughed a little as he saw Gees'
expression.</p>

<p>"Not all the cares of the world, surely?" he queried. "Though
you look as if you were carrying a few of them. What's on your
mind?"</p>

<p>"Gunpowder," Gees said, "hadn't come into use in the time of
Henry the Third. That was what I was thinking at the moment."</p>

<p>"Oh, your inspection of the keep, eh?" Tyrrell suggested.</p>

<p>"And de Vere found it too tough a nut to crack," Gees pursued,
"but badly provisioned&mdash;short of firewood, too. So he sat
down and starved it out. And bagged and hanged the lot, bar
two."</p>

<p>"You've been hearing about it, eh? Well, I'll forgive you your
desertion for dinner tonight, in return for the way you left Gyda
to me this morning. Has McCoul been telling you about the
siege?"</p>

<p>"No, Amber told me that," Gees answered.</p>

<p>Tyrrell made no response, and, Gees noted, he stiffened and
increased his pace at mention of the vicar's name. They entered
the house, and Tyrrell took up a parcel, inspected the address on
it, and held it out. "For you," he said, in an altered,
constrained way.</p>

<p>Gees took the parcel, tore one end of the wrapping, and saw
the edges of two bulky books. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Eve Madeleine has come up to scratch, as usual, bless her,"
he remarked. "The morning's post, evidently&mdash;but I don't
want them, now."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">After lunch, Gees got out the Rolls-Bentley and, stopping in
front of the house, waited while Tyrrell got in beside him. Then
he drove on until they were just about to cross the narrow stone
bridge before taking the ascent to Locksborough gateway, and
there stopped.</p>

<p>"Trouble of any sort?" Tyrrell inquired.</p>

<p>"No. I was just taking a look at that pile you made for
me."</p>

<p>He gazed over the fence beside the lane at a breast-high heap
of mingled logs and brushwood, with, beside it, an array of two-
gallon cans of paraffin surmounted by an ordinary galvanized iron
pail. Then, as he gazed ahead again, and let the car move slowly
on, he laughed.</p>

<p>"You must be out of civilization, here," he remarked. "To
stand a dozen cans beside an ordinary road, even as far from it
as they are, would be equivalent to giving them away to
somebody."</p>

<p>"Savagery," said Tyrrell acidly, "evidently has its
advantages."</p>

<p>He had relapsed from the mood to which Gyda had won him
earlier in the day, and now was broodingly quiet, oppressed by
the prospect of the inquiry into the causes of Cottrill's death.
Gees of necessity kept his eyes on the way before him: they
bumped past the standing stones and, reaching the crest of the
ridge beyond Locksborough, dropped down into Odder, where Gees
drew up in front of the <i>Royal George</i>. Until he saw the
assembly that the forthcoming inquest had drawn together there,
he would not have believed that the district was so populous.
When Tyrrell got out from the car, half-a-dozen or more gaitered
and tweed-coated farmers came forward to greet him, and not far
short of fifty working-class men eyed the car and its driver
curiously. For such a place, it was a crowd, but there were no
women in it, and no children. Possibly the men had decided that
this was no fit scene for their wives and families, for, Gees
reflected, the women would hardly have stayed away of their own
accord.</p>

<p>He saw the vicar, who raised a hand to him in friendly
greeting from where he stood talking with an aged villager, but
made no move to approach. Feather and Sergeant Rapkin stood apart
from all the rest, and, while Tyrrell talked with his farmer
acquaintances, Gees approached the two police officers, and
nodded in response to Feather's salute.</p>

<p>"You are prepared to carry on tonight, I hope?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I said I'd carry on," the inspector answered, rather
irritably.</p>

<p>"That's good," Gees commented, and smiled. He understood that
the inspector, like Tyrrell, was apprehensive over the
forthcoming inquiry, and thus decidedly on edge. "Make it the
same meeting place at nine forty-five, and I've decided to make a
slight change. I'll have you with me, Inspector, and Cotton and
the sergeant can pair at the back."</p>

<p>"You're taking charge," Feather replied, as if to say that
Gees could do what he liked&mdash;also, that whatever he did,
Feather himself had little faith in the result. So it sounded to
Gees.</p>

<p>"Quite so," he answered. "And that," as a small saloon car
came through the village toward them, "will be the coroner, I
expect."</p>

<p>"It is so&mdash;see you tonight, nine forty-five," Feather
said, and moved to meet the official, Rapkin accompanying him.
Gees went back to Tyrrell, and they entered the <i>George</i>,
ascending to a big first-floor room which had been prepared for
the inquest, and into which as many as could crowded as audience
to the proceedings.</p>

<p>It proved a brief affair. An uncle of Cottrill deposed to
having identified the body, and then Tom Cotton described how he
and Weelum had discovered it in Valgersby Cleft. The doctor gave
his evidence as to the cause of death, and then Tyrrell was
called and taken through a <i>resumé</i> of the sheep-killings of
the past six months, ending his story with the sudden and
unexpected fog that had driven over the land, with Cottrill out
in it somewhere. He made it clear, and the coroner expressed
entire agreement with him, that it would have been useless and
perhaps dangerous to others to attempt to find Cottrill in the
fog.</p>

<p>Lastly, Inspector Feather took the oath, and stated that he
and his men had made every effort to find the dogs responsible
for the sheep-worrying, and had failed utterly, as he had to
admit. He bore patiently with the coroner's bitter sarcasm over
his inefficiency, and declared that he had done all that man
could do, and must abide this result. After he had been
dismissed, the coroner addressed the seven men who had been
empanelled as a jury, and who had accepted the evidence without
question or comment. They had all known the dead man, and knew
Tyrrell, too.</p>

<p>"Sheep-worrying by dogs that have become subject to that form
of mania, in sheep-farming districts, is a rather rare thing," he
said, "but it is a well-known trouble, all the same. As a rule,
the dogs responsible for the damage are either caught or shot
after only one instance of the worrying, or two at most. Here we
have a police inspector declaring that he has checked up and
examined every dog licensed or exempted to its owner over a very
large area indeed, and that he has been unable to find the
offending dog or dogs, though he has had six months and more in
which to do it, since the first case was reported to him by Mr.
Tyrrell. There is, you must note, a certain strange uniformity
about these cases, so far as the sheep are concerned. In place of
indiscriminate worrying of several sheep, two are killed on each
occasion, and, further to that, they are all the property of one
owner. It would almost seem as if there were human direction
behind these dogs, except that it is impossible to conceive human
beings capable of such senseless destruction. However that may
be, a human life has been lost now, and unquestionably that life
was taken by the animals which destroyed the sheep. Of this there
can be no doubt whatever. The terrible state in which the body of
the unfortunate man was found, and the fact that it had been
drained of blood as had the sheep, points to an identical agency.
It appears, from what the witness Cotton has told us, that
Cottrill cornered these beasts in Valgersby Cleft, and they
turned on him and overpowered him. Possibly, as Cotton suggests,
he cornered one, and the other attacked him from behind. You can
regard his death only as a matter of accident&mdash;there is no
other possibility.</p>

<p>"With regard to what caused that accident, and to its being
abroad and capable of doing damage six months and more after the
first case of worrying had been reported by the owner of the
sheep, I can only say that the full report of this inquiry will
be forwarded to the proper quarter, and, if there is blame
attaching anywhere"&mdash;here he gazed hard at Inspector
Feather&mdash; "that blame will be duly apportioned and will
receive its just recognition. It is no concern of this inquiry.
Now, gentlemen, you may retire to consider your verdict, or, if
you find that unnecessary, deliver it here and now."</p>

<p>He had pointed them to the verdict so plainly that they had no
need to retire, and after a minute or two of headshaking,
nodding, and whispering, the one they had appointed foreman gave
it, and the solitary local reporter in attendance scrawled
"Accidental Death" on his notes and went off to write the
necessary paragraph and head it&mdash;"Shepherd's Tragic Death."
Outside, Gees waited until Tyrrell appeared.</p>

<p>"You'll forgive me for not driving you back?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" Tyrrell answered cordially. "Thank heaven,
that's over! I felt sure he was going to blame me for not going
out to find Cottrill, as soon as the fog came down with him out
in it."</p>

<p>"Man, he wouldn't be such a fool!" Gees remonstrated.</p>

<p>"Well, he wasn't, but they take queer views, at times, though
Cottrill has been out in fogs dozens of times before. Now you
want to get off to Carlisle&mdash;yes. I'm sorry you won't be
with us tonight&mdash;selfishly sorry, for it would have given me
a better chance to get Gyda to myself. But there it is. Come back
when you feel like it, tonight or in the morning, just as you
like. I'll get off back, now."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and Gees knew, as well as if the
intent had been spoken, that Tyrrell would stop by the gateway to
Locksborough in the hope that Gyda would be visible. Gazing at
his retreating figure, Gees questioned what to do with the time
between now and a quarter to ten. He might run over to Carlisle,
of course, and return in plenty of time to meet Feather, but it
seemed an aimless sort of excursion. Then he sighted Tom Cotton
emerging from the inn, and beckoned to him.</p>

<p>"The private room here, Tom, at a quarter to ten tonight," he
said when Tom faced him. "You're willing to make another night of
it?"</p>

<p>"As many as you ask, sir, if it means gettin' 'em," Tom
answered gravely. "Since I'm not keepin' watch over the sheep,
it's no use foldin' 'em, an' as for bein' willing, when I think
of how I found him out there, I'd do anything on earth for a
half-chance to get 'em."</p>

<p>"That's all right, then," Gees said with a faint smile.
"Hullo! Here's Mr. Amber&mdash;how are you, sir? I saw you inside
there."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;call it curiosity, if you like," the vicar said.
"Well, Tom, I understand you are to be shepherd at Dowlandsbar,
now?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, that's so," Tom assented, "but I'd forfeit that an'
a dozen other jobs to have him back, right willingly."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," Amber said gravely. "He was a general
favorite, was Cottrill, and I never heard a word said against
him."</p>

<p>"Tom has spoken his epitaph, sir," Gees put in. "A just one,
too, I think, from the very little I saw of him."</p>

<p>"Yes?" The vicar turned to him. "His epitaph? What was
it?"</p>

<p>"He was never more'n a little man"&mdash;Gees looked at Tom
Cotton and quoted his own words to him&mdash;"but he had a heart
of gold."</p>

<p>"It might justly be his epitaph," Amber commented.
"Yes&mdash;but you didn't go back with Mr. Tyrrell, Mr. Green.
You're not leaving us yet, surely?" He glanced at the Rolls-
Bentley standing a few yards away.</p>

<p>"No-o," Gees said, rather dubiously. He nodded good-bye to
Cotton, about to move away, and then an idea suddenly occurred to
him. "Is Miss Amber anywhere about&mdash;I mean, is she
available, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, if you wish to see her," Amber answered. "At
home&mdash;we should be glad to give you tea, if you care to come
in."</p>

<p>"Thanks all the same, but that wasn't my idea," Gees said. "I
wonder&mdash;would you mind if I took her out to
tea&mdash;Carlisle, or somewhere of the sort? Just for the
run&mdash;I've hours to waste, somehow."</p>

<p>"You'd better come in and ask her," Amber suggested. "She'll
be delighted, I expect&mdash;she gets out so little, poor
girl!"</p>

<p>Leaving the car standing, Gees accompanied him to the
vicarage, and the girl he sought opened the door to them.</p>

<p>"I saw you over the churchyard wall," she said, "and you've
come for tea, haven't you, Mr. Green? Do say you have!"</p>

<p>"It's Gees, and I haven't," he answered. "I've got your
father's permission to ask you, and the car here
ready&mdash;would you like to run over to Carlisle with me for
tea&mdash;or anywhere else you like?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Green, you don't mean it!" she exclaimed, her eyes
shining with sudden excitement.</p>

<p>"But I do," he insisted, smiling at her. "What abaht it,
now?"</p>

<p>"Just that you're a perfect dear&mdash;isn't he, daddy? I
won't be one second getting a coat and hat."</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. &mdash; CARLISLE INTERLUDECARLISLE INTERLUDE</h2>

<p class="first">"GREGORY GEORGE GORDON GREEN, four of 'em-Gees,"
the owner of the name explained patiently as the crazy signpost
at the entrance to the lane appeared. "Don't blame me. Pity me,
if you feel like it."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure&mdash;no," Madge said. "It isn't you.
Not&mdash;not big enough. I'd like to think of you as something
else. Something"&mdash; she broke off, at a loss for a
word&mdash;"something more heroic."</p>

<p>"Heaven save us!" he ejaculated, and swung the long bonnet of
the car southward, away from the signpost. "If you want real
heroics, my old man always calls me Gordon, but I warn you I
shall weep if you start it. Why couldn't my godfathers and
godmothers have thought of Eric, or little by little, or grail
for Galahad, or even Augustus? There's a nice mellow flavour
about Augustus, when you come to think of it."</p>

<p>"George!" she said. "It is your name, too. Yes, plain
George."</p>

<p>"Hellish plain," he remarked, and, being on a straight
stretch, put down the accelerator. "Rub it in all you
like&mdash;I'll keep cheerful."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you know I didn't mean that!" she expostulated. "Ooo-
h! Are we going to Carlisle, or Southampton? The country's
whizzing."</p>

<p>"Do you feel unhappy about it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Do you know what the young lady in Venice wrote to her
friend?" she asked in reply.</p>

<p>"I'll buy it," he offered&mdash;and, glancing at the
speedometer, saw the pointer at seventy. "She
shouldn't&mdash;never put compromising things on paper. But what
did the young lady in Venice write to her friend?"</p>

<p>"I am sitting on the bank of the Grand Canal, drinking it all
in, and life has never seemed so full before," Madge quoted.
"Oh!"</p>

<p>He had only swerved for a slight bend, and the car held the
road perfectly. The girl relaxed her hold on the door strap, and
sat at her ease as Gees drove down another straight stretch at
seventy-five.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she finished it&mdash;the Grand Canal, I mean,"
Gees said.</p>

<p>"But you should have laughed," she complained. "The dead cats
and things&mdash;Daddy took us for a holiday in Venice, five
years ago, and if only you'd seen the Grand Canal! But, Mr.
Green&mdash;Gees&mdash; George&mdash;why did you bring me out
like this? Why me? I'm loving every moment of it, and I want to
know why? In a car like this."</p>

<p>"Because, for one thing, it's the only car I've got," he
answered, and slowed for a series of irritating bends. "For
another&mdash;why you, you said&mdash;you're an antidote. I'm not
swearing at you, mind. I suddenly felt I wanted a spot of sanity,
and I thought of you. Someone human and sweet, someone as fresh
from God's hand as these hills, and as pure as the air that blows
over them. That's why. Now sit quiet."</p>

<p>There rose before them a hill, a gradient of one in four, or
even less, as he knew from having descended it on his way to
Dowlandsbar. He opened out to take it, and, quietly, the long car
rose to its task, the bonnet humping up before them as if it
sought the sky. And ever the engine purred quietly, evenly, until
they came to a summit and began to drop down to the valley
beyond. Madge touched Gees' arm.</p>

<p>"I'm so proud," she said. "You think that of me?"</p>

<p>"I've a lot to tell you before we go back," he answered. "Not
yet. We'll find a quiet table somewhere for tea, and then talk,
eh?"</p>

<p>"George, you're a genius for fitting the scene to the
occasion."</p>

<p>"Well, if it's got to be George, George it is," he said. "Now
we must turn left, for Carlisle. If we're to go to Carlisle, that
is."</p>

<p>"I don't care where we go," she declared. "You're in
charge."</p>

<p>At that, he had a momentary thought of Inspector Feather, but
put it aside. He wanted absolute freedom from the thought of
Cottrill's death and what had caused it, for the time.</p>

<p>"Madge, we're going to talk seriously over tea, I warn you,"
he said, after making the sharp left turn toward Carlisle. "That
turn was less than a right angle, by the way&mdash;horrible
Elisha ought to be told about it. But I want you to consider me
as a father-confessor, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but you're much too young!" she interrupted. "Brother-
confessor, say, and I'll try and bear it. My sins are many,
though."</p>

<p>"I'll go easy on penances," he promised.</p>

<p>"Thank you, George. But be careful how you drive, just here.
Cows walk out of gateways suddenly at this time of day, here and
hereabouts. It's afternoon milking time, and a cow is a valuable
animal."</p>

<p>"So is this car. Then you know this road well?</p>

<p>"I used&mdash;" she began, and then broke off and sat silent.
Gees felt that he knew what she had been about to say, and the
reason for her failing to complete the admission. And, glancing
at her, he saw that her color had heightened, and she gazed
straight ahead.</p>

<p>"Used to come this way often," he said, "up to, say, six
months ago."</p>

<p>"Yes," she assented deliberately, "but Philip&mdash;Mr.
Tyrrell&mdash;had no right to talk about me to you, or to tell
you he used&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has told me nothing," he interrupted. "He's never
mentioned your name or referred to you, apart from once asking
whether you had spoken of him, after I'd lunched at the vicarage
and seen you home."</p>

<p>"Then you shouldn't make deductions," she said. "It wasn't
because of me that you came here&mdash;to Dowlandsbar. And even
if it means excommunication, I'm not going to
confess&mdash;anything. Why should I, to you?"</p>

<p>"You're far short of being excommunicated, as yet," he
answered. "I keep on forgetting that we're strangers, really, and
I ought not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're not strangers!" she broke in, energetically. "I could
repeat all the old platitudes, and all they amount to is that I
feel as much at home with you as with my own father, able to talk
to you as I can to him. But about&mdash;about what you hinted
just now, I won't talk to anyone. It's finished, forgotten,
buried beyond resurrection."</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said, as if he doubted the statement. "And since
you make that declaration, we'll talk about other things. For one
thing, now, I don't know this village, so you'll have to direct
me to the best place for tea. Hotel for preference&mdash;I don't
like tea shops."</p>

<p>Under her guidance he drove into the old city, and, ten
minutes later, faced her across a table while she glanced at her
wrist watch.</p>

<p>"Fifty minutes," she observed. "Why, they'll only just be
having tea at home! Do you know, George, I yearned for a ride in
your car, even before you came to lunch with us. And here I
am!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but why the yearn?" he queried. "No&mdash;you order what
we're going to have for tea"&mdash;for a waiter stood over
them&mdash;"and remember I've got a large appetite, owing to the
air in this district."</p>

<p>She gave the order, and the waiter went to execute it. "We all
eat more largely here than you do in London," she remarked. "A
north-country tea would frighten the average Londoner, from the
size of theirs."</p>

<p>"I want to know more about this yearn," he reminded her.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, Weelum&mdash;the man at Dowlandsbar, that is&mdash;told
Annie, and Annie told our Jenny, all about this wonderful car,
and I felt if I could travel in one like it&mdash;just as we've
traveled today&mdash;I wanted to run away from Odder, or rather
be carried away, like this. In luxury, not having to plan it
myself&mdash;and it's come true, and I'm happy."</p>

<p>"But you've got to go back," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"I'm quite content to go back&mdash;it isn't that, at all. The
mere change, sight of fresh things, sense of movement. And most
of all, escape if only for an hour or two from the oppression
that hangs over Odder, and has hung over it all this summer.
Something&mdash;something not of earth, brooding and waiting
always, even in daylight. Fear."</p>

<p>"You have felt it all this summer?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded, waited till the waiter had gone, and then poured
the tea. "Many of us have felt it," she said. "Daddy has, I know,
and men in the village&mdash;Tom Cotton and a friend of his who
saw the things&mdash;Jack Baldwin, his name is&mdash;for others.
It is there, all the time."</p>

<p>"The Shee," he suggested. He saw a way of getting round to the
main purpose for which he had brought her out, a roundabout way,
but still a possibility. But she shook her head at the
suggestion.</p>

<p>"No. Most decidedly, no. Another name for them is 'Men of
Peace,' and what has happened at Dowlandsbar this
summer&mdash;and especially the last thing, Cottrill's death,
would drive them away."</p>

<p>He nodded a grave assent. "I want to propound a theory," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes?" She looked her interest. "About&mdash;your talk with
daddy?"</p>

<p>"What he told me," he assented. "And yet&mdash;no, we won't
begin on that. This way&mdash;it's an adaptation of a theory put
forward in a play I saw some time ago, one of those plays that go
outside material, normally possible things. Supposing you could
stand at a great height&mdash;on some hill, say, and look down on
a road winding past&mdash;see miles of the road, and see clearly
all that was on it? People far back along the road, people
directly under you, and others far forward&mdash;and assume that
all the traffic on the road is going in one direction?"</p>

<p>"A one-way road&mdash;yes," she assented. "And I see it
all."</p>

<p>"Not all, but a very long stretch of it. Now say that you have
come up to the top of the hill from a long way back on the road,
and are at liberty to go down again to any point on it you
choose?"</p>

<p>"Any point I choose&mdash;yes," she assented again.</p>

<p>"Now say that the road is time," he went on. "Up on your
height, you are out of time. You have come up there from far
back, and you go down again to the nearest point&mdash;down to
today. And you are exactly as you were when you came up from the
far back point&mdash;from long ago."</p>

<p>"Uninfluenced, not aged by time, you mean?" she
questioned.</p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;I see you get it. Beings on whom time has no
visible influence, though they are not immortal. They are merely
independent of time, in a different state from ours. On another
plane, say."</p>

<p>"A higher plane?" she questioned again, earnestly. "A lower, I
think," he answered. "Like the Shee."</p>

<p>"Elementals&mdash;earth-bound," she suggested after a
thoughtful pause.</p>

<p>"More like&mdash;leave them for the minute, though, since you
understand what I have been trying to explain. And I'll have that
other scone, since you've gone on to cakes. Now&mdash;I suppose
you know the story your father told me, of the final siege of
Locksborough?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I felt that Locksborough was coming into it," she
said.</p>

<p>"And before the siege, how members of that family dabbled in
black magic, kidnapped children, and all the rest of it&mdash;you
know that?"</p>

<p>"I know it all," she answered. "I've read all daddy's copy of
Mancius, and he and I have discussed the story, often."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, Diarmid de Boisgeant, who was not found when the
rest of that race and their followers were exterminated by de
Vere and his besiegers&mdash;Diarmid was a descendant of de
Boisgeants who had dabbled in black magic and so owned the devil
as their lord, and he was also a descendant of the Shee, the
fairy folk. Is this rank nonsense to you, or do you keep an open
mind about these things, like your father?"</p>

<p>"I go further," she said soberly. "Yes, I see. Diarmid de
Boisgeant went back up to the height from that time, being so
much of the Shee by birth that he was independent of time, as you
put it. And came down into life again&mdash;yes. I think my
father believes that, but he won't say it. Only&mdash;you know
how he went to see McCoul, about Ben?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When McCoul told him to mind his own business."</p>

<p>"And it was his business&mdash;daddy was trying to save Mrs.
Latimer's life. Ben couldn't keep from her what it would mean to
them if McCoul didn't pay, and the mental worry of it killed her,
even more than her illness. But daddy came back that day simply
white with rage, and he told me something that he has never told
anyone else. When he was almost a boy&mdash;it was while he was
at Balliol&mdash; he went on a long vacation to the west of
Ireland, to Galway. And one day he met a man and a girl riding
along a road on ponies. The man was McCoul&mdash;daddy is sure of
it, he says&mdash;and the girl was McCoul's daughter, looking
exactly as they look now. And that was nearly forty years ago.
You see?"</p>

<p>"If he's right, McCoul should be in his grave, and Gyda an old
woman," Gees commented thoughtfully. "That is, if they were in
time as we are. And quite possibly McCoul's hostility is due to
recognition."</p>

<p>She smiled. "If you'd seen a photograph of daddy as he was
then, you wouldn't say that," she said. "He was a handsome youth,
then."</p>

<p>"Well, we're getting on," Gees observed, "and since that was
the last scone, I'll turn on to cake too. Also, more tea, please.
Now the next point. When the solution of the sheep-killings and
Cottrill's death is reached, at the very least McCoul and his
daughter will be implicated. I'm as sure of that as I am that
Cumberland air gives me a whale of an appetite. You see what that
means?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and I see what the appetite means," she answered.
"Shall I ring and ask the waiter to bring some more cakes?"</p>

<p>"Don't frighten him&mdash;this will stay me till dinner time.
It means that&mdash;I've been long enough with Tyrrell to see
that he's infatuated with Gyda McCoul. I daren't say a word of
what I believe to him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am no longer interested," she broke in. "Please don't."</p>

<p>"But I must," he persisted. "Note the word I used infatuated.
Naturally&mdash;grant, as I believe you will, that Gyda McCoul is
a being out of time, possessed of something different from human
attraction, and you'll see that in his present state Tyrrell is
not himself. Under a spell, if you choose to call it that. She
wanted him, and she's got him, for this present. And that is why
I want you to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please!" she broke in again. "You don't understand,
altogether. I'll tell you&mdash;yes, I will confess to you, now.
Philip and I and Peter Bandon, and sometimes Harold, did
everything together till Peter married, and then it was Philip
and Harold and I&mdash;we were all much younger than Peter, and
Harold was youngest of us all. Philip grew into my life till I
knew I loved him, and knew too that he loved me. Placidly,
say&mdash;we were so utterly sure of each other. It was all
understood, settled&mdash;until last March, when the McCouls
finally came to live at Locksborough. Then, all that had been was
finished. No more drives to Carlisle with him, no more seeing him
coming up the path to the vicarage&mdash;Oh, I'm confessing
everything!&mdash;no more looking forward to the time when I
should leave the vicarage for Dowlandsbar. A bitter month or two,
and then it all died and left me cold. Now, if there were no man
but Philip Tyrrell left on earth, I'd turn my back on him."</p>

<p>"That is, as he is now," Gees urged. "But think forward, think
of him needing some influence, someone to whom he can turn,
after&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He must not think to turn to me" she interrupted. "I can pity
him then, but no more. No." She smiled at him. "No, George,
nothing he could say or do would ever bring it back to life.
Impossible."</p>

<p>There are shades in negation, but, he knew this of hers as
final, absolute, for to-morrow as for today. Again she smiled at
him.</p>

<p>"You've tried your best" she said, "and I don't like you less
for it. Give me absolution, and let's talk of something else,
shall we?"</p>

<p>"Anything. You suggest the subject, and I'll jabber."</p>

<p>"Or gibber," she amended, and laughed. "I know, though. What
time is it now&mdash;what time must you be back at
Dowlandsbar?"</p>

<p>"The time now is five-fifty. I want to get back to Odder not
later than nine-thirty, and to Dowlandsbar to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"That means&mdash;Oh, what does it mean, George? Odder goes to
sleep by ten o'clock, or at least when the men from your royal
namesake get thrown out. Odder nine-thirty&mdash;you can't stay
out all night, there."</p>

<p>"Say I must be back by nine-thirty, and leave it at that," he
suggested. "What happens after is yet to be seen, if
anything."</p>

<p>She gave him a long look. "I wouldn't be me if I were not
curious about it," she said, "but&mdash;say six o'clock, by the
time we get out. Now be guided by me. Thursby, Wigton, Abbey
Town, Calvo, and Skinburness. In this car of yours, you can do it
and get me back home in time for dinner. I'll tell you the roads,
from Skinburness to our lane."</p>

<p>"All of which means what?" he asked, and signed to the waiter
to bring a bill. "It sounded perilously like bad language, as you
said it."</p>

<p>"I'm incapable of anything of the sort," she retorted. "It
means a sight of the sea, and at sunset, too. And then&mdash;you
said you wanted to be back by nine-thirty&mdash;it means you'll
come to dinner with us, and still have plenty of time. It is
being a good day, George."</p>

<p>He paid the bill, and went out with her to the car. They took
the road to the south-west, and Madge snuggled down
luxuriously.</p>

<p>"Thursby, George&mdash;do you realize it? Thor's place. And
Valgersby, the place of the Valkyrs, Odin's maidens who chose the
slain. And Brownhill Scar&mdash;Brynhild's Scaur. All the country
reeks with old legend, if you examine its names. Norse,
Danish&mdash;Thorfinn Thorfinnsson fought his last fight
somewhere near Valgersby, daddy says, and died gloriously while
his men wiped out the Picts and saved Locksborough&mdash;but it
hadn't been named Loki's Barrow then, until he was buried there.
He was a little, dark man, rather like Cottrill, but a bad
man."</p>

<p>"How do you know what he was like?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;I must have been about twelve, and it was a
school holiday. I went up to Locksborough one day in a hot
August, and went to sleep behind the long barrow, and I saw him
in a dream. Bandy-legged, with a winged helmet, and a little dark
man with a beak of a nose and a hard face. Just saw him,
and&mdash;I'd never sleep near the long barrow again, although he
didn't seem to see me. Locksborough was empty, then. Nobody
thought it would ever be lived in. Loki, the god of evil."</p>

<p>Gees made no reply. They went through Wigton, and Madge warned
him in time for the turn on to the road to Abbey Town.</p>

<p>"Then Calvo, and then the sea," she said. "You're not George
at all. You're a god out of old time, carrying me to where I want
to be, to sight and smell of the sea at sunset&mdash;and the
whole of this is a dream, because one's wishes don't come true in
real life. The unexpectedness of it. I shall go back home and
live it all over again."</p>

<p>She looked up at him, and saw his eyes directed to the road
ahead.</p>

<p>"Impersonal, quite," she said. "Don't think I'm asking you to
feel any of it. I'm just&mdash;happy, somehow. You're not in it,
personally. You're just&mdash;don't be offended&mdash;you're just
the agent of my happiness. Yes&mdash;no, right, quick! That other
road goes to Silloth. Yes, just the agent, but a god all the
same. Bragi, perhaps. George, why the devil did you come to
Odder? I'm going to miss you badly&mdash;not you, but all you're
giving me&mdash;when you go away again. Remember, I'm a parson's
daughter, and they're worse than the majority. Else, I wouldn't
be talking like this. Why give me all this?"</p>

<p>"To try to make you realize what Tyrrell will need, at the
end," he answered. "Whether I bring about that end, or it just
happens."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no, hard left! There! Now stop. If we stay ten
minutes, we can still get home in time for dinner. Now don't
speak, yet."</p>

<p>They sat up over the quiet sea, its little, uncapped waves
rolling lazily in under the south-west breeze, and there was a
path of golden light that led to a far coast and the height of
Criffel dim in the west. The last of the sunset was about them,
and the breeze lapped over them, bringing the tang of salt water,
chill and heartening.</p>

<p>"What he will need," she said very thoughtfully. "Yes. But had
he any thought for me in my great need? We people of the
north&mdash;I am of the north, George&mdash;we feel very deeply,
if we feel at all. There was a time, a little time, when I wished
to die, and it was nothing to him. A bitterness, and there was no
comfort anywhere, for I knew he was hungering for that strange
beauty&mdash;unearthly beauty that even then I knew was not
altogether good. Gyda McCoul&mdash;or Lynette de Boisgeant?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure," Gees said. "No, I am not sure."</p>

<p>"No. There are other things at Locksborough. The very old
dead, and Thorfinn's people, and the men and women who did
sacrifice in a circle of the standing stones&mdash;the two in the
gateway are part of the circle. Sacrifice to strange
gods&mdash;and now Philip Tyrrell has gone away after strange
gods. He may come back, but not to me. So all this, your taking
me out and making me feel so very happy for a little while, is
quite useless. All my love for Philip Tyrrell is quite dead."</p>

<p>"Well, that doesn't mean our excursion has been useless," he
said.</p>

<p>"No?" she gazed up at him. "Then where is the use?"</p>

<p>"Making you feel so very happy," he answered, and smiled at
her. "'Sun, moon and stars, brother, all good things. There is
also a wind on the heath.' Take Petulengro's wisdom to yourself,
my dear, and go on being happy. I'm very glad I thought to ask
you to come out."</p>

<p>"Oh, brother mine, you've got big hands and a big heart!" she
said. "Daddy was right&mdash;you are one of us, and I'm happier
still, now."</p>

<p>Gees laughed quietly. "I have also big feet," he observed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but I couldn't catalogue everything. You're all
big. Now one last look, and a bit of a verse you won't
know&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">'One swelling tide of ocean, darkly green.<br>
One sunlit path, that meets the dying day&mdash;<br>
One step between.'</p>
<br>

<p>And not long ago, I wanted to take that step, but not now.
It's time to go back, and you're to stay for dinner since you're
free till nine-thirty and not going back to Dowlandsbar, and I
haven't talked so much since Angus Maconochie's pig walked to
Inverness on stilts. You've got to turn round somehow, and I'll
give you the turns to take us back to Odder as we come to them.
Let's go, please, or we'll be late."</p>

<p>Driving on a little way, he found a gateway which gave him
room to turn the car, and they went back. The girl sat quite
silent except for directing him at need, and at last the crazy
signpost pointing to Odder and Dowlandsbar showed: to Gees it
seemed an age since he had first stopped and backed to follow the
guiding of that post.</p>

<p>But, short of the signpost, where a half-dozen firs grouped
beside the road, he pulled in and stopped with two wheels off the
metalling. Madge looked up at him questioningly.</p>

<p>"I shall need headlights along the lane," he explained, "and
after we get out of the first dip, they'll be visible from the
top of Locksborough keep, for a little while. What time do you
have dinner?"</p>

<p>"It's a movable festival, like Easter," she answered, "later
at some times than others, with half-past seven as the average.
But what will happen when your lights are visible at
Locksborough?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, if they're not visible too soon," he answered. The
McCouls, he knew, were due for dinner at Dowlandsbar at seven,
but he would take no risks of being seen returning. "I am still
in Carlisle, dining there, and not due back here till midnight.
And it's hardly likely that another car would be coming along
here at this time."</p>

<p>"It's all rather puzzling," she said dubiously.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it's all quite clear, now," he dissented.
"Somehow this run out with you has made everything plain, filled
in the gaps in my theory&mdash;all but one, that is."</p>

<p>"May I know the theory?" she asked after a pause.</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," he answered thoughtfully. "The gap
is&mdash; what are the things that have done these killings? What
are they using to bring Tyrrell to the point where he will
finally decide to go?"</p>

<p>"Decide to go?" she echoed, in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>"This is how I see it, now," he said. "First,
though&mdash;when did it occur to you that Tyrrell was in love
with Gyda McCoul?"</p>

<p>"She came here with her father very early in the year," she
answered, "before the alterations were completed for them to come
to live here in the castle. The change in him began then&mdash;I
knew then."</p>

<p>"And in that case, Gyda McCoul knew too&mdash;meant to get
him."</p>

<p>"It may have been so. I know he changed from that time, to
me."</p>

<p>"Yes. They didn't come here because of Tyrrell, but for a
different purpose altogether. Then Gyda saw him, and he became
their second purpose, but she doesn't mean him to stay here at
Dowlandsbar, doesn't intend that they shall live there after
marriage. As far as their object in being at Locksborough is
concerned, they have already achieved it. Remains only to make
sure of Tyrrell, and for Gyda to go with him, quite away from
here, where she and her father are ostracized."</p>

<p>"But he wouldn't leave Dowlandsbar, surely?" she
protested.</p>

<p>"He has already talked of it to me," Gees assured her. "He has
made up his mind to sell the flock, realizing now that he can't
ask Tom Cotton or anyone else to take the risk of guarding it.
And Dowlandsbar is primarily a sheep farm. She means him to leave
it altogether."</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;you mean they instigated these killings, to make
him feel that the place&mdash;his home&mdash;is altogether
useless to him?"</p>

<p>"Just that. And McCoul is a master of old magic&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if they didn't come here because of Tyrrell, why did they
come at all? What was the different purpose you spoke of just
now?"</p>

<p>"You saw a part of it, in London," he answered. "The diamond
crescent and ruby&mdash;pendant, wasn't it? McCoul was too poor
to pay Ben Latimer at first, and then&mdash;remember, neither de
Vere when he took the castle, nor anyone since his day, ever
discovered the priory plunder and all else that the de Boisgeants
collected in their day."</p>

<p>"And you think-?" she asked after another thoughtful
pause.</p>

<p>"Well, isn't it clear? That hoard was hidden so securely that
only those who knew the hiding place, saw it put away, could find
it. By buying Locksborough, McCoul ensured undisturbed ownership
of all that was there, and the law of treasure-trove doesn't
apply until someone beside himself knows for certainty that he
has unearthed the de Boisgeant hoard. How many times have they
been away since they came here?"</p>

<p>"Twice. They went away in June, and then I saw her as I told
you, when we were in London not long ago. Yes, I see. He took
things to sell&mdash;jewels, parts of what he found.
And&mdash;the beasts?"</p>

<p>"Brought to being somehow," Gees said doubtfully. "Things with
a blood lust, tangible things, not ghosts. I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off and sat silent, thinking of how McCoul had shown
him over the keep&mdash;but what other chambers were set in the
thickness of the mighty walls? What, besides the range of cells
and that terrible room beyond them, was there of hiding place
under the fabric?</p>

<p>Madge clutched at his arm, and he looked down at her.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Please take me home," she begged. "I want the comfort of four
walls round me, and not&mdash;it's growing eerie, and I don't
know what the shadows hide. Please! It's been such a happy time,
but&mdash; "</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, and roused the engine to life.
"Twenty past seven now&mdash;I'll put the car round at the back
of the vicarage, and you'll be in time for your movable
feast."</p>

<p>But he looked down at her upturned face, and did not
start.</p>

<p>"Madge?" he asked.</p>

<p>She put both arms round his neck. "You dear! Oh, you dear!"
she said, and gave him her lips.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;it doesn't spoil your day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Completes it&mdash;crowns it." She released herself from his
hold and settled herself close beside him. "And now&mdash;home,
George."</p>

<p>He drove on and turned into the lane.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER  XVI. &mdash; DINNER FOR THREE</h2>

<p class="first">GYDA MCCOUL put down her coffee cup and rose to
her feet, and at her movement Tyrrell too stood up, and turned to
open the dining-room door for her. But before he could move
toward it she spoke.</p>

<p>"No-please, Philip. I don't want to leave you&mdash;only to
come and sit with you while you finish your coffee. Do sit
down."</p>

<p>Clad, as when she had dined at Dowlandsbar before, in
shimmering grey, she was a ghostly, indistinct figure outside the
range of the candlelight from the table as she came past her
father toward Tyrrell's chair. McCoul, so leaned back that his
face was in shadow, stirred his coffee absently, and Tyrrell
seated himself again as Gyda perched herself on the arm of his
carving chair, and then laid her arm across his shoulders. He
looked up at the touch, and smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Not too comfortable, is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Close to you, my dear," she answered caressingly.</p>

<p>"I see you expect to lose more sheep," McCoul, still stirring
his coffee, observed. "More than two, next time, it seems."</p>

<p>"Why, what makes you think so?" Tyrrell asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Merely the bonfire laid where the others have been," McCoul
answered. "This one is so much bigger&mdash;big enough for
roasting an ox."</p>

<p>"Ah, that!" Tyrrell said, with a note of relief in his voice
as he realized that McCoul had seen no more definite portents.
"As a matter of fact, Gees&mdash;Green, that is&mdash;asked me to
have that pile laid. I don't know exactly what he expects, unless
it is that he hopes to catch those infernal beasts and burn them
as we burned all the sheep."</p>

<p>"Then he is still hopeful of catching them?" McCoul asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Tyrrell answered slowly, remembering that Gees
had asked for silence regarding his plans. "But after Cottrill's
death, he can hardly interfere with police work. I believe he
thinks of going back to London early next week, which looks as
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if he had given it up," McCoul suggested in the pause.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," Tyrrell admitted. "If it hadn't been for this
idea of his, spending the evening in Carlisle, he might have told
you what he thinks about the situation, and what he intends to
do. I'm not sure."</p>

<p>"And what do you intend to do?" McCoul asked. "This cannot go
on. The police have proved themselves quite ineffective&mdash;it
cannot go on."</p>

<p>"No," Tyrrell agreed. "Gyda and I were talking of it this
morning, while you were showing Green over the castle. I shall
make arrangements next week to sell the flock, which means, of
course, the end of living here for me. A big wrench,
but&mdash;you'll be pleased, won't you, Gyda?"</p>

<p>"It is as you said this morning," she answered. "The sheep are
the life of the place, and if they cannot be kept here, it
dies."</p>

<p>"True." Tyrrell voiced the confirmation rather gloomily. "It's
a most amazing thing, an impossible thing in these modern days,
and yet there it is. Somebody will discover the cause, put an end
to these horrible things, sooner or later, and then sheep can be
run on these fells again. But I give it up&mdash;Cottrill's death
ends it, for me, and I've told the man who took his place to keep
to his home dark."</p>

<p>"Yes," McCoul said gravely, and drank his coffee. He put the
cup down on the table. "Until the dogs are found, the sheep must
go."</p>

<p>"And I'll risk no other man's life over finding them," Tyrrell
said. "If they are dogs&mdash;and to me they seemed like
something worse, something fiendish and awful. I told Gyda this
morning how they nearly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, don't recall it, darling!" she interposed, and laid her
hand momentarily across his lips. "Say that it is all
over&mdash;or next week, when the sheep are gone, it will be all
over. And in a little time&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not end it, but bent to drop a light kiss on his
forehead as he looked up at her. His face cleared as he met her
gaze.</p>

<p>"She told me of that," McCoul said coolly. "And you gained an
impression that they were not ordinary dogs, you say?"</p>

<p>He waited. Gyda, sitting erect again, appeared as if she too
waited for Tyrrell's reply, which was long in coming.</p>

<p>"They were four-legged, I know," Tyrrell said at last, "and
grey&mdash;one paler than the other. And&mdash;dogs? Well, I felt
that they came from the kennels of hell. Think of the cunning of
them, too. Until then, never once had they come near the sheep
except when the flock was unwatched. Holding off as long as there
was a guard, and instantly it was taken off, another killing!
Like&mdash; like human intelligence."</p>

<p>"But ordinary dogs might scent human beings and keep away,"
McCoul urged. An outsider, had there been one, might have thought
he was leading Tyrrell on to commit himself definitely to some
course of action. "Perhaps you are a little&mdash;well, strung up
over this, Philip."</p>

<p>"To this extent," Tyrrell said with decision. "The flock goes,
and Dowlandsbar goes&mdash;to whoever will have the nerve to buy
the place. I know these are no ordinary dogs&mdash;say I'm
superstitious, say I'm running away from the trouble, if you
like, but since Green has failed to discover them&mdash;and his
going off to Carlisle like this is proof that he's given it up
and is interesting himself in other things&mdash;since he has
failed and the police are utterly useless, I give
up&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>"Not alone, Philip," Gyda said, very softly.</p>

<p>"My compensation," he said, and drew her hand round to his
lips to kiss it. "I don't know&mdash;do you think of staying on
at Locksborough, sir? I mean, after Gyda and I are married and
gone?"</p>

<p>"I should not stay on in any case," McCoul answered. "The
place is too gloomy, and fully modernizing it is out of the
question."</p>

<p>"Not worth while," Tyrrell agreed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Also, the prejudice of the people of this place&mdash;I could
never overcome it," McCoul added. "That man Amber&mdash;they
follow him. And the fact that I have dared to live in such a
place as Locksborough&mdash;your people here are full of
superstition, Philip."</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and stood beyond the candlelight, a
tall indistinctness in the gloom. Only his eyes showed, and to
Tyrrell it seemed that some vagrant ray from the candles must
have rested on them, for he could see them plainly, luminous
pools of darkness. Then McCoul turned toward the door, averting
his face from Tyrrell.</p>

<p>"You two will not need me for awhile," he said.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but we can't leave you alone?" Tyrrell urged,
halfheartedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." McCoul's voice was softly satiric. "There is a good
fire in the hall, I know, and you have much to say to each other.
Consider that your friend is here with us, and I am talking to
him."</p>

<p>He went out, closing the door on himself very quietly. By the
fireplace in the big entrance hall, Annie the maid had just
placed a tray containing decanter, siphon, and glasses, on the
occasional table that stood there, and, turning and catching
sight of McCoul's tall figure advancing, she started and then
crossed herself as she turned away.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that, girl?" McCoul demanded, keeping his voice
low, but with an angry, almost growling note in the question.</p>

<p>She turned again to face him, fearful, yet defiant.</p>

<p>"You're not my master," she said, "an' heaven forbid that you
ever should be! An' I don't answer to you for what I do."</p>

<p>Then she faced about and went out hurriedly by the door
leading to the servants' quarters. McCoul gazed after her for a
few moments, and then went to stand gazing into the log fire.</p>

<p>In the room he had left, Gyda moved from her seat on the arm
of Tyrrell's chair and dropped down on his knees, reclining
against him. He pressed her head against his shoulder, kissed her
passionately.</p>

<p>"Soon, darling," he said. "It must be soon."</p>

<p>She leaned back in his clasp to look at him. Her eyes were all
amber, then, her gaze intense, and he had an instant's half-
consciousness that somewhere, at some time, just such eyes had
gazed at him before. In some other state, it must have
been&mdash;a half-memory out of childhood, perhaps&mdash;and then
the consciousness passed as he heard her voice, whisperingly
soft, the velvet of her lips almost touching his own.</p>

<p>"Quite soon&mdash;dearest, quite soon. But not here, not in
this place. You shall take me away. I can tell you now how glad I
am you have decided not to stay in this place, and my father is
glad too."</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;it's my home, Gyda darling. So many
associations, things of all my life, and the lives of my people
before me. Roots, deep down in me&mdash;I might put some man in
to manage till those things are caught, and then come back here
with you. For they must be caught, sooner or later. And then to
have you here, mistress in my home!"</p>

<p>"Philip, shall I not be your home?" she almost whispered.</p>

<p>Again he kissed her, and for an interval was silent, holding
her close to him. Half-past eight chimed from a clock in the
corner of the room, and Gyda laid her cheek against her lover's,
sighing contentedly.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether Green will get back tonight," Tyrrell
said.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;before we go?" He felt her stiffen slightly in
his clasp, and heard in the question a note almost of
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Why, no&mdash;he said he would not be back till midnight, if
at all," he answered. "Don't you like him, then?"</p>

<p>"He does not like me," she answered evasively.</p>

<p>"Oh, absurd!" Tyrrell protested. "He told me how charming he
thinks you. And why on earth should he dislike you, my
darling?"</p>

<p>"It was my impression. Philip, has he said anything to you of
my father showing him over the castle this morning?"</p>

<p>"Not a word&mdash;he hasn't mentioned it since we came back,"
he assured her. "But why should you think he dislikes
you&mdash;I'm sure he does not. And in any case, he will be gone
in two or three days' time."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;you will take me away, Philip, when I belong to
you?" Her arms tightened about his neck, and the words, almost
whispered, were yet tense with earnestness. "Quite away from this
place?"</p>

<p>"My dear, I have said I would," he answered, puzzled by her
insistence. "Why&mdash;why are you so determined that we should
not stay here?"</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;it is"&mdash;she smiled at him with tremulous
lips&mdash;"just a little fear, Philip. As if there were danger
for me here&mdash;even death, if I stay too long. I know I must
not stay though&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Darling, it's this awful business of Cottrill's death that's
upset you," he interrupted her. "It's cast a gloom over all of
us, and you are over-sensitive. No harm shall come to
you&mdash;why, I love you!"</p>

<p>Minutes later, he laughed softly as he gazed into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Danger!" he exclaimed. "Oh, but you're much too wonderful to
come to any harm, my Gyda! Yes, we'll go quite away&mdash;among
your own people, if you wish. Over in Ireland, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I have no people," she answered. "My father and I are quite
alone. I think we had better join him, Philip. It will soon be
time for us to go, and we cannot leave him alone all the
evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you needn't go yet," he objected, as they stood up
and she patted her disarranged hair. "It isn't even nine
o'clock."</p>

<p>"No?" She smiled at him. "An hour longer, then. If we go and
talk to him for a little while, I think he will find a way of
leaving us to ourselves again before we go. But now you must find
me somewhere to put my hair straight, Philip. You've tumbled it
about so."</p>

<p>"Darling, it's lovely anyhow," he assured her, "but I'll get
Annie to show you"&mdash;he went to the bell-push beside the door
and pressed it&mdash;"and then you can come and join me and your
father in the hall."</p>

<p>Annie, her lips set in a thin line, answered the bell.</p>

<p>"Just take Miss McCoul along to put her hair straight, Annie,"
Tyrrell bade. "And then you'll join us again, dear."</p>

<p>"This way, miss," Annie said, with distaste in her voice.</p>

<p>Tyrrell gazed after her as the two went out, his anger at her
attitude evident in his face. Then he followed out from the room,
and saw the two ascending the staircase. Annie led on to a
bathroom, pushed open the door and switched on the light.</p>

<p>"There," she said. "There's a brush an' comb on the shelf"</p>

<p>"Were you taught to speak to your master's guests like that?"
Gyda demanded sharply, pausing in the doorway of the room.</p>

<p>"I've done what the master told me," Annie retorted
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Girl!" Gyda bent toward her, and before the sudden, fierce
blaze of the amber eyes the girl recoiled, terrified. "You should
be whipped in the courtyard&mdash;"</p>

<p>But then, suddenly, she herself started back and closed the
door between them. Annie stared at its panels, gradually
recovering herself.</p>

<p>"Courtyard?" she whispered. "Courtyard&mdash;what
courtyard?"</p>

<p>She turned away slowly, and made her way to the kitchen, where
Tyrrell's cook sat reading, but looked up at the girl's
entry.</p>

<p>"Cook," Annie broke out, glad of a confidante, "that yellow-
eyed witch said I ought to be whipped in the courtyard, because I
wouldn't bow and scrape to her when the master told me to show
her where she could tidy her hair. Whipped in the courtyard, she
said!"</p>

<p>"Did she?" the cook queried ponderously. "Well, you can't,
because we ain't got no courtyard here, whatever that might be.
And what's more, the day she comes to reign here, I walk out, I
do."</p>

<p>"Me too," Annie agreed fervently. "What's come over the
master, takin' up with her like he's done, is a mystery. That's
what it is, a mystery. Whipped! I've a good mind to tell him an'
give notice first thing to-morrow. I'm not to be talked to like
that by her!"</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">McCoul was not in the entrance hall, Tyrrell found, and the
outer door stood open. He went to look, and found McCoul on the
step.</p>

<p>"Enjoying the night," McCoul explained. "It is not in the
least cold. And you two have settled everything, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Settled? Oh, yes!" Tyrrell answered, a little surprised at
the question. "You mean, about Gyda's wishing to get away from
here?"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," McCoul answered indirectly, "and it
seems to me that when you put Dowlandsbar up for sale, I might
arrange to sell Locksborough, since I have no intention of
continuing there. A buyer of this place would be glad to get the
two hundred acres of good grazing that go with the castle. It
would be a good opportunity."</p>

<p>"That is, if I sell," Tyrrell said. Though, lover-like, he
fell in with Gyda's wishes after little persuasion, it was quite
a different thing when McCoul assumed that Dowlandsbar was
already as good as in the auction market. It seemed to him that
his prospective father-in-law was trying to force his hand, and
he felt a faint resentment.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;what else could you do?" McCoul asked calmly.</p>

<p>"I might put a man in to manage while the place lies
fallow&mdash; until these things are caught and the trouble about
them has died out," Tyrrell answered. "Then Gyda and I could come
back to live here."</p>

<p>"Ye-es." But there was doubt of the suggestion in McCoul's
hesitant response. "But if you form fresh ties elsewhere, what
then?"</p>

<p>"I shall never form such ties as bind me to this place,"
Tyrrell said decidedly. "Generations of my people have lived and
died here, I myself grew up among these people&mdash;" he broke
off abruptly, remembering how, in siding against Amber, he had
isolated himself from nearly everybody in the place. "Dowlandsbar
is home to me," he ended.</p>

<p>Then Gyda came out to them: she may have heard Tyrrell's last
declaration, for she laid her hand on his arm and urged him
forward, into the shadows beyond the doorway, and he saw McCoul
draw back.</p>

<p>"I want you to myself for a little while, Philip," she said
softly. "Not for long&mdash;we must go, soon. Not for long,
father," she added over her shoulder to McCoul, who went back
into the house.</p>

<p>"Yes?" Tyrrell asked her. There was a somber, troubled note in
his voice: it seemed to him then that McCoul was trying to urge
him too far and too fast, and that Gyda, too, failed to
comprehend all that Dowlandsbar meant to him. He went with her
beyond the graveled frontage of the house to the grassy slope
beyond, and there, pausing to face him, she reached up and put
her arms round his neck.</p>

<p>"What is home, but the place where love is?" she asked
tenderly.</p>

<p>"Ah, darling!" he answered. "You're so wonderful! But, Gyda,
now I face the actual fact of leaving here, think of it as a
thing done, I begin to realize all it will mean. I know your
wish&mdash;my dear, it's only that there must be some regret,
some natural regret."</p>

<p>She leaned close to him. "My dear, you are sad tonight," she
said caressingly. "I love you, Philip, yet not even I can make
you happy."</p>

<p>"I should be far less happy if it were not for you," he
answered. "But it came over me&mdash;why my sheep and no
others&mdash;why my shepherd and no other? Why am I singled out
for this fantastic, absurd visitation that nobody seems able to
trace or end? Why should my farm be cursed&mdash;it is no
less&mdash;cursed? I feel it as that, feel that there is no
remedy. Else, I would not think of leaving my home."</p>

<p>"Yet, since it is so," she said, very softly, "you have
decided. My dear, the whole world is before us&mdash;neither of
us is poor, and the whole world is before us. And my love all
yours, Philip, all that I can give&mdash;more than you can dream
till you know me fully, become&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off and laid her lips on his. In a little while he
held her, back from him to gaze at her, and felt himself half-
dazed by the intensity of her passion. Yet there was in it some
strange, ethereal quality that was beyond passion, and with all
the longing for her that he felt there was a trace of wonder at
her, even of fear.</p>

<p>"Become&mdash;what?" he questioned, and saw her strange eyes
shining in the light from the doorway&mdash;or so he thought at
first, but realized for one instant that they stood beyond any
light that could ray out.</p>

<p>"Mine, all my own," she whispered back. "Body and spirit, soul
and strength. Oh, my lover, how shall I live through time when
you are not? I who have waited so long, so long&mdash;kiss me and
have done with words, for they tell nothing. Your lips&mdash;the
heart of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even as he kissed her he laughed, laughed with a happiness
such as he had never known. It seemed to him that she breathed
into him a life beyond his life, lifted him to a level on which,
hitherto, he had never stood. And her soft laughter came back,
answering him.</p>

<p>"Oh, my beloved, how shall I wait?" he asked passionately.</p>

<p>"A little while&mdash;a very little while," she answered
him.</p>

<p>McCoul's tall figure shadowed the doorway&mdash;Tyrrell could
not have told whether he had stood in the darkness with Gyda for
a minute, or an hour. He knew only that he had entered and
returned from some world of feeling, poignantly, achingly
intense, and that he longed for Gyda to take him back there. He
knew that in truth there was more to her love than he had
dreamed, that she was wonderful beyond his understanding.</p>

<p>"Gyda, we must go back," McCoul said, and the practicality of
the words was like cold water on Tyrrell. "It is past ten."</p>

<p>"Wait, and I'll turn the car out," Tyrrell said.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you mustn't take all that trouble," McCoul
expostulated.</p>

<p>"I insist. Gyda shall not walk back. You wish it, darling?"
Secure in the darkness, he held her close till she answered.</p>

<p>"We are one in our wish, my lover."</p>

<p>"Wait for me&mdash;only a minute," he said, and set off toward
the cart shed that had been set apart for his car, beyond the end
of the house. The doors had not been closed since Gees had taken
out his Rolls-Bentley, and Tyrrell had only to fling up the
dickey cover of his old two-seater, crank up the engine since the
self-starter was too weak to turn it, and drive out to halt
before the doorway to the house.</p>

<p>"Hope you won't mind sitting behind, sir," he said to McCoul,
and switched on the headlights. "Gyda, here with me."</p>

<p>McCoul climbed in. Gyda seated herself beside Tyrrell, and he
drove off along the graveled way and out to the lane. They were
near the narrow stone bridge when he felt her hand clutch his
arm.</p>

<p>"What?" he asked. "Did you leave anything behind?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "It was nothing," and her grasp relaxed.
"Only, as these hinds and serfs say, as if someone stepped across
my grave."</p>

<p>"Hinds and serfs." He puzzled over such an expression, but did
not question it, while he drove up to the standing stones and,
passing between them, went on across the grassy slope till he
reached the end of the causeway across the moat. There he stopped
the car, and McCoul got out.</p>

<p>"You will come in for a minute, Philip?" he asked, and took
the answer for granted. "I will go on ahead and light the
lamp."</p>

<p>Then Tyrrell got down from the driving seat, went round to the
near side of the car, and opened the door. He took Gyda in his
arms, hungrily, as she stepped out, and held her.</p>

<p>"You've wakened so much&mdash;so much I never knew was in me,"
he said. "Gyda, Gyda mine, it must be soon, very soon!"</p>

<p>"Can you come to see me tomorrow?" she asked.</p>

<p>"My darling, I'd come from the ends of the earth when you
ask," he answered. "Tomorrow&mdash;how soon?"</p>

<p>"In the afternoon, alone?"</p>

<p>"Darling, when you wish."</p>

<p>"And then, we can decide how soon&mdash;for always. My dear,
it cannot be too soon for me, as for you. And now you must come
in, only for a very little while, and then go. My dear&mdash;yes,
I wait, too."</p>

<p>They passed along the causeway, Tyrrell's arm about her waist,
and her little white head laid against his shoulder. Before them,
the yellow oblong of light in the wall of the keep showed that
McCoul had lighted the Aladdin lamp, and they passed in, for a
few moments obscuring the dim ray laid along the grass.</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER  XVII. &mdash; DINNER FOR
FIVE&mdash;AND AFTER</h2>

<p class="first">THE clock in Odder church tower clanged out the
half-hour as Gees pulled on his hand-brake at the back of the
vicarage, and, without moving, he grinned down at Madge beside
him.</p>

<p>"Seven-thirty and no blinkin' error," he said. "That is, if
that clock's right. Mine here says it's two minutes slow, and
you're late for dinner unless mine's a liar. I believe it's
truthful."</p>

<p>"I'm not necessarily late for dinner," she said, and, opening
the door for herself, got out. "If I am, it was worth it. Come
along and let's see. Mind, they've got to lay an extra place for
you. George, you're a terrible lot of trouble, but you're worth
it. Come along."</p>

<p>Following her, he found that she was wrong, for a place was
already laid for him. The vicar explained, with an air of
modesty.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;er&mdash;well, you see, Mr. Green, my wife decided
you had only suggested taking Madge to Carlisle for tea,
and&mdash;er&mdash;well, you would acquire an appetite on the way
back, and if we could persuade you to stay and dine with
us&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;quite possibly Mr. Tyrrell is not
expecting you back, although of course he might,
but&mdash;er&mdash;do stay and share our simple meal. I can ring
through and tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's not expecting me," Gees said, "and I don't wish you to
ring him. Also, your daughter has already invited me, and as a
final and altogether conclusive reason, I'm glad of a chance of
seeing you and Mrs. Amber again. So I accept, with joy and goodly
glee."</p>

<p>The vicar's eyes twinkled. "Glad you know your Burton," he
said. "I've studied him, and if I were a writer, I'd go to him
for plots. I have the original edition, with the sixteen pages
that ought never to have been printed. I keep it locked, of
course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Measly blighter!" Madge interposed. "But I'll find that key
one of these days, if it means picking your pockets."</p>

<p>"My dear, Jenny rang the gong just before you came in," her
father protested. "And you haven't even taken your hat off. Mr.
Green, do let me take you along to get rid of your coat and hat.
I'm afraid we are rather lax in our ideas of dinner time&mdash;my
fault, mostly, but also we must defer to the vagaries of a cook,
to some extent. I fear she regards me as a great sinner. There
was a <i>soufflé</i>, once&mdash;a tragedy. A perfect tragedy. It
went&mdash;so!" He extended a hand floorward. "We have never had
a <i>soufflé</i> since. My wife and the cook are in unison about
it. One must treat one's cook, it seems, with a certain amount of
deference. Things have altered sadly since I was a young
man."</p>

<p>"They're still altering," Gees assured him, following to the
alcove which served as a cloak room. He found a peg for his hat
and coat. "Now we won't keep Mrs. Amber waiting&mdash;lead on,
sir, and I'll follow."</p>

<p>The talk over the meal ran on general subjects for awhile.
Harold, it appeared, had decided on the Air Force as a career:
both Mrs. Amber and Madge, Gees concluded, knew more about recent
books and plays than he himself did, and the vicar, contributing
an occasional remark, proved himself fully conversant with topics
of the day. After one of his comments, he saw Gees' amused smile,
and questioned it.</p>

<p>"I want to know how you all do it?" Gees asked in reply.</p>

<p>"How we all do what?" the vicar queried, slightly puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why, know so much of what's going on, when you're here as you
are."</p>

<p>"Quite simple, my dear Watson. I have, fortunately, a small
income of my own in addition to my stipend&mdash;the living is
not a very good one&mdash;and every year we take three weeks'
holiday and make the most of it, sometimes in our own country,
and sometimes abroad. One can store up much in three weeks, by
the aid of white magic."</p>

<p>"That being?" Gees queried.</p>

<p>"Well, say the steam engine, the internal combustion engine,
and a few electrical devices, all of which would have been the
rankest magic a little more than a century ago, and not even
considered white, in all probability. And our rather older friend
the printing press&mdash;magic again, now that I can read today
what happened on the other side of the world yesterday. We have
reached what I should call the beginning of comprehension,
touched the fringe of knowledge."</p>

<p>"A fairly deep fringe, surely," Gees urged thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! The veriest outer fringe, of no depth at all. The
common fallacy that is it more, and that man has made himself in
reality a lord of creation, leads to skepticism over all that
remains to be learned. Man has gone utterly material, let his
machines master him, and will believe only what he can see and
prove by material means. The vast field of the immaterial remains
almost untouched. The why of being, even the influence of the
ductless glands on character."</p>

<p>"But the ductless glands are material enough, daddy," Madge
urged.</p>

<p>"Character is not," he said dryly. "Then in the
material&mdash;what is electricity? We are no nearer the answer
to that than men were in Faraday's time. Apart from the veriest
crust, the composition of the interior of the earth is utterly
unknown&mdash;there may be life within the planet as well as on
its surface, for all that we can tell. A little while ago, all
the elements of which matter is composed were said to be
known&mdash;but two outside the known range have since been
discovered. In every direction, we have to say we do not know,
and your brief investigations here should have convinced you that
in yet another field we know nothing at all, and discredit as
superstition the little that has been guessed."</p>

<p>"Other planes of being, that is," Gees suggested.</p>

<p>"If the cost of, say, a couple of battleships had been devoted
to research, man might have been master of the fourth dimension
by now," the vicar answered indirectly. "There may come a day
when we are no longer fixed in time, but able to travel in it as
we travel in space."</p>

<p>Madge looked across the table at Gees and smiled, as if to say
that she recalled his theory of such a possibility.</p>

<p>"Take a few machine guns back to the battle of Hastings,"
Harold suggested, "and upset all the history books."</p>

<p>"But then we as we are should never have existed," Mrs. Amber
said.</p>

<p>"Do we exist?" Madge asked. "What is reality?"</p>

<p>"Coffee, my dear, I'm glad to say," the vicar answered her.
"Mr. Green, will you take yours with me in my study? We can
rejoin the others afterward, but I'd like a word or two with you
first."</p>

<p>In the study, Gees faced his host questioningly.</p>

<p>"For one thing," Amber said, "will you tell me if you are
going on with your investigations, or giving up and leaving
us?"</p>

<p>"I'm very far from giving up," Gees answered
unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it&mdash;very glad to hear it," the vicar
observed. "I believe you have&mdash;the right angle, let us say.
Sufficient credulity to accept the fantastic. That is, fantastic
from the material, commonplace standpoint. And you regard
Locksborough as the centre of the trouble, as I do?"</p>

<p>"Between ourselves, I regard McCoul as the originator of it,"
Gees admitted frankly. "An experience I had there this morning
proves to me that the man is afraid of me&mdash;or afraid of what
I may find out."</p>

<p>"Possibly. Also quite between ourselves, Mr. Green, I once met
McCoul and his daughter, exactly as they are now, nearly forty
years ago."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you mentioned that," Gees said. "Madge&mdash;your
daughter&mdash; told me of it today, while we were out. But are
you sure?"</p>

<p>For a moment or two the vicar reflected, and then he nodded
gravely.</p>

<p>"In this way," he said. "I saw them quite plainly as they
passed me, noted things about them&mdash;eyes and hair,
particularly. It is possible that a son might resemble his father
enough to be mistaken for him when he has grown to the father's
age. It is possible, too, that a daughter might reproduce her
mother's eyes and snow white hair, but very unlikely that she
would inherit both characteristics so as to be mistaken for her
mother. But the double coincidence&mdash;to me it is an
impossibility that both father and daughter should be exactly
like their immediate forbears. Make every allowance you like for
possible lapses of memory on my part, and still I say these two
are the two I saw then."</p>

<p>"I accept it as fact," Gees remarked quietly.</p>

<p>"One more thing, Mr. Green, and then we can go back to the
others. If your belief justifies you in taking any action against
McCoul&mdash;if you have any grounds for taking action&mdash;take
it quickly."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Gees queried. "Where is the need for that?"</p>

<p>"Here, in Odder," the vicar answered. "Feeling against
McCoul&mdash; and against his daughter too&mdash;has been growing
almost since they first came to live at Locksborough. Tyrrell has
alienated himself from everyone by his association with them, and
now it is known that he intends to marry the daughter, he is
almost as much outside the pale of these people as the McCouls
themselves. And Cottrill's death has intensified the feeling
against them to a dangerous point. Odder almost openly accuses
McCoul of being responsible for Cottrill's death, instigating
whatever caused it. The police can take no action against him, I
know, for they have no material evidence to connect him with what
has happened here. But the people of the village, and for miles
round&mdash;they are simple folk&mdash;rather primal in their
instincts to this day, and all the old beliefs and superstition
have been roused to full life among them. They might take action
themselves, before long."</p>

<p>"Such as?" Gees asked.</p>

<p>"Such as setting fire to the castle, say. Putting themselves
in the wrong, putting McCoul in a very strong position, and
possibly ending any action you may contemplate. If they force
Inspector Feather and his men to take McCoul's part, for
instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and Gees thought it over. Certainly, if Feather had
to protect the McCouls, there would be an end to his co-operation
in these night watches&mdash;but Gees could not tell how long
they must go on without result. And he could see no other course
but the one on which he had determined: open accusation, or
search on a warrant such as Feather had suggested, he felt sure,
would ruin everything. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I must risk it," he said. "I cannot take action yet."</p>

<p>"It is difficult, I know," the vicar reflected. "Against the
abnormal, normal planning or action would be useless. One
personal warning. Do not go to the bar of the inn alone. I know
you have been there with Cottrill, and with Tom Cotton too. But
do not go alone&mdash;remember, everyone here knows you are
staying with Tyrrell."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," Gees assented. "The feeling against the McCouls
might extend through him to me. But I think I have finished with
that bar."</p>

<p>Then Amber took him to the old-fashioned, comfortable drawing-
room of the house, and the four of them&mdash;Harold had
disappeared&mdash; talked until, at twenty minutes past nine,
Gees rose and intimated that he must go. When he had said his
good-byes, Madge got ahead of her father on the way to the door,
and turned to Gees.</p>

<p>"Since you left your car at the back, it will be quicker to go
out that way," she suggested. "I'll show him, daddy&mdash;you
needn't come."</p>

<p>She escorted Gees out by the back door, and went with him to
the car. There he opened the tool chest and took out an electric
torch, which he dropped into his overcoat pocket. Then he turned
to the girl.</p>

<p>"No, get in," she bade. "I've something to say to you, after
you are inside, but not before."</p>

<p>"I am not taking the car just yet," he said. "It may remain
here for several hours, yet. I am going off on foot."</p>

<p>"Where?" She moved quite close to him and looked up into his
face.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I am not taking the car," he repeated.</p>

<p>"You're going after the grey things," she accused. "And
Cottrill&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cottrill was alone&mdash;I shall not be," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;but you know what they are&mdash;don't tell me any
more. And it was not for that I wanted to come out to speak to
you, but because of&mdash;of what happened this afternoon, just
before you drove home. When you stopped beside the road,
and&mdash;you remember?"</p>

<p>"Do I remember, Madge!" he echoed, and smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Just this&mdash;it wasn't today that it happened. We came
down from the height that is out of time, just for a
minute&mdash;a minute that does not belong to any day we know. A
little space apart from life as I must live it&mdash;as you must
live it. Not less sweet, not less dear, but apart as a yesterday,
or some tomorrow that we cannot see, now."</p>

<p>He put his arms round her. "Not less sweet, not less dear,
than you," he told her. "I understand, Madge, perhaps better than
you think."</p>

<p>"Then I can be happy in remembering it. Bless you, dear-good
night."</p>

<p>She withdrew herself from his hold and ran back into the
house.</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"Now, Inspector, the procedure is exactly as last night,
except that I want you with me outside the front entrance, and
the sergeant and Tom Cotton to watch the path at the back. All
loaded and ready?"</p>

<p>"All ready," Feather answered. "But why the change?"</p>

<p>"Say that I want official support for both Tom and myself,
instead of our acting independently of you. Account for it in
that way, if you like. And we'll go&mdash;we ought to be in
position by ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Are you sure this is going to lead to anything?" Feather
paused to ask, after taking up one of the guns and making certain
it was loaded.</p>

<p>"I'm sure no other way is going to lead to anything, and sure
enough of this to forfeit that five hundred pounds if it
doesn't," Gees snapped out acidly. "Do I write you the check now,
or do we start?"</p>

<p>"If we draw blank tonight," Feather said, "you can write it
before we start to-morrow night, and hand it to someone to hold
either till I call off and lose it or till your fortnight is up
and you lose it."</p>

<p>"That's agreed," Gees remarked cheerfully. "Now let's get
going."</p>

<p>Ten o'clock was striking as Cotton and Sergeant Rapkin settled
into their post that commanded the exit from the path through the
moat, and Gees went back with the inspector and crossed the
causeway, two silently flitting figures that disappeared
altogether when they lay down in the niche of the ruined
gatehouse. The frontage of the keep showed no light from any of
its arrow slits, but, after a long period of waiting, Gees saw
the glow from the headlights of Tyrrell's car advancing from
Dowlandsbar. Then, since their niche was too near the direct line
between the causeway and the main entrance, while ordinary people
went by, he clambered on all fours, Feather following him, to
another secure shelter in the ruins. There they saw the car halt,
its headlamps striking a cone-shaped ray over them to end on the
wall of the keep, and McCoul came first alone and entered the
place, the heavy iron latch of the door clacking hollowly as he
moved it. Light showed from within soon after, both from the two
arrow slits and from the doorway itself, and after another,
longer interval Tyrrell and Gyda appeared, her silvery hair
shining close to Tyrrell's shoulder as he held her near to him.
The two watchers heard her soft, caressing voice&mdash;"My
dear&mdash;yes, I wait, too," and then the pair passed and
disappeared within the keep. Gees noted that the door remained
open, for the entrance still showed as lighted. For just one
moment he felt compunction over thus spying on the lovers, but
then he remembered Cottrill's body, bloodless and mangled as he
had seen it, and forgot all softer thoughts.</p>

<p>Another long interval passed, and then Tyrrell and Gyda
emerged again. They passed to where the car stood, and, five
minutes or more later, Gees heard Tyrrell crank the engine to
life. He had turned to go out to the lane when Gyda returned
across the causeway, and now McCoul became visible, still in his
evening clothes, and framed in the doorway of the keep while his
daughter advanced toward him.</p>

<p>"It is a perfect night," she said, quite audibly to the
watchers.</p>

<p>"A hunting night," McCoul answered her, and laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Then they both went within the keep, but still, Gees noted,
the door remained open, and the light from the big, ground-floor
room was kept on. For a minute or less another faint light
appeared in the arrow slit that Gees knew now was in the wall of
Gyda's room on the first floor: it disappeared, and then came
another long interval of stillness. A little breeze sighed about
the place, but so little sound was there that Gees, his senses
strained to full acuteness, could hear his own wrist watch
ticking. And then, he knew, fear came.</p>

<p>Silent as was the night itself, intangible, invisible, fear
came as he lay there watching the lighted doorway. Some
hideousness, some unnatural, devilish presence tensed his every
nerve and chilled him. He saw dimly that Feather, beside him,
moved, and reached out to grip the inspector's arm while,
subduing his own terror in the need of keeping his companion
quiet, he managed to whisper, "Quiet!" and keep his teeth from
chattering. And Feather lay still again.</p>

<p>Something showed for an instant and no more in the lighted
entrance and, before either man could lift a gun, a grey shape
passed out along the causeway and was gone. Another followed,
and, since the two men were lying to leeward of the track, the
foul smell that Gees knew came to his nostrils for a moment.
There had been no chance, no time to fire a shot, before the
things were gone. Then Gees stood up.</p>

<p>"Inspector," he said, keeping his voice very low, "I am going
to sign their death warrant." And, moving noiselessly across the
grass, he went to the door and closed it, lifting the latch by
turning the iron ring, and dropping it so that the door was
fastened. He tried it to make certain, and then returned to where
Feather stood.</p>

<p>"Now we'll post ourselves closer," he whispered, "and when
they come back and stop against that closed door shoot, and don't
miss."</p>

<p>"And then McCoul&mdash;arrest him," Feather whispered back.
"He sent them out. Get them first, then him."</p>

<p>"Aye, arrest McCoul!" Gees said aloud.</p>

<p>They moved up to within a few feet of the doorway, and there
lay down again. Time ceased to be. Gees thought of Cottrill, of
the sheep scattered and unguarded on the fells, of two things
rending at throats, drinking hot blood&mdash;a soft pattering on
the grass, and he nudged the man beside him gently. <i>They</i>
were returning.</p>

<p>He saw them, two shadows on the darkness. One went within the
thickness of the wall where the closed door was set, one held
back, as if waiting while its partner made a way, and, his gun
already at his shoulder, Gees aimed as nearly as he could in the
gloom.</p>

<p>"Fire!" he bade sharply, and pressed his trigger.</p>

<p>An awful, half-human screech mingled with the report of his
gun, and then the crash of Feather's shot sounded beside him. He
let off the left barrel, aiming into the doorway, and again
Feather's gun spat flame. Then, on his feet, his automatic pistol
ready in his right hand and the electric light in his left, Gees
went to where the grey thing outside the doorway wriggled
hideously and yapped in a wolfish way&mdash;a pellet had struck
some nerve centre, and with blood pouring from its chest the
thing jerked about on the grass. Gees put the pistol to its ear
and pressed the trigger, and all movement ceased.</p>

<p>He rayed the light into the doorway, where the smaller, paler
one of the two lay quite still, its green-flecked, amber eyes
glaring in death, its evenly set little teeth exposed in a wolf's
grin. But the eyes of the one through whose brain Gees had sent a
bullet were black as the night.</p>

<p>"My God, we've got 'em!" Feather said, half-incoherently. "Got
'em at last! Got 'em! And now&mdash;and now for McCoul!"</p>

<p>"And now for McCoul," Gees echoed grimly.</p>

<p>"He's guilty&mdash;they're his, and he let 'em out," Feather
declared excitedly. "And he knows we're after him&mdash;else,
he'd have opened this door with all this shooting going on. Wait,
though! Let's call in the sergeant and your man Cotton. My God,
what a night!"</p>

<p>But the night was not over yet, Gees knew. He waited while the
inspector went to the corner of the keep and, cupping his hands
about his mouth, sent out a stentorian call&mdash;"Rapkin!
Errrapkin!" that went in bellowing echoes down into the
hollows&mdash;perhaps, Gees thought, crossed to strike on
Tyrrell's ears at Dowlandsbar.</p>

<p>He played the ray of his torch over the two dead grey shapes.
They were wolves in build, but far bigger than any wolf he had
ever seen. The grizzled-furred, larger one of the two was male,
and the other, with finer, lighter fur and green-flecked amber
eyes, female&mdash;there was no doubt, now, in Gees mind as to
what they were.</p>

<p>"Could be destroyed. I repeat that&mdash;could be destroyed.
Don't think for one moment that they are immortal."</p>

<p>He remembered the vicar in his study, insistent on his theory.
The black magic that had evoked these shapes had failed, and they
had been destroyed. Then Feather returned from his summoning.</p>

<p>"He answered me&mdash;they're coming back," he said. "I
wonder&mdash;no, we won't try to make an entry till they get
here. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off and stood musing. At his return, Gees had
switched off his torch, and the things on the ground were no more
than outlined shapes, the smaller one a mere dimness in the
shadow of the doorway&mdash;until, at a thought, Feather stooped
over it, seized it by its tail and a hind leg, and dragged it out
beside its fellow. He made a little exclamation of disgust as he
straightened himself after his task.</p>

<p>"It's heavy," he said after a pause. "Heavier than you'd
think."</p>

<p>And, after another brief period of waiting for Rapkin and
Cotton:</p>

<p>"Where the devil did he <i>get</i> such things?"</p>

<p>"Aye, where the devil?" Gees echoed grimly.</p>

<p>Rapkin and Tom Cotton came trotting across the causeway, and
Gees flicked on his light as guidance for them. He looked up the
blank, grim frontage of the keep, and saw the stars overhead.
Then, gazing downward, he rayed the torch momentarily on to each
carcass, that the two men might see them as they approached.</p>

<p>"By gum, you got 'em both!" Tom Cotton exclaimed. "And now,"
Feather said, "I want you all with me while I round off the
night's work by arresting McCoul."</p>

<p>"On what charge?" Gees asked dryly.</p>

<p>The inspector, ignoring the question, went into the doorway
and, grasping the iron ring of the latch, used it as a knocker.
His use of it sounded like the tat-tat-tat of a machine gun, and
he released the handle and stood before the door, waiting.</p>

<p>But there was no sound of movement from within. A thin, faint
line of light between the door and its framing showed that the
lamp inside had not been extinguished, but, though Feather
knocked again after an interval, and waited again, the door
remained closed.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER  XVIII. &mdash; CHANGE AT DAWN</h2>

<p class="first">"IF they're not going to open it," Feather said
resolutely, "I am." He turned the handle and pushed at the door.
It swung inward, revealing a section of the lighted apartment.
Feather went inside and turned to call to the other three waiting
without:</p>

<p>"Come in, all of you! They've gone upstairs, or
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Probably somewhere," Gees said to himself as he went in. He
looked at his wrist watch. There was a heavy task yet to be done,
but it was not yet an hour past midnight, and dawn was still far
off.</p>

<p>"Not here, obviously," Feather said, looking round the
apartment in which not so much as a cat could have hidden. He
lifted his voice and shouted toward the staircase in the
corner&mdash;"McCoul? Mister McCoul?"</p>

<p>He waited, but there was no response, no sound of any kind.
Gees gazed round the big apartment, saw the long settee angled
away from the farther fireplace, and the dead white ash of burned
logs.</p>

<p>"Those things outside," he said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well?" Feather turned on him and rasped the word out,
harshly. "They're dead enough, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Gees assented quietly. "Who killed them?"</p>

<p>"Who killed them?" Feather echoed, in angry surprise at the
question. "Why, we did, didn't we? I can claim as much credit as
you over it, except for your putting a bullet through the head of
the big one."</p>

<p>"Yes." Gees' voice was still very quiet. "I want you to claim
equal credit with me, Inspector. More, if you like."</p>

<p>"We killed them," Feather insisted. "Both of us fired both
barrels. But they can wait. McCoul!" He shouted again. "He's
upstairs," he said. "Inside these tremendous walls, they may not
have heard us shoot."</p>

<p>Gees shook his head, but did not reply. Rapkin and Tom Cotton,
their guns under their arms, stood together, silent and waiting,
and the utter, soundless stillness of the place was an
oppression.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're upstairs," Feather said at last. "I'm going
after 'em, too. That other lamp, there&mdash;light it, Sergeant,
and come up with me. Mr. Green, either you or Cotton ought to
stay down here, to see that they don't go out some other
way."</p>

<p>He looked round the bare walls. "But there's only the one
way," he added. "If we bolt that door and shove the settee in
front of it, we shall know if they do go out. And they can't get
far."</p>

<p>"No," Gees agreed. "They can't get far."</p>

<p>"Give me a hand, Sergeant," Feather ordered. He went to the
settee, and Rapkin followed him. The two of them carried the
settee over to the doorway, where Feather, putting down his end,
closed and bolted the door top and bottom, and then they ranged
the settee across so that the door could not be opened until it
had been moved again.</p>

<p>"Better so," Feather said. "We shall know now if they go out,
and in a place like this it's best to keep together. Light that
lamp there, Sergeant." He pointed to an unlighted lamp on a deal
table by the back wall. "With that and your torch, Mr. Green, we
should be all right. We can't have too much light&mdash;this
place gives me the creeps, and we don't know the way about
upstairs."</p>

<p>"I can tell you," Gees said. "You come first to a doorway that
leads to a bathroom and another room over the main doorway, in
the thickness of the wall. The next door-way leads on to the
floor above us, where you'll find two bedrooms, one for McCoul
and the other for his daughter, and a dining-room, with a
separate staircase leading down to Ammon's quarters. Over that
again is an empty room which takes up the whole area of the keep,
then comes the roof McCoul had put in, and above that are the
battlements&mdash;the four bare walls."</p>

<p>"How do you know this?" Feather demanded, with a tinge of
suspicion.</p>

<p>"I know it," Gees answered composedly, "because McCoul showed
me over the place when Tyrrell and I came here this
morning&mdash;yes, it was only this morning, though it seems much
longer ago than that."</p>

<p>"Well, hand me that lamp, Sergeant, and I'll go first. They
don't mean to come down, evidently. You follow me, and keep that
gun handy, but with the safety catch on. Mr. Green, and you,
Cotton, I want you to come up too. If there's any
trouble&mdash;resistance, or anything, I may want you both for
evidence, later on."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't stop down here alone," Tom Cotton said, "not for
all the gold in England."</p>

<p>"It may be silly, but I feel rather like that myself," Feather
admitted, and took the lamp from Rapkin. "Come along&mdash;I'll
go first."</p>

<p>Gees went last. The little party came to the first exit from
the spiral stair, and Feather halted and half-turned about.</p>

<p>"This the way to the bathroom?" he called back to Gees below
him.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and another room farther along." He switched on his
torch. "You and the sergeant can take the light and
look&mdash;Cotton and I will wait here, so that nobody can go up
or down without our seeing them."</p>

<p>They waited while the lamp receded along the passage. After an
interval Feather returned, the silent Rapkin following him
closely.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said. "That room at the end&mdash;there's holes
in the floor and in the outside wall, too, but not big enough for
anyone to get through. Iron rust on the stones, as if there'd
been chains, once."</p>

<p>"Quite right&mdash;windlass chains," Gees told him. "Now will
you go first? McCoul's bedroom is on the right, his daughter's on
the left."</p>

<p>With the light from the lamp to guide him up the worn, uneven
treads of the staircase, Feather wound on upward until he stepped
out to the corridor of the first floor. Gees, coming out beside
him, pointed.</p>

<p>"McCoul's room," he said.</p>

<p>The door of the room was open, as was that of the larger
apartment opposite, which McCoul had said was Gyda's. Feather
went along and, standing in McCoul's doorway, held the lamp above
his head.</p>

<p>"McCoul?" he said sharply. "Mr. McCoul?"</p>

<p>But there was no response, and after a second he stepped into
the room and looked behind the door. Gees, advancing to look in,
saw McCoul's evening clothes dropped carelessly on a chair, and
his underclothing, socks, and shoes, in a little heap beside the
bed, which had been made and left tidy. Feather gazed at
Gees.</p>

<p>"Odd," he said, "they're what he was wearing when he came back
here in that car. He must have changed."</p>

<p>"Yes, he changed," Gees said.</p>

<p>Feather stepped out into the corridor, and, again holding the
lamp high, looked into the other room. The shimmering grey frock
Gyda had worn had been laid carefully on the tidy bed, and at the
foot of the bed was a little heap of underclothing, with silk
stockings hanging over the edge, and grey satin shoes on the rug.
After a moment's hesitation and utter stillness Feather stepped
inside, and saw the room was empty of human presence. He emerged
again.</p>

<p>"That other door," he said. "Do you know?"</p>

<p>"The dining-room," Gees told him. "You'd better look in there
too."</p>

<p>"McCoul?" Feather shouted again. Then he went toward the
dining-room door, which was closed, and laid his hand on the
handle.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," he said uneasily. "I don't like it at
all."</p>

<p>He turned the handle and pushed at the door, and it swung
wide. He entered, Gees following him, and the other two moved
along the passage to look in. Feather pointed at the door that he
faced.</p>

<p>"Where does that lead&mdash;do you know?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Down to Ammon's quarters, McCoul told me," Gees answered. "I
have not been down, though, so I don't know what it's like."</p>

<p>"Well, the door is bolted on this side," Feather observed.</p>

<p>"We can come back and take that later, if they're not hiding
higher up. They are hiding somewhere&mdash;and they must have
heard the shots, after all."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think they heard the shots," Gees said very
quietly.</p>

<p>"Let's look up on the next floor," Feather said, and emerged
to the corridor again. "I'll go first, as before."</p>

<p>Without emerging from the stairway, he looked into the big,
empty room above by the light of the lamp he carried. "Not here,"
he said, his puzzlement evident in his voice. "And higher?"
Moving the lamp back to light the stairway, he revealed a heavy
wooden door that had stood open when Gees had ascended to the
battlements with McCoul, but now was closed and bolted top and
bottom.</p>

<p>"Not up there, unless there's some other way," Feather said.
"They couldn't go up this way and bolt the door from this side.
That man Ammon&mdash;he may know something. Let's go and
see."</p>

<p>So they went down again, and, unbolting and opening the door
in the dining-room, Feather revealed another stairway spiraling
down, but ending on this floor. He entered, and the other three
followed him, to emerge into a sort of kitchen in which stood a
paraffin cooking stove and other ordinary kitchen furniture. Then
another door, and in the little room to which it led Shaun Ammon
slept in a narrow bed by the far wall, while yet another door
bolted on the inside was visible&mdash;it was the one that led
out at the back of the castle, Gees felt sure, and the water tank
he had seen was on the outer side.</p>

<p>Feather went to the bed and bending over it, shook the
sleeper.</p>

<p>"Wake up!" he bade sharply. "I want to question you."</p>

<p>But he won no response. The man in the bed lay still.</p>

<p>"Here, you!" Feather shouted angrily, and shook him again,
more vigorously. "Wake up, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Ammon slept on, his breathing heavy and even.</p>

<p>"Shamming!" Feather exclaimed disgustedly.</p>

<p>"No," Gees said.</p>

<p>He moved up beside the bed, and, reaching down carefully,
managed to lift one of the sleeping man's eyelids. Only the white
of the eye showed, as Feather, looking down, saw.</p>

<p>"What is it, then?" he asked. "Drugs?"</p>

<p>"No, not drugs," Gees answered. "I think you'll find it's
post-hypnotic suggestion, and McCoul had him under control, so
that he goes to sleep at a certain hour and wakes at a certain
hour. Best leave him for the present. In that state, he couldn't
let them out at the back and bolt the door after they'd gone.
Besides, the door at the top of this stair was bolted on the
other side, so they didn't come down here."</p>

<p>"Then where are they?" Feather demanded sharply. "We saw them
come in, and they didn't go out again by the front. Where the
devil are they? Here, let's go back and see if they've slipped
past us somehow."</p>

<p>Passing through the kitchen, he went up the stair again and,
after the other three had emerged to the dining-room, bolted the
door at the top. Then he went on and, entering Gyda's room,
opened the door of a wardrobe and looked within. Some dresses
hung there, and nothing else. Feather crossed to McCoul's room
and looked in another wardrobe, vainly. He came out, and for some
seconds stood irresolute, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Let's go down," he said at last. "They may have slipped past
us."</p>

<p>But, in the ground floor room, the light of the hanging lamp
showed the settee still standing before the barred outer door.
Feather put down his lamp on a table by the fireplace, and shook
his head.</p>

<p>"Secret passages," he said. "A place like this&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gees glanced at his wrist watch. Dawn was far off yet, he
saw.</p>

<p>"I don't know." Feather moved toward the fireplace, thinking.
Then he reached out and grasped one of two round iron bars, each
nearly six feet in length, that leaned against the outer corner
of the fire place. "Odd sort of pokers," he remarked. "Used for
levering big logs about, I suppose." He pulled the bar to the
perpendicular, as if to feel its weight, and then leaned it
against the wall again.</p>

<p>"Now I know!" Gees exclaimed abruptly.</p>

<p>"Know what?" Feather asked. "Where they've hidden?"</p>

<p>But Gees did not answer. He went to the foot of the spiral
stairway, slid aside a rug, and lifted out the two sections of
planking that concealed the entrance to the dungeons. But he
could not lift the stone beneath, though two recesses at one end
gave him hand-hold.</p>

<p>"Come and lend me a hand, Inspector," he asked.</p>

<p>Feather, already beside him, bent to lift at the stone.
Between them they got it up on end, and revealed the stain going
down.</p>

<p>"But they couldn't have put the boards back," Feather
objected.</p>

<p>"Not that. Now we're here&mdash;those iron bars. McCoul showed
me more than he meant this morning, and I'm sure&mdash;come down
with me."</p>

<p>He went to the fireplace and took up one of the bars. It was
all he could carry down the stairs, he knew, and he beckoned to
Tom Cotton.</p>

<p>"You bring the other, Tom," he bade. "Light us down,
Inspector."</p>

<p>After only a moment's hesitation Feather moved and took up the
lamp, which he had not extinguished. Gees switched on his torch
and handed it to Rapkin before taking up the iron bar.</p>

<p>"You may need more light," he said. "The stairs are
slippery."</p>

<p>Then he went down, Cotton following him with the second
bar.</p>

<p>"Straight on, Inspector," he bade. "The room at the end."</p>

<p>They emerged to the torture chamber, and the light of the lamp
revealed its ghastly fitments. But, without heeding them, Gees
went to the raised stone block in the middle, and Feather stood
over it with the lamp in his hand, the light falling on the
recessed shape of a human figure chiseled in it, and the black-
stained runners that told what its use had been. Stooping, Gees
looked at the exits of the runnels.</p>

<p>"Yes, as I thought," he said, and fitted the end of his bar
into a circular hole in the side of the stone. "You'll find
another hole like this, Tom, at that end, where the deep groove
comes out to the side. And I think you'll find that bar fits in,
if you try it."</p>

<p>He was right. Each bar ran about a foot into the stone,
leaving nearly five feet sticking out horizontally.</p>

<p>"Now, with me, Tom&mdash;get all the leverage you can, and
lift. He shouldn't have let me see the bits of cement he'd
chipped away where the stone fits to the floor. Ready?
Now&mdash;all your strength&mdash;lift!"</p>

<p>He put all his own strength to the task. Slowly the massive
block of stone came up, like the lid of a box, and revealed a
cavity beneath. They lifted the stone beyond its point of
balance, and let it thud over on to its side, and the two bars
stuck out from it perpendicularly, now. Feather held the lamp so
that its light shone into the cavity, and Rapkin, standing at the
end, rayed the light of the torch in too.</p>

<p>"Heavens above us!" Feather whispered, as if robbed of his
voice by what he saw.</p>

<p>At the end where Rapkin stood, a heap of dull yellow coins.
Beyond them, the sheen of gems set in golden ornaments, heaped
indiscriminately. There was a crucifix of gold, blazing with
great diamonds; there were jeweled bracelets and brooches, golden
cups&mdash;one filled with heavy, jeweled rings; there was the
red fire of rubies, and the cold green glitter of emeralds, and,
since all the cavity was filled with these things, the actual
bulk of the treasure was beyond their ascertaining. After a long,
long silence Gees put one foot across to the far edge of the
cavity, and gripped the bar he had lifted.</p>

<p>"I thought you had better see it, Inspector," he said. "Tom,
catch hold at your end and let's cover it in again."</p>

<p>"A king's ransom," Feather said, in an awed way.</p>

<p>"Blood and torment&mdash;murder and worse than murder went to
the making of that collection," Gees said. "It will rank as
treasure-trove&mdash;which is why I wanted you to see it. Heave
hard, Tom."</p>

<p>But it was not until Feather set down his lamp, and both he
and Rapkin pushed at the bars from the other side, that the stone
came over and dropped back into its place. Then Feather took up
the lamp.</p>

<p>"Will it be safe like that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only we four know," Gees answered, "and if McCoul hadn't
shown me the way down here I should never have guessed it. Ben
Latimer knows where the staircase is, but no more. And you'll
report it, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Certainly I shall report it," Feather answered. "Another
charge against McCoul, concealing treasure-trove and perverting
it to his own use. That is&mdash;I suppose he knew it was there,
though."</p>

<p>"If you look over there"&mdash;Gees pointed at the heap of
rusted, ancient pincers and other things of terror beside the
moldering brazier&mdash;"you'll see a perfectly new heavy
hammer&mdash;or nearly new, rather&mdash;and the cold chisel he
used to chip away the cement from the edges of this stone. But
even then I didn't guess, not until I saw these two bars and
realized how he'd lifted it. Alone, probably&mdash;he was as
strong as two ordinary men. And his daughter wore some part of
this stuff as ornaments, proof that he knew of it."</p>

<p>They went back, and Gees replaced the stone and planks by the
foot of the spiral stairway, and slid the rug back into its
place.</p>

<p>Feather gazed at the settee across the doorway, and shook his
head.</p>

<p>"They can't get far," he said in a low voice, as if to
himself. "She's too conspicuous with that hair of hers&mdash;and
so is he."</p>

<p>Again Gees looked at his watch. Time, but not too much time,
remained for what he knew he had yet to do. He went over to the
settee and pulled off the cushion which covered all its
length.</p>

<p>"And now I want some rope," he said. He looked round the room.
By the wall opposite the door stood a small, sham-antique, carved
oak or pseudo-oak chest. Opening it, he found and took out a ball
of heavy white cord, and, unwinding a length, tested its strength
as fully as he could.</p>

<p>"Good enough, I think," he commented in a satisfied way.</p>

<p>"It's McCoul's property," Feather reminded him, "and so is
that settee cushion you chucked on the floor. What do you want to
do?"</p>

<p>"Burn those two carcasses," Gees answered calmly.</p>

<p>"What?" Feather barked it out. "Evidence&mdash;burn them?"</p>

<p>"Inspector," Gees said coolly, "four of us here are witnesses
that those two beasts have been destroyed. Get other witnesses if
you like, but I'm going to burn those carcasses before dawn."</p>

<p>"I'm damned if you are!" Feather exclaimed heatedly.</p>

<p>"When you began this," Gees reminded him, "you agreed to put
yourself under my orders, and now I hold you to that. I am going
to burn those two carcasses outside, on a pile made ready down by
the stone bridge, and do it before daylight, too. I intend to tie
them on to this cushion, and use it as a sled&mdash;drag them
there. Tom, are you willing to help me? It's got to be done."</p>

<p>"Aye, Mr. Green, you're right&mdash;you've been right all
along," Tom said gravely. "I'll help to burn the cursed things,
lest worse come to us. Unless what you reckon might hap is
already happed."</p>

<p>"Hand me my torch, Sergeant," Gees bade curtly. He dragged
aside the settee, shot back the bolts, and opened the door. Then
he rayed the torch out through the doorway, and Tom looked out
over his shoulder. Rapkin, too, gazed out.</p>

<p>"God above us!" The sergeant gave vent to the exclamation in a
frightened way. "Neither of 'em's got a tail!"</p>

<p>"Rot, man!" Feather pushed him aside to look along the ray of
light. "I saw their tails when I dragged the littler one out of
the way after we shot 'em. What are you talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off. Gees dropped the light from the carcasses, and
turned to see the inspector's face whiter than before.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Inspector?" he asked coolly.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;I'd have sworn&mdash;" Feather stammered, and did
not end it.</p>

<p>"You would have sworn right," Gees answered. "Now, man, before
the change completes itself, do we burn them? You claim equal
credit with me for shooting them, remember. Do we burn them,
before dawn?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Feather gasped after a long pause. "Yes&mdash;Oh, my
God, yes! Quick! I'd never believe if I hadn't seen&mdash;that.
Quick&mdash;yes!"</p>

<p>"Then put that standing lamp in the doorway to give us light
enough to tie them on the cushion," Gees bade, "and then we can
drag them down the lane to the pile laid ready near the stone
bridge. Come on, Tom."</p>

<h3>* * * *</h3>

<p class="first">"Now. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;heave!"</p>

<p>Grasping the hind legs of the larger of the two beasts, while
Tom Cotton held the forepaws, Gees swung the carcass, and with
the last word let go. The thing fell into the centre of the
brushwood pile, and sank from their sight&mdash;Sergeant Rapkin
held the electric torch as guide for their movements. They took
up the smaller, whitish-furred beast in the same way and heaved
again, and it fell and lay partly visible across its fellow. Then
Gees filled the pail that had been left there from one of the
cans of paraffin, and flung it on the pile. Again he filled and
threw the fluid, again and yet again, until eight cans were
empty.</p>

<p>"Sixteen gallons, master," Tom said. "Enough, surely."</p>

<p>"We can see if it is," Gees said, and, sweating from his
labors, struck a match and held it to the pile for a second or
more. Rapkin switched off the torch: light was growing in the
east, and had grown enough already to reveal all things clearly.
He stood back.</p>

<p>A flickering, feeble flame among the brushwood showed that it
had caught alight, and Gees stepped back hastily. Then with a
roar a column of flame and black, oily smoke shot heavenward, and
wavered toward Dowlandsbar in the light dawn breeze. In the cast,
the first purpling of clouds before the rising of the sun
appeared. Feather stood back, staring at the roaring pile. Under
their canopy of smoke and flame, the two carcasses were
invisible. The wood was damp, Gees knew: there was more of smoke
than flame in the roaring, crackling pillar.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what are you doing, Gees?"</p>

<p>Tyrrell leaped the fence between the lane and the fire with
the shout, and came up beside Feather as Gees turned, wiping his
forehead with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>"Ending it," he answered, and took up one of the two remaining
full cans of paraffin. He unscrewed the cap, and tilted the can
over the pail, emptying it and putting it down again. As he
straightened himself, he saw Tyrrell, scantily clad under his
overcoat, beside him.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;you've got them?" Tyrrell asked eagerly. "I
heard shooting in the night, and your voices here just now, and
came&mdash;"</p>

<p>But then he broke off, his eyes wide with horror, his
outstretched hand pointing at the pile. The strengthening breeze
had slanted the fire, and for a few moments all that lay there
was visible.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" Tyrrell screamed awfully.</p>

<p>In the centre of the fire there showed the white roundness of
a woman's bare breast, and there was just a glimpse of snow white
hair&mdash;but Gees lifted the pail and flung its contents as
Tyrrell dropped in a fit beside him. Again black smoke hid all
that the pyre held.</p>

<p>"See to him," Gees said to Feather. "Tom and I will see to the
fire. Get him away&mdash;carry him away, before he comes
round."</p>

<p>Nearly an hour later, Gees and Tom Cotton went among the hot
ashes, heedless of spoiling their footgear, and, kicking aside
the bits of logs that yet glowed, crushed to powder such of the
bones and skulls as the fire had left whole.</p>

<p>"What's going on at Dowlandsbar, Tom?" Gees asked as they
finished this last task and came back to cool ground.</p>

<p>"They've put Mr. Tyrrell to bed," Tom answered, "an' the
inspector telephoned for Doctor Markham. Not that he's real bad,
it seems, but the inspector reckoned he wanted him in bed for
awhile."</p>

<p>"Yes, he would," Gees said thoughtfully. "And four of us can
take oath that we threw two beasts on the fire and burned them to
ashes."</p>

<p>"Aye," Tom assented gravely. "Only just in time, though."</p>

<p>Gees gazed toward the lane. His face was grimed with smoke
from the fire; there were splashes of paraffin on his clothes,
and greenish stains from the dungeon walls of Locksborough. The
breeze of dawn had failed, and the world lay very still in the
early morning sunlight.</p>

<p>"I'll go and get my car, I think," Gees said.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; FOUR LETTERS</h2>

<p class="first">"EVE MADELEINE," Gees told himself "Punctual to
the minute over her lunch, the darling."</p>

<p>He gave the girl time to install herself in her own room, then
went out from his office, opened her door, and stood in the
doorway. She gazed up at him over her typewriter.</p>

<p>"Afternoon, Miss Brandon," he said. "Anything doing?"</p>

<p>"A few inquiries I have not yet acknowledged, Mr. Green," she
answered coldly. "I rang through to the number you gave me the
day before yesterday, and was told by Mr. Tyrrell that you had
left and he could give me no more information. So I held
everything over until I could hear from you."</p>

<p>"Quite so." Advancing into the room, he seated himself on the
corner of her desk. "I stepped aside into Shropshire&mdash;or
rather, the car did&mdash;to tickle the aurochs under their chins
and see how badly my poor papa is getting swindled through not
looking after his own property. Remind me to draft an
advertisement for a new bailiff for the home farm, later on. The
present one accepted his resignation before I left this morning.
Accepted it as a <i>fait accompli</i>, I mean. Now about these
inquiries of yours. Anything very pressing?"</p>

<p>"They are all here." She indicated a pile of a dozen or so
opened letters, with two unopened ones on top. "Will you go
through them?"</p>

<p>"In a minute. What about our Sussex wife-poisoner?"</p>

<p>"It was about him I rang you. He sent his two guineas, and I
acknowledged the check and made the appointment as you told me.
He rang up on receipt of my letter and asked if it would not be
possible for you to see him earlier&mdash;he offered to pay all
your expenses if you would go and see him at his home, and said
it was very urgent."</p>

<p>"Then it is&mdash;to him," Gees said. "But he's not me. Write
and tell him I'll call on the appointed date, if he likes, not
before. I'm much too important to be hurried. Gee-whiz, it's good
to be back!"</p>

<p>"Then you didn't enjoy your stay in Cumberland," she
observed.</p>

<p>"What I meant is that it's good to look at a motor-bus and
feel reasonably sure it won't turn into a sedan chair or a Roman
war chariot while you wait," he explained mystifyingly. "It
was&mdash; well, what you might call educative. Broadening the
old mind, and all that. If I told you lycanthropy is a reality,
you'd probably start walking up the wall&mdash;or out for
good&mdash;so I won't assert it. But it is, all the same. And
these?" He took up the two unopened letters, and saw that both
were postmarked "Odder." Then he gazed at the top sheet of the
opened scripts. "Hullo!" he said, and took it up to read:</p>
<br>

<p class="typewriter">Green Esq.<br> 37, Little Oakfield
Street.<br> London, S.W. I.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Dear Sir.</p>

<p class="typewriter">On returning from my attendance on Mr.
Tyrrell, I was hopeful of seeing you again. I have to thank you
for your assistance in the Dowlandsbar case, which I do. So far,
your unexpected absence has made no difference, but, in the event
of any questions arising over what happened at Locksborough
Castle and the subsequent destruction of the two animals, I trust
I may count on your support of my statement as to their being
animals and nothing else.</p>

<p class="typewriter">I shall be glad to have your assurance on
this point.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Yours faithfully.</p>

<p class="typewriter">ARTHUR D. FEATHER (Inspector).</p>

<p><br> "Write and assure him that they were animals, Miss
Brandon," Gees said. "Put it in the first person, and say that
I'm surprised at his questioning it. Ask him if he thinks they
were insects&mdash;no, don't put that in, though. Just that I'm
surprised, and they were animals. Of the wolf family, but you
needn't mention that either. Now I'll just have a look at these,
before dealing with the inquiries."</p>

<p>He put down Feather's letter and opened one of the envelopes
he held. A pink slip fluttered down from the letter he took out
and unfolded, and he inspected the slip first and handed it to
the girl.</p>

<p>"I'll endorse it for paying in presently," he said. "Hold
on."</p>

<p>And he began to read:</p> <br>

<p class="typewriter">Dear Green.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Among other things, you forgot your fee. I
enclose check for 50 pounds, as agreed between us.</p>

<p class="typewriter">With regard to the suitcase and contents
that you left here this morning, could you give me some
instructions? Do you wish the case repacked and sent to your
London address? I hope that is your wish, and that you do not
intend to return here, as, in spite of the great weight you have
lifted from my mind, on the one hand, on the other what I saw
this morning makes me wish never to see you again. I think of
going abroad for a year or two.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Thanking you for all you have done.</p>

<p class="typewriter">Very truly yours.</p>

<p class="typewriter">PHILIP LESLIE TYRRELL.</p>

<p><br> "Aha!" Gees said. "Take a letter, Miss Brandon. 'Dear
Tyrrell, many thanks for yours with enclosure. I shall be glad if
you will repack and send the suitcase to me at this address, all
charges forward. Your decision to go abroad is a good one. Yours
faithfully.' And stick on a twopenny stamp for me to sign across,
Miss Brandon&mdash;let us by all means be formal and correct. Now
the next."</p>

<p>He opened it, and found two letters inside. After glancing at
both he began on the longer of the two:</p> <br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Green.</span></p>

<p class="letter">"I am sorry that your departure from Odder was
so sudden that we had not the pleasure of seeing you again. I
have just had a long talk with Tom Cotton, who told me all that
he knows of what you did at Locksborough, and what you saw in the
fire. He saw it too, he tells me&mdash;in confidence, since
Inspector Feather has ordered him to keep his mouth shut. I can
only suppose that, with the directing will gone, the bodies
gradually returned to their normal shapes, and that you burned
them only just in time. I can see no other explanation.</p>

<p class="letter">Already, with the knowledge that the beasts are
destroyed, the whole atmosphere of the place is different. There
is relief evident in the looks and voices of men and women alike,
and the children play and go about again happily. We owe you
much, and if you come this way again, you will find a very
sincere welcome awaiting you from us all. I trust that you will
find your way here, and that we may have the pleasure of
entertaining you to the best of our ability.</p>

<p class="letter">Madge, who is posting this, is putting in a
letter of her own to you, she tells me. As for the rest of us,
you have our very warmest regard, and our wishes&mdash;my
prayers, too&mdash;for success and happiness in your career and
all your life.</p>

<p class="letter">Sincerely yours.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Walter E. Amber</span>.</p>

<p><br> "Stout feller," Gees murmured. "I'll answer this myself.
One more, and then we'll look at the inquiries."</p>

<p>He unfolded Madge's letter.</p> <br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">George, dear.</span></p>

<p class="letter">I saw you go off in the car&mdash;my bedroom
window looks out at the back&mdash;but I naturally thought you
were going back to Dowlandsbar. And you drove off in that awful
suit, apparently to London! George, you're iniquitously careless
of yourself.</p>

<p class="letter">When daddy told me of last night and what you
had done, I just thanked God for keeping you from harm.</p>

<p class="letter">Although you wouldn't stop to say good-bye, I'm
still happy over our drive, every minute of it. Shall ever see
you again, I wonder?</p>

<p class="letter">Over what you asked me about Philip Tyrrell,
when I told you it was quite impossible and still mean it, we
hear <i>via</i> the Annie-Jenny news service that he is putting
in an elderly married cousin of his, complete with wife, and
going quite away, probably for a long time. But the sheep will
remain, now, and Tom Cotton and his Effie will see Mrs. Nevern's
baby toddle round.</p>

<p class="letter">George, don't quite forget.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Madge</span>."</p>

<p><br> Gees got off the corner of the desk.</p>

<p>"I'll answer these to make sure of the country post, Miss
Brandon," he said. "The inquiries can come next."</p>

<p>Back in his own room he wrote:</p>

<p>"Madge, dear.</p>

<p>"Some time, by what your father told me, you will be in London
again. I want you to write and promise that you will let me know
in good time, and that you will not go back without seeing me. My
flight from Odder&mdash;your father would understand it, I feel
sure, and so will you, when I tell you.</p>

<p>"Yes, we shall meet again. Bless, you, dear.</p>

<p>"GEES (<u>not</u> George!).</p>

<p>"P.S. I am sending the suit to be cleaned."</p>

<p>He folded the letter, put it in an envelope, and wrote the
address. Then he took another sheet of paper and began writing to
Amber.</p>
