  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <p class="first">Nigh upon fifty winters ago, there was growing up in the
  North a boy named Halfred. In Iceland, on the Hamund Fjord, stood the
  splendid hall of his father, Hamund.</p>

  <p>At that time, so the heathen people believe, elves and goblins still moved
  about freely among the Northern nations. And many say that an elf, who had
  been friendly to the powerful Hamund, drew near to the shield cradle of the
  boy Halfred, and for his first food laid wild honey upon his lips, and
  said&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Victory shall be thine in harping&mdash;<br>
  Victory shall be thine in singing&mdash;<br>
  Sigskald shall all nations name thee."</p><br>

  <p>But this is a mere idle tale of the heathen people.</p>

  <p>And Halfred grew, and was strong and beautiful. He sat often alone on the
  cliffs, and listened how the wind played in rifts in the crags, and he would
  fain have tuned his harp to the same strain, and because he could not do it
  he was filled with fury.</p>

  <p>And when this fury swept over his forehead the veins in his temples
  swelled, and there came a red darkness before his eyes. And then his arm
  sometimes did that whereof his head knew nothing.</p>

  <p>When his father died Halfred took the seat of honour in the hall. But he
  took no heed to preserve or improve his inheritance. He gave himself up to
  harp playing and feats of arms. He devised a new strain in singing,
  "Halfred's strain," which greatly charmed all who heard it, and in which none
  could imitate him. And in hatchet throwing, not one of the men of Iceland
  could equal him. He dashed his hammer through three shields, and at two
  ships' lengths he would not miss with its sharp edge a finger broad arrow
  shaft.</p>

  <p>His mind was now set upon building a dragon ship, strong and splendid,
  worthy of a Viking, wherein he might make voyages, to harry or levy toll upon
  island and mainland, or to play his harp in the halls of kings.</p>

  <p>And through many an anxious night he considered how he should build his
  ship, and could devise no plan. Yet the image of the ship was always before
  his eyes, as it must be, with prow and stem, with board and bow; and instead
  of a dragon it must carry a silver swan on the prow.</p>

  <p>And when, one morning, he came out of the hall, and looked out over the
  Fjord, towards the north, there, from the south-south-east, came floating
  into Hamund's Bay a mighty ship, with swelling sails. Then Halfred and his
  house-churls seized their weapons, and hurried out either to drive away or
  welcome the sailors. Ever nearer drove the ship, but neither helmet nor spear
  flashed on board, and though they shouted through the trumpet all was still.
  Then Halfred and his followers sprang into the boat, and rowed to the great
  ship, and saw that it was altogether empty, and climbed on board. And this
  was the most splendid dragon ship that ever spread sail on the salt seas. But
  instead of a dragon it bore a silver swan upon the prow.</p>

  <p>And moreover also, Halfred told me, the ship was in all things the same as
  the image he had seen in his night and day dreams; forty oars in iron
  rowlocks, the deck pavillioned with shields, the sails purple-striped, the
  prow carved with runes against breakers, and the ropes of sea-dogs' skin. And
  the high-arched silver wings of the swan were ingeniously carved, and the
  wind rushed through them with a melodious sound.</p>

  <p>And Halfred sprang up to the seat of honour on the upper-deck, upon which
  lay spread a purple royal mantle, and a silver harp, with a swan's head,
  leaned against it.</p>

  <p>And Halfred said&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Singing Swan shalt thou be called, my ship;<br>
  Singing and victorious shalt thou sail."</p><br>

  <p>And many said the elf who had given him his name had sent the Singing Swan
  to him.</p>

  <p>But that is an idle tale of the heathen people. For it has often happened
  that slightly anchored ships have broken away in storms, while the seamen
  were carousing ashore.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <p class="first">And forthwith it became known that Halfred had armed the
  best of his house churls, and his followers, with good weapons, to set forth
  as a Viking to conquer, and as a Skald to sing.</p>

  <p>And over the whole of Iceland, and the islands all around, there was much
  talk about the Singing Swan, which "Oski"[1] himself&mdash;that is the god of
  the heathen people&mdash;had sent to Halfred Hamundson. "He is the son of
  Oski; nothing shall miscarry with him, be it man's hate, or woman's love, in
  sword thrusts, or in harp playing; great treasure and rich Skald rewards
  shall he win, and his gentle hand can take and spend, but keep nothing."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[1. "Oski," in reality one of the special forms of Odin,
  is, in the Scandinavian mythology, the god who fulfils all the desires of
  men.]</p>

  <p>And now there came many, drawn to him by the wish to be his sailing
  comrades, even from the furthest islands of the western sea, so that he could
  have manned seven ships. He manned, however, only the Singing Swan, with
  three hundred men whom he chose himself, and with them he set sail upon the
  sea.</p>

  <p>And now there would be much which might be told about the great victories
  which Halfred won, through many long years, with hammer and harp, on all the
  seas from Mikilgard&mdash;which the Latins call Byzantium&mdash;even to the
  island of Hibernia, in the far west.</p>

  <p>And of all these feats and victories, voyages and minstrelsy, and contests
  of arms and harp playing, had I, as a child by the cloister hearth, heard the
  Skalds sing, and wandering guests recount, long before I looked into
  Halfred's sea-grey eyes.</p>

  <p>For during the long time that he was wholly lost sight of, and the Singing
  Swan had vanished in flames, and all people held Halfred for dead, the Skalds
  composed many songs about him. But that was later.</p>

  <p>At that time Halfred thus roamed about everywhere, singing and triumphing,
  winning fights at sea, and contests in palaces. And because he was victor
  over all the Skalds in singing competitions, the people named him "Sigskald,"
  and from that, the heathen people, prophesying backwards, invented, perhaps,
  that fable about the elf which had given him honey, and his name, in the
  cradle.</p>

  <p>And he amassed great spoils, and many hundred rings of red gold, and gave
  them all away again to his sailing comrades. And yet he still heaped up rich
  hords upon the Singing Swan; and brought also much treasure to Hamund's hall,
  where he was wont to pass the winter.</p>

  <p>And he splendidly improved the hall, and built over against it a great
  Mead hall, in which a thousand men could drink: and six steps led to the seat
  of honour in the Mead hall.</p>

  <p>But the most costly thing among all his spoils was a
  candelabrum&mdash;"Lampas" the Greeks call it&mdash;half as high as a man, of
  pure gold, with seven flaming arms, which far away, in the land of Greece, he
  had borne away from a marble city that he had burned.</p>

  <p>And this treasure Halfred himself prized highly, who otherwise cared
  nothing for gold. And at the Yule feast, and the Midsummer feast, and at all
  high festivals, it must stand close before him upon the table, with its
  sevenfold flame.</p>

  <p>But that at which everyone wondered most was, that all people who saw
  Halfred, and heard him sing, seemed to be forced to be friendly to him. It
  often happened that even the Skalds whom he vanquished in song contests,
  themselves conceived great love for him, and praised his strains more than
  their own.</p>

  <p>But this is truly the most incredible thing that can be told of Skalds.
  Compared to this it is a small thing that a wooer whom he had supplanted in a
  woman's favour should become his friend and blood brother. But that was
  later.</p>

  <p>And, indeed, because everything seemed miraculous, those heathen people
  invented that legend that he was the son of Oski, and that therefore neither
  men's wrath nor maiden's pride could withstand him; that a god was throned
  upon his forehead, who dazzled all eyes; with many more such fables.</p>

  <p>Above all they say that his smile could conquer all hearts, as the
  midsummer sun melts the ice.</p>

  <p>And about this also they tell a story.</p>

  <p>That is, that once, in the depth of winter, he found at the foot of
  Snaeja-Tjoell, a little maiden of five years old, nearly frozen to death. She
  had strayed from her mother's cottage, and could not find the way back.</p>

  <p>And although Halfred was very weary, and had many followers with him, he
  sent them all nevertheless alone to the hall, took the child himself upon his
  shoulder, and travelled many stages further, always tracking the tiny
  footprints of the little maiden, who had fallen fast asleep, until he found
  her mother's cottage. And he laid the child in the mother's arms, and she
  woke and smiled. And the mother wished for him, as a reward, that he should
  smile henceforth like a child that sees its mother again. And this also had
  Oski granted to him.</p>

  <p>But this is a mere idle tale of the heathen people; for there is no Oski;
  and no heathen gods; and perchance also no[2] .... I say that he carried the
  child back himself, carefully, to the mother. Many a Viking would only, from
  compassion, have thrust her deeper in the snow; the best would have given her
  to one of his followers to carry to the hall. But to carry her back, himself,
  through the snow, to her mother, that would no Viking have done that I know;
  above all when he was tired and hungry.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[2. Here the parchment is pierced through, and with
  different ink three crosses are signed over the burnt out part.]</p>

  <p>I say, then, in Halfred there was great goodness of heart, such as is
  generally wont to be found alone in innocent children; and therefore his
  smile was heart-winning, as is a child's smile. And out of this, therefore,
  have the heathen people invented that gift of Oski.</p>

  <p>For that he did carry the child to the mother, that I certainly, myself,
  fully and undoubtingly believe of Halfred. And I would be the last not to
  believe it of him.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he could become suddenly very wrathful, when the veins in his
  temples swelled. Then, often, if any enemy roused him by defiance, he would
  dash, blindly raging, among the spears, like a Berseker.</p>

  <p>Over and above all this, they tell many tales of the god-like gifts which
  made maidens love him. But that is not a miracle, as it comes very near being
  that a conquered singer should love him.</p>

  <p>For he possessed a brilliant noble countenance, which no one forgot who
  had once seen it, and a heart-winning soft, yet powerful voice. He avoided
  rude jesting; and he could always divine what was the peculiar charm of every
  fair maiden's beauty; and he knew how to put it to her as a riddle, over
  which she herself had long been vainly pondering.</p>

  <p>But other riddles, also, he knew well how to find out.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <p class="first">And thus had Halfred now, for many years, roamed about as a
  Viking and as a Skald, and had won fame and red gold; and once more he again
  celebrated the Yule feast at home in his hall.</p>

  <p>And there were very many hundred men assembled there in the Mead hall
  which he had fitted up. All his sailing comrades, and very many Icelanders,
  and many foreign guests, from Austrvegr, and even from Hylmreck, and Dyflin,
  on the western sea. Among them also the Skald, Vandrad, from Tiunderland.</p>

  <p>And the Bragi cup[3] passed round, and many men vowed vows thereon, and
  many a one pledged himself to daring deeds, which he would perform before
  Midsummertide, or die. Halfred also, as well as the guests, had drunk a great
  deal of mead; more than he was wont to drink, as he himself, afterwards,
  earnestly told me.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[3. Cup sacred to Bragi, the god of poetry. At the Yule
  feast the heathen were wont, while the Bragi cup was passing round, to pledge
  themselves by vows to the performance of deeds of special danger or renown.
  They swore upon the Bragi cup, or upon the boar's head, which was the
  principal dish of the feast.]</p>

  <p>And this also the heathen point to in him as a miraculous gift of his
  father Oski; that he could drink far far more than other men, in
  fact&mdash;and they hold him therein very lucky&mdash;as many horns full as
  he chose, without the heron of forgetfulness[4] sweeping through his dizzied
  brain.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[4. A poetical expression of the Edda for the beginning
  of drunkenness.]</p>

  <p>But this is foolishly said, for even I can scare away the heron, if I,
  after each draught, think quietly to myself, and do not propose many toasts;
  for such attract the heron.</p>

  <p>Halfred had now certainly emptied many horns; but as yet he had vowed no
  vow. Silent and grave he sat in the seat of the honour, as befitted the host;
  exhorted the tardy drinkers&mdash;there were not however many of
  them&mdash;by sending the cup bearer to them, with the drinking horn; and
  smiled quietly, when many a one vowed vows which he would never fulfil.</p>

  <p>Then arose from his seat Vandrad the Skald, from Tiunderland, and stood
  upon the second step of the dais, and spoke. Halfred had vanquished him five
  times, and yet the Skald was a faithful loving friend to him&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Vows have here been now vowed by many<br>
  Guests of small worth.<br>
  But Halfred, the Lord of the mead hall,<br>
  Still holds his thoughts hidden.<br>
  I laud him, most lofty,<br>
  No vows hath he need of,<br>
  His name may content him.<br>
  Yet I miss in the mead hall<br>
  One thing to the mighty,<br>
  To the man is awanting<br>
  A maiden to wife.<br>
  What rapture if only,<br>
  From the high seat of honour,<br>
  The horn to us, downward,<br>
  The dazzling white hand<br>
  Of the nobly born Princess,<br>
  Harthild, should hold."</p><br>

  <p>All the guests kept silence when Vandrad had spoken. Halfred looked
  proudly down upon him, and very gently, he told me later, he felt the veins
  in his temples swell, as, smiling, he asked the Skald&mdash;but it was the
  smile of a king, not a child's smile&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"And what then of Harthild,<br>
  Her beauty and fame,<br>
  Canst thou here sound the praise,<br>
  In Halfred's mead hall?"</p><br>

  <p>Then said Vandrad&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"For all that thou knowest,<br>
  Thou far roaming Viking,<br>
  Hast thou never heard Harthild's<br>
  Descent and renown<br>
  Proclaimed on the harp?<br>
  From Upsala's ancient<br>
  Deep rooted stem<br>
  The maiden is sprung.<br>
  Hartstein the Haggard,<br>
  Men call her father,<br>
  The powerful monarch<br>
  Of far spreading fame.<br>
  His daughter close guarded<br>
  He haughtily holds;<br>
  All wooers rejecting,<br>
  Who cannot excel him<br>
  In throwing the hammer.<br>
  And no less the maiden<br>
  All men avoideth,<br>
  Man-like her own mood.<br>
  With good cause she boasteth<br>
  Herself in deep riddles<br>
  Above all the Skalds<br>
  Skilful to be.<br>
  'Breaker of men's wits'<br>
  In dread and in envy,<br>
  They call her in Nordland.<br>
  To every wooer<br>
  Who fain her proud spirit<br>
  In wedlock would bind,<br>
  Tells she the same<br>
  Close sealed riddle;<br>
  For none&mdash;not the wisest&mdash;<br>
  Has ever yet solved it.<br>
  Then scornfully laughing,<br>
  With her sharp scissors,<br>
  &mdash;For so runs the statute&mdash;<br>
  To shame him, she sheareth<br>
  From the hero his hair."</p><br>

  <p>Then Halfred's temple veins swelled fearfully. He shook back the thick
  black locks which flowed down even to his shoulders, and drained off a deep
  drinking horn. Then he sprang from his seat, and seized the Bragi cup, on
  which vows were wont to be vowed. Once more he paused, set down the Bragi cup
  again, and asked&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"But Skald, say now, quickly,<br>
  &mdash;Oft hast thou seen her&mdash;<br>
  This men avoider.<br>
  Beautiful is she?<br>
  This breaker of men's wits,<br>
  Would the bride's wreath become her?"</p><br>

  <p>Vandrad replied&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Nor soft nor gentle,<br>
  Is she, nor lovely,<br>
  But proud and stately<br>
  Stands her tall form.<br>
  Nor could another<br>
  Carry so fitly<br>
  The crown of a king."</p><br>

  <p>Then Halfred again took up the Bragi cup, strode forward to the highest
  step which led to his seat of honour, and paused where exactly in the centre
  was burned into the oaken floor a circle, in red runes, so small that a man
  could only tread therein with one foot. Halfred kneeled down, planted his
  left foot within the circle, and lifted the Bragi cup in his right hand, high
  above his head.</p>

  <p>And all were very eager to hear what he would now say; for this was the
  strongest, the most solemn form in which vow could be vowed. And Halfred
  said&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Ere yet the on coming<br>
  Midsummer tide<br>
  Shall sink in the sea,<br>
  Will I bring Harthild,<br>
  The daughter of Hartstein,<br>
  Here as my wife,<br>
  To dwell in my hall,<br>
  Or hold me shall Hell.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Her wit-breaking sayings<br>
  Will I lay bare,<br>
  Her runic riddles<br>
  Will I unfold.<br>
  Unshamed, and unshaven,<br>
  These black locks shake freely.<br>
  Her man-despising<br>
  Maiden mood quelling,<br>
  My wedded wife<br>
  Will force her to be.<br>
  The breaker of men's wits<br>
  Will I break in.<br>
  A right noble heir<br>
  Of all that I own<br>
  She shall here, in my hall,<br>
  Soon cherish, my son.<br>
  And softly shall sing him<br>
  To sleep with the songs<br>
  Of his father's great deeds,<br>
  Or hold me shall Hell."</p><br>

  <p>Thus ended the Yule feast, at that time; for all the guests started up
  from their seats with a great uproar, in a confused throng, and drank to
  Halfred, and shouted that this was the best and most admirable vow which in
  the memory of man had been vowed in the north.</p>

  <p>And the tumult was so great that Halfred had to command silence from the
  dais, and very soon to send round the parting cup to the uproarious
  heroes.</p>

  <p>And Halfred told me that when, under the light of the stars, he crossed
  the court to his dwelling-house, he repented of his vow. Not because he
  feared King Hartstein's hammer-throwing, or dreaded his daughter's riddle.
  But because it is always wiser for a man to see a maiden, before he
  determines to make her his wife.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

  <p class="first">And so soon as the Austr-Vogen was free from ice, the
  Singing Swan sailed towards Svearike, and through numberless perils into the
  great sea which lies to the south and east of Upland; and from thence she
  followed a river, as far as there was floating depth, upwards towards
  Tiunderland, and to Upsala.</p>

  <p>And many will now believe that Halfred had a great struggle and much
  difficulty to overcome King Hartstein and his daughter, and will expect to
  hear how it came to pass.</p>

  <p>But there is nothing to tell; for everything went easily and quickly with
  him, according to his wishes, which the heathen people again boasted had been
  thus arranged by Oski.</p>

  <p>King Hartstein was, in general, a flinty-hearted man, full of suspicion,
  and short of speech. When, however, he saw Halfred, and called to him as he
  entered his hall, and drew near to the throne, and asked him&mdash;"Stranger,
  what desirest thou in Tiunderland, and of King Hartstein?"&mdash;And when
  Halfred, with that smile which Oski had bestowed upon him, looked into the
  fierce eyes, and joyously replied&mdash;"The best will I have that
  Tiunderland and King Hartstein possess&mdash;his daughter." Then the grim old
  man was at once won, and in his secret heart he wished that Halfred might be
  his son-in-law.</p>

  <p>And then they went out to the court for the hammer-throwing, and the King
  threw well, but Halfred threw far better, and thus the first trial was
  won.</p>

  <p>"Harder will thou find the second," said the old man, and led Halfred to
  the Skemma, the chamber of the women, where the breaker of men's wits, in a
  shining dark blue mantle, sat among her maidens, a head taller than any of
  them.</p>

  <p>And they say that when Halfred entered the chamber, and his glance fell
  upon her, a hot tremor passed over her, and a sudden glow dyed her cheeks
  crimson, and confused her.</p>

  <p>Certain it is that with a golden spindle, with which she had played rather
  than spun, she pricked her finger, and let it fall with a clatter.</p>

  <p>But Sudha, the foremost of her maidens, the captive daughter of the King
  of Halogaland, who sat at her right hand, picked up the spindle, and held it.
  And many interpreted this later, as a bad omen. At the time, however, it was
  hardly observed.</p>

  <p>And Vandrad the Skald said later to Halfred, that the woman had been
  elf-struck at the first sight of him: but he thereupon said
  earnestly&mdash;"It had been better had I been elf-struck at sight of her;
  but I remained unwounded."</p>

  <p>And forthwith King Hartstein assembled all his courtiers, and the women of
  the castle, and the guests, in the hall, for the riddle solving.</p>

  <p>And Harthild arose from the arm chair at his right hand, and her face grew
  crimson as she looked at Halfred, which&mdash;as they declare&mdash;had never
  before happened to her at the challenging of her riddle.</p>

  <p>She paused for a space, looked downwards, then again upon Halfred, and now
  with searching and defiant eyes. And she began&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"What is held in Valhalla?<br>
  What is hidden in Hell?<br>
  What hammers in hammer?<br>
  And heads the strong helm?<br>
  What begins the host slaughter?<br>
  What closes a sigh?<br>
  And what holds in Harthild<br>
  The head and the heart?"</p><br>

  <p>Then she would have seated herself, as was her wont after giving out the
  riddle; but struck by terror she remained standing, and grasped the arm of
  the chair; for Halfred, without any reflecting, stretched his right hand
  towards her, and spoke&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"Hast thou nothing harder,<br>
  Haughty one, hidden?<br>
  Then wreathe thy proud head<br>
  For Hymen in haste,<br>
  For what's held in Valhalla,<br>
  What's hidden in Hell,<br>
  What hammers in hammer,<br>
  And heads the strong helm,<br>
  What begins the host slaughter,<br>
  And closes a sigh,<br>
  What Harthild the haughty<br>
  The head and the heart holds,<br>
  What hovers deep hidden<br>
  In high thoughts of her heart,<br>
  And what here has Halfred<br>
  To proud Harthild holpen,<br>
  'Tis the Sacred Rune<br>
  The hero's own H."</p><br>

  <p>Then Harthild sank pale with rage in her chair, and covered her head with
  her veil.</p>

  <p>But when Hartstein, her father, drew near amidst loud cries of
  astonishment from the listeners in the hall, and would have drawn the veil
  from her face, she sprang up vehemently, threw back the veil&mdash;and they
  saw that she had wept&mdash;and cried in a harsh voice&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Well has thou solved<br>
  The hidden riddle.<br>
  With mighty wit<br>
  Hast won a wife,<br>
  Woe to thee if tenderly<br>
  Thou usest her not!"</p><br>

  <p>All kept silence, uneasy at these threatening unloving words. Halfred at
  length broke the stillness, he threw back his head, and shook his black
  locks, and laughed&mdash;"I will risk that! King Hartstein, this very day
  will I pay thee the bride's dower. When prepare we the bridal feast?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <p class="first">King Hartstein, however, wished for delay, until Hartvik and
  Eigil should have returned from a campaign. Then their reception feast and
  the marriage could be celebrated together.</p>

  <p>Hartvik was the king's son, and Harthild's own brother; and Eigil was son
  to the king's brother, and Harthild's cousin.</p>

  <p>And he would willingly have taken Harthild away as his wife, but she had
  said to him, "If thou failest to solve my riddle, thy shorn locks will cause
  thee affliction; and if thou solvest my riddle, and I become thy wife, that
  will cause thee still deeper affliction, for no love for thee dwells in my
  heart: and woe to him who without love wins me for his wife."</p>

  <p>Then Eigil sadly gave it up, although he was a good riddle solver.</p>

  <p>And when Hartvik and Eigil were returned there soon grew to be a great
  friendship between Halfred and Hartvik, and Halfred and Eigil, and both loved
  him so well that they said they would lay down their lives for him.</p>

  <p>And this between Halfred and Hartvik is no great wonder, because Halfred
  always won all men's hearts.</p>

  <p>But it may well astonish many that Eigil also should thus love him, who
  still cherished as much love to Harthild as formerly; and who yet clearly
  saw, as all who had eyes could see, that the harsh maiden was quite filled
  with love to Halfred.</p>

  <p>And jealousy does not often allow it to be admitted that the nightingale
  has a more charming voice than the carrion crow.</p>

  <p>Hartvik and Egil, however, loved Halfred so dearly that they begged him to
  receive them as his blood brothers.</p>

  <p>And on the day before the wedding feast was prepared, therefore, Hartvik
  and Eigil became Halfred's blood brethren.</p>

  <p>They stood with him, as the heathen people do, under a strip of turf,
  which was lifted on spear points above their heads, the two ends still
  cleaving to the ground, and they mixed the blood which flowed from gashes in
  their right arms down upon the black earth beneath their feet.</p>

  <p>And therewith they vowed their heads for ever to the infernal gods if ever
  one of the blood brothers should desert the other, in danger or in need. And
  so strongly does this oath bind, that even against his own kith and kin, yea
  even against his own father, must one blood brother stand by the other, even
  until death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <p class="first">On the day after the wedding, however, Halfred rode alone
  into the pine wood. He said he wished to think, and he refused Harthild, who
  would have ridden with him, and also his blood brethren.</p>

  <p>Darkly Harthild looked after him as he rode out of the court. But Sudha,
  the beautiful daughter of the King of Halogaland, also looked after him from
  an overhanging window, and slowly stroked her blue black hair back from her
  temples.</p>

  <p>Vandrad the Skald, however, who often staid at Hartstein's Court, and who
  was there at that time, had long cherished love for Sudha. And he had often
  begged her freedom from King Hartstein, but in vain; the stern man had always
  denied him.</p>

  <p>And heretofore she had not listened unwillingly when he sang. But when in
  these days he drew near to her, and spoke of a song which he had composed in
  her praise, she turned away and said&mdash;"On the lips of one only have the
  gods laid honey."</p>

  <p>And when in the evening Halfred returned from the pinewood towards the
  royal castle, he was leading his weary horse by the bridle, for the moon
  shone but fitfully through storm-rent clouds, there sat upon the runic-stone
  hard by the road a closely veiled woman, and she cried to him and
  said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Halfred Hamundson, whereof on the first day of thy marriage, ridest thou
  alone in the pinewood?"</p>

  <p>"If thou knowest that, O wise Vala," said Halfred, pausing&mdash;and he
  heaved a sigh&mdash;"then knowest thou more than Halfred Hamundson."</p>

  <p>"I will tell thee," replied the veiled one. "Thou hast sought a woman, and
  found what is nigher to a man, rough, harsh, and devoid of charm. The Singing
  Swan hath paired thee with the vulture's brood. Thou chosest the hard flint
  stone, near to it lay glowing at thy feet the rose, exhaling fragrance
  towards thee."</p>

  <p>Then Halfred sprang upon his horse, and cried to the veiled one&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nobler hold I it in a woman to be too cold, than too ardent." And he
  dashed away.</p>

  <p>And only once, as he told me, he looked back. So beautiful, he said, had
  she never before been, in the full light of day, as now in the moonlight, her
  black eyes glittered&mdash;for she had torn off her head covering&mdash;and
  she called after him by his name, "Halfred," and her blue-black hair
  fluttered round her in the night wind like a ghostly veil.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <p class="first">And when the depth of winter was passed, and the spring was
  come, Halfred sent a message to Upsala, to King Hartstein, that at the
  midsummer tide Dame Harthild should bear a child.</p>

  <p>And the wise women had thrown runic rods over her seven times, and had
  learned each time by unerring signs that the child should be a son. And
  already was his name chosen, "Sigurd Sigskaldson."</p>

  <p>And Halfred bade the king, and Hartvik and Eigil, and Vandred the Skald,
  and all the people from the castle at Upsala, as many as the ships would
  hold, to be his guests at Hamund's hall, twenty nights before the midsummer
  tide.</p>

  <p>And there, at the birth and naming of the boy, a great feast should be
  held, such as had never before been held in Iceland.</p>

  <p>And King Hartstein gave answer that he and all his people, as many as
  twelve ships could carry, would come as bidden, to the feast.</p>

  <p>Thus at the beginning of the month of roses came King Hartstein, and
  Hartvik, and Eigil, and many hundred men from the castle at Upsala; and
  people from all parts of Tiunderland.</p>

  <p>And among the women who came also, the first that descended from the ship
  was Sudha. She had begged that she might come, out of longing to see
  Harthild.</p>

  <p>And again there was close friendship between Halfred and his
  blood-brethren, Hartvik and Eigil. They shared their table and bread and
  salt.</p>

  <p>Thus they waited the birth of the heir of the hall, on the midsummer day,
  and made ready a great feast in the Mead hall.</p>

  <p>Rich hangings of silken and woven stuffs which Halfred had borne away from
  the islands of Greece were spread upon the wooden walls of the drinking hall;
  the floor was strewn deep with rushes and clean straw, and the tables and
  benches were set out in two long rows, and one cross row.</p>

  <p>On all the pillars of the walls were hung curiously interlaced weapons,
  which the Viking had gathered from boarded ships, stormed castles, and
  victorious battlefields. But on sideboards around were set out the many cups
  and horns of gold, silver, bronze, amber, and precious horn, which the
  Sigskald had won, by singing in the halls of kings.</p>

  <p>But straight before Halfred towered the lofty candalabrum from Greece,
  with its seven flaming arms.</p>

  <p>Eigil and Hartvik were to sit on his left hand, the guests from
  Tiunderland and the other strangers on the long benches to the right, the
  house churls and islanders on the long benches to the left of the dais. And
  the most honoured guests had even cushions for the back, brought from a
  pillared marble house which had been burnt on the coast of Rumaberg.</p>

  <p>The women, however, were not to come into the hall, but to tarry with
  Harthild, and await her hour in the chamber of the women.</p>

  <p>This was all splendidly ordered, and Halfred himself told me that never,
  neither as guest nor as host, had he seen such magnificent festival
  preparations.</p>

  <p>Two days before the feast, as Halfred, wearied with the summer heat, lay
  upon his couch after the mid-day meal, Sudha glided softly through the
  doorway, and stood before him, and spoke&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">"Halfred, skill in song, victory and fame have been thine
  for twenty years.<br>
  A wife hast thou had for one year&mdash;an heir shalt thou have but now.<br>
  But never hast thou known Freya's gift&mdash;Love's Fulness&mdash;<br>
  Contradict me not&mdash;thine eye shuns Dame Harthild's seeking glance;<br>
  And when thou dreamingly sweepest the strings of thy harp, thou gazest<br>
  Not in Dame Harthild's cold hard face, but upwards towards the stars.<br>
  Halfred, not in the clouds dwelleth that for which thou yearnest.<br>
  Not from the stars shall it float down upon thee; upon the earth it
  wanders,<br>
  It is a woman, who with love's charm, with woman's magic, can subdue the
  Singing Swan&mdash;<br>
  Woe to thee if thou never findest her&mdash;<br>
  What though thou win all fame with sword and harp&mdash;the best is still
  denied thee.<br>
  Askest thou what maketh me so wise, and withal so daring?<br>
  Love, love's fulness for thee, thou rich yet poor Sigskald.<br>
  Behold, I am but a woman&mdash;a captive&mdash;but I tell thee there is
  heroism even for women.<br>
  I have sworn by the infernal gods, as I crossed thy threshold,<br>
  that here, in Iceland, I will win thy love, or die."</p><br>

  <p>Then Halfred arose from his couch, and spoke&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Wisdom and madness mingled hast thou spoken. There speaks
  from thee more than Sudha. There speaks a soul stricken of the gods.<br>
  Horror and compassion seize upon me. I will demand thy freedom from King
  Hartstein. Then journey homewards to Halagoland.<br>
  There mayest thou find happiness in the arms of some valiant hero.<br>
  But here, let Dame Harthild's rights and hearth be sacred unto thee. Disturb
  not her happiness."</p><br>

  <p>And he seized his spear and strode out. But Sudha cried after him, so that
  he still heard her&mdash;"Her happiness? Long has she divined her misery.
  Soon shall she clearly perceive, the haughty one, that she is more
  unspeakably wretched than Sudha."</p>

  <p>Then, the evening of the same day, she called to her Vandrad the Skald,
  who still always cherished great love for her, to the well in the court, as
  though she would beg him to draw up for her from the depth the heavy water
  bucket. This did Vandrad later, when dying, himself tell Halfred.</p>

  <p>But when he had raised the bucket to the edge of the well, she lightly
  laid a finger on his bare arm, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Vandrad, come hither to-night, just when the star Oervandil is mirrored
  in this well. Thou shall tell me all that formerly came to pass here, about
  that oath on the Bragi cup."</p>

  <p>Vandrad considered within himself, and he looked doubtingly at her.</p>

  <p>Then she said&mdash;"Vandrad, I swear to thee by [5]Freya's throat jewels
  that I will become thy wife when I leave this island. Wilt thou now come and
  tell me all?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[5: "Brisingamene," the necklace of Freya, the goddess of
  love, was the symbol of female charm and attraction.]</p>

  <p>Then Vandrad swore to do what she required.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">And now the midsummer feast was magnificently celebrated in
  the hall. And there were full a thousand guests within the hall; but many
  hundreds of the servants and bondmen were camped round about the building, in
  the open air.</p>

  <p>Besides the guests from Svearike, there had come from all the neighbouring
  coasts and islands many jarl's and great chieftains. Thus from distant
  Iceland, the kings Konal, and Kiartan from Dyflin; from Zealand the Danish
  Jarl Hako, and Sveno from Lethra; then from West Gothaland the three
  brothers, Arnbiorn, Arngeir, and Arnolfr; Jarls of the Western Goths. There
  had long been a blood feud, which had been but newly allayed with blood
  money, between these three, and the two brothers Princes of East Gothaland,
  Helge and Helgrimr.</p>

  <p>And these two, and the other three, would only come with a strong
  well-armed following, when they understood that their adversaries had also
  been bidden to Halfred's feast.</p>

  <p>And Halfred had taken care that the followers of the Princes of West
  Gothaland should be lodged to the right, and those of East Gothaland to the
  left, at the back of the hall, in huts of pinewood. And a wooden wall with
  strongly closed doors divided the two encampments.</p>

  <p>But also from other vallies of Svearik, besides Tiunderland, from
  Tronland, from Herjadel, Jeutland, and Helsingaland, had come many guests,
  who had often of old been enemies to the people from Tiunderland.</p>

  <p>The feast, however, proceeded most joyously from daybreak even until the
  night. And when within the hall, and without, where the foreign servants were
  encamped, many fires and pine torches were kindled&mdash;before Halfred
  burned the seven armed candelabrum&mdash;it was at first a right jovial sun
  fire-feast.</p>

  <p>The men, swinging and emptying the drinking horns, sprang over the flames,
  and the Skalds, in songs which they composed at the moment they rose, vied
  with each other in praises of Halfred and his deeds with hammer and harp, and
  of the Singing Swan, and the hall, and the feast.</p>

  <p>And all the foreign kings also proclaimed that never had they seen so
  lordly a midsummer feast celebrated, neither at home, nor in the halls of any
  other host.</p>

  <p>Halfred sat with a joyful heart in the seat of honour. He signed to his
  harp-bearer to bring him his silver harp, for he wished at the last, to
  requite the laudations of the Skalds and the praises of the guests with
  thanks and a song of welcome.... And then began that catastrophe which was to
  overwhelm Halfred and his house, and the men of Tiunderland, and all the
  guests, and many other men and women, altogether strange and far away, who
  had never even seen or heard of Halfred and Harthild, in blood and fire.</p>

  <p>That is to say, the great door of the hall, exactly opposite to the seat
  of honour opened, and Dame Harthild strode in.</p>

  <p>Haughtily erect she walked, her head thrown back. A long black mantle was
  wrapped around her head and neck and breast, and her whole body; it floated
  trailing after her, like the curling wave behind a ship's stern.</p>

  <p>And Halfred said to one it seemed to him, then, as if the most fearful of
  the Fates was striding through the hall.</p>

  <p>Straight up the hall she passed, followed by Sudha and her women, her
  glance fixed upon Halfred.</p>

  <p>Slowly, silently, she ascended the six steps of the dais, and paused
  straight before Halfred at the table. Only the heavy candelabrum stood
  between the two.</p>

  <p>But all the men in the hall sat speechless, and gazed up at the black
  woman, who looked like a dark thunder cloud.</p>

  <p>"Halfred Hamundson," she began&mdash;and her voice was loud, yet
  toneless&mdash;"Answers I demand to two questions, before these ten hundred
  hearers in thy hall. Lie not to me."</p>

  <p>The blood rose to Halfred's brow, and he felt his temple veins throb
  heavily. "If I speak or act," he said to himself, "I know neither what I
  should say nor do. Therefore I will keep silence and do nothing."</p>

  <p>But Harthild, with her left hand pressed upon her thigh,
  continued&mdash;"Didst thou, in that first night, when I held thy hand firm
  upon my girdle, and asked thee if thou lovedst me, say Yes or No? Answer me
  Sigskald. I and the gods know about that."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Halfred, and knitted his brows.</p>

  <p>"And is it true, as Vandrad the Skald has sworn, that here, in this hall,
  at the Yule feast, after many horns of mead, thou didst vow, as a wanton
  wager, that before the midsummer tide, thou would break in the breaker of
  men's wits like a stubborn horse, and that to make good these boasting words
  thou camest to Tiunderland, and remained, as thou didst lament, unwounded at
  sight of me."</p>

  <p>"Speak the truth&mdash;lie not again&mdash;a thousand listeners hear
  thee&mdash;thou lordly son of Oski&mdash;Is it so?"</p>

  <p>Then Halfred raged in his inmost heart, but he constrained himself, and
  replied firmly and distinctly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is as thou hast said."</p>

  <p>Then Harthild drew herself up yet higher, and like two serpents flashed,
  glances of fearful hatred from her eyes, as she spoke&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"So be thou accursed, from the crown of thy head to the sole
  of thy foot, thou who hast deceived and disgraced a hapless woman;<br>
  Cursed be thy proud thoughts&mdash;Madness shall strike them;<br>
  Cursed be thy false eyes&mdash;Blindness shall smite them;<br>
  Cursed be thy lying Ups&mdash;They shall wither and smile no more;<br>
  Cursed be thy flattering voice&mdash;It shall be dumb;<br>
  Thy house and thy hall shall perish in flames&mdash;The Singing Swan shall
  burn;<br>
  Thy hand shall be crippled&mdash;thy hammer not strike&mdash;thy harp shall
  shatter; Victory shall be denied thee in battle and in song;<br>
  Nothing shall any more delight thee, in which of yore thou hast rejoiced;<br>
  The sun of spring&mdash;the flowers of the forest&mdash;the fire of
  wine&mdash;the blackbird's song&mdash;the greeting of the evening
  star&mdash;Sleepless shall roll thy groaning head, and if slumber draws near
  to thee it shall be with stifling dreams.<br>
  Yet a twofold curse shall rend ye both, if thou winnest again a woman's
  love.<br>
  In madness and disease shall she perish whom thou lovest more than thy
  soul.<br>
  But the son whom I, wretched one, must bear, shall be his mother's avenger
  upon his father.<br>
  Liar's son, Scoundrel's son, Harthild's Vengeance shall his name be.<br>
  And one day, villain, shall he smite thee, as here, to shame thee before all
  men, my hand now strikes thee in the face."</p><br>

  <p>And she lifted high her outspread right hand, and aimed a blow over the
  table at Halfred's head.</p>

  <p>Halfred sprang up, and to avert such a disgrace threw up his left arm.
  Then he struck the heavy seven flaming candalabrum; with a crash the metal
  fell with all its flaming arms upon Dame Harthild's breast and body, and then
  upon the ground.</p>

  <p>As though struck by lightning stood the woman all in flames&mdash;mantle
  and hair blazed up. At once the fire caught the straw thickly strewn upon the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"King Hartstein, avenge thy unhappy child," shrieked Harthild, in agony.
  She believed that in rage Halfred had hurled the candalabrum upon her.</p>

  <p>The king believed the same, and whilst Halfred grasped at the blazing
  woman to rescue her, Kling Hartstein with a cry of "Down thou scoundrel,"
  struck him a sharp sword stroke on the forehead, so that he fell stunned.</p>

  <p>And with a second blow he would have slain him, had not Eigil and Hartvik
  sprung up and quickly borne away their blood brother.</p>

  <p>Thus it came to pass that from the very outset Halfred could neither avert
  nor control this catastrophe&mdash;He alone could have done it.</p>

  <p>Now, however, the burning woman and the flaming straw filled everyone with
  sudden frenzy.</p>

  <p>The people from Tiunderland rose up in fury when they saw their king's
  daughter fall flaming on the crackling straw; and Halfred's comrades drew
  their swords when they saw their lord fall bleeding. And flame and smoke,
  shrieks of women, and avenging shouts of men filled the hall.</p>

  <p>Then broke loose a fighting and devastation in the hall so gigantic, say
  the heathen people, that the like shall never be seen again until the
  twilight of the gods, when all demons and giants, goblins and elves, gnomes,
  menkind, and pigmies, shall slay each other, and heaven, earth and hell shall
  perish in flames.</p>

  <p>Harthild in her burning clothes, was carried out by her shrieking women.
  One only was missing. Sudha sprang through flames and arms to where Halfred
  lay on his blood-brethren's knees.</p>

  <p>"Dead," she cried; "Slain by Sudha. Then share we death, if not life." And
  she drew Halfred's dagger from his belt, and plunged it in her own
  breast.</p>

  <p>"Slain Halfred! by my babbling tongue. Sudha slain!" cried Vandrad the
  Skald. "I will avenge thee, Halfred."</p>

  <p>And he tore a casting spear from the trophies hanging on the
  flame-wreathed wooden pillars, and hurled it whistling at the temples of King
  Hartstein, so that he fell dead.</p>

  <p>Wildly shouted the people of Tiunderland, and their near kindred from West
  Gothaland, for vengeance for Harthild and King Hartstein.</p>

  <p>And the Jarl Ambiorn, from West Gothaland, seized in both hands a heavy
  brazen double-handled tankard, and dashed it down on Vandrad's forehead, so
  that he fell.</p>

  <p>But when the Princes from East Gothaland saw this, that their mortal foes
  aided the men from Upsala, then they fell, Helgi and Helgrimr, with furious
  blows upon both their old enemies, and the guests from Upsala.</p>

  <p>And now could none any longer give a thought to extinguishing the blazing
  straw upon the floor, or the quickly burning silken and woollen hangings on
  the walls or the wooden pillars, up which tongues of flame were creeping.</p>

  <p>For blindly now flew spears and axes, and golden and silver drinking
  horns; and many who would have striven for peace, or trodden out the flames,
  had fallen, struck down by both sides.</p>

  <p>"Must we alone stand idle among the strange guests at this bloody
  midsummer feast?" said the Danish Jarl Hako, to the Irish King Konal, "so
  that the Skalds shall taunt us as drink valiant but battle shy. We have an
  old strife about stolen horses. Let us fight it out here, thou Irish
  Greenpeak!"</p>

  <p>"Thou drunkard of Zealand," was the answer, "I will quench for ever thy
  thirst and thy reviling;" and he struck his broad short Irish knife through
  his teeth into his throat.</p>

  <p>Then Sveno, his brother, fell furiously upon the Irish king, and their
  followers, Danes and Irish, fought by themselves their own battle in the
  forefront of the hall, and thus blocked up the door, so that no one could
  escape from the hall into the open air.</p>

  <p>And those who had no weapons tore down the trophies from the pillars, or
  hurled about the heavy drinking horns, and even the flaming beams and blocks
  which already fell from the ceiling, and instead of shields they defended
  themselves with the tables.</p>

  <p>And all wildly mingled fought the people of Tiunderland and Iceland, of
  Westgothaland and Eastgothaland, of Zealand and Ireland. And hardly did
  anyone know who was friend or foe; and many, many men sank down, wounded or
  burnt.</p>

  <p>And at last the flames had burst through the roof, and shot blazing up
  towards heaven.</p>

  <p>And as the wind from above blew down upon the swelling hangings on the
  walls, they flashed up suddenly in a brighter blaze.</p>

  <p>And now the highest beam fell with a crash; and thereupon rang out a sound
  as though forty harp strings had all at once uttered their dying wail. And it
  was even so, for the beam had severed in twain Halfred's silver harp, which
  lay close by his head.</p>

  <p>At this wailing harp cry Halfred opened his eyes, and looked around him,
  and all the truth broke upon him. He sprang up and shouted threateningly
  through slaughter and flames&mdash;Hartvik and Eigil protected him with
  shield and sword&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hold! Peace, peace in the hall! Magic has frenzied us all! Quench, quench
  the fire which devours us all!"</p>

  <p>And so great was his power over friends and foes that for a moment all
  paused.</p>

  <p>Then hark! From without there thundered on the hindmost door of the hall
  heavy axe strokes, and the cry&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Halfred, Halfred, save thy house! Save the Singing Swan!"</p>

  <p>With a crash the door fell inwards, and new devastation was seen, which
  kindled afresh the momentarily smothered battle fury in the hall.</p>

  <p>Halfred looked through the doorway. The house of his forefathers, and the
  ships in the harbour, and the Singing Swan were all wrapped in flames.</p>

  <p>The followers of the princes of Westgothaland, who were lodged in the pine
  huts, had first heard the din of battle, and seen the flames in the hall. "To
  the rescue&mdash;to the rescue of our lords," they shouted, tore down the
  wooden wall that divided them from the Mead hall, and hurried to their
  aid.</p>

  <p>But then there threw themselves upon them, to hinder them, their hostile
  neighbours, the followers of the princes of Eastgothaland, who being too weak
  to hold the open field, retreated partly into Halfred's dwelling house,
  partly to their ships in the Fjord.</p>

  <p>With shouts of triumph the victors followed, crowded with the fugitives
  into Halfred's dwelling house, and stormed the ships in the bay; and dwelling
  house and ships were suddenly wrapped in flames, either set on fire by the
  combatants, or ignited by sparks and burning splinters, borne by the strong
  south wind from the roof of the Mead hall.</p>

  <p>Halfred threw one glance at his shattered harp, and the burning house of
  his fathers; then he grasped his hammer firmer, and cried&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Come hither to me all Halfred's comrades. Quit the hall. Save the
  Swan!"</p>

  <p>And with a mighty onslaught, swinging his hammer round his head, he burst
  through the ranks of the men who had already renewed the battle in the
  hall.</p>

  <p>Hartvik and Eigil followed on his track, and many of his own people, and
  also of the enemy.</p>

  <p>But those who did not leave the drinking hall with him were almost all at
  once numbered with the dead. For with a heavy crash, close behind Halfred,
  fell the whole burning roof into the hall.</p>

  <p>Halfred glanced back in his rapid course. High upwards shot the blaze,
  mingling with sound of shrieks from hundreds slain. Then all was silent in
  the midsummer feast hall.</p>

  <p>Halfred rushed on, followed by friends and foes, past his father's house.
  He saw the flames creeping up the pillars; within rose the din of raging
  conflict; on the threshold lay a slaughtered servant girl.</p>

  <p>Soon Halfred and his comrades reached the bay, where the battle surged
  around the high-decked ships. Many were burning. Many dragon's heads seemed
  to vomit fire and smoke.</p>

  <p>Around the Singing Swan, however, raged the battle most furiously. In
  dense masses the enemy thronged round her, wading, swimming, in boats and on
  rafts, they crowded on; others hurled spears and arrows from the shore at her
  defenders, and more than one burning arrow had struck and set fire to
  her.</p>

  <p>The left wing of the ingeniously carved Swan was on fire; tongues of fire
  were creeping up ropes and sails&mdash;just as Halfred arrived they caught
  the mast.</p>

  <p>Then grief and fury seized upon him. His temple veins swelled almost to
  the size of a child's finger.</p>

  <p>"Quench, quench the flames! All hands on deck! Save the Swan! Cut the
  anchor-cable. Put out to sea. Fight no more. I will fight for you all."</p>

  <p>His faithful followers obeyed him. The seamen left off fighting, and
  laboured only to quench the flames, in which also they soon succeeded, as no
  more arrows flew from the land, and the foe were forced to leave the
  ship.</p>

  <p>For Halfred raged furiously, as none had ever seen him fight. With a loud
  battle-cry he sprang upon the people of Westgothaland and Tiunderland, and
  struck them down one after another.</p>

  <p>Loyally aided him Hartvik and Eigil, his blood brethren, and spared not
  even their own countrymen and kindred; but thought rather on the blood oath
  which bound them more closely to Halfred than to their own kinsmen.</p>

  <p>And the foe fell back before Halfred and his comrades, from the open field
  into the dwelling house, which was half burned down, and barricaded it.</p>

  <p>And thus he stormed his own house, in which the people from Westgothaland
  had before overcome the house churls and the East Goths, and slain them
  all.</p>

  <p>Yet a whole hour lasted the conflict. There Halfred, on the threshold of
  his house, slew the Danish Jarl Sveno, the last chieftain of the enemy who
  still lived, and pressed into the house with his men.</p>

  <p>The people from Westgothaland, Zealand, and Tiunderland, defended
  themselves like bears at bay. But at last they were all slain. And from
  thence Halfred returned to the Mead hall, which was still glowing, and
  searched who there still lived.</p>

  <p>But there, also, all were dead.</p>

  <p>And they found the bodies of King Hartstein, and Sudha, and of the Dane
  Hako, and the two Irishmen, Konal and Kiartan, of the Eastgothic Prince
  Helge&mdash;Helgrimr had fallen on board ship&mdash;and of Arngeir and
  Arnbiorn&mdash;Arnolfr had been slain in the dwelling house&mdash;and they
  found Vandrad the Skald at the point of death.</p>

  <p>Then he told Halfred how Sudha had prevailed upon him to speak, and begged
  him to forgive him the death of so many heroes. And Halfred held his hand
  until he was dead.</p>

  <p>But Dame Harthild's body they did not find, although many of her women lay
  burnt or slain in the dwelling-house.</p>

  <p>But many bodies were so burnt and charred they could not be
  recognised.</p>

  <p>And then they turned their search to the ships.</p>

  <p>And all the ships of the foreign guests were burnt, and all those of the
  Icelanders which lay in the bay. For at the last, by reason of Halfred's
  furious attack, no one had thought any more about extinguishing them.</p>

  <p>And Halfred, with his trumpet, hailed the Singing Swan, which floated
  saved in the moonlight, and went on board with his little troop.</p>

  <p>And there lay slain many hundreds of Halfred's Icelanders,</p>

  <p>The foreign guests, however, who had come to the midsummer feast, lay all
  all dead, save only Hartvik and Eigil.</p>

  <p>And Halfred counted when he called all hands before the mast still seventy
  men alive.</p>

  <p>All the rest had fallen in that one midsummer night. And there fell after
  that wild tumult an awful stillness upon land and sea. And sad and silent
  floated the Singing Swan, with scorched sails, upon the Fjord.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <p class="first">And Halfred has sunk into deep deep silence. Since the fight
  had ended, and he had heard Vandrad's dying words, he had not spoken a
  word.</p>

  <p>But when it was full daylight the Singing Swan drew near the land, and the
  men came ashore.</p>

  <p>Silently Halfred signed to his sailing comrades to carry out all the
  bodies from the drinking hall, the dwelling-house, and the ships; and to
  collect them altogether on the shore. He had seven funeral piles erected, and
  upon these all the dead were burned with their weapons. The ashes, however,
  of friends and foes Halfred ordered them to mingle.</p>

  <p>And these he poured himself into a great stone-lined grave which he had
  had dug on the shore, hard by the water line. And he had earth heaped thickly
  upon them, and a huge black block of stone which had once been thrown out of
  Hekla rolled thereon. And this cost many days work.</p>

  <p>But Halfred spoke not. And all through the nights he sat upon the grave
  and looked now upwards to the stars of the summer night, now downwards
  rigidly upon the earth, and the stone grave. And gently gently he oftimes
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>But he spoke no word.</p>

  <p>And when after seven nights the sun arose, Hartvik and Eigil drew near to
  him, as he sat upon the stone, and then Hartvik spoke&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Halfred, my blood brother, a great calamity has befallen to
  thee, to me, to us. Father and sister and many friends have I lost, and Eigil
  has also lost many who were dear to him. We must bear it, all three. Come,
  Halfred, Sigskald, arouse thyself! This silence and brooding is evil.
  Dwelling-house and Mead hall the fire has burnt&mdash;the axe will build them
  up. Harps, there are many still upon the earth, and the Singing Swan spreads
  out her hardly singed pinions. Come, Halfred, drink! Here I have brought thee
  from the Greek spoils of the Singing Swan a cup of Chios wine, which thou
  ever lovedst. Drink, speak, and live!"</p><br>

  <p>Halfred stood up with a sigh, took the cup from Hartvik's hand, and poured
  the wine slowly upon the grave; the earth drank it greedily in.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Come hither again about midnight. Then will I give ye an
  answer. I cannot even yet think clearly. Once more will I ask the gods who
  dwell in the stars if they even yet deny me an answer."</p><br>

  <p>And he sat down again upon the stone, and covered his face with his
  hands.</p>

  <p>And when about midnight the two came, Halfred pointed towards the
  heavens&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">"There are so many thousand thousand stars, but they are all
  dumb to me.<br>
  Unceasingly, for seven days and nights, have I asked myself, and asked the
  stars, wherefore have the Gods allowed this awful thing to happen?<br>
  Is it a crime that I vowed a vow, such as many which are vowed in the
  north?<br>
  Hundreds of women had heard it without resentment.<br>
  Is it my crime that Dame Harthild was differently minded?<br>
  And it was no lie that I bore love to her, on that night.<br>
  Love's fulness truly it was not&mdash;as Sudha named it.<br>
  That may be. Never knew I love's fulness.<br>
  And be it so. If the Gods hate me for an evil deed, wherefore do they not
  punish me alone?<br>
  Wherefore let others&mdash;so many others&mdash;suffer and atone for
  <i>my</i> sin?<br>
  Wherefore should King Hartstein perish, and many other princes, and thousands
  of men from all coasts and islands?<br>
  Wherefore should Dame Harthild perish, whom they would have avenged, and our
  unborn son?<br>
  How have all these sinned? Answer me, ye two, if ye know more than do I and
  the stars?"</p><br>
  <br>

  <p>But his blood brethren were silent, and Halfred continued&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Yet there must be Gods!<br>
  Who has else bound the giants, calmed the sea, levelled the earth, arched the
  heavens, and strewn the stars? Who else guides the battle? and how, after
  death, come mighty heroes to Valhalla, and the evil to the dark serpent
  hell?<br>
  For that awful fearful thought which already from afar has come darkly into
  my mind, that perhaps no Gods live! I will think it no more.<br>
  There must be Gods. I cannot cannot think otherwise, and my throbbing brain
  is driven to frenzy.<br>
  And if there are Gods, they must be also good, and wise, and mighty, and
  just.<br>
  Else it would be indeed yet more frightful to think that beings, mightier and
  wiser than mankind, delighted in the misery of men, like an evil urchin who
  for sport impales a captured beetle.<br>
  This, therefore, one dare not think,&mdash;neither, indeed,&mdash;that there
  are no Gods, or that there are evil Gods.<br>
  And therefore will I in devout submission endure this awful calamity, waiting
  till, in the course of years, I guess this riddle also. So hard an one was
  never yet set before me.<br>
  But ye, ye faithful ones, who stood by me to the death, and spared not your
  own kindred, and have lost your nearest through me; ye will I never forsake,
  all my life long; and great gratitude will I bear ye, and my dearest shall ye
  be for evermore. For ye alone will I live."</p><br>

  <p>Then spake Hartvik&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Not thus must thou speak, Halfred. The harp thou shalt
  again strike victoriously, the hammer shalt thou again joyously wield under
  the blue heavens of Greece. The blood of the vine shalt thou quaff, and a
  woman more enchanting than&mdash;&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>Then Halfred sprang up from the black stone&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Silence, Hartvik: Thou blasphemest.<br>
  Who is stricken so heavily as I, by the hatred of the Gods, who live and are
  just, he stands as a lightning-blasted tree by the way. Birds sing not upon
  it, the dew moistens it not, the sun kisses it not.<br>
  How should I sing and laugh, drink and kiss, through whom hath fallen upon so
  many thousand men and women utter destruction, or the sorrow of death for
  evermore?<br>
  No, otherwise have I vowed to myself.<br>
  Long did I doubt if I still could live, after such a calamity as the Gods
  have laid upon this head, and I could not, did I not believe in good Gods,
  and tarry for the solving of this riddle.<br>
  But joy and happiness have no more part in Halfred Hamundson. I renounce them
  for ever."</p><br>

  <p>And he kneeled down, and took from his breast pouch a leathern bottle,
  which was filled with white ashes. And slowly he strewed them all over his
  long flowing black locks, and his face, and breast, and body.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Hear me, ye good all ruling Gods, and ye glittering all
  seeing stars of heaven; and of men-kind upon earth, Hartvik and Eigil, my
  blood brethren!<br>
  Here I renounce, on account of the awful calamity which I have drawn down
  upon wife and child, and many hundred friends and strangers, I renounce for
  ever happiness and joy, song, wine, and the love of women.<br>
  To the dead alone, slain for my crime, with whose ashes I here cover myself
  upon their grave mound, do I belong; and among the living, to my faithful
  blood brethren.<br>
  And if I break this solemnly sworn vow, then be Dame Harthild's curse wholly
  fulfilled."</p><br>

  <p>And the stars and his friends in silence heard his vow.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <p class="first">And Halfred kept his word.</p>

  <p>Year after year passed away&mdash;he told me he no longer knew how often.
  Meanwhile midsummer returned&mdash;and Halfred lived a life which was as a
  living death.</p>

  <p>Hartvik and Eigil commanded the Singing Swan, and ruled their sailing
  comrades. They chose the design, the port, and the course of their voyages.
  Halfred without word, wish, or choice, let everything be.</p>

  <p>Only, when the south wind grew too strong for Hartvik's hand, Halfred
  strode silently to the helm, and steered until the sea was calm again.</p>

  <p>Also, when Vikings attacked the ship, Halfred had forbidden that the
  Singing Swan, either by sea or land, should do harm to any&mdash;and the
  danger became overwhelming, Halfred silently&mdash;he raised the battle cry
  no more&mdash;grasped his hammer, and dashed among the enemy until they gave
  way.</p>

  <p>But he wielded his hammer only with his left hand&mdash;his shield he had
  laid aside&mdash;and neither with helmet nor mail did he protect his head and
  breast.</p>

  <p>And throughout the whole year he wore the garment which on that midsummer
  night smoke, flame and blood had darkly dyed.</p>

  <p>When the Singing Swan drew near the land&mdash;the black flame marks on
  the wings none were allowed to efface&mdash;and Hartvik and Eigil and the
  sailors went to the halls of kings, Halfred stayed lying upon deck, and kept
  guard over the ship.</p>

  <p>And he drank only water out of a cup of the bitter juniperwood.</p>

  <p>Eigil brought once, from a king's halls where the Sigskald of yore had
  often been a guest, a splendid golden harp, which the queen, in greeting to
  her old friend, had sent as a present.</p>

  <p>But as the ship turned out of the bay the harp, with a light rush, glided
  into the sea.</p>

  <p>And once Halfred lay at midsummer in Iceland, on the shore by the black
  stone&mdash;for every midsummer night he spent alone there, his friends must
  remain on the ship&mdash;and looked very very sad. For his face had grown
  very pale.</p>

  <p>Then there came a woman, and a wonderfully beautiful maiden, who was her
  daughter, and stood before him; and he turned away his face, but the mother
  spoke&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"I know thee, even yet, Halfred Sigskald. I can never forget
  thy face, although the smile of Oski no longer plays thereon, and though the
  furrows on thy brow are deeply scored as with a plough. This maiden dids't
  thou, fifteen years ago, lay in my arms a sleeping child. See how beautiful
  she has become, as no other in all Iceland. And this wreath of summer flowers
  has she twined for thee. Set it upon thy pale brow, and thou shalt be healed,
  for gratitude has woven it."</p><br>

  <p>Then Halfred sprang up, took the wreath from the beautiful blushing
  maiden's hand, lifted with mighty force the huge block upwards, threw the
  wreath under it, and let the black stone fall heavily in its place again.</p>

  <p>The mother and maiden, weeping, departed.</p>

  <p>And during these years Halfred spoke hardly to any, save Hartvik and
  Eigil, and to them only when he must.</p>

  <p>And what he said was weak and mournful.</p>

  <p>And his voice had become very low.</p>

  <p>And he was very kind to everyone, above all to those below him.</p>

  <p>And often in the night the sailors heard him sigh, and turn himself upon
  the straw bed upon the deck, where always, even in the cold winter, he lay
  under the stars.</p>

  <p>And they heard him often speak when there was no one at hand with whom he
  could talk.</p>

  <p>And at table he rested his head upon his left hand, and kept his eyes cast
  downwards, or looked into the far far distance.</p>

  <p>And he almost never complained, only he often shook his head gently, and
  pressed very very often his left hand upon his breast, and said many
  times&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The fresh air of heaven shuns me. I cannot breathe. If I will breathe I
  must sigh. My heart is almost crushed."</p>

  <p>And Hartvik and Eigil said one to the other&mdash;"He is ill."</p>

  <p>And once, when they sailed to Greece, Hartvik secretly called a
  physician&mdash;they are very skilful there&mdash;and the physician watched
  Halfred many days and nights, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is a heavy malady under which this poor man suffers.</p>

  <p>"And many have already quietly died of it, or sunk into madness.</p>

  <p>"We call it 'Melancholy.'"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <p class="first">And the Singing Swan sailed again into the western seas, in
  the late spring and early summer, at the time which the Latins call "Mensus
  Madius."</p>

  <p>And because of the long voyage the provisions were exhausted, and the ship
  also needed rest and repairing.</p>

  <p>And Halfred's blood brethren said to him, when they came into the waters
  of the island of Hibernia&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Both men and stores need caring for: we will land at King Thorul's sea
  castle, and provide all that we need on board. Far famed is King Thorul's
  hall; there they have great skill on the harp. Come with us to the city;
  rejoice thy heart in human fellowship, for there thou cans't not, as
  heretofore, lie upon the ship. Even to the Singing Swan will many people
  come, workmen and traders, and thou wouldst not be alone under thy stars.
  Shall we not steer for the green island?"</p>

  <p>And Halfred nodded, and Hartvik joyfully turned the helm sharp to the
  west.</p>

  <p>When, however, they saw the towers of Thorul's hall rise from the waves in
  the morning light, Halfred, with his own hand, lowered the smaller boat,
  which lay fastened on the deck near the helm, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When ye have rejoiced yourselves at King Thorurs court, and have provided
  for the ship, seek me, after twenty nights, on yonder small rocky
  island."</p>

  <p>And he took arrow, and bow, and fishing hook, sprang into the boat, and
  rowed to the island.</p>

  <p>But, the Singing Swan sailed further to the west.</p>

  <p>And Halfred landed upon the small rocky island; he found a fitting bay,
  and drew his boat high up upon the white sand of the shore.</p>

  <p>And then there came floating to him on the air something which was strange
  and yet well known to him. Only under the golden stars of Greece and Rome had
  he ever heretofore enjoyed the intoxication of such fragrance.</p>

  <p>There is, that is to say, a flower of the delicate hue of a maiden's
  cheek, "Rosa" the Latins call it, and its fragrance is as the kiss of pure
  maiden lips.</p>

  <p>And this flower had the Roman heroes, so long as they were powerful in
  these western lands, carefully tended in their houses and gardens. Long
  since, however, had the Roman heroes vanished, their stately dwellings were
  abandoned and ruined, their gardens grown wild.</p>

  <p>And wild also had grown the maiden tinted flower which they call Rosa, and
  had spread all over the island, and flourished luxuriantly everywhere, and
  breathed forth a strong intoxicating perfume.</p>

  <p>On these small islands which lie round about the great western island of
  Hibernia, the air is always mild; the snow seldom there remains lying on the
  land, and only slightly, and for a short time are the streams frozen.</p>

  <p>And the singing birds which elsewhere retreat before the frost, rest for
  the winter in these retreats, where meadows, shrubs, and trees, remain green
  even in the severest seasons. For it rains often there, and moist is the
  breath of the billows rolling around.</p>

  <p>And the heathen people, therefore, call these islands "Baldur's Islands,"
  for Baldur they name the God of the spring dawning.</p>

  <p>And as Halfred climbed up the hill from the shore, all the underwood and
  sweet-springing thorns were in full bloom; white thorn and red thorn and
  black thorn and the wild roses.</p>

  <p>And also the many splendid fruit trees which the Roman heroes had brought
  with them from the south and the east, were in full bloom.</p>

  <p>And from every shrub and tree resounded the sweet tones of the grey brown
  singing bird, which the Latins call "Luscinia," the Greeks "Philomela," but
  we, the "Nightingale."</p>

  <p>And Halfred strode upwards and inland, by the side of a clear rapid
  stream, which flowed over white pebbles, through light green copsewood. On
  the height he came to a transparent copse of alders, young beeches, and
  slender white birches. There lovely broad-winged butterflies flitted over the
  beautiful flowers in the sunny glades. Deep in the thicket sang the thrush.
  The tops and pliant boughs of the birches nodded and waved.</p>

  <p>And then there came to him, borne on the morning wind, yet other sounds
  than the song of the nightingale, far clearer and softer, as from the
  lightly-touched strings of a harp; but which sounded far more beautiful than
  any harp playing, either of his own or any other Skald, which he had ever
  heard.</p>

  <p>And from high above, as if from heaven, the tones appeared to come.
  Halfred followed the sounds, which powerfully moved and allured him.</p>

  <p>No sound since the last dying shriek of his harp had reached his soul
  through his ears. These harp tones aroused his soul. He believed that elves
  or Bragi, the song God, were harping in the air.</p>

  <p>He wished not to scare the singer, but to listen. Softly he passed on,
  choosing his steps; the wood-grass betrayed him not, for it was soft, long,
  and thick.</p>

  <p>He had now come quite near to the sound, yet still he saw not the singer.
  Cautiously he parted the thick white thorn bushes, and perceived then a small
  green mound, upon which stood in a circle six beeches. But the seventh, the
  tallest, stood in the centre, and towered above them all; and around its
  trunk wound an ornamental staircase made of white wood; and made of the same
  white wood there was a slight platform fitted in where the broad branches of
  the beech spread themselves out. The railing of both staircase and platform
  was ingeniously carved.</p>

  <p>From this airy bower floated down the wonderful tones.</p>

  <p>Halfred drew nearer, and spied through the branches and the crevices of
  the platform. His heart throbbed high with amazement, awe, and yearning.</p>

  <p>There he saw the player.</p>

  <p>On the railing leaned a boy who was wonderfully beautiful, so beautiful,
  Halfred said to me, that never had he seen such beauty upon earth&mdash;so
  beautiful as the elves must be, in which the heathen people believe.</p>

  <p>He was altogether white&mdash;his slender face was white as the stone
  which the Greeks call "Alabaster;" the folded garment which reached from his
  neck to his knees was white, and white were the leathern shoes upon his
  feet.</p>

  <p>But the eyes and hair of the boy were like gold.</p>

  <p>And Halfred said to me that the eyes were the golden brown of the eagle's
  eyes. In the shining hair, however, which a net of the same colour confined,
  instead of a hat, played hither and thither, bright sun-tinted gleams, as
  though a sunbeam had lost itself therein, and now vainly sought to find an
  outlet.</p>

  <p>And the boy played upon a small three-sided stringed instrument, such as
  only the Skalds of Hibernia carry, and played a wholly unknown melody.</p>

  <p>And he played and sang so beautifully, that Halfred had never yet heard
  such playing and singing; mournful and yet blissful at the same time, was the
  melody, like the pain of yearning, which yet for no pleasure of the earth
  would the heart resign.</p>

  <p>And Halfred told me that for the first time since that midsummer night a
  warm breath passed again over his soul.</p>

  <p>And the beautiful boy in the airy bower enchained his eyes, and the
  mournful yearning song entranced his soul.</p>

  <p>And for the first time, for many, many years, his breast could heave with
  a full drawn breath.</p>

  <p>And tears filled his eyes, and restored and healed him, and made him young
  once more, like cool dew upon the heath after a burning sun.</p>

  <p>And at the close of every two lines the words of the song rang
  harmoniously together, like&mdash;and yet again not altogether entirely
  like&mdash;as though two voices sought each other in sound and echo.</p>

  <p>Or as when man and woman, one and yet two, are folded together in a
  kiss.</p>

  <p>The boy sang in the soft lisping Irish language, which Halfred well knew.
  But that closing concord had he never heard, and it resounded far more
  pleasingly upon the ear than did the dead consonant staves of the Skalds.</p>

  <p>And this was the boy's song,&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"On light slender branches blowing<br>
  White rose yearns through May's young bloom&mdash;<br>
  Sun God, 'tis for thee I'm glowing,<br>
  When wilt thou, thy bright face showing,<br>
  Quaff full deep my fresh perfume?<br>
  When wilt thou, for ardour sighing,<br>
  Greet my flowers in trembling bliss?<br>
  Come, and must I rue thee dying,<br>
  Leave within my chalice lying,<br>
  Fiery sweet, thy fervid kiss."</p><br>

  <p>Here closed the boy's song and playing with a clear resounding chord on
  the strings.</p>

  <p>And as soon as he ceased, and had hung his harp on the boughs, lo! there
  came flying from the nearest shrub two snow-white doves, which lighted one on
  the right, the other on the left shoulder of the boy, who smiling stroked
  their heads, and slowly, thoughtfully, with stately, and yet almost timed
  step, came down the white wooden stairs, and stood upon the beautiful flowery
  turf of the greenwood glade.</p>

  <p>Halfred dreaded that he might terrify the gentle harper if he stepped
  suddenly out of the thicket before him.</p>

  <p>Therefore he called to him first, from a distance, in a soft voice, slowly
  drawing nearer.</p>

  <p>"Hail, gentle boy! If thou art mortal, may the Gods be gracious to thee.
  If thou art thyself a God, or as I surmise one of the light elves, then be
  not ungracious to me, a mortal man."</p>

  <p>Then the boy turned slowly towards him, without seeming to be terrified,
  or even surprised, and as Halfred now drew nearer, he said in a melodious
  vibrating voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Halfred. Art thou come at last? I have tarried long for
  thee."</p>

  <p>And he offered him both hands; the glance of the golden eyes sinking deep
  into Halfred's soul.</p>

  <p>Halfred, however, dared not to touch those hands. He felt, from the very
  depths of his being, a quickening warmth uprise, and send rippling through
  body and soul a quiver of delight&mdash;of joy in surpassing beauty&mdash;but
  also of holy awe, as in the presence of gods or spirits; for he had no longer
  any doubt that it was no earthly being who stood before him.</p>

  <p>Voice and breath almost failed him as he asked&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who hath proclaimed to thee Halfred's coming, and name!"</p>

  <p>"The moonlight."</p>

  <p>"Then art thou indeed, as I had already perceived, the prince of the light
  elves, to whom moon and stars speak words. Be gracious to me, O loveliest of
  the Gods."</p>

  <p>Then the boy smiled. "I am a child of earth, like thyself, Halfred. Draw
  nearer. Take my hands."</p>

  <p>"But who art thou, if thou art mortal!" asked Halfred, still
  hesitating.</p>

  <p>"Thoril, King Thorul's orphan grandchild."</p>

  <p>"And wherefore dwellest thou here alone, on this small island, as though
  hidden, and not in King Thorul's hall?"</p>

  <p>"He dreamed thrice that danger threatened me, in the month when the wild
  roses blow; a strange ship which should come into his harbour would carry me
  away, never to be seen again.</p>

  <p>"To render me quite safe against this danger he sent me here to this small
  outlying island, at which, because of its circling cliffs, no ship can land.
  Only Mo ngal, his ancient armour-bearer, and his wife, my foster-mother, are
  with me; yonder, in that small wooden house, behind the beech mound, we live.
  But so long as the dear lord shines, and the gay butterflies flit over the
  flowers, I tarry here in hidden airy bower."</p>

  <p>"But, thou wonderful boy, if thou art really a child of earth, how could
  the moon reveal to thee my coming and my name?"</p>

  <p>"I sleep not in the moonlight, because it entices me out and upwards. It
  lifts me by force from my couch, and upwards to itself. With closed eyes,
  they say, I wander then away on the narrowest ridges of the roof; and far
  away, through forest and mountain, I see what shall happen in the future, and
  the distance.</p>

  <p>"Carefully they guarded me, therefore, in the king's hall. But here, the
  clear moon looks freely through the rifts in our cottage roof.</p>

  <p>"And I saw, seven nights ago, a ship, with a swan on the prow, that drew
  nearer and nearer. On the deck lay sleepless a dark-bearded man, with a noble
  countenance. 'Halfred,' his two friends called him.</p>

  <p>"And ever nearer floated the sailing Swan. But when, one cloudy night, the
  moon shone not upon my pillow, and my eyes could not see the ship, and the
  man, then yearning seized upon me for that noble countenance. And I laid my
  pillow and my head, since then, ever carefully under the full flood of the
  moonlight. And night after night I gazed again on that lofty forehead and
  these palid temples.</p>

  <p>"But still more beautiful and lordly art thou, than thy dream picture; and
  never have I seen a man to equal thee."</p>

  <p>"But thou," cried Halfred, seizing both the singer's hands, "art like
  Baldur in spring beauty, gentle boy.</p>

  <p>"Never have I seen such perfect charm in youth or in maiden. Like sunshine
  upon chilled limbs, like Chios wine through parched throat, flows thy beauty
  through my eyes deep into my soul. Thou art as the blackbird's song and the
  wood flowers: as the evening star in golden clouds; thou art as the most
  wonderful song which ever resounded from the lips of a Skald; thyself, as
  thou livest and movest, thou art pure poetry.</p>

  <p>"O Thoril, golden boy, how gentle thou art! how thou hast quickened my
  grief-worn heart. O Thoril, leave me never again!</p>

  <p>"Take up once more thy magic harp; uplift once more that sweet song, which
  has awakened my soul from the sleep of death.</p>

  <p>"O come, let me lay my heavy head upon thy knee, and gaze in thy sunny
  wondrous face, while thou tunest thy harp, and playest and singest."</p>

  <p>And thus they both did.</p>

  <p>And trustfully flew one of the doves from Thoril's hand to Halfred's broad
  shoulder, and cooed lovingly to the other.</p>

  <p>And when the song was ended, Halfred seized again the two hands of the
  boy, and drew them slowly slowly over his forehead, and his moist eyes.</p>

  <p>And it all was as it stands written in the sacred books of the Jews, of
  the King full of sadness and heaviness, who could only be healed by the
  harp-playing of the son of Jesse.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

  <p class="first">And this lasted many days; and upon Halfred's forehead the
  lines and furrows disappeared, one after another. And once more he could draw
  a deep full breath without sighing.</p>

  <p>And he carried his head again proudly erect, when he did not purposely
  bend down to look into the golden eyes of the boy, which ever again and again
  he did.</p>

  <p>And so much did Halfred dread to lose Thoril again, that he never left his
  side the live-long day. And because Thoril's couch and sleeping chamber were,
  as he said, so small that Halfred could not share them, he lay before the
  door upon the threshold.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he still could not sleep; but now, because with ardent
  yearning he listened to the breathing of the sleeper. And with the earliest
  dawn of morning he would rouse Thoril from sleep and his sleeping
  chamber.</p>

  <p>And it seemed as if the old gift of Oski was given back to Halfred, the
  winning of all hearts. For the two guardians of the boy, who full of mistrust
  had seen the strange man approach their cottage, holding Thoril's
  hand&mdash;the ancient Mo ngal had rushed at him with a spear&mdash;were at
  once gentle and won, when he begged, with the old smile of Oski&mdash;"Let me
  be healed at Thoril's golden eyes."</p>

  <p>But on the thirtieth day&mdash;the time when the Singing Swan should come
  for him was long passed, but Halfred thought not of that&mdash;the two went
  out with hooks and lines to catch fish. For Mo ngal's provisions were
  exhausted.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the island lay a dark lake, surrounded by steep high
  cliffs. But from the lake a streamlet flowed to the open sea. In a small boat
  they could row upon this lake, and down the streamlet to the sea. And there
  were many splendid fish called silver salmon in the lake, and in the stream,
  and even down in the salt sea.</p>

  <p>And Halfred and Thoril rowed over the lake the whole morning, and laid
  ground hooks and nets.</p>

  <p>And when, towards mid-day, the heat burned more and more fiercely down
  upon them, Halfred said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Come away from this shadeless depth. There above, on the cliff, I see
  falling the glittering spray of a silver rill&mdash;amidst alders, amidst
  wild roses it springs. There above, it is cool and shady. Easily shall we
  find a grotto in the rock. I long for that fresh spring water. And there
  above, to the left, nod dark sweet berries&mdash;they quench the thirst, and
  young boys love them. Let us climb up. I will gladly aid thee."</p>

  <p>And slowly they climbed the steep face of the cliff. Thoril now aided, now
  followed by Halfred.</p>

  <p>Then there floated to them, half-way up to the fountain, a strong perfume
  from a hollow linden tree, like wine, but it was wild honey which the
  wood-bees had gathered there.</p>

  <p>And Thoril dipped his forefinger deep in the bright thick mixture, and
  laid it upon Halfred's lips, and smiled at him, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Take it. It is very sweet."</p>

  <p>And most enchanting he looked.</p>

  <p>Then Halfred exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Such honey, so say the people, the Gods have laid upon my lips. Try if it
  is true."</p>

  <p>And he suddenly clapped Thoril's head, which was bent down towards him,
  with both hands, and kissed him on his full lips.</p>

  <p>Then both started asunder. A burning glow shot through Halfred's frame.
  But Thoril turned away his face, quivering slightly, and rapidly climbed up
  the cliff.</p>

  <p>Halfred paused, and drew a deep breath&mdash;</p>

  <p>Then he followed.</p>

  <p>"See, Thoril," cried Halfred halting, "this cavern, hollowed by the elves
  in the rock. The thick thorn bushes, with the perfumed red flowers, almost
  hide the entrance; and see there, how the brown nightingale on her nest
  guards the small doorway, and how the honey bees swarm around. Here will we
  stop and rest as we descend, when we have drunk above."</p>

  <p>But Thoril made no answer, and climbed more quickly upwards.</p>

  <p>They had still some fifty paces to climb upwards to the edge of the cliff
  whence the spring water fell in silver spray. Halfred was surprised that
  henceforward the boy went steadily on, turning his back to him, and if he
  sought to aid him in climbing, held on his course without looking round.</p>

  <p>Fiercely beat the noontide down upon the cliff; all around was deep
  silence; only blue flies darted buzzing through the sunshine, and from high
  in the heavens sounded often the shrill cries of soaring falcons, which with
  outspread pinions circled over their heads.</p>

  <p>They had now mounted so high that far away over the small island they
  could see, on three sides, beneath and around them, the blue sea appear.</p>

  <p>And the sea encircled the blooming island with its dark steel-blue arm,
  like a mail-clad hero a blooming women.</p>

  <p>But from the far west drew near a white sail.</p>

  <p>At last they had reached the height. Thoril stood above, hard by the
  waterfall, where scarcely could a pair of human feet find standing room upon
  the wet slippery crumbling stone.</p>

  <p>Beneath him, some five feet lower, Halfred halted, and looked towards him.
  "Give me to drink, I am parched with thirst," he cried to him.</p>

  <p>And Thoril drew from his fishing pouch a curved, silvery shining, mother
  of pearl shell. He raised himself on tiptoe, filled the shell to the brim,
  and turned to reach it down to Halfred. Then his foot slipped on the polished
  stone, vainly he tried to save himself, spreading out his arms on the bare
  rock wall. Halfred saw him falling downwards, straight upon himself, and
  opened wide his strong arms to receive the light burden. But lo!&mdash;a
  miracle. In the rapid fall the buckle broke which fastened over the breast
  Thoril's white linen garment; wide outspreading, down over the shoulders,
  fell the garment; at the same moment fell the net which confined the golden
  hair&mdash;a rich flood of waving tresses spread themselves over the shining
  neck and swelling breast.</p>

  <p>"A woman art thou? a maiden?" shouted Halfred exultingly. "Thanks to ye, O
  stars. Yes; this is Love's fullness."</p>

  <p>And the beautiful maiden hid her glowing cheeks in Halfred's neck.</p>

  <p>With a few strides he bore his light burden down to the grotto they had
  passed in climbing, and bending the branches of the rose bushes aside placed
  her safely within its shelter. The nightingale, which there sat singing on
  her nest, flew only to a short distance; and then returned and sang and
  warbled unceasingly. And the bees flew humming among the wild roses.</p>

  <p>And when the crimson glow of the evening sun shone over the island Halfred
  and Thoril descended the cliff. And now the girl's face was infinitely more
  beautiful than of yore. She wore her hair no longer in the net, but waving
  freely, so that like a mantle spun of threads of sunny gold it covered her
  from her throat to her knees. And instead of the lost buckle a small spray of
  the thorn bush, with a full blown rose, fastened her garment over the
  breast.</p>

  <p>Thus, hand in hand, they descended to the lake, and then Thora took from
  the boat her three-sided harp, and thus they wandered down by the streamlet
  which flowed from the lake to the sea, and on to the bay, towards the
  west.</p>

  <p>And the ship, which from the west had held her course towards the island,
  was the Singing Swan.</p>

  <p>There, at a short distance, she now lay at anchor in the bay; her sails
  shining brightly in the evening light. And the ship's boat glided over the
  water towards the shore, to bring Halfred and the smaller boat, rowed by
  Hartvik and Eigil.</p>

  <p>And the blood brethren sprang on shore, and marvelled greatly, when they
  saw Halfred stand there, hand in hand with a wonderfully beautiful woman.
  Silently their glances questioned him.</p>

  <p>But Halfred spoke, twining his arms round the slender girl&mdash;</p>

  <p>"This is Thora the golden-eyed. King Thorul's daughter.</p>

  <p>"She was hidden from me here, and clad in boy's clothing that I might not
  find her.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless I have found her, according to the course of the stars and
  the will of the Gods&mdash;Love her as myself&mdash;for she is my wife."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">And now it was very wonderful to see what a wholly different
  man Halfred had became since he had won Thora.</p>

  <p>He threw off his tattered clothing, and clad himself in the most costly
  royal raiment of scarlet and rich gold, which lay stored away as a special
  treasure among the spoils of the Singing Swan.</p>

  <p>He quaffed the sparkling Chios wine from a silver cup, and eagerly pledged
  Thora in Freya's love.</p>

  <p>He played often upon her harp, and sang new songs far more beautiful and
  ardent, and moving according to a melody which he invented, and called
  "Thora's melody."</p>

  <p>And his youth seemed to be given back to him, for the deep furrows
  vanished from his forehead, his eyes, which had always been cast down, as
  though he revolved the past, or his own thoughts, now looked brightly upwards
  again, and around his lips again played joyously the smile of Oski.</p>

  <p>And he stirred not night or day from his young wife's side; and was never
  weary of stroking her long golden hair, or looking deep into her golden
  joyfully glistening eyes.</p>

  <p>But in the night he often held her high aloft in his arms, and silently
  showed her to the silent stars.</p>

  <p>And he had himself seized the helm, to turn the Singing Swan towards the
  south, for he said, "Thora shall see the islands of the blest, in the blue
  Grecian waters, where marble statues, white and slender as herself, look out
  from among evergreen laurels."</p>

  <p>And the flame marks on the Swan's wings were effaced, and mast and spars
  must always be wreathed with flowers, for Thora loved flowers.</p>

  <p>But the young wife had eyes for Halfred alone. She spoke but few words;
  but with sweet smiles she often whispered&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes, verily, thou art the Son of Heaven. Mortal men, such as I have often
  seen in my father's hall, could never be at once so strong and so gentle.
  Thou art like the sea a furious irresistible God, and withal a lovely
  dreaming child."</p>

  <p>And when she glided across the ship, all in snow white garments, and with
  her golden flowing hair, the men on the rowing benches sat with oars
  suspended, and Hartvik, at the helm, forgot to guide the ship's course, and
  followed her steps with wondering eyes.</p>

  <p>And when they drew near to land, and the people saw her hovering on the
  wings of the Singing Swan&mdash;where she loved to stand&mdash;they brought
  offerings of flowers, for they believed that Frigg, or Freya, had sailed in
  to visit them.</p>

  <p>And Halfred told me that she grew more beautiful from day to day.</p>

  <p>And in this wise passed four times seven nights.</p>

  <p>And Halfred was so infatuated and absorbed in Thora, that he did not in
  the least observe what was brewing among the sailors, or how his blood
  brethren, who held themselves aloof from him, whispered together.</p>

  <p>He heard once, as he remembered afterwards that Hartvik whispered to
  Eigil, "No I tell thee. He will never do it himself, or by free will.
  Therefore the physician must by force burn out the wound from the
  sufferer."</p>

  <p>He neither noticed nor understood these words. But soon afterwards he
  understood them.</p>

  <p>One clear moonlight night Halfred and Thora had already sought their couch
  in their chamber between the decks, from whence a small gangway and flight of
  steps led upwards, and Thora had fallen asleep. Ere Halfred fell asleep
  however, it seemed to him as though he detected that the Singing Swan was,
  very slowly certainly, but perceptibly turning. She groaned, as though
  resisting the pressure of the helm; and he thought that he heard, through the
  open gangway, the sound of many steps upon the deck, and of whispering
  voices, and now and again of weapons clashing.</p>

  <p>Instinctively he glanced towards the head of the couch; where his hammer
  hung, guarding his bride's pillow. The loop was empty. The hammer was
  missing.</p>

  <p>Quickly, but lightly, so as not to wake the sleeper, he sprang up the
  narrow stairs. He was just in time. Hartvik and Eigil were in the act to
  close the small trap door, which fastened over the gangway with a bolt, and
  thus confine the pair between decks. There, now, stood Halfred, his right
  foot on the deck, his left on the highest step. Hartvik and Eigil started up,
  and drew back a pace. Hartvik was leaning upon Halfred's hammer. The ship's
  crew stood armed in a half circle behind him. The helm also was surrounded by
  armed men, and had been turned. The ship no longer sailed towards the
  south-east, but held west north-west, and the sails were half-reefed.</p>

  <p>"What do ye here my blood brethren?" said Halfred, softly&mdash;for he
  thought of Thora&mdash;and was more amazed than angry. "Are ye mad, or have
  ye grown faithless."</p>

  <p>For a while all were silent, startled at Halfred's sudden appearance, whom
  they had believed to be sleeping soundly by Thora's side. But Hartvik
  recovered and spoke&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is not we who are mad, or have grown faithless, but thou, our unhappy
  brother, under magic spell. We would have accomplished what must be done
  without it being possible for thee to hinder it. Thou shouldst only have
  trodden the deck again, when, against thine own will, thou wert restored to
  health.</p>

  <p>"Now, however, since thou hast too soon learnt this, hear what we, thy
  blood brethren and the most of those on board, assembled in ship's council,
  last night resolved&mdash;resolved for thy weal, although many opposed it,
  and would first have spoken with thee. Submit thyself peaceably, for it is
  unalterable as the course of the stars, and although thou art very strong,
  Halfred Hamundson, bethink thee, thou art weaponless, and we are
  seventy."</p>

  <p>Halfred was silent. Fearfully swelled his temple veins; but he thought of
  Thora. "She sleeps," he whispered. "Say softly what ye have to say. I
  listen."</p>

  <p>"Halfred, our dear blood brother," continued Hartvik softly. "Thou liest
  spell bound in the toils of a woman who&mdash;I will verily not revile her,
  for I love her more ardently than my own heart's blood&mdash;whatever she may
  be, a mortal woman undoubtedly is not.</p>

  <p>"Here works one of the strongest spells which ever witchcraft wove, and
  ever befooled the senses of men.</p>

  <p>"I blame her not as do many of our comrades.</p>

  <p>"She can do no otherwise. This is her very nature.</p>

  <p>"She is in truth an Elfin woman, or what the Irish call their white half
  Goddesses.</p>

  <p>"In the old Sagas it is told that there are such magic women, who, whether
  they will or not, wherever they come, bewitch the eyes and hearts of all men.
  In Herjadal lived such an one, seventy years ago, and there was no peace in
  the land until they had hung a mill stone about her neck, and sunk her where
  the Fjord is deepest.</p>

  <p>"That this woman is no mortal woman can any one see who only looks once in
  her white face, through which all the veins shine blue, and in the selfish
  glittering golden eyes. This alone were enough, without that which many among
  us have seen; how, lately, when the moon was full, she rose unperceived from
  thy side, and floated up upon deck and with closed eyes danced up and down
  upon the slightest wing feathers of the Singing Swan, like an elf in the moon
  rays. And when the moon went behind a cloud she glided just as lightly down
  to thee.</p>

  <p>"But this is the smallest part of her magic.</p>

  <p>"Not thee alone has her beauty ensnared. She hath so crazed all the ship's
  crew that they forget work and duty to gaze after her as she floats
  along.</p>

  <p>"Yes, even among us, blood friends, hath she kindled frightful sinister
  thoughts against thee, and against each other. I, who care not for women, and
  Eigil, who never thought of any woman save my burnt sister, we have lately by
  night confessed to each other that this silent white elf woman hath so
  fearfully crazed our senses, that each of us has already wished thy death,
  yes, would even have contrived it, in order to win this golden haired
  enchantress.</p>

  <p>"And when we confessed these same thoughts to each other, we were filled
  with shame.</p>

  <p>"Yet nevertheless each of us has plotted the death of the other.</p>

  <p>"There must be an end of this.</p>

  <p>"This slender sorceress shall not make men murderers in their thoughts,
  who have stood together through fire and blood.</p>

  <p>"We will not throw her overboard, as many of the crew in superstitious
  terror advise. Where would be the use? She would swim like a sea bird on the
  tops of the waves. But we will bear her back to the lonely island, where no
  eye of man can see her, and where no doubt wise gods had banished her. We
  would all possess her, and none shall have what each covets."</p>

  <p>Frightfully throbbed the veins in Halfred's temples, in his rage. "The
  first," he said, quite softly, through his gnashing teeth, "the first who
  lifts a hand, ay even a look towards her, I will tear his false heart from
  his living body."</p>

  <p>And so frightfully threatening was his face to behold that Hartvik and all
  the armed men drew back a couple of paces.</p>

  <p>But Eigil stepped forward again, and spoke in a louder voice than Hartvik
  had used.</p>

  <p>"Halfred, give way. We have sworn it. We will compel thee."</p>

  <p>"Ye compel me!" cried Halfred, also now in a louder voice. "Murder and
  revolt on board the Singing Swan! What saith the Viking code? Like a dog
  shall he hang by the neck at the mast head who secretly stirs up disobedience
  to the ship's lord."</p>

  <p>"To the ship's lord, yes, when madness crazes him not," shouted Eigil
  again.</p>

  <p>"Darest thou to speak of rights, Halfred Hamundson?</p>

  <p>"Only because madness and magic excuse thee, have we not long since
  asserted our rights against thee: thou, who every word and bond of right hast
  broken. We demand our rights. But thou hast no right to that woman.</p>

  <p>"Hast thou forgotten, Perjurer, that bloodstained midsummer night on
  Hamunds Fjord? Of that, in truth, thou hast not spoken, since, like a love
  sick boy, thou hast doted on this slender sorceress.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast forgotten it, but the seamen who sail by yonder spot, they see
  with horror the huge black Heckla Stone which there hides an awful
  catastrophe, and covers a fearful curse. But huge and heavy as it is, it
  cannot bury it. Demanding vengeance the shades of many thousand dead arise,
  who lie there, through thy crime, and with whom thou hast broken faith and
  oath.</p>

  <p>"For how did'st thou swear in that night?</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Here I renounce, on account of the awful calamity which I
  have drawn down upon wife and child, and many hundred friends and strangers,
  I renounce for ever happiness and joy, song, wine, and the love of women. To
  the dead alone, slain for my crime, with whose ashes I here cover myself on
  their grave mound, do I belong, and among the living to my faithful
  blood-brethren. And if I break this solemnly-sworn vow, then be Dame
  Harthild's curse wholly fulfilled."</p><br>

  <p>"But thou carest no more for Gods or men, no more for us thy
  blood-brethren, who stood by thee to the death; who kept faith with thee
  against our own kindred; who defended thy head against King Hartstein's sword
  when thou layest defenceless as a child upon our knees; who for thee have
  slain our nearest kindred; for thee have given up sister and beloved.</p>

  <p>"Her also, whose voluptuous lips have kissed forgetfulness upon thy
  forehead, even her also has thy selfishness forgotten; for thou wilt bring
  destruction upon her, as surely as the Gods hear curses, and chastise
  perjury.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless thou hast never told the white armed enchantress what a fearful
  curse thou, with each kiss, art drawing down nearer and nearer upon her
  head."</p>

  <p>"Silence, Raven," cried Halfred, threateningly, paling with rage and
  dread.</p>

  <p>But Eigil continued, "Who knows if the golden eyes would not turn
  shuddering from thee did she know that upon thy head rests the curse of the
  wedded wife, burned through thee&mdash;of thy unborn murdered son. And thou
  hast exposed her as well as thyself to the fearful sentence&mdash;it will be
  fulfilled, for unerring is such deadly hate:</p>

  <p class="quote">'Cursed be thy proud thoughts&mdash;Madness shall strike
  them;<br>
  Cursed be thy false eyes&mdash;Blindness shall smite them;<br>
  Cursed be thy lying lips&mdash;They shall wither and smile no more;<br>
  Yet a twofold curse shall rend thee both, if thou winnest again a woman's
  love.<br>
  In madness and disease shall she perish whom thou lovest more than thy
  soul.'"</p><br>

  <p>Here sounded a faint soul-harrowing moan from the open gangway.</p>

  <p>"Thou here!" cried Eigil, and paused.</p>

  <p>Halfred turned. There behind him stood Thora, not white as in general, but
  with crimson glowing head, like a poppy, her eyes gazing wildly upwards
  towards the moon and stars. Suddenly she uplifted both arms on high, as
  though to avert from Halfred's head some fearful stroke from the clouds.
  Then, once more, a faint but heart piercing moan, and she fell forwards upon
  her face, like a crushed flower. Blood flowed from her mouth. Halfred would
  have quickly raised her, but lifeless lay the slight form on his arms.</p>

  <p>"Dead," cried Halfred, "murdered! And ye have murdered her!"</p>

  <p>He let slip the ice-cold form, wrenched with one tremendous spring
  forwards his hammer from Hartvik, and swinging it on high, with one stroke of
  his arm brought it crashing down upon the heads of both his blood-brethren,
  so that brains, blood, and fragments of skulls were scattered all around.</p>

  <p>With that deed began a slaughter on board the Singing Swan like that of
  the midsummer night; only it was much shorter, because there were fewer to
  slay.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Halfred as though his temple veins had burst. He felt,
  instead of brains, only boiling blood in his head; he tasted blood in his
  mouth, he saw only red blood before his eyes. Without choosing, without
  asking who was for or against him, he sprang into the thickest of the crowd
  of armed men, seized man after man by the throat with his left hand, and
  shattered their skulls with the broad side of his hammer.</p>

  <p>He did not in the least perceive that a handful of men stood by him. He
  did not notice the many wounds he received on arms, face, and hands, in close
  combat with his despairing foes. He raged on and slew, until all whom he
  could see before him lay dead and silent upon the deck. Then he turned, still
  brandishing his hammer, and shouted&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Who besides Halfred still breathes on this accursed ship?"</p>

  <p>Then he saw that some six men of those who had aided him kneeled behind
  him. They had formed, with their shields, a half circle round Thora's body,
  and had turned off many a spear which would have reached the form of the
  white sorceress. Halfred perceived this.</p>

  <p>"Stand up," he said, with his left arm wiping away the blood and sweat
  from his forehead, and the white foam from his lips.</p>

  <p>He thrust the blood stained hammer into his belt, and kneeled beside
  Thora, pillowing on his breast her face, which had become whiter than ever
  before.</p>

  <p>"It was too much to bear and to hear at once. The frightful hailstones of
  this curse have struck the white rose too heavily."</p>

  <p>Then she opened her eyes, and murmured, "Not for me, only for thee, have
  the horrors of this curse overwhelmed me."</p>

  <p>"She lives! she lives! Praise to you, ye gracious Gods," exulted Halfred,
  "It could not be that she should die for the crimes of others. She must be
  healed, as surely as the Gods live. Had Thora perished for mine, for other
  men's guilt; with this hammer must I have slain all the Gods."</p>

  <p>And tenderly and softly, as a mother a sick child, the mighty man raised
  his young wife in both arms, and bore her, treading softly, down the
  steps.</p>

  <p>But once more before she left the deck, Thora opened her eyes. She saw
  Halfred stained all over with blood. She recognised, by their armour and
  clothing, the bodies of Hartvik and Eigil, with frightfully shattered heads.
  She saw the whole deck strewn with dead. She saw that only very few of the
  ship's crew were left, and shuddering, shrinking, she closed her eyes
  again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

  <p class="first">But Halfred kneeled day and night beside her couch. He held
  her languid hand; he listened to her faint breathing; he kissed from her lips
  the small drops of blood which often gathered there.</p>

  <p>He had the board which closed the gangway between the decks taken away,
  and heaven and the stars shone down upon Thora's pillow.</p>

  <p>When the day had gone ill, and much blood had flowed, and she fell asleep
  with the falling night, then he would mount a few steps, draw his hammer from
  his belt, and threaten the stars with furious words.</p>

  <p>"If ye let her die for others' guilt, then woe to you, ye Gods, woe to all
  who live."</p>

  <p>But had the sufferer gained strength, and smiled lovingly and peacefully
  on him; then this same ferocious man mounted upon the deck, kneeled down, and
  cried with outstretched arms, and tear-choked voice,</p>

  <p>"Praise, praise, to you, ye gracious Gods! I knew it, verily, that ye live
  and rule justly, and would not let her die for others' guilt."</p>

  <p>And if the day wavered between good and evil, between fear and hope, then
  he paced the narrow chamber with hasty steps and murmured inaudibly,</p>

  <p>"Are there Gods! are there Gods! are there gracious Gods?"</p>

  <p>And he believed that Thora heard this not, because she slept.</p>

  <p>But she lay often awake, with closed eyes, and understood it all, and it
  troubled her sorely, in waking and dreaming.</p>

  <p>And Halfred now told her, at her mute request, all about Dame Harthild,
  and the curse, and how all had happened.</p>

  <p>When he had ended she murmured shuddering, "Much has been fulfilled! If
  yet more should be fulfilled, unhappy Halfred."</p>

  <p>It seemed, however, that Thora was better.</p>

  <p>And Halfred resolved at once to carry her upon deck, that she might
  breathe the fresh air, and again behold the beauty of sea and heaven.</p>

  <p>And he had the deck carefully cleansed from all traces of the horrible
  fight, and ordered the sailors, the day before, to run into a coast which was
  bright with summer flowers, and commanded a whole mountain of flowers, as he
  said, to be piled upon the ship, for he would have her laid upon a hill of
  flowers.</p>

  <p>And the men obeyed; and the whole deck was so thickly strewn with flowers
  that nowhere was a bit of wood visible.</p>

  <p>And close by the mast rose a swelling couch of perfumed light wood-grass,
  and all the loveliest wood flowers, so high that it reached to Halfred's
  breast.</p>

  <p>Over this he spread a rich white linen mantle, and laid the heavily
  breathing form upon it.</p>

  <p>And again the moon was full, as on that night of the battle on the ship.
  But many storm-rent clouds were still driving across the heavens, and the
  sailing disk of the moon had not pierced through them.</p>

  <p>And it was midsummer night. The first that Halfred had not spent by the
  black Heckla Stone in Iceland.</p>

  <p>Thora had fallen asleep upon her flowers.</p>

  <p>Halfred had covered her with his own mantle. And he sat close by the
  flower hill, and looked into the noble, pale, all bloodless face, and then
  quietly before him again.</p>

  <p>"Ye have done all things well, ye merciful dwellers in the stars above. Ye
  have requited me, for that I never altogether doubted ye. I will not again
  question with ye, wherefore ye have ordained for me this second fearful
  thing, that I should be forced to slay my dear blood-brethren, and so many of
  the ship's crew.</p>

  <p>"Because ye have saved this wonderful flower, and have not suffered her
  guiltless, to perish for other's guilt, for ever will I bless ye.</p>

  <p>"And a song of praise will I compose for you, ye merciful and gracious
  Gods; such as never yet has resounded to your praise. Thanks to you, ye
  gracious Gods!"</p>

  <p>And thus musing he fell asleep; for it was many many nights since he had
  slept.</p>

  <p>Then a piercing cry awoke him, which seemed to ring from the stars.
  "Halfred." It fell upon his ear from high above.</p>

  <p>He started up from slumber, and looked upwards. There he saw what filled
  him with horror. The full moon had, while he slept, pierced the clouds, and
  shone with full radiance upon Thora's face. Now Halfred saw her, standing
  swaying, high on the slender cross-spars, many many feet above his head.</p>

  <p>Like a white ghost she shone in the moonlight; her widely opened eyes
  looked out into her future; her right hand she stretched, as though warding
  off, into the night. She did not hold fast by the slender towering mast, on
  whose giddying height naught else save the seabird, tossing, rested. And yet
  she stood firmly erect; but in her face was despairing woe.</p>

  <p>"O Halfred," she wailed, in a low tone of heart-rending anguish, "O
  Halfred&mdash;how distracted thy looks&mdash;how fearfully tangled hair and
  beard! Ah! how thine eye rolls&mdash;and half naked&mdash;like a Berseker, in
  shaggy wolf's skin. And how stained thou art with the blood of guiltless men.
  And why threatenest thou the fair-haired shepherd the light-hearted boy?
  Beware&mdash;beware the sling&mdash;guard thyself&mdash;turn thy
  head&mdash;the swing whistles&mdash;the stone flies&mdash;O
  Halfred&mdash;thine eye." And bending far forward she stretched, as though
  she would protect, both arms into the air. Now she must fall&mdash;so it
  seemed.</p>

  <p>"Fall not, Thora!" cried Halfred upwards.</p>

  <p>Then, as though lightning struck, swift as an arrow, with a wild shriek,
  she fell downwards from the giddy height of the mast.</p>

  <p>The white forehead struck upon the deck, her head and golden hair were
  bathed in blood.</p>

  <p>"Thora! Thora!" cried Halfred, and raised her up, and looked into her
  eyes. Then he fell senseless with her upon his face among the
  flowers&mdash;for she was dead.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

  <p class="first">When Halfred raised himself again&mdash;he had already long
  since recovered consciousness, but not the power to rise&mdash;the sun was
  fast going down.</p>

  <p>He called the six seamen, who had held themselves shyly aloof in the stern
  and lower deck, and spoke, but his voice, he himself told me, sounded strange
  to him like that of another person.</p>

  <p>"She is dead. Slain for the sins of others.</p>

  <p>"There are no Gods.</p>

  <p>"Were there Gods I must have dashed out the brains of all of them, one by
  one, with this hammer.</p>

  <p>"The whole world, heaven and sea, and hell, I must have burned with
  consuming fire.</p>

  <p>"Nothing should any longer be, since Thora no longer is.</p>

  <p>"The world can I not destroy.</p>

  <p>"But the ships, and all that is upon it, I will burn&mdash;a great
  funereal pile for Thora.</p>

  <p>"Do as I say to ye."</p>

  <p>And he embedded with gentle hands, the dead Thora in the flower mound, so
  that almost nothing of her form and clothing were to be seen.</p>

  <p>And by his orders the six men were obliged to bring upon deck all the
  weapons, treasures, clothing, and provisions, which were stored in the hold
  of the Singing Swan.</p>

  <p>And Halfred heaped them around the mast upon the flower mound, and purple
  clothing, linen cloth, silken stuff, golden vessels, and soft cushions, he
  piled up all round about.</p>

  <p>Then he poured ship's tar over all, and covered it with withered
  brushwood, and dry chips from the kitchen.</p>

  <p>And he ordered all sail to be set&mdash;a strong warm south wind was
  blowing&mdash;</p>

  <p>Then he mounted upon the upper deck, and overlooked all.</p>

  <p>And he nodded his head, well satisfied. And then he descended to the
  kitchen, to bring up a burning brand.</p>

  <p>When he came up again he found that the sailors had lowered the two ship's
  boats, the larger and the smaller boat, they lay tossing by the boat ropes,
  to the right and left of the Singing Swan.</p>

  <p>"Hasten, my lord," cried one of the seamen to him; "so soon as thou hast
  thrown the torch, to spring into a boat; for rapidly, in this gale, will the
  Singing Swan flame up, and easily might the fire seize the boats, and cause
  both thee and all of us to perish."</p>

  <p>Halfred looked with staring eyes at the man "Would ye still live, after ye
  have seen this?</p>

  <p>"Think ye that I will live without Thora? after the guiltless for
  other's,&mdash;for my crime,&mdash;hath died?</p>

  <p>"No, with me shall ye all on this ship burn&mdash;truly a worthless
  funeral pile for Thora."</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt not destroy us, guiltless. Forbid it, Gods!" cried the man,
  and sprang upon Halfred, to wrest the firebrand from him.</p>

  <p>But with a fearful blow of his fist Halfred struck him down upon the
  deck.</p>

  <p>Laughing shrilly, he shouted, "Gods! Who dare still to believe in Gods,
  when Thora, guiltless, has died?</p>

  <p>"There are no Gods, I tell ye.</p>

  <p>"Were there Gods, I must have slain them all.</p>

  <p>"And I will slay, as my deadly enemy, whosoever declares that he still
  believes in Gods."</p>

  <p>Furiously he brandished the firebrand in his left hand, the hammer in his
  right, and cried to the trembling sailors&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Choose&mdash;If ye believe that there are Gods, then I will strike ye
  down like this too forward comrade.</p>

  <p>"But if ye renounce the Gods, then may ye live, and depart, and bear
  witness everywhere that there are no Gods.</p>

  <p>"Are there Gods?" shouted the maniac, drawing near to the trembling
  men.</p>

  <p>"No, my lord; there are no Gods," cried the men, and fell upon their
  knees.</p>

  <p>"Then go&mdash;and leave me alone to my own will."</p>

  <p>Quickly the seamen descended into the larger boat on the left.</p>

  <p>Halfred, however, stuck the hammer in his belt, and strode with rapid
  steps hither and thither upon the deck, and set fire to mast and sail, and
  purple clothing and carved work, and to the neck of the Swan on the
  prow-wailing, the wind passed once more through the curved wings of the
  Swan.</p>

  <p>The strong south wind fanned the crackling flames; quickly was the ship,
  on all sides, wrapped in a glowing blaze. The sails streamed like fiery wings
  from the mast.</p>

  <p>Silently, with folded arms, Halfred sat upon the upper deck, his eyes
  rigidly fixed upon the flower mound.</p>

  <p>Swift as an arrow flew the burning ship before the wind. The fire had
  rapidly consumed the dried wood grass, and Thora's form and face were fully
  visible. Then Halfred saw how the scorching flames seized upon Thora's long
  floating golden hair. "That was the last thing," he said to me, "that I saw
  for a long time."</p>

  <p>In unutterable anguish he sprang up, and rushed all along the burning
  ship, straight through the flames, to Thora, He sprang upon the flower mound
  to embrace the body.</p>

  <p>Then he felt a frightful blow upon his head, and left eye. The half burned
  mast had fallen with a crash upon him; he was dashed upon his face among the
  flowers and the flames, and darkness closed over him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

  <p class="first">When Halfred again awoke he lay in the bottom of a small
  boat, which drove over the open sea.</p>

  <p>His hammer lay at his right hand. A cruise of water stood at his left
  hand. Two oars were in the stem of the boat.</p>

  <p>Halfred started up to look around him.</p>

  <p>Then he perceived that he could only see with difficulty what was on his
  left side. He felt for his left eye, and found a bleeding cavity. A splinter
  of the mast had struck it out, and a stabbing pain beat through his brain,
  which he said never again left him as long as he lived.</p>

  <p>He looked at his body. In charred rags his burnt clothing hung upon him.
  Far in the distance he saw a craft which he recognized as the larger boat of
  the Singing Swan.</p>

  <p>The Singing Swan herself had disappeared; but away to the south there lay
  a cloud of vapour and smoke over the sea.</p>

  <p>The boat in which Halfred stood he recognised as the smaller boat of the
  Singing Swan. Evidently his sailing comrades had dragged the half-burned
  maniac from the burning ship, and saved him.</p>

  <p>They had abandoned him to the Gods whom he had blasphemed, and in whom
  they believed, to be saved by them, or perish. But no more fellowship would
  they have with a man stricken by the heaviest of curses&mdash;madness.</p>

  <p>For mad Halfred was, from the hour when he sprang into the flames, and the
  mast struck him, until shortly before his death.</p>

  <p>Therefore could he only tell me very little of all that in the meantime
  happened either to, or through him.</p>

  <p>But what he did tell me, here I faithfully write down.</p>

  <p>But many many years must he have wandered in madness.</p>

  <p>He told me, moreover, that he saw only before his eyes how Thora fell from
  the mast; and how the flames seized her head and hair. And that he could only
  think one single thought. "There are no Gods. Were there Gods I must have
  slain them.</p>

  <p>"So must I slay all human beings who believe in Gods; for blotted out from
  the earth shall be the name and remembrance of the Gods."</p>

  <p>And he could not die until he had slain the last man who still believed in
  the Gods.</p>

  <p>And thus he journeyed all about, everywhere, in his small ship; landed in
  bays and upon islands, lived upon game which he hunted, or upon domestic
  animals which he found in the fields, upon roots and wild berries from the
  woods, upon eggs of sea-birds, and mussels from the rocks.</p>

  <p>And often the storm waves broke high over his boat, and shattered her
  planks. But she sank not, nor was he drowned.</p>

  <p>And one day he saw he was wholly naked, the last charred rags had fallen
  from him. He was chilled, and when he met a wolf in the wood, he ran after
  him so long that he overtook him, slew him with his hammer, took off his
  skin, and hung it round his loins.</p>

  <p>And thus he roamed and sailed, half naked, all about the north. And none
  recognised in the maniac Berseker, Halfred Sigskald, the son of Oski.</p>

  <p>And he told me that when he chanced upon mankind, whither they were many
  or few, he sprang upon them, and shouted to them his question.</p>

  <p>"Are there Gods?"</p>

  <p>And if they said "Yes," or as the most did, gave him no answer, then he
  slew them all with his hammer. But if they said "No," as also many
  did&mdash;for it was already rumoured throughout the whole north, that a
  naked giant wandered through all lands with this question, whom the people
  called "God destroyer"&mdash;or if they took to flight, then he let them
  live.</p>

  <p>And often, from dread, the peasants and the women gave him fruit, bread,
  milk, and other food. Many however bound themselves in a league to go out and
  slay him, as a wild beast. But they could not stand before the fury and
  strength of the maniac. He killed the bold, the timorous fled.</p>

  <p>He slept hardly at all at night, therefore they could not surprise him in
  his sleep.</p>

  <p>Once, when he spent the night in the bam of a peasant, who had previously
  renounced the Gods, with all his household, the people from the court
  barricaded the straw-filled bam, and set fire to it. But Halfred burst
  through the roof, dashed through the flames and arrows, which could not
  pierce his body, and slew them all with his hammer.</p>

  <p>And this maniac wandering endured many years.</p>

  <p>And sea storms, and burning suns, and autumn frosts, and winter ice, beat
  upon Halfred's half-naked body.</p>

  <p>And his hair and beard stood out like a mane around him.</p>

  <p>But no longer dark, as when of yore he trod, as a wooer. King Harstein's
  courts&mdash;but snow white. In a single night&mdash;the night when Thora
  died&mdash;his hair had become white.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

  <p class="first">And after many years he came sailing in his rotten boat over
  the seas which play around the island of Caledonia. He landed, seized his
  hammer, and strode upwards to a steep rocky hill, on which sheep and goats
  were grazing.</p>

  <p>It was early morning, in the time when roses begin to bloom.</p>

  <p>Mist floated over the sea, and upon the cliffs.</p>

  <p>Then Halfred saw the shepherd standing above, on the cliff's edge; and he
  played a lovely melody upon his shepherd's pipe.</p>

  <p>And at first he doubted whether he should ask this shepherd boy his
  question about the Gods, for he left women and boys unquestioned. And this
  shepherd seemed to him but a boy.</p>

  <p>But as he climbed nearer to him he saw that the shepherd carried a spear,
  and a shepherd's sling, with which to kill wolves.</p>

  <p>And the shepherd lad believed that this was a robber or a Berseker coming
  against him and his sheep.</p>

  <p>And he chose out of his leather pouch a sharp heavy stone, and laid it in
  his sling, and held it ready to cast it.</p>

  <p>Halfred held his left hand over the eye that remained to him, and looked
  upward with difficulty, dazzled, for just then the sun broke out through the
  mist clouds exactly above the head of the shepherd, who thus saw clearly the
  figure of the half naked man, with tangled floating hair and beard, who now
  raising the hammer threateningly ascended the hill. Upon a slab of stone,
  under a great ash tree, he stopped, and cried to the shepherd&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Are there Gods, shepherd boy? Sayest thou yes, then thou must die."</p>

  <p>"Gods, there are not," replied the shepherd, in a clear voice, "but wise
  men have taught me there lives one Almighty Triune God, Creator of Heaven and
  Earth."</p>

  <p>The man with the hammer paused for a moment as if meditating.</p>

  <p>Such an answer had he never received.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, he sprang threateningly upwards again.</p>

  <p>Preventing him, however, the shepherd swung his sling; whirring flew the
  sharp stone; it was a sharp hard three-edged flint stone&mdash;I had
  carefully reserved it for some great peril&mdash;and alas! alas&mdash;woe is
  me, only too truly did it strike. Without a sound Halfred fell, where he
  stood, on his back under the ash tree, himself like to a suddenly felled
  tree.</p>

  <p>With a few bounds the shepherd reached the prostrate form, cautiously
  holding his spear before him, lest the enemy should suddenly spring up again.
  For it might be that he only artfully feigned to be wounded.</p>

  <p>As he drew nearer, however, he saw that it was no deceit, but rather
  evident truth.</p>

  <p>Blood streamed over the fallen man's right cheek, and in the cavity of the
  right eye stuck the sharp flint stone.</p>

  <p>But pity mingled with dread seized upon the shepherd, as he gazed in the
  fearful mighty face of the man who lay mute at his feet. Never before had he
  seen so splendid a face; at once so noble, and so sad.</p>

  <p>And superstitious fear overcame him, if it might not be the chief of the
  heathen gods, Odhin, the one-eyed, who in the semblance of this wanderer with
  the white beard had appeared to him.</p>

  <p>But soon he felt yet deeper sympathy and compassion, for the wounded man
  in a weak voice began:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Whosoever thou mayest be, who hast cast this stone, receive the thanks, O
  shepherd boy, of a world and woe weary man. Thou hast taken from me the light
  of the second eye also. I need no longer to see men-kind and the heavens.
  Neither of them have I understood for a long time. And soon shall I pass to
  where questions are no more asked, and curses no more cursed. I thank thee,
  whosoever thou mayest be. Thou hast of all living beings&mdash;save
  one&mdash;done the best for Halfred Hamundson."</p>

  <p>Then with a loud cry I threw my spear on one side, fell upon my knees,
  embraced the pale bleeding head, and cried:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Halfred, Halfred, my father, forgive, forgive me!&mdash;I am the
  murderer&mdash; and thy son&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Now ye who shall one day unroll this parchment&mdash;pause at this place,
  and look upwards to the sun, if it is day, and to the stars, if it is night,
  and ask with Halfred&mdash;"Are there Gods?"</p>

  <p>For I, I, who secretly and in dread write these pages during the night
  hours, I am the shepherd boy, Halfred's son, who have slain him.</p>

  <p>And the Gods, or the Christian God, have allowed it to come to pass that
  the son has blinded and murdered the father.</p>

  <p>I wept hot tears upon my dear father's pale forehead. But he turned his
  head, as though he would see me, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It is hard that the curse must be so wholly fulfilled upon me, that I
  must be entirely blinded before death.</p>

  <p>"Fain would I have looked closely into thy face, my dear son.</p>

  <p>"Now I know not if the golden cloud I saw spread about thy head was thy
  hair or the sun rays.</p>

  <p>"Thou seemedst to me fair to look upon, my boy.</p>

  <p>"But tell me, how do they call thee?</p>

  <p>"Have they verily, at thy birth, named thee Liarson Scoundrelson
  Harthildsvengeance? and how did it happen that thou camest into life. I
  believed Dame Harthild burned in the dwelling house."</p>

  <p>Then I laid my dear father's head upon my knees, and dried with the long
  yellow hair I was at that time still allowed to wear, the blood from his
  cheek, and told him all.</p>

  <p>How my mother would not be carried from the burning Mead hall back into
  the dwelling house, but rather on to one of the ships of her father.</p>

  <p>How from thence, when the battle and the flames threatened dwelling house
  and ships, she was borne by her women and the sailors into a boat, and
  therein rowed out upon the Fjord.</p>

  <p>How in the boat she had forthwith given birth to a son, but died herself;
  and ere she died had laid her hand upon my head, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Not Liarson&mdash;not Scoundrelson&mdash;not Harthildsvengeance shall he
  be named&mdash;no; Fridgifa[6] Sigskaldson."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[6. <i>i.e.</i> Peacebringer.]</p>

  <p>"She was right in that," said Halfred. "Thou hast aided the Sigskald to
  peace at last."</p>

  <p>And how after she was dead the fearful battle and burning on shore scared
  the sailors and women still further out to sea.</p>

  <p>And how the small boat was almost sunk by the fury of a storm from the
  west, and all the bondmen and women were washed overboard by the waves, save
  one rower, and a bond maiden, who hid the infant under the stern seat.</p>

  <p>And how, at last, Christian priests, who were sailing out to convert the
  heathen people, picked up the half starved wanderers, and brought all three
  hither, to the island of the holy Columban; and cleansed both the two, and
  the infant, with the water of baptism.</p>

  <p>And how the two, my foster parents, told me all that they knew about my
  father, and mother, up to the time of the burning of the Mead hall.</p>

  <p>And how the two were never weary of lauding to me my father's glory in
  battle and song.</p>

  <p>And how the monks of Saint Columban, as I grew, would have me taught to
  read and write; but I loved far better to go out with the hunters and
  shepherds of the monastery, and liked to draw targets on the parchment leaves
  for my little cross-bow.</p>

  <p>And how, at length, they declared me unfit for books, when with my small
  bolt I had pierced through and through a costly picture which on the gold
  ground of a thumb broad margin represented the whole of the Passion, and
  promoted me with a sound thrashing to be herd boy of the monastery.</p>

  <p>And how for many years, since my foster parents were dead, I had kept the
  sheep of the monastery; and my sole pleasure therein had been in fighting
  with the bears, the wolves, and the eagles, that attacked the lambs.</p>

  <p>Or in playing upon my shepherd's pipe, or in listening to the roar of the
  sea and the forest.</p>

  <p>And Halfred laid my head upon his broad breast, and folded both his arms
  around it, and laid his hand upon it, and was still and silent for a long
  time.</p>

  <p>And I brought him water to drink from the fountain, and milk from my
  flock; and would have drawn the stone from the wound, but he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Leave it, my dear son&mdash;the end draws near.</p>

  <p>"But I feel the band taken away from my brain, which for many many years
  has pressed upon it.</p>

  <p>"And all becomes clear and bright to my thoughts. I can see inwardly again
  how all has been, now that I can no longer see outward things.</p>

  <p>"And for thee, and for myself, before I die, I will set forth clearly and
  exactly how all has been. Give me once again milk from thy flock to
  drink."</p>

  <p>And I gave him to drink, and he laid his head again upon my knee, and
  began to tell me, quite clearly and distinctly, all that had come to pass
  since that midsummer night.</p>

  <p>And from his lips have I learned all, onward from that midsummer night,
  which in the earlier pages of this book I have written out. And much have I
  also learned from him, of those earlier times of which my foster parents
  could know nothing.</p>

  <p>And I have kept it all in faithful remembrance.</p>

  <p>And as the evening fell he came to the end of his account, and he
  said,</p>

  <p>"Lay my face so that once more the sun shall shine upon it. Fain would I
  feel the dear Lord once again."</p>

  <p>And I did as he commanded.</p>

  <p>And he breathed deeply, and said:</p>

  <p>"It must certainly be spring. A perfume of wild roses floats to me."</p>

  <p>And I told him that he lay under a blooming rose-bush.</p>

  <p>And then a blackbird raised his sweet song from the bush.</p>

  <p>"Thus I hear once more the blackbird's evening song," said Halfred.</p>

  <p>"Now farewell all. Sun and sea, forest and stars of heaven, wild rose
  perfume, and songs of birds; and farewell to thee, my dear son. I thank thee
  that thou hast released me from madness, and an evil life.</p>

  <p>"I can, to requite thee, as all my heritage, leave thee only this hammer.
  Guard it faithfully.</p>

  <p>"Whether there be Gods&mdash;I know not. Methinks that men can never
  search it out. But I tell thee, my son, whether Gods live or not, hammer
  throwing, and harp playing, and sunshine, and the kiss of woman, these are
  the rewards of life.</p>

  <p>"Mayest thou win a wife who is but a faint reflection of Thora.</p>

  <p>"Then hail to thee, my son!</p>

  <p>"Bury me here, where mingles the roar of the forest and the sea.</p>

  <p>"Farewell my dear son. Dame Harthild's curse thou hast turned for me into
  a blessing."</p>

  <p>And he died.</p>

  <p>The blackbird ceased singing in the bush. And as the sun sank, one warm
  full flood of his rays streamed full upon that mighty face.</p>

  <p>Thus died the son of Oski.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">When now my dear father was dead, whom I myself had slain, I
  wept bitterly, and lay all night by the side of the dead.</p>

  <p>And when the sun again arose I considered what I should now do.</p>

  <p>At first I thought I would drive the flock to the monastery, which lay
  some six stages distant, and relate all to the monks, and confess how I had,
  all unwittingly, slain my own father; and beg for absolution for myself, and
  for a Christian grave for my dear father.</p>

  <p>But I bethought me that the monks would not bury my father with Christian
  honours, since he had died a heathen. And neither would they allow me to burn
  him, after the custom of the heathen people, because the heathen gods would
  thus be brought much into remembrance. And they would certainly throw him,
  unhonoured, into the sea, as they had already done to a heathen from
  Zealand.</p>

  <p>So I resolved to be silent about it all, and not to betray my dear dead
  father to the priests.</p>

  <p>And thus could I neither confess the death blow, nor receive counsel
  respecting my guiltless crime.</p>

  <p>And from thence was the beginning of my freeing my mind from the monks and
  their creed.</p>

  <p>And I knew, quite near, of a cavern, which was known only to me, for it
  had a very small entrance, and I had only discovered it because I had
  followed a stone marten which had slipped into it. A fallen block of stone
  concealed the entrance, and I found many ashes and remnants of bones within
  the spacious cavern, which opened towards the sea. In early days, no doubt,
  the heathen Scots had burnt their dead here. Thither I carried, not without
  much difficulty, my dear dead father, and set him upright in the cavern, his
  face turned towards the sea. The roots of the oaks and ashes which waved
  above the cavern, penetrated through the stone downwards almost to his head.
  Above him roared the forest, before him roared the sea. There did I place my
  dear father, and rolled the stone again to the entrance.</p>

  <p>But even his hammer, his only possession, I dared not keep. Even should I
  tell the monks I had found it, or bought it from sailors&mdash;they would not
  have left it with me, for strong heathen victory runes were engraved on the
  haft.</p>

  <p>So I laid then the hammer also close to the right hand of the dead. "Guard
  it for me, dear father," I said, "till I need it again. Then will I fetch
  it."</p>

  <p>But from that hour there came a great change over my disposition.</p>

  <p>That which had most delighted me, to fight for my sheep with wolves,
  bears, and birds of prey&mdash;that attracted me no more.</p>

  <p>Rather the question which had driven my dear father even to madness, if
  there be a God, or Gods? And how it could be that such fearful things should
  come to pass as are here set down in this history, from the vow upon the
  Bragi cup, on to this great horror, that the son had slain his own father.
  These questionings seized upon me, and would not let me rest, any more than
  my dear father.</p>

  <p>And as my dear father of yore looked up to the stars, and implored the
  heathen Gods for enlightenment, so also did I look up to the stars for
  illumination, praying to Christ and the saints.</p>

  <p>But to me also the heavens were dumb.</p>

  <p>Then I said to myself&mdash;"Here on the sheep pastures, and from the roar
  of the sea, and from the light of the stars, wilt thou find no answer all thy
  life long, any more than thy dear father.</p>

  <p>"But in the books of the monks, the Latin ones and those others, with the
  crinkled runic flourishes, lie hidden all holy and worldly wisdom.</p>

  <p>"And when thou can'st read them, all will be clear to thee in heaven and
  upon earth."</p>

  <p>And so I took leave of my dear father, gathered my sheep together, and
  drove them to the monastery.</p>

  <p>"Art thou gone mad, Iren us?" asked the porter, as he opened the door for
  me and my bleating charge, "that thou drivest home before shearing time. They
  will scourge thee again."</p>

  <p>"I was mad," I replied, "but now I will become a scholar. Now another may
  scare the wolves. I will learn Greek."</p>

  <p>And thus I also said to the good Abbot Aelfrik, before whom I was at once
  led for chastisement.</p>

  <p>But he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Lay the scourge aside. Perchance the boy, who has always been a
  heathenish worldly Saul, has become suddenly a Paul, through the grace of the
  holy Columban. He shall have his wish. If he holds to it&mdash;then it is a
  work of the saints. If his zeal flags, then it is a wile of Satan, and he
  shall go out again to his sheep."</p>

  <p>But I kept silence, and said nothing about the reason for which I wished
  to learn.</p>

  <p>And my zeal did not flag, and I learned Latin and Greek, and read all the
  books that they had in the monastery, the Christian ones of the church
  fathers, which they call theology, and many heathen ones, of the old world
  wisdom, which they call philosophy.</p>

  <p>And I soon perceived that often, in one church father, was found just the
  contrary of what was in another church father.</p>

  <p>And that Aristotle reviled Plato, and that Cicero tried to make sense of
  it all, and could not.</p>

  <p>And after that I, in three, four years, had read through all the books
  which they had in the monastery, and had contended all night long with all
  the monks in the monastery, I knew no more of that which I wished to know
  than on the day when I had buried my dear father.</p>

  <p>The old good-natured fat Abbot Aelfrik however&mdash;he was of noble race,
  and had formerly been a warrior at the court of the Scottish King, and loved
  me&mdash;often said to me,</p>

  <p>"Give up these searchings Fridgifa"&mdash;for he willingly called me by my
  heathen name when we were alone. "Thou must believe, not question. And drink
  often, between whiles good ale or wine, and sing a song to the
  harp"&mdash;for he had taught me harp playing, in which I had great delight,
  and which he loved much, and everyone said that none could play the harp like
  me in all Scotland; "and forget not either often to throw the lance at the
  target in the monastery garden. Much book reading withers the body."</p>

  <p>And I remembered that my dear father's last words had been just the same.
  And often and often I stole away to my dear father's hill, brought forth the
  hammer, exercised myself in hammer throwing by star light, and sat then for
  hours before the cavern, and listened to the roar of wind, wood, and
  wave.</p>

  <p>And now it often seemed to me as if, in such moods, I came nearer to the
  truth than through all the books of the Christian priests, and heathen
  philosophers.</p>

  <p>And I almost believe I shall not stay much longer in the monastery.</p>

  <p>Especially since, lately, a skald from Halogaland visited the monastery,
  and told of the life at the court of King Harald; of his lordly royal hall,
  in which twenty skalds by turns play the harp.</p>

  <p>And how the boldest heroes ever willingly enter his service.</p>

  <p>And how year by year his warlike expeditions are crowned with victory.</p>

  <p>And of Gunnl dh, his wonderfully beautiful golden-haired daughter, who
  pledges the bravest heroes and the best skalds in the horn.</p>

  <p>Since then, my inclination no longer turns towards psalm-singing and
  vigils.</p>

  <p>But certainly they will not easily let me leave the monastery.</p>

  <p>For because I can write Latin and Greek well, Aaron, the new Abbot, the
  Italian, who has succeeded the good peace-loving Aelfrik, makes me
  unceasingly write out manuscripts, which they then sell for a great price, in
  Britain, and even in Germany.</p>

  <p>And Aaron is very sharp upon my track, because I seem to him to lack true
  Christian zeal.</p>

  <p>And did he know that upon these parchment sheets, whereupon I ought to
  have written out, for the seventeenth time, the treatise of Lactantius "de
  mortibus persecutorum," I have, by night, written out the history of my dear
  father&mdash;it would not pass without many days' fasting, and some score of
  penitential psalms.</p>

  <p>Lately he actually threatened me to have "some one" scourged, who ever
  again came too late for the Hora.</p>

  <p>That "someone" was I. For I had just begun to write about the battle on
  the Singing Swan, and could not tear myself away from it when the Hora bell
  called.</p>

  <p>But ere the son of Halfred the Sigskald endures scourging on the
  back,&mdash;rather will I slay Aaron and all his Italian monks.</p>

  <p>But for slaying I need something different from this copying style.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Thus far had I written by Good Friday.</p>

  <p>For a long while could I not contrive to write further. For the hatred,
  jealousy, and mistrust of Aaron and his hangers-on&mdash;there are many of
  his Italian countrymen come with him from Rumaberg&mdash;grow constantly
  greater. He has forbidden me to write by night.</p>

  <p>Only by day, and in the library, no longer in my cell, may I write. And
  the transcript of Lactantius I am to deliver to him on the appointed
  parchment by Whitsuntide, on pain of seven days' fasting.</p>

  <p>My resentment increases against this priestly tyranny.</p>

  <p>Only rarely, and by stealth, can I get at these pages. Also I can only
  with great difficulty reach my dear father's hill. They track my lonely
  wanderings.</p>

  <p>It will soon come to open war. At any rate I will provide myself with a
  sure weapon.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">With difficulty did I, yesterday evening, in the sleeve of my frock, bring
  my dear father's hammer into the monastery. I have hidden it in the outer
  court, but where&mdash;that I do not trust even to these pages. I think much
  over the question of my dear father, and I believe that soon I shall find the
  truth.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">For three days I could not write at all. The skald from King Harald's
  court has again been a guest in the monastery.</p>

  <p>I have made him tell me all about the life at that court. It is just as in
  my dear father's days. Certainly King Harald and all his courtiers are
  heathens, and their warlike expeditions are mostly against Christian kings
  and bishops. But that does not make me waver in my purpose, which is firmly
  resolved. He told me much about Gunnl dh.</p>

  <p>In twenty nights a ship of King Harald's will sail again into the harbour
  from...</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I know now the answer to Halfred's question.</p>

  <p>There are no heathen Gods.</p>

  <p>But neither is there any Christian God, who, almighty, all merciful, all
  wise, allowed that the father should be slain by the son.</p>

  <p>Rather, that only happens upon earth which is necessary, and what men do
  and do not, that must they do and not do; as the north wind must bring cold,
  the south wind warmth; and as the stone thrown must fall to the earth. Why
  must it fall? No one knows. But it must.</p>

  <p>But men should not sigh and question and despair, rather rejoice in hammer
  throwing and harp playing, in sunshine and Greek wine, and in the beauty of
  women.</p>

  <p>For that is a lie that it is a sin to long for a beautiful woman.
  Otherwise must the human race die out; if all become so devout as no more to
  long for a woman.</p>

  <p>And the dead are dead, and no longer living.</p>

  <p>Otherwise had the shade of my dear father long since appeared to me, at my
  earnest entreaty.</p>

  <p>Of what alone, however, man should believe; of that I will speak
  hereafter.</p>

  <p>Without fear shall he live, and without hope shall he die.</p>

  <p>In this monastery, however, will I remain no longer
  than&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

  <p class="first">Thus far had he written, the God forsaken Brother Iren us.
  Here fell the righteous judgment of Heaven upon him.</p>

  <p>I, Aaron of Perusia, called by the grace of God to feed these lambs of the
  holy Columban, had also the grace given to me to drive the diseased sheep
  from the flock.</p>

  <p>Long was I on the track of him and his worldly, heathenish, sinful,
  ungodly, yea God-blaspheming doings; his guilty conscience had rightly boded
  this. Step by step I had him watched by Italian brethren, full of godly zeal,
  without his observing it. The most pious of them, Brother Ignatius of
  Spoletum, succeeded in winning his confidence&mdash;for stupidly unsuspicious
  are they&mdash;these barbarians&mdash;through often allowing him to entertain
  him with harp playing, Iren us begged from him one day some ink powder from
  his store, as he had used up his appointed portion, and from the "Head of the
  Pharisees"&mdash;thus the shameless sinner termed his abbot and chief
  shepherd&mdash;could not obtain fresh supplies, without delivering over what
  he had written with the former supply.</p>

  <p>Brother Ignatius at once, as was his pious obligation, told all to me, his
  abbot. But the ink powder he gave to him, with that wisdom of the serpent
  which is well pleasing to God in his priests.</p>

  <p>Soon thereafter the sinner set out again upon one of those secret
  expeditions which have ever been his wont, remaining out the whole night when
  some errand had allowed him to escape from the monastery. I never forbade him
  to go out, for I hoped through one of these secret expeditions, most easily
  to discover his hidden doings. I sent, spies after him every time; but every
  time he suddenly and mysteriously disappeared among the wooded crags along
  the shore.</p>

  <p>This time I myself sent him out, and as soon as he had left the monastery
  court I at once made a most rigorous search through the whole of his
  cell.</p>

  <p>There at last I found, after much labour, these blasphemous pages, written
  very small, in his accursed graceful handwriting, and artfully hidden in a
  crevice between two stone slabs of the floor.</p>

  <p>I took the devil's work with me, and read and read, with growing horror.
  So much sin, so much worldliness, so much heathenish delight in fighting and
  singing, in drinking and carnal love, so much, finally, of doubt, of
  unbelief, of naked blasphemy, had, under the roof of the holy Columban, under
  my pastoral staff, grown up, and been written out!</p>

  <p>Abhorrence seized upon me, and holy indignation.</p>

  <p>Forthwith I summoned the Italian brethren to special secret council and
  judgment. I pointed out to them the deadly poison of these writings, which
  indeed were full of the seven deadly sins; and the unanimous sentence was
  pronounced. First, three hundred lashes with the scourge; then immuring in
  the chastisement cell, with vinegar, water, and bread, until repentant
  contrition and the fullest amendment were made manifest.</p>

  <p>Impatiently we awaited the return of the accursed sinner.</p>

  <p>With the vesper bell he entered the door of the monastery court.</p>

  <p>Immediately I placed myself before the door, shot the iron bolt, and
  called forward the Italian brethren. The greater number, the Anglo-Saxons,
  who were well disposed towards the blasphemer, on account of his sinful harp
  playing, and lukewarm in zeal for the Lord, I had before collected in the
  refectory, and locked up until the offender should be secured.</p>

  <p>Hastily the Italians came, and behind them several armed bondmen of the
  monastery. Then, in place of all accusation, I held up these pages before the
  miserable wretch, and pronounced the agreed upon sentence.</p>

  <p>Then, ere we were aware, the God-detested criminal sprang with lightning
  speed to the cistern in the court, and drew forth from behind it a frightful
  horrible hammer.</p>

  <p>"Dear hammer of Halfred, aid his son today," he cried in a threatening
  voice.</p>

  <p>And the next thing was&mdash;it seemed to me as though the Heavens fell
  upon my head and neck&mdash;I sank upon the ground.</p>

  <p>Only after a long while did I awake again.</p>

  <p>Then I lay upon my bed, a man given up, and the brethren from Italy
  lamented around my couch; and recounted that the furious Samson had, with a
  second blow, shattered the bolt on the door, and made his escape. The
  monastery servants, indeed, followed him, and several of the brethren, led by
  brother Ignatius. But when the fugitive suddenly turned, and slew the
  foremost of the pursuers, one of the monastery servants, who would have
  seized him, with the frightful hammer, and struck down brother Ignatius,
  severely wounded, the others gave up the pursuit. At once he again
  disappeared, as always, among the cliffs and woods.</p>

  <p>Never have we seen him since, although from the very day of my awakening I
  had him carefully searched for all along the coast. The cavern of which these
  accursed pages speak could we not find. I would have had the bones of the old
  heathen murderer thrown into the sea. Probably the son concealed himself
  there, until he could leave the island on some ship. I however, in
  consequence of the blow from his hammer, which shattered my shoulder and
  collar bone, on one side, have to suffer all my life long from a hideous
  twist of the neck, which is exceedingly prejudicial to the dignity of an
  abbot.</p>

  <p>This sinful book of abominations however, I sent to Rome, to the holy
  Bishop, with the question, whether we should burn it, or preserve it, to aid
  in tracing and convicting the escaped monk, should we succeed in capturing
  him again?</p>

  <p>For a long long time came no answer.</p>

  <p>But after many many years the book came back from Rome, with the command
  to keep it&mdash;only the blasphemous passages therein were erased&mdash;and
  as a warning example to others, was the Abbot of St. Columban to append to
  these pages an account from an accompanying letter of the Archbishop Adaldag
  of Hamburg, of how dreadful a fate had, through the righteous judgments of
  God, ended this apostate's sinful life of the highest earthly enjoyment;
  which he&mdash;this may console us&mdash;will doubtless have to expiate in
  the eternal torments of hell.</p>

  <p>From the Archbishop's letter it appeared there could be no doubt that our
  perjured Brother, Iren us, is none other than one who, in all the courts of
  the north, has been for many years celebrated as a warrior and singer, and
  crowned with all earthly fame and happiness, Jarl Sigurd Halfredson; who
  appeared suddenly at the court of King Harald of Halogaland&mdash;none knew
  whence he came&mdash;with one of the skalds of the King, and through hammer
  throwing, and harp playing, soon won for himself such renown that King Harald
  gave him three castles, the command of all his armies, and his daughter Gunnl
  dh in marriage.</p>

  <p>But King Harald was the most furious Christian hater, and the bitterest
  opposer of the Gospel in all the North.</p>

  <p>And for long years Jarl Sigurd led the troops of King Harald, and always
  led them to victory.</p>

  <p>The Lord at that time tried his own with severe affliction. He had turned
  his face from them, and the vassals of the Bishops, and of the Christian
  princes of the North, could not stand before Jarl Sigurd, and his dreaded
  hammer.</p>

  <p>But the end of this man of blood was horrible, and therefore it has
  been&mdash;by the command of the holy Father&mdash;copied from the letter of
  the Archbishop, as a fearful warning to all who read these pages.</p>

  <p>As he, that is to say, after once more in a great battle overthrowing the
  Bishop's troops, was pursuing them in sinful joy, and shouting "victory,
  victory!" he was mortally wounded by an arrow in the breast.</p>

  <p>King Harald caused his heathen priests and the skalds to draw near to the
  right side of the death bed, to console him with songs of Valhalla.</p>

  <p>The wounded man waved them away with his hand.</p>

  <p>Then drew near, on the other side of the dying, three Christian priests,
  who had been made prisoners in the battle, and would have given him the holy
  last Sacrament, if he acknowledged the Lord.</p>

  <p>Indignantly the godless sinner repulsed them with his arm. And when King
  Harald, astonished, asked him in whom then he believed, if not in the heathen
  Gods, nor in the white Christ? he laughed and said&mdash;"I believe in
  myself, and my strength. Kiss me once more, Gunnl dh, and give me Greek wine
  in a golden cup."</p>

  <p>And he kissed her, and drank, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Glorious it is to die in victory"&mdash;and died.</p>

  <p>But he remained unhonoured and unburied by heathen priests and Christians,
  since he had defiantly rejected both.</p>

  <p>So then it is certain and set forth as a warning to all&mdash;but to us a
  righteous consolation&mdash;that the God accursed soul of this most
  blasphemous of all sinners must burn in hell for ever and
  ever&mdash;Amen.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ps"
     name="ps">POSTSCRIPT.</a></h2>

  <p class="first">What I here wrote down, years since, as my belief concerning
  the fate, after death, of this abandoned sinner, has been fully confirmed by
  a delightful testimony.</p>

  <p>That is to say, Brother Ignatius&mdash;who lately died&mdash;and certainly
  in great sanctity&mdash;was before his death honoured by a wonderful
  vision.</p>

  <p>Saint Columban, himself, in a dream, led him by the hand into hell, and
  there he saw, in the deepest pit of sulpher, Brother Iren us, burning whole
  and entire.</p>

  <p>But upon his left shoulder blade, on the spot where he struck me, his
  Abbot, sat an infernal raven, and hacked unceasingly through the shoulder
  even to his blaspheming heart.</p>

  <p>Of this has Brother Ignatius assured us before his death. And therefore
  have I hereunto add this also, about the raven and the shoulder blade, in
  order that all who read these pages, but especially the disciples of the holy
  Columban in this monastery, may learn the chastisement which awaits him who
  lifts heart and hand against his soul's shepherd, the Abbot.</p>

  <p><b>AMEN.</b><>
