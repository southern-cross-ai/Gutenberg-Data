<h2><a id="fwd" name="fwd">FOREWORD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">INDIA is a world unto itself, apart in manners,
customs, occultism from the world and life with which we are
familiar. Even upon far Barsoom or Amtor might be found no more
baffling mysteries than those which lie hidden in the secret places
of the brains and lives of her people. We sometimes feel that what
we do not understand must be bad; that is our heritage from the
ignorance and superstition of the painted savages from which we are
descended. Of the many good things that have come to us out of
India I am concerned at present with but one&mdash;the power which
old Chand Kabi transmitted to the son of an English officer and his
American wife to transmit his thoughts and visualizations to the
mind of another at distances even as great as those which separate
the planets. It is to this power we owe the fact that Carson Napier
has been able to record, through me, the story of his adventures
upon the planet Venus.</p>

<p>When he took off from Guadalupe Island in his giant rocket ship
for Mars, I listened to the story of that epochal flight that
ended, through an error in calculation, upon Venus. I followed his
adventures there that started in the island kingdom of Vepaja where
he fell desperately in love with Duare, the unattainable daughter
of the king. I followed their wanderings across seas and land
masses into the hostile city of Kapdor, and Kormor, the city of the
dead, to glorious Havatoo, where Duare was condemned to death
through a strange miscarriage of justice. I thrilled with
excitement during their perilous escape in the aeroplane that
Carson Napier had built at the request of the rulers of Havatoo.
And always I suffered with Napier because of Duare's unalterable
determination to look upon his love as an insult to the virgin
daughter of the king of Vepaja. She repulsed him constantly because
she was a princess, but in the end I rejoiced with him when she
realized the truth and acknowledged that though she could not
forget that she was a princess she had discovered that she was a
woman first. That was immediately after they had escaped from
Havatoo and were winging their way above the River of Death toward
an unknown sea in seemingly hopeless search for Vepaja, where
Duare's father, Mintep, ruled.</p>

<p>Months passed. I commenced to fear that Napier had crashed in
his new ship, and then I began to have messages from him again
which I shall record for the benefit of posterity as nearly in his
own words as I can recall them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">I. &mdash; DISASTER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">EVERYONE who has ever flown will recall the thrill
of his first flight over familiar terrain, viewing the old scenes
from a new angle that imparted a strangeness and a mystery to them
as of a new world; but always there was the comforting knowledge
that the airport was not too far away and that even in the event of
a forced landing one would know pretty well where he was and how to
get home.</p>

<p>But that dawn that Duare and I took off from Havatoo to the
accompaniment of the staccato hum of Amtorian rifles, I was
actually flying over an unknown world; and there was no landing
field and no home. I believe that this was the happiest and most
thrilling moment of my life. The woman I love had just told me that
she loved me, I was once again at the controls of a ship, I was
free, I was flying in safety above the innumerable menaces that
haunt the Amtorian scene. Undoubtedly, other dangers lay ahead of
us in our seemingly hopeless quest for Vepaja, but for the moment
there was nothing to mar our happiness or arouse forebodings. At
least, not in me. With Duare it may have been a little different.
She may have had forebodings of disaster. It would not be strange
if she had, for up until the very instant that we rose to top the
walls of Havatoo she had had no conception that there might exist
any contrivance in which man might leave the ground and fly through
the air. It was naturally something of a shock to her; but she was
very brave, and content, too, to accept my word that we were
safe.</p>

<p>The ship was a model of perfection, such a ship as will one day
be common along the airways of old Earth when science has
progressed there as far as it has in Havatoo. Synthetic materials
of extreme strength and lightness entered into her construction.
The scientists of Havatoo assured me that she would have a life of
at least fifty years without overhaul or repairs other than what
might be required because of accident. The engine was noiseless and
efficient beyond the dreams of Earth men. Fuel for the life of the
ship was aboard; and it took up very little space, for it could all
be held in the palm of one hand. This apparent miracle is
scientifically simple of explanation. Our own scientists are aware
of the fact that the energy released by combustion is only an
infinitesimal fraction of that which might be generated by the
total annihilation of a substance. In the case of coal it is as
eighteen thousand millions are to one. The fuel for my engine
consists of a substance known as <i>lor</i>, which contains an
element called <i>yor-san</i>, as yet unknown to Earth men, and
another element, <i>vik-ro</i>, the action of which upon
<i>yor-san</i> results in absolute annihilation of the
<i>lor</i>.</p>

<p>Insofar as the operation of the ship was concerned, we might
have flown on for fifty years, barring adverse weather conditions;
but our weakness lay in the fact that we had no provisions. The
precipitancy of our departure had precluded any possibility of
provisioning the ship. We had escaped with our lives and what we
had on, and that was all; but we were very happy. I didn't want to
spoil it by questioning the future. But, really, we had a great
many questions to ask of the future; and Duare presently raised one
quite innocently enough.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To look for Vepaja," I told her. "I am going to try to take you
home."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, we can't go there."</p>

<p>"But that is the one place you have been longing to go ever
since you were kidnaped by the klangan," I reminded her.</p>

<p>"But not now, Carson. My father, the jong, would have you
destroyed. We have spoken of love to one another, and no man may
speak of love to the daughter of the jong of Vepaja before she is
twenty. You know that well enough."</p>

<p>"I certainly should," I teased her; "you have told me often
enough."</p>

<p>"I did it for your own safety, but nevertheless I always liked
to hear you say it," she admitted.</p>

<p>"From the first?" I asked.</p>

<p>"From the first. I have loved you from the first, Carson."</p>

<p>"You are an adept at dissimulation. I thought you hated me; and
yet, sometimes I wondered."</p>

<p>"And because I love you, you must never fall into the hands of
my father."</p>

<p>"But where can we go, Duare? Do you know a single spot in all
this world where we should be safe? There is none; and in Vepaja
you, at least, will be safe. I shall have to take the chance of
winning your father over."</p>

<p>"It could never be done," she declared. "The unwritten law that
decrees this thing is as old as the ancient empire of Vepaja. You
have told me of the gods and goddesses of the religions of your
world. In Vepaja the royal family occupies a similar position in
the minds and hearts of the people, and this is especially true of
the virgin daughter of a jong&mdash;she is absolutely sacrosanct.
To look at her is an offense; to speak to her is a crime punishable
by death."</p>

<p>"It's a crazy law," I snapped. "Where would you be now, had I
abided by its dictates?&mdash;dead. I should think your father
would feel some obligation toward me."</p>

<p>"As a father, he would; but not as a jong."</p>

<p>"And I suppose he is a jong first," I said, a little
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a jong first; and so we may not return to Vepaja,"
she said with finality.</p>

<p>What an ironical trick Fate had played upon me. With many
opportunities in two worlds to pick a girl for me to fall in love
with, she had ended up by choosing a goddess. It was tough, yet I
wouldn't have had it otherwise. To have loved Duare, and to know
that she loved me, was better than a lifetime with any other
woman.</p>

<p>Duare's decision that we must not return to Vepaja had left me
in something of a quandary. Of course I didn't know that I could
have found Vepaja anyway, but at least it was something to aim at.
Now I had nothing. Havatoo was the grandest city I had ever seen;
but the unbelievable decision of the judges who had examined Duare
after I had rescued her from the City of the Dead, and our escape,
made it impossible for us ever to return. To hunt for a hospitable
city in this strange world seemed useless and hopeless. Venus is a
world of contradictions, anomalies, and paradoxes. In the midst of
scenes of peace and beauty, one meets the most fearsome beasts;
among a friendly, cultured people exist senseless and barbarous
customs; in a city peopled by men and women of super-intelligence
and sweetness the quality of mercy is utterly unknown to its
tribunals. What hope had I, then, of finding a safe retreat for
Duare and myself? I determined then to return Duare to Vepaja, that
she, at least, might be saved.</p>

<p>We were flying south along the course of Gerlat kum Rov, The
River of Death, toward the sea to which I knew the waters must
eventually guide me. I was flying low, as both Duare and I wished
to see the country rolling majestically beneath us. There were
forests and hills and plains and, in the distance, mountains; while
over all, like the roof of a colossal tent, stretched the inner
cloud envelope that entirely surrounds the planet; and which, with
the outer cloud bank, tempers the heat of the sun and makes life
possible on Venus. We saw herds of animals grazing on the plains,
but we saw no cities and no men. It was a vast wilderness that
stretched below us, beautiful but deadly&mdash;typically
Amtorian.</p>

<p>Our course was due south, and I believed that when we reached
the sea we would but have to continue on across it to find Vepaja.
Knowing that Vepaja was an island, and always having in mind that
some day I might wish to return to it, I had designed my ship with
retractable pontoons as well as ordinary landing gear.</p>

<p>The sight of the herds below us suggested food and stimulated my
appetite. I asked Duare if she were hungry. She said she
was&mdash;very&mdash;but asked what good it would do her.</p>

<p>"There's our dinner down there," I said, pointing.</p>

<p>"Yes, but by the time we get down there it will be gone," she
said. "Wait till they catch a glimpse of this thing. There won't be
one of them within miles by the time you get this thing on the
ground&mdash;unless it scares some of them to death."</p>

<p>She didn't say miles, of course; she said <i>klookob</i>,
<i>kob</i> being a unit of distance equivalent to 2.5 earth miles,
the prefix <i>kloo</i> denoting the plural. But she did say 'this
thing' in Amtorian.</p>

<p>"Please don't call my beautiful ship 'this thing,'" I
begged.</p>

<p>"But it is not a ship," she demurred. "A ship goes on water. I
have a name for it, Carson&mdash;it is an <i>anotar</i>."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" I applauded. "<i>Anotar</i> it shall be."</p>

<p>It was a good name, too; for <i>notar</i> means ship, and
<i>an</i> is the Amtorian word for bird&mdash;birdship. I thought
this better than airship, possibly because Duare had coined it.</p>

<p>I had an elevation of about a thousand feet; but as my motor was
absolutely noiseless, none of the animals beneath us was yet aware
of the strange thing hovering above them. As I started to spiral
downward, Duare gave a little gasp and touched my arm. She didn't
seize it, as some women might have; she just touched it, as though
the contact gave her assurance. It must have been rather a
terrifying experience for one who had never even seen an airship
before that morning.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going down after our dinner. Don't be frightened."</p>

<p>She said no more, but she still kept her hand on my arm. We were
dropping rapidly when suddenly one of the grazing animals looked
up; and, at sight of us, gave a loud snort of warning and went
careening off across the plain. Then they all stampeded. I
straightened out and went after them, dropping down until I was
just above their backs. At the altitude at which we had been
flying, the ground speed had probably seemed slow to her; so that
now that we were but a few feet above ground it surprised her to
find that we could easily outdistance the fleetest of the racing
beasts.</p>

<p>I do not consider that it is very sporting to shoot animals from
an airplane, but I was not indulging in sport&mdash;I was after
food, and this was about the only way that I could get it without
endangering our lives by stalking on foot; so it was without
compunction that I drew my pistol and brought down a fat young
yearling of some strange herbivorous species unknown to our world;
at least, I guess it was a yearling&mdash;it looked as though it
should be. The chase had brought us quite close to a fringe of
forest that grew along the banks of a tributary of the River of
Death; so that I had to bank quite sharply to avoid piling up among
the trees. When I glanced at Duare she was quite white, but she was
keeping a stiff upper lip. By the time I landed beside my kill, the
plain was deserted.</p>

<p>Leaving Duare in the cockpit, I got out to bleed and butcher the
animal. It was my intention to cut off as much meat as I thought
would remain fresh until we could use it and then take off and fly
to a more suitable temporary campsite.</p>

<p>I was working close beside the plane, and neither Duare nor I
faced the forest which lay but a short distance behind us. Of
course, we were careless in not maintaining a better watch; but I
suppose we were both intent on my butchering operations, which, I
must admit, were doubtless strange and wonderful to behold.</p>

<p>The first intimation I had of impending danger was a frightened
cry of "Carson!" from Duare. As I wheeled toward her, I saw fully a
dozen warriors coming for me. Three of them were right on top of me
with raised swords. I saw no chance of defending myself; and went
down beneath those swords like a felled ox, but not before the
brief glimpse I had of my attackers revealed the astonishing fact
that they were all women.</p>

<p>I must have lain there unconscious for more than an hour, and
when I regained consciousness I found myself alone&mdash;the
warriors and Duare were gone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">II. &mdash; WARRIOR WOMEN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">I CAME at that moment to being as nearly
spiritually crushed as I ever had been before in my life. To have
Duare and happiness snatched from me after a few brief hours, at
the very threshold of comparative security, completely unnerved me
for the moment. It was the more serious aspect of the situation
that gave me control of myself once more&mdash;the fate of
Duare.</p>

<p>I was pretty badly mussed up. My head and the upper part of my
body were caked with dried blood from several nasty sword cuts. Why
I had not been killed I shall never understand, and I am certain
that my attackers had left me for dead. My wounds were quite
severe, but none of them was lethal. My skull was intact; but my
head ached frightfully, and I was weak from shock and loss of
blood.</p>

<p>An examination of the ship showed that it had not been damaged
or tampered with; and as I glanced around the plain I saw that
which convinced me that its presence there had doubtless saved my
life, for there were several savage-appearing beasts pacing to and
fro some hundred yards away eyeing me hungrily. It must have been
the, to them, strange monster standing guard over me that kept them
at bay.</p>

<p>The brief glimpse I had had of the warrior women suggested that
they were not mere savages but had attained at least some degree of
civilization&mdash;their apparel and arms bespoke that. From this I
assumed that they must live in a village; and as they were on foot,
it was reasonable to suppose that their village was at no great
distance. I was sure that they must have come out of the forest
behind the ship and therefore that it was in this direction I must
search for Duare first.</p>

<p>We had seen no village before landing, as it seemed almost
certain that we should have had one of any size existed within a
few miles of our position, for both of us had been constantly on
the lookout for signs of the presence of human beings. To prosecute
my search on foot, especially in view of the presence of the savage
carnivores hungrily anticipating me, would have been the height of
foolishness; and if the village of the warrior women were in the
open I could find it more quickly and more easily from the
plane.</p>

<p>I was rather weak and dizzy as I took my place at the controls,
and only such an emergency as now confronted me could have forced
me into the air in the condition in which I was. However, I made a
satisfactory take-off; and once in the air my mind was so occupied
by my search that I almost forgot my hurts. I flew low over the
forest and as silently as a bird on the wing. If there were a
village and if it were built in the forest, it might be difficult
or even impossible to locate it from the air, but because of the
noiselessness of my ship it might be possible to locate a village
by sound could I fly low enough.</p>

<p>The forest was not of great extent; and I soon spanned it, but I
saw no village nor any sign of one. Beyond the forest was a range
of hills, and through a pass in them I saw a well worn trail. This
I followed; but I saw no village, though the landscape lay spread
before me for miles around. The hills were cut with little canyons
and valleys. It was rough country where one would least expect to
find a village; and so I gave up the search in this direction and
turned the nose of my ship back toward the plain where Duare had
been captured, intending to start my search from there in another
direction.</p>

<p>I was still flying very low, covering once more the ground I had
just been over, when my attention was attracted by the figure of a
human being walking rapidly across a level mesa. Dropping still
lower, I saw that it was a man. He was walking very rapidly and
constantly casting glances behind. He had not discovered the ship.
Evidently he was too much concerned with whatever was behind him,
and presently I saw what it was&mdash;one of those ferocious
lion-like creatures of Amtor, a tharban. The beast was stalking
him; but I knew that it would soon charge, and so I dropped quickly
in a steep dive. Nor was I a moment too soon.</p>

<p>As the beast charged, the man turned to face it with his
pitifully inadequate spear, for he must have known that flight was
futile. I had drawn my Amtorian pistol, charged with its deadly
r-ray; and as I flattened out just above the tharban, narrowly
missing a crack-up, I let him have it. I think it was more luck
than skill that permitted me to hit him at all; and as he rolled
over and over on the ground, I banked, circled the man and made a
landing behind him. He was the first human being I had seen since
the capture of Duare, and I wanted to question him. He was alone,
armed only with primitive weapons; and, so, absolutely in my
power.</p>

<p>I don't know why he didn't run away; for that airship must have
been an appalling thing to him; but he stood his ground even as I
taxied up and stopped near him. It may have been that he was just
paralyzed by fright. He was a small, rather insignificant looking
fellow wearing a loincloth so voluminous as to appear almost a
short skirt. About his throat were several necklaces of colored
stones and beads, while armlets, bracelets, and anklets similarly
fabricated adorned his limbs. His long black hair was coiled in two
knots, one upon either temple; and these were ornamented with tiny,
colored feathers stuck into them like arrows in a target. He
carried a sword, a spear, and a hunting knife.</p>

<p>As I descended from the ship and approached him, he backed away;
and his spear arm started back menacingly. "Who are you?" he asked.
"I don't want to kill you, but if you come any closer I'll have to.
What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to harm you," I assured him; "I just want to talk
to you." We spoke in the universal language of Amtor.</p>

<p>"What do you want to talk to me about?&mdash;but first tell me
why you killed the tharban that was about to kill and eat me?"</p>

<p>"So that it wouldn't kill and eat you."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "That is strange. You do not know me; we are
not friends; so why should you wish to save my life?"</p>

<p>"Because we are both men," I told him.</p>

<p>"That is a good idea," he admitted. "If all men felt that way we
would be treated better than we are. But even then, many of us
would be afraid. What is that thing you were riding in? I can see
now that it is not alive. Why does it not fall to the ground and
kill you?"</p>

<p>I had neither the time nor inclination to explain the science of
aerodromics to him; so I told him it stayed up because I made it
stay up.</p>

<p>"You must be a very wonderful man," he said admiringly. "What is
your name?"</p>

<p>"Carson&mdash;and yours?"</p>

<p>"Lula," he replied, and then, "Carson is a strange name for a
man. It sounds more like a woman's name."</p>

<p>"More so than Lula?" I asked, restraining a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, my, yes; Lula is a very masculine name. I think it is a
very sweet name, too; don't you?"</p>

<p>"Very," I assured him. "Where do you live, Lula?"</p>

<p>He pointed in the direction from which I had just come after
abandoning hope of finding a village there. "I live in the village
of Houtomai that is in The Narrow Canyon."</p>

<p>"How far is it?"</p>

<p>"About two <i>klookob</i>," he estimated.</p>

<p>Two <i>klookob</i>! That would be five miles of our system of
linear measurement, and I had flown back and forth over that area
repeatedly and hadn't seen any sign of a village.</p>

<p>"A little while ago I saw a band of warrior women with swords
and spears," I said. "Do you know where they live?"</p>

<p>"They might live in Houtomai," he said, "or in one of several
other villages. Oh, we Samary have many villages; we are very
powerful. Was one of the women large and powerful and with a deep
scar on the left side of her face?"</p>

<p>"I really didn't have much opportunity to observe them closely,"
I told him.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps not. If you'd gotten too close to them you'd be
dead now, but I thought maybe Bund might have been with them; then
I would have known that they were from Houtomai. Bund, you see, is
my mate. She is very strong, and really should be chief." He said
<i>jong</i>, which means king; but chief seems a better title for
the leader of a savage tribe, and from my brief intercourse with
the ladies of the Samary I could vouch for their savagery.</p>

<p>"Will you take me to Houtomai?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy, no," he cried. "They'd kill you, and after your
having saved my life I couldn't think of exposing you to
danger."</p>

<p>"Why would they want to kill me?" I demanded. "I never did
anything to them and don't intend to."</p>

<p>"That doesn't mean anything to the women of the Samary," he
assured me. "They don't like men very well, and they kill every
strange man they find in our country. They'd kill us, too, if they
weren't afraid the tribe would become extinct. They do kill some of
us occasionally, if they get mad enough. Bund tried to kill me
yesterday, but I could run too fast for her. I got away, and I've
been hiding out since. I think perhaps she's gotten over her anger
by now; so I'm going to sneak back and see."</p>

<p>"Suppose they captured a strange woman," I asked, "what would
they do with her?"</p>

<p>"They'd make a slave of her and make her work for them."</p>

<p>"Would they treat her well?"</p>

<p>"They don't treat anyone well&mdash;except themselves; they live
on the fat of the land," he said, resentfully.</p>

<p>"But they wouldn't kill her?" I asked. "You don't think they'd
do that, do you?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "They might. Their tempers are very short; and if a
slave makes a mistake, she'd certainly be beaten. Often they beat
them to death."</p>

<p>"Are you very fond of Bund?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Fond of Bund! Who ever heard of a man being fond of a woman? I
hate her. I hate them all. But what can I do about it? I must live.
If I went to another country, I'd be killed. If I stay here and try
to please Bund, I am fed and protected and have a place to sleep.
And then, too, we men do have a little fun once in a while. We can
sit around and talk while we're making sandals and loincloths, and
sometimes we play games&mdash;that is, when the women are out
hunting or raiding. Oh, it's better than being dead, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I'm in trouble, Lula; and I'm wondering if you won't help me.
You know we men should stick together."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I want you to lead me to the village of Houtomai."</p>

<p>He looked at me suspiciously, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Don't forget that I saved your life," I reminded him.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said. "I do owe you something&mdash;a debt of
gratitude, at least. But why do you want to go to Houtomai?"</p>

<p>"I want to see if my mate is there. She was stolen by some
warrior women this morning."</p>

<p>"Well, why do you want to get her back? I wish some one would
steal Bund."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't understand, Lula," I told him; "but I certainly do
want to get her back. Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"I could take you as far as the mouth of The Narrow Canyon," he
said; "but I couldn't take you into the village. They'd kill us
both. They'll kill you when you get there, anyway. If you had black
hair you might escape notice, but that funny yellow hair of yours
would give you away the very first thing. Now, if you had black
hair, you could sneak in after dark and come into one of the men's
caves. That way you might escape notice for a long time. Even if
some of the women saw you, they wouldn't know the difference. They
don't pay much attention to any but their own men."</p>

<p>"But wouldn't the men give me away?"</p>

<p>"No; they'd think it was a great joke&mdash;fooling the women.
If you were found out, we'd just say you fooled us, too. My, I wish
you had black hair."</p>

<p>I, too, wished then that I had black hair, if that would help me
get into the village of Houtomai. Presently, a plan occurred to
me.</p>

<p>"Lula," I asked, "did you ever see an <i>anotar</i> before?"
nodding toward the ship.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Never."</p>

<p>"Want to have a look at it?"</p>

<p>He said he'd like to; so I climbed into the cockpit, inviting
him to follow me. When he had seated himself beside me, I buckled
the safety belt across him to demonstrate it as I was explaining
its purpose.</p>

<p>"Would you like to take a ride?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Up in the air?" he demanded. "Mercy, I should say not."</p>

<p>"Well, just along the ground, then."</p>

<p>"Just a little way along the ground?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I promised, "just a little way along the ground," and I
wasn't lying to him. I taxied around until we were headed into the
wind; then I gave her the gun.</p>

<p>"Not so fast!" he screamed; and he tried to jump out, but he
didn't know how to unfasten the safety belt. He was so busy with it
that he didn't look up for several seconds. When he did, we were a
hundred feet off the ground and climbing rapidly. He gave one look,
screamed, and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"You lied to me," he cried. "You said we'd go just a little way
along the ground."</p>

<p>"We ran only a little way along the ground," I insisted. "I
didn't promise that I wouldn't go into the air." It was a cheap
trick, I'll admit; but there was more than life at stake for me,
and I knew that the fellow was perfectly safe. "You needn't be
afraid," I reassured him. "It's perfectly safe. I've flown millions
of <i>klookob</i> in perfect safety. Open your eyes and look
around. You'll get used to it in a minute or two, and then you'll
like it."</p>

<p>He did as I bid, and though he gasped a bit at first he soon
became interested and was craning his neck in all directions
looking for familiar landmarks.</p>

<p>"You're safer here than you would be on the ground," I told him;
"neither the women nor the tharbans can get you."</p>

<p>"That's right," he admitted.</p>

<p>"And you should be very proud, too, Lula."</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"As far as I know, you're the third human being ever to fly in
the air in Amtor, excepting the klangan; and I don't count them as
human, anyway."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "they're not&mdash;they're birds that can talk.
Where are you taking me?"</p>

<p>"We're there. I'm coming down now." I was circling above the
plain where I had made the kill before Duare was stolen. A couple
of beasts were feeding on the carcass, but they took fright and ran
away as the ship dropped near them for a landing. Jumping out, I
cut strips of fat from the carcass, threw them into the cockpit,
climbed in and took off. By this time, Lula was an enthusiastic
aeronaut, and if it hadn't been for the safety belt he would have
fallen out in one of his enthusiastic attempts to see everything in
all directions at one and the same time. Suddenly, he realized that
we were not flying in the direction of Houtomai.</p>

<p>"Hey!" he cried. "You're going in the wrong
direction&mdash;Houtomai is over there. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to get black hair," I told him.</p>

<p>He gave me a frightened look. I guess he thought he was up in
the air with a maniac; then he subsided, but he kept watching me
out of the corner of an eye.</p>

<p>I flew back to The River of Death, where I recalled having seen
a low, flat island; and, dropping my pontoons, landed on the water
and taxied into a little cove that indented the island. I managed,
after a little maneuvering, to get ashore with a rope and tie the
ship to a small tree; then I got Lula to come ashore and build me a
fire. I could have done it myself, but these primitive men
accomplish it with far greater celerity than I ever could acquire.
From a bush I gathered a number of large, waxlike leaves. When the
fire was burning well, I took most of the fat and dropped it in
piece by piece and very laboriously and slowly accumulated soot on
the waxy faces of the leaves. It took much longer than I had hoped
it would, but at last I had enough for my purpose. Mixing the soot
with a small quantity of the remaining fat I rubbed it thoroughly
into my hair, while Lula watched me with a broadening grin. From
time to time I used the still surface of the cove for a mirror, and
when I had completed the transformation I washed the soot from my
hands and face, using the ashes of the fire to furnish the
necessary lye to cut the greasy mess. At the same time, I washed
the blood from my face and body. Now I not only looked, but felt,
like a new man. I was rather amazed to realize that during all the
excitement of the day I had almost forgotten my wounds.</p>

<p>"Now, Lula," I said, "climb aboard and we'll see if we can find
Houtomai."</p>

<p>The take-off from the river was rather exciting for the
Amtorian, as I had to make a very long run of it because of the
smoothness of the water, throwing spray in all directions; but at
last we were in the air and headed for Houtomai. We had a little
difficulty in locating The Narrow Canyon because from this new
vantage point the ordinarily familiar terrain took on a new aspect
for Lula, but at last he gave a yell and pointed down. I looked and
saw a narrow canyon with steep walls, but I saw no village.</p>

<p>"Where's the village?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Right there," replied Lula, but still I could not see it; "but
you can't see the caves very well from here."</p>

<p>Then I understood&mdash;Houtomai was a village of cave dwellers.
No wonder I had flown over it many times without recognizing it. I
circled several times studying the terrain carefully, and also
watching the time. I knew that it must be quite close to sundown,
and I had a plan. I wanted Lula to go into the canyon with me and
show me the cave in which he dwelt. Alone, I could never have found
it. I was afraid that if I brought him to the ground too soon he
might take it into his head to leave for home at once; then there
would have been trouble, and I might have lost his help and
cooperation.</p>

<p>I had found what I considered a relatively safe place to leave
the ship, and as night was falling I brought her into a beautiful
landing. Taxiing to a group of trees, I tied her down as best I
could; but I certainly hated to go off and leave that beautiful
thing alone in this savage country. I was not much concerned for
fear that any beast would damage it. I was sure they would be too
much afraid of it to go near it for a long while, but I didn't know
what some ignorant human savages might do to it if they found it
there. However, there was nothing else to be done.</p>

<p>Lula and I reached The Narrow Canyon well after dark. It was not
a very pleasant trip, what with savage hunting beasts roaring and
growling in all directions and Lula trying to elude me. He was
commencing to regret his rash promises of help and think of what
would certainly happen to him if it were discovered that he had
brought a strange man into the village. I had to keep constantly
reassuring him that I would protect him and swear by all that an
Amtorian holds holy that I had never seen him, in the event that I
should be questioned by the women.</p>

<p>We reached the foot of the cliff, in which the caves of the
Houtamaians were carved, without exciting incident. Some fires were
burning on the ground&mdash;two fires, a large one and a small one.
Around the large fire were grouped a number of strapping women,
squatting, lying, standing. They shouted and laughed in loud tones
as they tore at pieces of some animal that had been cooking over
the fire. Around the smaller fire sat a few little men. They were
very quiet; and when they spoke, it was in low tones. Occasionally,
one of them would giggle; and then they would all look
apprehensively in the direction of the women, but the latter paid
no more attention to them than as though they had been so many
guinea pigs.</p>

<p>To this group of men, Lula led me. "Say nothing," he warned his
unwelcome guest, "and try not to call attention to yourself."</p>

<p>I kept to the rear of those gathered about the fire, seeking
always to keep my face in shadow. I heard the men greet Lula, and
from their manner I judged that a bond of friendship, welded from
their common misery and degradation, united them. I looked about in
search of Duare, but saw nothing of her.</p>

<p>"How is Bund's humor," I heard Lula inquire.</p>

<p>"As bad as ever," replied one of the men.</p>

<p>"Were the raids and the hunting good today? Did you hear any of
the women say?" continued Lula.</p>

<p>"They were good," came the reply. "There is plenty of meat now,
and Bund brought in a woman slave that she captured. There was a
man with her, whom they killed, and the strangest contraption that
anyone ever beheld. I think even the women were a little afraid of
it from what they said. At any rate, they evidently got away from
it as quickly as they could."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what that was," said Lula; "it was an anotar."</p>

<p>"How do you know what it was?" demanded one of the men.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;can't you take a joke?" demanded Lula in a
weak voice.</p>

<p>I smiled as I realized how nearly Lula's vanity had caused him
to betray himself. It was evident that while he may have trusted
his friends, he did not therefore trust them implicitly. And I
smiled also from relief, for I knew now that I had come to the
right village and that Duare was here&mdash;but where? I wanted to
question these men, but if Lula could not trust them, how might I?
I wanted to stand up and shout Duare's name. I wanted her to know
that I was here, eager to serve her. She must think me dead; and,
knowing Duare as I did, I knew that she might take her own life
because of hopelessness and despair. I must get word to her
somehow. I edged toward Lula, and when I was close to him whispered
in his ear.</p>

<p>"Come away. I want to talk to you," I said.</p>

<p>"Go away. I don't know you," whispered Lula.</p>

<p>"You bet you know me; and if you don't come with me, I'll tell
'em all where you've been all afternoon and that you brought me
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't do that!" Lula was trembling.</p>

<p>"Then come with me."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lula, and rising walked off into the shadows
beyond the fire.</p>

<p>I pointed toward the women. "Is Bund there?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, the big brute with her back toward us," replied Lula.</p>

<p>"Would her new slave be in Bund's cave?"</p>

<p>"Probably."</p>

<p>"Alone?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, another slave whom Bund could trust would be watching her,
so that she couldn't escape."</p>

<p>"Where is Bund's cave?"</p>

<p>"High up, on the third terrace."</p>

<p>"Take me to it," I directed.</p>

<p>"Are you crazy, or do you think I am?" demanded Lula.</p>

<p>"You are allowed on the cliff, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I wouldn't go to Bund's cave unless she sent for
me."</p>

<p>"You don't have to go there; just come with me far enough to
point it out to me."</p>

<p>He hesitated, scratching his head. "Well," he said, finally,
"that's as good a way as any to get rid of you; but don't forget
that you promised not to tell them that it was I who brought you to
the village."</p>

<p>I followed him up a rickety ladder to the first and then to the
second level, but as we were about to ascend to the third two women
started down from above. Lula became panicky.</p>

<p>"Come!" he whispered nervously and took me by the arm.</p>

<p>He led me along a precarious footwalk that ran in front of the
caves and to the far end of it. Trembling, he halted here.</p>

<p>"That was a narrow escape," he whispered. "Even with your black
hair you don't look much like a Samaryan man&mdash;you're as big
and strong as a woman; and that thing hanging at your
side&mdash;that would give you away. No one else has one. You'd
better throw it away."</p>

<p>He referred to my pistol, the only weapon I had brought, with
the exception of a good hunting knife. The suggestion was as
bizarre as Lula was naive. He was right in saying that its
possession might reveal my imposture, but on the other hand its
absence might insure my early demise. I did manage to arrange it,
however, so that it was pretty well covered by my loincloth.</p>

<p>As we were standing on the runway waiting for the two women to
get safely out of the way, I looked down upon the scene below, my
interest centering principally upon the group of women surrounding
the larger fire. They were strapping specimens, broad shouldered,
deep chested, with the sturdy limbs of gladiators. Their hoarse
voices rose in laughter, profanity, and coarse jokes. The firelight
played upon their almost naked bodies and their rugged, masculine
faces, revealing them distinctly to me. They were not unhandsome,
with their short hair and bronzed skins; but even though their
figures were, in a modified way, those of women, there seemed not
even a trace of femininity among them. One just could not think of
them as women, and that was all there was to it. As I watched them,
two of them got into an altercation. They started by calling each
other vile names; then they went at it hammer and tongs, and they
didn't fight like women. There was no hair pulling or scratching
there. They fought like a couple of icemen.</p>

<p>How different the other group around the smaller fire. With
mouselike timidity they furtively watched the fight&mdash;from a
distance. Compared with their women, their bodies were small and
frail, their voices soft, their manner apologetic.</p>

<p>Lula and I didn't wait to ascertain the outcome of the fight.
The two women who had interrupted our ascent passed down to a lower
level leaving us free to climb to the next runway where Bund's cave
was located. When we stood upon the catwalk of the third level,
Lula told me that Bund's cave was the third to my left. That done,
he was ready to leave me.</p>

<p>"Where are the men's caves?" I asked him before he could get
away.</p>

<p>"On the highest level."</p>

<p>"And yours?"</p>

<p>"The last cave to the left of the ladder," he said. "I'm going
there now. I hope I never see you again." His voice was shaking and
he was trembling like a leaf. It didn't seem possible that a man
could be reduced to such a pitiable state of abject terror, and by
a woman. Yet he had faced the tharban with a real show of courage.
With a shake of my head I turned toward the cave of Bund, the
warrior woman of Houtomai.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">III. &mdash; CAVES OF HOUTOMAI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE catwalks before the caves of the cliff
dwellers of Houtomai seemed most inadequate; but they served their
purpose, and I suppose the dwellers there, being accustomed to
nothing different, were content with them. Their construction was
simple but practical. Into holes bored in the face of the sandstone
cliff, straight tree limbs had been driven projecting about two
feet from the cliff. These were braced by other pieces, the lower
ends of which rested in notches cut about two feet below the holes.
Along the tops of these brackets, poles had been laid and lashed
down with rawhide. The runways seemed rather narrow when one
glanced down the face of the precipitous cliff, and there were no
handrails. I couldn't help but think how embarrassing it might be
to get into a fight on one of these catwalks. As these thoughts
passed through my mind, I made my way to the mouth of the third
cave to my left. All as quiet and the interior as dark as a
pocket.</p>

<p>"Hey! in there," I called.</p>

<p>Presently a sleepy feminine voice answered. "Who's that? What do
you want?"</p>

<p>"Bund wants her new slave sent down," I said.</p>

<p>I heard someone moving inside the cave, and almost immediately a
woman with dishevelled hair crawled to the entrance. I knew that it
was too dark for her to recognize features. All that I could hope
for was that she would be too sleepy to have her suspicions aroused
by my voice, which I didn't think sounded like the voices of the
men I had heard talking. I hoped not, anyway. However, I tried to
change it as much as I could, aping Lula's soft tones.</p>

<p>"What does Bund want of her?" she asked.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"It's very funny," she said. "Bund told me distinctly that I was
not to let her out of the cave under any circumstances. Oh, here
comes Bund now."</p>

<p>I glanced down. The fight was over, and the women were ascending
to their caves. To me that catwalk in front of Bund's cave looked
like a most unhealthy place to loiter, and I knew that it would be
impossible at this time to do anything for Duare; so I made my exit
as gracefully and as quickly as I could.</p>

<p>"I guess Bund changed her mind," I told the woman, as I turned
back toward the ladder that led to the upper catwalk. Fortunately
for me the slave woman was still half asleep, and doubtless her
principal concern at the moment was to get back to her slumbers.
She mumbled something about its being very odd, but before she
could go deeper into the matter with me I was on my way.</p>

<p>It didn't take me long to clamber the rickety ladder to the
catwalk in front of the men's caves and make my way to the last one
to the left of the ladder. The interior was as dark as a pocket and
smelled as though it needed airing and had needed it for several
generations.</p>

<p>"Lula!" I whispered.</p>

<p>I heard a groan. "You again?" asked a querulous voice.</p>

<p>"Your old friend, Carson himself," I replied. "You don't seem
glad to see me."</p>

<p>"I'm not. I hoped I'd never see you again. I hoped you'd be
killed. Why weren't you killed? You didn't stay there long enough.
Why did you come away?"</p>

<p>"I had to come up and see my old friend, Lula," I said.</p>

<p>"And then you will go right away again?"</p>

<p>"Not tonight. Maybe tomorrow. I certainly hope tomorrow."</p>

<p>He groaned again. "Don't let them see you coming out of this
cave tomorrow," he begged. "Oh, why did I tell you where my cave
was!"</p>

<p>"That was very stupid of you, Lula; but don't worry. I won't get
you in any trouble if you help me."</p>

<p>"Help you! Help you get your mate away from Bund? Why, Bund
would kill me."</p>

<p>"Well, let's not worry about it until tomorrow. We both need
sleep. But say, Lula, don't betray me. If you do, I'll tell Bund
the whole story. One more thing. Do you occupy this cave
alone?"</p>

<p>"No. Two other men are with me. They'll probably be up soon.
Don't talk to me any more after they come."</p>

<p>"You think they'd give us away?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he admitted; "but I'm not going to take any
chances."</p>

<p>After this we relapsed into silence. It wasn't long before we
heard footsteps outside, and a moment later the other two men
entered the cave. They had been carrying on a conversation, and
they brought the tail end of it in with them.</p>

<p>"&mdash;beat me; so I didn't say any more about it; but just
before we came up I heard the women talking about it. Nearly all
were in their caves at the time. It was just before we went down to
build the fires for the last meal, just before darkness came. I had
come out of the cave to go down when I happened to look up and see
it."</p>

<p>"Why did your woman beat you?"</p>

<p>"She said I was lying and that she didn't like liars, that she
couldn't abide them and that if I'd tell a silly lie like that I'd
lie about anything; but now two of the women said they saw it."</p>

<p>"What did your woman say to that?"</p>

<p>"She said I probably had a beating coming to me anyway."</p>

<p>"What did the thing look like?"</p>

<p>"Like a big bird, only it didn't flap its wings. It flew right
over the canyon. The women who saw it said it was the same thing
they saw sitting on the ground when they captured the new slave
today and killed the yellow-haired man."</p>

<p>"That thing must have been the anotar that Lula spoke of."</p>

<p>"But he said he was only joking."</p>

<p>"How could he joke about something he'd never seen? There's
something funny about this. Hey, Lula!" There was no response.
"Hey, you, Lula!" the man called again.</p>

<p>"I'm asleep," said Lula.</p>

<p>"Then you'd better wake up. We want to know about this anotar,"
insisted the man.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it; I never saw it; I never went up
in it."</p>

<p>"Who ever said you went up in it? How could a man go up in the
air in anything? It can't be done."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes it can," exclaimed Lula. "Two men can ride in it, maybe
four. It flies all around wherever you want it to go."</p>

<p>"I thought you didn't know anything about it."</p>

<p>"I am going asleep," announced Lula.</p>

<p>"You're going to tell us all about that anotar, or I'll tell
Bund on you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Vyla! You wouldn't do that?" cried Lula.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would so," insisted Vyla. "You'd better tell us
everything."</p>

<p>"If I do, will you promise not to tell <i>anyone</i>?"</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"And you, Ellie? Will you promise?" asked Lula.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't tell anyone on <i>you</i>, Lula; you ought to know
<i>that</i>," Ellie assured him. "Now, go on and tell us."</p>

<p>"Well, I have seen it; and I've ridden in it&mdash;way up in the
sky."</p>

<p>"Now you <i>are</i> lying, Lula," chided Vyla.</p>

<p>"Honest to gracious, I'm not," insisted Lula, "and if you don't
believe <i>me</i>, ask Carson."</p>

<p>I had been expecting the nit-wit to spill the beans; so I wasn't
greatly surprised. I think that if Lula had had an I.Q. rating it
would have been about decimal two.</p>

<p>"And who is Carson?" demanded Vyla.</p>

<p>"He makes the anotar go in the air," explained Lula.</p>

<p>"Well, how can we ask <i>him</i>? I think you are lying again,
Lula. You are getting into a bad habit of lying, lately."</p>

<p>"I am not lying, and if you don't believe me you can ask Carson.
He's right here in this cave."</p>

<p>"What?" demanded the two, in unison.</p>

<p>"Lula is not lying," I said. "I am here; also, Lula rode in the
anotar with me. If you two would like to ride, I'll take you up
tomorrow&mdash;if you can get me out of here without the women
seeing me."</p>

<p>For a while there was silence; then Ellie spoke in a rather
frightened voice. "What would Jad say if she knew about this?" he
asked. Jad was the chief.</p>

<p>"You promised not to tell," Lula reminded him.</p>

<p>"Jad needn't know, unless one of you tells her," I said; "and if
you do, I'll say that all three of you knew it and that you were
trying to get me to kill her."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't say that, would you?" cried Ellie.</p>

<p>"I certainly would. But if you'll help me, no one need ever
know; and you can get a ride in the anotar to boot."</p>

<p>"I'd be afraid," said Ellie.</p>

<p>"It's nothing to be afraid of," said Lula in a voice that
swaggered. "I wasn't afraid. You see the whole world all at once,
and nothing can get at you. I'd like to stay up there all the time.
I wouldn't be afraid of the tharbans then; I wouldn't even be
afraid of Bund."</p>

<p>"I'd like to go up," said Vyla. "If Lula wasn't afraid, nobody
would be."</p>

<p>"If you go up, I will," promised Ellie.</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Vyla.</p>

<p>Well, we talked a little longer; then, before going to sleep, I
asked some questions about the habits of the women, and found that
the hunting and raiding parties went out the first thing in the
morning and that they left a small guard of warrior women to
protect the village. I also learned that the slaves came down in
the morning and while the hunting and raiding parties were out,
gathered wood for the fires and brought water to the caves in clay
jugs. They also helped the men with the making of sandals,
loincloths, ornaments, and pottery.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The next morning I stayed in the cave until after the hunters and
raiders had left; then I descended the ladders to the ground. I had
learned enough about the women to be reasonably certain that I
would not arouse their suspicions, as their men are so
self-effacing and the women ignore them so completely that a woman
might recognize scarcely any of the men other than her mate; but I
was not so sure about the men. They all knew one another. What they
might do when they recognized a stranger among them was impossible
to foresee.</p>

<p>Half a dozen warrior women were loitering in a group near the
middle of the canyon while the men and slaves busied themselves
with their allotted duties. I saw some of them eyeing me as I
reached the ground and walked toward a group down canyon from them
where a number of female slaves were working, but they did not
accost me.</p>

<p>I kept away from the men as much as possible and approached the
female slaves. I was looking for Duare. My heart sank as I saw no
sign of her, and I wished that I had gone first to Bund's cave to
look for her. Some of the slaves looked at me questioningly; then
one of them spoke to me.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> ought to know," I told her; and while she was
puzzling that one out, I walked on.</p>

<p>Presently I saw some slaves emerging from a little side gully
with armfuls of wood, and among them I recognized Duare. My heart
leaped at sight of her. I sauntered to a point at which she would
have to pass me, waiting for the expression in those dear eyes when
she should recognize me. Closer and closer she came, and the nearer
she got the harder my heart pounded. When she was a couple of steps
away, she glanced up into my face; then she passed on without a
sign of recognition. For an instant I was crushed; then I was
angry, and I turned and overtook her.</p>

<p>"Duare!" I whispered.</p>

<p>She stopped and wheeled toward me. "Carson!" she exclaimed. "Oh,
Carson. What has happened to you?"</p>

<p>I had forgotten the black hair and the ugly wounds on my
forehead and cheek, the latter an ugly gash from temple to chin.
She actually had not known me.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you are not dead; you are not dead! I thought that they
had killed you. Tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not now, dear," I said. "We're going to get out of here
first."</p>

<p>"But how? What chance have we to escape while they are
watching?"</p>

<p>"Simply run away. I don't think we'll ever have a better
chance." I glanced quickly about. The warriors were still
unconcerned, paying no attention to us or anyone else. They were
superior beings who looked with contempt upon men and slaves. Most
of the slaves and men were farther up canyon than we, but there
were a few that we would have to pass.</p>

<p>"Are you going back for more wood?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are," she told me.</p>

<p>"Good. When you come back, try to walk at the very rear of the
others. I'll follow you into the canyon, if I can; unless a better
plan occurs to me. You'd better go on now."</p>

<p>After she left me, I boldly sought out Lula. The men who looked
at me eyed me suspiciously, but they are so stupid that they were
at first merely puzzled. They didn't think of doing anything about
it. I hoped that when they did, it would be too late to interfere
with my plans. When I found Lula and he saw who it was, he looked
about as happy as he would had he suddenly been confronted by a
ghost.</p>

<p>"Get Vyla and Ellie," I told him, "and come with me."</p>

<p>"What for?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Never mind. Do as I tell you, and do it quickly; or I'll tell
those women." He was too dumb to realize immediately that I
wouldn't dare do that; so he went and got Ellie and Vyla.</p>

<p>"What do you want of us?" demanded the latter.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take you for that ride in the anotar, just as I
promised you last night," I said.</p>

<p>They looked at each other questioningly. I could see that they
were afraid&mdash;probably frightened by the thought of flying, but
more frightened of the women.</p>

<p>Ellie choked. "I can't go today," he said.</p>

<p>"You are coming with me whether you go up in the anotar or not,"
I told them in no uncertain tones.</p>

<p>"What do you want of us?" asked Vyla.</p>

<p>"Come with me, and I'll show you. And don't forget that if you
don't do as I tell you I'll tell the women about that plan of yours
to have me kill Jad. Now, come!"</p>

<p>"You're a mean old thing," whined Vyla.</p>

<p>They had been kicked around so much all their lives and had
developed such colossal inferiority complexes that they were afraid
of everybody; and, if they weren't given too much time to think,
would obey anyone's commands; so they came with me.</p>

<p>The wood carriers had laid down their loads and were on their
way back to the side gully for more as I herded my unwilling
accomplices toward a point the slaves would have to pass; and as
they approached, I saw, to my vast relief, that Duare was trailing
the others. As she came opposite us, I gathered my three around her
to hide her, if possible, from the sight of the warrior women; then
I directed them at a loitering gait downward toward the mouth of
The Narrow Canyon. Right then I would have given a lot for a
rear-sight mirror; for I wanted to see what was going on behind us,
but didn't dare look back for fear of suggesting that we were doing
something we shouldn't be&mdash;it was a case of nonchalance or
nothing, and not a cigarette of any brand among us. I never knew
minutes to be so long; but finally we approached the lower end of
the canyon, and then I heard the hoarse voice of a woman shouting
at us.</p>

<p>"Hi, there! Where are you going? Come back here!"</p>

<p>With that, the three men stopped in their tracks; and I knew
that the jig was up as far as secrecy was concerned. I took Duare's
hand, and we kept on down the canyon. Now I could look back. Lula,
Vyla and Ellie were marching back to their masters; and three of
the women were coming down the canyon toward us. When they saw that
two of us had ignored their command and were walking on, they
commenced to shout again; and when we didn't pay any attention to
them they broke into a trot; then we took to our heels. I didn't
doubt but that we could outdistance them, for they were not built
for speed. However, we would have to get to the ship far enough
ahead of them to give us time to untie her before they overtook
us.</p>

<p>As we turned out of the mouth of The Narrow Canyon into the wide
canyon of which it is a branch, we came on fairly level ground
sloping gently in the direction we were going. Groups of splendid
trees dotted the landscape, and off there somewhere in the near
beyond was the ship and safety; then, squarely across our path and
a couple of hundred yards away, I saw three tharbans.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">IV. &mdash; A NEW LAND</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE sight of those three great beasts barring our
way was just about as discouraging as anything I have ever
encountered. Of course I had my pistol; but the rays don't always
kill immediately any more than bullets do, and even if I should
succeed in killing them the delay would permit the women to
overtake us. I could hear them shouting, and I was afraid their
voices might reach one of the hunting parties; so, all in all, I
was in a tough spot. Fortunately, they hadn't come out of The
Narrow Canyon yet; and I thought I saw a possible chance of eluding
them and the tharbans. We were close to a group of trees the dense
foliage of which would form an excellent hiding place; so I hoisted
Duare to a lower branch and swung up after her. Climbing well up,
we waited. Through the foliage we could look out, though I doubted
that anyone could see us.</p>

<p>The three tharbans had witnessed our ruse and were coming toward
the tree, but when the running warrior women hove into sight out of
the mouth of The Narrow Canyon the beasts paid no more attention to
us, but turned their attention to the women instead. The sight of
the tharbans brought the women to a sudden stop. I saw them looking
around for us; and then, as the tharbans advanced, they retreated
into The Narrow Canyon. The three beasts followed them, and the
moment that all were out of sight Duare and I dropped to the ground
and continued on toward the ship.</p>

<p>We could hear the roars and growls of the tharbans and the
shouts of the women growing fainter in the distance as we almost
ran in our eagerness to reach the anotar. What had appeared a few
moments before almost a catastrophe had really proved our
salvation, for now we had no need to fear pursuit from the village.
My only immediate concern now was the ship, and I can tell you that
I breathed a sigh of relief when we came in sight of it and I saw
that it was intact. Five minutes later we were in the air, and the
adventure of Houtomai was a thing of the past. Yet, how near it had
come to meaning death for me and a life of slavery for Duare! If
the warrior women had taken but an extra moment to make sure that I
was dead how very different the outcome would have been. I shall
always think that fear of the ship, a thing so strange to them,
caused them to hurry away. Duare says that they talked much about
the ship on the way back to the village and that it was evident
that they were troubled by it, not being quite sure that it was not
some strange beast that might pursue them.</p>

<p>We had much to talk about as I circled in search of game, that I
might make another kill; for I had not eaten for two days, and
Duare only a few mean scraps while she was the slave of Bund. Duare
kept looking at me and touching me to make sure that I was alive,
so certain had she been that the Samaryans had killed me.</p>

<p>"I should not have lived long, Carson, if you hadn't come," she
said. "With you dead, I didn't care to live&mdash;certainly not in
slavery. I was only waiting for an opportunity to destroy
myself."</p>

<p>I located a herd of antelope-like animals and made my kill much
as I had the previous day, but this time Duare kept vigilant
lookout while I attended to the butchering; then we flew to the
island where Lula and I had stopped while I transformed myself into
a brunette. This time I reversed the operation, after we had cooked
and eaten some of our meat. Once again we were happy and contented.
Our recent troubles now seemed very remote, so quickly does the
spirit of man rebound from depression and push black despair into
the limbo of forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Duare was much concerned about my wounds and insisted on bathing
them herself. The only danger, of course, was from infection; and
we had no means of disinfecting them. Naturally there was much less
danger than there would have been on Earth, where overpopulation
and increased means of transportation have greatly spread and
increased the numbers of malignant bacteria. Also, the longevity
serum with which I had been inoculated by Danus shortly after my
arrival upon Amtor gave me considerable immunity. All in all, I was
not much concerned; but Duare was like a hen with one chicken. She
had finally given in to her natural inclinations; and, having
admitted her love, she was lavishing on its object the devotion and
solicitude which raise love to its purest and most divine
heights.</p>

<p>We were both of us pretty well done in by all that we had been
through, and so we decided to remain at the island until the
following day at least. I was quite sure that there were no men and
no dangerous beasts there, and for the first time in many months we
could utterly relax without concern about the safety of our self or
that of the other. Those were the most perfect twenty-four hours I
had ever spent.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The next day we took off from our little island with real regret
and flew south along the valley of The River of Death down toward
the ocean into which we knew it must empty. But what ocean? What
lay beyond it? Where in all this vast world could we go?</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can find another little island somewhere," Duare
suggested, "and live there always, just you and I alone."</p>

<p>I didn't have the heart to tell her that in a few months we'd
probably be wanting to knife one another. I was really in a
quandary. It was impossible that we return to Vepaja. I knew now
definitely that Duare would rather die than be separated from me;
and there was no question but that I should be executed the moment
Mintep, her father, got his hands on me. My only reason for
planning to take Duare back to Vepaja had been my sincere belief
that, no matter what became of me, she would be happier there
eventually and certainly much safer than roaming around this savage
world with a man absolutely without a country; but now I knew
differently. I knew that either of us would rather be dead than
permanently separated from the other.</p>

<p>"We'll make a go of it some way," I told her, "and if there's a
spot on Amtor where we can find peace and safety we'll locate
it."</p>

<p>"We have fifty years before the anotar falls to pieces," said
Duare, with a laugh.</p>

<p>We had flown but a short time before I saw what appeared to be a
large body of water dead ahead, and such it soon proved to be. We
had come to the ocean at last.</p>

<p>"Let's go out over it and look for our island," said Duare.</p>

<p>"We'd better stock up with food and water first," I
suggested.</p>

<p>I had wrapped the remainder of our meat in the large, waxy
leaves I had found growing on the little island; and was sure that
it would keep for several days, but of course we didn't want to eat
it raw; and as we couldn't cook it while flying, there was nothing
to do but land and cook the meat. I also wanted to gather some
fruits and nuts and a tuber that grows almost everywhere on Amtor
and is quite palatable and nutritious&mdash;palatable even when
eaten raw.</p>

<p>I found an open flat that extended back from The River of Death
for several miles. It was forest bordered on one side, and a little
river ran through it down to the larger stream from mountains to
the east. I made a landing near the forest in the hope that I would
find such fruits and nuts as I desired, nor was I disappointed.
After gathering them, I loaded some firewood into the rear cockpit
and taxied over beside the small stream. Here we were in the open
where we could see the surrounding country in all directions and
therefore in no danger of being surprised by either man or beast. I
built a fire and cooked our meat while Duare kept watch. I also
filled the water tank with which I had equipped the ship at the
time it was built. We now had food and water sufficient for several
days, and filled with the spirit of exploration we took off and
headed out to sea, passing over the great delta of The River of
Death, a river that must rival the Amazon.</p>

<p>From the first, Duare had been keenly interested in the
navigation of the ship. I had explained the purpose and operation
of the controls, but she had not actually flown the anotar herself.
Now I let her try it, for I knew that she must learn to fly against
the possibility of our being in the air for long periods such as
might be necessitated by a transoceanic flight. I would have to
have sleep, and this would not be possible in the air unless Duare
could fly the ship. Now, flying a ship in the air under ordinary
weather conditions is not even so difficult as walking; so it
required only a few minutes to establish her confidence and give
her something of the feel of the ship. I knew that practice would
give her smoothness, and I had her fly at an altitude that would
permit me to come to the rescue if she got in any trouble.</p>

<p>We flew all that night with Duare at the controls about a third
of the time, and when morning broke I sighted land. As far as I
could see to the east and west the boles and foliage of great trees
rose thousands of feet to disappear in the inner cloud envelope
which floats forever over the entire expanse of Amtor, a second
defense to the outer cloud envelope against the intense heat of the
sun that would otherwise burn the surface of the planet to a
crisp.</p>

<p>"That aspect looks familiar," I said to Duare when she
awoke.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I think it is Vepaja. We'll skirt the coast, and if I'm right
we will see the natural harbor where the Sofal and the Sovong lay
at anchor the day that you were kidnaped and Kamlot and I were
captured by the klangan. I'm sure I shall recognize it."</p>

<p>Duare said nothing. She was silent for a long time as we flew
along the coast. Presently I saw the harbor.</p>

<p>"There it is," I said. "This is Vepaja, Duare."</p>

<p>"Vepaja," she breathed.</p>

<p>"We are here, Duare. Do you want to stay?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Not without you." I leaned toward her and
kissed her.</p>

<p>"Where then?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, let's just keep on going. One direction's as good as
another."</p>

<p>The ship, at the time, was flying perhaps a couple of points
north of west; so I simply maintained that course. The world ahead
of us was absolutely unknown, as far as we were concerned; and as
this course would keep us away from the antarctic regions and well
into the northern part of the south temperate zone, it seemed as
good a course to hold as any. In the opposite direction lay the
stronghold of the Thorists, where we could hope to find only
captivity and death.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
As the long day wore away, nothing but illimitable ocean stretched
monotonously before us. The ship functioned beautifully. It could
not function otherwise, since into its construction had gone the
best that the finest scientific minds of Havatoo could give. The
design had been mine, as aircraft were absolutely undreamed of in
Havatoo prior to my coming; but the materials, the motor, the fuel
were exclusively Amtorian. For strength, durability, and lightness
the first would be impossible of duplication on Earth; the motor
was a marvel of ingenuity, compactness, power and durability
combined with lightness of weight; the fuel I have already
described. In design the ship was more or less of a composite of
those with which I was familiar or had myself flown on Earth. It
seated four, two abreast in an open front cockpit and two in a
streamlined cabin aft; there were controls in both cockpits, and
the ship could be flown from any of the four seats. As I have
before stated, it was an amphibian.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
During the long day I varied the monotony by instructing Duare in
landings and take-offs, there being a gentle westerly breeze. We
had to keep a sharp lookout at these times for the larger denizens
of the sea, some of which might easily have wrecked the ship had
their dispositions been as fearsome as their appearance.</p>

<p>As night fell, the vast Amtorian scene was bathed in the soft,
mysterious, nocturnal light that beneficient Nature has vouchsafed
a moonless planet. Seemingly as limitless as interstellar space,
the endless sea rolled to the outer rim of our universe, glowing
wanly. No land, no ship, no living thing impinged upon the awful
serenity of the scene&mdash;only our silent plane and we two
infinitesimal atoms wandering aimlessly through space. Duare moved
a little closer to me. Companionship was good in this infinite
loneliness.</p>

<p>During the night the wind veered and blew from the south, and at
dawn I saw cloud banks rolling in ahead of us. The air was much
cooler. It was evident that we were getting the tail end of a south
polar storm. I didn't like the looks of that fog. I had blind
flying instruments on the instrument board; but, even so, who would
care to fly blind in a world concerning the topography of which he
knew nothing? Nor was I particularly keen to chance waiting the fog
out on the surface of the sea. The chances are it would have been
safe enough, but I had seen far too many leviathans cavorting about
in the waters beneath us to incline me toward spending any more
time on the surface of the water than was absolutely necessary. I
determined to change our course and fly north ahead of the fog. It
was then that Duare pointed ahead.</p>

<p>"Isn't that land?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It certainly has all the appearances of land," I said, after
taking a long look.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is our island," she suggested laughingly.</p>

<p>"We'll go and have a look at it before the fog rolls over it. We
can always beat that fog if it gets too thick."</p>

<p>"Land will look pretty good again," said Duare.</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed. "We've been looking at an awful lot of
water."</p>

<p>As we approached the coast line we saw mountains in the distance
and far to the northwest what appeared to be one of those giant
tree forests such as cover almost the entire area of the island of
Vepaja.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a city!" exclaimed Duare.</p>

<p>"So it is&mdash;a seaport. Quite a good-sized city, too. I
wonder what kind of people live there."</p>

<p>Duare shook her head. "I don't know. There is a land northwest
of Vepaja that is called Anlap. I have seen it on the map. It lies
partially in Trabol and partially in Strabol. The maps show it as
an island, a very large island; but of course nobody knows. Strabol
has never been thoroughly explored."</p>

<p>It seemed to me that none of Venus had ever been thoroughly
explored, nor could I wonder. The most able men I had met here
clung to the belief that it was a saucer-shaped world floating on a
molten sea. They thought that its greatest circumference lay at
what I knew to be the south pole, and on their maps the equator was
not even a dot. They never dreamed of the existence of another
hemisphere. With maps based on such erroneous reasoning, everything
was distorted; and because their maps were therefore useless, no
navigator dared go far from familiar waters and seldom out of sight
of land.</p>

<p>As we approached the city I saw that it was walled and heavily
fortified, and closer inspection revealed the fact that it was
being beleaguered by a large force. The hum of Amtorian guns came
faintly to our ears. We saw the defenders on the walls; and, beyond
the walls, we saw the enemy&mdash;long lines of men encircling the
city, each lying behind his shield. These shields are composed of
metal more or less impervious to both r-rays and T-rays; and their
use must result in far more mobile attacking forces than could have
been possible were the men facing earthly bullets; it practically
amounted to each man carrying his own trench. The troops could be
maneuvered almost anywhere on the field of battle while under fire,
with a minimum of casualties.</p>

<p>As we passed over the city, firing practically ceased on both
sides. We could see thousands of faces upturned toward us, and I
could imagine the wonder and amazement that the ship must have
engendered in the minds of those thousands of soldiers and
civilians, not one of whom could possibly have conceived the nature
of this giant, birdlike thing speeding silently above them. As
every portion of the ship, whether wood, metal, or fabric, had been
sprayed with a solution of this ray-resisting substance I felt
quite safe in flying low above the contending forces; and so I
spiralled downward and, circling, flew close above the city's wall.
Then I leaned out and waved my hand. A great shout rose from the
men within the city, but the attackers were silent for a moment;
then a volley of shots were directed at us.</p>

<p>The ship might have been coated with ray-resisting material; but
Duare and I were not, and so I zoomed to a safer altitude and
turned the ship's nose inland to reconnoiter farther. Beyond the
lines of the infesting forces we flew over their main camp, beyond
which a broad highway led toward the southwest, from which
direction troops were marching toward the camp; and there were long
trains of wagons drawn by huge, elephantine animals, and men
mounted on strange beasts, and big T-ray guns, and all the other
impedimenta of a great army on the march.</p>

<p>Turning toward the north, I reconnoitered in search of
information. I wanted to know something about this country and the
disposition of its inhabitants. From what I had already seen, their
dispositions seemed unequivocally warlike; but somewhere there
might be a peaceful, hospitable city where strangers would be
treated with consideration. What I was looking for was a single
individual whom I might question without risking injury to Duare or
myself, for to have made a landing among those fighting men would
probably have been fatal&mdash;especially among comrades of the
contingent that had fired on us. The attitude of the defenders of
the city had been more friendly; but still I couldn't risk a
landing there without knowing something about them, nor did it seem
the part of wisdom to land in a beleaguered city that, from the
number of its attackers, might be taken any day. Duare and I were
looking for peace, not war.</p>

<p>I covered a considerable area of territory without seeing a
human being, but at last I discovered a lone man coming out of a
canyon in the hills several miles north of the big camp I have
mentioned. As I dropped toward him, he turned and looked up. He did
not run; but stood his ground, and I saw him draw the pistol at his
hip.</p>

<p>"Don't fire!" I called to him as I glided past. "We are
friends."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he shouted back.</p>

<p>I circled and flew back, landing a couple of hundred yards from
him. "I am a stranger here," I shouted to him. "I want to ask for
information."</p>

<p>He approached the ship quite boldly, but he kept his weapon in
readiness for any eventuality. I dropped down from the cockpit and
went forward to meet him, raising my right hand to show that it
held no weapon. He raised his left&mdash;he wasn't taking any
chances; but the gesture signified a friendly attitude, or at least
not a belligerent one.</p>

<p>A half smile touched his lips as I descended from the ship. "So
you <i>are</i> a human being, after all," he said. "At first I
didn't know but that you were a part of that thing, whatever it is.
Where are you from? What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"We are strangers here," I told him. "We do not even know in
what country we are. We want to know the disposition of the people
here toward strangers, and if there is a city where we might be
received hospitably."</p>

<p>"This is the land of Anlap," he said, "and we are in the kingdom
of Korva."</p>

<p>"What city is that back by the sea? There was fighting going on
there."</p>

<p>"You saw fighting?" he demanded. "How was it going? Had the city
fallen?" He seemed eager for news.</p>

<p>"The city had not fallen," I said, "and the defenders seemed in
good spirits."</p>

<p>He breathed a sigh of relief. Suddenly his brow clouded. "How do
I know you're not a Zani spy?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I shrugged. "You don't," I said, "but I'm not. I don't even know
what a Zani is."</p>

<p>"No, you couldn't be," he said presently. "With that yellow hair
of yours I don't know what you could be&mdash;certainly not of our
race."</p>

<p>"Well, how about answering some of my questions?" I inquired
with a smile.</p>

<p>He smiled in return. "That's right. You wanted to know the
disposition of the people of Korva to strangers and the name of the
city by the sea. Well, before the Zanis seized the government, you
would have been treated well in any Korvan city. But now it is
different. Sanara, the city you asked about, would welcome you; it
has not yet fallen under the domination of the Zanis. They are
trying to reduce it now, and if it capitulates the last stronghold
of freedom in Korva will have fallen."</p>

<p>"You are from Sanara?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, at present. I had always lived in Amlot, the capitol,
until the Zanis came into power; then I couldn't go back, because I
had been fighting them."</p>

<p>"I just flew over a big camp south of here," I said; "was that a
Zani camp?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'd give anything to see it. How many men have they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but it's a large camp, and more soldiers and
supplies are coming in from the southwest."</p>

<p>"From Amlot," he said. "Oh, if I could but see that!"</p>

<p>"You can," I told him.</p>

<p>"How?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I pointed toward the ship. He looked just a little bit taken
aback, but only for a second.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "You will not regret your kindness. May I
ask your name? Mine is Taman."</p>

<p>"And mine is Carson."</p>

<p>He looked at me curiously. "What country are you from? I have
never before seen an Amtorian with yellow hair."</p>

<p>"It is a long story," I said. "Suffice it to say that I am not
an Amtorian; I am from another world."</p>

<p>We walked toward the ship together, he, in the meantime, having
returned his pistol to its holster. When we reached it, he saw
Duare for the first time. I could just note a faint expression of
surprise, which he hid admirably. He was evidently a man of
refinement. I introduced them, and then showed him how to enter the
rear cockpit and fasten his lifebelt.</p>

<p>Of course I couldn't see him when we took off, but he afterward
told me that he believed his end had come. I flew him directly back
to the Zani camp and along the highway toward Amlot.</p>

<p>"This is wonderful!" he exclaimed time and again. "I can see
everything. I can even count the battalions and the guns and the
wagons."</p>

<p>"Tell me when you've seen enough," I said.</p>

<p>"I think I've seen all that's necessary. Poor Sanara! How can it
withstand such a horde? And I may not even be able to get back and
make my report. The city must be surrounded by troops by now. I
just barely got out an <i>ax</i> ago." An <i>ax</i> is equivalent
to twenty days of Amtorian time, or slightly over twenty-two days,
eleven hours of Earth time.</p>

<p>"The city is entirely surrounded," I told him. "I doubt that you
could possibly pass through the lines even at night."</p>

<p>"Would you&mdash;" he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Would I what?" I asked, though I guessed what he wished to ask
me.</p>

<p>"But no," he said; "it would be too much to ask of a stranger.
You would be risking your life and that of your companion."</p>

<p>"Is there any place large enough for me to land inside the walls
of Sanara?" I asked.</p>

<p>He laughed. "You guessed well," he said. "How much space do you
require?"</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "there is a large field near the center of town
where races were held. You could land there easily."</p>

<p>"A couple of more questions," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Certainly! Ask as many as you please."</p>

<p>"Have you sufficient influence with the military authorities to
insure our safety? I am, of course, thinking of my mate. I cannot
risk harm befalling her."</p>

<p>"I give you the word of a nobleman that you will both be safe
under my protection," he assured me.</p>

<p>"And that we shall be permitted to leave the city whenever we
choose, and that our ship will not be molested or detained?"</p>

<p>"Again you have my word for all that you have asked," he said;
"but still I think it is too much to ask of you&mdash;too much to
permit you to do for a stranger."</p>

<p>I turned to Duare. "What is your answer, Duare?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I think that I shall like Sanara," she said.</p>

<p>I turned the ship's nose in the direction of the Korvan
seaport.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">V. &mdash; SANARA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">TAMAN was profuse in his gratitude, but not too
profuse. I felt from the first that he was going to prove a likable
fellow; and I know that Duare liked him, too. She ordinarily seldom
enters into conversation with strangers. The old taboos of the
jong's daughter are not to be easily dispelled, but she talked with
Taman on the flight to Sanara, asking him many questions.</p>

<p>"You will like our people," he told her. "Of course, now, under
the strain of a long siege, conditions are not normal nor are the
people; but they will welcome you and treat you well. I shall take
you both into my own home, where I know that my wife can make you
comfortable even under the present conditions."</p>

<p>As we passed over the Zanis' lines they commenced to take pot
shots at us, but I was flying too high for their fire to have been
effective even against an unprotected ship. Taman and I had
discussed the matter of landing. I was a little fearful that the
defenders might become frightened at this strange craft were it to
attempt a landing in the city, especially as this time we would be
approaching from enemy country. I suggested a plan which he thought
might work out satisfactorily; so he wrote a note on a piece of
paper which he had and tied it to one of the large nuts we had
brought with us. In fact he wrote several notes, tying each one to
a different nut. Each note stated that he was in the anator they
saw flying above the city and asked the commander to have the
racing field cleared so that we could make a safe landing. If the
note were received and permission to land was granted, they were to
send several men with flags to the windward end of the field with
instructions to wave them until they saw us come in for a landing.
This would accomplish two purposes&mdash;show us that we would not
be fired on and also give me the direction of the wind at the
field.</p>

<p>I dropped the notes at intervals over the city, and then circled
at a safe distance awaiting the outcome of our plan. I could see
the field quite distinctly, and that there were quite a few people
on it&mdash;far too many to make a landing safe. Anyway, there was
nothing to do but wait for the signal. While we were waiting, Taman
pointed out places of interest in the city&mdash;parks, public
buildings, barracks, the governor's palace. He said that the jong's
nephew lived there now and ruled as jong, his uncle being a
prisoner of the Zanis at Amlot. There were even rumors that the
jong had been executed. It was that that the defenders of Sanara
feared as much as they feared the Zanis, because they didn't trust
the jong's nephew and didn't want him as permanent jong.</p>

<p>It seemed as though we'd circled over the city for an hour
before we received any indication that our notes had been received;
then I saw soldiers clearing the people out of the racing field.
That was a good omen; then a dozen soldiers with flags went to one
end of the field and commenced to wave them. At that I commenced to
drop in a tight spiral&mdash;you see I didn't want to go too near
the city walls for fear of attracting the fire of the Zanis.</p>

<p>Looking down, I saw people converging upon that field from all
directions. The word that we were going to land must have spread
like wildfire. They were coming in droves, blocking the avenues. I
hoped that a sufficient detail of soldiers had been sent to keep
them from swarming over the field and tearing us and the plane to
pieces. I was so worried that I zoomed upward again and told Taman
to write another note asking for a large military guard to keep the
people away from the ship. This he did, and then I dropped down
again and tossed the note out on the field near a group of men that
Taman told me were officers. Five minutes later we saw a whole
battalion marched onto the field and posted around the edges; then
I came in for a landing.</p>

<p>Say, but weren't those people thrilled! They were absolutely
breathless and silent until the ship rolled almost to a stop; then
they burst into loud cheering. It certainly made me feel pretty
good to realize that we were welcome somewhere in the world, for
our situation had previously seemed utterly hopeless, realizing, as
we did from past experience, that strangers are seldom welcome in
any Amtorian city. My own experience on the occasion of my landing
in Vepaja from my rocket ship had borne this out; for, though I was
finally accepted, I had been a virtual prisoner in the palace of
the jong for a long period of time.</p>

<p>After Taman alighted from the ship, I started to help Duare out;
and as she stepped onto the wing in full view of the crowd the
cheering stopped and there was a moment of breathless silence; then
they burst forth again. It was a wonderful ovation they gave Duare.
I think they hadn't realized that the third member of the party was
a woman until she stepped into full view. The realization that it
was a woman, coupled with her startling beauty, just simply took
their breath away. You may be sure that I loved the people of
Sanara from that moment.</p>

<p>Several officers had approached the ship, and there were
greetings and introductions of course. I noted the deference they
accorded Taman, and I realized my good fortune in having placed a
really important man under obligations to me. Just how important a
personage he really was, I was not to learn until later.</p>

<p>While we had been circling the field I had noticed a number of
the huge animals, such as I had seen drawing the gun carriages and
army wagons of the Zanis, standing at one side of the field behind
the crowd. Several of the beasts were now brought onto the field
and up to the ship, or as close as their drivers could urge them;
for they were quite evidently afraid of this strange thing. I now
got my first close view of a gantor. The animal was larger than an
African elephant and had legs very similar to those of that animal,
but here the likeness ceased. The head was bull-like and armed with
a stout horn about a foot long that grew out of the center of the
forehead; the mouth was large, and the powerful jaws were armed
with very large teeth; the coat, back of the shoulders, was short
and a light tawny yellow marked with white splotches like a pinto
horse; while covering the shoulders and short neck was a heavy dark
mane; the tail was like that of a bull; three enormous horny toes
covered the entire bottoms of the feet, forming hoofs. The driver
of each animal sat on the mane above the shoulders; and behind him,
on the creature's long, broad back was an open howdah capable of
seating a dozen people. That, at least, describes the howdah of the
first beast I noted closely. I saw later that there are many forms
of howdahs, and in fact the one on the animal that was brought to
carry Duare, Taman, and me from the field was a very ornate howdah
seating four. Along the left side of each gantor a ladder was
lashed, and when the drivers had coaxed their mounts as close as
they could to the ship each driver dropped to the ground and set
his ladder up against his beast's side. Up these ladders the
passengers climbed to the howdahs. I watched the whole procedure
with interest, wondering how the driver was going to regain his
seat if he lashed the ladder back to the gantor's side or what he
would do with the ladder if he used it to climb back onto the
gantor.</p>

<p>Well, I soon had my curiosity satisfied. Each driver lashed his
ladder back in place against the gantor's side; then he walked
around in front of the gantor and gave a command. Instantly the
animal lowered its head until its nose almost touched the ground,
which brought its horn into a horizontal position about three feet
above the ground. The driver climbed onto the horn and gave another
command, the gantor raised its head, and the driver stepped to its
poll and from there to his seat above the shoulders.</p>

<p>The howdahs of the other gantors were filled with officers and
soldiers who acted as our escort from the field, some preceding and
some following us off the field and along a broad avenue. As we
passed, the people raised their hands in salute, the arms extended
at an angle of about forty-five degrees, their palms crossed. I
noticed that they did this only as our gantor approached; and I
soon realized that they were saluting Taman, as he acknowledged the
salutes by bowing to the right and left. So once again I had
evidence that he was a man of importance.</p>

<p>The people on the street wore the scant apparel that is common
on Amtor, where it is usually warm and sultry; and they also wore,
according to what seems to be a universal custom, daggers and
swords, the women the former, the men both. The soldiers among them
also carried pistols slung in holsters at their hips. They were a
very nice, clean looking people with pleasant faces. The buildings
facing the avenue were stuccoed; but of what materials they were
built, I did not know. The architectural lines were simple but most
effective; and notwithstanding the simpleness of the designs, the
builders had achieved a diversity that gave pleasing contrasts.</p>

<p>As we proceeded and turned into another avenue the buildings
became larger and more beautiful, but still the same simplicity of
line was apparent. As we were approaching a rather large building,
Taman told me it was the palace of the governor, where the nephew
of the jong lived and ruled in the absence of his uncle. We stopped
in front of another large home directly across the street from the
governor's palace. A guard of soldiers stood before an enormous
gate built in the center of the front wall, which was flush with
the sidewalk. They saluted Taman, and swung the gate open. Our
escort had previously moved back across the avenue, and now our
driver guided his huge mount through the gateway along a wide
corridor into an enormous courtyard where there were trees and
flowers and fountains. This was the palace of Taman.</p>

<p>A small army of people poured from the building, whom, of
course, I could not identify but whom I learned later were officers
and officials of the palace, retainers, and slaves. They greeted
Taman with the utmost deference, but their manner indicated real
affection.</p>

<p>"Inform the janjong that I have returned and am bringing guests
to her apartments," Taman directed one of the officers.</p>

<p>Now janjong means, literally, daughter of a jong; in other
words, a princess. It is the official title of the daughter of a
living jong, but it is often used through life as a courtesy title
after a jong dies. A tanjong, son of a jong, is a prince.</p>

<p>Taman himself showed us our apartments, knowing that we would
wish to freshen ourselves up before being presented to the janjong.
Women slaves took Duare in hand and a man slave showed me my bath
and brought me fresh apparel.</p>

<p>Our apartments, consisting of three rooms and two baths, were
beautifully decorated and furnished. It must have been like heaven
to Duare who had known nothing of either beauty or comfort since
she had been stolen from her father's palace over a year
before.</p>

<p>When we were ready an officer came and conducted us to a small
reception room on the same floor but at the opposite end of the
palace. Here Taman was awaiting us. He asked me how we should be
introduced to the janjong, and when I told him Duare's title I
could see that he was both pleased and surprised. As for myself, I
asked him to introduce me as Carson of Venus. Of course the word
Venus meant nothing to him, as the planet is known to the
inhabitants as Amtor. We were then ushered into the presence of the
janjong. The formality of introductions on Amtor are both simple
and direct; there is no circumlocution. We were led into the
presence of a most beautiful woman, who arose and smiled as we
approached her.</p>

<p>"This is my wife, Jahara, janjong of Korva," announced Taman;
then he turned to Duare. "This is Duare, janjong of Vepaja, wife of
Carson of Venus," and, indicating me, "This is Carson of Venus." It
was all very simple. Of course Taman didn't say wife&mdash;there is
no marriage among any of the peoples I have known on Amtor. A
couple merely agree between themselves to live together, and they
are ordinarily as faithful to one another as married couples on
Earth are supposed to be. They may separate and take other mates if
they choose, but they rarely do. Since the serum of longevity was
discovered many couples have lived together for a thousand years in
perfect harmony&mdash;possibly because the tie that bound them was
not a fetter. The word that Taman used instead of wife was
ooljaganja&mdash;lovewoman. I like it.</p>

<p>During our visit with Taman and Jahara we learned many things
concerning them and Korva. Following a disastrous war, in which the
resources of the nation had been depleted, a strange cult had
arisen conceived and led by a common soldier named Mephis. He had
usurped all the powers of government, seized Amlot, the capital,
and reduced the principal cities of Korva with the exception of
Sanara, to which many of the nobility had flocked with their loyal
retainers. Mephis had imprisoned Jahara's father, Kord, hereditary
jong of Korva, because he would not accede to the demand of the
Zanis and rule as a figurehead dominated by Mephis. Recently rumors
had reached Sanara that Kord had been assassinated, that Mephis
would offer the jongship to some member of the royal family, that
he would assume the title himself; but no one really knew anything
about it.</p>

<p>We also inferred, though no direct statement to that effect was
made, that the jong's nephew, Muso, acting jong, was none too
popular. What we didn't learn until much later was that Taman, who
was of royal blood, was directly in line for the throne after Muso
and that Muso was intensely jealous of Taman's popularity with all
classes of people. When we had picked Taman up behind the enemy
lines he had been returning from a most hazardous assignment upon
which Muso had sent him, possibly in the hope that he would never
return.</p>

<p>Food was served in the apartments of Jahara; and while we were
eating, an officer of the jong was announced. He brought a
gracefully worded intimation that Muso would be glad to receive us
immediately if Taman and Jahara would bring us to the palace and
present us. It was, of course, a command.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
We found Muso and his consort, Illana, in the audience room of the
palace surrounded by a considerable retinue. They were seated on
impressive thrones, and it was evident that Muso was taking his
jongship very seriously. So great was his dignity that he did not
condescend to smile, though he was courteous enough. The closest
his equilibrium came to being upset was when his eyes fell on
Duare. I could see that her beauty impressed him, but I was
accustomed to that&mdash;it usually startled people.</p>

<p>He kept us in the audience chamber only long enough to conclude
the formalities; then he led us into a smaller room.</p>

<p>"I saw the strange thing in which you fly as it circled above
the city," he said. "What do you call it? and what keeps it in the
air?"</p>

<p>I told him that Duare had christened it an anotar, and then I
explained briefly the principle of heavier-than-air craft
flight.</p>

<p>"Has it any practical value?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In the world from which I come airlines have been established
that transport passengers, mail, and express between all the large
cities and to every portion of the world; civilized governments
maintain great fleets of planes for military purposes."</p>

<p>"But how could an anotar be used for military purposes?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"For reconnaissance, for one thing," I told him. "I flew Taman
over the enemy camp and along its line of communication. They can
be used for destroying supply bases, for disabling batteries, even
for direct attack upon enemy troops."</p>

<p>"How could your ship be used against the Zanis?" he asked.</p>

<p>"By bombing their lines, their camp, and their supply depots and
trains we might lower their morale. Of course with but a single
ship we could not accomplish much."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," said Taman. "The psychological
effect of this new engine of destruction might be far more
effective than you imagine."</p>

<p>"I agree with Taman," said Muso.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to serve the jong of Korva in any way," I
said.</p>

<p>"Will you accept a commission under me?" he asked. "It will mean
that you must swear allegiance to the jong of Korva."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked. "I have no country on Amtor, and the ruler
and people of Sanara have accorded us courtesy and hospitality,"
and so I took the oath of allegiance to Korva and was commissioned
a captain in the army of the jong. Now, at last, I had a country;
but I also had a boss. That part of it I didn't like so well, for,
if I am nothing else, I am a rugged individualist.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">VI. &mdash; A SPY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE next few weeks were filled with interest and
excitement. The Sanarans manufactured both r-ray and T-ray bombs as
well as incendiary bombs, and I made almost daily flights over the
enemy lines and camp. In the latter and along their line of
communication I wrought the most havoc, but a single ship could not
win a war. On several occasions I so demoralized their front line
that successful sorties were made by the Sanarans during which
prisoners were taken. From these we learned the repeated bombings
had had their effect on the morale of the enemy and that an
enormous reward had been offered by the Zani chief, Mephis, for the
destruction of the ship or for my capture dead or alive.</p>

<p>During these weeks we remained the guests of Taman and Jahara,
and were entertained frequently by Muso, the acting jong, and his
wife, Illana. The latter was a quiet, self-effacing woman of high
lineage but of no great beauty. Muso usually ignored her; and when
he didn't, his manner toward her was often brusque and almost
offensive; but she was uniformly sweet and unresentful. He was far
more attentive to Duare than he was to his own wife, but that is
oftentimes a natural reaction of a host in his endeavor to please a
guest. While we did not admire it, we could understand it.</p>

<p>The siege of Sanara was almost a stalemate. The city had
enormous reserve supplies of synthetic foods; and its water supply
was assured by artesian wells, nor was there any dearth of
ammunition. The besiegers could not get into the city, and the
besieged could not get out. So matters stood one day a month after
my arrival in Sanara when Muso sent for me. He was pacing back and
forth the width of a small audience chamber when I was ushered into
his presence. He appeared nervous and ill at ease. I supposed at
the time that he was worried over the seeming hopelessness of
raising the siege, for it was of that he spoke first. Later he came
to the point.</p>

<p>"I have a commission for you, Captain," he said. "I want to get
a message through to one of my secret agents in Amlot. With your
ship you can easily cross the enemy lines and reach the vicinity of
Amlot without the slightest danger of being captured. I can direct
you to a spot where you can make contact with persons who can get
you into the city. After that it will be up to you. This must be a
secret expedition on your part&mdash;no one but you and I must know
of it, not even Taman, not even your wife. You will leave the first
thing in the morning ostensibly on a bombing expedition, and you
will not come back&mdash;at least not until you have fulfilled your
mission. After that there will be no need for secrecy. If you
succeed, I shall create you a noble&mdash;specifically an
ongvoo&mdash;and when the war is over and peace restored I shall
see that you receive lands and a palace."</p>

<p>Now, the title ongvoo means, literally, exalted one and is
hereditary in the collateral branches of the royal family, though
occasionally conferred on members of the nobility for highly
meritorious service to the jong. It seemed to me at the time that
the service I was commissioned to perform did not merit any such
reward, but I gave the matter little thought. It would have been
better had I done so.</p>

<p>Muso stepped to a desk and took two thin leather containers,
like envelopes, from a drawer. "These contain the messages you are
to deliver," he said. "Taman tells me that as you are from another
world you probably do not read Amtorian; so you will write in your
own language on the outside of each the names and location of those
to whom you are to deliver these." He handed me a pen and one of
the containers. "This one you will deliver to Lodas at his farm
five klookob northwest of Amlot. I shall give you a map with the
location marked on it. Lodas will see that you get into Amlot.
There you will deliver this other message to a man named Spehon
from whom you will receive further instructions."</p>

<p>From another drawer in the desk he took a map and spread it on
the table. "Here," he said, making a mark on the map a little
northwest of Amlot, "is a flat-topped hill that you will easily be
able to locate from the air. It rises between two streams that join
one another just southeast of it. In the fork of these two streams
lies the farm of Lodas. You will not divulge to Lodas the purpose
of your mission or the name of the man you are to meet in
Amlot."</p>

<p>"But how am I to find Spehon?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am coming to that. He is posing as a Zani, and stands high in
the councils of Mephis. His office is in the palace formerly
occupied by my uncle, Kord, the jong of Korva. You will have no
difficulty in locating him. Now, of course you can't be safe in
Amlot with that yellow hair of yours. It would arouse immediate
suspicion. With black hair you will be safe enough if you do not
talk too much, for, while they will know that you are not a member
of the Zani party, that will arouse no suspicion as not all of the
citizens of Amlot are members of the party, even though they may be
loyal to Mephis."</p>

<p>"How will they know that I'm not a member of the party?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Zanis distinguish themselves by a peculiar form of haircut," he
explained. "They shave their heads except for a ridge of hair about
two inches wide that runs from the forehead to the nape of the
neck. I think you understand your instructions, do you not?"</p>

<p>I told him that I did.</p>

<p>"Then here are the envelopes and the map; and here, also, is a
bottle of dye to color your hair after you leave Sanara."</p>

<p>"You have thought of everything," I said.</p>

<p>"I usually do," he remarked with a smile. "Now is there anything
you'd like to ask before you leave?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "I should like to ask your permission to tell my
wife that I shall be away for some time. I do not wish to cause her
unnecessary worry."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "That is impossible," he said. "No one must
know. There are spies everywhere. If I find that she is unduly
alarmed, I promise you that I shall reassure her. You will leave
early tomorrow morning. I wish you luck."</p>

<p>That seemed to close the audience; so I saluted and turned to
leave. Before I reached the door he spoke again. "You are sure you
cannot read Amtorian?" he asked.</p>

<p>I thought the question a little strange and his tone a little
too eager. Perhaps it was this, I don't know what else it could
have been, that impelled me to reply as I did.</p>

<p>"If that is necessary," I said, "perhaps you had better send
some one else. I could fly him to Lodas's farm and bring him back
when his mission is completed."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he hastened to assure me. "It will not be necessary
for you to read Amtorian." Then he dismissed me. Of course, having
studied under Danus in the palace of the jong of Vepaja, I could
read Amtorian quite as well as Muso himself.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
All that evening I felt like a traitor to Duare; but I had sworn
allegiance to Muso, and while I served him I must obey his orders.
The next morning, as I kissed her goodby, I suddenly had a
premonition that it might be for the last time. I held her close,
dreading to leave her; and she must have sensed in the tenseness of
my body that something was amiss.</p>

<p>She looked up at me questioningly. "There is something wrong,
Carson," she said. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"It is just that this morning I hate to leave you even more than
usual." Then I kissed her and left.</p>

<p>Following a plan of my own to deceive the enemy as to my
possible destination, I flew east out over the ocean, turning north
when I had passed beyond the range of their vision; then I circled
to the west far north of their camp and finally came to the ocean
again west of Amlot. Flying back parallel with the coast and a few
miles inland I had no difficulty in locating the flat-topped hill
that was my principal landmark. During the flight I had dyed my
hair black and removed the insignia of my office and service from
the scant trappings that, with my loincloth, constituted my
apparel. Now I could pass as an ordinary citizen of Amlot,
providing no one noticed the color of my eyes.</p>

<p>I easily located the farm of Lodas in the fork of the rivers,
and circled low looking for a suitable landing place. As I did so,
a number of men working in the fields dropped their tools and ran
toward the house, from which several other persons came to observe
the ship. Evidently we aroused much excitement, and when I finally
landed several men came cautiously toward me with weapons ready for
any eventuality. I climbed down from the cockpit and advanced to
meet them, holding my hands above my head to assure them that my
intentions were friendly. When we were within speaking distance, I
hailed them.</p>

<p>"Which of you is Lodas?" I asked.</p>

<p>They all halted and looked at one big fellow who was in the
lead.</p>

<p>"I am Lodas," he replied. "Who are you? and what do you want of
Lodas?"</p>

<p>"I have a message for you," I said, holding out the leather
envelope.</p>

<p>He came forward rather hesitantly and took it from me. The
others waited while he opened and read it.</p>

<p>"All right," he said finally, "come to the house with me."</p>

<p>"First I'd like to make my ship fast in a safe place," I told
him. "Where would you suggest? It should be protected from the wind
and be somewhere where it can be watched at all times."</p>

<p>He looked at it rather dubiously for a moment; then he shook his
head. "I haven't a building large enough to hold it," he said, "but
you can put it between those two buildings over there. It will be
protected from the wind there."</p>

<p>I looked in the direction he indicated and saw two large
buildings, probably barns, and saw that they would answer as well
as anything he had to offer; so I taxied the ship between them, and
with the help of Lodas and his fellows fastened it down
securely.</p>

<p>"Let no one ever touch it or go near it," I cautioned Lodas.</p>

<p>"I think no one will wish to go near it," he said feelingly.</p>

<p>It must have looked like some monster from another world to
those simple Amtorian rustics.</p>

<p>The ship tied down, the hands returned to the fields; and Lodas
led me to the house, two women who had run out to enjoy the
excitement accompanying us. The house, a long narrow building
running east and west, had a verandah extending its full length on
the south side and was windowless on the north, the side from which
the prevailing warm winds came and the occasional hot blasts from
the equatorial regions. Lodas led me into a large central room that
was a combination living room, dining room, and kitchen. In
addition to a huge fireplace there was a large clay oven, the
former necessitated during the winter months when the colder winds
came from the antarctic.</p>

<p>At the door of the room Lodas sent the women away, saying that
he wished to speak with me alone. He seemed nervous and fearful;
and when we were alone he drew me to a bench in a far corner of the
room and sat close to me, whispering in my ear.</p>

<p>"This is bad business," he said. "There are spies everywhere.
Perhaps some of the men working for me were sent by Mephis. He has
spies spying upon everyone and spies spying upon spies. Already
rumors have come from Amlot of a strange thing that flies through
the air dropping death and fire upon the forces of Mephis. At once
my workers will know that it is this thing that you came in. They
will be suspicious; they will talk; if there is a spy among them he
will get word to Mephis, and that will be the end of me. What am I
to do?"</p>

<p>"What did the message tell you to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It told me to get you into Amlot; that was all."</p>

<p>"Are you going to do it?"</p>

<p>"I would do anything for Kord, my jong," he said simply. "Yes, I
shall do it; but I shall probably die for it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can work out a plan," I suggested. "If there is a
spy here or if your men talk too much, it will be as bad for me as
for you. Is there any place near here where I could hide my
ship&mdash;some place that it would be reasonably safe?"</p>

<p>"If Mephis hears of it, it will not be safe here," said Lodas,
and I appreciated the truth of his statement. He thought for a
moment; then he shook his head. "The only place that I can think of
is an island off the coast just south of us."</p>

<p>"What sort of an island?" I asked. "Any clear, level land on
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it is a very flat island. It is covered with grass. No
one lives there. It is seldom that anyone goes there&mdash;never
since the revolution."</p>

<p>"How far off shore is it?"</p>

<p>"It lies very close. I row to it in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"You row to it? You have a boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, once a year we row over to pick the berries that grow
there. The women make jam of them that lasts all the rest of the
year."</p>

<p>"Fine!" I exclaimed. "Now I have a plan that will remove all
suspicion from you. Listen." For ten minutes I talked, explaining
every detail of my scheme. Occasionally Lodas slapped his knee and
laughed. He was hugely pleased and relieved. Lodas was a big,
simple, good natured fellow. One couldn't help but like and trust
him. I didn't want to get him in any trouble, on his own account;
and, too, I knew that any trouble I got him into I would have to
share.</p>

<p>We decided to put my plan into execution immediately; so we left
the house; and as we passed the women, Lodas spoke to me
angrily.</p>

<p>"Get off my farm!" he cried. "I'll have nothing to do with
you."</p>

<p>We went at once to the ship and cast off the ropes; then I
taxied it out toward the field where I had landed. Lodas followed
on foot, and when we were within earshot of some of the men, he
shouted at me loudly. "Get out of here! I'll have nothing to do
with you. Don't ever let me see you on my farm again." The farm
hands looked on in wide-eyed amazement, that grew wider eyed as I
took off.</p>

<p>As I had done when I took off from Sanara I flew in a direction
opposite that I intended going; and when I was out of sight circled
back toward the ocean. I found the island Lodas had described and
landed easily. Some high bushes grew on the windward side, and
behind these I made the ship fast. I worked on it until dark, and
had it so securely fastened down that I didn't believe that
anything short of a hurricane could blow it away.</p>

<p>I had brought a little food with me from Sanara; and, after
eating, I crawled into the cabin and settled myself for the night.
It was very lonely out there with only the wind soughing through
the bushes and the surf pounding on the shore of that unknown sea.
But I slept and dreamed of Duare. I knew that she must be worrying
about me already, and I felt like a dog to have treated her so. I
hoped that Muso would soon tell her that I had but gone on a
mission for him. At the worst, I hoped to be home by the second
day.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
I awoke early and crossed the island to the shoreward side; and
about half an hour later I saw a huge gantor approaching, drawing a
wagon behind him. As he came nearer I recognized Lodas perched upon
the animal's back. I waved to him, and he waved back. Leaving his
conveyance near the shore, Lodas climbed down to a little cove, and
presently I saw him pushing a crude boat into the water. Soon I was
in it with him, and he was rowing back to the mainland.</p>

<p>"How did our little scheme work?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Oh, fine," he said, with a broad grin. "I wouldn't tell them
what you wanted me to do, but I told them that it was something
wrong and that I was going to Amlot to tell the authorities about
it. That satisfied them all; so if there was a spy among them I
don't think he will give us any trouble. You are a very smart man
to have thought of this plan."</p>

<p>Once in the cove, we pulled the boat up onto a little ledge and
climbed up to the waiting conveyance, a four wheeled, boxlike cart
loaded with hay and vegetables. Lodas forked some of the hay to one
side and told me to lie down in the depression he had made; then he
forked the hay back on top of me.</p>

<p>It was about ten miles to Amlot, and of all the uncomfortable
ten miles I ever rode those took first prize. The hay was soft
enough to lie on; but the seeds got in my ears and nose and mouth
and under my harness and loincloth, and I almost suffocated beneath
the pile of hay on top of me. The motion of the cart was eccentric,
to say the least. It pitched and wobbled and bumped over a road
that must have been new when longevity serum was invented, but
never had a shot of it. The gait of the gantor was much faster than
I had anticipated. He evidently had a long, swinging walk; and we
must have made at least six miles an hour, which is somewhere
between the speed of a horse's walk and trot.</p>

<p>But at last we got to Amlot. I knew that, when we came to a stop
and I heard men's voices questioning Lodas. Finally I heard one
say, "Oh, I know this farmer. He brings stuff into the city often.
He's all right." They let us go on then, and I could tell by the
sound of the wheels that we were rolling over a pavement. I was
inside the walls of Amlot! I hoped the remainder of my mission
would prove as readily fulfilled as this first part of it, and
there was no reason to believe that it would not. If it did, I
should be back with Duare by the following day.</p>

<p>We must have driven a considerable distance into the city before
we stopped again. There was a short wait during which I heard
voices; but they were low, and I could not overhear what was being
said; then there was a creaking sound as of the hinges of a heavy
gate, and immediately we moved forward a short distance and stopped
again. Once more the hinges groaned, and then I heard Lodas's voice
telling me to come out. I didn't need a second invitation. Throwing
the hay aside, I stood up. We were in the courtyard of a one story
house. A man was standing with Lodas looking up at me. He didn't
seem very glad to see me.</p>

<p>"This is my brother, Horjan," said Lodas, "and, Horjan, this
is&mdash;say, what is your name my friend?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it in the message I brought?" I asked, pretending
surprise.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't."</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be as well, I thought, if I didn't publicize my
true name too widely. "Where I come from," I said, "I would be
called Homo Sapiens. Call me Homo;" so Homo I became.</p>

<p>"This is bad business," said Horjan. "If we are found out, the
Zani Guard will come and take us off to prison; and there we shall
be tortured and killed. No, I do not like it."</p>

<p>"But it is for the jong," said Lodas, as though that were ample
reason for any sacrifice.</p>

<p>"What did the jong ever do for us?" demanded Horjan.</p>

<p>"He is our jong," said Lodas simply. "Horjan, I am ashamed of
you."</p>

<p>"Well, let it pass. I will keep him this night, but tomorrow he
must go on about his business. Come into the house now where I can
hide you. I do not like it. I do not like it at all. I am afraid.
The Zani Guard do terrible things to one whom they suspect."</p>

<p>And so I went into the house of Horjan in Amlot, a most
unwelcome guest. I sympathized with the two brothers, but I could
do nothing about it. I was merely obeying the orders of Muso.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">VII. &mdash; ZERKA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">HORJAN gave me a little room on the court and told
me to stay there so that no one would see me; then he and Lodas
left me. It was not long before Lodas returned to say that he was
going to take his produce to market and then start home. He wanted
to say goodby to me and wish me luck. He was a fine, loyal
fellow.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The hours dragged heavily in that stuffy little room. At dusk
Horjan brought me food and water. He tried to find out what I had
come to Amlot for, but I evaded all his questions. He kept
repeating that he would be glad to get rid of me, but at last he
went away. After I had eaten I tried to sleep, but sleep didn't
seem to want to come. I had just finally started to doze when I
heard voices. They came from the adjoining room, and the partition
was so thin that I could hear what was said. I recognized Horjan's
voice, and there was the voice of another man. It was not
Lodas.</p>

<p>"I tell you it is bad business," Horjan was saying. "Here is
this man about whom I know nothing. If it is known that he is
hiding here I shall get the blame, even though I don't know why he
is hiding."</p>

<p>"You are a fool to keep him," said the other.</p>

<p>"What shall I do with him?" demanded Horjan.</p>

<p>"Turn him over to the Zani Guard."</p>

<p>"But still they will say that I had been hiding him," groaned
Horjan.</p>

<p>"No; say that you don't know how he got into your
house&mdash;that you had been away, and when you came back you
found him hiding in one of your rooms. They will not harm you for
that. They may even give you a reward."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Horjan.</p>

<p>"Certainly. A man who lives next to me informed on a neighbor,
and they gave him a reward for that."</p>

<p>"Is that so? It is worth thinking about. He may be a dangerous
man. Maybe he has come to assassinate Mephis."</p>

<p>"You could say that that was what he came for," encouraged the
other.</p>

<p>"They would give a very big reward for that, wouldn't they?"
asked Horjan.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think a very big reward."</p>

<p>There was silence for several minutes; then I heard a bench
pushed back. "Where are you going?" demanded Horjan's visitor.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell the Zanis," said Horjan.</p>

<p>"I shall go with you," announced his companion. "Don't forget
that the idea is mine&mdash;I should have half the reward. Maybe
two-thirds of it."</p>

<p>"But he is my prisoner," insisted Horjan. "It is I who am going
to notify the Zani Guard. You stay here."</p>

<p>"I rather guess not. If I told them what I know, they would
arrest you both; and I'd get a great big reward."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't do that!" cried Horjan.</p>

<p>"Well, I certainly shall if you keep on trying to rob me of the
reward."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't rob you of it. I'll give you ten per cent."</p>

<p>The other laughed. "Ten per cent nothing. <i>I'll</i> give
<i>you</i> ten per cent&mdash;and that's much more than you
deserve&mdash;plotting against Mephis and Spehon and the rest of
them."</p>

<p>"You can't put that over on me," shouted Horjan. "Nobody'll
believe you anyhow. Everybody knows what a liar you are. Hey, where
are you going? Come back here! I'm the one that's going to tell
them."</p>

<p>I heard the sound of running feet, the slamming of a door, and
then silence. That was my cue to get out of there, and I can tell
you that I didn't waste any time acting on it. I didn't know how
far they'd have to go to find a member of the Zani Guard. There
might be one at the next corner for all that I knew. I found my way
out of the house in short order, and when I reached the avenue my
two worthy friends were still in sight, quarrelling as they ran. I
turned and melted into the shadows of the night that fell in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>There was no use running. I didn't even hurry, but sauntered
along as though I were an old resident of Amlot going to call on my
mother-in-law. The avenue I was in was dark and gloomy, but I could
see a better lighted one ahead; so I made for that. I passed a few
people, but no one paid any attention to me. Presently I found
myself in an avenue of small shops. They were all open and lighted,
and customers were coming and going. There were lots of soldiers on
the street, and here I caught my first sight of a member of the
Zani Guard.</p>

<p>There were three of them together, and they were swaggering down
the sidewalk elbowing men, women and children into the gutter. I
felt a little nervous as I approached them, but they paid no
attention to me.</p>

<p>I had been doing a great deal of thinking since I had overheard
the conversation between Horjan and his accomplice. I couldn't
forget that the latter had linked Spehon's name with that of
Mephis. The message that I carried in my pocket was addressed to
Spehon. What could Muso be communicating secretly with a leader of
the Zanis for? It didn't make sense, and it didn't sound good. It
worried me. Then I recalled the inexplicable secrecy of my
departure and the fact that Muso had warned me against telling
Lodas the name of the person I was bearing a message to. Why was he
afraid to have that known? and why had he been so relieved when he
assured himself that I could not read Amtorian? It was a puzzle
that was commencing to clear itself up in my mind, or at least I
was beginning to suspect something of the solution. Whether I were
right or not, I might never know; or I might learn it tomorrow.
That depended largely upon whether or not I delivered the message
to Spehon. I was almost minded to try to get out of the city and
back to my ship; then fly to Sanara and lay the whole matter before
Taman, whom I trusted. But my sometimes foolish sense of duty to a
trust imposed in me soon put that idea out of my head. No, I would
go on and carry out my orders&mdash;that was my duty as a
soldier.</p>

<p>As I proceeded along the avenue the shops took on a more
prosperous appearance, the trappings and jewels of the people on
the street became richer. Gorgeously trapped gantors carried their
loads of passengers to and fro or stopped before some shop while
master or mistress entered to make a purchase. Before one
brilliantly lighted building twenty or thirty huge gantors waited.
When I came opposite the building, I looked in. It was a
restaurant. The sight of the bright lights, the laughing people,
the good food attracted me. The meager meal that Horjan had brought
me had only served to whet my appetite. I entered the building, and
as I did so I saw that it was apparently filled to capacity. I
stood for a moment looking about for a vacant table, and was about
to turn and walk out when an attendant came up to me and asked me
if I wished to dine. I told him I did, and he led me to a small
table for two where a woman was already seated.</p>

<p>"Sit here," he said. It was a trifle embarrassing.</p>

<p>"But this table is occupied," I said.</p>

<p>"That is all right," said the woman. "You are welcome to sit
here."</p>

<p>There was really nothing else for me to do but thank her and
take the vacant chair. "This is very generous of you," I said.</p>

<p>"Not at all," she assured me.</p>

<p>"I had no idea, of course, that the attendant was bringing me to
someone else's table. It was very presumptuous of him."</p>

<p>She smiled. She had a very lovely smile. In fact she was a very
good looking woman; and, like all the civilized women of Amtor that
I had seen, apparently quite young. She might have been seventeen
or seven hundred years old. That is what the serum of longevity
does for them.</p>

<p>"It was not so presumptuous as it might seem," she said; "at
least not on the part of the attendant. I told him to fetch
you."</p>

<p>I must have looked my surprise. "Well, of course, that was very
nice of you," was the only banality I could think of at the
moment.</p>

<p>"You see," she continued, "I saw you looking for a table, there
was a vacant chair here, I was alone and lonely. You don't mind, do
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm delighted. You were not the only lonely person in Amlot.
Have you ordered?"</p>

<p>"No; the service here is execrable. They never have enough
attendants, but the food is the best in town. But of course you
have eaten here often&mdash;everyone eats here."</p>

<p>I didn't know just what position to take. Perhaps it would be
better to admit that I was a stranger rather than pretend I was not
and then reveal the fact by some egregious error that I would be
certain to make in conversation with any person familiar with Amlot
and the manners and customs of its people. I saw that she was
appraising me closely. Perhaps it would be more correct to say
inventorying me&mdash;my harness, my other apparel, my eyes. I
caught her quizzical gaze upon my eyes several times. I determined
to admit that I was a stranger when our attention was attracted to
a slight commotion across the room. A squad of Zani Guards was
questioning people at one of the tables. Their manner was officious
and threatening. They acted like a bunch of gangsters.</p>

<p>"What's all that about?" I asked my companion.</p>

<p>"You don't know?"</p>

<p>"It is one of the many things I don't know," I admitted.</p>

<p>"About Amlot," she concluded for me. "They are looking for
traitors and for Atorians. It goes on constantly in Amlot nowadays.
It is strange you have never noticed it. Here they come now."</p>

<p>Sure enough, they were heading straight across the room for our
table, and their leader seemed to have his eyes on me. I thought
then that he was looking for me in particular. Later I learned that
it is their custom to skip around a place, examining a few people
in each. It is more for the moral effect on the citizens than for
anything else. Of course they do make arrests, but that is largely
a matter of the caprice of the leader unless a culprit has been
pointed out by an informer.</p>

<p>The leader barged right up to me and stuck his face almost into
mine. "Who are you?" he demanded. "Give an account of
yourself."</p>

<p>"He is a friend of mine," said the woman across the table. "He
is all right, kordogan."</p>

<p>The man looked at her, and then he wilted. "Of course, Toganja,"
he cried apologetically; then he marched his men away and out of
the restaurant.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was very well for me, in addition to having your
company, that this was the only vacant chair in the restaurant;
although I really had nothing to fear. It is just disconcerting for
a stranger."</p>

<p>"Then I guessed correctly? You are a stranger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Toganja; I was about to explain when the kordogan pounced
on me."</p>

<p>"You have credentials though?"</p>

<p>"Credentials? Why, no."</p>

<p>"Then it is very well for you that I was here. You would
certainly have been on your way to prison now and probably shot
tomorrow&mdash;unless you have friends here."</p>

<p>"Only one," I said.</p>

<p>"And may I ask who that one is?"</p>

<p>"You." We both smiled.</p>

<p>"Tell me something about yourself," she said. "It doesn't seem
possible that there is such an innocent abroad in Amlot today."</p>

<p>"I just reached the city this afternoon," I explained. "You see,
I am a soldier of fortune. I heard there was fighting here, and I
came looking for a commission."</p>

<p>"On which side?" she asked.</p>

<p>I shrugged. "I know nothing about either side," I said.</p>

<p>"How did you get into the city without being arrested?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"A company of soldiers, some workers, and a few farmers were
coming through the gate. I just walked through with them. Nobody
stopped me; nobody asked me any questions. Did I do wrong?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Not if you could get away with it. Nothing
is wrong that you can get away with. The crime is in getting
caught. Tell me where you are from, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Why should I mind? I have nothing to conceal. I am from
Vodaro." I remembered having seen a land mass called Vodaro on one
of Danus's maps. It extended from the southern edge of the south
temperate zone into the terra incognita of the antarctic. Danus
said that little was known of it. I hoped that nothing was known of
it. Nothing less than I knew of it could be known.</p>

<p>She nodded. "I was sure you were from some far country," she
said. "You are very different from the men of Korva. Do all your
people have grey eyes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed," I assured her. "All Vodaroans have grey eyes,
or nearly all." It occurred to me that she might meet a Vodaroan
some day who had black eyes. If she got to inquiring around right
in this restaurant she might find one. I didn't know, and I wasn't
taking any chances. She seemed to be quite an alert person who
liked to seek after knowledge.</p>

<p>An attendant finally condescended to come and take our order,
and after the dinner arrived I found that it was well worth waiting
for. During the meal she explained many things about conditions in
Amlot under the rule of the Zanis, but so adroit was she that I
couldn't tell whether she was a <i>phile</i> or a <i>phobe</i>.
While we were in the midst of dinner another detachment of the Zani
Guard entered. They went directly to a table next to us where a
citizen who accompanied them pointed out one of the diners.</p>

<p>"That is he," he cried accusingly. "His great-grandmother was
nursed by an Atorian woman."</p>

<p>The accused rose and paled. "Mistal!" cried the kordogan in
charge of the detachment, and struck the accused man heavily in the
face, knocking him down; then the others jumped on him and kicked
and beat him. Finally they dragged him away, more dead than alive.
(A <i>mistal</i> is a rodent about the size of a cat. The word is
often used as a term of opprobrium, as one might say "Pig!").</p>

<p>"Now what was all that about?" I asked my companion. "Why should
a man be beaten to death because his great-grandmother nursed at
the breast of an Atorian woman?"</p>

<p>"The milk and therefore the blood of an Atorian entered the
veins of an ancestor, thereby contaminating the pure blood of the
super race of Korva," she explained.</p>

<p>"But what is wrong with the blood of an Atorian?" I asked. "Are
Atorians diseased?"</p>

<p>"It is really rather difficult to explain," she said. "If I were
you I should just accept it as fact while in Amlot&mdash;and not
discuss it."</p>

<p>I realized that that was excellent advice. From what I had seen
in Amlot I was convinced that the less one discussed anything the
better off he would be and the longer he would live.</p>

<p>"You haven't told me your name," said the Toganja; "mine is
Zerka."</p>

<p>I couldn't safely give her my own name, and I didn't dare use
Homo any longer because I was sure I had been reported by Horjan
and his good friend; so I had to think of another name quickly.</p>

<p>"Vodo," I said quickly, thinking that Vodo of Vodaro sounded
almost colossal.</p>

<p>"And in your own country you must be a very important man," she
said. I could see she was trying to pump me, and I saw no use in
saying I was a street car conductor or an author or anything like
that. They wouldn't sound important enough; and, anyway, as long as
I was launched on a career of deception I might as well make a good
job of it.</p>

<p>"I am the Tanjong of Vodaro," I told her, "but please don't tell
anyone. I'm travelling incognito." A tanjong is the son of a ruling
jong&mdash;a prince.</p>

<p>"But how in the world did your government ever permit you to
travel alone like this? Why, you might be killed."</p>

<p>"From what I have seen of Amlot I can readily agree with you," I
said, laughing. "As a matter of fact, I ran away. I got tired of
all the pomp and ceremony of the court. I wanted to live my life as
a man."</p>

<p>"That is very interesting," she said. "If you want to take
service here, perhaps I can help you. I am not without influence.
Come and see me tomorrow. The driver of any public gantor knows
where my palace is. Now I must be going. This has been quite an
adventure. You have kept me from utter boredom."</p>

<p>I noticed that she said utter.</p>

<p>I walked to the door with her, where two warriors saluted her
and followed us to the curb, one of them summoning the driver of a
gantor&mdash;her private conveyance.</p>

<p>"Where do you stop?" she asked me, as she waited for her
gantor.</p>

<p>"I haven't stopped yet," I told her. "You know I am a stranger
here. Can you suggest a good place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, come with me; I'll take you there."</p>

<p>The ornate howdah on the broad back of her gantor seated four in
the front compartment&mdash;two and two, facing one another; behind
this was another seat where the two armed guards rode.</p>

<p>As the great beast strode majestically along the avenue, I
watched with interest the night life of this Amtorian city.
Previously I had been in Kooaad, the tree city of Vepaja, in the
Thorist city of Kapdor, in Kormor, the city of the dead, and in
lovely Havatoo. The latter and this city of Amlot were, of all of
them, the only cities in the true sense of the word; and while
Amlot could not compare with Havatoo, it was yet a city of life and
activity. Though the hour was late, this main avenue was thronged
with people; lines of gaily caparisoned gantors moved in both
directions carrying their loads of passengers gay and laughing,
grave and serious. Everywhere the Zani Guardsmen were in evidence,
their strange headdress distinguishing them from all others&mdash;a
two-inch ridge of hair from forehead to nape. Their apparel was
distinctive too, because of its ornateness. Shops and restaurants,
gambling houses and theaters, brilliantly lighted, lined the
avenue. Amlot did not seem like a city at war. I mentioned this to
Zerka.</p>

<p>"It is our way of keeping up the morale of the people," she
explained. "As a matter of fact, the last war, which brought on the
revolution, left us disillusioned, bitter, and impoverished. We
were compelled to give up our entire navy and merchant marine.
There was little life and less laughter on the avenues of Amlot;
then, by decree of Kord, the jong, every public place was required
to reopen and the people, in some instances, actually driven into
the streets to patronize them. The effect was electrical, and after
the revolution the Zanis encouraged the practice. It has been most
helpful in maintaining the spirit of the people. Well, here we are
at the travellers' house. Come and see me tomorrow."</p>

<p>I thanked her for her courtesy to me and for the pleasant
evening she had given me. The driver had placed the ladder against
the gantor's side, and I was about to descend, when she laid a hand
on my arm. "If you are questioned," she said, "tell them what you
told me; and if they do not believe you, or you get in any trouble,
refer them to me. Tell them I have given you permission to do so.
Here, take this and wear it," and she slipped a ring from one of
her fingers and handed it to me; "it will substantiate your claim
to my friendship. And now, one other thing. I would not mention
again that you are a tanjong. Royalty is not so popular in Amlot as
it once was; why, is immaterial. A very great jong came here
recently in search of an only daughter who had been kidnaped. He is
still imprisoned in the Gap kum Rov&mdash;if he is yet alive."</p>

<p>A very great jong whose only daughter had been kidnaped! Could
it be possible?</p>

<p>"What great jong is that?" I asked.</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed a little as she replied, "It is not well to be
too inquisitive in Amlot during these times."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I said; then I descended to the sidewalk, and her
great gantor moved off down the avenue.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; MUSO'S MESSAGE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE travellers' house, or hotel, to which Zerka
had brought me was really quite magnificent, indicating that Amlot
had been a city of considerable wealth and importance in this part
of Amtor. The lobby served the same purpose that a lobby in an
Earthly hotel does. The desk was a large, circular booth in the
center. There were benches, chairs, divans, flowers; small shops
opened from it. I felt almost at home. The lobby was crowded. The
ubiquitous Zani Guard was well represented. As I stepped to the
desk, two of them followed me and listened while the clerk
questioned me, asking my name and address.</p>

<p>"Where are your credentials?" barked one of the Zanis.</p>

<p>"I have none," I replied. "I am a stranger from Vodaro, seeking
military service here."</p>

<p>"What! No credentials, you mistal? You are probably a dog of a
spy from Sanara." He bellowed so loud that the attention of
everyone in the lobby was attracted, and all about us there fell a
silence that seemed to me the silence of terror. "This is what you
need," he yelled, and struck at me. I am afraid I lost my temper,
and I know I did a very foolish thing. I parried his blow and
struck him heavily in the face&mdash;so heavily that he sprawled
backward upon the floor fully ten feet from me; then his companion
came for me with drawn sword.</p>

<p>"You had better be sure what you are doing," I said, and held
out the ring Zerka had given me so that he could see it.</p>

<p>He took one look at it and dropped the point of his weapon. "Why
didn't you say so?" he asked, and his tone was very different from
what that of his fellow had been. By this time the latter had
staggered to his feet and was trying to draw his sword. He was
quite groggy.</p>

<p>"Wait," his companion cautioned him, and went and whispered in
his ear, whereupon they both turned and left the lobby like a
couple of whipped dogs. After that the clerk was the
personification of courtesy. He inquired about my luggage, which I
told him would arrive later; then he called a strapping porter who
had a chairlike contraption strapped to his back. The fellow came
and knelt before me and I took my seat in the chair, for it was
obvious that that was what was expected of me; then he stood up,
took a key from the clerk and ran up three flights of stairs with
me&mdash;a human elevator, and the only sort of elevator known to
Amlot. The fellow was a veritable composite of Hercules and
Mercury. I tried to tip him after he had set me down in my room,
but he couldn't understand my good intentions. He thought I was
trying to bribe him to do something that he shouldn't do. I am sure
he reported me as a suspicious character after he returned to the
desk.</p>

<p>My room was large and well furnished; a bath opened from it. A
balcony in front overlooked the city out to the ocean, and I went
out there and stood for a long time thinking over all that had
occurred to me, but mostly thinking of Duare. I also thought much
on my strange encounter with the Toganja Zerka. I couldn't quite
convince myself that her interest in me was wholly friendly, yet I
really had no reason to doubt it; except, perhaps, that she seemed
a woman of mystery. It is possible that I doubted her sincerity
because of my own deceitfulness; yet what else could I have done? I
was in an enemy city, where, if the truth about me were even
suspected, I should have received short shrift. As I could not tell
the truth, I had to lie; and while I was lying, I might as well
make a good job of it, I reasoned. I was sure that I had completely
deceived her. Had she also deceived me? I knew the city was full of
spies. What better way to entice a stranger into unwary admissions
than through a beautiful woman&mdash;it is as old as espionage
itself.</p>

<p>The possibility that Duare's father, Mintep, might be a prisoner
here gave me the most concern and resolved me to remain until I had
definitely established the truth or falsity of my suspicions. The
reference to Spehon, made by Horjan's companion, that linked
closely with the leader of Zanism the name of the man to whom I
bore a message from Muso was also good for considerable conjecture.
I was frankly apprehensive that all was not as it should be. There
was a way to discover, perhaps. I took the leather envelope
containing Muso's message from my pocket pouch, broke the seals,
and opened it. This is what I read:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Muso, the Jong,</p>

<p class="letter">Addresses Spehon at Amlot.</p>

<p class="letter">May success attend your ventures and old age
never overtake you.</p>

<p class="letter">Muso dispatches this message to Spehon by Carson
of Venus, who cannot read Amtorian.</p>

<p class="letter">If Sanara were to fall into the hands of Mephis,
this unfortunate civil war would be ended.</p>

<p class="letter">That would be well if Muso were to be jong of
Korva after the fall of Sanara.</p>

<p class="letter">If Mephis wishes all this to happen, let three
blue rockets be shot into the air before the main gate of Sanara on
three successive nights.</p>

<p class="letter">On the fourth night let a strong force approach
the main gate secretly, with stronger reserves held nearby; then
Muso will cause the main gates to be thrown open for the purpose of
permitting a sortie. But there will be no sortie. The troops of
Mephis may then enter the city in force. Muso will surrender, and
the bloodshed may cease.</p>

<p class="letter">Muso will make a good jong, conferring always
with Mephis.</p>

<p class="letter">The Zanis shall be rewarded.</p>

<p class="letter">It would be regrettable, but best, if Carson of
Venus were destroyed in Amlot.</p>

<p class="letter">May success be yours.</p>

<p class="letter" style="margin-left:70%"><span class=
"smcap">Muso<br>
Jong.</span>
</p>

<p><br>
I turned a little cold at the thought of how near I had been to
delivering that message without reading it. I hadn't realized that
I had been carrying my death warrant around on me as innocently as
a babe in the woods. I looked around for some means of destroying
it, and found a fireplace in one corner of the room. That would
answer the purpose nicely. I walked to it, carrying the document;
and, taking my little pocket fire-maker from my pouch, was about to
set fire to it when something caused me to hesitate. Here was a
valuable document&mdash;a document that might mean much to Taman
and to Korva if it were properly utilized. I felt that it should
not be destroyed, yet I didn't like the idea of carrying it around
with me. If I could but find a hiding place! But where? No place in
this room would answer if I were even slightly under suspicion, and
I knew that I already was. I was positive that the moment I left
the room it would be thoroughly searched. I put the message back in
its leather container and went to bed. Tomorrow I would have to
solve this problem; tonight I was too tired.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
I slept very soundly. I doubt that I moved all night. I awoke about
the 2nd hour, which would be about 6:40 A.M. Earth time. The
Amtorian day is 26 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds of Earth time. Here
it is divided into thirty-six hours of forty minutes each, the
hours being numbered from 1 to 36. The 1st hour corresponds roughly
with mean sunrise, and is about 6 A.M. Earth time. As I rolled over
and stretched for a moment before arising, I felt quite content
with myself. I was to call on Zerka this very morning with the
possibility of obtaining service of some nature with the Zanis that
might make it possible for me to ascertain if Mintep were really in
Amlot. I had read Muso's message to Spehon; so that that was no
longer a menace to me. My only real problem now was to find a
suitable hiding place for it, but I have so much confidence in
myself that I did not apprehend any great difficulty in doing
so.</p>

<p>Stepping out of bed, I walked to the balcony for a breath of
fresh air and a look at the city by daylight. I saw that the
travellers' house stood much closer to the waterfront than I had
imagined. There was a beautiful landlocked harbor lying almost at
my feet. Innumerable small boats lay at anchor or were moored to
quays. They were all that the enemy had left to the conquered
nation.</p>

<p>A new day was before me. What would it bring forth? Well, I
would bathe, dress, have breakfast, and see. As I crossed to the
bath, I saw my apparel lying in disorder on the floor. I knew that
I had not left it thus, and immediately I became apprehensive. My
first thought, naturally, was of the message; and so the first
thing that I examined was my pocket pouch. The message was gone! I
went to the door. It was still locked as I had left it the night
before. I immediately thought of the two Zani Guardsmen with whom I
had had an altercation in the lobby. They would have their revenge
now. I wondered when I would be arrested. Well, the worst they
could do would be to take me before Spehon, unless he had already
issued orders for my destruction. If I were not immediately
arrested, I must try to escape from the city. I could not serve
Mintep now by remaining. My only hope was to reach Sanara and warn
Taman.</p>

<p>I performed my toilette rather perfunctorily and without
interest; then I descended to the lobby. It was almost empty. The
clerk on duty spoke to me quite civilly, for a hotel clerk. No one
else paid any attention to me as I found the dining room and
ordered my breakfast.</p>

<p>I had made up my mind that I was going to see Zerka. Maybe she
could and would help me to escape from the city. I would give her a
good reason for my wishing to do so. After finishing my breakfast,
I returned to the lobby. The place was taking on an air of greater
activity. Several members of the Zani Guard were loitering near the
desk. I determined to bluff the whole thing through; so I walked
boldly toward them and made some inquiry at the desk. As I turned
away, I saw two more of the guardsmen enter the lobby from the
avenue. They were coming directly toward me, and I at once
recognized them as the two with whom I had had the encounter the
preceding night. This, I thought, is the end. As they neared me
both of them recognized me; but they passed on by me, and as they
did so, both saluted me. After that I went out into the street and
window shopped to kill time; then about the 8th hour (10:40 A.M.
E.T.) I found a public gantor and directed the driver to take me to
the palace of Toganja Zerka. A moment later I was in the cab of my
amazing taxi and lumbering along a broad avenue that paralleled the
ocean.</p>

<p>Shortly after we left the business portion of the city we
commenced to pass magnificent private palaces set in beautiful
grounds. Finally we stopped in front of a massive gate set in a
wall that surrounded the grounds of one of these splendid
residences. My driver shouted, and a warrior opened a small gate
and came out. He looked up at me questioningly.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have come at the invitation of the Toganja Zerka," I
said.</p>

<p>"What is your name, please?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Vodo," I replied; I almost said Homo.</p>

<p>"The Toganja is expecting you," said the warrior as he threw
open the gates.</p>

<p>The palace was a beautiful structure of white marble, or what
looked like white marble to me. It was built on three sides of a
large and beautiful garden, the fourth side being open to the
ocean, down to the shore of which the flowers, shrubbery, and lawn
ran. But just then I was not so much interested in scenic beauty as
I was in saving my neck.</p>

<p>After a short wait, I was ushered into the presence of Zerka.
Her reception room was almost a throne room, and she was sitting in
a large chair on a raised dais which certainly carried the
suggestion of sovereignty. She greeted me cordially and invited me
to sit on cushions at her feet.</p>

<p>"You look quite rested this morning," she observed. "I hope you
had a good night."</p>

<p>"Very," I assured her.</p>

<p>"Any adventure after I left you? You got along all right in the
hotel?"</p>

<p>I had a feeling she was pumping me. I don't know why I should
have, unless it was my guilty conscience; but I did.</p>

<p>"Well, I had a little altercation with a couple of the Zani
Guardsmen," I admitted; "and I lost my temper and knocked one of
them down&mdash;very foolishly."</p>

<p>"Yes, that was foolish. Don't do such a thing again, no matter
what the provocation. How did you get out of it?"</p>

<p>"I showed your ring. After that they left me alone. I saw them
again this morning, and they saluted me."</p>

<p>"And that was all that happened to you?" she persisted.</p>

<p>"All of any consequence."</p>

<p>She looked at me for a long minute without speaking. She seemed
either to be weighing something in her mind or trying to fathom my
thoughts. Finally she spoke again. "I have sent for a man to whom I
am going to entrust your future. You may trust him implicitly. Do
you understand?&mdash;implicitly!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said. "I don't know why you are doing these
things for me, but I want you to know that I appreciate your
kindness to a friendless stranger and that if I can serve you at
any time&mdash;well, you know you have only to command me."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is nothing," she assured me. "You saved me from a very
bad evening with myself, and I am really doing very little in
return."</p>

<p>Just then a servant opened the door and announced: "Maltu
Mephis! Mantar!"</p>

<p>A tall man in the trappings and with the headdress of a Zani
Guardsman entered the room. He came to the foot of the dais,
saluted and said, "Maltu Mephis!"</p>

<p>"Maltu Mephis!" replied Zerka. "I am glad to see you, Mantar.
This is Vodo," and to me, "This is Mantar."</p>

<p>"Maltu Mephis! I am glad to know you, Vodo," said Mantar.</p>

<p>"And I am glad to know you, Mantar," I replied.</p>

<p>A questioning frown clouded Mantar's brow, and he glanced at
Zerka. She smiled.</p>

<p>"Vodo is an utter stranger here," she said. "He does not yet
understand our customs. It is you who will have to inform him."</p>

<p>Mantar looked relieved. "I shall start at once," he said. "You
will forgive me, then, Vodo, if I correct you often?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I shall probably need it."</p>

<p>"To begin with, it is obligatory upon all loyal citizens to
preface every greeting and introduction with the words Maltu
Mephis. Please, never omit them. Never criticize the government or
any official or any member of the Zani Party. Never fail to salute
and cry Maltu Mephis whenever you see and hear others doing it. In
fact, it will be well if you always do what you see everyone else
doing, even though you may not understand."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly follow your advice," I told him; but what my
mental reservations might be I wisely kept to myself, as he
probably did also.</p>

<p>"Now, Mantar," said Zerka, "this ambitious young man is from far
Vodaro, and he wishes to take service as a soldier of Amlot. Will
you see what you can do for him? And now you must both be going, as
I have many things to attend to. I shall expect you to call and
report to me occasionally, Vodo."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9" name="ch9">IX. &mdash; I BECOME A ZANI</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MANTAR took me immediately to the palace formerly
occupied by the Jong, Kord, and now by Mephis and his lieutenants.
"We shall go directly to Spehon," he said. "No use wasting time on
underlings."</p>

<p>To Spehon! To the man whom Muso had advised to destroy me! I
felt positive that the message must already be in his hands, as it
must have been stolen by Zani spies who would have delivered it to
him immediately, was going to my doom.</p>

<p>"Why do we go to Spehon?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because he is head of the Zani Guard, which also includes our
secret police. Zerka suggested that I find you a berth in the
Guard. You are fortunate indeed to have such a friend as The
Toganja Zerka; otherwise, if you had been given service at all, it
would have been at the front, which is not so good since Muso
enlisted the services of this fellow called Carson of Venus with
his diabolical contrivance that flies through the air and rains
bombs on everyone."</p>

<p>"Flies through the air?" I asked, in simulated surprise. "Is
there really such a thing? What can it be?"</p>

<p>"We really don't know much about it," Mantar admitted. "Of
course everyone at the front has seen it, and we learned a little
from some prisoners we took who were members of a Sanaran party
making a sortie against our first line. They told us the name of
the fellow who flies it and what little they knew of him and of the
thing he calls an anotar, but that really was not much. Yes, you
will be fortunate if you get into the Guard. If you are an officer,
it is something of a sinecure; but you'll have to watch your step.
You must hate everything we Zanis hate and applaud everything that
we applaud, and under no circumstances must you ever even look
critical of anything that is Zani. To demonstrate what I mean: We
were listening to a speech by Our Beloved Mephis one evening, when
a bright light shining in his eyes unexpectedly caused one of my
fellow officers to knit his brows and half close his eyes in what
appeared to be a frown of disapproval. He was taken out and
shot."</p>

<p>"I shall be very careful," I assured him, and you may believe me
that I meant it.</p>

<p>The palace of the former jong was, indeed, a magnificent
structure; but I'm afraid I didn't fully appreciate it as I walked
through its corridors toward the office of Spehon&mdash;my mind was
on other things. We arrived at last at a waiting room just outside
the office of the great man, and there we waited for about half an
hour before we were summoned into the presence. Men were coming and
going to and from the waiting room in a constant stream. It was a
very busy place. Most of them wore the Zani uniform and sported the
Zani coiffure, and as they came and went the air was filled with
"Maltu Mephises" and Zani salutes.</p>

<p>At last we were ushered into the presence of Spehon. Like nearly
all civilized Amtorians, he was a handsome man; but his mouth was a
shade too cruel and his eyes a little too shifty for perfection.
Mantar and I each said "Maltu Mephis" and saluted; Spehon said
"Maltu Mephis! Greetings, Mantar. What brings you here?" He barked
the words like a human terrier.</p>

<p>"Maltu Mephis! This is Vodo," announced Mantar. "I bring him to
you at the suggestion of the Toganja Zerka, his good friend. She
recommends him for a commission in the Guard."</p>

<p>"But he is not even a Zani," expostulated Spehon.</p>

<p>"He is not even from Anlap," said Mantar, "but he wishes to be a
Zani and serve Our Beloved Mephis."</p>

<p>"From what country do you come?" demanded Spehon.</p>

<p>"From Vodaro," I replied.</p>

<p>"Have you any Atorian blood in your veins?"</p>

<p>"Had I, I should have been killed in Vodaro," I cried.</p>

<p>"And why?" he asked.</p>

<p>"And why, may I ask, Spehon, do <i>you</i> kill Atorians?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>"Naturally, because they have large ears," he replied. "We must
keep the blood of Korvans pure."</p>

<p>"You have answered your own question, Spehon," I told him. "We
Vodaroans are very proud of our pure blood; so we, too, kill the
Atorians because they have large ears."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" he exclaimed. "Will you swear to love, honor, and
obey Our Beloved Mephis, give your life for him, if necessary, and
hold him and the Zani Party above all else?"</p>

<p>"I swear!" I said, but I had my fingers crossed; then we all
saluted and said, "Maltu Mephis!"</p>

<p>"You are now a Zani," he announced. He saluted me, and said,
"Maltu Mephis!"</p>

<p>"Maltu Mephis!" I said, and saluted him.</p>

<p>"I appoint you a tokordogan," said Spehon, saluting, "Maltu
Mephis!"</p>

<p>"Maltu Mephis!" I replied, and saluted. A tokordogan is somewhat
similar to a lieutenant. A kordogan is comparable to a sergeant and
as the prefix <i>to</i> means either high or over, my title might
be translated as oversergeant.</p>

<p>"You will be responsible for Vodo's training," Spehon told
Mantar; then we all Maltu Mephised and saluted.</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief as I quitted the office of Spehon.
Evidently he had not received the message as yet. I still had a
little lease on life.</p>

<p>Mantar now took me to the officers' quarters adjoining the
barracks of the Zani Guard, which are situated close to the palace;
and here a barber gave me an approved Zani haircut, after which I
went with Mantar to be outfitted with the regulation uniform and
weapons of a tokordogan of the Zani Guard.</p>

<p>On the way back from the outfitters I heard a great commotion
ahead of us on the broad avenue along which we were walking. People
lining the curbs were shouting something that I could not
understand at first, but presently recognized as the incessant
chant of the Zanis&mdash;Maltu Mephis! As the sound approached I
saw that the shouts were being directed at a procession of giant
gantors.</p>

<p>"Our Beloved Mephis comes this way," said Mantar. "When he
approaches, stand at salute and shout Maltu Mephis as loud as you
can until he has passed."</p>

<p>Presently I saw men standing on their heads in the street and
along the curbs, and each of them was shouting Maltu Mephis at the
top of his lungs. Only the women and the members of the Zani Guard
did not stand on their heads; but everybody shouted, and everybody
saluted who was not using his hands to keep him from falling down.
They commenced when the first elephant came within a few yards of
where they stood, and continued until the last elephant had passed
them by the same distance. They all seemed absolutely devoid of any
sense of humor.</p>

<p>When the procession came abreast of me I saw such ornately
housed and trapped gantors as I had never before seen. In the
gilded howdah of one of them sat a small, insignificant looking man
in the uniform of a Zani kordogan. It was Mephis. He looked
actually frightened; and his eyes were constantly darting from side
to side, warily. I guessed, what I learned later, that he was in
mortal fear of assassination&mdash;and with good reason.</p>

<p>After Mephis had passed I expressed a wish to Mantar to see
something of the city. I told him that I would especially like to
go down to the waterfront and look at the boats there. Immediately
he was suspicious. I have never seen such suspicious people.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to go down to the waterfront?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We Vodaroans depend much on the sea for most of our food;
therefore we are all familiar with boats and fond of them. I am
naturally interested in seeing the design of the small boats of
Anlap. As a matter of fact, I should like much to own one. I like
to sail and fish."</p>

<p>My explanation seemed to satisfy him, and he suggested that we
hail a passing gantor and ride down to the quay, which we did. I
saw innumerable boats, most of which had evidently not been in use
for some considerable time. Mantar explained that they probably
belonged to men who were serving at the front.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I could buy or rent one of them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You do not have to buy or rent anything," he said. "You are now
a member of the Zani Guard and can take anything you please from
anyone who is not a member of the Guard." That was an excellent
convention&mdash;for the Zani Guardsmen.</p>

<p>Having seen and learned what I had come to the waterfront for, I
was ready to return into the city and commence my real training
under Mantar. This lasted in an intensive form for about a week,
during which time I did not visit Zerka nor receive any call from
Spehon. Could it be that the message had not come into his hands? I
could scarcely believe it. Perhaps, I thought, he is not going to
accept Muso's offer and is not, therefore, interested in destroying
me. But that line of reasoning was not wholly satisfactory. Knowing
how suspicious they were and vindictive, I could not believe that
Spehon would permit me to live or wear the uniform of a Zani
Guardsman a day after he discovered how I had lied to him. I was
compelled to consider the matter only as a wholly baffling
mystery.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I enjoyed the companionship of my fellow
officers, with the exception of Mantar. He was a gentleman. Most of
the others were surly boors&mdash;an aggregation of ignorant thugs,
bums, and gangsters. The men under us were of the same types. All
seemed suspicious of one another, and I think especially of Mantar
and me. They resented the fact that we were cultured; and the very
fact that we were cultured seemed to feed their suspicions of us;
and because they felt their inferiority, they hated us, too.
Because of this atmosphere of suspicion it was difficult for me to
learn anything about the one thing that kept me from escaping from
Amlot at once&mdash;I refer to my belief that Mintep might be a
prisoner in the city. I felt that I could easily escape by
commandeering a small boat and sailing along the coast until I came
to the island where my ship was hidden, but first I must assure
myself of the truth or falsity of my suspicion. All that I might
learn was what I overheard by accident. I could not ask direct
questions nor reveal undue interest in any political or other
controversial matter. As a result, my nerves were under constant
strain, so watchful must I be of every word or act or even facial
expression or tone of voice. But it was like that with everyone
else&mdash;I think even with Spehon and perhaps with Mephis
himself, for every man knew that a spy or an informer was watching
to pounce upon him at his first mis-step. The result was not
conducive to garrulity&mdash;conversation, as such, did not exist
except between occasional intimates; and even then I doubt that men
dared speak what was in their hearts.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Ten days had passed, and I was no nearer my goal than on the day I
arrived in Amlot. I was worried and was grieving over Duare. What
must she think? Had Muso told her? Was she well? These unanswerable
questions nearly drove me mad. They almost convinced me that I
should abandon my self-imposed commission and return to Sanara, but
when I thought of the happiness it would bring to Duare were she to
be reunited with her father or her grief were she to know that he
might be a prisoner in Amlot and in constant danger of being
destroyed, I could only remain and do what I considered my duty. I
was in such a mood when I received an invitation from Zerka to
visit her. It was a welcome relief, and I went with pleasure.</p>

<p>We greeted each other with the usual "Maltu Mephis!" which, for
some reason, seemed wholly out of place and incongruous between us.
I always had a feeling that Zerka was hiding a laugh about
something, and especially so when we went through the silly flubdub
of Zani ritual. Hers was a most engaging personality that seemed to
me to be wholly out of harmony with the stupidities of Zanism.</p>

<p>"My!" she exclaimed with a little laugh, "what a handsome Zani
Guardsman we make."</p>

<p>"With this haircut?" I demanded, making a wry face.</p>

<p>She put a finger to her lips. "Ssh!" she cautioned. "I thought
that you would have learned better than that by this time."</p>

<p>"Mayn't I even criticize myself?" I asked, laughing.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Were I you, I should criticize only
Atorians and the enemy in Sanara."</p>

<p>"I don't even do that," I said. "I am what would be called in my
wor&mdash;country a rubber stamp."</p>

<p>"That is a word I do not know," she said. "Can it be possible
that the Vodaroans do not speak the same language as we?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; we speak the same language," I assured her.</p>

<p>"And read it, too?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, of course."</p>

<p>"I thought so," she mused.</p>

<p>I couldn't imagine why she had thought otherwise, or why the
matter was of any importance. Before I could ask her she veered off
onto another track. "Do you like Mantar?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Very much," I said. "It is nice to have the companionship of
one gentleman at least."</p>

<p>"Be careful," she cautioned again. "That is indirect criticism,
but I can assure you it may be just as fatal. You needn't worry
about me, however; I caution you only because there are always
spies. One never may know who may be listening intently to his
conversation in addition to the one to whom it is addressed.
Suppose we go for a ride; then we can talk, and you can say
anything you wish to. My driver has been with my family all his
life. He would never repeat anything he heard."</p>

<p>It seemed a little strange that she should be encouraging me to
talk openly, in view of the fact that she had previously warned me
against it.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," I said, "that all the world might listen to what I
have to say. I am most happy here."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," she said.</p>

<p>"I have learned though that it is just as well not to talk too
much. In fact, I am surprised that I have not forgotten how to
talk."</p>

<p>"But of course you talk freely with Mantar?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not talk at all about anything I am not supposed to talk
about," I said.</p>

<p>"But with Mantar, it is different," she urged. "You may trust
him fully. Discuss anything you wish with him. Mantar would never
betray you."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Because you are <i>my</i> friend," she replied.</p>

<p>"I appreciate all that that implies," I said, "and am very
grateful for your friendship. I wish that I might repay the
obligation in some way."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you may have the chance some day&mdash;when I know you
better."</p>

<p>A gantor was brought into the courtyard of the palace, and we
mounted to the howdah. This time there were no armed
guards&mdash;only ourselves and the driver.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go?" asked Zerka.</p>

<p>"Anywhere. I should like to see some more of the public
buildings." I hoped in this way to discover the location of the Gap
kum Rov, where the mysterious jong was imprisoned. I hadn't dared
ask anyone; and I didn't dare ask Zerka, for notwithstanding her
assurances that I might speak freely to her, I was not so sure that
it would be wise. As far as I knew she might be a spy herself. The
sudden friendship that she had fostered between us gave some color
to this suspicion. I didn't want to believe it, for she seemed very
sincere in her liking for me; but I could take no chances. I must
suspect everyone. In that, I was becoming a true Zani.</p>

<p>She gave some directions to the driver; then she settled back.
"Now," she said, "that we are comfortable and alone let's have a
good talk. You see we really know very little about one
another."</p>

<p>"I have wondered a great deal about you," I said. "You are such
an important person, and yet you waste your time on a total
stranger."</p>

<p>"I do not feel that I am wasting my time," she said. "It is not
a waste of time to make new friends. I really have very few, you
know. The war and the revolution took most of them&mdash;the war
took my man." She said ooljagan&mdash;loveman. "I have lived alone
ever since&mdash;rather a useless life, I am afraid. Now tell me
about yourself."</p>

<p>"You know all there is to tell," I assured her.</p>

<p>"Tell me of your life in Vodaro," she insisted. "I should like
to know something of the customs and manners of the people of that
far country."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't be interested. We are a simple
people." I couldn't very well tell her that she probably knew more
about Vodaro than I.</p>

<p>"But I would be interested," she insisted. "Tell me how you got
here."</p>

<p>I was most uncomfortable. I feel that I am not a very convincing
liar. This was really my first essay at really spectacular lying,
and I was very much afraid that I might trip myself up. If I lied
too much, I should have too many lies to remember. I already had
enough to tax my memory as it was. My recollection of even the
location of Vodaro was rather hazy. The country was shown on a map
I had seen in the library of Danus at Kooaad. I remembered that
fact concerning it; and that was about all, except that it was
supposed to run far back into Karbol, the cold country.</p>

<p>I had to answer Zerka's question, and my explanation of how I
got to Amlot would have to be uncheckable. It was necessary to do a
lot of thinking in a split second.</p>

<p>"One of our merchants had chartered a small ship and had loaded
it with furs with which he expected to trade for merchandise in
foreign countries. We sailed north for a month without encountering
land until we sighted Anlap. Here we were overtaken by a terrific
storm which wrecked the ship. I was washed ashore, the sole
survivor. A kindly farmer took me in, and from him I learned that I
was in the kingdom of Korva, on Anlap. He also told me about the
war raging here, and brought me as far as the city gates with a
load of farm produce. The rest, I have told you."</p>

<p>"And what was the name of this kindly farmer?" she asked. "He
should be rewarded."</p>

<p>"I never learned his name," I said.</p>

<p>She looked at me with the oddest expression that made me feel
that she knew I was lying; but perhaps it was only my guilty
conscience that suggested that fear. Anyway, she didn't say
anything more about the matter, for which I was deeply grateful. As
we approached one of the main avenues of the city, I saw men
standing on their heads shouting "Maltu Mephis!" and others
saluting and shouting the same stereotyped mandatory laudative.</p>

<p>"Our Beloved Mephis must be abroad," I said.</p>

<p>She shot me a quick glance, but I maintained a perfectly serious
demeanor. "Yes," she said, "and don't forget to stand up and salute
and acclaim him. There is to be a review of troops outside the
city. A new unit is going to the front. Our Beloved Mephis is on
his way to review them now. Would you be interested in seeing
it?"</p>

<p>I told her that I would; so after Mephis's cortege passed, we
fell in behind and followed it out onto the plain beyond the city.
After Mephis had taken his place and the shouting had died out and
men had stopped standing on their heads, Zerka directed our driver
to move to a point where we could watch the ceremonies
advantageously. A large body of troops was massed at some distance
to the left, and at a signal from Mephis, transmitted by trumpet to
the waiting troops, they broke into column of companies and
advanced toward the great man so that they would pass before him at
the proper distance. It was so similar to the passing in review of
troops in civilized countries on Earth that it was rather
startling; but when I gave the matter thought, I could not conceive
any more practical way of reviewing troops.</p>

<p>When the first company was at about a hundred yards from Mephis,
the step was changed. The entire company, in unison, took three
steps forward, hopped once on the left foot, took three more steps
forward, leaped straight up to a height of about two feet, and then
repeated. They continued in this way until they had passed a
hundred yards beyond Mephis; and all the time they shouted "Maltu
Mephis!" in a sing-song chant.</p>

<p>"Is that not impressive?" demanded Zerka, at the same time
watching me carefully as though to detect my exact reaction.</p>

<p>"Very," I said.</p>

<p>"It is an innovation sponsored by Our Beloved Mephis," explained
Zerka.</p>

<p>"I could easily imagine that that might be so," I replied.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10" name="ch10">X. &mdash; THE PRISON OF DEATH</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">I HAD enjoyed my long visit with Zerka. We had
eaten again at the same restaurant in which we had met, we had gone
to one of the amazing theaters of Amlot, and we had finally gotten
home about the nineteenth hour, which would be about 2:00 A.M.
Earth time; then Zerka had invited me in for a little supper. But
during all that time neither one of us had learned anything of
importance about the other, which I think was the uppermost desire
in the mind of each of us; nor had I had the Gap kum Rov pointed
out to me. However, I had had a rather enjoyable day, marred only
by my constant and depressing worries concerning Duare.</p>

<p>The theaters of Amlot and the plays shown therein under the
Zanis are, I believe, of sufficient interest to warrant a brief
digression. The audiences in the theaters sit with their backs
toward the stage. In front of them on the end wall of the theater
is a huge mirror, so placed that every one in the house may see it,
just as a motion picture screen is placed in our cinemas. The
action taking place on the stage behind the audience is reflected
from the mirror, and by a system of very ingenious lighting stands
out brilliantly. By manipulation of the lights the scenes may be
blacked out completely to denote a lapse of time or permit a change
of scenery. Of course the reflections of the actors are not life
size, and therefore the result gives an illusion of unreality
reminiscent of puppet shows or the old days of silent pictures. I
asked Zerka why the audience didn't face the stage and look
directly at the actors; and she explained that it was because the
profession of acting had formerly been in disrepute, and it had
been considered a disgrace to be seen upon a stage. They got around
it in this ingenious way; and it was considered extremely poor form
to turn around and look directly at the actors, even though the
profession was now considered an honorable one.</p>

<p>But the thing that amused me most was the play. There are one
hundred theaters in Amlot, and the same play was being shown in all
of them. It was the life of Mephis! Zerka told me that it consisted
of one hundred and one episodes, each episode constituting a
night's performance, and that it was absolutely obligatory on all
citizens to attend the theater at least once in every ten days.
They were given certificates to attest that they had done so. The
play had already been running for more than a year. Mephis's
publicity agent should have been born in Hollywood.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The day following my visit with Zerka I was given a detachment of
the Zani Guard and told to report to the Gap kum Rov. It was just
as easy as that. Here I had been trying to locate the place for
days, and without success; now I was being officially detailed to
the prison. Just what my duties were to be and whether I was to
remain there or not, I did not know. My orders were simply to
report to one Torko, governor of the prison&mdash;The Prison of
Death.</p>

<p>My detachment consisted of eleven men, one of whom was a
kordogan, whom I ordered to march the detachment to the prison. I
didn't wish them to know that I had no idea where it was. The
prison stood on a small island in the bay, not more than a hundred
yards off shore. I had seen it on several occasions, but had not
guessed that it was the notorious Gap kum Rov. At the quay we
entered a small launch belonging to the prison and were soon
standing beneath its grim walls. The mere fact that we were members
of the Zani Guard gave us immediate entrance, and I was presently
in the office of Torko. He was a large man, heavy of feature and
coarse, with one of the cruelest human faces I have ever seen.
Unlike most Amtorians, he was ill-favored. His manner was gruff and
surly, and I sensed immediately that he did not like me. Well, our
dislike was mutual.</p>

<p>"I never saw you before," he growled, after I had reported. "Why
didn't they send someone I knew? What do <i>you</i> know about
running a prison?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I assured him. "I didn't ask for the assignment. If I
can put up with it, I guess you can."</p>

<p>He grunted something I couldn't understand, and then said, "Come
with me. Now that you're here, you've got to familiarize yourself
with the prison and with my system of administration."</p>

<p>A second door in his office, opposite the one through which I
had entered, opened into a guardroom full of Zani Guardsmen, one of
whom he ordered to go to the courtyard and fetch my men; then he
crossed to another door, heavily bolted and barred. When this was
opened it revealed a long corridor on either side of which were
partitions of heavy iron bars back of which were huddled several
hundred prisoners, many of whom were covered with wounds and
sores.</p>

<p>"These mistals," explained Torko, "have been guilty of
disrespect to Our Beloved Mephis or to the glorious heroes of the
Zani Guard. Show them no mercy."</p>

<p>Next he took me to the end of the corridor, through another
door, and up a flight of stairs to the second floor, where there
were two rows of individual cells, each cell containing from one to
three prisoners, although each would have been cramped quarters for
one.</p>

<p>"These are traitors," said Torko. "They are awaiting trial. We
really haven't enough room here; so every day, when we receive a
new batch, we take some of them out and shoot them. Of course, we
give them a chance to confess first. If they do, why naturally a
trial isn't necessary; and we shoot them. If they don't confess, we
shoot them for impeding justice."</p>

<p>"Very simple," I commented.</p>

<p>"Very," he agreed, "and eminently fair, too. It was my
idea."</p>

<p>"Our Beloved Mephis knows how to choose his lieutenants, doesn't
he?"</p>

<p>He looked very pleased at that, and really smiled. It was the
first time I had seen him smile, and I hoped he wouldn't do it
again&mdash;his smile seemed only to make his face appear more
cruel and repulsive.</p>

<p>"Well," he exclaimed, "I guess I was wrong about you&mdash;you
talk like a good man and an intelligent one. We shall get along
splendidly. Are you very close to Our Beloved Mephis?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to say that I'm not," I told him. "I merely serve
him."</p>

<p>"Well, you must know someone who is," he insisted.</p>

<p>I was about to reply, telling him that I was afraid I knew no
one who had the ear of Mephis, when he caught sight of the ring
hanging on a chain around my neck. It was too small to fit on any
of my fingers; I wore it thus.</p>

<p>"I should say you do know someone close to Mephis," he
exclaimed. "The Toganja Zerka! Man! but are you lucky!"</p>

<p>I did not reply, as I had no stomach to discuss Zerka with this
beast; but he insisted. "She was bright to come over to the Zanis,"
he said. "Most of her kind were killed; and those that did come
over are usually under suspicion, but not Toganja Zerka. They say
Mephis has the utmost confidence in her and often consults her in
matters of policy. It was her idea to have the Zani Guard patrol
the city constantly looking for traitors and beating up citizens
who couldn't give a good account of themselves. Playing the life of
Our Beloved Mephis constantly in all the theaters was also her
idea, as was that of having civilians stand on their heads and
cheer whenever Our Beloved Mephis passed. Even the expression Our
Beloved Mephis was coined by her. Oh, she's a brilliant one. Mephis
owes her a lot."</p>

<p>All this was most illuminating. I had always felt that Zerka
applauded Mephis with her tongue in her cheek. I had even doubted
her loyalty to him or to the Zani cause. Now I didn't know what to
think, but I certainly congratulated myself upon the fact that I
had not confided in her. Somehow, I felt a little sad and
depressed, as one does when disillusioned, especially if the
disillusionment concerns a friend he has admired.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Torko, "if you should put in a good word for me
with the toganja, it would be sure to reach the ear of Our Beloved
Mephis. How about it, my excellent friend?"</p>

<p>"Wait until I know you better," I said; "then I shall know what
to report to the toganja." This was almost blackmail, but I felt no
compunction.</p>

<p>"You'll have nothing but the best to report of me," he assured
me; "we shall get along splendidly. And now I'll take you down to
the courtroom where the trials are conducted and show you the cells
where Our Beloved Mephis keeps his favorite prisoners."</p>

<p>He led me down into a dark basement and into a large room with a
high bench running across one end. Behind the bench were a number
of seats, the whole being raised a couple of feet above the floor
level. Around the sides of the room were low benches, which
evidently served as seats for spectators. The rest of the room was
devoted to an elaborate display of the most fiendish instruments of
torture the mind of man might conceive. I shall not dwell upon
them. It is enough to say that all were horrible and many of them
absolutely unmentionable. All my life I shall be trying to forget
them and the hideous things I was forced to see perpetrated there
upon both men and women.</p>

<p>Torko made a wide, sweeping gesture, proudly. "These are my
pets," he said. "Many of them are my own invention. Believe me,
just a look at them usually gets a confession; but we give them a
taste of them anyway."</p>

<p>"After they have confessed?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why certainly. Is it not a treasonable thing to cheat the state
of the usefulness of these ingenious contrivances that have cost so
much in thought and money to produce?"</p>

<p>"Your logic is unimpeachable," I told him. "It is evident that
you are a perfect Zani."</p>

<p>"And you are a man of great intelligence, my friend, Vodo. And
now, come with me&mdash;you shall see some more of this ideal
plant."</p>

<p>He led me into a dark corridor beyond the torture chamber. Here
were small cells, feebly illuminated by a single dim light in the
central corridor. A number of men were confined, each in a cell by
himself. It was so dark that I could not distinguish the features
of any of them, as all remained in the far corners of their cramped
quarters; and many sat with their faces hidden in their hands,
apparently oblivious of the fact that we were there. One was
moaning; and another shrieked and gibbered, his mind gone.</p>

<p>"That one," said Torko, "was a famous physician. He enjoyed the
confidence of everyone, including Our Beloved Mephis. But can you
imagine how heinously he betrayed it?"</p>

<p>"No," I admitted, "I cannot. Did he attempt to poison
Mephis?"</p>

<p>"What he did was almost as bad. He was actually apprehended in
the act of alleviating the agony of an Atorian who was dying of an
incurable disease! Can you imagine?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid," I said, "that my imagination is permanently
incapacitated. There are things that transcend the limits of a
normal imagination. Today you have shown me such things."</p>

<p>"He should have been executed; but when he went mad, we felt
that he would suffer far more if he lived. We were right. We Zanis
are always right."</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed, "it is the indisputable privilege of all Zanis
to be always right."</p>

<p>He took me next down a dark corridor to another room at the far
side of the building. There was nothing here but an enormous
furnace and a foul odor.</p>

<p>"Here is where we burn the bodies," Torko explained; then he
pointed to a trap door in the floor. "Be careful not to step on
that," he cautioned. "It is not very substantial. We dump the ashes
down there into the bay. The chute is quite large. If the door gave
way with you, you'd land in the bay."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
I spent a week undergoing a sort of training in inhumanity; and
then Torko obtained a leave of absence, and I was left in charge as
acting governor of the Prison of Death. During the time that he was
away I did what I could to alleviate the sufferings of the inmates
of that hideous sink of misery and despair. I permitted them to
clean up their foul cells and themselves, and I gave them
quantities of good food. There were no "trials" while I was in
charge and only one execution, but that was ordered by a higher
authority&mdash;in fact, by Mephis himself. I received word about
the 11th hour one day that Mephis would visit the prison at the
13th hour&mdash;2:00 P.M. E.T. As I had never met the great man and
had no idea how to receive him or conduct myself, I was in
something of a quandary; as I knew that a single error, however
unintentional, would affront him and result in my execution. At
last it occurred to me that my kordogan might help me out. He was
more than anxious to display his knowledge; and so, as the 13th
hour approached, I anticipated the coming event with considerable
assurance. With a number of warriors as an escort, I waited at the
quay with the prison launch; and when Mephis hove in sight with his
retinue, I lined up my men and we saluted and Maltu Mephised him in
orthodox style. He was quite affable as he greeted me with
condescending cordiality.</p>

<p>"I have heard of you," he said. "If you are a protege of Toganja
Zerka, you must be a good Zani."</p>

<p>"There is only one good Zani," I said.</p>

<p>He thought I meant him; and he was pleased. The kordogan had the
remaining guardsmen lined up in the guard room; and as we passed
through, every one saluted and shouted "Maltu Mephis!" at the top
of his voice. I wondered at the time how Mephis could listen to
such forced acclaim without feeling like the ass he was; but I
suppose an ass doesn't mind being an ass, or doesn't realize
it.</p>

<p>The great man asked to be taken into the basement, where his own
particular prisoners were incarcerated. He took only me and two of
his aides with him, one of the latter being his present
favorite&mdash;an effeminate looking man, bejeweled like a woman.
When we reached the room where the prisoners' cells were located,
Mephis directed me to show him the cell of Kord, the former jong of
Korva.</p>

<p>"Torko has not told me the names of any of these prisoners," I
explained. "He said it was your wish that they remain
nameless."</p>

<p>Mephis nodded. "Quite right," he said, "but of course the acting
governor of the prison should know who they are&mdash;and keep the
knowledge to himself."</p>

<p>"You wish to speak to me, Mephis?" asked a voice from a nearby
cell.</p>

<p>"That is he," said Mephis. "Unlock his cell."</p>

<p>I took the master key from my belt and did as Mephis bid me.</p>

<p>"Come out!" commanded he.</p>

<p>Kord was still a fine looking man, though wasted by confinement
and starvation. "What do you want of me?" he demanded. There was no
"Maltu Mephis!" here, no cringing. Kord was still the jong, and
Mephis shrunk in his presence to the insignificant scum he had been
born. I think he felt it; for he commenced to bluster and talk
loud.</p>

<p>"Drag the prisoner to the courtroom!" he shouted to me, and
turned back to that room himself, followed by his aides.</p>

<p>I took Kord gently by the arm. "Come," I said.</p>

<p>I think he had expected to be jerked or kicked, as he probably
had been on former occasions, for he looked at me in something of
surprise when I treated him with decent consideration. My heart
certainly went out to him, for it must have been galling to a great
jong such as he had been to be ordered about by scum like Mephis;
and, too, there must have been the knowledge that he was probably
going to be tortured. I expected it, and I didn't know how I was
going to be able to stand and watch it without raising a hand in
interference. Only my knowledge that it would have done him no good
and resulted in my own death and, consequently, the defeat of all
my own plans, convinced me that I must hide my indignation and
accept whatever was forthcoming.</p>

<p>When we entered the courtroom, we saw that Mephis and his aides
had already seated themselves at the judges' bench, before which
Mephis directed me to bring the prisoner. For a full minute the
dictator sat in silence, his shifty eyes roving about the room,
never meeting those of Kord and myself but momentarily. At last he
spoke.</p>

<p>"You have been a powerful jong, Kord," he said. "You may be jong
once more. I have come here today to offer you your throne
again."</p>

<p>He waited, but Kord made no reply. He just stood there, erect
and majestic, looking Mephis squarely in the face, every inch a
king. His attitude naturally irritated the little man, who, though
all-powerful, still felt his inferiority to the great man before
him.</p>

<p>"I tell you, I will give you back your throne, Kord," repeated
Mephis, his voice rising. "You have only to sign this," and he held
up a paper. "It will end needless bloodshed and restore Korva the
peace and prosperity she deserves."</p>

<p>"What is written on the paper?" demanded Kord.</p>

<p>"It is an order to Muso," replied Mephis, "telling him to lay
down his arms because you have been restored as jong and peace has
been declared in Korva."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Kord.</p>

<p>"Practically all," replied Mephis. "There is another paper here
that you will sign that will insure the peace and prosperity of
Korva."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It is an order appointing me advisor to the jong, with full
power to act in his place in all emergencies. It also ratifies all
laws promulgated by the Zani Party since it took control of
Korva."</p>

<p>"In other and more candid words, it betrays my few remaining
loyal subjects into the hands of Mephis," said Kord. "I refuse, of
course."</p>

<p>"Just a moment," snapped Mephis. "There is another condition
that may cause you to alter your decision."</p>

<p>"And that?" inquired Kord.</p>

<p>"If you refuse, you will be considered a traitor to your
country, and treated accordingly."</p>

<p>"Assassinated?"</p>

<p>"Executed," corrected Mephis.</p>

<p>"I still refuse," said Kord.</p>

<p>Mephis rose from his seat. His face was livid with rage. "Then
die, you fool!" he almost screamed; and, drawing his Amtorian
pistol, poured a stream of the deadly r-rays into the defenseless
man standing before him. Without a sound, Kord, Jong of Korva, sank
lifeless to the floor.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11" name="ch11">XI. &mdash; THE NET DRAWS CLOSER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE next day, as I was making my rounds of the
prison, I took it upon myself to inquire of a number of the
prisoners as to the nature of the offenses that had resulted in
such drastic punishment, for to be imprisoned in Gap kum Rov was,
indeed, real punishment. I found that many of them had expressed
their opinions of Mephis and the Zanis too freely, and that
supposed friends had informed upon them. Many did not know what the
charges against them were, and quite a few were there because of
old grudges held against them by members of the Zani Guard. One man
was there because an officer of the Zani Guard desired his woman;
another because he had sneezed while, standing upon his head, he
should have been shouting Maltu Mephis. The only hope any of them
had of release was through bribery or the influence of some member
of the Zani Party, but this latter was difficult to obtain because
of the fear the Zanis themselves felt of directing suspicion upon
themselves. These inquiries I had made were of the prisoners in the
big tanks on the main floor. My interest lay in the dim corridors
below ground, where I thought that Mintep might be confined. I had
not dared reveal any interest in these prisoners for fear of
directing suspicion upon myself, for I knew that there were
constantly informers among the prisoners, who won favors and
sometimes freedom by informing upon their fellow prisoners. Torko
had told me that I was not even to know the names of the prisoners
on that lower level; but I was determined to learn if Mintep was
among them, and finally I hit upon a plan that I hoped would serve
my purpose. With difficulty, I wrote some very bad verse in
Amtorian, which I sang to a tune that had been popular in America
when I left the Earth. In two of the verses was the message I
wished to use to elicit a sign from Mintep that he was a prisoner
there, and thus to locate his cell.</p>

<p>To allay suspicion, I formed the habit of singing my song as I
went about my daily duties; but I sang it at first only on the
upper floors. My kordogan and some of the other members of the
guard showed an interest in my song, and asked me questions about
it. I told them that I didn't know the origin or significance of
it, that the words meant nothing to me, and that I only sang it
because I was fond of the tune.</p>

<p>In addition to my essay at poetry, I had been busy along another
line of endeavor. The cell and door locks of the prison were not
all alike, but there was a master key which opened any of them. In
Torko's absence, I carried this master key; and one of the first
things I did after it came into my possession was to take it into
the city and have two duplicates made. I had no definite plan in
mind at the time wherein they might figure; but, though I took
considerable risk in having them made, I felt that eventually they
must be of the utmost value in releasing Mintep, if it developed
that he was a prisoner in Gap kum Rov.</p>

<p>You can scarcely realize the caution I was forced to observe in
everything that I did, in order not to arouse suspicion, to incur
enmities, or engender envy, for every citizen of Amlot was a spy or
a potential informer. Yet I had to make haste, for I knew that over
my head hung constantly that Damoclean message from Muso. Who had
it? Why had they not struck?</p>

<p><br>
<br>
I was accustomed to wandering around the prison alone, inspecting
the cells, the guardroom, the kitchen; so it would arouse no
comment were I discovered anywhere; and the fact that I was almost
constantly humming or singing my foolish song was, I felt, evidence
that there was nothing irregular or surreptitious about my
activities.</p>

<p>It was the day before Torko's return that I determined to try to
ascertain definitely if Mintep were imprisoned at the lower level.
With this idea in mind, I went singing through the prison, feeling,
as usual, like a loony. Down to the basement I went, through the
courtroom, and into the dim precincts of the forbidden cells. I
went to the furnace and passed along the corridor where the cells
were, and there I sang the two verses that I had written to arouse
Mintep's interest and, perhaps, beguile an acknowledgement, if he
were there. These are the verses to which I refer, roughly
translated into English:</p>
<br>

<p class="verse">"Mourned by a nation,<br>
By her kinsman sought,<br>
Duare lives, and<br>
Of thy fate knows naught."</p>

<p class="verse">"A word, a sign, is<br>
All she asks of thee.<br>
If thou canst give it,<br>
Put thy trust in me."</p>

<p>I kept right on singing other verses, or humming the air, as I
passed along the cells; but there was no response. Clear to the end
of the corridor I went, and then turned back. Once more I sang
those two verses, and as I approached the last cells, I saw a man
pressing close to the bars of one of them. In the dim light, I
could not see his features plainly; but as I passed close to him,
he whispered the single word, "Here." I noted the location of his
cell and continued on my way.</p>

<p>With Torko, I occupied my office next to the guardroom: and when
I arrived there, I found my kordogan waiting with some new
prisoners. One of my duties was to receive all prisoners, question
them, and assign them to cells. A clerk kept a record of all such
matters. All I was supposed to do, according to Torko, was to
insult and browbeat the prisoners.</p>

<p>There were three of them, and they lined them up in front of my
desk. As I looked up at them, I immediately recognized one of them
as Horjan, the brother of Lodas; and, to my horror, I saw
recognition slowly dawn in his eyes; or at least I thought I
did.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Horjan," he replied.</p>

<p>"Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"Some time ago I reported a stranger hiding in my home," he
replied. "When the guard came, they found no one&mdash;the man had
escaped. They were very angry with me. A neighbor, whom I had told
of my discovery of the man, became angry with me; and today he went
to the Zani Guard and told them that he had seen the man and that I
had been hiding him, and that I only reported the matter because I
knew that he would. He told them that the man was a spy from Sanara
and that he was still in the city."</p>

<p>"How does he know the man is still in the city?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"He says that he has seen him&mdash;that he could never forget
his face or his <i>eyes</i>&mdash;he says that the man was wearing
<i>the uniform of an officer of the Zani Guard</i>."</p>

<p>I knew that Horjan's friend had not seen me, and that this was
merely Horjan's way of communicating to me the fact that he had
recognized me.</p>

<p>"It would be too bad if your friend bore false witness against
an officer of the Zani Guard," I said. "If anyone did that, it
would be necessary to torture him before killing him. But perhaps
it would be well to question your friend to learn if <i>he</i> ever
did see this man in your house, and have him describe him."</p>

<p>Horjan paled. He realized that he had committed an error; and he
was terrified, for he knew that his friend had never seen me and
could not describe me.</p>

<p>"I hope it does not get him in trouble," I continued. "It is
deplorable that there should be so much loose talking in Amlot. It
would be better if some people held their tongues."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Horjan, meekly, "there is too much loose talk; but
you may rest assured that I shall never talk."</p>

<p>I hoped that he meant it, but I was very much concerned. Now,
indeed, must I take immediate steps to escape from Amlot. But how?
My problem was now further complicated by my discovery of
Mintep.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
On the following day Torko returned, and I was sent to make an
arrest in the quarter occupied by scholars and scientists. There
were many Amtorians living in this quarter, for their minds incline
toward scholarly pursuits and scientific investigation. Here the
few who had not been killed were segregated, not being allowed to
leave the quarter, which, because of them, was in bad repute with
the Zanis, who wreaked mean little persecutions on the slightest
pretext. The Zanis hated scholars and scientists, as they hated all
who were superior to them in any way.</p>

<p>On my way to the quarter, I passed a field where hundreds of
boys were being drilled by kordogans of the Zani Guard. There were
little fellows of five and six and many older boys. This same thing
was going on all over Amlot&mdash;this was the only schooling the
Zani boys received. The only toys they were allowed to have were
weapons. Babes in arms were given blunt daggers upon which to cut
their teeth. I said that was all the schooling they received. I was
wrong. They were taught to shout "Maltu Mephis!" upon any pretext
or upon none; and a chapter from <i>The Life of Our Beloved
Mephis</i>, written by himself, was read to them daily. It was
quite a comprehensive education&mdash;for a Zani.</p>

<p>The quarter where I was to make the arrest had formerly been a
prosperous one, as, during the regime of the jongs, scholars and
scientists were held in high esteem; but now it was run down, and
the few people I saw on the streets looked shabby and half starved.
Arrived at the home of my victim (I can think of nothing more
suitable to call him) I walked in with a couple of my men, leaving
the others outside. As I entered the main room, which might be
called the living room, I saw a woman step hurriedly between some
hangings at the opposite side of the room; but not so quickly but
that I recognized her. It was Zerka.</p>

<p>A man and woman sitting in the room rose and faced me. They both
looked surprised; the woman, frightened. They were exceptionally
fine looking, intelligent appearing people.</p>

<p>"You are Narvon?" I asked of the man.</p>

<p>He nodded. "I am Narvon. What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"I have orders to place you under arrest," I said. "You will
come with me."</p>

<p>"What is the charge against me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I told him. "I have orders to arrest
you&mdash;that is all I know."</p>

<p>He turned sadly to say goodby to the woman; and as he took her
in his arms and kissed her, she broke down. He choked a little as
he tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>The kardogan who accompanied me stepped forward and seized him
roughly by the arm. "Come on!" he shouted gruffly. "Do you think we
are going to stand here all day while you two dirty traitors
blubber?"</p>

<p>"Leave them alone!" I ordered. "They may say goodby."</p>

<p>He shot me an angry look, and stepped back. He was not my own
kardogan, who, while bad enough, had learned from me to temper his
fanaticism a little with tolerance if not compassion.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "while they're doing that, I'll search the
house."</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," I said. "You'll stay here and
keep still and take your orders from me."</p>

<p>"Didn't you see that woman sneak into the back room when we
entered?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course I did," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ain't you going to go after her?"</p>

<p>"No," I told him. "My orders were to arrest this man. I had no
orders to search the house or question anyone else. I obey orders,
and I advise you to do the same."</p>

<p>He gave me a nasty look, and grumbled something I did not catch;
then he sulked for the remainder of the day. On the way back to the
prison I walked beside Narvon; and when I saw that the kardogan was
out of earshot, I asked him a question in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Was the woman I saw in your house, the one who ran out of the
room as I came in, a good friend of yours?"</p>

<p>He looked just a bit startled, and he hesitated a fraction of a
second too long before he replied. "No," he said. "I never saw her
before. I do not know what she wanted. She came in just ahead of
you. I think she must have made a mistake in the house, and been
embarrassed and confused when you came in. You know it is often
dangerous, nowadays, to make mistakes, however innocent they may
be."</p>

<p>He could have been tortured and executed for a statement such as
that, and he should have known it. I cautioned him.</p>

<p>"You are a strange Zani," he said. "You act almost as though you
were my friend."</p>

<p>"Forget it," I warned him.</p>

<p>"I shall," he promised.</p>

<p>At the prison I took him at once to Torko's office.</p>

<p>"So you are the great scholar, Narvon," snarled Torko. "You
should have stuck to your books instead of trying to foment a
rebellion. Who were your accomplices?"</p>

<p>"I have done nothing wrong," said Narvon; "and so I had no
accomplices in anything that was wrong."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow your memory will be better," snapped Torko. "Our
Beloved Mephis himself will conduct your trial, and you will find
that we have ways in which to make traitors tell the truth. Take
him to the lower level, Vodo; and then report back here to me."</p>

<p>As I passed through the courtroom with Narvon, I saw him pale as
his eyes took in the instruments of torture there.</p>

<p>"You will not name your accomplices, will you?" I asked.</p>

<p>He shuddered and seemed to shrink suddenly. "I do not know," he
admitted. "I have never been able to endure pain. I do not know
what I shall do. I only know that I am afraid&mdash;oh, so terribly
afraid. Why can they not kill me without torturing me!"</p>

<p>I was very much afraid, myself&mdash;afraid for Zerka. I don't
know why I should have been&mdash;she was supposed to be such a
good Zani. Perhaps it was the fact that she had run away from men
in the uniform of the Zani Guard that aroused my suspicions.
Perhaps it was because I had never been able to reconcile my belief
in her with the knowledge that she was a Zani. Quite a little, too,
because Narvon had so palpably tried to protect her.</p>

<p>When I returned to Torko's office, the kardogan who had been
with me when I made the arrest was just leaving. Torko was scowling
ominously.</p>

<p>"I have heard bad reports of your conduct during my absence," he
said.</p>

<p>"That is strange," I said&mdash;"unless I have made an enemy
here; then you might hear almost anything, as you know."</p>

<p>"The information has come from different sources. I am told that
you were very soft and lenient with the prisoners."</p>

<p>"I was not cruel, if that is what is meant," I replied. "I had
no orders to be cruel."</p>

<p>"And today you did not search a house where you knew a woman to
be hiding&mdash;the home of a traitor, too."</p>

<p>"I had no orders to search the house or question anybody," I
retorted. "I did not know the man was a traitor; I was not told
what his offense had been."</p>

<p>"Technically, you are right," he admitted; "but you must learn
to have more initiative. We arrest no one who is not a menace to
the state. Such people deserve no mercy. Then you whispered with
the prisoner all the way to the prison."</p>

<p>I laughed outright. "The kardogan doesn't like me because I put
him in his place. He became a little insubordinate. I will not
stand for that. Of course I talked with the prisoner. Was there
anything wrong in that?"</p>

<p>"The less one talks with anyone, the safer he is," he said.</p>

<p>He dismissed me then; but I realized that suspicions were
aroused; and there was that brother of Lodas just full of them, and
of real knowledge concerning me, too; and primed to spill
everything he knew or suspected at the first opportunity. Whatever
I was going to do, I must do quickly if I were ever going to
escape. There were too many fingers ready to point at me, and there
was still the message from Muso. I asked permission to go fishing
the next day; and as Torko loved fresh fish, he granted it.</p>

<p>"You'd better stay around until after Our Beloved Mephis has
left the prison," he said. "We may want your help."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The next day Narvon was tried before Mephis, and I was there with a
detail of the guard&mdash;just ornamentally. We lined up at
attention at each end of the bench where Mephis, Spehon, and Torko
sat. The benches at the sides of the room were filled with other
Zani bigwigs. When Narvon was brought in, Mephis asked him just one
question.</p>

<p>"Who were your accomplices?"</p>

<p>"I have done nothing, and I had no accomplices," said Narvon. He
looked haggard and his voice was weak. Every time he looked at an
instrument of torture he winced. I saw that he was in a state of
absolute funk. I couldn't blame him.</p>

<p>Then they commenced to torture him. What I witnessed, I would
not describe if I could. It beggars description. There are no words
in any language to depict the fiendishly bestial cruelties and
indignities they inflicted on his poor, quivering flesh. When he
fainted, they resuscitated him; and went at it again. I think his
screams might have been heard a mile away. At last he gave in.</p>

<p>"I'll tell! I'll tell!" he shrieked.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Mephis. "Who are they?"</p>

<p>"There was only one," whispered Narvon, in a weak voice that
could scarcely be heard.</p>

<p>"Louder!" cried Mephis. "Give him another turn of the screw!
Then maybe he'll speak up."</p>

<p>"It was the Toganja Z&mdash;" Then he fainted as they gave the
screw another turn. They tried to revive him again, but it was too
late&mdash;Narvon was dead.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12" name="ch12">XII. &mdash; HUNTED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">I WENT fishing; and I caught some fish, but I
couldn't forget how Narvon died. I shall never forget it. Nor could
I forget his dying words. Coupled with what I had seen in his
house, I knew the name that had died in his throat. I wondered if
any of the Zanis there had guessed what I <i>knew</i>. Not only did
I fish, but I did some reconnoitering and a great deal of thinking.
I wondered what to do about Zerka. Should I risk Mintep's life to
warn her, with considerable likelihood that I might be arrested
with her? Really, there was but one answer. I must warn her, for
she had befriended me. I sailed around close to the prison, for
there were certain things I must know about the outside of the
place. I knew all that was necessary about the inside. After
satisfying myself on the points concerning which I had been in
doubt, I came ashore, and went to my quarters in the barracks. Here
I found an order relieving me of duty at the prison. I guess Torko
had found me too soft for his purposes; or was there something
else, something far more sinister behind it? I felt a net closing
about me.</p>

<p>As I sat there in my quarters with this most unpleasant thought
as my sole company, a guardsman came and announced that the
commandant wished me to report to him at once. This, I thought, is
the end. I am about to be arrested. I contemplated flight; but I
knew how futile such an attempt would be, and so I went to the
commandant's office and reported.</p>

<p>"A dozen prisoners have been brought from the front at Sanara,"
he said. "I am detailing twelve officers to question them. We can
get more out of them if they are questioned separately. Be very
kind to the man you question. Give him wine and food. Tell him what
a pleasant life a soldier may have serving with the armies of the
Zanis, but get all the information you can out of him. When they
have all been questioned, we shall turn them over to some private
soldiers to entertain for a few days; then we shall send two of
them back to the front and let them escape to tell about the fine
treatment they received in Amlot. That will mean many desertions.
The other ten will be shot."</p>

<p>The Zanis were full of cute little tricks like that. Well, I got
my man and took him to my quarters. I plied him with food, wine,
and questions. I wanted to know about Sanara on my own account, but
I didn't dare let him know how much I knew about the city and
conditions there. I had to draw him out without him suspecting me.
It chanced that he was a young officer&mdash;a nice chap, well
connected. He knew everyone and all the gossip of the court and the
important families.</p>

<p>There were certain questions that it would be quite natural for
any Zani to ask. Those relative to the defenses of the city and
other military matters he answered glibly&mdash;so glibly that I
knew he was lying, and I admired him for it. When I asked him about
Muso, he talked freely. It was evident that he didn't like
Muso.</p>

<p>"He's turned his woman out," he volunteered. "Her name is
Illana. She is a fine woman. Everyone is very much incensed over
it, but what can anyone do? He is jong. The woman he has selected
in Illana's place does not want to take it. It is common talk that
she loathes Muso; but he is jong, and if he orders her to come, she
will have to come, because she has no man. He was killed here in
Amlot. Muso sent him here on a dangerous mission. Everyone believes
that he sent him to his death purposely."</p>

<p>I felt myself turning cold. The next question on my lips
withered in my dry mouth. I made two attempts before I could utter
an intelligible sound.</p>

<p>"Who was this man?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He was the man who used to fly over your lines and drop bombs
on you," he replied. "His name was Carson of Venus&mdash;odd
name."</p>

<p>I had asked my last question of that man. I took him out and
turned him over to the soldiers who were to entertain the
prisoners; then I hastened toward the quay. It was already dark,
and the street I chose was not well lighted. That was the reason I
chose it. I had almost reached the quay, when I ran into a
detachment of the Zani Guard in command of an officer. The latter
hailed me from the opposite side of the street; then he crossed
toward me, leaving his detachment behind.</p>

<p>"I thought I recognized you," he said. It was Mantar. "I have an
order for your arrest. They are scouring the city for you."</p>

<p>"I have been in my quarters. Why didn't they look there?"</p>

<p>"Torko said you had gone fishing."</p>

<p>"Why am I being arrested?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They think you are a Sanaran spy. A prisoner named Horjan
informed on you. He said he found you hiding in his house just the
day before you applied for a commission in the Guard."</p>

<p>"But Zerka?" I asked. "Won't they suspicion her? It was she who
sponsored me."</p>

<p>"I had thought of that," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do with me?" I asked. "Are you
going to turn me in?"</p>

<p>"I wish you would tell me the truth," he said. "I am your
friend; and if what Zerka and I have suspected for long is true, I
will help you."</p>

<p>I recalled that Zerka had told me I could trust this man
implicitly. I was lost anyway. They had enough against me to
torture and murder me. Here was a straw. I clutched it.</p>

<p>"I am Carson of Venus," I said. "I came here with a message for
Spehon from Muso. It was stolen from me."</p>

<p>"Where were you going when I stopped you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was going back to Sanara, where my friends and my heart are,"
I told him.</p>

<p>"Can you get there?"</p>

<p>"I think I can."</p>

<p>"Then go. It is fortunate for you that none of my detail knew
Vodo by sight. Good luck!" He turned and crossed the street, and I
went on toward the quay. I heard him say to his kardogan. "He says
that Vodo is in his quarters at the barracks. We shall go
there."</p>

<p>I reached the quay without further incident, and found the same
boat I had used for fishing earlier in the day and on several other
occasions. It was a small boat with a single sail, scarcely more
than a canoe. As I put off, I heard the sound of running feet along
the quay; and then I saw men approaching.</p>

<p>A voice cried, "Stop! Come back here!" but I set my sail and got
under way; then I heard the staccato br-r-r of r-rays, and a voice
crying, "Come back here, Vodo! You can't get away."</p>

<p>For reply I drew my own pistol and fired back at them. I knew
that that would disconcert their aim and give me a better chance to
escape with my life. Long after I could no longer see them, they
stood there firing out into the night.</p>

<p>I thought of Mintep with regret, but there was something far
more precious at stake than his life or that of any man. I cursed
Muso for his duplicity, and prayed that I might reach Sanara in
time. If I did not, I could at least kill him; and that I promised
to do.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the sound of a launch behind me, and knew that
I was being pursued. Inside the harbor the breeze was light and
fitful. If I couldn't reach the open sea ahead of my pursuers, I
should have to depend upon eluding them in the darkness. In this I
might be successful, or I might not. I couldn't hope to outdistance
a launch even with a good wind, and about my only hope was to
escape detection until I was able to discern from the sound of the
launch in which direction they were searching for me. I felt that
they would naturally assume that I would head northeast up the
coast in the direction of Sanara, whereas my destination lay
southwest&mdash;the little island where I had grounded my ship. Nor
was I mistaken, for presently I heard the sound of the launch
receding to my left; and I knew that it was making for the open sea
by way of the easterly side of the harbor's mouth. With a sigh of
relief, I kept to my course; and presently rounded the headland at
the west side of the harbor and turned into the open sea. The
offshore breeze was no better than that which I had had in the
harbor, but I continued to hug the shore because I had one last
duty to perform in Amlot before I continued on my way.</p>

<p>I owed much to Zerka, and I could not leave without warning her
of the danger which threatened her. I knew where her palace was
situated on the shore of the ocean with its gardens running down to
the water line. It would delay me no more than a few minutes to
stop there and warn her. I felt that I could do no less. The
conditions were ideal&mdash;low tide and an offshore wind.</p>

<p>Silently and smoothly my light craft skimmed the surface of the
water, the faint luminosity of the Amtorian night revealing the
shore line as a black mass dotted with occasional lights that shone
from the windows of the palaces of the rich and powerful. Even in
the semi-darkness, I had no difficulty in locating Zerka's palace.
I ran in as close as I could on the tack I was holding; then
dropped my sail and paddled for the shore. Beaching my craft, I
drew it well up toward the sea wall, where only a very high tide
could have reached it; then I made my way up to the palace.</p>

<p>I knew that I was undergoing considerable risk, for, if Zerka
were under suspicion, as I feared might be the case, she would
doubtless be under surveillance. There might be watchers in the
palace grounds, or even in the palace itself. For all I knew, Zerka
might already be under arrest, for Narvon's dying confession was
not cut off quickly enough to hide from me the identity of the
accomplice he had almost named. Of course, I had already been
suspicious of the truth. I did not think that the Zanis were, and
so there was a possibility that they had not connected Zerka's name
with that which the dying man had almost spoken. In any event, I
must take this chance.</p>

<p>I went directly to the great doors that opened onto the terrace
overlooking the gardens and the sea. On Amtor there are no
doorbells, nor do people knock on doors&mdash;they whistle. Each
individual has his own distinctive notes, sometimes simple,
sometimes elaborate. At entrance doorways there are speaking tubes
into which one whistles, and it was with some perturbation that I
now whistled into the mouthpiece of the tube at the great doors of
the toganja's palace.</p>

<p>I waited for several minutes. I heard no sound within the
building. The silence was ominous. I was, nevertheless, about to
repeat my whistle when the door swung partly open, and Zerka
stepped out onto the terrace. Without a word, she took my hand and
hurried me down into the garden where trees and shrubbery cast
black shadows. There was a bench there, and she drew me down on
it.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" she whispered. "They were just here looking for
you. The doors on the avenue had scarcely closed behind them when I
heard your whistle. How did you get here? If you can get away
again, you must leave at once. There are probably spies among my
servants. Oh, why did you come?"</p>

<p>"I came to warn you."</p>

<p>"Warn me? Of what?"</p>

<p>"I saw Narvon tortured," I said.</p>

<p>I felt her stiffen. "And?"</p>

<p>"Mephis was trying to wring the names of his accomplices from
him."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did he speak?" she asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"He said, 'The Toganja'; and died with the beginning of her name
on his lips. I do not know that Mephis suspected, for he had not
seen what I had in the house of Narvon; but I feared that he might
suspect, and so I came here to take you to Sanara with me."</p>

<p>She pressed my hand. "You are a good friend," she said. "I knew
that you would be, and it was first proved to me when you prevented
that kardogan from searching the back room of Narvon's house; now
you have proved it again. Yes, you are a very good friend, Carson
of Venus."</p>

<p>That name on her lips startled me. "How did you know?" I asked.
"When did you find out?"</p>

<p>"The morning after we dined together that first time in the
evening of the day that you entered Amlot."</p>

<p>"But how?" I insisted.</p>

<p>She laughed softly. "We are all suspicious here in Amlot,
suspicious of everyone. We are always searching for new friends,
expecting new enemies. The instant that I saw you in that
restaurant I knew that you were not of Amlot, probably not of
Korva; but if you were of Korva, the chances were excellent that
you were a spy from Sanara. I had to find out. Oh, how many times I
have laughed when I recalled your stories of Vodaro. Why, you
didn't know the first thing about that country."</p>

<p>"But how did you find out about me?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I sent an emissary to your room in the travellers' house to
search your belongings while you slept. He brought me Muso's
message to Spehon."</p>

<p>"Oh, so that is why that was never used against me," I
exclaimed. "It has had me worried ever since it disappeared, as you
may well imagine."</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't. You have no idea how
careful we have to be."</p>

<p>"You were very careless in going to the house of Narvon," I
said.</p>

<p>"We hadn't the slightest reason to believe that Narvon was
suspected. Now that I know how loyal you are, I don't mind telling
you that we are planning a counterrevolution that will overthrow
the Zanis and restore Kord to the throne."</p>

<p>"That can never be done," I said.</p>

<p>"Why?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Kord is dead."</p>

<p>She was horrified. "You are sure?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I saw Mephis assassinate him." I told her the story
briefly.</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly. "There is so much less to fight for
now," she said. "Muso might easily be as bad as Mephis."</p>

<p>"Muso is a traitor to his own country," I said. "That message I
brought you proves it clearly. I wish that I had it now to take
back to Sanara with me. The army would rise against him; and with
Kord dead, the people would rally around the man they love and make
him jong."</p>

<p>"Who is that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Taman," I said.</p>

<p>"Taman! But Taman is dead."</p>

<p>"Taman dead? How do you know?" My heart sank at the thought.
Duare and I would have no powerful friend in Sanara.</p>

<p>"We heard some time ago from a captured Sanaran officer that
Muso had sent him to Amlot on a dangerous mission and that he had
never returned to Sanara. It was a foregone conclusion that he must
be dead."</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief. "He was returned safely to Sanara
before I left there; and unless he has been killed since I came to
Amlot, he is still alive."</p>

<p>"You shall have the message," she said. "I kept it. But how do
you expect to escape from Amlot and get back through the Zani lines
in safety?"</p>

<p>"Do you forget that Carson of Venus is the <i>mistal</i> that
flies over Zani troops and drops bombs on them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"But the thing you fly in? You haven't that here?"</p>

<p>"It is not far away. I am praying that nothing has happened to
it. That was the chance I had to take."</p>

<p>"You are so lucky that I am sure you will find it just as you
left it. And, speaking of luck, how in the world did you ever get
out of the city, with the entire Zani Guard looking for you? They
are absolutely turning the city inside out, I am told."</p>

<p>"I was stopped by a detachment of the Guard on my way to the
quay. Fortunately for me, it was commanded by Mantar. He is a good
friend, thanks to you."</p>

<p>"He is one of us," she said.</p>

<p>"I suspected you both almost from the first, notwithstanding
your Maltu Mephises and your Zani salutes."</p>

<p>"I was so sure of you that I was a little freer than usual.
Somehow, I knew you were all right&mdash;you just couldn't have
been a Zani at heart."</p>

<p>"We shouldn't be sitting here talking," I told her. "Go get
Muso's message and a few of your belongings, and we'll be on our
way to Sanara."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I wish that I might," she said, "but I have
a duty to perform before I leave Amlot."</p>

<p>"There is nothing more important than saving your life," I
insisted.</p>

<p>"There is something more important to me than my life," she
replied. "I am going to tell you what it is and why I must stay and
what I am going to do&mdash;something that I have shared with only
Mantar before. Mantar and my man were the closest of friends. They
were officers in the same regiment of The Jong's Guard. When Mephis
formed the Zani Party during the last disastrous war, my man was
one of his bitterest foes. It was in the last battle of the war
that my man was supposed to have been killed. His body was never
found. But he was not killed in battle. A private soldier, who had
been closely attached to Mantar, saw my man die; and he told Mantar
the story of his end. He was tortured and murdered by a band of
Zanis under direction of Mephis. When I learned this, I swore to
kill Mephis; but I wished to wait until my act would be of service
to my country. We are preparing for a sudden stroke at Zani power.
When our forces are ready, the violent death of Mephis would throw
the Zanis into at least temporary demoralization. I must be here to
see that he dies a violent death at the proper time."</p>

<p>"But suppose you are suspected now and arrested? You can't carry
out your plan then."</p>

<p>"If I am arrested, I shall still carry out my plan to kill
Mephis," she said. "I shall certainly be taken before him for
questioning and probably for torture; then I shall kill him. You
must go now. I'll fetch Muso's message. Just a moment," and she was
gone.</p>

<p>I felt a wave of melancholy surge through me as I sat there
waiting for her to return. I knew that I should never see her
again, for she was going to certain death, even if she succeeded in
destroying Mephis. She was so beautiful and fine, such a loyal
friend&mdash;it was tragic that she must die.</p>

<p>Presently she came back with Muso's message. "Here it is," she
said. "I hope it puts Taman on the throne. I wish that I were to
live to see that day."</p>

<p>Then she, too, knew that she would not! I think I loathed Mephis
more that instant than I ever had before&mdash;which is saying
something which no superlative can express.</p>

<p>"I am coming back, Zerka," I said. "Perhaps I can aid you in the
overthrow of the Zanis. A few bombs at the psychological moment
might help your cause. Or maybe you will have changed your mind and
decided to come away with me. Now listen carefully. Southwest of
Amlot is a flat-topped mountain."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it is called Borsan."</p>

<p>"Two rivers join just this side of it, and in the fork of the
rivers there is a farm. It belongs to a man named Lodas."</p>

<p>"I know him well," she said. "He is one of us&mdash;a loyal
soul."</p>

<p>"When I come back I shall circle over the farm of Lodas," I
explained. "If I see a smoke-fire lighted in one of his fields, I
shall know that I am to land for a message from you&mdash;or,
better still, for you, I hope. If I see no smoke, I shall fly on to
Amlot and circle the city. That will throw the city into a turmoil,
I am sure. You will hear of it and see me. If you are alive, you
will make one smoke-fire on your beach, here. If you would like to
have me bomb the palace and the barracks, you will light two
smoke-fires. If I see no smoke-fire, I shall know that you are
dead; and then I shall bomb hell out of the Zanis."</p>

<p>"What is <i>hell</i>?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That is something peculiar to Earthmen," I laughed. "And now I
must be going. Goodby, Zerka." I touched her hand with my lips.</p>

<p>"Goodby, Carson of Venus," she said. "I hope that you do come
back and bomb hell out of the Zanis."</p>

<h2><a id="ch13" name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; DANGER IN SANARA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS I put out to sea from the beach in front of the
palace of the Toganja Zerka, my mind was filled with such emotions
as beggar description. My beloved Duare was in grave danger in
Sanara&mdash;the greatest danger being that she might be forced to
die by her own hand, which I knew she would do rather than mate
with Muso. And in Amlot I was leaving behind a good friend who was
in equal danger, and in the Prison of Death lay Duare's father. If
ever a man's mind was beset by apprehension of dire import, it was
mine that night.</p>

<p>Standing out from shore, I caught a brisker breeze, which
finally veered into the northeast and drove me along at a spanking
pace. As the wind rose, so did the seas, until I began to have
doubts as to the ability of my frail craft to weather them. It was
an almost following wind, and constantly I was expecting to be
engulfed by the growing seas that pursued me. The lightness of my
boat, however, kept me just out of danger from that cause; but
there was always the possibility of striking a submerged rock or a
reef in this sea of which I knew nothing. I was compelled to stay
always too close to land for safety, lest I pass my little island
without recognizing it as such; but at last I saw it; and, without
a great deal of difficulty, made the little cove where I had
previously been taken off by Lodas.</p>

<p>The fear that now assailed me was as to the safety of my ship.
Would I find it where I had left it? What if some prowling
fishermen had discovered it? I thought of a dozen reasons why it
should be missing or destroyed as I drew my canoe safely out of the
water and hastened across the island toward the spot where I had
fastened the anotar down. At last I saw it dimly through the night,
and then I was beside it. The reaction and the relief left me weak
for a moment, as I realized that the ship was just as I had left
it.</p>

<p>Casting off the ropes and throwing them into the rear cockpit, I
taxied out into open meadow that formed the greater part of the
island. A moment later I was in the air and heading straight for
Sanara. I saw lights in Lodas's cottage as I sped past, and a
moment later the lights of Amlot shone on my right. After that I
saw no sign of life until the campfires of the Zani army flickered
below me; and then, ahead, I could see the glow of the lights of
Sanara. My Duare was there! In a few minutes I should be holding
her in my arms again. I tried to open the throttle wider, only to
find that it was open as far as it would go&mdash;I had been
running the engine at maximum all the way from Amlot without
realizing it; but I had made good time. I had left the Zani
barracks and started for the quay about the 20th hour, it was now
approaching only the 26th hour. In six Amtorian hours, which are
equivalent to four Earth hours, I had made my escape from Amlot,
sailed about ten miles along the coast, and flown to Sanara. That
little gale had helped me on my way, and my light craft had
practically flown the distance.</p>

<p>I approached Sanara without lights and at a high altitude; then
I spiralled down from directly above the landing field that I had
previously used. I knew every bump and depression in it, so many
times had I used it. With my noiseless motor, I came in as quietly
as a falling leaf; and taxied to the hangar that Muso had had built
for me. The field was deserted; and the hour being late and few
people on the streets in this district, I believe that no one saw
my ship or saw me land. That was as I wished it, for I wanted to
see Duare and Taman before I talked with anyone else.</p>

<p>I kept my flying helmet on to hide my Zani haircut, hoped that
no one would notice my Zani trappings, and set out on foot in the
direction of Taman's palace. As I approached it, I saw Muso's
palace across the avenue brilliant with a thousand lights. Many
gorgeously trapped gantors were waiting patiently along both sides
of the avenue. Strains of music floated out into the night from the
interior of the palace. I could also hear the murmur of many
voices. It was evident that Muso was entertaining.</p>

<p>One of the sentries in front of Taman's palace stepped up to me
as I stopped at the entrance.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> want?" he demanded. I guess putting a man in
front of a door anywhere in the universe must do something to him.
The tremendous responsibility implicit in such a cosmic assignment
seems to remove all responsibility for good manners. I have seldom
known it to fail. When it does, they must immediately transfer the
man to some other form of activity.</p>

<p>"I want to go in," I said; "I am Carson of Venus."</p>

<p>The fellow stepped back as though he had seen a ghost, as I
imagine that he thought he had, for a moment.</p>

<p>"Carson of Venus!" he exclaimed. "We thought you were dead. Muso
issued a proclamation of mourning for you. You must be dead."</p>

<p>"I am not, and I want to go in and see my wife and Taman."</p>

<p>"They are not there," he said.</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Across the street." He looked a bit uncomfortable as he said
it, or was it my imagination?</p>

<p>"Then I'll go over there," I said.</p>

<p>"I do not think Muso will be glad to see you," opined the
sentry; but I had already started, and he did not attempt to detain
me.</p>

<p>Once again, at Muso's palace, I was stopped by a sentry. He
wouldn't believe that I was Carson of Venus, and was going to have
me carted off to jail. But I finally prevailed on him, by means of
a small bribe, to call an officer. He who came, I had known quite
well and had liked. I had taken him up in my ship a number of
times, and we were good friends. When he recognized me, he looked
mighty uncomfortable. I laid a hand on his arm, reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Please don't be embarrassed," I begged. "I have heard. Am I in
time?"</p>

<p>"Thank the good fates, you are," he replied. "It was to be
announced at the 27th hour this night. It is almost that now."</p>

<p>"And I may go in?" I asked, out of courtesy; for I intended
going in, if I had to kill someone doing it.</p>

<p>"I would be the last man to stop you," he said, "even if I lost
my head for it."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said, and ran up the broad stairway beyond the
ornate portals.</p>

<p>I could see down the center corridor to the great throne-room.
It was packed with the aristocracy of Sanara. I knew that whatever
of interest was taking place in the palace was taking place there;
so I hurried along the corridor toward the doorway. Over the heads
of the assembly I could see Muso standing on a dais beside the
throne. He was speaking.</p>

<p>"A jong," he was saying, "must take his woman before the eyes of
all men; so that all may know whom to honor as their vadjong. Being
without a woman, I have chosen to honor one whose man gave his life
in the service of Korva and myself. It is the highest award of
merit that I can confer upon his memory."</p>

<p>I was elbowing my way through the crowd to the discomfiture of
ribs and toes and to the accompaniment of scowls and muttered
imprecations. Finally an officer seized me by the shoulder and
swung me around facing him. When he saw who I was, his eyes went
wide; and then a wry smile twisted his lips as he let me go and
gave me a push forward. As I came in full view of the dais, I saw
Duare sitting on a low bench, her eyes staring straight ahead, that
noble little head of hers unbowed. A strapping warrior of the
jong's guard sat on either side of her. That was the only reason
she was there.</p>

<p>"And now," said Muso, "lives there any man who says I may not
take Duare, Janjong of Vepaja, to be my queen?"</p>

<p>"There does," I said in a loud voice, stepping forward. Duare
looked quickly down at me; then, before the warriors could prevent,
she had leaped to the floor and flung herself into my arms.</p>

<p>Muso stood there with his mouth open, his arms hanging limply at
his side. If the saying about having the starch taken out of one
was ever appropriate, it was then. Here was a situation with which
it seemed impossible for him to cope. Here was a problem without a
solution. Finally he forced a sickly smile.</p>

<p>"I thought you were dead," he said. "This is indeed a happy
moment."</p>

<p>I just looked at him, and made no reply. The silence in the room
was deathlike. It must have lasted for a full minute, which is a
very long time under such circumstances; then someone started for
the doorway, and like a funeral procession the guests passed out. I
felt a hand on my arm, and turned to see whose it was. It was
Taman's. Jahara was at his side. She looked both frightened and
pleased.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "you had better get out of here."</p>

<p>As we reached the doorway, I turned and looked back. Muso was
still standing there beside his throne like one in a trance. We
left the jong's palace and crossed directly to Taman's, nor did any
of us breathe freely until we were seated in Jahara's boudoir.</p>

<p>"You will have to leave Sanara at once," said
Taman&mdash;"tonight, if possible."</p>

<p>"I don't want to leave Sanara," I said. "At last Duare and I
have found a place where we might live in peace and happiness. I
shall not let one man drive me out."</p>

<p>"But you cannot fight the jong," he said; "and until Kord is
restored, Muso is jong."</p>

<p>"I think I can," I said, "and I think I can create a new jong.
Kord is dead."</p>

<p>"Kord dead? How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I saw Mephis kill him," and then I told them the story of the
assassination of the Jong of Korva.</p>

<p>"And the new jong?" asked Jahara. "Who is he to be?"</p>

<p>"Taman," I said.</p>

<p>Taman shook his head. "That cannot be. I owe allegiance to Muso,
if Kord be dead."</p>

<p>"Even if he were proved to be a traitor to his people?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No, not in that event, of course; but Muso is no traitor to the
people of Korva."</p>

<p>"How many high officers of the army and officials of the
government would feel as you do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"All but a few who owe everything to Muso," he replied.</p>

<p>"How many of them can you gather here tonight," I asked.</p>

<p>"Twenty to thirty of the most important," he said.</p>

<p>"Will you do it? I ask you to trust me. It will be for the best
good of Korva&mdash;the country that I would wish to make my
own."</p>

<p>He summoned several aides and gave instructions; then Taman,
Jahara, and Duare settled down to listen to the story of my
adventures in Amlot while we awaited the coming of the invited
guests. I did not tell Duare that I had found her father a prisoner
in a Zani prison until after we were alone together the next
morning after the guests had left. She was very brave about it, and
was confident that I would rescue him eventually.</p>

<p>At last the great men commenced to arrive. There were generals
and councilors of state and great nobles of the realm, the flower
of Korvan aristocracy that had escaped the Zani massacres. We met
in the large audience chamber and were seated at a great table that
had been brought into the room for the occasion. Taman was seated
at the head of the table; I, being without nobility or rank, sat at
the lower end. When all were seated, Taman rose.</p>

<p>"You all know Carson of Venus and what he has done for Sanara,"
he said. "He has asked me to call you together at this late hour
because a national emergency exists. I trust him, and have taken
his word that such is the case. I feel that we should listen to
him. Are you all agreed?"</p>

<p>Thirty heads nodded gravely; then Taman turned to me. "You may
speak, Carson of Venus," he said; "but you must have proof of what
you have insinuated to me, for though you are my friend, my first
duty is to my jong. Do not forget that. Proceed."</p>

<p>"Let me put a hypothetical question to you gentlemen before I
lay my information before you," I commenced. "If it were proved
beyond doubt that your jong had sought to conspire with the enemy
to cause the defeat of the forces holding Sanara and turn the city
over to the Zanis at a price, would you feel that you were relieved
of your oaths of allegiance to him and be warranted in replacing
him with one of royal blood in whom you had the utmost
confidence?"</p>

<p>Many a face was clouded by a resentful scowl. "You are
suggesting a grievous charge," said a great general.</p>

<p>"I am asking you a hypothetical question," I replied. "I have
made no charge. Do you care to answer?"</p>

<p>"There is no question as to what I should do," said the general,
"if such an emergency confronted me. I should be the first to turn
against any jong who did such a traitorous thing as that, but that
is something that no jong of Korva would do."</p>

<p>"And you other gentlemen?" I asked.</p>

<p>Without exception they all concurred in the sentiments of the
general.</p>

<p>"Then I may tell you that such an emergency exists," I said. "I
shall shock you by my disclosures, but I must have your assurance
that you will hear me through and consider impartially the evidence
I have to offer."</p>

<p>"I can assure you that we shall," said Taman.</p>

<p>"Muso, swearing me to secrecy, sent me to Amlot with a message
for Spehon, Mephis's chief lieutenant. He chose me for two reasons.
One was that he thought I could not read Amtorian, and therefore
could not know what was in the message; and the other you had proof
of in his palace this night&mdash;he wanted my woman. But I can
read Amtorian; and after I got to Amlot, I became suspicious and
read Muso's message to Spehon. In it he offered to open the gates
of Sanara to Zani troops in return for the throne of Korva, and he
agreed to accept Mephis as his advisor and to reward the Zanis. He
also suggested that it would be best if Carson of Venus were
destroyed in Amlot."</p>

<p>"This is preposterous!" cried a great noble. "The man must be
mad to make such charges. They are prompted by jealousy, because
Muso desires his woman."</p>

<p>"They cannot be true," exclaimed another.</p>

<p>"Taman," cried a third, "I demand this man's arrest."</p>

<p>"You are not keeping your promise to me," I reminded them. "Is
this what I am to expect of Korvan nobility? And do you think I am
such a fool as to make charges of this kind without ample evidence
to substantiate them? What would I have to gain? I would be signing
my own death warrant. I may be doing so anyway; but I am doing it
for the only country on Amtor that I can call my own, the one
country in which my princess and I feel that we have a chance to
live happily among friends."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the great general. "I apologize for my
confreres."</p>

<p>"Where are your proofs?" asked Taman.</p>

<p>"Here," I said, and drew Muso's message from my pocket pouch.
"Here, in his own handwriting, Muso convicts himself." I handed the
envelope to Taman. He opened it and read it through carefully to
himself; then he passed it to the man to his right. Thus it passed
around the table, each man reading it carefully. It left them
silent and sober-faced. Even after the last man had read it and
passed it back to Taman, they sat in silence. It was the great
general who spoke first.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt the integrity of this man or his belief in the
duplicity of Muso," he said. "It is sufficient to shake the
confidence of each of us. In addition, he knows that Muso sought
his life. I cannot blame him for anything he may think; I should
think as he does, were I he. But he is not a Korvan by birth. There
is not bred in him the reverence and loyalty to our jongs that is
part of every fiber of our beings. For him, this document is
sufficient proof. As I have said, it would be for me, were I he;
but I am not. I am a Korvan noble, the first general of the jong's
armies; and so I must give Muso the benefit of every doubt. Perhaps
this message was a ruse to lure the Zani troops from some part of
the line, that Muso might order an attack upon that weakened part.
It would have been excellent strategy. Now I suggest that we prove
conclusively whether such was his intent, or whether he did intend
to open the gates to the enemy."</p>

<p>"How may that be done?" asked Taman.</p>

<p>"We shall try to arrange to have the enemy shoot three blue
rockets into the air before the main gates of Sanara on three
successive nights; then wait and see what Muso does."</p>

<p>"But how can we get the enemy to co-operate?" asked another.</p>

<p>"I shall commission Carson of Venus to drop a message behind
their lines, telling them that I should like to hold a parley with
them and asking them, if they are agreeable to the suggestion, to
shoot the blue rockets."</p>

<p>"An excellent suggestion," said Taman.</p>

<p>"But," I objected, "seeing me returned alive, Muso may be
suspicious; for he definitely asked Spehon to have me
destroyed."</p>

<p>"Write a report," said the general, "stating that after you
delivered the message you became fearful and escaped."</p>

<p>"That would certainly arouse Muso's suspicions," said Taman.</p>

<p>"I might tell him the truth," I suggested, "and that is that the
very night I arrived in Amlot the message was stolen from me. The
very fact that I remained there so long should convince Muso that I
had no suspicion of what the note contained."</p>

<p>"I think your idea is the best one," said the general; "but why
did you stay so long in Amlot&mdash;if you could have escaped?"</p>

<p>"I had several reasons," I replied. "I suspected that Mintep,
Jong of Vepaja and father of my princess, was a prisoner there. I
also wanted to gather what information I could for the Sanaran high
command. Lastly, I had to establish myself before I could safely
make an effort to escape. I became an officer in the Zani Guard and
was, for a while, acting governor of The Gap kum Rov."</p>

<p>"And you absorbed some information?"</p>

<p>"Much," I replied. "I have learned that a counterrevolution is
about to be launched, the proponents of which hoped to restore Kord
to his throne."</p>

<p>"You say 'hoped'," commented a noble. "Have they now given up
the idea?"</p>

<p>"Kord is dead," I said.</p>

<p>I might as well have thrown a bomb among them. They leaped to
their feet almost as one man. "Kord dead?" It was the same stunned
reaction that I had seen before.</p>

<p>"But," cried one, "we have heard that rumor often before, but it
has never been substantiated."</p>

<p>"I saw him die," I told them; then I had to go all over that
harrowing episode again.</p>

<p>Well, at last they prepared to go; but before they did I
propounded another question. "And now, gentlemen," I said, "just
who is going to protect my princess and me from Muso? If I am not
mistaken, I stand a good chance of being assassinated the first
time I go on the streets."</p>

<p>"He is right," said the general.</p>

<p>"He should certainly be protected, General Varo," agreed
Taman.</p>

<p>"Well," said Varo, "I know of no safer place for them than where
they are now, under the protection of the man who is next in line
for the throne of Korva, after Muso."</p>

<p>There was a subdued cheer at that, but I was not surprised.
Taman was the most popular man in Sanara. He sat for a moment with
his head bowed, and then he looked up at Varo. His face showed
traces of mental strain; his manner was tinged with
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I wish that I might agree with you in that," he said; "but,
unfortunately, I cannot. As a matter of fact, I believe that my
palace would be the least safe place for Carson of Venus and the
Janjong of Vepaja. During the past ten days three attempts have
been made upon my life&mdash;twice by poison, once by dagger."</p>

<p>The disclosure so shocked the assembled nobles, that, for a
moment, there was deep silence; then Varo spoke.</p>

<p>"Were the scoundrels apprehended?" he asked. "Do you know who
they were?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Taman, "but they were only the instruments of
another."</p>

<p>"And you know whom that may be?" asked a noble.</p>

<p>"I can only surmise," replied Taman. "Unfortunately, my
retainers killed all three before I had an opportunity to question
them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better remain here, then," I said, "as additional
protection for the next jong of Korva."</p>

<p>"No," said Taman. "I appreciate your generosity; but I am well
protected by my own people, and there are more important things for
you to do."</p>

<p>"You may come to my palace," said Varo. "I swear no one shall
take you from there, even if I have to protect you with the entire
army of Sanara."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Muso will unquestionably send for me," I said.
"Should you refuse to give me up, his suspicions would be aroused;
and our entire plan might come to nothing. I think I have a
solution of the problem."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Taman.</p>

<p>"Let Varo prepare his message to the enemy at once. At the same
time I shall write my report to Muso. Get two officers to volunteer
for extra hazardous duty. I shall want them to accompany me. As
soon as Varo's message is ready, Varo can order me out on special
duty. I shall take my princess and the two officers with me, drop
the message behind the enemy lines, and remain away until you shall
have had time to determine Muso's guilt or assure yourselves of his
innocence. When I return above Sanara, liberate one balloon if it
is unsafe for me ever to return to Sanara; liberate two if I am to
return another day for further advice; liberate three if it is safe
for me to land. In the event that I cannot land in safety to
myself, I shall land the two officers the night that I get the
message; and I must have your assurance now that I shall be
permitted to do so and take off again in safety."</p>

<p>"The entire plan is excellent," said Taman. "Please put it in
writing; so that there shall be no misunderstanding of the
signals."</p>

<p>"May I ask why you wish to have two of our officers accompany
you?" asked Varo.</p>

<p>"One of them will have to go with me into Amlot while I attempt
to liberate the Jong of Vepaja from the Gap kum Rov; the other will
remain with my princess and the ship while I am away in Amlot."</p>

<p>"I shall have no difficulty in obtaining volunteers," said Varo.
"Now, if we are to get you away before dawn, we must get to
work."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14" name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; BACK TO AMLOT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AN hour before dawn we left the palace of Taman;
Duare, the two officers who had volunteered to accompany us, and I.
Because of Duare, I felt nervous and uneasy; for we had to leave
the palace in full view of the guards before the palace of Muso,
directly across the avenue; and while the fact that Varo had
furnished us with a strong guard imparted a feeling of greater
security, yet, at the same time, it certainly made us extremely
conspicuous. There were ten military gantors loaded with soldiers,
constituting what, to me, had taken on the proportions of a
pageant; and I can tell you that I breathed a sigh of relief when I
had my party aboard the ship and was taxiing out for the take-off;
and as we soared above the walls of Sanara and out across open
country, I was happier than I had been for many days. Once again I
was free, and I had Duare with me.</p>

<p>I had put Ulan and Legan, the two officers, in the cabin. Duare
sat beside me, and there was a basket of small bombs in each
cockpit. The ship was more heavily laden than it had ever before
been, but that had seemed to make no appreciable difference in the
take-off, nor could I see that she handled differently in flight.
We had determined in Havatoo, while designing her, that she would
easily lift a load of fifteen hundred pounds; so I had had little
doubt that she would have no trouble with the approximately
thousand-pound load that she was now carrying.</p>

<p>I flew slowly toward the enemy camp, killing time until daylight
should have come. Ulan and Legan were thrilled beyond words, for
this was the first flight either of them had taken; while Duare and
I were just content to be together again, holding hands like a
couple of kids.</p>

<p>I had hurriedly contrived a tiny parachute before leaving
Taman's palace. It consisted of a square of very light fabric woven
from the web of a small cousin of the targo, a giant spider that
inhabits the mile-high trees that grow in many parts of Amtor; and
which is so sheer as to be almost invisible, yet quite strong. To
the four corners of this square piece I had tied strings, and to
the ends of these strings I had attached the leather envelope which
bore Varo's message to the enemy.</p>

<p>Dawn was just breaking as we flew over the Zani camp. An alert
sentry must have sighted us, for I distinctly heard a shout; and
almost immediately saw men running from the shelters which lined
the streets of the camp. I continued to circle above them, well out
of range of r-rays, until it was entirely light; then, estimating
the velocity of the wind, I flew a little way beyond the windward
side of the camp and tossed the message overboard. The little
parachute opened immediately and floated gracefully down toward the
camp. I could see thousands of men by now standing with upturned
faces, watching it. They must have thought that it was some new
engine of destruction, for when it came close to the ground near
the center of the camp, they scattered like sheep. I continued to
circle until I saw a brave soul advance to where the message lay
and pick it up. Then I dipped a wing and flew away.</p>

<p>The trip to the island was uneventful. I circled Lodas's house
for quite some time, but no smoke signal was lighted; then I
dropped over to the island and landed. The country, except in the
vicinity of the cities, is strangely deserted in every part of
Amtor that I have visited. Between Sanara and the farm of Lodas we
had not seen a sign of human life except that in the camp of the
Zanis, which, of course, was no permanent habitation. Few farmers
have the temerity that Lodas displayed in locating a farm so far
from civilization, and open constantly to the danger of attack by
some of the fearsome creatures which roam the plains and forests of
Venus. It was, however, the very fact that few men traversed these
interurban wildernesses that had rendered my little island so safe
a place to hide the anotar and also the little craft that had
brought me there from Amlot and which I hoped would bear me back to
the Zani stronghold.</p>

<p>As we came in to land, I saw my boat lying where I had dragged
it; and one more cause of anxiety was removed. Now I had only to
wait for darkness and the proper moment to launch my attempt to
rescue Mintep. I told Legan that he was to remain with Duare in the
unlikely event that she should need protection, and I also
instructed her to take to the air if any danger threatened them.
Duare was by now an efficient pilot. I had taken her with me on
many of my flights over the enemy lines, and had had her practice
landings and take-offs on the surface of a dry lake I had
discovered some fifty miles west of Sanara. I had also let her take
off and land at the racing field in Sanara. She was quite competent
to land anywhere that conditions were reasonably favorable. I drew
a rough map of Amlot for her, marking the location of the palace
and the barracks; and told her that if I had not returned to the
island by dawn she and Legan were to fly along the coast toward
Amlot, keeping a close lookout for my boat; and if they did not see
me, they were to fly over the city and drop bombs on the palace and
the barracks until they saw me put out into the harbor. I was sure
they would be able to identify me from the air because of my flying
helmet.</p>

<p>It had taken me about three Amtorian hours to sail from Amlot to
the island. Allowing eight hours for the round trip, including the
time it might take to get into the Gap kum Rov and take Mintep out,
I estimated that I should leave the Island about the 29th hour in
order to get back by dawn. In the event that Ulan and I never
returned, Duare was to take Legan back to Sanara; and if three
balloons were sent up, indicating that it was safe to land, she
should do so; for I felt that she would be safer there than
anywhere else. If the signal were a discouraging one, she might try
to reach Vepaja; but that would be almost suicidal, since she could
not approach anywhere near Kooaad, her city, in the ship; and the
dangers she would encounter on the ground were far too numerous and
terrible to render it at all likely that she would survive.</p>

<p>"Do not even think of anything so terrible as that you may not
return from Amlot," she begged. "If you do not, it will make no
difference where I go, for I shall not live. I do not care to live
unless I have you, Carson."</p>

<p>Ulan and Legan were on the ground inspecting the boat; so I took
her in my arms and kissed her, and told her that I would come
back.</p>

<p>"For no one but your father would I go to Amlot and risk your
life as well as my own," I said.</p>

<p>"I wish you did not have to go, Carson. What a strange
retribution it would be if, for the sake of the throne I gave up
for you, I should lose you. It would not be just retribution,
though&mdash;it would be wicked."</p>

<p>"You'll not lose me, dear," I assured her, "unless your father
takes you away from me."</p>

<p>"He can't do that now. Even though he is my father and my jong,
I should disobey him if he sought to."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he's going to be&mdash;well, disagreeable about the
matter," I suggested. "You know how shocked you were at the very
thought of even talking to me. When I told you I loved you, you
wanted to knife me; and you really felt that I deserved death. How
do you suppose he's going to feel about it when he finds that you
are irrevocably mine? He'll want to kill me."</p>

<p>"When are you going to tell him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"After I get him here on the island. I'm afraid he'd upset the
boat if I told him at sea."</p>

<p>She shook her head dubiously. "I don't know," she said&mdash;"I
can't imagine how he'll take it. He is a very proud jong, steeped
in the traditions of a royal family that extends back into
prehistoric times; and, Carson, he does not know you as I do. If he
did, he would be glad that his daughter belonged to such as you. Do
you know, Carson, he may even kill me. Even though you think you
know, yet you have no conception of the taboos and interdictions
that dictate the attitude of all toward the sacred person of the
virgin daughter of a jong. There is nothing in your life with which
I may compare it. There is nothing that you so reverence and hold
so sacred."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is, Duare," I said.</p>

<p>"What?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>"Fool!" she said, laughing. "But you're a dear fool, and I know
that you believe what you said."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The day drew to a close and the night wore on. Ulan and Legan
amused themselves by fishing; and we built a fire and cooked what
they caught, enjoying an unexpectedly excellent meal. I cut a
slender sapling about twenty feet long and stowed it in the boat.
As the 29th hour approached, I kissed Duare goodby. She clung to me
for a long time. I know she thought it was the last time she should
ever see me. Then Ulan and I embarked. A good breeze was blowing;
and we skimmed away into the darkness, bound for Amlot.</p>

<p>Did you ever reach into an inside pocket time after time to
assure and reassure yourself that you had not forgotten the theater
tickets that you knew were there? Well, that's the way I kept
feeling in my pocket pouch for the duplicate master key to the
cells of The Prison of Death I had had made just before I left
Amlot. And not without reason was I thus solicitous&mdash;without
that key, not even an act of God could have gotten Mintep's cell
door unlocked without the co-operation of Torko; and somehow I
couldn't see Torko co-operating.</p>

<p>We rounded the headland and drew into the harbor of Amlot just
before the 3rd hour. Running before the wind, we approached the
little island of horror where loomed the Gap kum Rov. As we came
closer to shore I lowered the sail, lest its white expanse be seen
by some watchful Zani eye, and paddled quietly in beneath those
frowning walls. Feeling my way cautiously along the cold, damp
stones, I came at last to that which I sought&mdash;the opening of
the chute through which the ashes of burned men are discharged into
the bay. Ulan and I spoke no word, as all the way from the island I
had been coaching him on what he was to do; so that it would be
unnecessary for us to speak in other than an emergency. Once more I
felt to learn if I still had the key; then, as Ulan held the boat
in position beneath the mouth of the chute, I carefully inserted
the pole I had prepared and pushed it up its full length, letting
the lower end rest on the bottom of the boat. This done, I
proceeded to climb up the pole into the chute. Disturbed by the
pole and my body brushing the sides of the chute, the ashes of a
thousand dead men drifted gently down upon me.</p>

<p>When I reached the top of the pole, I raised one hand directly
over my head. To my vast relief, it came in contact with the trap
door just a few inches above me. I pushed up, and raised it far
enough so that I could grasp the sill with my fingers; then
remained quiet, listening. Only the moans and groans of the
prisoners came to my ears. There was no alarm. So far, none had
heard me. Pulling myself up, I raised the door with my head and
shoulders until I could fall forward with the upper half of my body
on the floor of the furnace room. A moment later I stood erect.</p>

<p>A few steps brought me to the dimly lighted corridor. I knew
exactly where Mintep's cell lay, and walked directly to it.
Whatever I was to do must be done quickly and silently. Pressing my
face to the bars, I looked in. I thought I saw a figure in the far
corner, a figure huddled on the floor. I inserted the key in the
lock and turned it. The door swung in. I crossed and kneeled beside
the figure, listening. By the breathing, I knew that the man slept.
I shook him lightly by the shoulder, and as he stirred I cautioned
him to silence.</p>

<p>"Are you Mintep?" I asked, fearful that he might have been taken
to his death and another placed in his cell since I had located it.
I had not served in this prison without having learned how quickly
changes might come, how unexpectedly one man might be rubbed out to
make place for another. I held my breath waiting for his reply. At
last he spoke.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Never mind that," I snapped a little irritably. "Are you
Mintep?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"Come with me quietly. Duare is waiting for you."</p>

<p>That was enough. Like a new man, he came to his feet and
followed me stealthily to the furnace room, though I could see that
he staggered a little from weakness. It was no small job getting
him down that pole. He was too weak to climb down himself; so I had
practically to carry him. But at last we were in the boat. I
lowered the pole into the water and pushed off. We paddled all the
way to the mouth of the harbor, as otherwise we would have had to
tack back and forth several times to have made it; and I was afraid
the sail might attract attention from the shore. Had it, a launch
must certainly have overhauled us before we could get out into the
open sea. But at last we turned the headland, and Ulan hoisted the
sail.</p>

<p>Then it was that I thought to do a very foolish thing. Once I
had stopped and seen Zerka while I was escaping from Amlot. It had
seemed very simple and quite safe. Conditions of tide and wind were
again favorable. Why not do it again? I might obtain information
that would be of value to my friends at Sanara. I told Ulan and
Mintep what I intended doing. It was not for them to question my
judgment; so they concurred. It was the first time that we had
dared speak, so fearful had we been of discovery, knowing, as we
did, how the sound of voices carries over water.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Mintep.</p>

<p>"Do you recall the prison officer who sang a song to you?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"But he was a Zani," said Mintep.</p>

<p>"Only posing as a Zani to find you," I told him.</p>

<p>"But who are you?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"For some time I was a guest-prisoner in your palace at Kooaad,"
I said. "I am the stranger called Carson."</p>

<p>"Carson!" he exclaimed. "When Kamlot returned to Kooaad, he told
me of all that you had done to serve my daughter, Duare. And now
you say she is safe and waiting for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in two or three hours you shall see her."</p>

<p>"And you have done all this for me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For Duare," I said, simply.</p>

<p>He made no comment on the correction, and we sailed on in
silence again until we came opposite the palace of Zerka; then I
turned the boat's nose in toward shore. Alas, what stupid things
one does! The palace was lighted much as I had last seen
it&mdash;all seemed quiet and peaceful. I hoped Zerka would be
alone. I wanted only a few swift words with her.</p>

<p>"Stay in the boat," I told Ulan, "and be ready to push off on an
instant's notice;" then I walked up the garden to the great doors
that open onto the terrace. I paused and listened, but I could hear
nothing; then I whistled&mdash;and waited. I did not have to wait
long. I heard the sound of men running, but the sounds did not come
from the house&mdash;they came from the garden behind me. I
wheeled, and in the light from the palace windows I saw a dozen
Zani Guardsmen running toward me.</p>

<p>"Shove off, Ulan!" I cried at the top of my voice. "Shove off,
and take Mintep to Duare! I command it!" Then they were upon
me.</p>

<p>At the sound of my voice the great doors swung open, and I saw
more Zani uniforms in the great hall of the palace of the Toganja
Zerka. They dragged me in, and when I was recognized a sullen
murmur filled the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15" name="ch15">XV. &mdash; TRAGIC ERROR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THERE is nothing more annoying than to commit an
egregious error of judgment and have no one but yourself upon whom
to blame it. As I was dragged into that room, I was annoyed. I was
more than annoyed&mdash;I was frightened; for I saw certain death
staring me in the face. And not death alone&mdash;for I remembered
Narvon. I wondered if I would go to pieces, too.</p>

<p>And there was some reason for my apprehension, for besides a
company of Zani Guardsmen and officers, there were a number of the
great men of Zanism&mdash;there were even Mephis and Spehon
themselves. And to one side, their wrists manacled, stood Zerka and
Mantar. There was an expression almost of anguish in Zerka's eyes
as they met mine. Mantar shook his head sadly, as though to say,
"You poor fool, why did you stick your head into the noose
again?"</p>

<p>"So you came back!" rasped Mephis. "Don't you think that was a
little unwise, a little stupid?"</p>

<p>"Let us say unfortunate, Mephis," I replied. "Unfortunate for
you."</p>

<p>"Why unfortunate for me?" he demanded, almost angrily. I could
see that he was nervous. I knew that he was always fearful.</p>

<p>"Unfortunate, because you would like to kill me; but if you
do&mdash;if you harm me in any way or harm the Toganja Zerka or
Mantar&mdash;you shall die shortly after dawn."</p>

<p>"You dare threaten <i>me</i>?" he roared. "You stinking mistal!
You dare threaten the great Mephis? Off to the Gap kum Rov with
him!&mdash;with all of them! Let Torko do his worst with them. I
want to see them writhe. I want to hear them scream."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Mephis," I advised him. "I wasn't threatening
you. I was merely stating facts. I know what I'm talking about, for
I have given orders that I know will be carried out if I am not
safely out of Amlot shortly after dawn."</p>

<p>"You lie!" he almost screamed.</p>

<p>I shrugged. "If I were you, though, I'd give instructions that
none of us is to be tortured or harmed in any way until at least
the third hour tomorrow&mdash;and be sure to have a boat ready that
I and my friends can sail away in after you have released us."</p>

<p>"I shall never release you," he said; but nevertheless he gave
instructions that we were not to be tortured or harmed until he
gave further orders.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
And so Zerka and Mantar and I were dragged away to the Gap kum Rov.
They didn't abuse us, and they even took the manacles off Zerka and
Mantar. They put us all together in a cell on the second floor,
which surprised me; as the basement was reserved for Mephis's
special hates as well as prisoners concerning whose incarceration
he would rather not have too much known.</p>

<p>"Why did you do such a foolish thing as to come back?" asked
Zerka, after we had been left alone.</p>

<p>"And right after I risked my life to get you out of here," said
Mantar, laughingly.</p>

<p>"Well," I explained, "I wanted to see Zerka and find out if
there is any way in which the loyal forces at Sanara may co-operate
with you."</p>

<p>"They could," she said, "but now they'll never know. We need
more weapons&mdash;you might have brought them in that flying boat
you have told me about."</p>

<p>"I may yet," I assured her.</p>

<p>"Have you gone crazy?" she demanded. "Don't you know, regardless
of that courageous bluff you tried to pull, that we are all
lost&mdash;that we shall be tortured and killed, probably
today."</p>

<p>"No," I said. "I know we may, but not that we shall. I was
pulling no bluff. I meant what I said. But tell me, what caused
them to arrest you and Mantar?"</p>

<p>"It was the culmination of growing suspicion on the part of
Spehon," explained Zerka. "My friendship for you had something to
do with it; and after Horjan informed on you and you escaped from
the city, Spehon, in checking over all your connections, recalled
this friendship and also the fact that Mantar and you were close
friends and that Mantar was my friend. One of the soldiers in the
detail that Mantar commanded the evening that he met you and let
you proceed to the quay reported to Spehon that he thought your
description, which he heard after he returned to the barracks,
fitted the man with whom Mantar had talked. Then, these things
having suggested my connection with you, Spehon recalled Narvon's
last words&mdash;the same words that assured you that I was one of
those who conspired with Narvon against the Zanis. So, all in all,
they had a much clearer case against me than the Zanis ordinarily
require; but Mephis would not believe that I had conspired against
him. He is such an egotistical fool that he thought that my
affection for him assured my loyalty."</p>

<p>"I was, until recently, in a quandary as to your exact
sentiments and your loyalties," I said. "I was told that you were
high in the esteem of Mephis, that you were the author of the
'Maltu Mephis!' gesture of adulation, that it was you who suggested
having citizens stand on their heads while they cheered Mephis,
that it was your idea to have <i>The Life of Our Beloved Mephis</i>
run continuously in all theaters, and to have Zani Guardsmen annoy
and assault citizens continually."</p>

<p>Zerka laughed. "You were correctly informed," she said. "I was
the instigator of those and other schemes for making Zanism
obnoxious and ridiculous in the eyes of the citizens of Amlot; so
that it might be easier to recruit members for our
counterrevolution. So stupidly egotistical are the chief Zanis,
they will swallow almost any form of flattery, however ridiculous
and insincere it may be."</p>

<p>While we were talking, Torko came stamping up the stairs to our
cell. He had been absent from the prison when we were brought in.
He wore one of his most fearsome frowns, but I could see he was
delighted with the prospect of baiting and doubtless torturing such
important prisoners as we. He stood and glowered at us a moment
before he spoke. It was so evident that he was trying to impress
and frighten us that I couldn't restrain a desire to
laugh&mdash;well, perhaps I didn't try very hard. I knew how to
bait such creatures as Torko. I also knew that no matter what
attitude we assumed toward him he would give us the works, so to
speak, the moment he was given the opportunity.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I wasn't laughing before you came up, Torko; so I must be
laughing at you."</p>

<p>"Laughing at me, are you, you stinking mistal?" he bellowed.
"Well, you won't laugh when I get you in the courtroom tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>"You won't get me into the courtroom tomorrow morning, Torko;
and even if I am there, you won't be. You'll be in one of these
cells; and then, later, you'll have an opportunity to discover how
effective are the ingenious devices for torture you bragged of
having invented."</p>

<p>Zerka and Mantar looked their astonishment, the former smiling a
little because she thought I was bluffing again. Torko stood there
fairly boiling.</p>

<p>"I've a good mind to take you down there now," he threatened,
"and get out of you what you mean by such talk."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't dare do that, Torko," I told him. "You already
have your orders about us. And, anyway, you don't have
to&mdash;I'll tell you without being tortured. It's like this:
Mephis is going to be angry with you when I tell him you offered to
give me liberties while I was stationed here if I would speak a
good word about you to the Toganja Zerka, that she might carry it
to him. He won't like it when he learns that you let me go fishing
whenever I wanted to and thus permitted me to pave the way for my
escape by boat; and, Torko, there is another thing that is going to
make him so furious that&mdash;well, I just don't know what he will
do to you when he discovers it."</p>

<p>Torko was commencing to look uncomfortable, but he came right
through with the same argument that even great statesmen of our own
Earth use when they're caught red-handed.</p>

<p>"They're a pack of lies!" he yelled.</p>

<p>"He won't think so when he learns about the other thing you have
done&mdash;something that he can see with his own eyes," I baited
him.</p>

<p>"What's the other lie," he demanded, his curiosity and fear
getting the better of him.</p>

<p>"Oh, just that you unlocked the cell of Mintep, Jong of Vepaja,
and let him escape," I said.</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> a lie," he cried.</p>

<p>"Well, go and look for yourself," I suggested. "If he's gone,
who else could have unlocked his cell? You have the only keys."</p>

<p>"He's not gone," he said; but he turned and ran down the stairs
as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>"You seem to be having a good time," said Mantar, "and we might
as well have all the fun we can while we may. It's not going to be
so funny when morning comes&mdash;not for us."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," I objected, "that may be the most amusing
time of all."</p>

<p>"I am amused now," said Zerka. "How furious Torko will be when
he discovers that you have hoaxed him into running all the way down
to the basement."</p>

<p>"But it is not a hoax," I said. "He will find Mintep's cell door
open and Mintep gone."</p>

<p>"How can you possibly know that?" demanded Zerka.</p>

<p>"Because I released Mintep myself, and he is on his way to
safety right now."</p>

<p>"But how could you enter the Gap kum Rov and take a prisoner out
under the noses of the Zani Guard?" demanded Zerka. "Why, it is
simply impossible. You couldn't have even unlocked his cell if you
had managed to get into the prison, which, in itself, would have
been impossible."</p>

<p>I had to smile. "But I did," I said, "and it was very easy."</p>

<p>"Would you mind very much telling me how you did it?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I assured her. "In the first place, I secured a
duplicate master key to all the locks of Gap kum Rov while I was
stationed here. Last night I came in a boat to the side of the
prison and entered it through the chute that discharges the ashes
from the furnace into the bay. I brought Mintep out the same
way."</p>

<p>Mantar and Zerka shook their heads in astonishment. It could not
have seemed possible to many inhabitants of Amlot that a prisoner
might escape from the Gap kum Rov, for few of them knew anything
about the prison except that no prisoner had ever escaped from
it.</p>

<p>"And you have a master key to the locks?" asked Mantar.</p>

<p>I took it from my pocket pouch. "Here it is," I said. "If they
had confined us in the basement, we might have escaped easily, at
least as far as the waters of the bay; but with a guard watching
constantly on the floor below there is no chance from here."</p>

<p>"But aren't you afraid they'll find the key on you?" asked
Zerka.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; but what can I do about it? I have no place to
hide it. I shall simply have to take the chance that they won't
search me&mdash;they are so stupid. Anyway, unless they confine us
in the basement, it cannot possibly be of any use to us.
Furthermore, I have an idea that we'll walk out of here without any
need of a key."</p>

<p>"You are very optimistic," said Mantar; "but I can't see upon
what food your optimism thrives."</p>

<p>"Wait for dawn," I counselled.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Zerka.</p>

<p>From below we heard Torko's voice bellowing orders. Guards were
running to and fro. They were searching the prison for Mintep. When
they reached our floor they entered every cell and searched it
carefully, although they could have seen the whole interior of each
of them from the corridor. Torko's face was drawn and pale. He
looked to me like a broken man. When he reached our cell he was
trembling, as much, I think, from fright as from rage.</p>

<p>"What have you done with him?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I?" I asked in feigned astonishment. "Now, how could I have
gotten into this impregnable prison, so ably guarded by the great
Torko&mdash;unless with the connivance of Torko? Mephis will be
sure to ask that very question."</p>

<p>"Listen," Torko said, coming close and whispering. "I was good
to you when you were here. Do not send me to my death. Do not tell
Mephis that Mintep has escaped. If he is not told, he may never
know it. The chances are he has forgotten all about Mintep by this
time. If you do not tell him, I promise not to torture you and your
accomplices unless I am forced to; and then I'll make it as easy as
I can."</p>

<p>"If you do torture us, I'll certainly tell him," I replied. I
certainly had Torko over a barrel.</p>

<p>Torko scratched his head in thought for a moment. "Say," he said
at last, "of course you couldn't have let him out; but how in the
world did you know he was gone?"</p>

<p>"I'm psychic, Torko," I told him. "I even know things are going
to happen before they do. What is the hour?"</p>

<p>He looked at me rather fearfully as he replied. "It is the 1st
hour," he said. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Presently you shall hear a great noise in the direction of the
palace of Mephis," I said, "and then word will pass around that
death and destruction are raining upon the Zanis from the sky
because they hold me and my friends prisoners in Gap kum Rov. When
Mephis sets us free, it shall stop."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" said Torko, and went on to search other cells for
Mintep, Jong of Vepaja. He didn't find him.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Time dragged leadenly after dawn crept slowly out of the east and
its light sought to penetrate the dirty windows of the Gap kum Rov.
I was tense from waiting for the first detonation of a bomb. The
second hour came and then the third, yet still nothing had
happened. What could the reason be? Had disaster overtaken Duare? I
imagined a hundred terrible things that might have happened. A
crack-up at the take-off seemed the most likely. I was still
worrying when Torko came with a detail of the guard and took us
down to the courtroom. There were Mephis, Spehon, and a number of
other high Zanis. We were lined up before them. They glowered at us
like ogres out of a fairy tale.</p>

<p>"It is the third hour," said Mephis. "I have waited, and because
you have made me wait it shall go the harder for you. If any of you
expect any mercy you will name all your accomplices in the low plot
you have fostered to overthrow the state. Torko, take the woman
first. We'll make her talk, and I'll save you for the last. Take
that thing off his head, Torko." He pointed at me.</p>

<p>I looked at Torko, as he took off my flying helmet and threw it
into a corner. The sweat was pouring down his face, although it was
not hot. "Do not forget, Torko," I whispered.</p>

<p>"Mercy," he pleaded. "I must obey orders."</p>

<p>They laid Zerka upon a hideous thing that would have crushed her
slowly, inch by inch, starting at her toes; and they brought a
brazier containing a pot of molten metal and set it down on a table
beside her. It was not difficult to guess how they intended to use
it. I turned my head, for I could not look at the frightful thing
they contemplated.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to confess?" asked Mephis.</p>

<p>"No," replied Zerka in a firm voice.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, this: I joined the Zani Party because I had learned that
you tortured and murdered my man. I joined to undermine it; and for
another, greater purpose&mdash;to kill you."</p>

<p>Mephis laughed. "And this is the way you kill me!" he
taunted.</p>

<p>"No, not this way; nor the way I had hoped, but the only way I
could find," replied Zerka.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Mephis.</p>

<p>"I mean that I have avenged my husband, but you did not know it.
Know it now, then. Before another day has passed, you will be
dead."</p>

<p>"And how, please, am I to die at the hand of a dead woman?"
jeered Mephis.</p>

<p>"You ate food in my home last night, Mephis. Do you recall? That
food was poisoned. I have kept it there for a long time to cheat
you of the pleasure of killing me, were I caught. Last night I had
the opportunity I had never hoped for of letting you eat it
instead. At any moment, now, you will die&mdash;certainly before
another day has passed."</p>

<p>The face of Mephis turned livid. He tried to speak, but no words
came to his white lips. He rose and pointed at Torko. He was trying
to order the torture to proceed. Torko looked at me and trembled.
The other Zanis were staring at Mephis; then, close by, came a
shattering detonation that shook the walls of Gap kum Rov. Duare
had come! But she was bombing the prison instead of the
palace&mdash;she must have mistaken the one for the other. It was
possible.</p>

<p>"I warned you!" I shouted. "The city will be destroyed if you
don't set us free and give us a boat."</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Mephis. "Destroy them all!" Then he gasped,
clutched his throat, and fell forward across the bench.</p>

<p>The Zanis rushed forward, surrounding him. Another bomb burst so
close that I was certain that it had struck the building. It threw
us all to the floor. Spehon was the first to his feet.</p>

<p>"Mephis is dead!" he cried. "Spehon is ruler of Korva!"</p>

<p>"Maltu Spehon!" shouted the assembled Zanis; then a bomb
exploded in the rear of the building, and again we were all thrown
to the floor.</p>

<p>"Get them out of here!" screamed Spehon. "Get them a boat!
Hurry!"</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Well, they got us out of there in short order; but we were far from
safe. Bombs kept bursting all around us. In the sky above, I saw
the anotar circling like a great bird of prey; yet it looked sweet
to me. They hurried us to a safer part of the bay side and found us
a boat&mdash;a fair size fishing boat with two sails; then they
hustled us into it. We made sail quickly and started tacking for
the harbor entrance; and as we moved slowly away from shore, I saw
the anotar drop in a graceful spiral toward us. Duare was coming to
make sure that it was I. She didn't drop far enough to be in range
of any r-ray or T-ray guns they might have trained on the ship, for
I had warned her against this. She circled us a few times, and then
flew back over the city. I wondered why she didn't follow us out to
sea and pick us up. We were about the center of the harbor when I
heard another bomb explode. In rapid succession five more fell. It
was then that I guessed the truth&mdash;Duare had not recognized
me! She must naturally have expected to see a man alone in a
boat&mdash;a man wearing a flying helmet. Instead she had seen two
men and a woman, and both men sported the Zani coiffure.</p>

<p>Briefly I explained our situation to Zerka and Mantar. It seemed
almost hopeless. We could not return to shore because the Zanis
would be furious at the continued bombing which I had promised them
would stop if they set us free. If we waited around in the harbor
on the chance that Duare might circle above us again and give me an
opportunity to signal her, it was almost certain that the Zanis
would send a launch out to recapture us.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I suggested, "Duare may take another look, even out
at sea. Suppose we round the headland and wait out of sight of the
city?"</p>

<p>They both agreed that it would do no harm, and so I sailed the
boat well out beyond the mouth of the harbor, where we would be
hidden from the city by the headland. From that position we could
see the anotar circling high over Amlot, and from time to time we
heard the booming detonations of her bombs. Late in the afternoon
we saw her turn her nose northeast in the direction of Sanara, and
in a few minutes she was out of sight.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16" name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; DESPAIR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FOR a few minutes I plumbed the depths of despair,
and then I thought of the torture chamber and how much worse things
might have been for us, especially for Zerka and Mantar. Had I not
stopped at her palace the night before, both of them would now be
dead. They must have been thinking this same thing, too, for they
were very gay and happy. Yet our position was far from being an
enviable one. We were without food, water, or weapons, in a none
too substantial boat, off an enemy shore; and Sanara was five
hundred miles away and possibly in the hands of another enemy. But
worst of all, for me, Duare was in equal danger. She would not dare
return to Sanara until she knew that Muso had been deposed. If he
were never deposed, what was she to do? Where could she go? And all
the time she must be thinking that I was dead. I was that much
better off, at least; I was sure she lived. Of course, she had her
father; but I knew that that would scarcely compensate for the loss
of the man she loved, nor would her father be able to protect her
as well as I. He would have been all right as a protector back in
his own kingdom, with his warriors and his other loyal subjects
about him, but I had learned to take care of Duare under conditions
far different. Of course, I hadn't always made such a good job of
it; but in the end, I had come through all right.</p>

<p>As the anotar disappeared in the distance I made sail again and
turned up the coast in the direction of Sanara.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Zerka.</p>

<p>I told her.</p>

<p>She nodded in approval. "I only asked out of curiosity," she
said. "Wherever you wish to go suits me. Thanks to you, we are
alive. We can ask no more."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we are as well off anyway," I said. "It might have been
pretty nearly impossible to crowd seven people into the
anotar."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
We sailed up the coast all that night under a fresh breeze, and in
the morning I came in close and we watched for signs of fresh
water. At last we saw a stream falling over a low cliff into the
ocean, and I made for a strip of yellow sand where a long, low surf
broke lazily.</p>

<p>We were all suffering from thirst, which is the only excuse I
had for landing in such a spot. Fortunately the boat drew little
water, and we were able to paddle it in to a point where we could
wade. I held it there, while Zerka and Mantar slaked their thirst;
then I went and drank my fill. We had nothing in which to carry
water; so we put off again immediately, hoping we might find a more
suitable spot where we might make a temporary camp and endeavor to
improvise some sort of equipment. About the middle of the day, we
found such a place&mdash;a little cove into which a stream of fresh
water emptied, and about which grew a variety of trees and plants.
Among the latter was a huge arborescent grass nearly a foot in
diameter, with hard, smooth outer wood and a pithy core. We managed
to break one of these down; and, after building a fire, we burned
out one section. The sections were formed by well marked joints or
nodes, at which the inner cavity was closed by a strong diaphragm.
Our efforts resulted in a receptacle about three feet high and a
foot in diameter, in which we could carry fresh water. So
successful was this first attempt that we made two more of
them.</p>

<p>In the wood we found nuts and fruits; so that now all we lacked
were weapons. If we had had a knife we might have fulfilled this
want, as we could have made bows, arrows, and spears from the hard,
outer wood of this bamboolike plant. Mantar and I discussed this
most important matter, for we knew that if we were ever compelled
to remain on shore for any length of time we might need weapons
sorely. We certainly should, if we were to have meat to eat. We
searched the beach together, and finally found several pieces of
sharp-edged stones and shells. With this meager encouragement, we
decided to camp where we were until we had contrived some sort of
weapons.</p>

<p>I shall not bore you with a recital of our methods. Suffice it
to say that our technique was wholly primitive; but with fire and
using our sharp-edged tools as wedges and scrapers, we managed to
hack out spears, bows, arrows and sharp-pointed wooden knives. We
also made two long harpoons for spearing fish; then, with a supply
of fresh water and quantities of nuts and tubers, we set out again
upon our long journey toward Sanara.</p>

<p>Fortune favored us, for the wind held; and though we had a few
stiff blows, the seas were never such as we could not weather. This
was fortunate for us, as we did not want to be forced ashore if we
could avoid it. We often ran rather close in, and at such times it
was not unusual for us to see savage beasts along the shore. No
monsters of the sea attacked us. In fact, we saw but a couple that
might have proved dangerous; and we left these strictly alone. With
our harpoons we were able to vary our diet of nuts and tubers with
excellent fish, which we ran ashore and cooked as quickly as we
could find a suitable place after catching them.</p>

<p>Had I not had my mind filled almost entirely with thoughts of
Duare and worries concerning her, I might have enjoyed this
adventure exceedingly; but as it was I chafed at every delay, even
to the point of begrudging the time it took to cook food or take on
fresh water.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
On the night of the sixth day out, we were sailing smoothly along a
low coast, when I saw clearly in the night sky the flare of a blue
rocket against the lower surface of the inner cloud envelope. It
was followed in a moment by another and then another. The enemy
were springing the trap that was to snare Muso! I wondered if this
were the first, the second, or the third night. We might have been
too far away before this to have seen them. It made no difference,
as it might be two more days before we could hope to reach the
coast near Sanara.</p>

<p>The next night we watched for a repetition of the rockets, the
purpose of which I had explained to Zerka and Mantar; but nothing
rewarded our vigil; and I was of the opinion that last night's
rockets had completed the series of three nightly for three nights
and that tonight Muso would walk into the trap that I had prepared
for him. How I wished that I might be there to witness his
undoing!</p>

<p><br>
<br>
And now we encountered storms. The next day we were driven ashore
by a wind of almost hurricane velocity. We managed to find a
sheltered bay; and here we anchored, safe from the storm as well as
from wild beasts and savage men. For three days we were
storm-bound, and Sanara only one day's sail away! The delay was
maddening, but there was nothing that we could do about it. Man
made obstacles we might overcome, but not those interposed by the
elements. During our enforced wait, we speculated upon our chances
of gaining entry into Sanara through the Zani lines which encircled
the city; and we were all forced to admit that they seemed rather
remote, as, by all means, we must avoid being recaptured by the
Zanis; so here was a man made obstacle quite as difficult of
negotiation as any that the elements might raise. It appeared that
we were stymied. However, we must go on, hoping for some fortuitous
circumstance that would solve our difficulty.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
In the evening of the third day, the storm suddenly abated; and,
though the seas were still running high, we put out from our little
harbor and set our course once more for Sanara. Perhaps it was a
foolhardy thing to do, but the enforced delay and my anxiety to
reach Sanara and be re-united with Duare had rendered me
temerarious. The seas were like a great, grey army rushing,
battalion after battalion, in their assault upon the shore; and we
a tiny Argo between the Charybdis of the one and the Scylla of the
other. Yet we came through without mishap, and dawn found us off
the mouth of the river upon which Sanara lies a few miles from the
coast.</p>

<p>"And now what are we to do?" asked Zerka.</p>

<p>I shook my head in despair. "Pray to Lady Luck," I said.</p>

<p>"The only plan that I can suggest that seems to contain even a
germ of success," said Mantar, "is for me to get through the Zani
lines at night and seek admission to the city. I am well known to
many of the nobility and high officials. They would accept and
believe me; and I should be safe even though Muso were still jong,
which would not hold true with you, Carson. Once inside the city,
it would be easy to arrange for your princess to fly out and pick
up Zerka and you."</p>

<p>"If she is there," I amended. "If Muso is still jong, she is not
there."</p>

<p>"That is what I must ascertain," he replied.</p>

<p>"And what of Zerka?" I asked. "If you are in the city and Muso
is jong, I cannot come in; then how shall we get Zerka in?"</p>

<p>"I shall be content to remain with you, Carson; so don't give me
a thought," said Zerka.</p>

<p>"Whatever we do can't be done until after dark," I said; "so we
shall have to cruise around until then. Maybe in the meantime we
shall have evolved a better plan than Mantar's, which I do not like
because it subjects him to too much risk."</p>

<p>It was very monotonous, cruising aimlessly about; and very
tantalizing to be so near our goal and yet so far from reaching it.
The seas had gone down, but enormous ground swells alternately
lifted us to high crests and dropped us into deep hollows. Fishes
swarmed about us&mdash;the sea was alive with them, and now and
again some great monster of the deep passed close, like a giant
submarine, as it voraciously gobbled the lesser creatures in its
path. About the 8th hour Zerka voiced an exclamation of excitement
and pointed toward the city; and as I looked, I saw the anotar
above Sanara. It was evident that she had just risen from the city.
That could mean but one thing to me; no, two&mdash;the first, that
Duare lived; the second, that Muso no longer ruled as jong; for no
one but Duare could fly the ship, and she would not have been in
Sanara had Muso ruled the city.</p>

<p>As we watched, we saw that the plane was heading in our
direction and we prepared to try to attract Duare's attention to
us. I lowered the sails, lest it hide our efforts; and then I put
one of our improvised water containers upside down over the end of
the harpoon. As the ship approached, Mantar and I waved the crude
signal back and forth.</p>

<p>From the time that she had left the city, Duare had been
climbing; and had gained considerable altitude by the time she
passed over us. We must have appeared very small to her. Perhaps
she did not see us at all. She certainly gave no indication of it.
I wondered why she was flying out over the ocean, and waited for
her to circle back, hoping for better luck with our signalling next
time. But she did not circle back&mdash;she continued straight upon
her course into the southeast. In utter silence we watched until
the ship became a little speck in the distance and finally
disappeared.</p>

<p>My heart sank, for I knew the truth&mdash;Duare thought me dead
and was flying back to Vepaja with her father! I should never see
her again, for how could I reach Vepaja? and what would it avail me
were I to? Mintep would have me destroyed before I could even so
much as see my Duare. I was utterly unnerved as I sat there staring
out across that lonely ocean after my lost love. I must have looked
the picture of dejection that I felt. Zerka placed a hand upon
mine. It was a gesture of sympathy and friendship which would have
been negatived by words.</p>

<p>Presently I hoisted the sails again and headed in for shore. As
we approached it, and it became evident that I was going to enter
the mouth of the river, Mantar spoke.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am going through the Zani lines and up to the city," I
replied.</p>

<p>"Have you gone mad?" he demanded. "At night you might stand a
chance of getting through; but in broad daylight, none. You'll be
arrested; and even if no one at the front recognizes you, there'll
be plenty in Amlot, where you'll surely be sent."</p>

<p>"I'll get through," I said, "or I won't; but I'll not go back to
Amlot."</p>

<p>"You're desperate now, Carson," said Zerka. "Don't throw your
life away uselessly. There may be happiness for you yet; why, your
princess may even return from Vepaja."</p>

<p>"No," I said; "once she is there they will never permit her to
leave again."</p>

<p>I ran the boat close to the river bank and leaped ashore.
"Cruise around close by," I called to Mantar. "I'll get word to
you, if it's humanly possible. Watch the city. If you see balloons
go up by day or rockets by night, you'll know I've won through and
that plans are being made to bring you and Zerka in. Goodby!"</p>

<p>I had run the boat quite a distance up the river before landing;
so the city was not far away as I set out on foot toward it. I made
no effort to conceal myself, but walked boldly toward my goal. I
should have been close behind the Zani lines, but I saw no sign of
troops nor of any engines of war. Presently I came to where the
Zanis had lain for so many months. The ground was littered with the
rubbish of war. There were a few dead men lying where they had
fallen, but no living thing was visible between me and the city.
The siege had been raised, the Zanis were gone!</p>

<p>I turned and almost ran back to the river. Mantar and Zerka were
drifting slowly down the stream toward the ocean. I shouted to them
and beckoned them to return, and when they were within reach of my
voice I told them that the Zanis had gone and that nothing lay
between us and the city. They could scarcely believe the good news;
and when they had taken me aboard, we sailed up the river toward
Sanara. About a quarter of a mile from the city we came ashore and
walked toward the nearest gate. From the city walls a number of
warriors were watching us, and, I presume, with a great deal of
suspicion, since Mantar and I still wore the Zani hairdress and
apparel.</p>

<p>As we came closer to the gate, Mantar and I made the sign of
peace; and as we stopped before it an officer hailed us.</p>

<p>"Ho, Zanis! What do you want at Sanara? to be shot as
traitors?"</p>

<p>"We are not Zanis," I replied. "We want word with Taman."</p>

<p>"So," he laughed, "you are not Zanis! Oh, no, not at all. Do you
think we of Sanara do not know Zanis when we see them?"</p>

<p>"I am Carson of Venus," I said. "Tell that to Taman."</p>

<p>At that he left the wall; and presently the gate swung open a
little way, and he came out with a few warriors to have a closer
look at us. As he did so, I recognized him; and he me. He was one
of the officers who had flown with me on one of the occasions that
I had bombed the Zani camp. I introduced him to Zerka and Mantar,
for whom I vouched; and he told us to enter the city and that he
would escort us personally to Taman.</p>

<p>"One question," I said, "before I come into Sanara."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Is Muso still jong?"</p>

<p>He smiled. "I can understand that you might wish to know that,"
he said, "but I can assure you that Muso is no longer jong. The
high council deposed him and created Taman jong."</p>

<p>It was with a feeling of relief that I re-entered the city of
Sanara after the trying weeks of danger and uncertainty through
which I had passed, and during which I had never known of any place
upon this strange planet where I might abide in safety&mdash;not in
Kooaad, where even my best friends would have been in duty bound to
have killed me because I had dared love their princess and she me;
not in Kapdor, the Thorist city of Noobol, where they had placed me
in the room of the seven doors from which no man before had escaped
alive; not in Kormor, Skor's city of the dead, from which I had
stolen Duare and Nalte from under Skor's nose in his own palace;
not in Havatoo, that Utopian city on the banks of the River of
Death, from which I had rescued Duare from an inexplicable
miscarriage of justice; not in Amlot, where the followers of Spehon
would have torn me limb from limb. There was only Sanara. Had Muso
still been jong here I should have been doomed to wander on in
hopeless loneliness.</p>

<p>At last I had a city I might call my own, where I might
establish a home and live in peace and contentment; but there was
only relief, not joy, in contemplation of the fact, because Duare
was not there to share it with me. So I re-entered Sanara in
sorrow, and in the howdah of a great military gantor we were
escorted through the avenues toward the palace of Taman. It was
well, too, that we had a strong military escort, for the people who
saw us pass thought that we were Zani prisoners; and would have
made quick work of us had it not been for the soldiers. Even to the
very gates of the palace of the jong they followed us, booing and
cursing and flinging insults at us. The officer who escorted us
tried to tell them that we were not Zanis, but his voice was
drowned in the tumult.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17" name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; FORTY MINUTES!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN word was taken to Taman that I had returned
to Sanara, he had us brought to him at once. He had known the
Toganja Zerka well in Amlot, and after he had listened to her story
he promised that both she and Mantar should be rewarded for the
hazardous work they had performed in the stronghold of the Zanis.
Upon me he conferred nobility, promising me palaces and land also
as soon as the seat of government should have been re-established
in Amlot. When he learned of the attitude of the Sanarans toward us
because of our Zani appearance, he ordered black wigs for Mantar
and me and new apparel for all of us; then he turned Zerka and
Mantar over to members of his household staff and took me to see
Jahara, his queen. I knew that he wanted to talk to me in private
and tell me about Duare, the one subject upper most in my mind but
of which neither of us had spoken. The little Princess Nna was with
her mother when we entered the apartments of the queen, and they
both welcomed me with great cordiality and real friendship.
Fortunately for Nna, she was not fettered by the ridiculous customs
of Vepaja that had made of Duare a virtual prisoner in her own
apartments in her father's palace; but could mingle as freely with
the court as other members of the royal family. She was a sweet
young girl and the pride of Taman and Jahara. Shortly after I was
received by the latter, Nna was taken away by a lady-in-waiting;
and I was not to see her again until after a harrowing episode and
a dangerous adventure.</p>

<p>As soon as Taman, Jahara, and I were alone I turned to the
former. "Tell me about Duare," I begged. "I saw the anotar leave
Sanara this morning and head out over the ocean. No one but Duare
could have been at the controls, for only she and I know how to fly
the ship."</p>

<p>"You are right," he replied, "it was Duare."</p>

<p>"And she was flying her father back to Vepaja?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Mintep practically forced her to do so. She had not given
up hope that you might be alive, and she wanted to remain. She was
planning on flying back to Amlot with more bombs and a message that
she would continue to bomb the city until you were released, but
Mintep would not let her do so. He swore that if you did live, he
would kill you on sight, for while, as a father, he owed you a debt
of gratitude for all that you had done for his daughter, as Jong of
Vepaja he must destroy you for having dared to love his daughter
and take her as your mate. Finally he commanded her to return to
Vepaja with him and stand trial before the nobles of Kooaad for
having broken one of the oldest taboos of Vepaja."</p>

<p>"That may mean death for her," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, she realized that; and so did Mintep, but the dynastic
customs and laws of Vepaja are so ingrained in every fibre of their
beings that, to them, it was almost unthinkable to attempt to evade
them. Duare would have had she known that you lived. She told me
that, and she also told me that she would return to Vepaja
willingly because she preferred death to life without you. I do not
know what Mintep would have done had she refused to return to
Kooaad; but I think he would have killed her with his own hands,
notwithstanding the fact that he loved her. I was, however,
prepared for such an eventuality; and I should have protected Duare
even to the extent of imprisoning Mintep. I can tell you that we
were all in a most unhappy situation. I never before saw a man of
such unquestioned intelligence so fanatical as Mintep, but on this
one subject only. Otherwise he seemed perfectly normal and lavished
upon Duare all the love of a devoted father. I have often wondered
what he would have done if Duare had found you at Amlot. I can't
imagine him in the anotar with you. But, tell me, what went wrong
with your plans? Duare said that you did not put off from the city
in a boat as you should have done were you released."</p>

<p>"I put off just as had been planned; but I had Zerka and Mantar
with me, and Duare would have been looking for a lone man in a
boat. Also, my flying helmet had been taken from me in the
courtroom of the prison; so there was nothing by which she could
identify me. We must have looked like three Zanis to her."</p>

<p>"Then she saw you," said Taman, "for she told me that she saw
three Zanis put off into the harbor. When you did not come as she
had hoped, she assumed that the Zanis had killed you; and she
bombed the city until she had exhausted her supply of bombs. Then
she flew back with Mintep, Ulan, and Legan; and remained in the
vicinity of Sanara for several days until we sent up three balloons
to indicate that it was safe for you to enter Sanara&mdash;of
course, at that time, we did not know that you were not in the
ship."</p>

<p>"And what of Muso? I was told at the gate that he had been
deposed."</p>

<p>"Yes, and imprisoned," replied Taman; "but he has a number of
followers whose lives will not be safe in Korva now that Muso is no
longer jong. They are desperate. Last night they succeeded in
liberating Muso from prison, and he is hiding now somewhere in the
city. We do not believe that he has been able to leave Sanara as
yet, though that is his plan. He believes that if he can reach
Amlot, the Zanis will make him jong; but he does not know what we
know&mdash;that Mephis is dead and that after his death the
counterrevolutionists struck and completely routed the Zani
overlords, of whom the people, including the majority who claimed
to be Zanis, were heartily sick. The word must have reached the
troops before Sanara yesterday morning, for it was then that they
evacuated their positions and started on the long march back toward
Amlot."</p>

<p>"Then the long civil war is over," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Taman, "and I hope soon to re-establish the
capital at Amlot. I have already sent word that I would extend
amnesty to all except ringleaders and those whose acts have been
definitely criminal. I expect to follow my messenger in person in a
few days with a powerful army. And, my friend, I hope that you will
accompany me and receive in my capital the honors that are your
due."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Do not think that I don't appreciate your
generosity," I said, "but I think you will understand that they
would be empty honors indeed without my princess to share
them."</p>

<p>"But why not?" he urged. "You must live, and here you may live
in comfort and in honor. What other plans may you have?"</p>

<p>"I am going to follow Duare to Vepaja."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" he exclaimed. "How can you hope to reach Vepaja?
Every Korvan vessel was taken or destroyed by the enemy during the
last war."</p>

<p>"I have a boat that brought me safely from Amlot," I reminded
him.</p>

<p>"What is it? a fishing boat?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A mere cockleshell," he cried. "You would not last through the
first storm."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I shall make the attempt," I said.</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly. "I wish that I might dissuade you," he
said, "not alone because of my friendship for you, but because you
could be of such great value to Korva."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By showing us how to build anotars and training my officers to
fly them."</p>

<p>"The temptation is great," I admitted, "but I shall never rest
in peace until I know that I have done all that man can do to
rescue Duare."</p>

<p>"Well, you can't leave at once; so we shall make the most of the
time that you are with us; and I shall not annoy you with further
importunities."</p>

<p>He called an aide then, and had me shown to the quarters he had
assigned me. There I found new apparel and a black wig; and after a
hot bath I felt like a new man; and looked like one, too, as my
mirror revealed in a startling manner. I should not have known
myself, so greatly did the wig change my appearance.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Zerka, Mantar, and I dined that night in the great banquet hall of
the jong's palace with Taman and Jahara and a company of the great
nobles of Korva. They had all known me, some of them quite well;
but they all agreed that they would never have recognized me. This,
I realized, was not entirely due to the black wig. I had lost
considerable weight during my hazardous adventures in Amlot; and I
had undergone considerable mental suffering, with the result that
my face was haggard and lined, my cheeks sunken.</p>

<p>During the long dinner, we three from Amlot fairly monopolized
the conversation, but not through any desire on our part. The other
guests insisted upon hearing every detail of what we had observed
there and what we had experienced. They were especially interested
in Zerka's description of the devious methods whereby the
counterrevolutionists had carried on their operations despite the
highly organized Zani spy system and the ruthless extermination of
all who became suspected. They were still listening to her,
spellbound, when a highly agitated aide entered the banquet hall
and approached Taman. As he whispered in the jong's ear, I saw the
latter turn suddenly pale; then he rose and, taking Jahara's hand,
led her from the hall. While the jong's departure left us free to
depart if we wished, no one did so. We all felt that Taman was in
trouble, and I think that as one man our only thought was to
remain, in the event that we might be of service to our jong. We
were right, for presently the aide returned and asked us to remain
until Taman could speak with us. A few moments later he returned to
the banquet hall; and, standing at the head of the long table,
spoke to us.</p>

<p>"In this hall," he said, "are many of my most loyal subjects and
trusted friends. I have come to you in a moment of great trouble to
ask your aid. The Janjong Nna has been abducted from the
palace."</p>

<p>An involuntary exclamation of shock and sorrow filled the great
room.</p>

<p>"She was taken with the connivance of someone in the palace,"
continued Taman, "but not before two loyal guardsmen had been
killed attempting to defend her. That is all I know."</p>

<p>A voice murmured, "Muso!" It reflected the thought in every
mind; and just then an officer hurried into the hall and up to
Taman, handing him a message.</p>

<p>"This was just found in the janjong's apartment," said the
officer.</p>

<p>Taman read the message through; then he looked up at us. "You
were right," he said. "It was Muso. This is a threat to kill Nna
unless I abdicate in favor of Muso and swear allegiance to
him."</p>

<p>We all stood there voiceless. What was there to say? Could we
advise a father to sacrifice a loved daughter? Could we permit Muso
to become jong of Korva? We were upon the horns of a dilemma.</p>

<p>"Does the message state any time when your decision must be
reached?" asked Varo, the general.</p>

<p>Taman nodded. "Between the first and second hours in the morning
I must send up balloons from the palace roof&mdash;one, if I
refuse; two, if I accede."</p>

<p>"It is now the 26th hour," said Varo. "We have eleven hours in
which to work. In the meantime, Taman, I beg that you refrain from
making any reply. Let us see what we can accomplish."</p>

<p>"I shall leave the matter in your hands, Varo," said Taman,
"until the 1st hour tomorrow. Keep me advised of any progress, but
please do not jeopardize the life of my daughter."</p>

<p>"Her safety shall be our first concern," Varo assured the
jong.</p>

<p>Taman sat with us while we discussed plans. There seemed nothing
more practical than a thorough search of the city, and Varo issued
orders that routed out every soldier in Sanara to prosecute such a
search as few cities ever have been subjected to.</p>

<p>I asked permission to join the searchers, and when Varo granted
it I went at once to my quarters and summoned the servant who had
been detailed to attend me. When he came I asked him if he could
quickly procure for me the apparel such as a poor man might wear,
but one who might also reasonably carry a sword and pistol.</p>

<p>"That will be easy, sir," he said. "I have only to go to my own
quarters and fetch the apparel that I wear when I am not in the
livery of the jong's household."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
In ten minutes I was attired in the clothing of an ordinary citizen
of the lower class, and was soon on the street. I had a
plan&mdash;not a very brilliant one but the best I could think of.
I knew some rather disreputable haunts of the underworld of Sanara
where men might foregather who could be bribed to commit any crime
however heinous, and it occurred to me that here I might overhear
much discussion of a crime with which such men would be familiar
and possibly a hint that would lead me on the right trail. I really
didn't have much enthusiasm for the idea, but I had to do
something. I liked little Nna, and I couldn't just sit still and do
nothing while she was in danger.</p>

<p>I wandered down toward the lower end of the city where the fish
markets had been and where the sailors had gathered to carouse and
fight in the days before the war that had wiped out the merchant
marine and most of the fishing industry of Sanara. Now it was
almost deserted, but there were still many of the old drinking
places eking out a mean existence by catering to the men and women
of the underworld. I went from one to the other of them, buying
drinks here, gambling there, and always listening for any chance
scrap of conversation that might lead to a clue. There was much
talk on the subject of the abduction of the princess, for the
matter was uppermost in all minds; but nothing was said in any of
the places I went right up to the 36th hour that would have
indicated any knowledge of the whereabouts of Nna or of her
abductors.</p>

<p>I was discouraged and about hopeless as the 36th hour saw me
sitting in a dive near the river wall of Sanara, where I pretended
to be slightly under the influence of the vile drink that is
popular there and tastes something like a mixture of gin and
kerosene oil, of neither of which am I very fond&mdash;as a
beverage. I let myself be enticed into a gambling game that
somewhat resembles fan-tan. I lost consistently and paid with great
good humor.</p>

<p>"You must be a rich man," said an ugly looking customer seated
beside me.</p>

<p>"I know how to make money," I said. "I have made a lot this
night. I may hang for it; so I might as well spend it."</p>

<p>"That's the idea," he applauded. "But how did you make so much
money so easily?"</p>

<p>"That I should tell&mdash;and get my neck twisted," I said.</p>

<p>"I'll bet I know how he made it," offered another man, "and he
will get his neck twisted for it, too&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?" I demanded truculently.</p>

<p>"You know and so do Prunt and Skrag. They've gone for the rest
of theirs now."</p>

<p>"Oh, they have, have they?" I demanded. "I haven't got the rest
of mine. I don't know where to go to get it. They'll probably cheat
me out of it. Oh, well, I've got plenty anyway." I got up from the
table and walked toward the door, staggering just a little. I
hadn't the remotest idea that I was on a trail that would lead
where I wanted to go, but there was a chance. This was probably the
biggest crime that had been committed in Sanara since it was
founded; and when a great deal of money was exhibited under the
conditions and in the manner that I had exhibited mine, it would
naturally suggest connection of some kind with the criminals, for a
man of my apparent walk of life would not have come suddenly upon
great wealth honestly.</p>

<p>I had scarcely reached the door of the dive when I felt a hand
on my arm. I turned to look into the cunning face of the man who
had spoken to me last. "Let us talk together, my friend," he
said.</p>

<p>"What about?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You have some money coming to you," he commenced. "What would
you give me if I should show you where you could collect it?"</p>

<p>"If you can do that, I might give you half," I said.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "for half I will do it. But this is a bad
night to be about on work of this kind. Since they stole the jong's
daughter the city is being searched and everyone being questioned.
The boys got a lot of money for that. What you got for choking the
old villain, Kurch, would be nothing beside what Muso paid to have
the daughter of the jong brought to him."</p>

<p>So I was off on a wrong trail! But how to get on the right one?
The fellow was obviously drunk, which accounted for his loose
tongue; and he knew something about the abduction of Nna, but how
much? And how was I to switch him from one trail to another? I saw
that I would have to take the bull by the horns.</p>

<p>"What made you think I had anything to do with murdering Kurch?"
I demanded.</p>

<p>"Didn't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course not," I assured him. "I never said I did."</p>

<p>"Then how did you come by so much money?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose there were other jobs besides the Kurch job,"
I demanded.</p>

<p>"There were only two big jobs in town tonight," he said. "If you
were in on the other, you ought to know where to go."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't," I admitted. "I think they're tryin' to beat me
out of mine. They said they'd bring me the rest of mine down here,
but they aren't here. They wouldn't tell me where they took the
girl, either. I'd give anything to know. If I did, you can bet
they'd come through, or&mdash;" I touched my sword
significantly.</p>

<p>"How much would you give?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What difference does that make to you?" I demanded. "You don't
know where she is."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't, don't I? Just show me how high your money stacks.
I know lots of things for a tall stack."</p>

<p>Korvan money is all of the same metal, round pieces of different
thicknesses, their centers punched out with different size circles,
squares, ovals, and crosses; but all of the same outside diameter.
Their value is determined by the weight of the metal each contains.
They stack easily, and the thicker pieces of greatest value
naturally stack higher, giving usage to the common expression "a
tall stack" meaning a considerable amount of money.</p>

<p>"Well, if you really showed me where she is," I said, "I might
give you five hundred pandars." A pandar has about the purchasing
power in Korva that a dollar would have in America.</p>

<p>"You haven't got that much," he said.</p>

<p>I shook my pocket pouch so that the money in it rattled.
"Doesn't that sound like it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I like to feel money, not listen to it," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, come outside where no one will see us; and I'll show it
to you."</p>

<p>I saw the cunning glint in his eyes as we passed out into the
avenue. Finding a spot that was deserted and also dimly lighted by
a lamp in a window, I counted out five hundred pandars into his
cupped palms, definitely defeating for the moment any plan he had
to murder me; then, before he could transfer the money to his
pocket pouch, I drew my pistol and shoved it into his belly.</p>

<p>"If there's any shooting to be done, I'll do it," I told him.
"Now take me to where the girl is, and no funny business. When you
have done that, you may keep the money; but if you make a single
break, or fail to show me the girl, I'll let you have it. Get
going."</p>

<p>He grinned a sickly grin, and turned away down the dark street.
As he did so, I jerked his pistol from its holster; and shoved the
muzzle of mine into the small of his back. I wasn't taking any
chances.</p>

<p>"You're all right, fellow," he said. "When this job's over, I'd
like to work with you. You work quick, and you know what you're
doing. Nobody ain't going to fool you."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said. "Be at the same place tomorrow night, and
we'll talk it over." I thought this might keep him from trying to
double-cross me, but I still kept my gun in his ribs.</p>

<p>He led me along the river wall to an old, abandoned building at
one end of which was a huge incinerator within a firebox large
enough to hold half a dozen men. He stopped here and listened,
looking furtively in all directions.</p>

<p>"She's in here," he whispered. "This firebox opens into the
inside of the building, too. Now give me back my pistol and let me
go."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," I cautioned him. "The agreement was that you were
to show me the girl. Go on in!"</p>

<p>He hesitated, and I prodded him with my gun.</p>

<p>"They'll kill me," he whimpered.</p>

<p>"If you don't show me the girl, they won't have to," I
threatened. "Now don't talk any more&mdash;we may be overheard. If
I have to go in alone, I'll leave you out here, dead."</p>

<p>He said no more, but he was shaking as he crawled into the great
incinerator. I laid his pistol on the ledge of the firebox and
followed directly behind him. It was dark as a pocket in the
firebox and not much better in the room into which we
stepped&mdash;so dark that I had to hold onto my companion's
trappings to keep him from eluding me entirely. We stood in
silence, listening for a full minute. I thought I heard the murmur
of voices. My guide moved forward cautiously, feeling his way step
by step. It was evident that he had been here before. He crossed to
the side of the room, where he found a bolted door.</p>

<p>"This is for our getaway," he whispered, as he drew the bolt. I
knew from the direction we had come that the door opened out onto
the street.</p>

<p>He turned and moved diagonally across the room again to the
opposite wall. Here he found another door which he opened with the
utmost caution. When it was opened, the murmur of voices became
more distinct. Ahead of us, I could see a tiny ray of dim light
coming apparently from the floor of the room. My guide led me
forward to it, and I saw that it came through a hole in the
flooring&mdash;possibly a knothole.</p>

<p>"Look!" he whispered.</p>

<p>As I had to lie down on my stomach to look through the hole, I
made him lie down, also. In the circumscribed range of my vision, I
could not see much of the room below; but what I did see was almost
enough. Two men were sitting at a table, talking&mdash;one of them
was Muso. I could see no girl, but I knew that she might be there
outside the little circle that was visible to me. I could hear the
men talking.</p>

<p>"You don't really intend killing her, do you?" asked Muso's
companion.</p>

<p>"If I don't get a favorable reply from Taman before the 2nd
hour, I most certainly shall," replied Muso. "If she would write
her father as I have asked her to, she would be free to go at once;
for I know that Taman would not see his daughter die if she herself
begged him to save her."</p>

<p>"You'd better do it, Nna," said the other man. "The time is
getting short."</p>

<p>"Never!" said a girl's voice, and I knew that I had found
Nna.</p>

<p>"You may go now," I whispered to my companion. "You will find
your pistol on the ledge of the incinerator. But wait! How can I
get into that room?"</p>

<p>"There is a trap door in the corner, to your right," he replied.
He moved away so silently that I did not hear him go, but I knew
that he had. Only a fool would have remained with me.</p>

<p>Faintly into the darkness of the room came a suggestion of
growing light. The sun was rising. The first hour had come. In
forty minutes of Earth time the second hour would
strike&mdash;strike the death knell of Nna, the daughter of
Taman.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18" name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; A TANJONG</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">FORTY minutes! What could I do in that time to
insure the safety of the princess? Had I found her only a little
sooner, I could have summoned soldiers and surrounded the building.
They would not have killed her had they known they were going to be
taken. But I must do something. The precious minutes were slipping
by. There was nothing for it but to take the bull by the horns and
do the best I could. I rose and felt my way to the corner of the
room. On hands and knees I groped about in the darkness for the
trap door, and at last I found it. Gingerly I tried it to learn if
it were locked from below. It was not. I raised it quickly and
jumped through, my pistol still in my hand. I heard it slam shut
above my head as I touched the floor. Luckily, I did not fall; and
my advent had been so sudden and so unexpected that for an instant
Muso and his companion seemed unable to move or speak. I backed to
the wall and covered them.</p>

<p>"Don't move," I warned, "or I'll kill you both."</p>

<p>It was then that I first saw two men in the far corner of the
dimly lighted room as they leaped to their feet from a pile of rags
upon which they had been lying asleep. As they reached for their
pistols I opened fire on them. Muso dropped to the floor behind the
table at which he had been sitting, but his companion now drew his
own weapon and levelled it at me. I shot him first. How all three
of them could have missed me in that small room I cannot
understand. Perhaps the brains of two of them were dulled by sleep,
and the other was unquestionably nervous. I had seen his hand shake
as it held his weapon; but miss me they did, and the second and
third went down before they could find me with the deadly stream of
r-rays from their guns. Only Muso remained. I ordered him out from
under the table and took his pistol from him; then I looked about
for Nna. She was sitting on a bench at the far side of the
room.</p>

<p>"Have they harmed you in any way, Nna?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No; but who are you? Do you come from my father, the jong? Are
you a friend or another enemy?"</p>

<p>"I am your friend," I said. "I have come to take you away from
here and back to the palace." She did not recognize me in my black
wig and mean apparel.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Muso, "and what are you going to do to
me?"</p>

<p>"I am going to kill you, Muso," I said. "I have hoped for this
chance, but never expected to get it."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to kill me? I haven't harmed the princess. I
was only trying to frighten Taman into giving me back the throne
that belongs to me."</p>

<p>"You lie, Muso," I said; "but it is not this thing alone that I
am going to kill you for&mdash;not something that you may say you
did not intend doing, but something you did."</p>

<p>"What did I ever do to you? I never saw you before."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you have. You sent me to Amlot to my death, as you
hoped; and you tried to steal my woman from me."</p>

<p>His eyes went wide and his jaw dropped. "Carson of Venus!" he
gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes, Carson of Venus&mdash;who took your throne away from you
and is now going to take your life, but not because of what you did
to him. I could forgive that, Muso; but I can't forgive the
suffering you caused my princess. It is for that that you are about
to die."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't shoot me down in cold blood?" he cried.</p>

<p>"I should," I said, "but I am not going to. We'll fight with
swords. Draw!"</p>

<p>I had laid his pistol on the bench beside Nna, and now I drew my
own and placed it on the table at which Muso had been sitting; then
we faced one another. Muso was no mean swordsman, and as our blades
shattered the silence of that little room I commenced to suspect
that I might have bitten off more than I could chew; so I fought
warily and, I am free to admit, mostly on the defensive. That is no
way to win any contest, but I knew that if I became too reckless in
my attack he might easily slip cold steel through me. Yet something
must be done. This could not go on like this forever. I redoubled
my efforts; and because I had by now become accustomed to his mode
of attack, which he seldom varied, I commenced to have the
advantage. He realized it, too; and the yellow in him showed up
immediately. Then I pressed my advantage. I backed him around the
room, certain now that I could run him through almost at will. He
stepped back against the table in what I took to be a last stand;
then, suddenly, he hurled his sword directly in my face; and almost
simultaneously I heard the br-r-r of an r-ray pistol. I had seen
him reach for mine just as he hurled his sword at me. I expected to
fall dead, but I did not. Instead, Muso slumped backward across the
table and then rolled off onto the floor; and as I looked around, I
saw Nna standing with Muso's pistol still leveled in her hand. She
had robbed me of my revenge, but she had saved my life.</p>

<p>As I looked at her, she sat down very suddenly and burst into
tears. She was just a little girl, and she had been through too
much in the past few hours. She soon regained control of herself,
however; and looked up and smiled at me, rather wanly.</p>

<p>"I really didn't know you," she said, "until Muso called you by
name; then I knew that I was safe&mdash;that is, safer. We are not
safe yet. His men were to return here at the 2nd hour. It must be
almost that now."</p>

<p>"It is, and we must get out of here," I said. "Come!"</p>

<p>I slipped my pistol back into its holster; and we stepped to the
ladder that led up to the trap door, and at the same moment we
heard the heavy tramp of feet in the building above us. We were too
late.</p>

<p>"They have come!" whispered Nna. "What are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Go back to your bench and sit down," I said. "I think one man
may hold this doorway against many."</p>

<p>Stepping quickly to the sides of the dead men, I gathered their
pistols and carried them all to a point from which I could command
the ladder with the least danger to myself. The footsteps
approached the room above us, they entered it and crossed to the
trap door; and then a voice called down, "Hello, there, Muso!"</p>

<p>"What do you want of Muso?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I have a message for him."</p>

<p>"I will take it for him," I said. "Who are you? and what is your
message?"</p>

<p>"I am Ulan, of the Jong's Guard. The message is from Taman. He
agrees to your demands provided you will return Nna to him unharmed
and guarantee the future safety of Taman and his family."</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief and sat down in a nearby chair.
"Muso scorns your offer," I said. "Come down, Ulan, and see for
yourself why Muso is no longer interested."</p>

<p>"No trickery!" he warned, as he raised the trap door and
descended. When he turned at the foot of the ladder and saw the
four corpses lying on the floor his eyes went wide as he recognized
one of them as Muso; then he saw Nna and crossed to her.</p>

<p>"You are not harmed, Janjong?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," she replied. "But if it had not been for this man I should
have been dead by now."</p>

<p>He turned to me. I could see that he recognized me no more than
others had. "Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember me?"</p>

<p>Nna giggled, and I had to laugh myself.</p>

<p>"What is so funny?" he demanded. Ulan flushed angrily.</p>

<p>"That you should so soon forget a good friend," I said.</p>

<p>"I never saw you before," he snapped, for he knew we were making
fun of him.</p>

<p>"You never saw Carson of Venus?" I asked; then he laughed with
us as he finally pierced my disguise. "But how did you know where
to find the princess?"</p>

<p>"When Taman gave the required signal of acquiescence," explained
Ulan, "one of Muso's agents told us where she might be found."</p>

<p>We were soon out of that dank cellar and on our way to the
palace, where we brushed past the guards under escort of Ulan and
hastened through the palace to the jong's own quarters. Here Taman
and Jahara sat waiting for word from the last of the searchers or
from the emissary the former had dispatched to Muso at the urgings
of Jahara and his own heart. As the door was thrown open we sent
Nna in, Ulan and I remaining in a small antechamber, knowing that
they would wish to be alone. A jong would not wish his officers to
see him weep, as I am sure Taman must have wept for joy at Nna's
safe return.</p>

<p>It was but a few minutes before he came out into the
antechamber. His face was grave by now. He looked somewhat
surprised to see me, but he only nodded as he turned to Ulan.</p>

<p>"When will Muso return to the palace?" he asked.</p>

<p>We both looked at him in surprise. "Didn't the janjong tell
you?" asked Ulan. "She must have told you."</p>

<p>"Tell me what? She was crying so for joy that she could not
speak coherently. What is there to tell me, that I may not already
guess?"</p>

<p>"Muso is dead," said Ulan. "You are still jong."</p>

<p>From Ulan, and later from Nna, he finally got the whole story,
pieced out with what I told him of my search through the city; and
I have seldom seen a man more grateful. But I expected that from
Taman; so I was not surprised. He always gave fully of himself to
his friends and his loyal retainers.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
I thought I should sleep forever when I went to bed that morning in
my apartments in the jong's palace, but they didn't let me sleep as
long as I could have wished. At the 12th hour I was awakened by one
of Taman's aides and summoned to the great throne room. Here I
found the grand council of nobles assembled around a table at the
foot of the throne and the rest of the room crowded with the
aristocracy of Korva.</p>

<p>Taman and Jahara and Nna sat in their respective thrones upon
the dais, and there was a fourth chair at Taman's left. The aide
led me to the foot of the dais before Taman and asked me to kneel.
I think Taman is the only man in two worlds before whom I should be
proud to kneel. Above all other men, he deserves reverence for his
qualities of mind and soul. And so I knelt.</p>

<p>"To save the life of my daughter," commenced Taman, "I offered
my throne to Muso with the consent of the grand council. You,
Carson of Venus, saved my daughter and my throne. It is the will of
the grand council, in which I concur, that you be rewarded with the
highest honor in the power of a jong of Korva to bestow. I
therefore elevate you to the rank of royalty; and as I have no son,
I adopt you as my own and confer upon you the title of Tanjong of
Korva." Then he rose and, taking me by the hand, led me to the
vacant throne chair at his left.</p>

<p>I had to make a speech then, but the less said about that the
better&mdash;as a maker of speeches, I am a fairly good aviator.
There were speeches by several great nobles, and then we all
trooped to the banquet hall and overate for a couple of hours. This
time I did not sit at the foot of the table. From a homeless
wanderer a few months earlier, I had been suddenly elevated to the
second position in the empire of Korva. But that was all of lesser
moment to me than the fact that I had a home and real friends. If
only my Duare had been there to share it all with me!</p>

<p>Here at last I had found a country where we might live in peace
and honor, only to be thwarted by that same malign fate that had
snatched Duare from my arms on so many other occasions.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19" name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; PIRATES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">I NEVER really had an opportunity to more than
taste the honors and responsibilities that devolve upon a crown
prince, for the next day I started outfitting my little fishing
boat for the long trip to Vepaja.</p>

<p>Taman tried to dissuade me, as did Jahara and Nna and all my now
countless friends in Korva; but I could not be prevailed upon to
abandon the venture, however hopeless I myself felt it to be. The
very ease and luxury of my new position in life made it seem all
the more urgent that I search for Duare, for to enjoy it without
her seemed the height of disloyalty. I should have hated it always
had I remained.</p>

<p>Every assistance was given me in outfitting my craft. Large
water tanks were installed and a device for distilling fresh water
from sea water. Concentrated foods, preserved foods, dehydrated
fruits and vegetables, nuts, every edible thing that could be
preserved for a considerable time were packed away in waterproof
containers. New sails were made of the strong, light "spider cloth"
that is common among the civilized countries of Amtor, where
spiders are bred and kept for the purpose of spinning their webs
for commercial use, as are silkworms on Earth. They gave me weapons
and ammunition and warm blankets and the best navigation
instruments available; so that I was as well equipped for the
journey as it was possible for anyone to be.</p>

<p>At last the time of my departure arrived, and I was escorted to
the river with all the pomp and ceremony befitting my exalted rank.
There were troops and bands and a hundred gorgeously caparisoned
gantors bearing not only the nobility of Korva but its royalty as
well, for Taman and Jahara and the Princess Nna rode with me in the
howdah of the jong's own gantor. Cheering throngs lined the avenues
and it should have been a happy event, but it was not&mdash;not for
me, at least; for I was leaving these good friends, as I full
believed, forever and with little or no hope of attaining my
heart's desire. I shall not dwell further upon the sadness of that
leave-taking. The pall of it hung over me as I sailed out upon the
broad expanse of that vast and lonely ocean, nor did my spirits
lift until long after the distant mountains of Anlap had dropped
below the horizon; then I shook the mood from me as I looked with
eagerness toward the future and set my mind solely upon
success.</p>

<p>I had set a range of from ten to twenty days for the cruise to
Vepaja, depending, of course, upon the winds; but there was always
the possibility of missing the island entirely, notwithstanding the
fact that it was a continent in size, being some four thousand
miles long by fifteen hundred wide at its greatest width. Such a
supposition might seem ridiculous on Earth, but here conditions
were vastly different. Maps were inaccurate. Those available
indicated that Anlap was scarcely more than five hundred miles from
Vepaja, but I knew that at least fifteen hundred miles of ocean
must separate them. Duare and I had learned that when we had flown
it. The reason their maps must be inaccurate is due to their false
conception of the shape of the planet, which they believe to be a
flat disc floating on a sea of molten rock, and their further
belief that the antarctic region forms the periphery and what I
knew to be the equator, the center of the disc. This naturally
distorts every possible conception of the shape and size of oceans
and land masses. These people in the southern hemisphere of Venus
have not the remotest idea of the existence of the northern
hemisphere.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
I shall not inflict upon you the monotony of the first week of that
journey. The wind held steady, and at night I lashed the tiller and
slept with a comparatively peaceful mind, as I had devised an alarm
that sounded whenever the boat deviated from its course a certain
number of points. It was a simple device electrically controlled by
the needle of the compass. I was not awakened on an average of two
or three times in a night; so I felt that I was keeping fairly well
on my course; but I wished that I knew what, if anything, the
currents were doing to me.</p>

<p>Since the coast of Anlap had dropped below the horizon I had
seen no land, nor had a single ship appeared upon that vast watery
expanse of loneliness. The waters often teemed with fish; and
occasionally I saw monstrous creatures of the deep, some of which
defy description and would challenge belief. The most numerous of
these larger creatures must attain a length of fully a thousand
feet. It has a wide mouth and huge, protruding eyes between which a
smaller eye is perched upon a cylindrical shaft some fifteen feet
above its head. The shaft is erectile; and when the creature is at
rest upon the surface or when it is swimming normally beneath, it
reclines along its back; but when alarmed or searching for food,
the shaft springs erect. It also functions as a periscope as the
beast swims a few feet beneath the surface. The Amtorians call it a
rotik, meaning three-eye. When I first saw one I thought it an
enormous ocean liner as it lay on the surface of the ocean in the
distance.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
At dawn of the eighth day I saw the one thing that I could have
wished least of all to see&mdash;a ship; for no ship that sailed
the Amtorian seas could conceivably contain any friends of mine,
unless, perhaps the Sofal was still carrying on its piratical trade
with the crew that had followed me so loyally in the mutiny that
had given me command of it. That, however, was doubtful. The vessel
was some distance to starboard and was moving in an easterly
direction. Within an hour it would cross my course, which was due
south. Hoping to avoid detection because of the insignificant size
of my little craft, I lowered my sails and drifted. For half an
hour the ship held to its course; then its bow swung in my
direction. I had been sighted.</p>

<p>It was a small vessel of about the tonnage of the Sofal, and
very similar in appearance. It had no masts, sails, stacks, nor
funnels. Aft were two oval deck houses, a small one resting on top
of a larger. On top of the upper house was an oval tower surmounted
by a small crow's nest. At bow and stern and from the crow's nest
rose staffs from which long pennons flew. The main staff, above the
crow's nest, was supposed to fly the flag of the country to which
the ship belonged; the flag at the bow, the city from which it
sailed; the stern flag was usually the house flag of the owner. In
the case of warships, his staff carried the battle flag of the
nation to which it belonged. As the ship neared me, I saw but one
thing&mdash;a ship without country or city was a faltar, a pirate
ship. The flag at the stern was probably the personal flag of the
captain. Of all the disasters that could have befallen me, this was
about the worst, that I should run foul of a pirate ship; but there
was nothing to do about it. I could not escape. As I had thought it
best to wear my black wig through the streets of Sanara on my way
to the boat, I still had it with me; and as my yellow hair had only
partially grown out and as I had a black-tipped mane reaching from
forehead to nape, I put the wig on now rather than take the chance
that my weird coiffure might arouse suspicion aboard the pirate
craft.</p>

<p>As the ship came close, it lay to. I saw its name painted along
the bow in the strange Amtorian characters&mdash;Nojo Ganja. Fully
a hundred men lined the port rail watching me, as were several
officers upon the upper decks of the houses. One of the latter
hailed me.</p>

<p>"Come alongside," he shouted, "and come aboard."</p>

<p>It was not an invitation&mdash;it was a command. There was
nothing to do but obey; so I raised one sail and brought my craft
under the lee rail of the pirate. They tossed me a rope which I
made fast to the bow and another with knots in it up which I
climbed to the deck; then several of them slid down into my boat
and passed every thing in it up to their fellows above. After that,
they cut my boat adrift and got under way. All this I saw from an
upper deck where I had been taken to be questioned by the
captain.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am called Sofal," I said. Sofal was the name of my pirate
ship and means "the killer."</p>

<p>"Sofal!" he repeated, a little ironically I thought. "And from
what country do you hail? and what are you doing out here in the
middle of the ocean in a small boat like that?"</p>

<p>"I have no country," I replied. "My father was a faltargan, and
I was born on a faltar." I was rapidly becoming a proficient liar,
I who had always prided myself on my veracity; but I think a man is
sometimes justified in lying, especially if it saves a life. Now
the word faltargan has an involved derivation. <i>Faltar</i>,
pirate ship, derives from <i>ganfal</i>, criminal (which is derived
from <i>gan</i>, man, and <i>fal</i>, kill) and <i>notar</i>,
ship&mdash;roughly criminal ship. Add <i>gan</i>, man, to
<i>faltar</i>, and you have pirate-ship-man, or pirate;
fal-tr'gn.</p>

<p>"And so I suppose you are a pirate," he said, "and that that
thing down there is your faltar."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "and yes; but, rather, yes and no."</p>

<p>"What are you driving at?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a pirate; but no, that is not a faltar. It is just a
fishing boat. I am surprised that an old sailor should have thought
it a pirate ship."</p>

<p>"You have a loose tongue, fellow," he snapped.</p>

<p>"And you have a loose head," I retorted; "that is why you need a
man like me as one of your officers. I have captained my own
faltar, and I know my trade. From what I have seen, you haven't
enough officers to handle a bunch of cut-throats such as I saw on
deck. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say you ought to be thrown overboard," he growled. "Go to the
deck and report to Folar. Tell him I said to put you to work. An
officer! Cut out my liver! but you have got nerve! If you make a
good sailor, I'll let you live. That's the best you'll get, though.
Loose head!" and I could hear him grumbling as I went down the
companionway to the deck.</p>

<p>I don't know just why I had deliberately tried to antagonize
him, unless it was that I had felt that if I cringed before him he
would have been more likely to have felt contempt for me and killed
me. I was not unfamiliar with men of his type. If you stand up to
them they respect and, perhaps, fear you, for most swashbucklers
are, at heart, yellow.</p>

<p>When I reached the deck I had an opportunity to inspect my
fellow sailors more closely. They were certainly a prize
aggregation of villainous-looking scoundrels. They eyed me with
suspicion and dislike and not a little contempt, as they appraised
my rich apparel and handsome weapons which seemed to them to
bespeak the dandy rather than the fighting man.</p>

<p>"Where is Folar?" I asked of the first group I approached.</p>

<p>"There, ortij oolja," he replied in an assumed falsetto, as he
pointed to a huge bear of a man who was glowering at me a few yards
away.</p>

<p>Those within earshot guffawed at this witticism&mdash;ortij
oolja means <i>my love</i>. Evidently they thought my apparel
effeminate. I had to smile a little myself, as I walked over to
Folar.</p>

<p>"The captain told me to report to you for duty," I said.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" he demanded, "and what do you think you can
do aboard a ship like the Nojo Ganja?"</p>

<p>"My name is Sofal," I replied, "and I can do anything aboard
ship or ashore that you can do, and do it better."</p>

<p>"Ho! ho!" he pretended to laugh, "The Killer! Listen, brothers,
here is The Killer, and he can do anything better than I can!"</p>

<p>"Let's see him kill you, then," cried a voice from behind
him.</p>

<p>Folar wheeled about. "Who said that?" he demanded, but nobody
answered.</p>

<p>Again a voice from behind him said, "You're afraid of him, you
sailful of wind." It seemed to me that Folar was not popular. He
completely lost his temper then, over which he appeared to have no
control whatsoever; and whipped out his sword. Without giving me an
opportunity to draw, he swung a vicious cut at me that would have
decapitated me had it connected. I leaped back in time to avoid it;
and before he could recover, I had drawn my own weapon; then we
settled down to business, as the men formed a circle around us. As
we measured one another's strength and skill in the first few
moments of the encounter, I heard such remarks as, "Folar will cut
the fool to pieces," "He hasn't a chance against Folar&mdash;I wish
he had," and "Kill the mistal, fellow; we're for you."</p>

<p>Folar was no swordsman; he should have been a butcher. He swung
terrific cuts that would have killed a gantor, could he have
landed; but he couldn't land, and he telegraphed his every move. I
knew what he was going to do before he started to do it. Every time
he cut, he left himself wide open. I could have killed him any one
of half a dozen times in the first three minutes of our duel, but I
didn't wish to kill him. For all I knew he might be a favorite of
the captain, and I had already done enough to antagonize that
worthy. For the right moment to do the thing I wanted to do, I had
to bide my time. He rushed me about here and there dodging his
terrific swings until, at last, I got tired of it and pricked him
in the shoulder. He bellowed like a bull at that; and, seizing his
sword with both hands, came at me like a charging gantor. Then I
pricked him again; and after that he went more warily, for I guess
he had commenced to realize that I could kill him if I wished. Now
he gave me the opportunity I had been awaiting, and in an instant I
had disarmed him. As his weapon clattered to the deck, I stepped
in, my point at his heart.</p>

<p>"Shall I kill him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes!" rose in a thunderous chorus from the excited sailors.</p>

<p>I dropped my point. "No, I shall not kill him this time," I
said. "Now pick up your sword, Folar; and we'll call everything
square. What do you say?"</p>

<p>He mumbled something as he stooped to retrieve his weapon; then
he spoke to a one-eyed giant standing in the front row of
spectators.</p>

<p>"This fellow will be in your watch, Nurn," he said. "See that he
works." With that, he quit the deck.</p>

<p>The men gathered around me. "Why didn't you kill him?" asked
one.</p>

<p>"And have the captain order me thrown overboard?" I demanded.
"No. I can use my brains as well as my sword."</p>

<p>"Well," said Nurn, "there was at least a chance that he wouldn't
have; but there is no chance that Folar won't stab you in the back
the first chance he gets."</p>

<p>My duel with Folar had established me in the good graces of the
crew; and when they found that I could speak the language of the
sea and of the pirate ship, they accepted me as one of them. Nurn
seemed to take a special fancy to me. I think it was because he
hoped to inherit Folar's rank in the event the latter were killed,
for several times he suggested that I pick another quarrel with
Folar and kill him.</p>

<p>While talking with Nurn I asked him where the Nojo Ganja was
bound.</p>

<p>"We're trying to find Vepaja," he said. "We've been trying to
find it for a year."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to find it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We're looking for a man the Thorists want," he said. "They've
offered a million pandars to anyone who'll bring him to Kapdor
alive."</p>

<p>"Are you Thorists?" I asked. The Thorists are members of a
revolutionary political party that conquered the former empire of
Vepaja which once spread over a considerable portion of the south
temperate zone of Amtor. They are the bitter enemies of Mintep as
well as of all countries that have not fallen into their hands.</p>

<p>"No," replied Nurn, "we are not Thorists; but we could use a
million pandars of anybody's money."</p>

<p>"Who is this Vepajan they want so badly?" I asked. I assumed
that it was Mintep.</p>

<p>"Oh, a fellow who killed one of their ongyans in Kapdor. His
name is Carson."</p>

<p>So! The long arm of Thora had reached out after me. I was
already in the clutches of its fingers; but, happily for me, I was
the only one who knew it. However, I realized that I must escape
from the Nojo Ganja before it touched at any Thoran port.</p>

<p>"How do you know this Carson is in Vepaja?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We don't know," replied Nurn. "He escaped from Kapdor with the
janjong of Vepaja. If they are alive, it is reasonable to believe
they are in Vepaja; that, of course, is where he would have taken
the janjong. We are going to search Vepaja first. If he isn't
there, we'll go back to Noobol and search inland."</p>

<p>"I should think that would be quite a man-size job," I
remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will," he admitted, "but he should be an easy man to
trace. Here and there inland someone must have seen him, and if
anyone once saw this Carson they'd never forget him. He has yellow
hair, and as far as anyone ever heard no one else in the world has
yellow hair." I was grateful for my black wig. I hoped it was on
securely.</p>

<p>"How are you going to get into the tree cities of Vepaja?" I
asked. "They don't care much for strangers there, you know."</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I've been there. I lived in Kooaad."</p>

<p>"You did? That's just where we expect to find Carson."</p>

<p>"Then maybe I can help," I suggested.</p>

<p>"I'll tell the captain. No one aboard has ever been to
Kooaad."</p>

<p>"But how do you expect to get into that city? You haven't told
me that. It's going to be very difficult."</p>

<p>"They'll probably let one man go in to trade," he said. "You
see, we've picked up a lot of jewels and ornaments off the ships
we've taken. A man could go in with some of these and if he kept
his ears and eyes open, he'd soon find out whether or not Carson
was there. If he is, we'll have to find some way to entice him
aboard the Nojo Ganja."</p>

<p>"That should be easy," I said.</p>

<p>Nurn shook his head. "I don't know about that," he said.</p>

<p>"It would be easy for me, knowing Kooaad as I do," I said. "You
see I have friends there."</p>

<p>"Well, first we've got to find Vepaja," he remarked quite
aptly.</p>

<p>"That's easy, too," I told him.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Go tell the captain that I can pilot him to Vepaja," I
said.</p>

<p>"You really can?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think I can. One never knows, what with the rotten maps
we have."</p>

<p>"I'll go now and talk with the captain," he said. "You wait here
and, say, keep a weather eye open for Folar&mdash;he's the
stinkingest mistal of all the stinking mistals on Amtor. Just keep
your back against something solid and your eyes open."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20" name="ch20">XX. &mdash; TO KOOAAD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">I WATCHED Nurn as he crossed the deck and ascended
the companionway leading to the captain's quarters. If the captain
could be persuaded to trust me, here was such an opportunity to
enter Kooaad as might never come to me again. I knew from the
course that the Nojo Ganja was holding that she was paralleling the
coast of Vepaja, but too far off shore for the land to be visible.
At least I was confident that such was true. I really could not
know it, as one could know nothing for certain about his position
on one of these Amtorian seas unless he were in sight of land.</p>

<p>As I stood by the rail waiting for Nurn to return, I saw Folar
come on deck. His expression was black as a thunder cloud. He came
directly toward me. A man near me said, "Look out, fellow! He's
going to kill you." Then I saw that Folar carried one hand behind
him and that his pistol holster was empty. I didn't wait then to
see what he was going to do or when he was going to do it. I knew.
I whipped out my own gun just as he raised his. We fired
simultaneously. I could feel the r-rays pinging past my ear; then I
saw Folar slump to the deck. Instantly a crowd surrounded me.</p>

<p>"You'll go overboard for this," said a man.</p>

<p>"It won't be as easy as that," said another, "but in the end
you'll go overboard."</p>

<p>An officer who had witnessed the affair came running down from
the upper deck house. He pushed his way through the crowd of
sailors to me.</p>

<p>"So you're trying to live up to your name, are you, fellow?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Folar was trying to kill him," spoke a sailor.</p>

<p>"And after he'd spared Folar's life," said another.</p>

<p>"Folar had a right to kill any member of the crew he wanted to
kill," snapped the officer. "You mistals know that as well as I do.
Take this fellow up to the captain and throw Folar overboard."</p>

<p>So I was taken up to the captain's quarters. He was still
talking with Nurn as I entered. "Here he is now," said Nurn.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the captain, rather decently; "I want to talk
with you."</p>

<p>The officer who had accompanied me looked rather surprised at
the captain's seemingly friendly manner. "This man has just killed
Folar," he blurted.</p>

<p>Nurn and the captain looked at me in astonishment. "What
difference does it make?" I asked. "He wasn't any good to you,
anyway, and he was just about to kill the only man who can pilot
you to Vepaja and get into the city of Kooaad for you. You ought to
thank me for killing him."</p>

<p>The captain looked up at the officer. "Why did he kill him?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The officer told the story quite fairly, I thought; and the
captain listened without comment until he had concluded; then he
shrugged.</p>

<p>"Folar," he said, "was a mistal. Someone should have killed him
long ago. You may go," he said to the officer and the sailors who
had brought me up; "I want to talk with this man." When they had
left, he turned to me. "Nurn says that you can pilot this ship to
Vepaja and that you are acquainted in Kooaad. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"I am well acquainted in Kooaad," I replied, "and I believe I
can pilot the Nojo Ganja to Vepaja. You will have to help me get
into Kooaad, though. I'll be all right after I get in."</p>

<p>"What course shall we take?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What is your course now?"</p>

<p>"Due east," he replied.</p>

<p>"Change it to south."</p>

<p>He shook his head, but he gave the necessary orders. I could see
that he was very skeptical of our chances of reaching Vepaja on the
new course. "How long before we'll raise land?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That, I can't tell," I said; "but I'd keep a sharp lookout, and
at night cut your speed down."</p>

<p>He dismissed me then, telling me that I'd be quartered with the
officers. I found my new companions little different from the
common sailors. They were all bravos and rascals; and, without
exception, had been common sailors themselves. I found little in
common with them, and spent most of my time in the crow's nest with
the lookout watching for land.</p>

<p>It was right after the 1st hour the next morning that I
discerned the black-appearing mass ahead that I knew to be the
giant forest of Vepaja, those mighty trees that rear their heads
five and six thousand feet to drink sustenance from the moisture of
the inner cloud envelope that surrounds the planet. Somewhere in
that black mass and a thousand feet above the ground was the great
tree city of Kooaad. There, too, if she still lived, would be my
Duare.</p>

<p>I went down to the captain's quarters myself to report sighting
land, and as I reached the door I heard voices. I would not have
stopped to listen; but the first word I heard was the name they
knew me by, Sofal. The captain was speaking to one of his
officers.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and when we are through with him, see that he's put out
of the way. Let the men know that it was because he killed Folar.
We can't let them think they can get away with anything like that.
If I hadn't needed him, I'd have had him killed yesterday."</p>

<p>I walked away as noiselessly as I could; and returned a moment
later, whistling. When I had reported land, they both came out. It
was plainly visible by now, and shortly after the 2nd hour we were
close in shore. We were a little too far east; so we came about and
skirted the coast until I sighted the harbor. In the meantime I had
suggested to the captain that he'd better lower his pirate flags
and fly something more in keeping with his purportedly peaceful
designs.</p>

<p>"What country are they friendly with?" he asked. "What far
country, whose ships and men they might not be expected to
recognize."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure that a ship from Korva would be welcomed," I
told him; so the Korvan flag was run up at the bow and above the
deck houses; while, for an owner's flag at the stern, he used one
he had taken from a ship he had sunk. There was already a ship in
the harbor, a vessel from one of the little islands that lie west
of Vepaja. It was loading up with tarel. There was a strong company
of Vepajan warriors on guard, for the port is quite some distance
from Kooaad; and there is always danger of attack by Thorists or
other enemies.</p>

<p>The captain sent me ashore to negotiate for entry into Kooaad as
well as to assure the Vepajans that we were there on a friendly
mission. I found the company in charge of two officers, both of
whom I had known when I lived in Kooaad. One was Tofar, who had
been captain of the palace guard and high in the confidence of
Mintep; the other was Olthar, brother of my best friend in Kooaad,
Kamlot. I fairly shook in my boots as I recognized them, for I did
not see how it could be possible that they should fail to know me.
However, as I stepped from the small-boat, I walked boldly toward
them. They looked me straight in the face without a sign of
recognition.</p>

<p>"What do you want in Vepaja?" they asked, their tones none too
friendly.</p>

<p>"We are trading with friendly countries," I said. "We are from
Korva."</p>

<p>"Korva!" they both exclaimed. "We had heard that the merchant
marine of Korva had been destroyed in the last war."</p>

<p>"Practically all of it," I said. "A few ships escaped because
they were on long cruises and knew nothing of the war until it was
over. Our ship was one of these."</p>

<p>"What have you to trade?" asked Tofar.</p>

<p>"Ornaments and jewels, principally," I replied. "I should like
to take them into one of your big cities. I think the ladies of the
jong's palace would like to see them."</p>

<p>He asked me if I had any with me; and when I showed him some
that I had brought along in my pocket pouch, he was much
interested; and desired to see more. I did not want to take him
aboard the Nojo Ganja for fear his suspicions might be aroused by
the ruffianly appearance of the officers and crew.</p>

<p>"When do you go back to the city?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We leave here as soon as they finish loading that ship," he
replied. "That should be within the hour; then we leave immediately
for Kooaad."</p>

<p>"I'll get all my articles," I told him, "and go to Kooaad with
you."</p>

<p>Olthar seemed rather taken aback by this, and looked
questioningly at Tofar. "Oh, I think it will be all right," said
the latter. "After all, he's only one man; and anyway he's from
Korva&mdash;that will make a difference with Mintep. He and the
janjong were well treated there. I have heard him speak in the
highest terms of the jong of Korva and the nobles he met
there."</p>

<p>I had difficulty in hiding my relief at this evidence that Duare
was alive and in Kooaad. But was she alive? She had evidently
reached Vepaja with her father, but she might already have been
destroyed for having broken the taboo custom had laid upon her as
janjong of Vepaja.</p>

<p>"You mention a janjong," I said. "I am glad to know that your
jong has a daughter. He will wish to buy some of my jewels for
her."</p>

<p>They made no reply, but I saw them exchange a quick glance.</p>

<p>"Go and get your stuff," Tofar said, "and we'll take you with us
when we return to Kooaad."</p>

<p>The captain was delighted when he found what excellent progress
I had made. "Try to persuade the man Carson to return to the ship
with you, if you find he is in Kooaad," he said.</p>

<p>"I shall certainly find him in Kooaad," I told him. "I am sure
of that."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
A half hour later I set out with Tofar, Olthar, and their company
through the great forest toward Kooaad. We had not gone far when
Olthar told me that I should have to be blind-folded, and after
that a soldier walked on either side of me to guide me and keep me
from stumbling over obstacles. Knowing as I did how jealously the
Vepajans have to guard the secret entrances to their tree cities I
was not at all surprised at this precaution, but I may say that it
made most awkward travelling. At last, however, we reached a spot
where I was conducted through a doorway; and after the door was
closed, the bandage was removed from my eyes. I found myself in the
hollow interior of a great tree, standing in a cage with Tofar,
Olthar, and some of the warriors. The others waited on the ground
beside the cage. A signal was given, and the cage started to rise.
For a thousand feet we were hoisted by a great windlass to the
street level of Kooaad. Once again I stood on the high-flung
walkways of the first Amtorian city I had ever seen. Somewhere near
me was Duare, if she still lived. I could feel my heart throb from
the excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>"Take me to the palace," I said to Tofar. "I should like to get
permission to show these beautiful things to the women of the
jong's retinue."</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "I'll see if we can get permission."</p>

<p>A short walk brought us to the enormous tree from the interior
of which the rooms of the palace of Mintep are carved. How familiar
it all was! How it recalled my first days on Venus, and that day of
days that I had first seen Duare and first loved her. Now I was
coming again to the palace of her father, but with a price upon my
head.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the palace was the familiar guard. I knew the
captain of it well, but he did not recognize me. When Tofar stated
my request, the captain entered the palace, telling us to wait. He
was gone for some time, but when he returned he said that Mintep
would be glad to welcome a Korvan merchant to his palace.</p>

<p>"He has sent word to the women that you will show your wares in
the reception room inside the entrance," said the captain. "They
will be gathering there soon; so you might as well come in."</p>

<p>"I'll leave him with you, then," said Tofar.</p>

<p>I reached into my package and selected a jeweled ring, which I
proffered to Tofar. "Please accept this for your kindness to me," I
said, "and take it to your woman with my compliments."</p>

<p>If he had only known that Carson Napier&mdash;Carson of
Venus&mdash;was the donor!</p>

<p>The women of the palace gathered in the reception room, and I
spread my jewels and ornaments out before them. I had known many of
them and most of the men who came with them or followed them in to
see what I had to offer, but not a one knew me.</p>

<p>There was one particularly lovely girl whom I knew to have been
very close to Duare, one of her ladies-in-waiting, in fact; and her
I sought to draw into conversation. She was much interested in one
piece, but said that she could not afford to buy anything so
expensive.</p>

<p>"But your man," I said. "Certainly he will buy it for you."</p>

<p>"I have no man," she said. "I serve the janjong, and I may have
no man until she takes one; or until she dies." Her voice broke
with a sob.</p>

<p>"Take it," I whispered. "I have sold many already. I can easily
spare this piece; then, when I come again, if you can, you may pay
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I couldn't do that," she cried, a little startled.</p>

<p>"Please," I begged. "It will make me very happy to know that
this lovely piece, which I myself so much admire, has a setting
worthy of its beauty."</p>

<p>I could see that she wanted it very badly, and when a woman
wants a piece of jewelry or apparel, she will stop at little to
possess it.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, after a pause, during which she fondled and
admired the bauble, "I suppose I might pay you some time; and if I
couldn't, I could give it back to you."</p>

<p>"I am glad that you have decided to keep it," I said. "I have
another piece here that I should like very much to show to the
janjong. Do you suppose it would be possible?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said. "That would be quite impossible; and anyway,
she&mdash;she&mdash;" Again her voice broke.</p>

<p>"She is in trouble?" I asked.</p>

<p>She nodded. "She is going to die!" She spoke in an awed
whisper.</p>

<p>"Die?" I asked. "Why?"</p>

<p>"The council of nobles has so decreed."</p>

<p>"You love her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. I would give my life for her."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that?" I demanded.</p>

<p>She looked at me in surprise. I had let my emotions get the
better of my caution.</p>

<p>"Why do you take such an interest?" she asked.</p>

<p>I looked at her for a full minute, I guess, trying to read her
soul through her eyes. I could see nothing in them but truth and
sincerity and love&mdash;love for my Duare.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell you why," I said. "I am going to trust you.
I am going to put my life in your hands and the life of your
janjong as well. I am Carson Napier&mdash;Carson of Venus."</p>

<p>Her eyes went wide and she caught her breath. She looked at me
for a long time. "Yes," she said, "I see now; but you have changed
so."</p>

<p>"Suffering and a black wig make a big change in one's
appearance," I said. "I have come here to save Duare. Will you help
me?"</p>

<p>"I told you once I would give my life for her," she said. "That
was no idle speech. What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"I want you to get me into Duare's quarters in some way and hide
me there. That is all I ask of you."</p>

<p>She thought for a moment. "I have a plan," she said, presently.
"Gather up your things and prepare to leave. Say that you will
return tomorrow."</p>

<p>I did as she bid, making several sales at the same time. I told
the purchasers that I would take payment when I came back the next
day. I almost smiled when I thought of the rage of the pirate
captain could he have known that I was giving his treasure away.
When I had at last gathered up what remained, I started toward the
door. Then Vejara, the lady-in-waiting, spoke to me in a voice that
all might hear.</p>

<p>"Before you go," she said, "I wish that you would bring your
things to the anteroom of my apartments. I have a piece of jewelry
which I should like to match if possible. I think I saw something
of yours that would answer."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said, "I'll come with you now;" so we walked out
of the reception room, and she led me along corridors to a door
which she opened with a key, after glancing quickly around to see
if we had been observed.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she whispered. "In here. These are the apartments of
the janjong. She is alone. I have done all that I can. Goodby and
good luck!"</p>

<p>She closed the door after me and locked it. I found myself in a
very small waiting room, empty but for two long benches, one on
either side. Later I learned that it was where servants waited to
be interviewed by the janjong. I crossed to a door at the opposite
end and opened it quietly. Before me was a beautifully furnished
apartment. On a divan, reading, was a woman. It was Duare. I
entered the room, and as I did so she turned and looked at me. Her
eyes went wide with incredulity as she sprang to her feet and faced
me; then she ran and threw herself into my arms. Of all, she alone
had known me!</p>

<p>Neither of us could speak for a full minute; and then, though
there was so much to say, I would not let her speak of but one
thing, nor would I&mdash;a plan of escape.</p>

<p>"It will be simple, now that you are here," she said. "The
council of nobles has condemned me to die. I suppose they could do
nothing else. They do not wish my death. They are all my friends,
but the laws that govern the jongs of Vepaja are stronger than
friendship or their love for me or anything in the
world&mdash;except my love for you and yours for me. They will be
glad if I escape, for they have done their duty. My father will be
glad, too."</p>

<p>"But not the jong of Vepaja," I said.</p>

<p>"I think he will be a little glad also," she said.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you have escaped without me, if it is so easy to
escape?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because I have given my word not to violate my arrest," she
replied. "But I cannot help it if someone takes me by force."</p>

<p>She was very serious, and so I did not smile&mdash;outwardly.
Duare is very sweet.</p>

<p>We talked then and planned until after dark. When her food was
brought, she hid me; and then she shared it with me. We waited
until the city had quieted down; then she came close to me. "You
will have to carry me out of my quarters," she said, "for I may not
go of my own free will."</p>

<p>In the palace there is a secret shaft down the interior of the
great tree to the ground. There is no lift there&mdash;only a very
long and tiresome climb down a ladder. It was never intended to be
used except in emergencies of life and death, and only the jong and
his family know of its existence. Down this we clambered. I thought
that we should never reach the ground, but at last we did.</p>

<p>Duare had told me that she had fastened the ship down not far
from this tree, which is close to the edge of the forest. If it
were still there, and unharmed, our escape would be assured. If it
were not, we were lost. That was a chance we had to take, for Duare
was to have died on the morrow. There was no time for me to
investigate.</p>

<p>Leaving the base of the tree we groped our way through the
darkness, constantly fearful of attack by one of the terrible
beasts that roam the Vepajan forest. When I finally thought that we
must have missed the anotar in the darkness, or that it had been
taken away, I saw it looming in front of us; and I am not ashamed
to admit that tears came to my eyes as I realized that my Duare was
safe at last&mdash;safe and with me.</p>

<p>A few minutes later we zoomed into the Amtorian sky; and,
leveling off, turned the nose of the ship out over the grey
Amtorian sea toward the northwest and the kingdom of
Korva&mdash;our kingdom. Toward peace and happiness and friends and
love.</p>
