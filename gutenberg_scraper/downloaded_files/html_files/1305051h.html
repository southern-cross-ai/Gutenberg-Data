  <h2><a name="ch-01"
     id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM MAITLAND tilted his top-hat a little farther back on his
  head, and lit a cigarette. In front of him twinkled the myriad lights of
  London; behind the door he had just closed twinkled the few candles that had
  not yet guttered out. The Bright Young Things liked candles stuck in empty
  bottles as their illuminations.</p>

  <p>The hour was two of a summer's morning; the scene&mdash;somewhere in
  Hampstead. And as he walked down the steps into the drive he pondered for the
  twentieth time on the asininity of man&mdash;himself in particular. Why on
  earth had he ever allowed that superlative idiot Percy to drag him to such a
  fool performance?</p>

  <p>Percy was his cousin, a point he endeavoured unsuccessfully to forget. In
  fact the only thing to be said in favour of Percy's continued existence was
  that since he embodied in his person every known form of fatuitousness, he
  might be regarded as doing duty for the rest of the family.</p>

  <p>He had seen Percy afar off in the club before dinner, and with a strangled
  grunt of terror had fled into the cloak-room only to realise a moment later
  that he had delivered himself bound hand and foot into the enemy's hands. For
  the cloak-room was a cul-de-sac, and already a strange bleating cry could be
  heard outside the entrance. Percy had spotted him, and relinquishing the idea
  of burying himself in the dirty towel basket he prepared to meet his
  fate.</p>

  <p>"Jim, my dear old friend and relative, you are the very bird I want. When
  did you return to the village?"</p>

  <p>He gazed dispassionately at his cousin through his eyeglass, and a slight
  shudder shook him.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Percy," he remarked. "I hoped you hadn't seen me. Are you still as
  impossibly awful as you were when I last met you?"</p>

  <p>"Worse, far worse, old lad. We dine together&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>Another shudder shook him; short of physical violence all hope was gone.
  He was in the clutches of this throw back to the tail period.</p>

  <p>"But for the fact that I adore your dear mother nothing would induce me to
  dine anywhere near you," he answered. "As it is I happen to be free, so I
  will."</p>

  <p>"Splendid. And afterwards I shall take you to a gathering of the
  chaps."</p>

  <p>"What chaps?"</p>

  <p>"You'll love 'em, old fruit. We have one once a month. Starts about
  midnight. Just a rag, don't you know. We're meeting this time in a cellar up
  in Hampstead. Beer and bones. Or perhaps scrambled eggs. Or even kippers.
  Except that kippers whiff a bit in a cellar, don't they?"</p>

  <p>He suffered Percy to lead him to the dining-room, and as he looked round
  the familiar room it seemed impossible that it was more than five years since
  he had last been in it. A new face or two amongst the waiters&mdash;though
  not amongst the senior ones, they were all there; a few new faces, of course,
  amongst the members; otherwise it might have been yesterday that he was
  dining there with Terence Ogilvy and Teddy Burchaps preparatory to their
  departure for the interior of Brazil. And of the three of them only he had
  returned....</p>

  <p>"You're looking very fit, sir."</p>

  <p>He glanced up to find the wine steward standing by the table.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Soames, I am. And you?"</p>

  <p>"Much the same, sir. There is still some of the Lafite vintage wine
  left."</p>

  <p>Good old Soames! Remembering that after five years. And yet&mdash;why not?
  That was life; to him a member's taste in wine was a thing of paramount
  importance. Especially, though he did not add this mentally, when the member
  was Jim Maitland.</p>

  <p>That he was a sort of legendary hero in the club, was a fact of which Jim
  was completely ignorant. And had anyone hinted at it he would either have
  been annoyed or else roared with laughter. To him a journey to the interior
  of Turkestan came as naturally as one to Brighton comes to the ordinary man.
  He had been born with wanderlust in his bones; and being sufficiently endowed
  with this world's goods to avoid the necessity of working for a living, he
  had followed his bent ever since he left Oxford.</p>

  <p>And the result, had he known it, would have surprised him. For it was not
  only in the club that a glamour lay round his name, but in a hundred odd
  places fringing the seven seas. Anywhere, in fact, where the men who do
  things are gathered together, you will sooner or later hear his name
  mentioned. And if some of the stories grow in the telling it is hardly to be
  wondered at, though in all conscience the originals are good enough without
  any embroidery.</p>

  <p>Talk to deep-sea sailors from Shanghai to Valparaiso; talk to cattlemen on
  the <i>estancias</i> of the Argentine and after a while, casually introduce
  his name. Then you will know what I mean.</p>

  <p>"Jim Maitland! The guy with a pane of glass in his eye. But if you take my
  advice, stranger, you won't mention it to him. Sight! his sight is better'n
  yourn or mine. I reckons he keeps that window there so that he can just find
  trouble when he's bored. He's got a left like a steam hammer, and he can
  shoot the pip out of the ace of diamonds at twenty yards. A dangerous man,
  son, to run up against, but I'd sooner have him on my side than any other
  three I've yet met."</p>

  <p>Thus do they speak of him in the lands that lie off the beaten track, the
  man with a taste for Château Lafite. And as he sat sipping his wine, warmed
  to the exact temperature by the paragon Soames, there came the glint of a
  smile into his eyes. Dimly he was aware that near at hand the impossible
  Percy was drivelling on, but it seemed as far removed from him as the buzzing
  of an insect outside a mosquito curtain. White tie, white waistcoat, boiled
  shirt&mdash;and six weeks ago...London: the solidity, the respectability of
  his club&mdash;and six weeks ago...</p>

  <p>"Have you ever hit a man on the base of the skull with a full bottle of
  French vermouth, Percy?" he said suddenly. "I suppose you haven't. You'd wait
  for an introduction, wouldn't you, before taking such a liberty?"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you've heard a word I've said, Jim," answered his cousin
  plaintively.</p>

  <p>"I haven't, thank God! I heard a continuous droning noise somewhere: was
  that you?"</p>

  <p>"Are you coming to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Coming where?"</p>

  <p>"I knew you hadn't been listening. To this meeting of the chaps in
  Hampstead."</p>

  <p>"Nothing would induce me to. I don't want to see them, and they don't want
  to see me."</p>

  <p>"But they do, dear old lad. I've told 'em about you, and they're all
  simply crazy to meet you."</p>

  <p>"What have you told 'em about me?"</p>

  <p>"All sorts of things. You see, I sort of swore I'd bring you along the
  first possible chance I had, and what could be fairer than this?"</p>

  <p>And in the end Jim Maitland had allowed himself to be persuaded. Though he
  ragged him unmercifully for the good of his soul, he was really quite fond of
  his cousin: moreover, he was possessed of a genuine curiosity to gaze upon
  the post-war young in bulk. Since 1918 he had spent exactly seven months in
  England, so that his knowledge of the genus was confined to what he had read
  in books.</p>

  <p>Presumably they were much the same as the young have ever been <i>au
  fond</i>. Only conditions to-day afforded them so much more freedom.
  Certainly the lad Percy could drive a motor-car all right, he reflected. He
  had one of the big Bentleys. Providence in the shape of a defunct aunt of
  doubtful sanity endowed him with more money than he knew what to do with. But
  he drove it magnificently, and Jim Maitland was a man who loathed
  inefficiency.</p>

  <p>The traffic was thinning as they spun across Oxford Street, and Percy who
  had been silent for nearly five minutes began to give tongue again. He
  rattled off a string of names&mdash;the blokes, as he called them, who would
  probably be there. And then he paused suddenly.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! That reminds me. I wonder if she'll roll up. The last of these
  shows I went to," he explained, "a girl beetled in who was a new one on me.
  Came with Pamela Greystone and her bunch. And I happened to be talking about
  you at the time. Well, as soon as this wench heard that you knew something
  about South America she was all over it."</p>

  <p>"I should think there must be quite a number of people who know something
  about South America," said Jim, mildly sarcastic.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I was telling 'em, you see, that you knew all about the
  interior."</p>

  <p>"All about the interior!" Jim laughed. "My dear old Percy, draw it
  mild."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, she's damned keen to meet you. Got a brother out there or
  something."</p>

  <p>"As long as she doesn't feel certain that I must have met him as we were
  both out there at the same time, I can bear it. What's her name, by the
  way?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't an earthly, old lad. As far as I remember, Pamela called her
  Judy. But I'm not even certain about that. Here we are!"</p>

  <p>They drew up in front of a largish house standing in its own grounds. Half
  a dozen other cars were already there, and two more were in the drive. A
  large notice board proclaimed that the place was for sale, and Jim remarked
  on it to his cousin.</p>

  <p>"Been for sale for months, old lad. Belongs to the father of one of our
  push, and he lets us use it. Let's get in: there's most of 'em here
  already."</p>

  <p>He approached the front door and knocked twice, upon which the top of the
  letter-box was lifted.</p>

  <p>"Pink Gin with guest," said Percy.</p>

  <p>"Pass Pink Gin and guest," answered a voice, and the door opened.</p>

  <p>"To prevent gate crashing," explained Percy solemnly. "We have a different
  pass-word each time, and it's always the name of some drink."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Jim gravely. "A most necessary precaution. What do we do
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Go below to the cellar and drink beer."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," remarked Jim. "But why the cellar?"</p>

  <p>"My dear old lad, why not?"</p>

  <p>With which unanswerable remark Percy led the way.</p>

  <p>The cellar was a big room, and Jim looked round him curiously. Some thirty
  people were there, and every one of them seemed to be talking at the top of
  their voices. The air was blue with cigarette smoke, and a strong aroma of
  kipper smote the nostrils.</p>

  <p>"That's the filly I was telling you about, Jim," said Percy in his ear.
  "The girl in grey over there in the corner."</p>

  <p>She was talking to two men, one of whom was evidently a licensed buffoon;
  and Jim glanced at her idly. Then once again his gaze travelled round the
  room. It all seemed very harmless, and very uncomfortable, and rather stupid.
  Why a large number of presumably wealthy young people should elect to sit in
  a cellar in Hampstead and drink beer, when they could have done so in comfort
  anywhere else they liked, defeated him.</p>

  <p>He realised that Percy was introducing him to various girls, and he
  grinned amiably. Now that he had come he had better make the best of it. And
  then suddenly he found himself looking into a pair of level blue
  eyes&mdash;eyes with a faintly mocking challenge in them. The buffoon had
  drifted away: for the moment the girl in grey and he were alone.</p>

  <p>"And what," she remarked, "brings the celebrated Jim Maitland into this
  galaxy?"</p>

  <p>"Curiosity," he answered simply. "But why, in Heaven's name,
  celebrated?"</p>

  <p>"Our little Percy has insisted so long and so often that you are, that
  we've got to believe him in common politeness. Well&mdash;what do you think
  of it?"</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I think it's all rather childish," he said. "Does it really
  amuse you?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It's a change," she answered. "Let's go into that corner and sit down. I
  want to talk to you. Rescue some cushions from somewhere."</p>

  <p>He studied her thoughtfully as she sat down with legs tucked under her. A
  slightly tip-tilted nose; a complexion, unaided as far as he could see, that
  only the word Perfect could do justice to: a slim, delicious figure. Her
  hands were capable but beautifully kept: her hair clung tightly to a boyish
  head.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said calmly, "do you approve?"</p>

  <p>He smiled: said as she said it the remark rang natural.</p>

  <p>"Entirely," he answered. "But before we go any further, has it occurred to
  you that the egregious Percy has omitted the small formality of telling me
  your name."</p>

  <p>"Draycott. Judy Draycott."</p>

  <p>She took a cigarette from her case, and Jim held a match for her.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Mr. Maitland, are we very different to the pre-war vintage?"</p>

  <p>"That's rather a poser," he said, sitting down beside her. "You see, I've
  been so little in England since the war that I'm not a very good judge."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;this." She waved her hand at the room.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he laughed, "what has this got to do with it? This is
  nothing: a tiny symptom in a tiny set."</p>

  <p>"You know you are of what I always call the lost generation," she said.
  "What Daddy would call the senior subaltern brand."</p>

  <p>He stared at her in silence, a little nonplussed by her serious tone.</p>

  <p>"You were our age just before the war," she went on, "and you're still
  young enough to play. But there are so few of you left."</p>

  <p>"True," he said gravely. "I suppose my contemporaries took it worst."</p>

  <p>"There are the old people, and there are us. But the connecting link has
  gone&mdash;you and yours."</p>

  <p>"The lost generation," he repeated slowly. "A nice idea&mdash;that."</p>

  <p>"And that's why I asked you what you thought of us," she said. "You are
  one of the few who are qualified to judge."</p>

  <p>He lit another cigarette before replying.</p>

  <p>"Am I? I wonder. One can see changes&mdash;naturally, but who am I to say
  whether they are for the better or for the worse. This show, for instance.
  Frankly, I can't quite see this happening twenty years ago. Nor did everyone
  call everyone else 'darling' on sight."</p>

  <p>"Trifles," she said impatiently. "Just trifles. What about the big
  things?"</p>

  <p>"I should say," he answered without hesitation, "no change. Different
  methods, perhaps: different ways of doing them&mdash;but, in the end, the
  same."</p>

  <p>"You don't think we're softer than you were?"</p>

  <p>"I think this age is more comfort loving, undoubtedly, if that's what you
  mean. But that, I suppose, is only natural in view of the advance of science.
  Then one hacked to a meet&mdash;now one goes in a car."</p>

  <p>"But are we as keen on adventure?"</p>

  <p>Jim laughed.</p>

  <p>"Adventure! Where is adventure to be found these days?"</p>

  <p>"You ought to know," she said, "if half the stories I've heard about you
  are true."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm a hard-bitten case," he answered. "But I can assure you
  that even I have noticed the difference in the last few years. Everything is
  getting far too quiet."</p>

  <p>"Even in South America?" she asked.</p>

  <p>South America! Percy's remark came back to him, and he wondered what was
  coming next. This, apparently, was what she had been leading up to.</p>

  <p>"You can get a bit of fun out there at times," he said lightly. "But then
  if one looked for it I dare say one could get it in London."</p>

  <p>"What sort of people are they?"</p>

  <p>He laughed again.</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Draycott," he said, "they vary as much as the inhabitants of
  Europe. But by your question I assume you mean the brand that we generally
  lump together as dagos. Well&mdash;just like every other breed, you will find
  all sorts and conditions. I have excellent&mdash;very excellent friends
  amongst them. But they are people who require careful handling. For instance,
  there is one thing you must never do to a dago, unless you know him extremely
  well. Never pull his leg. He doesn't understand it: he takes it as an insult.
  There's another thing too. You stick a knife into one&mdash;or shoot him
  up&mdash;and he'll understand it. You hit him with your fist on the jaw and
  he'll never forgive you."</p>

  <p>"Are they very quick with a knife?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Very&mdash;and with a gun. Moreover, they will shoot on the smallest
  provocation. You'll understand, of course, that I'm not talking about the
  vast majority of them, who are perfectly harmless people. But to show you
  what I mean about the minority I'll tell you a thing I saw with my own eyes.
  It was in Buenos Aires about seven years ago, and a <i>festa</i> was in
  progress. Streets crammed with people and cars: the whole place <i>en
  fête</i>. I was on the side walk, and a motor-car alongside me was being held
  up by a man who was standing just in front of the mudguard. So the driver
  sang out to him to move. He didn't, and after a while the driver very slowly
  drove forward, and hit the man a glancing blow on the leg. Now it was a blow
  that wouldn't have hurt a fly: it didn't even make the man stumble. But what
  happened next? As the driver came abreast of the man, he calmly stepped on to
  the running-board, drew his gun and blew out the driver's brains. And this,
  mark you, with the wife in the back of the car."</p>

  <p>"But didn't they arrest the murderer?" cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"Not a hope," said Jim. "He just vanished into the crowd. No&mdash;they
  want watching, especially if they've got a drop too much liquor on
  board."</p>

  <p>He pressed out his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Is it permitted to ask why you are so interested in South America?"</p>

  <p>For a moment or two she hesitated, staring in front of her. Then she
  turned to him.</p>

  <p>"I am almost tempted to use that stereotyped beginning, Mr. Maitland, and
  ask you not to laugh at me."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll make the stereotyped reply and assure you that I shan't," he
  said quietly.</p>

  <p>"I've got a brother," she went on, "a twin brother. Arthur is his name.
  And for the past two years he's been knocking about in South America. Brazil,
  Uruguay, and the Argentine. Now I know that must seem very small beer to
  you&mdash;I mean I don't think he's been much off the beaten track. But at
  any rate he's been out there, cutting away from this."</p>

  <p>"Has he been on a job?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"He went out there to start with for a big oil firm. Quite a good salary.
  And of course Daddy allows him something. But after two or three months he
  found he couldn't stick it&mdash;his manager was a swine&mdash;so he chucked
  it. Since then he's been drifting about."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Jim quietly. Only too many youngsters had he met drifting
  about on something allowed by Daddy, and the brand did not inspire him with
  confidence. Then feeling that his remark had been a little too curt, he
  added&mdash;"It's difficult to get jobs out there&mdash;jobs that are any
  good, that is&mdash;unless a man is an expert. And it's a devilish expensive
  place to drift in."</p>

  <p>"I know it is," she answered. "Arthur often wrote me to say how fearfully
  difficult he found it. At any rate he managed to carry on, until he had the
  most amazing piece of luck about six months ago. And now I'm coming to where
  I'm afraid you may laugh."</p>

  <p>"Risk it," said Jim with a smile.</p>

  <p>"If I'd known you were coming this evening I'd have brought his letter,
  but I think I can remember all that matters. It seems that he did some
  kindness to a broken-down sailor in Monte Video&mdash;an Englishman. And this
  sailor on his deathbed told him some wonderful story of buried treasure."</p>

  <p>Jim's face remained expressionless, though this was worse than he had
  expected.</p>

  <p>"I hope he didn't part with any money for it," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd take it that way," she cried. "I did myself when I first
  read it. But he didn't pay anything: the sailor gave him the whole secret.
  And, anyway, he'd only got his allowance: he had no capital to give
  away."</p>

  <p>"What is the secret?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"That I don't know," she said. "He wrote something about a map, and
  fitting out an expedition, and from that moment I never heard another word
  till three weeks ago when I got a letter saying he was coming home by the
  next boat. He also said that if anything should happen to him I should find a
  letter addressed to me at my bank."</p>

  <p>"If anything happened to him," repeated Jim thoughtfully. "Have you been
  to the bank to enquire?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was actually in there this morning, and there was nothing."</p>

  <p>"Then everything seems plain sailing, Miss Draycott. Presumably nothing
  has happened to him, and if you got his letter three weeks ago he ought to be
  in England by now. And as soon as you see him you'll be able to get the whole
  story."</p>

  <p>"I know. But it is there that I wondered if you could help."</p>

  <p>She looked at him appealingly.</p>

  <p>"Me! I shall be delighted. But how?"</p>

  <p>"By going into the whole thing with him, and telling him what you think.
  You know so much more than he does, Mr. Maitland, and if there's anything in
  it, it would be wonderful if we could have your advice."</p>

  <p>For a while he hesitated: then he looked her straight in the face.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to be perfectly frank, Miss Draycott," he said. "The story, as
  you've told it to me, is, not to mince words, as old as the hills. From time
  immemorial drunken seamen have babbled in their cups of treasure
  trove&mdash;gold ingots, diamonds, and all the rest of the paraphernalia.
  Generally, too, they have a roughly-scrawled map, with, as often as not, a
  skull and cross bones in the corner to make it more realistic. In fact the
  one point in which this story differs from the others is that he did not
  apparently touch your brother for money. Had he done that I should have
  advised you to dismiss the whole thing from your mind at once."</p>

  <p>"You don't think there is anything in it, then," she said
  despondently.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be brutal," he answered with a smile, "but I fear that is
  my opinion. I'm not going to deny that there must be treasure&mdash;probably
  priceless treasure&mdash;hidden away in odd parts of the globe: relics of the
  old pirate days. I'm not going to deny that the Spanish Main, and the coast
  of South America are very likely localities for the hiding-places. But what I
  do feel doubtful about is the likelihood of a down-and-out seaman in Monte
  Video knowing anything about it, or getting the clue to its whereabouts."</p>

  <p>"But as you said yourself he took no money," she persisted.</p>

  <p>"I know that," he agreed. "And I think it is quite possible that the
  sailor <i>genuinely</i> believed what he was saying&mdash;they're the most
  gullible brand of men on earth. I think it is more than likely that when your
  brother befriended him he really intended to do him a good turn. What I'm
  doubtful of is the value of the information. Certainly I would say one thing.
  Unless your brother, when you see him, has something very much more definite
  to go on than the ramblings of a seaman on his last legs, and this map he was
  given it would be nothing short of madness to sink any money in an attempt to
  discover it."</p>

  <p>"I quite see your point," she said. "But would it be too much to ask you
  to hear what he's got to say? And then give us your advice."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," cried Jim. "I shall be only too delighted. The Dorchester
  Club always finds me when I'm in London, and I shall be very interested to
  hear what he has to tell us. I know that country better than most men, and if
  I can be of any assistance&mdash;count me in. But for Heaven's
  sake&mdash;don't build any false hopes on it."</p>

  <p>A sudden surge of Bright Young Things bearing kippers and beer descended
  on them, and carried her away, leaving Jim with an intense female who shook
  him to the marrow on sight. He suffered her for five minutes, at the end of
  which period, to his inexpressible relief, Percy bore down on him.</p>

  <p>"I never thought I should be glad to see you, Percy," he said, as the
  female drifted away, "but that woman is a menace to society."</p>

  <p>"She is pretty grim," agreed his cousin. "What price the other girl? I saw
  you with your noses touching for about half an hour!"</p>

  <p>"A nice little soul," said Jim. "Do you know anything about her?"</p>

  <p>"Just been asking Pamela. Her father is a retired General: got a house
  down in Sussex."</p>

  <p>"Has he got any money?"</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Hullo! Hullo!" Percy dug him in the ribs. "So that's how the land
  lies, does it?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be such a damned fool," said Jim curtly. "To say nothing of being
  infernally offensive."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, old man. I but spoke in jest. As a matter of fact, I think not. In
  fact Pamela said he was darned hard up. There's a pretty useless waster of a
  son, I gather. Out in South America somewhere."</p>

  <p>Jim glanced at his watch: the time was two o'clock.</p>

  <p>"Not going yet, old lad, are you?" cried Percy. "We're only just
  beginning."</p>

  <p>"You needn't come," said Jim. "I shall walk. This terrific excitement is
  too much for me. Do I have to whisper some mystic countersign to get out of
  the place?"</p>

  <p>"No, just open the front door and beetle away. Sure you don't want me to
  take you in the bus?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Jim, and beetled.</p>

  <p>Thus did we find him, top-hat tilted, pondering on things in general with
  the lights of London in front of him. He strolled slowly along drawing in
  great lungsful of fresh air. Lord! what an atmosphere there had been in that
  cellar. And what a damned-fool performance. Yet, in a way he was glad he had
  gone: the girl in grey was rather a dear. Stupid of him not to have asked her
  address: probably get it when this young brother of hers rolled up.</p>

  <p>He grinned to himself: the hidden treasure yarn had whiskers on it even
  when compared to the old Spanish prisoner chestnut. No less than four times
  had it been put up to him&mdash;vouched for chapter and verse. Still he was
  sorry for the girl, especially as there was not much money. Probably been
  building on it a bit: only natural that she should. But the brother must be a
  fool as well as a waster to be taken in by it.</p>

  <p>A belated taxi homeward bound hailed him, but he shook his head. He was
  not in the least sleepy, and the combined reek of smoke and kipper still
  clung to him. Young asses! He tried to picture what any of them would do in a
  really tight corner. That fellow who had been thumping the piano for
  instance, and thumping it damned well, to do him justice. But imagine him in
  a bar in Valparaiso, for instance, when a rough house started.</p>

  <p>He threw away his cigarette: was he being quite fair? After all, none of
  them had had any experience of such a show. And maybe if they did do the
  wrong thing it would be from lack of knowledge, not from lack of guts. It
  wasn't given to many to have the opportunities he had had, even if the desire
  to have them was there.</p>

  <p>Men had often told him that he looked for trouble, but that was not quite
  the case. There was no need for him to look: it came of its own accord. True,
  he never went out of his way to avoid it: he would even admit that he
  welcomed it with both hands. Something out of the ordinary, off the beaten
  track: something with a spice of danger in it&mdash;that was all he asked of
  life. And up-to-date life had given him full measure, pressed down and
  running over.</p>

  <p>He glanced up at the houses he was passing: solid lumps of respectability,
  symbolic of everything that he was not. In them reposed lawyers,
  stock-brokers, city magnates&mdash;men who formed the backbone of the Medes
  and Persians. Not there was adventure in London to be found: the mere thought
  of it was an outrage. In Dockland, perhaps, but that was cheap: the glamour
  of Limehouse exists only in the imagination of the novelist. No&mdash;though
  he had told the girl that it could be found he was wrong: it could not be
  found anywhere these days....</p>

  <p>And at that moment, clear and distinct in the still, night air, there rang
  out the sharp crack of a revolver shot.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM MAITLAND stopped dead in his tracks, and then with the
  instinct bred of many years he sought the cover of a neighbouring tree. In
  the country he had just come from he would not have given the matter a second
  thought&mdash;gun work was part of the ordinary day's round. But in London,
  especially in this part of London, it was a very different affair. The sound
  had come from the house in front of him&mdash;a house very similar to the one
  he had just left, save that it was not for sale. It was in darkness, but some
  kind of subconscious instinct told him that there had been a light in one of
  the upper windows a few seconds previously.</p>

  <p>He glanced up and down the road: not a soul was in sight. He looked at the
  two neighbouring houses: there was no sign of movement. And then, as was his
  way, he summed up the situation. He was unarmed: whoever had fired the shot
  obviously was not. Short of breaking in there was no way in which he could
  get into the house. And finally it was no earthly business of his. Wherefore,
  by three very good reasons to <i>nil</i> he should have continued his
  leisurely walk towards home. Which was quite sufficient to decide him to do
  nothing of the sort. He would give it a few minutes at any rate to see if
  anything further happened.</p>

  <p>He turned the collar of his evening overcoat up so as to cover the white
  patch of dress shirt. Then motionless as a statue he seemed to merge himself
  into the trees in front of him. For a while nothing happened: then from one
  of the windows there came a gleam of light. It was extinguished almost at
  once, only to appear in the one just below it and then go out again. Someone
  was coming down the stairs. It shone for a second over the front door, and
  then the door itself opened, and two men came out.</p>

  <p>Jim realised they would have to pass within a few feet of him, and pressed
  himself still closer against the trees. He could hear their voices&mdash;one
  furiously angry, the other seemingly apologetic&mdash;though as yet he could
  not make out their actual words. One was a big man, the other a head shorter,
  and it was the big man who was in a rage.</p>

  <p>"You damned, blithering fool, Ernesto."</p>

  <p>The words suddenly rang out clearly as they approached the gate.</p>

  <p>"You've wrecked the whole thing."</p>

  <p>The latch clicked, and Jim waited for the smaller man's reply.</p>

  <p>"He should not have struck me," he said. "I do not like to be struck."</p>

  <p>The two men stood peering up and down the road.</p>

  <p>"Not a cursed thing in sight," growled the big man. "However, perhaps it
  is as well. No one heard. We'll walk. But we've got to get a move on."</p>

  <p>They strode off, and Jim waited till their voices died away in the
  distance. The big man was obviously English: the other from his accent and
  name seemed Spanish. Or possibly South American. And it struck him that it
  was a queer coincidence that he should have been mentioning that
  characteristic of the dago to the girl only a little time
  previously&mdash;their hatred of being hit.</p>

  <p>He came out from behind the tree, and began to size things up. In the
  house in front of him was a man who had been shot. He might be dead: he might
  only be wounded. The great point was&mdash;was there anyone else inside? If
  there were servants, some of them at any rate would have been roused by the
  noise of the shot, and lights would have been turned on. But the house was
  still in darkness. On balance therefore he decided against servants.</p>

  <p>What about the owner of the house? Was it the big man himself? That seemed
  quite probable, and if so what was he going to do? To leave a dead man, or
  even a seriously-wounded man lying about the place would prove an awkward
  matter. He recalled his last words about getting a move on. What had he
  meant? And putting himself in his place Jim decided that the only possible
  course would be to take the body away and dump it elsewhere. It would be
  unsafe even to leave it till the following night, since any doctor would know
  that the man had been dead some time, and it would be most improbable for a
  corpse to lie through the day in the open undiscovered.... It would therefore
  give a strong pointer to the police that the body had been moved <i>after</i>
  death, whereas if it was done at once they might be deceived. So it boiled
  down to the fact that if he was going to do anything at all, it must be done
  at once. He crossed the pavement rapidly, opened the gate and skirted up the
  short drive keeping in the shadow of the bushes.</p>

  <p>That he was proposing to break into somebody else's house disturbed him
  not at all. His position, even if he was discovered, was a far stronger one
  than the owners who would have to explain the presence of a dead or wounded
  man on his premises. But he had no intention of being discovered. Amongst
  other attributes possessed by Jim Maitland was an almost catlike gift for
  silent moving at night, and he proposed to utilise it to the full.</p>

  <p>He glided up the steps like a dark shadow, only to find as he had expected
  that the door was locked. Yale latch-key: no hope there. Then keeping close
  to the walls he made a circuit of the house. There was a basement and with
  any luck he hoped to find a window open, or at any rate one he could force
  easily. There was just sufficient light for him to see without having to
  strike matches, and suddenly he gave a little exclamation. There, straight in
  front of him, was a broken pane of glass. He reached down, unfastened the
  bolt, and a moment later he was inside.</p>

  <p>The darkness now was far more intense, and after taking two or three
  cautious steps forward he struck a match. It was a risk, but the window by
  which he had entered was at the back of the house, so the light could not be
  seen from the road. He held it above his head, and as he peered round a
  puzzled frown came over his face. The shortcomings of modern servants he had
  been told about, but the filth of the room called for some further
  explanation than that.</p>

  <p>The dust was thick on the table and on the floor: clearly the place had
  not been touched for months. And when he opened the door and continued his
  exploration he found it was the same everywhere. Kitchen, scullery, and
  larder were all in like condition: the basement evidently was not used.
  Where, then, did they do the cooking?</p>

  <p>A flight of stairs led to the next floor, and he went up them noiselessly.
  Luckily the door at the top was not locked. He opened it, and at once became
  aware of a strong odour of stale tobacco smoke. Directly facing him a faint
  light filtered in through the fan-light over the front door: he was in the
  hall.</p>

  <p>He stood motionless, listening intently: the house was absolutely
  silent.</p>

  <p>The smokers, whoever they had been, were there no longer. Then, step by
  step, he felt his way forward. And the first thing that struck him was that
  the condition of the basement was certainly not duplicated on this floor. His
  feet almost sank into the carpet, so rich was the pile, and a match carefully
  screened by his hand showed him that the whole place was furnished <i>de
  luxe</i>.</p>

  <p>He found the staircase, and began to ascend on a carpet as thick as that
  in the hall. The second storey was his goal, and if he realised that every
  step he took now materially increased his danger his pulse beat no quicker.
  Every third or fourth stair he paused and listened: still the same deathly
  silence.</p>

  <p>The smell of stale smoke seemed to be growing stronger the higher he
  mounted, till it reached a maximum on the first landing. His eyes were
  growing accustomed to it now, and in the very faint light that filtered in
  from a window at the end of the passage, he saw an open door just beside him.
  He stepped through it, and realised that he had found the origin of the smell
  of smoke.</p>

  <p>Here the darkness was absolute, and after a moment's hesitation he struck
  another match. And by its feeble glimmer he solved one, at any rate, of his
  problems. A single glance showed him what he had stumbled into, and the
  mystery of the dirty basement was explained.</p>

  <p>The place was a private gambling den, and as soon as he realised the fact,
  he realised also that much of the need for caution was gone. The house was
  empty: he would not be disturbed until the two men returned, if they returned
  at all. He shut the door and switched on the light.</p>

  <p>Heavy black curtains covered the windows, and the room which ran the whole
  depth of the house was sumptuously furnished. At one end stood a cold buffet,
  with the remains of many plates of sandwiches on the table. Empty champagne
  bottles galore littered the floor behind it: the spread was in keeping with
  the furniture. In the centre of the room was a roulette board: on each side
  of it all the usual paraphernalia for baccarat and <i>chemin de fer</i> lay
  scattered on two tables.</p>

  <p>No servants kept, he reflected: provisions ordered in from a caterer. And
  in his satisfaction at having settled one point, for a while he forgot that
  there was a second far more important one to be enquired into. Moreover, that
  time was getting on.</p>

  <p>He could move more freely now, and having switched off he went boldly up
  to the next landing. If he had been right about the light in the window just
  before the shot, the room would be one facing the road. That narrowed the
  choice to two, and for a while he hesitated, wondering which to try first.
  Both doors were shut: it was a toss up. Finally he took a chance, and as luck
  would have it he was right.</p>

  <p>A big roll-top desk stood in the centre of the room, which was furnished
  like an office. Two or three leather chairs: a few books of reference in
  which <i>Who's Who</i> and <i>Burkes</i> figured prominently: some sporting
  prints on the walls, and a big safe in one corner comprised the rest of the
  stuff. Except for a pair of legs that stuck out beyond the desk....</p>

  <p>He had turned on the light as he entered, and before examining the body he
  crossed to the window and drew the curtains closer together. Then he returned
  to the desk and stared down at the man lying on the floor. His face was in
  shadow but a glance was sufficient to show that he was dead. He was in
  evening clothes, and in the centre of his white shirt was a dark-red stain.
  One arm was thrown up as if to ward off the shot: the other, with fist
  clenched, lay outstretched along the carpet. He had been plugged through the
  heart.</p>

  <p>There was no stain on the carpet, which proved that the bullet was still
  inside him. And in that curiously-detached mood which is experienced by some
  men when the circumstances are dangerous or unusual Jim found himself
  commenting mentally on what a very fortunate fact it was for the murderers,
  if they intended, as he assumed they did, to put the body elsewhere. The
  bleeding had ceased, and even the most bovine policeman would smell a rat if
  there was a wound in a dead man's back and no blood on the ground underneath
  it.</p>

  <p>He was far too accustomed to battle, murder, and sudden death to feel
  particularly upset about the matter. What had happened seemed fairly clear.
  There had been some row below, and the three of them had come up to the
  office to settle it. The dead man had lost his temper, hit the dago and the
  dago had shot him. So much seemed obvious. The point was&mdash;what was his
  next move?</p>

  <p>In certain countries the answer would have been one word&mdash;nothing.
  But in England things were different. It was perfectly true that if he now
  walked out of the house as he had walked in, no one would be any the wiser.
  But he felt a strange disinclination to let the matter drop. A telephone was
  on the desk, and for a while he stared at it. Should he ring up the police?
  And then it struck him he didn't even know the name of the house. It was
  absurd to state that he was in an unknown house with a dead man on the floor
  beside him. Almost equally absurd to ask the Exchange where he was. To find
  out he would have to go down and look outside the gates. Even then it might
  only be a number, and as he was also ignorant of the name of the road, he
  would be no better off.</p>

  <p>At the same time it seemed equally fatuous to remain where he was. If the
  two men returned he knew that one of them, at least, had a gun which he did
  not scruple to use. And if there was one thing more than any other that he
  disliked, it was a balance debit in the matter of firearms. If they did not
  return it would be daylight in less than an hour, and he might be seen
  leaving the house, which would prove awkward.</p>

  <p>Suddenly it struck him that as yet he had not examined the dead man's
  face. The eyes were wide open and staring: the teeth were set in a snarl: the
  expression, in fact, was just what he would have expected in a man killed
  instantaneously in the middle of a quarrel. And so it was not that that
  caused him some few seconds later to rise to his feet with a look of
  incredulous amazement on his face. The thing was impossible; frankly
  impossible. And yet there was no mistaking the likeness of the murdered man
  to the girl he had been talking to that evening.</p>

  <p>Jim Maitland had none of the popular disbelief in coincidence. He had met
  so many amazing ones in his life that he took them as a matter of course. So
  that it was not so much the strangeness of the affair that worried him, but
  how this new development affected his course of action. If this was Judy
  Draycott's brother&mdash;and in view of the likeness he felt but little doubt
  on the fact&mdash;the whole thing became very much more personal. He liked
  what little he had seen of her immensely, and here he was confronted with the
  dead body of her twin brother, knowing full well that the murderer was a dago
  whose Christian name was Ernesto.</p>

  <p>His course of action was obvious. Ring up the Exchange: explain briefly
  what had occurred, and ask them to tell the police to come round. With the
  clues he could give them it should prove a very easy matter to lay hands on
  the man who had done it. Moreover he realised that if he did not take that
  course of action, and it should ever transpire that he had been mixed up in
  it the girl would never forgive him. And yet he hesitated. Twice did his hand
  go out to pick up the receiver: twice did he refrain.</p>

  <p>It was certainly not due to any desire to shield the murderer. Even if the
  dead man had been a bit of a waster that was no excuse for a dago plugging
  him. His hesitation came from a very different cause. The instant the police
  came into the matter he automatically went out. And he was not sure he wanted
  to go out. The coincidence of the thing, and the strangeness of the whole
  episode had intrigued his curiosity.</p>

  <p>When talking to the girl he had poured cold water on her tale about buried
  treasure, but now he found himself wondering. Was it possible that this was
  not a mere gambling quarrel, but something bigger? After all, no one would
  come home after a long absence abroad and spend his first night playing
  <i>chemin de fer</i> without even letting his people know he had returned.
  And clearly the girl had no idea that her brother was back.</p>

  <p>A liner had berthed that morning: the dead man then had been in London
  well over twelve hours. Surely he would under normal circumstances have got
  in touch with his relatives.</p>

  <p>Jim realised that the reasoning was thin, but it afforded him just
  sufficient excuse not to do his plain duty and use the telephone. Which was
  negative, not positive: to decide what you are not going to do is easier than
  deciding what you are.</p>

  <p>If his supposition was right: if this youngster had been talking out of
  his turn with regard to some genuine proposition in South America one thing
  was vitally important. He must have a closer look at the two men who had been
  responsible for the murder. The girl would be coming into it, and he could
  help her far more by spotting the enemy unknown to them than by handing one
  of them over to the police. And it was as he arrived at this satisfactory, if
  somewhat unmoral, conclusion that he suddenly straightened up with every
  nerve taut. From outside had come the unmistakable sound of a door
  opening....</p>

  <p>He looked into the passage, and realised he was a sitting target for a man
  with a gun: the only hope was to tackle him as he came in. And in one bound
  he was beside the door, pressed against the wall.</p>

  <p>A board creaked close by, and Jim waited tensely. Then there stepped into
  the room a strange figure. It was that of a small man hardly more than five
  feet high, clad in a silk dressing-gown. His head, covered with a skullcap,
  moved quickly from side to side like that of a bird: his hands were stretched
  out gropingly in front of him. And suddenly Jim understood: the man was
  blind.</p>

  <p>"Monty: is that you?"</p>

  <p>The voice was querulous, and high pitched&mdash;almost like a woman's, and
  a feeling of repugnance almost akin to nausea gripped Jim Maitland. He felt
  an overwhelming temptation to seize this little monstrosity by the throat and
  throttle him, and in the days that were to come he often recalled the fact.
  What a lot of trouble would have been saved if he had yielded to the
  impulse.</p>

  <p>"Monty: where are you?"</p>

  <p>It was almost a hiss, and the blind man's head gradually moved slower and
  slower until at length it became stationary with the sightless eyes staring
  at Jim. With that strange sixth sense given to those who cannot see he had
  located the stranger in the room. With a feeling of unreality Jim stared at
  him: the whole thing seemed like a dream. There was something so hideously
  abnormal about the little man apart altogether from his blindness. The hands
  were huge but beautifully made: the shoulders had that great depth and width
  which showed strength far above the average. But the incongruous thing was
  the look of almost devilish malignity on the face, instead of the gentle
  peacefulness generally seen on the features of the blind.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the man spoke again in a voice barely above a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, and what do you want?"</p>

  <p>Jim thought quickly. Should he say he was a policeman, and demand details
  of the crime? If he did he would have to carry the bluff through; an
  impossible thing if the others returned. And evidently the blind man was
  expecting them back, or at any rate someone called Monty. Better not: he
  would find out more if he kept silent. There would be no difficulty in
  eluding this little devil if it became necessary, or, should the worst come
  to the worst, in knocking him out. And then came the thing he had not
  expected. There was a click, and the room was in darkness.</p>

  <p>For a moment he did not realise the significance of the move: then low
  breathing close beside him put him wise. The absence of light made no
  difference to his adversary, but it made all the difference to him. He
  stepped quickly backwards, and the other man chuckled gently. A hand touched
  his shirt front, and the chuckle was repeated.</p>

  <p>"Evening clothes," came a whisper. "You foolish fellow."</p>

  <p>Again Jim backed, but all the time he knew the other was following him.
  And suddenly there came to him a feeling he had experienced so rarely in his
  life that he refused to acknowledge it&mdash;fear. He had an almost
  irresistible desire to blunder about wildly: to hit out with all his force
  into the black, impenetrable wall around him. There was something abnormal
  about this squat, misshapen form which he knew was close beside
  him&mdash;invisible and yet so real.</p>

  <p>He forced his nerves into control, and listened intently. Was that the
  sound of breathing behind his left shoulder? He swung his fist round, and
  cursed under his breath as he hit the wall. And once again came that odious
  chuckle from somewhere in the centre of the room.</p>

  <p>A new idea came to him which steadied his nerves at once. With the room
  lit up he would have had the greatest compunction in hitting a blind man: it
  would have offended his sense of fair play. But now in the darkness things
  were different. The advantage was quite definitely on the side of his
  adversary. Superior strength was a legitimate weapon to use provided the
  other conditions were on an equality. He would lay the little swine out,
  gather what further information he could, and then clear out. And even as he
  arrived at this conclusion he heard the gentle click of a drawer shutting:
  the blind man was by the desk.</p>

  <p>He took a step forward, and promptly blundered into a chair. Where the
  devil was he: he didn't remember any chair in that part of the room at all.
  He had lost his bearings completely: he did not even know in which direction
  the door lay. Or the switch. And with the thought of the switch he gave a
  sudden, short laugh. Assuredly the flesh pots of London had atrophied his
  brain. He had actually forgotten that in his pocket was a box of perfectly
  good matches. He fumbled in his coat, and it was then that, too late, he
  realised the folly of having laughed. It all happened with incredible
  swiftness. He had hardly felt that hands were touching him behind before they
  were on his shoulders. Then came a heave, and the legs of the blind man were
  gripping him by the waist, whilst two arms were flung round his neck. And in
  the pitch blackness the fight began.</p>

  <p>From the beginning it was a foregone conclusion, but the only feeling he
  was conscious of was one of rage at having been such a fool. Immensely
  powerful though he was, he knew at once that as far as strength in the arms
  was concerned the blind man was his match. Moreover he was fighting under the
  most disadvantageous conditions possible. To dislodge even a comparative
  weakling from such a position is no easy matter: to get rid of an abnormal
  monstrosity was an impossibility. And he knew it.</p>

  <p>With every ounce of strength he possessed put forward he tried to release
  the iron grip round his neck: then he went for the legs. And for the third
  time the chuckle was repeated. He blundered round the room till he bumped
  into a wall: then with his back towards it he crashed his burden against it
  time after time. If only he could wind the little brute there would still be
  a chance. But beyond a grunt of rage at each bump it was useless: the grip
  merely tightened round his throat.</p>

  <p>He was weakening, and the knowledge drove him wild. He began staggering
  haphazard about the room, whilst the roaring in his ears increased. Once he
  hit the desk and nearly fell, only recovering himself with a vast effort. But
  it was his last kick: there was a limit to what even he could stand. His
  lungs were bursting: the veins on his forehead were standing out like
  whipcord. Hazily he realised that the room had suddenly been flooded with
  light, and that two men were standing by the door. Then with a crash he
  pitched forward on his face and knew no more....</p>

  <p>He awoke to find himself in a small, bare room. The walls were
  whitewashed: the furniture non-existent save for the very hard apology for a
  bed on which he was lying. The door had a singularly solid look: the window
  was barred. And for a while he stared round trying to pull himself
  together.</p>

  <p>Gradually recollection returned. The blind dwarf: the dead man: the
  gambling den. And now where the devil was he? He sat up: his shoes had been
  removed. And into his still bemused brain came a sudden light. He was in the
  cell of a police station.</p>

  <p>In his mouth was a foul taste, the significance of which he realised only
  too well. Once, in his extreme youth, he had been shanghaied out east, and
  the after-taste of a drug can never be mistaken for anything else. After he
  had been throttled into insensibility, dope of sorts had been forced down his
  throat: so much was obvious.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the window: the sun was streaming in. Then he looked for his
  watch only to find it had been taken away.</p>

  <p>"Awake, are you? What we might describe as some blind&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>The man's tone was good-humoured and Jim staggered to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Then the description would be wrong, sergeant," he said shortly. "Doped,
  my boy: drugged. At my age, too, by the Lord Harry! For the love of Pete,
  give me some water. I've got a mouth like a volcano in eruption."</p>

  <p>The sergeant shouted an order, and then looked at Jim curiously.</p>

  <p>"Drugged, were you? Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Am I sure? Of course I'm sure."</p>

  <p>He took a long gulp of water from the glass that a constable had
  brought.</p>

  <p>"If you'd got a head like hell with the lid off, and a mouth like a refuse
  heap, you'd be sure."</p>

  <p>"I'm not denying," said the sergeant, "that I had some suspicions of it
  myself. At the same time nothing seemed to have been taken from you. We
  have"&mdash;he consulted a piece of paper he took out of his pocket&mdash;"a
  gold watch, a gold and platinum cigarette-case, and twenty-six pounds, five
  shillings, and four pence in cash. Now, sir, you say you were drugged. Who
  by, and where?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you the name of the gentleman," said Jim grimly, "though I
  propose to find it out at the earliest possible moment. Nor can I tell you
  the exact locality. The nearest I can get to that is that it was somewhere in
  Hampstead."</p>

  <p>"Hampstead!" ejaculated the sergeant. "Hampstead!"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said Jim irritably.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know where you are now, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Not an earthly. How the devil should I?"</p>

  <p>"You are in Streatham, sir. You were found on Streatham Common by the
  policeman on duty at seven o'clock this morning."</p>

  <p>"What is the time now?" demanded Jim.</p>

  <p>"Just after half-past three. You've been insensible for nearly eight
  hours."</p>

  <p>For a time Jim stared at the officer without replying. His brain was
  beginning to work again normally and it was evident that he must do some
  pretty quick thinking. What had happened was, up to a point, clear. Having
  drugged him, they had put him in a car and dropped him as far as possible
  from the house where the thing had taken place. The two men he had seen just
  before he finally lost consciousness must have done it. But the immediate
  point to be decided was the important one. Should he tell the sergeant the
  whole story or should he not?</p>

  <p>Reduced to the baldest terms the story sounded a bit thin. In a
  house&mdash;name unknown, situated in a road&mdash;name also unknown,
  somewhere in Hampstead he had found a dead man. He had then been attacked by
  a blind dwarf and doped. If he told it and stuck to it the police would be
  forced to investigate it which would mean publicity. And he did not want
  publicity. He was very angry, and his definite intention was to deal with the
  matter himself. At the same time he realised that he was now in England, and
  that if he said nothing about the murder he was&mdash;if the facts came
  out&mdash;bringing himself quite definitely within the scope of the law as
  being an accessory to the crime. What, then, was to be done? The sergeant was
  beginning to look suspicious at his silence, and something had to be said. He
  decided to compromise.</p>

  <p>"Do you people know of a private gambling den in Hampstead?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We certainly shouldn't know it here, sir, and I can't tell you what
  information they have up there. Whereabouts in Hampstead?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Jim. "I could probably identify the road, but with
  regard to the house I'm not so sure."</p>

  <p>"Then it was the first time you'd been there?"</p>

  <p>"It was."</p>

  <p>"But if you don't know the house or the road how did you get in?"</p>

  <p>"I was taken there by a man I met," said Jim. "He was a stranger to me,
  but he seemed a decent sort of fellow."</p>

  <p>"Surely you know his name, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Sorry, sergeant: I'm afraid I don't. I like a gamble, and he assured me
  this place was run on the straight. It wasn't: and that's all there is to it.
  I started throwing my weight about, and got my liquor doped for my
  pains."</p>

  <p>"You'd know this man again if you saw him?"</p>

  <p>"If I saw him&mdash;certainly," agreed Jim. "And you can take it from me I
  propose to look for him."</p>

  <p>The sergeant shook his head disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, all I can say is that it serves you right. A gentleman of your
  age ought to know better than to run your head into a fool trap like
  that."</p>

  <p>"Exactly, sergeant," said Jim mildly.</p>

  <p>"I'll get on the 'phone to Hampstead and find out if they know anything,
  but unless you can be a bit more explicit it looks pretty hopeless."</p>

  <p>"Would you at the same time, sergeant, get on to 3B Half Moon
  Street&mdash;Grosvenor 3X21&mdash;and tell my man Brooke to bring my clothes
  here at once. I don't want to drive through London in this rig. By the way,"
  he added with a grin, "am I going to be charged with being drunk and
  disorderly or anything?"</p>

  <p>"We'll let you off this time," said the other. "But if you take my advice
  you'll steer clear of that sort of thing in future."</p>

  <p>The worthy officer departed closing the door, and Jim sat down on the bed.
  Save for a stiff neck, and a splitting headache he felt none the worse for
  the performance. At the small cost of appearing a fool in the sergeant's eyes
  he had accounted for his condition, and now he was left as a free agent to
  carry things on in his own way.</p>

  <p>To say that he was angry would be to express it mildly. Jim Maitland was
  furious. That he should have been outed in Hampstead of all places, got the
  better of, fooled completely, made him wild. But since he never made the
  mistake of belittling an adversary he admitted to himself that no matter
  where it was, the blind man, given the tactical advantage he had possessed
  last night, would always do him in. Therefore he must never be allowed to
  obtain such a position again.</p>

  <p>It was the question of the other two that worried him. It was possible but
  not probable that he might recognise their voices if he heard them again, but
  that was all. Outside it had been too dark to see their faces: inside he had
  been too far gone to notice anything except that two men were there. They
  might not even have been the same. But the annoying fact remained that two of
  the opponents knew him by sight, whereas he did not know them. Which started
  him at a grave disadvantage.</p>

  <p>His property had been returned to him and he lit a cigarette. Percy would
  be able to tell him the name of the road, and he felt fairly confident that
  he could spot the house again. But even if he did, was it going to do any
  good? Was there anything further to be found out there? It would please him
  immensely to slog the blind man good and hearty, but it would not advance
  things much if he did. That they had left the body there was most improbable:
  if not, what had they done with it?</p>

  <p>He opened the door, and hailed the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Got an evening paper there by any chance?" he cried.</p>

  <p>An <i>Evening News</i> was forthcoming, and he scanned the headlines.
  There was no mention of the discovery of any dead body. To question the man
  was obviously absurd, so he returned it with a word of thanks.</p>

  <p>"Hampstead knows nothing about any gambling den, sir," remarked the
  officer. "They'd be glad of any information you can give them. And your man
  is coming along at once with your clothes."</p>

  <p>Jim returned to his cell and lit another cigarette. A faint smile
  flickered round his lips as he pictured Brooke's face on finding him in his
  present position. Then he grew serious again: now that he had definitely
  committed himself by his story to the sergeant he began to doubt whether he
  had been wise. After all, the probability of there being anything further in
  it than a mere gambling quarrel was small. And if that was all, he had played
  straight into the murderer's hands. It was impossible for him to alter his
  story now.</p>

  <p>"Your clothes, sir."</p>

  <p>He looked up: Brooke, a suitcase in his hand, was standing stiffly in the
  doorway with an expression worthy of an early Christian martyr.</p>

  <p>"And this note, sir, was left by hand this morning."</p>

  <p>He took the letter and glanced at it: the writing was unfamiliar. Inside
  was a half sheet of paper, on which some words were written in block
  capitals.</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">last night you dreamed: to-day you awoke.<br>
  should you dream again you may not be so fortunate.</p><br>

  <p>"Who left this?" said Jim curtly.</p>

  <p>"A messenger boy, sir. About ten o'clock this morning."</p>

  <p>"Is there any letter in my evening coat, Brooke?"</p>

  <p>"Only this, sir."</p>

  <p>It was an invitation to a public dinner addressed to him at Half Moon
  Street, which he had slipped into his pocket meaning to send a reply from his
  club. So that was how they had traced him. Assuredly the dice were loaded
  pretty heavily in their favour. They knew him by sight: they knew his name:
  they knew his address. But his face was quite impassive as he continued
  dressing. The bigger the odds, the better the sport. Moreover, the other side
  had committed, had they but known it, the one irreparable error. For a threat
  to Jim Maitland was even as a strawberry ice is to a greedy child.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">AFTER a further admonition from the sergeant to be careful
  of the company he kept in future they parted on excellent terms. The
  necessity for a long drink and a strong drink was urgent: unfortunately a
  misguided legislation decreed that such a thing could not be at that hour. So
  sending Brooke on in the taxi he went for the most important thing&mdash;a
  shave.</p>

  <p>The effects of the drug had very nearly worn off, and the need for
  formulating some plan of campaign was evident. And the first thing to do was
  to put himself in the enemy's position. Their assumption, it seemed to him,
  would be that he would most certainly tell the police. It would be the
  obvious thing that ninety-nine men out of a hundred would do in similar
  circumstances. In fact he would have done it himself but for the
  extraordinary coincidence of his previous conversation with the girl&mdash;a
  conversation about which they could know nothing. Taking that as a
  basis&mdash;what next? They would anticipate a visit of inspection from the
  police very shortly after he recovered consciousness. They could not know
  that he was blissfully ignorant even of the name of the road.</p>

  <p>The strong probability therefore was that by now all traces of their
  occupation of the house would have disappeared. They had no time to lose:
  even the roulette and baccarat tables would involve them in unpleasant
  notoriety if discovered by the authorities. The point would have to be
  confirmed, of course, but it seemed to him that that was the obvious
  starting-point from which to begin. And if so, the problem became a simple
  one to propound, but a difficult one to solve. How was he to get in touch
  with them again?</p>

  <p>The crude and stupid threat had presumably been written on the assumption
  that he would not receive it until after he had communicated with the police,
  and led them, apparently, to a mare's nest. They hoped that it would catch
  him in a mood of irritation and annoyance at having not only been made a fool
  of himself, but also for having made a fool of the police. And it was not
  hard to imagine what the police would have said if he had taken them to an
  empty and harmless house, on the plea that it was a gambling den where a man
  had been murdered. In fact with some men the threat might have fulfilled its
  object, and made them drop the whole thing. That he was not in that category
  was neither here nor there. Was it a sound move to let them think that he
  was?</p>

  <p>He told the barber to give him a couple of hot towels, and under their
  soothing influence he followed up that line of thought. They would soon find
  out that he had not told the police: what would they deduce from that? Surely
  it would be confirmatory evidence that he was only too anxious to let the
  matter drop altogether. They might think he was a business man unwilling to
  be mixed up in any scandal. And the more he sized up the situation, the
  better it seemed to him to give them that impression.</p>

  <p>The only point against it was that if he left them alone, they would
  certainly do the same to him. The last thing they wanted was to be interfered
  with. Between them they would have to account for a murder, and even if they
  succeeded in bringing home the actual deed to the man called Ernesto, they
  would all be guilty of complicity. So what chance was there of getting any
  further with it, unless he carried the war into the enemy's country?</p>

  <p>A big point, certainly&mdash;almost a vital one. To let the matter really
  drop was unthinkable, but what was he to do? At the moment he was at a
  hopeless disadvantage. If only, while apparently letting things go by the
  board, he could get hold of some pieces of evidence which would give him a
  clue as to their whereabouts. If only, unknown to them, he could start all
  square knowing them even as they knew him. He was under no delusions: it
  would be sheer luck if he did it. But Jim Maitland was a believer in luck,
  and it was a hopeful portent that as he entered his club the clock showed
  half-past five. No longer did the law interfere with the consumption of
  alcohol.</p>

  <p>The first person he ran into was Percy, who looked at him in some
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! dear old lad," he burbled, "you look a bit under the
  weather&mdash;what! The right eye resembles a poached egg: the general
  bearing hardly of that martial order which is the hall-mark of our
  family."</p>

  <p>"Dry up," said Jim. "It's the result of that devastating performance of
  yours. Look here, young Percy, what is the name of the road in which that
  house is? Where you drove me last night."</p>

  <p>"Haven't an earthly, old fruit. I mean, who could be expected to know the
  name of a road in Hampstead?"</p>

  <p>"But you've often been there, you blithering ass."</p>

  <p>"I absolutely agree, dear heart. Absolutely. Times and again, and then
  some. I could find my way there in the dark with my eyes shut, but I couldn't
  tell you the name of the bally road to save my life."</p>

  <p>Jim regarded him dispassionately.</p>

  <p>"Your claim to continual existence grows more microscopic daily," he
  remarked at length. "However, it is you who will suffer. At eleven o'clock
  to-night you will call for me here in your car. You will then drive me to the
  scene of your ridiculous entertainment last night. After that you can go and
  play by yourself."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear man," spluttered Percy, "what the deuce do you want me to do
  that for? None of the birds will be there this evening."</p>

  <p>"A fact for which one can but give pious thanks to high heaven," said Jim,
  lighting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Then why do you want me to drive you there?" persisted his cousin.</p>

  <p>"So that I may mark it in my mind as a spot to avoid in the future," said
  Jim.</p>

  <p>"Cut it out, old lad," cried Percy. "Joking apart, what is the blinking
  game?"</p>

  <p>Jim Maitland stared at him thoughtfully. And after a while an idea,
  engendered perhaps by his conversation with Judy Draycott, began to take root
  in his mind. Here in the shape of his cousin was a test case. What lay behind
  that vacuous exterior? Supposing things did begin to move, how would Percy
  behave in a tight corner? And moved by a sudden impulse he signed to him to
  come closer.</p>

  <p>"I am about to order you a drink, young feller," he said, "and while you
  put your nose in it I am going to tell you a little story. But before I begin
  I want your word of honour that what I say to you goes no further without my
  permission."</p>

  <p>"You have it," said Percy quietly.</p>

  <p>"After I left you last night, whilst strolling along to get the foul smell
  of those kippers out of my nostrils, I heard a revolver shot. It came from a
  house I was passing. Impelled by my usual curiosity I broke into the house,
  which I found to be a gambling den. Amongst other odds and ends I found a
  murdered man lying about: he'd been shot through the heart. Shortly
  afterwards I was doped, and I've spent to-day in Streatham police
  station."</p>

  <p>"Go to blazes," laughed his cousin. "If that's your idea of a leg pull it
  is pretty poor, laddie."</p>

  <p>"It happens to be the truth, Percy," said Jim gravely. "Now listen to
  me."</p>

  <p>Without embroidery he told his cousin the whole story, omitting only one
  point&mdash;his strong suspicion that the murdered man was Judy Draycott's
  brother. That and all the implications that might follow with it, was not at
  the moment a thing he wanted to pass on to anyone. And by the time he had
  finished Percy's eyes were nearly goggling out of his head.</p>

  <p>"But how perfectly priceless," he spluttered ecstatically. "Of course, old
  lad, you can count me in. Your idea is to go and have another look at the
  house to-night. Do a bit of amateur detective work. And, by Jove! that
  reminds me. There is a gambling place up in those parts: I've heard of it
  myself. Bloke in the club here told me about it&mdash;Teddy d'Acres."</p>

  <p>He hailed a passing waiter.</p>

  <p>"Is Lord d'Acres in the club?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"His lordship is playing cards, sir," said the man.</p>

  <p>"I'll get hold of him, Jim," cried Percy, getting up.</p>

  <p>"Not a word, don't forget," said the older man. "Just get the details of
  the place: nothing more."</p>

  <p>"You leave it to me, laddie."</p>

  <p>He rushed off to return in a couple of minutes with the information that
  Teddy was just finishing a rubber and would join them at once.</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said Jim, "that I'm on the look out for a gamble, and want a
  straight place."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity," opined his lordship, a few moments later, "that I didn't
  meet you last night. I was playing myself and I could have taken you along.
  And to-night I'm afraid I'm booked up three deep."</p>

  <p>"What's the name of the house?" demanded Percy.</p>

  <p>"Damned if I know, old boy," said the other. "It's a number, I think. But
  the road is Oakleigh Avenue."</p>

  <p>"That's it," cried Percy, turning to Jim, "I remember now. That's where we
  met last night."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," went on d'Acres, "it's perhaps as well you weren't
  there. A poor evening. We generally carry on till three or four, but this
  morning we broke up about one."</p>

  <p>Jim looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Any particular reason?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Bloke there half screwed, who was asking for trouble. Began swearing he'd
  been cheated, which was all tripe. I've been to the damned place for months,
  and it's run absolutely square. Then he swore he'd get the police, which
  seemed to little Willie the moment to quit."</p>

  <p>"Did he get the police?" asked Jim casually.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," said d'Acres. "I got to bed at a respectable hour for
  once."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he was the fellow I met at dinner," continued Jim, catching
  Percy's eye for a second. "Distinctly elevated even then, and asking everyone
  if they could tell him where to get a game. Big fellow and fat, with fair
  hair."</p>

  <p>d'Acres shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not guilty. This was a slight, dark bird. Haven't an earthly what his
  name was, but he'd just come from South America, where according to him
  gambling was gambling, and not messing about with chicken food."</p>

  <p>Not too good, reflected Jim. The evidence as far as it went at present
  seemed to point to nothing bigger than an ordinary gambling row as the cause
  of the shooting. And if so it would have been far better if he had telephoned
  the police from the house, for all interest would have left the situation as
  far as he was concerned.</p>

  <p>"Who runs the place?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A syndicate, I believe. <i>Cagnotte</i> of five per cent&mdash;drinks and
  sandwiches chucked in."</p>

  <p>He rose.</p>

  <p>"Let me know any time you want to go," he remarked. "But give me a bit of
  warning, because I'm pretty full up. And if I can't manage it&mdash;you must
  be introduced the first time by someone who is known&mdash;I'll get old Monty
  to take you. He's always there: believe he's one of the syndicate, as a
  matter of fact. From all I hear, the old lad needs every penny of boodle he
  can lay his hands on."</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of Jim's face twitched: his expression was one of polite
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Monty," he murmured. "Monty who?"</p>

  <p>"Monty Barnet," said the other. "Thought everyone knew old Monty.
  Well&mdash;so long: you just let me know when you feel like a flutter."</p>

  <p>He lounged away, and Jim turned to his cousin.</p>

  <p>"Who the devil is Monty Barnet when he's at home?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! man&mdash;it can't be him your blind friend meant. He's Sir
  Montague Barnet, umpteenth Bart. Got a big place not far from
  Crowborough."</p>

  <p>"At the moment I don't give a hoot where his place is," remarked Jim.
  "What sort of a man is he to look at?"</p>

  <p>"Great big fellow with a small, dark moustache. Rather red in the
  face."</p>

  <p>Jim Maitland lit a cigarette with some deliberation.</p>

  <p>"If that is so, Percy," he said quietly, "the betting is just about five
  to one on your umpteenth Bart being one of the birds I want. Your description
  fits, and we have it from your pal d'Acres that he uses the place
  considerably. It may, of course, be only a very strange coincidence, but as a
  basis to work on I propose to start with the assumption as correct."</p>

  <p>"But what are you going to do?" demanded Percy. "You can't go and accuse
  the bloke of murder."</p>

  <p>"There are moments, little man," said Jim kindly, "when the thought that
  the same blood runs in our veins drives me to thoughts of suicide. Run away
  now, and play, and return at eleven o'clock in a dark suiting bringing an
  electric torch in your pocket."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch: it was just on six. With luck he would have time
  to catch the man he wanted before he left his office. The firm of Henley
  Bros.&mdash;fifty pounds to ten thousand advanced on note of hand
  alone&mdash;kept late hours.</p>

  <p>"And don't forget," he gave a final warning, "not a word to a soul, or
  I'll break your darned neck."</p>

  <p>He penetrated the holy of holies at Messrs. Henley Bros. without
  difficulty. An oleaginous clerk outside informed him that such a thing would
  be out of the question, but on being requested to guess again and guess
  quickly he consented to take his name to Mr. Henley, with a result that
  surprised him.</p>

  <p>"My dear Misther Maitland, thith ith a pleasure indeed."</p>

  <p>A small, obese Jew almost concealed behind a vast cigar rose at Jim's
  entrance. He indicated a chair which his visitor took: he proffered an
  equally vast cigar which his visitor refused. Then sitting back in his chair
  he contemplated Jim with a watchful look.</p>

  <p>"And what can I have the pleasure of doing for you, Misther Maitland?"</p>

  <p>"I do not want a thousand pounds, Isaac," said Jim shortly. "Not being a
  millionaire I couldn't repay you. What I do want is some information."</p>

  <p>"What sort of information?"</p>

  <p>"Information which even if you can't give me now, you can find out for me.
  I don't like your trade, Isaac, as you know very well: but you may remember
  that day in Marseilles when I saved your somewhat worthless life."</p>

  <p>Isaac Goldstein remembered it only too well, as the sickly pallor which
  spread over his face at the mere recollection of the incident testified. It
  was in the days before he had become Henley Bros., though his method of
  earning his livelihood had been the same, if on a smaller scale. And some of
  the inhabitants of Marseilles had suddenly decided that a thousand per cent
  was too much of a good thing. They stand not on the order of their going, do
  the people of that district: their habits are crude and summary. In short,
  but for the timely intervention of Jim Maitland who happened to be passing,
  Isaac Goldstein would not have been sitting in his present position smoking
  his fat cigar. And being well aware of the fact he had a feeling of gratitude
  towards this large Englishman with an eyeglass. He would even have gone as
  far, he told himself, as to reduce his terms for him&mdash;than which no more
  can be said.</p>

  <p>"I remember it well, Misther Maitland," he said humbly. "Those sonths of
  dogs."</p>

  <p>"Cut it out, Isaac. You richly deserved all you got. However, you can now
  do something to repay what I did. Don't turn pale: as I said before it is
  information, not money, I want. Now in the first place&mdash;what do you know
  of Sir Montague Barnet?"</p>

  <p>The Jew stared at him shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"I suppoth you don't mean whath written in <i>Whoth Who</i>?" he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Correct," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know anything perthonally, but..."</p>

  <p>He waved his hands deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," cried Jim. "But. Get on with it, Isaac: I want my dinner. No
  good pretending to me that you fellows are not all hand in glove with one
  another."</p>

  <p>"Well, in the course of bithineth we do hear things," admitted the other.
  "And a friend of mine did tell me that he had accommodated Sir Montague two
  or three timeth."</p>

  <p>"As man to man, Isaac, is he in Queer Street?"</p>

  <p>And for once the Jew did not beat about the bush.</p>

  <p>"Yeth, Misther Maitland: he ith."</p>

  <p>"So far, so good. What you've said merely confirms what I've already
  heard. Now for the next item. Do you know anything about a private gambling
  den in Oakleigh Avenue up in Hampstead?"</p>

  <p>And for the fraction of a second there appeared in the moneylender's eyes
  a look which Jim found difficult to interpret. Almost it seemed to him there
  was fear in them: certainly surprise. It went as instantaneously as it
  appeared, but it did not escape the notice of one of the finest poker players
  in the world.</p>

  <p>"Never heard of it, Misther Maitland," said the Jew.</p>

  <p>"You're lying, Isaac," said Jim quietly. "I should have thought a man in
  your profession would have more control over his face. Now I realise there is
  no reason why you should answer me: at the same time I did you a good turn
  once. So once again I ask you the question. What do you know of that gambling
  den?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask, Misther Maitland?" said the other at length.</p>

  <p>"Why does one generally ask a question?" remarked Jim. "Because, Isaac, I
  want to hear your answer."</p>

  <p>And once again the other hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Get on with it, man," said Jim impatiently. "You've admitted now that you
  know about it: you can either tell me or not as you like. But I don't want to
  sit here all night."</p>

  <p>"There certainly ith a houth in Oakleigh Avenue where they play," said the
  Jew suddenly. "But I've never been there mythelf."</p>

  <p>"Is this man Barnet mixed up with it in any way?"</p>

  <p>"He may be, Misther Maitland: he may be."</p>

  <p>"And where does a blind dwarf come into the affair?"</p>

  <p>The question shot out like a bullet from a gun, and the effect on the
  moneylender was remarkable. He sat up as if he had been stung by a hornet,
  and the hand holding his cigar trembled visibly.</p>

  <p>"A blind dwarth, Misther Maitland," he muttered. "I don't know what you
  are talking about."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," said Jim wearily, "you are the world's most indifferent liar.
  If you don't know what I'm talking about, why did my question bring on an
  attack of blind staggers? I'm interested in that man, Isaac," he continued
  gently, "and I would greatly appreciate any information you can give me about
  him. What, for instance, is his name?"</p>

  <p>But the Jew shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about any blind dwarth, Misther Maitland," he said
  doggedly. "As I told you I've never been to the houth, and if there ith a
  blind man there I don't know who it ith. I'm thorry I can't help you."</p>

  <p>"Won't, you mean&mdash;not can't," said Jim curtly.</p>

  <p>He rose, and ignoring the other's proffered hand, went to the door.</p>

  <p>"So long, Isaac. I'm not sure it wouldn't have been wiser to have let you
  fend for yourself in Marseilles that time."</p>

  <p>He strolled back to his club, turning the conversation over in his mind.
  That Isaac Goldstein knew the blind man was obvious, and he regretted now
  that he had ever been to see him. He had done no good by the interview, and
  if, as seemed more than likely, the moneylender passed on the fact that he
  had been to see him it would be definitely disadvantageous. The others would
  know that he was not going to let the matter drop.</p>

  <p>Still the mischief could not be undone. On the spur of the moment he had
  fired the question at the Jew, and he could only make the best of it. One
  thing, however, was clear. Not only did the moneylender know the dwarf, but
  he also stood in fear of him. Nothing else could account for Goldstein's
  whole manner when speaking. And he found his curiosity with regard to the
  blind man growing.</p>

  <p>Common sense told him that the Isaac Goldsteins of this world are not
  generally afraid of men of unimpeachable morals. And the point that arose was
  what niche in the social scheme the dwarf adorned. Was he merely the owner or
  part owner of a gambling house, or was he something bigger? If the former
  there was no adequate reason for Goldstein's nervousness: if the latter it
  seemed possible he was getting into deeper waters than he had anticipated. In
  which case the sooner he got further information the better. And as he turned
  in to his club it suddenly struck him that there was another source of
  obtaining it available. Clement Hargreaves dined there most evenings, and
  though he was as secretive as an oyster it was possible he might be persuaded
  to open his mouth. There were few people connected even remotely with the
  underworld whom Clem did not know, and the dwarf would be an easily
  recognisable figure.</p>

  <p>He found him, as luck would have it, sipping a glass of sherry in the
  smoking-room, and tackled him forthwith.</p>

  <p>"Are you still in your hush-hush job, Clem?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I still do my poor best to safeguard righteous citizens," answered the
  other with a grin. "Have a drink, Jim: it's about five years since we
  met."</p>

  <p>"I want you to tell me something, old man, if you will."</p>

  <p>"And if I can."</p>

  <p><i>"Ça va sans dire."</i></p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette: he had decided to adopt the same line as he had done
  with the sergeant at Streatham.</p>

  <p>"Last night I went to a house up Hampstead way for a bit of a gamble.
  Organised place, you know."</p>

  <p>"I don't," said the other. "They spring up like mushrooms, those spots. Go
  on."</p>

  <p>"And there I met a gentleman who interested me. He stood about five foot
  high: he possessed the chest and shoulders of a giant: he was blind. Do you
  know anything about him?"</p>

  <p>Hargreaves finished his drink, and in his turn lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"In what capacity did you meet him?" he enquired at length.</p>

  <p>"I should imagine he had something to do with the place," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"And is that the reason of your interest in him?"</p>

  <p>"You cautious old devil," laughed Jim. "Are you asking for information, or
  am I?"</p>

  <p>But there was no answering smile on the other's face.</p>

  <p>"I know your record better than most men, Jim," he said quietly. "And I
  know there is no one of my acquaintance more capable of looking after himself
  than you are. Nevertheless, if you and the man you've described fell foul of
  one another last night in any way, I can only give you one piece of advice.
  Do not go near that house again."</p>

  <p>"We progress," said Jim. "It is clear that you know the bird. Why this
  animosity against him?"</p>

  <p>"There can't be two men answering to your description," continued
  Hargreaves. "And I have no hesitation in saying that he is one of the most
  dangerous swine out of prison at the moment. He passes under the name of Emil
  Dresler, and he possesses an American passport. His activities are many and
  varied. At one time he was mixed up in the white slave traffic, but as far as
  we know he has given that up now. He's a blackmailer, and a drug trafficker.
  He is a moneylender on a large scale. We are also practically certain that he
  is responsible for at least two murders."</p>

  <p>"Splendid," said Jim mildly. "Would it be indiscreet to ask why this
  charming individual is out of prison?"</p>

  <p>"The reason is simple: we can't get any proof. He's a damned sight too
  clever. He covers his tracks with such infernal skill that we can't bring
  anything home to him. He is the brain, and he leaves other people to do the
  job. And they in their turn pass it on to someone else, till in the end it is
  impossible to trace his hand in it at all. It's the old question&mdash;we
  know but we can't prove. If we had half a chance we'd deport him like a shot,
  but so far he hasn't given it to us."</p>

  <p>"He seems a cheery lad," laughed Jim. "So you think I'd better cut him off
  my visiting-list?"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine how he ever got on it. He's a gentleman who keeps himself
  very much in the background. And if he is running a gambling den, you can bet
  your bottom dollar there's more behind it than what he makes out of the
  <i>cagnotte</i>. Was the place on the square?"</p>

  <p>"Quite, as far as I could see," answered Jim. "But in view of your warning
  I shall not revisit it."</p>

  <p>He turned the conversation: further questions with regard to the place
  might prove difficult to answer. The last hour had provided him with more
  information than he had dared hope for, and with a nod to Hargreaves he
  sauntered off towards the dining-room. On the way he picked up an evening
  paper. It was the latest edition, but even the Stop Press news contained no
  mention of the finding of any dead body.</p>

  <p>In itself the fact proved nothing. He was more than ever convinced after
  Hargreaves's remarks that he would find the place closed down. The bigger the
  man behind it the less would he be disposed to run any risk of trouble with
  the police. And connection with a gambling den would be quite enough to give
  the authorities the chance they needed to deport Mr. Emil Dresler. So what
  really was the object in going there at all?</p>

  <p>He pondered the point over the soup: he ruminated on it over the fish. And
  by the time the Scotch woodcock arrived he had decided&mdash;to go. Object or
  no object he knew that he would have no peace of mind until he had made sure
  for himself that the body was not there still. What he proposed to do about
  it he was not sure: sufficient unto the moment would be the decision
  thereof.</p>

  <p>The hall-porter beckoned to him as he left the dining-room: a letter had
  just arrived for him. It was in a woman's handwriting&mdash;one that was
  unknown to him, and having ordered a brandy with his coffee in the
  smoking-room he opened it. And the first words that caught his eye were the
  signature&mdash;Judy Draycott. He opened out the sheet and began to
  read.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Wednesday afternoon<br>
  37a Langham Square<br>
  Telephone: Grosvenor A123</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Mr. Maitland,</p>

  <p class="letter">You may remember that we met last night&mdash;or was it
  this morning?&mdash;at the beer and bones party. And I then inflicted on you
  a long and I'm afraid boring story about my brother and hidden treasure in
  South America. Well, this morning a development has taken place. I told you,
  didn't I, that Arthur had written to me to say that if anything should happen
  to him I would find a letter addressed to me at my bank. And though I suppose
  you think I'm foolish I've been down every morning to see if there was
  anything. This morning there was. The envelope was a mere scrawl, though I
  recognised his writing at once: the post mark was London. And inside was a
  half sheet of paper with a drawing on it and some words. The drawing looks to
  me like a map&mdash;there's a north point marked on it: but the extraordinary
  thing is that it's not all there. It's sort of like half a map. Some of the
  words are cut in two, or if not, they don't make sense.</p>

  <p class="letter">However, I could explain it so much more easily to you than
  write it. You see apart from whether it may mean anything or not I'm so
  terribly worried as to whether anything has happened to him. He must have
  been in London yesterday, so why hasn't he been to see me? Or rung up, or
  something? Do you think he has had an accident? I've rung up Scotland Yard,
  and looked in all the papers, but I can't find out anything.</p>

  <p class="letter">I hate to bother you, but could you possibly come round and
  see me to-morrow morning some time? I'd suggest this evening, but you may not
  get this letter in time, and anyway we've got a ghastly dinner party on. I'll
  stay in until lunch in hopes of your being able to manage it.</p>

  <p class="letter">I do hope you don't think I'm a terrible nuisance, but I
  really am most awfully worried.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p class="letter">Judy Draycott.</p><br>

  <p>With a faint smile Jim Maitland folded up the letter and put it in his
  pocket. Then the smile faded, and he sat staring in front of him. This was an
  unexpected development, and one that required thought. It confirmed&mdash;if
  confirmation was necessary&mdash;that the dead man was her brother, but it
  did not make things any easier with regard to telling her. And yet what was
  he to say when she asked him&mdash;as she undoubtedly would&mdash;if he
  thought any accident had happened? He must either tell her the whole thing,
  or keep it entirely dark.</p>

  <p>For the moment he dismissed that side of the problem, and concentrated on
  the other. A kind of map. It was clear that there was something in this yarn
  about the treasure, or at any rate that her brother had <i>thought</i> there
  was. Had the boy then had some premonition of danger which had impelled him
  to send it to her bank? And why did she say like half a map?</p>

  <p>There came back to him suddenly the big man's words the night
  before&mdash;"You damned fool&mdash;you've wrecked the whole thing." What
  whole thing? It was a queer remark to make over the murder of a man after a
  gambling quarrel. It might, of course, allude to the fact that it would be
  necessary to shut down the house: on the other hand it might not. And the
  more he thought of it, the more probably did it seem to him that there was
  something bigger in the whole affair than met the eye at first sight. Or, as
  he had qualified it before, that there was something which certain people
  <i>thought</i> was bigger. Which came to the same thing at the present
  moment.</p>

  <p>He pressed out his cigarette and rose: there was one thing he could do at
  once which would not commit him to any particular course of action in the
  future. He went to the telephone and rang up Grosvenor A123. A man's voice
  answered and he asked to speak to Miss Draycott. She came almost at once, and
  her first words were&mdash;"Is that you, Arthur?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not, Miss Draycott," he said gently. "It's Maitland
  speaking."</p>

  <p>He heard the little sigh of disappointment, and felt horribly guilty. Poor
  girl! if she only knew the truth.</p>

  <p>"I got your note," he went on, "and I'll come round to-morrow about noon.
  And in the meantime I want you to be sure that that piece of paper is not
  lost. Is there a safe in the house?"</p>

  <p>"No: there isn't," came her voice. "Mr. Maitland, it's most extraordinary
  that you should have rung up about that. Do you think it's really
  valuable?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Because I'm certain that while we were at dinner to-night somebody tried
  to burgle my room."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard," said Jim. "Where are you speaking from? Where's the
  telephone? Wait a minute&mdash;don't answer. Only say yes or no to my
  questions. Is it in the hall?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Can you be overheard?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Then be careful. Now one more question&mdash;are you prepared to trust me
  implicitly?"</p>

  <p>Came a soft laugh. "What can I say but&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"You haven't known me very long, have you?" he answered. "And what I'm
  going to ask you to do will entail a lot of faith in a comparative stranger.
  Now is there a letter-box anywhere near your house? Just say yes or no."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Could you slip out and post a letter there now at once?"</p>

  <p>"Yes: quite easily."</p>

  <p>"Then would you put that paper in an envelope, address it to me here at
  the club, and post it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if you think..."</p>

  <p>There was the faintest perceptible pause and her voice sounded a little
  doubtful.</p>

  <p>"I do think," said Jim quietly. "His Majesty's post is the safest thing in
  the world, Miss Draycott. But put it in the box yourself. I will bring it
  round with me to-morrow, and we'll discuss the whole thing."</p>

  <p>"All right," she said with sudden determination. "I'll do it now."</p>

  <p>"Good!" he cried. "And one word more. Do not, if you'll take my advice,
  talk about it to anyone."</p>

  <p>"I see that you do think there is something in it." There was a note of
  excitement in her voice.</p>

  <p>"There may or may not be," he answered guardedly. "If there isn't it
  doesn't matter: if there is that paper is safer in the post than in your
  house. Good night, Miss Draycott: I'll be round about twelve to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He rang off and left the box thoughtfully. So she seemed to think that
  someone had tried to burgle her room. Was that <i>another</i> coincidence?
  Surely it could not be. And as Jim Maitland reentered the smoking-room he
  proposed a silent but hearty vote of thanks to his cousin for having taken
  him to the Bright Young Thing's entertainment.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">"DO you think we'll have any luck, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't a notion, my dear fellow. I'll answer your question in half an
  hour."</p>

  <p>The two men had just turned into Oakleigh Avenue. The car had been left in
  a garage in Hampstead, as Jim Maitland feared it might prove conspicuous if
  left standing in the road. Moreover he had no idea how long his visit would
  take. The road was as deserted as the previous night: save for an occasional
  taxi homeward bound with a theatre party they saw no one for the first
  quarter of a mile.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll recognise the house," he said at length. "If not we'll go to
  where you had your party and cast back. I'll get it then for a certainty.
  Hullo! what's the excitement in front?"</p>

  <p>He paused, pulling his cousin into the shadow. A car was drawn up about a
  hundred yards ahead and some men were standing by it. An altercation of sorts
  was in progress: their voices&mdash;though not the actual words&mdash;could
  be clearly heard. And one, at any rate, seemed very angry.</p>

  <p>"We'll saunter on slowly, Percy. For it seems to me they must be fairly
  adjacent to the house we want."</p>

  <p>"I tell you it's a damned scandal." Suddenly the sentence came distinctly.
  "We'll break the blasted place open. It's a club, isn't it? They've got no
  right to shut."</p>

  <p>They were close now, and by the light of a street lamp, they could see
  what was happening. There were four men in evening clothes, and three of them
  were trying to pacify the fourth, and get him back into the car.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you fool," cried one of them, glancing over his shoulder. "The
  place is closed." And then in a hoarse mutter as he saw Jim and his
  cousin&mdash;"Police."</p>

  <p>Still protesting angrily the fourth man allowed himself to be pushed into
  the car, which drove rapidly away.</p>

  <p>"Took us for plain-clothes men," said Jim with a laugh. "And that answers
  one of our questions. Evidently no gambling to-night. And it also marks down
  the house."</p>

  <p>He inspected it carefully and after a while he nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes: this is the spot. There's the tree I stood behind last night. But
  they're all so confoundedly alike, these houses up here. Now, Percy, my boy,
  the fun begins&mdash;or let's hope so."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right, laddie," said his cousin gloomily. "Personally
  it's not my idea of laughter and games. The bally place gives me the
  willies."</p>

  <p>Jim laughed.</p>

  <p>"Cheer up," he cried. "It's much livelier inside."</p>

  <p>He took a swift glance up and down the road: then he opened the gate and
  stepped into the drive. And then for a moment he paused with his eyes fixed
  on a patch of ground on which the street lamp shone.</p>

  <p>"See that," he said quietly. "That deepish track. There has been a heavy
  vehicle in here to-day. Probably a pantechnicon. The birds have flown all
  right, or I'm a Dutchman."</p>

  <p>"You're quick, Jim," said his cousin. "I'd never have noticed that."</p>

  <p>"Because your eyes aren't trained," answered the other. "You see, but you
  don't observe. Come on&mdash;there's no good standing here. Though I'm afraid
  we're going to have our trouble for nothing."</p>

  <p>He led the way swiftly to the back of the house. The window was open, just
  as he had left it, and without further ado he swung himself into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Not a sound," he whispered, as his cousin joined him. "Keep your torch
  handy."</p>

  <p>Carefully screening his own from the window behind him, he switched it on.
  And for the second time he stood very still with his eyes fixed on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Do you see that?" he breathed. "I wonder what it means. It's
  odd&mdash;very odd."</p>

  <p>The dust still lay thick on the floor, and as he turned his torch from
  side to side his cousin began to grasp what he was driving at. Across the
  centre of the room were the imprints of very visible footmarks which went
  from the window towards the door. In one of them Jim Maitland placed his
  foot: it fitted exactly. They were his tracks of the previous night. But they
  were not the only ones. Sometimes crossing one another, but for most of the
  way as clear and distinct as those made by Jim were other footsteps. And it
  was at these that he was intently peering.</p>

  <p>The foot was small&mdash;like a woman's, and the distance between each
  step was short&mdash;so short, in fact, that the tracks might have been made
  by a child. That they were all the work of one person was obvious, but beyond
  that Percy's brain failed to advance. Some small girl presumably had been
  running round the room, and he failed to see why the matter should interest
  his cousin.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Percy?" came in a whisper from Jim.</p>

  <p>"Looks as if a girls' school had been having a dancing lesson, old lad.
  Let's push on: this room gives me the hump."</p>

  <p>"You fat-headed blighter. Do you mean to say you can't read those marks?
  Look at that set of tracks."</p>

  <p>Jim focussed his torch on one of them.</p>

  <p>"Which way was the person going who made those?"</p>

  <p>"From the window to the door," answered his cousin.</p>

  <p>"Good boy. And now those?"</p>

  <p>"From the door to the window."</p>

  <p>"Getting quite bright. Now take the last lot."</p>

  <p>"They are from the window to the door."</p>

  <p>"Right again. Now think it out. Two lines from the window to the door, and
  only one from the door to the window. And all the same person."</p>

  <p>Percy's brain wrestled with the problem manfully.</p>

  <p>"Whoever did it must have been ga-ga," he said at length. "I mean, fancy
  running about this place for fun."</p>

  <p>"And how did the person run? Where did he start from&mdash;the door or the
  window?"</p>

  <p>Once again Percy's brain creaked.</p>

  <p>"Window to door," he muttered. "Door to window: window to door."</p>

  <p>"Not quite right, Percy&mdash;but near enough. So where is he now?"</p>

  <p>And suddenly the full significance of it sank in.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he cried. "He must be in the house."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said Jim. "Therefore don't shout, and keep your wits about
  you. For it was no small girl who made those tracks. Now&mdash;follow
  me."</p>

  <p>They passed up the stairs into the hall. Percy close on his cousin's
  heels. What had seemed perfectly priceless in the club was not turning out
  quite such good value as he had expected. From outside came the sound of a
  passing car: then the same deathly silence settled on the house again.</p>

  <p>"Jim," he whispered.</p>

  <p>There was no answer, and putting out his hand he encountered air. His
  cousin was not there.</p>

  <p>"Jim." The whisper was louder, and the next instant a hand gripped his
  arm, so unexpectedly that he almost cried out.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you young idiot. I thought you were behind me. I've been up to
  the first landing."</p>

  <p>"How jolly," remarked Percy. "Are you going up again?"</p>

  <p>"To the second floor," whispered Jim. "Had a look at the roulette room:
  everything dismantled, as I expected."</p>

  <p>He was creeping up the stairs as he spoke, and at the top of the flight he
  paused.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear anything?" he breathed in the other's ear.</p>

  <p>But Percy could hear nothing save the thumping of his own heart, and was
  only conscious of a strong desire to flee. If this was the normal manner of a
  burglar's life he proposed to stick to bigamy in the crime line.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I was mistaken," whispered Jim. "Come on."</p>

  <p>They crept up the next flight, and again Jim stopped.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to switch on my torch," he muttered. "If we're
  caught&mdash;we're caught."</p>

  <p>But the passage was empty, and he flung open the door of the room where
  the body had been. Then like a flash he stepped back: opening doors can be a
  dangerous occupation. But nothing happened, and after a while he entered.</p>

  <p>The room was as he had left it, save that there was no trace of the dead
  man. None of the furniture had been moved: papers still littered the top of
  the desk.</p>

  <p>"Stay by the door, Percy," he said quietly. "No&mdash;not in the centre,
  old lad: stand to one side. And keep your ears skinned for any sound."</p>

  <p>He flashed his torch over the papers on the desk, but beyond a few bills
  and receipts there was nothing of any interest. They were made out to Mr. M.
  Johnson, which might have been genuine or might not: anyway, they did not
  advance things.</p>

  <p>He knelt down on the floor where the body had been, and after a while his
  attention was attracted by a small piece of paper that was lying just under
  the bottom of the desk. It was so placed that had he not been on his hands
  and knees he would never have noticed it, the desk would have hidden it. He
  picked it up and examined it: then he whistled softly to himself.</p>

  <p>It was clearly one corner of a larger piece of paper. It had been torn off
  violently; the distortion of the paper was obvious. Moreover it was
  discoloured as if it had been held tightly between a finger and thumb which
  were warm. Was it possible, he reflected, that this scrap had been in the
  dead man's hand, and had fallen under the desk when he himself fell?</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>He held it up to the light and studied it carefully. The two letters WE
  had been written in indelible pencil, and were presumably part of a longer
  word. But the main point of interest lay not so much in what it might
  mean&mdash;with such a small clue that was bound to be a closed book to them
  for the time&mdash;but in the fact of its presence at all. Because it seemed
  to Jim that that scrap of paper justified his line of action. There was
  something more to it than a mere gambling row, and it was going to be his job
  to find out what. He put it carefully in his pocket-book, and straightened
  up. And he was on the point of telling his cousin that they would hook it
  when he heard the unmistakable sound of a board creaking in the passage
  outside. He signalled to Percy to stand still: then he waited motionless, his
  torch focussed on the floor. He knew that in a moment or two he would see
  again that misshapen figure, and in spite of the element of surprise being
  absent a queer little thrill ran through him. There came another creak, and
  the dwarf was standing in the room.</p>

  <p>He saw Percy give an uncontrollable start: then for a while the three of
  them stood without movement. Suddenly the blind man switched on the light,
  walked to the desk and sat down. He picked up the telephone, and Jim made a
  sign with his hand towards the door. If possible he wanted to get away
  without being discovered, and as silently as a cat he crossed the room.</p>

  <p>"Is that Exchange? Mr. Johnson, of 95, Oakleigh Avenue, speaking. My call
  is for rather an unusual purpose. Would you make quite sure you have the name
  and address correct? Perhaps you would repeat it. Yes: that's quite right.
  Well, would you make a special note in case a call comes through for him,
  that a Mr. Jim Maitland is with me at the moment? Yes: Jim Maitland. Thank
  you so much. I regret having to trouble you."</p>

  <p>He put down the receiver and lay back in his chair with a smile, while Jim
  Maitland stood in the centre of the room staring fascinated at him. As far as
  he knew he had not made a sound, and yet the little devil had spotted
  him.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Maitland." His voice was suave. "Won't you introduce
  your friend? You can, of course, if you prefer it go away. At the same time,
  having taken all the trouble you have, a little chat might clear the
  air."</p>

  <p>"How long have you known I was here?" asked Jim curiously.</p>

  <p>"Ever since you arrived," replied the other. "You are the most silent
  mover, Mr. Maitland, that I have ever met, and I congratulate you on it. But
  I have certain advantages, as you know. I trust your little experience last
  night has done you no harm."</p>

  <p>Jim Maitland lit a cigarette, and pulling up a chair, sat down. The
  situation was a novel one for him. Not for many years had he found himself
  similarly placed. On several occasions he had been in tight corners, where
  only quick shooting and his great strength had saved him. But that had been
  physical: this was mental. And not since he could remember, did he recall
  having been up against one man who so definitely threatened him with an
  inferiority complex.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," continued the blind man. "Make yourself comfortable. And
  your friend too. By the way, you still have not introduced us."</p>

  <p>"It would be a little awkward for you if he happened to be connected with
  the police," remarked Jim.</p>

  <p>"A little," agreed the other. "But I happen to know he is not. The police
  do not as a general rule own Bentleys or belong to the Dorchester club."</p>

  <p>"True, Mr. Dresler&mdash;very true."</p>

  <p>"Did that rat Goldstein tell you my name?" snapped the dwarf.</p>

  <p>"Your information with regard to my movements seems fairly complete,"
  remarked Jim. "It is refreshing to find something you don't know. However,
  for your benefit it was not Goldstein. He disowned all knowledge of you,
  though I fear he did not do it very well. No, Mr. Dresler, it appears that
  you are quite a well-known character in the criminal world."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me," said the other. "At the same time your use of the word
  criminal is hardly polite."</p>

  <p>"And I was just wondering," continued Jim, "what would be the result if I
  used your telephone, not for the exchange, but for the police station."</p>

  <p>The blind man waved a deprecating hand.</p>

  <p>"I admit, Mr. Maitland, that such a course is possible. Though I should
  hate to think that you would do anything so crude. What, incidentally, would
  you tell them?"</p>

  <p>"The truth," said Jim briefly. "As seen by me last night."</p>

  <p>"As I said, such a course is possible," repeated the other. "Nevertheless,
  there are one or two small points that strike me. In the first place what are
  you both doing in this house, and how did you get in?"</p>

  <p>"You know quite well how I got in."</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, of course. But the police would want to know. And to the
  official eye it looks very like house-breaking. A serious offence, Mr.
  Maitland. Then there is a further point. Why not tell the police at Streatham
  this afternoon whatever story you are proposing to tell them now?"</p>

  <p>"Agreed," said Jim. "They would probably be very angry with me. But, Mr.
  Dresler, they would, I think, be even more angry with you."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it. After all, your conduct to the official eye has been most
  reprehensible. You arrived here last night, having broken into the house, in
  a condition of disgusting drunkenness. So violent did you become that I was
  on the point of summoning assistance when mercifully you fell asleep. And two
  friends of mine very kindly laid you out to cool somewhere."</p>

  <p>"Do you deny that a man was shot in this room last night?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Maitland&mdash;what an absurd delusion. You must have been
  more drunk even than I thought. It is perfectly true that a man was knocked
  down. But&mdash;shot! Why, where is the body? What has become of it? And if
  that is the accusation you have to bring&mdash;the gravest of all,
  murder&mdash;it was doubly reprehensible of you not to tell the police at
  once."</p>

  <p>In spite of himself Jim laughed.</p>

  <p>"You damned little scoundrel," he said. "Where is this conversation
  leading to?"</p>

  <p>"That, my friend, remains to be seen," answered Dresler. "To be quite
  truthful, Mr. Maitland, I had to assume that you would pass on your strange
  delusion to the police as soon as you recovered. I therefore made my plans
  accordingly. When, however, I found that you had said nothing I revised my
  estimate of your character. I had you shadowed from the time you left the
  police station, and it soon became clear that you were going to play a lone
  hand. Your conversation with Goldstein confirmed the fact."</p>

  <p>"So he passed it on, did he?" said Jim.</p>

  <p>"At once," replied the other. "Now I like people who play lone hands. They
  belong by unquestioned right to the fellowship of one. Shall we play on the
  same side, or not? Shall we join forces, or shall we fight?"</p>

  <p>"The proposition requires thought," said Jim, with a warning glimpse at
  his cousin who with his mouth open and his eyes almost falling out of his
  head had been following the conversation in silence.</p>

  <p>"What advantage is it to you," he continued, "if we amalgamate?"</p>

  <p>"I will be candid," said the blind man. "From enquiries I have made about
  you to-day I have learned several things. You are, I gather, one of those men
  who like adventure for adventure's sake. You are further an almost legendary
  figure as far as a scrap is concerned. Last night I managed to control your
  drunken frenzy, but I am not under any delusions that I should be able to do
  it a second time. And, while I think of it, may I apologise for that absurd
  note you received. It was sent when I had no idea as to the manner of man you
  were."</p>

  <p>Jim laughed again.</p>

  <p>"I accept your apology," he said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," continued the other. "It is clear to me that you and I
  are going to see more of one another in the future. Your presence to-night
  proves that you are of&mdash;shall we say&mdash;a curious disposition. And,
  in brief, I would sooner have you on my side than against me. What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Your side in what?" asked Jim mildly. "Forgive my denseness, but you
  speak in riddles."</p>

  <p>"Is that so, Mr. Maitland?" said the other leaning forward. "Just how much
  do you know?"</p>

  <p>"It would seem," remarked Jim, "that there are one or two things on which
  you are not omniscient. However, I still await an answer to a very simple
  question. Your side in what? Running a gambling den?"</p>

  <p>The blind man sat silent, motionless: almost it seemed as if he was trying
  by some form of telepathy to read the other's brain. And his problem was as
  clear as if he had spoken aloud. Was it merely the sound of the shot that had
  brought Jim Maitland in the night before? Was it pure coincidence, or was
  there something more behind it? It was impossible for the dwarf to know of
  his acquaintance with Judy Draycott: at the same time men of Dresler's kidney
  are by nature ultra-cautious. And knowing as he did that Jim had recently
  returned from South America, the reason for his hesitation was obvious.</p>

  <p>"No: not that, Mr. Maitland," he said at length. "In fact owing entirely
  to you our little club below has ceased, as you doubtless observed on your
  way up. But it is possible that in the near future we might be of great
  assistance to one another."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"My strong point, if I may say so, lies more in the planning of schemes,
  and in their organisation, rather than in actually carrying them out. My
  infirmity is a great handicap. And as I say, I have great hopes that very
  shortly I shall be in a position to put a suggestion in front of you which
  will appeal enormously to a man of your temperament."</p>

  <p>"Why this altruism, Mr. Dresler?"</p>

  <p>"For the reason I have already stated. I would sooner have you on my side
  than against me. And from the estimate I have formed of your character it
  will be impossible to do what I would most prefer&mdash;dismiss you
  altogether."</p>

  <p>"Very frank," laughed Jim. "And what is the nature of this
  suggestion?"</p>

  <p>"Should you accept my proposal I will tell you in due course. I may say
  that it is perfectly legal."</p>

  <p>"That must be rather a novelty for you, Mr. Dresler," said Jim rising. "Of
  course, you will quite understand that it is impossible for me to commit
  myself in any way until you are more explicit. But at the same time, should
  your scheme appeal to me, I shall be quite prepared to consider it on its
  merits."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," remarked the dwarf. "And in view of our very amicable chat I
  can only regret that I took such an unnecessary precaution as to ring up the
  exchange. I think we understand each other perfectly."</p>

  <p>A faint smile crossed Jim's face, which would have caused the dwarf
  considerable uneasiness had he been able to see it.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," he agreed. "I shall await your suggestion with interest."</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime," said the other, "we may dismiss the question of the
  police, I take it?"</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," answered Jim. "A meddlesome body of men. Good night, Mr.
  Dresler. I have greatly enjoyed our chat."</p>

  <p>He signed to his cousin to follow him, and a few moments later they were
  both in the drive.</p>

  <p>"Don't speak," he said quietly. "I don't want to run the slightest risk of
  him hearing your voice. You may come in very useful later, my lad."</p>

  <p>They walked a hundred yards in silence, and then Percy exploded.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! man," he said, "you can't mean to join forces with that little
  reptile?"</p>

  <p>"Just as much," grinned Jim, "as he means to join forces with me. A
  thoroughly dangerous man, Percy, but unless I'm much mistaken, we've got five
  to four the better of him. In fact we've done a damned good evening's
  work."</p>

  <p>"He bluffed you good and hearty over the police," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Did he? I wonder. A lot that he said was perfectly true. They'd have
  asked me some very awkward questions."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but dash it all, old boy, it's a bit tough on the wretched blighter
  who was shot. I'd like to see somebody get it in the neck over that."</p>

  <p>"You can take it from me, Percy, that someone is going to get it in the
  neck before I've done with them. There's a good deal I haven't told you as
  yet: I wanted confirmation before I passed it on. To-night I've got it."</p>

  <p>"Confirmation of what?" demanded the other.</p>

  <p>"The fact that there was more in the whole thing than met the eye."</p>

  <p>"You mean that last night's shooting was not a mere gambling quarrel."</p>

  <p>"Possibly. But a better way of putting it would be that the man who was
  shot did not go there primarily to gamble. He went in connection with the
  scheme our friend suggested I should come in on."</p>

  <p>"I wonder who the poor devil was. A pity you don't know."</p>

  <p>"I do," remarked Jim. "And that, my lad, is where we've got five to four
  the better of him. He was Miss Draycott's brother."</p>

  <p>"Rot," said the other incredulously, stopping dead in his tracks. "How on
  earth do you know?"</p>

  <p>"The likeness of two peas to one another could not be greater," said Jim.
  "He only landed from South America yesterday&mdash;at least that is when the
  mail boat berthed&mdash;and what his movements were after that until he found
  himself in that gambling den I can't tell you. Who it was who persuaded him
  to go there I don't know. It may have been the dago who finally shot him: it
  may have been Barnet. The point is immaterial, anyway. What is important is
  that he had in his possession information which he believed to be of value.
  And what that little swine was trying to puzzle out to-night was whether I
  knew that fact or not. So finally he fenced. He alluded to a scheme, but said
  no word of what it was."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea?"</p>

  <p>"I have a very shrewd idea. And I have a further shrewd idea, Percy, that
  there's going to be a lot of fun in the near future for both of us&mdash;that
  is, if you care to come in."</p>

  <p>"You bet I will. I rather enjoy this sort of thing. But isn't it a bit
  rough on the girl, old lad&mdash;little Judy."</p>

  <p>"I know what you mean," said Jim. "But I acted with my eyes open. Telling
  her won't bring him back to life, and would inevitably have brought the
  police in. It might have resulted in the dago swinging, but I doubt it. So in
  the fullness of time we will take the law into our own hands and shoot him.
  But not yet."</p>

  <p>"Easy over the bricks," cried his cousin. "In my case the condemned man
  would not eat a hearty breakfast."</p>

  <p>"We won't do it here, Percy. I think we shall be going to South America
  shortly, and it is easy out there."</p>

  <p>"South America! What the devil are we going there for?"</p>

  <p>"Sea trip with a nice breath of ozone. And in the meantime just remember
  two things. First we have not been to Hampstead to-night: second and by far
  the more important, Miss Draycott and I have never met. A still tongue,
  Percy, and a sharp eye, and you'll be quite a credit to the family before
  I've done with you."</p>

  <p>They drew up at the door of the Dorchester, and Jim got out.</p>

  <p>"Night night, old lad. I'll put you wise to everything before long."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was with real curiosity he awaited the arrival of his
  letters the next morning. What was this strange document the dead man had
  sent to his sister? Was the whole thing a mare's nest, or could it be
  possible that by some strange fluke he had stumbled on something genuine?</p>

  <p>He recognised the writing at once, and sitting down in a deserted corner
  of the smoking-room he opened the envelope. There was a short covering note
  that he glanced at first.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Mr. Maitland"&mdash;it ran:</p>

  <p class="letter">I enclose the map. Am expecting you about twelve.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p class="letter">Judy Draycott."</p><br>

  <p>Then he turned his attention to the enclosure. It was as she had said a
  map, or rather half a map. Evidently the original had been cut in two, and
  the murdered man's idea was obvious. He had kept one half himself: the other
  he had sent to his sister.</p>

  <p>The drawing was crude: the writing illiterate&mdash;just what might have
  been expected from an uneducated sailor.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2"
     name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305051h-images/TheIslandOfTerror-02.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>It was clearly meant to represent part of an island: the word CLIFFS
  proved that. HILL was clear, but what A was struck him as doubtful: possibly
  a tree. CKS and OMP he gave up. The writing at the bottom was no assistance
  either. Presumably the first word was FROM, in which case the first line
  read&mdash;FROM THE HILL A LINE SOUTH.</p>

  <p>He took out his pocket-book and studied the scrap of paper he had found
  the night before. From its shape and the position of the letters, it must be
  the bottom left-hand corner on the other half, and it seemed to him that WE
  might be the first half of west, so that he got&mdash;FROM THE HILL A LINE
  SOUTH WEST. RER LURKS AND TRESUR RICH was meaningless without the context. In
  fact the whole thing was useless without the other half. Whether it would
  prove of any value even with the other half was neither here nor there:
  without putting the two together no one could get any further.</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette: the main points of the
  situation were clear. Dresler and his friends had one half&mdash;save for the
  torn-off scrap in the corner: he had the other. But while he knew they had
  it, they were not in the same position over him. Which was where, as he had
  said to his cousin, he was five to four the better of them.</p>

  <p>That they had intended to kill young Draycott he did not believe for a
  moment: if they wanted him out of the way it could be done more easily and
  far more safely by methods other than shooting him in a house in London. But
  it happened and they had had to make the best of it. They had acted promptly
  and cleverly: but for the amazing freak of fate which had caused him to meet
  Judy Draycott just before he heard the shot he would actually have been in
  the position in which they thought he was&mdash;an accidental passer-by who
  had heard a shot. And had it not been for the fact that the Dago apparently
  knew his reputation, much of last night's conversation would not have taken
  place. Dresler feared him because his name was Jim Maitland, with a
  reputation for looking for trouble, and not because he knew anything of this
  particular affair.</p>

  <p>A new train of thought started. Did the other side know that half the map
  had been sent to Judy Draycott? Her remark to him over the telephone about
  her room having been tampered with while she was at dinner pointed to the
  fact that they did. It also pointed to the fact that they did not think the
  map was valueless. What proof they had, other than the dead man's word, he
  had no means of telling, but men like Emil Dresler do not embark on schemes
  unless they are sure of their facts. And if that was so, the point that arose
  was how was he to see the half that was in his? Or if possible to do more
  than see it, and actually get it? He would have not the slightest compunction
  in stealing it from them if he could&mdash;it was Judy Draycott's property,
  anyway: and then with the complete map in front of him he could use his own
  judgment as to whether the thing was worth while following up or not. But how
  to set about it was the problem. That it was a case for guile and not force
  was obvious, but beyond that main generalisation for the time being he could
  not get. And it was not until he had sat there for more than an hour that the
  glimmerings of a scheme began to dawn in his mind.</p>

  <p>Once more he studied his half of the map intently, only it was not at the
  drawing he was looking but at the paper. And the question he was debating in
  his mind was whether it would be possible to obtain an exactly similar
  quality and brand in London. It was cheap white paper, with a faint watermark
  that looked like a crown in the corner, and it had been made in all
  probability in South America. Could an exact replica be found here? On that
  point depended the whole idea, which was this.</p>

  <p>He could keep the Eastern and Western boundaries of the island exactly
  where they were: he would keep CKS and OMP in their proper positions; in fact
  he would alter nothing along the line of the scissor cut. But after that he
  would draw an entirely new map. The hill could be placed in a totally
  different place: also the thing marked A. And the wording at the bottom could
  be changed. As long as the two halves joined when put together, no suspicions
  would be aroused, provided always the paper matched exactly. And it thus
  might be possible to get a good look at the genuine other half, whilst only
  showing a fake of the one he held in his hand.</p>

  <p>There were many details to fill in, but he felt instinctively he was
  working on the right lines. And the first thing to do was to find out about
  the paper. But before going out he decided to telephone Judy Draycott.</p>

  <p>In view of the attention paid him by Dresler the preceding day, he would
  almost certainly be followed again. And at this stage of the proceedings it
  was vital to keep the other side in ignorance of the fact that they knew one
  another. It was too risky to go to her house: the point to be decided was
  where to meet her.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Jim, how's life?"</p>

  <p>Percy had just come in, and Jim drew him on one side.</p>

  <p>"I've got a job of work for you, young feller," he said. "I was just going
  to telephone, but you can take a message instead. It's safer. Go and see Miss
  Draycott, and tell her that I do not propose to come to her house this
  morning. Explain to her that for reasons which I'll give her later it would
  be most unwise for anyone to know that she and I have met, and that since I
  may be followed I don't want to go to Langham Square. And then, Percy, you
  will bring her to the ladies' entrance of the club here, and I will join you
  in due course."</p>

  <p>"Right you are, old boy. Presumably no word about last night?"</p>

  <p>"No word about anything&mdash;yet. And certainly no word about the
  brother, for she will almost certainly talk to you about him."</p>

  <p>He gave his cousin some ten minutes' start before following him into the
  street. And then he seemed in no great hurry. He stood on the pavement, his
  stick swinging loosely in his hand apparently enjoying the air. But when Jim
  Maitland was apparently doing something the betting was largely in favour of
  the fact that in reality he was doing something else. And in the short space
  of time he remained there before hailing a taxi his lynx eye had picked up
  two men whose appearance he mistrusted. They were both loitering there a
  little too obviously.</p>

  <p>He glanced backwards as the car turned into Pall Mall: they had got into
  another one and were following. And it occurred to him that there might be
  the possibility of a little fun. So leaning out of the window he told his
  driver to go slowly round St. James's Square until he told him to stop.</p>

  <p>"Round and round," he remarked. "The air there is peculiarly
  beneficial."</p>

  <p>Now, as all the world knows, there are five roads that lead out of St.
  James's Square, and it put the two gentlemen in a quandary. They dared not
  stop for fear their quarry would slip them by one of the five: at the same
  time when Jim had completed the circuit for the sixth time the situation
  became strained. And it became even more so when he stopped his machine and
  waved a genial hand at them.</p>

  <p>"Good fun, isn't it?" he called out as their car went past him. "Are we
  going to continue, or are we not?"</p>

  <p>The car pulled up and one of the men got out.</p>

  <p>"Were you speaking to us?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No, no, laddie. To the sparrow twittering in yonder tree."</p>

  <p>"Cut it out," snarled the other with a quick look round, "or you'll find
  yourself with a thick ear, my boy."</p>

  <p>Jim began to laugh silently.</p>

  <p>"You rat-faced excrescence," he said pleasantly, "you couldn't give a
  thick ear to a baby in arms. But I warn you quite seriously that if you
  continue to follow me I'll give you in charge to the nearest policeman. Your
  face and that of your friend are enough to turn the milk sour.... Ah! would
  you?"</p>

  <p>It happened quickly. Enraged by Jim's remarks the other had aimed a
  definite blow at his eyeglass. It failed to connect by at least a foot, but
  it was enough for Jim. And a moment later the man was standing helpless with
  his arm in a grip that felt like a steel vice.</p>

  <p>"God! man," he muttered savagely, "you're breaking my elbow."</p>

  <p>"No: merely bending it," Jim assured him. "And since you are in this
  position, I think I will call that policeman who has just entered the
  square.... Officer," he hailed.</p>

  <p>But the other man was not waiting for any policeman. With a tremendous
  effort he wriggled free, and ran back to his car which at once drove rapidly
  away. And Jim was again laughing silently when the majesty of the law
  approached.</p>

  <p>"Did you call, sir?" he said.</p>

  <p>"A mistake, officer," he remarked. "My friend who has just left me wanted
  to know the way somewhere, but I think he's found it."</p>

  <p>"Drove off pretty fast, sir."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Jim. "He did seem in a bit of a hurry, didn't he? Well, good
  morning, officer. Sorry to have troubled you."</p>

  <p>"Where to, sir?" asked the driver, as the policeman moved on.</p>

  <p>"Go to Hyman's in Little Portland Street," he answered. "It's a big paper
  shop."</p>

  <p>"Ugly sort of customer that, sir," went on the driver with a grin.</p>

  <p>"A damned fool," said Jim tersely. "I've seen some pretty inefficient
  efforts at following in my life, but that took the cake. Keep your eyes
  skinned in case we see them again, but I don't think we shall."</p>

  <p>Which proved to be correct: there was no sign of the other car when he
  paid off his own. Nevertheless he proposed to take no chances, and when one
  of the assistants asked him what he required he insisted on going to a remote
  corner of the shop.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to appear mysterious," he said with a smile, "but there's a bit of
  a jest on. And I don't want to be spotted."</p>

  <p>He produced the map from his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"I want to know," he went on, "if you can match this paper exactly. Very
  nearly is no good. The likeness must be so good that when the two halves are
  side by side anyone looking at them would say they were originally the same
  bit that had been cut in two."</p>

  <p>The assistant took it in his hand and examined it minutely.</p>

  <p>"There oughtn't to be much difficulty in that, sir," he pronounced at
  length. "I'll get a book of samples."</p>

  <p>They found what was wanted almost at once&mdash;a paper that was literally
  identical with the original, and Jim ordered half a dozen pieces. Then he
  started to stroll back towards his club. So far, so good: unfortunately it
  was not very far. The main part of the problem had still to be solved. To
  draw a faked substitute was now an easy matter, but how was he going to
  utilise it to the best advantage when he had done so?</p>

  <p>If it could possibly be avoided he did not want the other side to find out
  that he knew anything about the map. At the same time his whole scheme
  depended on the fact that the other half of the map should be seen. It was
  useless merely getting the fake to them by some method: that would give only
  a negative result to each side. He turned it over from every angle and at
  length the only possible way out occurred to him. It might fail, but he would
  have to take the risk. Judy Draycott was the person who must do it.</p>

  <p>Whether Dresler and his bunch knew that half had been sent to her or not
  didn't matter. It would arouse no suspicions in their minds when they found
  she had it in her possession. And so, somehow or other, she would have to
  contrive to see the other piece for long enough to memorise it roughly.
  Presumably it would be as simple and crude as the half he had, and given a
  minute or so to study it in, she should be able to reproduce it sufficiently
  accurately for them to have something to go on.</p>

  <p>One weak point lay in the fact that they might not let her see the other
  part. Another was the difficulty of her approaching them, so to speak, out of
  the blue. Why should she know anything about them at all? He did not even
  know if she and Barnet were acquaintances. Still those were minor
  difficulties: he was satisfied that the main idea was right. Judy Draycott
  was the only person who could do it, without giving things away. And if she
  did pull it off, and obtained a reasonable mental picture of the other half
  they would be in the pleasant position of having the truth, whilst the
  opponents possessed the map of an island, a large portion of which was
  completely imaginary. At which point in his reflections he turned into his
  club to find his cousin waiting for him with a worried look on his face.</p>

  <p>"She's gone, Jim," he said briefly.</p>

  <p>"Come on into the smoking-room," remarked Jim. "Now, then," he continued,
  after they had found two chairs, "what's this? You say she's gone. Where
  to?"</p>

  <p>"Can't tell you, old lad," answered the other. "The house belongs to an
  ancient gorgon&mdash;Lady Somebody or other, with whom Judy is staying. Well,
  I blew in and asked for the girl, but the butler pushed me into the presence
  of the most devastating old ruin you've ever imagined. Shook me badly,
  laddie, I don't mind admitting."</p>

  <p>"'Are you Mr. Maitland?' she boomed.</p>

  <p>"I admitted the soft impeachment, and she inspected me through
  <i>lorgnettes</i>.</p>

  <p>"'I confess I do not understand present-day mentality,' she went on, 'but
  Judy's brain must have left her temporarily. She said you were very
  good-looking and had a magnificent figure.'</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought she might have put it a little differently, but the
  family spirit pulled me through.</p>

  <p>"'That's where you scratch the wrong bite,' I said breezily. 'She alluded
  to my cousin who, I have been told, does bear a slight resemblance to me. He
  belongs to one of the cadet branches of our family.'"</p>

  <p>"You blithering idiot," Jim grinned. "Get on with it."</p>

  <p>"Apparently I'd said the wrong thing," continued Percy. "She sat there for
  quite a while with her mouth opening and shutting, and no noise occurred. I
  thought she'd slipped her uppers and was wondering what the devil to do if
  they zoomed into the hearth-rug, when she suddenly gave a harsh, croaking
  sound which turned after a while into semi-articulate speech.</p>

  <p>"'Scratch! Wrong bite! You wretched young man&mdash;how dare you?'</p>

  <p>"Well, I managed to pacify her: assured her it was a bit of modern slang,
  and at length, thank God! her breathing became normal again, and the deep
  magenta look left her face.</p>

  <p>"'Now,' I said chattily, 'what about our little Judy? We both, I expect,
  have to do this and that before worrying the mid-day bone.'</p>

  <p>"And little by little I extracted the account of the morning's doings. It
  appears Judy was giving the once over to the matutinal kipper by herself in
  the dining-room, when a woman called to see her. She couldn't tell me what
  sort of a woman as she herself does not shatter the <i>morale</i> of the
  house by appearing at breakfast. At any rate this woman had brought Judy a
  message from her brother."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" cried Jim sitting up. "Her brother?"</p>

  <p>"Just how I felt, old lad, when she said it," remarked Percy.</p>

  <p>"You didn't give anything away, did you?"</p>

  <p>"My face remained completely sphinx-like," said his cousin. "To continue.
  The result of the message was that Judy departed with this female, leaving a
  message for you to the effect that your proposed party at noon would have to
  be off."</p>

  <p>"Did she say where she was going?" demanded Jim.</p>

  <p>"Apparently not. At any rate not to the old trout. And I didn't quite like
  to ask to see her maid."</p>

  <p>"And she said nothing as to when she intended to return?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word. So having bowed to the Presence I left the house."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and gave an order to a passing waiter for the
  necessary.</p>

  <p>"So bringing the grey matter to work, Jim," he continued, "one thing
  becomes obvious. Either you made a mistake, or it is a trap."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," agreed his cousin. "And since I did not make a mistake..."</p>

  <p>He left the sentence uncompleted: how would this development affect his
  plan? That they contemplated doing any harm to the girl he dismissed from his
  mind: no possible object could be served by hurting her. Their object clearly
  was to get possession of her half of the map, and it therefore proved that
  they knew she had it. It further proved that they did <i>not</i> know she had
  sent it to him. But how long would they remain in ignorance of that fact? How
  long would it be before she told him?</p>

  <p>He frowned thoughtfully: another point had struck him. What were they
  going to do about the brother? The girl having been lured away by what she
  took to be a message from him would naturally expect to see him. Moreover,
  she would become very suspicious if she did not. And as they could not show
  her his dead body with a bullet hole through the heart it became a little
  difficult to see what they were going to do.</p>

  <p>He crossed to one of the writing-tables: the sooner he prepared the faked
  map the better. Things might eventuate at any moment, and he wanted to be
  prepared. For a while he again studied the map carefully: then he took one of
  the sheets of paper he had bought and picked up an indelible pencil.</p>

  <p>"That ought to do the trick," he muttered to himself ten minutes later. He
  put the genuine one in an envelope, and sent it with a covering letter to his
  lawyer: the fake he put in his pocket-book. Then picking up an illustrated
  paper he threw himself into an armchair. There was nothing he could do but
  wait.</p>

  <p>Just before lunch Percy returned from what he described as a cocktail date
  with a hen, and demanded the latest bulletin.</p>

  <p>"That's deuced bright of you, Jim," said his cousin admiringly when he had
  explained his idea. "But now that Judy has actually gone to them it's going
  to make things a bit harder."</p>

  <p>"You're right," agreed Jim. "We can only wait and see what happens. And
  since they haven't got what they wanted, something is bound to happen soon.
  She may tell 'em she sent the map to me: she may not. And until we know that,
  we're left guessing."</p>

  <p>"They won't do her any harm, will they?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Jim positively. "They'll guard her as the apple of their eye
  until they get the map And before they do that we step into the picture."</p>

  <p>They lunched, and then began an interminable afternoon. Jim did not dare
  to get out of reach of the telephone: Percy refused to run any risk of
  missing the fun. And so, sternly dismissing from their minds the fact that
  Patsy Hendren had been sixty not out at the luncheon interval, they
  dozed.</p>

  <p>The message came through just after five o'clock. A page roused them from
  their slumbers: Mr. Maitland was wanted on the telephone.</p>

  <p>"You go, Percy," said Jim. "If it is Miss Draycott find out where she is
  speaking from. If it sounds at all risky do the silly-ass stunt. But if she
  is in London get her round to the ladies' side here, the same as we arranged
  for lunch."</p>

  <p>"Right ho! laddie," cried the other. "You leave it to me."</p>

  <p>He came back almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"Speaking from Langham Square," he said. "She's coming at once. And, Jim,
  unless I'm much mistaken, there have been doings. Her voice was rather like
  that of an agitated hen."</p>

  <p>"Good!" cried Jim. "The sooner we get to it the better."</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to attend the pow-wow?" asked his cousin.</p>

  <p>Jim nodded.</p>

  <p>"But say nothing, at any rate at present, about her brother!"</p>

  <p>Judy Draycott was as good as her word: she came at once. And it struck Jim
  as he shook hands that she was even more attractive than he had thought at
  first. But there was a look of tense anxiety about her that brought him back
  to business at once.</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble, Miss Draycott?" he said as they sat down.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Maitland," she answered earnestly, "there's some devilry going on.
  I'm just worried to death."</p>

  <p>"I don't expect it's quite as bad as that," he said with a smile. "Young
  Percy and I have been having a lot of fun over your affairs too."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she said in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You shall hear in good time, Miss Draycott," he answered. "Let's get to
  your doings first. All that we know is that a female of sorts called on you
  at breakfast this morning, bringing a message from your brother, and you went
  away with her."</p>

  <p>"She had a car waiting outside," began the girl&mdash;"and I got in
  without hesitation. All that she had said in the house was that Arthur wanted
  me to come, and to bring with me the letter he had sent to my bank. That, of
  course, I couldn't do without coming round and getting it from you."</p>

  <p>"Which you'd have had considerable difficulty in doing," put in Jim
  quietly. "Did you mention you'd sent it to me?"</p>

  <p>"I did not. And really I can't think why I didn't&mdash;then. Because at
  the time I had no suspicions. I did think it a little strange that Arthur
  should have sent a woman as a messenger, but I was so keen to see him that I
  didn't bother about it much. I just dashed upstairs, told my aunt, and
  started off. It was a closed car, and a chauffeur in livery was driving. And
  after a while it began to strike me that my companion was very
  uncommunicative. Every question I put to her she answered in monosyllables.
  So at last I tackled her point blank."</p>

  <p>"'Is there anything the matter with my brother?'"</p>

  <p>"She tried to evade it for a bit, but I insisted. And to my horror I found
  he had been involved in a bad accident."</p>

  <p>The eyes of the two men met, but the girl was too intent on her story to
  notice.</p>

  <p>"He was in a nursing home, and his eyes had been affected. It was a motor
  accident, and his face had been badly cut about."</p>

  <p>"'Who is looking after him?' I demanded."</p>

  <p>"A Doctor Phillips, she told me, was in charge. I asked where the house
  was. It was on the outskirts of Mayfield in Sussex."</p>

  <p>"'But what on earth was he doing motoring down there,' I cried in
  amazement, and she shrugged her shoulders. She had no idea why he had been
  there: all she could tell me was that the crash had occurred about half a
  mile from their lodge gates and some workmen had carried him in.</p>

  <p>"We arrived at half-past eleven, and when I saw the house my heart sank.
  It was the most gloomy, depressing spot: anything less suited for a nursing
  home it would be impossible to imagine. And I think it was as we drove up to
  the door that suspicion first started in my mind. I caught the woman's eyes
  fixed on me, and though she immediately glanced away, there had been a funny
  look in them. And it was then, as I say, that I first began to wonder if all
  was well.</p>

  <p>"The door was opened by a man-servant, and as I stepped into the hall
  suspicion increased. The place was furnished after a fashion but there was a
  sort of musty smell about everything that you only get in a house that has
  been empty for some time. However, I said nothing, of course, and a moment
  later a man came down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"'This is Doctor Phillips,' said my companion.</p>

  <p>"He shook hands, and led the way into one of the downstair rooms.</p>

  <p>"'An unfortunate home-coming for your brother!' he said. 'Our matron has
  told you, I suppose?'</p>

  <p>"'She tells me that Arthur has been badly damaged in a motor accident,' I
  answered. 'And I should like to see him at once, please.'</p>

  <p>"He held up his hand.</p>

  <p>"'One moment, my dear young lady,' he remarked&mdash;and if there's one
  thing that drives me to drink it's being called that&mdash;'we must have a
  little chat first. To begin with, your brother is in a very excitable
  condition just at present&mdash;a condition which in view of the injuries to
  his face and eyes...'</p>

  <p>"'Eyes!' I cried.</p>

  <p>"'Didn't the matron mention that? Yes: I am sorry to say his eyes are
  involved. It is for that reason that we are keeping him in a dark room. But
  do not alarm yourself. With care and good nursing I feel confident he will
  retain his sight unimpaired, if&mdash;and this is very important, if&mdash;we
  can keep him calm. Any mental excitement is the worst possible thing for him.
  Now I naturally have no idea what he is talking about, but the very first
  moment he began to speak coherently last night he kept asking about some
  letter he had sent you. He must have it: he must have it at once. In vain for
  me to point out to the dear fellow that he couldn't read it: that it was safe
  with you until he had recovered. It was no use. And so I entrusted the matron
  when she came to get you to be sure and mention it, so that you could bring
  it. It will pacify him enormously. You have it, of course?'</p>

  <p>"And it was then, Mr. Maitland, I did some pretty rapid thinking. I was as
  convinced as I could be that there was something wrong. I knew that house was
  no nursing home, and I felt pretty well certain the man talking to me was no
  doctor. He was too suave and oily. Besides, genuine doctors don't allude to a
  complete stranger as a dear fellow. But what was I to do? I hadn't got it,
  and what was going to be the result when I told him so? I was convinced that
  it was the letter this man was after, and if he found out it wasn't there, he
  would pull more of his medical jargon out, tell me it would excite Arthur too
  much if I saw him without the letter, and insist that I should go back to
  London and get it before I could visit him. And I was determined that that
  should not happen. I was determined that by hook or by crook I would talk to
  Arthur before I left the house.</p>

  <p>"It's taken a long time to describe what I felt: it actually took a second
  to decide.</p>

  <p>"'Naturally,' I said. 'I'll hand it to him myself.'"</p>

  <p>"Well done," remarked Jim quietly. "How did he take that?"</p>

  <p>"Not very enthusiastically," she answered, "which merely increased my
  determination to see Arthur. But short of snatching my bag from me by force
  he could do nothing, and at last with a very bad grace he rose and left the
  room mumbling about seeing if Arthur was ready.</p>

  <p>"The instant the door was shut I flew to it and listened: he and the woman
  were having an argument in the hall outside. I couldn't hear what they were
  saying, but it sounded distinctly acrimonious. And again my suspicions
  increased: I <i>knew</i> the show was crooked.</p>

  <p>"The man came back in about five minutes, accompanied this time by the
  woman. He seemed to have recovered himself, and his smile was more oily than
  ever.</p>

  <p>"'This way, my dear young lady,' he said. 'And you will remember, won't
  you, that you may find your brother a little strange. The vocal
  chords&mdash;everything has been affected.'</p>

  <p>"We went upstairs, and my heart began to thump. Mr. Maitland&mdash;the
  house was empty. No sign of movement: no nurses: nothing at all that you
  always see in a nursing home. And he seemed to sense what I was feeling.</p>

  <p>"'Very slack time just now,' he remarked. 'Which will enable me to give
  all the more care to your brother.'</p>

  <p>"He flung open a door: the room beyond it was pitch dark.</p>

  <p>"'Ah! my dear fellow,' he cried, 'good news for you&mdash;joyous news.
  Your charming sister has arrived.'</p>

  <p>"I could see a man dimly in the darkness, whose face was covered with
  bandages.</p>

  <p>"'Arthur, old boy,' I cried, 'what rotten luck.'</p>

  <p>"'Hullo! Judy,' he said querulously, 'how are you? Have you got the
  letter? Have you brought it?'"</p>

  <p>The girl paused for a moment, and neither man spoke.</p>

  <p>"How I didn't scream," she went on, "I don't know. I'd suspected a lot
  before, but never this. The man with the bandaged face wasn't Arthur at all.
  It was just conceivable that the voice might have passed muster, but Arthur
  has never called me Judy."</p>

  <p>"'Humour him, please,' whispered the doctor to me, and then turned to the
  man. 'All right, my dear chap, your sister has got it. She's just going to
  give it to you.'</p>

  <p>"'The letter. I want the letter, Judy.'</p>

  <p>"My hands were trembling so much I could hardly open my bag. But one thing
  I realised&mdash;whatever happened I mustn't let them suspect that I knew it
  wasn't Arthur.</p>

  <p>"'Here it is, old boy,' I said, and then turned horror-struck to the
  doctor. 'Good heavens! Doctor Phillips,' I whispered. 'I forgot to put it
  in.'</p>

  <p>"And just for a moment I thought he was going to murder me.</p>

  <p>"'Forgot to put it in?' he snarled, and I saw the woman nudge him in the
  ribs. He pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"'Forgive me, Miss Draycott,' he said, 'but a shock like that to my
  patient is very dangerous indeed.'</p>

  <p>"He turned back into the room.</p>

  <p>"'Now, old fellow,' he said, 'your sister, naughty girl, was so overjoyed
  at the prospect of seeing you again that she forgot to bring the letter.
  Don't let it worry you: don't let it excite you: I know she will go back to
  London at once and get it. Won't you, Miss Draycott?'</p>

  <p>"'Of course I will, Arthur,' I said. 'I'm sorry I was so stupid.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, get it, Judy, at once,' he answered. 'It's important.'</p>

  <p>"And then the so-called doctor hustled me out of the room and down the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"'A most unfortunate mistake, Miss Draycott,' he said gravely. 'Had I
  suspected for a moment that you had not got the letter in your possession,
  nothing would have induced me to allow you to see your brother. We can only
  hope that the effect will not be serious. But I must beg of you to remedy it
  as quickly as possible. The car is there. Fly back to London in it, and
  return as soon as you can. As you see for yourself, he is in a most excitable
  condition, and he must not be worried in any way.'</p>

  <p>"So I started off alone in the car, and then came a real stroke of luck.
  The car broke down, and so I got rid of the chauffeur and came back by train.
  And now, Mr. Maitland, what I want to know is why they are keeping a man who
  isn't my brother in a nursing home that isn't a nursing home? And where is
  Arthur? And what does it all mean?"</p>

  <p>For a moment or two Jim hesitated. He realised that the time had come when
  she would have to be told the truth about her brother, and he did not exactly
  relish the prospect.</p>

  <p>"It's pretty clear, I'm afraid, Miss Draycott," he said gravely. "You
  realise, don't you, that your brother sent you half the map and kept the
  other half himself? He did it for safety, in case anything happened to him.
  And I'm very sorry to have to tell you that something has happened to
  him."</p>

  <p>"You mean he's hurt?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Worse than that, I fear. Miss Draycott, it's going to be the devil of a
  shock; but your brother is dead."</p>

  <p>She gave a little cry, and the two men rose and stood with their backs to
  her staring out of the window. And for a space there was silence in the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean he was killed?" she asked at length, and Jim nodded.</p>

  <p>"How do you know all this, Mr. Maitland?" she continued steadily.</p>

  <p>Briefly he told her the whole story. And when he had finished her eyes
  were bright and defiant: of the tears he had expected there was no trace.</p>

  <p>"Just tell me what you want me to do," she said, and Jim looked at her
  approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Great girl," he cried. "I knew you'd feel that way. Now this is how the
  land lies. The gang we are up against have in their possession the half of
  the map that your brother carried. What they are trying to get is the half he
  sent to your bank, and which you sent on to me. Evidently he must have told
  them what he had done: hence this elaborate scheme of to-day. And I think you
  can be extremely thankful, Miss Draycott, that you kept your head when you
  realised the man with his face bandaged was an impostor. Our opponents are
  not people who stick at trifles. Had you given yourself away then, I am more
  than doubtful if you'd be here now. However, that is by the way. You bluffed
  it through magnificently, and I want you to carry on the good work."</p>

  <p>"I'll do anything you say," she said, and once again he gave her a quick
  look of admiration.</p>

  <p>"You may remember I rather laughed at you when you first told me the
  hidden treasure story," he went on. "I'm not laughing now at all: I honestly
  believe there may be something in it. And if that is so you see where we
  stand: we must get their half. That is where you come in&mdash;if you feel
  like it."</p>

  <p>"Of course I feel like it!" she cried.</p>

  <p>"You know," he said doubtfully, "I must make it clear that if you care to
  you can go to the police and tell them what has happened to you."</p>

  <p>"What will occur if I do?"</p>

  <p>"I should think you would find that the birds have flown," said Jim. "And
  in addition to that we shall have given ourselves away to the other side. It
  will be a case of stalemate: each side will have one half of the map. And I
  want..."</p>

  <p>He broke off and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"So do I, Mr. Maitland. Let's wash out the police."</p>

  <p>Jim grinned.</p>

  <p>"Good for you. We'll wash out the police as you say. Now I don't suppose
  for a moment we'll be able to get their half, but with a little diplomacy we
  might get a good look at it. Perhaps even..."</p>

  <p>He paused, and a sudden gleam of ecstatic joy came into his eyes, a gleam
  that many men had seen to their cost.</p>

  <p>"However, that's my palaver," he continued. "Now I'm gambling on one fact.
  They expect you to go back there to-night&mdash;and you're going. Percy is
  going to drive you down. And you will take with you&mdash;this."</p>

  <p>He gave her the faked map, and she stared at it.</p>

  <p>"But this is different to what I sent you," she said.</p>

  <p>"Very different," he agreed. "I drew it myself. The genuine one is at my
  lawyers. But that one joins on to the other half. Which brings me up to the
  point I'm gambling on. They are not the sort of gentlemen who leave anything
  to chance, and I'm banking on them having their half there, to make sure on
  the spot, that you haven't sold them a pup."</p>

  <p>"So that I can get a look at it," she cried. "I see: I'll do it."</p>

  <p>"Supposing it doesn't come off we are no worse off than we were before.
  Leave them that: it's useless to them. They've got an island inspired by my
  second pink gin. We shall just have to try something else."</p>

  <p>"But where do you come in, old lad?" demanded Percy.</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Jim happily. "I shall remain outside the nursing home.
  Unless&mdash;I see an opportunity of entering with advantage. In which case I
  shall enter, and you, Miss Draycott, will exit. So should you hear two short
  blasts on Percy's klaxon, hop it like blazes in the car and leave me to my
  own sweet devices."</p>

  <p class="first">"YOU'RE a damned bungler, Waterlow. The girl isn't an
  imbecile, and this place looks as much like a nursing home as it does like a
  night club."</p>

  <p>A big man in a light overcoat was the speaker. His face was coarse and
  dissipated, and suddenly he pulled a flask from his pocket and took a deep
  drink. The only other occupant of the room shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You were in such an infernal hurry," he said, "that this was the best I
  could do in the time."</p>

  <p>"But why were you such a fool as to let her go upstairs," snarled the
  first speaker. "Her twin; and you imagine she won't spot it."</p>

  <p>"Dry up, Barnet," answered the other angrily. "I'm getting fed to the back
  teeth with you. She said she'd got the thing on her, and I believed her. Even
  if I hadn't, what do you suggest I should have done? Snatched her bag out of
  her hand to make sure. Of course she wouldn't have suspected anything then,
  would she? Might have gone further and slogged her over the head with a
  poker: that's what the doctor in charge of a home generally does to his
  female visitors."</p>

  <p>Sir Montague Barnet took another drink.</p>

  <p>"All right: all right," he grunted. "Don't go off the deep end about it. I
  know you did all you could. That slab of misery who fetched her should have
  seen that she brought it."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"She should be here by now if she's coming," he said uneasily. "It's past
  nine."</p>

  <p>"I'll go and see that everything is ready," remarked the other. "And don't
  smoke that cigar, and have the smell all over the house."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," grunted Barnet, replacing it in his case. "Though
  once we've got it," he continued with a leer, "she can suspect what she
  likes."</p>

  <p>"Can she?" said the other significantly. "I'm not so sure about that."</p>

  <p>He went out of the room, leaving the baronet cursing under his breath. And
  it was not until the flask had been requisitioned for the third time that he
  took from his pocket the counterpart of the map sent to Judy Draycott, and
  put it on the table in front of him.</p>

  <p>For the twentieth time he studied it only to give it up as a bad job.
  Where the deuce was A? Until they could get that point fixed it was useless.
  And he was just replacing it in his pocket when he swung round in his chair
  with a strangled cry. For the blind man had entered noiselessly and had
  touched him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Good God! Emil, I wish you wouldn't do that," he snarled. "I'd no idea
  you were here. My nerves are all to hell."</p>

  <p>"Judging by the aroma," sneered the dwarf, "you have been doing your best
  to raise them from the lower regions."</p>

  <p>"It isn't you who have had the strain," cried Barnet angrily. "So less of
  your damned sarcasm, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>Then he pulled himself together.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Emil," he said, "there's no good in our quarrelling. What are
  we going to do supposing this girl goes to the police? I don't see how she
  can avoid finding out that it isn't her brother."</p>

  <p>"Provided she brings the paper&mdash;what matter? She has no idea her
  brother is dead, and even if the worst should happen here, all Waterlow has
  to do is to say that he made a mistake. It is not a criminal offence to think
  a man is a girl's brother when he isn't."</p>

  <p>"No, but it might prove deuced awkward. Anyway, Emil, if anything should
  come out: if Maitland, for instance, should give trouble, you and I know it
  was Ernesto who did it."</p>

  <p>An evil smile flickered over the blind man's lips.</p>

  <p>"Do we?" he murmured. "My dear Monty, I heard a shot, and you tell me it
  was Ernesto who fired it. And with my sad affliction I have to take your
  word."</p>

  <p>"You little devil," said the other hoarsely, the veins standing out on his
  forehead. "You know as well as I do that it was the dago."</p>

  <p>"As I say, I take your word for it, my dear fellow. In a court of law,
  however, I fear that that would not count for much. No, no,
  Monty&mdash;please remember that. You understand, of course, that I merely
  mention it to ensure you taking every precaution against being found out. Of
  course I am the one person who could not have done it, so it does not really
  matter to me. I am merely being altruistic."</p>

  <p>For a moment it looked as if the baronet was going to strike him. His big
  hairy fist was raised above his head, and murder was in his eyes. Then with a
  great effort he pulled himself together, and his hand fell to his side.</p>

  <p>"You were present, anyway," he said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"True. But a poor blind man is so helpless," said the dwarf gently. "And
  he had to take precautions to safeguard himself in this harsh world. And
  that's why I just mentioned it to you, Monty. You would hardly believe it,
  but there have been times in my life when scoundrels&mdash;men I have
  befriended, men I have been working with&mdash;have tried to double-cross me.
  So just remember won't you? I have no idea who fired the shot, which might
  prove awkward for you."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two the other stared at him, fascinated: then his teeth
  bared in an evil snarl. But his voice was normal when he answered.</p>

  <p>"I'll remember," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good! And now it might be well to see if our friend is <i>compos
  mentis</i> again. His snores were reverberating through the house a little
  while ago."</p>

  <p>"I'll go and get him," said Barnet, and the dwarf was left alone. For a
  while he stood motionless: then feeling his way with an uncanny delicacy of
  touch he proceeded to explore his unfamiliar surroundings. At length he
  seemed satisfied, and drawing up a chair, he sat down as the door opened and
  Barnet came in with an odd-looking character behind him. He was a short,
  thick-set man dressed in a blue reefer suit, and as he stood there fingering
  his cap, and staring a little fearfully at the dwarf, it required no Sherlock
  Holmes to deduce his profession. He was a sailor, and quite clearly he had
  been celebrating his time ashore in a manner not unusual with his class. He
  rolled slightly as he took a few steps forward into the room, and as he came
  under the light a large jagged scar down one side of his face showed up
  vividly.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Robinson," said the dwarf gently. "I trust you have
  recovered from your&mdash;er&mdash;jag."</p>

  <p>"I'm all right, guv'nor, thank you," said the man still twisting his cap
  nervously in his hand. "I understand as 'ow you wants to ask me summat."</p>

  <p>"That is so," agreed Dresler. "I was making some enquiries the other day
  for a seaman with an intimate knowledge of the east coast of South America,
  and your name was given to me."</p>

  <p>"I reckons I knows every port from Georgetown to the Horn," said the
  sailor.</p>

  <p>"Excellent. I understood that most of your time had been spent in the
  coasting trade. Now have you, in the course of your wanderings, ever struck a
  place called by the English, Lone Tree Island?"</p>

  <p>"Lone Tree Island! South of Santos. You bet your life I know it, guv'nor;
  know it well enough to give it a mighty wide berth."</p>

  <p>"Most interesting. And may I ask why you would give it a wide berth?"</p>

  <p>"Because, guv'nor, the man who doesn't don't have no second chance. There
  be things on that island wot no man may see&mdash;and live. It be
  accursed."</p>

  <p>"Really: really. You grow more and more interesting, Mr. Robinson. And may
  I ask how you know this? Is it merely what you've heard from other people, or
  have you been there yourself to see?"</p>

  <p>"Both, guv'nor. I've been there myself: we lay up once for well-nigh a
  week to the south of the island with a damaged shaft. And I've 'eard from
  other men too: things wot they've seen. Gawd! I wouldn't spend the night on
  that island not for a 'undred quid. Straight&mdash;I wouldn't."</p>

  <p>"What sort of things, Mr. Robinson?"</p>

  <p>"Monstrous things, guv'nor: 'orrors. Things that was never made of 'uman
  parents. Aye! you may laugh, sir"&mdash;he turned to Barnet, who was smiling
  incredulously&mdash;"but wot I tells you is the truth. You ask any sailor who
  knows the coast and 'e'll tell you the same as wot I do."</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure that what Mr. Robinson says is correct," said the dwarf.
  "And we're both very much obliged to him for his information."</p>

  <p>"No trouble, gentlemen. Is there anything else I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind waiting a little longer, Mr. Robinson, I hope to be
  able to show you a map of it. And I should very much like your confirmation
  that it is the island we've been talking about. Monty, my dear fellow, our
  friend is probably a little thirsty after all his talking. I have no doubt
  there is some whiskey in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"Well," he continued, as the baronet returned a few moments later, "the
  matter becomes increasingly intriguing. 'Things that were never made of 'uman
  parents: 'orrors.'"</p>

  <p>"Do you believe the man, Emil?"</p>

  <p>The dwarf shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Those who go down to the sea in ships are proverbially spinners of tall
  yarns," he said. "There may be some substratum of truth in it, which has been
  exaggerated into what we've just been told. And, anyway, I have yet to find
  the being, whether made by human parents or not, who is proof against a
  high-velocity rifle."</p>

  <p>Sir Montague Barnet started to pace to and fro.</p>

  <p>"I wish we knew for certain if it was worth going on with it," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The dwarf smiled contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Life would be a pretty tedious affair," he remarked, "if one always knew
  for certain. You know the enquiries we've made: you know our sources of
  information. And even if it should prove to be wrong&mdash;what is the cost?
  A few hundred pounds&mdash;a thousand at the most. Which sum, Monty, I am
  finding, do not forget."</p>

  <p>The door was flung open and Waterlow put his head in.</p>

  <p>"Car coming up the drive," he said. "Everything is ready."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Waterlow," said Dresler quietly. "If it is humanly possible, we
  do not want the girl to suspect anything. It will save us an infinity of
  trouble if she doesn't. And so, as soon as she has handed it over, get it
  down to this room somehow. A minute will be enough for Monty to take a
  tracing. Then if she wants it&mdash;she can have it back."</p>

  <p>"I get you," answered the other going into the hall and closing the
  door.</p>

  <p>The car had pulled up at the door, and contrary to the usual custom the
  driver seemed to be trying to find out how much noise he could make with his
  engine. He accelerated in bursts, until Barnet swore angrily under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"He'll wake the whole damned neighbourhood&mdash;that fool of a
  chauffeur," he muttered.</p>

  <p>But the chauffeur seemed quite oblivious of his unpopularity: at intervals
  he raced his engine with an ear-splitting roar&mdash;so ear-splitting in
  fact, that even the blind man's supersensitive hearing was of no avail for
  any other sound, such as a man might make as he cautiously opened the window
  a little more and a little more each time. And with the final, full-throttled
  burst Jim Maitland, who had been reconnoitring the house for the last twenty
  minutes, found himself with only a blind barring his way to the room. Then
  silence fell, broken only by Waterlow's voice.</p>

  <p>"Really, Miss Draycott, your chauffeur might remember that this is a
  nursing home."</p>

  <p>"So sorry, Doctor Phillips," came her apologetic reply, "but the car is
  not going very well. That's why I'm so late. How is Arthur?"</p>

  <p>A look of relief spread over Barnet's face: evidently she suspected
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"Better now, Miss Draycott. He was very worried and upset this morning
  after you left but I succeeded in pacifying him. I trust there is no mistake
  this time, and that you have brought it with you."</p>

  <p>"Of course, Doctor, and I shall never forgive myself for being so stupid
  this morning."</p>

  <p>Their voices died away as they mounted the stairs, and the dwarf smiled
  easily.</p>

  <p>"It marches well, Monty," he said. "She would appear to be eating out of
  our hands. Now get that sailor in."</p>

  <p>The blind stirred slightly as the door opened&mdash;a natural phenomenon
  in the faint night breeze&mdash;and Jim Maitland's keen eye took in every
  detail of the room. From above him came the sound of the girl's voice:
  evidently the interview with the supposed brother had commenced.</p>

  <p>He drew back a little as Barnet returned, accompanied by Robinson, though
  he could still see the whole of the room.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Robinson," said the blind man, "we shan't detain you much
  longer. May I take it that you would recognise a map of the island if you saw
  one?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I ain't much of a hand at maps, gentlemen, but I'll 'ave a shot at
  it."</p>

  <p>"No one can do more," said Dresler genially as the door opened and
  Waterlow came in.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," he said hurriedly. "And get a move on. She knows all about
  everything, and wants to see the other half."</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"

         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Does she suspect about her brother?" asked the dwarf.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't seem to. She's chatting away quite cheerfully."</p>

  <p>"Right. Go back. And the sooner you get her away the better. Now, Mr.
  Robinson," he continued, as the door closed, "perhaps you would have a
  look."</p>

  <p>"We've got it, Emil," said Barnet triumphantly. "The two pieces fit
  perfectly. Now is that the island?"</p>

  <p>He laid them on the table, and the sailor bent over them.</p>

  <p>"Aye," he said, "that looks like the place. Ancorage: that's right. That's
  where we lay: south of the island. And all the eastern part is swampy.
  Crocks&mdash;why, that river is full of them, and other things too."</p>

  <p>"Good!" cried Barnet, rapidly adjusting a piece of tracing paper.
  "Emil&mdash;we've got the map complete except for that torn-off bit in the
  bottom left-hand corner."</p>

  <p>"Does it give the location of what we want?" asked the dwarf.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the other laconically. "I'll work that out later."</p>

  <p>For a moment Jim hesitated. To knock out Barnet and snatch the map would
  be easy&mdash;a matter of seconds. But he would certainly be recognised,
  and&mdash;what was even more important&mdash;Judy Draycott was not yet safely
  away. He craned forward trying to see, but the baronet's back was between him
  and the map. And he was on the point of chancing it when once more Waterlow
  came in.</p>

  <p>"She's getting suspicious," he said hurriedly. "Wants to see the other
  bit. Is it safe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered the dwarf quietly. "It's the lesser of two evils. Well,
  Mr. Robinson, I don't think we need detain you any more. Good night, and I'm
  much obliged to you. Waterlow&mdash;show him out. Now, Monty," he went on as
  the door closed, "have you got that tracing finished?"</p>

  <p>"Just finished now," said the other.</p>

  <p>"And you have a copy of our half? Good. Put the tracing in your pocket,
  and we'll have the girl in. You're another doctor, don't forget. And don't
  get near her: you reek of whiskey even at this range."</p>

  <p>There was the sound of voices coming down the stairs, then Judy came in
  followed by Waterlow.</p>

  <p>"Here is Miss Draycott, Professor," he announced.</p>

  <p>"It is a pleasure to meet you, Miss Draycott," said the dwarf courteously.
  "May I introduce my other colleague, Doctor Arbuthnot."</p>

  <p>Barnet bowed.</p>

  <p>"Your brother is, I think, as well as can be expected under the
  circumstances," went on Dresler. "It is indeed fortunate that the accident
  should have taken place so close to my nursing home."</p>

  <p>"Very fortunate indeed," said the girl, quietly. "And I am most grateful
  to you for all your kindness."</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady"&mdash;the dwarf lifted a deprecating hand&mdash;"that
  is what we are here for. And now that you have brought him the other half of
  his map, his mind will be at rest."</p>

  <p>"Is that it on the table?" she asked innocently. "What is it all
  about?"</p>

  <p>She crossed over and looked at it.</p>

  <p>"It all seems nonsense to me."</p>

  <p>"I fear you're quite right," said the dwarf. "It <i>is</i> nonsense. But
  so long as he is in his present state he must be humoured."</p>

  <p>"He keeps on talking about hidden treasure," she went on. "Where is this
  supposed to be?"</p>

  <p>"I've got no idea," said the dwarf. "He tells me he got it from some
  sailor in South America. And I fear if the truth be known that it is like so
  many sailor's stories&mdash;complete imagination."</p>

  <p>"You don't think this is a real island?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Frankly, Miss Draycott, I do not. And even if it is I'm afraid the
  chances of there being any treasure on it are remote. Other people would have
  heard of it long ago, and removed it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," she said a little sadly. "And the poor boy does seem so
  keen about it too. However, I have promised him to do all I can, so I suppose
  I must. But it seems rather a waste of time."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing, Miss Draycott?" cried Barnet, and Jim began to shake
  with silent laughter. For the girl was calmly folding up both parts of the
  map and putting them in her bag.</p>

  <p>"He's just asked me to find out anything I could for him about it in
  London," she explained, and Jim shook still more. "When you were out of the
  room, Doctor Phillips. He seemed so keen that I don't like to disappoint him.
  So I'll just pretend."</p>

  <p>Barnet and Waterlow were staring at her in perplexity: their dilemma was
  clear to the delighted witness outside the window. They both knew that the
  girl was lying. But they couldn't say so, without giving themselves away. And
  it was the dwarf who took charge of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Miss Draycott," he said calmly. "Do anything that will keep
  his mind at rest. Humour him in every way. And when shall we be seeing you
  again?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, I think, or perhaps the next day," she answered, rising to her
  feet. "Good night, Professor. Thank you again for all you've done for
  Arthur."</p>

  <p>"It is a pleasure, my dear young lady. Good night."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned," said Barnet, as the door closed. "Why did you let her
  get away with it, Emil?"</p>

  <p>"At times, my friend, I despair of your brain. What else was there to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"But don't you see," fumed the other, "that it is proof positive that she
  suspects. Johnston never said that to her: she was lying."</p>

  <p>From outside came the noise of a self-starter&mdash;a splutter, a
  roar&mdash;and as the car swung down the drive Waterlow re-entered.</p>

  <p>"The fact had not escaped me," said the dwarf languidly. "Though there is
  a bare possibility that she herself suggested it to Johnston, and he perforce
  had to agree."</p>

  <p>"That is soon settled," cried Waterlow going into the hall.
  "Johnston&mdash;come down here."</p>

  <p>A man of about thirty entered mopping his face.</p>

  <p>"Those cursed bandages are the limit on a hot night," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Did that girl make any remark to you about taking the map up to London
  with her?" said the dwarf.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Seemed dead set on it. I didn't know what to say so I left it
  vague."</p>

  <p>"Do you think she suspected you?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't seem to. She called me Arthur and patted my hands."</p>

  <p>"You see, Monty," said the dwarf quietly, "it was far better to let her
  take them. What harm can she do? What is the good of that map to anyone
  unless they know where the island is? And what chance has she got of finding
  anyone who would be able to tell her? Unless..."</p>

  <p>He broke off, and sat brooding.</p>

  <p>"Unless what?"</p>

  <p>"For the moment I thought of Maitland," remarked the dwarf.</p>

  <p>"I wish we'd done the damned fellow in that night," said Barnet savagely.
  "He knows every inch of South America."</p>

  <p>"Hardly that, my dear Monty, though I admit I should feel happier if he
  was out of the way. And you must remember two things. One&mdash;we don't know
  that he knows the girl: and two&mdash;even if he does, it is very improbable
  that he knows where the island is. Still, I admit Maitland is a distinct
  problem, and one that we may have to solve. However, that can wait. The
  immediate thing is to clear out of here at once. Order my car round,
  Johnston, and shut this place up. I fear if the lady comes here again she
  will have a slight shock."</p>

  <p>Noiselessly Jim backed away from the window, and keeping on the grass he
  went down the drive at a steady lope. There was nothing further to be
  learned, and things had succeeded beyond his wildest expectations, entirely
  owing to the girl. He had complete faith in his ability to spot where the
  island was: there were many old pals of his down in Dockland who knew the
  coast of South America as they did the palms of their hands.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly out of the darkness there loomed an immediate solution
  to the problem&mdash;to wit, Mr. Robinson stumping along the road. He could
  give him the information he needed, but speed was imperative since at any
  moment the dwarf's car might be on them. Percy was waiting for him a little
  way ahead, but he wanted no chance of being overtaken.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Robinson," he said as he came abreast.</p>

  <p>"'Oo the 'ell are you?" was the uncompromising answer.</p>

  <p>"Someone who is proposing to give you a fiver if you'll run," said Jim
  with a laugh.</p>

  <p>A stationary red light had just come in sight in front of them.</p>

  <p>"Run as far as that light with me, Robinson, and I'll give you a lift to
  London as well, in exchange for a little information," continued Jim.</p>

  <p>"Gaw lumme! Fivers seem easy to-night."</p>

  <p>He pounded along beside Jim, until they reached the car.</p>

  <p>"My friend, Mr. Robinson," cried Jim, "who is coming back to Town with us.
  Hop in in front, my lad, and Percy, tread on the juice."</p>

  <p>He sank down beside the girl in the back seat, and as the car gathered
  speed he could just see the exquisite profile so close to him.</p>

  <p>"Well done," he said quietly. "Well done, indeed."</p>

  <p>She made no reply; and merely stared in front of her.</p>

  <p>"Miss Draycott! Judy! what's the matter?" he asked gently. "A penny."</p>

  <p>She gave a little sigh that was half a sob.</p>

  <p>"It's Arthur," she said. "I've had time to think; that's all."</p>

  <p>And now the tears were coming unchecked.</p>

  <p>"Killed by those brutes the very day he returned. It's wicked. I want them
  to be punished; I want someone hanged."</p>

  <p>A sudden feeling of guilt assailed him: he had actually forgotten all
  about her brother.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Judy," he said gravely, "while I say my little bit. I know
  exactly how you're feeling: it's only natural. And perhaps I was wrong in not
  calling in the police at once. But I happen to be one of those blokes that
  don't instinctively go for the police if anything happens: I suppose I've
  lived too much in places where there aren't any to go for. And it was the
  extraordinary coincidence of the whole thing that struck me, coming as it did
  just after I'd left you. The dago, your story about the treasure, everything
  combined to make me hesitate. And then, as you know, I was outed and it was
  too late. But what I'm getting at is that now I am glad I acted as I did.
  Honestly I believe that there is something in this yarn, and the best way of
  revenging your brother's death is to do those swine down."</p>

  <p>The girl did not answer, and gradually her tears ceased. And then somehow
  it came about that her left hand fell off her lap and encountered Jim's
  right. Which, of course, was purely accidental, and may be treated as an
  irrelevant and extraneous detail. Almost as irrelevant in fact as three
  remarks which were made five minutes later.</p>

  <p>"Percy, you blighter, this isn't Brooklands. Ease up, confound you."</p>

  <p>And the voice was male.</p>

  <p>"Ever so much slower, Percy dear. I'm being blown to bits."</p>

  <p>And the voice was female.</p>

  <p>"Thank Gawd for that, guv'nor."</p>

  <p>And the voice was that of a man in whom some faint hope of life had been
  rekindled. Mr. Robinson's idea of speed did not coincide with Percy's.</p>

  <p>It was past eleven when they drew up finally outside Jim's flat.</p>

  <p>"But why the dickens did you want me to go slower, after telling me to
  tread on the juice?" demanded Percy indignantly.</p>

  <p>"One is so much more exposed to things in the back seat, Percy dear," said
  the girl. "But you drove very nicely."</p>

  <p>"Why, we've taken as long to get up as we did going down counting in the
  twenty minutes we waited while Jim went ahead. Rotten."</p>

  <p>"Push inside, and don't talk so much," remarked Jim. "As an ornament to
  the doorstep I'd prefer a gargoyle. I expect you could do with a drink,
  Robinson."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I don't mind if I do," agreed the sailor. "Them machines seem
  to make one thirsty like."</p>

  <p>Jim smiled, and led the way. And as a hardened bachelor he noted with a
  certain misgiving that installing Judy in his best chair was a very pleasant
  occupation. Not, of course, that there would ever be anything in it: he had
  merely held her hand in a comforting, fraternal way. Still&mdash;a very
  pretty girl: very pretty indeed.</p>

  <p>"Now, Robinson," he said when they were all settled, "I'd be glad if you'd
  tell me one or two things. First of all how did you get mixed up in that
  bunch?"</p>

  <p>"That's easy, sir. I was lodging down in Mother Shipwells&mdash;she takes
  in us seafaring men chiefly&mdash;when a bloke shoves 'is 'ead round the door
  at dinner-time to-day and sings out: ''Oo knows South America well?' I says I
  do. 'E h'asks me a few questions, and then says: 'Would you like to earn a
  fiver?' I says: 'Stop kidding.' 'E says: 'It's strite.' All I 'ad to do was
  to go and see some guys in the country that wanted h'information. That's how
  it 'appened, sir."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Jim, "that's clear. Now, from what I heard this evening, you
  were talking about some island."</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir. The first thing that little terror of a dwarf asked me
  was if I knew Lone Tree Island."</p>

  <p>"That was before I got there," said Jim. "And you did know this
  island?"</p>

  <p>"There h'ain't many men, sir, 'oove been in the coastal trade there 'oo
  don't," answered the sailor. "I knows it all right, as I told them guys down
  there. Knows it so well, as I says to 'em, that I wouldn't spend a night on
  it for a 'undred quid."</p>

  <p>"But why the deuce not?" cried Percy, staring at him. "I mean, I'd spend a
  night in a temperance hotel for that."</p>

  <p>"Look 'ere, sir," said the sailor to Jim. "A lot of you
  gentlemen&mdash;and you too, Miss&mdash;seems h'interested in Lone Tree
  Island. Now I'm only an h'uneducated man, and maybe you don't pay much count
  to what I says. But there's a man just 'ome from the West H'Indies 'olding a
  master's ticket 'oo knows more'n I do about the place. 'E's lodging not far
  from Mother Shipwells&mdash;Cap'n Blackett...."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," cried Jim. "Big man with a hook nose, and blue eyes, who
  used to have an old tramp called the <i>Indus</i>?"</p>

  <p>"That's the man, sir. Do you know 'im?"</p>

  <p>"Know Bill Blackett? I should think I do!"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, he'll tell you h'everything, better'n than I can."</p>

  <p>Jim put his hand in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Here's some money, Robinson. Get in a taxi, and go and see Captain
  Blackett. Tell him Jim Maitland wants him, and bring him back with you
  to-night. And if his memory wants jogging, just say&mdash;'The Union Bar,
  Pernambuco!'"</p>

  <p>"Aye, aye, sir. If 'e's there, I'll bring 'im. Evening, mum: evening,
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>They heard the front door slam, and Jim, his eyes gleaming with
  excitement, began pacing up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"Bill Blackett! A damned good man. We'll get the truth from him, my
  children, if we can get it from anyone."</p>

  <p>And suddenly Judy Draycott understood the reason of Percy's hero worship.
  Just as a hunter quivers and fidgets at the sound of hounds, so was this man
  at the thought of adventure. And a little ruefully she realised that in all
  probability he had completely forgotten that he held her hand in the car.</p>

  <p>"A pity that I sent the other half to my lawyers," he went on. "Still, it
  was safer, I suppose. And we can get to the maps later, after we've heard
  what Bill has to say."</p>

  <p>He came with Robinson an hour later.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! Mr. Maitland," he said as he shook hands, "you are the only man
  in London who could have got me out of bed at this hour."</p>

  <p>"Good for you, Bill," cried Jim, and introduced him to the other two.
  "Take that chair, and you'll find the necessary beside you. I want some
  information out of you."</p>

  <p>"So I gather from Robinson," said the other gravely. "I hear you've been
  making enquiries about Lone Tree Island."</p>

  <p>"That seems to be the name of the spot," agreed Jim.</p>

  <p>"Have you got the map of it?"</p>

  <p>"Only half: the other is at my lawyers. There it is."</p>

  <p>Bill Blackett stared at it for some time.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that looks to me like a rough sketch of the southern part of
  the island. And if it is, Mr. Maitland, or if you&mdash;and I know what you
  are&mdash;have any idea of paying it a visit, my advice to you is to tear
  that up into tiny pieces and forget it."</p>

  <p>"But why, Captain Blackett?" cried the girl breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Because, Miss, there are certain things in this world which it is best to
  leave alone. Mr. Maitland is a match for anything on two legs, as I very well
  know, but neither he nor any other man is a match for what ever it is that
  lives on that island. It's accursed: the island is accursed."</p>

  <p>"Bill&mdash;you're pulling our legs," said Jim banteringly.</p>

  <p>But there was no answering smile on the other's face.</p>

  <p>"Was the case of the <i>Paquinetta</i> before your time?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to recall it," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Then if it won't bore you, I'll tell you the story."</p>

  <p>"Fire ahead, Bill," cried Jim. "The night is yet young."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">"LONE TREE ISLAND," began Blackett, "lies south of Santos.
  In size it is about five miles north to south, and a little less from east to
  west. The eastern side has a biggish area of swamp which is practically
  impassable: the western side is mostly dense tropical forest. The northern
  part&mdash;the map of which isn't here&mdash;has one conspicuous conical
  hill, and west of that hill one even more conspicuous tree standing by itself
  on high ground."</p>

  <p>"That confirms the accuracy of the other part of the map," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"The first time I heard of it," went on the other, "was in '06. I was
  serving then as mate in a small line with its headquarters at Buenos. One day
  we got sudden orders from the owners to go there, which struck me as being
  pretty strange, seeing that there was no question of any cargo, and tramps
  don't generally go on pleasure cruises. And what struck me as even stranger
  was our old man's manner after we'd sailed. He wasn't a chatty card at the
  best of times, but that trip I couldn't get a word out of him. What was more,
  there was something wrong with the men. So at last I took the bull by the
  horns one morning when he came up on the bridge.</p>

  <p>"'What's all the trouble, sir?' I said. 'The crew are as windy as if they
  were a girls' school.'</p>

  <p>"'How long have you been out here, Mr. Blackett?' he answered.</p>

  <p>"'About a year,' I told him.</p>

  <p>"'You may remember the <i>Paquinetta</i> left Buenos six weeks ago sudden
  like,' he said.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Paquinetta</i> was another of our line.</p>

  <p>"'I do,' I answered. 'Rather mysterious about it too. Nobody knew where
  she was bound for.'</p>

  <p>"'Not only that,' he reminded me, 'but she sailed under a new captain and
  a specially picked crew.'</p>

  <p>"I stared at him hard. He was right&mdash;she had, but I'd forgotten
  it.</p>

  <p>"'In your year out here, Mr. Blackett, have you never heard any stories of
  Lone Tree Island,' he went on.</p>

  <p>"Well, I hadn't&mdash;not at that time, and I told him so. I hadn't even
  heard of the island before.</p>

  <p>"'Not surprising,' he said, 'it lies well off the beaten track.'</p>

  <p>"'What are we going to do there?' I asked him.</p>

  <p>"'Find out what's happened to the <i>Paquinetta</i>,' he said gravely, and
  went below.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Maitland, you know I'm not a nervy sort of cuss, but I give you
  my word that that simple remark sent a shiver right down my spine. Don't
  forget that in those days wireless wasn't fitted to most of the smaller
  tramps, and the <i>Paquinetta</i> had none. At the same time there had been
  no dirty weather and she was a first-class sea boat. So I told myself not to
  be a fool&mdash;what could have happened to her? But there was the old man
  with a face a yard long: there was the crew, who somehow or other had got
  hold of our destination, as nervous as a basketful of monkeys, and there was
  this mystery about the <i>Paquinetta</i>.</p>

  <p>"Well, we sighted the island about noon on the third day out. We were
  steering north-east, and that high ground with the cairn of stones on top,
  that you can see marked on the map, hid the anchorage until we were close in
  shore. Then as we rounded the point we suddenly saw her right in front of us,
  anchored not three cables' length away. So we went hard astern and anchored
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>He paused and took another drink.</p>

  <p>"It was obvious," he continued, "at the first glance that something was
  very wrong. There was no sign of smoke, no sign of life on board her, and
  when we gave a blast on the siren there was no answer.</p>

  <p>"'Lower away a boat,' ordered the skipper. 'I'm going on board.'</p>

  <p>"'I'd like to come too, sir,' I said, and the old man looked relieved.</p>

  <p>"'I reckon I'll be glad to have you,' he answered. 'There is some devilry
  afoot.'</p>

  <p>"So we rowed over. The companion was down though two of the guys had come
  adrift, and it wobbled drunkenly as we climbed up. The deck was deserted, and
  the heat beat up from it as we stood there looking round. Not a sign of a
  soul: not a sound.</p>

  <p>"'We'll go below, Mr. Mate,' said the old man and led the way.</p>

  <p>"She was practically the twin of our own packet so we knew our way about.
  We made for the saloon. It was empty, same as everything else, and on the
  table were the remains of a meal. Half a cup of tea congealed and rancid, and
  some meat that was crawling, it was so bad.</p>

  <p>"'They've been gone some time, sir,' I said, pointing to it.</p>

  <p>"'But what manner of man is it, Mr. Mate, who leaves his ship without a
  soul on board. Tell me that.'</p>

  <p>"And I couldn't. The old story of the <i>Marie Celeste</i> came to my
  mind, but she at any rate was found drifting at sea. This was different: the
  whole lot of them must be ashore. But as the skipper said it pointed to a
  strange man in their captain.</p>

  <p>"'We'll try the chart-room,' said the old man, and even as he spoke there
  came a sudden chuckle from outside the door. And you can take it from me that
  we were round in a flash, each of us with a gun in our hands. It was
  repeated, and there was something in the sound of it that fairly froze my
  blood. We watched the door opening slowly, and then our revolvers fell to our
  sides. One of the cook's mates was standing there and it needed but one
  glance to see that the poor chap was as mad as a hatter.</p>

  <p>"He looked at us foolishly, and after a while he began to mumble
  something.</p>

  <p>"'Half men: half beasts. Half men: half beasts.'</p>

  <p>"On and on he went saying it, again and again and pointing with a shaking
  hand through the porthole. We couldn't get anything else out of him, and at
  length he shambled away again.</p>

  <p>"'What the devil does he mean, sir?' I cried. 'Half men: half beasts. Of
  course, he's plumb crazy.'</p>

  <p>"'And what made him crazy, Mr. Mate: what made him crazy?'</p>

  <p>"The captain looked at me with sombre eyes.</p>

  <p>"'Crazy men aren't signed on, are they, Mr. Mate? And sane men don't go
  crazy for nothing.'</p>

  <p>"He led the way on deck, and for a while he stood there shading his eyes
  with his hand and staring at the undergrowth that came down almost to the
  water's edge. Then he turned abruptly and went up on the bridge.</p>

  <p>"'Get the log,' he said. 'It may tell us something.'</p>

  <p>"So I went to the captain's cabin, and wished I hadn't. For the sight
  inside was terrible to see. The bunk, the walls, the table, the chairs, the
  floor&mdash;every part of that cabin had great patches of red spattered over
  it, as if someone with a vast brush had daubed it indiscriminately on
  anything he saw. And it was blood.</p>

  <p>"I turned: the captain was standing beside me and his face was the colour
  of chalk.</p>

  <p>"'God in Heaven!' he muttered, 'there's been butcher's work in here.'</p>

  <p>"I went over to the table, on which some papers were lying and picked them
  up. They, too, were stained with blood, but the writing was still legible.
  And at last we realised we had some sort of clue, though not one that
  advanced us much. For the top was evidently part of a rough form of diary
  kept by the skipper, and the captain pointed to the date&mdash;April
  26th.</p>

  <p>"'18th May now, Blackett,' he said. 'Three weeks ago.'</p>

  <p>"'Cannot understand silence of shore party,' ran the entry. 'Three days
  overdue and no sig&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"It broke off abruptly in the middle of a word. Signal, perhaps or
  sign&mdash;it didn't matter. But the same thought was in both our minds: what
  grim tragedy had occurred as he laid down his pencil three weeks before?
  Whose was the blood that covered everything? The faint sickly reek of it
  still hung about, and we stumbled back into the fresh air&mdash;two badly
  shaken men.</p>

  <p>"'What's it mean, sir?' I cried. 'You knew something before we got here:
  the crew knew something. What is it?'</p>

  <p>"'Rumours,' he said slowly. 'There have always been strange rumours about
  this island, Mr. Mate. And, by heck! I'm beginning to believe that they're
  true.'</p>

  <p>"He gripped my arm suddenly, and with his other hand he pointed to the
  shore.</p>

  <p>"'Do you see anything moving?' he cried. 'By that tree with the purple
  flowers, half-way up the hill.'</p>

  <p>"I picked out the tree, and stared at it. And after a while it shook,
  though everything around it was motionless in the stilling mid-day heat. I
  went on staring: was it my imagination or was there something at the foot of
  the tree that was moving? We had neither of us brought our glasses, and in
  the shimmering haze it was difficult to be certain. So at length we gave it
  up and continued our exploration though we knew from the outset it was
  hopeless. The ship was empty save for us two and a crazy cook. Where were the
  rest of the crew?"</p>

  <p>He paused, and Jim refilled his glass. And in the silence of the room you
  could have heard a pin drop.</p>

  <p>"The first thing to fix was what to do with the madman, and the skipper
  decided to leave him where he was for the time.</p>

  <p>"'As I see things,' he said to me, 'he has been alone in this boat since
  April 26th, and it's not going to hurt him to be alone two or three days
  more. And we'll have trouble with our own men if we take him back with
  us.'</p>

  <p>"'What do you propose to do, sir?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'Explore that river, Mr. Blackett. We've got to try and solve this
  mystery somehow.'</p>

  <p>"So we pulled back to our own ship, and I gave the necessary orders. The
  men were standing about in bunches talking in low voices, and it wasn't until
  the old man got going that they bestirred themselves. Of course they'd
  scented trouble&mdash;anyone with half an eye could have seen it after one
  glance at the <i>Paquinetta</i>&mdash;but they were not given much time to
  think about it. We hoisted in the small boat, lowered away the big one, and a
  marline spike removed any reluctance to man it. The second mate was left in
  charge, with strict orders to keep a sharp look out, and we started off.</p>

  <p>"It had been hot in the creek, but once round the bend of the river out of
  sight of the open sea it became almost unbearable. Not a breath of wind
  stirred, and the air seemed to press down on one like a wet blanket. Dense
  tropical undergrowth hemmed us in on each side: the place reeked of malaria
  and yellow jack. And crocodiles. I've never seen so many in my life as there
  were in that river, and the grim thought came to me that they might furnish a
  possible solution. There would be no traces left of anyone who fell into that
  water. I said as much in a low voice to the skipper, and he stared at me a
  moment or two before replying.</p>

  <p>"'It's a rum crocodile that can climb the bridge of a ship, Blackett,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>"We rowed on. He and I were sitting side by side in the stern each with a
  revolver on our knees. Gradually the river narrowed till the blades of the
  oars were almost touching the banks and the trees met overhead. It was
  obvious we could not go further, so the skipper gave the order to cease
  rowing.</p>

  <p>"'No good trying to land here,' he remarked. 'We'll try a shout or two.
  Now then, lads, all together with me.'</p>

  <p>"We bellowed 'Ahoy' at the tops of our voices, and then listened. But save
  for the startled whirr of birds as they rose from the tree near by there was
  no result&mdash;just the same steamy silent heat. We tried again, but it was
  useless and there was nothing for it but to return to the ship. And it was on
  the way back that I became conscious of a very peculiar sensation. I
  mentioned it to the captain afterwards, and found that he had experienced it
  also, though I think the men were too busy rowing to notice it. And the
  sensation was one of being watched. Something was keeping pace with us on one
  bank, something that I never saw, but yet was acutely aware of. It was not
  imagination, and the skipper agreed with me.</p>

  <p>"Well, that ended our first endeavour to solve the mystery, and the point
  arose as to what to do next. So we held a council of war, and finally arrived
  at the conclusion that the best thing would be to steam slowly round the
  island hooting with the siren at frequent intervals, and looking for a place
  where we could land a party with safety. For the skipper flatly refused to
  let anyone go ashore in the wooded part, even if we could have got the men to
  volunteer, which I doubt.</p>

  <p>"So we made the circuit of the island with the siren going every
  half-minute, and the result was <i>nil</i>. No trace of a man did we see, but
  the time was not wasted since we got the geography of the place in our heads.
  And it was clear that there was one obvious spot to land&mdash;a beach on the
  north of the island almost at the foot of the conical hill. But it was too
  late to do anything more that day, so we decided to anchor again, and wait
  for the next morning.</p>

  <p>"Now the <i>Paquinetta</i> was lying inside us about two hundred yards
  from the shore, and a quarter of a mile from us. The night was dead still,
  and the moon was due to rise about three. And though I was tired when I came
  off watch at midnight I found I couldn't sleep. I couldn't get this amazing
  affair out of my head, so I lay down on my bunk and picked up a book. Full
  sea going, watch was being kept, and I could hear the second mate pacing up
  and down the bridge.</p>

  <p>"Suddenly the footsteps ceased just above my porthole, and I heard him
  give an exclamation. And the next moment he was in my cabin.</p>

  <p>"'There's something going on in the <i>Paquinetta</i>, sir,' he cried.</p>

  <p>"I was out like a flash, and up on the bridge. Sure enough a light was
  moving across the deck, but it wasn't an ordinary ship's lantern. It looked
  more like a smoky torch, such as boys carry on Guy Fawkes's day. We watched
  it in silence, until it disappeared below.</p>

  <p>"'It's that crazy fool of a cook,' I said. 'He'll probably set fire to the
  ship.'</p>

  <p>"And I was on the point of rousing the skipper, when there came across the
  water a scream of terror so blood-curdling that I felt my hair lifting from
  my scalp. It was not repeated, and before I had time to decide anything, the
  captain joined us.</p>

  <p>"'Did that scream come from the <i>Paquinetta</i>?' he asked.</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir,' I said. 'And there was a light moving on the deck... By Jove!
  there it is again.'</p>

  <p>"The three of us stood there staring at it. As before it moved across the
  deck, but this time it disappeared over the side. And it seemed to me that it
  was moving in a curiously jerky fashion.</p>

  <p>"Now the gangway was on the far side of the <i>Paquinetta</i> and the
  explanation of the light's movements seemed obvious. Someone had boarded her,
  gone below, and then left her. And while he was below something had happened
  to cause that ghastly scream.</p>

  <p>"The skipper didn't hesitate, though if it had been me I'm not ashamed to
  confess that I think I'd have left it till dawn. He ordered a boat to be
  lowered and called for a couple of volunteers to go aboard the
  <i>Paquinetta</i>. We got 'em readily&mdash;a big Swede, and an Englishman.
  One of them took a crowbar, and the other a pickaxe, whilst the skipper and I
  carried our revolvers. Then with four lanterns we rowed across. Hit, and hit
  to kill, were the orders if we met anything.</p>

  <p>"We came alongside the gangway, and the first thing we saw by the light of
  the lanterns was blood on the steps. There was a trail of it the whole way
  up, a trail right across the deck, a trail of it leading down below. And we
  followed the trail&mdash;the skipper leading and me bringing up the rear. It
  led past the saloon, and finished in the cook's quarters.</p>

  <p>"Ye Gods! the place was a shambles. Just as we had found the captain's
  cabin, so was this, only now the blood was wet. And the skipper cursed
  savagely. Somebody or something had battered that poor crazy loon to death,
  but whatever it was it had disappeared. We searched the ship thoroughly: she
  was empty. And at last we pulled back to our own.</p>

  <p>"And that very nearly brings me to the end. The next day we landed a party
  and climbed the hill. From it the whole of the island could be seen stretched
  out like a map at our feet. But of life there was no sign. Dense forest and
  swamp, and not a thing that moved, save that occasionally a flock of birds
  would rise from some tree, and then settle down again as if they had been
  disturbed by something passing below.</p>

  <p>"I suggested to the captain that I should take a party of volunteers and
  try some exploration in the forest, but he absolutely refused to allow
  it.</p>

  <p>"'We've only got three revolvers on board,' he pointed out, 'and very
  little ammunition. If the crew of the <i>Paquinetta</i> were anywhere down
  there they'd have heard our siren yesterday. They're dead, Mr.
  Mate&mdash;every man jack of them, and I'm not going to risk a similar fate
  for my own. You'll take command of the <i>Paquinetta</i> with an emergency
  crew, and as soon as you've got steam up&mdash;we sail.'</p>

  <p>"And that is the story of the <i>Paquinetta</i>, from which you can draw
  your own conclusions. Every sort of theory was put forward at the time, and
  the one that most people accepted was that a mutiny had taken place. The
  landing-party which the captain had alluded to in his diary, had come on
  board, and having killed the skipper and the rest of the crew had gone ashore
  again leaving only the mad cook. Then when we arrived, fearful that the
  madman might say something which would give them away, they completed their
  work by butchering him. They dared not reply to our siren knowing what they'd
  done, and finally yellow jack broke out and that was the end. For the bald
  fact remains that from that day to this no word has been heard of any member
  of that crew."</p>

  <p>"And is that your theory, Bill?" asked Jim quietly.</p>

  <p>"No, Mr. Maitland, it isn't. Call me a superstitious sailor-man if you
  like but I believe the solution of the mystery is something far more
  horrible. And I believe it is to be found in the words of that crazy
  cook&mdash;'half men, half beasts.' I believe that lurking in that dense
  forest are beings of a certain degree of intelligence&mdash;witness the
  torch, which shows that they understand fire&mdash;of inner physical
  strength&mdash;the captain of the <i>Paquinetta</i> was a powerful
  man&mdash;and of incredible ferocity. I believe that the landing-party was
  butchered to a man, and that then, taking advantage of a dark night, these
  creatures had either swum or rowed out to the ship, and murdered those who
  remained on board. Why they left the mad cook I don't profess to say: perhaps
  he managed to hide himself from them. In brief, I believe that the legend of
  the Guardians of the Treasure is true."</p>

  <p>"Now we're coming to it, Bill," said Jim. "Let's hear something about this
  treasure."</p>

  <p>"It was to find it, Mr. Maitland, that the <i>Paquinetta</i> was fitted
  out. The story is that in 1600 or thereabouts one Don Silva Rodriguez, having
  on board his galleon a fabulous load of gold and precious stones which he had
  obtained in Brazil, was driven ashore on Lone Tree Island and completely
  wrecked. He waited and waited, spending each day on the top of the hill
  scanning the horizon for a sail, but never seeing one. And at length his rage
  and fury drove him mad. There was he with unlimited riches in his pocket so
  to speak, condemned to spend the rest of his life on an island where they
  were useless to him. And in his madness he entered into league with the
  devil. If the devil would send a ship, he would leave half his treasure
  hidden on the island where no one could find it, for the exclusive use of the
  devil. And the devil agreed, provided he could instal his own guardians. You
  smile, Mr. Maitland&mdash;and told here in this room I admit the story sounds
  fantastic. Nevertheless, even if the origin of the yarn is incredible, I
  still believe that there lurks in that forest a breed of creatures that are
  neither man nor beast."</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir." Robinson, who had been almost forgotten in his
  corner, suddenly spoke. "The Captain's right. 'Orrors: 'orrors that ain't
  'uman."</p>

  <p>"So you've heard this story too, have you?" said Jim thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what causes your interest in the place, Mr. Maitland?" said
  Blackett.</p>

  <p>"You certainly may, Bill. And I can tell you in a few words. We have in
  our possession a map that purports to show the spot on the island where the
  treasure is buried."</p>

  <p>"How came you by it?"</p>

  <p>"It was given to my brother, Captain Blackett, by a sailor he befriended
  in Monte Video," said Judy Draycott. "And my brother has since been murdered
  by a gang here in England who want to get it."</p>

  <p>The sailor whistled in astonishment.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"
     name="pic6"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"That's bad luck, Miss," he said awkwardly. "I'm sorry to hear that."</p>

  <p>"Now, Bill, the position is this," remarked Jim. "By a subterfuge we have
  obtained the genuine map as given by the sailor to Miss Draycott's brother.
  We have also presented the gang with this."</p>

  <p>He joined the faked half on to the genuine one and Blackett studied
  it.</p>

  <p>"That, as you will see, Bill, is wrong. The southern half is correct: the
  northern is not."</p>

  <p>"Aye: that's so. The tree and the hill are reversed."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm jiggered," said Robinson. "To think I never spotted that."</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad you didn't, Robinson," said Jim. "It would have upset my
  plans very considerably if you had. To continue, Bill. The other party have
  no idea that there is anything wrong with the map they've got. It is
  possible, of course, they may show it to someone like yourself who knows the
  place, in which case they will discover they've been tricked. But if they
  don't do that, they won't find their error out till they arrive there."</p>

  <p>"Arrive there!" cried Blackett. "Lord save us, you don't mean to say
  they're going to the island."</p>

  <p>"You bet your life, Bill," said Jim. "And so am I."</p>

  <p>"You are a fool, Mr. Maitland," said the sailor gravely.</p>

  <p>"So are you, Bill," answered Jim, beginning to pace up and down the room.
  "Because you're coming too. And little Percy."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment with his eyes on the girl.</p>

  <p>"Pity&mdash;but I'm afraid it's not quite in your line, Miss Draycott. I
  don't like the sound of that yellow jack."</p>

  <p>"Don't you," said the girl, with a sweetness that would have augured
  danger to him if he had not been so preoccupied.</p>

  <p>"Foul thing&mdash;yellow jack. Still we're all pretty well pickled against
  fever, and as far as Percy is concerned he can bite the microbe first.
  Microbes flee from you, don't they, old lad? Suppose they must draw the line
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>"I had a sort of idea, Mr. Maitland," continued Judy even more sweetly,
  "that the map of the island was mine."</p>

  <p>Jim stared at her.</p>

  <p>"By Jove! yes&mdash;so it is," he cried. "But it's understood, of course,
  that when we discover the old tin can buried by Bill's Spanish pal, it's
  absolutely yours. Bill&mdash;when can you start? Fares and all expenses, of
  course, are mine."</p>

  <p>"Are you really serious?" demanded the other.</p>

  <p>"Serious as be damned, old lad. And the marvel to me is that I've never
  heard this perfectly gorgeous yarn before."</p>

  <p>And it was just as well for his peace of mind that he did not see the look
  on the girl's face as she watched him.</p>

  <p>"If you don't come," he went on, "I'll have to rope in someone else who
  can do the sailoring part. But I'd dearly like to have you with me,
  Bill."</p>

  <p>And suddenly the sailor laughed.</p>

  <p>"Right you are. I'm with you."</p>

  <p>"Great," shouted Jim. "I'll fix details with you to-morrow, Bill, and show
  you the complete map."</p>

  <p>His eyes were gleaming with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Speed: speed&mdash;that's the order of the day," he continued. "We've got
  to get there first. And I see no reason why we shouldn't. They suspect
  nothing, so as far as they are concerned there's no urgent need for
  hurry."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll have a look at things to-morrow," said Blackett, getting up.
  "I think you're a fool, Mr. Maitland, and I know I am, but anyway I'm going
  to bed. Good night, Miss," he added with a grin. "Can't you make him see
  reason?"</p>

  <p>He stumped down the stairs followed by Robinson, and Jim grinned too.</p>

  <p>"A priceless fellow," he remarked. "Worth two in a scrap."</p>

  <p>"Do you think there's anything in his story about the things in the
  forest?" said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Frankly, I don't," answered Jim. "As he admitted himself sailors are a
  superstitious bunch, and their stories rarely lose in the telling. But it was
  a queer yarn, wasn't it, about the <i>Paquinetta</i>? I should say myself
  that the generally accepted theory was correct&mdash;mutiny and yellow jack.
  For all that you'll have to learn to pull a pretty useful trigger,
  Percy."</p>

  <p>But at the moment Percy slept quite shamelessly.</p>

  <p>"How will you go?" demanded the girl.</p>

  <p>"Either Purple Star or Union Mail as far as Rio. I'll have a look at the
  list of sailings to-morrow. Then from Rio I'll charter something or other to
  get to the island in."</p>

  <p>"And where will you stay in Rio?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Probably the <i>Gloria</i>," said Jim. "Judy&mdash;I wish you could see
  Rio. It's one of the most divinely beautiful places in the world."</p>

  <p>"So I've always heard," she remarked. "You must bring me back some picture
  postcards of the place."</p>

  <p>Jim looked at her suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"What are you driving at, Judy?" he said. "The tone of your last remark
  was very peculiar."</p>

  <p>"Sorry about that," she answered. "I was really thinking of something
  else. What a wonderful judge of character Captain Blackett is."</p>

  <p>"Bill! Judge of character! I don't know that I've ever noticed it
  particularly."</p>

  <p>"I mean when he called you a fool. Do give me a match, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Not a match do you get until you tell me what you're driving at."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you must be one. Do you really imagine, Jim Maitland, that I'm
  going to sit at home here while you and that snoring monstrosity go
  gallivanting off on a perfectly priceless trip like this which you'd never
  have heard about but for me. Not so, my lad: you guess again."</p>

  <p>"But, Judy," he said feebly. "My dear&mdash;think of the fever. And the
  discomfort. And there may be something in Blackett's story after all," he
  added as a brilliant afterthought.</p>

  <p>"Cut it out," she said calmly. "Where Percy the poop can go&mdash;I can
  go. It's my map, and as a great favour I'll allow you to come with me. Now
  give me a match."</p>

  <p>He still hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Judy," he said seriously, "I know it is your map. I know you have every
  right to take up the position you have. But&mdash;honestly, I don't think you
  quite realise what you're letting yourself in for. The risk of fever is not
  an imaginary one: that part of the world simply reeks of it. Further there's
  going to be very real danger from the gentlemen we've been up against
  to-night. I don't think you ought to come."</p>

  <p>"I'm still waiting for that match," she reminded him. "Now, look here,
  Jim," she went on when her cigarette was alight, "whatever you say, I'm
  coming. You may remember that conversation we had the first time we met
  concerning the youth of the present day. Well, now that they've killed Arthur
  this is my show. And any risks that you run I'm going to run too. Which
  ultimatum having been delivered the young maiden intimated her intention of
  retiring. Percy&mdash;you horror&mdash;wake up."</p>

  <p>"Did anybody speak to me?" grunted Percy sleepily.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, you fat-headed ass. I want to go home."</p>

  <p>"All right, my loved one. Have you kissed James good night?"</p>

  <p>And then occurred an amazing phenomenon. For Judy Draycott, usually one of
  the most self-possessed of girls, began to blush. Furious with herself, she
  blushed still more. And Percy howled with joy.</p>

  <p>"My invariable present is an order up to five bob on Woolworths," he said
  dodging rapidly to the door. "Five minutes, my children&mdash;and don't
  forget to turn off the light in the passage when you leave."</p>

  <p>"You unspeakable ass&mdash;get out," roared Jim, trying not to laugh.</p>

  <p>"I go, James. But that is not the way mother taught me to address a
  chaperon."</p>

  <p>"I really must apologise for him, Judy," said Jim, as Percy went down the
  stairs. "He becomes more of a half-wit daily."</p>

  <p>He was holding the door open for her as he spoke, and for a while she
  looked at him in silence. Then she suddenly smiled.</p>

  <p>"Are all your family half-wits?" she said softly, and a moment later he
  was alone.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">SPEED, as Jim Maitland had said, was the vital thing. He had
  not the heart to try and dissuade Judy Draycott from coming: nor, as he
  frankly admitted to himself, had he the ability to. But she was going to
  complicate things. With her as a member of the party, it was essential to
  avoid a scrap, if it was humanly possible. And as he saw the thing a scrap
  would inevitably occur as soon as the other people landed on the island, when
  they would immediately discover that their map was wrong. Therefore it
  followed that if gun work was to be avoided they must be away before Dresler
  and his gang got there.</p>

  <p>To Bill Blackett's fanciful monsters he attached no importance whatever.
  He knew sailors and their stories of old: moreover the <i>Paquinetta</i>
  mystery had taken place twenty-four years ago. And in a quarter of a century
  things grow in the imagination. What was worrying him, and what continued to
  worry him all the way across to Rio was how long it was going to take them to
  find the spot where, according to the map, the stuff was buried. It was easy
  to mark the spot on the map itself&mdash;he had already done so and marked it
  B. But the difficulty was going to be to find that place on the ground.
  According to Bill Blackett it was right in the middle of the forest, so how
  were they going to get their compass bearings? Had the place been open
  country the thing would have been easy. All that would have been necessary
  would have been to walk along the line from A to C till a point was reached
  where the hill lay north-east. But in dense forest the matter became much
  more difficult. And his fear was that it might take a considerable time
  before they marked it down, and even then they would have to allow for it
  being only approximately accurate. He felt that a week at least would be
  necessary to decide whether there was anything there or not. Could he rely on
  a week?</p>

  <p>So far as he knew they had slipped out of England unnoticed. But he was
  far too old a campaigner to place any reliance on the fact. There had been
  questions of visas, and visits to consuls for Percy and the girl, and he was
  under no delusions as to the spying capabilities of the other side. He could
  only hope for the best, but he took no account of it in his plans. But of one
  thing he did feel tolerably certain; there was no one actually on board he
  had to worry about. The boat carried nothing but first-class passengers and
  was very empty. And with the help of the doctor and the purser he soon had
  the two or three possibilities satisfactorily accounted for.</p>

  <p>His idea was simple, and had been arrived at after talking it over with
  Bill Blackett. It appeared from what the sailor told him that an eccentric
  Brazilian had had built to his own design a fifty-ton motor-boat. Of amorous
  disposition he had used her in the past to accommodate a series of lady
  friends on week-end trips in the vicinity of Rio. Unfortunately, however, the
  husband of one of them, viewing this innocent pastime with displeasure, had
  shot the proud owner dead as he disembarked on the Monday morning. With the
  result that the boat was sold by the executors to a firm of local
  shipbuilders, who were always prepared to hire her out for any length of
  time. There was ample room on board for their party, and she was quite big
  enough for the trip.</p>

  <p>On one point, however, Blackett was very insistent.</p>

  <p>"Not a word, Mr. Maitland, as to our destination. Apart altogether from
  the fact that we don't want it talked about, you'll never get a man to work
  her if it is known where we're bound for. We'll fuel her right up&mdash;if
  necessary we can get some more at Santos&mdash;and merely say that we're
  going a trip along the coast."</p>

  <p>The first hitch occurred the day they arrived in Rio&mdash;the motor-boat
  was in dry dock being repaired. And when Bill Blackett reported the fact to
  Jim, for a time he thought of cancelling his plan, and trying to get another
  craft. But after having inspected her, and realised how ideally suitable she
  was for the purpose, he adopted the only possible method in South America of
  getting things done quickly. They said it would take a week, so he offered a
  thousand <i>milreis</i> for every day less than seven that the work was
  completed in. It cost him four thousand <i>milreis</i> but he felt it was
  money well spent.</p>

  <p>And during the three days they stayed at the <i>Gloria</i> they did the
  well-known trips to pass the time. Corcavado, with the gigantic
  half-completed Christ on the summit: Sugar Loaf Hill by the aerial rope-way:
  Capacabana with its daily toll of drowned bathers due to the terrific
  undertow. To Judy Draycott the time passed all too quickly, and had it not
  been for his anxiety to lose not a second more than was necessary Jim would
  have felt the same. For the girl, besides possessing an intense love of
  beauty, had in her the genuine explorer's spirit. It was always the case with
  her of wanting to know what was on the other side of the mountain. The great
  blue and green butterflies drifting lazily through the dappled sunshine of
  trees splashed with scarlet and mauve flowers entranced her: what spoilt it
  was that just behind them was a large motor-car on a first-class road.</p>

  <p>"What a marvellous life you've led, Jim," she said. "Think of
  this&mdash;this breathless beauty&mdash;away from towns, away from humans.
  Your own&mdash;not shared by anybody: not spoilt by anybody. And then to go
  on and find it again and again till you come to the end."</p>

  <p>"The end!" He began to quote:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"'Have ever you stood where the silences brood,<br>
  And vast the horizons begin,<br>
  At the dawn of the day to behold far away<br>
  The goal you would strive for and win?'"</p>

  <p>And then, to his delight she took him up:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"'Yet, ah! in the night when you gain to the height,<br>
  With the vast pool of heaven star-spawned,<br>
  Afar and agleam, like a valley of dream<br>
  Still mocks you a Land of Beyond.'"</p>

  <p>"So you like him too, do you?" he said. "I'm glad. He writes the stuff
  that rings true does Robert Service."</p>

  <p>"If you would wish in time for lunch to be, sah, I would suggest ascension
  of automobile."</p>

  <p>The driver's voice, ingratiating, conciliatory, cut in on them, and Jim
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Marching orders, Judy. His goal is a stomach filled with garlic."</p>

  <p>But they were both strangely silent as they drove back.</p>

  <p>It was during the afternoon of the last day that they discovered that
  their hopes of a clear week on the island were not likely to be realised.
  Bill Blackett, who had spent the morning urging on the work on the boat,
  arrived when they were half-way through lunch.</p>

  <p>"We'll get off to-morrow," he announced, "and its just as well we
  should."</p>

  <p>"Anything happened, Bill?" said the other.</p>

  <p>"It may be nothing. Have you ever heard of Bully McIntyre?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say I have," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Well, he's heard of you. And he knows you're here. Bully McIntyre has
  been busy all his life on this coast, and his name is about right. He holds a
  master's ticket, and there is no denying he's a good seaman. But he's a
  swine. He doesn't know me, but I once had him pointed out to me, and he's not
  a man you'll forget in a hurry. Anyway he was down there near the docks this
  morning having a drink with a couple of dagos. And I suddenly heard your name
  mentioned. So I shifted along a bit and listened as well as I could. I
  couldn't hear much, but I distinctly caught the word 'Delay.' It may mean
  nothing, but I thought I'd better mention it."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Bill," said Jim thoughtfully. "When is the next boat in from
  England?"</p>

  <p>"Day after to-morrow," answered the other. "If they come by her, it only
  gives us one day's start."</p>

  <p>"Is this fellow McIntyre the sort of man they might get hold of to run the
  show for them?"</p>

  <p>"Just the sort," said the sailor. "He fears nothing on earth, and he knows
  this coast backwards. I'll make a few enquiries this afternoon, and find out
  if he's chartered anything."</p>

  <p>"Do," said Jim. "And another thing, too. Put the men, who are working on
  the boat, wise to the possibility that she may be tampered with, and let them
  know that whatever the cause may be there's no money unless she's fit to put
  to sea."</p>

  <p>"What are you doing for the rest of the day?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to finish up the grub side. Ordering enough for a
  fortnight."</p>

  <p>"Well, I needn't tell you to keep your eyes skinned," grunted the sailor.
  "But I'll feel easier when we're away."</p>

  <p>"But what could they do?" asked Judy Draycott.</p>

  <p>"This ain't London, Miss," said Blackett. "A powerful lot of funny things
  can happen in these parts. Well, I'll go and find out what I can."</p>

  <p>He stumped out of the dining-room, and Jim frowned thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I always thought Dresler must have someone at this end," he said. "But I
  wonder how they've got on to me. However there's nothing for it but to keep
  one's eyes skinned, as Bill said. No trotting round by yourself, young Percy.
  If they know me, they probably know you. So you stick close to uncle this
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>It was on the way back from the store where they had laid in provisions,
  that the incident occurred which made Jim realise that there were brains in
  the opposition. A crude attempt with a knife would not have surprised him,
  and it was for something of that sort that he was prepared. But the actual
  ruse when it came was so much more artistic that even he was very nearly
  caught.</p>

  <p>Percy was on the outside of the pavement, with Judy in the middle. And
  they were just turning into the main boulevard when a girl brushed past them.
  As she came abreast she seemed to lurch against Percy, and, promptly, with a
  cry of pain, she collapsed into the gutter. He instinctively turned to help
  her, and the next moment he found himself almost flung into a passing taxi by
  Jim.</p>

  <p>"Damn it all, old lad," he expostulated feebly as the car drove off, "the
  wretched filly has hurt herself."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Judy," said Jim as she stared at him in amazement. "They very
  nearly had me that time. Of course, the whole thing was done on purpose. The
  girl wasn't hurt at all."</p>

  <p>"Even so," remarked Percy, "I don't see why I shouldn't have helped the
  little darling out of the gutter. She was rather a peach."</p>

  <p>"Because then she would have pretended to be hurt. She would have sworn
  you banged into her and knocked her down. Within two minutes in this town an
  ambulance would have been on the spot. And if you'd been with her then, you'd
  have been involved in all sorts of complications. Never touch anybody who has
  had an accident here: leave them alone, and wait for an ambulance."</p>

  <p>"You think the whole thing was done on purpose?" cried Judy.</p>

  <p>"I do," said Jim. "Just to cause delay. Percy might have found himself
  tied up in formalities for days."</p>

  <p>They found Blackett waiting for them at the hotel, with a serious look on
  his face.</p>

  <p>"I've found out a good deal," he said gravely. "And we've got to get a
  move on. You remember that white yacht we noticed as we came in, lying at
  anchor not far from the old cruiser? Well&mdash;that's what we're up against.
  She belongs to a millionaire here called Miguel, and Bully is getting her
  ready for sea by the day after to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"That means they are coming by the next mail boat," remarked Jim. "A pity:
  I'd hoped for a bit longer. How's our work going?"</p>

  <p>"Practically finished. Get off early to-morrow if the food is all fixed
  up."</p>

  <p>"That's done. Who is this man Miguel, Bill?"</p>

  <p>"He rolls in money, and nobody seems to know how he made it. Of course,
  the whole thing may be a coincidence, but I don't think so."</p>

  <p>"No more do I," said Jim grimly, staring at a card a page had just handed
  him.</p><br>

  <p class="sign">DON SILVESTRE MIGUEL</p><br>

  <p>"Here is the gentleman himself."</p>

  <p>A swarthy-looking individual, who might have stepped straight off the
  operatic stage had followed hard on the boy's heels. He bowed magnificently
  to Judy: then, turning to Jim, he enquired: "Mr. Maitland?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Maitland," said Jim curtly.</p>

  <p>"It is an honour, Mr. Maitland, to have you again in our country," he
  declared. "May I be permitted to crave an introduction to your friends?"</p>

  <p>Jim complied, even more curtly. Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"May I ask to what I owe the pleasure of this visit, Don Miguel?"</p>

  <p>"A desire for a little private conversation with you, Mr. Maitland. Could
  we, perhaps..."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the others significantly, and Jim turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"I shan't be long, Judy. Do you mind waiting here with Percy? Don't leave
  the hotel. Come this way, Don Miguel."</p>

  <p>He led him to two chairs in the corner of the lounge.</p>

  <p>"It would be waste of time, Mr. Maitland," began the Brazilian, "to
  pretend that I do not know the object of your visit here. And it is on that
  subject that I would like a few words with you."</p>

  <p>"May I ask how you discovered the supposed object of my visit?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly: I propose to put all my cards on the table. Some few months
  ago it came to my knowledge from a source which I considered reliable, that
  there was a more reasonable likelihood of the story of the buried treasure in
  Lone Tree Island being correct. Since you, of course, must know the story I
  need say no more. I was sufficiently interested to make further enquiries,
  and what I learned confirmed my opinion. A map was in existence, which was in
  the possession of a sailor who was rapidly drinking himself to death, and I
  determined to obtain that map. Then an unexpected thing happened, with the
  details of which I will not bore you. But to cut a long story short the
  sailor disappeared. He was in Bahia: then suddenly he vanished.</p>

  <p>"I made enquiries, and after a great deal of trouble I traced him to
  Buenos Aires. There again I lost the trail for a while, though the man was an
  easy one to get information about. He was a gentleman, I may say, who had
  come down in the world through drink, and therefore was rather a marked
  figure in the company he frequented. At last I got on to him again: he was in
  Monte Video. And he was dying. Moreover I discovered by methods into which
  we&mdash;ah!&mdash;need not enter that he was speaking the truth when he told
  me that he had given the map away, and did not know the name of the man he
  had given it to."</p>

  <p>Don Miguel drew an immense handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"Annoying, Mr. Maitland, as you will agree. To have run the man at last to
  earth and then find all one's trouble wasted was a bore. But I have sources
  of information at my disposal, which caused me not to give up hope, even
  though I left for Uruguay and returned here. And sure enough, some weeks
  after the man's death I received word that a certain young Englishman had
  been dining in the Jockey Club in Buenos Aires one evening, and drunk a
  little freely. Also he had talked a little freely. And again to cut a long
  story short it was obvious that this young Englishman was the man to whom the
  sailor had given the map. I, at once, left for the Argentine, only to find
  that I had again missed my man: he had left a week previously for England. I
  trust I am not boring you: you possibly know all this already."</p>

  <p>"No: I don't," said Jim. "You are filling in one or two gaps very
  nicely."</p>

  <p>"As I said, I am putting all my cards on the table," said the Brazilian.
  "To continue, I immediately got into communication with some friends of mine
  in England, giving them the name of the young man, and the boat he was
  travelling in."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Jim shortly. "I know what happened then. They killed
  him."</p>

  <p>The Brazilian waved a deprecating hand.</p>

  <p>"Deplorable, Mr. Maitland, deplorable. I received a cable in code
  informing me of the fact. And&mdash;er&mdash;of other facts too."</p>

  <p>"You interest me profoundly," murmured Jim. "What other facts do you
  allude to?"</p>

  <p>Don Miguel lit a cigarette and blew out a cloud of smoke before
  replying.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to flatter you unduly, Mr. Maitland," he remarked, "but
  your name is one that is fairly widely known. And when I heard from my
  friends in London that you had come into the picture it caused me a certain
  shock. True, they seemed to think that it was purely accidental, and at that
  I had to leave it. But when I discovered you were actually here, and in
  addition were with the sister of the young man who was so unfortunately shot,
  I realised at once that it was not accidental."</p>

  <p>"Your reasoning is most profound," Jim assured him.</p>

  <p>"And so, Mr. Maitland, we come to the point. What are we going to do about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Do about what?"</p>

  <p>"I will be brief, as one busy man to another. Are we going into this thing
  together, or against one another?"</p>

  <p>Jim, in his turn, lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"May I ask by what right you come into it at all?" he asked. "The map
  belonged to young Draycott, and was stolen from him. In addition to that he
  was killed."</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Maitland," said the other contemptuously, "are we members of
  some religious order that we talk about right? And if it comes to that, it
  was originally stolen by the sailor."</p>

  <p>"With that I am not concerned in the slightest," said Jim. "It was given
  to Arthur Draycott, and further back than that I do not propose to go."</p>

  <p>"Am I to take it then that you refuse my offer?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't aware you had made one."</p>

  <p>"I suggest to you that you should cancel your proposed trip in the
  motor-boat and come in with us. My friends arrive the day after to-morrow: we
  leave in the evening. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"Why such altruism, Don Miguel?" asked Jim quietly.</p>

  <p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"If my information is correct there will be plenty for all of us," he
  remarked. "And since I am quite prepared to admit that Miss Draycott has a
  right to her share why should we not join forces?"</p>

  <p>For a while Jim stared at him as if pondering whether to accept the
  proposal. Not that he had the slightest intention of doing so&mdash;he
  trusted Don Silvestre Miguel as far as the length of his foot&mdash;but he
  had to decide what line to take with him. The man was wealthy and
  unscrupulous, and the combination was a formidable one anywhere. In South
  America, where money means everything, it was doubly so.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I fall in with your suggestion," he remarked at length, "what
  guarantee have I, Don Miguel, that your friends will be agreeable?"</p>

  <p>The other leaned forward in his chair.</p>

  <p>"I have been in wireless communication with them, Mr. Maitland," he said.
  "And I may say that it is their idea as much as mine. Come, come: we are men
  of the world. What is the use of your going in comparative discomfort when I
  can offer you the luxury of my yacht? We are bound to meet at the island in
  any case, so why not let us go there together?"</p>

  <p>"The only objection to your idea," said Jim, "is the question of Miss
  Draycott. She knows that your friends were responsible for her brother's
  death, and somewhat naturally she would not relish being forced to meet them
  daily."</p>

  <p>"Then leave her here, Mr. Maitland. You can look after her interests."</p>

  <p>"You don't know the young lady, I'm afraid." remarked Jim, with a smile.
  "She has a very determined character. See here, Don Miguel,"&mdash;he seemed
  to have arrived at a sudden decision&mdash;"I will talk to her about the
  matter. I have, between ourselves, been trying to find an excuse to prevent
  her going. From what I hear, the place is most unhealthy, and not at all
  suitable for a woman. I can say that a hitch has occurred over our own boat,
  and tell her your alternative."</p>

  <p>The Brazilian looked at him searchingly, but Jim Maitland had not played
  poker in most corners of the globe for nothing.</p>

  <p>"Will you do so at once?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, how can I possibly get up straight from a conversation with
  you, and tell her that our boat has failed?"</p>

  <p>Jim gazed at him blandly, and the other nodded his head.</p>

  <p>"True," he acknowledged, "true."</p>

  <p>"It must be done this evening," continued Jim. "After dinner perhaps."</p>

  <p>"And when shall I know your answer?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as that incalculable time has elapsed in which it takes a woman
  to make up her mind," answered Jim, and Don Miguel rose.</p>

  <p>"Very good, Mr. Maitland: we will leave it at that."</p>

  <p>He picked up the card which Jim had laid on the table and scribbled on
  it.</p>

  <p>"My telephone number," he remarked. "I shall hope to hear from you as soon
  as possible."</p>

  <p>Jim watched him cross the lounge, and leave the hotel, bowing
  ceremoniously to Judy as he passed. Then he joined his cousin and the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"Where's Bill?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Gone down to the boat again," said Percy. "What did that bandit
  want?"</p>

  <p>He told them briefly.</p>

  <p>"But you aren't dreaming of doing it, are you, Jim?" cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"I am not," said Jim. "But I had to fob him off with something. If I'd
  given him a flat refusal we'd never have got off to-morrow. As it is it's not
  going to be plain sailing, though I think I've fooled him all right."</p>

  <p>"Are you afraid he may tinker with the boat?" asked Percy.</p>

  <p>"My dear lad, a man with his length of purse in this country can do
  anything. I wish to heaven we could get away to-night. And here's Bill
  returning with a face like a boot."</p>

  <p>"They're getting at us, Mr. Maitland," cried the sailor as he sat down.
  "That old rascal Antonio, who is one of the part owners of the boat has just
  broken it to me. Somebody has spread it around that we're going to Lone Tree
  Island, and not a man will sail with us. Say they'd rather be sacked than go
  to such a place."</p>

  <p>"Hell!" said Jim. "That just about puts the lid on, Bill. What the devil
  are we going to do? Can't you find anybody who will volunteer?"</p>

  <p>The sailor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You know what these dagos are," he said. "I can offer double wages, but
  I'm doubtful of it being much use."</p>

  <p>"What do you want a man for?" demanded Percy.</p>

  <p>"To run the motor, you ass," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Less of your natural history references, James," remarked his cousin. "I
  was about to say that I, in consideration of receiving several blood-red
  rubies as my share of the swag, will undertake that side of the
  performance."</p>

  <p>"But can you, Percy dear?" cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"Can I run that darned motor?" snorted Percy. "Great heavens, woman, what
  do you take me for? I could run it in my sleep."</p>

  <p>"By Jove! old boy," said Jim quietly, "one up to you. I'd forgotten you
  were a motor fan. That's settled that, Bill. Now they're still carrying on
  with the work, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>The sailor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I told them to finish it."</p>

  <p>"And now the point that arises is how to slip away. That blighter Miguel
  is bound to be keeping the boat under observation."</p>

  <p>"We've got to chance that," said Blackett. "And my suggestion is this.
  Instead of waiting till dawn to-morrow, we'll get away as soon after midnight
  as possible. There is a night watchman on the yard who's a pal of mine, and
  there will be no trouble about getting in. I'll let Antonio think that we're
  giving up the trip as we can't get a mechanic, and we'll just have to trust
  to luck."</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not good enough, Bill. I agree over getting her away under cover of
  darkness, but we've got to plant 'em on a false trail. Otherwise there's
  going to be knife work. You and young Percy will have to get her ready, while
  Miss Draycott and I draw them off. Let's all go down there now, and we'll
  start the good work. You perceive, don't you, one of our friends&mdash;that
  sallow-looking swab in the corner. He's been watching us like a lynx."</p>

  <p>He ordered the concierge in a loud tone to obtain a taxi, and with no
  effort at concealment told the driver to go to the boat yard.</p>

  <p>"That," he remarked as he got in, "will save our friend following too
  close on our heels. Though I don't suppose he's the only one."</p>

  <p>Having arrived he sent for Antonio and, in fluent Brazilian, he told him
  exactly what he thought of his firm, himself, and his workmen. And during the
  telling a couple of men drew closer and closer.</p>

  <p>"However," he wound up, "since your hands are too cowardly to come with us
  there is nothing more to be said. I shall not require your boat, having found
  another method of getting to my destination&mdash;Don Miguel's yacht. Bill,"
  he ordered, "get on board. And you too, Percy. And stay there," he added in
  an undertone.</p>

  <p>"All the kit and stores," he relapsed into angry Brazilian, "have to be
  packed up, just because there isn't a man with guts in the place."</p>

  <p>"I shall chance it about eleven o'clock, Bill," he muttered. "Be ready for
  us. You can leave the boat for a bit, if they seem to be getting suspicious,
  but get everything fixed by then. I'm going back to the hotel to continue the
  good work."</p>

  <p>Still fuming he helped Judy into the taxi, and gave the address.</p>

  <p>"Your rôle, Judy," he said, as they drove off, "is a flat refusal to go by
  the yacht. You're going to remain here in Rio until our return. Don't forget
  your part for an instant: anyone may be a spy. But with a little bit of luck
  we may bluff 'em."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he really intended to take us in his yacht?" said the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"Not a hope," laughed Jim. "We should have been left high and dry here.
  You can bet they haven't taken all this trouble in order to share anything
  that may be there with a single unnecessary person."</p>

  <p>"Won't it be marvellous if we do find something."</p>

  <p>"Don't build on it, Judy," he warned. "Though I honestly am quite hopeful.
  Neither Miguel nor Dresler strike me as gentlemen who waste time or money.
  Here's the hotel: play up for all you're worth."</p>

  <p>And play up she did to the vast edification of the sallow-faced gentleman
  who reappeared mysteriously from nowhere. No power on earth would induce her
  to go on Don Miguel's yacht, and if Jim was unable to get anyone to man the
  boat she would remain in Rio. And finally with a shrug of his shoulders he
  strolled away to the bar, calling high heaven to witness on the
  unreasonableness of woman. Then he instructed the hall porter to get Don
  Miguel on the telephone for him, and to him he spoke at length. He wondered
  who could have given his destination away: so did Don Miguel. Anyway it
  settled things, and he would accompany Don Miguel in his yacht, at which the
  Brazilian professed himself overjoyed. And finally he left the box with the
  comforting reflection that if the bluff had failed it was not for want of
  lying.</p>

  <p>They had dinner, after which there was nothing to do but sit and wait. The
  sallow-faced man had gone, but there were several men in the lounge any one
  of whom might have been his successor. They had decided on their plan, and
  time seemed to drag interminably. At ten o'clock Judy rose from her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Jim," she said irritably, "it's insufferably hot. Can't we take a car and
  go somewhere before going to bed?"</p>

  <p>He stifled a yawn.</p>

  <p>"Bit late, Judy, isn't it?" he remarked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I can't help it: I'll never sleep. Let's drive out to that place where
  they bathe."</p>

  <p>"Capacabana!" His expression was resigned. "All right."</p>

  <p>He beckoned to a page.</p>

  <p>"Tell the hall porter to get me a taxi. I want to go for a run to
  Capacabana."</p>

  <p>The boy gave the message, and returned shortly after to say the car was
  waiting.</p>

  <p>And it was not until they were half-way to their destination that Jim
  turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"A little bit too clever, Judy," he said in a low voice, "or rather, not
  quite clever enough. But it's going to complicate things. This driver is one
  of them."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"At about a quarter to ten I had a look at the taxi rank opposite the
  hotel. This car was in front. Two taxis were ordered between then and ten
  o'clock when we got this one. Why did he let two other men take the
  jobs?"</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"You'll see in a moment," he said. "But it's a lucky thing all taxis here
  are open cars."</p>

  <p>He gave an order in Brazilian to the driver.</p>

  <p>"I've told him to drive right out to the end beyond the hotel," he told
  the girl. "And when we get there I will show you a little trick of my
  own."</p>

  <p>The lights grew fewer and farther between, and at length ceased
  altogether. And suddenly Jim told the man to stop. In his hand he held a
  short bar which he was balancing carefully. She watched him fascinated, as,
  all in a single movement, he rose and hit the driver one blow on the nape of
  the neck. And the driver collapsed like a log on the floor of the car.</p>

  <p>"Not everybody's weapon," said Jim calmly, as he rummaged under the seat
  for some rope. "It's very easy to kill a man with it unless you're careful.
  Now this sportsman will sleep peacefully for about four hours, but in case he
  wakes sooner we may just as well truss him up."</p>

  <p>He pulled out a length of cord evidently used for baggage, and tied the
  unconscious driver up deftly. Then he placed him gently in the ditch, and put
  a hundred <i>milreis</i> note in his pocket. After which he jumped into the
  driving-seat.</p>

  <p>"It's neck or nothing, Judy," he said, as he turned the car round. "We'd
  never have got away with that lad at the wheel. And now I think we may, if
  luck is with us."</p>

  <p>They swung back towards Rio, with Jim crouching over the wheel to conceal
  his height. To reach the docks they had to go through the main street, and it
  was there that the danger lay, for the police in the Avenida Rio Branco are
  an extremely capable body of men. But fortune was with them: nobody held up
  the car, and at a few minutes to eleven he pulled up outside Antonio's boat
  yard.</p>

  <p>The place looked dark and deserted, but not until he had taken a careful
  look round did Jim allow the girl to get out of the car. Piles of wood and
  barrels afforded admirable hiding-places for would-be watchers, and he dared
  take no risks with Judy. At last he was satisfied, and taking her by the arm
  he rushed her across to the entrance.</p>

  <p>Bill Blackett had been as good as his word: it was open. And still holding
  her arm he piloted her inside. The boat lay some twenty yards ahead of them
  and he was making straight for it when his eye caught a movement near a big
  coil of rope on his right. Instantly he thrust Judy behind him, and, in a low
  voice called out something in Brazilian.</p>

  <p>It was the only chance, and he took it. If the mover was Bill or Percy it
  did not matter: if he was one of the opposition he might, in the darkness,
  think Jim was one of his friends. And the ruse succeeded: a figure rose and
  came towards him. He waited tensely: on the look-out at any moment for a
  knife to be thrown.</p>

  <p>He spoke again, and the man answered.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Pedro?"</p>

  <p>And a fraction of a second too late he realised it was not. He opened his
  mouth to shout, but no sound came. Jim's vice-like grip closed on his throat,
  and he felt himself picked up like a child.</p>

  <p>"Run, Judy, run for the boat," Jim muttered. "There are others about."</p>

  <p>He dragged the man with him, and hauled him on board gurgling and
  spluttering. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a light in an adjoining
  shed, and heard the sound of voices: the rest of the bunch were playing
  cards. And then from in front of him he heard the girl give a little cry. She
  was in the saloon which was lit by a solitary candle. And trussed up in two
  chairs like a pair of gagged mummies were Percy and Bill Blackett.</p>

  <p>"Not a sound," whispered Jim imperatively. "It's our only hope. Get a
  knife out of the drawer and cut 'em loose. Bill first."</p>

  <p>He dared not relax his grip for an instant on his own man for fear he
  would shout, and in a fever of impatience he watched the girl slashing at the
  rope until Bill Blackett was free.</p>

  <p>"Cast her off, Bill," he ordered, "from the boat. It doesn't matter if we
  lose the ropes. Then fend her off from the side."</p>

  <p>"I get you," grunted the sailor, sprinting on deck.</p>

  <p>"Percy&mdash;stand by the motor. But for the love of Allah don't start it
  until I tell you."</p>

  <p>His cousin nodded and he turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Quick, Judy&mdash;I must go and help Bill. Take my handkerchief from my
  pocket and cram it into this swab's mouth with the handle of the knife. Mind
  your fingers, for he'll bite. Good. Now some of that rope. Can you make a
  running noose? Splendid girl. Slip it round that elbow. That's right: I can
  manage now."</p>

  <p>He hauled the rope tight, lashing the man's arms behind his back: then he
  attended to his knees. And finally he wound the table-cloth round his head,
  and threw him into one of the off shore cabins.</p>

  <p>"Stay here, Judy. On no account come on deck."</p>

  <p>He vanished silently, almost colliding with Bill Blackett.</p>

  <p>"She's cast off," said the sailor, "and if you can take one boat hook aft
  I'll go forrard with the other."</p>

  <p>"We want to get her out just far enough for them not to be able to jump,
  Bill," he said, and the other nodded.</p>

  <p>The card game was apparently still in progress, as they got on deck, and
  an angry altercation was taking place, which was all to the good. But the
  motor was bound to make too much noise for any quarrel to drown, and Jim
  realised, only too clearly, that it was touch and go. At length they got her
  out about six feet, so that she had a clear run for the open water. It was
  then or never, and he beckoned to Bill.</p>

  <p>"Tell Percy to start up," he ordered, "and slip her into half-speed at
  once, without waiting for any signal. I'll steer."</p>

  <p>He waited tensely at the wheel, and suddenly, with a snort, the motor
  hummed into life. Came instant silence from the shed: then a rush of cursing
  men to the side of the wharf. Ten yards: twenty, and a knife quivered in the
  deck at his feet. Thirty: forty&mdash;they'd done it, and he grinned
  happily.</p>

  <p>"How did they get you, Bill?" he sung out to Blackett, who was fixing the
  lights.</p>

  <p>"About a dozen of 'em swarmed on board, and caught us napping," answered
  the other.</p>

  <p>And it was at that moment that Percy popped his head up.</p>

  <p>"I say, dear old lad," he remarked, "everything is fearfully jolly and all
  that, but I suppose you know it's my cabin you have bunged little bright eyes
  into."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" cried Jim, "I'd forgotten all about him. Unlash the blighter,
  and send him up on deck."</p>

  <p>"Now, you swab," he said, as the man appeared shaking with fright. "Can
  you swim?"</p>

  <p>Not a yard, he protested, with chattering teeth. Since childhood he had
  had a horror of water.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are we to do with him, Bill?" said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Let him do the washing up," answered the sailor. "There's a cubby-hole
  aft he can doss down in."</p>

  <p>"Take him with us? Yes: I suppose we must. If the man can't swim, we can
  hardly throw him overboard."</p>

  <p>He turned to him and spoke in Brazilian.</p>

  <p>"You're coming with us, do you understand. And you'll have to make
  yourself generally useful. For if I have the smallest trouble with you I'll
  trail you astern at the end of a rope as bait for sharks."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">THEY sighted Lone Tree Island at dawn on the second day, and
  as they drew nearer Blackett searched the shore anxiously with his glasses.
  It was the northern end they were approaching, and his memory of the place
  was a little rusty. The beach which lay at the foot of the hill was guarded
  by a reef of rocks, and the line of surf looked unbroken. But somewhere there
  was a gap, and it was for that he was making. They had decided that it would
  be fatal to use the southern anchorage: they would see quite enough of the
  opposition without lying alongside them. And from what he remembered the gap
  was wide enough to let their boat through but would prove impossible for the
  yacht.</p>

  <p>At last they saw it, and Jim looked at him doubtfully. It was about ten
  yards across, and at each edge the swell broke lazily on vicious black rocks.
  Beyond it, some two hundred yards away, was the shore, and the intervening
  water was as calm as a lake. An ideal harbour; anything but an ideal
  entrance.</p>

  <p>They nosed in closer going dead slow, and the nearer they got the nastier
  it looked. Blackett was at the wheel: Jim was up in the bows peering into the
  water ahead.</p>

  <p>"If we bump, go all out, Percy," he said. "We'll have to beach her."</p>

  <p>And to this day Bill Blackett swears the boat must have had an indiarubber
  bottom.</p>

  <p>"She bounced twice and then skidded," he affirms, "but she got
  through."</p>

  <p>After which the crew had breakfast, and discussed the plan of
  campaign.</p>

  <p>"We can presumably rely on having to-day undisturbed," said Jim. "And
  there is a possibility of to-morrow also. They can't arrive until to-night,
  and they won't know until it's light that they've got a useless map. Then
  they've got to find us. So that if we're away from here by dawn to-morrow we
  may get an extra twelve hours. But that is the absolute maximum. Wherefore,
  chaps, we've got to get a move on."</p>

  <p>And so, a quarter of an hour later they rowed ashore in the dinghy leaving
  the Brazilian to amuse himself on board. Each of them carried a revolver and
  a heavy stick, and Jim had a rucksack strapped on his shoulders, in which was
  the food for lunch. And having beached the dinghy they started the climb.</p>

  <p>The northern side of the hill was practically bare of any vegetation. For
  the first two or three hundred feet a few stunted shrubs grew sparsely: above
  that a thin brown weed, which might by courtesy have been called grass,
  stretched up to the summit. The slope was steep, but easy, and since the sun
  as yet had but little heat they made the top without difficulty.</p>

  <p>"Seems rum to be back here after all these years," said the sailor. "If
  anyone had offered me a hundred pounds to sixpence against it I wouldn't have
  taken it."</p>

  <p>Below them lay the swampy half of the island. A thick mist covered it
  eddying sluggishly into the giant trees which came down to the edge of the
  marsh land and there stopped abruptly. A faint southerly breeze was blowing,
  and it carried to their nostrils that strange unmistakable scent of rotting
  vegetation which sends the man who knows to his medicine-chest for quinine
  twice daily. Fever&mdash;the place stank of it, as Bill Blackett had said in
  London.</p>

  <p>Surrounding the swamp on three sides was higher ground: on the fourth lay
  the sea. Their own vantage point was the highest in the island, rising from
  the low foothills that formed the northern end. And due west, some two miles
  away there stood the Lone Tree. It seemed to have escaped from the forest
  which comprised the western half, and to be standing like a solitary sentinel
  in front of an army that had halted a few hundred yards away. And Jim, as he
  looked at that dense jungle, felt his heart sink. He alone of the party knew
  from past experience the difficulties of cutting a path through undergrowth
  of that sort, and keeping any sort of direction. However he said nothing and
  produced his compass.</p>

  <p>"We'll take a bearing due south-west from here," he explained, "and see if
  it passes through any conspicuous spot which we can remember when we get to
  the Lone Tree. Then when we get the line between C and A from there, we may
  get an approximate position."</p>

  <p>He let the compass settle, and then prolonged the line by laying his stick
  on the ground.</p>

  <p>"It's pointing straight at that huge mass of scarlet flowers," cried
  Judy.</p>

  <p>"Come on," he said abruptly. "Let's get to the Lone Tree."</p>

  <p>The mist was slowly clearing from the swamp, showing glimpses of vivid
  green interspersed with dull brown ground.</p>

  <p>"Lord! what a death trap," he exclaimed involuntarily, and at that moment
  Bill Blackett clutched his arm.</p>

  <p>"Look," he muttered, "at that bit of green half-left of you."</p>

  <p>He was staring through his glasses, and Jim focussed his own. The mist was
  still swirling in thin wisps over the marsh, but it suddenly lifted for a few
  seconds from the spot which the sailor had pointed to. And, quite distinctly,
  he saw something heaving and struggling in the green slime. Then all was
  still: whatever it was had gone under. But still he kept his glasses fixed.
  What was that moving on the brown ground which flanked the green? There were
  two, three, half a dozen.... And then the mist came down again, blotting out
  everything.</p>

  <p>"Is that what happened to the crew of the <i>Paquinetta</i>?" said
  Blackett sombrely. "Anyway, what was it, Mr. Maitland?"</p>

  <p>Jim glanced at him quickly: evidently he had not seen the others.</p>

  <p>"Some animal caught in the bog," he said shortly. "It often happens, even
  on Dartmoor, or in the New Forest. Let's get a move on."</p>

  <p>But half-way to the Lone Tree he paused and adjusted his glasses once
  again. The mist had completely gone: the swamp lay open below them. But
  though he scanned it from end to end no living thing stirred. Only the faint
  reek of it rose poisonous to heaven.</p>

  <p>It was getting hot when they reached the Lone Tree, and a haze was already
  shimmering over the forest. But it was not enough to prevent them picking up
  the cairn of stones on the high ground at the south of the island. And having
  done so for a moment or two they all stood silent staring at one another. For
  the line to the cairn passed directly through the centre of the great patch
  of scarlet flowers they had picked up from the hill.</p>

  <p>"Why we've only got to walk till we find it," cried Judy, "and we've got
  the spot."</p>

  <p>"Not quite so easy as it sounds, Judy," said Jim. "In the first place
  we've got to keep our direction going through the undergrowth, when we shan't
  be able to see the flowers; and in the second place the flowers look very
  different when looked at from where we are now, to what they will when we're
  standing underneath them. What's up, Bill?"</p>

  <p>The sailor drew him on one side.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Mr. Maitland," he said in a low voice, "chuck it. It's
  not worth it. Those flowers never grew there naturally: why, there's not
  another patch that you can see. They have been planted, I tell
  you&mdash;planted as an ornament, as a decoration."</p>

  <p>"Decoration! For what?"</p>

  <p>"For what is underneath them. There, in the forest."</p>

  <p>"You're talking rot, Bill," said Jim curtly, though the strangeness of
  that one flaming splash of colour had not escaped him. And yet the thing was
  absurd: the sailor was a superstitious ass. The flower looked like the
  ordinary scarlet hibiscus, as common in the tropics as the daisy is at home.
  It was just coincidence, and lucky coincidence that this great square of them
  should mark the spot they wanted. So he argued to himself, cursing Bill
  mentally for having made such an argument necessary.</p>

  <p>He took the compass bearing on the cairn of stones, and found it was
  south-south-west: then he gave the order to march.</p>

  <p>"I'll lead," he said. "Then Judy after me. Bill&mdash;you bring up the
  rear. And watch for snakes every step you take."</p>

  <p>He calculated that the distance was about three miles, and it soon became
  obvious that they would never do it that day. The heat once they left the
  open became well-nigh unbearable: the undergrowth in places seemed like a
  solid wall. Huge lianas&mdash;the size of a ship's cable&mdash;hung in great
  festoons from the trees; rank weeds and tropical ferns with tendrils the size
  of a man's arm blocked the way, and had to be slashed at with knives to
  afford a passage. In places they were almost in darkness, so thick was the
  foliage above: then they would stumble into a patch of sunlight where
  gorgeous humming birds flitted like exquisite coloured jewels above their
  heads.</p>

  <p>The sweat poured off them, and at the end of an hour Jim made out that
  they had blazed a trail for about half a mile. But the exertion had been
  terrific, and the girl, though she made no complaint, was obviously
  exhausted. Moreover the going was becoming worse as they got deeper in, and
  reluctantly he called a halt.</p>

  <p>"We must take a breather," he said, "or we'll all be cooked. Anyway,
  Bill," he added with a laugh, "your boy friends you told us about in London
  haven't used this route."</p>

  <p>But there was no answering smile on the sailor's face.</p>

  <p>"Maybe not, Mr. Maitland, but that isn't to say they're not here."</p>

  <p>"You're a darned old optimist, aren't you?" said Jim, lighting a
  cigarette. "But if they are, I wish we could rope 'em in to do a job of
  work."</p>

  <p>For half an hour they sat there in the steamy heat. Save for the hum of a
  myriad insects the silence was complete. Once in the distance they heard the
  raucous screech of a parrot, but, save for that, everything was still. And
  then quite suddenly there came a sound which brought them all to their feet
  listening intently.</p>

  <p>It seemed to come from a long way off, and yet, though faint, it was quite
  distinct. Clang: clang: clang: it went on monotonously for more than a
  minute. Then it ceased, and silence settled on them once again.</p>

  <p>"It sounded like a bell," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Like a ship's bell," agreed Blackett gravely. "I forget if I told you
  that the <i>Paquinetta's</i> bell was missing."</p>

  <p>"Look here, old sailor," put in Percy, "you're enough to give one the
  woodle-ums, you know. This darned wood ain't my idea of fun and laughter at
  the best of times, without having the ghost of a bell chucked in."</p>

  <p>Jim was staring thoughtfully in front of him. There was no possibility of
  a mistake: they had all heard it. Whether it was the <i>Paquinetta's</i> bell
  or not was immaterial: the vital fact remained that some bell had sounded.
  Who had rung it? It had pealed methodically, at fixed intervals of time. What
  agency had been at work?</p>

  <p>He began to pace up and down the little clearing. What were those things
  he had seen in the swamp that morning? Could it be possible that there was
  something in Blackett's fantastic theory? And if so&mdash;what about Judy? He
  and the two men could take their chance, but the bare idea of the girl
  falling into the hands of some primitive race of savages made him shudder to
  contemplate.</p>

  <p>There was another point too, which had to be taken into consideration. In
  this dense forest they were at a terrible disadvantage. The value of a
  revolver was reduced to nothing, if the target was invisible. At any moment
  they might be surrounded by things that knew their way about the undergrowth,
  and though they might account for a few of them the risk was too great while
  Judy was with them. There was nothing else for it: they must go back. And the
  fact that, in any event, at their present rate of progress they could not
  hope to reach their objective that day, afforded Jim an admirable excuse
  without mentioning his fears.</p>

  <p>"We've got to think of some other way of doing this job," he remarked at
  length. "This is impracticable, especially in this heat. Let's go back to the
  boat and have a pow-wow."</p>

  <p>"But what other way can there be, Jim?" cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"That's what we've got to talk over," he said. "But this is no go, Judy.
  About turn, Bill: you lead the way."</p>

  <p>They halted for a time at the top of the hill to get the benefit of the
  faint breeze that was blowing, and to search the island more thoroughly with
  glasses. But nothing moved, save the shimmering heat haze which lay like a
  blanket over the whole place. At last they descended to the beach and pulled
  out in the dinghy to the boat.</p>

  <p>"Think of an iced Pilsener," said Percy, "pouring gently down your throat
  with two more on the table to follow."</p>

  <p>"I hope that ass Lopez has remembered to keep the drinking water in the
  sea," remarked Jim. "And where is the blighter, anyway."</p>

  <p>They tied up the dinghy and climbed on board: the deck was deserted.</p>

  <p>"Lopez!" he called: there was no answer.</p>

  <p>"Probably asleep," said Percy. "Iced Pilsener," he repeated dreamily: "in
  long, long glasses. Lovely light yellow beer. And instead of that&mdash;tepid
  water in enamel mugs. Who would be an explorer? James, you would appear to be
  perturbed. What ails your manly spirit?"</p>

  <p>"Lopez is not in the boat," said Jim quietly.</p>

  <p>"He's probably gone a little ta-ta ashore," said his cousin. "Got tired of
  playing alone here, and thought he'd be an explorer too."</p>

  <p>"How did he get ashore?" remarked Jim even more quietly.</p>

  <p>"In the dinghy," said his cousin, and then paused abruptly. "By Jove! old
  lad, your meaning penetrates the grey matter. We left the dinghy ashore."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Are you perfectly certain he's not on board?" cried the girl.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. Bill and I have looked everywhere."</p>

  <p>"He must have swum," said Percy.</p>

  <p>"He can't swim," answered Jim.</p>

  <p>"He <i>said</i> he couldn't, Mr. Maitland," said the sailor. "Maybe he
  lied. Maybe he didn't relish the thought of meeting his pals at Rio just
  after he'd let 'em down."</p>

  <p>"That's true, Bill," said Jim thoughtfully. "But what about his
  clothes?"</p>

  <p>"In the absence of all our lady passengers he probably dispensed with
  them," answered Percy.</p>

  <p>"I can't say I saw many signs of a naked man rushing wildly about the
  hillside," said Jim, "but perhaps you're right."</p>

  <p>"Well, dash it all, old boy," remarked his cousin, "the blighter can't
  have jumped two hundred yards, and since, so far as I know, he didn't possess
  wings he bally well must have swum if he's not here. And personally I'm going
  to get into my little paddling drawers and do the same. Come on, Judy: let us
  brave the octopi together."</p>

  <p>"You're worried, Jim," said the girl quietly.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit, bless you," he cried. "Probably Percy is right. You go and hit
  the water and I'll join you in a few minutes. Then we'll decide on a plan of
  campaign."</p>

  <p>He watched them go below: then he lit a cigarette thoughtfully. And he had
  barely taken a puff when Bill Blackett who had gone aft called him.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Bill?" he said, joining him.</p>

  <p>In silence the sailor pointed to the little sink where the washing up was
  done. In it lay the fragments of half a dozen broken plates which had been
  dropped in a pile.</p>

  <p>"Well!" said Jim. "What about it?"</p>

  <p>"What made him drop them, Mr. Maitland?" remarked the sailor gravely.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another, Bill," answered Jim. "Such things have been known to
  happen before."</p>

  <p>"Aye! that's true, and I'm not saying it may not have been an accident."
  He was stuffing his pipe from a weather-beaten pouch, and Jim waited. "Mr.
  Maitland," went on the sailor, "clothes or no clothes, the dago was not on
  shore or we should have seen him from the top of the hill."</p>

  <p>"He may have been in the forest, like us," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"In the forest," snorted the other. "Not he! I can sling enough of his
  lingo to have talked with him once or twice. And the Hounds of Hell would not
  have even got him ashore here, much less into the forest. He was scared stiff
  of the place."</p>

  <p>"Then where the devil is he?" demanded Jim, and Blackett pointed downwards
  with his thumb.</p>

  <p>"Drowned," he said tersely. "That was no accident&mdash;the smashing of
  those plates. He dropped them because he was frightened to death. Something
  came round the corner of the cuddy, Mr. Maitland, that drove him mad with
  terror&mdash;so mad that it didn't matter whether he could swim or whether he
  couldn't. He sprang overboard sooner than face it."</p>

  <p>Jim stared at the sailor thoughtfully: was it possible he had hit on the
  right solution? He agreed with him&mdash;though he had appeared to
  differ&mdash;that the Brazilian would not have gone ashore of his own free
  will. And if he had remained in the boat something of the sort must have
  happened. But what manner of thing could it have been that drove a
  non-swimmer so crazy with fear that he jumped overboard to certain death by
  drowning?</p>

  <p>The dinghy had not been moved: they had found it in exactly the same spot
  as they had left it. Therefore this thing must have swum to the boat. And
  suddenly he noticed a damp patch on the deck just in front of him, which
  might have been caused by wet feet. Outside the sun would have removed all
  traces, but this was in the shade. And he pictured to himself the wretched
  Lopez turning round as a shadow fell on him: the plates falling from his
  nerveless hands, his scream of fear as he dashed away from the thing that had
  entered. And then the splash as he hurled himself overboard. Or maybe he had
  been thrown.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear Watson, I trust you have solved the trifling problem of the
  Missing Brazilian," remarked Holmes, injecting cocaine into his left
  ankle.</p>

  <p>Percy had joined them in his bathing kit.</p>

  <p>"He seems to have been a bit prodigal with the crockery," he went on as he
  saw the broken plates.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Percy," said Jim, "Bill has got a theory. And, 'pon my soul,
  I'm not certain he isn't right."</p>

  <p>"We are prepared to listen," remarked Holmes courteously, injecting
  cocaine into the right ankle. "But I pray you&mdash;be brief. I would fain
  bathe."</p>

  <p>He seated himself on the table and lit a cigarette, while Jim told him the
  sailor's idea.</p>

  <p>"And as I said before," he concluded, "I'm not certain he isn't
  right."</p>

  <p>"Well," said his cousin, who had become serious as he listened, "granted
  for the moment that he is, what do we do next?"</p>

  <p>"If you take my advice, gentlemen," remarked the sailor gravely, "you'll
  up anchor and leave at once. You know the other name for the island, don't
  you? I forget the native words, but translated it means the island of no
  return."</p>

  <p>"Seems a bit fatuous to come all this way, and then go all the way back
  again just because a dago disappears," said Percy.</p>

  <p>"It's not because he disappeared," said the sailor stubbornly, "it's
  because of what made him disappear."</p>

  <p>"Steady on, Bill," put in Jim. "We mustn't fall into the error of taking
  your theory as a proven fact, you know. There are at least two others which
  would account for things. He might have lied when he said he couldn't swim,
  and in spite of our not seeing him, he may be on shore now. Or he might
  suddenly have been taken ill, dropped the plates, rushed to the side and
  fallen overboard."</p>

  <p>"Come on, you lazy blighters: it's glorious in the water."</p>

  <p>Judy's voice hailed them from outside.</p>

  <p>"Avaunt, child," answered Percy. "A council of state is in session."</p>

  <p>"Not a word to her, Percy," muttered Jim, "of this idea of Bill's," and
  his cousin nodded.</p>

  <p>"Naturally not," he said, as the girl poked her head round the corner.</p>

  <p>"What are you sitting in this frowsty hole for?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"We'll be along in a minute," said Jim. "We're just having a bit of a
  pow-wow. Now look here, you fellows," he continued as she disappeared, "I
  figure it out this way. Let us assume for the moment that you're correct,
  Bill. Let us assume that something made its way on board that was so
  terrifying to Lopez that he shot overboard. Now he was unarmed: moreover he
  was down here. So he was taken by surprise. But we know this something that
  we are assuming came on board, must have swum. Even if it had come in the
  dinghy it had to cover two hundred yards of open water. What chance then
  would it have had if there had been a look-out on deck with a rifle?"</p>

  <p>"Not an earthly," agreed Percy, and Bill grunted assent.</p>

  <p>"Now two facts stick out a yard," continued Jim. "The first is that under
  no conceivable circumstances must we run the slightest risk of Judy being put
  in the same position as Lopez."</p>

  <p>He paused and a faint smile came to his lips.</p>

  <p>"And the second?" demanded the sailor.</p>

  <p>"The second, Bill, is that I am of an inordinately curious disposition. I
  just wouldn't sleep o' nights for the rest of my life if I didn't find out
  who rang that bell and why: what lies under the patch of scarlet hibiscus:
  and a lot of other things."</p>

  <p>"You're mad and foolhardy, Mr. Maitland," said the sailor. "How do you
  propose to do it?"</p>

  <p>"Go and have a look," answered Jim with a grin, "leaving you, Bill, armed
  with the express rifle on guard over Miss Draycott here. Percy can please
  himself. He can either stop here with you, or he can come with me."</p>

  <p>"It's madness," said the sailor once again. "Utter madness."</p>

  <p>"Can't help it, old lad: I've always been mad. Well, Percy, what about
  you? For the shore after lunch, or not?"</p>

  <p>"You bet your life I'm for the shore," said his cousin. "But what exactly
  are you intending to do? Carry on from where we left off this morning?"</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "We started off on a false trail there. I propose that
  we wander along the edge of the swamp, and see if we can't find some track
  that will lead us into the forest without the necessity of hacking our way
  through the undergrowth. We may fail: if so we can only return."</p>

  <p>"And you'll be back before dark," said the sailor.</p>

  <p>"That's the idea, Bill," agreed Jim.</p>

  <p>"And supposing you're not," continued the other.</p>

  <p>"Why then, Bill, we'll be back after dark," laughed Jim. "Cheer up, you
  old croaker: Percy will be there to look after me."</p>

  <p>The sailor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"All right, Mr. Maitland. You're the captain of this outfit, and what you
  say goes. But I still think you're a damned fool who is asking for trouble.
  And if you get it don't blame me."</p>

  <p>With which Parthian shot he stumped off to his cabin.</p>

  <p>"I say, Jim, do you <i>really</i> think there is anything in his idea?"
  said Percy.</p>

  <p>"That, old lad, is what we propose to find out," answered his cousin. "And
  in the meantime let's join Judy in the water."</p>

  <p>Jim had chosen the edge of the swamp as the line of advance for two
  reasons. Firstly, it struck him that by sticking to the brown tracks which
  flanked the green patches they would get good going in the open: and secondly
  he hoped that if there were any paths leading into the forest they would find
  some of them there. He had not forgotten the things he had seen through the
  mist that morning, and he argued that they would probably have had some line
  of approach, since the only place they could have disappeared into was the
  forest itself.</p>

  <p>At the same time he fully realised that if there were tracks, and Percy
  and he used them, their chances of an encounter would be much greater than if
  they tried to again force a way through the undergrowth. And he was under no
  delusions as to the possibility of danger. They would be tackling them on
  their own ground, and under the most unfavourable conditions, especially as
  Percy, though he had practised assiduously on the way out was still a
  positive menace with a revolver.</p>

  <p>What he wanted to do if it proved feasible was to see one of them without
  being seen himself. Then they could arrive at a decision as to whether they
  would carry on or not.</p>

  <p>"You see, old lad," he remarked to Percy, as they beached the dinghy and
  proceeded once more to climb the hill, "we know the forest is inhabited,
  possibly by the most harmless creatures in the world, possibly not. And in
  the latter event, treasure or no treasure, we hop it. There aren't enough of
  us for Judy to be safe. But if they're harmless it's a different matter
  altogether."</p>

  <p>Away to the north a smudge of smoke lay low on the horizon, but the island
  itself seemed lifeless in the intense heat. They scanned the open ground,
  searching for Lopez: there was no sign of him. Nothing moved, nothing
  stirred: the only sound was the lazy beat of the surf. And with a final
  glance backwards at the motor-boat, and Bill sitting grimly in a deck chair
  with his rifle across his knees they began the descent to the swamp.</p>

  <p>It was two o'clock which gave them a good four hours in which to explore
  and be clear of the forest before it was dark. What Jim had surmised proved
  correct: there was a fringe of firm soil skirting the edge of the undergrowth
  which gave them easy walking. In places it was several yards wide, in others
  only a few inches, and lapping it on the other side, save where branches of
  it forked out and meandered across the marsh, lay the deadly green slime.</p>

  <p>They pushed on steadily but cautiously, and it soon became obvious to Jim
  that the track was often used. There were places where the vegetation had
  been deliberately forced back to give greater width. And it was in one such
  place that they came on their first clue. Up till then the ground had been as
  hard as a rock: here they suddenly came on a stretch of some ten yards where
  a stream oozed sluggishly over the path. It had practically dried up, leaving
  the soil soft and muddy, and for a while Jim stared at it, with his face
  growing more and more grave.</p>

  <p>"Look at the footprints, Percy," he said at length. "Poor devil."</p>

  <p>His cousin looked at him sharply.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by 'poor devil'?" he asked.</p>

  <p>But Jim did not reply: he was down on his knees studying the ground more
  closely. The marks were perfectly clear cut, and had obviously been made very
  recently. They were of two distinct sorts, and he examined them both in
  turn.</p>

  <p>The first were those of a naked human foot. The imprints of the five toes
  were deep, and very wide apart: the mark of the heel was even deeper showing
  the great weight of its owner. But it was the size and the length of stride
  that staggered him. His own feet were not small, but he could comfortably
  have got both of them inside one of these. And the distance between them was
  over five feet.</p>

  <p>The second were very different. They had been made by the toe of a pointed
  shoe, and the distance between them was four feet.</p>

  <p>"So Bill was on the right track after all," he said straightening up.
  "Poor devil!"</p>

  <p>"Look here," remarked Percy, "you might remember that I am not as well
  versed in reading mud as you. I assume you are alluding to Lopez, but you
  might explain your sympathy."</p>

  <p>"You spot, don't you," said Jim, "that that is made by the toe of a shoe."
  He pointed to a second trail. "You can see the alternate feet&mdash;right and
  left. You remember also the very pointed shoes he used to wear. So the
  betting is a hundred to one that that trail was made by him. Now how did he
  make it? How would you make a mark like that with your shoe?"</p>

  <p>"By standing on tip-toe," said his cousin.</p>

  <p>"And then hopping four feet like a ballet dancer!" Jim laughed shortly.
  "No, my lad, you can take it from me that those marks were not made by him
  trying to imitate Pavlova. He was a short man, and look at the length of his
  stride. He was running for his life, pursued by the thing that made those
  other marks."</p>

  <p>"How do you know he was being pursued?"</p>

  <p>"Because in two places the thing has obliterated his footprint. Therefore
  it was pursuing him. And it was not running: you can see the mark of its heel
  every time. Though in all conscience with a stride like that it would have no
  need to."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! it's a bit grim," said Percy shakily. "What do you think
  happened, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"My dear man, I know no more than you do. Perhaps the thing went on board,
  as Bill said, and forcibly seized Lopez. Perhaps Lopez swam ashore, and came
  walking down here. All that I can tell you for certain is what is written
  there in the soft ground. And that is that at this actual spot the Brazilian
  was fleeing for his life pursued by something, the like of which I have never
  come across before."</p>

  <p>"And which must certainly have caught him," said his cousin.</p>

  <p>"Unless a miracle occurred."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>Jim pointed to the bog.</p>

  <p>"That would seem at any rate one solution," he remarked quietly. "Though
  they may, of course, be keeping him as a prisoner. And now to get down to the
  present situation, young feller. You may remember I mentioned the possibility
  of these things being harmless. Well, you can wash that out."</p>

  <p>"Carry on," said Percy.</p>

  <p>"It's up to you to decide. Do you want to go on, or do you want to go
  back? I tell you candidly that I think we may at any moment bump into a
  position of very grave danger."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do yourself?" demanded his cousin.</p>

  <p>"In view of the fact that that poor devil may still be alive, I'm going
  on," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Then I'm darned well coming too," cried Percy. "In fact your question, my
  dear James, seems to be of the fatuous order that I have so often noted with
  pain over the rest of your conversation."</p>

  <p>"Stout fellow," grinned Jim. "Let's push."</p>

  <p>They skirted round the sodden patch, and twenty yards beyond it came to
  what Jim had been searching for. Stretching into the forest till it
  disappeared in the gloom ran a path: they had found at any rate one of the
  tracks that might lead them to the solution of the mystery.</p>

  <p>They stood for a time getting their eyes accustomed to the semi-darkness
  after the blinding sunshine: then Jim took his revolver from its holster.</p>

  <p>"Take yours out too, Percy," he said, "but for the love of Allah don't
  point it anywhere near me. And keep your eyes skinned over the back of your
  shoulder. You don't want to be surprised from behind."</p>

  <p>The going was good: evidently the path was one in frequent use. To start
  with it ran quite straight: then it began to twist and jink though the
  general direction remained the same. And after a while even the sound of the
  surf died away: the silence seemed to press on them like a blanket.</p>

  <p>At length they reached a small clearing from which four other tracks led
  out like the spokes of a wheel, and Jim paused. None of them seemed to be a
  direct continuation of the one they had come along, and it was a toss-up
  which to take. The compass was well-nigh useless, as they had only the
  vaguest idea of their present position, but Jim finally selected one that ran
  a little south of west. Then having placed a conspicuous fern to mark the
  path they had come by they started along the new one.</p>

  <p>The pace Jim set was as fast as he dared, consistent with safety. He had
  not exaggerated when he spoke of very grave danger, and he realised that it
  would be graver still if darkness overtook them while they were still in the
  forest. And so, whilst he scouted with the utmost caution whenever he came to
  a bend, he almost ran along the straight stretches. The reassuring thing was
  the continued silence, which seemed to indicate that the other occupants of
  the forest were asleep. And he was sufficiently confident of his powers of
  stalking to hope that, if that were so, he would be able, if they had the
  luck to find them, to get near enough to see what manner of thing it was they
  were up against, and then get away again in safety. There might even be a
  bare possibility of rescuing the Brazilian if he was still alive, but that
  could only be decided later.</p>

  <p>Such was the general plan he decided on as they pressed forward, when
  there came a sudden startling interruption. From away to the left a ship's
  siren blared three times. They halted abruptly, and Jim stared at his
  cousin.</p>

  <p>"I wonder who that is," he said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Probably that ship we saw from the top of the hill," answered Percy.</p>

  <p>The siren wailed again, and Jim frowned.</p>

  <p>"What are they making that infernal din for?" he cried. "Sounds to me as
  if they were signalling. Percy, I wonder if that is Miguel's yacht come
  earlier than we expected. If so..."</p>

  <p>He did not complete the sentence, for a further interruption occurred,
  this time much nearer at hand. The bell they had heard that morning began to
  toll, and with it the sleeping forest awakened to life. From all around them
  came the sounds of movement, and Jim seized his cousin by the arm.</p>

  <p>"In here, for your life," he muttered, forcing his way off the track into
  the undergrowth. "We're right in the middle of them."</p>

  <p>The bell went on tolling, though its sound was almost drowned by the
  noises around them. And once or twice a hoarse bellow, that was half roar,
  half grunt, rang out.</p>

  <p>They cowered down behind some giant ferns: some of the things were close
  to them. But so dense was the vegetation that they could see nothing. And
  after a while the sounds grew fainter and fainter until they died away in the
  distance. The bell ceased tolling: silence settled once again.</p>

  <p>At length Jim straightened up and stepped out into the path.</p>

  <p>"That was rather nearer than I liked," he remarked. "It is a damned lucky
  thing for us, old lad, that they were asleep when we arrived."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Jim?" said his cousin.</p>

  <p>"The bell was obviously a warning signal," he answered, "which was rung
  when the siren was heard. And now they have gone off to investigate."</p>

  <p>"But what are they?" cried Percy.</p>

  <p>"You can take it from me," said Jim gravely, "that whatever they are, it
  is a question of running no risks. But since we are here, and the owners of
  the place appear to have gone, we may as well explore a little further."</p>

  <p>They moved on cautiously: it was more than likely that all of them had not
  gone, and that a guard had been left. And then, quite unexpectedly the track
  opened out into a big clearing.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" muttered Jim, "look at that."</p>

  <p>The space was some thirty yards square, with several openings similar to
  the one they stood in. Above them the trees met, seemingly a solid ceiling of
  scarlet, splashed here and there with the vivid blues and yellows of gaudily
  coloured parrots. Shafts of sunlight shone through, dappling the sides with
  every shade of green: it was a riot of colour that would have made an artist
  rave. But the two men who stood motionless at the entrance hardly noticed it:
  they had eyes only for what stood in the centre of the ground.</p>

  <p>Hanging from a frame was a brass bell, which was still swinging gently
  though no sound came from it. And chased on the bell in black lettering they
  could read the words&mdash;S.S. Paquinetta. Underneath it, between the two
  uprights a man was sitting, a man who did not stir. His knees, lashed
  together with some fibrous stuff, were drawn up: his hands were stretched out
  in front of him. His head lolled sideways: his face, so distorted with agony
  and terror, that the features were almost unrecognizable, stared at them. It
  was Lopez, the Brazilian, and he was dead.</p>

  <p>"Poor devil," muttered Percy shakily. "How did they do it?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," said Jim grimly, as he bent over the dead man. "They've
  murdered him somehow, and yet there's not a sign of any violence nor a trace
  of any blood."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he died of fright."</p>

  <p>"Fright may send a man mad, but I've never yet heard of it killing
  anybody."</p>

  <p>He again bent over the Brazilian, and suddenly he gave an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Look at his right hand," he said. "Do you see how terribly swollen it is?
  He's been poisoned, Percy. That's how they killed the poor blighter."</p>

  <p>He straightened up thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"And if they used poison," he continued, "and lashed his legs, it proves
  they have a certain measure of human brain. No mere animal would do such a
  thing."</p>

  <p>He stared round doubtfully: what was the best thing to do? Never again
  would they have such an opportunity for exploration. A number of paths
  similar to the one they had come by led out of the clearing: it seemed too
  good a chance to miss. And selecting one at random he started along it.</p>

  <p>It led to another clearing, and they had barely gone ten yards along it
  when he stopped short with a sudden gasp.</p>

  <p>"Great Heavens!" he muttered. "It can't be true."</p>

  <p>In the centre of the second space there stood a mysterious object. It was
  about four feet high and fashioned into the representation of a grotesque
  little man. The thing was a monstrosity with a huge paunch and tiny legs. In
  colour it was dull yellow, and in the centre of the forehead there glittered
  a blood-red pool of light. And after a while the usually imperturbable Jim
  began to shake with uncontrollable excitement: he had seen that dull yellow
  before in smaller images, and knew what it meant.</p>

  <p>"Gold, Percy: gold or I'll eat my hat," he cried. "And if that's a ruby in
  its forehead it is worth a king's ransom."</p>

  <p>The thing stood on a little island with a circular strip of water some
  five feet wide all round it. Between its base and the water there was
  undergrowth also to a width of about five feet.</p>

  <p>"It's the temple of their image," went on Jim. "Gosh! old lad, what about
  having a dart for that ruby. If it's gold, as I'm sure it is, there will be
  no difficulty in working it loose."</p>

  <p>"I'm with you," cried Percy, "but we'd better get a move on."</p>

  <p>They went towards it, and suddenly with a cry of warning Jim tried to
  spring back. For the ground in front seemed to rise towards them, and they
  felt themselves falling through space. So intent had they been on the idol
  that they had paid no attention to the path. And they had trodden on one end
  of some baulks of wood roughly joined together which pivoted seesaw fashion
  on a central hinge.</p>

  <p>It was not a long fall, and they picked themselves up shaken but otherwise
  unhurt, as the thing creaked back into position again leaving them in
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"One of the oldest native animal traps there is," cried Jim bitterly. "My
  God! Percy, we've let ourselves in for it now. Thank heavens! there were no
  spikes at the bottom. What a foul stench," he added.</p>

  <p>And then he paused abruptly and gripped his cousin's arm.</p>

  <p>"There's something here," he muttered. "I can hear it moving."</p>

  <p>They crouched motionless staring into the darkness, and quite distinctly
  they could hear its heavy breathing. Then came a slow movement, as if some
  big body was gradually changing its position. The smell seemed to increase,
  and they waited tensely, conscious only of the loud beating of their own
  hearts.</p>

  <p>Came a grunt and a shuffling noise: the thing was coming towards them. And
  suddenly they saw two gleaming eyes not a yard away. The thing was on them,
  and at that moment Jim's revolver roared out, sounding deafening in the shut
  in space.</p>

  <p>The eyes disappeared: he had fired straight between them. There was a thud
  which shook the ground, one or two convulsive movements, then silence. The
  thing was dead.</p>

  <p>"That's going to bring them about our heels," muttered Jim, "if they're
  anywhere in the neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>And then he gave a sudden exclamation.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he cried, "I believe this is a passage, and not merely a trap.
  It's lighter along there."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to have a look and see what you've killed?" said his
  cousin.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to beat it while the going is good," answered Jim grimly. "If
  we're found here, my lad, we shan't be needing our return tickets from
  Rio."</p>

  <p>He led the way, and his surmise was correct. They were in an underground
  tunnel, and on coming to the bend where it had seemed to Jim to be less dark
  they could see the entrance ahead of them. They raced towards it, up the
  rising ground; and found that it opened into a corner of the original
  clearing. And for a while they stood there listening. Had the sound of the
  shot brought the others back? But nothing stirred: save for the motionless
  figure of the dead Brazilian the place was deserted.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Percy gripped his cousin's arm again.</p>

  <p>"Look down that track," he muttered. "I saw something move. Something
  dark. It swung itself across. Man, it was the size of an elephant."</p>

  <p>"I don't see anything," said Jim. "Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"It was gone in a flash," cried Percy. "But I know I saw it."</p>

  <p>"Then let's go," remarked the other. "Probably our hosts are returning.
  You lead the way this time."</p>

  <p>And with a final glance at the dead man, and the bell from the ill-fated
  <i>Paquinetta</i> he followed his cousin out of the clearing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">"I SAY, Jim, oughtn't we to have come to that junction of
  the paths by now?"</p>

  <p>They had been walking rapidly for over a quarter of an hour, and so far
  there had been no sign of anything following them. Whatever it was that Percy
  had seen, apparently it had not seen them. And as the significance of the
  question sank into his mind Jim cursed himself for a fool. He had followed
  his cousin blindly out of the clearing, his mind preoccupied with other
  things, and he realised now that Percy had taken the wrong path. They should
  have reached the junction long since.</p>

  <p>"You're right, Percy," he said. "We're on a different track."</p>

  <p>"I'm damned sorry, old boy," said his cousin apologetically. "I was so
  flustered by that thing I saw that I forgot what I was doing."</p>

  <p>"My fault as much as yours," cried Jim. "However we can't go back, so we
  must go on. It will probably lead us into the open somewhere. The devil of it
  is that we haven't got much more daylight."</p>

  <p>They pushed on faster, and after a while Jim began to grow uneasy. For the
  track kept turning right handed, and the ground was becoming appreciably
  softer.</p>

  <p>"We're getting near the river, Percy," he said. "And that's about the last
  spot we want. Unless we find a path going away to the left we're in the
  soup."</p>

  <p>Suddenly the track forked, and Percy paused.</p>

  <p>"Which one, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Left, of course, but where on earth is this foul stench of musk coming
  from?"</p>

  <p>They went on a few yards and soon discovered. The track had forked in
  order to pass on each side of a large, stagnant pool. Rotting vegetation hung
  in festoons round the banks, but by craning forward carefully they could see
  the water. And floating motionless in it, their evil-looking snouts just
  above the surface, were scores of crocodiles. Others were lying on the slimy
  ooze round the banks, and one huge one occupied the post of honour on a
  half-submerged tree trunk.</p>

  <p>"Repulsive looking brutes," said Jim. "We must be nearer the river than I
  thought."</p>

  <p>And a further few paces brought them to it. Their path turned abruptly
  left-handed following the bank, and they were just turning along it when from
  the distance there came a steady creaking noise and they paused
  listening.</p>

  <p>"The rowlocks of a boat," remarked Jim. "Now we may find out
  something."</p>

  <p>Only a thin screen of undergrowth separated them from the water, and with
  infinite caution they peered through. In front of them was the river; to
  their right the stinking crocodile pool. And by leaning forward a little they
  could see down stream for about fifty yards.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a boat hove in sight, and in the stern sat Don Miguel. By his
  side was a bloated looking red-faced man who held the tiller ropes, and Jim
  put his lips to his cousin's ear.</p>

  <p>"Bully McIntyre," he whispered. "So it was the yacht."</p>

  <p>He was evidently having some argument with Don Miguel and at length the
  latter shrugged his shoulders. The sailor gave an order, the men ceased
  rowing, and McIntyre ran the nose of the boat into the bank.</p>

  <p>"Get ashore, Mr. Murdoch," he ordered, "and see what it's like."</p>

  <p>An officer who had been sitting in the bows seized some overhanging
  branches and hoisted himself out. He was on the opposite side of the pool to
  Jim and Percy, but they could see the glint of his white ducks through the
  undergrowth.</p>

  <p>"There's a regular path here," he sang out, "which seems to lead into the
  forest. Shall I go along and explore it a bit?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but don't get lost."</p>

  <p>And even as McIntyre spoke a scream of fear rang out. They had a fleeting
  glimpse of a white-clad figure falling through the air, followed by a splash.
  And the motionless logs were motionless no longer. The water in the pool
  swirled angrily, and before their eyes the wretched man was torn to
  pieces.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" shouted McIntyre, as the boat moved away from the
  bank, and came upstream a few strokes till it was abreast of the pool.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he went on, "he fell in that damned pool and the crocs have
  got him. You filthy brutes," he roared picking up a rifle and taking aim at
  the big one on the tree. He shot it through the eye, and with its tail
  lashing furiously the great reptile rolled over and sank in the water.</p>

  <p>"I guess we'll come back to-morrow morning," said Don Miguel, "when we've
  got the day in front of us." And the other nodded assent.</p>

  <p>The boat went about, and after a while the noise of the oars died away in
  the distance.</p>

  <p>"Why did that poor devil scream, Percy?" said Jim with a queer look in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dash it all, old lad, most people would give tongue if they found
  themselves in a crocodile pool."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but not until they found themselves there. He yelled before he
  knew there were any crocodiles."</p>

  <p>Percy stared at Jim.</p>

  <p>"You mean..."</p>

  <p>"I mean that he never fell in: he was thrown or pushed in. And it was what
  he saw in that fleeting second that terrified him, and nothing to do with the
  crocodiles. Didn't you see the undergrowth moving on the other side of the
  river as something went through it, keeping pace with the boat? Well, there
  was something this side as well."</p>

  <p>"Following Miguel's party."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And for that reason, at any rate, we can be thankful the yacht
  has arrived earlier than we expected. It's distracted the attention of these
  brutes away from us. Otherwise, I don't mind telling you that I think our
  chances of getting through alive were pretty minute."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have seen that thing you shot."</p>

  <p>"So would I. And in due course you shall&mdash;or one like it. But not
  this trip, Percy."</p>

  <p>"You are coming back?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. Once Judy is safely on her way back to England I return
  here."</p>

  <p>"And what about the other bunch?"</p>

  <p>"They haven't got the map, and if we can get away to-night we've got 'em
  stung. Moreover, seeing that almost all the crew are dagos, one or two more
  regrettable incidents such as we've just witnessed are going to shake 'em
  badly. Let's get a move on."</p>

  <p>They turned along the track going up stream, and found that it soon left
  the bank and turned back into the forest. And now time was vital: at the most
  half an hour of daylight remained to them. The track jinked, then jinked
  again, and Jim gave a sigh of relief as he glanced at his compass: they were
  heading for the open. But there was still at least two miles to cover, and
  the going was getting worse. Evidently the track they were on was not much
  used: tendrils of vegetation met across the clearing through which they had
  to force their way. And dusk was beginning to fall when the first faint reek
  of the swamp came to their nostrils.</p>

  <p>At last they saw it in front of them, and Jim's face was grave. A thin
  white vapour was already rising, and only too well did he realise the danger
  that that portended. In the walk that lay before them a single false step
  might mean death in the green bog, and to have mist as well as darkness to
  contend against would double their difficulty. And he was just debating in
  his mind whether it would not be better to spend the night where they were
  and wait for the dawn, when they saw stealing out from behind the hill that
  stood outlined against the darkening sky, the lights of a ship.</p>

  <p>"Don Miguel's yacht," he muttered. "What the deuce has she been doing
  there? I don't like it, Percy. When we heard her siren she was away south of
  us. What has taken her round to the north of the island?"</p>

  <p>"Probably looking for us," said his cousin.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," remarked Jim. "And they couldn't avoid finding us."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that they can do any harm," said Percy. "They are probably
  peeved over the map, but as you've got that in your pocket it doesn't matter
  much."</p>

  <p>"Damn the map: they can have that for shaving paper. It's Judy I'm
  thinking of."</p>

  <p>"Surely they wouldn't touch her."</p>

  <p>"That swine of a dwarf would murder his mother for sixpence," grunted Jim.
  "Still, Bill was there. Anyway, that settles it: we must push on. I suppose
  one party went away to explore the river, while Dresler went round in the
  yacht to find us. Hullo! what's that?"</p>

  <p>Clear and distinct through the still air had come the sharp crack of a
  rifle. They paused instinctively, and the next moment even Jim felt the hair
  on his head begin to rise. Yell after yell of frenzied terror rang out: then
  sudden, abrupt silence.</p>

  <p>They peered ahead, but could see nothing in the fading light.</p>

  <p>"Heaven send it wasn't Bill coming to find us," cried Jim.</p>

  <p>"What was it, Jim?" muttered his cousin.</p>

  <p>"It <i>was</i> a man," he answered grimly. "I wouldn't like to say what it
  is now."</p>

  <p>"Somebody fallen into the bog perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Possibly. But you don't let off your gun at a bog. And as I say, Heaven
  send it wasn't Bill."</p>

  <p>"He'd never have left Judy."</p>

  <p>"I agree. But supposing Judy left him."</p>

  <p>He pointed at the yacht which was now abreast of them.</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm afraid of, Percy."</p>

  <p>"You mean they may have kidnapped her."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. As a lever to make us give up the map. And then Bill came along
  to meet us."</p>

  <p>"He'd never have let them take her."</p>

  <p>"How could he prevent them? He would have shot anything he saw coming off
  from the shore, but he couldn't shoot a boat-load of men coming from a yacht.
  Damn it! if it isn't Bill who can it be?"</p>

  <p>"And you think one of the things got him?"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Jim gravely. "The poor old lad fired and missed. And what
  we've got to watch out for is that we don't do the same. It may have been a
  chance encounter, or they may post sentinels out at night."</p>

  <p>They pressed on as fast as they dared. Luckily the mist was getting no
  denser, but the light had almost gone. And it was about five minutes after
  they had heard the shot that Jim rounded a projecting bush and stopped
  abruptly with his hand held up in warning to his cousin.</p>

  <p>"Look at that," he muttered as Percy joined him. "It was here that it
  happened."</p>

  <p>The undergrowth was trampled and beaten down, showing every sign of a
  desperate struggle. But of the combatants there was no trace. They listened
  intently: nothing stirred in the forest. And at length Jim crept cautiously
  forward.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his foot met something hard, and he stooped and picked it up. And
  the next moment he cursed savagely.</p>

  <p>"My gun, Percy," he said. "The one I gave Bill."</p>

  <p>A spasm of rage shook him.</p>

  <p>"By God!" he cried, "these things&mdash;whatever they are&mdash;will
  regret this. Once I've got Judy safely away, I'll come back here with a
  proper expedition and exterminate the lot. What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>His cousin had bent forward excitedly, and was staring at something on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"It's a hat, Jim," he cried. "And it's not Bill's."</p>

  <p>"What's that? Let me see it."</p>

  <p>He picked up the hat: it was wet and sticky. And glancing at his fingers
  he saw they were red. He looked inside the hat, and then with a feeling of
  uncontrollable repulsion he flung it far out into the swamp. For its late
  owner's head had been literally battered to pieces.</p>

  <p>"Poor devil," he muttered. "You're sure it's not Bill's, Percy?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain."</p>

  <p>"Then how did my gun get here?"</p>

  <p>But his cousin did not answer: he was standing by a big tree that grew on
  one side of the beaten-down patch.</p>

  <p>"Jim," he cried shakily, "this tree is all wet."</p>

  <p>It was true, and for a moment Jim stared at it incredulously. At first he
  had assumed that the deed had been done with a club or even possibly the butt
  of the gun. But the blood on the tree told a different tale, and one that was
  well-nigh inconceivable. For it proved that the man had been killed by having
  his head bashed against the trunk, and the strength necessary to do such a
  thing was unbelievable. And in his imagination he visualised the scene. The
  shot, fired in a panic at the monstrous thing that had suddenly appeared out
  of the dusk: the brief hopeless struggle when the bullet missed, and then the
  ghastly ending with the lifeless body flung into the bog.</p>

  <p>But who was it? Surely Bill would not have handed over the only long range
  weapon they had with them to somebody else, unless he had been compelled to.
  At the best of times he was a very bad shot with a revolver, so it was hard
  to believe that he would have lent the rifle to anyone willingly. And if that
  was so what had happened on board the motor-boat?</p>

  <p>The forest was silent as they started off again. Twice during the next
  hour they heard from far off that strange grunting roar answered from three
  or four different places which showed that the denizens were on the prowl.
  But their luck held good: the track along the edge of the swamp was deserted.
  And at last they were clear of it, and able to increase their pace as they
  began to climb the hill.</p>

  <p>They reached the top: the lagoon below them was in darkness. No light came
  from the place where the boat had been anchored. And sick with anxiety they
  half ran, half slid down towards the beach. The dinghy was still where they
  had left her, and it was while they were getting her afloat that a large
  stone came bounding down the hill and crashed into the water a few yards
  away.</p>

  <p>For a moment Jim paused, staring up at the sky line behind them. Was it
  they who had loosened it as they came down, or had something else started it?
  But he could see nothing, and jumping into the dinghy they pulled feverishly
  for the boat.</p>

  <p>"Bill," he shouted. "Ahoy! there, Bill."</p>

  <p>There was no answer, and leaving Percy to make the dinghy fast, he
  scrambled on board.</p>

  <p>"Bill," he cried again. "Judy. Where are you?"</p>

  <p>He dashed into the little saloon, and this time there was an answer.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, my dear Mr. Maitland," came a well-known voice. "You are,
  if I may say so, a little later than I expected."</p>

  <p>He lit the lamp: seated at the table was the dwarf with a malignant smile
  on his lips.</p>

  <p>"You little devil," roared Jim. "What have you done with Miss
  Draycott?"</p>

  <p>The blind man held up a deprecating hand.</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Maitland," he protested, "the space here is very confined.
  Would it be too much if I asked you to moderate your voice?"</p>

  <p>"Where is Miss Draycott, Dresler?" said Jim controlling himself with an
  immense effort. "Because I warn you quite quietly that I am not in a mood to
  be trifled with to-night, and if anything has happened to her I shall blow
  out your brains without the smallest compunction."</p>

  <p>"It is extraordinary," remarked the other, "with what unerring accuracy I
  have read your character. I actually said to Monty&mdash;you remember Sir
  Montague Barnet, of course&mdash;when he went ashore that I was sure you
  would say something bright and original like that."</p>

  <p>Jim glanced at Percy who had come into the saloon.</p>

  <p>"So Barnet went ashore, did he? From here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I thought perhaps you might meet him, but in the darkness you must
  have missed one another. However he is sure to be back soon."</p>

  <p>"May I ask if he was wearing a Homburg hat?"</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, you know my affliction. I'm afraid I didn't ask him. But if
  you saw a man with a Homburg hat it must have been Monty."</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said Jim tersely. "I only saw the hat."</p>

  <p>"You speak in riddles," murmured the dwarf.</p>

  <p>"You'll get the solution soon," remarked Jim. "To return to Miss Draycott.
  I assume she is on board the yacht."</p>

  <p>"Correct. And with her is the admirable guardian you left whose name I
  fear I do not know. He was most abusive, and had to be hit over the head with
  a belaying-pin, but I don't think his condition is dangerous."</p>

  <p>"And your object in this abduction?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, you pain me. You know as well as I do. Now where is the
  correct map?"</p>

  <p>"In my pocket," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Excellent. By the way I congratulate you on the idea, Mr. Maitland. It
  appealed to me immensely when I gathered from Monty's blasphemy what had
  happened."</p>

  <p>"Cut it out," remarked Jim curtly. "I assume that you want it."</p>

  <p>"That is the notion. And fearing you might prove difficult about it, I
  took the precaution of removing the lady. She is quite safe at present, and
  her quarters are far more comfortable. But I do not need to remind you, do I,
  that my friend Don Miguel has a keen eye for a pretty girl, and that his
  reputation is not perhaps all that it should be. And so I earnestly advise
  you not to play any more tricks this time, either over the map, or with me.
  Because if you do I cannot guarantee Miss Draycott's continued safety."</p>

  <p>"And what is your proposal?" said Jim.</p>

  <p>"A simple one. As soon as Monty returns, you will start up the motor and
  take your boat round to the other side of the island where the yacht is now
  anchored. We will all go on board her, and then when you have satisfied us
  that the map is what we want&mdash;well, my dear Maitland, as far as I am
  concerned you can go to the devil."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," said Jim with a laugh. "Extraordinary what bloomers
  you always seem to make in your schemes Dresler, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" remarked the blind man softly.</p>

  <p>"I mean that if we wait here till Barnet returns we shall wait a
  considerable time. It was very unwise of him to go ashore alone."</p>

  <p>"Have you killed him?" said the dwarf even more softly.</p>

  <p>"No: but he's dead. This island is a funny place, my friend, and if you
  take my advice you'll do what I'm going to do&mdash;leave it."</p>

  <p>"How did Barnet die?"</p>

  <p>"His brains were bashed out against a tree, if you want to know."</p>

  <p>"Who by?"</p>

  <p>"I think <i>what</i> by would be a better way of putting it."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you," snarled the other. "You murdered him because he'd
  found the treasure. He told me he thought he might be able to."</p>

  <p>"With the map he'd got?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You may be clever, Mr. Maitland, but other people aren't fools.
  You'd altered the position of the hill and the tree, but the writing at the
  bottom remained."</p>

  <p>"Except for the little bit that was missing in the left-hand corner," said
  Jim.</p>

  <p>"That either had to be east or west," sneered the dwarf.</p>

  <p>"It was west to be exact. I found it that night we had our little chat in
  your house at Hampstead. I fear Barnet may have thought it was east: that
  might account for us finding his hat where we did."</p>

  <p>"His hat! Where was Barnet himself?"</p>

  <p>"His body had evidently been flung into the bog. There was no trace of
  it."</p>

  <p>"A likely story, Mr. Maitland. You tell me that a man of Barnet's size and
  weight had his brains bashed out against a tree and expect me to believe
  it!"</p>

  <p>"It's a matter of complete indifference to me whether you believe it or
  whether you don't," drawled Jim. "I'm sorry the poor devil met the end he
  did, but he wasn't a gentleman whose habits I liked, and I'm not going into
  mourning for him."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure about that," said the other thickly. "I would point out
  that there are some forty of us against you two. And justice can be
  summary."</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest making Percy and me walk the plank," laughed Jim. "Come,
  come, Dresler&mdash;I don't think the old brain is working very well. Do you
  seriously imagine that I am going to barge straight into the lion's den, and
  deliver myself bound hand and foot to a bunch of damned stiffs like you?"</p>

  <p>"And if you don't what about Miss Draycott?"</p>

  <p>"Go a little further, my friend: what about you? You seem to forget that
  it is fifty-fifty. Until Miss Draycott and Bill Blackett are delivered over
  to me safe and sound, you stay on board here. You can't catch me in a row
  boat, and if your pal Don Miguel tries any monkey tricks like ramming me with
  the yacht I'll hang you over the side to act as a fender."</p>

  <p>For a while the dwarf was silent: then he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why we should lose our tempers, Mr. Maitland, is
  there? I feel sure that matters can be settled amicably."</p>

  <p>"Then go on feeling sure," remarked Jim. "It may help. But all I'm sure
  about is that if a hair of Miss Draycott's head has been injured you'll pray
  for death before I'm through with you. And you'd better make them understand
  the fact on board the yacht, when we get there to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"Why to-morrow morning? Why not to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Your second error, Dresler. The passage through the reef here is bad
  enough even when it's light. To do it in the darkness would be literally
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"You know best," said the dwarf uneasily. "I would have preferred to reach
  the yacht to-night."</p>

  <p>Jim stared at him grimly.</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose that I want to remain here, do you, you rotten little
  sweep? But when I say it is impossible, I mean it's impossible. There would
  not be one chance in a thousand of our getting through without stoving in our
  bottom. And though I have not the slightest objection to your drowning, I
  have the very gravest to losing the boat and being compelled to leave Miss
  Draycott on board the yacht."</p>

  <p>Once again the dwarf shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Very good, Mr. Maitland. As I said before, you know best. Might I ask
  what the time is now?"</p>

  <p>"Ten o'clock," said Jim curtly. "Eight hours before we can start."</p>

  <p>He began pacing up and down the tiny saloon, his mind on the rack with
  anxiety. The thought of Judy alone in the yacht, with Bill possibly still
  unconscious, drove him almost insane. But there was nothing to be done: to
  attempt to navigate the entrance would be the act of a madman. For a while he
  even thought of the possibility of trying to make his way on foot over the
  island, but even if he succeeded there would be no way of getting on board
  the yacht save by swimming. And the chances of a swimmer in those shark
  infested waters were negligible. As far as he himself was concerned he would
  have been prepared to risk it, but the vital consideration was Judy. And if
  anything happened to him what was going to become of her?</p>

  <p>"Well since there is all that time before us," remarked the dwarf cutting
  into his thoughts, "it might be interesting to exchange views on the matter
  that has brought us both here. Have you had any luck in locating this
  hypothetical treasure, Mr. Maitland?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," said Jim tersely. "The only luck that my cousin and I have
  had to-day is getting off the island alive!"</p>

  <p>"Are you really serious?" said the other with an incredulous smile.</p>

  <p>"I have already told you what happened to Barnet," answered Jim. "And as
  you yourself remarked he was a big heavy man."</p>

  <p>The smile became more incredulous.</p>

  <p>"I quite appreciate, of course, your natural wish to keep the pitch for
  yourself," said the dwarf gently. "But I fear you will have to get a rather
  better one than that, Mr. Maitland."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Dresler," remarked Jim wearily, "I'm getting a little tired of
  you. What do you imagine can be my object in telling a lie over a thing that
  can easily be proved or disproved? Anyway you can now go along to Blackett's
  cabin, and I'll pull you out in the morning. I want a respite from your face.
  Show him the way, Percy."</p>

  <p>The dwarf got down off his chair, and stood for a moment or two in the
  centre of the saloon. Jim was rummaging in a cupboard for the whisky: Percy
  was lighting a cigarette. And so there was no one to notice a head that
  suddenly appeared in the fan-light, with a pair of bestial eyes fixed on the
  short misshapen figure of the blind man. Amazement followed incredulity in
  their expression: gloating anticipation followed amazement. Then as Jim
  straightened up the head was abruptly withdrawn.</p>

  <p>"Good night," said the dwarf as Percy took him by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Between half-past five and six," grunted Jim.</p>

  <p>"I shall be ready," remarked the other.</p>

  <p>"It's the devil, Percy," said Jim when his cousin returned. "I tried to
  bluff it out in front of that little swine, but they've got six to four the
  better of us. And anyone who is not bughouse can see they have."</p>

  <p>"You don't think they'll hurt Judy, do you?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Jim thoughtfully. "At any rate not to-night. Their only idea is
  to get the correct map. And they're not going to do anything which would
  jeopardise their chances of obtaining it. But the fact remains that we shall
  have to give it to them. We must get Judy off that yacht, and they won't let
  her come without it. It's a pity, but it can't be helped."</p>

  <p>"You meant to come back here?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I did. Once we'd got Judy safe in Rio, we could have fitted out
  a properly armed expedition. And even if we'd found no treasure we should
  have had a lot of fun. But now that swab Miguel will know as much as we do.
  He may or may not decide to carry on now, when he finds the island is not
  uninhabited. And if he doesn't the same idea will strike him&mdash;go back
  and refit. Which is where he will score. He's got a yacht ready to hand: we
  haven't."</p>

  <p>He rose and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"Ah! well. Absolutely nothing matters beyond getting Judy safely out of
  it. Hullo! what the devil do you want?"</p>

  <p>He swung round and stared at the dwarf who was standing in the entrance
  white faced and shaking.</p>

  <p>"Was it either of you," he quavered, "who passed his hand over my
  face?"</p>

  <p>"It was not. What happened?"</p>

  <p>"A hand&mdash;a huge hairy hand&mdash;touched me. I could feel the fingers
  pressing on me gently."</p>

  <p>"Stay here," snapped Jim. "Percy, get your gun, and come with me."</p>

  <p>He picked up his own revolver, and started along the corridor out of which
  the cabins led.</p>

  <p>"Is there a light inside?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"No," said Percy. "I didn't bother as he's blind."</p>

  <p>"Go back and get my electric torch. It's in the small locker." And
  suddenly his voice rose to a shout. "God! look at that."</p>

  <p>They had left the dwarf standing in the centre of the saloon. He was still
  there, but just above his head were two great brown hands, that, even as they
  watched, shot down and clutched him by the throat. Then, before their eyes,
  he was drawn up, screaming like a pig, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two they stood motionless, rooted to the spot: then
  simultaneously they dashed back into the saloon. The fan-light was wide open:
  he had been lifted through it. They could still hear him screaming, but as
  they darted up on deck there came a heavy splash, and silence.</p>

  <p>"The dinghy," roared Jim. "Pull it alongside, while I get the rifle."</p>

  <p>They jumped into the little boat, and rowed feverishly for the shore. And
  having beached her they stood listening. Not a sound could they hear, save
  the monotonous roar of the breakers on the reef. And then from some way off
  the piteous shrieks of the dwarf began again. They raced along the beach, but
  the cries grew fainter and fainter. Some stones came rattling down beside
  them: the thing was climbing the hill. And after a while silence settled once
  again.</p>

  <p>They made their way slowly back to the dinghy: any idea of pursuit was
  impossible. By day Jim would not have hesitated to fire, trusting to his
  marvellous eye not to hit Dresler. But in the darkness he was helpless.</p>

  <p>"This is getting beyond a joke," he said quietly, as they rowed back. "Not
  that I care a damn what happens to that little brute, but it's going to make
  it the devil for us."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" cried his cousin.</p>

  <p>"He was our guarantee for Judy. And now to-morrow morning we've got to
  tackle the yacht with neither him nor Barnet. Of course they won't believe
  us. Damn it! Percy, I wouldn't believe it myself if I hadn't seen it with my
  own eyes."</p>

  <p>They tied up the boat, and went on board. And at that moment the moon rose
  from behind the hill. Silhouetted on the sky line was an enormous figure, and
  instinctively Jim threw up his rifle. Then he lowered it again.</p>

  <p>"Too long a range," he said regretfully. "But look at the size of the
  thing."</p>

  <p>A bellowing roar of defiance, twice repeated, came across the water: then
  the sky line was clear once more.</p>

  <p>"I hold no brief for Dresler," he went on gravely, "but he's going to pay
  for his sins this night. Look at the marks of the brute on the deck."</p>

  <p>In the brilliant light of the tropical moon the wet footprints showed up
  clearly: marks just like those they had seen in the mud that afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Probably the same one that took the wretched Lopez," muttered Jim. "Gad!
  Percy, I'll be glad to get Judy out of this."</p>

  <p>"Why don't we push off now?" said his cousin. "This light is almost as
  bright as day."</p>

  <p>"You're right, old lad. We will. I'd forgotten about the moon when I said
  to-morrow morning. Go and get the engines started."</p>

  <p>Percy went below, and Jim sat down on a coil of rope thinking. How to get
  Judy off the yacht&mdash;that was the problem. He had no idea which her cabin
  would be, and even if he could find out it would be impossible to approach
  the yacht unseen in the moonlight. There was certain to be some form of watch
  kept, however slack discipline might be. And then there was Bill too: it was
  out of the question to leave him behind. Still it was a good idea to go now:
  anything was better than this enforced idleness. And he would feel easier in
  his mind if he was on board the yacht himself.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the opening in the rocks with anxious eyes. If only Bill had
  been still with them it would have made it so much easier. They wanted
  someone in the bows badly, to help con the boat.</p>

  <p>"All ready when you are," shouted Percy, and he rose to his feet. The
  sooner they were through the better, and if they were going to pile up there
  was no good putting it off. But their luck was in. Twice did a wet jagged
  pinnacle of rock show out of the swell within a foot of them: once quite
  distinctly they felt her graze. And then came Jim's cheerful shout of "Full
  speed ahead"; they were through, and steering for the open sea.</p>

  <p>"What did you make of that thing, Jim?" said his cousin, joining him at
  the wheel. "Have you ever seen anything like it before?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," answered the other thoughtfully. "But we've seen what
  happened to Lopez. And there is no doubt at all in my mind that he never went
  ashore of his own free will. They got him just as they got Dresler. Which
  shows pretty conclusively that they do not remain merely on the defensive,
  but are prepared to be the aggressors. Incredible though it may seem, Percy,
  my own belief is that very few people have ever got away from this
  island&mdash;that what Bill told us was true. And it's that, far more than
  any harm Judy may come to from Don Miguel, that is making me so desperately
  uneasy."</p>

  <p>"You think they may attack the yacht?"</p>

  <p>"I think it is a certainty. But my hope is that they may wait till a party
  goes ashore, as they did in the case of the <i>Paquinetta</i>. They evidently
  possess a certain low cunning, and then they may hesitate to board the yacht
  when she is fully manned. In which case it will be to-morrow night, because
  they won't land anyone till they've got the map. That's what I'm banking
  on."</p>

  <p>He paused abruptly, staring ahead. They were steering parallel with the
  edge of the swamp, over which the mist now lay like a blanket of cotton
  wool.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he cried. "My God! there's another. Race her, Percy: take the
  bottom out of her. There is firing going on in front of us."</p>

  <p>His cousin sprang below, and the next moment the boat was quivering from
  bow to stern like a mad thing. But even above the sound of the engine came
  the ominous crack, crack, of firearms, followed after a time by an even more
  ominous silence. And sick with anxiety Jim stood at the wheel staring over
  the glittering silver water ahead. Did that abrupt cessation of firing mean
  that the things had been repulsed, or did it mean...? Not even to himself
  could he complete the alternative.</p>

  <p>They rounded the point, and saw the yacht lying at anchor a mile away.
  Lights were shining through some of the portholes, but they could see no sign
  of any movement, though in the moonlight the deck and bridge were clearly
  visible. She was about a quarter of a mile from the shore, and the first
  thing they noticed as they drew alongside was that the steps of the gangway
  were sopping wet.</p>

  <p>They made fast, and dashed up on deck. And the sight that confronted them
  was so incredible that for a moment or two they stood there unable to move.
  The yacht was a shambles. Just in front of them lay Bully McIntyre, a
  blood-spattered crowbar still gripped in his hands. His head was bent back,
  and round his throat were great red weals. His neck had been broken from
  behind. Others of the crew lay about with their heads battered in: the sickly
  smell of blood was everywhere. It was a ghastly scene in the cold white light
  at any time, but one that was calculated to make them numb with horror when
  they thought of Judy.</p>

  <p>They rushed below; all the cabins were open. And inside the first one they
  entered they came on what was left of Don Miguel. But it was not on the
  crushed remnants that Jim's eyes were fixed, but on the chair that stood by
  the bed. On it lay a little revolver, and he picked it up.</p>

  <p>"Judy's," he muttered hoarsely. "The one I gave her. Oh! my God."</p>

  <p>"Jim: come here."</p>

  <p>A hoarse shaking voice which he dimly recognised as Percy's came from
  outside, and like a man walking in his sleep he joined him in the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>"Look at that."</p>

  <p>The door of the next cabin had been splintered to match wood, and on the
  bed lay Judy's hat. For a while they stood looking at it, not daring to meet
  one another's eyes. The situation was beyond speech: beyond thought. Judy was
  in the hands of these monstrous horrors, without even a revolver to protect
  herself with.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do, Jim: what can we do?"</p>

  <p>"Do," answered the other tensely, "do. Go after her, of course. And if
  there's no other way out&mdash;shoot her. But there's going to be another way
  out, Percy."</p>

  <p>His voice rose to a savage shout. "We'll beat the brutes yet."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">JUDY DRAYCOTT bolted the door of her cabin in Don Miguel's
  yacht, and tried to think coherently. Her brain was whirling: the events of
  the last few hours seemed like some hideous nightmare. She had been asleep
  when Jim and Percy went ashore, and had only awakened two hours afterwards to
  find Bill Blackett mounting guard and looking worried.</p>

  <p>"Where are the others?" she asked and he told her.</p>

  <p>"Madness, miss," he remarked gloomily, "but there's no use arguing with
  Mr. Maitland. And what makes it worse is that the dago's yacht has arrived.
  She passed some way out, and she hasn't seen us yet, but if she comes to look
  for us there's no way of hiding. And then we're between the devil and the
  deep sea."</p>

  <p>He scanned the side of the hill through his telescope, but nothing
  stirred.</p>

  <p>The afternoon dragged slowly on, and at four-thirty she went below to make
  some tea. To while away the time the sailor had been telling her some of
  Jim's exploits, but she noticed that he never let five minutes elapse without
  searching the hill with his glass. And when she returned with the cups he was
  pacing up and down the deck looking anxiously at the sun.</p>

  <p>"Another hour and a half, two hours at the most, and it'll be dark," he
  said. "Blast! here's the yacht."</p>

  <p>She turned round: steaming slowly round the headland came the boat whose
  graceful lines she had last seen in Rio harbour.</p>

  <p>"They've spotted us," said Bill, shutting up his telescope. "Now what are
  they going to do?"</p>

  <p>They were not left long in doubt: having arrived opposite the opening in
  the rocks the yacht's engines stopped, and she remained there rolling lazily
  in the swell while a boat was lowered.</p>

  <p>"Eight of 'em," muttered Bill. "That dwarf I've heard you talk about is
  one of them, and a great red-faced fellow who looks English."</p>

  <p>The boat was being rowed towards them rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Don't let them come on board, Bill," cried Judy.</p>

  <p>"How can I stop 'em, Miss?" he said gravely. "I can't shoot the lot. Maybe
  they've only come to ask questions, and mean us no harm."</p>

  <p>"Is Maitland there?" sung out the red-faced man whom Judy at once
  recognised as Barnet, as the boat came alongside.</p>

  <p>"He is not," said Bill. "He's ashore. What are you wanting?"</p>

  <p>"You'll see soon enough," grunted the other. "Up you get, Emil."</p>

  <p>He helped the dwarf on board, and came up after him followed by four of
  the boat's crew.</p>

  <p>"We don't want the whole Brazilian navy on deck," cried Bill angrily.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter what you want. You'll damned well take what you get.
  Now then where's that map?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Maitland has got it on him."</p>

  <p>Barnet stared at him suspiciously, and whispered something to the dwarf
  who shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"When will he be back?"</p>

  <p>"I know no more than you do," answered Bill. "He went ashore three or four
  hours ago."</p>

  <p>And once again the two of them whispered together, evidently deciding to
  adopt a different line.</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Draycott," began the dwarf ingratiatingly, "I feel sure we
  shall be able to arrange matters amicably. I must say that I have the
  greatest admiration for the way you have scored off us up to date, but I feel
  certain that you will be the first to admit that matters cannot go on as they
  are any longer."</p>

  <p>"I prefer to have no discussion at all with men who were responsible for
  my brother's murder," said Judy passionately.</p>

  <p>"Come, come," said Dresler, "I can assure you that was an accident. No one
  regretted it more than Sir Montague Barnet and myself. Anyway it is over and
  done with: it belongs to the past, and we are concerned with the present. Now
  then, are we going to work together or not?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing would induce me to have anything to do with you," cried the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"But I fear you will have to," said the dwarf suavely. "I don't want to
  waste time pointing out obvious facts but we outnumber you by more than ten
  to one. And only my abhorrence of violence makes me discuss the matter at
  all. The position is this, Miss Draycott. Mr. Maitland has the map: we want
  the map. Moreover we intend to have the map. Now if you will give me your
  solemn promise that you will persuade Mr. Maitland to hand it over to us,
  then I, in my turn, will give you my promise that a fair share of the
  treasure, should we discover any, will be handed over to you."</p>

  <p>"And if I won't promise," said Judy.</p>

  <p>Once again the dwarf shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Need we go into such an eventuality," he said softly. "I will leave it to
  your imagination."</p>

  <p>"Then I will give you my answer, Mr. Dresler. Rather than see that map in
  your hands, I shall ask Mr. Maitland to tear it up and throw it in the sea.
  Oh! you brutes!"</p>

  <p>She gave a sudden cry, as the four men, obeying a quick gesture from
  Barnet, hurled themselves on Bill Blackett. For a few moments he fought like
  a demon, and one of his assailants went overboard with a broken jaw. But it
  could only end one way when Barnet, with a loaded stick in his hand joined in
  as well. There came a dull thud, and Bill crashed forward on the deck
  unconscious.</p>

  <p>"There's no good wasting time, Emil," grunted the baronet. "That fellow
  Maitland may be back at any moment. Put him in the boat."</p>

  <p>They lowered the motionless sailor into the boat alongside, and Barnet
  picked up his rifle.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miss Draycott," he said curtly, "will you kindly follow your friend
  or have we got to lift you in too."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with us?" said Judy.</p>

  <p>"Exchange your quarters for more comfortable ones on board the yacht.
  Emil, I'm going ashore: I will return with Maitland."</p>

  <p>And so having landed him she found herself being rowed to the yacht, with
  Bill still lying unconscious in the bottom of the boat. And though she tried
  not to notice it, a feeling of sick fear began to come over her as she saw
  the way the sailors looked at her. They were talking to one another in
  Brazilian and every now and then they laughed evilly, as if enjoying some
  secret joke. What a fool she had been to speak so precipitately: why hadn't
  she temporised till Jim got back? But when she stared at the hill, the only
  moving thing she could see was the figure of Barnet slowly climbing.</p>

  <p>An officer received her as she mounted the gangway, and she hated him even
  more than the sailors.</p>

  <p>"In ze regretted absence of Don Miguel," he leered in broken English, "it
  is to me much pleasure to receive you. Will you please to come: I show you ze
  saloon."</p>

  <p>She watched Bill being hoisted on board; then sick at heart she followed
  the officer.</p>

  <p>"It is pretty, is it not?" remarked her guide, and as she glanced
  indifferently round the room, he suddenly seized her in his arms and kissed
  her.</p>

  <p>It was just what Judy wanted to rouse her from her despondency. With a
  smack like the shot of a pistol she got him with her open hand on the cheek,
  and he staggered back snarling. Then muttering something in Brazilian he came
  towards her again, only to find himself looking down the wrong end of a small
  business-like automatic.</p>

  <p>"Another step, you little swine," said Judy, "and I'll kill you."</p>

  <p>For a moment they stared at one another: then with an ugly laugh he turned
  away.</p>

  <p>"You wait, you English mees," he remarked, "till Don Miguel come on board
  again. You have lovely time then."</p>

  <p>"Get out," cried Judy, and with another glance at the automatic, he
  went.</p>

  <p>After a time she relaxed, and going to one of the portholes looked out.
  The throb of the engine had already told her they were under way, and she saw
  they were going back to the south of the island. In the distance she could
  still see the motor-boat, with a squat figure of the dwarf on the deck: then
  the hill hid it from sight.</p>

  <p>No one else came to disturb her, and she remained at the porthole watching
  the island listlessly. Where were Jim and Percy? It was getting almost dark:
  even if they were in the open it would have been impossible to see them. And
  at last with a feeling of utter despair in her heart she sat down at the
  table in the centre of the saloon.</p>

  <p>After a while a steward came in and turned on the light, and at the same
  time the engine ceased. She rose and peered out again, as the rattle of the
  chain told her they had anchored, but it was too dark to see more than the
  bare outline of the land. They were lying close in, but beyond seeing that it
  was wooded she could make out nothing.</p>

  <p>The door opened, and she turned round. Two men were standing there: one
  she had never seen before, the other was Don Miguel.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, my dear young lady, to my yacht," said the millionaire. "And
  allow me to introduce Captain McIntyre."</p>

  <p>"How is Captain Blackett?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"As well as can be expected under the circumstances," he remarked. "I can
  assure you his life is in no danger. Did he prove intractable or what?"</p>

  <p>"He was the victim of an unprovoked assault," she said angrily.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" he laughed. "It's lucky for him that his head is hard. So I
  hear Mr. Maitland is carrying out a little private exploration. I wonder if
  he was more fortunate than we were. We rowed all the way up the river, and
  all the way back again and found nothing at all, except a pool containing
  crocodiles."</p>

  <p>He pressed the bell, and ordered a bottle of wine and some whisky.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, McIntyre," he said, "and help yourself. You will join us, Miss
  Draycott?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," she answered coldly.</p>

  <p>"A pity. This is an excellent vintage."</p>

  <p>His eyes were fixed on her gloatingly, and involuntarily she shivered.</p>

  <p>"Not cold, I trust. Or perhaps a touch of fever. May I get you some
  quinine?"</p>

  <p>"How long are we to be kept prisoners?" she burst out.</p>

  <p>"What an ugly word," said the Brazilian. "Let us put it that I hope you
  will enjoy my hospitality for a considerable period. Let us also hope that
  Mr. Maitland does nothing foolish with the map. It will prolong matters if he
  should, and this island is not a spot that I would select as a health
  resort."</p>

  <p>"It's a stinking fever-soaked hole," grunted McIntyre.</p>

  <p>"But doubtless our lady guest will enliven the tedium of it," murmured the
  other.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly show me where my cabin is?" she said icily, and Don
  Miguel again rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Show Miss Draycott to her cabin," he ordered as the steward entered. "The
  large one&mdash;next to mine."</p>

  <p>The man grinned and led the way. And in the last glimpse she had of the
  two men, they were shaking with silent laughter.</p>

  <p>She bolted the door, and sat down on the bed to try and get things
  straight in her mind. She was afraid, desperately afraid. And the more she
  thought about it, the more hopeless did it seem. Even if Jim gave them the
  map, what guarantee was there that they would be allowed to go? And he and
  Percy could do nothing with the numbers they had against them. Anyway as a
  last resource she had her revolver, and even as she comforted herself with
  that reflection she remembered that she had left her bag with it inside in
  the saloon.</p>

  <p>She went back at once: the two men were sitting where she had left them.
  Her bag was still on the table, but the instant she picked it up she realised
  by the weight that the revolver was no longer inside. She looked at the
  Brazilian: he was balancing it in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Give my revolver back to me," she cried furiously. "How dare you touch my
  bag."</p>

  <p>"Just to see that no dangerous lethal weapons were being carried, my dear
  young lady," he grinned. "You've no idea what a lot of damage one of these
  little toys can do. Captain McIntyre was terribly nervous when he saw
  it."</p>

  <p>"Sure," said the sailor with mock gravity. "I told the boss I wouldn't be
  able to sleep a wink if I knew anyone on board had a gun."</p>

  <p>"You cowardly brutes."</p>

  <p>She faced them defiantly, though in truth she felt very near tears.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't dare do a thing like that if Mr. Maitland was here."</p>

  <p>"But since he isn't here the point does not arise, does it," said Don
  Miguel softly. "And since it is more than doubtful if he ever will be here
  the point will never arise either."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" She stared at him with dilated eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have my own methods of dealing with people who try to double cross me,"
  remarked the Brazilian. "I warned Mr. Maitland in Rio, and he decided not to
  heed my warning. I fear he may regret it."</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed as he looked at her.</p>

  <p>"Whereas you, my pretty one, will I trust have no cause to regret your
  visit to South America."</p>

  <p>She fought down the sick fear that was gripping her.</p>

  <p>"If you do anything to Mr. Maitland," she said, "you won't get the
  map."</p>

  <p>"In which case our stay here is likely to be much more prolonged," he
  remarked. "But with you on board to comfort me I shall view the prospect with
  equanimity."</p>

  <p>He rose suddenly and came towards her, and she cowered back. There was
  something so utterly repulsive about this swarthy looking brute that she felt
  almost hypnotised with loathing. And the next moment he had caught her in his
  arms.</p>

  <p>"Jewels shall be yours, my pretty," he whispered thickly, "and money. You
  shall have all your desires granted."</p>

  <p>His face was coming closer to hers, until, making a desperate effort, she
  broke away from him and fled like a wild thing to her cabin. And not till the
  door was bolted once more did she feel safe.</p>

  <p>She sat down panting for breath. What was she going to do? It was only a
  temporary respite: sooner or later she would have to eat and drink. And that
  would mean meeting Miguel again. What, too, about Jim? They intended
  treachery: the Brazilian had admitted it himself. They would get the map by
  means of specious promises, and then knife him or something from behind.</p>

  <p>A knock came on the door, and the steward enquired what she would like for
  dinner.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she cried, "nothing at all," and the man went away. Eating was
  a physical impossibility, but after a while she rose and gulped down some
  water from the carafe. It was luke warm but she felt better for it. And for a
  time she stood staring out of the porthole.</p>

  <p>Nine o'clock: surely Jim should be there by now. But no sound broke the
  stillness of the night except a gramophone which was being played by some
  member of the crew. And as the hours went on her anxiety increased. Why
  didn't he come? Had some accident happened to him on the island which had
  prevented him?</p>

  <p>The gramophone ceased: the yacht grew silent. Once her door handle was
  softly tried, and Don Miguel's voice came from the other side. But she did
  not answer him, and after a while he went away and she heard the door of the
  next cabin shut. And at length, still sitting in the chair she fell into an
  uneasy doze.</p>

  <p>A sudden sound awakened her, and she sat up with a start. The moonlight
  was flooding her cabin, and for a moment or two she sat trembling in her
  chair. And then to her horror she saw a slowly widening crack in the
  partition wall of the cabin. A panel was sliding back, and it had been the
  click as it started that had aroused her.</p>

  <p>She watched it with dilated eyes: on the other side of it was Don Miguel's
  cabin. And at length his head was poked cautiously through. He looked round
  until he saw her, and for a while they stared at one another in silence. Then
  with a leer he pushed the panel right back, and stood in the opening.</p>

  <p>"Have you changed your mind, my pretty," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Get out, you unspeakable cur," she said tensely.</p>

  <p>"But I've only just come," he remarked. "Wasn't it thoughtful of me to
  give you the cabin next mine? All specially prepared as you see. Now are we
  going to be wise, or are we going to give trouble?"</p>

  <p>The leer grew more pronounced, and he took a step forward. And at that
  moment she heard him give a strange gurgling noise: saw something brown round
  his throat, and watched him being dragged back through the opening. He
  disappeared, and with no thought in her mind save the incredible fact that
  he'd gone, she sprang to the sliding panel and slammed it to. And as she did
  so there came from the other side of the wall a blood-curdling scream,
  followed by a series of bumps as if a heavy sack was being thrown about.</p>

  <p>She cowered back terrified: the noise was like nothing she had ever heard.
  And even as she listened to it pandemonium broke loose in the ship. Shots,
  oaths, yells of terror came from every direction, and every now and then a
  loud splash indicated that somebody had fallen overboard. She forced herself
  to go to the porthole, but there was nothing to be seen though the din had
  now become indescribable. And mingled with it came a succession of strange
  snarling grunts.</p>

  <p>She crossed to the little window that opened into the corridor, and drew
  back the curtains. Pressed against the glass was a face, and as she stared at
  it every drop of blood seemed to freeze in her veins. It was human, and yet
  it was animal. Its teeth were bared like those of an angry dog: its flattened
  nostrils were distended. And in its eyes was a look of bestial savagery.</p>

  <p>Suddenly it put its hand straight through the glass, and tried to clutch
  her, but she fell back half fainting on the bed. For a while the great hairy
  arm continued groping: then it was withdrawn, and she could hear it snarling
  angrily, evidently furious at having cut itself. And then to her unspeakable
  horror the door handle rattled violently. The thing was trying to get in.</p>

  <p>The door creaked and groaned: she could see the panels bulging inwards.
  And in those few moments Judy experienced the supreme acme of human terror.
  <i>For she knew the door handle would not hold.</i> Already the wood was
  beginning to splinter, and in one last desperate throw for safety she tried
  to clamber through the porthole. But it was too small, and with a pitiful
  little moan she cowered back on the bed just as the door, with a final crash,
  was burst open, and the thing came in. And it was then that something snapped
  in her brain, and Judy fainted.</p>

  <p>When she opened her eyes again she found herself in darkness. She was
  lying on the ground, and for a while her mind refused to act. Then little by
  little it came back to her, and she bit her lip to prevent herself screaming.
  It wasn't some hideous nightmare: it was the truth. Something had come into
  her cabin, something that she dimly remembered as being of vast size, and
  unspeakably horrible. And it must have carried her off the yacht.</p>

  <p>Where was she? She felt the ground with her hand and found it was hard
  earth. And suddenly the full horror of her position dawned on her: she was in
  the power of these awful creatures. From close beside her there came a
  movement, and involuntarily she gave a little cry. And then with a feeling of
  unutterable relief she heard a well-known voice.</p>

  <p>"How are you feeling, miss?"</p>

  <p>"Bill," she cried, "where are we? What's happened?"</p>

  <p>"The same as happened in the <i>Paquinetta</i>," he answered grimly.
  "They've slaughtered or taken prisoner every soul in the yacht, and now we're
  in their power."</p>

  <p>Some voices started jabbering Brazilian near by, and she asked Bill who
  they were.</p>

  <p>"Some of the crew, miss. There are about ten of us altogether. The rest
  are dead."</p>

  <p>"Thank God, they didn't kill you, Bill."</p>

  <p>"It was that crack on the head in the motor-boat saved me, miss. I'd come
  to, and was lying dazed and sick in the bunk where they'd thrown me, when I
  heard the fight start. So I staggered up on deck unarmed as I was and ran
  right into two of them. It was so unexpected I didn't show any fight, and
  they just carted me off."</p>

  <p>She forced herself to ask the question, though she dreaded the answer.</p>

  <p>"Have they got Mr. Maitland too?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him, miss, or his cousin either."</p>

  <p>"He may be able to do something," she said, hope springing up in her
  mind.</p>

  <p>The sailor said nothing. In the first place he doubted if Jim could ever
  find them, and if he did what could he possibly do? There were scores of
  these hideous monsters, and even if he succeeded in shooting a few of them,
  it would only make the others more savage.</p>

  <p>"By the way, miss," he said at length, "have you got your revolver with
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't, Bill," she answered. "That brute Don Miguel took it from
  me."</p>

  <p>And the sailor almost groaned aloud. No good now alarming her more than
  she was already, by telling her to blow out her brains in certain
  eventualities: they could only wait in agonising suspense.</p>

  <p>"What will they do to us, Bill?" she asked tremulously.</p>

  <p>"God knows, miss," he said gravely. "We've just got to keep our spirits up
  and hope for the best."</p>

  <p>"But, Bill, are they human?"</p>

  <p>"Half man, half beast, miss. You remember I told you. They've got a sort
  of language for I heard them talking, but to look at they're more like
  gorillas."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she said quietly, "they'll kill us."</p>

  <p>And he dared make no reply. All that he could pray for was that they would
  kill her and that nothing worse should happen. He was unarmed himself: he was
  powerless to help her in any way. And the realisation of the girl's peril
  made him well-nigh sick with fear. He had tried to take note of the direction
  in which he had been brought, but it had proved hopeless. It had seemed a
  veritable maze of paths, and since for long stretches of the journey the
  moonlight had not penetrated into the forest, most of it had been done in
  darkness. All that he knew was that they were in some form of underground
  cave.</p>

  <p>Two of the sailors near by were talking, and he understood sufficient
  Brazilian to get the gist of their remarks.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear what those blokes are saying, miss," he said, when they had
  finished. "According to them some of the words these things use are a sort of
  Brazilian <i>patois</i>. And from what they heard the reason for the attack
  on the yacht was that their chief or king or something like that was killed
  this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't seem to help us much, does it?" she said with a pitiful little
  laugh. "Bill, wouldn't it be possible to escape? There must be a way
  out."</p>

  <p>"First thing I thought of, miss. But the brutes have blocked the entrance
  of the tunnel we came in by."</p>

  <p>"So that our only hope is Jim," she whispered under her breath.</p>

  <p>They fell silent: and Judy's thoughts went back to that night in Hampstead
  when she had first met Jim and asked his advice about the treasure. Who, by
  the wildest stretch of imagination could have dreamed that it would have
  ended as it had? It was all so inconceivable that even now she had a feeling
  that she would wake up soon and find it was some fantastic nightmare. And
  suddenly she cried out almost hysterically.</p>

  <p>"It can't be true, Bill. It is just like Alice in <i>Alice in
  Wonderland</i>. We'll find it's all a dream and these things are just a pack
  of cards."</p>

  <p>And the sailor who had come on deck just in time to see Bully McIntyre's
  neck broken with a flick of the wrists could think of nothing to say. In fact
  he found himself praying that her reason might give: then at any rate she
  would be spared the mental horror that lay in front of her.</p>

  <p>For the twentieth time he asked himself what was going to happen. How long
  were they going to be kept in this underground hole, and what was their fate
  going to be when they were taken out? Presumably the brutes were asleep
  resting after the fight: in which case it might be many hours before they
  knew.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the silence was broken by the most extraordinary uproar from
  above them. The bell began clanging furiously: a chorus of bellowing grunts
  that increased in intensity as more and more of the brutes joined in almost
  drowned it. The ground over their heads shook violently: they could hear the
  lumbering footsteps passing backwards and forwards.</p>

  <p>Gradually the clamour died away and the bell ceased, though a kind of deep
  chattering which still continued showed that their captors were very wide
  awake. It sounded as if something had excited them greatly, something which
  they were now discussing at length. And then clear above everything came an
  anguished cry.</p>

  <p>"Help! For God's sake&mdash;help!"</p>

  <p>Bill Blackett sat up with a jerk.</p>

  <p>"That's not Mr. Maitland," he said positively, "though I know the
  voice."</p>

  <p>"It was the dwarf," cried the girl. "I'd know his voice anywhere."</p>

  <p>"The dwarf," said the sailor slowly. "And he was blind. That means they've
  been on board our motor-boat."</p>

  <p>"And it means," said the girl excitedly, "that they haven't got Jim or
  Percy. He was left there alone."</p>

  <p>Bill Blackett said nothing. Did it mean that of necessity? Or did it mean
  that Jim and his cousin had put up a fight and been killed, and that the
  dwarf being helpless had merely been captured?</p>

  <p>The excitement above continued, though it was more controlled. One of the
  monsters seemed to be holding forth to the others, and when he'd finished his
  audience emitted a series of bellows that seemed to betoken approval. And
  almost immediately after there came, from the entrance to their prison, the
  sound of the barrier being removed, and the soft padding of bare feet on the
  ground. One of the brutes was with them.</p>

  <p>They could hear its heavy breathing as it stumbled about, and suddenly
  there came a yell from one of the sailors&mdash;an Englishman.</p>

  <p>"It's got me," he screamed. "Save me, boys."</p>

  <p>His voice died away: the barrier crashed back, and Bill Blackett wiped the
  sweat from his forehead. One of them had been taken: whose turn was it going
  to be next? Impossible to help the poor devil: impossible to do anything
  except sit in the darkness and wait.</p>

  <p>Above them the noise had again increased, and mingled with it came the
  shouts of the dwarf and the sailor. And then once again the bell began
  tolling, whilst the rest of the uproar ceased abruptly.</p>

  <p>There was something almost solemn in the monotonous clanging: it sounded
  as if it might have been the accompaniment of some religious ceremony. It
  continued for about five minutes: then in the silence that followed one deep
  grunting voice could be heard. And suddenly one of the Brazilians near them
  cried out in horror and said something to one of his companions, something
  which once again Bill Blackett could understand roughly, and which caused him
  to stare into the darkness with haggard eyes. Sacrifice: human sacrifice to
  some god: that was what was going on above their heads.</p>

  <p>"Help me, you little swine. Don't sit there doing nothing."</p>

  <p>The voice of the sailor who had been taken came to them faintly, and Bill
  cursed under his breath. The poor devil was English anyhow, and it was
  intolerable to have to sit there helpless while he was being killed, perhaps
  tortured.</p>

  <p>"Help me. For God's sake, say something to these brutes."</p>

  <p>A frenzy of fear rang in the man's voice: evidently the end, whatever it
  was, was drawing near. And then it came.</p>

  <p>"One of them has got me. One of them has got me."</p>

  <p>The scream was almost inarticulate, and subsided into a meaningless babble
  of words which was drowned in the triumphant outburst of noise from the
  spectators. And after a while that too, subsided, and all was silent once
  more.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean, Bill," said Judy in a trembling voice.</p>

  <p>"It means, miss, that now we're one hand short," he answered quietly.</p>

  <p>"You mean he's dead."</p>

  <p>"That's it, miss, I'm afraid. They've killed him."</p>

  <p>"And that's what is going to happen to us," she went on steadily.</p>

  <p>"It looks like it, miss," he said.</p>

  <p>"How do you think they did it?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't an idea," he answered. "From what he called out he seemed to be
  appealing to that dwarf to help him."</p>

  <p>"He said, 'One of them has got me.' Oh! my God, Bill," her voice rose to a
  scream, "can't you strangle me now?"</p>

  <p>"Steady on, miss," said the sailor gently, though his heart was sick
  within him. "Don't let's give up hope yet. Maybe Mr. Maitland will find some
  way of escape for us."</p>

  <p>But his voice lacked conviction and he knew it.</p>

  <p>"Don't try and deceive me, Bill." With an effort she pulled herself
  together. "Things have gone too far for that. Do you think we've got a
  chance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he cried stoutly. "I do. Provided Mr. Maitland is still free."</p>

  <p>"And if he isn't?"</p>

  <p>"Then our number is up, miss."</p>

  <p>There was no good beating about the bush, he reflected: the girl was
  thoroughbred and had better know the truth.</p>

  <p>"That's what I wanted to find out," she said. "Now, Bill, we've neither of
  us got a revolver, so I want you to do something for me. These sailors have
  all got knives. Will you please borrow one?"</p>

  <p>"I have a knife myself, miss," he said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Good. Then if the end comes, Bill: if we have to give up hope will you
  give me your solemn word of honour that you will kill me."</p>

  <p>The sailor swallowed hard for a few moments, and then he answered her in a
  husky voice.</p>

  <p>"If there's no hope left, miss, I give you my word of honour that I will
  kill you."</p>

  <p>And with a little sigh of relief Judy Draycott stretched out her hand to
  him in the darkness. She knew he would not fail her.</p>

  <p>"Will it be long, Bill, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows, miss," he said, and even as he spoke there came the sound
  of the barrier being removed from the end of the tunnel, and a flickering
  light danced on the walls of their prison. One of the monsters carrying a
  torch which threw out great volumes of black smoke was coming towards them.
  Others were following, and the girl crept closer to him.</p>

  <p>"Now, Bill&mdash;now. Quick&mdash;you promised."</p>

  <p>He drew his clasp knife, and opened the big blade. The sweat was pouring
  off his forehead: his hand was shaking like that of a man with the ague. And
  he was just nerving himself for the supreme effort, when suddenly, clear and
  distinct there came a sound that made him pause. It was faint but
  unmistakable: it was the siren of the yacht. And who could be blowing it?</p>

  <p>The monsters paused: the prisoners dimly outlined in the smoky light sat
  up listening. Steadily it went on blaring: long, long, long: long, short,
  long. Over and over again, until the meaning dawned on Bill. The morse code:
  O.K. Someone was sending those two letters into the night; who could it be
  but Jim Maitland? And with almost a sob of relief he replaced his knife in
  his pocket. In view of that message there was still hope.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL around them the sailors were muttering excitedly. Even
  though they knew nothing of the existence of Jim Maitland, they realised that
  some human agency must be at work, and that therefore there was at any rate
  somebody who was not a prisoner.</p>

  <p>And the monsters themselves seemed to realize it too. The one in front who
  appeared to be the leader was conferring with two others, stopping every now
  and then to listen to the siren which still went on monotonously, whilst the
  smoke from the torches made Judy's eyes smart and caught her in the
  throat.</p>

  <p>At last they came to a decision, and the leader gave a gruff roar which
  was evidently an order. It was answered from the other side of the smoke, and
  the prisoners heard the sounds of hurried movements which quickly died away
  in the distance.</p>

  <p>"Some of the brutes have gone to investigate," muttered Bill to the girl.
  "I wonder what is going to happen now?"</p>

  <p>But what he wondered far more, though he did not say so, was how Jim,
  assuming it was him, was going to get from the yacht in time to be of any
  help. The sacrifice that had already taken place had not been a long
  affair.</p>

  <p>"Bill, they're coming nearer."</p>

  <p>The girl clutched his hand terrified, as the three torch bearers advanced
  into the centre of the circle of prisoners, their faces looking, if possible,
  more incredibly evil in the flickering yellow light. And then they knelt down
  in a row and remained motionless, their gleaming eyes fixed on the entrance
  of the tunnel. Something was coming along the passage towards them.</p>

  <p>Fascinated in spite of their terror the captives stared into the darkness.
  What new horror was going to reveal itself? At last they saw it, dimly
  outlined in the smoke, moving slowly forward a step at a time. It was another
  of the monsters and it was carrying something in its arms. Foot by foot it
  advanced, and then bending forward it deposited its burden on the floor, so
  that the light of the torches shone on it clearly. And even Bill Blackett
  gasped in amazement: the burden was nothing less than the blind dwarf.</p>

  <p>"Merciful Heavens! miss," he whispered, "they're worshipping him. They
  think he's some sort of god."</p>

  <p>Over and over again the three torch bearers prostrated themselves so that
  their foreheads touched the ground, whilst from the darkness behind there
  commenced a deep chanting noise which grew in volume till they were almost
  deafened. Then, abruptly, it ceased: the three torch bearers straightened up:
  silence reigned. The only sign of movement came from the dwarf whose head was
  turning from side to side in a frenzy of fear.</p>

  <p>Suddenly one of the monsters began what seemed to be an address. Sounds
  which were clearly meant to be words were strung together in sentences; and,
  whenever he paused, his companions, unseen in the smoke, answered with grunts
  of approval.</p>

  <p>To Bill the whole thing was complete gibberish: he could make neither head
  nor tail of what the brute was saying. Once or twice he caught a word that
  seemed to have a Spanish ring about it, but except for that it was merely a
  jumble of meaningless sounds, which, coupled with the stifling fumes from the
  torches tended to make him half conscious. He still held Judy's hand in his,
  and he knew by the pressure of her head on his shoulder and her heavy
  breathing that it was affecting her in the same way. All the better, he
  reflected stupidly: pray heaven she remained in that condition till Jim
  Maitland came&mdash;if he ever did.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly one of the sailors opposite burst into a wild torrent of
  Brazilian, to which Bill forced himself to listen. He only got the bare gist
  of it, but that was sufficient to make his mouth go dry, and tighten the grip
  of his arm round the girl's waist. Sacrifice&mdash;he'd guessed that already,
  but he had hoped for time. Now from what this man was screaming out, it was
  to be at once, unless... He listened intently: then he too began to
  shout.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you lily-livered swine," he roared furiously. "By God! if I
  could get at you I'd cut your throat."</p>

  <p>The monsters had ceased as if surprised at this unexpected interruption,
  and Bill scrambled to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Hi! you blind man," he cried, "I don't know your name, but you listen to
  me."</p>

  <p>The dwarf turned his agonised face in Bill's direction.</p>

  <p>"These things that have got us think you're a god. Do you get me? What you
  say goes. It's up to you to decide what is going to happen. Now there's a
  lady here&mdash;just a young slip of a girl. And somebody has got to be
  sacrificed to you. At once. Now we've got to gain time, do you see. There's a
  chance of our being rescued. And according to that spawn of Satan opposite
  what these monsters have been saying is that it's either got to be Miss
  Draycott or six of us. Now I'll be one of the six, but as there's a God above
  unless you say that you wish her spared, I'll get at you and kill you."</p>

  <p>"How can I say anything," quavered the dwarf, "I don't know how to speak
  to them."</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me," howled the Brazilian sailor in broken English. "I tell
  all right. I make understand. Why six of us&mdash;for one girl&mdash;you
  damned Englishman."</p>

  <p>And then breaking into Brazilian, a torrent of words came pouring from his
  mouth to which Bill could only listen impotently. The three torch bearers had
  turned their heads and were looking at him: the one that had carried in the
  dwarf seemed to be listening also.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Judy clutched Bill's arm.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she whispered tensely. "Didn't you hear something?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing except that damned dago," he answered. "What was it, miss?"</p>

  <p>"There: there: again." She was shaking with excitement. "Bill: it was a
  voice: it was Jim's voice."</p>

  <p>"Steady on, miss. Mr. Maitland can't have got here from the yacht
  yet."</p>

  <p>"I don't care: it was his voice. Oh! Listen, Bill: listen."</p>

  <p>The sailor craned his ears, and at that moment there came a momentary
  pause from the sailor opposite. And in that pause, quite distinctly from
  somewhere above their heads, there came a low voice:</p>

  <p>"Worship the dwarf."</p>

  <p>And the voice was the voice of Jim Maitland. Apparently the others had not
  heard it, and Bill turned to the girl, by this time as excited as she
  was.</p>

  <p>"You're right, miss," he muttered. "It's Mr. Maitland. Come on: let's do
  what he says."</p>

  <p>The Brazilian was off again, as Bill, taking Judy by the hand advanced
  into the circle of light. And then with the utmost solemnity they prostrated
  themselves on the ground in front of Dresler. The sailor, surprised by this
  new development ceased talking: the monsters watched in silence. And the
  dwarf, sensing that something strange was happening called out in a terrified
  voice.</p>

  <p>"What is it!" he cried. "Tell me for God's sake. I'm going mad."</p>

  <p>"Keep it going, miss," muttered Bill. "It's our only hope. Good Lord!
  what's happening now."</p>

  <p>There had come a sudden stir amongst the ape-men, and out of the corner of
  his eye Bill saw that a beam of light was flickering round the walls. They
  jibbered and chattered to themselves as they watched it: then with one accord
  they threw themselves on their faces. It was a message from their god. At
  times it shone on the clouds of smoke: then finding an opening it would
  pierce through them and light up one of the beast faces. But always it moved
  on until at length it rested on the sailor who had begun speaking again. And
  there it remained motionless, till his voice died away and he stood there
  staring upwards stupidly.</p>

  <p>There came a triumphant shout from one of the monsters, and the three
  torch bearers sprang on the Brazilian who screamed like a wounded hare. The
  one who had carried Dresler in seized the dwarf and pulled him up, and a few
  seconds later all the ape-men had gone. So had the Brazilian sailor. The
  prisoners were alone again in the darkness, with only the reeking fumes left
  by the torches to remind them of the incredible scene they had just
  witnessed.</p>

  <p>But to Judy everything was different: Jim was there. How he had reached
  them: what he was going to do next: how he had done what he had done she did
  not stop to ask. The mere fact that he was on the spot was good enough for
  her: somehow or other he was going to save them.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she realised Bill was speaking.</p>

  <p>"I can't make it out, miss," he was saying. "There must be a hole in the
  roof somewhere through which he shone an electric torch. And then he worked
  on the superstitions of these things. But how did he get here: how did he
  know where we were? And how is he going to escape them now?"</p>

  <p>From above was coming a repetition of the sounds of the former sacrifice:
  the Brazilian sailor was following in the steps of the Englishman. And Judy
  covered her ears with her hands in her endeavour not to hear the poor
  wretch's screams of terror. At last they ceased: the second victim had paid
  the penalty, and for a while there was silence.</p>

  <p>She had kept casting feverish glances in the direction of the passage,
  hoping against hope that the flicker of Jim's torch might suddenly appear, or
  that she might hear his voice close to her. But the darkness had remained
  unbroken, and the only voice she had heard had been that of the poor brute
  yelling above them.</p>

  <p>And now as the silence continued she began to try and get some order into
  the chaos of her mind. Bill was right of course: for some reason or other
  these horrible creatures regarded the blind dwarf as a god. And in him it
  seemed to her lay their best chance of safety. The trouble was that, not
  unnaturally he was more terrified than any of them. They, at any rate, could
  see what they were up against: whereas to him the situation must appear
  doubly awful. To be utterly helpless in their hands: to be picked up and
  carried by them would be enough to send him off his head. And if that
  happened&mdash;what then? He would be useless as far as helping any of them
  to escape was concerned.</p>

  <p>Time dragged on; still no sign of Jim. And after a while she began to lose
  heart. What could one man do, even a man like him, against a horde of these
  foul monsters. Strong though he was she realised that he would be like a
  child in the hands of one of them: what then could he hope to do against
  fifty? Had he just postponed the inevitable for a short time? Would it have
  been better if Bill had not shut up his knife?</p>

  <p>And then another ghastly thought struck her: supposing they had already
  got him. And killed him. Some of those yells might have come from Jim. And if
  that was so she realised that she didn't mind what happened to her.</p>

  <p>At length nature asserted herself and she began to doze. Around her all
  the others were fast asleep, except Bill who forced himself to keep awake on
  the chance of getting another message from Jim. And it was his sudden grip on
  her arm that awoke her, as much as the noise of a dull boom accompanied by a
  distinct earth tremor.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Bill?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Sounded to me like an explosion, miss," he answered. "And it came from a
  long way off. Seems to have woken the brutes again, too."</p>

  <p>Above them they could hear the ape-men moving about and talking to one
  another excitedly. And then from a great distance there came faintly a roar.
  It was caught up and repeated from closer at hand: then again from quite near
  by. A signal of warning was being communicated through the forest, and the
  effect on the monsters above was instantaneous. Pandemonium broke loose: the
  ground over their heads shook so much that lumps of earth were dislodged and
  fell on them.</p>

  <p>"Can't have been a big gun," said Bill thoughtfully. "There couldn't be a
  warship here, and if there was she wouldn't fire. Besides we'd have heard the
  shell burst."</p>

  <p>He struck a match and looked at his watch: two hours now before daylight.
  And he was just blowing it out when his eyes fell on a twisted piece of paper
  lying at his feet. He snatched it up, and opened it out: it was a note from
  Jim.</p>

  <p>"It's from Mr. Maitland, miss," he cried excitedly. "He must have dropped
  it through when he spoke to us that time. You read it while I light some more
  matches."</p>

  <p>With their heads together they pored over it.</p>

  <p>"Do not be alarmed whatever happens," it ran. "Obey me implicitly, and
  we'll do it yet. As a last resource I have a revolver. The crucial time will
  be after the explosion. Then keep your heads close together."</p>

  <p>"That's now, miss," muttered Bill. "And here come the brutes back
  again."</p>

  <p>The torch bearers were returning along the passage: the others came
  crowding behind them. And it was clear that they were in a furious passion.
  Angry, snarling grunts came from all sides and the prisoners cowered back
  against the walls. The dwarf instead of being placed reverently on the ground
  was thrown down with such force that he lay there half stunned: evidently his
  period of godhead was over. And the leader of the monsters, its face
  convulsed with bestial rage shambled round the circle peering at each victim
  in turn.</p>

  <p>Suddenly it paused, and a hush fell on them. Once again that mysterious
  circle of light was playing round on their upturned faces, and Judy clutched
  Bill's hand. Jim was there once more. The light danced here and there, until
  it finally centred on the dwarf where it remained steady. And with a bellow
  of rage one of the ape-men picked him up.</p>

  <p>Instantly the light began to move again, and the great brutes paused. What
  further victim did their god desire save this false imposter? Round the
  waiting circle the beam moved, lighting up each face in turn and then on to
  the next. And suddenly Bill remembered the letter.</p>

  <p>"Then keep your heads close together."</p>

  <p>He leaned over till his cheek touched Judy's.</p>

  <p>"Orders, miss," he whispered. "It's us this time, or I'm a Dutchman."</p>

  <p>He could feel her body quivering against his; the light was only two away.
  Once more it moved: and then again. Their two faces showed up clear in the
  beam, and the beam remained steady.</p>

  <p>An ape-man dashed at them: the light went out, and the monster paused.
  Once more it shone out, and from above them came the order "Get up." Bill
  helped her up, the light shining on their faces as they moved. And once more
  two of the monsters came at them. Instantly the light went out again, and the
  brutes halted, evidently puzzled. Their god clearly did not wish these two
  victims to be touched.</p>

  <p>"Move."</p>

  <p>Another laconic order, and with the light again illuminating their heads
  they walked towards the entrance tunnel. The ape-men thronged round them till
  Judy thought she was going to faint with horror. But they did not touch her,
  and with Bill's arm supporting her she stumbled along the narrow passage.</p>

  <p>The beam from above had ceased: only the flickering yellow light from the
  three torches showed the way. In front of her she could see the agonised face
  of the dwarf, as he was carried along by one of the monsters, and in spite of
  all he had done, she could not help feeling sorry for him. He could be no
  help to them now: he was just a fellow victim more helpless far than they
  were.</p>

  <p>At length they reached the open air, and she drew great gulps of it into
  her lungs until she felt steadier on her feet. Then still clinging to Bill's
  arm she peered round half hoping to see Jim. It was dark, but not with the
  overpowering blackness of the underground prison they had left. And as her
  eyes grew accustomed to it she realised they were standing in a big clearing.
  The shadowy forms of the ape-men were moving about: close by them stood two
  of the hideous monsters. And one of them suddenly put out its hand and
  touched her on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>She gave a little scream, and shrank closer to Bill. But the pressure
  continued and she found herself being forced forward, while the sailor kept
  close by her side. The clearing narrowed into a track, then widened out again
  into another open space. And the ape-man's grip tightened so that she stood
  still.</p>

  <p>The monsters were curiously silent: there was a feeling of tension in the
  air. By the light of the torches she could see their eyes shining as they
  crouched in a semi-circle round her. In front of her stood the one carrying
  the dwarf, and at its feet there gleamed a streak of something on the ground.
  Water: the smoky flames were reflected in it as by a mirror. And beyond the
  water&mdash;nothing.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a sound that was half a gasp ran round the motionless watchers,
  and Bill clutched her arm. The darkness beyond the water was becoming faintly
  luminous. The monster holding the dwarf put his burden on the ground and fell
  flat on its face: the others prostrated themselves likewise, as the
  luminosity increased. And with curiosity overcoming her terror Judy stared at
  this extraordinary phenomenon.</p>

  <p>The centre of the light seemed to be about six feet from the ground, and
  as it grew stronger and stronger the ape-men began to manifest signs of
  increasing terror. The torch bearers had dropped their burdens, which lay
  smoking on the ground, and had thrown themselves on their faces also. Only
  Judy and Bill still stood up, with the misshapen figure of Dresler just in
  front of them moving restlessly about on his stunted legs.</p>

  <p>At last the light focussed itself into a definite nucleus: a circle some
  three inches in diameter that shone steadily. Around the circle it grew
  fainter till it faded into the general darkness. Gradually the nucleus
  increased in size, and as it did so the agitation of the monsters became
  extreme. A low wailing noise came from them, and the leader began to beat its
  great chest with its hands. And then with startling suddenness the nucleus of
  light expanded and grew until it took the form of a luminous face hanging in
  mid air.</p>

  <p>"It's a trick, miss," muttered Bill, though his voice was shaking a
  little. "It must be a trick of Mr. Maitland's."</p>

  <p>She stared at it fascinated, and though she knew Bill was right her mouth
  felt a little dry, and her knees were inclined to shake. There was something
  inconceivably ghostly about the dismembered head floating in the air in front
  of her, with its reflection glinting in the water. Its features were
  Mongolian and evil, and in its forehead was a black patch from which no light
  shone.</p>

  <p>The monsters were beside themselves with fright, though none of them
  seemed to be able to pluck up enough courage to go. And she was just
  wondering what was going to happen next when there came a scream from the
  dwarf. The leading ape-man had risen to his feet and was holding Dresler high
  above his head. It gave a heave with its mighty shoulders, and flung the
  dwarf clean over the water towards the shining head. Then once again it threw
  itself on its face.</p>

  <p>They heard the dwarf land with a crash in some undergrowth: then silence,
  broken only by a faint rustling noise. A further sacrifice had been
  offered&mdash;but how? The fall could not have killed him. Motionless the
  monsters waited, their eyes fixed on the spot. And then came a shout from the
  dwarf.</p>

  <p>"Help me! They're all round me. Ah-h&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The shriek died away in his throat, and Judy gave a little moan. There was
  something too horrible in this unknown terror of the darkness. What were all
  round him? They could hear him stumbling about on the other side of the water
  moaning pitifully. And then again he shrieked.</p>

  <p>"I can't stand this," muttered Bill. "The poor brute is blind."</p>

  <p>He took a step forward, and then occurred a thing so unexpected that he
  stopped, rooted to the spot. There came a hissing noise, and leaving a trail
  of sparks behind it, a rocket soared up from behind the luminous face. It
  burst above them, and for a space the clearing was lit up as brightly as if
  it was day.</p>

  <p>With yells of terror the ape-men scattered in every direction, until Bill
  and Judy were left standing alone in the centre. And as if turned to stone
  they stared fascinated at the sight in front of them. The head was the head
  of an idol, its luminosity no longer showing in the brilliant light that
  flooded the place. But it was not at the idol they were looking.</p>

  <p>Standing below it, in some low undergrowth was the dwarf. And even as they
  watched him a deadly yellow-brown head raised itself to a level with his
  face, and struck twice. They looked at the edge of the water: the coarse
  grass was moving. Another swaying head raised itself and hissed angrily:
  another and yet another. They watched them writhing in every direction as the
  dwarf blundered about: they saw him bitten twice more before the light died
  out. The place was a heaving mass of snakes.</p>

  <p>Then as the head once more grew luminous, and the smoking torches still
  guttered on the floor, there came a sudden splash. The dwarf by chance had
  found the water and came blundering through it. His face was distorted with
  agony: twelve times had he been bitten. And he barely reached the edge before
  he gave one final moan, fell on his face and with a last dreadful convulsion
  lay still. Emil Dresler, blackmailer, white slave trafficker and
  arch-scoundrel was dead.</p>

  <p>All round them the ape-men moved restlessly in the dense growth that
  formed the sides of the clearing. Occasionally they saw two gleaming eyes
  staring at them, but the brutes themselves did not dare to venture into the
  open. And then the movement ceased: eyes were watching from everywhere, as if
  waiting for something.</p>

  <p>Judy turned round: what was happening now? The leading ape-man was just
  behind her: its hands were coming out to seize her. And with a pitiful
  scream&mdash;"Bill save me," she felt herself picked up as if she was a child
  above the brute's head, and carried towards the edge of the water. She was
  the next sacrifice.</p>

  <p>Bill had sprung forward fumbling madly with his knife, when suddenly she
  found herself deposited once more on the ground. And forcing herself to look
  at the monstrous thing towering above her she saw that it was staring at the
  idol with a puzzled expression in its eyes. She looked herself, and to her
  amazement saw that the luminous head had disappeared. And yet there was still
  a diffused light which came from the direction of the idol.</p>

  <p>Two of the torches had died out: the third gave but a feeble flicker, so
  that the darkness was almost complete. And gradually there rose from behind
  the idol two shining hands followed once more by the face. The idol itself
  was moving, and with a bellow of fear the ape-man flung himself down. Upwards
  rose the hands, but Judy with every nerve tingling had her eyes riveted on
  the face. For now the features were not evil and Mongolian: the features were
  the features of Jim Maitland. What he had done, what trick he was playing she
  neither knew nor cared: Jim was there and nothing else mattered.</p>

  <p>Fascinated she watched him: what was he going to do next? Very steadily
  the face rose till it seemed an incredible height in the air. Then it came
  rushing through the air towards her, and she realised Jim had jumped. From
  all around her came roars of terror, and the sounds of heavy bodies
  stampeding through the undergrowth. Their god had come to life.</p>

  <p>Jim landed in the water, and then with measured step he approached the one
  prostrate ape-man who remained. It rose to its feet and backed away
  whimpering, followed by those terrible shining hands, and face. And as Jim
  passed Judy he muttered "Follow me."</p>

  <p>It forced the monster to the entrance of the clearing; then with a sudden
  bound he sprang at it, and placed both his hands on its chest. And there
  marked in fire on the brute's body were the imprints of his fingers. They
  remained there glowing in the darkness, and as the ape-man looked down and
  saw the marks of its god gleaming on its own chest its nerve broke
  completely. It gave one gigantic bound, and disappeared into the forest: the
  three of them were alone.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Jim quietly, "We've got no time to lose. The effect of my
  ju-ju may not last long."</p>

  <p>"But how did you do it, Jim?" cried the girl breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"That will keep, Judy," he answered. "What we've got to do now is to make
  tracks for the motor-boat and Percy."</p>

  <p>"What about the others, Mr. Maitland?" said Bill.</p>

  <p>"We'll open the barrier for them," said Jim, "but after that they must
  fend for themselves. There will be no room for them on board the boat."</p>

  <p>"What about the yacht?"</p>

  <p>"Unless I'm very much mistaken there is no longer a yacht," answered the
  other gravely. "Percy has done his work passing well. Now then&mdash;heave on
  this, Bill: again so&mdash;and again."</p>

  <p>The heavy barrier slid back: the way to the tunnel was open.</p>

  <p>"You are free," shouted Jim down it. "Make your way to the north end of
  the island, and we'll try and rescue you later. Quick now, you two: we can't
  have them following us."</p>

  <p>He darted across the main clearing the other two at his heels. A luminous
  patch glowed faintly on a tree, which marked the entrance to one of the
  paths, and a moment later they were running down the track. They came to a
  fork: another luminous spot showed them the direction. And at every point
  where there might be any doubt the same sign was found.</p>

  <p>"I marked the places where we might go wrong on my way," explained Jim.
  "Lord! but it's been touch and go."</p>

  <p>He slowed up to a walk: then stopped to listen. From behind them still
  came the sounds of the ape-men calling to one another, and once they heard a
  shrill human scream.</p>

  <p>"I don't give much for the chances of those other poor devils," said Jim
  gravely. "But it would have had to be all or none, and we couldn't have taken
  more than two at the utmost."</p>

  <p>He pushed on again, with the luminosity gradually fading from his face and
  hands, until at length he came to the alligator pool where he forked right
  down stream. And after about a quarter of a mile he let out a hail which was
  answered from in front of them. Percy was there in the motor-boat.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear," he said quietly as he lifted her on board, "it was touch and
  go."</p>

  <p>For a second they were alone, and she put her arms round his neck.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you did it, Jim," she whispered, "but I think you're the
  most wonderful man on earth."</p>

  <p>Which was the moment that Percy would choose to appear.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, wench," he remarked. "Dear me! how very strange. I'd no idea
  that phosphorus travelled aerially so to speak."</p>

  <p>"What are you blathering about, you unspeakable mess," demanded Jim, and
  then happening to glance at Judy's face he made a dive for his cousin. For
  her lips were luminous, and the method by which they had become so was not
  hard to guess.</p>

  <p>"I just can't believe I'm back here," said the girl a few minutes later.
  "Can you, Bill?"</p>

  <p>The boat was nosing down the river towards the open sea.</p>

  <p>"I can't, miss," he said solemnly. "How did you manage it, Mr.
  Maitland?"</p>

  <p>"Well, Bill, one thing stood out a mile."</p>

  <p>The first streaks of dawn were beginning to show in the east, and the
  three of them were sprawling on the deck with Percy at the wheel.</p>

  <p>"The only possible hope was to frighten those brutes by something which
  they would regard as supernatural. Gun work was useless: there were far too
  many of them. And it was then that I remembered that I'd stowed a pot of
  luminous paint amongst our kit for the very purpose I used it for in the
  forest&mdash;marking a trail by night.</p>

  <p>"Now Percy and I had been to the spot where we found you yesterday
  afternoon, and while there we had fallen through an ancient type of trap into
  the very place where you were imprisoned. And there we killed one of the
  monsters. But the barrier was open at the end of the tunnel so we escaped all
  right. The point however is that I knew where you would be taken to, which
  was a very great advantage.</p>

  <p>"Then came the second discovery&mdash;made by Percy. For what purpose they
  brought it I don't know&mdash;probably in case blasting was
  necessary&mdash;but there was a large quantity of dynamite on board the
  yacht. So we concocted a plan. By the way&mdash;what happened to her,
  Percy?"</p>

  <p>"All in good time, Jim: you carry on."</p>

  <p>"Percy was to land me complete with phosphorus paint, and then return to
  the yacht. Three quarters of an hour later, so as to give me time to get to
  you he was to let drive on the siren. I told him to send O.K. to cheer you
  up, but the real object was to draw as many of the monsters away from you and
  back to the yacht as possible. It succeeded admirably: at least thirty of
  them went crashing past me in the forest."</p>

  <p>"And thirty of them came on board the yacht," put in Percy. "When I heard
  'em down there by the water's edge, I laid a ten minute fuse to the dynamite,
  and hooked it in the motor-boat. She split open like a rotten apple, Jim, and
  sank at once, and I think the little pretties were all in her at the
  time."</p>

  <p>They had reached the open sea, and all around them the water was strewn
  with wreckage.</p>

  <p>"Pity," said Jim. "She was a nice boat. However so much for that. To go
  back to you and Judy. I had no idea, of course, what was going to happen, or
  how those brutes proposed to deal with you. I'd heard the screams of a man as
  I went through the forest."</p>

  <p>"That was the Englishman they sacrificed first," said Bill.</p>

  <p>"Also shouts from someone else whose voice seemed familiar. And you can
  guess my amazement when I realised as I got nearer that that someone else was
  none other than Dresler, who had been abducted from the motor-boat earlier.
  Moreover they were obviously making a god of him, and the reason suddenly
  dawned on me. The golden idol which they worship is made in the form of a
  misshapen dwarf, and they probably thought that Dresler was this idol come to
  life.</p>

  <p>"However all those who hadn't gone to the yacht were below with you, and
  by peering through a chink in the booby trap, which apparently is not set
  when they are there I could see you quite distinctly. And I could also hear
  that unpleasant Brazilian sailor. So since it was essential to find out the
  way they went to work, I thought he would be an admirable person to start
  on.</p>

  <p>"Well the trick with the electric torch succeeded, and they brought him up
  whilst I hid in the undergrowth. They lashed his feet and his
  hands&mdash;just as we found Lopez, Percy&mdash;and threw him over the water
  towards the idol. And there they left him to be bitten to death by <i>fer de
  lance</i> and poisonous adders&mdash;just about as deadly a combination as
  you could get. Moreover a complication on which I had not reckoned.</p>

  <p>"You see I'd already made up my mind that the only hope lay in playing the
  fool with their idol. But the point that now arose was how the devil I was
  going to get to it. A <i>fer de lance</i> is no respecter of persons, and as
  you saw for yourselves that ground was alive with the brutes, which were
  imprisoned there by the water. However I knew it had got to be chanced, but I
  had to wait till the explosion took place. I guessed that would rouse them,
  and it was essential to get you and Bill up from below while it was still
  dark, or else my luminous paint fell flat.</p>

  <p>"It all worked according to plan except that for some reason or other they
  turned on Dresler. However that didn't matter: he richly deserved all he got.
  I got through the snake belt by wrapping my coat round my legs; then I stood
  behind the idol on a sort of pedestal place. And the rest you know. First I
  rubbed its face with the paint: then I hoped that the rocket would finish
  them. But it didn't. So I covered the idol's head with my coat and decorated
  my own hands and face keeping hidden behind it while I did so. And that's
  that."</p>

  <p>"Not bad for you either, James," remarked Percy kindly. "Sorry I wasn't in
  at the death but I quite enjoyed myself this end. Great fun seeing that yacht
  blow up. Hullo! do my eyes deceive me, or are those some of the little pets
  on the edge of the swamp?"</p>

  <p>Jim snatched up the field-glasses. The sun had risen: the mist had lifted
  from the bog which stretched away to their left. And as he watched a peculiar
  smile flickered round his lips. There were more than a dozen of the ape-men,
  and they were clustering round a small squat object that lay on the ground.
  Then with a great effort they lifted it, and flung it into the swamp. For a
  while they stood there: then they vanished into the forest.</p>

  <p>"Half a million gone west," he remarked. "Assuredly I damaged that god's
  reputation. And I guess it's just as well that I spent some of my spare time
  removing this while I stood behind it."</p>

  <p>From his pocket he drew a huge red stone the size of a hen's egg. It lay
  in his hand like a ball of crimson fire; then he held it out to Judy.</p>

  <p>"That's for you, bless you," he said. "And you richly deserve it after all
  you've gone through."</p>

  <p>She looked at it quietly for a moment or two: then she glanced up at
  Jim.</p>

  <p>"It's a ruby, isn't it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It certainly is," he answered. "Moreover I should say that it literally
  is priceless."</p>

  <p>"And you give it to me?"</p>

  <p>"That," he remarked, "is the idea."</p>

  <p>She stared at him steadily, a strange look in her eyes. Then with a quick
  movement she flung it overboard, and with that streak of glittering red light
  there vanished for ever the last of the treasure.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't bear it, Jim," she cried. "It's haunted. We would never have a
  moment's peace while we had it."</p>

  <p>"We?" he said, taking both her hands in his.</p>

  <p>The others had gone below: they were alone.</p>

  <p>"That," she repeated softly, "is the idea."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">
  THUS ended the strange adventure of Lone Tree Island. No trace was ever
  found of the members of the yacht's crew, who perforce had been left behind:
  in fact the island was reported to be uninhabited. But sometimes o' nights an
  expression comes over Jim's face which makes Judy look at him suspiciously.
  Is there still treasure hidden somewhere in that forest guarded by the
  survivors of the ape-men? Is there perchance another god of solid gold in
  some undiscovered clearing? Who knows? And as far as Judy is concerned there
  is one person who certainly never will&mdash;her husband.</p>
