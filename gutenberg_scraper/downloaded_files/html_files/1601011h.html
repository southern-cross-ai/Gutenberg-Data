  <h2><a name="ch-00"
     id="ch-00"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

  <p class="first">MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT GODWIN is now chiefly remembered as the
  author of <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, a work that is,
  however, remarkable only for the sex of the writer, the period when, and the
  circumstances in which it was written. The book has often been quoted as the
  forerunner of the "freedom" of women that took place during the nineteenth
  century, at least in Great Britain, and Mary Wollstonecraft herself has been
  acclaimed as a prophetess of the emancipation of her sex, and as one who did
  much to smooth the way for subsequent female triumphs.</p>

  <p>The question is a large one, and cannot be more than briefly touched on
  here. The very words "rights" and "freedom" do not now bear the plain
  meanings that they did to Mary Wollstonecraft. We cannot see the vast complex
  problems of humanity as simply as she saw them; we have much knowledge that
  was denied to her, and we have witnessed the working out of projects that
  were to her ardently desired ideals, but are to us merely expedients that are
  only partly successful.</p>

  <p>Were Mary Wollstonecraft to return today, she would find that most of the
  changes that she had sighed for had taken place, and that her countrywomen
  had obtained "freedom" in the sense in which she used the word. But she would
  not find that all the problems that trouble women had been thereby solved, or
  all their burdens lifted.</p>

  <p>It is probable that there were as many contented women in the England of
  Mary Wollstonecraft's time as in the England of today; each period has its
  own peculiar vexations and problems, and we can hardly claim that the story
  of mankind moves in a steady progress towards some ultimate perfection, and
  that therefore women are "better off" by 150 years of improved conditions
  than they were in the reign of George III. Many wrongs have been righted
  since then, many still remain. A woman is now undisputed mistress of her
  property and her person, but if she possesses no property and finds her
  person neglected or ignored and herself condemned to live in drab obscurity,
  she cannot enjoy her freedom, be happy or useful.</p>

  <p>Nearly all professions are now open to women; but of what advantage is
  this to a woman who has not talent, capacity for learning difficult work,
  courage and robust health? And if she is gifted with all these and achieves
  success in her chosen line, still she is not a happy woman unless she has
  contrived a successful emotional life, too, and been loved as well as
  respected.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft's famous book was written in the light of ugly
  personal experiences; she was as indignant as she was sincere, and looked
  round passionately for remedies for the evils from which she and her friends
  had so cruelly suffered.</p>

  <p>They have not yet been found, at least, in Europe; all that has been done
  for women in the last century and a half has not saved them from the
  tragedies that afflicted Mary Wollstonecraft, Eliza Bishop and Fanny
  Blood&mdash;inherited poverty, brutal or indifferent parents, disease
  following overwork and neglect, reluctant or faithless lovers, incompatible
  husbands, the struggle to wring a living from an apathetic world; all this is
  "any summer's story," and has not been ended by female suffrage or any other
  abstract benefits women have recently received.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft wrote her book before her own emotional experiences;
  her elaborate reasoning that ignores feminine instincts and passions was
  based on her observations of other people's faults and difficulties, failures
  and wrongs; when she met her own lover she became, as her sister Eliza Bishop
  bitterly remarked, "but a woman." She had no more to say of the rights of
  women, for she had learned the sharp lesson that the only thing that matters
  to a woman&mdash;of her type, at least&mdash;is luck in love.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft's fame depended almost entirely on her sex; what she
  said was platitudinous or crude&mdash;but a woman said it; what she did was
  not so very extraordinary&mdash;but a woman did it. Therefore half her world
  shut its doors in her face and the other half extolled her as a paragon.</p>

  <p>Many of the admirers of Mary Wollstonecraft have written of her in a
  strain of defiant championship that exaggerates her qualities as much as her
  detractors depreciated them.</p>

  <p>It is noticeable how Mrs. Pennell and Mrs. Fawcett, writing respectively
  in 1885 and 1891 of Mary Wollstonecraft, judge her in terms that now seem as
  old-fashioned as their heroine's own diatribes. So in another fifty years
  will anything that may be written now of this woman or of this subject seem
  out of date.</p>

  <p>We can obtain a true view of Mary Wollstonecraft only by seeking in her
  character for the eternal essentials of human nature and feminine instincts.
  Mrs. Pennell labours to defend Mary Wollstonecraft's two illicit unions by
  trying to prove that in each case she acted on principle&mdash;wrong,
  perhaps, but sincere&mdash;and that she became, in a short space of time, the
  mistress of two different men as a gesture of independence and as an
  affirmation of her belief in sex equality. Mr. Kegan Paul wrote: "She ran
  counter to the customs of society, yet not wantonly or lightly, but with
  forethought, in order to carry out a moral theory gravely and religiously
  adopted."</p>

  <p>How cold and priggish does such a theory make this warm-hearted woman out
  to be! Mary Wollstonecraft did not live her life that it might be an example
  of independence, a hundred years later, to supporters of women's suffrage or
  "rights." She lived with Gilbert Imlay, because she fell deeply in love with
  him, and he was not to be had on any other terms, and because she had the
  courage and the financial independence to defy convention at the dictates of
  passion. She lived with William Godwin, because she was mentally exhausted,
  emotionally broken, lonely and eager for at least some imitation of the
  conjugal life she had led with Imlay. She married Godwin, because she dreaded
  social ostracism and the bringing of a second illegitimate child into an
  orthodox world; she was by then worn out with grief and disillusionment and
  had given up the hopeless struggle with conventionality.</p>

  <p>None of this is at all heroic, and it strips Mary of much of the glory
  that has been given her by the ardent feminists who have tried to depict her
  as always acting on rigid principles of right and wrong, and as opposing to a
  corrupt society the purity of her noble and resolute character, but that it
  is the truth an unbiased reader of her tragic story can hardly doubt.</p>

  <p>Passion, not principle, dictated her letters to Gilbert Imlay; passion,
  not reason, was behind her two attempts at suicide; lassitude, not a lofty
  affection, was behind her union with Godwin, and mere expediency was behind
  her marriage.</p>

  <p>She was not a woman of very brilliant gifts; she was self-educated, not
  well-read, and not imaginative; she was sensitive to a fault, proud,
  delicate-minded, and like so many women who have endured a wretched
  childhood, enamoured of an ideal domesticity. She was not witty, and not a
  stroke of humour&mdash;in any sense of the word&mdash;enlivens her work or
  her correspondence. Her miserable circumstances had given all her thoughts a
  melancholy cast and a bitter opinion of humanity; she was not without that
  touch of the scold natural to one who continually chides others, not without
  a suspicion of the old-time schoolmistress's didacticism, nor of a hint of
  that intellectual arrogance common to the clever woman in a period when
  clever women were rare. She was considered a wise judge of character, yet in
  the only case when this gift would have served her, that of Gilbert Imlay,
  she was grossly deceived. In allowing this man to treat her as his "wife"
  without any ceremony or legal bond, Mary Wollstonecraft made an immense
  mistake, but it was one that no warm-hearted woman in her circumstances could
  have avoided and that few women, even after going through the agony of
  desertion, would have regretted.</p>

  <p>She had accepted, not refused, life, and her memories of that snatched
  happiness were worth what she paid for them.</p>

  <p>This famous woman died in her prime, at the height of her powers, and, as
  her friends believed, with her best work unaccomplished.</p>

  <p>This may be doubted; there is no indication in her posthumous work that
  she would have ever been more than what her daughter became&mdash;an
  intelligent, industrious writer, compiler and translator, breaking the
  monotony of hack work with occasional original pieces&mdash;all to be
  forgotten within a decade of her death.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft was harshly judged by many of her contemporaries and
  scurrilously abused both during her life and after her death, though it seems
  incredible now that the flat common sense, truisms and platitudes of her
  celebrated book could have not only aroused furies of dissent, but have
  provoked charges of inciting to moral anarchy against the author.</p>

  <p>The bold advocate of feminine rights was considered by many to be not only
  wrong in opinion, but wicked in intention. Her own sex, her own sisters,
  condemned her pitilessly.</p>

  <p>These hostile critics contended that by pointing out the gross defects in
  women's position, in their training and character, and by claiming for them
  an equality with men, she was first degrading her sex by stripping it of all
  its modesty, charm and mystery, and then suggesting an impossible remedy for
  negligible wrongs by proposing that women should become feminine males and
  give up all their cherished privileges for unwanted rights.</p>

  <p>There was much truth in these arguments. It is certain that the great
  majority of Mary Wollstonecraft's female contemporaries repudiated her
  championship and rejected her advice, and that all her male
  contemporaries&mdash;with the exception of a few advanced Radicals or
  Jacobins&mdash;dismissed all she had to say as the dangerously hysterical
  ravings of an unsexed virago.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft was herself largely to blame for this. She adopted a
  violent, railing tone; she bitterly attacked feminine foibles and vices; she
  sourly inveighed against masculine brutalities and tyrannies, and she left
  out of account altogether the thousands of happy marriages, families and
  lives that the system she so sweepingly condemned had produced.</p>

  <p>She wrote so completely from personal observation of a few individual
  cases that she lost all sense of proportion, and was not able to see that the
  institutions, customs and laws that she attacked were not in themselves bad,
  and that where they broke down the fallibility of human nature was to blame,
  and that if they were to be swept away it would be very difficult to replace
  them. The safety, dignity and repose of women were carefully legislated for
  centuries before Mary Wollstonecraft was born; a woman was protected in her
  father's house until she entered that of her husband; her widowhood, her old
  age, her children were all provided for out of her property; if no husband
  could be chosen for her, she entered a convent, where she found a shelter
  respected by the most lawless.</p>

  <p>Nor did women lead idle or slavish lives. They were most carefully
  educated and trained, and the running of the great
  households&mdash;self-supporting and as large as small villages&mdash;fell to
  them. When young, they served as excuses for the masculine ideals of
  chivalry; when past the charms that then were allowed to fade so quickly they
  acted as friends, advisers, guides and supporters of the male members of the
  family. There is nothing in history to make us suppose that feminine
  influence on human affairs was less before women obtained their "rights" than
  after they were admitted to political equality, or that they did not then, on
  the whole, enjoy as much respect, happiness and peace of mind as at any
  subsequent period.</p>

  <p>In Mary Wollstonecraft's day the elaborate social machinery of the Middle
  Ages had broken down and marriage suffered from the lax morality, the
  economic disturbances and the loose thinking of the period. The main trouble
  was financial. The marriage laws were slackly administered and much abused,
  heiresses were insufficiently protected, fortune hunters were unscrupulous,
  and a decaying landed gentry bartered its daughters to flourishing tradesmen,
  and heirs to ruined estates married well-dowered city madams. Marriage laws
  had broken down at several points, but so had most other laws and
  institutions. Not only in the treatment of women could the late eighteenth
  century be termed barbarous&mdash;civilisation was then at a low ebb in
  England.</p>

  <p>There is abundant evidence, however, that human kindliness and common
  sense adjusted all difficulties in the vast majority of instances; men and
  women lived together on the whole happily. The successful marriages of the
  ordinary people are unchronicled, but examples of perfect unions among the
  famous people whose names have endured come at once to mind. Catherine Blake,
  Lady Romilly, Jane Hogarth, Ann Cobbett were not concerned, in their
  beautiful obscurity, with the rights of women; their wifely devotion was as
  lovely and unblemished as that of the women of an earlier
  generation&mdash;Margaret Lucas, Dorothy Temple, Lucy Fanshawe, Rachel
  Russell, and that Stewart Queen Mary II, who regretted "that she had only
  three crowns to give her husband."</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft herself, for all her intelligence and vicarious
  experience, fell a victim to her own passion and another's inconstancy and
  was reduced to the supreme humiliation of attempted self-destruction; none of
  the rights she clamoured for would have saved her from that depth of
  self-confessed failure. Indeed, that a famous, brilliant woman should try to
  take her own life because of her lover's desertion is a most pitiful thing,
  for it reveals, with disconcerting clarity, that nothing avails a woman
  crossed in love and that the ignorant little kitchen maid and the celebrated
  ornament of her sex alike seek the final oblivion when faced with the
  emptiness of an existence where passion has been and is no more.</p>

  <p>It is not, then, either as a champion of women's rights, or as a literary
  figure, or as a reformer or a philosopher that Mary Wollstonecraft is
  interesting, but as a woman "lovely in her person," intelligent, brave and
  unfortunate, whose story was odd, tragic and touching.</p>

  <p>Her valiant struggles for independence, for happiness, for her ideals, her
  rebellion against her circumstances, her defeat, recovery and resignation
  will always make her life an absorbing study for other women, none of whom
  can surely refuse her memory sympathy, understanding and some admiration.</p>

  <p>It is the story of her life that is given here, not that of her opinions
  or her times; the former are only dwelt on as they illustrate her character,
  the latter as they form her background.</p>

  <p>The materials for a life of Mary Wollstonecraft are not very abundant, nor
  are they so scanty as in the case of many of her contemporaries; her
  husband's story of her career is more in the nature of a justification of her
  actions than a detailed narrative of her life, of which perhaps William
  Godwin was not very well informed. The radical philosopher, with tender care,
  also collected his wife's papers and letters.</p>

  <p>Mary Godwin, afterwards Mary Shelley, seems to have come into possession
  of much of her mother's early correspondence, which must have been sent to
  her by her aunts and George Blood; these papers remained in the possession of
  the Shelley family, and were lent to Mr. Kegan Paul by Sir Percy Shelley in
  1879. Unfortunately, in his valuable <i>William Godwin and his Friends</i>,
  Mr. Kegan Paul gave only a selection from these papers, and both the
  originals of these and also those not published appear, according to a later
  biographer, Mr. Ford K. Brown, <i>William Godwin</i>, 1926, to have been
  unaccountably and most vexatiously lost. We have, then, only those portions
  of Mary Wollstonecraft's correspondence that her husband found among her
  papers and published&mdash;letters to Imlay, and a few to Mr. Joseph
  Johnson&mdash;and those that Mr. Kegan Paul chose to select for his
  biography.</p>

  <p>The remaining materials consist of scattered allusions in contemporary
  writings, in William Godwin's stoic diary and in Mary Wollstonecraft's own
  works, which are, however, poor in autobiographical details. We can only
  guess at her experiences from her opinions and prejudices, and thus confirm
  what we know of her circumstances from what we read of her feelings.</p>

  <p>The great gap in the materials for a life of Mary Wollstonecraft is caused
  by the lack of any detailed or sure knowledge of Gilbert Imlay. Her husband
  and her friends, who must have known much about him, thought him only
  deserving of oblivion and disdained to record any particulars of his person,
  his career, his business or prospects.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft's later biographers likewise have treated the
  inconstant lover with haughty indifference; Mrs. Pennell briefly dismisses
  him with "unworthy of Mary's noble affection."</p>

  <p>There must be more to the story than that; Mary's love for Imlay was the
  most important event in her life, and the man himself becomes of supreme
  interest to anyone who wishes to reconstruct her character.</p>

  <p>But, as his letters have gone, and all his contemporaries agreed to keep
  silence on the subject of Mary's lover, we have to put him together as best
  we can from what little we know of his behaviour, from the letters addressed
  to him, and from the brief account of him given by Godwin.</p>

  <p>Darnford, in the <i>Wrongs of Woman</i>, is supposed to be a portrait of
  Imlay; but Mary, unfortunately, was neither a descriptive writer nor a
  mistress of the vivid phrase, and we are not told even the colour of
  Darnford's hair or eyes, or indeed given any hint to his appearance, while
  his character is drawn on general lines&mdash;a dissipated youth, a ready way
  with women, inconstant as seductive, a Robert Lovelace without any of the
  grace and humour that Richardson cast about his charming villain.</p>

  <p>It is much to be regretted that Mary's friends did not pay more attention
  to the man for whose sake she twice attempted suicide, and that someone did
  not try to justify her love by extolling the object of it, for, if Imlay was
  worthless, Mary was a fool, blinded by those mere physical passions she had
  herself so loudly despised in her <i>Rights of Woman</i>.</p>

  <p>In this, as in other unhappy love stories, all the nobility cannot be on
  the side of the women and all the baseness on the side of the men, unless one
  allows&mdash;what Mary Wollstonecraft never would allow&mdash;that the purity
  of the female character is equalled only by the imbecility of the female
  mind.</p>

  <p>There is indeed every indication, as we shall see when we come to consider
  the case, that Gilbert Imlay was an attractive person with many admirable
  qualities, and that his seemingly heartless behaviour towards his mistress
  was the result of the profound difference between their circumstances and
  their points of view when their connection began.</p>

  <p>Matthew Arnold said, with some self-righteous petulance, that the suicides
  and attempted suicides in the Godwin-Wollstonecraft circle "sickened him of
  irregular relationships."</p>

  <p>But Mary Wollstonecraft can hardly be held responsible for the suicide
  either of Fanny Imlay or of Harriet Westbrook, or for the vagaries of Jane
  Clairmont; death had rescued her, nearly twenty years before, from these
  tragic entanglements that sprang more from poverty and uncontrolled passion
  than from "irregular relationships." Lawful matrimony has its disasters, too,
  and perfect respectability its spectacular failures.</p>

  <p>There is only one undisputed portrait of Mary Wollstonecraft in existence,
  that by Opie, which used to hang in William Godwin's room at Snow Hill, and
  preside, like a revered idol, over the tempestuous shifts of the
  philosopher's raggle-taggle household; it passed into the possession of Sir
  Percy Shelley, and is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London. This
  picture of a full-faced young woman in a plain gown with loose hair does full
  justice to Mary's good looks and the expression has nothing of that arrogance
  which Robert Southey found objectionable in the countenance of the celebrated
  authoress; it must have been painted shortly before her unexpected death. It
  was engraved by Heath and published by Joseph Johnson in 1798.</p>

  <p>A cast taken after death and a quantity of bright auburn hair, also in the
  possession of the Shelley family, are said to confirm the truth of the
  likeness of this portrait.</p>

  <p>In 1796 a print appeared inscribed as engraved by Ridley after Opie and
  entitled <i>Mary Wollstonecraft</i>. This print passed undisputed during
  Mary's lifetime. In the mid-nineteenth century a picture from which the print
  appears to have been taken was in the possession of a Mr. William Rennell,
  sold to him as by Northcote, but declared afterwards to be by Opie. It is now
  in the National Gallery, London.</p>

  <p>This picture shows a young woman with a ribbon binding powdered hair, in a
  striped dress, holding a book, the expression very grave, almost
  disagreeable. There seems no reason to doubt that this is a likeness of Mary
  Wollstonecraft other than that the print by Ridley seems to have been pirated
  and that the fashionable attire and coiffure are not judged likely details
  for a portrait of this ardent feminist.</p>

  <i>Jerusalem</i>, 1804.</p><br>

  <p class="first">AS the storm blew away across the Welsh hills and the watery
  light of a chill evening fell over the lonely farm, the girl peered out from
  her hiding-place&mdash;the loft of a small barn that was, like the rest of
  the wretched estate, dirty and neglected.</p>

  <p>Her apprehensive but resolute glance ranged over a dreary scene. Not only
  was the landscape sombre, massive in outline and dark in colouring, but the
  farm lands showed thriftlessness and poverty; broken fences, swinging gates,
  gaunt and filthy straying animals formed the foreground to a grey stone house
  with a slate roof that matched in drab hues the gloomy scene. Household uses
  had polluted the stream that, gushing clear and brilliant from the
  mountainside, here flowed sluggishly, clogged with refuse, through the yard
  where a few hens scratched, and a few cotton garments flapped on a string
  fastened between two poles.</p>

  <p>The bleak aspect of the house was not softened by the squares of soiled
  white dimity curtains at the severe, flat windows or by the melancholy
  resignation of the underfed dog stretching his iron-coloured fleece in front
  of the half-opened door that revealed a dark interior.</p>

  <p>The watching girl's peaked, intelligent face became sharp with
  concentration as she gazed and listened, on the alert for enemies.</p>

  <p>A violent shouting of her name&mdash;"Mary! Mary!"&mdash;first in a hoarse
  male voice, then in the querulous tones of a woman, made the little girl
  withdraw instantly into her shelter and lie down trembling and panting on the
  boards rough with chaff and dust.</p>

  <p>The man's angry cries came nearer; the child heard her name mingled with
  obscene curses, which were to her so familiar as to cause her no
  astonishment; she peered cautiously through a chink in the wooden side of the
  barn and saw her father stumbling through the wet overflow of the steaming
  midden heap; he still held the whip with which he had an hour before thrashed
  his Mary, and he looked round in a sidelong fashion, alternately shouting and
  muttering and poking the while with his whip in an aimless fashion at the
  piles of refuse, the squawking hens, the broken, rusty farm implements on the
  rough ground.</p>

  <p>Mary lay rigid; she knew how to escape out of the ruined barn by the back,
  she knew the path up to the hills, and she meant to run away to that cold and
  stormy refuge if her father found her; she had no regrets for her forfeited
  supper and bed; indignation was stronger in her wild little heart than fear;
  she preferred any danger to the risk of being again beaten by the big
  red-faced man in the patched, shabby clothes, who was plainly searching for
  her, blaspheming because she had escaped him.</p>

  <p>His fury had been roused against the dog, and while the younger children
  had stood round, crying hysterically because the friendly, amusing animal was
  being beaten, Mary had leapt at the tyrant and struggled for the whip, crying
  out the while in a frenzy of indignation. She was soon mastered, and received
  the punishment intended for the beast. Her father had dragged her into the
  kitchen, and in front of the untidy hearth had thrashed her in the presence
  of her mother and the other children.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wollstonecraft, though she hated her husband, liked the dog and
  pitied Mary, yet was a strict upholder of discipline and filial obedience,
  therefore she did not interfere, but relieved her breaking nerves by
  violently scrubbing with a soapless brush the long neglected dresser.</p>

  <p>Mary's punishment, which she had endured stoically, for she was deeply
  relieved that the dog had escaped, was interrupted by the arrival of a
  Welshman with an overdue account for cattle meal.</p>

  <p>The creditor was not reassured by the sight of the farm&mdash;obviously
  bankrupt&mdash;and the ragged family, or soothed by the debtor's swaggering
  airs of London gentility. He brusquely demanded his money, and during the
  noisy altercation that followed Mary had fled to the barn through a heavy
  storm of rain that broke over the gloomy landscape.</p>

  <p>Now the creditor had been got rid of somehow, and Mr. Wollstonecraft, in a
  humour rendered more vindictive by that violent interview, was searching for
  his victim. The brow-beaten mother, with spiritless obedience to her master,
  continued to cry, "Mary! Mary!" as she shuffled the evening meal on to the
  table, pausing now and then to shout out of the window or up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Mary, lying mute in the old granary, viewed her father as he prowled
  below, and considered him with the detachment of hatred.</p>

  <p>Edward Wollstonecraft was in the prime of life, stoutly built, tall, with
  good features, and thick auburn hair tied back by a dirty string; a week's
  growth of reddish beard disfigured his inflamed face, his linen was torn and
  dirty, his high boots required both cleaning and mending. He looked what he
  was&mdash;one of those wastrels who, bred as gentlemen&mdash;that is, as
  human beings on whom money has been spent, who have been allowed soft living,
  authority and leisure&mdash;have never learned any kind of profession or
  performed any manner of work, but have been employed solely in spending on
  vicious self-indulgence a patrimony gained by another's thrift and
  labour.</p>

  <p>Banks of purple clouds blew again across the purple hills and increased
  the rapidity with which the dusk fell over the miserable farm. A dim light
  showed in the kitchen windows, and Elizabeth Wollstonecraft, in a voice that
  had once been pretty and with an Irish accent that was still pleasing,
  timidly called her husband in to supper.</p>

  <p>The exasperated man gave up his search, and roaring a last defiance to the
  truant&mdash;he knew where she was hiding, she should go to bed hungry for a
  vixen, and so on&mdash;returned to his wretched home.</p>

  <p>Mary gave a great sigh and relaxed her tense attitude; her head sunk on to
  her folded arms; her bruised body quivered with relief under the dress of
  common material.</p>

  <p>She was sixteen years of age and knew a good deal of the miseries of
  existence; her intelligence, acute and precociously developed, wondered at
  her misfortunes, which seemed grotesque and unnatural, but she was forced to
  accept them with resignation, since she knew nothing else.</p>

  <p>She acquiesced in her mother's constant sigh: "A little patience, and all
  will be over." An end would come, Mary believed, peace would follow all these
  miseries; death, she thought, was the name of this peace, this end; God would
  take them to Heaven, where there would be ease and silence. She had seen in
  many graveyards the names of those who had died much younger than herself; "a
  little patience," then, and relief would come.</p>

  <p>Yet something strong and ardent that she could not herself understand
  surged in the child's spirit and struggled against this patience, this
  resignation. Zest for life warmed her, though she had never known any joy;
  ambition urged her, though she did not know what there was to achieve.</p>

  <p>She was also, without knowing as much, bold, proud and exquisitely
  sensitive, and her circumstances galled her at every point. She detested
  being in subjection to a creature whom she despised, she revolted against the
  indecencies of a drunkard's poverty-bitten home, and she felt with keen
  poignancy every detail of her own pain and degradation and of that of her
  mother, brothers and sisters whom she loved fondly.</p>

  <p>The dark filled the granary. Mary huddled into some old rough sacks. She
  would not return to the house. She was not afraid of solitude or the night,
  and this was not the first time that she had slept in the barn or in the
  passage outside the room that she shared with Everina and Eliza, ready
  dressed so as to be able to fly at the first alarm.</p>

  <p>She had little imagination, and was not troubled by supernatural terrors;
  her fears and her consolations were alike material. As she lay huddled in the
  barn she began to plan&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;to escape from her
  father's power. She had seen girls no older than herself working on the
  scattered Welsh farms, driving the cattle, herding the sheep, scouring pans
  at the open doors; they seemed, these cheerful creatures in their red shawls
  and bright hats, to be happier than she was. She did not mind work, arid
  surely she could earn her food and some loft in which to sleep, and, in her
  snatched leisure, to study.</p>

  <p>Her dearest possessions were a few books that had been bought for her when
  she had gone to school in Beverley, and she dreamed now of wrapping these in
  a kerchief&mdash;as soon as it was light enough to creep back to the house
  and fetch them&mdash;and running far, far away over the hills until she
  reached some farm or cottage that required an eager, willing little
  servant.</p>

  <p>She peered through the chink in the boards at her home. The yellow speck
  of a rush-light showed in each of the upper windows; the children were going
  to bed, Charles and James in one room, Eliza and Everina in the other. The
  house was silent; probably Mr. Wollstonecraft had gone down to the dark and
  straggling village to drink at the dirty inn.</p>

  <p>His Irish wife, who had been bred a gentlewoman, would be clearing up the
  house, trying, though hampered by exhaustion and despair, to preserve the
  decencies, even the niceties, of life.</p>

  <p>Tears came into Mary's eyes. She knew that she could not escape, could not
  forsake these fellow-victims. She rose, shook off the husks that clung to her
  damp dress, left the barn and, picking her way carefully through the disorder
  of the yard, entered the house.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Margaret Wollstonecraft was putting away the crocks and pans. Her sleeves
  were rolled up, her hands and arms were red from cold water and coarse soap,
  a rough apron was tied over her woollen gown, her dark reddish hair was
  confined in a cotton cap. She had been lovely, and was still graceful, small,
  elegant. Well-proportioned bones made her face still pleasing, though she had
  faded rapidly through child-bearing, grief, anxiety and poverty. Her air of
  utter exhaustion gave her, when she closed her eyes, the appearance of a
  dying woman.</p>

  <p>She greeted her daughter coldly and began to scold her for disobedience
  and for running away. Mary did not answer. She could always endure her
  mother's reproofs; it was those of her father that were intolerable. She
  began to help her mother prepare the room for another dreary day, drudging
  patiently with broom and duster by the light of the poor lamp fed by the
  coarse oil that gave a yellowish light. She was tall and had inherited the
  good looks of her family; her features were small, infantile for her years,
  her complexion was pure and rich, and heavy masses of bright auburn hair were
  gathered in a knot of penny ribbon.</p>

  <p>When the work was ended Mrs. Wollstonecraft dryly dismissed her daughter,
  and Mary went up the crooked stairs to the bedroom where the rush-light
  burned between the beds of Everina and Eliza, who were lying awake, awaiting
  Mary's return. They were beautiful children, with something alert and nervous
  in looks and gestures. They lay tense and silent beneath the patched
  coverlets, gazing at Mary with grave brown eyes.</p>

  <p>The elder sister kissed them in silence. They did not dare to
  speak&mdash;the mother's discipline was unyielding; no matter what the
  sufferings of the children were, no matter what upsets were caused in the
  wretched home by the caprices and cruelties of the father, the children must
  be obedient, quiet, punctual, neat, and always aware of their own
  insignificance.</p>

  <p>Mary folded up her clothes carefully, put on her calico nightsmock and
  crept under the thin blankets with a sigh; then she put out her hand and
  extinguished the rush-light.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>As the girl lay still in the dark listening to the tossings of her sisters
  in their uncomfortable truckle beds and the beating of the rain on the window
  she tried to think out some solutions to the problems that beset
  her&mdash;the need to escape from paternal tyranny, the desire for education,
  the vicarious responsibility that she felt for her younger brothers and
  sisters. She had, in brief, the eternal puzzle of humanity to solve&mdash;how
  to adjust herself so that some semblance of happiness and safety might be
  obtained under circumstances over which she had no control, that she had done
  nothing to help create, yet in which, by the mere accident of birth, she was
  helplessly involved. She looked back on her childhood and saw a series of
  episodes full of loneliness, pain and humiliation.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Edward John Wollstonecraft was the son of a Spitalfields silk weaver who
  had earned a considerable fortune by supplying those glistening silks and
  stiff brocades considered necessary for the adornment of the persons of all
  but the very poorest; even the maidservant or the shopgirl contrived one silk
  gown or one silk kerchief for her Sunday wardrobe. This prudent and
  hardworking merchant left to his only son, Edward John, a flourishing
  business and a capital of over ten thousand pounds securely invested.</p>

  <p>The young man despised his father's trade, and soon began to squander his
  father's fortune. The business was left to others, and the profits from it
  speedily diminished, while the carefully-garnered capital was, portion by
  portion, wasted in foolish speculation.</p>

  <p>Edward Wollstonecraft had been brought up in an atmosphere of gentility;
  he was used to servants to wait on him, comfortable houses, good clothes and
  loose change in his braided pockets. He was, however, as without culture as
  he was without business acumen. His vices were those of a stupid man, and he
  wasted his money in mean company.</p>

  <p>Before his fortune was wholly ruined, he married "for love," as he termed
  it, Margaret Dixon, of a good Irish family, who brought him a small dowry
  which, passing into his absolute control, was soon squandered together with
  his own fortune.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wollstonecraft had been educated on narrow, rigid lines. She believed
  implicitly in the right of a man to domineer in his own household, and in the
  unquestionable obedience of children to their parents. She became at once a
  submissive slave of the brutal bully whom she had married, and quickly sunk
  into a household drudge, permitting her husband unreasonable tyranny, and in
  her turn tyrannising over her family. She found, indeed, a certain relief
  from her own bitter disillusionment in exercising over her children an
  unreasonable authority that caused vexation and restraint to enter into the
  most trivial matters. She exacted the most unconditional submission to her
  orders, which were often inconsistent and contradictory, and her feeble and
  shrewish scolding added to the misery that the father inflicted upon the
  household.</p>

  <p>The family consisted of six children. The eldest, Edward, was the mother's
  favourite. She contrived to give him some education out of the money on which
  she could lay her hands, and he early left to be articled to a lawyer. His
  escape from the detestable home life was facilitated by his own disposition,
  which was selfish and heartless, and by his ability to submit, when he knew
  it was for his own good, to training and discipline.</p>

  <p>Mary was the next child, and on her fell the full force of the mother's
  theories. Mrs. Wollstonecraft considered it only natural that her eldest
  daughter should be nurse and servant to the other children and drudge at the
  most menial tasks, not only without reward or thanks, but under the continual
  goad of reproach and criticism.</p>

  <p>Soon after his marriage the basic faults of Edward Wollstonecraft were
  increased by his intemperate habits. He developed that capricious
  restlessness so characteristic of the drunkard, and was forever evolving
  fresh schemes, only to abandon them. Quite incapable of perseverance or
  sustained effort, he nevertheless was constantly undertaking enterprises that
  only patient, hard work on his part could have rendered successful.</p>

  <p>Until she was five years of age, Mary resided between rooms in London,
  when the whim took her father to act the part of the gentleman of leisure,
  and the small house in Epping Forest, where he sometimes and for no known
  reason sent his family. He made several spasmodic and unsuccessful
  experiments in business. His father's manufactory was sold at a disadvantage,
  and his own income began to be miserably restricted.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wollstonecraft found herself obliged to part with servants, with
  furniture, with all the luxuries, and gradually with all the comforts of
  life. Still, she kept up a semblance of gentility. She insisted that her
  children should be trained to be genteel and well-bred&mdash;in other words,
  idle&mdash;and she was accepted as an equal by the upper middle-class
  families who resided in the various neighbourhoods to which she moved.</p>

  <p>For some while the whim seized Mr. Wollstonecraft to try his hand at
  farming. He rented a small estate at Barking, and afterwards at other places
  in Essex, where the supplies of fruit and vegetables for the capital were
  largely grown. Some intelligence and industry could easily have made a
  success of this venture, but, as it was, it only increased the poverty and
  disrepute of the Wollstonecraft family.</p>

  <p>They moved, again, to Beverley, in Yorkshire. The farm they had there was
  poorer and their circumstances more wretched than they had been in Essex.
  There the family remained for six years, and in the northern market town the
  three little girls received their only education. The mistresses of the local
  school taught them the accomplishments that were considered necessary for the
  daughters of gentlemen. Mary and Eliza excelled in French, and were quick in
  picking up from every possible source odd scraps of miscellaneous
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>Mary found Beverley much more imposing than the Essex villages to which
  she had been used. It seemed to her a large, fine town, and she thought the
  northern squires and their ladies who gathered there on market day the height
  of fashionable elegance.</p>

  <p>The Yorkshire farm was not profitable, but it had afforded a living to the
  family, given the children wholesome if rough food, and allowed them a
  healthy, open-air life. The remnants of the Wollstonecraft fortune paid for
  the modest school fees of the children and for Mr. Wollstonecraft's vices. He
  was seldom sober. His financial difficulties increased year by year, and he
  vented his sour disappointment in outbursts of fury against his wife, his
  children, his animals. Whip, cane and boot were frequently used against all
  of these, and the sullen furies or violent outbursts of the tyrant were the
  only excitements that varied the lonely monotony of life on the half-derelict
  farm.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wollstonecraft was obliged to dispense altogether with domestic help.
  She herself cooked and scrubbed, knitted and darned, cut and sewed her own
  garments and those of the children. She had little intelligence, less culture
  and education, and, when her animal spirits had fled with her health and her
  happiness, she had nothing left with which to sustain her through the dreary
  labour of the drab days.</p>

  <p>Mary watched her mother shrewdly, helped her all she could, and bore her
  nagging reproaches in silence. She had a better head and more self-control
  than the other two girls. Eliza in particular was inclined to be hysterical,
  and her father's brutalities would often evoke in her a passion of sobs,
  tears or trances of insensibility. The two boys were rough and wild, though
  handsome and robust. Charles, though bold, was sly and insolent, and cringed
  before his father's face, only to revile him behind his back.</p>

  <p>Mary had to find her interests and pleasure in her lessons, in her free
  ramblings with her brothers and sisters over the moors and in reading the few
  books, relics of better times, the residue of the silk merchant's library,
  that she found discarded in boxes in the farmhouse attic. She read these
  diligently, not to obtain any escape into a dream world, for she was without
  fancy, but in order to acquire knowledge.</p>

  <p>When the affairs of the Yorkshire farm became too hopelessly involved for
  even Edward Wollstonecraft's apathy to endure, the family were moved to
  Hoxton, where Mr. Wollstonecraft hoped to engage in business. He was now
  tired of farming, and turned his befuddled attention to commerce. Part of his
  capital had been tied up by his prudent father, and it was only with
  considerable difficulty that he could obtain it. Nevertheless, he had
  squandered piecemeal by far the greater portion of the money that he had
  inherited. Still, enough remained for the family to keep body and soul
  together, and there was a small property in Wales that it was impossible to
  touch and that brought in a meagre income. The fortunes of the
  Wollstonecrafts had sunk considerably since they had last lived in London,
  and it was in an establishment modest even for a small tradesman that Mr.
  Wollstonecraft placed his wife and children in the pretty little village of
  Hoxton. They had sunk, too, in their social position. At Barking they had
  been intimate with the family of Mr. Bamber Gascoyne, a Member of Parliament,
  as in Yorkshire they had had the friendship of a well-placed and substantial
  family, the Allens; but in Hoxton they were obliged to associate with the
  hosier, the grocer, the chandler and the other little tradespeople who
  supplied the village necessaries.</p>

  <p>Their surroundings now were exceedingly humble; their furniture was of the
  roughest description, their clothes of the commonest material, their food of
  the cheapest kind. To purchase books or even the newspapers was not to be
  thought of; no further schooling for any of the children was to be
  contemplated, nor might a visit to any place of amusement&mdash;such as the
  theatre, Ranelagh or Vauxhall&mdash;be for a second entertained. Yet the
  unhappy couple, in disagreement on every other point but this, continued to
  insist that the six children whom they had brought so recklessly into the
  world should be considered too well-born to be trained for any profession or
  trade, though not too good to act as slaves in their parents' home. There was
  no suggestion of finding work for the two growing lads, who became with every
  month more difficult to manage, nor any attempt to train for useful ends the
  obviously exceptional intelligence of Mary and Everina.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>In the little house next door to that rented by the Wollstonecrafts lived
  a curious couple who had the reputation in the village of being eccentric, if
  not insane. The man was a retired Anglican clergyman, deformed and in very
  poor health. Lovingly attended by his devoted wife, he lived in seclusion,
  rarely leaving the books that were his abiding solace. Indifferent to the
  world, and possessed of means small indeed but sufficient for his modest
  wants, the invalid scholar lived contentedly among his mental exercises and
  his spiritual adventures.</p>

  <p>The Clares made the acquaintance of the Wollstonecrafts. The old clergyman
  soon singled out the eldest girl as a child of exceptional ability. She paid
  him long visits, during which she read to him or he read to her, and the
  deformed old man and the bright maiden, both equally unworldly, discussed
  eagerly abstract questions of philosophy, religion and general knowledge. Mr.
  Clare gave Mary lessons in English, in French and history, corrected her
  essays and exercises and allowed her the run of his large miscellaneous
  library. By this means the child was able to create for herself an inner life
  that made her almost independent of the misery of her home. She also
  increased notably in strength of mind and boldness of character; she no
  longer trembled before her father as excessively as did her sisters, but
  often fearlessly defied him and stood between her mother or the other
  children and his violent drunken furies.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wollstonecraft sometimes looked at her eldest daughter with an
  amazement tinged with respect; her younger sisters began to regard her as a
  protectress and useful friend, while the brothers admired her and confided to
  her their wild and hopeless schemes of escape and self-advancement.</p>

  <p>While Mary was at Hoxton, Mrs. Clare took her on a visit to some friends
  of hers who lived on the south side of London at the village of Newington
  Butts. This family, named Blood, consisted of the parents and several
  children; Frances and George, the two eldest, were about Mary's own age. Mr.
  Blood was a hosier in a small way, and it was in the little parlour behind
  the shop that Mrs. Clare introduced Mary Wollstonecraft to the modest
  interior. Fanny Blood was setting the table for her young brothers' and
  sisters' meal. She was a delicate little girl, of a gentle, winning
  expression and a peculiar softness in voice and looks.</p>

  <p>Mary noticed at once the stark poverty of the room that was nevertheless
  most precisely kept. She understood then that Fanny Blood's position was much
  the same as her own. The little girl was the mainstay of a family that her
  father would not, and her mother could not, support. She soon learnt, indeed,
  that the hosier was another Edward Wollstonecraft for drunkenness, violence,
  idleness and unscrupulous self-indulgence.</p>

  <p>Mary was instantly attracted to Fanny, for whom she felt a tender sympathy
  and a warm admiration. As she sat by Mrs. Clare's side in the coach that
  drove them across London to Hoxton, she learnt the unfortunate girl's
  history. Fanny, it seemed, was clever, and contrived somehow to obtain an
  education. Not only was she well read, she could play and sing very
  pleasingly, and had a marked talent for drawing; she was also an exquisite
  needlewoman and an accomplished housewife.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Blood was ailing, dispirited and crushed by the tyranny of her
  husband, so on Fanny had fallen almost the entire burden of the family. By
  her designs for embroidery, her little drawings and paintings, she earned
  enough, supplemented by Mrs. Blood's needlework, to support the penurious
  household.</p>

  <p>On hearing this tale, Mary at once wished to emulate the girl whom she so
  admired, and before she had reached home she was considering eagerly some
  means of making money, for it seemed to her, from whatever angle she viewed
  her problem, that poverty was at the bottom of it. She observed that all her
  family's countless discomforts, humiliations, privations and miseries had
  their root in lack of money. It was the grind of sour poverty that was
  ruining their lives, their characters, and that, as far as she could see,
  would ruin their futures, and in her eager inexperience she foresaw all the
  family troubles disappearing if only she could earn money, if only she could
  make her mother, her sisters and brothers independent of their father's
  wretched fortune.</p>

  <p>Edward had already achieved this independency. He was established as
  assistant to an attorney with offices on Tower Hill, and an assured career
  seemed to lie before him; but Mary knew that he showed no interest in his
  family's difficulties, and that, though he was his mother's favourite and had
  always escaped her sternest severities, he made no offer to help her with the
  burden under which she was slowly succumbing.</p>

  <p>Mary had no desire to earn money for her own benefit; her warm and
  generous nature, so easily moved to pity, was only eager to obtain relief for
  her family. How could she do this? She had not, like Fanny Blood, any talent
  for either music or painting, nor had she any opportunity of being instructed
  in these arts. All that she could hope for in the way of education must be
  obtained from the rambling instructions of Mr. Clare and from the confusion
  of ill-arranged books that weighed down his dusty shelves.</p>

  <p>The eager child had no experience of anything save the vicissitudes of
  poverty. From her mother she had heard tales of another world where life was
  easy and pleasant, where men were kind and women respected, where well-paid
  servants did the menial work and creditors never knocked at the door. Mrs.
  Wollstonecraft had been bred in such a world, and considered that by right
  she belonged to it. She inculcated this belief in her children: they were
  gentlepeople, and it was only by some extraordinary misfortune that they had
  lost their rightful heritage.</p>

  <p>Mary believed her mother's stories in the same way as a child may believe
  a fairy tale&mdash;such things may have happened, but they are not to be
  counted as part of usual experience. Mary was willing to credit her mother's
  statements that she had once worn silk dresses, ridden in her own carriage,
  had a comfortable house, been to theatres and concerts, had money in her
  pocket and a soft bed to sleep on, but she did not believe that any of these
  luxuries would ever come her own way. The hope that she did cherish was that
  she might earn somehow sufficient money to ease that incessant, gnawing
  poverty which to her was as intolerable as it had hitherto been
  unescapable.</p>

  <p>Yet the companionship of the Clares, her new friendship with Fanny Blood
  and her vague though ardent hope for the future gave Mary a certain happiness
  during her second stay in Hoxton. This was shattered by Mr. Wollstonecraft's
  sudden resolve to depart to his small property in Pembrokeshire, and in Wales
  to try once more his hand at farming.</p>

  <p>Such uprooting had been frequent during Mary's childhood; every few years
  there had been the misery and discomfort of changing house, of travelling
  considerable distances over rough roads and in the humblest conditions. Mr.
  Wollstonecraft went on horseback or by coach, but his family had to jolt
  along in rude wagons with the luggage, often in bad weather and with no money
  in their pockets with which to buy food. Each sudden and capricious move had
  meant the abandonment of familiar places, pleasant acquaintances, then
  strange places and people to be faced, some agreeable habits to be broken,
  some cherished objects to be discarded. But no change of residence had caused
  Mary such a pang as this; not only did she have to give up the friendship of
  Mr. Clare and all the hopes she had placed on it, but she had to relinquish
  every chance of seeing Fanny Blood. Even when she lived at Hoxton it had not
  been possible for her to see her new friend often: she never herself had the
  money for the coach fare to Newington Butts, and it was only occasionally
  that Mrs. Clare could take her to that village; but what had been just
  possible in Hoxton would be quite impossible in Wales. Pembrokeshire sounded
  desperately far off, a place of exile, indeed, and Mary had the intelligence
  to see how hopeless it was to suppose that her father, with every month more
  ruined in reputation, prospects, health and character, would succeed in
  anything anywhere.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>To the astonishment of her mother and the admiration of her brothers and
  sisters, Mary protested against the move to Wales. Her expostulations
  provoked nothing but an outburst of senseless wrath from Edward
  Wollstonecraft and stern rebukes from her mother for endeavouring to question
  the paternal fiat.</p>

  <p>Poignant farewells had to be taken of the Clares, the scholar's charming
  little room with the beloved books visited for the last time, a farewell
  letter written to Fanny Blood, and the poor goods and chattels were once more
  packed upon the stage-wagon and the family sent off on the long, tedious
  journey to Wales.</p>

  <p>The neglected farm, Laugharne, of which Mr. Wollstonecraft took
  possession, proved to be as dismal a habitation as Mary had feared. Her
  father had taken no interest in his remote property, which he had never
  visited before and which necessity only had driven him to visit now. The
  district was poor, the scattered neighbours consisted of small farmers and
  peasantry, and Edward Wollstonecraft had no longer any capital to put into
  his random enterprise. His family lived as best they could from hand to
  mouth, Mary and her mother continuing their life of domestic drudgery and the
  younger children running wild when they could escape their mother's
  discipline, their father's slothful anger.</p>

  <p>No one tired of this gloomy exile sooner than Mr Wollstonecraft himself.
  He was a townsman by birth and training, and longed for those squalid
  pleasures of the city in which he had wasted his fortune. He had not,
  however, the money with which to return to London; he was therefore obliged
  to remain at Laugharne and to try to wring out of the poor farm at least
  sufficient money to pay his huge drink bills at the village inn.</p>

  <p>In this wild and lonely place where there were no near neighbours to watch
  or restrain, where there was not the control that might be exercised by the
  public opinion even of a place like Hoxton village, Edward Wollstonecraft
  passed into the last stages of degradation. He was never sober; flasks of
  gin, whisky and brandy were always in his ragged pocket by day and under his
  soiled pillows by night. His habits lost not only all gloss of breeding, but
  all semblance of decency. His outbursts of temper took on a maniacal fury.
  Mary often stood between him and her mother to protect the unhappy woman from
  her husband's murderous assaults, thrusting her father back until the two
  lads could come to the rescue and drag the drunkard aside, using the obscene
  language that they had learned from him.</p>

  <p>Enfeebled health and increasing despair had made Margaret Wollstonecraft
  relax with her younger children much of the severe discipline she had
  maintained with Mary, but she still upheld her principles of filial
  obedience, made no attempt to protect her daughters and sons from their
  father, and still, though more occasionally, rebuked Mary for resisting the
  tyrant.</p>

  <p>The loneliness on the Welsh farm was complete. No news of the outer world
  reached the Wollstonecrafts, who were as cut off from the rest of the country
  as if they inhabited the moon. Mary for long never had in her possession the
  few pence necessary to send a letter to Fanny Blood or the Clares, and Mrs.
  Wollstonecraft had long ceased to communicate with any of the friends or
  acquaintances of her happier days, while twenty years of disastrous married
  life had cut her off from all her relatives at Ballyshannon. The hopes that
  Mary had cherished in Hoxton vanished in Pembrokeshire. She saw her brothers
  imitating their father's habits, she saw her sisters becoming daily more
  nervous, sensitive and uncontrolled; she saw her mother dying as surely as
  the plant that the worm eats at the roots; she saw herself excluded from
  every opportunity or hope of affording assistance to these loved ones; so,
  resigning every cheerful thought, she echoed her mother's muttered
  resignation: "A little patience, and it will all be over," and dwelt on death
  as the only prospect and the only solace. She had been taught by her mother,
  by her schoolmistresses, and by Mr. Clare a conventional, an angelic piety
  founded on a stern and precise theology that hitherto she had not questioned.
  In the moments of her most acute despair she prayed to this formidable and
  fearful Deity for succour, for a chance of escape from Edward Wollstonecraft,
  even if this meant leaving the incredible misery of earth for the incredible
  realms that she had been taught stretched beyond those sullen clouds she saw
  lying purple over the Welsh hills that hemmed her in, emphasising her
  hopeless exile.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The house was quiet, but Mary could not sleep. She took the large volume
  of <i>Paradise Lost</i> from the shelf over her bed and read it by the light
  of the farthing dip that she had made herself from one of the rushes of the
  lake nearby. The descriptions of Paradise only aroused in Mary, hungry, sore
  from her father's blows, lonely and hopeless, a sad contempt. She turned the
  pages, and her tired eyes caught the lines:</p>

  <p>"To whom thus Eve with perfect beauty adorn'd. My Author and Disposer,
  what thou bidst Unargued I obey; so God ordains; God is thy Law, Thou mine;
  to know no more Is Woman's happiest knowledge and her praise."</p>

  <p>Mary knew these lines by heart, but she felt a certain relief in turning
  the pages of the heavy book, in peering at the faded sepia words.</p>

  <p>John Milton thought that God had set men over women, who were to obey them
  without question. Meekness and beauty, then, were all that women needed. Mary
  thought of her mother, of herself and her sisters, and closed the book. The
  ugly, brutal, indecent scenes that she had been forced to witness passed
  before her mind&mdash;all to be endured because she was a woman! She blew out
  the light&mdash;even a rush dip must not be wasted&mdash;crept into bed and
  drew her ragged coverlet over her shoulders. Through the thin partition of
  the patched room she could hear the gross snores of the drunkard who was her
  master, from the loft where her sisters slept, the shrill, nervous cries of
  the two girls in their uneasy sleep.</p>

  <p class="first">THE Wollstonecraft family remained in Wales until Mary was
  eighteen years of age. By shifts and contrivances, by loans and debts, by
  means of the poor produce of the poor farm, they managed to exist. Still, no
  effort was made to find professions or trades for the two wild boys, nor did
  there seem any prospect of husbands for the three undowered girls. Edward,
  who was doing very well for himself, sent neither help nor encouragement, and
  Mrs. Wollstonecraft's health was failing daily, with the result that the
  apathy with which she had so long regarded her family's wretched fortunes
  increased; but Mary grew in intelligence as in stature. She possessed a
  strength of character and a personal charm compounded of sincerity, honesty
  and courage that imperceptibly gained her a position of responsibility,
  almost of authority, in the miserable household. Such efforts as were made to
  raise the family from the depths of squalid poverty were made by Mary, such
  contrivances as brought some system and order into the monotonous days were
  of her contriving, such plans as were made for the dark and uncertain future
  were of her planning. She tried to inspire her two younger sisters with her
  own desire for self-improvement, and they responded eagerly.</p>

  <p>Eliza was clever, with a touch of brilliancy, and Everina was determined
  and industrious. Both were possessed by an agonised resolve to escape from
  the degradation that surrounded them. When the rough work of the primitive
  farm was done and the ailing, scolding mother, the violent, drunken father
  out of the way, the three girls would get down their tattered books, and on
  any scrap of paper and with any ink and pen at hand try to pursue their
  studies. They perfected themselves in the grammar of the French language,
  which thus they were able to read exceedingly well, though they were nervous
  as to their accent. They obtained a fair knowledge of such history and
  geography as was taught in the schools, and they read eagerly the random
  volumes on Divinity, philosophy, poetry, that they found in the attics among
  rags and refuse; they also digested those moral essays written by divines for
  the instruction of the young, without which no library was considered
  complete, and that were indeed purchased in such numbers that it was
  difficult to find a shelf of books without one or two examples of these
  heavy, orthodox attempts to inculcate Christian ethics as understood by
  eighteenth-century clergymen.</p>

  <p>Mary's reason and experience rejected these sonorous platitudes. She had
  only to look around her to realise that much that these painstaking divines
  wrote was false and could not apply to such a life as that which she and her
  sisters led. These fashionable, moral and educational works always assumed
  orderly and well-conducted homes where the father was the honoured and obeyed
  head, the mother the tender and respected guide and friend, households where
  there were servants, carriages and horses, well cared-for pets, good meals on
  the table, good clothes to wear, and round the corner wealthy marriages for
  the girls and satisfactory careers for the boys. Mary, pondering over these
  books, understood how her own parents had completely failed in their duties
  towards herself and her brothers and sisters. Here were six human beings who
  had been brought into the world haphazard by two people who could not provide
  them with the meanest necessaries of life or afford them the cheapest kind of
  education or training. How, then, pay them that respect, deference and
  gratitude which might be all very well for the sons and daughters of
  prosperous, respectable, well-placed people to offer to parents who were
  providing security, comfort, luxury, opportunity?</p>

  <p>Mary closed her heavy volumes, <i>Advice to Daughters and Moral Lessons on
  the Training of Young People</i>, her sermons and essays that had been
  bequeathed to her from the Beverley school days, and decided to treat her
  unorthodox position in an unorthodox manner.</p>

  <p>An unlooked-for circumstance made her task easier than she had ever
  expected it might be. During the loneliness and misery of those years in
  Wales, Edward Wollstonecraft rapidly deteriorated in mind and body. Disease,
  the result of dissipation and intemperance, sapped the strength that had once
  made him so formidable; the bully became the craven. Instead of violent
  scenes with whip and cane, there were maudlin tears and hysteric slobberings;
  the drunkard began to whine instead of threatening; he constantly bemoaned
  his ill-luck, his misfortunes, complained that every one's hand was against
  him, and that he had never had a chance, that he had been cheated by those on
  whom he had relied, that his good nature had been taken advantage of by
  rogues, and that now, in his old age, he was ill, abandoned and bankrupt.
  Though he still had his outbursts of ineffectual fury, he began to appeal to
  the pity of the tall girls and boys whom he had so atrociously ill-treated
  when they were helpless children. He wrote cringing letters to Edward,
  begging him to send money. He suggested crazy expedients to his other sons
  whereby the family fortunes might be repaired, he complained petulantly to
  his daughters because they did not find well-to-do husbands who might combine
  to keep him in ease, and he wept on the bosom of his worn-out and passive
  wife, while he laid all the blame of the bitter failure he had made of his
  life upon his Maker.</p>

  <p>Mary listened, pondered, and decided. She had never forgotten Fanny Blood,
  whose circumstances were so like her own, and who had managed by her almost
  unaided labour to keep her entire family. Mary, when she grew into a certain
  independence on the lonely Welsh farm, had contrived to find the money to
  correspond with Fanny, and had kept alive that warm and tender friendship.
  Mary most ardently desired to follow Fanny's example. She believed that if
  only she could get to London she, too, could earn sufficient money to keep
  her family respectable. She had, too, schemes for her younger brothers. Might
  they not go to Australia or America, those distant and alluring countries
  that were, Mary believed, full of potential riches? Could she not earn the
  few pounds necessary to equip them? Or, if that was not possible, might they
  not become soldiers or sailors? Anything, the valiant girl thought, as long
  as they did not, through disgusting idleness, follow their father's
  example.</p>

  <p>She discussed her plans with her two sisters, and they eagerly agreed. If
  only they could all return to London, they surely could do something for
  themselves. None of them was averse to work; they saw that they must, if they
  wished to escape from their present misfortune, either work or marry.
  Everina, austere and passionless, Mary, absorbed in the problems presented by
  poverty, were averse to matrimony. Both were frightened and disgusted by
  their parents' example, which had nauseated them with domesticity and almost
  with sex; but Eliza, lovely, gentle, inclined to be romantic, had her maiden
  dreams, and indulged those youthful fancies their bitter circumstances had
  withered in her sisters. Nor was she as bold, as resolute as Mary and
  Everina; she shrank from a struggle with the world, and declared frankly that
  she would marry the first man that asked her, for the sake of escaping from
  her home and of obtaining protection and shelter.</p>

  <p>But on the remote Welsh farm no husbands offered themselves to the three
  girls, who had been bred as gentlewomen, taught to consider themselves
  gentlewomen, and who had been nevertheless forced to live as coarse servants.
  All of them were fastidious and high-minded, and considered themselves far
  above the local farmers and the tradespeople of the neighbouring town, who,
  on their side, would never have asked for the hands of the strange, penniless
  girls who did not belong to the neighbourhood, who had no part in any aspect
  of its life, who were proud, refined, and yet who might be seen scrubbing
  pots and pans at the door of the dirty farm or hanging out ragged clothes on
  the line stretched above the filthy yard.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary faced her father, opposing her clear and resolute young understanding
  to his fuddled and broken brain. She urged him to let the farm; in someone
  else's hands the little estate might prove profitable and bring them in a
  little money. She also insisted that they should return to London, where
  surely some member of the family could obtain some manner of work. This
  coincided with Mr. Wollstonecraft's own feelings. His restlessness had
  returned; he was utterly tired of Wales and of farming; he was anxious to
  return to the city that had always been able to offer gratification to all
  his vices. He looked at his five tall, healthy children, with their clear
  eyes and clean-cut features, their grave yet eager faces, and saw in this
  young life and hope something that could be taken to market and trafficked
  for his own benefit. He agreed to return to London; he listened to Mary's
  advice; he even acceded to her terms; she would, she told him, help him,
  perhaps even shoulder his entire responsibilities&mdash;but concessions must
  be made. She would no longer be treated as a child or as a slave, she
  required a certain relief from household drudgery; a room in which she could
  study; her father was not to strike her or abuse her; in front of her and her
  sisters he was to preserve some decency of demeanour. The cowed drunkard
  agreed; he also accepted Mary's suggestions that they should move somewhere
  near the Bloods, who were Mary's sole friends in London.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wollstonecraft had some acquaintances in Walworth. Mary, in trembling
  triumph, wrote to Fanny Blood and begged her to secure the cheapest possible
  house in that district. Laugharne was let to a neighbouring farmer, and the
  few pounds made by the sale of the furniture and farm implements enabled the
  Wollstonecrafts to undertake the hard and monotonous journey to London,
  travelling in the cheapest manner over the rough roads, staying in the worst
  rooms of the cheapest inns, sickened and agitated by Mr. Wollstonecraft's
  constant drunken bouts, complaints and quarrellings. Mary took little heed of
  any of these miseries; she had a fixed goal before her and a fixed hope in
  her heart.</p>

  <p>Fanny Blood received her recovered friend with enthusiasm, and the two
  girls renewed a singularly tender and delicate affection that had only been
  in suspension during their separation. Fanny's circumstances had altered
  little since Mary Wollstonecraft had last seen her.</p>

  <p>This girl, then about twenty-one years of age, was still doing her
  drawing, her painting, her embroidery designs, and the housekeeping and a
  large portion of the housework. The hosier's shop was still kept on as a
  concession to the masculine pride of the nominal breadwinner, the drunken
  father. The mother added a good deal of incompetence and a few shillings
  earned by fine needlework to the home. The younger children were growing up
  and receiving a smattering of education. George, the eldest son, was in the
  London office of a young wine merchant, Mr. Hugh Skeys, who had a prosperous
  business established in Lisbon. George was healthy, attractive, but inclined
  to be rakish. His small salary was insufficient to pay for his own pleasures;
  he was, therefore, quite unable to lighten his sister's burden.</p>

  <p>Mary soon made the close acquaintance of this pleasant young man. She
  liked him without being in the least emotionally affected by him. A desire
  for an independence that would assist her family amounted at this time to an
  obsession: she was as sexless as a child. George, however, on his part was
  soon a little in love with all the slim, auburn-haired Wollstonecraft
  sisters, and in particular fascinated by the austere Everina, who gave him
  not the least encouragement.</p>

  <p>There was hardly any difference between the two homes in which Mary
  Wollstonecraft now spent her time. When she escaped from her own surroundings
  to visit Fanny, she found a replica of her own parents&mdash;the drunken
  father alternating between bullying and whining, the tight-lipped, exhausted,
  scolding mother, the poverty made detestable by masculine vices and
  supportable by feminine respectability, a crowd of young children growing up
  and involving the elder sister in intricate problems and responsibilities.
  Fanny Blood had long since parted with her harpsichord, but
  sometimes&mdash;rarely enough&mdash;she would take Mary to visit a friend who
  had such an instrument, and there Fanny would play and sing while Mary would
  read and study. Fanny had become very sickly after Mary had gone to Wales.
  Every winter she was shaken by a deep cough that did not wholly disappear
  even in the height of summer; her skin had an exquisite transparency; her
  eyes were very lustrous, the lashes long; the delicacy of her looks was
  matched by the eager energy of her spirits; she worked even harder than she
  need, and never seemed to rest.</p>

  <p>Mary soon learned her secret, which was, to the untouched girl, an
  astonishing one: Fanny was in love, and, as it seemed, hopelessly so. In the
  office where her brother worked she had met the young wine merchant, Hugh
  Skeys. They had been mutually attracted to each other, and Mr. Skeys had
  visited the hosier's establishment, at first occasionally, then more
  frequently. He would have been an excellent match for Fanny; he was wealthy,
  sober, industrious, with the manners of a gentleman, attractive and comely.
  To the poor overworked, pleasure-starved girl he was the sun in the sky; she
  trembled when she whispered his name to Mary; to no one else had she breathed
  her trembling hopes. She believed that Mr. Skeys cared for her, but he had as
  yet made no offer for her hand.</p>

  <p>The humiliating truth forced itself on both the anxious girls&mdash;the
  young man hesitated because of Fanny's circumstances, the drunken father, the
  incompetent mother, the brood of wild children, the stark poverty. Not from
  such surroundings as these did well-to-do young merchants choose their
  wives.</p>

  <p>The gentle Fanny acquiesced in this point of view. Marriage with Hugh
  Skeys was beyond her highest ambition; she could but love and droop in
  silence. But Mary was indignant. Here was yet another instance of the wrongs
  that women had to endure at the hands of men. In her opinion, the beloved
  Fanny was far too good for this cold-blooded, hesitant lover. She could not
  understand this fondness that was so balanced by self-interest. How could a
  man look upon Fanny, overworked, failing in health, lovely, good and gentle,
  and not long to snatch her away to repose and the sunshine of the south? Mary
  longed desperately on Fanny's behalf for her marriage with Hugh Skeys and her
  transportation to those temperate climates that were supposed to act like an
  enchantment on a delicate constitution; but all the while she scorned the
  reluctant lover, and a little scorned even her darling Fanny for putting such
  a value upon this unworthy man.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary's circumstances were much improved in London, because she had the
  companionship of Fanny, sometimes that of George, and an occasional visit to
  the Clares at Newington Green, and because she had the stimulus of the
  vicinity of the capital. Nevertheless she soon discovered that the pact made
  with her father was not kept; she was not allowed a room to herself, nor any
  means whereby she could continue her studies; she saw herself, despite her
  utmost efforts, being reduced to a slattern and a drudge, who, when she did
  get a few hours' pleasure, was too exhausted to enjoy them. Her situation
  seemed to her desperate. She learned how difficult it was for any
  one&mdash;especially for a woman&mdash;to earn a living without training,
  friends, or special qualifications. She had many anxious consultations with
  Fanny Blood and with her sisters. None of the Wollstonecraft girls had
  Fanny's talent: they could not draw, sing, play a musical instrument, or
  sketch designs for embroidery, and their needlework was not above the
  ordinary. But Mary refused to admit her helplessness. Cut off as she was from
  all counsel, she appealed to the Clares, and the eccentric old scholar and
  his kindly wife were deeply moved by the girl's profound distress. Her
  situation, as she painted it to them, was terrible. Her mother had obviously
  not long to live; her father's habits in this, the last stage of his
  degradation, were more difficult to endure than his drunken furies; the two
  boys would soon no doubt go out into the world and somehow earn their bread,
  even if they were reduced to that last resort of the destitute&mdash;the
  Navy. But what prospect opened before the three girls, who would not for
  long, without suffering contamination, be able to support the company of
  their father and his acquaintances? The Clares bestirred themselves. They
  could not do much, being themselves only humble folk who lived an
  out-of-the-way life. But Mrs. Clare knew of a well-to-do acquaintance, a
  widowed lady who resided in Bath, whose only relative was a married son. This
  Mrs. Dawson employed a companion or kind of upper servant to wait on her
  infirmities of body and to serve as a butt for her infirmities of mind. This
  lady did not find it very easy to obtain a companion whom she considered
  suitable. She often applied to the Clares, because they lived near London, to
  recommend to her young ladies of unimpeachable character and unexceptionable
  behaviour, who would be willing, for the sake of a meagre board and lodging
  and a few pounds a year, to endure her caprices. Mr. Clare suggested to Mary
  that he should obtain this post for her. Mary accepted eagerly, and the
  affair was soon arranged.</p>

  <p>The eccentric clergyman, by an innocent subterfuge, described Mary
  Wollstonecraft as "a well-educated, well-behaved gentlewoman, the daughter of
  a gentleman of independent means." He did not add what might have been a
  further recommendation to Mrs. Dawson, that the girl was well used to
  privation, toil and submission that amounted to slavery.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary's resolution to leave home was received with dismay by her family.
  Her mother, breaking down the reserve of years, besought her eldest daughter,
  whom she had come to regard as a prop and stay, not to leave her. She wanted
  Mary to stand between her and her husband. The two younger girls were
  terrified at the threatened loss of their sole protector, the two boys
  complained at seeing some of their comforts diminished while Mr.
  Wollstonecraft himself made feeble attempts to exert his authority and
  declared that his daughter should not leave his house. Mary, with cool
  strength of character, resisted all these entreaties, menaces and complaints.
  She was absolutely sure that she could not help her family by remaining among
  them. If she went away there would be one mouth less to feed, one person less
  to clothe, and she would be able every quarter to send her mother a few
  pounds, for she intended to deny herself her entire salary. The only
  advantage she hoped for in thus exchanging one tyranny for another&mdash;for
  she had been well warned by the Clares of the type of woman that Mrs. Dawson
  was&mdash;lay in her intention to obtain a few hours in which she could
  study.</p>

  <p>Fanny Blood approved her friend's resolution. The parting was hard, but
  had become in any case inevitable as the little hosier's business at
  Newington Butts had at last been sold up by weary creditors, and the Blood
  family were moving to Walham Green.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft cut short the farewells, the expostulations, the
  lamentations; she had wrung from her father a few shillings with which to
  equip herself; she had washed, ironed and goffered her kerchiefs and caps;
  she had turned, pressed, darned and mended her gowns and stockings. With all
  her care, her appearance was that of extreme poverty; but she had, in her
  carriage and air, a considerable distinction; she seemed not only a
  gentlewoman, but a rare and graceful creature. She put her few books in a
  satchel, her few clothes in a hair trunk, some jealously guarded coins in her
  slender purse, and stepped into the coach that was to take her to Bath.</p>

  <p>When she left her family and her friends behind and found herself alone
  among strangers on an unfamiliar road, she realised that she had at length
  obtained that for which she had striven and longed&mdash;some measure of
  liberty, some measure of independence, even if it was only the liberty to
  choose her own form of servitude, even if it was only the independence to
  submit to a selected type of suffering. She had no hope of pleasure,
  happiness or excitement; she did not consider the possibility of finding a
  lover, a rich husband, a powerful friend in her new life: her sole ambition
  was still that of earning a few pounds to relieve the misery at home and of
  gaining a few hours in which to improve her own education. She was then
  nineteen years of age, tall and slender, with features that retained their
  infantile softness, and a pale but healthy complexion that goes with auburn
  hair, flushed with rose in the cheeks, and large brown eyes shadowed by
  drooping lids. Her rich tresses were carelessly gathered back under an
  unbecoming cap, her expression was grave and preoccupied. Absorbed in her
  modest ambition, she noticed no one, and few noticed her. Her charms, refined
  and uncommon, were such as did not attract the casual or careless observer;
  she had neither the gay, bouncing prettiness of the servant maid nor the
  polished loveliness of the young aristocrat, and not even those who admired
  and liked her, such as the Clares and the Bloods, had noticed that she gave
  promise of being a beautiful woman.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mrs. Dawson was comfortably off, and lived in a pretentious house in one
  of those elegant crescents and circles that adorn the fashionable city of
  Bath. She kept several servants, some lap-dogs and parrots, and mingled with
  an air of sour disapprobation in the more sedate gaieties of the charming
  city. The medicinal waters that she drank with equal constancy and cynicism
  seemed to have little effect upon her health, and the spectacle of human
  frailties, follies and vice that she beheld every time she went abroad to the
  Pump-room, a concert or a drive had not given her a philosophic temper,
  though it afforded her endless themes for sermonising. Neglected by everyone
  save those whom she paid to endure her imperfections, Mrs. Dawson avenged the
  neglect of the world by a gross tyranny over her dependents. She was never
  able to obtain the services of any but those whom misfortune or incompetence
  had rendered desperate, and even these found her rule insupportable, save for
  a very brief period.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft soon gauged the manner of tyranny to which she had
  submitted herself, but she maintained her resolution that even this was
  better than idleness at home, and, well trained to the endurance of petty
  miseries, she passively accepted the peevish Mrs. Dawson's railings,
  invectives and complaints. The girl was well broken in to the tyranny of a
  petty creature, and in Mrs. Dawson's house she was assured at least of the
  decencies of life. Although she was treated much as an upper servant, her
  bedroom, though one of the worst in the house, was clean and belonged to her
  alone, her meals were regular, the food good, she had no menial work with
  broom, scrubbing brush or pail to perform, and though she was often treated
  both by mistress and by menials with less than respect, her position on the
  whole was that of a gentlewoman, and she did obtain what she most
  desired&mdash;a certain amount of leisure.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Dawson must sometimes sleep, must sometimes go abroad without her
  companion, and on these occasions Mary turned to her books and her studies,
  wrote and thought, translated, criticised the works of others, and began to
  venture to hope that some day she might write herself. She sent numerous
  letters to her mother, to her sisters, to Fanny and to George Blood, and
  every quarter when her salary was paid, after retaining a few shillings for
  her own necessaries, she sent it to Mrs. Wollstonecraft.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary had never seen any place as fine, as carefree, as elegant as Bath. To
  the grey city with the Roman Baths, so gracefully set in the curve of the
  hills, came the most brilliant society of the moment. Statesmen, bishops,
  admirals, generals, their wives and daughters, actresses and authors, wits
  and <i>dilettanti</i>, heiresses and fortune hunters, hard-working people
  enjoying a holiday, people who never did any work at all, exchanging one
  leisured boredom for another&mdash;all these passed along the spacious
  pavements, sipped the waters in the Pump-room, listened to the violins
  playing in the concert hall, showed off to one another's admiration or
  disparagement their silks and satins, their coaches and pages, their horses
  and jewels, and chattered continuously, discussing now with gusto, now with
  apathy, politics, art, intrigues and the aimless malicious gossip of the
  day.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft stood outside this exciting and varied world and did
  not even wish to enter it. She saw girls of her own age being admired and
  courted, young women with no more beauty than she might lay claim to being
  praised and toasted, without envying them; she noted the fine clothes, the
  smart equipages, the numerous servants without desiring them; her thoughts
  were always with her sisters, her mother and with Fanny Blood.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>It was the year 1780. George III had been on the throne for twenty years,
  the lifetime of Mary, and Lord North was his Prime Minister, an office that
  he had held for eight years. For five years a rebellion of the American
  colonies had involved the British in disasters that seemed incredible to the
  Englishman in the street. The defiant Americans had, in engagement after
  engagement, defeated British troops and the German mercenaries hired from
  grasping Electors of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

  <p>The Declaration of Independence had been made in 1776, and in 1780 it
  seemed as if the colonists were likely to be able to enforce it. The conduct
  of the war had not been to the credit of the Government, though honourable to
  many an individual sailor or soldier. Under an honest, narrow-minded King
  anxious to assert the royal power, a well-meaning, timid, fumbling minister
  and a corrupt parliament, was the navy controlled by "Jemmy Twitcher" (Lord
  Sandwich), a traitor and a knave, and an army under a man, Lord George
  Germaine, who was both violent and incapable and who had been cashiered by
  George II for misconduct on the field of battle. Rotten ships that sometimes
  broke under the troops they carried (for instance, the <i>Royal George</i>)
  were sent to sea by the bribed placemen; the war on land was a series of
  criminal blunders, muddles and follies. The respectable King and his amiable
  minister had carried the art of corruption to a greater pitch than ever that
  achieved by the Stuarts, and the Whigs in opposition had passed a resolution
  "that the power of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be
  diminished."</p>

  <p>But on the surface all was placid and had an air of complete stability;
  even the American war was remote, did not personally concern more than a few
  of the population, and was at worst little more than a nuisance to which the
  private citizen grew accustomed. To one outside any knowledge of the real
  state of affairs the country appeared in a static condition. To Mary
  Wollstonecraft everything was as it had been since her grandfather had
  trained his apprentices at Spitalfields in the craft that the refugee
  Huguenots had brought to England in 1688. In the opinion of most people the
  government of Great Britain and the condition of her inhabitants had been
  settled forever when the wealthy Whig middle classes had brought over foreign
  efficiency to regulate a constitution jeopardised by the vagaries of an
  imprudent, reckless and incapable monarch.</p>

  <p>Mary saw around her the neat, sober houses of the middle classes, the
  filthy slums of the poor, the luxurious palaces of the rich, the parson in
  the pulpit, the squire in the manor house, the merchant at his counting-house
  desk, the nobleman in all the positions of power, and the women of every
  class occupied either in frivolous idleness or in domestic drudgery, and she
  never doubted but that all these conditions were permanent. "Soldier, sailor,
  tinker, tailor, beggarman, thief"&mdash;what should one do but accept these
  social distinctions and believe that they would endure forever? Neither did
  Mary question the rigid Theology of her day; no infidel or philosophical
  books had come her way, she had met no one who disputed what her mother had
  taught about God and Sin, Reward and Punishment, the black, flaming pit of
  Brimstone below, the Golden City above.</p>

  <p>The former was easy to credit. Anyone could imagine darkness and fire and
  eternal suffering; Mary herself had shuddered at that possibility of Hell
  which had sent Eliza into hysteric tears again and again, but it was not so
  easy to picture Heaven.</p>

  <p>Mary had but a vague idea of perfect bliss. She could find no coherency in
  the visions of St. John, and her practical mind had no faith in a paradise
  built of precious metal with winged creatures playing harps. She could only
  hope that Heaven would be at least a negation of suffering, peace, a
  dreamless sleep.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile she tried to please God, not only by being dutiful, quiet and
  self-sacrificing, but by regularly attending the services in the Abbey,
  where, squeezed in the back pews behind the hoops and panniers of the more
  fortunate females, she listened to a cosy divine in a cauliflower wig lisping
  of the easier virtues and the more decorous sins.</p>

  <p>Fresh young voices sang stale and gloomy hymns, the enclosed air had a
  graveyard reek, skulls lowered above mural tablets that extolled incredible
  paragons, and here and there the beautiful faces of youth or maiden showed
  amid the diseased and cynic visages of the dull congregation. Mary, in her
  lackey's place, in charge of smelling bottle, muff or reticule, accepted it
  all, and amid her mechanical prayers counted her pence and mourned her
  afflicted dear ones.</p>

  <p>She remained completely outside the social life about her. Had she been
  permitted to enter it, she might have found her place among these people whom
  she regarded with the cold appraisement of an outsider.</p>

  <p>Since she found herself, for no fault of her own, shut out from all that
  was easy or agreeable in life, since she had known nothing but anxiety,
  privation and unhappiness, it was natural that she should judge severely
  those who, through no merit of their own, enjoyed advantages that often
  enough they did not know how to profit by.</p>

  <p>When Mrs. Dawson went to mingle in amusing company or to attend some
  entertainment, Mary was left at home to exercise the lap-dogs, overlook the
  household accounts, mend linen or embroider initials in hair on lawn
  handkerchiefs. When gay or interesting people called at Mrs. Dawson's house,
  Mary was sent out of the withdrawing-room on some errand, either to fetch her
  employer's physic from the apothecary or to match silks or wools at the
  embroidery shop or to take back some garment that had displeased the
  disagreeable old lady to the mantua maker. It was therefore natural that the
  gifted, high-spirited girl should take a dark, even a bitter view of this
  society from which she was so ignominiously excluded.</p>

  <p>Her judgment of her own sex was severe. The women whom she observed about
  her in Bath seemed to her insipid, sensual, selfish and hard; she observed
  that they seemed to have no other end in view than pleasure, and that their
  great aim was husband catching.</p>

  <p>Mary not only disdained them for their vulgar employments, but scorned
  them for their neglect of the poor, who, even in opulent Bath, were
  abundantly evident in a misery that seemed hopeless. Mrs. Dawson's companion,
  who had no means of relieving the distress she saw about her, felt moved to
  an indignant pity at the neglect of those who had time, money and opportunity
  for social service.</p>

  <p>Mary had noticed the squalor of the alleys behind the grandiose squares,
  circles and parades of the smart city, she had observed the poor creatures
  who haunted the doors of the Abbey and the Pump-room on the chance of a coin,
  and she heard from Mrs. Dawson's servants stories of girls turned adrift with
  bastard children to die in ditch or hospital, of the widow and the orphan
  left helpless, and of the depths of degradation from which there was no hand
  to save them. Mary's whole being went out in pity to all who were wretched.
  Fastidious as she was, her strong common sense told her that the vices that
  were the result of hopeless poverty were rather misfortunes than faults.</p>

  <p>Women in distress were peculiarly objects of the poor companion's
  sympathy; she felt for these fallen wretches as warmly as she scorned the
  frivolous ladies who ignored everything but their own interests; she observed
  how completely feminine security, respectability and happiness were in
  masculine power and subject to masculine caprices and vices; she saw how
  difficult it was for a woman to earn a living save at the most menial,
  roughest work, and how impossible for a poor woman, tarnished even by an
  indiscretion, to raise herself out of the gutter, while the sins of a great
  lady were not only condoned, but applauded. Her own passionate desire for
  education led her to remark how untrained women were in everything save the
  accomplishments considered likely to attract men and the intrigues believed
  necessary to deceive them. Mary scorned this slave mentality that tried to
  gain by cunning and cheating what it could not obtain by justice. She was
  shocked at seeing men exalt as goddesses rich, pretty, young and charming
  women, and treat with brutal contempt those who were unprotected, plain,
  elderly or poor and friendless.</p>

  <p>Though she had no knowledge of, and took no interest in, politics, her
  mind had been stirred by the American Revolution and by the Declaration of
  Independence made by the bold colonists. Mary often thought of these men. She
  admired all that she knew of them. They were surely bold, virile creatures,
  very different from the fops and fribbles, paunchy old rakes and sickly young
  fools whom she saw chattering and ogling in the trains of heiresses and
  belles.</p>

  <p>The struggling Americans&mdash;whose final success was yet in
  doubt&mdash;seemed to Mary to represent an ideal people and their country an
  ideal place. She imagined the New World as free from all the faults and vices
  that she saw smirching the Old World. Surely there even the women would enjoy
  some measure of true respect and freedom.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to dream of going herself to the colony at war with
  England, but Mary often planned to send one of her brothers to America when
  she could save the money for his equipment and when affairs should be
  settled.</p>

  <p>No tender episode softened the lonely girl's stay in Bath. Her miserable
  situation, her withdrawal from all social life, her proud reserve prevented
  any man from noticing the uncommon charms of her person and the even rarer
  endowments of her mind and heart.</p>

  <p>This did not trouble her; she was neither romantic nor sentimental; she
  was still undeveloped emotionally and still influenced by the disgust that
  her parents and Fanny Blood's parents had given her of matrimony and of sex;
  she did not desire the homage or the caresses of any of the young officers on
  leave, lordlings <i>en vacances</i>, or esquires taking the waters who had
  come to Bath to find rest, amusement and perhaps a wife.</p>

  <p>None of these stirred either her fancy or her senses; she trained herself
  to despise them all. The only lover of whom she knew, Hugh Skeys, was, in her
  opinion, a contemptible being. Fanny still waited on his hesitancy, still
  toiled and drooped while the rich young man debated whether he could overcome
  his distaste to his beloved's drunken father, pinching poverty and lowly
  station.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary endured the situation with Mrs. Dawson longer than had any of her
  predecessors. She remained two years in Bath supporting the bitterness of
  existence in the service of the detestable old woman with a fortitude that
  gave a slight hardness to her character. She might have remained longer had
  not an urgent letter from Everina brought her servitude to an abrupt end.</p>

  <p>Margaret Wollstonecraft, who had been so long dying, had come at last to
  that peace which she had so often and so ardently desired. Mary was summoned
  to her mother's death bed. Mrs. Dawson would not grant a sudden "holiday," as
  she termed it, so the poor companion accepted dismissal, packed up again her
  few books, her few clothes, and took the London coach.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The Wollstonecraft family had moved from Walworth to Enfield while Mary
  was in Bath. The father had ceased even any pretence at work either in
  agriculture or in commerce. He was living on such sums as the small residue
  of his fortune, largely tied up in the Pembrokeshire estate, afforded, on
  occasional doles from his eldest son, Edward, then established on his own
  account as an attorney on Tower Hill, and on such loans as he could extract
  from the friends and acquaintances of his better days.</p>

  <p>The second son, James, while yet a stripling, had gone away to sea; when
  Mary returned home from Bath there had been no news of him for several
  months. Eliza and Everina remained at home, nursing their mother, who was
  sinking under a complication of diseases, and keeping some air of decency
  over the miserable household, where Charles, the graceless younger brother,
  still idled and pestered his sisters.</p>

  <p>Margaret Wollstonecraft turned to her eldest daughter with gratitude, and
  Mary began the only domestic work she had not yet experienced&mdash;that of
  nursing a sick person. Mrs. Wollstonecraft lingered in sharp torture for
  several months, and Mary was her constant comfort, attending to her wretched
  needs day and night, barring her poor door from the intrusions of her drunken
  husband, soothing the fears of the two younger girls, who, exhausted mentally
  and physically, had no strength with which to withstand this crisis, and
  quieting the noisy Charles by promising him help for his future.</p>

  <p>In the first few days after Mary's return the dying woman dealt with her
  affectionately, and even expressed her regret for her former harshness. She
  acknowledged that she had been wrong in the way in which she had trained her
  children; she thought now, she whispered, that more indulgence and less
  severity would have gilded even their unhappy circumstances with a little
  happiness. But, as she became used to her daughter's presence, the old
  railing spirit returned; the agonising woman regarded Mary's devotion as a
  mere duty, and accepted ungraciously the girl's efforts to soften the rigours
  of poverty and approaching death.</p>

  <p>Mary had no opiates with which to relieve her mother's incessant agony, no
  luxuries with which to beguile the tedium of the long hours of waiting for
  the end. The patient's brief slumbers were often disturbed by quarrels
  between her husband and son, or by the drunken shouts of the companions whom
  Mr. Wollstonecraft brought home, or by Eliza's half-hysterical attempts to
  deal with some importunate creditor. The dying woman repeated so often the
  sentence with which she had formerly consoled her miseries that it became
  imprinted upon Mary's heart and mind: "A little patience, and all will be
  over."</p>

  <p>The girl still put the same interpretation upon these words: it was death
  that would bring peace, God that would offer the final rest. Mary often spoke
  to her mother about God, and the two women consoled themselves with this
  narrow, even angelic, piety&mdash;God, for His own good purposes, had treated
  them thus. God would see that in another world they obtained their reward.
  Neither of them could visualise Heaven; they trusted it was there, with that
  simple faith which no one had as yet tried to undermine. Mary had never even
  heard of anyone who disbelieved in God.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Margaret Wollstonecraft died, and Mary spread the sheet that served as a
  shroud. A few shillings purchased six feet of earth in Enfield Burial Ground,
  and the three sisters, in cheap home-made black clothes, came home from that
  pauper's funeral to face the future.</p>

  <p>Mary was uncommonly self-confident and self-reliant, bold and
  enterprising; but she was then worn by ill-health; the strain of nursing her
  mother had continued for months, and the miseries of her own home had been
  felt by her more acutely after the comparative peace, order and comfort of
  Bath. Anxiety and loss of sleep threw her into a fever, and for several days
  she remained in a state of insensibility on the bed, the only decent one in
  the house, on which her mother had died. Her sisters did what they could.
  Everina became daily more tight-lipped and austere, Eliza more frightened and
  hysterical. Now and then the self-control of both the girls would snap, and
  violent scenes with their father and brother would ensue.</p>

  <p>When Mary dragged herself up after her illness, she felt considerably
  weakened in body, though her resilient spirit was full of courage, and even,
  oddly enough, hope. This illness left her with a slight paralysis in one of
  her eyelids; it always drooped heavily, and gave a peculiar expression to her
  face.</p>

  <p>When she was able to consult again with her sisters, all three decided
  that they must immediately leave their father's house. Within a few weeks of
  his wife's death he had introduced a slatternly mistress. Neither the
  language and habits of this woman, nor the situation, could be endured by the
  three girls.</p>

  <p>They were, however, quite at a loss how to meet the emergency; they were
  untrained as servants, and had neither the appearance nor the manners
  acceptable in cooks or parlourmaids; they were also incapable of any other
  kind of work. It was decided that they must do as Mary had done&mdash;go out
  as companions; but it was impossible at once to find situations. Mary
  suggested as the goal of their utmost ambitions that they might keep a little
  dame-school for small children, but this project was obviously too grand for
  immediate realisation.</p>

  <p>The desperate girls set their wits to work to try to solve the problem of
  escape from their father's impossible establishment. Finally Edward
  Wollstonecraft, with some reluctance, for he forbore as much as possible to
  interfere in family affairs, offered Everina an asylum. The girl's
  independence and the young man's thrift were satisfied with an arrangement
  whereby she was to act as his unpaid housekeeper and upper servant.</p>

  <p>Fanny Blood, still living at Walham Green, offered Mary a temporary home,
  and the charming Eliza, half-laughing, half-frantic, told her sisters that
  she would solve her difficulty by marrying. The lovely girl, then only
  seventeen years of age, had found a man who was willing to take her without a
  penny. He was a young clergyman of the name of Bishop, who held a curacy in
  the neighbourhood. His manners were plausible, even insinuating, his person
  pleasant and his stipend sufficient to provide a comfortable home. It was
  therefore with great relief that Mary and Everina saw their youngest sister,
  always the most difficult, delicate and capricious of the three, thus
  established. Though Mr. Bishop was a chance acquaintance and they knew but
  little of him, his gentle manners, obvious devotion to Eliza, the good
  character he bore in the neighbourhood for decorum and piety, relieved all
  their anxieties about Eliza's future.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary now found herself an inmate of Fanny Blood's home at Walham Green.
  Affairs here were much as they had been before Mary went to Bath. There were,
  however, a few added anxieties to Mr. Blood's drunkenness, George's wildness
  and the long hesitation of Hugh Skeys. The first of these was the conduct of
  Caroline, Fanny's younger sister, who, disheartened by the gloom of her
  sordid home, had fallen into bad company, and distressed her sister by
  behaviour that seemed to promise nothing but degradation and misery. Besides
  her struggles with this wilful young girl, Fanny had to combat George's
  gloom. He had fallen deeply in love with Everina, who was not in the least
  interested in him, and her persistent rejections of his suit caused him, too,
  to take up with idle and worthless companions and to compromise himself in
  many of their scrapes. Mr. Blood was as usual unemployed, Mrs. Blood, more
  incompetent with every month that passed, contributed only a few shillings
  earned by needlework to the family income, and the younger children as ever
  represented a problem and an anxiety.</p>

  <p>Fanny's chief grief, however, was still the behaviour of Hugh Skeys. This
  young man continued to visit her, to speak in vague terms of their future
  together, to address her in lover-like terms, but he had not yet come forward
  as a suitor or proposed marriage. Mary observed with terror that these
  continual distresses had wrought further mischief on Fanny's health, always
  delicate; in particular she was exhausted by the alternate fits of hope and
  despair caused by her lover's behaviour. Anger, attacks of fever, a constant
  cough and bursts of tears as purposeless as they were painful showed the
  state of poor Fanny's mind and heart.</p>

  <p>In order not to be a burden upon her friend, Mary also took in sewing,
  besides helping with the housework and the care of the children. She tried,
  too, to relieve Fanny's other burdens. She remonstrated with George when he
  came home fuddled or noisy, pleaded with Caroline when she wanted to slip out
  with her undesirable friends, soothed Mrs. Blood's railing lamentations and
  hid the Geneva bottle where Mr. Blood could not find it.</p>

  <p>While she and Fanny sat opposite each other near the window in the best
  light the poor room afforded, Fanny drawing and sketching, Mary's nimble
  fingers flying over yards of ruffles and flounces, over shirts, bands and
  collars, over cravats and petticoats, the girl's energetic mind raced into
  the future.</p>

  <p>The dame-school was still all her ambition. She recalled the school at
  Beverley where she and her sisters had been taught, and she visualised such
  another establishment where she and Fanny and Everina could live together in
  peace and respectability. She believed that she had considerable ability for
  teaching; she was well used to managing children. Fanny was accomplished both
  in music and in drawing, and surely Mrs. Blood, withdrawn from her impossible
  husband, could act as housekeeper. Mary saw the four of them taking in
  boarders. Perhaps some ladies, widowed or with husbands at the war, would
  care to live with them. They would, when they began, be content with a very
  cheap house. Furniture would not surely cost much. Mary's mind went round and
  round the problem how the little capital necessary for this enterprise might
  be obtained. But though she and Mrs. Blood stitched and stitched, often far
  into the night, though Fanny sat for hours curved over her drawing-board, the
  three of them could never earn more than enough for the barest necessaries of
  life. There was no question of saving even a few pence a week. Still, even
  the thoughts and the planning were pleasant, and Mary, though this home was
  as tragic as her own, tasted some austere happiness in the company of her
  friends, in her own constant work, and in her dearly cherished hopes for the
  future.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>It was soon noticeable to the anxious Mary that her sister's hasty
  marriage was not successful. Eliza, though intelligent and with much that was
  naturally noble and honest in her disposition, was yet suspicious, violent,
  oversensitive and completely without pliability or tact. She had married,
  too, without either thought or affection and with the sole object of escaping
  from her father's company and of securing for herself some kind of a shelter
  and a maintenance. She did not know how to manage an orderly household or
  respectable servants, or how to adapt herself to her husband's humour. Worn
  out by the struggles of her childhood, she had hoped in this marriage for
  ease and peace, and found all duties and all restraints irksome. On the other
  hand, Mr. Bishop, who had seemed so gentle and agreeable, proved to be as
  violent, suspicious and difficult to live with as was his unhappy young wife.
  Although abroad the young clergyman appeared well-bred, dignified and
  amiable, at home he was rude, tyrannical and disagreeable, while his slovenly
  habits and frequent attacks of ill-health aroused in Eliza, already disgusted
  through her father with these human frailties, a passion of protest.</p>

  <p>As frequently as their restricted means would allow, Mary and Fanny
  visited this disgusted household. The one male friend in whom they had even a
  little trust, Hugh Skeys, was asked by the two girls to remonstrate with Mr.
  Bishop and beg him to have more patience with his young wife, while Mary and
  Fanny tried to soothe and encourage Eliza to make yet another attempt at some
  kind of happiness.</p>

  <p>The situation seemed, however, impossible; both husband and wife had
  complex characters. Mr. Bishop was by no means always unreasonable. He was,
  indeed, able to persuade even Mary, Fanny and Hugh Skeys that his wife was
  chiefly to blame in their continual domestic troubles. He could, when he
  chose, be very beguiling and insinuating, and the worst of his furies were
  seen by no one but Eliza herself. He was a sensual man and fond in his way of
  the young girl whom he was tormenting. Their stormy disputes would be
  followed by violent reconciliation, and Eliza was caressed one moment to be
  insulted the next.</p>

  <p>After three years of this existence, Eliza being then but twenty years of
  age, while Mary was still living with Fanny at Walham Green and Everina
  continued her work as housekeeper to Edward, the prospect of a child seemed
  to offer a permanent reconciliation in the Bishop household. The wiseacres
  said that paternal responsibility and maternal solicitude would combine to
  save the wreckage of this marriage. At this period Mary and Fanny had, as the
  result of three years' work and with some help from Everina's economies and
  from George's savings, put together a tiny capital towards the school. It was
  no more than a few pounds, but it represented in the young women's eager
  estimation the nucleus of a fortune that would mean independence and ease.
  Fanny had now dismissed all hope of marriage with Hugh Skeys. He still
  remained an attentive friend, and she hoped for nothing more than this
  detached if occasionally tender devotion. She had fought down her frustrated
  desire, her desperate longing, and leant upon Mary's friendship with
  increased eagerness.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the two girls' keen discussion of their future plans and
  schemes came the news that Eliza's affairs had reached a crisis. Her constant
  quarrels with her husband, her inability to create any kind of method in her
  life, her state of health, her nervous, excitable temperament, had all
  combined to produce in the unhappy creature a state of dementia. Mr. Bishop,
  who declared himself ill and distracted, appealed to his wife's sisters for
  help. It was impossible for Everina to leave the post she had accepted with
  Edward without offending the useful brother, and therefore it fell to Mary to
  abandon all her plans for the future and to devote herself to her sister.
  She, therefore, after a sojourn of three years, left the house of the Bloods
  in Walham Green and returned to Enfield where Eliza Bishop lived with her
  husband in a flat-fronted, red brick house with a white portico, three
  holystoned steps, muslin curtains at the window and a brass knocker on the
  door.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bishop welcomed his sister-in-law with mingled tears, reproaches and
  lamentations, all the evidences of a weak, disordered mind. He blamed his
  wife, his circumstances, everybody and everything save himself for the
  failure of his affairs. Mary regarded him with a contempt that touched
  loathing. This was the third unhappy marriage that she had witnessed, and in
  each case she imputed the main fault to the man. She knew that Eliza was
  difficult and had married for no very worthy motive, but loyalty to her sex
  and to her sister kept her firmly to the opinion that Mr. Bishop was chiefly
  to blame for the horrors of a marriage that too closely resembled that of her
  own parents and that of the Bloods. Horrors was not too strong a word. When
  she entered her sister's presence Mary found herself confronting a creature
  violently deranged. The approach of her confinement added to her distress and
  to her danger as she tossed, half naked, in the curtained tester-bed. The
  ignorant ministrations of a frightened midwife only increased the poor girl's
  fears and whims. She recognised Mary, who, however, could not produce any
  relief in her spirits or any order in her intellect. Eliza's blanched cheeks,
  staring eyes, tangled hair and chattering speech were, to her sister, truly
  shocking.</p>

  <p>She began to pour out a wild, incoherent tale of her wrongs and
  grievances, entreated Mary to keep Mr. Bishop out of her room, and presently
  began to tear her cap, hair and nightsmock in a frenzy. It was necessary to
  send for the apothecary to come and assist the agitated and incompetent
  midwife. A heavy dose of laudanum was administered after a struggle to Eliza
  Bishop, and Mary, when her sister was in a drugged calm, sat down and by the
  light of the candle wrote with a trembling hand to Everina. To add to the
  discomfort of the wretched household, the weather was intensely cold; the
  water froze in the basins and pails, a black frost made the streets almost
  impassable; it was difficult, even with a large fire, to warm the
  uncomfortable, draughty room.</p>

  <p>Mary wished to go to Tower Hill and see her brother and sister, to consult
  what should be done for Eliza, but the severe weather made this impossible.
  She therefore remained with what patience she could muster in the Bishops'
  home, standing by Eliza during her raving fits or listening with a contempt
  that she could scarcely conceal to Mr. Bishop's alternate tearful excuses and
  violent reproaches. As a scandal was at all costs to be avoided, friends and
  neighbours were kept from the house, where Mary remained on guard, stern,
  exhausted but resolute. Her contempt detached her from the passions that
  surged round her nervous efficiency.</p>

  <p>A sudden thaw made it possible for her to travel to Tower Hill. Her
  brother received her coldly. He seemed, as usual, merely desirous of washing
  his hands of all the family affairs, and quite indifferent to Eliza's fate.
  Everina was disturbed and anxious, but could offer no advice&mdash;and,
  penniless as she was, no help. Edward's housekeeping allowances were of the
  most meagre kind, and it was with difficulty that his sister could squeeze
  out of them sufficient to buy herself the barest necessaries for her own use,
  and it had been at the cost of food, soap and candle for herself that she had
  been able to contribute to the little hoard the three girls were making
  towards their proposed school. Mary therefore returned through the dirty,
  wet, dark streets to the Bishops' house without either help or comfort.</p>

  <p>Urged by Fanny Blood, Hugh Skeys had visited the distracted establishment.
  He was of little use to Mary, and seemed indeed rather inclined to sympathise
  with the husband. Shortly after she had seen her sister, Mary wrote again to
  Everina. Things had been, the last few days, a little better. The
  apothecary's laudanum had kept Eliza more or less in a state of subjection,
  and Mary had even put on her mantle and hood, and taken her for a short drive
  in a hired coach that she might enjoy a little fresh air in the intervals
  between the snowstorms:</p>

  <p>"I expected to have seen you before this, but the extreme coldness of the
  weather is a sufficient apology. I cannot yet give any certain account of
  Bess...She has not had a violent fit of frenzy, since I saw you, but her mind
  is in a most unsettled state and attending to the constant fluctuation of it
  is far more harassing than watching those raving fits that had not the least
  tincture of reason. Her ideas are all disjointed and a number of wild whims
  float on her imagination and fall from her unconnectedly, something like
  strange dreams when judgment sleeps and fancy sports at a fine rate. Don't
  smile at my language, for I am so constantly forced to observe her&mdash;lest
  she run into mischief&mdash;that my thoughts continually turn on the
  unaccountable wanderings of her mind. She seems to think she has been very
  ill-used, and, in short, till I see some more favourable symptoms, I shall
  only suppose that her malady has assumed a new and more distressing
  appearance."</p>

  <p>All Mary's own affairs had to remain in suspense while she watched the
  fluctuations of her sister's desperate illness. As she was not able to work,
  she was obliged to use her slender savings in order to spare herself the
  mortification of going to her brother-in-law for daily pence. A dismal
  Christmas passed, and after a month of her harassing responsibilities Mary
  wrote this letter to Everina shortly after Eliza had given birth to a
  daughter during painful scenes of fear, agony, reproaches and passion that
  had upset midwife and apothecary and almost shaken Mary's high courage:</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to do. Poor Eliza's situation almost turns my brain. I
  can't stay and see this continual misery, and to leave her to bear it by
  herself without any one to comfort her is still more distressing. I would do
  anything to rescue her from her present situation. My head is quite confused
  with thus being to so little purpose. In this case something desperate must
  be determined. Do you think Edward will receive her? Do speak to him, or if
  you imagine that I should have more influence on his mind, I will contrive to
  see you, but you must caution him against expostulating with or even
  mentioning the affair to Bishop, for it would only put him on his guard and
  we should have a storm to encounter that I tremble to think of. I am
  convinced that this is the only expedient to save Bess, and she declares she
  would rather be a teacher than stay here. I must again repeat it, you must be
  secret, nothing can be done till she leaves the house. For his friend Wood
  very justly said that he was 'either a lion or a spaniel.' I have been some
  time deliberating on this, for I can't help pitying B, but misery must be his
  portion at any rate till he alters himself, and that would be a miracle.</p>

  <p>"To be at Edward's is not desirable; of the two evils she must choose the
  least. Write a line by the bearer or by the post to-morrow&mdash;don't fail.
  I need not urge you to use your endeavours; if I did not see that it was
  absolutely necessary I should not have fixed upon it. I tell you she will
  soon be deprived of reason. Bishop cannot behave properly and those who would
  attempt to reason with him must be mad or have very little observation. Those
  who would save Bess must act and not talk."</p>

  <p>This letter was the outcome of a long and deeply anxious deliberation,
  which Mary, who had no one to consult with, had made in her own reeling
  mind.</p>

  <p>The child, who had been at once baptized, had been named Maria in
  compliment to her distracted aunt. After this crisis had passed the young
  mother had become somewhat calmer and had told her sister with great emphasis
  that she could not endure to live any longer with her husband. He, on his
  part, had told Mary that he would not allow his wife under any conditions to
  leave him. All her experience, her own instinct and the circumstances of the
  present case combined to persuade Mary to take what was a very daring
  resolution. She decided that Eliza must leave her husband, her home and her
  baby and join Fanny, Everina and herself, in whatever common enterprises they
  undertook. Mary had for the moment nothing to offer Eliza; therefore she
  suggested that she should seek a temporary asylum with her brother Edward;
  but she was certain that she must at all costs leave her husband's house.</p>

  <p>A more intimate acquaintance with Mr. Bishop had convinced Mary, already
  deeply prejudiced against him, that his was the main fault in these
  intolerable quarrels, and she had given up early any attempt to reason with
  him, seeing him equally rooted in his vices and his points of view. It was,
  however, impossible for Eliza to be moved until she had recovered some
  strength, and&mdash;on a Monday morning in January, 1784&mdash;Mary wrote
  again to Everina:</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to tell you, my dear girl, that will give you pleasure.
  Yesterday was a dismal day, long and dreary. Bishop was very ill; he is much
  better today, but misery haunts this house in one shape or other. How
  sincerely do I join with you in saying that if a person has common sense,
  they cannot make one completely unhappy. To attempt to lead or to govern a
  weak mind is impossible; it will ever press forward to what it wishes,
  regardless of impediments, and, with a selfish eagerness, believe what it
  desires practicable, though the contrary is as clear as the noonday. My
  spirits are hurried with listening to pros and cons, my head is so confused
  that I sometimes say no when I ought to say yes. My heart is almost broken
  with listening to B while he reasons the case. I cannot insult him with
  advice, which he would never have wanted if he was capable of attending to
  it...Bishop has made a confidant of Skeys; and as I never speak to him in
  private I suppose his pity may cloud his judgment...I expect Fanny next
  Thursday, and she will stay with us for a few days. Bessie desires to give
  her love; she grows better, and, of course, is more sad."</p>

  <p>Eliza had not recovered sufficient strength for Mary to venture to put her
  plan into action. She had well weighed all the consequences. She knew what a
  daring, desperate, almost immoral step it was considered for a wife to leave
  her husband under any circumstances. She realised that Mr. Bishop was
  exceedingly plausible and could make out a good case for himself; she knew
  that he was resolved not to lose his victim; she knew her own penniless,
  defenceless condition and the dark uncertainty of the future. But for all
  that, and after she had well counted the cost, she resolved to cut through
  all these emotional scenes of reproaches, recriminations, the pros and cons,
  as she termed them herself, of this wretched marriage, and to give her sister
  at any price some measure of peace and liberty.</p>

  <p>The escape was arranged with Fanny Blood, who came on a brief visit. Eliza
  was unable to nurse her child, which had been taken from her and placed in
  the care of a woman who resided in another apartment. Mary's energy and
  courage were quite equal to taking the baby away with her sister, but it was
  impossible for her to obtain possession of it without arousing the suspicion
  of the nurse. She knew that Mr. Bishop would make capital of this
  point&mdash;that his wife had abandoned her young baby. She believed, too,
  that Eliza would grieve after the little girl, but she took all these risks,
  accepting the full responsibility of this bold action.</p>

  <p>The girls made their plans and waited for their opportunity. It came when
  Mr. Bishop went abroad on a clerical errand that would, they knew, occupy him
  several hours. Eliza's personal belongings were then quickly packed and taken
  out of the house in boxes and parcels by Fanny Blood, who deposited them in
  the care of a humble friend, a Mr. Lear, who had a colourman's shop in the
  Strand next <i>The White Horse</i>, from whom she bought her paint brushes
  and drawing pens. As soon as Fanny had left the house and all was quiet, the
  grey winter morning clouds spreading a pall over the huddled village with the
  bare trees, the two sisters&mdash;Mary carrying a few necessaries in a
  bundle&mdash;slipped out of Mr. Bishop's respectable brick-fronted house,
  walked briskly with as casual an air as they could command through the
  winding street between the bare hedgerows to the next posting stage, where
  they took the afternoon mail to London.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary had carefully arranged the escape so as to cover up her tracks.
  Through Fanny and George Blood she had hired rooms at Hackney under an
  assumed name. Here, by tortuous stages, she proceeded, arriving at the mean
  refuge of the poor furnished apartment as the pallid dusk was falling. The
  adventure had required courage and good sense, for Eliza had shown neither.
  Everything had fallen upon Mary: the arranging the exchange of coaches, the
  hiring of carriages, the payments and the tales necessary to soothe the
  suspicions of strangers as to the reason for this hasty travelling on the
  part of two unprotected women. On every occasion during that dreadful day
  when the two sisters were alone in an inn parlour as they waited for a coach
  or in the musty interior of a hired carriage, Eliza had given way to violent
  bursts of hysteria, which terrified Mary, who thought they were signs of
  complete insanity. When, however, they were safe in the dingy, dusty lodging,
  Eliza fell almost at once into a sleep of profound exhaustion. Mary drew the
  darned curtains round her sister's bed, sat down at the rickety table by the
  window that looked on to the common inn with the crude sign of the
  fish-tailed woman, unpacked her quill, inkhorn, and a sheet of paper, and
  wrote to Everina as a nervous relief to her own fear and apprehension.
  Despite her courage and self-reliance, she was young and inexperienced enough
  to feel some quivering of the nerves at what she had undertaken. For all she
  knew, she had committed an illegal action in taking a wife from her husband,
  and both she and Eliza might in the outcome find themselves in Newgate.</p>

  <p>"Here we are, Everina, but my trembling hands will scarce let me tell you
  so. Bess is much more composed than I expected her to be. To make my trial
  still more dreadful I was afraid in the coach that she was going to have one
  of her flights, for she bit her wedding ring to pieces. When I can recollect
  myself I will send you particulars; but at present my heart beats time with
  every carriage that rolls by and a knocking at the door almost throws me into
  a fit. I hope Bishop will not discover us, for I could sooner face a lion.
  The door never opens but I expect to see him panting for breath. Ask Ned how
  we are to behave if he should find us out, for Bess is determined not to
  return. Can he force her?&mdash;but I'll not suppose it, yet I can think of
  nothing else. She is sleepy and has gone to bed; my agitated mind will not
  permit me. Don't tell Charles or any creature. Oh! let me entreat you to be
  careful, for Bess does not dread him now as much as I do. Again, let me
  request you to write, as Bishop's behaviour may silence my fears. You will
  soon hear from me again. Fanny carried many things to Lear's, brushmaker, in
  the Strand, next door to <i>The White Hart</i>. Yours, Mary."</p>

  <p>The names and address were added by Mary&mdash;"Miss Johnson, Mrs. Dodds,
  opposite <i>The Mermaid</i>, Church Street, Hackney."</p>

  <p>"She looks now very wild. Heaven protect us!</p>

  <p>"I almost wish for a husband, for I want some one to support me."</p>

  <p>A few days later Mary again wrote from her hiding place, where the two
  girls were living in solitude and poverty:</p>

  <p>"Your welcome letter arrived just now, and we thank you for sending it so
  soon. Your account of Bishop does not surprise me as I am convinced that to
  gratify the ruling passion he could command all the rest. The plea of the
  child occurred to me and it was the most rational thing he could complain of.
  I know he will tell a plausible tale and the generality will pity him and
  blame me, but, however, if we can snatch Bess from extreme wretchedness, what
  reason shall we have to rejoice. It was indeed a very disagreeable affair and
  if we had stayed a day or two longer I believe it would never have been
  effected, for Bess's mind was so harassed for fear of being discovered and by
  the thought of leaving the child that she could not have stood it long. I
  suppose Bishop told you how we escaped; there was as much good luck as good
  management in it. As for Bess, she was so terrified that she lost all
  presence of mind and would have done anything. I took a second coach to
  prevent him tracing us...Bess is tolerably well; she cannot help sighing
  about little Mary whom she tenderly loved; and on this score I both love and
  pity her. The poor brat! it had got a little hold on my affections, sometime
  or other I hope we shall get it. Yesterday we were two languid ladies and
  even now we have pains in all our limbs and are as jaded as if we had taken a
  long journey...Tell my brother that Bess is fixed in her resolution of never
  returning. But what will be the consequence? And if a separate maintenance is
  not to be obtained, she'll try to earn her own bread. We carried off almost
  all our clothes, but we have no linen. I wish you would contrive to send us a
  few changes at the first opportunity, it matters not whom they belong to. We
  have neither chemise, handkerchief, nor apron, so our necessities are
  pressing."</p>

  <p>The affair turned out much as Mary had foreseen it would. Mr. Bishop posed
  as the injured party, complained to his wife's relatives of her desertion,
  demanded her return, and pointed out the heartless cruelty of leaving him
  with a child only a few weeks old. His manners impressed everyone in his
  favour, and it was generally felt by those who knew of the case that Mary had
  done a rash and unwarranted action in separating husband and wife. Even old
  friends of Mary's, like the Clares, were disposed to side with Mr. Bishop and
  to suggest a reconciliation with his Eliza. Only Fanny staunchly supported
  Mary's point of view.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the two young women remained in hiding at the Hackney lodgings,
  living meagrely on the remnants of Mary's savings, now dwindling so fast that
  the resolute girl was forced to look to the future and again to the prospect
  of the school. She wrote a long letter about this scheme to Everina:</p>

  <p>"With economy we can live on a guinea a week, and that we can with ease
  earn. The lady who gave Fanny five guineas for two drawings will assist us
  and we shall be independent...If Ned makes us a little present of furniture
  it will be very acceptable, but if he is prudent we must try to do without
  it. I knew I should be the shameful incendiary in this shocking affair of a
  woman leaving her bedfellow, they thought the strong affection of a sister
  <i>might</i> apologise for my conduct, but that the scheme was by no means a
  good one. In short, 'tis contrary to all the rules of conduct that are
  published for the benefit of new married ladies, by whose advice Mrs. Brook
  was actuated when she in grief of heart gave up my friendship. Mrs. Clare,
  too, with cautious words disapproved of our conduct, and were she to see
  Bishop might advise a reconciliation."</p>

  <p>Fanny Blood, however, who had not Mary's courage and confidence, was
  terrified at the idea of their living together without any outside support,
  and on February 18th, 1784, she wrote from Walham Green her doubts and fears
  to Everina Wollstonecraft, who was still living with Edward:</p>

  <p>"My dear Everina, the situation of our two poor girls grows more and more
  desperate. My mind is tortured about them because I cannot see any possible
  resource they have for a maintenance. The letter I last night received from
  Mary disturbed me so much that I have never since closed my eyes and my head
  is this morning almost distracted. I find she wrote to her brother informing
  him that it was our intention to live all together and earn our bread by
  painting and needlework, which gives me great uneasiness as I am convinced
  that he will be displeased at his sisters being connected with me, and the
  forfeiting his favour at this time is of the utmost consequence...The very
  utmost I can earn one week from another, supposing I have uninterrupted
  health, is half a guinea a week, which would just pay for furnished lodgings
  for three people to pig together. As for needlework, it is utterly impossible
  they could earn more than half a guinea a week between them supposing they
  had constant employment, which is of all things the most uncertain...I own
  with sincere sorrow that I was greatly to blame for ever mentioning this
  plan..."</p>

  <p>Fanny had her own anxious suggestion to make, and that was that Edward
  should advance the capital for them to take and stock a small haberdashery
  shop. The poor girl had it in her head that this important brother was
  regarding his sisters coldly because of their association with her, for Fanny
  considered herself disgraced by the behaviour of her sister Caroline, who had
  now thrown over all pretences of respectability, and was what gentlewomen
  were trained to call "a lost woman." Therefore Fanny, in her sorrow and
  humiliation, added:</p>

  <p>"If your brother should be averse to assisting them from a notion that I
  should live with them, I wish you would take the earliest opportunity of
  assuring him from me that on no account whatever will I ever live with them
  unless fortune should make me quite independent, which I never expect..."</p>

  <p>Edward Wollstonecraft showed no desire to rent and stock a haberdasher's
  shop for his sisters, or to help them in any practical way; on the contrary
  he, in common with all their friends and acquaintances, set his face against
  their conduct, which had caused a general outcry among their small circle of
  orthodox acquaintances.</p>

  <p>Forced to remain in hiding as if they had committed some crime, with very
  little money and insufficient clothing, using assumed names and remaining
  indoors until after dark for fear of discovery, the two girls paid to the
  full the penalties for the unconventional gesture of independence.</p>

  <p>There was a good deal of openly expressed sympathy for Bishop. Many of
  their acquaintances, and the Mrs. Brook whom Mary mentioned in her letter,
  entirely withdrew their countenance from the rebels. Even good Mrs. Clare was
  cautious. From no one was any financial assistance forthcoming. Mr. Bishop
  refused to contribute a farthing to the needs of Eliza till she returned to
  his home.</p>

  <p>Affairs remained at a standstill for months, but Mary continued firm.
  Edward's legal knowledge was called upon, and he and Everina induced Mr.
  Bishop finally to agree to a legal separation from his wife. This news was
  hailed with the greatest joy by the two young women. Eliza was now free from
  her tyrant; that is, she was at liberty to support herself by whatever means
  she could find. She remained the wife of Mr. Bishop, bound for life to a man
  whom she hoped never to see again. As she was but twenty years of age, this
  might have seemed a dismal prospect. The two sisters were, however, for the
  moment completely happy, their only cause for regret being the little Mary
  whom her mother had been forced to abandon.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The teaching scheme was at last put to the test. Mary and Eliza moved to
  Islington, where the Bloods were then living, and opened a little dame-school
  for infants and children. No one came, and the girls moved to Newington
  Green, where the Clares could give them introductions. The burden of these
  classes, which were held in one of the rooms of the small house where all
  lived, and therefore required no capital beyond that sufficient to buy a few
  books, fell upon Mary, because Fanny herself became from day to day more
  sickly, and Eliza soon fell into her old moods and distractions. Much
  assistance was forthcoming from George, who had returned to London and taken
  a position with an attorney named Palmer. He lived at home and made Mary his
  <i>confidante</i> in his hopeless passion for Everina, while helping her in a
  practical fashion with her meagre accounts, debts and purchases.</p>

  <p>After the little school had struggled on for a year Mary lost, under
  different circumstances, both brother and sister. Hugh Skeys suddenly took it
  in his head to offer his hand to Fanny, whose forlorn state and exemplary
  patience under his procrastination seemed of late to have roused his
  compassion. They were married, and the young merchant took his enraptured
  wife with him to Lisbon. Mary saw her friend depart with true rejoicings at
  her happiness, but with a continued contempt for the lover who had delayed
  perhaps too long.</p>

  <p>Soon after Fanny Skeys had gone to Lisbon, George fell into serious
  trouble. This unhappy home had now been finally broken up. Caroline, who was
  considered to have disgraced her family, was leading a vicious life; Mr.
  Blood had been found meagre employment in a stocking business in London
  through the influence of Hugh Skeys. George was honest and respectable and
  kept steady by his passion for Everina, but he became, through no fault of
  his own, involved in sordid misfortunes. The rascally attorney who employed
  him had foolishly forged some documents for a client, a Mrs. Jones, whereby
  this lady was falsely represented to be a clergyman's widow and her son
  enabled to enter a charity school run for the orphans of the clergy. This
  fraud being discovered, Mr. Palmer was arrested, tried and sentenced to
  death. George, as his clerk, was implicated. His innocence was with some
  difficulty proved, but he was quickly in another trouble.</p>

  <p>No sooner was the Palmer establishment broken up by the arrest of the
  master than one of the servant girls employed there falsely declared George
  Blood to be the father of her child. All these painful and sordid troubles
  fell upon Mary, whose health at this time was bad. George's father also added
  to her burdens by losing his job and beseeching her to find him another; he
  wanted to go to Ireland, where he had relatives. Constables hung about the
  little school watching for George, who, not knowing what he had to face,
  remained hidden.</p>

  <p>Mary, however, was not daunted. George, acting on her advice and
  encouraged by her friendship, fled to Ireland, where he soon picked up a
  living, though in the humblest way. Soon after his hurried departure from
  England, a few months after Fanny's marriage, Mary wrote to George:</p>

  <p>"The pleasure I felt at hearing of your safe arrival in Ireland was a good
  deal damped by the account you gave of the captain's brutality. By this time
  I hope all the effects of so disagreeable a voyage have gone off, except your
  being a little weatherbeaten or so, but you and I don't think that of much
  consequence...It would give me great pleasure to hear there was any chance of
  getting some employment. In the meantime, give way to hope, do your duty and
  leave the rest to Heaven. Forfeit not that sure support in the time of
  trouble, and though your want of experience and judgment may betray you into
  many errors, let not your heart be corrupted by bad example, and then, though
  it may be wounded by neglect and torn by anguish, you will not feel that most
  acute of all sorrows, a sense of having deserved the miseries that you
  undergo. Palmer has been respited, and of course will be pardoned. I have
  made many inquiries concerning the affair that alarmed us so much and find
  that Palmer's servant has sworn a child to you and it was on that account
  those men came to our house. The girl was waiting in a little ale-house near
  us, so that if you had stayed you would have been involved in a pretty piece
  of business that your innocence would not have extricated you out of...How
  troublesome fools are! Mrs. Campbell, who has all the constancy that attends
  on folly and in whose mind when any prejudice is fixed it remains for ever,
  has long disliked you, and this confined ill-humour has at length broken out
  and she has sufficiently railed at your <i>vices</i> and the
  <i>encouragement</i> I have given them...I have been very ill and have gone
  through the usual physical operations, have been bled and blistered, yet
  still am not well; my harassed mind will in time wear out my body. I have
  been so hunted down by cares and see so many that I must encounter that my
  spirits are quite depressed. I have lost all relish of life and my almost
  broken heart only cares for the prospect of death. I may be years dying tho',
  and so I ought to be patient, for at this time to wish myself away would be
  selfish...Adieu to the village delights. I almost hate the Green, for it
  seems the grave of all my comforts. Shall I ever again see your honest heart
  dancing in your eyes?"</p>

  <p>Mary had taken over the little house, and was running the school at
  Newington Green with the help of Eliza and Everina, who had left her
  unpleasant position with Edward. Soon after George went to Ireland she took a
  larger house on the Green. She had, besides twenty day pupils, one or two
  boarders who had brought their children to the little establishment to be
  educated. Among these was the Mrs. Campbell referred to in the above letter
  who was a distant relation, a narrow-minded and disagreeable woman whom Mary
  found it hard to tolerate and who was continually quarrelling with the
  tactless Eliza.</p>

  <p>In the same month&mdash;July, 1785&mdash;Mary wrote again to George
  Blood:</p>

  <p>"It gives me sincerest satisfaction to find that you look for comfort
  where only it is to be met with, and that Being in whom you trust will not
  desert you. Be not cast down while we are struggling with care, life slips
  away, and through the assistance of divine grace, we are obtaining habits and
  virtues that will enable us to relish those joys which we cannot now form any
  idea of...I have no creatures to be unreserved to. Eliza and Everina are so
  different that I could as fly as open my heart to them. How my social
  comforts have dropped away. Fanny first, and then you went over the hills and
  far away. I am resigned to my fate, that gloomy kind of resignation tinged
  with despair. Your affectionate friend, Mary."</p>

  <p>As the above letter hints, Mary's troubles were augmented by a growing
  coldness between herself and her sisters. Everina was austere and reserved,
  Eliza wilful and passionate. Both, without actually saying so, seemed to
  blame Mary for the break-up of the Bishop marriage. They considered her bold
  and independent to an unwomanly degree, and both of them resented her
  authority in the management of the affairs that they were so incapable of
  dealing with themselves. Mary's main pleasure during the tedium of these dull
  days consisted in the packets of letters that Fanny sent from Lisbon. On the
  receipt of one of these she wrote again to George in Ireland:</p>

  <p>"My dear George, I have received the long expected packet. The account
  Fanny gives of her health is far from pleasing me...Skeys has received
  congratulatory letters from most of his friends and relations in Ireland, and
  he now regrets that he did not marry sooner. All his mighty fears had no
  foundation, so that if he had had courage to have braved the world's dread
  laugh and ventured to have acted for himself, he might have spared Fanny many
  griefs, part of which will never be obliterated. Nay, more. If she had gone a
  year or two ago her health might have been perfectly restored, which I do not
  think now will ever be the case. Before true passion I am convinced
  everything but a sense of duty moves. True love is warmest when the object is
  absent. How Hugh could let Fanny languish in England while he was throwing
  money away at Lisbon, is to me inexplicable if he had a passion that did not
  require the fuel of seeing the object..."</p>

  <p>Before Mary wrote again to George, his sister had persuaded her husband to
  allow her brother to return to the Lisbon office. By the time Mary had heard
  this news, George had sailed for Portugal. Mary had also been informed that
  Fanny was expecting a child in the early part of the New Year, and she had
  promised herself the pleasure of nursing her friend on this occasion, though
  she was doubtful whether it was wise to leave the little school in the charge
  of Everina and Eliza, neither of whom showed much discretion or tact in
  dealing with pupils or teachers:</p>

  <p>Newington Green,</p>

  <p>September 4th, 1785.</p>

  <p>"By this time, my dear George, I suppose you have received Fanny's letter
  informing you that your fortune has at last taken a turn. I only heard of it
  yesterday and I most sincerely rejoice, and I earnestly wish to hear of your
  arrival at Lisbon on Fanny's account as well as your own. I hope to see you
  before the year is out, as I am determined to be with her on a certain
  occasion if I can possibly contrive it...Palmer has hatched up some stories
  to my discredit in order to be avenged on me for opening Mrs. D's eyes to his
  villainies. He is still in prison..."</p>

  <p>Together with Fanny's letter entreating her Mary to come and stay with her
  was one from Mr. Skeys giving an alarming account of his wife's health. He
  desired, he said, to gratify her every wish, and she had none dearer to her
  heart than that of seeing Mary again.</p>

  <p>The tender and devoted friend did not hesitate for a moment. She wrote to
  Lisbon, promising at the earliest possible moment to join Fanny. Few could
  realise the difficulties this promise involved her in. The little school had
  been far from successful. Her life at Newington Green, "the grave of all her
  hopes," as she described it, was miserably hard and drab. In the mornings and
  evenings she did housework and sewing&mdash;for the rest of the day she
  taught. Her expenses had proved higher than she had expected, her gain
  smaller. It had been a mistake to move from the small house into the larger
  one. She lost many of her little pupils, and others did not replace them;
  some of her boarders could not be induced to pay their bills; her creditors
  increased. She found herself being gradually involved in what she most
  detested&mdash;a network of petty debts. She had, too, been greatly troubled
  by the misfortunes of George Blood and the censorious conduct of Mrs.
  Campbell, who had accused her of encouraging an idle, vicious youth. Added to
  this was the burden of the Bloods. Again the old man had lost his work and
  was pestering to go to Ireland. Poor, helpless and incompetent, the wretched
  couple looked to Mary for support, and she spent what time she could snatch
  from her own labours in assisting them and trying to find some work for the
  old drunkard, who spent in gin the money sent by Fanny and Hugh Skeys. Mary
  had been drawn unpleasantly into the affairs of the scoundrel Palmer, because
  she had ventured to defend the innocent George, to protect him against the
  consequences of his employer's villainies and to open the eyes of the mother
  of the lying servant girl to the true facts of the case. Even her own good
  name had been tarnished by the rascally attorney. All these things combined
  to make Mary's life almost unendurably gloomy and sad. She lost what little
  of her natural gaiety had survived her home life, and the eagerness with
  which she had undertaken her new enterprise completely vanished.</p>

  <p>The drudge at the dame-school conscientiously fulfilled her task of
  teaching the unruly and indifferent children sent to her, but neither her
  health nor her spirits were in a condition to fit her for this difficult and
  tiresome task. Often a common lassitude would fall over the little classes;
  children would be whispering or quarrelling on their benches or asleep with
  their books dropped in their laps, while the tall, pale-faced, auburn-haired
  girl, sunk in her own miseries, would sit motionless at the blackboard
  staring at the ground. In this state of affairs a journey to Lisbon seemed
  out of the question; it would have been considered under any circumstances a
  bold thing for a woman alone to undertake. Everina and Eliza at once
  protested that they could not contrive to manage the school by themselves.
  They pointed out that Mary had neither the money to pay for her fare, nor the
  clothes fit to visit a prosperous merchant's wife. It was winter time, the
  season bad, and the sea voyage known to be long and uncomfortable. Mary,
  however, refused to listen to anything except the call from Fanny. She made
  whatever arrangements were possible for the good running of the school in her
  absence. She closed her ears to the protests of her sisters, and she went
  from one acquaintance to another, endeavouring to borrow the money for her
  fare. It added to her disdain of Hugh Skeys that he had not sent her some
  money for her journey. He knew her circumstances, and though she, out of
  delicacy, would not ask, he, out of delicacy, might have offered.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mrs. Bishop and the Misses Wollstonecraft had made some friends since they
  had been at Newington Green. This was no ordinary village; in it was situate
  one of the largest Dissenting Academies in the country, and near to this
  austere establishment had grown up a considerable colony of educated
  respectable people, retired Dissenting pastors, their wives or widows,
  superannuated schoolmasters, decorous pamphleteers, correctors of the press,
  publishers' readers and scholars engaged in unprofitable but to themselves
  delightful tasks of the translation and revision of the more decorous classic
  authors. These people were, according to Mary's standard, well off&mdash;they
  were certainly not pursued by the unseemly poverty that gnawed her; they were
  also free from the coarse vices that had so smirched her childhood and youth,
  and they were engaged in those intellectual pursuits that she so ardently
  wished to follow. As the attention of the grave men in their snuff-coloured,
  neat, worn clothes and the notice of their prim ladies in tabbinet or crape
  were attracted to the three girls struggling with the dame-school, they began
  to call at the modest establishment to inspect the bare room with the pair of
  globes, the shelves of dog-eared books, the benches and desks patched
  together by George Blood where the three young women taught their little
  pupils.</p>

  <p>After sober consideration, Newington Green approved of the sad little
  enterprise. It was lamentable that Mrs. Bishop was separated from her
  husband, but not the most censorious could complain of her life. The three
  sisters were of the utmost respectability. Their drab lives, deprived of all
  gaiety, pleasure and diversion, satisfied the puritan instincts of these good
  people whose own piety was so grim, whose own existences were so colourless
  and monotonous, that it might have seemed as if, like a regiment at a pause,
  the entire colony of Newington Green was but marking time until the signal
  was given for them to march into Heaven.</p>

  <p>Mary accepted these people, their rigid standard of conduct, their
  cut-and-dried ethics, their acrid theology and in particular the tenet, the
  more trouble on earth, the more joy in Heaven. In her talk and in her letters
  she adopted much of the jargon of "thorny paths" leading by mysterious ways
  and for mysterious reasons to perfect bliss.</p>

  <p>She belonged nominally to the Church of England, but there was nothing in
  the creed of Dissent that displeased her, though she escaped wholly, by
  reason of a full, unimaginative mind, the taint of that "enthusiasm" which
  George Whitfield and the Wesleys had spread throughout the country.</p>

  <p>This austere little world of Newington Green was much more to her liking
  than that wider brilliant world of Bath; and, for a good reason, here she was
  accepted&mdash;there she had been rejected.</p>

  <p>She was pleased to be admitted to the insipid tea drinkings, the arid
  debates, the doleful self-pityings, the zestful relishings of future joys in
  Heaven, and she had neither the taste nor the experience to realise that here
  was pedantry without culture, piety without mysticism, good behaviour without
  grace or warmth, and that these worthies had succeeded in desiccating life
  until it had become like a last year's prune.</p>

  <p>What she knew as respectability and what she thought was learning were
  still her objectives in life. She diligently "kept up appearances." No
  mention was made of the drunken father in Wales, of the lawless ragged
  brother, though hardly scraped up shillings were sent secretly to both, and
  nothing could have been more distressing than the constables' spying about
  The Green for George Blood; but even that had been lived down, and Mary, when
  the summons came from Lisbon, was respected by these censorious people whose
  good opinion was so hard to gain.</p>

  <p>What she taught with the elements of learning, morals, religion was so
  sternly orthodox, her own conduct was so irreproachable, and there was
  something so gratifying to kindly bigotry in her person, clean but slovenly,
  wearing the cheapest clothes, despising the simplest aids to those charms
  that she did not appear to know she possessed, that even the most pious widow
  on the Green, Mrs. Burgh, accepted the young schoolmistress as one worthy of
  that long affliction which finally fits the soul for a place in the heavenly
  choirs.</p>

  <p>To this lady Mary took her tale of distress&mdash;how was she to find the
  means to get to Portugal? The two women wept together in the drab parlour,
  darkened by the shadow of that grim academy founded by the redoubtable
  Charles Morton, who had finally migrated to America in disgust and discovered
  his true vocation in witch hunting.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to live on The Green and escape the uncompromising
  outlines of this seminary where John Bunyan had preached, where Daniel Defoe
  had imbibed the milk of the Word, and where Samuel Wesley the elder, had
  begun his starveling progress to the blacking of boots and the attainment of
  learning in Exeter College, Oxford. Mrs. Burgh thought that something might
  be done. She sent Mary home across the twilight green, where some of her
  little pupils played at cricket, and her prim maid for Dr. Richard Price, who
  was not only a well-known figure among the inhabitants of The Green, but of
  some distinction in literary London.</p>

  <p>This Dissenting minister, then over sixty years of age, had published in
  1756 a book with a forbidding title, <i>Review of the Principal Questions in
  Morals</i>, that had brought him some fame and money. The book was a reply to
  another very popular in its day, <i>The Moral Philosophy of Francis
  Hutcheson</i>, who had upheld the principles of the third Earl of Shaftesbury
  against those of Hobbes and Mandeville.</p>

  <p>Dr. Price had also more lively claims to attention: he was liberal in his
  views, a friend of Benjamin Franklin, a supporter of the Colonies that had so
  successfully revolted against George III, and had expressed his views so
  forcibly that Congress, in the first excitement of liberty achieved, had
  invited this enthusiastic supporter to accept a seat in the Senate of the
  United States. Dr. Price had preferred the chaste pleasures of Newington
  Green, but he continued to watch the affairs of the world with much interest,
  in particularly those of France. The writings of the Gallic philosophers
  attracted him in spite of their atheism. He flattered himself that he could
  extract the honey of their humanitarianism while rejecting the gall of their
  blasphemies.</p>

  <p>Mary had often heard the good doctor express these views, and heartily
  agreed with them. His warm praise of America rearoused those gusts of
  admiration that she had felt in Bath when she had read of the war in Mrs.
  Dawson's newspapers. Dr. Price, on his side, liked the burdened, serious
  girl, and recognised, with some surprise, a strong intelligence in this shy,
  unschooled female. Mary was frequently a member of the sober congregation
  that gathered in the bare meeting-room to hear Richard Price discourse of the
  miseries that humanity must blindly endure, in the faith that these
  inflictions conferred some dazzling benefit beyond the grave.</p>

  <p>The kindly minister consulted with Mrs. Burgh on Mary's problem. Mrs.
  Burgh was herself of some importance; her late husband, James Burgh, had been
  a scholar of St. Andrews, a press corrector, an usher, the head of a school
  at Stoke Newington, and author of various pamphlets including one,
  <i>Political Disquisitions</i>, that had been widely read. Between these two
  friends the matter was soon arranged. Mrs. Burgh waited on Mary and gave her
  the bare minimum for her journey to Portugal. In order to spare feminine
  delicacy, she declared that this loan came from herself; but in reality the
  money had been taken from Richard Price's modest capital.</p>

  <p>Thus furnished with the means of reaching Fanny, Mary furbished up her
  poor stock of clothes and set out on the dreary and perilous voyage to
  Portugal, the first stage of which was a rough journey to the coast through
  November fogs and rains. Mary's first experience of leaving her own country
  was dismal. The root misery of her poverty made it appear as if she were
  especially destined for misfortune. She travelled as cheaply as possible, on
  a third-class ship and at the stormy season of the year. Mary had to share
  the rudest quarters with wretched fellow-travellers, many of whom were going
  south in the desperate hope of restoring diseased lungs. The coughings of
  consumptives were added to the retchings of the sick as the passengers
  huddled in the dark cabin of the tossing ship that was caught in a November
  gale. The sea was so high that the vessel was almost dismasted. Many of the
  passengers were very ill, and Mary had to nurse a dying man who was
  travelling by himself, for she alone among the female passengers seemed to
  preserve some presence of mind. Indeed, her thoughts were so fixed upon Fanny
  that she hardly noticed the discomforts of the journey and was not herself
  ill. The same obsession prevented her from noticing when the voyage ended at
  last the strange scene that the beautiful city presented, rising white and
  golden amid palms and olives in the Southern winter from the banks of the
  Tagus.</p>

  <p>To her Portugal and Lisbon were but the background of the loved one. She
  hastened to Mr. Skeys's pleasant house, so different in every detail from
  anything she had seen before, yet she noticed nothing. She was later than she
  had intended to be; there had been delays in raising the money, getting
  together her meagre equipment and owing to the tempestuous voyage. Mary,
  exhausted, dishevelled, breathless, ran upstairs to find that doctor and
  midwife were already in attendance on Fanny. Mary entered her chamber only to
  witness her convulsions of agony. Four hours after Mary's arrival in Lisbon
  Fanny's child was born, and Mary, not herself recovered from the fatigues of
  her journey, was called upon to nurse her friend.</p>

  <p>Child-birth had consumed the remnant of strength left to Fanny. As Mary
  looked upon the haggard aspect of her friend gasping her life out between her
  distorted smiles of welcome, she thought with a burning reproach of the
  dilatory and reluctant lover who, in her opinion, had murdered his Fanny by
  his delay.</p>

  <p>In the first interval of leisure Mary had, she wrote to her sisters:</p>

  <p>"My dear girls, I am beginning to awaken out of a terrifying dream. In
  that light do the transactions of these two or three last days appear. Before
  I say more, let me tell you that when I arrived here Fanny was in labour and
  that four hours afterwards she was delivered of a boy. The child was alive
  and well, and considering the <i>very</i>, <i>very</i> low state to which
  Fanny was reduced she is better than could be expected...I could not write to
  you on shipboard, the sea was so rough, and we had such hard gales and winds
  that the captain was afraid we should be dismasted. I cannot write to-night
  or collect my scattered thoughts, my mind is so unsettled. Fanny is so worn
  out, her recovery would be almost a resurrection, but my reason will scarcely
  allow me to think this possible..."</p>

  <p>The letter was interrupted by desperate news of the invalid. Mary flew
  back to her friend's bedside, and only two days later was able to resume her
  letter:</p>

  <p>Friday morning.</p>

  <p>"Fanny has been so alarmingly ill since I wrote the above I entirely gave
  her up, but yet I could not write and tell you so. It seemed like signing her
  death warrant. Yesterday afternoon some of the most alarming symptoms a
  little abated and she had a comfortable night, yet I rejoice with trembling
  lips and am afraid to indulge hope...We arrived last Monday and we were only
  thirteen days at sea. The wind was so high and the sea so boisterous the
  water came in at the cabin windows and the ship rolled about in such a manner
  it was dangerous to stir. The women were seasick the whole time and a poor
  invalid so oppressed by his complaints I never expected he would live to see
  Lisbon. I supported him for hours together gasping for breath, and at night,
  if I had been inclined for sleep, his dreadful cough would have kept me
  awake...Could I not look for comfort where only it is to be found, I should
  have been mad before this, but I feel that I am supported by that Being who
  alone can heal a wounded spirit. May He bless you both. Yours, Mary."</p>

  <p>Before this letter was posted gentle Fanny Skeys had died, so worn out by
  past sorrows and privations as to be unable to enjoy happiness when at last
  she found it.</p>

  <p>Mary's grief at this loss was extreme; she was more overwhelmed than she
  had been either by the long agony of her mother's last illness or by Eliza's
  dreadful fits of insanity. Her duty to her sisters and to the little school
  in Newington Green was, however, uppermost in her mind. She did not linger in
  Lisbon, where she hardly noticed either the people or the surroundings, and
  immediately after Fanny's burial in the English cemetery, where the palm and
  the olive shaded her grave, Mary returned to England. Fanny, who had never
  been able to command any of her husband's money, left her friend nothing.
  When Mary spoke to him of the needs of his wife's parents, he pleaded an
  embarrassment in his affairs. One of the reasons for Mary's hasty return was
  therefore her dislike of Hugh Skeys, whom she continued to blame for his
  wife's death.</p>

  <p>Mary, for the sake of economy, had to travel in the roughest manner
  possible, and the ship on which she was embarked encountered severe storms.
  Neither her grief nor her discomforts were sufficient to weaken Mary's
  courage, always conspicuous in a crisis. The ship passed, when the gale was
  at its height, a dismasted French vessel. The foreign captain hailed the
  Englishman, declaring himself to be in danger of foundering; his stock of
  provisions was almost exhausted. He asked that he and his entire crew might
  be taken on board the other ship. The English captain hesitated for fear of
  overloading his own ship. The situation came to the ears of the passengers
  and was the subject of passionate discussion. Mary was startled out of her
  absorption in her own sorrow by sympathy for the wretched French crew. While
  everyone on board was hesitant, she was decided. Wrapping a shawl about her,
  she fought her way on deck, through the wind and rain, approached the captain
  and warmly urged him to succour the Frenchmen; then, seeing him still
  reluctant to do so, she added that if the foreign sailors were left to perish
  she would publish the story on her return to London. Before this threat the
  captain gave way; boats were put out and the French crew, after much
  difficulty, taken on board the English vessel.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>When, exhausted and travel-worn, Mary again reached Newington Green she
  found nothing but trouble. As she had expected, Everina and Eliza had proved
  incapable of managing the school. The younger sister had finally quarrelled
  with the difficult Mrs. Campbell, who had withdrawn herself and her three
  boys from the establishment. Other pupils had left through the sisters'
  negligence or temper, debts had mounted higher, and creditors became more
  importunate.</p>

  <p>The death of their daughter had left the Bloods in even deeper distress
  than before. Mary had in vain endeavoured to get some assistance for them
  from Hugh Skeys. The young merchant, however, had never approved of his
  wife's relatives, and had already done much to assist them. He refused to be
  burdened further, with the shiftless idle crew. Nor was any help forthcoming
  from George, for, unknown to his parents and Mary, he had quarrelled with his
  brother-in-law soon after his sister's death and left Lisbon for Ireland,
  where he was looking for work. As he did not wish to vex Mary with this new
  disaster, he did not write to her, and she was ignorant of his
  whereabouts.</p>

  <p>The fortunes of Mr. Wollstonecraft also had fallen to a very low ebb.
  After a brief visit to the capital, he had been forced to retreat again to
  the Pembrokeshire farm, taking with him his second wife, an insignificant but
  good-hearted creature who had been foolish enough to accept him. With him had
  gone Charles. The three barely managed to make a poor living at Laugharne,
  and Mr. Wollstonecraft wrote continually to Mary, urging her to try to induce
  Edward, the one prosperous member of the family, to send him money.</p>

  <p>To these bitter miseries of others which she tried to shoulder, Mary added
  her own troubles: a persistent illness and lowness of spirit made her see
  present and future through an unalterable gloom, and a grave failure in her
  health was brought about by anxiety and overwork. Nervous debility seriously
  affected her sight; she believed that she was going blind.</p>

  <p>While she was still struggling to keep her school together and was
  considering desperately what she should do to help the many unfortunate
  creatures dependent upon her, George Blood wrote from Ireland, told her of
  the breach with Hugh Skeys, and asked her not to reveal this to his parents
  until he had found employment. This was yet another misfortune, but Mary
  regarded it with sympathy, if only for the reason that she liked George and
  disliked Mr. Skeys.</p>

  <p>In February, 1786, she wrote to the young man the following letter:</p>

  <p>"Things do not go well with me and my spirits seem forever flown. I was a
  month on my passage and the weather was so tempestuous we were several times
  in imminent danger that I did not expect ever to have reached land. If it had
  pleased Heaven to have called me then, what a world of care I should have
  missed. I have lost all relish for pleasure and life seems a burden almost
  too heavy to be endured. My head is stupid and my heart sick and exhausted.
  But why should I worry you? And yet, if I do not tell you my vexations, what
  can I write about?...The school dwindles to nothing and we shall soon lose
  our last boarder, Mrs. Disney. She and the girls quarrelled while I was away,
  which contributed to make the house very disagreeable. Her sons are to be
  whole boarders at Mrs. Cockburn's. Let me turn my eyes on which side I will,
  I can only anticipate misery...I have too many debts. I cannot think of
  remaining any longer in this house, the rent is so enormous. Where to go,
  without friends and money, who can point out? My eyes are very bad and my
  memory gone. I cannot think of any situation, and as for Eliza I don't know
  what will become of her. My constitution is impaired. I hope I shan't live
  long, yet I may be a tedious time dying&mdash;Mary Wollstonecraft."</p>

  <p>Mary added to this letter:</p>

  <p>"Well, I am too impatient. The Will of Heaven be done. I will labour to be
  resigned. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. I scarce know what I
  write, yet my writing at all when my mind is so disturbed as it is proves to
  you that I can never be lost so entirely in business to forget those I love.
  I long to hear that you are settled. This is the only quarter from which I
  can reasonably expect any pleasure. I have received a very short,
  unsatisfactory letter from Lisbon. It was written to apologise for not
  sending the money to your father which he [Mr. Skeys] promised. It would have
  been particularly acceptable at this time; but he is prudent and will not run
  any hazards to serve a friend."</p>

  <p>Mary, however, was not, as she knew, really without friends. There were
  still Dr. Price and Mrs. Burgh whom she could hardly hope to repay, there
  were the Clares and there was the Rev. John Hewlett, who was moved by the
  grave auburn haired girl who worked so hard and was so overburdened by the
  troubles of others. This gentleman called on the poor little school and
  suggested that she should write some little manual on education. He was a
  friend of Joseph Johnson, the celebrated bookseller, and might get it
  published. This advice seemed to offer a sparkle of hope. Mary felt that if
  she could earn money all her difficulties would vanish. Ill and harassed as
  she was, she at once sat down-and put together thoughts on the <i>Education
  of Daughters</i>. It was hackwork. Mary had much that was original to say on
  the subject of the education of women, but this was not the moment to say it.
  She kept to the safe lines of platitude and commonplace. The effort pleased
  Mr. Johnson, who paid her ten guineas for it. With this money Mary at once
  sent Mr. and Mrs. Blood to Dublin, where they had for long been pestering to
  go. This was Mary's tribute to the memory of her friend. She put the needs of
  Fanny's parents before those of her own besotted father or penniless
  brothers.</p>

  <p>As for herself, Mary was indulging in the only luxury possible to the
  unfortunate&mdash;that of self-renunciation. She began to take a melancholy
  delight in sacrificing herself, in going without the meanest comforts, in
  stripping herself for the benefit of others, in counting on a reward in
  Heaven.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>In making the acquaintance of Joseph Johnson, Mary had touched the fringe
  of the circle of London's most advanced intellectuals. The bookseller was a
  prosperous business man, a patron of literature, actively interested in the
  thought of the day, and in touch with all the finest minds of Europe. From
  his press in St. Paul's Churchyard he issued many famous works, including
  those by Priestley, Cowper, Horne Tooke, and Erasmus Darwin. He was, in
  common with most intellectuals, Liberal, even republican in sympathies, and
  gathered round him the boldest thinkers and the most daring writers. He was
  then nearly fifty years of age, genial, humane, shrewd and cool-headed.</p>

  <p>This important man was interested in the grave and harassed young girl who
  had so quickly turned out a saleable work. He believed that he saw in her a
  potential writer, and he asked for further contributions to his publishing
  list; but Mary's wants were urgent; the school no longer existed, and she was
  encumbered with heavy debts. She very much wished to devote herself to
  writing, but the prospects that authorship offered were too precarious. It
  was decided that the school should be given up at once and that they should
  go out as companions or governesses. The situation at this time is described
  in a letter to George Blood, written from Newington Green on the 22nd May,
  1787:</p>

  <p>"By this time, my dear George, I hope your father and mother have reached
  Dublin...My affairs are hastening to a crisis. Some of my creditors cannot
  afford to wait for their money. As for leaving England in debt, I am
  determined not to do it. Everina and Eliza are both endeavouring to go out
  into the world, the one as a companion and the other as a teacher, and I
  believe I shall continue some time on the Green. I intend taking a little
  cheap lodging and living without a servant. The few scholars I have will
  maintain me. I have done with all worldly pursuits and wishes. I only wish to
  exist without being dependent on the caprices of our fellow creatures. I
  shall have many solitary hours, but I have not much to hope for in life so it
  would be absurd to give way to fear...Surely when I could determine to
  survive Fanny I can endure poverty and all the lesser ills of life. I
  dreaded, oh, how I dreaded this time, and now it is arrived I am calmer than
  I expected to be. I have been very unwell. My constitution is much impaired.
  The prison walls are decaying and the prisoner will ere long get free.
  Remember that I am your truly affectionate friend and sister, Mary
  Wollstonecraft."</p>

  <p class="first">THE two younger sisters soon obtained ill-paid and
  uncomfortable posts as companions, and Mary was left alone in Newington
  Green. The scheme that she had mentioned to George Blood, however, of taking
  a little room and trying to earn her living by teaching fell through; but one
  of the friends whom she had made through her scholastic venture recommended
  her to a Mr. Prior, an assistant master at Eton College. This gentleman was
  shortly travelling with his wife to Dublin, and had been asked by Lady
  Kingsborough to find a governess for her children. This post was suggested to
  Mary. She sent in her credentials and prayed that she might be accepted. Much
  as she disliked the thought of entering another person's house in a
  dependent's position, this situation seemed her only way of escape from her
  present and incessant difficulties. While the affair was still undecided she
  wrote to George Blood, July 6th, 1787:</p>

  <p>"Lady Kingsborough has written about me to Mrs. Prior and I wait for
  further particulars before I give my final answer. Forty pounds a year were
  the terms mentioned to me, and half of the sum I could spare to discharge my
  debts, and afterwards to assist Eliza. I by no means like the proposal of
  being a governess...Here we have no resting place nor any stable comforts,
  but what arises from our resignation and the Will of Heaven and our firm
  reliance on those precious promises delivered to us by Him who brought life
  and immortality to the world..."</p>

  <p>She decided, however, although with reluctant misgivings, to accept the
  post of governess to Lady Kingsborough's children and to travel with Mr. and
  Mrs. Prior to Dublin. They were not ready for an immediate departure, and
  Mary went to stay with them at their house in Eton, the red mansion opposite
  the west doorway of the chapel.</p>

  <p>Mr. Prior was an excellent scholar. The grandson of a former college
  porter, he had obtained a King's Scholarship at Eton and afterwards became a
  Fellow of King's College, Cambridge.</p>

  <p>Mary remained for some weeks in Eton, and had the worst possible
  impression of the school and the scholars. From what she could see of the
  boys, she thought them idle, vicious and irreligious. She strongly disliked
  the whole system of education as she saw it exemplified in Eton College, and
  she felt all her previous ideas as to the upbringing of the young confirmed.
  She was reading, too, some books lent her by Mr. Johnson. The heady and
  disturbing philosophy of J. J. Rousseau began to shake her narrow piety.</p>

  <p>On October 9th, 1787, she wrote to Everina from Eton:</p>

  <p>"The time I spend here appears lost. While I remain in England I would
  fain be near those I love...I could not live the life they lead at Eton;
  nothing but dress and ridicule going forward, and I really believe their
  fondness for ridicule tends to make them affected, the women in their manners
  and the men in their conversation. Witlings abound and puns fly about like
  crackers, though you scarcely guess they have any meaning in them if you did
  not hear the noise they create. So much company without any sociability would
  be to me an insupportable fatigue, yet I am, 'tis true, quite alone in a
  crowd; I cannot help reflecting on the scene around me, and my thoughts
  harass me. Vanity in one shape or another reigns triumphant. My thoughts and
  wishes tend to that land where the God of Love will wipe away all tears from
  our eyes, where sincerity and truth will flourish and the imagination will
  not dwell on pleasing illusions which vanish like dreams when experience
  forces us to see things as they really are..."</p>

  <p>The bitter tone of this letter is easily explained. Mary, poor and
  neglected, felt herself an outsider in the society of Eton as she had felt
  herself an outsider in the society of Bath. Nobody concerned himself with
  her, and she found herself watching as a detached spectator a life in which
  she could not have any part. At the same time she was conscious of personal
  attraction and considerable gifts, and knew that under favourable
  circumstances she could have held her own with all these witlings whom she
  affected to despise. It is easy to see the faults of those who do not in any
  way concern us, and Mary had a keen eye for all the weaknesses of these gay,
  independent people who never so much as cast a glance at the poor young woman
  who was living in sufferance in Mr. Prior's household, a mere nobody waiting
  to become a governess in Ireland. Mary was, besides, in very low health,
  still troubled about her sight, subject to attacks of fever at night and
  hampered by a distressing weakness that made the least exertion difficult.
  Had she been well and happy, Mary would not have noted with as much severity
  the hypocrisy of the boys who went to take the Sacrament for no other reason
  than to avoid a fine of half a guinea. As the misery of her worldly position
  was forced on her, she turned more and more to the luxury of self-sacrifice
  and to the prospect of that Heaven in which her friends the Nonconformists so
  firmly believed. This unnatural resignation, this forced piety, betrayed the
  honest Mary into hypocrisy. She had confessed to George Blood that she would
  never think of giving her confidence to her sisters, yet she wrote to Everina
  that only the prospect of being united to her in Heaven made her earthly
  toils tolerable.</p>

  <p>Under this bitter self-abnegation Mary felt the thrills of a hardly
  suppressed ambition. She was alien in Eton as she had been alien in Bath, but
  in that circle which was presided over by Mr. Johnson she might be tolerated,
  even admired. The famous bookseller had actually promised to buy more of her
  work. For a few hours' labour she had earned ten golden coins. If she had but
  the courage, might she not make her living this way, pay her debts, help her
  relatives?</p>

  <p>Mr. Prior's comfortable house was well stocked with books. While the
  schoolboys shouted without in the golden light of the autumn days, and the
  masters and their wives were busy with their games, cards and tea drinking,
  Mary took down book after book from the loaded shelves and, glancing over the
  polished tomes, found that the thought of man had stretched further than the
  most daring flights undertaken by the moralists of Newington Green.</p>

  <p>Mary read <i>Emile</i>, and was entranced by ideas so like her own on the
  subject of education, and exasperated by Rousseau's estimate of woman, as low
  as that of Milton and expressed in terms of a sensuous hedonism that seemed
  to the austere young Englishwoman degrading to her sex. She despised novels;
  fiction and verse, song and legend, all that had not a useful or moral
  purpose was scorned by Mary. She regarded the devices of the romances as mere
  false tricks to blind women to their miseries and their duties and the poets
  she held little better. What was the use of escape through dreams? Far better
  realise the evils that rendered escape necessary and strive, by the aid of
  reason, to remove them; but, for all this, Mary read <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>,
  and the equally famous novel that it had inspired, <i>La Nouvelle
  Hlose</i>. She despised both these heroines, and the heroes, by all her
  standards, merited her contempt, but she was secretly stirred by these vital
  male figures and unacknowledged longings cast themselves round the figures of
  Robert Lovelace and Saint-Preux. These symbols of sex under its most
  seductive and refined form were not wholly powerless to stir the
  level-headed, gallant young woman who believed she had renounced all the
  lusts of the flesh. The reading of these books helped to increase her
  bitterness, and the more serious works that she hastily perused heightened
  her mental restlessness.</p>

  <p>She was disorganised by her loneliness, and, watching the world through
  the lenses of poverty, saw everything out of focus.</p>

  <p>She was of the type and in the circumstances that make the rebel. Her
  wider reading took from her some of her simple consolations as to the
  inscrutability and infallibility of Divine justice. Like all those who have
  nothing but what their own labours can procure for them, and who are at the
  same time bold and gifted, she began to question the right of fools and
  simpletons to what they were incapable of earning; hereditary honours,
  wealth, position, the luxury secured through corruption or luck by an
  intriguing male, or through marriage by an intriguing female, roused her
  disgust and scorn. She began to ask herself: "Have I not merits? Should they
  not be rewarded?" And she turned eagerly to the prospect of some possible
  changes in customs, traditions, even in law and government, that should give
  her and her equals their chance and consign to insignificance the swarms of
  chattering nonentities who had inherited the earth through no merits of their
  own.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Sick at heart and rebellious, then, Mary sailed for Ireland with the
  Priors, landed at Cork Harbour and made her way by carriage across the
  magnificent country to Mitchelstown, on the Tipperary borders. Her new
  situation proved as detestable as she had thought it would be, and the
  consolations of the Evangelical religion to which she clung proved but cold
  comfort against these grim realities, and the impalpable joys of that Heaven
  where, as she constantly said, "Everything will be changed," were but dim
  compared to the glitter of the triumphant vanity that she saw about her as
  she crossed Lord Kingsborough's handsome estate.</p>

  <p>Mitchelstown Castle was finely situated above the small town. Behind were
  hills across which the clouds hung constantly in those hazy swathes of purple
  that dim the pale azure of an Irish sky with such melancholy charm. Trembling
  with nervousness, the shabby, tired young woman entered the massive building,
  passed the servants who condescended to take her poor luggage and found a
  large group of women gathered to inspect her in the formidable
  withdrawing-room. Everything was grave and dull, and Mary was so sick with
  agitation that she could scarcely command herself.</p>

  <p>My lady, surrounded by sisters and friends, was handsome, hard and
  dashing. Her face was painted, her hair fashionably dressed, and she engaged
  in a loud conversation with a number of small spaniels who fawned on her
  brocade skirts. These animals seemed to be her principal interests. Calling
  up her children, she presented them to their future governess, who mentally
  noted that they were "wild Irish," and that the three girls were afraid of
  their overbearing mother. My lady's brother joined the party, asked Mary if
  his sisters were not fine girls, and added that they were just "going to
  market." My lord came in and made a jest no more refined. He was coarse,
  genial and stupid, and after a good-humoured welcome to the governess
  returned to his dogs and his gun.</p>

  <p>Mary found the situation frightful. To add to her miseries, she learnt
  that Mr. Prior had exaggerated her abilities, and that she was expected to
  know far more French than she did. Her only consolation was that she was
  treated as a gentlewoman&mdash;i.e., not sent below stairs&mdash;and that she
  found Margaret, the plain eldest girl, soft and dutiful.</p>

  <p>Within a few days of her arrival at the Castle the youngest children, whom
  Mary found "not very pleasing," were ill with "disagreeable fevers," and Lady
  Kingsborough was in bed with a sore throat. The sanitary arrangements of the
  pompous dwelling were primitive, and the pure air of the countryside was soon
  contaminated when it passed through my lord's pretentious chambers.</p>

  <p>Mary, homesick, ill, made no pretence of disguising her misery. When she
  could escape to the dreary room assigned to her she wrote a letter to
  Everina, who, companion in another well-to-do home, was enduring the same
  kind of discomforts and mortifications:</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear girl, I am at length arrived at my journey's end. I sigh
  when I say so, but it matters not. I must labour for content and try to
  reconcile myself to a state which is contrary to every feeling of my soul. I
  can scarcely persuade myself that I am awake. My whole life appears like a
  frightful vision, and equally disjointed. I have been so very low-spirited
  for some days past that I could not write. All the moments I could spend in
  solitude were lost in sorrow and unavailing tears. There was such an air of
  solemn stupidity about this place that froze my very blood. I entered the
  great gates with the same kind of feeling as I should have if I was going
  into the Bastille."</p>

  <p>She then gave Everina a bitter account of the Castle's inhabitants. She
  admitted that Lady Kingsborough was shrewd and clever and trying to be kind,
  but she could not like this fine lady, "a new species of animal to me," who
  neglected her children and made herself an imbecile over dogs. As the
  governess sat apart, between her letter and her copy of Rousseau, she heard
  sounds of merrymaking below; even the servants had their fiddles and
  jigs&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I only am melancholy and alone. To tell the truth I hope part of my
  misery arises from disordered nerves, as I would fain believe my mind is not
  so very weak."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The passage of time did not improve Mary's spirits. She felt herself
  unequal to what she had undertaken. Her dislike for Lady Kingsborough
  increased; she disapproved of the system on which the three girls were being
  educated; she found that she was expected to teach "a heap of rubbish called
  accomplishments," and she regretted the sacrifice of her eldest pupil,
  Margaret, a girl of fourteen years, to this fashionable folly; she was
  sickened, too, by the incessant chatter on the subject of lovers and husbands
  that these idle women enjoyed so much.</p>

  <p>Who was ever to ask for the hand of Mary Wollstonecraft?</p>

  <p>She still tried to be true to her policy of self-renunciation, but,
  withdrawn into herself, she would ponder over some ideal and heroic love,
  some man that a noble, high-minded woman might gratefully adore. When she had
  put her charges to bed, played with the dogs, listened to my lord's stale
  stories and was free at last, she would escape from "the converse of silly
  females" and from "the boisterous spirits and unmeaning laughter" that she
  found so exhausting, and brood over her unhappiness:</p>

  <p>"I retire to my room, form figures in the fire, listen to the wind, or
  view the Gotties, a fine range of mountains near us. So the time wastes away
  in apathy or misery...I am drinking asses' milk, but do not find it of any
  service. I am very ill and so low spirited that my tears flow in torrents,
  almost insensibly. I struggle with myself, but I hope my Heavenly Father will
  not be extreme to mark my weakness, that He will have compassion on a poor
  bruised reed and pity a miserable wretch whose sorrows He only knows. I
  almost wish my warfare was over."</p>

  <p>Mary's gloomy mood was not brightened by what she learnt of Lady
  Kingsborough, who had never been able to keep a governess for more than a few
  months and who had the reputation of being an idle, capricious woman of
  fashion, of the very type that Mary most despised, and who kept her house
  full of idlers like herself.</p>

  <p>The governess brought little of either patience or good-humour to her
  trials: she was prepared to find the worst, and she found it. Everything was
  distasteful to her from the drawing-room to the kitchen, and in her letters
  to her sisters which continue her descriptions, full of disgust, of the Irish
  Castle and its inhabitants, and in her sour accounts of each it is easy to
  see that it was her circumstances and situation that were at fault as much as
  the people whom she criticised, who seem to have been ordinary, well-meaning
  human beings with some merits.</p>

  <p>The news Mary received of her family increased the gloom of her low
  spirits. Mr. Wollstonecraft continued to importune his son Edward for money,
  and Edward refused to assist him. A small legacy had been left to the girls,
  and this was in Edward's hands, and they could not come at it. Besides, the
  young attorney had refused to receive Everina in his home as housekeeper
  again, and she was forced to accept any dismal position that she could
  find.</p>

  <p>A lengthy correspondence continued between the three sisters. Mary's
  letters reveal that her health and spirits gradually, if slightly, improved.
  Though she continued to dislike the life led by these Irish aristocrats and
  to scorn both the Lord and Lady who employed her, she began to be fond of the
  children, especially the eldest girl, Margaret. She had found, too, an
  absorbing occupation for her leisure hours. Like many people who despise
  novels, she decided to write one herself. What time was left from writing
  home long letters full of domestic troubles was given to the composition of a
  romance, or rather a fragment of autobiography cast into this form. She gave
  it her own name, <i>Mary</i>, and it dwelt in introspective and gloomy
  fashion on her brief romantic friendship with Fanny Blood. Mary had also the
  diversion of reading several books that hitherto had been unknown to her. On
  the shelves of the library in Mitchelstown Castle she found further works by
  J. J. Rousseau, and Mrs. Catherine Macaulay's <i>History of England</i>. This
  considerably influenced the lonely governess. She was excited by the
  knowledge that the female intelligence could achieve so difficult a work, and
  stimulated by Mrs. Macaulay's lofty morality and stern republicanism&mdash;of
  such stuff did Mary feel herself to be made. Mrs. Macaulay became her ideal
  woman and her inspiration, in contrast to that "herd of novelists" and female
  poets who were perniciously employed in stimulating the senses and dulling
  the intellects of their sex.</p>

  <p>It is true that Mary had been so disgusted by the matter-of-fact talk of
  matrimony and the jolly jests about sex in the Castle that she had wished
  that the ladies had been a little romantic and rather absorbed in the airy
  flights of the novelists than in such coarse realism, but the type of woman
  that was represented by Mrs. Macaulay&mdash;neither fanciful nor gross, most
  commanded her admiration.</p>

  <p>The female historian certainly presented an admirable pattern. She had
  contrived to be a successful authoress without ever leaving the path of the
  strictest propriety; as the wife of a London physician, as an historian and
  politician, as the guest of George Washington, as a writer on education,
  government and society, Mrs. Macaulay had been "irreproachable and
  exemplary," and, in the words of a friend, had never "when exalted on the
  dangerous pinnacle of worldly prosperity" forgotten "the urbanity of a
  gentlewoman."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, while Mary Wollstonecraft was reading Mrs. Macaulay's
  "noble and benevolent" works in the handsome, dusty library of Mitchelstown
  Castle, that grave matron, recently widowed, had married a Mr. Graham, "who
  was so many years her junior as to expose her to much irreverent remark";
  otherwise her conduct was as flawless as befitted "a patroness of liberty."
  But, despite her secret castles in the coals, the example of Mrs. Macaulay,
  the insidious, enervating philosophy of J. J. Rousseau, and her own novel,
  Mary felt herself wasted, neglected and thoroughly unhappy; there was nothing
  in her surroundings that really pleased her. She wrote to Everina in the
  spring of the New Year, 1788:</p>

  <p>"I believe I told you before that as a nation I do not admire the Irish,
  and as for the great world and its frivolous ceremonies I cannot away with
  them. They fatigue one. I thank Heaven I was not so unfortunate as to be born
  a lady of quality."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>This letter was written from Dublin. Mary had been among the large retinue
  that had accompanied the Kingsborough family in their cumbrous carriages and
  wagons along the two hundred miles or so of rough travelling from County Cork
  to the capital. Dublin was a fine, elegant city where splendid mansions
  decorated by the graceful, banal designs of Angelica Kauffmann were set in
  stately squares and terraces, where noble salons, adorned with the delicate
  marble inlay of Cosimo Rosselli were lit by candelabra of crystal that shone
  on some of the most polite and refined society in Europe.</p>

  <p>That splendid Viceroy, the brilliant fourth Duke of Portland, had died in
  Phoenix Park from the miasma of foul drains the month that Mary had arrived
  in Ireland. A magnificent great lord, the young Duke had set an example of
  almost regal splendour at the Castle. Twice a week ships from England had
  brought fruit, vegetables, sweetmeats and wines for his table where he
  dispensed the most exquisite hospitality, and it had been commonly allowed
  that the Court held by His Grace in Dublin was, in every way, more sumptuous
  than that held by His Majesty in London.</p>

  <p>The gorgeous Manners had been succeeded by the Marquess of Buckingham,
  Viceroy for the second time, even superior in abilities to his predecessor,
  and almost as elegant, generous and extravagant.</p>

  <p>Installed in the Kingsboroughs' town house, Mary felt her loneliness, her
  poverty, her sad prospects emphasised by the careless, glittering life about
  her, every one indifferent to her, she interested in no one. She remembered
  with longing those few people in London who had taken some notice of her, and
  wrote to Joseph Johnson the bookseller:</p>

  <p>"I am still an invalid and beginning to believe that I ought never expect
  to enjoy health. My mind preys on my body, and when I endeavour to be useful
  I grow too much interested for my own peace. Confined almost entirely to the
  society of children, I am anxiously solicitous for their future welfare and
  am mortified beyond measure when counteracted in my endeavours to improve
  them. I feel all a mother's fears for the swarms of little ones that surround
  me and observe disorders without having power to apply the proper
  remedies...Here alone, a poor solitary individual in a strange land, tied to
  one spot and subject to the caprice of another, can I be contented? I am
  desirous to convince you that I have some cause for sorrow and am not without
  reason detached from life."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>One evening Lady Kingsborough, in a moment of caprice, called the
  governess from her charges and told her to make ready for a masquerade for
  which she had an odd ticket. Mary objected that she had no costume, but my
  lady casually bid her maid cast a black domino over the graceful figure and
  auburn hair of the governess, and Mary found herself one of a gay, noisy
  group of fashionables that went from house to house before they reached that
  magnificent Rotunda where the carnival was being held. Lady Kingsborough wore
  a dashing cockade, some of her friends were disguised "as females of the
  newly discovered islands," another was attired as a forsaken shepherdess.</p>

  <p>At last Mary was part of the brilliant world that she had for so long
  viewed from outside. She became excited, almost light-headed, laughed,
  talked, amused the others by her satirical remarks. She was young, she was
  admired under the dazzling glitter of a thousand candles. Gaiety no longer
  seemed to Mary "vanity and vexation of spirit." She was happy for a brief
  time. But the masquerade was soon over; the governess returned to her modest
  bedroom and fell into a feverish sleep. When she awoke, the mask on the floor
  seemed to her a mockery; she felt very weak, and her spirits much sunk.</p>

  <p>The next day she wrote an account of this unusual gaiety to Eliza,
  adding:</p>

  <p>"I happened to be very melancholy in the morning as I am almost every
  morning, but at night my fever gives me false spirits. At night the lights,
  the novelty of the scene and all things together contributed to make me more
  than half mad. I gave full scope to a satirical vein."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The Kingsboroughs came to England, bringing Mary with them. They visited
  Bristol, and then Bath, and Mary continued to find the fashionable life that
  surrounded them most uncongenial. Lady Kingsborough had always disliked her,
  and now felt, or affected, a jealousy of the ascendancy she was obtaining
  over the children, particularly over the eldest, Margaret. Exercising her
  full prerogative as a capricious fine lady, Lady Kingsborough dismissed her
  governess at the end of a year of service, and in November, 1788, Mary
  travelled from Bath to London while the Kingsboroughs returned without her to
  Ireland, the child Margaret weeping passionately at thus being parted from
  her friend and pledging a promise for future cordialities that she afterwards
  redeemed.</p>

  <p>Mary had cleared off some of the more pressing of her debts with the money
  that she had earned during the year with the Kingsboroughs. She had also
  corresponded with Mr. Johnson, the bookseller, who continually urged her to
  take up literary work and to improve her knowledge of French. The last part
  of this advice she had taken, and was now a tolerable French scholar. The
  first part she resolved to follow, and from a poor room in London wrote thus
  to Everina, still in a position as a companion:</p>

  <p>"I am, my dear girl, once more thrown on the world. I have left Lord K.'s
  and they return next week to Mitchelstown. I long since imagined that my
  departure would be sudden. You can conceive how disagreeable pity and advice
  could be at this juncture...Mr. Johnson, whose uncommon kindness I believe
  has saved me from despair and vexation I should have shrank back from and
  feared to encounter, assures me that if I develop my talents in writing I may
  support myself in a comfortable way. I am, then, going to be the first of a
  new freedom. I tremble at the attempt, yet if I fail <i>I</i> only suffer.
  Should I succeed my dear girls will ever in sickness have a home and a
  refuge, where for a few months in the year they may forget their cares and
  turn to rest. I shall strain every nerve to obtain a situation for Eliza
  nearer town. In short I am once more involved in schemes, Heaven only knows
  whether they will answer, yet while they are pursued life slips away..."</p>

  <p>Mary ran on with much eagerness, assuring her sister of her own inability
  "to tread the beaten track," of the value even of uncertain freedom, and that
  "the peculiar bent of my nature pushes me on."</p>

  <p>She had resolved to have no more of this servitude in its crudest aspect;
  her self-sacrifice would take another form: living the most austere of
  existences in London, she would slave at her writing and give every penny
  that she earned to her family.</p>

  <p>She meant to stay with Eliza, who was governess in a family at
  Henley-on-Thames. She had been, as she said, "much harassed," but in the
  lovely, placid English landscape she found some peace of mind. In gratitude
  and hope she wrote to Mr. Johnson:</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, since I saw you I have, literally speaking, enjoyed
  solitude...Were I to give you an account how I have spent my time, you would
  smile. I found an old English Bible here and amused myself comparing it with
  our French translation; then I would listen to the falling leaves or observe
  the various tints that autumn gave to them. At other times the singing of a
  robin or the noise of a water-mill engaged my attention&mdash;partial
  attention&mdash;I was at the same time perhaps discussing some knotty point
  or straying from this tiny world to new systems. After these excursions I
  returned to the family meal and told the children stories (they think me
  vastly agreeable) and my sister was amused..."</p>

  <p>On Michaelmas Day of that year Mary, who had by now put together the book
  for young children that she mentions in her letter to her sister entitled
  <i>Original Stories From Real Life</i>, was established in rooms in George
  Street, Blackfriars. Not only had she her original work and translations to
  rely on, and a position as Mr. Johnson's reader, she was also engaged as a
  contributor to the <i>Analytical Review</i>, then just established. Mary
  wrote triumphantly to Everina:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Johnson has now settled me in a little house in a street near
  Blackfriars Bridge. He assured me I can earn a comfortable maintenance if I
  exert myself. I have given him <i>Mary</i> and before your vacation I shall
  finish another book for young people which I think has some merit...Whenever
  I am tired of solitude I go to Mr. Johnson's and there I meet the kind of
  company that I find most pleasure in. I intend to try to get Bess a situation
  near me and hope to succeed before the summer vacation. At any rate, she
  shall spend the approaching one in my house. Mr. J. knows that next to
  obtaining the means of life I wish to mitigate her and your fate. I have done
  with the delusions of fancy. I only live to be useful&mdash;benevolence must
  fill every void in my heart. I have a room but not furniture. Johnson has
  offered you both a bed in his house, but that would not be pleasant. I
  believe I must try to purchase a bed, which I shall reserve for my poor girls
  while I have a house. If you pay any visits you will comply with my whim and
  not mention my place of abode or my mode of life. I shall have a spur to push
  me forward in the desire of rendering two months of the year a little
  unpleasanter than they would otherwise be for you and poor uncomfortable
  Bess."</p>

  <p>There is nothing about God or the vague joys of Paradise in this letter.
  Mary was beginning to feel a revival of hope and courage that made her less
  reliant upon a gloomy piety. Her health, that had been very poor whilst she
  was in Ireland, improved; she saw before her not only the grateful prospect
  of independence and a power to help those dependent upon her, but, what was
  even more entrancing, an opportunity of doing the work that she liked.
  Nothing, indeed, could have better suited Mary Wollstonecraft's disposition
  than the proposal that Mr. Johnson made to her&mdash;that she should take a
  room, live in London, and support herself by her pen. She was to be his
  reader and to translate for him various works from the French, and
  afterwards, if she had the capacity, from the German. Much of what had been
  so tiresome to her was now eliminated from her existence; her affairs were
  now more fortunate and her prospects brighter than she had ever dared to hope
  they would be; she had found, in a manner that was almost miraculous, a mode
  of life suited to her temperament and her gifts. Released from the severest
  pinches of poverty and the sharpest anxieties about her dependents, she was
  now able to look about her and take some notice of the period in which she
  found herself and to observe what was happening in the world beyond that
  narrow and miserable circle of people which had hitherto absorbed her
  interests and her faculties.</p>

  <p class="first">MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT found that she could easily do the work
  that she had undertaken. She gave Mr. Johnson satisfaction both as critic and
  as translator, and he very willingly published such original works as she
  chose to write.</p>

  <p>With the most galling of her financial cares, then, taken off her
  shoulders, her health became rapidly re-established. The defect in her
  eyesight passed and she began to take a lively interest in questions of the
  moment. She viewed these from one point only&mdash;that of an advanced
  Radical and Rationalist. Joseph Johnson's tendencies were, indeed, considered
  by many of the orthodox to be revolutionary and atheistical, and Mary came
  much under this influence. She was also much impressed by the state of
  affairs in France that she learnt at first hand, as she had a large number of
  political pamphlets sent to her from Paris to translate.</p>

  <p>As soon as Mary Wollstonecraft began her independent life in London she
  was welcomed into the cosmopolitan society that gathered in Mr. Johnson's
  drawing-room and round his supper-table that she found as much to her liking
  as that other society she had hitherto experienced had been to her
  distaste.</p>

  <p>Although she was doing a very unusual thing in living alone in London and
  supporting herself by literary labours, it was not quite so remarkable as she
  seemed to think, and only the narrow-mindedness of the <i>bourgeois</i>
  circle in which she had been brought up and moved, had inspired her with the
  fear of being considered odd or indecorous. Among the people whom she met at
  Mr. Johnson's house her mode of life was regarded as quite natural. In this
  gay, careless and sometimes brilliant company she was received without
  question. A literary lady was indeed nothing very remarkable in the London of
  the 1790s. Fanny Burney, Anna Seward, Mrs. Inchbald, Amelia Opie, Catherine
  Macaulay, Hannah More were already well-known literary figures. Mrs. Inchbald
  received nearly a thousand pounds for one of her comedies, and Lady Mary
  Wortley-Montagu had translated <i>Epictetus</i>. None of these women,
  however, had perhaps given such a challenge to public opinion as did Mary
  Wollstonecraft when, of no family, handsome, young and unmarried, she began
  to make her own way by her own exertions, but there had hardly been an
  instance in which feminine talent or enterprise had been discouraged.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The trend of affairs at home and abroad was such as to arouse Mary's
  keenest sympathy. The American struggle for independence had resulted in the
  complete freedom of the colonies and their establishment as one of the great
  nations of the world under the name of the United States of America. Such
  time and attention as Mary could snatch from her own harassing affairs had
  always been given to figures like those of George Washington and General La
  Fayette, who had seemed to her paladins of freedom and champions of the
  rights of man. Now it seemed as if France was going to follow the American
  example and as if the proud, ancient formal Monarchy was to fall before the
  blasts of the trumpets that proclaimed the dawn of an era of freedom. The air
  was bright with glittering catchwords; it was a day of talk and of
  phrases&mdash;Liberty, Freedom, the Rights of Man were on the lips of all the
  intellectuals, who talked and scribbled on these themes with the greatest
  fluency. Their ideals were as noble as their experience was limited. J. J.
  Rousseau was quoted, not as an enthusiastic dreamer, but as a practical
  prophet. Men like Dr. Priestley and Thomas Paine, both of whom Mary met in
  Mr. Johnson's drawing-room, were confident that they had found a formula for
  a new Heaven and a new earth. It was believed that not only the betterment of
  mankind but the Millennium was round the corner, that it was only necessary
  to pull down all that was rotten and loathsome in the old fabric of society
  to find a new structure bright and shining beneath.</p>

  <p>Very many of the English intellectuals had for long sympathised with the
  revolting American colonies. These people followed with the sharpest interest
  the affairs of the French nation. They hoped that in that country a glorious
  revolution was about to take place that would transform the whole of
  humanity. All the newspapers, gazettes, pamphlets and letters from Paris were
  most eagerly read and commented upon, and these ardent intellectuals, some of
  them fanatic ideologues, honestly believed that when France swept away all
  her domestic abuses she would point out the way to the whole of humanity to
  return to that Arcadian state of happiness which it was fondly believed man
  had once enjoyed.</p>

  <p>Mary listened with the utmost eagerness to these stimulating abstract
  discussions. For the first time in her life she enjoyed the intoxicating
  delights of lively conversation with her intellectual equals and superiors.
  She agreed with all she heard. Not only did the radical and revolutionary
  tenets appeal to her intelligence&mdash;they aroused her sympathy. This was
  what she wanted to believe. She was quite ready to see the "triumphant
  vanity" of frivolous men and women that had so galled her in Bath, Dublin and
  Bristol humbled; she longed to think it might be possible that poverty, which
  had been the nightmare of her entire life, might be abolished; she wanted to
  see women, of the same type as herself, valued and respected above the
  painted dolls and simpering ninnies who seemed now to have the universal
  applause. She was not without a certain intellectual arrogance; she had done
  a difficult thing easily and brought herself at once by her own gifts and
  industry into the forefront of the most brilliant society of the moment; she
  was proud and pleased when these famous successful men and women admired and
  praised her; she was inclined to think that because she had done an unusual
  thing she had done a very clever one, and she adopted even the wildest
  revolutionary theories of Liberty, Independence, Equality of the Sexes, and
  so on, not only because she believed in them for their own sake, but because
  among their supporters she had found her own place. She was part of these
  people as she had never been part of any society before, and she exaggerated
  its talents and virtues as much as she had exaggerated the faults and vices
  of the fashionables among whom she had moved as a dependent. She began to
  show the clever woman's tendency to affectation and eccentricity. She
  speedily earned considerable sums of money, and though most of this money was
  applied to the wants of her family, particularly to those of her father and
  her younger brother Charles, she could have afforded to spend a reasonable
  amount on herself; but, even when all her debts were cleared off, when James
  had gone to sea on a merchantman, when Charles was bound apprentice to his
  brother Edward, when she had sent sufficient money to keep her miserable
  father quiet, when in brief there was no immediate call on her purse, she
  still lived in an ostentation of poverty. Her room was bare with mere table,
  chairs and truckle-bed, her crockery consisted of a few plates and cups, her
  dress the kind of drugget commonly worn by dairymaids, her hair was caught in
  a penny string, and when she went abroad, covered with an old beaver hat. She
  rather cultivated that slovenly appearance which was considered the hallmark
  of the philosophic woman or bluestocking and much disliked by the orthodox
  minded.</p>

  <p>Among the celebrities whom Mary met at Mr. Johnson's house were John
  Bonnycastle, a professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, George
  Fordyce, the physician, William Blake, rapt and silent, Thomas Paine, silent,
  but not rapt, Henry Fuseli, impetuous and magnetic, Dr. Alexander Geddes, the
  Roman Catholic Biblical critic, dismissed from the Church for his
  rationalistic tendencies, and George Anderson, the classical scholar.</p>

  <p>Among the women admitted to this learned and lively circle were the
  virtuous Mrs. Elizabeth Inchbald, flat chested, sandy haired and beautiful,
  who earned thousands by her novels and plays, but who seldom wore a gown
  "worth above eightpence," Mrs. Anna Letitia Barbauld, an amiable lady who
  scribbled valiantly on the side of the angels, Mrs. Sarah Trimmer, who "had
  made a favourable impression on Dr. Samuel Johnson," had written <i>The
  Economy of Charity</i>, <i>Story of the Robins</i>, and <i>Easy Introductions
  to the Knowledge of Nature</i>, and who, having been graciously received by
  Queen Charlotte, was scrupulously matronly in her behaviour, but discreetly
  tolerant in her choice of friends. Mary found her "truly respectable," and
  she allowed Mary's fascinations without inquiring too closely into her
  opinions which were unlikely to be acceptable to one patronised by royalty,
  whose father had been clerk of the works at Kew Palace and had taught the
  rules of perspective to George III.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>During her first year of independent work Mary, on Mr. Johnson's advice,
  did her best to disencumber the Pembroke property, so that her father and her
  step-mother might have sufficient whereon to live. On James's returning again
  from a sea voyage, she procured for him a post at Woolwich. This brother
  afterwards entered the Navy and was a midshipman on Lord Hood's ship. It was
  still her intention to send Charles to that land of her
  ideals&mdash;America&mdash;and with this object in view she placed him on a
  farm where he might obtain sound instruction in agriculture.</p>

  <p>Eliza and Everina were continually changing their places, often through
  their own fault, for they were restless and dissatisfied. When they had
  nowhere else to go Mary would entertain them in her lodgings, procuring a
  room for them in the same house, but at her expense. Mr. Johnson afterwards
  estimated that during this period she spent over two hundred pounds on her
  family. She also worked diligently. She translated <i>Necker on Religious
  Opinion</i>, compiled a <i>French Reader</i>, rewrote <i>Young Grandison</i>,
  which had been translated from the Dutch, wrote many articles and criticisms
  in the <i>Analytical Review</i>, translated from the French a famous book,
  that monument of mistaken industry, the Physiognomy of Lavater, and worked on
  some little original pieces of her own.</p>

  <p>Mary's letters to Joseph Johnson during this period show that her pleasure
  in her independence soon wore off and reveal much lassitude and even
  irritability, also a sensitive conscientiousness. She returned to the
  bookseller an Italian MS. that she felt herself unable to translate:</p>

  <p>"I return you the Italian MS., but do not hastily imagine that I am
  indolent...I would not spare any labour to do my duty...I find I could not
  translate the MS. well. If it was not a MS. I should not be so easily
  intimidated, but the hand and errors in orthography or abbreviations are a
  stumbling block at the first setting out&mdash;I cannot bear to do anything I
  cannot do well."</p>

  <p>In this same letter she refers to the pleasure she had received from a
  letter from Margaret, Lady Kingsborough's daughter, who afterwards became the
  Countess of Montcashel.</p>

  <p>Mary also refused to alter her own work according to the ideas of Mr.
  Johnson, who feared that her prefaces to her books for children might be
  considered by parents a little dictatorial. She wrote:</p>

  <p>"Believe me, the judicious parents who may peruse my book will not feel
  themselves hurt and the weak are too vain to mind what is said in a book
  intended for children."</p>

  <p>Some of her letters refer to her account with her publisher, and one shows
  Mary's great sensitiveness and delicacy of feeling. She had quite
  inadvertently in general conversation mentioned that an acquaintance of hers
  had been left, as she supposed, a fortune. It afterwards came to her ears
  that this was not true, and that the tale, getting about, had done the man
  harm. She thereupon wrote to their common friend, Johnson, in these agitated
  terms:</p>

  <p>"I am sick with vexation&mdash;and I wish I could knock my foolish head
  against the wall. Bodily pain might make me feel less anguish and self
  reproach!...You may recollect that I did not mention to you the circumstances
  of &mdash;&mdash; having a fortune left to him, nor did a hint of it drop
  from me when I conversed with my sister because I knew he had sufficient
  motives for concealing it. Last Sunday when his character was aspersed, as I
  thought unjustly, in the heat of this occasion I informed x-x-x-x that he was
  now independent, at the same time desired him not to repeat my information;
  yet last Tuesday he told him all and the boy at B&mdash;&mdash;'s gave Mrs.
  &mdash;&mdash; an account of it. As Mr. &mdash;&mdash; knew he had only made
  a <i>confidante</i> of me (I blush to think of it!) he guessed the channel of
  intelligence, and this morning came (not to reproach me&mdash;I wish he
  had)&mdash;but to point out the injury I had done him. Let what will be the
  consequence, I will reimburse him if I deny myself the necessaries of life,
  and even then my folly will sting me. But perhaps you can scarcely conceive
  the misery I at this moment endure; that I, whose power of doing good is so
  limited, should do harm galls my very soul...My stomach being so suddenly and
  violently affected, I am unable to lean over the desk."</p>

  <p>Several of Mary's letters had a tone of remorse and penitence for her
  being quick-tempered and difficult with her best friend, the stately
  bookseller:</p>

  <p>"You made me very low-spirited last night by your manner of talking. You
  are my only friend, the only person I am intimate with. I never had a father
  or a brother. You have been both to me ever since I knew you, yet I have
  sometimes been very petulant. I have been thinking of those instances of
  ill-humour and quickness and they appeared like crimes."</p>

  <p>Mary's nerves were indeed in a very disordered state at this time, and
  even hard work did not serve to soothe her vexations of soul and body. One
  letter that she wrote to Johnson, evidently after some disagreement between
  them, shows vividly her state of mind:</p>

  <p>"Your note&mdash;I can scarcely tell why it hurt me&mdash;and produced a
  kind of wintry smile which diffuses a beam of despondent tranquillity over
  the features. I have been very ill&mdash;Heaven knows it was more than
  fancy&mdash;after a sleepless, wearisome night, towards the morning I had
  grown delirious...My nerves are in such a painful state of irritation I
  suffered more than I express. Society was necessary and might have diverted
  me till I gained more strength; but I blushed when I recollected how often I
  have fatigued you with childish complaints, the reveries of a distorted mind.
  I even <i>imagined</i> that I intruded on you because you never called on me,
  though you could see that I was not well:&mdash;I have nourished a sickly
  kind of delicacy which gives me many unnecessary pangs:&mdash;I acknowledge
  that life is but a jest and often a frightful dream&mdash;yet catch myself
  every day searching for something serious&mdash;and feel real misery from the
  disappointment...There is certainly a great defect in my mind&mdash;my
  wayward heart creates its own misery:&mdash;Why I am made thus, I cannot
  tell, and until I can form some idea of the whole of my existence I must be
  content to weep and dance like a child, long for a toy and be tired of it as
  soon as I get it. We must each of us wear a fool's cap, but mine, alas, has
  lost its bells and has grown so heavy I find it intolerably troublesome."</p>

  <p>Mary tried to settle down to hard work:</p>

  <p>"I really want a German grammar as I intend to attempt to learn that
  language, and I will tell you the reason why. While I live I am persuaded I
  must exert my understanding to procure an independence and render myself
  useful. To make the task easier I ought to store my mind with knowledge. The
  seed time is passing away..."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>About this time a very painful episode occurred. A certain
  practical-minded gentleman who was little better than a marriage broker so
  far mistook Mary Wollstonecraft as to believe that he might be useful to her
  in securing her a husband. The lady was attractive, comely, capable of
  earning money and of gentle birth, and the busybody believed that he could
  find for her some reputable, well-to-do husband. Mary was at this time
  overworked and stung with poverty:</p>

  <p>"I am ill. I stayed in bed this morning till eleven o'clock only thinking
  of getting money to extricate myself out of some of my difficulties."</p>

  <p>The suggestion that she should, as it were, sell her person for financial
  consideration sickened her with disgust. She thus describes the matter in a
  most indignant, agitated letter to Mr. Johnson:</p>

  <p>"Mr. &mdash;&mdash; called upon me just now. Pray did you know his motive
  for calling? I think him impertinently officious. He had left the house
  before it occurred to me in the strong light it does now or I should have
  told him so. My poverty makes me proud. I will not be insulted by a
  superficial puppy. His intimacy with Miss &mdash;&mdash; gave him a privilege
  that he should not have assumed with me. A proposal might be made to his
  cousin, a milliner's girl, but it should not have been mentioned to me. Pray
  tell him that I am offended and do not wish to see him again! When I meet him
  at your house I shall leave the room if I cannot pull him by the nose. I can
  force my spirit to leave my body, but it shall never bend to support that
  body. God of Heaven, save thy child from a living death! I scarcely know what
  I write and my hand trembles. I am very sick&mdash;sick at heart."</p>

  <p>To the offender himself Mary wrote:</p>

  <p>"Sir, when you left me this morning and I reflected a moment&mdash;your
  <i>officious</i> message, which at first appeared to me a joke&mdash;looked
  so very like an insult&mdash;I cannot forget it. To prevent, then, the
  necessity of forcing a smile&mdash;when I chance to meet you, I take the
  earliest opportunity of informing you of my real sentiments.</p>

  <p>"Mary Wollstonecraft."</p>

  <p>On the unhappy man's trying to explain himself, Mary replied:</p>

  <p>"Sir, it is inexpressibly disagreeable to me to be obliged to enter again
  on a subject that has already raised a tumult of indignant emotions in my
  bosom, which I was labouring to suppress when I received your letter. I shall
  now <i>condescend</i> to answer your epistle, but let me first tell you that,
  in my unprotected situation, I make a point of never forgiving a deliberate
  insult, and in that light I consider your late officious conduct. It is not
  according to my nature to mince matters...as a mere acquaintance you were
  rude and cruel to set forth to insult a woman whose conduct and misfortune
  demands respect. If my friend Mr. Johnson had made the proposal I should have
  been severely hurt and thought him unkind and unfeeling, but not
  <i>impertinent</i>...I am, sir, poor and destitute, yet I have a spirit that
  will never bend or take indirect methods to obtain the consequence I despise.
  Nay, if to support life it is necessary to act contrary to my principles, my
  struggle will soon be over. I can bear anything but my own contempt. In a few
  words, what I call an insult is the bare supposition that I could for a
  moment think of prostituting my person for maintenance, and from that point
  of view does such a marriage appear to me..."</p>

  <p>Some of Mary's letters to her publisher show that she was very weary of
  the hackwork she was employed on, and that the illusion of freedom had soon
  faded and the joys of self-renunciation soon withered:</p>

  <p>"I send you <i>all</i> the books I had to review except Dr. James's
  Sermons, which I have begun. If you wish me to look over any more trash this
  month&mdash;you must send it directly...If you do not like the manner in
  which I have reviewed Dr. James's Sermons on his wife let it be known to you
  I will not do it any other way."</p>

  <p>Then, when she was in a better mood:</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, I send you a chapter which I am pleased with now I see it in
  one point of view. As I have made free with the author I hope you will not
  have often to say 'What does this mean?' You forget you were to make out my
  account&mdash;I am, of course, head over heels in debt; but I have not that
  kind of pride which makes some dislike to be obliged to those they
  respect."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The life of a literary lady living alone in a wretched room in the meanest
  fashion, spending all her earnings on others, did not, after all the bright
  expectations, prove much more satisfactory than the long, disgusting
  servitude that had preceded it. Mary was only a Grub Street hack, and, after
  the first curiosity aroused by her gesture of independence had worn off,
  regarded as little more.</p>

  <p>She was unsatisfied because the passing years brought no harvest. She was
  thirty years of age, still unloved, lonely, unattached to any save her
  relatives, who gave her little affection in return for her continual gifts of
  money. Her God of the Dissenters, whom she had once looked to for
  consolation, had withered in His anaemic Heaven, and Mary did not know where
  to look for a substitute.</p>

  <p>Intellectual interests might fill her head, but her heart was empty, and,
  though not romantic, she was, as she began uneasily to suspect, passionate,
  and she felt the need of an heroic affection, an overwhelming interest to
  absorb her emotions, her dreams, to give point and lustre to her barren
  days.</p>

  <p>Her longing for womanly fulfilment began to wear thin her pride and
  delicacy that had withstood, with dainty arrogance, everything but the warmth
  of these natural ardours.</p>

  <p>French affairs began to assume more and more importance in English eyes.
  It was Mary's great longing to go herself to Paris and study at first hand
  the events that seemed so glorious when viewed across the Channel. She could
  not, however, save sufficient money to do so, but she did send her sister
  Everina at the end of 1788 at her expense to Paris to learn French.</p>

  <p>By July of the following year the States General had met at Versailles,
  and the condition of France had become what Taine described as "spontaneous
  anarchy." Necker fell, Camille Desmoulins was inciting to revolution in the
  Palais-Royal, the Bastille was taken, and the first <i>migrs</i> crossed
  the French frontier.</p>

  <p>In the autumn the National Assembly was meeting in the <i>mange</i> at
  the Tuileries, amid unparalleled scenes of disorder and excitement. "More
  than once," wrote Arthur Young, "a hundred members were on their legs at a
  time, and Mr. Bailly absolutely without power to keep order."</p>

  <p>In 1791 the Assembly tried to put into practice the impossible ideals of
  the <i>Contrat Social</i>, and from his grave the Genevan philosopher ruled
  France. In September, 1791, the Committee that had been sitting since July,
  1789, finished drawing up the new Constitution, and the 4th of August heard,
  amid delirious scenes of enthusiasm, the Declaration of the Rights of Man.
  Mary followed all these events with the deepest interest. She was still
  employed in translating French pamphlets and articles from French newspapers,
  of which Mr. Johnson received a liberal supply, and she shared the
  extravagant hopes of the English intellectuals that this was the dawn of a
  new and glorious era not only for France but for the whole world.</p>

  <p>In November, 1790, Edmund Burke published <i>Reflections on the French
  Revolution</i>, in which he showed himself a stern partisan of the old order.
  Mary was the first of the many champions of French democracy to rush into
  print in reply, and her <i>Reply to Burke</i> attracted attention, mostly
  unfavourable to the female pamphleteer, but her effort was soon ignored, by
  both friend and foe, in the excitement caused by the publication of the first
  part of Tom Paine's <i>Rights of Man</i>. Mary had a personal interest in
  taking up Burke's challenge, as his book had been stimulated by a sermon
  given by her old friend Dr. Richard Price on the anniversary of the landing
  of William III. Mary's enthusiasm was deeply stirred by this controversy, and
  she was encouraged by a sense of her own power and the applause of her
  friends. In what time she could spare from her other work she began to put
  together, in fiery haste and glowing sincerity, another book. Her mundane
  cares continued. George Blood had now succeeded in finding for himself a good
  position in Dublin. He had remained faithful to the memory of Everina, and
  wrote to Mary to know if there was any hope of success. She replied in this
  letter:</p>

  <p>"Now, my dear George, let me more distinctly allude to our own affairs. I
  ought to have done so sooner, but there was an awkwardness in the business
  that made me shrink back. We have all, my good friend, a sisterly affection
  for you, and this very morning Everina declared to me that she had more
  affection for you than for either of her brothers. Accustomed to view you in
  that light, she cannot view you in any other. Let us, then, be on the old
  footing. Love us as we love you..."</p>

  <p>Everina returned from France to take up positions at schools in Putney and
  in Ireland. Eliza Bishop moved from Henley to Market Harborough, then to
  Putney, and then to Pembrokeshire. On her way to this last post, which proved
  to be a permanent one, Eliza Bishop visited the old farm of Laugharne, where
  her father was living alone with his second wife. Eliza wrote to Everina an
  account of her stay:</p>

  <p>"The sight of my father's ghastly visage haunts me night and day. He is
  really worn to a mere skeleton and has a dreadful cough that makes my blood
  run cold whenever I listen to it, and that is the greater part of the night,
  or else he groans most dreadfully, yet he declares he has good nights. There
  cannot be a more melancholy sight than to see him, unable to walk ten yards
  without panting for breath, and continually falling. Still, he is able to
  ride ten miles every day and eat and drink very hearty...I am harassed to the
  last degree how to advise him to act. If he gives up his horse now he is a
  dead man in a very short time. When I beg of him to be more careful in money
  matters, he declares he will go to London and force Ned, or when I tell him
  how Mary has been distressed in order to make him save in trifles, he is in a
  passion and exhausts himself. He is mad to be in London..."</p>

  <p>Eliza Bishop had also melancholy news to tell of the younger brother, who
  had been taken by his father from the farm where Mary had placed him and
  brought home:</p>

  <p>"Charles is half-naked and speaks to my father in the way that he
  deserves, for he is at him perpetually, he never even tried to get him into
  the Excise or anything else. He has actually altered rather for the better,
  drinks never anything but water and is much thinner, and all submission. He
  now talks of enlisting for a soldier; if he does there is an end of it. I am
  very cool at Charles and have said all I can to rouse him, but where can he
  go in his present plight?"</p>

  <p>When she reached Upton Castle, Eliza wrote again to her sister:</p>

  <p>"Were you to see my father's countenance! It is now I really think the
  most dreadful face I ever beheld. It appears constantly convulsed by
  ill-humour and every other evil feeling that can be expressed. His face is
  quite red, his hair grey and dirty, his beard long, and the clothes he wears
  not worth sixpence. In this plight he arrived at Upton the third night after
  my arrival, hearing my portmanteau was lost. I was strolling out with the
  girls and was surprised to meet Mr. Rees coming to meet us, and not less so
  when he stretched out his friendly hand to shake mine, saying, 'Who do you
  think has come to Upton? Your father, in his old clothes too, poor man. He
  thought you had lost your box.' The good man really thought I should be
  alarmed at my father's appearance and was anxious to see me first. After
  keeping me awake the whole night, he went to Laugharne in the morning,
  displeased, I believe, at not being asked to spend the day. If you had seen
  the good old man trying to behave so that I might think he was pleased with
  my father. He is in truth a most amiable man, though not a very pleasant,
  sensible one."</p>

  <p>This Mr. Rees, who tried to soften the extreme unpleasantness of a visit
  from Mr. Wollstonecraft during Eliza Bishop's first two days in her new
  position, seems to have been the tutor who had married the
  waiting-maid&mdash;"from what motive, I cannot say," as Eliza remarked. A few
  days later she wrote another letter, which proved Upton Castle to have been
  as disagreeable from a governess's point of view as Mitchelstown had
  been:</p>

  <p>"The only thing that here resembles man is a noble Newfoundland dog and a
  fine greyhound...The way to the house is through a fine wood, dreadfully
  neglected, so much so that one can hardly find a path in it surrounded by
  hills. Close to the castle is an old chapel and near it is a cross shaded by
  a yew tree and many a lofty ash at a distance...The library no one values,
  though it is a most excellent one...My room leads to a large
  drawing-room...it has a door at one end and opens and gives a full view of
  the woods. Here I often sit when all are fast asleep, as it is quite away
  from their roosting place...The girls have dozens of gowns, never worn, which
  they only look at. They have never even been permitted to walk on account of
  wearing out shoes. Send me a few wax tapers, for the farthing one often falls
  to my share and we go to bed very early."</p>

  <p>Thus wrote Eliza Bishop, by the light of her rush dip, to Mary in her
  Blackfriars garret, with Europe bursting into flames for a background. Mary,
  who had never had any romantic attachment to a man, and who affected to scorn
  matrimony, began to feel profoundly affected by one of her fellow writers on
  the <i>Analytical Review</i>, a bizarre and attractive personality. This was
  Henry Fuseli, the Swiss scholar and painter, whom Mary had first met in the
  autumn of 1790 when she was most agitated, despondent and tired of her
  self-imposed life of sacrifice, poverty and drudgery. She had often declared,
  in defence of her spinsterhood, that if she could not find a man whose
  grandeur of intellect and nobility of soul she could wholeheartedly admire
  she was determined to live in celibacy.</p>

  <p>Mary's person developed late. At this period she was better looking than
  she had been as a girl, and was, indeed, considered very attractive. Her
  shape had become rounded. As her health improved she lost her haggard look
  and her rich complexion became dazzlingly clear. Her small, rather babyish
  features retained their softness; neither fatigue nor illness nor anxiety had
  left any trace on them, and though she was clumsy in her attire she was very
  nice in her person. She talked too much and too fluently, indulging with zest
  most of the idealistic nonsense common to her circle; but her voice was low
  and pleasing, and most people felt a certain charm in her shy, melancholy
  manner. She had met at the houses of Mrs. Trimmer, Miss Hayes and Mr. Johnson
  many interesting and, perhaps, fascinating men&mdash;among them Bonnycastle,
  George Fordyce, George Anderson and Dr. Geddes. Mary admired all these, but
  with cold detachment. When, however, she gradually became intimate with Henry
  Fuseli, she felt her senses as well as her mind turn to admiration. This
  painter, an original and successful artist, was then nearly fifty years of
  age, and had recently married an Englishwoman, the young and attractive
  Sophia Rawlings of Bath.</p>

  <p>Henry Fuseli had a dominant and brilliant personality, which made him
  conspicuous even among the extraordinary people who formed the literary
  society with which Mary Wollstonecraft mingled. He had always been
  fascinating to women, and in his youth had roused tender emotions in the
  breasts of two celebrated female painters, Angelica Kauffmann and Mary Moser.
  He was tall, well-formed, with fine classic features, a quantity of fair hair
  tossed on a broad brow, and was, in the prime of his life, full of enthusiasm
  and power. He had lately been elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and
  was then living in Queen Anne Street and helping out his modest earnings as a
  painter with literary work of the same kind as that which Mary Wollstonecraft
  undertook. The year before he met her he had brought out a translation of his
  friend Lavater's <i>Aphorisms on Man</i>. It had been published by Johnson.
  In his preface Fuseli excused this work offhandedly by saying that if some of
  the maxims were truisms, so were the proverbs of Solomon, and that "if some
  are not new, they are recommended by an air of novelty." Lavater and Fuseli,
  "The Sage of the South," were both enthusiasts in the cause of what they
  termed "Liberty," and it was on account of a brush with authority that Fuseli
  had had to leave his own country.</p>

  <p>Johann Kaspar Lavater, founder of the Helvetic Society and pastor of St.
  Peter's Church, Zurich, was a man who had a considerable influence in his own
  day. He wasted an immense amount of time and money on what he termed the
  science of Physiognomy. This mistaken zeal, however, brought him much fame,
  if financial ruin, and many learned people believed that the Swiss pastor had
  really discovered an infallible method of judging the character from the
  features. Mary translated Lavater's book on this subject. <i>The Aphorisms on
  Man</i>, which Fuseli put into English, is chiefly notable for serving as a
  model to William Blake for his "Proverbs." This artist also was employed by
  Johnson, and had made two woodcuts for Mary's second published work on
  education.</p>

  <p>Henry Fuseli was then working for Johnson translating many of the French
  political pamphlets that found such a ready sale among the English public,
  writing also <i>prcis</i> of them for the <i>Analytical Review</i>. He and
  Mary, therefore, had a great enthusiasm in common, and the painter, an
  impatient and impetuous talker who liked to have the field to himself, was
  gradually drawn into a friendship with Mary, who was a type of woman whom he
  did not care about. Not only had he no liking for learned
  ladies&mdash;"philosophical slovens," as he termed them&mdash;but he was shy,
  and found it difficult to make new acquaintances. Happy with his neat and
  pretty young wife, the fastidious artist marked with disapproval Mary
  Wollstonecraft's lank hair, black worsted stockings and drugget gown. She,
  however, was deeply impressed by the vital personality of this fascinating
  man. She declared him to be possessed of noble qualities, "grandeur of soul,
  quickness of comprehension and lively sympathy," and, without much
  encouragement on his part, she became a frequent visitor at his house, where
  he was engaged on his extraordinary drawings and paintings and held forth
  with a fluency that surpassed that of Mary herself on "Liberty" and "The
  Rights of Man." Mary Wollstonecraft had no interest in art. She had already
  some slight acquaintance with William Blake. He had already published his
  Lyric Poems and the early Prophecies; and in his rooms in Pole Street,
  overlooking Aspley Circus, he had drawn some beautiful illustrations for one
  of Mary's earliest works, but neither the man nor his genius had made any
  impression upon her. Nor did she give any attention to the remarkable
  creations of Henry Fuseli. This artist's productions show a rare and wild
  imagination. His most successful subject was entitled <i>The Nightmare</i>.
  He had painted many versions of this gloomy idea. The painting represented a
  woman tossed in an unnatural attitude upon a couch while a huge horse of a
  supernatural size trampled the air above. So popular was this subject that
  Fuseli was said to have made five hundred pounds by the sale of small prints,
  sold at a low price, taken from it. Other pictures that Fuseli had painted
  were <i>The Weird Sisters</i>, <i>Lady Macbeth Walking in her Sleep</i>, some
  subjects for Boydel's Shakespeare Gallery, the most successful of which was
  supposed to be that representing the ghost of Hamlet's father, and several
  other bold and startling conceptions based upon Shakespeare or Scripture.</p>

  <p>The versatile Fuseli was also an elegant classical scholar, and had been
  asked by Mr. Johnson to revise William Cowper's translation of the
  <i>Iliad</i>, which he did without any payment. The poet of Olney, the
  foremost literary man of the day, confessed himself deeply indebted to the
  artist for his corrections, and described Fuseli as a "gentleman of exquisite
  taste and learning." Fuseli was considered by his intimates to be also a wit,
  as well as a brilliant talker. His conversation, however, was often like his
  pictures&mdash;wild and exasperating&mdash;and he would often so irritate Dr.
  Geddes that the Scot was obliged to leave Mr. Johnson's room and walk three
  or four times round St. Paul's Churchyard to cool his temper. Geddes thought
  Fuseli a fanatic, and sometimes, with his repetition of platitudes, a bore,
  and once hastily exclaimed: "I wonder that you, Mr. Fuseli, who have so much
  ready wit, should be uttering dogmas by the hour together"&mdash;a rebuke
  that Fuseli answered with surely the most atrocious pun that has ever been
  uttered: "You, Doctor, to find fault with dogma! You are the son of a dog-ma
  yourself." This sally sent the outraged doctor into the air to calm himself.
  It is unfortunate that this is the only specimen of Fuseli's reputed wit that
  has come down to us.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft, however, was not looking for wit or humour. She had
  no appreciation of either quality. It was Fuseli's character that she
  admired. Not only was she a frequent visitor at his house&mdash;she began to
  write him letters full of warm admiration. His brilliancy really dazzled her.
  Never before had she met a man with such knowledge of the classics, of
  literature, of the fine arts, with a retentive memory, lively imagination and
  a fascinating delivery.</p>

  <p>"I always," she said, "catch something from the rich torrent of his
  conversation worth treasuring up in my memory to exercise my
  understanding."</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft was now on the verge of making herself ridiculous and
  of gratifying the spite of those who condemned her manner of life. When past
  thirty years of age, she had discovered that she was not sexless, and, urged
  by those emotions that she herself had always scorned, she began to make
  herself conspicuous by her open admiration of Henry Fuseli. It was time, for
  her own happiness and self-fulfilment, that she was attached to someone, but
  Fuseli was an unfortunate choice; not only was he married, but he was
  entirely indifferent to Mary: indeed, he disliked her type. He was also well
  used to feminine admiration, and took but little notice of the numerous
  letters that she sent him, even thrusting many of them, that he knew but to
  be full of expressions of admiration, unread into his pocket.</p>

  <p>Mary, however, was not easily rebuffed. She was confused herself by the
  vague, grand sentiments that she professed. Her affection for Fuseli, she
  declared, was based upon the loftiest motives, and she said to her
  acquaintances that she could not see why she should not have a place in
  Fuseli's heart, owing to their congeniality of sentiments and talents. She
  hoped, she admitted, "to unite herself to his mind." Deluded by this piece of
  sophistry, she did what she could to please the Swiss painter. Her poverty
  had been so ostentatious that when Talleyrand, the Bishop of Autun, called on
  her during his English visit she gave him tea and wine indifferently out of
  the same cup, thus attesting her severe republican simplicity. Now, anxious
  to gain the good opinion of Fuseli, she moved to pleasanter apartments in
  Store Street, which she furnished with some comfort, and paid more attention
  to her dress than she had hitherto done. She was now earning, if not much
  money, yet sufficient to be able to spend a little on becoming attire and
  fashionable hairdressing. These efforts made a great improvement in her
  charms. She was accounted very handsome and rather remarkable.</p>

  <p>At this period of her life she shook off much of the lassitude and
  melancholy that hitherto had disfigured her manners. Insisting on the
  "rights" of her platonic friendship, she began to accuse Fuseli of neglect,
  and he, exasperated by this turn, avoided her as much as possible. Mary had,
  however, the great resource of her period. She wrote and wrote, covering up
  the fact that she had fallen in love with turgid phrases in which she at once
  declared the strength of her feelings and their complete
  purity&mdash;"unalloyed" by passion, as she claimed.</p>

  <p>When Fuseli reasoned with her that this emotional friendship was getting
  beyond the bounds of decency and comfort, she replied:</p>

  <p>"If I thought my passion criminal, I would conquer it or die in the
  attempt, but immodesty in my eyes is ugliness. My soul turns in disgust from
  the pleasure and the charms which swamp the light of Heaven."</p>

  <p>While Mary was being agitated and harassed by this affair, by the conflict
  between a strong sexual attachment and an ardent desire to make her behaviour
  conform to lofty standards, she was occupied with her original work that
  deeply engaged her abilities and was inspired by the interest of the English
  intellectuals in the proceedings in France, which had increased to an
  extraordinary degree. Hardly anything else was discussed in their coterie but
  those exciting events the other side of the Channel that, from the day that
  the Bastille, symbol of ancient tyranny, had fallen to the hands of the Paris
  mob, seemed to be advancing gloriously towards the Millennium.</p>

  <p>Mary was also still under the influence of Burke's famous pamphlet, and
  felt that her answer that was hastily put together and couched in violent
  language had been inadequate. Mary had been exasperated, not so much by
  Burke's horrified pity for the sufferings of the French royal family and the
  destitution of the French aristocrat refugees, who were then beginning to
  swarm in England, as by his class feeling. Hers was equally strong. She had
  spoken vehemently for those to whom she belonged, whose struggles she had
  seen close at hand, who had all her sympathies&mdash;the poor. While Burke
  argued that the rights of men were those that an aristocracy claimed from
  successful and powerful ancestors, Mary, with a good deal of bitterness, put
  forward the claim of the peasant and the slum town dweller, the underdog to
  whom no one had given a thought until now. Mary's view of the French
  Revolution was, at least at this time, that all the excesses of the French
  people might be attributed to the long-continued miseries and degradations
  the lower classes had endured at the hands of kings, the nobles, the clergy.
  She longed to enlarge on this theme, and she was indifferent to the fact that
  her fiery diatribe had not, save among a few Radicals, improved her
  reputation, either as a woman or as a writer.</p>

  <p>Not only did her pamphlet show that the writer lacked all powers of calm
  reasoning and was not very well informed on the matters she was endeavouring
  to expound, but it was full of personal abuse and that vindictive railing
  supposed to sit peculiarly ill upon a woman. The bulk of the British nation
  felt as strongly as did Mary on the subject of the Revolution, but their
  sympathies were all on the other side. While the intellectual, the Radical,
  the Liberal, the journalist and the poet applauded every week more eagerly
  the successes of the Republicans, the great majority of the nation regarded
  with increasing horror the tumult in France. Therefore Mary, by her answer to
  Burke, became to the public unpleasantly conspicuous as a termagant, a
  virago, an unsexed female. They did not notice her warm sympathy, her ardent
  championship of the poor and oppressed; but they remarked that she showed
  only scorn for the French royal family, whose fate was arousing in England
  such profound horror.</p>

  <p>Henry Fuseli approved of Mary's book. He was as much dazzled as any of his
  contemporaries with these brilliant catchwords&mdash;Liberty, Freedom, The
  Rights of Man&mdash;and planned a visit to Paris to congratulate the patriots
  in person.</p>

  <p>Excited by the notice she had attracted, by the dangerous friendship with
  Fuseli, and perhaps a little losing her head, Mary finished her second work.
  This was entitled <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>. It was
  dedicated to Talleyrand, late Bishop of Autun, whose pamphlet on <i>National
  Education</i> Mary much admired, and whose sincerity she did not suspect.</p>

  <p>Mary had never lost the enthusiasm with which she had heard of the
  American Declaration of Rights and of the Charter that the French had drawn
  up on that model entitled Declaration of the Rights of Man. It might have
  been supposed that the term "Man" in this case meant the whole of humanity,
  but Mary took it to mean that her own sex had been neglected, and felt that
  it was necessary to put forward "The Rights of Woman." She had also been
  exasperated by many contentious and, as she thought, dangerous books on
  female education, notably those by Dr. Gregory and Dr. Fordyce, and been
  stung by the attitude that Rousseau, the most discussed and most influential
  author of the moment, had taken up towards the education of women. Although
  the Genevan had had so much to say about the training of boys that Mary
  Wollstonecraft thoroughly approved, he had plainly stated his opinion that
  girls should be educated only to please and comfort men; indeed, he seemed to
  subscribe to that old doctrine which Mary so detested, that a woman should be
  either a goddess or a slave, and in either case subject to a man's
  caprice.</p>

  <p>Mary had also her own experience burning in her mind and heart. The wrongs
  inflicted on her and those dear to her by unworthy males still rankled.
  Inflamed both by these remembrances and by the spirit of the time, Mary flung
  on paper in a somewhat slovenly fashion her <i>Vindication of the Rights of
  Woman</i>, and in 1791 it was published by the approving Mr. Johnson.</p>

  <p>The book brought her some fame and a good deal of notoriety. It was the
  challenging title and the uncommon personality and sex of the author that
  provoked opposition and gave offence.</p>

  <p>Had the work appeared as yet another <i>Advice to Daughters</i> and been
  written by a divine, it would probably have passed almost unnoticed, for
  Mary, after all, had nothing very startling to say and certainly very little
  that was new. Her work was swollen with platitudes and padded with turgid
  rhetoric, and it was entirely on the side of virtue&mdash;as that word was
  understood in the last decade of the eighteenth century.</p>

  <p>Mary's main plea was for equality of education between men and women, for
  training women for remunerative employment so that they should not be wholly
  dependent upon marriage as a means of support, for treating women with
  respect instead of either adoration or contempt, and for emphasising the
  intellectual instead of the physical aspect of sexual intercourse. Marriage,
  Mary argued, if intended for lasting happiness, should be based upon the
  mind, upon the reason, not upon the heart or the passions. She pleaded that a
  woman was degraded by masculine courtesies and flatteries that but hid
  self-interested contempt, and she wished women to stand on their own feet and
  meet men on terms of complete equality in every aspect of life. All this had
  been already expounded by Thomas Day in Sandford and Merton, and when it came
  from him had been listened to with approval; but from Mary Wollstonecraft it
  was not accepted. Some of the books that she most vigorously attacked,
  declaring that they were even indecent in their ideas of sex and of female
  education, and that their insinuations gave her a "sickly qualm," had long
  been mainstays of British domesticity, and Mary's abuse of the two
  influential divines, Dr. Gregory and Dr. Fordyce, was deeply resented. Her
  attacks on Rousseau might have been by many very well tolerated, but she
  shocked the majority of her countrypeople by insinuating that she did not
  believe in eternal punishment, and by showing an exhaustive knowledge of the
  uglier side of life.</p>

  <p>Neither of these things could be forgiven. Mary boldly stated that she was
  aware of many social sores that women, even if they knew of them, never
  mentioned. She wrote with scorn of the vices and follies of fashionable men
  and women, as she had herself observed them. All the mental notes that she
  had made while she had been a companion in Bath, Bristol and Ireland served
  her now as material on which to base her pictures of modern society.</p>

  <p>In conformity with the taste of her age, she adopted a sermonising tone,
  coloured too often with a railing, vindictive, almost abusive air that
  considerably damaged her cause. According to her there was little good in
  either man or woman; both were being educated on entirely wrong lines and
  with false ideals. She exposed with scorn all the sentimentalities, tender
  hypocrisies and intricate graces by which the most delicate and complex of
  human relationships had always been disguised. She would have all founded
  upon reason. She was by no means against marriage, but it must not be a
  marriage based upon finance, passion or caprice. She wanted boys and girls to
  be educated together. She believed that this reform would do away with many
  of the vices prevalent in schools that she mentioned with great plainness of
  speech. In various passages the book rose to genuine eloquence, but for the
  most part it was disfigured not only by the scolding tone that gave an
  unpleasant tinge to the whole composition, but by partiality, confusion of
  thought and prejudice.</p>

  <p>The book was greatly disliked by those who did not read it. The mere title
  gave these people great offence. Horace Walpole, arbiter of elegant taste,
  considered the authoress a virago, "a hyena in petticoats," and Hannah More,
  a highly intelligent, very successful woman, who had achieved independence
  and recognition of her gifts without violating the strictest decorum,
  entirely repudiated Mary Wollstonecraft's championship of her sex. "Rights,
  indeed," she wrote. "I am sure that I have always had more rights than were
  good for me."</p>

  <p>The book, in short, earned more notoriety than applause, though Mary's own
  circle admired the production warmly, and at once placed her in the forefront
  of the intelligentsia of the day. She became, in her way, a celebrity, was
  received as an equal by women like Mrs. Siddons, Mrs. Inchbald and Mrs.
  Barbauld, while Mr. Johnson, proud of his successful young authoress, asked
  her to meet all the famous, interesting or influential people who passed
  through his rooms.</p>

  <p>Among these was William Godwin, afterwards author of <i>Political
  Justice</i> (published 1793), a Radical philosopher, a follower of Rousseau,
  an atheist and a literary man of considerable gifts. His education had
  consisted of rather formidable studies at a dame-school and under Dr. Rees
  and that Dr. Kippis who had patronised Hannah More. At the Hoxton Academy
  Godwin learnt philosophy from the point of view of a dissenting
  minister&mdash;he was one himself for four years&mdash;but when Mary met him
  he was in the very forefront of English Radicalism, cold-hearted, rational,
  precise and methodical to an exasperating degree. He performed, however, with
  great exactitude and even with the semblance of affection all the natural
  duties of man, being kind to his mother, his sister and his friends, and
  scrupulously loyal to his own standards of honour and honesty. He was also
  pedantic, tiresome, a boring talker, a dry, humourless companion; nor was his
  appearance by any means attractive&mdash;an enormous nose spoilt what might
  have been the classic outline of his face, he had early lost his hair, and
  his eyes, though described by his admirers as noble, were large and goggling.
  He prided himself on the austere, or rather slovenly, bachelor establishment
  he kept. His clothes were, as befitted a philosopher, neglected.</p>

  <p>Among Godwin's teachings was a plea for a complete break with convention.
  This, however, the philosopher did not exemplify in his own life. He admitted
  that the time had not yet come for his theories to be put into practice, and
  he was much against revolution or the hasty trying out of new experiments.
  <i>Political Justice</i> came out at the high price of three guineas, to his
  own satisfaction, and, he declared, by his own desire, for he wished to keep
  these startling thoughts and novel doctrines from the hands of the vulgar. It
  was supposed to be the high price that had prevented the Government from
  prosecuting Godwin for his daring doctrines. A book at three guineas, argued
  the Ministers, might as well have not been written, as far as the mob were
  concerned, and what did it matter what inflammable material was scattered
  about among a group of insignificant intellectuals? Godwin believed that all
  property, including women, should be in common, that every action should be
  undertaken by the light of reason, and that if there was perfect freedom
  there would be no vice or crime. He was much respected by his friends and
  acquaintances, and by a few, such as the faithful Marshall and Thomas
  Holcroft, warmly admired. He was always in financial difficulties, a
  circumstance rather hard to explain, for he earned considerable sums of
  money, and his large swarm of poor relatives did not seem to obtain much
  assistance from his purse. Somehow the money was muddled away by the plain
  living philosopher, and his life was from first to last a series of loans and
  complications that proved afterwards too much for the business capacities and
  honest goodwill of the famous Francis Place to disentangle. He had his fair
  share of vanity, and had quarrelled not only with the orthodox, but with men
  like Doctor Parr and Sir James Mackintosh, who had criticised his ethics. It
  was to his credit that Samuel Coleridge concerned himself with him, and even
  was successful in converting the philosopher to theism.</p>

  <p>In order to earn money he wrote fiction and proved, strangely and
  unexpectedly, a brilliant novelist. His book, <i>The Adventures of Caleb
  Williams</i>, dramatised as <i>The Iron Chest</i>, published in 1795, was a
  singularly fine piece of work and at once successful.</p>

  <p>The philosopher, who had an indulgent eye for a pretty woman and who had
  turned over in a placid fashion several projects of marriage with some of his
  charming acquaintances&mdash;projects not encouraged by the ladies
  concerned&mdash;was not immediately impressed by Mary Wollstonecraft. He had
  gone to Johnson's house to meet the famous Tom Paine. Paine was a man who
  spoke little, and Mary, also in the company, spoke too much. Godwin, who did
  not like the title <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>, and had not
  read the book, but who had glanced at some other works of Mary's and detected
  some grammatical errors in them, regarded the bold feminist coldly and merely
  endured her flow of conversation while he endeavoured to goad Paine into a
  philosophical discussion.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary began to think herself very exceptional, and it was no wonder, for
  she was surrounded with people who chose to regard her as the first to
  vindicate "the rights of women." With a little more wit and humour and a
  little less enthusiasm, both Mary and her supporters might have reflected for
  a moment on the enormous amount of female influence that had gone to shape
  the society both of England and of the Continent. They seemed to have
  entirely forgotten the ladies of Port Royal, the ladies of the <i>htel de
  Rambouillet</i>, the ladies of the eighteenth century <i>salons</i>, such as
  Julie de Lespinasse, and such lovers of political and social change as Madame
  de Maintenon and Madame de Pompadour, and English women like Lady Russell and
  Queen Mary II, who had set the tone for a whole generation, been forward in
  good works and raised high the standard of piety and charity; they had
  forgotten Queen Anne and Lady Marlborough. They were perhaps ignorant that
  Lord Burleigh, England's greatest statesman, had relied much during his long
  life on the advice of his wife, one of the famous Coke sisters. They were
  also possibly not aware that in Italy, within a few years of the publication
  of Mary's book, a learned lady had been buried in the robes of a Doctor in
  recognition of her gifts and attainments; and the learned and admired Mary
  Astell, who had written, not so long before, <i>An Essay in Defence of the
  Female Sex</i>, was quite forgotten.</p>

  <p>Henry Fuseli's admirers&mdash;Angelica Kauffmann, Mary Moser&mdash;had
  found no difficulty in obtaining recognition of their talents. Indeed, it
  seemed rather as if, when a woman possessed a gift, she was more eagerly
  welcomed than her masculine counterpart.</p>

  <p>All this was ignored by Mary's enthusiastic admirers. They all regarded
  Mary as the vague star of that dawn which was shortly to irradiate over the
  future of her sex. By those who thoroughly disapproved of the book without
  reading it Mary was represented as one who was entirely revolutionary in her
  ideas, atheistical, and an advocate for emancipation not only from custom,
  but from morality. Among those most deeply irritated and shocked by the
  publication of this book were the writer's own sisters. Eliza and Everina had
  for some while resented Mary's success. They accepted her help, her money and
  the shelter of her home and the introductions to her influential friends, but
  resented the means by which she was able to procure these benefits. They
  thought her independent mode of life unwomanly and viewed with jealousy, and
  perhaps envy, the ease with which she had passed into the literary circles of
  London while they remained poor governesses or companions. Even Charles, the
  ill-graced brother for whom she had done so much, was not above sneering at
  his sister's success. All three took the tone that, while Mary was pretending
  to toil for them, she was also doing very well for herself. They noticed,
  with mean sneers, her improved appearance, and watched without sympathy her
  struggles to reduce her admiration for Henry Fuseli to some formula
  consistent with her views.</p>

  <p>Feeling against Mary Wollstonecraft's ideas was very strong, not only
  among men, but among intelligent women. Most people favoured the opinion that
  a decent obscurity best suited even the most brilliant females, and writers
  on the ethics of sex were apt to express themselves thus:</p>

  <p>"The best woman, says Pericles, is she of whom least is said, either in
  the way of good or harm. The greatest ornament of woman is silence, and to
  remain at home her chief duty&mdash;owl, muzzle and reins were on the tombs
  of Greek housewives. Plato rejoiced that he was not a woman, Swift considered
  them as but a higher kind of monkey, Turks refused them souls."</p>

  <p>No more than ten years after the publication of Mary's challenging book, a
  woman as wise and brilliant as herself, Sidney Owenson, Lady Morgan,
  wrote:</p>

  <p>"The strongest point of my ambition is to be every inch a woman...I
  dropped the study of chemistry lest I should be thought less the woman...I
  have studied music as a sentiment rather than a science, and drawing as an
  amusement rather than an art, lest I should become a musical pedant or a
  masculine artist."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary was now known as Mrs. Wollstonecraft in consideration of the literary
  position she had attained, and this dignity also irritated her sisters. She
  was, however, still solicitous for their futures, and suggested that Eliza
  should go to France for a year to study the language so that she might on her
  return be able to command a higher salary or obtain a well-paid post in a
  school. She intended to go to France herself. Many of the English
  sympathisers with the Revolutionaries had already gone to Paris; some of them
  had adopted French nationality. Mary knew many of these people. Some of them
  had fled from England on a warning that their activities might be regarded as
  pernicious by the British Government. It was William Blake that had urged the
  only Englishman to wear the red cap in public, Tom Paine, author of <i>The
  Rights of Man</i>, to fly from London; in fact, the entire circle in which
  Mary moved was regarded with suspicion by authority. In Paris were
  established the Christies, who were well known to Mary, Madame Filiettaz, who
  had been Mlle. Bregantz, the daughter of a lady in whose school at Putney
  both Mrs. Bishop and Everina Wollstonecraft had been teachers. In Paris, too,
  was the English poetess Helen Maria Williams, to whom Mary had an
  introduction. She hoped also to meet those men who had inspired her warm
  admiration, the leaders of the Gironde, those ineffectual but sincere
  idealists who were then attempting the impossible task of governing France
  according to J. J. Rousseau. In Paris, too, were many English journalists,
  writers and artists. Mary herself hoped to write some account of the French
  Revolution, she had already studied French history with some thoroughness.
  Moreover at this time Mary was restless, discontented, tormented by her
  feelings for Henry Fuseli.</p>

  <p>This artist was also eager to visit Paris, and so was Mr. Johnson. It was
  therefore agreed that the party of four (that included Mrs. Fuseli) should go
  to Paris in the summer of 1792. Mary did not take very much money with her,
  and she kept on her room in Store Street, for she did not intend to be away
  from England more than a few months. How her schemes were viewed by her
  relatives is shown by the letter that Eliza wrote to Everina from Upton
  Castle, where she was still in residence as a governess:</p>

  <p>"Charles informs me that Mrs. Wollstonecraft is grown quite handsome; he
  adds likewise that being conscious that she is on the wrong side of thirty,
  she now endeavours to set off those charms she once despised to the best
  advantage...</p>

  <p>"So the author of <i>The Rights of Woman</i> is going to France! I dare
  say her chief motive is to promote poor Bess's comfort or thine, my girl, at
  least, I think she will thus reason. Well, in spite of reason, when Mrs. W.
  reaches the Continent she will be but a woman. I cannot help painting her in
  the height of all her wishes, at the very summit of happiness, for will not
  ambition fill every chink of her great soul (such I really think hers) that
  is not occupied by love? After having drawn this sketch you can hardly
  suppose me so sanguine as to expect my pretty face will be thought of when
  matters of state are in agitation, yet I know you think such a miracle not
  impossible. I wish I could think it at all probable, but alas! it has so much
  the appearance of castle building that I think it will soon disappear like
  the 'baseless fabric of a vision that leaves not a wrack behind.'</p>

  <p>"And you actually have the vanity to imagine that in the National Assembly
  personages like Mary and Fuseli will bestow a thought on two females whom
  nature meant to suckle fools and chronicle small beer."</p>

  <p>Mary had not made her sisters her <i>confidantes</i> in her own emotional
  affairs, though they had heard gossip and rumours. She had written to Everina
  of the trip to Paris in guarded terms:</p>

  <p>"I have been considering what you say respecting Eliza's residence in
  France. For some time past Mr. and Mrs. Fuseli, Mr. Johnson and myself have
  talked of a summer excursion to Paris. It is now determined on and we think
  of going in about six weeks. I shall be introduced to many people. My book
  has been translated and praised in some popular prints, and Mr. Fuseli of
  course is well known. It is then very probable that I shall hear of some
  situation for Eliza, and I shall be on the watch. We intend to be absent only
  six weeks; if then I fix on an eligible situation for her, she may avoid the
  Welsh winter. This journey will not lead me into any extraordinary expense,
  or I should put it off to a more convenient season. I am not, as you may
  suppose, very flush of money. Charles is wearing out the clothes that were
  provided for his voyage, still, I am glad he has acquired a little practical
  knowledge of farming."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>One of the main attractions that the project of a trip to Paris possessed
  for Mary was the continual companionship of Henry Fuseli. They both were to
  write accounts of what they saw and to send their contributions to the
  <i>Analytical Review</i>. Fuseli was to introduce Mary to his many French
  friends, and they were to attend side by side the Assembly and watch the
  patriots who stood, as it were, at the very core of Liberty, and to hear at
  its first utterance the eloquence that was providing catchwords for all the
  enthusiasts in Europe.</p>

  <p>Mary's hopes were, however, not realised. Her admiration for Henry Fuseli
  had not only attracted considerable attention among their friends, but roused
  the suspicion of the artist's wife. She was a good-natured woman and friendly
  herself with Mary, but being only a simple creature, she could not make the
  nice distinction that Mrs. Wollstonecraft did between intellectual and
  physical affection; in her view Mary was merely "in love" with Henry Fuseli,
  and she did not see herself playing the handmaiden to a man who spent most of
  his time with a fascinating Egeria. Mary, on the other hand, decided to put
  boldly into practice her own theory. She waited on Mrs. Fuseli and suggested
  that she should stay with her during the few days that were to elapse before
  they all started for Paris. She was, she declared, above deceit, and
  therefore did not hesitate to tell the alarmed wife: "The reason is the
  sincere affection which I have for your husband, for I cannot live without
  the satisfaction of seeing and conversing with him daily."</p>

  <p>This candour brought a difficult situation to a climax. Mrs. Fuseli
  answered courage with courage, and said that, far from its being desirable
  for Mary to enter her establishment, it would be necessary for her never to
  see Henry Fuseli again save in public. On these terms they might all remain
  friends.</p>

  <p>As the fascinating artist, with some emphasis, supported his wife, Mary
  was forced to endure this new distress with what strength she could muster.
  She behaved with considerable dignity. The journey with the Fuselis and
  Johnson to Paris was now impossible. She decided to go alone; restless,
  impatient and unhappy, she could not see herself returning to her lonely
  rooms in Store Street scribbling for a livelihood. It was considered a bold
  thing for a woman to go alone to Paris in the state that capital was then in,
  but Mary was never one to lack boldness. She wrote a letter to Henry Fuseli,
  asking him to forgive her "for having disturbed the quiet tenor of his life,"
  and on the 8th December, 1792, departed for Paris.</p>

  <p>When she found herself removed from Fuseli and considered the wide breach
  between them, her fortitude slightly gave way. She wrote to him, describing
  the condition of the French capital, and begged him to send her letters now
  and then; but, as there was no answer to this appeal, she did not write
  again.</p>

  <p>With that considerable energy of which she was capable, the melancholy
  woman tried to throw herself into the tumultuous politics that were agitating
  France and to add, if possible, her quota to the struggle for that liberty
  and happiness which she saw no prospect of herself enjoying.</p>

  <p class="first">MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT arrived in Paris soon after the
  elections to the National Convention, decreed by the Legislative Assembly in
  the previous August, had resulted in the election of the fanatic Republicans,
  Robespierre, Collot d'Herbois, Marat and Desmoulins as deputies for the
  capital.</p>

  <p>Among the methods of terrorism employed by the extremists to assure
  success, had been the four days' massacres in the prisons of Paris that had
  accounted for 1400 victims, and the plan of a general massacre in the
  provinces. But these things were not definitely known in England, and Mary
  was but one of hundreds of ardent foreign Republicans who resided in Paris,
  waiting hopefully for Utopia to be established, and singularly oblivious of
  such incidents as the pillaging of Paris during the elections, when valuables
  to the worth of 24,000,000 <i>livres</i> had been stolen from the
  Garde-Meuble, including the Crown diamonds, and the severe, virtuous Roland's
  account of the atrocities at Chlons-sur-Marne.</p>

  <p>On Sept. 21st the first meeting of the New Convention, consisting of 1782
  members, was held in the spacious riding school of the Palace of the
  Tuileries. Some attempt to restore at least an outward order in Paris was
  made, and, for the moment, the ascendency in the senate of the New Republic
  might be ascribed to the moderate intellectuals, the Brissotins or Gironde,
  those idealists who had given the first shape to the Revolution. It was to
  members of this party that Mary had introductions, and she hoped to meet them
  at the houses of her English friends. These moderates were, however, engaged
  in a life and death struggle with the violent Mountain, or Commune. Mary
  arrived in Paris in time to hear of Louvet's vigorous denunciation of
  Robespierre (Oct. 29th), and to learn soon after that Valaz had introduced
  the report of a Girondist Committee on the royal papers seized on August
  10th. The capital was full of rumours of the likelihood of the deposed king's
  being brought to trial. "Louis," declared Robespierre, "doit mourir parce
  qu'il faut que la patrie vive."</p>

  <p>Added to these internecine troubles, Republican France was at war with the
  enemy not far from her frontiers, and had not a friend in Europe. A huge camp
  of armed men occupied the northern suburbs of Paris, and in the summer of
  1792 it had been a fashionable amusement for men and women to dig
  fortifications. The building of ramparts had also been the excuse for the
  flocking of the rascal and the loafer to Paris, and even after the victory of
  Valmy the works continued to the alarm and peril of the capital.</p>

  <p>Yet on the surface life seemed normal in Paris, and Mary's first
  impression was of the lightness and frivolity of the people. She found the
  theatres open, the shoeblacks busy on the <i>Pont</i>-<i>Neuf</i>, the shops
  full of fans, teacups, sashes and toys adorned with the grave symbols of
  Liberty and Justice, luxuriously dressed women wearing coquettish
  "revolutionary" bonnets and scarves, expensively dressed <i>lgants</i> in
  the <i>cafs</i>, voluptuous <i>filles publiques</i> parading under the bare
  trees of the <i>Palais</i>-<i>Royal</i>, and housewives cheapening provisions
  in the market.</p>

  <p>She had intended to lodge with her friend Madame Filiettaz, but found the
  family away. Servants were, however, in charge of the establishment, a
  boarding school, and Mary took possession of one of the large dreary bedrooms
  in the spacious <i>htel</i>.</p>

  <p>She set herself with desperate energy to learn French and to note down all
  she saw about her. On December 3rd it had been decreed that Louis XVI should
  be tried by the Convention. On Christmas Day, 1792, Mary Wollstonecraft wrote
  to Everina:</p>

  <p>"To-morrow I expect to see Aline [Madame Filiettaz]. During her absence
  the servants endeavoured to render the house, a most excellent one,
  comfortable to me, but as I wish to acquire the language as fast as I can, I
  was sorry to be obliged to remain so much alone. I apply so closely to the
  language and labour so continually to understand what I hear that I never go
  to bed without a headache, and my spirits are fatigued with endeavouring to
  form a just opinion of public affairs. The day after to-morrow I expect to
  see the King at the Bar and the consequences that will follow I am almost
  afraid to anticipate. I have seen very little of Paris; the streets are so
  dirty and I wait till I can make myself understood before I call on Madame
  Laurent, etc. Miss Williams has behaved very civilly to me and I shall visit
  her frequently because I rather like her and I meet French company at her
  house. Her manners are affected, yet the simple goodness of her heart
  continually breaks through the varnish, so that one would be more inclined,
  at least I should, to love than admire her. Authorship is a heavy weight for
  female shoulders, especially in the sunshine of prosperity."</p>

  <p>Two days later, on the date that the King appeared at the Bar to plead by
  his advocate Desze, Mary wrote to Joseph Johnson:</p>

  <p>"I should immediately on receipt of your letter, my dear friend, thank you
  for your punctuality, for it highly gratified me, had I not wished to wait
  till I could tell you that this day is not stained with blood. Indeed, the
  prudent precautions taken by the National Convention to prevent a tumult make
  me suppose that the dogs of faction would not dare to bark, much less bite,
  however true to their scent, and I was not mistaken. The citizens who were
  all called out are returning home with composed countenances, shouldering
  their arms. About nine o'clock this morning the king passed by my window,
  moving silently along&mdash;excepting now and then a few strokes on the
  drums, which rendered the stillness more awful&mdash;through empty streets
  surrounded by the National Guards who clustering round the carriage seemed to
  deserve their name. The inhabitants flocked to their windows, but the
  casements were all shut; not a voice was heard, nor did I see anything like
  an insulting gesture. For the first time since I entered France I bowed to
  the majesty of the people and respected the propriety of behaviour so
  perfectly in unison with my own feelings. I can scarcely tell you why, but an
  association of ideas made the tears flow from my eyes when I saw Louis
  sitting, with more dignity than I expected from his character, in a hackney
  coach going to meet death where so many of his race have triumphed. My fancy
  instantly brought Louis XIV before me, entering the capital with all his pomp
  after one of the victories so flattering to his pride, only to see the
  sunshine of prosperity overshadowed by the sublime gloom. I have been alone
  ever since; and though my mind is calm, I cannot dismiss the lively images
  that have filled my imagination all the day. Nay do not smile, but pity me,
  for, once or twice lifting my eyes from the paper, I have seen eyes glare
  through a glass door opposite my chair and bloody hands shook at me. Not the
  distant sound of a footstep can I hear. My apartments are remote from those
  of the servants, the only persons who sleep with me in an immense hotel, one
  folding door opening after another. I wish I had even kept the cat with me. I
  want to see something alive. Death in so many frightful shapes has taken hold
  of my fancy. I am going to bed, and for the first time in my life I cannot
  put out the candle."</p>

  <p>These letters were the last that Mary's friends received for a long while,
  though she sent some manuscripts to Mr. Johnson.</p>

  <p>Her sisters were irritated at this long silence. The only news they had of
  affairs in France was confused and scanty; their feelings were entirely
  anti-revolutionary. From the isolation of Upton Castle, Eliza wrote to
  Everina, January 20th, 1793:</p>

  <p>"I can never get to see a paper and if any one of our Bears call, the
  whole family leaves the room when I say a word about politics, or else orders
  them to talk of something else, and of course the conversation turns on
  Murphy or Irish potatoes or Tommy Paine, whose effigy they burnt at Pembroke
  the other day. Ay, they talk of immortalising Miss Wollstonecraft in a like
  manner, but all end in Damning all Politics, and what good will they do men?
  and what right have men that three meals a day will not supply? So argues a
  Welshman. I heard a clergyman say he was sure there was no more harm in
  shooting a Frenchman than in lifting his piece at a bird..."</p>

  <p>Mary lingered in Paris long past the six weeks she had prescribed for her
  visit. She had no reason to urge her return. She tried to force herself to
  take a deeper interest than she felt in what was passing around her, and she
  was possessed by a certain lassitude caused by disappointment and
  disillusion.</p>

  <p>She intended to write a series of letters on the character of the French
  nation, but got no further than the Introduction, which she sent to Mr.
  Johnson in the February of 1793. Unfortunately, these notes do not seem to be
  those of a first-hand observer; they consist of generalisations, and Mary
  entirely omits to give any first hand details of what she actually saw,
  contenting herself with this kind of writing:</p>

  <p>"It is not then useless or presumptuous to note that when I first entered
  Paris the sight and contrast of riches and poverty, elegance and
  slovenliness, vanity and deceit everywhere caught my eye and saddened my
  soul. The whole mode of life here tends indeed to render the people
  frivolous, and, to borrow their favourite epithet, amiable. Ever on the wing,
  they are always sipping with sparkling joy at the brim of the cup, leaving
  the dregs in the bottom for those who venture to drink deep..."</p>

  <p>When Mary came to her darling subject of Liberty, she wrote with
  pessimism:</p>

  <p>"I wish I could first inform you that, out of the chaos of vices and
  follies, prejudices and virtues rudely jumbled together, I saw the fair form
  of Liberty slowly rising and Virtue expanding her wings to shelter all her
  children. I should then bear the accounts of the barbarities that have rent
  the bosom of France patiently and bless the firm hand that lopped off the
  rotten limb. But if the aristocracy of birth be cast to the ground only to
  make room for that of riches, I am afraid the morals of the people will not
  be much improved by the change or the government rendered less venal. I am
  grieved, sorely grieved when I think of the blood that stained the cause of
  freedom at Paris...I also hear the same live stream cry aloud from the
  highways through which the retreating armies pass with famine and death in
  their rear...The perspective of the golden age, fading before the attentive
  eye of observation, almost eludes my sight, and losing thus in part my theory
  of a more perfect state, start not, my friend, if I bring forward an opinion
  which at the first glance seems to be levelled against the existence of God!
  I am not become an atheist, I assure you, by residing at Paris; yet I begin
  to fear that vice, or if you will, evil, is the grand mobile of action and
  that when the passions are justly poised we become harmless, in the same
  proportion useless."</p>

  <p>Mary had travelled far from that period when she was able to console
  herself with an Evangelical piety and to endure the miseries of her existence
  for the reward she would one day receive in Heaven. She had no longer these
  vague and insipid comforts, of which reason had robbed her, and she had
  little to take their place. Her gloom increased with her conviction that no
  golden age was round the corner, and that chance and passion alone decide the
  lot of humanity. The National Assembly had rejected a demand for female
  suffrage, despite the support of Condorcet and other notables, and it could
  scarcely have been clear to Mary that the revolution was helping to establish
  "rights of women."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The superficial gaiety of the Parisians could not long blind Mary to the
  seething forces of disruption at work in France, nor could her instant liking
  for the members of the Gironde whom she met conceal from her the weakness
  both of their positions and of their characters. She continued to live
  secluded in the <i>hotel de Filiettaz</i>, to which the family did not
  return, and to visit the salons of the English and American families, still
  remaining hopefully in Paris. Foremost among these was the lady whom Mary had
  told her sister she "rather liked," the celebrated poetess and typical
  English enthusiast for the French Revolution, Helen Maria Williams, a woman
  younger than herself, who had been equally successful in the literary
  world&mdash;and without giving offence or causing scandal. Amiable, generous,
  Miss Williams had early been absorbed in a passion for the brilliant
  abstractions then turning the heads of most sensitive people. She had
  written, in prose and verse, on the all popular subject of Liberty, and two
  years before Mary arrived in Paris Helen Maria had established herself there
  in order to be present at that entrancing spectacle, "the dawn of
  freedom."</p>

  <p>She and her sister became naturalised Frenchwomen. Helen Maria was a
  friend of Mirabeau, a constant and eager spectator at the sittings of the
  Constituent Assembly and entertained in her handsome salon in the <i>rue
  Helevtius</i> Madame Roland, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, and the principal
  Brissotins or members of the Gironde. In 1790 she wrote one of the earliest
  accounts of the French Revolution. When Mary attended her parties the poetess
  was as enthusiastically Republican as ever, and "hoped to take part more
  closely in the triumphs of liberty."</p>

  <p>Mary thus soon realised her ambition of meeting the men whose politics she
  so admired and of seeing for herself, and in close detail, the workings of a
  revolution.</p>

  <p>Her life continued gloomy and lonely in the large deserted
  mansion&mdash;for still the Filiettaz family did not return to
  Paris&mdash;and she experienced what was so common with her&mdash;a sense of
  disillusion. Not all the ardent chatter over the teacups in Miss Williams's
  Sunday evening reunions could blind Mary's common sense to what she saw about
  her&mdash;the dirty, neglected streets, the <i>cafs</i> crowded with
  adventurers and loose women, the frivolous crowd attired in fantastic
  fashions who thronged the public walks and the theatres, the hideous stories
  beginning to be spread about of the attack on the Tuileries and the September
  massacres, the libels and lies of the hack journalists&mdash;none of this
  looked like the Millennium.</p>

  <p>Besides, Mary was despondent about her own affairs. She found that her
  successful authorship was not sufficient to satisfy her nature. Her scarcely
  stifled passion for Henry Fuseli had taught her what she lacked. But where to
  find it?</p>

  <p>She felt, too, uprooted. Her life seemed purposeless and disordered.
  Independence and the power to support herself did not attract her as they
  once had done. Was she forever to remain a Grub Street writer?</p>

  <p>Already the fame brought her by <i>The Rights of Woman</i> seemed to be
  vanishing. She had had three years of forced labour, and felt the lassitude
  that routine toil brings. She was also conscious of the indignation the
  expression of her opinions had aroused in the public mind and among her own
  family. This deepened her always latent hostility to society. She was now cut
  off by her bold defiance of convention from most of her fellows, as she had
  formerly been cut off by her poverty.</p>

  <p>In the untidy noisy city, full of tumult and menace, the lonely
  Englishwoman observed and brooded and got together her notes for a history of
  the French Revolution. She had written home regularly, but received no
  replies. The post between England and France became daily more unreliable,
  and by the spring of 1793 Mary found herself cut off both from the censure
  and from the appeals of her sisters.</p>

  <p>For the first time, and with considerable relief, she found herself freed
  from her family. Charles had at last emigrated to America, Mr. Wollstonecraft
  was dying of delirium tremens at Laugharne, and since it was impossible for
  Mary to send him money it was useless for her to think of him. Eliza seemed
  permanently, if uncomfortably, established at Upton Castle, and Everina
  continued to find situations. George Blood was in good employment in Ireland,
  where his parents had finally settled.</p>

  <p>Mary could, therefore, shake from her mind all these domestic miseries
  that had oppressed her so long and think only of her own affairs. The change
  of scene helped her to clarify her ideas; she became less fanatic, less
  violent in her opinions, and discarded many of the affectations that she had
  half-unconsciously adopted in her role of rebel and philosopher. Save to a
  few of her fellow countrypeople, she was unknown in Paris, a mere nobody
  ignored by the vast majority. This steadied a head that had become a little
  giddy and taught her to despise both her fame and her notoriety; it also
  showed her that she was appallingly lonely and desperately needed affection,
  protection and a place in society; her natural tastes asserted themselves;
  they were very womanly&mdash;she wanted a sweet domesticity, husband and
  children.</p>

  <p>She began to be shaken by the spreading anarchy about her, alarmed at the
  silence from home, at rumours of a world war. She was shocked by the brutal
  murder of the King, the menace to the Queen and the Princess Elizabeth, by
  the increasing dismay and terror that she found among her acquaintances, the
  apostles of Liberty.</p>

  <p>The political confusion into which the French nation was plunged after the
  execution of the King spread to every sphere of life. It was impossible to
  send letters home or to receive remittances from there; the Allies were
  advancing across the frontier; Paris seemed open to the invader. Mary found
  herself reduced to very straitened means and without any prospect of
  receiving supplies from London or even of leaving the country. Almost
  imperceptibly she found herself involved in the Parisian Reign of Terror
  which began with the fall of Toulon, and, as an Englishwoman, the object of
  suspicion and hatred. William Pitt, the British Prime Minister, was to the
  French at that moment the villain of the piece, and all his countrywomen
  shared something of the detestation that was evoked in the breasts of the
  French patriots.</p>

  <p>When the Gironde, for long powerless, fell, May, 1793, even such
  enthusiastic Republicans as Helen Maria Williams were not safe. France and
  Britain being at war, the arrest of all British subjects was ordered. Mary
  applied in vain for a passport to Switzerland, and then, both to hoard her
  remaining stock of money and to be out of the alarms of the city, she left
  the large deserted mansion of Madame Filiettaz and found lodgings in a small
  cottage at Neuilly soon after Miss Williams and other foreign Republicans had
  been lodged in the Luxembourg. This cottage was inhabited by an old gardener
  and situated on the edge of the woods. The noble family that had once lived
  there had fled, their vast mansion was shut up, empty, and there remained
  only the old servant, unnoticed on the neglected estate. He was glad of the
  few sous that Mary could give him and gave her, in return, faithful
  service.</p>

  <p>Mary lived at Neuilly in solitude, and as cheaply as possible. The old
  gardener was her sole attendant. Occasionally she went to Paris to visit the
  salons of Miss Williams or Mrs. Christie, and even more rarely some friend
  came to visit her. It was an odd existence, and for one of her temperament
  not without a melancholy charm.</p>

  <p>The old man, who was without a family, became devoted to his lodger. He
  waited on her, even making her bed himself, and procured the humble fare that
  was becoming so difficult to obtain in Paris or the environs. "<i>Du pain et
  du savon</i>," was the cry of the Paris mob, and Mary was fortunate in being
  supplied even with the coarsest of bread and the most meagre supply of
  soap.</p>

  <p>She had a pleasant room looking on to the peace of ancient woods, a desk,
  pen and ink, paper and a few books. She wrote, for several hours a day,
  carefully composing her well-informed and sober history of the revolution
  that was taking place about her, and letters home that were never answered.
  When she had eaten her crust and cheese, drunk her wine or coffee, she would
  walk under the heavy leafage of the Neuilly avenues, despite the old
  gardener's protest at her rashness, for the forest, he declared, was full of
  evil men, the scum of those disordered times; but Mary was unmolested save by
  her own disquietude.</p>

  <p>An unloved, unmated woman of well past thirty, however proud, successful
  or comely, is likely to feel wasted and neglected, and to discover that
  reason is a dull companion and theories are no better than dust when offered
  to an empty heart.</p>

  <p>Her personal bitterness was increased by the horror she felt at the
  failure of the French idealists, the pitiful fall of the Gironde, the danger
  of men whom she had known and admired; the triumph of ignorance and brutality
  shook her nerves. She could not go to Paris without seeing or hearing of some
  act of violence. She was sickened by the knowledge that the guillotine was
  set up in the Place de la Concorde, that the prisons were full of innocent
  people, that there were daily beheadings. The excesses of the Reign of Terror
  were, from the first, strongly dramatised. It is now doubted whether more
  people perished from the violence of the French Republicans than from the
  severity of the English law during the same period. While English people were
  working themselves into a frenzy over the bloodshed in Paris, their own
  countrymen were being "hanged in strings" for forging counterfeits of the new
  Bank of England notes and for offences such as picking pockets. The French
  victims were, no doubt, not criminals, but most of them were considered
  dangerous to a newly formed and desperately beset state; but, when all
  allowances were made, the period was full of alarm.</p>

  <p>As France rapidly fell into anarchy, Mary and her friends did their best
  to procure for her a passport for England or Switzerland, but without
  success. Gradually the foreign colony in Paris diminished, the idealists went
  home or into hiding, and the paeans of joy raised at the era of liberty
  changed into wild laments against the rule of "monsters."</p>

  <p>One of the last English families to remain in Paris was the Christies.
  Captain Christie had business with the Convention and was intimate with that
  circle of Americans so well received by the French as allies and fellow
  republicans. To these friendly people Mary would go when her solitude at
  Neuilly became unsupportable, and there she met Captain Gilbert Imlay, who
  attracted her so powerfully that at first she thought that she disliked
  him.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>She was warmly predisposed in his favour by the fact that he was one of
  those heroes whose exploits she had applauded while she was in servitude in
  Bath&mdash;a soldier who had fought against the English in the War of
  Independence.</p>

  <p>He was of good family, well educated, about Mary's own age, and extremely
  attractive in his person. A successful career in the army had given him
  self-confidence and an air of authority. When the war was over he had
  obtained a commission for laying out the virgin lands of America. As a
  result, he had written a book, declared by all to be "a model of its kind,"
  entitled <i>A Topographical Description of the Western Territory of North
  America</i>, that had been published in London and gone through many
  editions.</p>

  <p>Gilbert Imlay was in Paris on business. He had for some time been engaged
  in speculations in timber and was now absorbed in schemes to buy wood in
  Norway and Sweden and sell it to the Convention for the purpose of
  shipbuilding. His opinions were republican, and he was a lively supporter of
  the experiments made by the Gironde in the name of Liberty. His views on all
  subjects were intelligent, restrained, yet tinged with a pleasing enthusiasm.
  His person was bold, manly and graceful, his manner bold yet courteous, he
  dressed with some attention to elegance, and lived comfortably in hired
  apartments.</p>

  <p>His attention was first attracted to Mary by hearing from the Christies of
  her forlorn situation alone in Paris, cut off from her friends, and he
  offered help. They became friendly through discussion of her difficulties,
  and, busy as he was, Captain Imlay found time to ride out to Neuilly and
  share Mary's crust and dish of tea. He had read her famous
  book&mdash;doubtless with a half-smile&mdash;and admired her as a bold,
  intelligent woman, whose views on many subjects coincided with his own.
  Captain Imlay suavely agreed that society needed reforming, the relationship
  of the sexes adjusting and manners purging of hypocrisy and affectation.</p>

  <p>He was averse to matrimony and knew by heart the glib arguments about
  love's being the only bond, and the mockery of the tie of mere ceremonies
  when love was absent. Mary was caught; she, too, had held the same tenets.
  They exchanged fluent philosophies, and the woman was soon headlong in
  love.</p>

  <p>Imlay, flattered and touched by her joy in his company, told her of his
  youth, wild, dissipated, but not ungenerous, he hoped, and admitted his
  present loose way of life. He had casual mistresses and was not delicate in
  his choice of sensual pleasures. Mary had had a great deal to say on these
  matters, and had said it rather shrewishly. The lack of male chastity, she
  declared, was the cause of most of the troubles between the sexes, and a pair
  of virgin lovers, united by the bonds of reason and virtue, had always been
  her ideal.</p>

  <p>Passion she had always despised, and love she had viewed with no more than
  tolerance. Men and women, she thought, should soon be done with these
  transient, common emotions and settle down to a life founded on respect and
  affection..."In order to fulfil the duties of life, a master and a mistress
  of a family ought to continue to love each other without passion."
  "Friendship or indifference inevitably succeeds to love," while only the
  foolish prefer "the sensual emotions of fondness" to the "confidence of
  respect."</p>

  <p>All this philosophy did not help Mary when in her comely maturity and
  lonely state of spinsterhood she met a man who fascinated her senses and
  roused her tenderness.</p>

  <p>With unconscious feminine duplicity she threw an air of grandeur over her
  need of physical love and of the caresses of this fascinating man. She would
  reform him, elevate him, rescue him from his sensual indulgences: in other
  words, she would snatch him from all other women and keep him for
  herself.</p>

  <p>In scorning his dissipation she blinded herself to the fact that his
  faults were precisely what fascinated her. She did not love Imlay for his
  principles, for his intelligence or for his virtues, but for his personal
  attractions, the charm of his gay virility, the intoxicating pleasure of his
  attentions. The clever, independent woman, who had been so earnest in her
  denunciation of follies and frailties, was caught by just those qualities in
  the young soldier that satisfied the <i>fille publique</i> of the Palais
  Royal who had amused him for a few hours.</p>

  <p>Eliza had truly, if meanly, predicted, that Mary in France would be "but a
  woman." But she would put a gloss over her feelings and, while indulging long
  frustrated nature, vex and confuse herself with moral axioms.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>During that summer of the Terror in Paris the odd love affair fluctuated.
  Gilbert Imlay was not easily snared. Mary was starved of love, and he,
  satiated with it. While she had been sermonising about life he had been
  experiencing it. He was attractive and had money. The licence in Paris was
  extreme. The vicious drove a brisk trade in what the virtuous offered for
  nothing under the excuse that love&mdash;like everything else&mdash;was
  "free." Imlay had never found any difficulty with women, and there was none
  with Mary. The conquest of the author of <i>A Vindication of the Rights of
  Woman</i> was almost too easy.</p>

  <p>But the woman's outburst of fresh, sincere passion touched, amused, then
  roused the jaded man. He was, too, a little flattered at her preference, for
  she was famous and supposed to be difficult, and was also attracted by her
  person that she now adorned with every device possible to her means.</p>

  <p>For him&mdash;her late come lover&mdash;Mary bloomed like an autumn rose,
  and gained that lustre and sparkle that she had hitherto lacked. The plain
  dress affected by the Republicans suited her long-limbed graceful figure, the
  rich hair showed handsome under the cheap straw hat, and the classic features
  and brilliant brown eyes became beautiful when animated with joy. When she
  forgot her roles of teacher and of critic she was charming with her pretty
  childish delight in little things, her eagerness to please, her quick
  interest in all subjects; the true woman, revealed at last, truly shone.</p>

  <p>She gave herself entirely to her love. Her history, the result of much
  labour, was left untouched on her desk; she wrote no more. When Imlay did not
  visit her she went on solitary but no longer sad walks in the woods or made
  excursions to other suburbs of Paris, that she might, alone with her delight,
  dream of the future. Her senses and her imagination became exquisitely
  quickened, and she was profoundly impressed by the decaying grandeur of the
  huge <i>chteau</i> of Versailles, then abandoned, the vast corridors where
  the damp was ruining the grandiose stucco ornaments, the succession of
  mirrors in which she saw her own lonely figure reflected, the great empty
  staircases and the gigantic figures sprawling in the frescoes that seemed to
  turn and snatch at her as she passed.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft wandered in the deserted gardens that had so recently
  formed the background for Marie Antoinette's gorgeous merrymaking, paused by
  the melancholy temples and the trickling cascades and contrasted the sadness
  of these relics of fallen grandeur with her own brilliant hopes. She and
  Imlay became lovers without pact or bargain. He expected a complete surrender
  as a result of his attentions to any woman, and Mary was past making terms.
  Modesty, she had always declared, "was the most charming of the virtues," and
  as attractive as necessary in a woman, but all reserves vanished before
  passion.</p>

  <p>When Imlay could not come to Neuilly she used to meet him outside the
  great <i>Barrire</i> or Gate of Paris, erected by Charles-Alexandre Calonne,
  the Controller-General to Louis XVI, outside the Tuileries, as part of his
  scheme for an <i>octroi</i>. They would dine together at one of the pleasant
  <i>htels</i> that lined the elegant boulevards and afterwards meet as lovers
  in the private room that Imlay hired. Mary indulged in that sophistry so
  often employed by women in her situation&mdash;her lover was her "husband" in
  the eyes of God, and she, therefore, chaste. Merely because she loved him and
  intended to be faithful to him, she was, she argued, "doing no wrong, because
  she was doing right in her own eyes." She persuaded herself that her
  connection with Imlay was not only honourable, but sublime.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>In the first month of her love affair Mary Wollstonecraft was happy, with
  a happiness that she had not hitherto dreamed possible. She lost her
  affectation and her interest in everything, save her own circumstances. Even
  the tumults and miseries and excitements of Paris during the autumn of 1793
  became but a mere background to her love affair. She lavished on Gilbert
  Imlay an ardour and a tenderness that involved him further than he had meant
  to go. He found his mind as well as his senses seduced by this lovely
  intelligent woman who so exalted him in his own eyes by her admiration and
  her deference. Mary cast from her all the dreary memories of the dismal past;
  her brothers, her sisters, her father, George Blood&mdash;none of these
  people existed for her. She had, through her connections with Imlay, begun,
  in every sense of the word, a new life. Now that she was satisfied in
  herself, she no longer criticised those about her with such acrid bitterness.
  She was no longer a spectator of society, but had become part of the social
  fabric, a loved woman&mdash;no longer lonely, neglected, or frustrated.
  Everything to her looked beautiful, even in the dusty and disordered city.
  Her expeditions to the little <i>htel</i> beyond the grandiose arch of the
  barrier were full of the most exquisite delights. She noted with sensations
  of acute pleasure the long boulevards with the handsome trees, the best of
  flowers, the people, gay and frivolous despite their privations, their
  uncertainties of the future. She was unspied upon, unreproved; she had that
  delicious liberty so necessary to the successful conduct of a love affair.
  Yet there were some of the poignant joys of stolen fruit in those half-secret
  meetings, in those caresses and smiles that Imlay gave her when they were
  concealed from the outer world. Weeks passed and she continued to live in her
  cottage at Neuilly and to hold Gilbert Imlay's passion and affection by her
  charms, her intelligence, her sincere love and the hundred unrehearsed arts
  that passion taught her inexperience.</p>

  <p>When the first grapes ripened in the garden of her cottage the old man
  made a gift of them to his fair visitor, and with the purple fruit piled in a
  little basket on her arm she would go out along the dusty road to watch for
  the handsome horseman who was then not only all the world to her, but more
  than she had ever thought all the world might be worth in those cool days
  when she had declared sex to be unimportant.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary's position became towards the end of the year extremely difficult.
  She was almost at the end of her little hoard of money, and had been
  scrupulous about accepting any money from her lover, or even mentioning her
  distress to him. She was utterly cut off from England, and it was more than a
  year since she had heard from any of her friends. How long ago now seemed
  those days when she had frequented the literary circle of London and listened
  to the brilliant talk of Henry Fuseli, the arguments of Priestley, Aiken and
  Wakefield, or attended the gatherings in Mrs. Trimmer's drawing-room!</p>

  <p>How little Mary cared for any of them, or for any of the abstractions to
  which she had given so much time. But her material circumstances demanded
  some attention; she had to snatch herself and her passion from a world in
  ruins.</p>

  <p>The gazettes told her of the <i>leve en masse</i> in August, the setting
  up of the Committee of Public Safety in September, the trial and execution of
  the Queen in October, the Feast of Reason and the rising in La Vende, but
  none of these things were real to her; she existed for her lover's caresses,
  for their delicious meetings and exquisite companionship. More important to
  her than the politics of Pitt or the victories of Hood were the details of
  the little room in the <i>htel</i> beyond the majestic <i>Barrire</i>, the
  table set with two glasses, two services, a bowl of roses, a dish of
  fruit&mdash;his dark face behind the candlelight, his laughter as he held her
  in his arms. Yet she was aware that this enchantment might be rudely
  broken&mdash;perhaps by the knife of the guillotine.</p>

  <p>For the moment Mary was unnoticed, but many of her friends, including
  Helen Maria Williams, were still in prison, where, in the boarded-up rooms of
  a Luxembourg palace hastily changed into jails, they might meditate at
  leisure on their enthusiasm for Liberty. Nor was her well-known Republicanism
  likely to save Mary Wollstonecraft; the followers of Marat and Robespierre
  had no tenderness for the friends of the Gironde.</p>

  <p>Mary's first known letter to Gilbert Imlay addresses him as "My dear
  love," and says: "I shall leave the key in the door and hope to find you at
  my fireside on my return about eight o'clock."</p>

  <p>Soon after she wrote this he had agreed to help her out of her
  difficulties, and perhaps save her from her perils by allowing her to pass as
  his wife. It would have been difficult for Mary to be married in Paris
  without disclosing her nationality; that might have caused her to be cast
  into prison. It is, however, difficult to believe that Imlay, an American,
  could not have contrived this ceremony without danger to an intended wife.
  Both he and Mary had some friends and some influence in Paris, and the French
  Government was disposed to make everything easy for an American. Under the
  excuse that it would be difficult for them to get married, but really because
  Gilbert Imlay did not care about matrimony and Mary dare not press the
  question, they decided that she should have the protection of his name and
  the comfort of living openly with him. This at least gave their love the
  dignity of a public avowal, and Mary accepted the proposal with eager
  gratitude. It was some time taking shape. In August she had written:</p>

  <p>"You can scarcely imagine with what pleasure I anticipate the day when we
  are to begin almost to live together. You would smile to hear how many plans
  and employments I have in my head now that I am confident my heart has found
  peace in your bosom. Cherish me with that dignified tenderness which I have
  only found in you. Your own dear girl will try to keep under the quickness of
  feeling that sometimes gives you pain. Yes, I will be good, that I may
  deserve to be happy, and whilst you love me I cannot again fall into the
  miserable state which has rendered my burden almost too heavy to be borne. I
  shall be at the barrier a little after ten o'clock to-morrow."</p>

  <p>By the autumn they were living together in Gilbert Imlay's apartment. She
  was using his name, and he had procured a statement from the American Consul
  that she was his wife. This gave her, in the eyes of the French authorities,
  the right to American citizenship, and she was unmolested while every other
  British subject was either lodged in prison or forced to fly the country.
  Such of Mary's friends as remained in Paris accepted her as Imlay's wife
  without inquiring too closely into the matter. News of the supposed marriage
  reached her brother Charles in Philadelphia, who wrote home to his sisters
  that he had heard Mary was married "to a Captain Gilbert Imlay of this
  country."</p>

  <p class="quote">And as the seed waits eagerly watching for its flower and
  fruit,<br>
  Anxious its little soul looks out into the clear expanse<br>
  To see if hungry winds are abroad with their invisible array.<br>
  <br>
  <i>The Four Zoas</i>.<br>
  William Blake, 1797.</p><br>

  <p class="first">DURING the first rapture of their life together, for rapture
  it was to her, Mary persuaded her lover to acquiesce in plans that were
  contrary to his nature and his intentions. They would, she decided, abandon a
  society that she was no longer interested in reforming, and a Europe whose
  affairs no longer concerned her, and live together on a farm in America,
  where, like some couple imagined by Rousseau, he would till the fields and
  she would keep the hearth, and their days would pass in perfect companionship
  and unblemished love.</p>

  <p>Imlay agreed to these schemes, but declared it would be impossible to
  leave France at the moment, and that he must have at least a thousand pounds
  with which to retire from business.</p>

  <p>His affairs continued to occupy him; he was much away from his home, in
  which he did not find that satisfaction which Mary discovered. He was
  naturally gay and indifferent to those deep emotions that his partner so
  valued. He often reproved her for her fits of melancholy, for she had them
  even now, and for the quickness with which she resented what she considered
  neglect on his part.</p>

  <p>After they had been living together for a few months, business called
  Imlay to Havre, then called Havre-Marat. During his absence Mary, who was
  left in his lodgings in Paris, sent him numerous letters, of which thirteen
  survived the writer. Even in the first, written while Imlay was yet on the
  road, there was a tinge of reproach, a shadow of fear. Mary, left alone in
  the distracted city, could not feel at ease:</p>

  <p>"...How are you? I have been following you all along the road in this
  comfortless weather, for, when I am absent from those I love, my imagination
  is as lively as if my senses had never been gratified by their
  presence&mdash;I was going to say caresses&mdash;and why should I not? I have
  found out that I have more mind than you in one respect; because I can,
  without any violent effort of reason, find food for love in the same objects
  much longer than you can. The way to my senses is through my heart, but
  forgive me! if I think there is sometimes a shorter cut to yours...these
  continual separations seem necessary to warm your affection; of late we are
  always separated. Crack!&mdash;crack&mdash;! and away you go...Pardon...the
  vagaries of a mind that has been almost 'crazed by care' as well as 'crossed
  in hapless love,' and bear with me a little longer. When we are settled in
  the country together more duties will open before me, and my heart, which,
  now trembling into peace, is agitated by every emotion that awakens the
  remembrance of old grief, will learn to rest on yours, with that dignity your
  character, not to talk of my own, demands."</p>

  <p>By November Mary was expecting a child, and this knowledge increased both
  her joy and her apprehension. Her mind, she wrote to Imlay, was sincere as
  her heart was affectionate, and the knowledge of her condition had produced
  an overflowing tenderness for her lover. Yet she was anxious and felt his
  absence. She began to realise with some uneasiness, despite her trust in him,
  that she had hazarded on this affair much more than she need have, and the
  remembrance of her past rapturous joys made her loneliness the harder to
  bear:</p>

  <p>"Write to me, my best love, and bid me be patient kindly. The expressions
  of kindness will again beguile the time, as quickly as they have done
  to-night. Tell me also, over and over again, that your happiness, and you
  deserve to be happy, is closely connected with mine, and I will try to
  dissipate as they rise the fumes of former discontent. God bless you. Take
  care of yourself. Remember with tenderness Mary. I am going to rest very
  happy, and you have made me so. This is the kindest good-night I can
  offer."</p>

  <p>The winter of 1794 was hard in Paris; the bare necessaries of life were
  difficult to get. Mary did not find it easy to come by fuel and food, soap
  and candles. None of her own friends were left in the capital, and she was
  not familiar with her husband's business associates, who sometimes visited
  his apartment. Her books were her sole company, and her entire occupation,
  apart from a little scribbling, was thinking of her lover. She considered
  herself his wife in every sense of the word, yet she was not sure of him,
  though she tried to disguise her doubts from herself. She wrote:</p>

  <p>"I think that you must love me, for, in the sincerity of my heart I
  believe I deserve your tenderness because I am true, I have a degree of
  sensibility that you can see and relish."</p>

  <p>Imlay had said that his visit to Havre would take him but a few days;
  however, at the end of the year he had not returned, and Mary was growing
  impatient.</p>

  <p>"You seem to have taken up your abode at Havre. Pray, sir, when do you
  think of coming home, or to write very considerately, when will business
  permit you? I shall expect, as the country people say in England, that you
  will make a power of money to indemnify me for your absence. Well, back, my
  love, to the old story&mdash;am I to see you this week or this month? I do
  not know what you are about."</p>

  <p>She disguised her reproaches with a playful air, saying that a sigh
  escaped her every time she saw Imlay's worn slippers outside his door, from
  which post she would not, however, remove them, though they were not "the
  handsomest of their kind," and she finished with:</p>

  <p>"Be not anxious to get money, for nothing worth having is to be
  purchased."</p>

  <p>On December 30th she wrote again, informing him that she had at last heard
  from her family. One letter, from Eliza, was as usual a melancholy affair,
  which had harassed Mary with its stirring up of old miseries, but Charles
  from America had written in an independent and manly strain of good luck at
  last, and Mary wrote gallantly to her lover:</p>

  <p>"You shall see it (the letter) when we are once more over the fire
  together&mdash;I think that you would hail him as a brother, with one of your
  tender looks, when your heart not only gives a lustre to your eyes but a
  dance of playfulness, that he would meet with a glow half made up of
  bashfulness, a desire to please. Where shall I find a word to express the
  relationship which subsists between us?"</p>

  <p>Mary could not indeed give herself a name: "wife" seemed to smack of
  hypocrisy, "mistress" of degradation. She wondered, with a sad playfulness,
  what the unborn child would name her, and said:</p>

  <p>"I have dropt half the sentence that was to tell you how much my brother
  would be inclined to love the man loved by his sister. I have been fancying
  myself sitting between you ever since I began to write, and my heart has
  leaped at the thought! You see how I chat to you...There was so much
  considerate tenderness in your epistle to-night that, if it has not made you
  dearer to me, it has made me forcibly see how very dear you are to me by
  charming away half my cares."</p>

  <p>The New Year did not bring Imlay back to Paris. Mary beguiled herself with
  hope. She kept a parcel of books that had been sent her until she and her
  lover might read them together&mdash;"whilst I mend my stockings." She
  counted on the future, she struggled to be calm, but when three days went by
  and she received no letter, she wrote and admitted for the first time that
  she was hurt and disappointed:</p>

  <p>"...Why should I, by concealing it, affect a heroism I do not feel? I hate
  commerce...You will tell me that exertions are necessary. I am weary of them!
  The face of things, public and private, vexes me. The 'peace' and clemency
  which seemed to be drawing near a few days ago, disappear again...Life is but
  a labour of patience: it is always rolling a great stone up a hill; before
  the person can find a resting place, imagining it is lodged, down it comes
  again and all the work has to be done anew. Should I attempt to write any
  more, I could not change the strain. My head aches and my heart is heavy...If
  you do not return soon...I will throw your slippers out of the window and be
  off&mdash;nobody knows where."</p>

  <p>She began to think much of the unborn child. She had made no attempt to
  conceal her condition from two female acquaintances, and told her lover as
  much, adding: "And let them stare, and all the world may know it, for all I
  care." But she added that she wished to avoid "coarse jokes." She became more
  and more low spirited. She was hurt by her lover's "cheerful temper, which
  makes absence easy to you...And why should I mince the matter? I was offended
  at your not even mentioning it (their separation). I do not want to be loved
  like a goddess, but I wish to be necessary to you."</p>

  <p>But if one kind letter came from her lover, she was overflowing with
  gratitude:</p>

  <p>"I have just received your kind and rational letter and would fain hide my
  face glowing with shame from my folly&mdash;I would hide it in your bosom if
  you would again open it to me and nestle closely till you bade my fluttering
  heart be still by saying that you forgave me. With eyes overflowing with
  tears and in the humblest attitude I entreat you, do not turn from me, for
  indeed I love you fondly and have been very wretched since the night I was so
  cruelly hurt by thinking you had no confidence in me&mdash;Ah, do not
  continue to be angry with me&mdash;You can see that I am already smiling
  through my tears. You have lightened my heart and my frozen spirits are
  melting with playfulness. Write the moment you receive this. I shall count
  the minutes. But drop not an angry word&mdash;I cannot now bear it..."</p>

  <p>Mary's health began to suffer. Sickness of mind produced sickness of body.
  She passed her days not only in privation, for Imlay kept her short of money
  and she had no means of earning any for herself, but in great agitation. Her
  natural melancholy returned with redoubled force. This was the reaction from
  her unlooked for and, as it now seemed, incredible happiness. She was
  afflicted with constant sickness, headaches and trembling fits of
  weakness.</p>

  <p>Imlay answered her complaints sternly, chiding her uneasiness, her lack of
  faith and her depression. This severity so alarmed the faithful woman that
  she could not bring herself to open the letters from Havre when they did
  arrive lest they should contain some reproof:</p>

  <p>"Yesterday, my love, I could not open your letter for some time, and
  though it was not half as severe as I merited, it threw me into such a fit of
  trembling as seriously alarmed me...This morning I am better. Will you not be
  glad to hear it?...Let me, in the sincerity of my heart, assure you there is
  nothing I would not suffer to make you happy. My own happiness depends wholly
  on you, and knowing you&mdash;and my reason is not clouded&mdash;I look
  forward to a rational prospect of as much felicity as the earth affords, with
  a little dash of rapture into the bargain if you will look at me when we meet
  again as you have sometimes greeted your humble yet most affectionate
  Mary."</p>

  <p>The following day she wrote again:</p>

  <p>"I have been wishing the time away, my kind love, unable to rest until I
  knew that my penitential letter had reached your hand, and this afternoon
  when your tender epistle of Tuesday gave such exquisite pleasure to your poor
  sick girl her heart smote her to think you were still to receive another cold
  one&mdash;Burn it also, my dearest, yet do not forget that even those letters
  were full of love, and I shall ever recollect that you did not wait to be
  mollified by my penitence before you took me again to your heart. I have been
  unwell, and would not, now I am recovering, take the journey because I have
  been seriously alarmed and angry with myself, fearing continually the fatal
  consequences of my folly. But should you think it right to remain at Havre I
  should make some opportunity to come to you in the course of a fortnight, or
  less perhaps, and before then I shall be strong again."</p>

  <p>The letters from her lover became affectionate; he even suggested that she
  should join him at Havre, a proposal that Mary thought he might have made
  three months before. She would, she declared, trust him:</p>

  <p>"To hasten to your love when you've obtained (or lost sight of) the object
  of your journey."</p>

  <p>Imlay's tenderness had encouraged her to indulge in some entrancing
  prospects for the future:</p>

  <p>"What a picture have you sketched of our fireside! Yes, my love, my fancy
  was instantly at work and I found my head on your shoulder while my eyes were
  fixed on the little creatures that were clinging about your knees. I did not
  absolutely determine that there should be six, but if you have not set your
  heart on this round number..."</p>

  <p>She wrote warmly of the coming child, adding:</p>

  <p>"I am afraid to read over this prattle, but it is only for your eye."</p>

  <p>She urged Imlay not to become absorbed in his business speculations, nor
  avid for wealth:</p>

  <p>"If you can make your plans answer, it is well. I do not think a little
  money an inconvenience, but should they fail we will struggle cheerfully
  together, drawn closer by the pinching blasts of poverty."</p>

  <p>Mary had no hope of happiness or interest save in her relations with
  Gilbert Imlay and her prospect of a domestic life with him on an American
  farm. She had given up all expectation of fame or fortune for herself, and
  the progress of the French Revolution disillusioned her as profoundly as it
  had her fellow enthusiasts. When, for the sake of her unborn child, she
  forced herself to go abroad amid "the cold and dirt" of Paris and to subdue
  her "querulous humours," she saw much to sadden, horrify and disgust her in
  Paris.</p>

  <p>In her nervous, forlorn state the terrible scenes that she could not avoid
  witnessing shook her to the soul. Once she unexpectedly came upon a group of
  people standing close to some pools of blood brilliant in the gleams of the
  setting sun. Some public beheadings had just taken place. Mary, now able to
  speak fluent French, turned on these uneasy idlers and indignantly asked them
  why they permitted these daily murders. A good-natured citizen took her by
  the arm and hurried her away before some fanatic or Jacobin government spy
  should hear her protest.</p>

  <p>In February Mary at last received her lover's permission to join him in
  Havre. She wrote to him on the eve of her departure:</p>

  <p>"You may smile me to sleep, for I have not caught much rest since we
  parted."</p>

  <p>After a joyous reunion of a fortnight, Imlay found that business called
  him to the capital, which Mary had just left. She was then in no condition to
  travel, so was forced to remain behind at the dreary port, bearing as best
  she could this second separation. She wrote to him immediately:</p>

  <p>"We are such creatures of habit, my love, that, though I cannot say I was
  sorry, childishly so, for your going, when I knew that you would stay for a
  short time and I had a plan of employment, yet I could not sleep&mdash;I
  turned to your side of the bed and tried to make the most of the comfort of
  the pillow which you used to tell me I was churlish about; but all would not
  do&mdash;I took, nevertheless, my walk before breakfast, though the weather
  was not inviting, and here I am wishing you a finer day, and seeing you peep
  over my shoulder as I write with one of your kindest looks."</p>

  <p>She was still deeply, painfully in love; nothing but Gilbert Imlay and his
  child was ever in her mind. She was willing to endure the worst that life
  could offer if she might be with him continually. All her gifts, her charms,
  her hopes, were flung at the feet of this errant lover, who sometimes laughed
  and stayed and sometimes scolded and went away, who was always incredibly
  precious to Mary Wollstonecraft.</p>

  <p>At the end of April Mary gave birth to a daughter, whom she named Fanny in
  memory of her romantic friendship with Frances Blood. Imlay returned to Havre
  to be with her, and treated her with every consideration. The happiness of
  this reunion, and a constitution naturally sound, saw her through her
  confinement, which was brief. She treated herself on stern principles, and
  had no assistance save that of a midwife. At the end of a few days she was
  about, well and happy, with her baby daughter in her arms.</p>

  <p>Imlay remained with her until August, when he again returned to Paris
  under the excuse of business. Mary's letters sent to him from Havre show that
  her affection&mdash;nay, her passion&mdash;was as strong as ever. She had set
  all her hopes of happiness on this man, and though she had as yet nothing to
  complain of in his conduct, she feared that he did not love her with that
  intensity with which she loved him. She told him with dangerous candour that
  his affection was necessary to her happiness:</p>

  <p>"Still, I do not think it false delicacy or foolish pride to wish that
  your attention to my happiness should rise as much from love, which is always
  rather a selfish passion, as reason. That is, I want you to promote my
  felicity by seeking your own."</p>

  <p>She tried to bind him to her by telling him how fond she was of&mdash;</p>

  <p>"our little girl, who has got into my heart and imagination...When I walk
  out without her, her little figure is ever dancing before me. Do not,
  however, suppose that I am melancholy, for when you are from me, I not only
  wonder how I can find fault with you, but how I can doubt your
  affection."</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft had truly one grave cause to doubt Gilbert Imlay's
  affection, and that was that there was still no mention on his part of a
  marriage between them. There was now no excuse for his not making her his
  wife in fact, as she was by pretence. He was free, she was free, both were of
  age, and there could have been no difficulty in their being married either in
  Havre or in Paris, or even in London. Conditions had improved, and it was
  possible, if not easy, to travel from one capital to the other.</p>

  <p>Mary had never declared herself averse to marriage. She intended to be
  faithful to this man all her life and to use her utmost endeavours to keep
  him faithful to her. She had had one child, and hoped to have others. She had
  her family and friends to face, and she knew that many even of the most
  broad-minded of these would consider her illicit union a disgrace. Therefore
  she had every reason to wish to be married to Gilbert Imlay. She must,
  indeed, always have been ready to be his wife; there could have been no
  obstacle in her mind nor any hesitation in her heart. Circumstances had
  hurried her into becoming Imlay's mistress. She had done what most women
  would have done under her circumstances&mdash;snatched such an unlooked for
  happiness when it was offered her. Now she had every reason to endeavour to
  consolidate that happiness by a legal union. That Imlay did not suggest it
  might have warned her of the disaster ahead. She was, however, prepared to
  accept second best, and to return with him to London using his name and
  living with him on the same terms as those she had accepted in Paris. She
  was, however, tormented by his growing indifference. He was neither harsh nor
  cold, but, when he saw her, kind and cheerful; yet he was quite content to be
  absent from her for long periods; he showed little interest in their child;
  he became more and more immersed in business, and, as she feared, some of
  those loose pleasures from which she thought that she had won him, and he
  spoke no more of the farm in America where he and she would sit looking into
  the fire with six children between them.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>After they had been a month together in Paris, Imlay went to London under
  the excuse of business. Mary was supposed to join him when he had
  straightened out his affairs and found a pleasant house for her. She watched
  him go with misgivings. She was completely in his power.</p>

  <p>Eliza, still at Upton Castle, about the time that Gilbert Imlay came to
  London, wrote to Everina on receipt of a letter from Charles in Philadelphia
  saying that Mary was married:</p>

  <p>"Can this be a dream, my heart's best friend? I would I could fancy these
  things matter-of-fact. I mean the poor fellow, Charles's wonderful good luck
  in so short a time. I own I want faith, nay, doubt my senses, as I have sent
  you word for word, to spell and put together...If Mary is <i>actually</i>
  married to Mr. Imlay, it might not be impossible but she might settle there
  (America) too. Yet Mary cannot be <i>married</i>! It is natural to conclude
  her protector is her <i>husband</i>. Nay, on reading Charles's letter, I for
  an instant believed it true. I would, my Everina, we were out of suspense,
  for all at present is uncertainty and the most cruel suspense; still, Johnson
  does not speak things at random, and that the very same tale should have
  crossed the Atlantic makes me almost believe that the once Mary is now Mrs.
  Imlay and a mother. Are we ever to see this mother and her babe?"</p>

  <p>Mary did not send any news of herself either to her relations or to her
  faithful friend Joseph Johnson, who had, however, as it appears from the
  above letter of Eliza Bishop, heard some rumours of her supposed marriage.
  She was indeed still entirely absorbed in her love, and was writing anxiously
  from Paris to Imlay in London, trying to interest him in the child:</p>

  <p>"Besides looking at me there are three other things which delight
  her&mdash;to ride in a coach, to look at a scarlet waistcoat, to hear loud
  music. There is nothing picturesque in your present pursuit; my imagination,
  then, rather chooses to ramble back to the barrier with you or to see you
  coming to meet me and my basket of grapes. With what pleasure do I recollect
  your looks and words when I have been sitting on the window regarding the
  waving corn! Bring me back, then, your barrier face, or you shall have
  nothing to say to my barrier girl, and I shall fly from you to cherish the
  remembrances that ever will be dear to me."</p>

  <p>Then a few days later:</p>

  <p>"I have been playing and laughing with the little girl so long that I
  cannot take up my pen to address you without emotion. Pressing her to my
  bosom she looks so like you&mdash;<i>entre nous</i> your best looks, for I do
  not admire your commercial face; every nerve seemed to vibrate to the touch
  and I began to think there was something in the assertion of man and wife
  being one, for you seemed to pervade my whole frame..."</p>

  <p>In another letter:</p>

  <p>"I hope you take care of your health...I have got a habit of restlessness
  at night, which arises I believe from anxiety of mind, for when I am alone,
  that is, not near one to whom I can open my heart, I sink into
  reveries..."</p>

  <p>Again:</p>

  <p>"I slept at St. Germain's in the very room that you have not forgot, in
  which you pressed me very tenderly to your heart&mdash;I did not forget to
  fold my darling to mine, with sensations that are almost too sacred to be
  alluded to. Adieu, my love!"</p>

  <p>On October 1st:</p>

  <p>"I have just now stumbled on one of the kind letters that you wrote during
  your last absence. You are, then, a dear, affectionate creature and I will
  not plague you...I feel that I love you, and if I cannot be happy with you I
  will see that no one else is. My little darling grows every day more dear to
  me and she often has a kiss when we are alone together, which I give her from
  you with all my heart."</p>

  <p>October passed, and Imlay did not return to Paris or send for Mary from
  London. She was exercising a desperate patience:</p>

  <p>"My heart longs for your return, my love, and only looks for and seeks
  happiness with you. Yet do not imagine that I childishly wish for you to come
  back before you have arranged things in such a manner that it will not be
  necessary for you to leave us again soon."</p>

  <p>Then, two days after Christmas Day:</p>

  <p>"I have been, my love, for some days together tormented by fears that I
  would not allow to assume a form. I have been expecting you daily and I heard
  that many vessels have been driven on shore during the late gale. I want to
  be sure that you are safe and not separated from me by a sea that must be
  passed. For, feeling that I am happier than I ever was, do you wonder at my
  sometimes dreading that fate has not done persecuting me? Come to me, my
  dearest friend, husband, father of my child! All these fond ties glow at my
  heart at this moment and dim my eyes..."</p>

  <p>Imlay wrote letters full of excuses. He could not make a home for Mary in
  London, nor would his business allow him to return to Paris. He had been
  disappointed in his speculations and had become checked in his affairs. All
  these evasions of her passionate desires fell bitterly on the heart of the
  woman in love. She wrote to him:</p>

  <p>"It seems absurd to waste life in preparing to live...Having suffered so
  much in life, do not wonder that I sometimes, when left to myself, grow
  gloomy and suppose that it is all a dream, that my happiness is not to
  last..."</p>

  <p>She wrote other letters in the same tone. The refrain was:</p>

  <p>"Tell me when I may expect to see you, and let me not be always vainly
  looking for you till I grow sick at heart. Adieu, I am a little hurt, I must
  take my darling to my bosom to comfort me."</p>

  <p>Then her native independence and boldness of spirit began to reassert
  themselves. She wrote to her lover that she would try to earn money for
  herself and her child, that he might not have the excuse that he was absorbed
  in making money for their sakes. She had begun to debate at last, after
  putting off the dreadful subject as long as possible, the question of his
  constancy. What was keeping him? Could this be the true love on which she had
  so counted?</p>

  <p>"...for, if a wandering of the heart, or even a caprice of the imagination
  detains you, there is an end of all my hopes of happiness&mdash;I could not
  forgive it if I would."</p>

  <p>Her melancholy, her distrust of the world had returned. She was sorry that
  her child was a girl, as she remembered that men were always tyrants. She
  regretted that she had a tie to a world that "for me is ever sown with
  thorns."</p>

  <p>She reminded her lover:</p>

  <p>"I have ever declared that two people who meet and live together ought not
  to be long separated. If certain things are more necessary to you than me,
  search for them. Say but one word and you shall never hear of me more. If
  not, for God's sake let us struggle with poverty&mdash;with any evil but
  these continual inquietudes of business which I have been told would last but
  a few months, though every day the end appears more distant! This is the
  first letter in this strain that I have determined to forward you; the rest
  lie by, because I was unwilling to give you pain, and I should not write now
  if I did not think that there would be no conclusion to schemes which demand,
  I am told, your presence."</p>

  <p>Letters written during January and February showed an increasing agitation
  of spirit, a hurry of doubt, and now and then a touch of despair. She
  received nothing from Imlay but hasty notes and random excuses. Once he was
  at Ramsgate, ready to embark for France, but business recalled him to London.
  Mary began to realise that his affection for her had been of another quality
  than hers for him, and that though he felt a sense of obligation towards the
  mother of his child, his passion was dead and his tenderness chilled. Mary
  was startled and bewildered by her own unhappiness. She wrote:</p>

  <p>"Fatigued during my youth by the most arduous struggles, not only to
  obtain independence but to render myself useful; not merely pleasure, for
  which I had the most lively taste (I mean the simple pleasures that flow from
  passion and affection) escaped me, but the most melancholy views of life were
  impressed by a disappointed heart on my mind. Since I knew you I have been
  endeavouring to go back to my former nature and have allowed some time to
  glide away, tinged by the delights which only spontaneous enjoyment can give.
  Why have you so soon dissolved the charm? The present misery&mdash;I cannot
  find a softer word to do justice to my feelings&mdash;appears to me
  unnecessary. Therefore I have not firmness to support it, as you may think I
  ought. I should have been content, and still wish to retire with you to a
  farm&mdash;my God, anything but these continual anxieties...I do not mean to
  complain of insubordinate inconveniences, yet I will simply observe that, led
  to expect you every week, I did not make the arrangements required by the
  present circumstances to procure the necessaries of life. The want of wood
  has made me catch the most violent cold I ever had. My head is so disturbed
  by continual coughing that I am unable to write without stopping frequently
  to recollect myself."</p>

  <p>On an impulse of pride, the unhappy woman added:</p>

  <p>"I do not choose to be a secondary object. If your feelings were in unison
  with mine you would not sacrifice so much for visionary prospects of future
  advantage."</p>

  <p>She tried to assert her independence. She and the "little woman" would go
  away and seek their fortune together. Yet when Imlay wrote kindly, if not
  affectionately, she was again all submission, and wrote: "It is pleasant to
  forgive those we love." She wrote tenderly of her child:</p>

  <p>"My animal is well. I have not yet taught her to eat, but nature is doing
  the business. I gave her a crust to assist cutting her teeth, but now she has
  two she makes good use of them, to gnaw crusts, biscuit, etc. You would laugh
  to see her. She is just like a little squirrel, she will guard a crust for
  two hours, and after fixing her eye on an object for some time, darts on it
  by name as sure as a bird of prey. Nothing can equal her lively spirits. I
  suffer from a cold, but it does not affect her. Adieu. Do not forget to love
  us, and come soon and tell us that you do."</p>

  <p>In another fortnight she was writing indignantly, wounded by vague and
  casual letters from her absent lover. She was stung by his small regard for
  her comfort. She was nursing her child, had no servant, and was living very
  roughly on the small amount of money that he sent her. She said:</p>

  <p>"I should be ashamed to mention these inconveniences if they had been
  unavoidable."</p>

  <p>But while she was living this hard life in Paris, Imlay was writing from
  London that "the secondary pleasures of life" were "very necessary to my
  comfort," and spending, Mary suspected, all that he earned upon himself. To
  add to the trouble between the lovers, some of their letters went astray.
  Mary's neglected cold settled on her chest. She became very weak, and was
  forced to wean the child. Her misery was acute. Her heart told her it was
  impossible that her happiness was over, but her reason made her realise that
  it was. She was far too intelligent not to see that Imlay's behaviour was not
  that of a man in love, and she was as amazed as horrified at his inconstancy,
  on which she had never for a moment reckoned.</p>

  <p>She knew that she had done nothing to deserve his neglect. She had been
  faithful, tender, passionate, willing to support any hardships for his sake,
  to agree to all his plans, to forgo anything else the world might offer her
  for the sake of his companionship and affection; and none of this had been
  enough. He was absorbed in his money-making, in his&mdash;as she
  feared&mdash;casual pleasures; she had become to him but a burden and a
  regret. Had she had more experience she might have expected such a result
  from the nature of their connection, from her lover's character and her own.
  In despair she wrote:</p>

  <p>"I mean not, however, to complain, yet so many feelings are struggling for
  utterance and agitating a heart almost bursting with anguish that I find it
  very difficult to write with any degree of coherence...God preserve this poor
  child and make her happier than her mother! But I am wandering from my
  subject; indeed, my head turns giddy when I think that all the confidence I
  have had in the affection of others should come to this. I did not expect
  this blow from you. I have done my duty to you and my child, and if I have
  not had any return of affection to reward me, I have the sad consolation of
  knowing that I deserved a better fate. My soul is weary, I am sick at heart,
  and but for this little darling I would soon cease to care about a life that
  is now stripped of every charm. You see how stupid I am, muttering
  declamations when I mean simply to tell you that I consider your request for
  me to come to you is merely dictated by honour. Indeed, I scarcely understand
  you. You request me to come and then tell me you have not given up all
  thought of returning to this place. When I determined to live with you, I was
  only governed by affection. I would share poverty with you, but I turn with
  affright from the sea of troubles on which you are entering. I can still
  exert myself to obtain the necessaries of life for my child. She does not
  want more than that at present. I have one or two or three plans in my head
  to earn our subsistence. Do not suppose that, neglected by you, I will lie
  under obligations of a pecuniary kind to you. No, I would sooner submit to
  menial service. I wanted the support of your affection. That gone, all is
  over. I cannot write. I enclose a fragment of a letter written soon after
  your departure, and another which tenderness made me keep back until you had
  written. You will see then the sentiments of a calmer, though not more
  determined moment. Perhaps this is the last letter you will ever receive from
  me."</p>

  <p>Yet next day the unfortunate woman was writing again. Imlay's cool
  letters, dwelling formally on his obligations to her and the child, with dry
  plans for the future, had stung her to the quick.</p>

  <p>"You talk of 'permanent views and future comfort'&mdash;not for me, for I
  am dead to hope. The inquietudes of the last winter have finished the
  business, and my heart is not only broken, but my constitution destroyed. I
  conceive myself in a galloping consumption, and the continual anxiety I feel
  at the thought of leaving my child feeds the fever that nightly devours
  me."</p>

  <p>She then went into practical detail: the child might be brought up by a
  German lady, who was a common acquaintance, and who had a daughter of the
  same age as Fanny. Mary had had three thousand livres from Imlay's bankers.
  She would take a thousand more to clear off her expenses, and then earn her
  own living; she also would entirely give up the acquaintance of her
  lover.</p>

  <p>She then dwelt with unutterable anguish on vanished hopes:</p>

  <p>"When you first entered into these plans you bounded your views to the
  gaining of a thousand pounds. It was sufficient to procure the farm in
  America, which would have been an independence. You find now that you did not
  know yourself and that a certain situation in life is more necessary to you
  than you imagined, more necessary than an uncorrupted heart. In a year or two
  you may procure yourself what you call pleasure, eating, drinking, women, but
  in the solitude of declining life I shall be remembered with regret. I was
  going to say with remorse, but checked my pen. As I have ever concealed the
  nature of my connection with you, your reputation will not suffer. I shall
  never have a confidant. I am content with the approbation of my own mind, and
  if there be a searcher of hearts mine will not be despised..."</p>

  <p>She could not be content with this, but must add a desperate
  postscript:</p>

  <p>"This has been such a period of barbarity and misery I ought not to
  complain of having my share. I wish one moment that I had never heard of the
  cruelties that have been practised here and the next envy the mothers who
  have been killed with their children. Surely I have suffered enough in life
  not to be cursed with a fondness that burns up the vital stream I am
  imparting. You will think me mad. I would I were so, that I could forget my
  miseries&mdash;so that my heart or head would be still..."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Gilbert Imlay hedged. He was not equal to the situation; he could not
  feign an affection that he no longer felt; he could not bring himself to cast
  off utterly the woman who had grown so inconveniently fond of him; he made
  excuses, uttered protestations that Mary at once saw were false, and still
  took refuge in the cares of business, putting off his return to Paris for an
  indefinite period.</p>

  <p>On February 19th Mary wrote to say that her cough was worse, that she was
  weaning her child, that her harassed mind was undermining her health. She
  returned to the bitterness that had ruined her youth&mdash;how tenderly other
  women were treated, and how roughly fortune had dealt with her.</p>

  <p>"I have not found a guardian angel in Heaven or on earth to ward off
  sorrow or care from my bosom."</p>

  <p>She added with keen irony:</p>

  <p>"What sacrifices have you not made for a woman you did not respect! But I
  will not go over this ground. I want to tell you that I do not understand
  you."</p>

  <p>Imlay had assured her that it was not necessary for him to return to
  Paris, but she knew that for business reasons alone it was. She could not
  grasp why he should wish her to come to London, a place so full of sorrowful
  memories to her that she did not wish to see it again. She had no desire to
  face her family, her friends or acquaintances. She wished to go with Imlay to
  America, as they had at first planned, or to remain with him in France.</p>

  <p>"What, is our life then only to be made up of separations? Am I only to
  return to a country that has not merely lost all charm for me, but for which
  I have a feeling of repugnance that almost amounts to horror?..."</p>

  <p>Her financial dependence on Imlay now began to gall her wretchedly. She
  found it a horrible effort to go to his friend to ask for money.</p>

  <p>"Till I can earn money I shall endeavour to borrow some, for I want to
  avoid asking him continually for the sum necessary to maintain me. Do not
  mistake me. I have never been refused, yet I have gone half a dozen times to
  the house and come away without speaking. You can guess why."</p>

  <p>Finally Imlay wrote a guarded letter saying that he had taken a furnished
  house for Mary in London, that he wished her to join him as soon as possible,
  but that he could make no settled plans for the future, owing to pecuniary
  embarrassments. Mary, snatching at straws, read some hope into this
  concession, and wrote from Havre on her way to her lover:</p>

  <p>"I have indeed been so unhappy this winter that I find it is difficult to
  acquire fresh hope with which to regain tranquillity...But for the little
  girl I could almost wish that it should cease to beat, to be no more alive to
  the anguish of disappointment."</p>

  <p>From Brighton she wrote to him again three days later:</p>

  <p>"Here we are, my love, and mean to set out early in the morning, and if I
  can find you I hope to dine with you to-morrow. But why do I write about
  trifles, or anything? Are we not to meet soon? What does your heart say?"</p>

  <p>Sick with mingled hope and apprehension, Mary returned to that London she
  had left in such tranquillity of spirit four years before, a child on her
  knee and nothing but thoughts of Gilbert Imlay in her heart.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>SEVEN &mdash; CLOUDY GOD</h2>

  <p class="quote">This Cloudy God seated on Waters<br>
  Now seen, now obscur'd, King of Sorrows.<br>
  <br>
  <i>Book of Ahaniah</i>.<br>
  William Blake, 1795.</p><br>

  <p class="first">MARY viewed with a sickly sensation of despondency the
  familiar London streets, sober, monotonous in the pallid light of the April
  day. All her happiness and pleasure were associated with Paris, and London
  brought to her mind nothing but miseries. Trying frantically to control her
  apprehension, she arrived at the furnished apartments that Imlay had prepared
  for her in a street in Marylebone&mdash;always hired lodgings for Mary, and
  never a home.</p>

  <p>She had travelled alone, not being able to afford a servant, and was
  therefore burdened with carrying her child and looking after her own baggage.
  A maid had, however, been provided by Imlay, and Mary was able to give the
  sleepy, irritable little girl into this woman's charge.</p>

  <p>Gilbert Imlay was there to meet her, but his greeting was such as
  destroyed her lingering hopes. He endeavoured to be cool and matter of fact,
  but both his natural warmth of disposition and his genuine courtesy made him
  confused and embarrassed. Mary, silent before her supreme misfortune,
  understood that he was prepared to allow her the protection of his name and
  to pay her expenses. He would even pretend to live with her; but he had rooms
  with his business partner in the Strand, and would be able to give her but
  little of his time. He declared that his pecuniary affairs were in a bad
  state, and that he could make no plans whatever for the future. From these
  awkward excuses Mary learnt that love and affection were dead, and even
  respect was dying.</p>

  <p>The truth was that she had, perhaps without knowing it, spoilt the affair
  from the beginning. Gilbert Imlay was not one of those few men who appreciate
  an intellectual mistress. He found it both difficult and tiresome to raise
  what was, after all, to him but an ordinary love affair to those heights of
  grandeur and sublimity where Mary would place it; nor had he any real taste
  for that domesticity which she had contrived to persuade him he liked so
  well. Had she been his wife they might have patched up some arrangement that
  would have served to keep Mary at least fairly satisfied; but, however much
  Gilbert Imlay might think he was bitten with novel notions, he could not give
  Mary all that respect which she nervously demanded. He tried to be tolerant
  and just, to admit that he owed her and the child an obligation; but she was
  not to him more than a mistress, somebody to be taken up, set aside and
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>He was truly immersed in speculation. Though he had the handling of
  considerable sums of money, he was embarrassed as to the future. Large bills
  were owing to him, but his expenses were heavy. His business associates,
  hard, worldly men, told him that he had done a stupid thing in involving
  himself with the authoress of <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>.
  Neither she nor her family nor her friends were likely to suit his mode of
  life; she was over anxious, and always pressed her point home with too
  tenacious a resolution to please a man of Gilbert Imlay's type. She had made
  the profound mistake of allowing him to see how much she cared, and this
  anxious, grasping affection first fatigued, then irritated him. Mary had
  herself inveighed against this mistake in her famous book. She had declared
  that it was foolish of women to try to keep love alive after it had died,
  that they should be content with a placid friendship. She found it impossible
  to put her own advice into practice. She was headlong in love, and all her
  hopes were bound up in this man. Besides, she liked a domestic life; she
  relished the prospect of being attached to Gilbert Imlay's fortunes; she
  wanted his constant companionship, as Lady Russell wanted that of her
  husband&mdash;"to eat with, to walk with, to talk with, to sleep with."
  Nothing she had ever experienced compared in delight and pleasure to her life
  with Gilbert Imlay. Without him existence appeared intolerable.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>She had written from Paris to Mr. Johnson that the manuscript of the first
  volume of a history of the French Revolution lay in her trunk. She knew that
  her bookseller friend would publish this work, and that she could with him
  resume her position as reader, translator and hackwriter. But how dreary did
  this prospect appear! She understood now how arid and unsatisfying her former
  existence had been. She was so stunned by the realisation of her loss that
  she seemed almost to acquiesce in it. Imlay tried to reassure her that he
  would look after her and the child, at least in a pecuniary sense, and made
  his escape. His vanished passion had not been reawakened by her presence.
  Anxiety, fatigue and poverty, the nursing of the child and a heavy cough had
  blemished Mary's charm. She was no longer the shining woman of the barrier,
  or of the cottage at Neuilly, but a pale creature with sunken cheeks, dimmed
  eyes and a flurried manner on the verge of tears. Imlay had experienced the
  truth of the axiom pronounced by a French wit: "It is only after one has
  loved an intellectual woman that one appreciates the affection of a fool." He
  hastened back to his own friends and cruder and less exacting pleasures than
  those offered by Mary's passion that she decked out in embarrassingly noble
  and lofty terms.</p>

  <p>As soon as her lover had left her, a sense of her desolation came over the
  unfortunate woman. She sat down at once and wrote to him. He replied at once
  in friendly terms, but complained that her importunities were unsettling his
  mind when he was absorbed in difficult business. He came, however, to see
  her, and they entered on several of those disastrous explanations, that
  "talking of things out" which never occurs when matters go right and never
  succeeds in putting straight matters that have gone wrong.</p>

  <p>Mary perceived that she was humiliating herself by clinging to a man who
  had done with her, but she could not bring herself to face this intolerable
  truth. After she had been a month in London, in the May, she was writing to
  him about her distressing nights:</p>

  <p>"I have laboured to calm my mind since you left me. Still I find that
  tranquillity is not to be obtained by diversion, a feeling so different from
  resignation and despair. I am, however, no longer angry with you, nor will I
  ever utter another complaint. There are arguments which convince the reason
  while they carry death to the heart&mdash;We have had too many cruel
  explanations, that not only cloud every future prospect but embitter the
  remembrance which alone gives life to affection&mdash;Let the subject never
  be revived! It seems to me that I have not only lost the hope but the power
  of being happy&mdash;Every emotion is now sharpened by anguish&mdash;My soul
  has been shook and my tone of feelings destroyed&mdash;I have gone
  out&mdash;and sought for dissipation, if not amusement, merely to fatigue
  still more I find my irritable nerves&mdash;My friend, my dear friend,
  examine yourself well&mdash;I am out of the question, for alas! I am
  nothing&mdash;and discover what you wish to do, what will render you most
  comfortable&mdash;or, to be more explicit, whether you desire to live with me
  or part forever. When you can once ascertain it, tell me frankly, I conjure
  you, for, believe me, I have very involuntarily interrupted your peace. I
  shall expect you to dinner on Monday and will endeavour to assume a cheerful
  face to please you."</p>

  <p>A few days later, in forwarding him a letter that had been sent to her
  address, she wrote:</p>

  <p>"I am tempted very laconically to wish you a good-morning&mdash;not
  because I am angry or have nothing to say, but to keep down a wounded
  spirit&mdash;I shall make every effort to calm my mind, yet a strong
  conviction seems to whirl round in the very centre of my brain, which, like
  the fiat of fate, emphatically assures me that grief has a firm hold of my
  heart. God bless you!"</p>

  <p>Mary's miseries were added to by family complications. Charles was safely
  in America, though he was by no means doing as well for himself as he had
  boasted to his sisters, Everina was in a situation, but Eliza, who had heard
  from Mr. Johnson of Mary's return to London, decided to leave Upton Park and
  come to the capital with the intention of residing with Mary, whom she
  thought, or pretended to think, a woman comfortably married to a wealthy
  American who would be able to spend large sums on his sister-in-law.</p>

  <p>Mary had not improved her delicate relations with Gilbert Imlay by asking
  him, when he came to London, to get in touch with her sisters and help them
  if possible. He had, after the usual excuses of pressure of business, written
  to Eliza Bishop in the preceding November, in which he had referred to Mary
  as "Mrs. Imlay," and, in well-rounded terms, excused himself with many
  expressions of regard from seeing either of his "dear Mary's" sisters. He had
  promised, however, to alleviate Mrs. Bishop's distress "by all the means in
  our power," although his fortune was not, he added at once, in a very good
  way.</p>

  <p>Eliza, therefore, had had strong hopes raised in her mind that "the
  Imlays," as she thought of them, would be able to do something for her.
  Surely at the worst she could be taken into their household as companion to
  her sister and nurse or governess for the child. Mary had always promised
  such a shelter. Eliza sent to Mr. Johnson to know Mary's address, and gave
  her own. The bookseller, who had seen clearly Mary's painful situation, told
  her of her sister's request; but Mary was too unhappy to do anything, and
  allowed at least a fortnight to go by before she wrote to Eliza.</p>

  <p>To Everina she had written from Havre and Paris two letters, full merely
  of generalisations about the state of France, describing how she had nursed
  Fanny through an attack of smallpox, and mentioning Imlay in the following
  terms:</p>

  <p>"You know I am safe through the protection of an American, a most worthy
  man who joins to uncommon tenderness of heart a quickness of feeling, a
  soundness of understanding and reasonableness of temper rarely to be met
  with. Having been brought up in the interior parts of America, he is a most
  natural, unaffected creature."</p>

  <p>This was all the communication that had passed between the sisters until
  Mary sent two letters in the April of 1795. The friendliness of Mary's first
  letter would naturally cause at least the susceptible Eliza to believe that
  she would receive a very warm welcome from her sister. Mary had described in
  eager terms her pleasant life with Gilbert Imlay and her love for her child.
  Eliza, though full of curiosity, did not therefore question that everything
  was well.</p>

  <p>Mary wrote from the Marylebone lodging to Everina in these terms:</p>

  <p>"When you hear, my dear Everina, that I have been in London near a
  fortnight without writing to you or Eliza, you will perhaps accuse me of
  insensibility, but I shall not lay any stress on my not being well in
  consequence of a violent cold I caught during the time I was nursing, to tell
  you that I put off writing because I was at a loss to know what I could do to
  render Eliza's situation more comfortable. I instantly gave Jones ten pounds
  to send, for a very obvious reason in his own name, to my father, and I could
  send her a trifle of this kind immediately were temporary assistance
  necessary. I believe I told you that Mr. Imlay had not a fortune when I first
  met him; since he has entered into very extensive plans, which promise a
  degree of success though not equal to the first prospect. When a sufficient
  sum is actually realised I know he will give to you and Eliza five or six
  hundred pounds, or more if he can. In what way can this be of the most use to
  you? I am above concealing my sentiments though I have boggled at uttering
  them. It will give me sincere pleasure to be situated near you both. I cannot
  yet say where I shall determine to spend the rest of my life, but I do not
  wish to have a third person in the house with me. My domestic happiness would
  perhaps be interrupted without my being of much use to Eliza. This is not a
  hastily formed opinion, nor is it consequent of my present attachment, yet I
  am obliged now to express it because it appears to me that you have formed
  some such expectation for Eliza. You may wound me by remarking on my
  determination; still, I know on what principle I act and therefore you can
  only judge for yourself. I have not heard from Charles for a great while. By
  writing to me immediately he would relieve me from considerable anxiety."</p>

  <p>Mary still allowed Everina to think that she was married by giving her
  name and address as "Mrs. Imlay, No. 26 Charlotte Street, Rathbone Place."
  Mary wrote to the same purpose to Eliza, though the words were slightly
  different.</p>

  <p>These letters were not very skilful attempts on Mary's part, and certainly
  not very tactful ones, to conceal from her sisters her real situation. They
  also held out delusive hopes. She must have known that there was no
  likelihood that she would be able to obtain from Gilbert Imlay six hundred
  pounds to give to her sisters; she could hardly obtain her own expenses from
  her lover. Everina was displeased by her letter, and Eliza furious at hers
  that she enclosed to her elder sister with the bitter comments:</p>

  <p>"This I have just received. My Everina, what I felt, I shall forever feel!
  It is childish to talk of. After lingering above a fortnight in such cruel
  suspense. Good God! what a letter! How have I merited such pointed cruelty?
  When did I wish to live with her? At what time wish for a moment to interrupt
  their domestic happiness! Was ever a present offered in so humiliating a
  style? Ought the poorest domestics be thus insulted? Are your eyes opened at
  last, Everina? What do you say now to our goodly prospects? I have such a
  mist before my lovely eyes that I cannot now see what I write. Instantly get
  me a situation in Ireland, I care not where. Dear Everina, delay not, but
  tell me you can procure bread; with what hogs I eat it, I care not&mdash;nay
  if exactly the Uptonian breed. Remember I am serious. If you disappoint me my
  misery will be complete. I have enclosed this famous letter to the author of
  the <i>Rights of Woman</i> without any reflection. She shall never hear from
  <i>poor Bess</i> again. Remember I am as fixed as my misery and nothing can
  change my present plan. This letter so strongly agitates me that I know not
  what I say; but this I feel and know, that if you value my existence you will
  comply with my requisition, for I am positive I will never torment our
  amiable friend in Charlotte Street. Is not this a good street, my dear girl?
  At least, poor Bess can say it is a fruitful one. Alas, poor Bess!"</p>

  <p>Eliza had heard grim tales of the French Revolution from refugees who had
  landed at Haverfordwest, and had been staying for over a year in Pembroke;
  some of them were French priests, and one of them, M. Graux, a bishop. A year
  before, in a letter to Everina, Eliza had described the arrival of this
  unfortunate man, who declared that he had been worse used by the Welsh
  peasantry than he would have been if he had been in Paris.</p>

  <p>"This good creature was compelled to walk three miles, and was nearly
  fainting at every step he took surrounded by men, women and children, gazing
  not at his pale face, but at a handkerchief that supplied the place of a wig
  that the waves had stolen. The moment he was housed in Pembroke, all the
  children were admitted to the room, where he sat for many hours, his head
  sunk on the table, and at last he was allowed to go to bed."</p>

  <p>It is to this priest, with whom she had become intimate, that Eliza refers
  in the second letter which she wrote in a hot indignation to Everina:</p>

  <p>"I am so eager for you to say you have procured a situation for me in
  Dublin. I have now only ten days to spend at Pembroke, yet quite uncertain
  what poor Bess's future fate is to be. I mean to stay with my father a week,
  or a little more, so write and tell me the price of the new stage from
  Waterford to the capital. Also inform me from what inn it sets off, not
  forgetting the hour. There is no vessel now that can sail for Ireland, so I
  must send my box to London and from hence to our mother country. What say you
  to Mrs. Imlay's friendly epistle? I told you I returned it with only these
  words&mdash;'Mrs. Bishop has never received any money from America...' Can
  you blame me for returning Mrs. I's letter?...Recollect I value not what
  situation you get me&mdash;agreeable or disagreeable will be equally
  acceptable to the sister of the author of the <i>Rights of Woman</i>...for I
  am sick to death of arguing and accounting for the unaccountable events of
  this wretched life, and am thoroughly tired of the lingering existence that I
  have dragged on year after year, for spring after spring. To receive aught
  now from your Mary appears to me to be the height of meanness. Would to God
  we were both in America with Charles. Do you think it would be possible for
  us to go from Dublin to Philadelphia in an American ship? It is my only hope,
  yet I am afraid to indulge it. I beseech you to write to Charles immediately.
  I am sure our sister would be delighted with this plan, and our new brother
  would of course display all his energy and character to render it
  practicable. Was it greatness of mind or heart which dictated the ever
  memorable letter which has so stupefied me that I know not what I write, for
  I have incessant headaches to such a degree that it is a torture for me to
  take up a pen. Alas, at the end of four long years, could despair itself have
  dreamed of such studied cruelty. No inquiries after my present wants, etc.,
  no wish to see us. Mr. Imlay's silence was a bad omen, and that she could
  remain in London a fortnight and then send poor Bess such a cordial!...The
  last month the good and amiable Graux has been dreadfully embittered; he is
  now very ill and thoroughly hurt with my sublime sister. He sends his love to
  Everina, whom he is much more anxious to see than the famous Mrs.
  Wollstonecraft...Is not this a goodly spring and is not Bess a lucky girl?
  The amiable Mary pined in poverty, while Mrs. Imlay enjoys all her heart can
  sigh for."</p>

  <p>Eliza believed that Mary, having made a wealthy marriage, wished to
  discard her sisters, and the intense bitterness of her letters shows not only
  how deeply she was disappointed, but the emptiness of her own life and her
  envy of what she considered her sister's more brilliant lot. So spiteful was
  her attitude towards Mary that it seems doubtful whether even if she had
  known of that unhappy woman's wretched situation she would have offered her
  any sympathy.</p>

  <p>Imlay had moved his <i>faux mnange</i>, Mary, Fanny, a couple of
  servants, to furnished rooms in Charlotte Street, a sombre row of
  flat-fronted houses that stretched towards the fields and heights of
  Hampstead. It was a respectable lodging, but drab and cheerless, with a
  shabby genteel air. Mary was very straitened for money. The one volume of the
  <i>French Revolution</i> that she had completed did not bring in more than a
  few pounds, and she had not the heart to carry out any of her other schemes.
  She tried to take up again old friends and acquaintances, but found no
  distraction in company, in the theatre or in reading. She was homeless,
  uncertain of the future, and more dependent on Gilbert Imlay's affection as
  she found this vanishing.</p>

  <p>She exerted herself to please him, to give the dingy lodgings the air of a
  home, to dress herself carefully, to set off the merry child with clean
  frocks and ribbons, to be good company when her reluctant lover could be
  beguiled to her dinners or suppers.</p>

  <p>But Gilbert Imlay did not want a home, and Mary's charms, however attired,
  meant nothing to him; the child only reminded him of a tiresome obligation,
  and Mary's nervous gaiety, broken by passionate complaints and desperate
  appeals for renewed love, was a poor substitute for those easy, congenial
  companions with whom he spent most of his leisure.</p>

  <p>The child had been a mistake. A wife, secure in her legal rights, may
  indulge in maternity; but it is dangerous for a mistress to become a mother
  if she hopes to keep her lover's interest. Only a very chivalrous high-minded
  man can endure the discomforts, inconveniences and interruptions that
  children mean, without fatigue and disgust.</p>

  <p>Mary, blooming, shining with love, coming to meet him with her basket of
  grapes along the Neuilly road, Mary, the delicious mistress of the Barrire
  Hotel, was very different from Mary, the burdened, anxious mother, worn out
  by nursing, occupied with petty cares. Gilbert Imlay felt an obligation
  towards Mary, but he believed that it could be met with money, and he
  studied, in his easy, good-humoured way, how to be rid of this woman who had
  not known how to treat a love affair lightly and who would confuse with lofty
  issues what had been to him, at most, a merely pleasant episode.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary's social position was ambiguous. She refused, much to the
  embarrassment of her friends, to keep up the convenient pretences, and with a
  gesture of independence and unconventionality took pains to inform every one
  that she was not Captain Gilbert Imlay's wife. This seemed, while she was
  using his name and had not told the truth of her relations to her sisters,
  somewhat inconsistent. Mary was indeed at this time distracted and scarcely
  knew what she was doing. Even among the broad-minded liberal set who formed
  Mr. Johnson's circle it would not have been easy for her to be received as
  Imlay's mistress, and her acquaintances kept up among themselves the polite
  fiction that she was really married, though the ceremony was no doubt secret
  and possibly doubtful; but, while her friends succeeded in saving her
  reputation despite herself, that her domestic relations, whether illicit or
  not, were unhappy, was clear enough. Gilbert Imlay was seldom at the
  apartments in Charlotte Street, and it soon became impossible for Mary even
  to pretend that there was concord between them.</p>

  <p>Her health became bad again. She wasted as she pined and found it
  impossible to take up her old work. She remembered, with a sigh of sick
  regret, the brilliant, the impetuous Henry Fuseli, who had so dangerously
  roused her admiration. She hoped now to obtain some sympathy and kindness
  from this brilliant friend.</p>

  <p>She called on him, but he would not see her, and though the wife was kind,
  she was a little reserved. Mary felt slighted. She was much alone in London.
  Many of her former acquaintances were pleasant, but not very much interested
  in her troubles. Her famous book, in the flood of works that had appeared
  during the French Revolution, was almost forgotten. The <i>Rights of
  Woman</i> and the <i>Rights of Man</i> had become somewhat stale cries. There
  was an air of profound disillusionment among the intellectuals of London in
  the spring of 1795. Not only was the much vaunted French Revolution a failure
  from the point of view of the idealists, it had involved Europe in a war that
  appeared endless, and everyone who had been of republican sympathies or even
  of liberal tendencies was regarded with horror by most people as an
  accomplice of the Jacobins, murderers and monsters. There was no audience now
  for Mary's theories concerning the equality of the sexes, nor had she the
  spirit to deliver them. She had found out for herself how and why men have
  power over women.</p>

  <p>She kept her intelligence in abeyance while she fed herself with false
  hopes&mdash;of that farm in America and Imlay's children at her knee. Imlay
  had found time to publish a book, <i>The Emigrant</i>. He gave it, in the
  hopes of better sales, the form of a novel, but it had no pretences to be a
  romance, and was merely an American's candid views of the faults of the
  mother country, and in particular of the institution of marriage as practised
  in England. It did not have much success.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary was detached from her family and old friends. George Blood was
  comfortably established in Dublin, but Mary did not write to him, and after
  Eliza had returned her letter she communicated no more with her sisters,
  relieved, perhaps, that this burden at least had gone. She was indeed fast
  reaching a point where she cared nothing for anything but her own misery. Her
  nights were sleepless, her days passed in continual agitation. Suspense
  became her worst torture. Imlay would neither completely leave her nor
  permanently join his life to hers. For days together she did not see him.
  Sometimes when he came it was but an hour's visit. He tried to argue with her
  that they were but tormenting each other, and that it would be better for
  them to part; yet he conceded reluctantly her right to claim him if she
  wished. He had made her no promises, was bound to her by no ties save that of
  the child, and Mary had always declared that it was an indecent thing for a
  man and woman to live together when love was dead.</p>

  <p>Yet she would not, could not, let him go. She would not realise that
  obvious truism that nothing can revive dead passion. She had, indeed, but
  little to offer Gilbert Imlay. Her comeliness was impaired, her temper
  embittered, and though she made continual promises to avoid perilous
  subjects, yet their interviews were filled with her complaints and
  protestations.</p>

  <p>Such a state of desperate agitation could not long continue. She had not
  been in London more than a few months before one dark morning after a night
  of torment she sent out the maid to buy some laudanum to ease the neuralgic
  pains in her head, and Imlay, calling unexpectedly at her lodgings, found her
  about to drink a large quantity of the poison the unsuspecting apothecary had
  sent.</p>

  <p>Mary, beside herself, plainly declared her intention of suicide. He was
  startled, shocked and moved, and persuaded her to accept life and continue to
  struggle for happiness. In his desperation, in order to be rid of her and yet
  not have her on his conscience, he suggested that she should travel in Norway
  and Sweden, taking the child and a maid with her. The excuse was that she
  might collect some back debts owing to him and get some contracts signed, for
  he was doing a considerable business in Scandinavia. He argued, using all his
  arts that Mary found so fascinating to persuade her, that if she was away
  from him several months they might both be able to look at the situation in a
  clearer light, and even yet find some peace. He used caresses to persuade
  her, and Mary was induced to live.</p>

  <p>Free from these continual meetings, these recriminations, protestations
  and arguments, they might become less emotional, Imlay argued, and they would
  be able to decide what was best for the future. In the meanwhile she might
  not only re-establish her health, but procure some sums of money that would
  be useful both to them and to the child.</p>

  <p>Mary, exhausted, unable to resist the man whom she loved, and snatching at
  some faint hope of a revival of his affection during her absence, accepted.
  In June, with the French nurse and the child, she journeyed from London to
  Hull. From there she wrote to Imlay in terms that showed that her anguish was
  by no means stilled or her agitation soothed.</p>

  <p>"We arrived here about an hour ago. I am extremely fatigued with the
  child, who would not rest quiet with anyone but me during the night. Now we
  are here in a comfortless, damp room in a sort of tomb-like house. This,
  however, I shall quickly remedy, for when I have finished this
  letter&mdash;which I must do immediately because the post goes out
  early&mdash;I shall sally forth and inquire about a vessel and an inn. I will
  not depress you by talking of the depression of my spirits or the struggle I
  had to keep alive my dying heart. It is even now too full to allow me to
  write with composure. Imlay, dear Imlay, am I always to be tossed about like
  this? Shall I never find an asylum to rest content in? How can you love to
  fly about continually, dropping down as it were in a new world cold and
  strange every day? Why do you not attach those tender emotions round the idea
  of home, which even now dim my eyes? Fanny is playing near me in high
  spirits. She was so pleased by the noise of the mail horn that she has been
  continually imitating it. Adieu!"</p>

  <p>The following day she wrote to tell him that a lady had offered to take
  her in a private coach to Beverley, where Mary had had a brief gleam of
  happiness as a child. The journey would be tedious and uncomfortable, but
  Mary added:</p>

  <p>"Why talk of such inconveniences, which are in fact trifling when compared
  to the sinking of the heart I have felt? I did not intend to touch this
  painful string."</p>

  <p>Mary remained in Hull waiting first for a boat, then for a wind, until the
  end of June. This dreary period was broken only by the visit to Beverley,
  which she found sorely disappointing. It was her lost childhood she was in
  search of, the days when she had so eagerly tripped to the little day school
  confident in her own powers to learn, to succeed. Now the place looked poor
  and mean. She could not understand why she had remembered it as a splendid
  town with wide streets and noble buildings.</p>

  <p>Imlay wrote to her a long letter on what he termed "the state of his own
  mind." He made general observations, which, as Mary quickly noticed, did not
  help the situation. She replied:</p>

  <p>"I shall always consider it as one of the most serious misfortunes of my
  life that I did not meet you before satiety had rendered your senses so
  fastidious to almost close up every tender avenue of sentiment and affection
  that leads to your sympathetic heart."</p>

  <p>She followed these remarks with some sad reasoning referring to Imlay's
  strong health and gross appetite, and warning him that he did not know the
  ineffable delight, the exquisite pleasure that arises from a union of
  affection and desire:</p>

  <p>"...and the whole soul and senses are abandoned to a lively imagination
  that renders every emotion delicate and rapturous."</p>

  <p>She instantly added:</p>

  <p>"Well! you will ask what is the result of all this reasoning? Why, I
  cannot help thinking that it is possible for you, having great strength of
  mind, to return to nature, to gain a sanity of constitution, a purity of
  feeling which would open your heart to me&mdash;I would fain rest there! Yet,
  convinced more than ever of the sincerity and tenderness in my attachment for
  you, the involuntary hopes which a determination to live has revived are not
  sufficiently strong to dissipate the cloud that despair has spread over
  futurity. I have looked at the sea and at my child, hardly daring to own to
  myself the secret wish that it might become our tomb, that the heart, still
  so alive with anguish, might be quieted in death. Are we ever to meet again?
  Will you endeavour to render that meeting happier than the last?...I cannot
  indeed without agony think of your bosom being continually contaminated, and
  bitter are the tears which exhaust my eyes when I recollect why my child and
  I are forced to stray from an asylum, where after so many storms I had hoped
  to rest, smiling at any fate. These are not common sorrows, or can you
  perhaps conceive how much active fortitude it requires to labour perpetually
  to blunt the shafts of disappointments. Examine now yourself and ascertain
  whether you can live in something like a settled style. Let our confidence in
  future be unbounded. Consider whether you find it necessary to sacrifice what
  you term 'the zest of life.' When you have once a clear view of your own
  motives, your own incentive to action, do not deceive me! The train of
  thought which the writing of this epistle woke makes me so restless that I
  must take a walk to rouse and calm my mind. But first let me tell you that if
  you really wish to promote my happiness, you will endeavour to give me as
  much as you can of yourself..."</p>

  <p>Gilbert Imlay found much ease of mind in a return to that "zest of life"
  which he had declared to Mary was necessary to him; but he was tormented by
  her letters and disturbed, when he went to close up the Charlotte Street
  apartment, at finding some papers that Mary had written when she had intended
  to commit suicide. He believed that some of these cast reflections upon
  himself, and was startled to think of the bad effect they might have had on
  the public had they been published. At the same time some of the expressions
  were ambiguous and the documents had been partly destroyed.</p>

  <p>He wrote a protest and demanded an explanation, and Mary answered from
  Hull:</p>

  <p>"You were certainly wrong in supposing that I did not mention you with
  respect, though without my being conscious of it some sparks of resentment
  may have animated the gloom of despair. Yes, with less affection I should
  have been more respectful. However, the regard which I had for you is so
  unequivocal to myself that I imagined it must be sufficiently obvious to
  everyone else. Besides, the only letter I intended for the public eye was to
  &mdash;&mdash; and that I destroyed from delicacy before you saw it, because
  it was only written (of course warmly in your praise) to prevent any odium
  being thrown on you..."</p>

  <p>A postscript anxiously urged his continued writing:</p>

  <p>"Do write by every occasion. I am anxious to know how your affairs go on.
  Still more be convinced that you are not separating yourself from us. My
  little darling is calling for papa and adding her parrot word, 'Come, come.'
  Will you not come...?"</p>

  <p>Mary's next letter spoke of her ill health:</p>

  <p>"I am not quite well. If I have any good sleep or not I wake in the
  morning with violent fits of trembling, and in spite of all my efforts, the
  child&mdash;everything&mdash;fatigues me which I seek for solace or
  amusement."</p>

  <p>She then revealed one of the causes of contention between herself and her
  lover when she remarked that she had a letter of introduction to a doctor of
  the place.</p>

  <p>"His wife is a pretty woman. I can admire, you know, a pretty woman when I
  am alone...The wind does not appear inclined to change, so I am forced to
  linger. When do you think you shall be able to set out for France? I do not
  entirely like the aspect of your affairs and still less your connections on
  either side of the water. Even now I am almost afraid to ask you whether the
  pleasure of being free does not overbalance the pain you felt at parting with
  me..."</p>

  <p>She again urged him not to be so keen on money making, and added:</p>

  <p>"I should not much mind having to struggle with the world again. Accuse me
  not of pride, yet sometimes when nature has opened my heart to its author, I
  have wondered that you have not set a higher value on my heart."</p>

  <p>When the captain sent to inform her that she must be on board in the
  course of a few hours, as the wind had suddenly changed, Mary sat down in the
  inn parlour and wrote again and with an increase of trepidation:</p>

  <p>"My spirits are agitated, I scarcely know why&mdash;In quitting England,
  it seems to be a fresh parting&mdash;Surely you will not forget me&mdash;A
  thousand weak forebodings assault my soul and the state of my health renders
  me sensible to everything...The child is perfectly well. My hand seems
  unwilling to add adieu. I know not why this inexpressible sadness has taken
  possession of me&mdash;It is not a presentiment of ill, yet having been so
  perpetually the sport of disappointment&mdash;having a heart that has been as
  it were a mark for misery, I dread to meet wretchedness in some new
  shape&mdash;Well, let it come&mdash;I care not! What have I to dread, who
  have so little to hope for?"</p>

  <p>When she was on board, the following morning she wrote again:</p>

  <p>"I was hurried on board yesterday about three o'clock, the wind having
  changed. But before evening it veered round to the old point, and here we are
  in the midst of mists of water, only taking advantage of the tide to advance
  a few miles. You will scarcely suppose that I left the town with reluctance,
  yet it is even so, for I wished to receive another letter from you...The
  vessel is very commodious and the captain a civil, open-hearted kind of man.
  There being no other passengers I have the cabin to myself, which is
  pleasant...Fanny begins to play with the cabin boy and is as gay as a lark. I
  will labour to be tranquil and am in every mood."</p>

  <p>While the ship was still riding at anchor waiting for a favourable wind
  the pilot brought out some letters, among which was one for Mary from Imlay;
  but it had no consolation for her. She wrote:</p>

  <p>"I have a violent headache, yet I am obliged to take care of the child,
  who is a little tormented by the sea, because Marguerite is unable to do
  anything, she is rendered so sick by the motion of the ship as we ride at
  anchor. These are, however, trifling inconveniences compared with anguish of
  mind, compared to the sinking of a broken heart. To tell you the truth I
  never suffered in my life so much from depression of spirit&mdash;from
  despair. I do not sleep, or, if I close my eyes, it is to have the most
  terrifying dream, in which I often meet you with different casts of
  countenance...One thing let me tell you. When we meet again&mdash;surely we
  are to meet&mdash;it must be to part no more. I mean not to have the sea
  between us; it is more than I can support. The pilot is hurrying me. God
  bless you."</p>

  <p>The ship rode at anchor for five dreary days&mdash;"imprisoned by the
  wind."</p>

  <p>"I am now going on shore with the captain, though the weather be rough, to
  seek for milk, etc., at a little village, and to take a walk, after which I
  hope to sleep...confined here, surrounded by disagreeable smells, I have lost
  what little appetite I had, and I lie awake till thinking almost drives me to
  the brink of madness&mdash;only to the brink, I never forget, even in the
  feverish slumbers I sometimes fall into, the misery I am labouring to blunt
  the sense of by every exertion in my power."</p>

  <p>She added what she must have known to be the bitter truth:</p>

  <p>"Are you not tired of this lingering adieu?"</p>

  <p>Yet she must write one more letter on the Sunday morning, June 21st:</p>

  <p>"The captain last night, after I had written my letter to you intended to
  be left at the little village, promised to go to Hull to pass the day. He had
  a troublesome sail, and now I must hurry on board again for the wind has
  changed. I half expected to find a letter from you here. Had you written one
  haphazard it would have been kind and considerate. You might have known, if
  you had thought, that the wind would not permit me to depart. These are the
  attentions more grateful to the heart than offers of service&mdash;But why do
  I foolishly continue to look for them? Adieu! adieu! My friend&mdash;your
  friendship is very cold&mdash;you see I am hurt. God bless you! I may perhaps
  be, some time or other, independent in every sense of the word...I will break
  or bend this weak heart; yet even now it is full. Yours sincerely, Mary. The
  child is well. I did not leave her on board."</p>

  <p>After a stormy, troublesome voyage Mary arrived at Gothenburg on June
  27th. The distracted woman, who could soothe her nerves only by doses of
  laudanum, had been very ill while on board ship. From her inn she wrote again
  to Imlay:</p>

  <p>"I arrived in Gothenburgh this afternoon after vainly attempting to land
  at Arendall. I have now but a moment before the post goes out to inform you
  we have got here, though not without considerable difficulties. We were sent
  ashore in a boat about twenty miles below. What I suffered in the vessel I
  will not now descant upon nor mention the pleasure I received from the sight
  of the rocky coast. This morning, however, walking to join the carriage that
  would transport us to this place, I fell, without any previous warning,
  senseless on the rocks, and how I escaped with life I can scarcely guess. I
  was in a stupor for a quarter of an hour; the suffusion of blood at last
  restored me to my senses. The concussion is great and my brain confused, but
  the child is well. The twenty miles ride in the rain after my accident
  sufficiently deranged me&mdash;and here I could not get a fire to warm me or
  anything warm to eat&mdash;The inns are mere stables, but I must nevertheless
  go to bed. For God's sake let me hear from you immediately, my friend. I am
  not well, and yet you see I cannot die."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The Northern climate seemed, however, to suit Mary, and her health soon
  recovered. She went from place to place in Sweden and Norway doing Imlay's
  business efficiently. She was received everywhere as his wife. He had,
  indeed, given her a power of attorney, and in this paper distinctly referred
  to her as "Mary Imlay, my wife." And, though Mary had thought it, owing to
  her pride, advisable to let her London friends know what her real relations
  with Imlay were, she did not think it necessary to shock the propriety of the
  Norwegian and Swedish merchants who introduced her to their families.</p>

  <p>The change of scene also restored her to some tranquillity. She began to
  write a series of letters on Norway and Sweden for publication, intending,
  with her usual industry, to turn this journey to some financial account. She
  was extremely anxious to earn money and to be independent of Imlay, and she
  foresaw the time approaching when she would have to spend something more than
  the cost of milk and crusts on Fanny. Through these long letters, descriptive
  of the scenes and people among whom she found herself, Mary continued her
  personal narrative. These parts were deleted before her letters were
  published by Mr. Johnson. Her letters to Imlay&mdash;and she must have known
  this, but was too distracted to listen to the dictates of her own common
  sense&mdash;were not likely to please, amuse or touch a man already weary of
  her love.</p>

  <p>They indeed consisted of accounts of her discomfort and misery, and
  reproaches, however delicately disguised. She appeared to ask for nothing,
  yet the exasperated Imlay must have read between the lines and seen that she
  was in truth demanding everything&mdash;the whole of his life, attention,
  affection and passion forever. Every misery that occurred to her was detailed
  to him&mdash;her fall, her fatigue, the badness of the inn, the chatter of
  the people to whom she had introductions and who in vain tried to amuse her,
  the illness of Marguerite and the difficulty little Fanny had with her
  teeth.</p>

  <p>"My friend, my friend, I am not well. The deadly weight of sorrow lies
  heavily on my heart. How flat, dull and unprofitable appears to me all the
  bustle in which I see people here so eagerly enter. I long every night to go
  to bed, to hide my melancholy face in my pillow. There is a canker worm in my
  bosom that never sleeps."</p>

  <p>Imlay had told her that business would take him to France, and perhaps to
  Switzerland, and in one of his letters beguiled her with the hope that he
  might meet her at Basle or Paris.</p>

  <p>She answered this in the same melancholy strain:</p>

  <p>"Everything fatigues me. This is a life that cannot last long. You must
  determine in respect to futurity, and when you have I will act accordingly. I
  mean we must either resolve to live together or part forever...You can only
  contribute to my comfort (it is the consolation I am in need of) by being
  with me, and if the tenderest friendship is of any value why will you not
  look to me for a degree of satisfaction that heartless affection cannot
  bestow? Tell me then, will you determine to meet me at Basle? I shall, I
  should imagine, be at Hamburg before the close of August, and after you have
  settled your affairs in Paris, could we not meet there?"</p>

  <p>She knew, in the secret anguish of her distracted soul, that Gilbert Imlay
  did not wish to meet her either at Hamburg or anywhere else; but, though she
  appeared to offer him so generously and candidly his freedom, she was
  clinging to him with every art and all the strength in her power.</p>

  <p>"There was a gloominess diffused through your last letter, the impression
  of which still rests on my mind. Believe me, there is nothing I would not
  endure in the way of privation rather than disturb your tranquillity...I grow
  more and more attached to my little girl and I cherish this affection without
  fear...Love is a want of my heart. I have examined myself lately with more
  care than formerly and find that to deaden is not to calm the mind...Despair,
  since the birth of my child has rendered me stupid&mdash;Soul and body seemed
  to be fading away before the withering touch of disappointment...Still, when
  we meet again I will not torment you, I promise you. I blush when I recollect
  my former conduct and will not in future confound myself with the beings whom
  I feel to be my inferiors I will listen to delicacy or pride."</p>

  <p>In other words Mary, desperately and passionately regarding herself as
  Imlay's wife before God, would not conduct herself as she had hitherto done
  with the furious jealousy of one of those casual mistresses whom she so
  disdained and detested.</p>

  <p>She, in a pitiful attempt to rouse his interest, wrote to him of the
  purity of the air, and how being continually out in it&mdash;for she slept in
  the country every night&mdash;had altered her appearance. Her cheeks were
  rosy, her eyes bright and her step sprightly, and again the unhappy woman
  tried to cast her lures for her lover:</p>

  <p>"Do not tell me that you are happier without me. Will you not come to us
  in Switzerland? Ah, why do you not love us with more sentiment? Why are you a
  creature of such sympathy that the warmth of your feelings rather than the
  quickness of your senses hardens your heart? It is my misfortune that my
  imagination is perpetually shading your defects and lending you charms, while
  the grossness of your senses makes you (call me not vain) overlook graces in
  me that only dignity of mind and a sensibility of an expanding heart can
  give."</p>

  <p>When she failed to receive an expected letter from him, she wrote:</p>

  <p>"Believe me, there is such a thing as a broken heart! I have endeavoured
  to fly from myself and launched into all the dissipation that is possible
  here, only to feel keener anguish when alone with my child. Still, could
  anything please me, had not disappointment cut me off from life, this
  romantic country, these fine evenings would interest me. My God! can
  anything? and am I ever to feel alive again, or only this painful sensation
  which cannot, will not, last long...?"</p>

  <p>Mary began to shudder for the future of her child, whom she had, with the
  thoughtlessness of passion, brought into a world in which she could herself
  find no place.</p>

  <p>"Poor lamb! It may run very well in a tale that 'God will temper the wind
  to the shorn lamb!' but how can I expect that she will find protection when
  my naked bosom has had to brave continually the pitiless storm...? All is not
  right somewhere! When you first knew me I was not thus lost. I could still
  confide&mdash;for I opened my heart to you; of this only comfort you have
  deprived me, while my happiness, you tell me, was your first object...Your
  not writing is cruel and my reason is perhaps disturbed by constant
  wretchedness."</p>

  <p>Convinced that all hope of reconciliation was over between herself and
  Gilbert Imlay, she wrote to tell him that she had begun literary work, that
  she might be quite independent; then in a reaction of despair again came her
  complaints forced from her agony of mind, her appeal for letters and her
  struggle for composure.</p>

  <p>At length the tormented Imlay laid the onus of the future on her; she was
  to decide whether they were to live together or to separate. Forgetting
  delicacy, dignity, common sense and wisdom, Mary at once wrote:</p>

  <p>"I wish for us to live together, because I want you to acquire an habitual
  tenderness for my poor girl. I cannot bear to think of leaving her alone in
  the world or that she should be only protected by your sense of duty. Next to
  preserving her my most earnest wish is not to disturb your peace. I have
  nothing to expect and little to fear in life. There are wounds which can
  never be healed, but they may be allowed to fester in silence without
  wincing. When we meet again you shall be convinced that I have more
  resolution than you give me credit for&mdash;I will not torment you."</p>

  <p>She signed this letter "Mary Imlay," and then wrote:</p>

  <p>"I have been subscribing other letters so I mechanically did the same to
  yours."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Though Mary doubtless did wish to secure Imlay's protection for her child,
  to give the little girl at least a semblance of a home, this letter, in which
  she decided to live once more with a man who she knew was inconstant and
  indifferent, was a piteous surrender of pride, vanity and womanly honour. It
  meant that she would endure his infidelities, his absences, his absorption in
  his business&mdash;everything&mdash;that she might at least have some of his
  time and attention, a little of his company, some chance caresses, and
  continue to call herself by his name.</p>

  <p>Even this prospect of a very limited chance of happiness consoled her. She
  regained some vigour of mind and complete health of body. She promised Imlay
  that when she rejoined him she would restrain all those violences that
  exasperated him, all those questionings and reproaches that he found
  unendurable, though she warned him that she could not live without affection
  or passion. She had, she said, snatched some "moments of exquisite delight"
  wandering through the woods and resting on the rocks. She wrote again
  emphasising her wish to settle the future, for when she had said that she
  wished Imlay to continue to live with her he had not answered positively that
  he accepted her decision.</p>

  <p>"This state of suspense, my friend, is intolerable. We must determine on
  something, and soon. We must meet shortly or part forever. I was sensible
  that I acted foolishly&mdash;but I was wretched&mdash;when we were
  together&mdash;Expecting too much I let the pleasure I might have caught slip
  from me. I cannot live with you&mdash;I ought not&mdash;if you form another
  attachment, but I promise you mine shall not be intruded upon you."</p>

  <p>She said that she would provide for her child herself, that she would be
  as obedient as a spaniel to Gilbert Imlay's every whim if only he would not
  cast her off forever, yet, if he intended doing so, she could not endure to
  correspond with him.</p>

  <p>Through postal delay she received together, after a long silence, five
  letters from Imlay, all written in a stern and reproachful tone that at
  length roused her long-slumbering pride.</p>

  <p>"Five of your letters have been sent after me from Stromstad. One, dated
  14th July, is written in a style which I may have merited, but did not expect
  from you. However, this is not a time to reply to it, except to assure you
  that you shall not be tormented with any more of these complaints. I am
  disgusted with myself for having so long importuned you with my affection. My
  child is very well."</p>

  <p>Before the month of August was over she was writing:</p>

  <p>"You tell me that my letters torture you. I will not describe the effect
  yours have on me. I received three this morning, the last dated the 7th of
  this month. I may not give vent to the emotions they produce. Certainly you
  are right, our minds are not congenial. I have lived in an ideal world and
  fostered sentiments that you do not comprehend, or you would not treat me
  thus. I am not, I will not be merely an object of compassion, a clog, however
  light, to tease you. Forget that I exist. I will never remind you. Be
  free&mdash;I will not torment when I cannot please. I can take care of my
  child.</p>

  <p>"You need not continually tell me that our fortune is inseparable, that
  you will try to cherish tenderness for me. Do no violence to yourself. When
  we are separated our interests&mdash;since you give so much weight to
  pecuniary considerations&mdash;will be entirely divided. I want not
  protection without affection, and support I need not while my faculties are
  undisturbed. Be not alarmed, I shall not force myself on you any more. Adieu.
  I am agitated, my whole frame is convulsed, my lips tremble as if shook by
  cold or fire seems to be circulating in my veins. God bless you."</p>

  <p>On September 6th:</p>

  <p>"Gracious God, is it impossible for me to stifle something like resentment
  when I receive fresh proof of your indifference? What I have suffered this
  last year is not to be forgotten. I have not that happy substitute for
  wisdom, insensibility, and the lively sympathies which bind me to my
  fellow-creatures are all of a painful kind. They are agonies of a broken
  heart. Pleasure and I have shaken hands. I am weary of travelling, yet seem
  to have no home, no resting place to look to&mdash;I am strangely cast
  off&mdash;How often passing through these rocks I have thought, 'But for this
  child I would lay my head on one of them and never open my eyes again.'"</p>

  <p>On September 25th Mary was at Hamburg, from where she sent two letters,
  still in agonised terms, bidding Imlay come to a decision. She ran over all
  the old arguments, as if arguments were of any use in this case&mdash;why
  could he not abandon his gross pleasures, his frantic money making for what
  she could offer? All her love, affection, interest, loyalty and devotion were
  at this man's service, all her charms and gifts were offered to him, like a
  cluster of flowers held in the hand, and he dashed them aside with shamefaced
  excuses.</p>

  <p>The force of this tragedy was more than Mary could support; she dwelt
  continually on her misfortunes, which seemed to her incredible. She had
  wanted so little&mdash;the love of an ordinary man, his children, a modest
  home. All her ambitions had flickered down to the light on Gilbert Imlay's
  hearth.</p>

  <p>She had been, in her unhappy childhood and youth, sickened and resentful
  of poverty, but she had been willing to face even that with her lover, to act
  as his housekeeper, his servant, to deny herself everything but his love.</p>

  <p>The rude life on a farm in the backwoods of America, the continual ordeal
  of child bearing, an exile from her friends, her interests, her
  country&mdash;all this had spelt bliss to her. Her few poor gifts she only
  valued if they might earn money for him, her scrap of fame was cast aside.
  All her plans and projects for the future had vanished; she was content to
  live with Gilbert Imlay on sufferance, not his wife, not his lover, merely a
  woman to whom he had an obligation. But she had impulses of pride. When
  preparing to return to England, she wrote to Imlay:</p>

  <p>"I will write to Mr. Johnson to procure me an obscure lodging and not to
  inform anybody of my arrival. There I will endeavour in a few months to
  obtain the sum necessary to take me to France...From you I will not receive
  any more. I am not yet sufficiently humbled to depend on your
  beneficence...Some people whom my unhappiness has interested, though they
  know not the extent of it, will assist me to obtain the object I have in
  view&mdash;the education of my child. Should a peace take place ready money
  will go a long way in France and I will borrow a sum, which my industry shall
  enable me to pay at my leisure, to purchase a small estate for my girl. The
  assistance I shall find necessary to complete her education I can get at an
  easy rate in Paris."</p>

  <p>All this practical, sensible stuff was very well, but the last lines of
  the letter cancelled it:</p>

  <p>"It is needless to say that I am not in a state of mind to bear suspense,
  but I wish to see you, though it be for the last time."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary landed at Dover after an unexpectedly short passage. She experienced
  to the full the dreariness of returning to her own country without any one to
  meet her, and finding herself once more in an inn, friendless among
  strangers. She did not dare to go to London, for she feared to surprise Imlay
  with another woman&mdash;by now she strongly suspected some permanent
  rival&mdash;so she wrote to him from Dover on October 1st, reminding him
  again that he had told her she must decide for herself, and that she
  <i>had</i> decided that, for the sake of the child, they should continue to
  live together.</p>

  <p>Her plea was still for an interview&mdash;even if she had a
  rival&mdash;even if she and her lover should meet for the last time. She
  repeatedly assured him that he need not concern himself with her or with the
  child if only he would see her once again.</p>

  <p>So ended the letter she wrote from Dover:</p>

  <p>"Should you come here (a few months ago I could not have doubted it) you
  will find me at &mdash;&mdash; [<i>she gave the name of the inn</i>]. If you
  prefer meeting me on the road tell me where."</p>

  <p>So with the most piteous, baseless hopes the unhappy creature tried to
  deceive herself. Imlay compromised. Mary's absence had not solved his
  problem. He still felt himself under an obligation to her and the child
  without having the least desire for her company or the least interest in
  Fanny, and he was, without caring to admit as much, heartily sick of the
  whole affair, to which Mary seemed to him to have given a most exaggerated
  importance.</p>

  <p>Fearful that she would again attempt to commit suicide, and hoping perhaps
  that she would gradually detach herself from him, he still kept her in
  suspense, provided her again with a furnished lodging and servants. He
  visited her, but not as a lover. Mary was in that state of misery which was
  bound to force her to bring matters to a tragic climax. Imlay had been
  imprudent enough to engage for her service the women whom he had employed in
  the hired rooms that he used as a bachelor establishment. One of these, the
  cook, noticed Mary's extreme agitation, and the situation between the
  supposed man and wife was eagerly gossiped over in the kitchen. This stage of
  affairs lasted for a month. Mary made a listless attempt to go about her life
  as before. She delivered to the sadly sympathetic Joseph Johnson the
  manuscript for her <i>Letters from Norway</i>, her best work. She called on
  other old friends. Among these was Henry Fuseli, whose brilliant
  companionship she recalled with a pang. Again he refused to see her, fearing
  with masculine timidity an emotional scene, for the state of Mary's affairs
  was well known in literary London.</p>

  <p>Sophia Fuseli was, as before, kind; she understood and she was sorry for
  what she understood. If she drew any moral lessons from the other woman's
  misery, she did not deliver them, and while guarding the sanctity of her own
  orthodox establishment she did not censure the rebel who had made such a
  failure of revolt.</p>

  <p>Mary then remembered, and with bitterness, the letters that she had
  written to Fuseli, and wrote to ask for them back in a communication that
  made no attempt to hide her present wretched circumstances:</p>

  <p>"When I returned from France I visited you, sir, but finding myself after
  my late journey in a very different situation I vainly imagined you would
  have called upon me. I simply tell you what I thought, yet I write not at
  present to comment on your conduct or expostulate. I have long ceased to
  expect kindness or affection from any human creature. I am alone. I have been
  treated brutally, but I daily labour to remember that I have still the duty
  of a mother to fulfil. I have written more than I intended, as I only meant
  to request you to return my letters. I wish to have them.
  Adieu.&mdash;Mary."</p>

  <p>Henry Fuseli was at this time absorbed in his Milton Gallery, a companion
  to his Shakespeare Gallery, which was to consist of forty pictures of
  different sizes on such subjects as <i>Satan Risen from the Flood</i>,
  <i>Satan Calling Up his Legions</i>, <i>The Lapland Witch</i> and <i>Satan
  Rising from Chaos</i>. With such important matters on his mind, Henry Fuseli
  was not to be vexed with a woman whom he dismissed as a lovesick
  bluestocking. Her letters were not returned to her. Some of them were
  destroyed and some of them left carelessly among the painter's papers, and
  published, including this last one she ever wrote to him, by his executor,
  John Knowles, in 1831.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary had now lost all control, restraint and dignity. She was almost in
  the condition that Eliza Bishop had been in when, in the hired hackney coach,
  she had bitten her wedding ring and fallen from one fit of frenzy into
  another. Her passion had become an obsession. She became absorbed in trying
  to find out if she had a definite rival in Gilbert Imlay's fickle heart or if
  he had been merely won from her by casual grossnesses.</p>

  <p>Her agony was sharpened by his charm when he did come to visit her. He
  could still hold her in his arms, caress her, laugh with the
  child&mdash;raise his glass to her health, cast a knot of flowers into her
  lap&mdash;and leave her to lonely nights and distracted days.</p>

  <p>The doses of laudanum that she took lessened her power of self-control.
  She noticed the cook's half-sympathetic curiosity, remembered that this woman
  had been, whilst she, Mary, was in Norway, in Imlay's employ, and began to
  question her about the life that Gilbert Imlay had led when he had been
  alone.</p>

  <p>Half fearful of the consequences, yet unable to resist the drama of this
  poignant piece of scandal, the woman, after a show of reluctance, informed
  Mary that Gilbert Imlay had an establishment where he kept another mistress,
  an actress whom he had picked up at one of the smaller theatres on the
  outskirts of London&mdash;a strolling player whose uneducated vivacity and
  vulgar charm the young American preferred to Mary's fastidious overwrought
  passion and delicate intellectualism.</p>

  <p>The servant told Mary where this house was, and assured her that when Mr.
  Imlay declared that he was absent on business he was really enjoying the
  company of this new mistress. This revelation of her lover's complete perfidy
  was what Mary had been prepared for. She had suspected it; she had asked him
  to his face again and again if she had a rival. He had contrived to evade
  her, and she had contrived to stifle her doubts. It still seemed to her
  incredible that she should be thus insulted. Her deepest pang was that while
  she had been starved for love, affection, companionship, this man, her
  beloved, had been lavishing his time and caresses on a hired wanton.</p>

  <p>Without pausing for advice or reflection, and completely forgetting all
  she had said and written about the ethics of love, passion and the proper
  behaviour for women, Mary, hatless and cloakless, left her frightened
  servants and her whimpering child and ran out in the November gloom of the
  narrow London street. Panting, she arrived at the house revealed to her by
  the cook, rang the bell and demanded to see Mr. Gilbert Imlay. The
  unsuspecting maid admitted her. Her lover was there, and so too was her gay
  and insolent rival. Mary flung open the parlour door and faced them.</p>

  <p>Gilbert Imlay now paid to the full the penalties for his inconstancy and
  deceit. Mary's hysteric outburst had the force of insanity. She reproached
  the cornered man for his vices and his defects, his faults and errors,
  forgetting that it was the very qualities she now so abused that had first
  attracted her towards him. Had he been cold, austere, precise or difficult he
  would not have formed the connection with her that now gave her this claim on
  him. It often happens that a lofty-minded woman becomes hopelessly enamoured
  of a sensualist entirely for those physical attractions, for that easy
  amorousness and charming ardour which she afterwards abuses when the man,
  following his nature, has tired of her exacting passion.</p>

  <p>Mary's position was atrociously false. Not only was she not this man's
  wife, he had made her no promises of fidelity, and he had reasoned with her
  often enough that it would be wiser for them to break their connection before
  it ended in disaster. That disaster had now occurred. Mary forgot that she
  had written several times she would give her lover up, torment him no more,
  once he ceased to care. She forgot that, according to her own ideas, she had
  no claim on him. Had she not scornfully said that there should be no union
  without love?</p>

  <p>It was no fault of hers and no fault of Gilbert Imlay's that he had ceased
  to love her&mdash;it was something entirely beyond his control. According to
  his own standards, the man had behaved to her with some consideration and
  tenderness, though he was not disposed to forgo for her sake what he termed
  "the zest of life."</p>

  <p>Now he was outraged and disgusted by her violence. His sole thought was to
  get her out of the house; and the authoress of the <i>Rights of Woman</i>
  found herself turned into a darkening street as if she had been a virago
  shouting in a tavern. She was in no condition to be left alone; but Gilbert
  Imlay, exhausted and indignant, did not follow her, but returned to her
  alarmed and insolent rival.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary arrived alone at her lodgings, staggering in her walk, her brain on
  fire, her legs trembling beneath her, shuddering from physical nausea. She
  was in a state of abject despair, and after a night in which she was tortured
  by the torments of insanity she resolved for the second time to destroy
  herself.</p>

  <p>It was some hours, however, before she could find the strength to leave
  the house. She was left alone in the company of the servants, who, terrified
  at the result of their treachery, crept about with downcast looks. She made
  no effort to see the child, whom she left to the care of the hired nurse.</p>

  <p>A light fog lay over the city when Mary at length dragged herself off her
  bed, put on the gown she had bought to please Imlay, and, sinking on her
  knees before a chair, drew towards her writing materials and wrote what she
  believed was her last letter:</p>

  <p>"I write to you now on my knees; imploring you to send my child and the
  maid with &mdash;&mdash; to Paris, to be consigned to the care of Madame
  &mdash;&mdash;, rue &mdash;&mdash;, section &mdash;&mdash; Should they be
  removed &mdash;&mdash; can give their direction. Let the maid have all my
  clothes without distinction. Pray pay the cook her wages and do not mention
  the confession which I forced from her; a little sooner or later is of no
  consequence. Nothing but my extreme stupidity could have made me blind so
  long. Yet, whilst you assured me that you had no attachment, I thought we
  might still have lived together. I shall make no comments on your conduct or
  any appeal to the world. Let my wrongs sleep with me. Soon, very soon, I
  shall be at peace. When you receive this my burning head will be cold. I
  would encounter a thousand deaths rather than a night like the last. Your
  treatment has thrown my mind into a state of chaos, yet I am serene, free. I
  go to find comfort and my only fear is that my poor body will be insulted by
  an endeavour to recall my hated existence. But I shall plunge into the Thames
  where there is the least chance of my being snatched from the death I seek.
  God bless you! May you never know by experience what you have made me endure.
  Should your sensibility ever awake, remorse will find its way to your heart,
  and in the midst of business and sensual pleasures I shall appear before you
  as the victim of your deviation from rectitude."</p>

  <p>Leaving this letter with the frightened nurse to be given to Captain Imlay
  when he should call, or to be sent to him if he did not call, Mary flung on
  her hat and cloak and went out into the November afternoon. It was cold, the
  pavements dirty and greasy, the fog low over the fronts of the prim, flat
  houses, over the roads where the filth lay and the rubbish of straw and paper
  that choked the gutters.</p>

  <p>She intended to drown herself. The river seemed to offer a more complete
  escape than the bottle of laudanum. She did not want Imlay to see her corpse.
  Frantic as she was, she imagined herself disappearing, body and soul, for
  ever into the Thames and being gazed at no more by any one. She greedily
  desired oblivion, to disappear beneath deep waters.</p>

  <p>Making her way through the casual crowds to the quieter streets, she
  walked, not noticing her own exhaustion, to Battersea Bridge; but here there
  were a number of people about, and she was impatient&mdash;she did not wish
  to wait until the dark fell.</p>

  <p>She went down the river steps and hired a boat. The waterman looked with
  some curiosity at the solitary woman whose expression was so strange, whose
  voice was so muffled and who stepped in the boat and rowed herself through
  the wet mist towards Putney. There she tied up the boat to some wharf steps,
  landed, and went on to Putney Bridge, the stone arches of which showed a
  glimmering grey in the thickening twilight. The fog had dissolved in a heavy
  rain that eclipsed the last murky gleams of daylight. Mary looked eagerly
  about; there was no one in sight. A few bent willows, a few bare poplars
  alone broke the monotony of the river bank; the outline of the village was
  blotted out by the shadows of the approaching night. Mary gazed down into the
  water as eagerly as one in acute physical agony will gaze at opium. It
  occurred to her that she might not at once sink&mdash;she had heard of
  women's being kept afloat by their skirts&mdash;so she walked up and down, up
  and down the bridge until her garments were completely soaked.</p>

  <p>"So," she thought, "I shall sink at once, and it will immediately be
  over."</p>

  <p>Up and down, up and down Putney Bridge in the straight rain and the
  thickening fog, hatless, cloakless, her hair like a dark stain on her brow,
  the broken mechanism of her mind racing, stopping, jolting on&mdash;stopping.
  That incredible happiness! The cornfields, the ancient woods, the cottage,
  the grapes at Neuilly, the hotel at the Barrier, those raptures of love! All
  come to this&mdash;that cruel childhood, that starved youth, those desperate
  attempts at work, at self-improvement, that frantic struggle to earn money to
  help the helpless, that glow of ambition, those glimpses of lofty
  ideals&mdash;all come to this&mdash;up and down Putney Bridge in the November
  chill and dark.</p>

  <p>She had looked on death twice, her mother dying in poverty and anguish in
  the London slum, Fanny dying in childbirth in the white Lisbon
  house&mdash;women dying of the weights of women's burdens. She had seen Eliza
  frantic with misery, she had herself passed through the pangs of childbirth.
  How foolish now seemed her poor little challenge, her "rights of woman," her
  scribblings about education, about morals.</p>

  <p>This was what life could do to a defeated woman: up and down Putney
  Bridge, alone in the city-tainted mists, in the river fog, with the rain
  beating down until her rigid face was stained by soiled drops, like
  tears.</p>

  <p>When her hair clung in wet strands to her face, when she was chilled by
  the rain, and her full skirts were so wet that they almost impeded the
  movements of her limbs, she staggered to the low parapet and climbed over
  into what she hoped would be a cessation at least of all suffering. She fell
  from the bridge, and the drab, filthy water sucked at her soaked clothes. Her
  agony was at first indescribable, being partly that of delirium and partly
  the sensation of physical choking; then she fell into that darkness, that
  peace which she had so long sought in vain.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>She revived to find herself on her own bed in her lodgings, a doctor and a
  nurse in attendance and the kind, anxious faces of friends looking at her
  beyond the bed curtains. She learnt that two boatmen, rowing through the fog,
  had seen her in the water, rescued her, taken her to the bank and done what
  they could to revive her. Gilbert Imlay had found her note, advised Mr.
  Johnson, and her friends had at once started in her pursuit. Therefore, not
  long after her attempt at suicide, she had been discovered and brought to her
  poor pretence of a home.</p>

  <p>Mary found this resurrection an unspeakable ignominy; this was what she
  termed "the insult to her poor body" that she had most dreaded. She fell into
  a fever, and as her temperature mounted, reiterated her passionate
  determination to destroy herself. She had intervals of reason, in which she
  learnt that Gilbert Imlay sent constant inquiries as to her health and peace
  of mind. Her feelings towards the inconstant lover had not changed; she
  dragged herself up in bed, demanded pen and ink and scribbled on her
  knees.</p>

  <p>"I have only to lament that, when the bitterness of death was passed, I
  was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is
  not to be baffled by disappointments, nor will I allow that to be a frantic
  attempt, which was one of the calmest acts of reason. In this respect I am
  only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, by
  other circumstances I should be dishonoured.</p>

  <p>"You say 'that you know not how to extricate ourselves out of the
  wretchedness into which we have been plunged.' You are extricated long since.
  But I forbear to comment. If I am condemned to live longer it is a living
  death...Since your new attachment is the only sacred thing in your eyes I am
  silent&mdash;Be happy. My complaints shall never damp your enjoyment. Perhaps
  I am mistaken in supposing that even my death could for more than a
  moment...I never wanted but your heart. That gone, you've nothing more to
  give, for if I had only poverty to fear I should not shrink from life. I
  write with difficulty. Probably I shall never write again to you. Adieu. God
  bless you."</p>

  <p>In this letter Mary passionately refused "as an insult" any pecuniary help
  from her faithless lover. During her illness Mary wrote several other letters
  to Imlay, some of them incoherent. She accused him of treating her
  ungenerously; she repeated that she feared neither poverty nor infamy; she
  told him she was hurt by his indirect inquiries:</p>

  <p>"...which appear to me not to be dictated by any tenderness. You ask if I
  am well or tranquil? They who think me so must want a heart to estimate my
  feelings by."</p>

  <p>She repeated again and again that she was very much mortified by Imlay's
  continual offers of money or protection; yet when he had then entirely
  withdrawn from her lodgings and taken up his residence at the establishment
  where he kept his other mistress, Mary was still capable of being wounded by
  this, and wrote:</p>

  <p>"I consider your going to the new house an open avowal that you abandon
  me."</p>

  <p>Mary's friends, fearing for her life or her reason, persuaded Imlay to
  visit her. But she was not deceived when he did so; she saw that his kindness
  was forced, that it was but a mere gloss over weariness and even disgust, and
  the very day that she had seen him she wrote:</p>

  <p>"Have but a little patience and I will remove myself where it will not be
  necessary for you to talk, and, of course, not think of me, and let me see
  written by yourself&mdash;for I will not receive it through any other
  medium&mdash;that the affair is finished. It is an insult to me to suppose
  that I could be reconciled or recover my spirits, but if you hear nothing of
  me it will be the same thing for you. Even your seeing me is to oblige other
  people and not to soothe my distracted mind."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary's tragic state had roused a good deal of sympathy and indignation
  among her friends, most of whom were still doubtful whether she was really
  Imlay's wife or not, and the young American began to feel himself in an
  awkward position. He feared a public scandal, and wished to save his face and
  his reputation.</p>

  <p>Despite everything, and incredible as it might seem, Mary was still
  clinging to the hope of being reconciled with her lover, and when, forced by
  her friends' opinion, he came to her bedside and told her that his present
  attachment was but a passing one, she at once made the suggestion that
  probably came from a clouded brain that she should share his new
  establishment with his new mistress and wait in the role of patient and
  dignified wife until his passing fancy was over. To soothe her, Gilbert Imlay
  gave some half assent to this unlikely plan, but soon after he had returned
  to his own lodgings wrote and told Mary that he considered this arrangement
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Mr. Johnson, who had always been able to wield a powerful influence over
  Mary, now took vigorous measures to persuade her that it was her duty to
  live, not only for her friends' sake, not only because she was gifted,
  talented and had much to give to the world, but for the sake of her child.
  Under this encouragement Mary recovered something of her strength, and as
  soon as she was able to leave her bed her friends moved her to another
  lodging. She was scarcely established there when she wrote to Imlay:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Johnson, having forgotten to desire you to send the things of mine
  which were left at the house, I have to request you to let Marguerite bring
  them to me. I shall go this evening to the lodgings, so you need not be
  restrained from coming here to transact your business. And, whatever I may
  think or feel, you need not fear that I shall publicly complain. No! If I
  have any criterion to judge of right or wrong, I have been most ungenerously
  treated, but wishing now only to hide myself, I shall be silent as the grave
  in which I long to forget myself. I shall protect and provide for my child. I
  only mean by this to say that you have nothing to fear from my desperation.
  Farewell."</p>

  <p>A few days after this Imlay sent back to Mary her letters to him, at least
  what he had of them&mdash;some of them had been destroyed&mdash;and with them
  was a note of farewell. This she found after some time.</p>

  <p>"The letter, without an address, which you have put up with the letters
  you returned, did not meet my eyes till just now. I have thrown the letters
  aside. I did not wish to look over a register of sorrow. My not having seen
  it will account for my having written to you with anger under the impression
  your departure, without even a line left for me, made on me, even after your
  late conduct which could not lead me to expect much attention to my
  suffering. In fact, 'the decided conduct which appears to me so unfeeling'
  has almost overturned my reason. My mind is injured. I scarcely know where I
  am or what I do. The grief I cannot conquer (for some cruel recollection
  never quits me, banishing almost every other), I labour to conceal in total
  solitude. My life therefore is but an exercise of fortitude, continually on
  the stretch and hope never gleams in this tomb. I am buried alive. I meant to
  reason with you and not to complain. You tell me that I shall judge more
  coolly of your mode of action some time hence. Is it possible that passion
  clouds your reason as much as it does mine? My affection for you is rooted in
  my heart. I know you are not what you now seem nor will you always act and
  feel as you now do, though I may never be comforted by the change. Even at
  Paris my image will haunt you, you will see my pale face, and sometimes the
  tears of anguish will drop on your heart which you have forced from mine. I
  cannot write. I thought I could quickly refute all your ingenious arguments,
  but my head is confused. Right or wrong, I am miserable...I have loved with
  my whole soul, only to discover that I have no chance of a return and that
  existence is a burden without it. I do not perfectly understand you. If by
  the offer of your friendship you will only mean pecuniary support I must
  again reject it. Trifling are the ills of poverty in the scale of my
  misfortunes. God bless you!"</p>

  <p>Mary could not leave her letter, and added:</p>

  <p>"I have been treated ungenerously as I understand what is generosity. You
  seem to me only to have been anxious to shake me off, regardless of whether
  you dashed me to atoms by the fall. In truth, I have been rudely
  handled."</p>

  <p>Though she had promised her lover to be silent about this tragic
  termination of their connection and to live in solitude, Mary was by no means
  reticent about her misfortunes, which indeed she could scarcely have
  concealed, her second attempt at suicide having been so public. Imlay,
  anxious to escape from a very disagreeable situation, took his new mistress
  to Paris in December. Mary's passion and fury had now died down; she was in a
  state of intense melancholy and thought of her lover with tenderness. She
  wrote to him in December, 1795:</p>

  <p>"Resentment, and even anger, are momentary emotions to me, and I wish to
  tell you so that if you ever think of me it may not be in the light of an
  enemy. That I have not been used well I must ever feel, perhaps not always
  with the keen anguish I do at present, for I begin even now to write calmly
  and I cannot restrain my tears. I am stunned! Your late conduct still appears
  to be a frightful dream..."</p>

  <p>Mary concluded this letter with a dignified reproach. She had said again
  and again that she would not accept money from Imlay, but she was stung by
  his lack of delicacy on this important point:</p>

  <p>"When I went to Sweden I requested you, if you could conveniently, not to
  forget my father, sisters and some others whom I was interested about. Money
  was lavished away, yet not only my requests were neglected, but trifling
  debts were not discharged and now come on me. Was this friendship or
  generosity? Will you not grant you have forgotten yourself? Still, I have an
  affection for you. God bless you."</p>

  <p>A few days later Mary wrote:</p>

  <p>"As the parting from you for ever is the most serious event in my life I
  will once more expostulate with you...You tell me 'that I torment you.' Why
  do I? Because you cannot estrange your heart entirely from me and you feel
  that justice is on my side...Even before I returned to England you took great
  pains to convince me that all my uneasiness was occasioned by the effect of a
  worn-out constitution, and you concluded your letter with these words:
  'Business alone has kept me from you. Come to any port and I will fly down to
  my two dear girls with a heart all their own.' With these assurances is it
  extraordinary that I should believe what I wished? Imlay, believe me, this is
  not romance, you have acknowledged to me feelings of this kind. You could
  restore me to life and hope and the satisfaction you would feel would amply
  repay you. Tearing myself from you it is my own heart I pierce, but the time
  will come when you will lament that you have thrown away a heart that even in
  the moment of passion you cannot despise. I would owe everything to your
  generosity, but for God's sake keep me no longer in suspense and let me see
  you once more!"</p>

  <p>Imlay's reply to this last appeal was full of harshness,
  self-justification and unfeeling reasoning. Mary then sent the last of her
  love letters:</p>

  <p>"You must do as you please with respect to the child. I could wish that it
  might be done soon that my name may be no more mentioned to you. It is now
  finished. Convinced that you have neither regard nor friendship I disdain to
  utter a reproach, though I have reason to think that the forbearance talked
  of has not been very delicate. It is, however, of no consequence. I am glad
  you are satisfied with your own conduct. I now solemnly assure you that this
  is an eternal farewell, yet I flinch not from the duties that tie me to
  life...For my part it has not been a question of words; yet your
  understanding or mine must be strangely warped, for what you term delicacy
  appears to me to be exactly the contrary. I part with you in peace."</p>

  <p>Mary had now resolved to take up her old life, and with Mr. Johnson's aid
  earn her living as a hack writer. He had encouraged her to attempt a novel,
  and she had already mapped out the design of a story that was to be bitterly
  entitled <i>The Wrongs of Woman</i>, and was to combine all the grimmest
  incidents of her own life and that of her sisters. She proceeded with this
  task, however, but languidly. She was still in a state of despair. Only her
  little girl and the support and sympathy of a few friends bound her to life.
  She was not young as her period considered youth, and her comeliness had
  largely disappeared. She retained, however, the soft charm of her manners,
  and that wistful melancholy which had always been considered so touching was
  greatly increased. Her friends and acquaintances considered her deeply
  wronged; they also still chose to consider her Imlay's wife; nor did she now
  violently contradict them.</p>

  <p>In the month following Imlay's desertion she wrote to Alexander Hamilton
  Rowan a letter that shows she was not reticent about her deep misfortune:</p>

  <p>"...I am unhappy. I have been treated unkindly, even cruelly by the person
  from whom I had every reason to expect affection. I write to you with an
  agitated hand. I cannot be more explicit. I value your good opinion and you
  know how to feel for me. I looked for something like happiness in the
  discharge of my relative duties and the heart on which I leant has pierced
  mine to the quick. I have not been well used and I live but for my child. I
  am weary of myself. I still think of settling in France because I wish to
  leave my little girl there. I have been very ill, have taken some desperate
  steps, but I am now writing for independence. I wish I had no other evil to
  complain of than the necessity of providing for myself and my child. Do not
  mistake me. Mr. Imlay will be glad to supply all my pecuniary wants, but
  unless he returns to himself I will perish first. Pardon the incoherence of
  my style. I have put off writing to you from time to time because I could not
  write calmly. Pray write to me...My heart is broken."</p>

  <p>Mary signed this letter "Mary Imlay," and the child, whom she now took
  with her everywhere, was called "Fanny Imlay." Her love story was told and
  with it all that there was to tell of joy and pleasure for Mary
  Wollstonecraft.</p>

  <p class="quote">The fool shall not enter into Heaven, be he never so holy.
  Holiness is not the price of entrance into Heaven. Those who are cast out are

  <br>
  <i>A Vision of a Last Judgment</i>.<br>
  William Blake, 1804.</p><br>

  <p class="first">AMONG the old acquaintanceships that Mary renewed when she
  languidly took up again her struggle for existence was that of William
  Godwin. The philosopher, who had been so unfavourably impressed by Mary at
  their first meeting and who had had so much fault to find with the grammar of
  her earlier works, who had disdained to read <i>A Vindication of the Rights
  of Woman</i>, was now extremely interested in the heroine of a love affair so
  dramatic and distressing as to impress even his cold heart.</p>

  <p>The philosopher was by no means averse to the company of charming women.
  He numbered the beautiful Mrs. Inchbald, the attractive Mrs. Opie and the
  delicious Mrs. Reveley among his friends, and continually, in a sober
  fashion, paid court to them, and even reflected on the chances of matrimony
  with one or the other. And matrimony it would have to be with any of these
  extremely respectable ladies, though Godwin had long preached the doctrine
  that marriage was a pernicious institution, and one that, with the Laws of
  Property, he would like to see entirely abolished. An intellectual appeal, he
  avowed, was the only one that should be considered seriously between the
  sexes. If he could have his mistress's mind, he declared, it mattered not how
  many other admirers enjoyed her person.</p>

  <p>William Godwin, however, had not found it easy to form either a platonic
  or a physical connection with any of the fair ladies who so pleased him. In
  person he was extremely unattractive; his lean face, with a profile like that
  on a Roman coin and an enormously elongated nose, had not improved with the
  years that had thinned the locks on his high forehead and bent his shoulders;
  his legs were inclined to be spindly, his garments were neglected, his
  appearance slovenly, and, worse than all, he was a boring conversationalist
  without wit, humour or warmth. His god was reason, and all his tastes were
  pedantic. He had now in the general disillusionment a little outlived the
  fame brought him by <i>Political Justice</i> (1793) and had become rather an
  accepted, slightly tiresome figure of literary London; though to some he
  remained a very great man indeed. He enjoyed doddering about from one
  drawing-room to another, and in that of Miss Hayes continually met Mrs.
  Imlay, as she was still called.</p>

  <p>Pie now liked her as much as he had formerly disliked her; her femininity,
  her delicate softness, her charm greatly appealed to the cold philosopher. He
  knew that she was utterly depressed by the desertion of a lover whom she had
  used every endeavour to retain, that she was, in sober fact, Gilbert Imlay's
  discarded mistress. This, however, by no means lowered the authoress of <i>A
  Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i> in the eyes of the rationalist
  philosopher. He considered Mary Wollstonecraft one who had gravely and
  seriously, and from the loftiest motives, put into practice her own
  principles of free love, who had made with Gilbert Imlay a sacred pact and
  was by no means degraded by the fact that he had broken it. William Godwin
  was indeed able to put a gloss of dignity and nobility over most of the
  vicissitudes of humanity. He and Mary became extremely intimate; she called
  at his house and he at hers; they exchanged ideas.</p>

  <p>The philosopher found Mary rather pessimistic, but allowed that she had
  had a bitter experience. Because of his kindness, sympathy, and because she
  was longing for company, she endured his boring expositions on philosophy and
  reason, and while her thoughts were racing to Imlay with his tawdry mistress
  in Paris, she tried to beguile herself with Godwin's encouragement and
  admiration, and his mood began to take on a tender cast.</p>

  <p>Mary was the first attractive woman that had taken any notice of the
  philosopher save coldly to accept him as a friend. His ideas, atheistical and
  anti-social, offended many, especially members of that sex who have most to
  gain from belief in the existence of a God and by adhering to rules and
  conventions. Even those ladies who were most pleased to welcome the
  philosopher in their drawing-rooms drew back from accepting his principles.
  They passed these over by affecting to consider him a little eccentric.</p>

  <p>But with Mary the case was different. If he had written against marriage,
  she had proved that she disdained that institution&mdash;or at least so it
  seemed&mdash;and Godwin could sympathise with what they decided between them
  had been a noble failure&mdash;the experiment with Imlay.</p>

  <p>It was very pleasant to the philosopher to have the personal attention of
  this famous and comely woman. Never before had he enjoyed such charming,
  intimate feminine company, and he would scarcely have enjoyed it now, at
  least not from Mary Wollstonecraft, had she not been utterly exhausted and
  depressed. The shock of the separation from Imlay had fixed her mood for the
  rest of her life&mdash;she could never know anything but resignation.</p>

  <p>When the philosopher, emboldened by her indulgence, ventured to express a
  reasoned admiration and a lofty affection, Mary encouraged him. She wanted
  company, she wanted protection, she wanted someone to help her look after
  Fanny&mdash;and the man was honest and kind, and, after a lifetime of
  celibacy, pathetically bewitched with that person and those charms that
  Gilbert Imlay had thrown aside. The forsaken woman's pride was salved by this
  masculine attention.</p>

  <p>But what persuaded Mary more than anything else to encourage Godwin's
  advances was her desperate desire for at least an imitation of that domestic
  happiness which she had promised herself with Imlay, and which, with that
  inconstant lover, she had so briefly enjoyed. Here a chance presented itself
  to her to raise once more a picture of a peaceful hearth, with herself, a
  man, a child or children about it; she saw herself shielded from the most
  desperate business and financial worries and from the neglect or scorn of her
  acquaintances.</p>

  <p>She knew that she could not pretend to succeed in filling the hideous gap
  left in her life by the departure of Imlay except by some kind of a marriage,
  by the fresh interests that such a marriage would bring, and she knew, too,
  that it would be very difficult to find a husband&mdash;and here was a man of
  sufficient reputation and presence to save her dignity by the offer of his
  affection and respect.</p>

  <p>The middle-aged bachelor, who had theorised so much and who understood so
  little of the world, really believed that this charming woman was slowly
  falling in love with him, and really conceived it possible that one so
  devastated by an overwhelming passion as Mary had been could, in a few
  months, forget the object of that passion and put another in its place, and
  he took Mary's sad acquiescence in his attentions as a proof that she was
  returning his deep affection.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, with great self-satisfaction, the philosopher thus described
  this episode in his life:</p>

  <p>"The partiality we conceived for each other was in that mode which I have
  always considered as the purest and most refined kind of love. It grew with
  equal advances in the minds of each. It would have been impossible for the
  most minute observer to have said who was before and who was after. One sex
  did not take the priority which long established custom has awarded it, nor
  the other overstep that delicacy which it so severely imposed. I am not
  conscious that either party can assume to have been the agent or the patient,
  the toil spreader or the prey in the affair. When in the course of things the
  disclosure came there was nothing in the matter for either party to disclose
  to the other. There was no period of throes and resolute explanations
  attendant upon the tale. It was friendship melting into love."</p>

  <p>Put in less lofty, high-flown language, the situation was that Mary
  allowed herself to drift, through lassitude and despair, into an acceptance
  of that second best with which so many women have had to try to content empty
  hearts. She had had some experience in the handling of masculine character;
  she knew how to persuade Godwin that she loved him truly and on the loftiest
  possible plane.</p>

  <p>Godwin, for his part, was fascinated with the prospect of the possession
  of this delightful woman especially since every other delightful woman he had
  ever known had looked askance at him.</p>

  <p>All the high talk and philosophy of this strange couple had a very
  ordinary conclusion. Mary was very jealous of her delicacy and modesty,
  Godwin had chattered and scribbled a great deal about the marriage of true
  minds and the importance of reason in all the relations of the sexes; but the
  outcome of the matter was that a few months after she had been deserted by
  Imlay, Mary was standing in the same relation to Godwin as she had stood to
  him; she had become the philosopher's mistress, though they did not live
  together.</p>

  <p>Godwin was delighted with this new relationship, and Mary endured it, even
  drawing from it a certain amount of consolation. She had told her second
  lover all her story, and even given him the packet of letters that Imlay had
  returned to her. It was pleasant for her to have this sympathetic comfort and
  to be able to describe all the episodes of her life to one who blamed her for
  nothing.</p>

  <p>She was genuinely pleased, too, for the sake of little Fanny, who had now
  a father to look after her interests; the deserted woman's pride was resigned
  and her vanity touched by the knowledge that she should be the object of the
  affection and admiration of a famous and respected man.</p>

  <p>Although William Godwin had not one of the attractions that had endeared
  Gilbert Imlay to her, she believed that she could rely on him and that his
  integrity was immaculate, and she did not allow herself the reflection that
  she could be always sure of William Godwin because no other woman wanted
  him.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Twice during this period of her life she met Gilbert Imlay, once when she
  was visiting the Christies with her child she saw him in the window seat.
  Mrs. Christie would have withdrawn her, fearing a violent scene like those
  that had taken place after her second attempt at suicide, but Mary advanced,
  holding little Fanny's hand, and greeted her former lover coolly. They
  withdrew into another room and had a short interview. The next day Imlay came
  to dine with Mary at her lodgings, then in Somers Town.</p>

  <p>Mary had not issued this invitation without a wild hope that it might be
  the prelude to a reconciliation. Imlay escaped the snare, if snare it was,
  and they parted without any promises of another meeting.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards she met him again. She was walking along the New Road
  when Imlay cantered past her. On seeing her, he pulled up his horse,
  dismounted, and, leading the animal, walked beside her for a little way. They
  talked of indifferent matters, then Imlay, with a gay salute, mounted and
  rode away. They never met again.</p>

  <p>It was at this time of her life that Robert Southey met Mary
  Wollstonecraft at William Godwin's house. Southey regarded the philosopher
  and the authoress as two of the most interesting literary celebrities of the
  moment. His impression of Mary was favourable. In March of 1797 she was still
  called Mary Imlay. Southey found that she had "infinitely the best
  countenance of any of the literary people" whom he had met; he found that her
  brown eyes, "although the lid of one of them is affected by a little
  paralysis, the most meaning I ever saw." But he fancied her expression to be
  indicative of superiority&mdash;"not haughtiness, nor sarcasm, but still it
  is unpleasant."</p>

  <p>Southey had not much good to say of Godwin. The poet found that the
  philosopher had large, noble eyes, but that his enormous nose turned his face
  into a caricature.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>After Mary had been, for about seven months, in the ambiguous position of
  Godwin's secret mistress while she allowed herself to pass for the deserted
  wife of Gilbert Imlay, she discovered that she was about to have another
  child. She then exacted a final proof of devotion from William Godwin. She
  was tired of defying the conventions; she did not wish to become a social
  outcast, or support the sneers, innuendoes, sarcasm and coarse jests of the
  general public; she was, above all, weary, and she shrunk from the
  responsibility of bringing another illegitimate child into the world. She
  therefore allowed the question of marriage to arise between her and the
  philosopher, and insensibly, with woman's tact, let him see that she wished
  to be his wife.</p>

  <p>William Godwin had publicly declaimed against marriage, and was more or
  less pledged to a considerable set of people to uphold his principles. He was
  more willing, however, to vex these followers than offend Mary. He argued,
  with a good deal of generosity, that he could not bring himself to wound
  again an already smitten heart for the sake of an abstraction, and he
  declared that he had now realised that, however objectionable the theory of
  marriage might be, in individual cases it was very necessary, and he did not
  wish Mary, after all her suffering, to endure more troubles on his behalf.
  They were, therefore, very quietly married at Old St. Pancras Church on March
  29th, 1797, Godwin's faithful friend, Marshall, and the clerk of the church
  being the only witnesses.</p>

  <p>The couple continued to live apart in their separate lodgings, and Godwin,
  in the arid, minute diary that he kept, made no mention of the ceremony that
  he affected to regard as of the least possible importance. What William
  Godwin disliked so much about marriage was what he termed
  "co-habitation"&mdash;that is, the living together of two people in one
  house, "so that there is neither peace nor privacy for either party." Mary
  was not so enamoured of her new lord that she could not endure to be for
  hours and even days together out of his sight, so she acquiesced in this
  arrangement.</p>

  <p>She gave up the tour of Italy or Switzerland that she had planned when her
  courage had revived a little after Imlay's desertion, and moving her
  furniture out of store, she took rooms in Somers Town.</p>

  <p>Godwin had an apartment in the same district, and between them, as a
  common residence, was the house called the Polygon, their joint home. Under
  this arrangement the husband and wife seldom met until the evening, and often
  did not see each other for days together, for Godwin would keep to his room,
  and Mary went about among her friends as if she were an unmarried, unattached
  woman.</p>

  <p>This was Godwin's arrangement, and one that he considered infinitely
  reasonable, and to which Mary agreed out of lassitude and indifference. But
  Godwin's sentiments were aroused; his heart as well as his head was involved
  in this strange marriage, that he disclosed on the 6th of April, 1797, and he
  accepted with equanimity the reproofs of some of his free-thinking friends.
  From the generous and devoted friend, Thomas Wedgewood, he obtained a loan of
  fifty pounds with which to extricate Mary from some of her little debts. He
  soon after asked for another loan of the same amount, and somewhat pompously
  endeavoured to explain away the seeming inconsistency of his marriage.</p>

  <p>"The doctrine of my political justice is, that an attachment that is in
  some degree permanent between two persons of opposite sexes is right, that
  marriage as practised in European countries is wrong. I still adhere to that
  opinion and nothing but a regard for the happiness of the individual, which I
  have no right to injure, would have induced me to submit to an institution
  which I wish to see abolished and which I would recommend to my fellow men
  never to practise but with the greatest caution. Having done what I thought
  necessary for the respectability of the individual I hold myself no otherwise
  bound than I was before the ceremony took place."</p>

  <p>The philosopher, who was accomplished in extorting money from his friends
  and acquaintances, added:</p>

  <p>"I can see no reason to doubt, that as we are both successful authors, we
  shall be able by our literary exertions, though with no other fortune, to
  sustain ourselves separately, or, which is more desirable, jointly. The loan
  I requested from you was rendered necessary by some complication in her
  pecuniary affairs consequent on a former connection, the particulars of which
  you have probably heard. Now that we have entered into a new mode of living,
  which will probably be permanent, I find a further supply of fifty pounds
  will enable us to start fair."</p>

  <p>Some of Godwin's friends received the news of his strange lapse from his
  own principles with disgust; others were friendly and sent warm
  congratulations.</p>

  <p>From Wood Dalling in Norfolk, where old Mrs. Godwin, the widow of the
  severe Nonconformist minister, lived, came an ill-spelt, rambling letter of
  congratulation:</p>

  <p>"Your broken resolution in regard to matrimony encourages me to hope that
  you will ere long embrace the Gospel, that sure word of promise to all
  believers, and not only you but your other half, whose souls should be both
  one...I shall be glad to see you and your wife in Norfolk if I be spared. You
  must not expect great exactness as I have a young servant and myself able to
  do nothing at all. I hope you are good walkers, for I have no horse and have
  not entered my cart so can go nowhere but to meeting with it. I have for many
  days had the cramp, I call, rather than ye rheumatism. I can't put on my own
  stockings and am obliged to stand to eat my victuals and to get up and walk
  about perhaps forty times while I write this letter. I intend sending you a
  few eggs with this in Hannah's box. Could you send a small feather bed, would
  do for the servant, by waggon, if acceptable...My dears, whatever you do, do
  not make invitations and entertainments...live comfortable with one another.
  The Hart of her husband safely trusts in her. I can give you no better advice
  than out of Proverbs, the Prophets and the New Testament&mdash;My best
  affections tend you both. From your mother, A. Godwin. I am informed Mr.
  Harwood's mother is dead. That's all I know. Your eggs will spoil soon if you
  don't pack them up in sawdust bran or something of the kind and turn them
  often. It's a pity to pay carriage for them if they don't keep."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The chief problem of the Godwins was Fanny, Imlay's gay, brown-eyed child.
  The philosopher had never contemplated a wife and family; now he had made
  himself responsible not only for Mary, but for her child. His means were
  extremely limited, and he had an extraordinary way of confusing his affairs
  that were always most intricately complicated. Mary, too, was in debt; Imlay
  left her with some of the expenses of her establishment when she was living
  with him. Even the hundred pounds borrowed from Wedgewood would not go very
  far when there were so many creditors to be kept quiet. There was still old
  Mr. Wollstonecraft wanting money, and Charles to think of; he had, after all,
  not been successful in America.</p>

  <p>The newly married man and wife therefore started in a very quiet way, and
  Mary began to miss the devoted friendship of Mr. Johnson, who had hitherto
  looked after her accounts, managed her creditors and advanced her money; she
  began to complain rather peevishly that she was left with too many tiresome
  details on her hands. Godwin was not a practical man; he could not manage his
  own affairs, much less those of his wife.</p>

  <p>There was another trouble confronting Mary. She had hoped that by her
  marriage she would achieve that respectability which hitherto she had scorned
  and be received as a decorous matron. The reverse was the case, as she might
  have foreseen. No glosses over her former connection with Imlay were now
  possible, but a few months had passed since she had lived openly with him, he
  was now in Paris with another woman, and she had married Godwin. She could
  not, therefore, ever have been Mrs. Imlay. Many doors were closed to her, and
  she found herself regarded in many quarters as a social outcast. Two famous
  ladies, whose friendship both she and Godwin highly valued, excluded her from
  their "circle," as they put it. One was Mrs. Inchbald, and the other Mrs.
  Siddons.</p>

  <p>The breach with the first lady, who was a Roman Catholic and extremely
  virtuous, took place under unpleasant circumstances. She had asked Mary and
  Godwin to share a box at a theatre with her, before they announced their
  marriage. When Godwin wrote to her that Mary was now his wife, Mrs. Inchbald
  in a cool note withdrew her invitation under the excuse that the newly
  married couple would not wish to be troubled with such ordinary amusements as
  the drama. Godwin, however, scenting a slight to Mary, insisted that they
  should be given the tickets to the box; but the evening was not a success.
  Mrs. Inchbald, though she had to appear in her capacity of hostess, contrived
  to insult Mary in a way that Godwin, who had long admired the beautiful
  sandy-haired authoress of <i>A Simple Story</i>, deeply resented.</p>

  <p>Mary received this same kind of behaviour from several of her female
  friends; her position was, indeed from every point of view, difficult. It was
  hard for her to obtain sympathy, at least from women, on the score of
  desertion, when she had so soon filled the inconstant lover's place, and it
  was difficult to justify her much vaunted principles of sex equality that on
  one occasion allowed her to be a man's mistress and on another occasion
  induced her to be a man's wife. Still, Mary affronted her difficulties and,
  falling into a half-apathetic lassitude, scribbled and read in the Polygon,
  to which abode she had now moved, went to theatres and concerts,
  superintended the education of Fanny&mdash;in which she took a deep
  interest&mdash;and mused over the coming child. She had had enough of women,
  their rights and wrongs, and it was decided that the child should be a boy,
  and named William. Living so oddly apart from her husband, she was under the
  necessity of frequently sending him little notes, that Godwin, quite new to
  this sort of coquetry, found entrancing.</p>

  <p>From the Polygon to the lodgings in Evesham Place came these little
  epistles that the philosopher thought delightful:</p>

  <p>"I am very glad you were not with me last night, for I could not rouse
  myself. To tell the truth I was unwell and out of spirits. I am better
  today."</p>

  <p>Then:</p>

  <p>"I am better this morning, but it snows so incessantly that I do not know
  how I shall be able to keep my appointment this evening. What say you? But
  you have no petticoats to dangle in the snow. Poor women, how they are beset
  with plagues, within and without."</p>

  <p>Again:</p>

  <p>"I am not well this morning. It is very tormenting to be thus, neither
  sick nor well, especially as you can scarcely imagine me indisposed. Women
  are certainly great fools, but nature made them so."</p>

  <p>Then again:</p>

  <p>"Did I not see you, friend Godwin, at the theatre last night? I thought I
  met a smile, but you went out without looking round."</p>

  <p>Before the marriage was declared, or Mary's relations with Godwin known,
  her sister Everina had stayed with her for a short while, having patched up
  some kind of a reconciliation. She still affected to believe that Mary had
  been married to Imlay. Godwin had procured her a situation in the Wedgewood
  family at Etruria. One of the family had married Miss Allen, an old friend of
  the Wollstonecrafts, but in spite of this obligation both Everina and Eliza
  took bitter offence when Mary's marriage was acknowledged, and cut off all
  connection with their unhappy sister.</p>

  <p>The little notes went on, referring to petty domestic details, to the
  cat's going mad and running up the chimney and having to be destroyed, to the
  beef for dinner, to Fanny's having too many cakes, to Mary's asking for books
  and indiarubber, for tickets for the theatre and other trivialities. Mary had
  her moods and caprices, even her outbursts of despair. After one of these
  Godwin wrote:</p>

  <p>"I am pained by the recollection of our conversation last night. The sole
  principle of conduct of which I am conscious in my behaviour to you has been
  in everything to study your happiness. I found a wounded heart, and if that
  heart casts itself on me it is my ambition to heal it. Do not let me be
  wholly disappointed, let me have the relief of seeing you this morning. If I
  do not call before you go out, call on me."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>In the summer Godwin left London with a friend, Mr. Basil Montagu. They
  intended to be away for a fortnight, and, hiring a one-horse carriage, set
  out for the Wedgewood establishment at Etruria. They were away from the 3rd
  to the 20th of June. Godwin wrote his wife long letters, mostly of the
  gossiping, traveller's-tale kind, but with inquiries after Mary's health and
  happiness that she herself termed kind and considerate. "Take care of
  yourself and take care of William," was his constant theme&mdash;William
  being his unborn child.</p>

  <p>He was to buy a little mug for Fanny, specially made for her at the
  Wedgewood potteries, and it was all very homely and agreeable, but what Mary
  would have termed "a sickly qualm" stirred her heart when she thought of
  Imlay in Paris, and realised what a sham all this so-called domestic felicity
  was: the second best can gall more than emptiness; a dull substitute for love
  is worse than loneliness. Mary wrote, however, her kind and pleasant letters,
  discussing Master William, and such details as:</p>

  <p>"My dinner is ready and it is washing day. I am putting everything in
  order for your return."</p>

  <p>Or:</p>

  <p>"I am not fatigued with solitude, yet I have not relished my solitary
  dinner. A husband is a convenient part of the furniture of a house, unless he
  is a clumsy fixture. I wish, too, from my soul to be riveted to your heart,
  but I do not desire to have you always at my elbow, though at this moment I
  should not care if you were."</p>

  <p>Then, in an outburst of gratitude to this man who had saved her from
  humiliation and torment:</p>

  <p>"You are a kind and affectionate creature. I feel it thrilling through my
  frame, giving a promising pleasure."</p>

  <p>Godwin by this time was as much in love as it was in his nature to be. He
  wrote, on the 10th June:</p>

  <p>"You cannot imagine how happy your letter made me. No creature expresses,
  because no creature feels, the tender affections as perfectly as you do, and
  after all one's philosophy it must be confessed that the knowledge that there
  is some one that takes an interest in one's happiness, something like that
  which each man feels for his own, is extremely gratifying. Tell Fanny we have
  chosen a mug for her, another for Lucas. There is an F on hers and an L on
  his shaped in an island of flowers of green, orange, and tawny alternately.
  With respect to their beauty, you will set it forth with such eloquence as
  your imagination will supply."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>At Etruria Godwin met Everina, who treated him with the greatest
  haughtiness, and even, on the first evening after his arrival, refused to
  come down and see him. Mary was not much grieved at this news; she had long
  since put both her sisters out of her life, and they continued to show a
  marked hostility to her, even declaring that her erratic behaviour made it
  very difficult for them to obtain positions in respectable households.</p>

  <p>When Godwin delayed his return, Mary became petulant. At the end of a
  letter of reproaches she wrote:</p>

  <p>"In short, your being so late to-night and a chance of your not coming
  show so little consideration that unless you suppose me to be a stick or a
  stone you must have forgot to think as well as to feel since you have been on
  the wing. I am afraid to add what I feel. Good-night."</p>

  <p>But a contrite letter from her husband and his speedy return soon effaced
  Mary's ill-humour. She repeated that he was the kindest, most reliable
  creature in the world&mdash;yes, that was it, kindness and reliability.</p>

  <p>The weary woman welcomed back the ugly philosopher with a fair pretence of
  happiness. For his part Godwin was in a sincere state of felicity. He had now
  his wife and the prospect of his child. He was very fond of little Fanny, who
  looked up to him as her father. He was the type of man that did not dislike,
  indeed rather relished, intellectual gifts in a female companion.</p>

  <p>Mary's influence had softened some of the asperity in his character; he
  began to find, and with a sense of deep satisfaction, that there was
  something after all in those intimate human relationships that hitherto he
  had regarded with the cold, slightly hostile eye of reason. He found a great
  charm in Mary's society; she could now affect, if she did not feel, gaiety,
  and she had that delicious interest in everyday things which makes the
  commonplace delightful and interesting. While with his Mary, William Godwin
  found that much that he had hitherto ignored was capable of affording the
  greatest pleasure and excitement. A modest day's trip in the country with his
  wife and Fanny was productive of great satisfaction for both of them, and
  Mary's company at a play, at a concert, at a friend's house gilded the
  entertainments for the philosopher. He could scarcely believe that in
  undertaking, partly out of principle, partly out of sentiment, the task of
  calling back to life a broken-hearted woman he had secured such extraordinary
  happiness for himself.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary was expecting her child, her William of whom she so constantly
  talked, in August. She was in good health and in what seemed to be good
  spirits. Her first confinement had been without any difficulty, and she
  expected none now. Her ideas on the subject of maternity were very modern:
  she thought that a woman should bear children as naturally as a tree bears
  apples and that most women made far too much fuss and pother on these
  occasions. She detested, too, the attendance of doctors at confinements, and
  therefore merely engaged Mrs. Blenkinsop, matron and midwife of the
  Westminster Lying-in Hospital. As her husband put it:</p>

  <p>"She was influenced by ideas of decorum which certainly ought to have no
  place, at least in cases of danger, and determined to have a woman to attend
  her in the capacity of midwife."</p>

  <p>On August 30th, 1797, this good woman took up her residence in the
  Polygon, and William Godwin, as his wife desired, retired to his lodgings in
  Evesham Buildings. No sooner had he left her&mdash;he had promised to be away
  till the child was born&mdash;than she wrote to him three little notes, all
  dated August 30th:</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt of seeing the animal today, but must wait for Mrs.
  Blenkinsop to guess the hour. I have sent for her. Pray send me the
  newspaper. I wish I had a novel or some book of sheer amusement to excite
  curiosity and while away the time. Have you anything of the kind?"</p>

  <p>A little later:</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Blenkinsop tells me that everything is in a fair way and there is no
  fear of the event being put off till another day. For the present she thinks
  I shall not be immediately free from my load. I am very well. Call before
  dinner time unless you receive another message from me."</p>

  <p>At three o'clock another letter was sent from the Polygon:</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Blenkinsop tells me I am in the most natural state that promises me
  a safe delivery, but I must have a little patience."</p>

  <p>The child was not born till nearly half-past eleven at night. The infant
  was not the eagerly expected and carefully planned-for William, but another
  girl, another Mary. When Godwin heard this news he was disappointed for his
  wife's sake, and hurried to her house. But he was not allowed to see her. She
  had requested that he should remain out of her room until she was perfectly
  recovered. The midwife assured him that his wife was doing extremely well.
  Soon afterwards, however, the state of her patient seemed to Mrs. Blenkinsop
  unnatural, and on her telling her fears to the anxious philosopher two
  doctors were sent for, one an old friend of Mary's, Dr. Fordyce, and the
  other, Dr. Poignard, from the Westminster Lying-in Hospital. These two
  physicians remained with Mary during the night. By eight o'clock in the
  morning she was supposed to be out of danger. This was a Thursday, and during
  the Friday and Saturday Mary lay in a state of lassitude that was supposed to
  be quite proper to her condition, nursing the child and taking very little
  notice of what was going on about her. The house was full of friends; the
  Fenwicks, Miss Hayes, Mrs. Reveley, Mr. Montagu were constantly calling.</p>

  <p>On Sunday she seemed so much better that Godwin, who had spent most of his
  time anxiously sitting with his friends in the parlour below her room, went
  to visit friends at Kensington and did not return until the evening. He was
  met with the news that there had been a sudden increase in Mary's illness,
  and that she had been worried to think that he was absent. She had had
  shivering fits, and Dr. Fordyce had called twice. Godwin, shocked and
  alarmed, hastened to her bedside, which he scarcely left again until she
  occupied the bed no more.</p>

  <p>Through the clumsiness and ignorance of the midwife and the limitation of
  medical skill, Mary had suffered a mischance at the birth of her child that
  now had produced internal poisoning. Her symptoms were alarming, and the two
  physicians ordered the weaning of the infant. Puppies were put to her breast
  to relieve her. Godwin, seated below, noted this in his diary
  with&mdash;Pichegru averted. Godwin had many friends, and so had Mary. These
  rallied round, and everything was done that human kindness and skill could
  suggest. A distinguished surgeon, Mr. Anthony Carlisle, came on the
  Wednesday, and remained in the bedroom at the Polygon for the hour together;
  a nurse was called in to help Mrs. Blenkinsop; Dr. Poignard visited Mary
  continually. Godwin showed the most touching devotion, the most unremitting
  tenderness and care. Mary's first bout of agony on the Sunday after her
  confinement had been so severe that she told him only the sight of his grief
  had induced her to support it. Yet even during his anguish Godwin would not
  forfeit his principles. The doctor had given his tortured wife some laudanum,
  and when she, feeling thereupon a cessation of pain, exclaimed, "Oh, Godwin,
  I am in Heaven," the philosopher answered, "You mean, my dear, that your
  physical sensations are somewhat easier."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fenwick and Miss Paine, two old and close friends, took charge of the
  sick-room, while the faithful Marshall, Basil Montagu, Mr. Fenwick and Mr.
  Dyson sat in the parlour below, waiting to be sent on errands or to do any
  service asked of them. It was a martyrdom; medical science then knew no way
  of allaying such suffering as Mary had to endure; all the doctors could do
  was to suggest to Godwin that he kept his wife constantly supplied with wine
  in view of what she had to go through before the end. On Wednesday, he noted
  in that careful diary, "Carlisle calls. Wine diet."</p>

  <p>Under these dreadful circumstances his fortitude broke down; his cold
  heart melted to tears and expostulations. He entreated her to recover, "dwelt
  with trembling fondness on every favourable circumstance." She smiled at him,
  pressed his hands and tried to reassure him as far as possible. It was
  obvious that she was deeply touched by his emotion and kindness. To please
  him she tried to sleep when begged to do so, though pain made it impossible
  for her to obtain any repose.</p>

  <p>When the nurse began to argue with her about what she should do for her
  own good, Mary's utter fatigue showed itself in the murmur: "Pray, pray, do
  not let her reason with me."</p>

  <p>Mary lay in the curtained bed through the warm September days and nights,
  apart from the subdued agitation and hushed comings and goings of a household
  always odd and casual. She was in continuous pain. When the laudanum failed
  to take effect, Godwin, obeying the doctors, gave her wine; this bemused and
  sickened her, without deadening the pain. She passed from one fainting fit to
  another, and in the intervals of sensibility she was so weak that she could
  not move head or hand. She declared that she "had never known before what
  bodily pain was."</p>

  <p>Before this torture even the thought of Imlay faded; she was not able to
  console herself with memories of that brilliant summer of the Terror, the
  baskets of grapes, the fields of waving corn&mdash;the Barrier Hotel; all her
  faculties were fixed on endurance; her shivering fits were so violent that
  her teeth chattered and the bed shook under her for five minutes together;
  she whispered to Godwin that "it was a struggle between life and death," and
  that "she had been on the point of expiring." The doctors knew that the
  symptoms were those "of a decided mortification," and they told the agonised
  husband the cause of Mary's trouble and their fading hopes.</p>

  <p>Miss Godwin had been asked to dinner, with other friends, and Mary
  breathed a request that the cloth should not be laid, as usual, in the
  parlour under her chamber, but in a distant room. She desired silence. Those
  who came in and out of her room, tiptoed; the child was with a wet nurse in a
  distant part of the house; Mary never spoke of her or of Fanny.</p>

  <p>Mr. Johnson, her truest friend, called for news. He was deeply moved by
  the waste of this brilliant woman, who might have given off so much light and
  been herself so radiant, but who had been quenched by her need for love, by
  her acceptance of maternity. Godwin tried to follow those stoic principles
  that he had always preached and until now found no difficulty in practising;
  the diary was precisely kept&mdash;who called, who slept in that house of
  watchers.</p>

  <p>In the evenings he stole from her room with the shaded candles to his
  untidy library, where the unpaid bills were thrown down with the unfinished
  work, where the pages of Mary's <i>Wrongs of Women</i> lay in the drawer with
  the bundle of her letters to Imlay and the sketch for her <i>Management of
  Infants</i>.</p>

  <p>There he would turn over the daily papers&mdash;the world was spinning
  along outside the Polygon. September 4th, when the puppies had been laid to
  Mary's breast, had seen the <i>coup d'tat</i> of the 18 Fructidor; events
  were moving towards the Battle of Camperdown, the peace of Campo Formio,
  General Bonaparte's plans for the invasion of England...The papers dropped
  from Godwin's hand. He knew mental pain, as she knew physical, for the first
  time.</p>

  <p>Mary's friend, Dr. George Fordyce, a Scots physician who held a post at
  St. Thomas's Hospital, and who had published several important medical works,
  and Mr. Anthony Carlisle, had now charge of the case, Dr. Poignard having
  left it in their hands.</p>

  <p>Godwin sat, on Wednesday, 6th Sept., for three hours holding the glasses
  of wine to Mary's lips. A servant creeping into the room with fresh linen,
  the exhausted man asked: "What do you think of your mistress?"</p>

  <p>The woman answered, "Sir, in my judgment she is going as fast as
  possible."</p>

  <p>Godwin felt question and reply to be absurd, yet they increased his
  distraction almost to madness. He entreated the faithful Basil Montagu to go
  for Mr. Carlisle. The young surgeon was then four miles out of London, dining
  at Brixton; yet, after three quarters of an hour, Montagu returned with the
  surgeon, whose presence gave Godwin more hope than he had believed it
  possible to feel. The kindness and affectionate attention of Mr. Carlisle
  deeply touched the philosopher, who felt a sentiment like adoration for the
  grave, tender figure seated patiently by the bed, "ever on the watch,
  observing every symptom and eager to improve every favourable
  appearance."</p>

  <p>In the parlour below sat Montagu, Marshall, Dyson, Fenwick, waiting "to be
  dispatched, on any errand, to any part of the metropolis, at a moment's
  warning."</p>

  <p>On the Thursday morning Mary was better; the agony was dulled, the
  convulsions had ceased; she contrived to smile, to whisper thanks to those
  grouped by her bed. Mrs. Fenwick changed her cap, wet with sweat, and folded
  the tangled red hair in clean cambric. The window was opened to admit a slant
  of autumn sun. Godwin refused to admit hope&mdash;it was, he said, "too
  mighty a thought to be trifled with."</p>

  <p>Mary, drugged with opium and alcohol, was confused in her reason. She was
  gentle, passive, and smiled at whoever approached her shadowed pillow.</p>

  <p>She did not at first, great as her suffering was, expect that she was
  going to die. She lived much longer than the doctors had expected from the
  nature of her disease, but on that Thursday Mr. Carlisle told the husband in
  the evening to prepare himself, for the fatal event might be expected any
  moment; he suggested that she should be asked if she had any directions to
  leave with regard to the two children; he added that it was merciful that she
  did not know that she was dying, for he said: "There is no more pitiable
  object than a sick man that knows he is dying."</p>

  <p>When Godwin began to ask her what her wishes were about the future of the
  children during her possible convalescence, she interrupted him by faintly
  saying: "I know what you are thinking of..." She whispered that she had
  nothing to say, and explained this by her muttered: "He is the kindest, best
  man in the world."</p>

  <p>Godwin could endure no more; he stumbled out of the room to write in his
  precise diary: "...dying in the evening."</p>

  <p>On the following day the entry was "idea of death solemn
  communication."</p>

  <p>Mary still seemed unconscious of her condition, death was not in her
  thoughts, yet "she occasionally spoke as if she expected it." Godwin noted
  that "her faculties were in too decayed a state to be able to follow any
  train of ideas with force or any accuracy of connection." Also that "during
  her whole illness, not one word of a religious cast fell from her lips." The
  God of the Dissenters of Newington Green towards whom Mary had once turned in
  desperate hopes of future ease and peace, meant nothing to her now; she had
  come to the point where her worn-out mother had been: "A little patience, and
  all will be over."</p>

  <p>On the Saturday morning, "every hope being extinct," Godwin talked to her
  again of the two little "animals," shut away in a distant room, but she only
  had to say&mdash;she trusted him.</p>

  <p>She lingered so long that Mr. Carlisle began to watch for favourable
  symptoms, remarking "that one in a million of persons in her state might
  recover." Godwin replied, "that not one person in a million had her good
  constitution of mind and body."</p>

  <p>He felt, however, that these speculations "were but the amusements of
  persons in the gulf of despair." Mr. Carlisle persuaded the philosopher at
  one o'clock to take a little rest. He stumbled down to his neglected
  room&mdash;wrote in his diary: "Sat. 9th. Talk to her of Fanny and Mary," and
  dozed in a chair until at six o'clock the sobbing servant came with a message
  from Mr. Carlisle.</p>

  <p>Godwin had asked that he might be brought yet once more to her bedside; he
  could not endure that they should tell him, "All is over." So he went slowly
  up the dark stairs of the Polygon, and into her room, shadowed and arranged
  for death. She was then almost insensible, but recognised him and tried to
  smile. He remained on his knees by her bedside for over an hour and a half,
  then his Mary died, resigning her struggle for life as she had some while
  since resigned her struggle for happiness.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The philosopher, clinging to his principles in an effort to stay his
  anguish, crept downstairs, went to his desk, and filled in the entry in his
  diary; he had never missed a day&mdash;he would not miss this. He could not,
  however, bring himself to write down that she was dead, and the only blank in
  the diary follows the date of Sunday, September 10th, 1797:</p>

  <p>"10. Su. &mdash;&mdash; 20 minutes before 8 &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
  &mdash;"</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The Stoic controlled his agony&mdash;she had shone so brightly in his life
  and for so brief a while! While they were preparing her upstairs for the
  grave, he wrote to the faithful Holcroft:</p>

  <p>"I firmly believe that there does not exist her equal in the world. I know
  from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least
  expectation that I can now ever know happiness again."</p>

  <p>The old insult in the theatre-box from Mrs. Inchbald rankled in his mind
  at this desperate moment. He wrote to her:</p>

  <p>"My wife died at eight this morning. I always thought that you used her
  ill, but I forgive you. You told me that you did not know her. You have a
  thousand good and great qualities. She had a very deep-rooted admiration for
  you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Inchbald replied, defending herself, the same day. The unhappy
  correspondence continued in five letters which concluded with Mrs. Inchbald's
  writing: "With the most sincere sympathy in all that you have
  suffered&mdash;with the most perfect forgiveness of all you have said to me,
  there must, nevertheless, be an end of our acquaintance <i>forever</i>."</p>

  <p>To another friend, Mrs. Cotton, Godwin declared: "I have half destroyed
  myself by writing."</p>

  <p>Yet with all his self-control Godwin was incapable of making the funeral
  arrangements. These were undertaken by Basil Montagu and Mr. Marshall. Mary
  Wollstonecraft Godwin was buried in the churchyard of Old St. Pancras Church,
  where she had been married a few months before.</p>

  <p>Godwin could not bring himself to attend the funeral. On the Friday
  morning that she was being buried he shut himself up in Marshall's house and
  scribbled desperately to his friends, pouring his feelings, roused at last,
  out on paper. He had already written sternly to Mr. Tuthill, the atheist, who
  did not feel that he could attend a Christian funeral. He now wrote to Mr.
  Carlisle:</p>

  <p>"My dear Carlisle&mdash;I am here, sitting alone in Mr. Marshall's
  lodgings during my wife's funeral. My mind is extremely sunk and languid. But
  I husband my thoughts and shall do very well...one of my wife's books now
  lies near me, but I avoid opening it..."</p>

  <p>Miss Hayes sent the news to Hugh Skeys, who was not, perhaps, very much
  interested; it was some years since his Fanny had been laid in her Lisbon
  grave. Mrs. Fenwick, "the authoress of <i>Secrecy</i> and the best nurse that
  Mr. Anthony Carlisle ever saw," wrote to the estranged Everina:</p>

  <p>"I am a stranger to you, Miss Wollstonecraft, and at present greatly
  enfeebled both in mind and body; but when Mr. Godwin desired that I should
  inform you of the death of his most beloved and most excellent wife I was
  willing to undertake the task because it is some consolation to render him
  the slightest service and because my thoughts perpetually dwell upon her
  virtues and her loss. Mr. Godwin himself cannot upon this occasion write to
  you. Mrs. Godwin died on Sunday, September 10th, about eight in the morning.
  I was with her at the time of her delivery and with very little intermission
  until the moment of her death. Every skilful effort that medical science of
  the highest class could make was exerted to save her. It is not possible to
  describe the unremitting and devoted attentions of her husband. Nor is it
  easy to give you an adequate idea of the affectionate zeal of many of her
  friends, who were on the watch day and night to seize on an opportunity of
  contributing towards her recovery and to lessen her sufferings. No woman was
  ever more happy in marriage than Mrs. Godwin; whoever endured more anguish
  than Mr. Godwin endured? Her description of him in the very last moment of
  her recollection was 'He is the kindest, best man in the world.' I know of no
  consolation for myself but remembering how happy she lately had been and how
  much she was admired, almost idolised, by some of the most eminent and best
  of human beings. The children are both well, the infant in particular. It is
  the finest baby I ever saw&mdash;Wishing you peace and prosperity, I remain
  your humble servant, Eliza Fenwick.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Godwin requests that you will make Mrs. Bishop acquainted with this
  afflicting event. He tells me that Mrs. Godwin entertained a sincere and
  earnest affection for Mrs. Bishop."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary's friends and acquaintances were shocked and startled when they heard
  of her death, which at this juncture had been entirely unexpected; she had
  seemed, as Mrs. Inchbald wrote, in such brilliant vigour of mind and
  body.</p>

  <p>Henry Fuseli, the object of her first tremblings of passion, who had dined
  once or twice at her table when she was Mrs. Godwin and who had lately
  regarded her kindly, though with a touch of that contempt some men feel for a
  woman who has been deserted by another man and sunk beneath the event, made a
  brief comment on her tragedy. After sending the news to a friend, he added:
  "Poor Mary."</p>

  <br>
  <i>Songs of Experience</i>.<br>
  William Blake, 1794.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IN the summer of 1814 a fair girl waited beneath a luxuriant
  willow tree that shook tresses of narrow leaves over a stone
  inscribed:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin<br>
  Author of<br>
  A Vindication of the Rights of Woman<br>
  Born XVII April, MDCCLIX&lt;&lt;br&gt; Died X September, MDCCXCVII</p><br>

  <p>The slight, sensitive creature in the mended gown and worn slippers bore
  the same name. The tracing of light over her fine features, delicate locks of
  pale hair and thin white dress, made her look like some sylph hovering above
  the grave where passion lay buried and re-risen was transformed into ethereal
  loveliness.</p>

  <p>This was the child for whom Mary had died, daughter of a cold philosopher
  and a heart-broken woman. Her thoughts were all of love, and all the feminine
  rights she cared about were freedom in this love.</p>

  <p>The graveyard of Old St. Pancras Church was full in the brightness of the
  setting sun that glittered on the windows of the squat grey building and
  softened the cold outlines of the tombs. A breeze, sweet from neighbouring
  hayfields, stirred the shadows of the willow boughs over the thick, daisied
  grass. On Mary's grave lay her daughter's books and satchel, a straw hat and
  a shawl.</p>

  <p>The philosopher had married again, a few years after his Mary's death, and
  his daughter detested her stepmother, who tried to keep her to the sordid
  drudgery of the wretched household. The second Mary knew as much about
  poverty, the shifts and intrigues of genteel insolvency, the harshness of
  creditors, the difficulty of raising loans as ever her mother had experienced
  at her age. This grave was her refuge; on these tufts of grass, in this
  swaying shade, she retreated into those day dreams that were her refuge from
  a harsh reality, and pondered over the books that Mrs. Godwin, ill-tempered
  and harassed, forbade her to read at home, while there were dishes to be
  washed or clothes to be patched.</p>

  <p>Mary Godwin adored the memory of her mother, of whom she had heard nothing
  but what pleased her, and now, with the utmost tenderness, she bent, and with
  a caressing finger traced the name on the stone; then she peered through the
  willow tresses, drew them apart and shyly calling, "Shelley!" sped down the
  grassy slopes where another creature, as bright and fine as herself, was
  coming eagerly towards her. They embraced in the solitude of the flowering
  grasses, among the graves, then the girl flew back to where her mother's tomb
  glimmered in the willow shade, snatched up her belongings and returned to her
  lover. At the lich-gate Jane Clairmont, her half-sister, was waiting for
  them. The three stole away together, and the grave of Mary Wollstonecraft
  remained solitary in the intolerable loneliness of an English summer
  afternoon.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Mary was away with her lover, and Jane, the half-brothers, Charles
  Clairmont and William Godwin, had found some intermittent work and some
  desultory interests, Fanny remained at home to help in the long struggle with
  genteel poverty; she was now the only one to visit the willow-shaded
  grave.</p>

  <p>This was Gilbert Imlay's daughter, the "barrier girl," child of those
  hours of secret joy and passion, spent in the shuttered room of the discreet
  little hotel overlooking the sunny boulevard planted with noble trees and
  parterres of flowers, this was "my little animal," whom Mary had suckled,
  given crusts to, fondled and wept over, in whose face she had seen a likeness
  to her faithless lover.</p>

  <p>For Fanny Mary had resolved to live, for Fanny she had planned manuals of
  education, for Fanny she had begun a little handbook in order that the baby
  might learn to read on a new system; these lessons were inscribed: "The first
  book of a series which I intended to have written for my unfortunate girl,"
  and written in October, 1795. "Come to me, my little girl. Are you tired of
  playing? Yes. Sit down and rest yourself while I talk to you..."</p>

  <p>Fanny had read over the little volume of her mother's posthumous works
  that contained these sad scraps of advice intended for her, but Godwin's
  memoir of his wife had been kept from her; she believed that the name under
  which she passed&mdash;Godwin&mdash;was her own.</p>

  <p>Fanny was gentle, lovable, pleasant to look at, vivacious in conversation
  and a neat housewife. Godwin had done his best by her, and had in every way
  treated her as if she had been his own daughter. But to say this is not to
  say much; the philosopher's house in Skinner Street was a wretched place, and
  Fanny was well used not only to the grind of sordid penury, but to the
  constant bitterness of family quarrels, and to the rule of Mrs. Godwin, "whom
  I cannot like," as she wrote to Mary.</p>

  <p>Now Mary and Jane had escaped, Mary with Shelley, Jane to Italy, and an
  amorous interlude with the brilliant Byron. Only Fanny remained among the
  dreary shifts of Skinner Street, to toil without relief or pleasure, to
  listen to Godwin's platitudes that time had made a little querulous, to Mrs.
  Godwin's quick railings.</p>

  <p>In the September of 1816 Fanny saw much of her maternal aunts, Everina
  Wollstonecraft and Eliza Bishop, who had a little school in Ireland, founded
  not without help from their sister's friends and money.</p>

  <p>Fanny hoped to join them. They invited her for a visit, but put obstacles
  in the way of her becoming a teacher in their establishment. A few trivial
  questions from the girl, and the embittered women told her what these
  obstacles were; Fanny learnt that she was not Godwin's daughter, but the
  illegitimate child of Gilbert Imlay, of whom no one had heard anything for
  twenty years; she learnt, too, how the philosopher's affairs looked to the
  orthodox world.</p>

  <p>The delicate romantic poet who was living with Mary was married and had
  children by his wife; Mary, already a mother, was to him what her mother had
  been to Gilbert Imlay. Jane Clairmont's company had but added to the scandal
  of her elopement. Godwin was heavily in debt to Shelley, and though he
  profoundly disapproved of his daughter's behaviour, continued to importune
  him for money.</p>

  <p>The brutal version of the story current in literary London was that the
  stony-hearted philosopher had sold the two girls to the eccentric young
  libertine for seven hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>Then Jane&mdash;Clare, as she called herself&mdash;had shamelessly forced
  sufficient attention from the cynical, notorious Lord Byron for her, too, to
  be burdened with a base born child. Everina and Eliza were vehement in their
  condemnation of these disgraceful results of an atheistical, radical
  training&mdash;the rights of woman! The two ageing schoolmistresses could see
  nothing in this type of feminine freedom but the licence claimed by the
  street walker.</p>

  <p>They declared that it was very difficult for them, with such connections,
  to find pupils; the names of Godwin and Wollstonecraft stank in the nostrils
  of the respectable. Fanny was no doubt a good girl, but she could be only a
  brief, smuggled visitor in her aunts' school.</p>

  <p>Gilbert Imlay's daughter returned to the drab monotony of Skinner Street
  in deep despondency; she was given to fits of melancholy, and now she felt
  tainted, set apart, despised.</p>

  <p>She was really alone. Her father had never inquired after her. She was
  dependent on the charity of the harassed philosopher, an unpaid servant in
  the miserable household. She escaped, as Mary had escaped before her, to the
  willow-shaded grave and pondered over the rights of women, over love and over
  her mother's two attempts at suicide of which she had lately learnt; she was
  lonely without the two other girls, and she had been dazzled by the radiance
  of Shelley&mdash;all gone!</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>Fanny visited Mary's grave for the last time on October 7th, 1816. She was
  about to leave London to join her aunts in Pembrokeshire, where they still
  had a little property. She was to cross to Ireland with them by Bristol.</p>

  <p>It was a cool, yet gold-powdered day&mdash;like those of twenty-two years
  before, when Mary Wollstonecraft had gone out along the dusty Neuilly road, a
  basket of grapes in her hand, to welcome her lover. The willow leaves were
  golden, too; Fanny stripped some of them off the fine boughs and cast them,
  like a golden coronal, on her mother's grave.</p>

  <p>Then Fanny returned home to fetch her luggage. On the way she visited a
  chemist's shop. On the 10th of October she was at Bristol. From there she
  wrote to Mary, then at Bath, a sad, distracted letter that sent Shelley to
  meet her. But she had continued her journey; the poet missed her and returned
  to Bath.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday night Fanny arrived at the Mackworth Arms, Swansea, by the
  Cambrian coach. She asked for a room and a cup of tea, and went early
  upstairs. She told the chambermaid that she was very much fatigued and would
  put out her own candle.</p>

  <p>Her appearance was noted as being very genteel. She wore a blue striped
  skirt with a white bodice under a brown pelisse, this, like her brown beaver
  hat, was lined with white silk. She wore a little necklace of brown berries,
  she had her long, hazel-coloured hair arranged in curls, her complexion was
  warm, her eyes dark. As she did not appear in the morning, her locked door
  was forced. She was stretched on the floor, by the untouched bed, fully
  dressed save for her hat. Nothing was found on her body but a small French
  gold watch, a reticule containing a red silk handkerchief and a clasped purse
  that contained a 3/- and a 5/6 piece. On the table was a bottle of laudanum
  and this letter:</p>

  <p>"I have long determined that the best thing I could do was to put an end
  to the existence of a being whose birth was unfortunate and whose life has
  only been a series of pain to those persons who have hurt their health in
  endeavouring to promote her welfare. Perhaps to hear of my death will give
  you pain, but you will soon have the blessing of forgetting that such a
  creature ever existed as X X X."</p>

  <p>The name had been written, then torn off and burnt at the candle. How was
  she to sign herself? She was neither registered nor baptised anywhere. "My
  poor animal" was nameless.</p>

  <p>On Oct. 19th an inquest was held on "the wretched object," as the
  <i>Cambrian</i> termed Fanny, and the verdict was: "Found dead."</p>

  <p>No one had come forward to claim Fanny's body that remained unidentified.
  A "G" had been found on her hose and "M.W." on her stays, but the Swansea
  authorities could not trace her relatives.</p>

  <p>These kept themselves carefully concealed; Shelley had gone again to
  Bristol, satisfied himself who the suicide was and had returned to Bath
  without disclosing himself; Mary bought mourning and told Godwin the news.
  The philosopher went secretly to Swansea, learnt the truth and returned to
  London secretly; his one anxiety was that yet another scandal should not
  attach to his name; he concealed the tragedy from everyone, and the
  love-child of Mary Wollstonecraft and Gilbert Imlay was buried, as an
  "unknown female," in a pauper's grave.</p>

  <p>She was supposed to have gone to Ireland and for months Godwin hid her
  suicide, gradually and vaguely allowing it to be supposed that she had died
  of typhus in Ireland.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>A month after Fanny drank the laudanum in her hired room, Harriet Shelley
  drowned herself in the Serpentine, and Mary Wollstonecraft's younger
  daughter, to the great satisfaction of the philosopher, was married to Percy
  Bysshe Shelley, on Dec. 30th, 1816, at St. Mildred's Church, Bread Street;
  she had been living with him for nearly five years, but Godwin announced the
  marriage to his brother, Hall, with pride; after saying that his "tall girl"
  was married, he added: "her husband is the eldest son of Sir Timothy Shelley,
  of Field Place, in the County of Sussex, Baronet...you will wonder, I
  daresay, how a girl without a penny of fortune should meet with so good a
  match. But such are the ups and downs of this world. For my part, I care but
  little, comparatively, about wealth, so that it should be her destiny in life
  to be respectable, virtuous and contented...I have to thank you this
  Christmas for a ham and a turkey, which, exclusive of their intrinsic value,
  gave me much satisfaction as marks of your remembrance."</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>So Mary went to Italy, to her six years of marriage and her long
  widowhood, and Fanny mouldered in Welsh earth, wearing her necklet of berries
  and her blue striped dress, and the coroner had for his fee the little French
  watch that Gilbert Imlay had given Mary Wollstonecraft a generation before
  and the bare willow tree cast wintry drops on the neglected grave of the
  author of <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i>.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>AUTHOR'S NOTES</h2>

  <p class="first">WILLIAM GODWIN was buried beside his first wife in 1836. The
  Midland Railway Co., bought the old Church of Saint Pancras and demolished
  it, erecting in place of it a tasteless, gloomy pile by Sir John Soane; the
  ancient graveyard was turned into a pleasure garden that the railway passed
  through, then built over.</p>

  <p>Sir Percy Shelley removed in 1851 the bodies of his grandparents to
  Bournemouth where they rest beside that of Mary Shelley who died that same
  year.</p>

  <p>Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin was much abused after her death and brutally
  handled by the considerable number of writers who discussed her work and life
  in public prints; she paid to the full the penalty of having broken the
  rules. In order to clear away the calumnies that clustered round her memory,
  Godwin wrote his short life of his wife. This did not mend the matter;
  Godwin's lofty view of his Mary's conduct was considered heartless and
  indecent and many people found it shocking that the bereaved husband
  should&mdash;and with zest&mdash;print the story of his dead wife's illicit
  connection with another man then living, and publish the love letters that
  revealed a woman's passion and despair. Godwin's scrupulous attitude of
  impartiality towards Imlay made his conduct, to the sensitive and romantic,
  appear disgusting, and it was considered one of Mary's worst misfortunes that
  she was mourned by "Godwin with a heart of stone."</p>

  <p>It may be doubted whether what Mary termed "a register of
  sorrow"&mdash;her letters to her lover&mdash;were ever intended by her for
  publication; she had destroyed all those that she had received from Imlay, so
  the tale revealed in her letters is one-sided at best. Gilbert Imlay had at
  least the dignity of silence; it is not difficult to imagine his opinion of
  the tact and taste of publishing what was indeed his concern and his
  property; though Godwin suppressed some of the passages.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that Godwin came into possession of the frantic letters
  written before Mary's second attempt at suicide, and those sent to Imlay
  during her following illness. Imlay must have returned these to his forsaken
  mistress, and she have kept them; it might have been thought that either one
  or the other would have destroyed these sad documents.</p>

  <p>Godwin thought highly of the literary value of these love letters that he
  considered bore "a striking resemblance to the celebrated romance of
  Werther," he found them&mdash;what they decidedly are not&mdash;"the
  offspring of a glowing imagination," and declared that they were "superior to
  the fiction of Goethe." It is notable that, at that date, very few
  collections of love letters had been published; the correspondence of
  Dorothea Sophia of Zell and Philip von Koenigsmarck, of William Temple and
  Dorothy Osborne, of Julie de Lespinasse still lay locked away in archives or
  private chests. Godwin's life of his wife, though much less formal and
  stilted than his more ponderous works, is dry, cold and meagre as to facts;
  his description of his affection&mdash;"I never loved before" and so on,
  seems artificial and his misunderstanding of Mary, his complacency in
  thinking that "this heart withered by despair" could have soon conceived a
  steady passion for himself, is pathetic in its futility.</p>

  <p>Only when he comes to describe Mary's death is he moving, and even there
  he leaves out almost all of those details that would have made his account
  vivid.</p>

  <p>The philosopher was not inconsolable; even while preparing Mary's literary
  remains for the press, he was wooing Harriet Lee, a severe lady novelist of
  orthodox views, who kept a school at Bath; after a long correspondence with
  Miss Lee and a very decided refusal from her, Godwin proposed to Mrs.
  Reveley, then recently widowed, to whom he addressed various passionate and
  didactic letters; but Mrs. Reveley married Mr. Gisborne and Godwin fell to
  the bold advances of Mrs. Clairmont, who made his acquaintance by
  exclaiming&mdash;"Is it possible that I behold the immortal Godwin?"</p>

  <p>They were married in 1801 and the second Mrs. Godwin survived her
  husband.</p>

  <p>Jane Clairmont, "Clare," died in 1879.</p>

  <h3>* * *</h3>

  <p>The bibliography given after these notes shows the source of the bulk of
  the materials used in this study of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin; it should be
  explained that, the form of a connected narrative having been adopted, some
  suppositions have been used where certainties were unprocurable, so as not to
  embarrass the story with <i>pro</i> and <i>contra</i> on small points.</p>

  <p>It is not, for instance, positively known that Gilbert Imlay was a timber
  merchant, only assumed that he must have been, nor absolutely certain how
  Mary first attempted to destroy herself; such details make no difference to
  the characters or actions of the persons dealt with, and where these little
  puzzles or difficulties have arisen they have been dealt with by the adoption
  of the most likely solution.</p>

  <p>The study is not, however, "a romantic biography;" every care has been
  taken to ensure an accuracy not seriously impaired by filling in the gaps
  where some minute particulars are missing from the records. On any doubtful
  point the interested reader may consult easily available authorities.</p>

  <p>There is one episode in Mary Wollstonecraft's story the treatment of which
  requires explanation. Both John Knowles and William Godwin declare her to
  have felt a passion for Henry Fuseli that she honourably suppressed.</p>

  <p>Her subsequent biographers, Mr. Kegan Paul and Mrs. Pennell, indignantly
  declare these statements to be false and that Mary had no more than a cool
  friendship for the painter.</p>

  <p>Knowles was Fuseli's executor and had access to his papers, among which
  were found several of Mary's letters; Knowles quotes fragments of these and
  one&mdash;the last&mdash;in entirety. These certainly confirm his story; he
  was a witness of the friendship, as was Godwin, who relates it coolly as a
  thing well known. Mrs. Pennell and Mr. Kegan Paul have nothing to oppose to
  this contemporary evidence but their faith in the nobility of their heroine
  and the fact that she retained the friendship of Mrs. Fuseli.</p>

  <p>The first argument is useless; Mary when she met Fuseli was restless,
  unhappy, looking for love, eager for self-surrender, as her subsequent
  easiness with Imlay shows, and the painter was very attractive to women; our
  knowledge of human nature and of Mary&mdash;her age, circumstances and
  temperament&mdash;all serve to confirm the truth of the story as given by
  Knowles and Godwin.</p>

  <p>As to Mrs. Fuseli&mdash;Mary lived so short a while after this
  incident&mdash;was abroad for most of this time and deeply implicated with
  other men for the rest, that Sophia Fuseli may easily have been tolerant. She
  and Fuseli were both alive when Godwin wrote his account of the business and
  neither contradicted it. Mrs. Fuseli survived to see Knowles' book published
  and still made no protest; it is possible that she gave Mary's letters to
  Fuseli's executor.</p>

  <p>After weighing the above considerations the present author decided to
  follow Knowles and Godwin rather than Mrs. Pennell and Mr. Kegan Paul.</p>

  <p>There is one other small point; Godwin declares that, after her second
  attempt at suicide, Mary offered to live with Imlay and his new mistress.
  Mrs. Pennell dismisses this statement as quite incredible; to her Mary's
  frenzy of jealousy would have made such a proposal on her part impossible. To
  the present writer this is not so; a woman in the state in which Mary then
  was is capable of the wildest expedients to keep her lover, and the same
  despair that prompted the attempt at suicide might easily have prompted an
  even greater humiliation.</p>

  <p>Besides, Godwin is scarcely likely to have invented such a story; he was
  probably relating something well known to Mary's circle.</p>

  <p>For these reasons Godwin's statement has been used in the present
  narrative; the point of view of Mary Wollstonecraft's Victorian admirers is
  so lofty that it must be suspected of being a little in the clouds.</p>

  <p class="first">THE last book&mdash;a collection of all the papers that
  William Godwin found among his wife's possessions&mdash;was by him edited; it
  contained the <i>Letters to Imlay</i> that M. Kegan Paul republished with a
  memoir of the writer: <i>Letters to Imlay</i>, <i>edited C</i>, <i>Kegan
  Paid</i>. <i>1879</i>, <i>London</i>. This collection also contains the
  fragmentary novel&mdash;in parts no more than a draft&mdash;<i>The Wrongs of
  Woman, or Maria</i>, that Mary Godwin was engaged upon shortly before her
  death. The other scraps so piously garnered by the devoted widower are of
  little value.</p>

  <p>Save for the <i>Letters to Imlay</i> none of this material appears to have
  been ever reprinted; the early novel <i>Mary</i> was published, but every
  copy seems to have been lost.</p>

  <p>All Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin's works were published by her loyal friend,
  Joseph Johnson, who also printed her husband's biography. The publisher's
  imprint on the <i>Posthumous Works</i> reads: London, printed for J. Johnson,
  No. 72, St. Paul's Churchyard; and G. G. and J. Robinson, Paternoster Row,
  1798.</p>

  <p>The author is indebted to Mr. Osbert Burdett's <i>William Blake</i> for
  the quotations used from the works of that poet.</p>
