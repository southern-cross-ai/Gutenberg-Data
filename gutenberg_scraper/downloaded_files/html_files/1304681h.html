  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; AN ALIEN PRESENCE MOVES?</h2>

  <p class="first">TINY in the great four-poster bed, Rose Lynn sat bolt
  upright and hugged her knees to firm, round breasts. She stared into
  wavering, uncertain shadows magnifying the expanse of the spacious
  bedchamber, and in the sea-tinted depths of her wide eyes dread lurked. The
  heavy coverlet under which she cringed could not shut out the chill of fear
  shaking her with the faintest of tremors. Her red lips quivered to shallow,
  affrighted breathing.</p>

  <p>A sound had mingled with the first flash of her startled awakening. A
  swift patter of wee footsteps rattling into stillness. Such a small patter as
  a child might have made, scampering down the long, dark corridor outside. A
  child? In this gloomy structure which no child had entered for forty years?
  What then? What could possibly have fumbled at her door and whisked away with
  an eerie glee in the tap-tap-tap of its retreat, a mischievousness strangely
  sinister?</p>

  <p>Rose's eyes ached, and the manifold small noises of the country night were
  an ominous silence to her straining ears. She heard the sough of wind through
  foliage, the shrill of nocturnal insects, the distant, melancholy wail of a
  train. And within the house there was only the crackle of drying beams and
  the rattle of ancient plaster dribbling inside the walls.</p>

  <p>The girl's lips twisted. "I dreamed it," she whispered. "It was only a
  dream. I ought to forget it and go to sleep." If she slid down under the
  blankets and forced herself to sleep, in the morning black Isaiah would rap
  on her door as always and mumble his toothless, "Seben o'clock, missie, an'
  b'eakfas' am ready." She would laugh at her scare then, when the sunshine
  streamed through the mullioned window, and she would tell Miss Wayne about
  it, and perhaps the dear old lady would pat her hand with her own fragile,
  almost transparent fingers, and say, "My dear. This gloomy house is no place
  for your fresh youth; it is cruel of me to keep you here."</p>

  <p>"Cruel!" Rose forced herself to continue the imagined talk, seeking thus
  to win her mind from the terror that numbed it. "What would I do if I didn't
  have this job? I'd starve. And besides, you have been so sweet and kind I
  feel more like a niece than a paid companion. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her fingers tightened on the quilt edge. From somewhere beyond the closed
  mystery of her door, an eerie laugh had sounded&mdash;distant, but
  high-pitched like a child's! The stillness quenched it at once, but a pulse
  beat in the girl's temple now with a dull thumping, and her mouth was dry.
  Someone stirred in the sleeping house, some alien presence moved.</p>

  <p>Who could it be? Was Loretta Wayne, prim, aristocratic spinstress,
  trotting her spindly shanks about on some midnight adventure? Despite her
  unease the corners of Rose's eyes crinkled with fugitive humor at the whimsy.
  Or was it Loretta's brother, Roger Wayne&mdash;tall, austere, black hair
  silvered at the temples above the chiseled dignity of his patrician
  countenance? Incredible! But there was no one else in the desolate, crumbling
  mansion. There <i>should</i> be no one else.</p>

  <p>The girl's head jerked. There were the pattering footfalls
  again&mdash;fainter now and farther off, but distinct as the tick of the
  watch under her pillow. Her throat cords tautened to a scream. She gulped it
  down, remembering the waxen pallor of her mistress' skin that told of a heart
  all too fragile. A sudden fright...</p>

  <p>Oh, why didn't that scampering stop? It was the patter of leaves blown
  against a window-pane, of pebbles rattling on the roof. It was nothing,
  nothing at all. <i>That creak!</i>&mdash;? That was a step on the staircase
  at the end of the hall, the third step from the top. No doubt now. No doubt
  at all that some alien presence was in the house, that someone was on those
  stairs.</p>

  <p>Rose could not ignore this thing, yet she dared not call for help. Her
  lips tightened. She slid from the bed, stood swaying, nerving herself, while
  moonlight silhouetted the clean lines of her young body through the sheerness
  of her nightdress. She whimpered, fisted small hands, moved. Even the whisper
  of her bare feet on worn carpeting was somehow a sibilant warning of
  menace...</p>

  <p>She got to the door, got through. The knob was pulled from her stiff
  fingers by a sudden puff of cold air. The door thudded shut, and blackness
  engulfed Rose, impenetrable dark. Her nostrils clogged with the mustiness of
  the ancient corridor through which trailed elusive wisps of fragrance, of
  scent and powder and vanished flowers of a long ago when once the moribund
  mansion was aglow with gayety and light laughter.</p>

  <p>She stood taut, poised, listening for a repetition of the noises that had
  brought her out of sleep to fear. Momentarily the silence was absolute. Then
  her veins were a network of ice and her scalp was a tight cap squeezing her
  skull.</p>

  <p>The stillness had been broken, not by the patter of small feet that she
  had heard before, but by a voice. A thin, thread-like voice prattling
  unintelligibly, somewhere in the dark. A babbling voice curiously infantile,
  lisping the monologue of a child at solitary play. An endearing sound in a
  sun-filled nursery&mdash;but a sound fraught with marrow-melting horror in
  the midnight murk of this moldering mansion. A sound that struck all power to
  move from the listening girl's limbs and froze her to nightmare rigidity that
  wrenched a moan from her tight throat...</p>

  <p>The pattering recommenced; the third stair creaked again, and little feet
  scampered toward her through the hall's lightlessness! Rose's brain flashed a
  frantic message to unresponsive muscles, and something thudded against her
  knees, toppling her. As she fell her outflung arm brushed a face in the dark,
  a damp and coldly clammy face not two feet from the floor! Hands were on her
  cheek, her breast. Hot hands stroked down her side. Hands hot and harsh
  through the gossamer silk wrung a scream from her.</p>

  <p>Somewhere a door slammed. "What is it?" Loretta Wayne shrilled.
  "Rose!"</p>

  <p>Then the hands were gone, and the shaggy body that had pressed close to
  hers where she had fallen was gone. From somewhere nearby Roger Wayne said,
  "All right, Loretta. I'll see to it." His tones were measured, calm, as
  always. "Don't excite yourself."</p>

  <p>The dark swirled about Rose. She fought to hold it steady as Wayne's
  solicitude recalled to her his sister's weakness, and she managed to call
  out, "A dream, Miss Wayne. I had a nightmare." Then everything slid into
  swirling blackness that seemed to lift her in strong arms...</p>

  <p>She lay on her bed once more, the blankets warm about her. A lamp's soft
  yellow centered its nimbus about the chest of drawers and edged Roger Wayne's
  ascetic profile with a line of light. In all the sudden alarm he
  characteristically had contrived to don a dark dressing-gown buttoning close
  to his neck, and it gave him the appearance of a medieval monk. But a brother
  of a fighting order&mdash;for his stiff, ramrod erectness, never relaxed, was
  that of a soldier trained for years.</p>

  <p>"Oh," Rose gasped. "I must have fainted."</p>

  <p>The man's thin lips moved in a slow smile. "You did, my dear. Fainted dead
  away. I had to carry you in here. The hall was draughty, and we cannot afford
  to have you taking cold."</p>

  <p>The commingling of grave courtesy and kindliness in his tone was typical
  of the fortnight since she had come here. In the crumbling decay of the
  ancient mansion Roger Wayne maintained, somehow pathetically, the courtliness
  of more spacious days. He was an aristocrat, and neither the loss of fortune
  nor the mark of time could change his ways.</p>

  <p>"It was awfully silly of me to faint." The words slid from Rose's cold
  lips, and she looked up at his looming figure, his shadowed countenance,
  waiting for the inevitable question as to what had brought that scream of
  terror from her and robbed her of consciousness. It did not come. Wayne stood
  there, silent and grave, and in his eyes there brooded a troubled murkiness,
  the faint hint of some hidden pain. Tonight it was more alive, more definite
  than it had ever been.</p>

  <p>At last he said, "You can sleep now." That was all. "Sleep?"</p>

  <p>He turned away. His slender, blue-veined hand picked up the lamp, and
  suddenly the light was gone. Protest vibrated in the girl's throat, but
  before she could voice it the man was gone, the door shut behind him. She was
  alone with the silver spray of moonlight in the dim room, and the shuddersome
  recollection of burning, avid hands desecrating her body, of the embrace of a
  malformed, horribly small frame against hers. Fear clutched her.</p>

  <p>The fear seeped away; for the <i>thump, thump</i> of Roger Wayne's stiff
  walk had not faded but continued in a measured pacing just outside her door.
  <i>Thump, thump, thump.</i> Back and forth. Back and forth. He had told her
  to sleep, but there would be no sleep for him tonight. <i>Thump. Thump.
  Thump.</i> He was mounting sentry-go, guarding her against the unacknowledged
  horror that stalked his house.</p>

  <p>In the morning there was nothing at all to remind Rose of her terror in
  the night, nothing in her great sunny room, nor in the long, door-walled
  corridor, nor in the crisp, white breakfast table set in the wide embrasure
  of a light-filled window. Nothing&mdash;save Roger Wayne's red-rimmed,
  sleepless eyes, opposite her, and the covert, almost desperate appeal in them
  for her silence. When she took Loretta's tray upstairs she saw the same
  appeal in the little old lady's birdlike face, grey against the pillow, and
  the same avoidance of any reference to what must have been foremost in all
  their thoughts.</p>

  <p>What was it? What secret did the house conceal that had sapped its
  vitality, that had withdrawn these two from the world and laid upon them a
  pall of dread? Once more Rose's brain tightened with uneasy fear as she
  sensed a conspiracy of silence about her, a cabal in which even the bent old
  Isaiah was included. That which they hid from her was evil, they knew that it
  was evil and that its menace was now directed against her. Wayne's sentry-go
  last night was evidence of that. But they dared not warn her of its nature.
  They would only try to protect her from it, to the best of their ability. And
  how effective could that protection be&mdash;the best of a semi-invalid
  woman, a shambling Negro, a man well past his prime?</p>

  <p>Miss Wayne nipped a bit of toast, sipped the final drops of coffee from a
  cup whose texture was that of a milky bubble. "I shall not trouble you to
  read to me this morning, my dear. The doctor is coming&mdash;you are free
  till after lunch."</p>

  <p>There it was again, another phase of the mystery that was never obtrusive
  but always in evidence in the queer ways of this queer place. Twice or three
  times before it had happened. Loretta would announce the practitioner's
  impending call and tell Rose that her time was her own. Then Wayne would
  casually, quite casually, find something for the girl to do, something that
  would take her out of the house. Out of sight of the house...</p>

  <p>Now, closing the door with the tray of emptied dishes on her hand, she
  would have been surprised not to have found him stumping up the stairs with
  that curiously stiff gait of his, not to have heard him say, with his
  humorless smile, "Oh, Miss Lynn...I wonder if I may trespass on your good
  nature."</p>

  <p>This time Rose had to resist the flicker of an impulse to refuse. "Of
  course. Miss Wayne does not need me till after luncheon. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"This letter." He held it out to her. "It came in the morning post and I
  want it returned at once to the sender, unopened. This is Saturday and if it
  doesn't make the noon mail out of Lordville it will have to wait till Monday.
  That is too long for the whippersnapper to think I have read one of his
  scrawls."</p>

  <p>Rose took the white envelope, glanced at it, wondered if her flush was
  visible to Wayne as she read the sender's name. <i>Philip T. Horn.</i> But
  she knew her voice was cool, steady. "I'll take it down for you. As soon as I
  give these to Isaiah."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But will you be very angry," she added hurriedly, "if I ask you
  something?" A saucer clinked against the tray rim as her arm trembled.</p>

  <p>Wayne seemed puzzled. "Angry?"</p>

  <p>"Please don't be. Mr. Wayne? Why are you so bitter against your nephew?
  Why do you refuse to have anything to do with him? Miss Loretta tells me you
  have never seen him."</p>

  <p>His face took on the immobility of marble; his eyes were dark flame. The
  response dripped slowly from his white lips: "I have no nephew."</p>

  <p>"But Philip Horn is your sister's son. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>White spots showed along the knuckles of Wayne's hand as his fingers dug
  into the banister. "Miss Lynn, you will not mention that name again, nor
  refer to the subject. Loretta is my only sister. The only sister I ever had.
  Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;" Rose checked herself as the hot glare in his eyes beat her
  down. "I&mdash;I understand. Please forget what I said."</p>

  <p>Suddenly as it had come, the icy wrath was gone from the man's face.
  "You'll take care of the letter?"</p>

  <p>"At once." Something like a tear trembled on Rose's eyelash as she started
  down, passing Wayne. She wished...</p>

  <p>The half-formed thought was cut short by a muffled exclamation, a thud,
  behind her. She whirled. Wayne was sprawled on the landing, a frayed
  carpet-edge still caught in his heel.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" The girl rid herself of the tray in a lithe motion, leaped to help
  him.</p>

  <p>"Get away!" Wayne squealed, and struck at her hand. "Let me alone!" His
  countenance was suffused with purple, his lip curled in a sudden, astounding
  snarl! "I don't need help. I don't want it." He was on his back. His arms
  were cramped to acute, unnatural angles; his hands were hooked, were
  claw-like. His legs trailed down the stairs with a curious helplessness.</p>

  <p>Half-stooped to him, Rose froze, and the short hairs at the nape of her
  neck bristled with a queer repugnance.</p>

  <p>"Get away!" the strangely enraged man spat once more. The virulence of his
  command jerked the girl upright, sent her fleeing down the staircase, through
  the beamed gloom of the entrance hall, into the brick-walled kitchen.
  Isaiah's face was a black moon against ranged rows of burnished copper pots.
  He put a hand out to her, halted her wild flight.</p>

  <p>"What's the matteh?" the Negro demanded. "Whut's happened, missie?"</p>

  <p>The pound of her heart shook Rose's small frame. "Oh, Isaiah. Mr. Wayne
  fell, and...and..."</p>

  <p>"Yoh done tried he'p him git up." The black's eyes were blue-white
  marbles, rolling frenziedly. "Youh didn't ought to do that. He doan lak it
  nohow."</p>

  <p>"But why, Isaiah?" The words quivered. "Why?"</p>

  <p>Abruptly there was something electric in the air of the vaulted, dim
  kitchen. A grey film dulled the dark gloss of the old servant's skin. His
  hand on her arm was trembling and, queerly enough, there was the same appeal
  and dread, in Isaiah's eyes as had been in Wayne's this morning.</p>

  <p>His protuberant mouth moved, and Rose tensed. Then he spoke. "Doan ask,
  missie. Doan ask no queshuns 'bout anything yoh see heah. But git out. Doan
  sleep anotheh night in this yer house."</p>

  <p>"But Isaiah&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Rose stopped as the <i>thump, thump</i> of Roger Wayne's stiff-legged walk
  sounded from the foyer. "Miss Lynn," he called. "Miss Lynn."</p>

  <p>She turned, and he was in the doorway. "Miss Lynn. I want to speak to
  you."</p>

  <p>There was dust on his black velvet smoking-jacket, and his antiquated
  stock of lustrous black silk was slightly askew, but he was his dignified
  self again. His eyes slid momentarily to the Negro. Rose fancied she saw the
  flicker of a signal pass between master and servant, was aware that Isaiah
  had shambled through the swinging door into the dining-room and that she was
  alone with Wayne.</p>

  <p>A tiny muscle twitched in her cheek. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>The corner of Wayne's mouth quirked. "I wish to apologize for my actions
  just now. My rudeness was&mdash;uncalled for."</p>

  <p>The girl's brows arched, and she straightened with unconscious hauteur.
  Inexplicably, his bearing obliterated the difference between them of age and
  position, and she was aware that some obscure importance hinged for him on
  her reception of his proffered amends.</p>

  <p>His hand made a gesture toward her, somehow pathetic. "You&mdash;you will
  not leave us? You have done Loretta so much good. We&mdash;she needs you. You
  have brought into this house the first sunshine that has lightened its gloom
  for more years than I care to think."</p>

  <p>In someone else, in more usual surroundings, the speech would have been
  stagy, mawkish. But from him, in this place, it was quite natural, quite
  sincere. Rose recalled that this man, well past his prime, had given up his
  sleep to protect her, and her indignation, her fear of him gave way to a
  sudden, inexplicable pity.</p>

  <p>Impulsive words spoke themselves for her. "Leave! Of course not. I'll stay
  as long as you need me."</p>

  <p>Something splintered in the rigid lines of his face, and momentarily it
  was flabby, quivering, like that of a frightened old man's. Then it firmed
  again, and he was nodding gravely. "Thank you. You are very good to us."</p>

  <p>Rose almost said something then that afterward she would have regretted.
  But she changed it to, "No, I'm not. But if I'm to get this letter mailed in
  time..."</p>

  <p>It was only later she realized Wayne had apologized for his strange
  actions at the head of the stairs, but had not explained them...</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE SCREAM FROM BELOW</h2>

  <p class="first">ROSE hurried through the tangle of neglected garden sloping
  from before the old house, the letter that had served as excuse to send her
  away conspicuously in her hand. She reached the rutted road winding down the
  hillside to the village, strode purposefully along it. She passed the
  unkempt, grassy descent that once had been the proud Wayne lawn. Woods came
  up to the trail edge on either side and she was walking through a long green
  tunnel, damp and dark and shadowy.</p>

  <p>From ahead came the rattle-bang of a battered flivver. Its crumpled,
  brassy nose poked into sight around a curve and from its wheel a gaunt-faced,
  straggly-bearded man let his eyes stray over her with a curiously impersonal
  appraisal. Bleared eyes they were, rheumy and tired as if they had looked too
  often on scenes it is not good for the soul of man to see. The car passed and
  Rose saw on the seat beside its driver a long, narrow satchel of once-black
  leather. This then was Dr. Hamilton, about whose calls at the Wayne mansion
  were things she must not know.</p>

  <p>She kept going till a glance over her shoulder told her the physician
  could no longer see her. Then she darted to the roadside, scooped a hole in
  the soft dirt, buried the letter, marked the spot with a cairn of three
  stones. This done she plunged into the thicket.</p>

  <p>Shadows moved queerly in the thick foliage. Little things scuttered away
  from the girl's advance. Low-hanging branches whipped across her face and
  brambles tore the sheer silk of her hose. But in minutes she was holding
  aside a leafy screen of rank, untended vines and peering through the aperture
  at the back of the house she had quitted not twenty minutes before.</p>

  <p>The windows were blank in the weathered facade at which she looked. She
  could see into the kitchen; there was no sign of Isaiah. Loretta's room was
  to the front. Undoubtedly her brother would be there, with the doctor. The
  Negro was the only one she need worry about.</p>

  <p>Rose bit her lip, darted across the yard, up the steps of the little
  pantry porch. A skewed screen door came open and the paintless wood panel
  behind it. Breath whistled between her lips. There was another door between
  her and the kitchen proper, and beyond it the entrance foyer and the little
  clothes-closet in the stairwell between the steps to the cellar and those to
  the upper floor. If she could get there unseen she would be safe.</p>

  <p>From beyond there came a rumble of voices, but nearby there was no sound.
  Rose's throat was dry as she got a trembling hand on a doorknob, twisted it.
  What if they caught her here, what explanation could she give?</p>

  <p>There was no one in the kitchen; she flitted across its stone floor
  soundlessly, was out in the hall. From upstairs came a door-slam; footsteps
  pounded in the corridor. But already she was inside the little closet,
  pressed back behind dusty, forgotten garments. From the back of her
  hiding-place a slit of light was visible, between sill and edge of the door
  she had not dared to close tightly.</p>

  <p>Descending footfalls pounded over her head. She was too late. The doctor
  was leaving, and she had learned nothing.</p>

  <p>A dark form flitted across her view-slit, and another. Queer. They had not
  gone to the front door, they were going back to the kitchen.</p>

  <p>No. Keys rattled, a lock grated, and the footsteps sounded again on stairs
  <i>beneath her.</i> They were going down into the cellar!</p>

  <p>She told herself it was silly to be suddenly so frightened, so
  apprehensive. Wine is kept in the cellars. They had gone down to open a
  bottle, to drink together. That was all. Now was her chance to get out. But
  she could not nerve herself to move. She crouched against the back of the
  closet and whimpered under her breath;</p>

  <p>In God's name, what was that scuttering beneath her feet, that quick
  pattering as if some small thing were darting about? She heard Wayne's voice,
  harsh, guttural, could not make out what he said. But the anguish of his tone
  struck an answering chord in her own breast.</p>

  <p>Another rasping voice responded. Abruptly the scuttering stopped, and
  someone down there screamed. The sound knifed into Rose's brain. It gave way
  then to a horrible, meaningful scuffle. That ended in a crackling snap like
  the smack of a whip on quivering flesh, and piercing shrieks of torment from
  below were a scarlet rivulet through the silence.</p>

  <p>Quite suddenly, the screams had stopped, and there were only fading moans
  that died to nothingness. Rose realized that she had slid down to the floor
  of the little space where she was hid, and that somehow the closet door had
  opened still farther, so that she had a clearer view of the passage
  outside.</p>

  <p>There were no moans any longer, and feet were running up the stairs.
  <i>One pair of feet!</i> They reached the upper floor, pounded past. Rose
  glimpsed the straggly beard, the seamed countenance of the doctor. The outer
  door creaked open, thudded shut. From outside came the muffled machination of
  the Ford's starting, and the roar of its departure.</p>

  <p>Rose lay still on the floor of the closet, and horror shook her. For there
  had been blood on the doctor's hand, and on his cheek. He had run out of the
  house as one possessed, and Roger Wayne had not come out of the cellar. What
  had happened? Oh God! What had happened in the basement beneath her?</p>

  <p>Something was snarling now down there, was making little mumbling noises
  that rippled her spine with dread. Noises like some fierce beast mouthing its
  kill. Rose pushed at the floor with gelid hands. Her throat tightened, was
  torn by a stifled scream. The pattering was coming up the cellar stairs!
  Terror rocked the girl. She moaned, perked down sleazy black cloth to hide
  her from what had been imprisoned in the cellar and had escaped.</p>

  <p>It was on the landing. It was in the passage outside, was pattering by.
  No. Oh God! No! It had stopped, right outside her cubicle! Rose could hear it
  sniff, like a dog catching a strange scent.</p>

  <p>Seconds dragged into an eternity of quivering, soul-shaking fear. The girl
  cringed beneath the dusty cloth she had pulled down over her, and her skin
  crawled as the Thing whimpered avidly. Then that with which she had fatuously
  thought to conceal herself twitched, started to move off her with an ominous,
  slow sureness.</p>

  <p>She squirmed, trying to get away. But the cloth pulled away, and her
  bulging eyes saw horror.</p>

  <p>It was a tiny figure that leaned in to her, its malformed, grotesque body
  not reaching as high as the knob on the door. Its short legs were straight,
  kneeless. Eyes of red flame glowed from a head whose high dome was hairless.
  A blue-lipped mouth twisted and smirked like that of an idiot child snatching
  for a brightly colored toy it would destroy. And a clawed, trembling hand
  reached out for her. It closed around her ankle, and tugged fiercely to drag
  her from her refuge.</p>

  <p>Rose's hands flung out, clutched at fabric that ripped and tore away as
  the gargoylesque manikin dragged her inexorably to it. The Thing laughed, and
  its laugh was the shrill meaningless laugh of a child&mdash;or a madman.
  Despair was molten lead in her veins, sliced her breast with its searing
  fangs. She closed her eyes against the grisly visage peering avidly at her.
  And suddenly the laughter stopped, and the Thing whimpered, and it was not
  pulling her to it any longer.</p>

  <p>The girl forced rigid eyelids open. The dwarf's head, huge by contrast to
  its minuscule torso, was canted sidewise. Its rubescent eyes had slid to
  slitted corners, as if some untoward sound had distracted it. Through the
  pounding of her own heart, Rose heard now the thud of something soft on wood,
  measured, persistent. And a muffled voice was shouting, from what seemed an
  immense distance.</p>

  <p>"Yassah." That was Isaiah, upstairs. "Yassah. Coming. Coming." His
  footfalls were a hurried shambling on the risers overhead.</p>

  <p>Animation faded from the monster's grotesque countenance. Something like
  fear crept into its eyes, and crafty cunning. As the sound of the Negro's
  descent reached the hallway floor it freed Rose's ankle. It twisted, was
  gone, scuttering to the cellar door, down into the mysterious depths of the
  basement.</p>

  <p>At that instant Rose heard the hinges of the outer portal squeak open,
  realized the thudding that apparently had saved her had been a pounding on
  that great door. She heard Isaiah's "Yassah, whut is it?" Heard vibrant,
  anxious tones in response: "Is anything the matter here?"</p>

  <p>"Mattuh? No sah. They ain't nothin..."</p>

  <p>Rose was pulling herself up from the closet floor, aquiver with a sudden,
  wild surmise. That voice!</p>

  <p>"I was passing on the road and I thought I heard screams. Guess I was
  wrong."</p>

  <p>The girl tumbled out of the cubicle, reeled into the passageway and
  twisted toward the front. Isaiah's brown hand was on the knob of the massive
  door, and his bent figure was stubborn in the opening. But over his woolly
  pate the sun spotlighted the strong lines of a bronzed face, black eyes
  narrowed with speculation. Sound surged to Rose's throat, but a larynx torn
  by unuttered screams refused to function. Her cry was only a rasping,
  inaudible sound.</p>

  <p>"Yoh <i>was</i> wrong. Yassuh." Isaiah was closing the door. The young man
  stood irresolutely. In another moment...</p>

  <p>She couldn't get to the door in time; in the dimness here he could not see
  her. Trying to move she staggered, flung out a hand to save herself, felt the
  edge of a picture-frame on the wall. She gripped it and it crashed down.</p>

  <p>Isaiah jerked around to the sudden sound; but the young man shoved
  past.</p>

  <p>Rose thrust out a shaking hand to him. She found voice. "Ted! Oh Ted!"</p>

  <p>Strong arms were around her, were holding her close to rough cloth; the
  familiar odor of tweed and tobacco smoke was in her nostrils. "Rose!
  Something did&mdash;What have they done to you?"</p>

  <p>"Ted! How did you come here? How...?"</p>

  <p>"I was worried about you, decided to come out. As I came up the road I
  heard someone screaming..."</p>

  <p>"Ted!" Rose squirmed from his embrace. She twisted to the cellar door,
  open now, revealing a slit of blackness. "Down there. Mr. Wayne. Something
  dreadful's happened to him down there!"</p>

  <p>The young man took a step toward that door, his mouth tightening grimly.
  But with surprising agility Isaiah was around them both, was barring the way,
  his arms extended from wall to wall of the narrow passage. His face was no
  longer brown, but a livid, leaden grey.</p>

  <p>"Nuthin's happened to Mistuh Wayne;" he said. "Nuthin'?"</p>

  <p>"It was he screaming." Rose pushed at the old Negro; but some surprising,
  spasmodic strength in his old frame made him rocklike. "Ted! It was he who
  screamed. He's hurt, killed..."</p>

  <p>Muscles lumped along Ted's jaw. "Let me pass. Let me by, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," the Negro yammered. "Yoh kaint go down in that basement. Yoh
  kaint."</p>

  <p>"Who says I can't!" The young man's hand fisted.</p>

  <p>"I do." Like a gust of icy rain Roger Wayne's voice sprayed into the hall.
  He was standing in the cellar doorway, his face a frozen, expressionless
  mask. Not a jot of his antiquated but meticulous clothing was disturbed, not
  a filament of his hair misplaced. He pulled the door to behind him, locked it
  with a large iron key that was rock-steady in his hand. Then he turned again,
  lifted bushy grey eyebrows. "What is going on here?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wayne!" Rose's exclamation was a mere breath. "I thought
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His eyes shifted to her, and they were glassy, unfathomable. "I thought
  you were on the way to Lordville, Miss Lynn. How do you happen to be
  here?"</p>

  <p>The attack took Rose unawares. "I&mdash;I..." she stammered. "I came back
  to&mdash;to get my pocketbook. I wanted to buy something." She bit her lip.
  Why offer so inane an excuse for her presence? He would not for a minute
  believe it.</p>

  <p>But oddly enough, he did&mdash;or at least he did not challenge it. He
  seemed to have dismissed her from his mind, was looking at Ted. "And you,
  sir. May I be permitted to inquire why you have taken it upon yourself to
  threaten my servant and search my house?"</p>

  <p>White spots showed either side of the young man's nostrils; his eyes
  flashed and his jaw thrust forward belligerently. Rose put a hand on his arm.
  She spoke hurriedly, to forestall the other's reply. "Ted knew I was here,
  and came out to visit me. He thought he heard someone screaming in here, and
  wanted to help. He was afraid for me. He&mdash;he is my fiancé."</p>

  <p>"Your&mdash;fiancé," Wayne repeated. The two words dripped from his thin
  lips into a sudden, queer silence. Then he was saying, as though the
  situation were the most ordinary in the world, "You are very fortunate. May I
  offer an old man's congratulations?"</p>

  <p>Somehow the tenseness broke. Roger Wayne's grey hand was gripping Ted's
  sun-tanned fingers and the three were moving toward the arched entrance
  door&mdash;while Isaiah, at a nod from his master, fumbled in a cellarette
  for a fat-bellied decanter and three small glasses.</p>

  <p>"My sister will never forgive me if I let you go without her meeting you,"
  Wayne said. "You must lunch with us, spend the afternoon."</p>

  <p>Some peculiar magic in his mannered cordiality, some strange aura of
  dominance, pulled a curtain over the weird events of the preceding half-hour,
  made of its screaming horror something artificial, a brief episode on the
  stage of a theater, utterly unreal. The trio clinked glasses and drank. The
  black disappeared into the purlieus of his kitchen. Then Rose excused
  herself, saying, "Miss Wayne will be waiting for me to help her get ready to
  come down."</p>

  <p>She climbed slowly through the dim half-light of the graceful stairs. The
  murmur of the men's voices came up to her, and the clink of their glasses.
  Yesterday she would have been overjoyed, jubilant, at the turn of events, at
  Ted's presence in this house and his friendly reception by Wayne. But now,
  freed momentarily from the tall man's almost hypnotic influence, her
  bewildered senses swirled around full cycle to fear again, and a nameless
  dread. Grotesquely, Roger Wayne played the gracious host while beneath his
  feet gruesome horror dwelt. How could he...?</p>

  <p>The dwarf's contorted body, his hairless head rose up before Rose's
  memory. Good Lord! Twisted almost out of human semblance, there yet had been
  a macabre something in that face that was darkly familiar, as though she had
  seen it in some forgotten nightmare.</p>

  <p>The image cleared in the girl's mind, and her blood ran cold as she
  realized what it was. Malformed, hideous, horrible, it still resembled Roger
  Wayne and Loretta&mdash;resembled even more the age-darkened portrait of
  their father hanging over the drawing-room fireplace below!</p>

  <p>That realization gave her a glimmer of the truth, and sudden pity for the
  two old people welled up in her once more. Under Wayne's Old World dignity,
  under Loretta's aristocratic frailness, bubbled a cauldron of such distress
  as few are called upon to endure. The weird game they had played through the
  lonely, tortured years showed clear to her. Too clear. She knew that
  inexorably she had been caught up into that game, she and Ted, knew they were
  committed to play it to the end.</p>

  <p>Quivering, her skin acrawl with the dreadful new knowledge that had come
  to her, Rose reached the upper landing and darted into her room for a quick
  change, a dash of cold water on her face, a hasty straightening of her
  tumbled hair. Then she was with the old lady, was smiling with a forced
  gayety as she told her of Ted's arrival and their engagement. Loretta's wan
  excitement, the quick, cold peck of her fleshless lips, her pale, transparent
  eagerness to descend brought tears to the girl's eyes she was at pains to
  conceal. So much, so terribly much, did the entrance of a little vicarious
  happiness mean in this house of infinite despair.</p>

  <p>With quite obvious tact the Waynes had left the two lovers alone after a
  cheery lunch. Ted's expression had grown hard, his dark eyes sultry, as Rose
  had whispered to him the occurrences of the night and the terrible morning.
  "You can't stay here another night. I won't let you," he said. "Anything
  might happen. Pack and come back to town with me, at once."</p>

  <p>The girl moved away from him, stiffened, her head erect. "No! I'm not
  going. They need me. Nothing will harm me. He won't let
  the&mdash;the&mdash;<i>it</i> harm me."</p>

  <p>"He won't, eh? He didn't this morning, of course. If I hadn't
  knocked..."</p>

  <p>"He didn't know I was in the house. He sent me away to keep me safe."</p>

  <p>"It won't do, Rose. Maybe Wayne's doing his best, but the Thing might get
  loose from the cellar again, and then..."</p>

  <p>The girl's small jaw set in a stubborn line. "I promised him I'd stay, and
  I won't break my promise. Oh, can't you understand, Ted? When I first came
  they never smiled, either of them. I'm sure they were going slowly mad. Why,
  when Mr. Wayne fell he went into a fit of almost maniacal rage just because I
  tried to help him get up. But I've done them a lot of good. He said so. He
  said I had brought sunshine into the house. They've been pathetically reliant
  on me, and I can't throw them over now. I can't, dear. It&mdash;it would be
  cruel."</p>

  <p>Ted's arms were stiff at his sides, his hands fisted. His eyes took the
  girl's and for a long minute the shadowed drawing-room was taut with the
  silent battle between them. But it was the man's that finally fell away,
  defeated. "All right, then," he grunted. "If you stay, I do. I'm not leaving
  you alone here."</p>

  <p>Rose's tight face broke into a smile, and her eyes danced. "Oh Ted, that
  will be wonderful! They'll love that. Loretta said to me, while you and her
  brother were talking over by the fireplace, that it seemed quite like old
  times with a young couple in the house. She was happier than I've ever seen
  her. Her cheeks positively had a little color in them."</p>

  <p>"The old boy seemed pretty well pepped up too," Ted agreed. "He was
  telling me some stories of the parties they ran in this room in the old days,
  when they danced the minuet and drank punch. These gloomy old walls have seen
  some high times, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait," Rose interrupted. "Wait, Ted! I have an idea. Oh, I have a grand
  and gorgeous idea! We'll bring back those good old times for them. We'll make
  them happy for one night at least and give them something to remember! We'll
  have a party..."</p>

  <p>"A party! What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Just that. You'll get into your car and run back to town. Call up the
  Snells, and George and Mary Parker, and&mdash;Dickie Mays and his girl.
  George has an old portable radio with batteries&mdash;get that. And I'll give
  you a list of stuff to bring, cake and candy and olives, and all. I won't say
  a word, and..."</p>

  <p>She was rattling on now, animatedly. "Please, Ted. Please. They'll love
  it. Please." The young man's mouth opened to protest; she closed it in the
  immemorial way of all lovers, her arms about his neck, her warm body close to
  his. "Don't you see how much pleasure it will give them? And..." She
  whispered in his ear.</p>

  <p>What could a fellow do? "All right, pug-nose," Ted finally said, planting
  a kiss on the portion of her anatomy he mentioned. "I'll try to arrange it.
  But be careful, dear. Please be careful that nothing happens to you while I'm
  away."</p>

  <p>"You're the dearest boy in all the world. And don't worry. I shall be
  perfectly all right."</p>

  <p>But when she had waved good-bye and watched his roadster jounce away, Rose
  was not so sure of this. The sky had clouded, was a leaden grey vault
  lowering over the gaunt spread of the old house whose windows looked blindly
  at her as she came slowly back to it through the dreary garden. Her heart was
  suddenly cold with foreboding, and it seemed to her that the Wayne mansion
  cringed to some inescapable, imminent doom.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; BLOOD-STAINS</h2>

  <p class="first">DARK sifted down early and with it a drizzle came, investing
  the already desolate house with a damp chill that penetrated to Rose's very
  bones. In the high-ceilinged, dusty drawing-room a flickering fire and a
  half-dozen tall, spectral candles fought unavailingly against the gloom.
  Windows were tight shut, heavy portieres hung across the wide-arched entrance
  to the room, and the air was heavily still, almost stagnant. But somehow the
  slender candle-flames wavered in a ghostly wind and black, weighty shadows
  slid along the floors and wall.</p>

  <p>One black silhouette was like a huge spread-winged bird hovering over the
  great armchair in which Roger Wayne sat, austere visage red-edged by the
  firelight. Rose remembered a vampire bat she had seen once in some zoo. The
  shadow was like that, an indescribably foul thing whose hooked claws could
  cling, whose needle-pointed beak could suck the very life blood from the
  veins of its prey. She shuddered. It was the tangible embodiment of the evil
  secret that had drained the life blood from the House of Wayne, that had
  greyed this man's skin and his life, that had made of the sweet-faced old
  lady across the fireside from him a feeble, silently enduring invalid.</p>

  <p>The crackle of the fire, the <i>click, click</i> of lone bone needles with
  which Loretta Wayne knitted an endless skein, the rustle of a page Rose
  turned as she pretended to read some wordy novel she had found about the
  house, were the only sounds to be heard. Yet she knew that Roger and Loretta
  Wayne were listening for something, listening for something they dreaded to
  hear. Evening after evening they had sat like this, under the shadow of fear,
  the chill of it in their veins.</p>

  <p>Tonight it would be different. Rose smiled to herself. She had a secret of
  her own tonight, a happy one. Where were they? Why didn't they come? Surely
  they ought to be here by now.</p>

  <p>From outside sounded a faraway thrumming. It came nearer, nearer. Wayne
  stirred. "Sounds like someone driving up the hill road. I wonder who?"</p>

  <p>Rose closed her book, got up. "I wonder," she said disarmingly, and
  crossed to a window. She pulled aside a thick, dusty curtain, peered out. For
  an instant the blackness out there was impenetrable. Then motor-roar
  thundered, and a white light-beam scythed the darkness.</p>

  <p>It flashed across the garden, straightened to the muddy road as a big
  closed car lurched to a stop.</p>

  <p>Something darted across lush grass, vanished in the Stygian shadow of a
  spread-topped bush. Apprehension caught at Rose's throat. It was some animal,
  some disturbed animal, she told herself. But in the fleeting glimpse she had
  had of it it had seemed to run on two legs, to have been topped by the oval
  of a pale, almost human face.</p>

  <p>The sedan's doors popped open, dark figures scrambled out. Rose twisted to
  the room behind her, saw Loretta looking at her inquiringly, saw that Wayne
  had risen, was starting toward her. "They're coming in here," Rose gasped.
  "I'll go see what they want."</p>

  <p>Before any protest could be voiced she was across the room, was out in the
  hall, loosening the bolt of the big door.</p>

  <p>The threshold was crowded with fur-coated figures, arms piled high with
  bundles. "Surprise!" someone yelled, and young voices chorused, "Surprise!"
  They swirled in and around her&mdash;Ted, plump little Mary Parker, her round
  face beaming. This lank six-and-a-half-footer was Lou Snell. He ducked his
  wet chin at a huge black box clamped to his chest and shouted, "For the love
  of Pete, Rose, tell me where to put this. It's crippling me."</p>

  <p>Rose was frightened, now, at what she had done. But she played the part
  she had rehearsed. "Ted," she cried. "What is this all about? What on
  earth...?"</p>

  <p>Her fiancé slid an arm around her waist, pulled her to him, and kissed her
  full on the lips. "Birthday surprise, dear. Forget it was your birthday?"</p>

  <p>"I did. Oh Ted! You shouldn't have. This isn't my home. Mr. Wayne..."</p>

  <p>She turned. Wayne was stock upright between the folds of the portieres
  into the drawing-room. His face was immobile, expressionless as ever, but his
  eyes were darting from one to the other of the milling young people. "Mr.
  Wayne! This is terrible. My friends..."</p>

  <p>"Are quite welcome," Wayne said. "Please ask them to come in. Loretta and
  I will retire to our rooms and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at all, sir." Ted had Rose's cold hand in his, and his face was lit
  by a boyish, appealing grin. "We want you with us. In fact, if you do not
  join us we shall fold our tents like the Arabs and silently steal away."</p>

  <p>The little old lady came through the curtains and was at her brother's
  side, her eyes sparkling. "I'll tell you a secret," Ted continued. "Rose's
  birthday is just an excuse. I really brought these folks out here to give
  them the privilege I had this morning, of meeting a lady and gentleman of the
  old school. I wanted to give them a lesson in manners, you see sir, and the
  art of fine living."</p>

  <p>"That's right!"&mdash;"We came to meet you, sir."&mdash;"We'll go away if
  you don't stay with us!" The exclamations popping from every hand did credit
  to Ted's coaching.</p>

  <p>Wayne appeared irresolute. "I&mdash;I don't believe..." he started.</p>

  <p>But his sister's thin, quavering voice interrupted him. "Roger. Of course
  they don't mean the nice things they're saying. But let's believe them. Let
  us take them at their word. It is so long since there have been young people
  in this house, and laughter. It will do me good, and you too, if we sit
  mouse-like in our corner by the fire and watch them."</p>

  <p>"You dear!" Rose burst out. She darted to Loretta, threw her arms around
  the frail body, kissed the thin lips. "We're going to have a grand time. I
  know it."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">CANDLES made a blaze of light in the old room, candles in
  graceful porcelain holders, multitudinous in the crystal chandelier overhead,
  but somehow the lilting strains of <i>La Cucaracha</i> were not at all out of
  place here, coming though they did from some electric lit night-club in New
  York. Dickie Mays, black-mustached, dapper, and his latest bobbed-hair flame,
  Freea Tainton, were doing an exhibition dance to the tune. George Parker was
  strumming an imaginary guitar before the old lady, who was smiling broadly
  and beating time to the music. While Lou Snell, with Mary's laughing
  assistance, was poking the fire to a higher blaze.</p>

  <p>Ted danced Rose into a corner and stopped. "This is the first chance I've
  had to talk with you, you minx," he said. "How'd I do?"</p>

  <p>"You've been grand," Rose answered. "But&mdash;" she bit her lip.</p>

  <p>"But what? What's wrong?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know." The girl repressed a shiver. "There isn't any reason for
  it, but I'm terribly nervous. Ted. Where's Lou's wife? Where's Ruth?"</p>

  <p>"The blonde vamp?" Ted grinned. "Is that all that's worrying you? She's
  been prattling to Wayne all evening, and he finally took her out to the
  kitchen to show her how they used to make the famous family punch. He just
  called Isaiah out, probably to protect himself from her."</p>

  <p>Rose's soft palm touched his lips, lightly. "Don't be vulgar." Then, "I'm
  silly. I know I am. Come, let's dance."</p>

  <p>"A kiss first. Nobody's looking. Come on."</p>

  <p>"Wait. There's Isaiah coming back." There was nothing to worry about, Rose
  assured herself, nothing at all. But she tensed as the Negro waddled through
  the door, staggering under the weight of a huge cut-glass bowl filled with a
  glinting, ruby liquid. A cheer went up. Roger Wayne stalked through behind
  him, carrying a tray of glasses and a great ladle. The portieres swished to
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"Ted!" Rose whispered. "Ruth isn't with them."</p>

  <p>"I suppose she&mdash;well, we had a long ride, you know. Look here, Rose,
  do I get that kiss?"</p>

  <p>Rose evaded him, moved lithely across the floor. "Mr. Wayne," she said,
  trying to keep her voice steady. "I'm looking for Miss Snell. Have you seen
  her around?"</p>

  <p>Wayne raised quizzical eyebrows. "She went out with me, but found the
  kitchen too chilly, she said, and came right back. Isn't she here?"</p>

  <p>"Why no." Rose forced a smile. Why did a hand seem to clutch her heart?
  "She must have gone upstairs. Ruth's always fussing with her hair. I'll go
  look."</p>

  <p>She went into the hall. Only a dim lamp burned here, high up in the
  ceiling, and the passage past the stairs to the rear was a blank, mysterious
  maw. Back there was the door to the cellar stairs and&mdash;But she mustn't
  think of that. "Ruth," she called. "Ruth Snell!"</p>

  <p>Her cry went hollowly into the recesses of the old house, was quenched by
  silence. The merrymaking in the drawing-room behind her was muffled by the
  heavy curtains between, seemed somehow, dreamlike. "Ruth!" she called
  again.</p>

  <p>There was no answer. Alarmingly no answer. Surely, wherever the girl might
  be, she would answer. Rose's apprehension deepened. What if...</p>

  <p>Her legs seemed to move through a viscous, clogging liquid that strove to
  hold her back. She got to the carved newel-post, peered up into the murk of
  the upper floor. No light up there. No movement.</p>

  <p>A rustle twisted Rose around, her hand going to her mouth with sudden
  fright. Wayne was standing in front of the curtains, a curious speculation in
  his shaded eyes. "What is it?" he asked. "What is it, my dear? Did I hear you
  cry out?"</p>

  <p>He was afraid too. Rose saw the way the skin tightened along his jaw and
  knew that he too was afraid. The same grisly thought was in both their
  minds.</p>

  <p>"I was calling for Ruth," Rose said. "She doesn't answer."</p>

  <p>"Have you looked for her upstairs? You said..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know I did. But there isn't any light up there."</p>

  <p>"The doors close tightly, you know. Perhaps she is in your room. Why don't
  you go and see?"</p>

  <p>He was trying to get her out of the way while he looked in a more likely
  place. He was still fighting to protect his secret, as he had when he sent
  her to the village while the doctor came. Here was the dread game again, the
  game that tacitly she had promised to play.</p>

  <p>Rose answered as she knew she was supposed to answer. "Yes. I'll go
  see."</p>

  <p>She felt his eyes on her back as she climbed&mdash;his brooding, tortured
  eyes. She pulled herself up by the banisters, step by fearful step, and the
  darkness reached down to her, engulfed her. Panic seized her, drained the
  strength from her limbs. She clung to the end of the wooden rail, momentarily
  unable to move. Yet there was nothing to fear up here. Nothing. <i>That to be
  feared was below!</i></p>

  <p>Below? From somewhere ahead of her, from the lightless, musty reaches of
  the corridor, a low, gasping moan sounded!</p>

  <p>Infinite anguish, infinite helplessness in the almost inaudible cry
  threaded Rose's brain with searing tendrils of horror. It came again now, a
  choked burbling of agony. It galvanized the girl into action. She plunged
  ahead into the darkness and the menace of that Stygian hall, plunged alone
  into its dread obscurity, while her voice came, a husked whisper from between
  gelid lips.</p>

  <p>"Ruth. Where are you, Ruth?"</p>

  <p>The moan did not sound again but there was another sound in the darkness,
  a sound that sheathed Rose's slim body with ice and dried her throat with
  utter terror. Sourcelessly, from everywhere and nowhere, there was that
  patter of small feet that now had power to rack her with utter dread. That
  muffled patter of small feet, and close on it the slither of fabric against
  wood as though some heavy body were being dragged. Where? For what? For what
  demoniacal purpose?</p>

  <p>Oh God! Rose crouched, whimpering, rocking her head from side to side,
  peering into unfathomable darkness alive with eerie menace. Fear racked her,
  strength-draining fear, and clamped icy fingers about her throat so that her
  agonized cry was inaudible. Then her little fists clenched, jerked
  spasmodically at her sides.</p>

  <p>There! There to her right and somewhat ahead, a hairline of yellow light
  lay close to the floor. It seeped from under a door. That door was the one to
  her own room, and suddenly she knew that it was from there, from behind that
  door, that the moan, the scuttering of loathsome feet, and the fearsome
  dragging of a limp body had come.</p>

  <p>A burst of laughter reached her from below. It died away, and quite
  distinctly through the quivering dark there came an inane, feminine giggle,
  and a shrill, rapid voice. "So my nephoo bit the dog to see if it was any
  good, and..."</p>

  <p>It was some power outside herself that set Rose moving again, that
  impelled her stiff-limbed, infinitely slow progress towards the door from
  beneath which the light showed. She reached it at last, trailed numbed
  fingers across a dust-smeared panel, felt the chill of the china doorknob.
  Mechanically those fingers closed on the round handle. The rattle of its
  turning splintered the hush of the upper hall, a hush more fearsome because
  of the curtain-muffled noise of gayety from below. The door swung open...</p>

  <p>The lamp on the dresser-top was lit. Rose blinked to the momentarily
  blinding glare of its luminance, kept her eyes closed against fear of what
  she would see when her vision cleared. Frigid ripples prickled her spine.
  There was no sound, utterly no sound from the room; but someone must be in
  there. Someone. She forced her lids open, daring to look.</p>

  <p>The room was empty, stark, startlingly empty. There was no sign that
  anyone had entered it since she had left it hours ago. Yes. Her probing eyes
  reached the age-patinaed dresser, saw that her white comb was out of line
  with the other items of her neatly laid out toilet-set, saw that a blonde
  hair coiled about one of its teeth. Ruth had been here then. She had been
  here&mdash;<i>but where was she now?</i></p>

  <p>What was that on the floor, just under the down-trailing edge of the bed's
  counter-pane? Rose took a fearful step into the room, another. She bent to
  the shadow lumping there. Her shaking fingers picked up a pump, an absurd
  little pump of light blue satin with a three-inch, stilted heel.</p>

  <p>It was not hers. It was Ruth's. She was sure it was Ruth's. It was still
  warm from the foot that it had encased and across its gleaming vamp there was
  a stain. A smear of sticky liquid, still wet, a stain that gleamed dully
  red.</p>

  <p>It was a stain of fresh blood.</p>

  <p>Rose stared at the thing in her hand and something within her seemed to
  die. She had done this thing. She had brought Ruth Snell, a handful of blonde
  femininity with red lips made only for kisses, to this house of horror. There
  was no doubt at all in her mind as to what had happened to Ruth. None at
  all...</p>

  <p>A long shudder ran through the girl. A sob retched from her tightened
  larynx. The pathetic bit of blood-smeared silk and leather dropped from her
  fingers, and she was on her knees, was peering under the bed. Her own shadow
  overlaid the floor with black threat. She saw the corded under layer of the
  antiquated bedstead, a frayed string hanging down, and nothing else.
  Nothing...</p>

  <p>Rose twisted. She could see every bit of the floor, all the big
  room...</p>

  <p>Eerie dread prickled her skin. The gaunt vacancy of the chamber gibbered
  terror at her. The moan she had heard, the patter of the obscene Thing that
  haunted this place of horror, had been in this room. She was sure of it,
  grisly sure. And nothing had come out of it. But there was nothing here.
  Nothing except the one blonde hair curled about a tooth of the white comb,
  and the gore-stained slipper. It was as if Ruth and the Thing both had
  vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>Muted, Negroid harmony came up to her through affrighted stillness, the
  dexterous tapping of nimble limbs, the rhythmic patting of merry palms. The
  sound pulled her reason from the dark abyss into which it was sliding. Lou
  was doing his tap-dance there, and up here his sister&mdash;Oh God! What was
  it that had happened to his sister? She had to call them! She had to tell
  them! She got a hand up to the softness of the bed in which she could never
  sleep again, tugged herself erect, turned to the door.</p>

  <p>Ted was standing in the doorway, his face pale, his forehead beaded with
  minuscule drops of sweat. "Rose!" he burst out. "You were gone so long,
  I&mdash;Good Lord! What's happened? What's scared you?"</p>

  <p>The girl's throat worked. "Ruth," she mouthed. "Ruth&mdash;she&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A glittering something flashed threadlike out of the hallway darkness,
  snaked around Ted's neck. He jerked sidewise out of the doorway, clawing at
  his throat. She heard the pound of his falling body outside, lunged through
  the door. Light streamed through, but its edges were somehow clean-cut, and
  to one side where Ted struggled the blackness was unrelieved.</p>

  <p>A bestial something snarled. The garroted man gurgled, threshed. Rose
  whirled to the struggle, threw herself at it. Her hands found something alive
  in the darkness, flesh and bone, cloth-covered but utterly unjointed. It
  flailed club-like and jerked away from her clutching fingers. She remembered
  the kneeless legs of the dwarf in the closet door.</p>

  <p>The Thing was sprawled atop Ted's tossing back, but it seemed to be arched
  upward, and its stretched arms ended in tight fists from which a twisted wire
  was tautly stretched. Feeling this, Rose knew where the Thing's face must be,
  and she beat at it, beat at clammy flesh in the dark, at lips snarled back,
  at fanged teeth that gashed her knuckles.</p>

  <p>The girl's furious onslaught seemed to make no impression on the lewdness
  that lay atop her lover and held tight the wire that was choking the life
  from him. Red rage exploded in her brain, turned to primal fury. She was
  primeval woman now, battling for her mate. She was a jungle female,
  scratching, gouging...</p>

  <p>Her thumb found an eye, dug in. The Thing screamed piercingly. Whirled.
  Its arm pounded against her chest, sent her skidding down the hall. She
  twisted, pulled erect, and found voice at last.</p>

  <p>"Help!" she screamed. "Help!"</p>

  <p>Shouts answered from below, and feet pounded upward. She hurled herself
  back across the light shaft from the open door. But no fighting fury met her.
  There was only Ted, limp on the floor, and the scutter of small feet whisking
  away.</p>

  <p>"Rose!" George yelled. "Where are you?" A flashlight slithered through the
  blackness. People were all about her. Someone was lifting her from Ted's
  horribly crumpled body, and someone was cursing in a low monotone.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE LEGLESS CORPSE</h2>

  <p class="first">ROSE gulped water from a glass that was against her lips,
  and opened her eyes. She didn't know she had fainted, but after she had
  pointed to the door of her bedroom her stomach had seemed to turn over, and
  pale, staring faces to have blurred in a crazed Witch's Dance.</p>

  <p>"I'm all right," she managed to say now to Mary, who was leaning over her.
  "Let me alone."</p>

  <p>She was in a chair in her room because they had put Ted on the bed. Dick
  Mays was bending over him and all she could see of Ted was his shoes and the
  black smear they had made on the white spread. She pushed herself up from the
  chair, and started to walk toward him. Mary got out of her way, and she saw
  Ted's awfully white face, the red line around his neck.</p>

  <p>Dick lifted his head. "He's coming around," he said. "He'll be okay in a
  few minutes, but it was a close call." Mays was in fourth year medical school
  and he ought to know. He turned to her.</p>

  <p>"Hey," he said. "What are you doing on your feet? You'll drop if you move
  around, and I can't afford to spend time on you. I have to go take care of my
  other patient."</p>

  <p>The pain in Rose's chest, where the Thing had hit her, made it hard for
  her to talk. "Your&mdash;other patient? Who?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Wayne. She went out like a light when you screamed. She's on the
  couch downstairs. I gave her a shot of the digitalin Freea found in her room,
  but it doesn't seem to have done much good. Freea's down there with her.
  She's a nurse, you know, from St. Vincent's."</p>

  <p>"Not alone, Dick!" Rose gasped. "Freea's not down there alone?"</p>

  <p>The man's lip twitched. "No. The Negro is down there too. He insists
  they'll be all right as long as he's with them, and Mr. Wayne agreed."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wayne! Where is he, Dick? And where's George?"</p>

  <p>Dick pulled the back of his hand across his clammy forehead, and his eyes
  slid away from her, slid to Mary. Behind her, Rose heard the young matron
  whimper behind her. Her hand lashed out, dug into Mays' forearm. "Where are
  they, Dick? What's happened to them?"</p>

  <p>The embryo medico's lips were a bluish white. "Nothing. Nothing that I
  know of. They're around the house somewhere, looking for Ruth and&mdash;and
  Lou."</p>

  <p>"Lou!" Rose thought she screamed the name, but the sound she made was only
  a rasping gasp. "Lou! What&mdash;how&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He was talking to Miss Wayne when she keeled over, and caught her. He
  didn't come with us. George and I carried Ted&mdash;in here. The girls
  brought you in. Then we noticed that Lou wasn't with us, and George went down
  to see why.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't in the drawing-room; he wasn't anywhere. Mr. Wayne was in the
  back of the first floor when it happened. He didn't see Snell go that way and
  he couldn't have come upstairs without our seeing him. He's just vanished off
  the face of the earth, like&mdash;like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Like Ruth! Dick, there's something horrible going on here, and I know
  what it is." Rose had decided. "I know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A scream cut her off, a woman's piercing, horror-shrilled scream from
  below! It wailed to a crescendo of terror, faded to a sob. Before Rose could
  shake off the nightmare paralysis that seized her Dick had whirled, and with
  a choked "Freea," plunged into the corridor.</p>

  <p>Rose got control of her legs. Mary snatched at her arm. "Don't go," she
  squealed. "Don't leave me alone."</p>

  <p>The girl pulled away from the detaining fingers, threw herself through the
  door, whirled after the man.</p>

  <p>Halfway down the stairs her heel caught. She toppled, arced through the
  air for the rest of the flight, crashed to the floor at its end.
  Half-stunned, she rolled there in agony, and saw the portieres still swaying
  with the impetus of Dick's passage through them. Then she saw where the dim
  luminance of the hall-lamp glinted redly on the curving edge of a wet pool
  that spread slowly from beneath those portieres...</p>

  <p>Feet pounded overhead. From the passage to the kitchen came the
  stiff-legged thumping of Roger Wayne's approach. Rose pulled herself up by
  the newel-post, swayed, was running across the little space between the stair
  bottom and the curtains, had thrust through them.</p>

  <p>Her feet went out from under her in slippery wetness and she toppled
  again. Her hand, instinctively thrust downward to save herself, struck human
  flesh, clammy and shuddersome. She saw a face beneath her own, Lou Snell's
  face, the eyes glassy. She came down on his twisted body, rolled off it. She
  lifted to her knees, and stared at horror incarnate.</p>

  <p>It was Lou, who lay there&mdash;lanky, good-humored Lou. But he was lanky
  no longer. He was a horrible, <i>legless</i> corpse. No, not quite legless.
  There were stumps below his waist, unjointed short stumps cut off just above
  the knees. From their raw, red ends blood still oozed in a carmine, grisly
  stream to feed the pool that had tripped her.</p>

  <p>Across the room Freea Tainton was still screaming, her high-pitched voice
  an unending ghastly shrilling. George Parker burst in, staggered against the
  door-jamb, retched. Rose twisted, saw Freea's tall, willowy form quivering
  like a harp-string struck by a hammer, saw her mouth cavernously open and
  black flames of madness in her bulging eyes.</p>

  <p>Dick Mays reached her. His arm jerked up, lashed out. <i>Smack!</i> His
  open hand stung Freea's cheek, and the report was like a pistol shot. The
  astounding act lifted Rose to her feet. She started across the long room
  toward the man, reaching for him. Had he, too, gone crazy with horror? Were
  they all insane?</p>

  <p>But Freea's crazed screaming stopped, and although the mark of Dick's
  fingers was scarlet against the ghastly white of her face, the madness was
  gone from her eyes. Dick was crowded close up against her; his fingers were
  tight around her wrist, and he was saying, "Freea! How did he get here? Where
  from?"</p>

  <p>"Through the curtains." The words were a horrified whisper from between
  lips that were an orange gash across a pallid mask. "He fell through the
  curtains and lay there..."</p>

  <p>"Did you see anyone? Did you see who threw him in?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't&mdash;No! No one. He&mdash;he just came through as if he
  were a little man walking in, and then he fell and I saw his legs.
  Oh&mdash;God! I saw that his legs weren't there. Dick! His legs..." She
  snatched at Mays, gibbering.</p>

  <p>"Steady! Steady Freea! You've seen lots worse than that in the hospital.
  Pull yourself together. You've got a patient to attend to. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A patient!" Abruptly she was laughing, laughing hysterically, and somehow
  her laugh was worse than her scream had been. "Look! There's my
  patient..."</p>

  <p>She jerked around, pointed. Dick swung in the direction of her gesture.
  Rose followed his gaze.</p>

  <p>No...The composed, wax-like form on the rose-upholstered sofa was not
  Freea's patient. Loretta Wayne would never be anyone's patient again.</p>

  <p>"She went out ten minutes ago and I sent Isaiah to call you. Why didn't
  you come? Dick! Why didn't you come?" Freea's throaty voice was more
  controlled now, but still edged with hysteria.</p>

  <p>"He never came for me. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He was looking for me," a voice behind them said.</p>

  <p>They whirled. They had not noticed Wayne coming into the room, but there
  he was, standing just over Lou's mutilated corpse. The shambles at his feet,
  the death of his sister, seemed to make no difference in his appearance.
  Black coated, black throated, he was poised, suave, utterly without
  expression. Except that the nostrils of his thin, straight nose flared a bit,
  so that the red inner membrane showed, and the torture in his eyes was more
  poignant.</p>

  <p>That coldness, that emotionless disregard of all the horror about him, his
  evidently firm intention still to cover up the dread thing behind it all
  fired Rose with a sudden rage. She swung around, plunged across the room to
  him, had him by the wrist. "In the name of God, Mr. Wayne," she cried, "how
  long are you going to keep this up? How long are you going to let that Thing
  run loose? Tell them! Tell them about it! Can't you understand it's the only
  way to stop all this killing, all this horror? Are you mad&mdash;mad to think
  you can still hide it?"</p>

  <p>Wayne did not resist her clutch on his bony wrist, but his eyes narrowed
  slightly, and his lips curled. "What do you mean?" he said smoothly. "I know
  no more about what is going on here than you do."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" The vehemence of her rage tore her throat as she spat it at
  him. "You lie! That Thing you have hidden in the cellar did this!" Her hand
  jerked down to the legless cadaver. "That hairless, legless dwarf stole Ruth
  and tried to kill Ted. You know it."</p>

  <p>She twisted to the others, to the staring George, and Dick, and Freea.
  "There was a monster born to the Waynes, long ago, a horrible Thing, deformed
  and mindless. They hid it, these proud Waynes, hid what they thought was
  their shame from the world. They shut themselves up in this old house and
  withdrew themselves from the world, so that no one would suspect their
  secret. When the father and mother who had brought that Thing into the world
  died, Loretta and Roger, here, kicked their only sister out of the house, and
  disowned her because she insisted the time had come to be rid of their
  slavery to that crazed fetish. She&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Wayne thundered, his frigidity melted at last. "Stop that insane,
  mad story. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Insane, is it? Mad, is it?" Rose jerked back to him, and her face was
  twisted with passion, with fury. "Then what is it you keep in the cellar? Why
  do you keep its door locked with a key only you possess? I dare you to open
  that door. I dare you to take us down there and show us what it is that's so
  precious you must keep it locked up. You can do it now. They know your
  secret. I've told it to them, and they know it, and there's no use hiding it
  from them any longer."</p>

  <p>The color drained from Wayne's face, so that it was a mask of white clay
  in which his dark eyes glowed like burning coals. His hand jerked up, as if
  to strike Rose, and George flung an arm across in fronts of her to ward off
  the blow. But Wayne's hand went to his pocket instead, came out with the iron
  key with which she had seen him lock the basement door.</p>

  <p>"Will that convince you?" he asked. The words oozed from his livid lips as
  the blood seeped from the ragged stumps of what once were Lou Snell's long
  legs. "Is that all you want? Here then. Go and look." He thrust the key at
  her, and the iron seemed alive in her fingers as she took it, seemed to burn
  them with cold fire. "Go. And look. And leave me alone with my dead."</p>

  <p>He gave her the key, and the startling words dripped from his lips, and he
  seemed to have forgotten her, to have forgotten them all as he started
  forward. They made a passage for him as he stalked between them with that
  strange, awkward walk of his, stumped down the long room and stood statuesque
  above where his sister lay so starkly still.</p>

  <p>The candles guttered overhead and all about the high-ceiled room, and the
  shadows they could not quite dispel lurked in hidden corners. Rose followed
  the others out into the hall, treading in spite of herself with that peculiar
  hush with which one walks in the presence of grief. The great velvet
  portieres dropped behind with a muted swish, as if they too were weighted
  with mourning.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do?" Dick Mays whispered. "Good Lord! What!"</p>

  <p>Rose jerked to him. "Do! I don't know what the rest of you are going to
  do, but I'm going to see what's down in the cellar. I have the key and I'm
  using it."</p>

  <p>"You're crazy," George snapped, round spots of red at the points of his
  high cheekbones the only color relieving the greyness of his drawn visage.
  "I'm going upstairs to get Mary and I'm taking her out of this house. And the
  rest of you had better follow us before you're where Ruth and Lou are." He
  whipped away, stumbled up the stairs, vanished.</p>

  <p>"The yellow cur," Dick muttered. "Let him go. I'm with you, Rose. I want a
  look-see into that cellar too."</p>

  <p>"Come on then. Come on." Rose was hurrying down the narrow passage, Dick
  close behind her. Freea, forgotten, trailed disconsolately in the rear. Rose
  whisked past the door, now closed, of the closet where she had so narrowly
  escaped horror not many hours before. She reached that other, further door,
  and fumbled the key into its lock.</p>

  <p>But not yet was she to turn that key, not yet to probe the mysteries
  below.</p>

  <p>For just then, the hinges of the kitchen door, at the end of the passage,
  grated. Rose looked around, saw that the door was slowly opening. She saw the
  widening slit that let through lurid, dancing light from the great range
  beyond, saw a white hand jagging the edge of that slit.</p>

  <p>She froze as the portal came fully open, and revealed&mdash;Ruth
  Snell!</p>

  <p>But what a Ruth! She was stark naked, and long, scarlet wheals striped her
  pink body from shoulders down across firm, globular breasts, down her
  quivering, pain-narrowed abdomen and along her columnar legs. Her once-white
  face was a criss-crossed mask of red-oozing gashes. Her hair, the blonde hair
  that once had been her glory, was a blood-matted cap hugged tight to her
  scalp, and from under that soul-shattering cap, from out of dark,
  <i>lidless</i> sockets, eyes stared that were pits, deep pits of hell.</p>

  <p>One hand still clutched the door-edge. The other was crooked, and in the
  crook a doll lay, a doll that was fashioned seemingly from a greasy pot rag.
  And from the nipple of the breast to which Ruth held it a slow drop of blood
  welled and fell onto the black ball that was the doll's head, just where its
  mouth should be.</p>

  <p>Freea's shriek, behind Rose, was straight from the limbo of madness
  itself. That shriek came again, but it was further off, and Rose heard a
  quick patter of feet running away. She heard Dick shout "Freea. Wait!" She
  heard his feet pound away, heard the great entrance door squeal open and
  pound shut.</p>

  <p>Swaying, every cell of her body screaming unutterable horror, she knew
  that she was alone with that which stood in the kitchen doorway and crooned a
  pain-edged lullaby, and nursed a grease-blackened doll on blood.</p>

  <p>Where Rose found the strength for what she did then, from what unknown
  well of courage, she never knew. But find it she did. She straightened, and
  though what she said choked her, she got it out.</p>

  <p>"Ruth," she said. "Ruth, dear. We've been looking for you. Where have you
  been?" She moved toward that stark image, hand out, and touched it.
  "Ruth..."</p>

  <p>Somehow that touch must have reached through the haze with which the
  blonde girl's mind had shielded itself from pain and terror, for a long
  shudder ran through her, and she looked up from the doll. Momentarily her
  eyes were almost sane.</p>

  <p>"In Hell," she mumbled. "I've been in Hell. See that pretty baby I found
  there..." She held the loathsome thing up, dancing it as a proud mother
  might. "Isn't it sweet, Rose? Isn't it cute?"</p>

  <p>"Ruth!" Rose was herself fighting against the gibbering imps of insanity.
  "Ruth! Listen to me. Who did that to you? Who cut you like that?"</p>

  <p>"Cut me!" Ruth looked bewildered. "Oh yes. The&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Metal flashed past Rose, soughed as it struck flesh. A black knife-handle
  vibrated, like a gruesome pendant, in Ruth's throat. Blood spurted around it.
  Like a gashed meal sack, the torture-crazed girl collapsed slowly in the
  doorway&mdash;infinitely slowly, till at length she sprawled, a limp,
  motionless figure on the threshold.</p>

  <p>Rose whirled to meet an expected attack. The passage at whose end she was,
  its widening into the mansion's entrance foyer, danced crazily before her
  eyes, and she sensed movement out there.</p>

  <p>Then she could see clearly. The passage and the hall were vacant! More
  ominously than if some assailant had haunched there to spring upon her and
  kill, there was utterly no one there. And there was no movement except for
  the tiny sway of the curtains, stirred by the wind.</p>

  <p>But was it wind that stirred? As Rose crouched there, rigid with cold
  dread, a new thought coiled pallid tendrils of apprehension about her and
  stroked her spine with gelid fingers of fear. Behind the mask of those
  portieres a desecrated corpse lay weltering in a pool of its own blood, and a
  second was stiff and quiet in a longed-for peace. But there was another
  there, alive and able-bodied, who might have slipped out, thrown the knife
  that had cut off Ruth's revelation, slipped back in the instant before she
  had turned. Wayne! Roger Wayne! Was he the killer? Was it he, fighting still
  to preserve the secret of the house against all odds? Had the anguished years
  brought him at last to murder?</p>

  <p>Even then the girl's instinct rejected the suggestion reason forced on
  her. That distinguished gentleman, who had immured himself in a living death
  to satisfy what he conceived as an obligation of honor, no matter how false
  that conception might be...</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, inching forward on silent feet, Rose crept noiselessly
  through the dimness and the dread of that foyer to the screening curtains.
  She must look, she must see what he was doing. Perhaps she might surprise him
  in some betraying act.</p>

  <p>She reached the portieres, put out a hand to their velvet stiffness,
  stiffer now for the dried blood that edged their hem. With infinite slowness,
  avoiding even the whisper of fabric against fabric, she moved that hand to
  make a slit.</p>

  <p>There was no sound beyond them. Apprehension tightened about her. What
  could that utter silence mean? Had the killer taken him too? Had the monster
  turned at last on the brother who had nurtured him through the long
  years?</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; CRUCIFIED</h2>

  <p class="first">FLICKERING candle-light at length seeped through the
  aperture Rose had made. Most of the candles had burned out, and the great
  room was shadowy. Rose's glance fled by the vague dreadful mound just within
  the threshold, probed the vast dimness beyond. At the other end was the sofa
  on which Loretta Wayne was outstretched in her last, dreamless sleep. Two
  tall candles were arranged on a small table at her head, two more at her
  feet. Their meeting rays outlined the placid, wax-like form of the old lady,
  laid luminance across her face from which death had erased the lines of
  long-endured pain and left only a wistful, quiet smile. Their glimmer rested
  like a benediction on the dark figure kneeling at that improvised bier,
  shoulders bent in a posture of infinite grief, head bowed and resting on the
  sofa-edge so that only the black hair shot with grey was visible.</p>

  <p>So poignant was the sorrow implicit in that kneeling, bowed form, so
  eloquently did it speak of grief and hopelessness, that despite the dread and
  terror through which she had passed Rose momentarily was conscious only of a
  stab of sympathy for the man left alone with the horror that had made of his
  life an endless nightmare. Almost unendurable it had been, with the
  sweet-faced gentle woman to help him bear it. What would it be now, with only
  that monster to keep him company in the moldering house? To look upon this
  man's Golgotha were almost sacrilege. She let the curtain drop...</p>

  <p>And heard from behind her a slow <i>bump, bump, bump!</i> Not a footfall,
  but the <i>thud, thud</i> of something soft, something queasily soft, falling
  step by step down the long stairs. <i>Bump. Bump. Bump.</i> Oh God! What now?
  What unearthly peril was coming down upon her now? She twisted to the
  sound.</p>

  <p><i>Bump. Bump. Bump.</i> With a horrible limpness that told there was no
  life within it, a body came out of the gloom of the staircase's lift, rolled,
  and thudded down another step. <i>Bump.</i> Rolled over again, arced flaccid
  arms in a grisly seeming of life, dropped again.</p>

  <p><i>Bump.</i> It was a man, that was all she could see in the darkness
  through which it tumbled. A man! <i>Bump. Bump. Bump.</i> Ted? Oh God! Oh
  Good God! Was it Ted? Was the lifeless thing rolling, bumping down the stairs
  her lover?</p>

  <p>In that instant it was as if the doom pervading the moldering mansion had
  materialized into a gigantic hand that came down upon her, crushing her to
  the floor, flattening her against the decaying boards, holding her there
  helpless to move, to scream, to do anything but stare at the floundering body
  that bumped down out of the dark evil above, down into the glimmer of wan
  light spread on the floor before her. It reached the bottom step, face down.
  It almost stopped. The impetus that had sent it down to her was not quite
  spent. It rolled over once more, slowly, rolled over and settled as if tired,
  deadly tired, just off the step.</p>

  <p>It was scarcely human&mdash;the wrenched, broken thing sprawling there in
  a pool of pale luminance that half concealed, half revealed the unnatural,
  awkward jumble of its limbs and torso, the twisted wire half-buried in its
  neck, the distorted face between whose black lips, wide-stretched in a
  humorless grin, a black tongue jutted and out of whose empurpled gruesomeness
  eyes bulged like plum pits squeezed from their pulp. It was scarcely human,
  but once it had been a man. George Parker!</p>

  <p>Not Ted! Thank God! Not Ted! Crazed laughter vibrated in Rose's throat at
  the realization, and at once horror struck at her that she should feel such
  relief, such utter thankfulness while her friend lay before her twisted in
  grisly, tortured death. Horror struck at her, and still mad laughter stayed
  in her brain.</p>

  <p><i>But she knew now that it was no longer her own laughter! It was coming
  down from above, from the darkness of the landing above, where, black against
  darkness, a foreshortened, incredible thing laughed shrilly and capered like
  a child who has played a childish prank!</i></p>

  <p>Rose's head jerked up to that nightmare Thing dancing in high glee above
  the destruction it had wrought, and her blood ran cold with horror. Even as
  she glimpsed it a final peal of mocking, cracked laughter echoed in the
  quivering air of that house of ancient evil, and the dwarf of the malformed
  body and high-domed, hairless head twisted and scampered off down the
  corridor. The small pattering of its merry feet rattled down the hall above
  and suddenly stopped. And she knew that it had gone again into her
  room&mdash;<i>into the room where Ted, her Ted, lay wounded and
  helpless!</i></p>

  <p>The rigidity of nightmare terror held Rose immovable for a long moment.
  Then a sound jerked her around, the scrape of an opening door. The entrance
  door was ajar, and old Isaiah was in the aperture.</p>

  <p>"Missie," he whispered huskily. "Missie Lynn. Come! Yoh kin git out
  now."</p>

  <p>The door was open, beyond it lay the clean air of the open fields. She
  need take only a step, one step, to release, to safety. But Rose turned away,
  not bothering even to answer, leaped stairward.</p>

  <p>Outside lay safety, but her lover was above, and he was in danger. In
  danger! Oh God! Was she too late? Had the monstrous dwarf already...? Rose
  shut her mind to the shattering thought as the stairs pounded beneath her
  feet, as the third step creaked, as she twisted into the long corridor and
  flew down its Stygian length.</p>

  <p>She reached the door of her room. It was shut. Tight shut. She grabbed for
  its knob, missed, grabbed again and clutched it. A sudden long wail, wrenched
  from a pain-shriveled throat by unendurable torment, sirened from within.
  Rose twisted the knob. The portal gave way, shot inwards, catapulting her in
  with its sudden yielding. She sprawled, skidded across the floor, crashed
  against a leg of the heavy bedstead, rolled, exploded to her feet.</p>

  <p>Though the lamp was out an eerie radiance filled the chamber. Sharp-edged
  luminance from the window lay across the floor, and its cant-sided diamond
  was blotted by an inky silhouette that jerked in rhythm to convulsive moans
  gibbering from behind Rose. She whirled around to that fearsome yammer. She
  saw, spread-eagled across the wall-opening something at which Lucifer himself
  would have wept in pity, and a scream of pure horror burst her larynx.</p>

  <p>Mary Parker, crucified in the window, shrieked once more, arched in a
  terrific spasm that tore one pitiful hand from the driven spike that held it,
  and then was limp as merciful death released her.</p>

  <p>Rose swayed, tasted bitter retch in her mouth, felt the floor heave
  sickeningly under her. She pulled herself out of the wave of black oblivion
  surging up within her. She pulled her eyes from the grisly form in the
  window, fought nausea as she searched the room for Ted&mdash;for whatever the
  Thing had left of Ted.</p>

  <p>He wasn't there! Appallingly he wasn't anywhere in the room, although the
  bed was tousled, the blankets thrown from it to the floor, the mattress half
  off. A chair was on its side, broken-backed, a night-table was overturned.
  There were all the earmarks of a terrific struggle, but nowhere was the
  bronze-faced man she loved, nowhere here where he had to be.</p>

  <p>Abruptly then, from within the wall itself, the farther wall that was most
  in shadow, came the muffled, shrill laugh of the mad Thing that had spewed
  evil throughout this doomed house. <i>From within the wall!</i> Understanding
  flashed on Rose of how Ruth had vanished from this chamber to reappear below,
  of where Ted had gone.</p>

  <p>Some power without herself hurled the frenzied girl across the room,
  slammed her against that wall. No opening, no faintest break in its faded
  paper showed where the entrance to that secret passage might be. She clawed
  at the wall, ripped the paper from it with nails that broke and tore to the
  quick, and failed to reach her reeling brain with the torment of their
  tearing. The wall was blank, inscrutable, but still from behind it, far
  distant now, she heard the monster's grisly laughter, the fading patter of
  his going.</p>

  <p>She beat against the partition, pounded on it, kicked it in a frenzy of
  despair. She was a wild thing, a thing without reason, knowing only that her
  lover was in the power of the monster, and that the way to him was through
  this wall, and that somehow she must get to him, must help him. She pulled
  back from the wall a little way, rushed at it to batter it down with her
  head...</p>

  <p>A hand gripped her arm, stopped her in mid course! She whirled, spewing,
  spitting. But she withheld the flail of her curved talons at the sight of
  Roger Wayne's grave face, his melancholy eyes.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said. "My dear. That won't help. You can't tear that
  down."</p>

  <p>"But I must. I tell you I must. That Thing had Ted. I must get to
  him."</p>

  <p>"You cannot get to him." Wayne's arm went out in a hopeless gesture. "Once
  in there, there is no hope for him."</p>

  <p>Something clicked in Rose's desperate brain. Wayne could help her, of
  course he could help her; but he would not because, with his sister dead and
  his house in ruins about his feet, he still clung to his mono-maniacal denial
  of the monster's existence. The Waynes' secret must remain a secret though
  the world itself came to an end.</p>

  <p>But she knew, thank God she knew how to strip from him his crazed
  resistance to betrayal. "Mr. Wayne," she said, and was herself surprised at
  how coldly, how dispassionately she spoke. "You're going to help Ted. You've
  got to."</p>

  <p>His high brow wrinkled. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because Ted&mdash;is himself a Wayne. He is Philip T. Horn. Philip
  <i>Theodore</i> Horn. Oh, don't you understand?" Her voice rose again to
  shrillness. "Ted is your nephew, your sister's son. That is how I knew the
  story of the monster. That is why I came here, to try to accomplish a
  reconciliation between you." She drove the idea into him, seeing by the
  shadow clouding his eyes, the indecisive trembling of his lips, that he did
  not yet understand. "Ted is a Wayne." Her voice rose to shrillness. "A
  <i>Wayne.</i> And I am engaged to him, I am also a Wayne. There isn't any
  reason to hide anything from me. <i>I am a Wayne."</i></p>

  <p>It got through! "Come," he said, and stepped to the wall.</p>

  <p>What he did Rose could not quite see, but he fingered the design on the
  paper, here and there, and quite suddenly a panel slid aside with a rasping
  sound, and there was a black aperture where just now had been a solid
  wall.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said again, standing aside for her with instinctive courtesy.
  "Watch out for the steps."</p>

  <p>Rose went into the black opening, found descending stairs with groping
  feet, started down. The panel slid back into place behind her. Impenetrable
  darkness engulfed her, age-old dust clogged her nostrils, her throat; and the
  thump of Wayne's stiff-legged descent was a thunder behind her. She was going
  down into the monster's bailiwick, she was going down into the cellar where
  horror dwelt, but she was not afraid. She was not afraid for herself, only
  for what she might find below, only that she might be too late.</p>

  <p>And then, instantaneously, she <i>was</i> afraid for herself as bony hands
  gripped her from behind, and bony fingers slid around her throat and clamped
  tight, cutting off breath&mdash;and a harsh whisper hissed in her ear. "I've
  got you now. At last I have you where I want you." Terror seared her, and
  exploded into nothingness as a blow crashed against the side of her head,
  crashed her into oblivion.</p>

  <p>Rose weltered up through pain, through the pulse of pain in her head, and
  in her breasts&mdash;the throb of pain and despair in all her aching body.
  She lay on her back, on something cold and hard, and somewhere near tiny feet
  pattered busily. Pain shot through her; she groaned, and the slight effort
  redoubled it. She tried to lift a hand to her head.</p>

  <p>She only tried. She could not do it, for her wrists were bound to her
  flanks, her <i>naked</i> flanks. Her eyes flew open.</p>

  <p>A red and lurid light danced across rough ceiling beams from which dusty
  cobwebs swayed. She rolled her head. She was on an earthen floor,
  green-scummed, and across it, there where dripping stone joined the ground, a
  shadowed, motionless figure lay. Between it and her was a pit in the earth, a
  long, oblong pit.</p>

  <p>The light flared, and she saw what it was. A grave! A yawning grave
  waiting for&mdash;whom? Her eyes lifted again to the form lying so still on a
  long mound of loose earth into which a short-handled spade was thrust. The
  light flared still more brightly; she saw a face, clammy-white with the
  pallor of death; and suddenly her skin was an icy, crawling shiver. She knew
  now for whom that grave had been dug. For Ted!</p>

  <p>A harsh hand rasped along her flank, and someone chuckled. Someone said,
  "Awake, my pretty one? Are you awake?" A face was close over hers, the
  gargoylesque, denuded face of the monstrous dwarf, and loathsomely it was
  acrawl with lewd eagerness. "Rose! My sweet Rose. Mine at last. Are you
  awake?"</p>

  <p>Rose wanted to close her eyes against the fearful sight, but could not.
  She could not shut her eyes, she could not shut vision from her brain where
  horror hewed at the last tottering remnants of reason. Not even when the face
  came closer, and twisted, slavering lips drooled her a kiss.</p>

  <p>She shuddered, and the Thing jerked away. Wrath writhed in its weird
  countenance, struck red flame from its bloodshot eyes. "Still proud, eh?" it
  said. "Still too proud to love the legless monster." It slapped its twisted
  legs, whose tiny feet jutted horribly from where knees ought to be, slapped
  them with the flat of a long, heavy-bladed meat-cleaver that flashed in the
  lurid luminance of hell-fire lighting this pit of Hades. "Well, my dear, you
  won't be proud long. Not when you're like me. Not when <i>you're</i>
  legless."</p>

  <p>The scuttering movements of the monster made pattering sounds like that of
  a little child as it came back to her, but further down, nearer her feet. Its
  laugh was the merry laugh of a mischievous child. Its fingers loathsome on
  her slim calves.</p>

  <p>"Pretty legs. Such pretty legs. Almost a shame to cut them off." It was
  prattling to itself now. "But as long as she has legs she won't love me, so
  they'll have to go."</p>

  <p>God! Oh God! Oh merciless God! The monster's hideous intent burst on Rose
  full force and the realization exploded within her tortured mind, a
  cosmos-shattering burst of terror incarnate. With the fascination of a
  snake-doomed dove her eyes clung to the blood-smeared cleaver about whose
  handle the dwarf's bony hands were wrapped. She watched it rise with a slow
  lasciviousness that made of the turmoil within her a long-drawn agony.
  Straining futilely at the lashings about her arms and chest, she watched the
  keen-edged instrument of mutilation start downward, slowly at first, then
  faster and faster till its descent was a semicircle of scarlet arcing down to
  the quivering, shrinking flesh of her white thighs&mdash;to slice them
  through...</p>

  <p>It did not strike! Above her, metal clanged sharply!</p>

  <p>A black arc had spurted to meet the red one. The spade had crashed against
  the cleaver, had wrested it from the clutching fingers of the sadistic
  maniac. Before Rose was aware of her startling rescue from the awful maiming,
  a tall figure, a figure immeasurably tall by contrast to the dwarf's shrunken
  body, vaulted across her prostrate form and swooped down on the Wayne
  monster, merged with it in a maelstrom of snarling, bestial combat.</p>

  <p>"Ted!" the name shrieked from her torn throat. <i>"Ted!"</i> And suddenly
  darkness surged up into her skull, irresistibly, and the lurid light seemed
  to blink out. Blackness swooped in on her...</p>

  <p>Ted's kisses on her lips brought her to consciousness again. Seamed with
  pain, drawn and white, his face hovered above her, and his eyes were anxious.
  "Are you all right, dear?" The words gusted from him. "Rose, are you?"</p>

  <p>The tendrils of utter madness seemed reluctant to release their grip on
  her brain. It couldn't be. Ted was dead. She had seen him dead. Perhaps she
  also was dead.</p>

  <p>"It's all over, dear. He's done for. He won't do any more damage. Do you
  understand, the Wayne monster is dead, and we are safe."</p>

  <p>Sublimely unconscious of her nudeness, Rose sat up. "Dead?" She saw
  something in a corner, covered over with a grain sack, saw the slow dribble
  of blood from beneath it. "You&mdash;killed it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear. George ran into the bedroom, scared gutless. He'd just
  yammered out what had happened when the dwarf appeared from nowhere, knocked
  me out. Next thing I knew I awoke down here just in time to see his cleaver
  coming down on your legs. I threw the spade, and jumped him. Little as he
  was, he gave me an awful battle. Might have licked me if my hand hadn't
  happened to hit the axe and&mdash;well, there he is."</p>

  <p>Rose pulled her eyes away from the still mound, peered about the huge,
  bare cellar. "What is it, dear?" Ted asked. "What are you looking for?"</p>

  <p>"Roger Wayne. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The young man gestured to his victim. "There!"</p>

  <p>Fear flared again into the girl's consciousness. Good God! Was Ted's mind
  gone, had all they had endured made him mad? "Ted! What are you saying?"</p>

  <p>"Just that." The young man turned, picked up something Rose had missed
  seeing in her quick scrutiny of the cellar. "Roger Wayne was himself the
  monster. Look! Here's his wig. And&mdash;" What he displayed now, a thing of
  steel and leather straps and wire springs, was like a cruel torture device
  spawned in some twisted medieval mind&mdash;"this is what he wore to appear a
  normal man."</p>

  <p>Despite all the horror Roger Wayne had wrought, quick pity stirred in the
  girl's breast. "Oh the poor thing! The poor, poor thing! To wear that, even
  to put it on, must have been torture."</p>

  <p>Ted's teeth gritted. "I'll say it was. That's why he screamed so when the
  doctor was here. That's why he took it off and scampered around the house at
  night laughing for the sheer joy of temporary release from it."</p>

  <p>"Now I understand what happened last night," Rose said slowly. "Ted! The
  torture of wearing that thing drove him to the point of insanity. The torture
  and&mdash;after all he was human, with human feelings&mdash;his forced
  celibacy. Then I almost discovered him last night, and fainted, and he fell
  over me. I was only in my nightie, remember. <i>That</i> rocked his already
  shaken mind. And tonight we brought all the young people in, and Ruth flirted
  with him in that sensuous way of hers. Is it any wonder he went insane?"</p>

  <p>Ted nodded. "After he did for Ruth he wanted to kill me because you loved
  me, and he wanted to kill the others because you had told them the secret, or
  as much of it as my mother had told me, and he wanted to cut off your legs
  because that would make you like he was and his twisted brain thought that
  then you would love him. And, by Jupiter, he damn near accomplished it
  all!"</p>

  <p>"Almost!" Rose shuddered. And then, suddenly, a thought struck her. "Ted!"
  she exclaimed. "I can understand how he did everything else, by using this
  hidden passageway and perhaps another somewhere in the house. But I had just
  looked at him kneeling beside Loretta when George Parker's body came tumbling
  down the stairs, and I saw the&mdash;the dwarf up in the hall. He couldn't be
  in two places at once. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can't be. You saw him, Wayne, you say? Did he move? Talk?"</p>

  <p>"No. He was quite still. His head was bowed and he seemed to be
  praying."</p>

  <p>Ted Horn's face cleared. "Then it wasn't he, at all. It was this harness,
  and a cushion stuffed inside his coat, and his wig on top of that, making a
  clever dummy that fooled you while he slipped upstairs..."</p>

  <p>"And knifed Ruth, and killed George, and did all the rest of the damage.
  Oh Ted! It's all like a nightmare, a horrible, horrible nightmare. There is
  nothing real about it all, nothing..."</p>

  <p>"Except this." The youth's arms were about Rose, and he was holding her
  close to him, and what he said was barely audible because his lips moved
  tight against hers. "Our love is real, my rose of all desire. There is
  nothing more real in all the world. And its fire will soon burn out the
  memory of this night of horror, and there will be nothing left but you and
  me&mdash;alone together."</p>

  <p>The girl clung to her lover, and a strange peace salved the wounds of her
  body and soul. "You and I, Ted dear," she murmured. "You and I. Always
  together. But not&mdash;always&mdash;alone."</p>
