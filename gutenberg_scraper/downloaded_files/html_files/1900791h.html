<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. MOUTH OF THE CANYON</h2>

<p class="first">HE traveled steadily northward over a land of
grass that ran ever onward and faded at last into a farther
flatness his eyes could not see; and distance and openness and
emptiness were all around him. He crossed rivers turned to dust by
the beat of summer and fall and he slept where starlight found him,
in buffalo-rutted depressions, in willow coverts where the mourning
dove hovered, in endless acres of spice-strong sage whose dry
branches rustled before little winds; and sometimes through the
night came the wild and far-out murmur of an antelope band running
free.</p>

<p>He first saw the mountains as a darkness behind the horizon's
haze, three hundred miles away. They grew before him, bold and
black and high, and one day the trail which had carried him all the
way from Texas entered a canyon and suddenly near sundown he looked
behind and saw that the fair and open plain was gone.</p>

<p>The jaws of the mountains had closed upon him and the mountains
were around him, rough and old and massively somber from their
million centuries of survival. A river ran in its canyon beside the
road, and in the canyon was a wind freighted with the coolness of
high peaks, with the raw sharp smell of the mountains themselves;
and twilight's shadows broke and swirled like fog on the giant
knees of the mountains and the echoes of the river ran back through
a hollow stillness to re-echo on the sounding boards of unseen
canyon walls.</p>

<p>In all this there was a strangeness that stopped him and sent
its thready feeling into those places a man keeps his ancient
instincts, and his guard rose at once so that he was like a dog
bristling at things not known, yet very real. The pressure of the
mountain country, its secrecy, its hint of dark-hidden glens, its
massive indifference, was upon him. The horizons were gone and the
safety of the open land was gone and only the stars above remained
familiar. He sat still, keening the smells which were new and the
sounds which were different and watching shadows that had a
thickness and a motion like nothing in his experience&mdash;and
then he smiled a small, tight smile and rode on.</p>

<p>A steady growing sound was before him. Half an hour onward he
turned a bend and found that the canyon stopped sharp against the
barrier of a cliff two hundred feet high. Centered in the cliff was
a clear break perhaps forty feet wide out of which came the river
with a white turbulence that sparkled through the dark; and into
that same break ran the road, upward-climbing. There was a small
meadow here, and a roadhouse and a barn and a corral and a man
standing in the house's doorway. Above that doorway, on the second
floor, was a window at which a woman's face momentarily showed,
framed by lamplight. He looked up at her and saw the half-expectant
smile on her face just before she drew back.</p>

<p>The man in the doorway said: "If you're lookin' for supper, get
down."</p>

<p>Tracy Coleman remained in the saddle. A lamp moved through the
lower part of the house so that the man in the doorway was
silhouetted, his tub-like fatness, his huge bald head, his round
and smooth and sly face. "This Gateway?" asked Coleman.</p>

<p>"Gateway," said the man. "And this." he added, tapping his
chest, "is Luke Wall. You're lookin' at the Four-Bit House. A meal
is four bits. Lodgin' is four bits. It is a fancy of mine. When I
came here, climbin' out of that river like a man would climb out of
hell's own fiery pit, I had four bits in my pocket."</p>

<p>He was a talker and talkers were usually fools. But Coleman
reserved his judgment, for Luke Wall's conversation was like a
screen thrown quickly around other things. As he spoke idly on, his
eyes searched Coleman.</p>

<p>"Out of that river?" murmured Coleman. "From where?"</p>

<p>"From the same place those fellows started from," said Luke
Wall, and pointed into the meadow. Turning, Coleman saw a row of
white headboards in the darkness, marking graves side by side.
"They came down the river, too. Water's life most anywhere except
here. This water is death if it gets at you and it is always tryin'
to get at you. I'm the only man that ever ran the Cloud River gorge
and lived. Me and my four-bit piece. I was crossin' from Dan
Stuart's range to the Horsehead side and the current got me. I'm a
thousand years older than I look."</p>

<p>"Horsehead," said Coleman in his same soft and murmuring voice.
"How far's that?"</p>

<p>"A day by the road," said Luke Wall. Then a woman called from
the house, "Supper's ready," and Luke Wall ceased talking and
turned in the doorway to show a big Roman nose and heavy lips
against a moon-shaped face.</p>

<p>Down on the plain fall's warm air would be still clinging to the
earth; but here a mountain-damp wind blew steadily from the gorge.
Stepping from the saddle Coleman noted the three horses already at
the rack&mdash;a big roan, a little roan with a white star in its
forehead, and a buckskin; by habit he put their descriptions in the
back of his head. He took his own horse around to a watering trough
at the corner of the roadhouse and gave it a short drink and
loosened the cinches, meanwhile feeling the presence of some other
man or person in the shadows to the rear of the house. That made
two people who seemed anxious to see but not to be seen. It was
part of some kind of story. Coleman took his horse back to the rack
and stepped into the roadhouse.</p>

<p>Luke Wall sat with one other man at a table in the center of the
room; the other man lifted a rust-colored head and placed pale-blue
eyes on Coleman with a brief interest. An elderly woman came in
with a coffee pot and put it on the table and went away; there was
a fireplace at the end of the room and a bright fire burning.
Coleman sat down to eat.</p>

<p>The red-haired young man said: "You got the room fixed up,
Luke?"</p>

<p>The roadhouse keeper's face was yellow, his eyes round and
thick-lidded. He nodded. "But if she's going on through to War
Bonnet she won't want to stay overnight here, Ben."</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;maybe not. When she comes off the stage show her to
a room. Then I'll go up and talk to her."</p>

<p>"Show her to the room yourself."</p>

<p>"Never met her before," said Ben.</p>

<p>Luke Wall made a motion with his chin; he was an indifferent
spirit buried comfortably within broad layers of flesh. Boots
scraped by the front of the house and for a moment Coleman saw a
man pause near enough the doorway to be touched by the out-
reaching lamplight. His face came around, ruddy and self-content;
he took his measure of the three within the room and strolled
casually on. Two of the horses, Coleman heard, moved away with
him.</p>

<p>The red-headed Ben, his back turned to the doorway, had not seen
the man but he heard the horses depart. The expression of trouble
was replaced by a wise grin.</p>

<p>"You got odd company around here, Luke."</p>

<p>"So," said Luke Wall.</p>

<p>There was the sound of other horses wheeling rapidly into the
meadow and the lifted shout of a driver. "Hup, Queen&mdash;hup,
Babe!"</p>

<p>Excitement made a bright thin shift over Ben's features.</p>

<p>"Stage, Luke," he murmured, but did not move.</p>

<p>Coleman, having finished his supper, rose and walked through the
door. The big roan and the small roan with the star were gone. He
flattened his back to the roadhouse wall and pushed up his hat; he
rolled a cigarette, watching the sweaty bodies of the stage's four
horses turn black when they came into the beam of the house light.
The driver jumped down and flung open the stagecoach door. He said:
"Thirty minutes for supper," and walked into the roadhouse.</p>

<p>A woman glanced out from the coach door and turned a pair of
thoroughly cool eyes on Coleman. He had a cigarette in his fingers
at the moment; he dropped it and moved forward, offering his hand.
He took part of her weight as she swung lightly down and he heard
her brief "Thank you," as he stepped back. She was a dark woman in
a dust-gray dress which held her tightly at waist and breast. She
wore a small hat with a half veil on a mass of gloss-black hair
dropping in a long fall behind her head; her face was small and
exact, her features clear. The strong light shining against her
made her close her eyes and at the moment Coleman noted the ripe
and self-possessed curve of her mouth. She opened her eyes on him;
she gave him a straight glance and walked toward Luke Wall who now
came from the stage house.</p>

<p>"You'd probably be Valencia Wilder," he said.</p>

<p>Her voice was round and soft and reserved. She could, Coleman
thought, handle men as she pleased. "Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"Maybe," suggested Wall, "you might like to fresh-up before
eatin'. The room at the top of the stairs."</p>

<p>She nodded and passed Wall. But her mind was not finished with
Coleman; when she reached the doorway she turned her head and gave
him a deliberate glance and moved into the room, leaving behind her
a fragrance and the memory of her skirts' faint rustling. Coleman
saw the redheaded Ben standing inside, stiff and still. Ben said
nothing to the girl; he followed her with his eyes as she went up
the stairs and passed from sight.</p>

<p>Coleman reached for his tobacco and put a cigarette together. He
lighted it and he stood with the burning match cupped at his face,
fine short wrinkles coming around his eyes. He dropped the match
and put his foot on it, drew a long breath of smoke and moved on to
his horse. He leaned against the horse and smoked his cigarette
half through, remembering how this girl had appeared as she stepped
from the coach. The color of her eyes was the color of blue velvet,
almost black; there was a lot of knowledge in those eyes.</p>

<p>He led the horse to the trough, and on to the corral, removing
saddle and bridle. The sound of the river never let up; it was a
sledgehammer heartbeat in the chill, damp dark. One streak of
motion disturbed the shadows beyond the corral. He looked steadily
that way until he saw two people walk slowly side by side along the
margin of the river, and he heard the quick soft laughter of a
woman. He came back to the roadhouse's front room, laid his saddle
on a rack and hung up the bridle. The red-headed Ben had
disappeared. Luke Wall was in the yard unhitching the stage horses
and the driver, who had already bolted his supper, sat back in his
chair and gave out a great belch.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Ben Solvay started up the stairs as soon as Valencia Wilder closed
the door of her room. He knocked on the door, heard her voice and
entered. He left the door open so that she would not be afraid. He
removed his hat and he met her eyes and tried to conceal his
embarrassment. "I'm Ben Solvay," he said.</p>

<p>He admired her for her self-possessed silence as she studied
him. He had expected a plain woman plainly dressed, ill at ease
because of the strangeness of the thing they were doing; but she
was neat and to his eyes she was beautiful and nothing appeared to
trouble her. Even as he found himself gratefully shocked, he knew
everything was wrong. The black, still wisdom in her eyes greatly
disturbed him.</p>

<p>"I had you pictured differently in my mind," she said. "But I am
not disappointed. I was to have met you in War Bonnet. This isn't
War Bonnet, is it?"</p>

<p>"Thought I'd ride down and catch you here. War Bonnet's got more
people in it&mdash;and maybe they'd wonder why I had to introduce
myself to you one day and get married to you the next."</p>

<p>"You're thoughtful. I got that impression from your letters. You
can shut the door now."</p>

<p>He closed the door and put his back to it and he remained silent
while she appraised him, her head slightly to one side, her glance
seeming both sympathetic and critical.</p>

<p>"In none of your letters," she murmured, "did you ever really
say how it was you came to know about me."</p>

<p>His partial smile somewhat relieved the flat determination of
his plain, square face. All of his character was there for her to
see. The honesty she had commented on, the steadiness, the dry
practicalness&mdash;these were visible to her. He was not a man
with secrets beneath him. "Friend of mine came through this country
during the summer and told me a story about a fellow who had come
to Fort Loring from Arizona to start a ranch and make some money.
He made some money and sent back to Arizona for the girl he figured
to marry. She came up but the day before she got to Loring he was
killed. So she buried him. You were the girl."</p>

<p>He watched her to see if his talk brought back grief to her, but
all he saw was the unchanged interest of her eyes. She said: "Was
it pity that made you write?"</p>

<p>"It was something my friend said about you. You buried your man
and you stood at his grave and didn't cry. But you said this
country had cheated you so you'd stay and take your pay from it
somehow. I thought about that for a couple months. It stuck in my
mind&mdash;the kind of a girl you must be. So I wrote."</p>

<p>"I often wondered why you didn't make the trip down to Loring to
see me, instead of writing."</p>

<p>She discovered then the most characteristic side of Ben Solvay,
his painstaking consideration of all things. "There was no use of
my coming down there to take this first man out of your mind. You
buried something with him a second man couldn't get. So the second
man had to offer something different. Well, you said you'd stay in
this country and lick it. That stuck with me. You were a lone woman
gamblin' on prospects. So I wrote and offered you my prospects. A
letter was best for that. It could say everything straighter than I
could talk it to you."</p>

<p>"You were honest. You said all the worst things first."</p>

<p>"I put the prospects as clear as I could. I told you what I've
got and what life up here would be like for you. There's only a few
women in the Basin. Lonesome country. You'll never starve and
you'll never know meanness from me. One thing I can't
provide&mdash;which is the thing the other man meant to you."</p>

<p>She started to speak, looked at him carefully a moment, and said
nothing. Ben Solvay ventured an incomplete smile. "I know my
limits. I'm meant to do the ordinary things that have got to be
done. You can give me what a man must have if he's to live like a
human being. I can give you a way of staying in the country. Maybe
that will be enough." Then he added an afterthought which rather
startled her with its directness. "And maybe it won't be. This is
the turning-back point. You've seen me. It can end right here if
you wish."</p>

<p>The suggestion challenged her. "People get old, turning back,
and they get nowhere. I want something to show for my life." Once
more she placed on him her perceiving glance. "You are disappointed
in me."</p>

<p>"I expected less," he said, quite honestly. "I expected somebody
plain and practical, somebody used to the straight calico, which is
all I've got. You came from better than that. I can tell those
things. The bargain would be good for me but bad for you."</p>

<p>"You're wondering what I was and how I came this far from
Arizona?"</p>

<p>"You came to marry a man," he said.</p>

<p>She opened her mouth to answer him; and again she stayed the
answer and studied him, and at last said: "The past is past. If you
have not changed your mind..."</p>

<p>He dipped his head, staring at the floor, and be began to show
extra color. He wished her to see no uncertainty in him and he
owned a steady man's religious belief in keeping a bargain. This
bargain was with a woman and therefore all the more binding; yet he
had his uneasy doubts concerning her and, hard-pressed, he came
upon a reasonable excuse for delay. "I will not permit you to make
up your mind until you have had a long look at me. Ride on to War
Bonnet and put up at the Alma House. I'll see you every day for a
week. By then you'll know for certain."</p>

<p>She had never lost her sure command of the scene, and now she
said quietly: "I understand."</p>

<p>He flushed, now ashamed of his doubts. "You can have no idea
what the sight of a woman as beautiful as you are does to a man
like me. But if I took advantage of you&mdash;a week is short
enough time for you to see what you're getting into."</p>

<p>"Take me to supper," she said.</p>

<p>The stage driver stood impatiently and sourly at the doorway
when they came down the stairs, and he said: "Don't expect me to
wait."</p>

<p>Ben Solvay, having gone through a scene which left him in a poor
frame of mind, let go at the driver with his irritated voice,
"You'll wait. Jim."</p>

<p>The driver grumbled and left the room. Solvay moved after him,
more and more uncomfortable, leaving Valencia Wilder alone with her
meal. She stood up to the table and poured herself a cup of coffee
and walked to the fireplace as she drank it. Luke Wall made a
racket with the fresh horses in the yard and Coleman came into the
room, dipping his head at the door. He moved casually on until he
was near her. He took off his hat and laid it on the table; he
rolled up a smoke. "Going on to War Bonnet?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He lighted the cigarette, he stared at the bright leap of the
fire. Valencia Wilder moved by him to place the empty coffee cup on
the table. She stood at the table's end, her back to him; he
watched her shoulders lift. She seemed to be looking at the door
when she spoke: "That smoke smells good."</p>

<p>He turned and walked to her, looking down at the heavy shine of
the light on her hair. Outside, Luke Wall cursed the horses as he
hitched them and the river laid its never-ending drumming over the
meadow. "Long ride ahead of you," Coleman said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She turned her head to him, a shadowed unsmiling repression on
her face; her lips stirred and turned still. "Here," he said and
held the cigarette to her mouth. She took a slow, indrawn breath of
smoke and expelled it. She kept her glance on him. She said in a
half voice: "Thanks," and moved to the doorway.</p>

<p>He followed, he watched Ben Solvay hand her into the coach. As
the driver swung around the meadow her face showed at the little
window of the coach door; she smiled at Solvay and afterwards her
glance lifted and came to Coleman, the smile dying. The stage
rolled on toward the canyon's mouth.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
There were the sound of the river and the sound of the stage; then
as the stage left the yard and at once entered the jaws of the
gorge the sound of the river absorbed it. Tracy Coleman listened
carefully to that change, for the ways of the earth were close to
him and each day held its newness and each night its fresh mystery.
Ben Solvay stood solemn in the doorway's lamplight. Luke Wall came
up from the barn and paused. These three men were silent, ignoring
each other, and somewhere a new sound struggled out of the canyon's
guttering racket and in another few moments a pair of riders
trotted from the canyon, wheeling before the roadhouse.</p>

<p>One man wide and heavy on the saddle, past middle age and
showing gray hairs below his hat brim. The house light reached his
face and glittered against frosty blue eyes; his voice grabbed Luke
Wall and roughly used the tavernkeeper.</p>

<p>"My daughter been here?"</p>

<p>Wall was slow with his answer, as though he were framing it
beforehand in his head. The other rider was small and restless; he
waited and he listened and his glance roved the yard with steady
suspicion. Wall said: "Lately, Dan. But she rode on, sayin' she
might be back to put up overnight."</p>

<p>"Anybody else been through here?"</p>

<p>"The stage," said Wall.</p>

<p>The big man looked at the redhead. He said: "What you doing
here. Solvay?" Then he turned his eyes to Coleman and, not knowing
him, studied him. The small rider, still controlled by his
suspicions, left his saddle and strolled along the horse rack,
watching the ground. "Three, four, five horses been standin'
here."</p>

<p>Wall murmured: "You arguin' with what I said, Tap?"</p>

<p>The little rider straightened around. He didn't answer; he
looked up at the big man and the big man answered for him. "Get out
of the nettle patch, Luke."</p>

<p>"Take what I tell you or don't ask questions," said Wall.</p>

<p>The big man said: "Whose horse in the corral?"</p>

<p>Tracy Coleman spoke. "Mine."</p>

<p>"I didn't get your name."</p>

<p>"I didn't give it," answered Coleman. He saw the affront plow
deep into the other's temper. The big man had the earmarks of a
cattle owner all about him, with such a man's accustomed sense of
power and unchallenged authority. His broad face showed a vein-
netted redness, his broad mouth lay trap-tight as he considered
Coleman's implied rebuke. Presently he gave out a grudging
admission.</p>

<p>"Your privilege." Then he added a warning. "If I ever see you on
my range I'll ask you again and I'll get an answer."</p>

<p>"That may come," said Coleman, straight and idle against the
wall. Over at the edge of the meadow the shapes of the two people
he had earlier noticed moved discreetly through the blackness and
presently disappeared in or behind the barn. A little later one
shape came on from the barn, leading a horse, and moved in vaguest
outline toward the jaws of the gorge, disappearing.</p>

<p>"Drew Trumbo been down here, Luke?" asked the big man.</p>

<p>Luke Wall shrugged his shoulders. "That wouldn't be my affair.
Stuart."</p>

<p>The big man pulled his horse around, said, "Come on," to the
little rider with him, and rode toward the gorge. Ben Solvay said:
"I'll ride with you," and stepped to the saddle, following. Coleman
listened to the sound of these various travelers fade away. Damp
wind flowed from the gorge and the mountains were a vast heaving
outline against the pale-black sky. One star fell and the light of
its millions of years made a scratch on the heavens and died. He
said: "Who's the big fellow?"</p>

<p>"Dan Stuart," answered Wall and stepped into the house.</p>

<p>Coleman strolled toward the corral and paused there, watching
the dense up-and-down streak of darkness which was the mouth of the
gorge. His horse came to the edge of the corral and put its nose
through, reaching for him. He went around the corral to the barn
and came to a small door, standing open. He stepped through the
doorway and took a match from his pocket and struck it on a
thumbnail. The bright burst of light fell on the still shape of a
woman standing before him.</p>

<p>He killed the light at once, but he had the clearest memory of
her face and its alert, half-smiling expression. Her hair was a
deep-toned yellow and he remembered how straight she had been
standing. He said: "Better stay here a bit. Those fellows might
double back and take a second look."</p>

<p>The near melody of laughter was in her voice. "Did they ask for
me?"</p>

<p>"The big man did."</p>

<p>"Did he ask about anyone else?"</p>

<p>"The name of Drew Trumbo was mentioned."</p>

<p>There was a horse somewhere in the barn, grinding on its bit.
The rank smell of the barn was sweetened with the odor of fresh
hay. The girl walked over the packed-dirt floor and her voice held
its softly amused tone. "Why would they double back?"</p>

<p>"The oldest trick in the book. Maybe the big man wouldn't. But
he had a fellow with him with a sour-milk disposition. That fellow,
I judge, is a bloodhound."</p>

<p>"Tap," she murmured, her voice less amused. He swung about,
catching the short, sharp tattoo of a horse above the river tone;
and saw a single rider come before the stage house, dismount and
step inside. The girl's shoulder came beside him. "That's Tap," she
murmured. She was tall for a girl, the edge of her shoulder
touching him below his shoulder point. "Where," she said, "did you
learn about doubling back?"</p>

<p>"I have done it&mdash;and it's been done to me."</p>

<p>"If you're on the run," she said, with some doubt and some
reserve, "you're in the right country."</p>

<p>Tap came from the roadhouse, got into the saddle and turned back
to the gorge. Luke Wall appeared at the house's doorway, a huge
block against the light. "I think Tap's gone," said Coleman, "but
if I were you I'd still wait a little."</p>

<p>"You went out of your way&mdash;but thanks."</p>

<p>"Most of my troubles," he told her, "have come from going out of
my way." He left the barn and, keeping well away from the lanes of
house light, returned to the roadhouse. Luke Wall watched him come
forward, his face Chinese-blank; he stepped aside to let Coleman
into the house. Luke Wall's idle voice came after him. "Man that
gets tangled in the affairs of the Basin people never is a lucky
man. Take Room Three."</p>

<p>Coleman found the room and immediately went to bed. Just before
falling asleep he heard the girl's voice downstairs. She was
talking to Wall and she was laughing.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. CAMPFIRE ON THE DESERT</h2>

<p class="first">DAYLIGHT came across the sky in changing sheets of
color. Out on the desert, which was hidden from him by the knees of
the hills, sunlight would already be turning the gray soil warm but
here in the canyon the shadows hung on and the air was thin and raw
and bracing, containing the rich rank odors of the mountains. He
lugged his gear to the corral and saddled his horse; he stood by,
making up his morning smoke. The horse, fresh with the desire to
go, put a cold nose against him and pushed him aside, whereupon
Coleman stepped to the saddle, let the horse have its morning buck,
and turned to the gorge.</p>

<p>As soon as he entered it twilight settled about him and dampness
moved against him, and the roar of the water was a tumult around
him. The road lifted gradually from the river and the canyon walls
grew higher, now presenting a straight alley, now bending. Below
him the river battered against its rocks with a furious energy
which had, through the tens of thousands of years, worn this canyon
away.</p>

<p>A set of fresh tracks preceded him and these, he judged, marked
the girl's trail. He had heard her leave the roadhouse considerably
before daylight. Of her he thought a moment or so, visualizing her
face and her smile and closely remembering the sound of her voice.
Then he put all that from his head, for this was a strange country
to him and therefore bore strict watching. All up from Texas he had
thus studied the land, so that now he could draw a map upon the
ground of each river and creek he had crossed, each hill and pass,
each town and roadhouse; he could describe the quality of grass
along the trail, the conditions of summer water and winter shelter,
the brands of the various trail herds seen. There was this map in
his head, filling out day by day. The world was a natural world of
weather and grass and beef and of this world he was an attentive
scholar. Somewhere far east was another world, in this year of
1878, of which he heard vague rumors; in that world men lived
crowded together, worked according to the clock and surrendered
their freedom to authority placed above them; and all that made a
terrible picture of little souls sweating in an endless
treadmill.</p>

<p>At noon the road ran precariously between river and canyon rim,
with a thousand feet of space either way. During middle- afternoon
he reached a summit and passed through rough hills of pine; near
sunset he confronted a rolling plain surrounded on all sides by the
black rim of mountains. This was the Basin, a yellow sea of grass
cupped high in the hills. The grass plain itself was broken by low
ridges, so that he could not command a full view across it. Here
and there in the distance he saw cattle and here and there men
riding on fall roundup. Far to the left he observed again the slash
of the river. Beyond the river was more yellow grazing country
backed by timbered mountains.</p>

<p>He cooked bacon and coffee and sat at the edge of timber while
sunlight laid golden windrows across the forward land and sank
beyond the western escarpments. Twilight lingered longer than
seemed natural to a flatlands man. Proceeding through this twilight
and on into the dark he sighted the tawny core of a campfire. An
hour's riding brought him within a hundred yards of it and here he
stopped and sent out his call. "Hello, camp."</p>

<p>He received no immediate answer. Shapes of men sat backed
against the firelight and one shape slowly rose and slowly turned.
A chuck wagon stood near the fire, half a dozen horses were on
picket close by. Farther out on the plain lay the bulk of other
horses. A voice came to him at last, noncommittal and grudging:
"Come in."</p>

<p>He rode in, even then with a guard lifted against the rank and
hostile quality of that voice. Four men lay close to the fire, now
turning to look upon him, and one other man stood above the fire.
On that long lank one he placed his attention, on the loose and
dusty clothes hanging to a scarecrow frame, on the thin neck and
the narrow wedge of a face with its little flat ears and its
dust-reddened eyes. He surveyed Coleman with a dry and scheming
expression, with steady suspicion. He said, with ungracious
hospitality: "Light. Beans left in the pot."</p>

<p>"Had supper," said Coleman. He dropped to the ground and he
built a smoke and seemed thoroughly preoccupied by it, but was not.
He was seeing the crew, the young boy with the matted hair, the
older one with the faded, leaf-brown cheeks, the one whose
brilliantly green eyes sparkled above half a beard, the chunky-
shouldered man smoking a pipe. This last one idly poked a sage stem
into the fire and solemnly ignored Coleman. There wasn't any
sweetness in the outfit; it didn't hang together. There wasn't any
storyteller to soften up rankling dispositions at the end of a hard
day, there wasn't any easiness or fun. They sat still, self-wrapped
in private thoughts, alert to trouble, sullen toward him.</p>

<p>"What range am I on?" Coleman asked.</p>

<p>It was the old one with the brown-parched skin who finally said:
"Horsehead."</p>

<p>Coleman licked his cigarette and lighted it. The sour man
standing at the fire would be the foreman. He threw the match into
the flame and relaxed on an elbow. "Pretty stars," he murmured.
"This a Horsehead crew?"</p>

<p>The foreman shifted his long feet and spoke at last. "Horsehead
crew and no job open if that's whut you're after."</p>

<p>"Maybe I wouldn't like it here anyway," murmured Coleman,
"Country's colder than Texas. Kind of crowded in by mountains."</p>

<p>The young boy with the head of tangled hair showed a youth's
sudden intolerance of criticism. "Whut the hell keeps you here if
you don't like it?"</p>

<p>"That," said Coleman, still soft, "is scarcely your business,
son."</p>

<p>The boy showed his teeth in callow contempt. "Big mouth," he
said.</p>

<p>He was directly next to Coleman, seated on his blanket three
feet away. Coleman bent, drew his arm across his chest and swept it
over the distance. His open palm chopped the boy's open mouth with
a full-length swing that sent the other backward, stunned and
yelling; in another moment the youngster rolled like a cat, sprang
up and retreated toward the fire. He stepped into the fire and
ducked sidewise, spreading his legs apart. His long hair hung down
over his eyes and anger shook his arm when he pointed it at
Coleman. "I'll blow your guts&mdash;"</p>

<p>Coleman used his voice as he had used his hand. "You're a fool
standin' against that light, boy. Shut up."</p>

<p>The boy stood still. He let his arm fall slowly against his
side. He kept his feet apart and then he drew a hand over his
mouth. He stood futile in the light, a mass of humiliation, with
insufficient bottom to go through with what he had started. Nobody
else had taken up the quarrel. The lank foreman continued to watch.
The man with the beefy shoulders slightly turned, showing a face
whose left side had been plowed by a bullet. That one, Coleman
judged, had danger in him.</p>

<p>A rider moved rapidly in from the night, his voice coming on.
"Pairvent." He brought his horse to a standstill within the round
circle of the fire and said again, "George." The horse fiddled in
the dust and circled around; when the rider faced the light again
Coleman recognized him as the man who had been at Gateway, spooking
in the night. Coleman remembered the name Dan Stuart had used. Drew
Trumbo&mdash;that was his name.</p>

<p>Pairvent, the foreman, went around the fire until he stood near
Trumbo. Trumbo said: "We're cleaned up on Stuart's and my range.
You through here?"</p>

<p>"All through."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow the main roundup will finish Gunderson's west side,
near town. Then we're through. The owners will be meetin' in War
Bonnet. Be there around nine o'clock in the mornin'."</p>

<p>He had, on first approach, cast one incurious glance at the
group; and now cast another and discovered Coleman. His face showed
a break of recognition and for a moment he seemed inclined to speak
to Coleman. Then he thought better of it and moved out upon the
prairie. Beyond the firelight he halted, calling back, "One more
thing. George." Pairvent followed him, these two parleying in the
dark. The heavy-shouldered puncher again began to stab the fire
with his sage stem and the young lad slowly came hack to his
blankets and saddle, gathered them and moved around to the far side
of the blaze. Drew Trumbo set his horse into quick motion, scudding
away. Pairvent returned slowly into the light, his glance reaching
for Coleman. He stopped near Coleman, looking down. Suspicion was a
pinpoint of light in his recessed eyes.</p>

<p>"Pairvent?" murmured Coleman, "George Pairvent of
Horsehead?"</p>

<p>Distrust freshened in Pairvent and he backed away until he had
the fire on his left elbow. He stood still, his gathered muscles
straining his bony body, "That's right," he said, rustling the
words in his throat.</p>

<p>Coleman lifted a hand to the breast pocket of his coat and
pulled out a letter. He rocked forward and extended the letter the
full length of his arm, "Yours," he said.</p>

<p>Pairvent shoved a guarded question at him, "Where you from?"</p>

<p>"Texas."</p>

<p>The string-shaped foreman seized the letter. He drew away
watching Coleman as he opened it; and even then he grudged the
necessity of taking his eyes from Coleman, reading and looking up
and reading again. The chunky puncher with the sage stem watched
this with a growing interest. He smelled something, and the others
smelled something; they were all alert.</p>

<p>Pairvent folded the letter together and held it over the flame.
Coleman said at once: "That will change nothing. I'll keep it."</p>

<p>Pairvent dropped the letter on the ground. The corners of his
mouth formed deep angles. "Ray," he said to the chunky puncher with
the sage stem, "take the outfit back home at daylight." He circled
the chuck wagon and got his horse from picket and rode again to the
fire. He sat on the saddle, long looking at Coleman. Then he said:
"We'll see," and swung about, galloping away.</p>

<p>The chunky Ray tossed the sage stem into the fire. He had a
broad face and a chin built for battle; he was a big-lipped,
deliberate man with his eyes so near shut that he seemed to be
smiling. He looked over at Coleman, evidently full of speculation.
He yawned and used his boot to shove the dying coals of the fire
together, "Like poker with the deuces wild," he murmured.</p>

<p>Nobody answered him; he sat crouched over, staring at the fire
and deeply involved in his thoughts. Coleman rose and unsaddled his
horse and led it out on the grass, driving down a picket pin. He
came back, made up his bed from the saddle and the saddle blanket,
and settled to rest. The stars were fully showing, the air was
sharp and strong-scented. Near sleep he saw Ray still dreaming
before the fire.</p>

<p>At daybreak the Horsehead crew turned west to the river while
Coleman lined out northward toward War Bonnet over a beautiful land
of rolling grass separated by ridges into independent valleys. He
passed over one valley, rose through scented crests of pine, and
entered another valley, until at last he saw before him the great
wall of mountains which closed in the Basin. The river curved at
the foot of the wall; and here, beside the river and against the
mountain's sharp slopes, lay War Bonnet, the east-facing windows of
its two dozen buildings aflash with morning's strong sunlight.</p>

<p>He saw only a few people abroad on the street as he passed
stable and saloon and store and blacksmith shop and headed into a
rack before the narrow front of a restaurant. He had eaten
breakfast at the Horsehead chuck wagon; now after two hours' riding
he was hungry again, and so entered the restaurant and sat up to a
second breakfast and permitted himself to idle over his
coffee&mdash;a man taller than the average rider, heavier of bone
and more solid in chest and arm. Constant riding had trimmed him
lean; exposure to rain and sun and cold and dust had built within
him a reserve of vitality&mdash;and the vitality showed. On his
body were the marks of his trade in the shape of broken bones, and
here and there a white scar from some encounter or another with
cattle or horses or men. Never in his life had he known real
shelter or comfort, never had he felt complete security; and
therefore in him lived a philosophy of accepting the little moments
of rest and pleasure whenever they came, against the greater times
of trouble, against nights when there would be no sleep, against
the sudden climaxes which, though unseen ahead of him, were
nevertheless stationed along his career as inevitably as the days
on a calendar. Uncertainty was a star shining over him, guiding him
into strange ways, and because of that uncertainty he had learned
never to make long plans, never to harbor fear of the future and
never to sleep with a memory of the past.</p>

<p>He finished his coffee and bought a tinder-dry cigar; and stood
in the restaurant's doorway with the fragrance of the cigar cloudy
around his face. He had a head of black hair and a pair of eyes
half between violet and powder-gray overhung by black brows. His
nose was long and his mouth heavy and his skin, with all its
weathering, was fair and unwrinkled. He stood and walked as though
there were no hurry or strain in him and when he smiled he seemed
careless and unthinking; otherwise, in repose, his face had a faint
melancholy shadow upon it.</p>

<p>Loitering there, he saw riders move out of the yonder yellow
grass and come fast inward, singly, in pairs, in groups; and
presently the town took on life. He recognized Dan Stuart and Tap
as they arrived and later noticed Drew Trumbo come in alone. All
these men were owners or foremen. Coleman could sort them out as
precisely as he could sort out brands of cattle at a loading pen;
an owner always had an air. Most of them pulled in by the saloon
and entered for a drink, afterwards walking on to the hotel.
Somewhat later Coleman observed George Pairvent come to the
saloon's doorway and stand there. Coleman put away in his head the
fact that Pairvent did not join the owners at the hotel.</p>

<p>It was then a little after nine o'clock and sunlight and street
dust made a silk-silver haze against the day. Ben Solvay came from
a back quarter of town and racked before the hotel. He stood a
moment on the street, smoking a cigarette thoughtfully; he saw
Coleman and his eyes briefly acknowledged Coleman. Casting away his
cigarette with a definite gesture, as though his mind had been made
up, he entered the Alma Hotel. Coleman had now finished his cigar.
He dropped it and ground it beneath a foot and moved upon the Alma.
As he reached its doors he heard another horse run fast in from the
desert and turned to see Dan Stuart's daughter step from her horse
before it had entirely stopped.</p>

<p>Coleman, directly before her, lifted his hat. Her glance came to
him, showing slight surprise, "You're here," she murmured, and gave
him a thoughtful inspection. The spirit of this girl was light and
quick and the edge of a smile stood at the corners of her mouth
even when she was grave. She said: "You're taller than you seemed
last night," and walked on to the store. Coleman noticed how
carefully George Pairvent watched this scene from the saloon. He
remembered that as he entered the Alma.</p>

<p>The cattlemen were in the dining room beyond the lobby,
somebody's voice laying its heavy weight upon the group. Coleman
noticed Valencia Wilder in a corner chair, as composed as she had
been at Gateway. Ben Solvay stood before her with his hat in his
hand, soberly talking. Even as Solvay talked her glance came away
from him and met Coleman's eyes; after he reached the dining room's
doorway she still watched him.</p>

<p>Coleman saw that it was Dan Stuart who was standing at the end
of the dining room and flinging his naturally aggressive voice
toward the rest of the group. There were a dozen men here, bunched
up in two groups at opposite sides of the room, like the division
of a standing vote&mdash;side equally against side. He would have
speculated on this had not Dan Stuart, seeing him, thrown out a
warning.</p>

<p>"You're in the wrong place," he said, "This is a cattlemen's
meetin'."</p>

<p>"I'm in the right place," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"Representin' what outfit?"</p>

<p>"Horsehead," answered Coleman.</p>

<p>Change came over the room like sundown's cool wind. Dan Stuart
shook his head with an irritated impatience. Tap stared. He made a
pushing gesture at Coleman with his hand; he started toward
Coleman. Drew Trumbo, handsome in his flushed way, covertly
watched.</p>

<p>Stuart said: "George Pairvent represents Horsehead."</p>

<p>"A question occurs naturally to me," remarked Coleman, "If he
does, what's he doin' at the saloon instead of here?"</p>

<p>"That's something else," said Stuart and closed his big jaws
like a trap.</p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed Coleman and took from his pocket the same letter
he had earlier shown Pairvent, "And it also may be he once
represented Horsehead. He no longer does."</p>

<p>He opened the letter, feeling weight behind him; he looked about
and saw Ben Solvay at the doorway and in the lobby he noticed
Stuart's daughter, and other men now collecting. They were all
listening. "I'll just read this," he said.</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">To George Pairvent and the Basin:&mdash;<br>
<br>
It has come to my attention the last three years that my ranch on
Horsehead lacks management. I further feel, from information now
and then coming down the trail, that Horsehead has acquired a poor
reputation.<br>
<br>
Being an old man. I cannot personally come up to set things aright.
Nor have I sons to send. I am therefore putting Horsehead in the
hands of the best of my foremen. Tracy Coleman, to do with it as he
wishes and in whatever manner he wishes. From this notice forward
Tracy Coleman may be considered to be the owner.<br>
<br>
To all my old friends in the Basin, and particularly to Frank
DeLeon if he's still alive, my best howdy. And to all of them, so
long. The riding was fun and the world was fine. Now I'm an old dog
crawling into a thicket to die.<br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">Ben-Tim Howlett.</span></p>
<br>

<p>"Why," said somebody, "old Ben-Tim remembers me," and looking up
Coleman saw an older man run a hand across a pure-white set of
mustaches, "We were the first in the country. Ben-Tim and me. But
Ben-Tim always liked Texas best. So he went back."</p>

<p>This was the only remark, this touched recollection of an old-
timer who was apparently Frank DeLeon. Otherwise the cool current
ran strong against Tracy Coleman. He felt it push at him; he felt
his aloneness. He folded the letter and returned it to his pocket
"I'm representing Horsehead."</p>

<p>Dan Stuart shook his head, "Go back and tell Ben-Tim he let
Horsehead go too long. Tell him the Basin respects a man's rights
to a piece of range so long as he uses that range for beef, no
longer. Tell him he ran it from a distance too long and that now
he's got nothing to put on that grass, while other men here with
plenty of beef are cryin' for grass. It was free range when he came
here and it is still free range today. But free range is only for
the man that can show good use of it. Tell him he's no longer got
it. And he can't give you somethin' he hasn't got. The Basin will
split that grass among the men here. Go back and tell him
that."</p>

<p>"How," asked Tracy Coleman, "do you propose to split it?"</p>

<p>He thought then he knew what put these men into their two
separate groups; the question fell into a silence and the silence
remained, and he saw Dan Stuart look slowly around him and he saw
Drew Trumbo's face take on an odd expression, and the coldness
which had flowed so steadily against him seemed now to swirl among
them all. They had decided to break up Horsehead, but each man was
scheming for Horsehead.</p>

<p>"That," said Dan Stuart, "comes later. You're in the wrong game.
Ride on."</p>

<p>Coleman put both hands in his pockets and looked above the
group, beyond them to a window. Out through the window he saw white
clouds bright in the sunshine, and the ragged pine crests of the
hills. Each day brought its troubles and a man seldom had a
warning; sometimes he had to make an answer on the fall of the
moment and to hold to that answer until the sky fell in.</p>

<p>"It was a long ride up the trail," he said, "and it would be a
longer ride back. I came to take over Horsehead, and that I will
do. As long as one Horsehead cow walks on that grass it remains
Horsehead grass. If there is no cow to eat it. I will turn my horse
upon it. If I lose my horse I'll stand on that grass with my own
two legs and claim it."</p>

<p>Dan Stuart, unaccustomed to resistance, shouted back, "The
moment you set foot on Horsehead we will regard you as an outlaw,
to be treated as such!" Then, because he was a man with a powerful
temper and a will that would not be crossed, he permitted himself a
further, unguarded statement. "You'll be joinin' the rest of the
outlaws already there."</p>

<p>The cavalry-mustached Frank DeLeon said immediately: "I'd let
that remark die, Dan."</p>

<p>Dan Stuart may have regretted the remark, but he growled, "Let
it stand. Stay off Horsehead, Coleman. Otherwise the shape of a
tree and the shape of a rope starts walkin' with you."</p>

<p>Coleman did a strange thing. He smiled, and the smile roughened
his face and mildness went out of him. "It would be better if you
shot me down than to let me leave the hotel. If you open a war on
me there'll be fewer of us here at the next meetin'. I will be at
Horsehead Ranch by noon today. That man among you who sets the dogs
upon me&mdash;that man I will personally hunt down and destroy,
unless he gets at me first. I do not believe in beginnin' trouble
but if there is to be trouble I do not believe in mercy." He turned
and walked from the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. ON HORSEHEAD</h2>

<p class="first">CROSSING through a lobby half-filled with townsmen
and riders, Coleman noticed Dan Stuart's daughter, all the
liveliness gone from her. One man loitered in the doorway, so
engrossed that he made no attempt to step aside. Coleman paused,
waiting; the man made no move, and suddenly Coleman thrust him
aside with his arm and left the lobby.</p>

<p>Pairvent was still near the saloon. Coleman turned along the
loose boardwalk and came upon him. Pairvent never took his
suspecting eyes away; now, as on the night before, he drew his thin
muscles together and made himself ready for the trouble he never
ceased to expect.</p>

<p>"Last night," Coleman said, "you left camp on the run. You
figured to get yourself some help. Who'd you think would help you?
You've got no friends in that owners' crowd."</p>

<p>Pairvent's answer was a dry rustle. "You think so?"</p>

<p>The ranch owners and their foremen came from the Alma, drifting
to the horse racks, moving toward the saloon. Pairvent's glance
went to these men, searching them with a hard care; and as be stood
there, lank and strained like an animal undecided on attack or
flight, he seemed to keen the very air of town for an answer.
Stuart and Tap left War Bonnet in a run that raised little rolls of
dust behind and other men walked by Coleman into the saloon. Drew
Trumbo crossed the street afoot, cast a quick glance at Pairvent,
and went down a small alley.</p>

<p>All during the last hour Coleman had turned the problem of
Pairvent through his mind; and it was that quick glance between the
men&mdash;as revealing as speech&mdash;which made answer for him.
He knew then what he must do, "Go back to Horsehead," he said to
Pairvent, "I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>Pairvent, suspicious of every living thing, stared long at
Coleman; and at last he gave a curt nod and walked into the saloon.
Coleman turned back to his horse before the Alma. Ben Solvay waited
there for him, and said: "Like to see you for just a moment," and
beckoned him into the hotel.</p>

<p>The crowd had left the lobby. Valencia Wilder still sat in the
corner chair, quiet and small, but disturbing the air of the room
by her presence. She watched Coleman come up and as he stood above
her he noticed again the smoothness of her body within her dress,
the richness of her lips, the odd and still light of knowledge in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"This," said Ben Solvay, "is Valencia Wilder. And this man's
name is Coleman."</p>

<p>Coleman removed his bat before her. He met the steady onset of
her glance while Solvay went on with his dry, practical
conversation, "I heard you were takin' over Horsehead. It is a nice
house down there and an old Mexican woman who keeps care of
it&mdash;brought up long time ago by Ben-Tim Howlett." He paused a
moment, collecting his words carefully, "We expect to be married,
but not for a week or so. This hotel is no particular place for a
woman to stay. Tonight bein' payday the town will be full of
drunks. Horsehead is a fine place and the Mexican woman makes it
proper enough. Maybe you'd take Miss Wilder to Horsehead and let
her put up there as long as may be. It will relieve my mind."</p>

<p>Coleman studied Ben Solvay until the latter showed a trace of
embarrassment. Coleman was smiling, "My friend," he said, "you must
sleep sound at night."</p>

<p>The mind of Ben Solvay was entirely practical, "Sure," he said,
"but what's that got to do with this?"</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to know if Valencia Wilder had been
earlier aware of Solvay's idea. She continued to watch him and she
was silently saying something to him, her eyes widening into a full
glance.</p>

<p>"My pleasure," Coleman said, directly to her, "if it seems
suitable to you."</p>

<p>"I'll get a buckboard," Solvay murmured, and immediately left
the hotel.</p>

<p>Coleman took the time to build a cigarette. His lips were thick
at the centers and when he swiped the cigarette with his tongue his
teeth struck a white flash against the tan of his skin. His
cheekbones made flat weights high on his face. He lighted the
cigarette and looked at her, "His idea?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so." She watched his eyes throughout a continuing
silence, and then for the first time her directness wavered and she
dropped her glance, "Let's not start that way," she murmured.</p>

<p>Solvay returned and took up her small leather trunk from the
floor and lugged it through the doorway. Rising, Valencia Wilder
made a little gesture with her hands. She moved across the lobby
before him and, near the door, turned around, "You're
alone&mdash;and the rest of the country's against you."</p>

<p>"I am usually alone," he said.</p>

<p>"People," she said, "will try to get at you and break you. I
know about that. They have tried it against me. People are dogs. I
hope you fight them."</p>

<p>The features of the girl lighted with spirit. He was surprised
at her strong talk but he liked her better for what he had seen;
she stood for something. He took her arm and escorted her to the
buckboard and gave her a hand up. Ben Solvay climbed to the seat,
said, "See you on Horsehead," and put the team down the street at a
trot.</p>

<p>Other riders made their departure, leaving War Bonnet half-
empty. Coleman stepped to his saddle and turned out on the trail of
the buckboard. Pairvent was no longer before the saloon but as
Coleman put the street behind him he looked about and saw
Horsehead's ex-foreman step from a shed on the rear side of town,
toward which Drew Trumbo had earlier gone. Little pieces of
information like this, patiently accumulated, at last made up a
story. The buckboard traveled southwest under bright sunlight,
following two ruts which formed the road. The ranchers who had left
town now were fading into the grasslands in all directions before
Coleman. Deeper south he saw the blur of cattle trailing away.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Ann Stuart was in Mary van Hogh's dressmaking shop when Trumbo cut
down the alley; she saw him, and later noticed Pairvent drift in
the same direction. She had been talking to Mary van Hogh about a
dress and as she talked she had her troubled guess as to what would
be happening. The politics of the Basin were an old story to her,
made up of jealousy and greed and intrigue; and in this her father
played the greater part. She had not thought Trumbo would follow
that pattern.</p>

<p>Later she observed Pairvent return from the rear of town. She
made her excuses to Mary van Hogh, left the shop and threaded the
alley to the back end of Morphy's abandoned store. A board wall ran
to either side of the store's rear yard and thus formed a shelter;
in a little while Trumbo came into the boarded compound.</p>

<p>"I thought you might come," he said.</p>

<p>He had a good smile and he had a way of showing how much he
liked these casual meetings. It warmed her throughout to see the
appreciation in his eyes and for a moment she forgot about
Pairvent. Drew came before her, looking down with his wish in his
eyes, making her desirable by the things he expressed in his
glance. Long lonely and knowing almost nothing of sympathy or
affection from others, she waited for these moments and treasured
them; and of late had been permitting herself half hopes.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, "I could ride up to your front door like a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"My father would furnish the reception." She shrugged her
shoulders. "I wish there was some way of making him gentler on
people, hating less." She had another thought. "Is there any
particular reason, any personal reason, why he dislikes you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I just settled too close to his range. What he sees he
wants&mdash;and maybe he wants my small outfit. Let it pass."</p>

<p>"Nothing like that passes. Somebody's got to fix it. I haven't
had much luck."</p>

<p>He gave her a keener glance. "Don't you and your father get
along all right?"</p>

<p>She had a great deal of pride and she had never spoken of her
relations with her father to any other soul. She would not now.
"Private affairs are private, Drew."</p>

<p>He laughed the rebuke aside. "When and where will we meet
again?"</p>

<p>"On Star Cross Ridge some morning, I suppose. Drew, why are you
meeting Pairvent?"</p>

<p>The question caught him off balance and he had no ready answer.
He looked at her with a completely expressionless face. He said
slowly, "Did I meet him?" Then he knew this was the wrong answer
and corrected it. "George has got his troubles, the Basin tryin' to
cut Horsehead from under him. Comes to me for advice now and
then."</p>

<p>"Keep out of sagebrush politics and just plug along with your
own ranch. Don't ever get tied up with the owners. The Basin
changes almost everybody. You must not let it change you. You stay
an honest man."</p>

<p>"Honest," he said, and laughed again, "Honest and poor."</p>

<p>"Better that way," she answered and watched the personal,
wanting expression come to his face again. He had only once tried
to kiss her and she had not let him, being sure neither of herself
nor of him. Since that time he had held his distance but she knew
he would someday try again, and she wondered, when that time came,
what she would do.</p>

<p>He had a streak of humor, sharp and sometimes self-ridiculing,
which pleased her. He said suddenly: "What dark thoughts are
runnin' through your head now?"</p>

<p>She smiled back, "Whether to have the next dress blue or brown.
See you soon." She turned out of the alley, reached her horse and
went out of town at a full gallop. Departing horsemen made dots on
the desert. Nearer, idly jogging along the Gateway road, she saw
the new man. Tracy Coleman; her thoughts went to him easily and at
once.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Riding southwest over the plain. Coleman thought of Ben-Tim
Howlett's final instructions and advice, delivered from the porch
of the Texas ranch house, "My time to die," Ben-Tim had said, "has
come and I want my ledgers clean before I go. If I'd ever had a
son, Tracy, I'd been pleased to have had him like you. And if my
son was a-standin' in your shoes this minute I'd be thinkin' of the
worst chore I could give him. It's the tough things that are good
for men, not the easy ones. So I'm sendin' you up to the Basin.
Somethin's wrong there. Horsehead is your ranch&mdash;if you can
hold it."</p>

<p>He recalled how Ben-Tim's weather-etched face had turned
reminiscent, "I was the first cattleman in that country and I took
the best chunk of range. I held it against the worst pirates you
ever saw. Some are still there and now they're thinkin' Ben- Tim's
old and has got no right to grass he don't walk on. An absentee
owner is always fair game for the neighbors. If Frank DeLeon is
still alive, give him my love. But watch Dan Stuart. He always
wanted to be king and he'll skin you and dry your hide if he can.
Maybe you can make it, maybe not. Still, you're like me. The fun of
it is the tryin' and the cryin' and the laughin'. That's all the
fun there is. I think."</p>

<p>Ben-Tim, sitting so old and tired in his chair, hadn't shaken
hands. He had added: "I recall when you first came to work for me,
as wild a lad as ever I saw. You have settled considerable but
still you're smellin' the breeze. There is somethin' you want. I
don't guess you know what it is, but if you are ever to be a steady
man you will have to go out and find it. Otherwise you will be the
sour and restless kind." Then old Ben-Tim had turned his eyes away
and his voice had grown rough, "Well, son, go find it.
Good-by."</p>

<p>Ben-Tim had been as much of a father as he had known and that
parting had been tough; for they both knew they would not see each
other again.</p>

<p>The prairie's steady, grass-yellow undulations were before him,
broken by low hills to east and south. Around ten in the morning
the prairie came upon the river at a low bluff and the trail
dropped to water running shallow over a gravel bar. The river was
mountain-cold, its undertow deceptive. After he crossed over he
stopped a moment, hearing the low thrum of the current below him as
it passed into a deeper canyon and began its tumultuous run for
Gateway, twenty miles away and five thousand feet lower. This ford,
he guessed, was the only practical crossing in the heart of the
Basin. Below and above it the mountains formed deep canyons.</p>

<p>As he climbed the farther bluff he saw the buckboard wheeling
southwest toward a pine ridge ten miles away, and here he had a
first good look at the fair, rolling grass of Horsehead Range,
cupped in the great hills; and the memory of Ben-Tim's face,
mirroring the fun and the danger of his eighty years, came vividly
to Tracy Coleman. His own beliefs and desires were the same. Life
was freedom and action, and even its bitterest moments were great.
A man was made to sweat and cry and laugh; otherwise he grew small
and his spirit shriveled and the vital juice went out of him,
leaving him a shadow upon the greatness of the earth.</p>

<p>The buckboard vanished inside a grove of pines which ran down
from the southwestern ridge. The road gradually carried him into
this grove and he saw Horsehead's ranch quarters lying in the
mottled shade and sunlight of the pines&mdash;the long low house,
the bunkhouse and corrals and sheds spread around it. Back of these
quarters the trees of the ridge rose away rank upon rank and the
day's warm air brought a strong resin smell into the yard. One man
stood by the bunkhouse, watching the yard&mdash;the lank kid whom
he had slapped to the ground the previous night. Solvay stood on
the porch with Valencia Wilder. Beside them was a small, dark and
elderly woman with a knot of black hair and a placid face.</p>

<p>Solvay said: "Ben-Tim brought Doa Gertrude up with a Mexican
crew, some years ago. Her husband was in the crew but he died."</p>

<p>"I know," said Coleman and turned to her, speaking in Spanish.
"Don Ben-Tim asked me to say that he is an old man and will never
see you again. Doa Gertrude, but that he remembers you."</p>

<p>The woman's eyes grew liquid and light, "Did he say how he
remembered me. Seor?"</p>

<p>"With affection."</p>

<p>The Seora sighed. Memories stirred her and she shrugged her
shoulders and recaptured her placid expression. "I am old, too. I
should like to see Don Ben-Tim again so that we might laugh
together before we die. He was a laughing man." She showed a spark
of old coquetry, as though she wished Coleman to understand the
liveliness of her younger years, "He was gallant, that Ben- Tim.
You are here now in this house?"</p>

<p>"I am in this house now," answered Coleman and told her his
name.</p>

<p>"You will have the bedroom on the right," said Doa Gertrude.
She cast a glance at Valencia Wilder, "She will be in that room,
too?"</p>

<p>"Seorita Wilder is a guest."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Doa Gertrude, "then the room across the hall." She
divided a quick glance between man and woman and a smile lay behind
the glance and she seemed pleased as she said in English,
"Seorita. I will show you the room." Valencia Wilder followed her
into the house.</p>

<p>"It will just be for a short while," said Ben Solvay, "And
thanks."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Coleman. Solvay told him and offered
his hand. Coleman shook it, giving Solvay a thorough looking- over.
This man was pretty much as he appeared on the surface, square and
not easily stampeded. He had a grip to his jaw and practical blue
eyes. "Ben," said Coleman, "you heard the talk in the hotel. That
makes this ranch a pretty poor risk for a woman."</p>

<p>Solvay had already thought of that possibility. "They'll think
it over for a week before they move. It'll take that long for those
fellows to agree. Not that you won't have trouble, later. You
will."</p>

<p>Coleman said: "They were in two groups, one on each side of the
room. What ran between those two groups. Ben?"</p>

<p>"The river," answered Solvay. "Stuart and Bill Yell and Tabor
and Gunderson, and some others, all graze the other side of the
river. The rest live on this side. Frank DeLeon's north of you and
Clyde Medary north of you. Back of you, south, is Hoby Spade. The
river does it."</p>

<p>"Where's Trumbo?"</p>

<p>Solvay studied his answer before giving it. "Just across the
ford and to the south. A small outfit." Then he added in a reserved
voice: "You see things quick."</p>

<p>"Who's that other girl. Ben?"</p>

<p>"Ann Stuart," said Ben Solvay and looked at the doorway through
which Valencia Wilder had gone. He had a desire to see her and
suddenly he reached down and lifted her trunk and went into the
house. Coleman heard the two talking and in a moment Doa Gertrude
came out and stood silently at the doorway. The long, black-haired
kid loafed in the sunshine near the bunkhouse, his insolence
traveling the entire length of the yard.</p>

<p>Ben Solvay returned, showing some confusion, as though he had
permitted himself unsure emotions. He jammed on his hat, said "See
you later," and rode immediately away. Doa Gertrude. Coleman
noticed, looked upon the departing Solvay with disfavor; she was a
woman of the old school, loyal to her ranch and everything upon it.
So now she murmured: "Your woman. Don Tracy, or his?"</p>

<p>"His," said Coleman.</p>

<p>The woman's eyes looked upon Coleman with wisdom. "What a fool
he is then to leave her here."</p>

<p>"She is safe on this place."</p>

<p>She gave Coleman a placid smile and a lift of her brows.</p>

<p>"Safe is a dull word to a woman and not a word used by
Texans."</p>

<p>Out on the flat, meanwhile, had been the palpitation of a
horse's running. Looking about he saw a rider coming in, gaunt and
long-legged on the saddle. "That man you must watch," said Doa
Gertrude, and walked into the house.</p>

<p>Fifty feet from the porch. George Pairvent pulled his horse to a
stop and stood stiff in the stirrups, both hands flattened to the
horn, watching Coleman with his never-trusting eyes.</p>

<p>"Get down for a talk," said Coleman. He observed the quick way
Pairvent left the saddle and kept himself in position to meet
trouble. The foreman advanced to a porch post and laid the point of
a shoulder against it. He was, even in that relaxed attitude, ready
to jump. Coleman sat down in one of the rocking chairs. He tipped
himself idly back and forth. "Little late getting here.
George."</p>

<p>"Had things to clean up in War Bonnet."</p>

<p>"Have a good talk with Trumbo?"</p>

<p>Pairvent's eyes widened somewhat. He didn't answer.</p>

<p>"George," said Coleman, "it is time to be honest. What kind of
an outfit you been running here? I heard something said this
morning about this being an outlaw bunch."</p>

<p>"Man can always hear talk."</p>

<p>"How much beef we got?"</p>

<p>"Don't know. Two thousand, maybe."</p>

<p>"Where's the rest gone?"</p>

<p>Pairvent delayed his answer a long while, finally saying: "Ask
the fellow that called us an outlaw outfit. Everybody wants
Horsehead. It has got no friends. You listening to people who're
not friends?"</p>

<p>"Trumbo," said Coleman, "seems your friend."</p>

<p>Pairvent again hesitated, meanwhile searching Coleman's
expression. "Maybe I have made my arrangements with him from time
to time," he admitted, "I have had to tie up where I could.
Horsehead has got to do the best it can. But we're talkin' too
much. Say what's on your mind."</p>

<p>"You have been boss and foreman here. I'm the owner now. You
stay on as foreman."</p>

<p>Pairvent now relaxed sufficiently to make himself a cigarette. A
gray shine of satisfaction showed on the slate surface of his eyes.
"I see you been doin' some thinkin'. You know this crew walks out
on my say-so. You know you can't get another crew."</p>

<p>"So," said Coleman, "you stay on as foreman."</p>

<p>Pairvent drew in a deep breath of smoke, expelled it, "All
right," he said and left the porch, leading his horse back toward
the bunkhouse. He had won a point and his attitude reflected
it.</p>

<p>Turning into the house, Coleman came to a living room and a
small desk. There was a pencil-drawn map tacked to the wall and,
standing before it. Coleman saw the lines of Horsehead Range as
Ben-Tim Howlett had sketched it years before, the areas of the
other outfits also indicated. Coleman took time to memorize those
boundaries.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
At sundown the easy wind came with a high mountain chill, strange
to his Texas blood; and from the porch of the house he watched the
colors of the land run and change along horizon and high peak and
timber-blackened draw. The supper bell rang once, its round-shaped
echo striking out and on through the land's great stillness. He
went back through the house to the dining room. The crew had
already gathered and Doa Gertrude sat at the foot of the table,
dark and still&mdash;and waiting; and this same sense of waiting
was with the crew. Looking about him, he knew at once what they
waited for. The seat of authority on any ranch was at the head of
the table. George Pairvent sat there, usurping a place he no longer
rated.</p>

<p>Valencia Wilder came in. Coleman drew back a chair for her, but
as she came to it he touched her and stopped her, and then he
looked at the crew and at Pairvent, "Stand up," he said.</p>

<p>Pairvent stopped his coffee cup halfway to his mouth. He braced
himself for trouble; he had planned for it and now waited for it.
Yet he had not planned for it to come this way and as he looked at
Valencia Wilder the surly, eager light in his eyes lessened and he
put down his cup and silently rose. Taking cue from him, the rest
of the crew likewise rose. Valencia Wilder took her place beside
Coleman. The Mexican woman watched Coleman from the end of the
table, her eyes dye-black, every partisan instinct in her outraged
at the insult of Pairvent's sitting where he had no right to
be.</p>

<p>Coleman ate, saying nothing; and the meal was a hurried, silent
chore soon done. Pairvent, feeling himself victor in being kept on
as foreman, now rode his victory hard. When he rose the rest of the
crew got up, half showing their thin amusement at Coleman's
challenged authority. The feeling of their triumph remained behind
them after they had gone.</p>

<p>Doa Gertrude sighed an exasperated breath; she had not touched
her food at all. Valencia Wilder looked at Coleman, "You didn't
need to do that for me. I want to cause you no trouble. Why are you
smiling?"</p>

<p>He had risen and was smiling. He made up a cigarette and lighted
it and his lips stretched against the white heaviness of his teeth;
and his eyelids came near together and wind swept steadily in and
out of him, drawing deeper from his chest, "The air in here," he
said, "reminds me of the South. Always sticky before a storm."</p>

<p>"You're angry," she said. "You're angry clear through."</p>

<p>She walked to the porch with him. Twilight had gone and gray
darkness lay over the land and the sharper wind bore down from the
surrounding slopes. Far out on the flats a single rider moved in
small, scudding echoes. She watched him face the open country, the
glow of the cigarette laying its dark-yellow light along his
cheeks. By this faint reflection his face made a heavy show, the
bones of his cheeks flat and ridged beneath the covering skin. He
turned to watch the bunkhouse. Over there was the sound of men idly
talking, of one man laughing. Doa Gertrude was a smoldering
presence somewhere on the porch.</p>

<p>He turned into the house and reappeared with his belt and gun:
he smoked the last of his cigarette, and threw it into the dust of
the yard. He went down the steps and ground the cigarette beneath
his heel.</p>

<p>"Do you have to do it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There's five of them," she murmured.</p>

<p>"We'll see," he said.</p>

<p>"It is Pairvent," she said, her voice tight and quick. "He is
your enemy, he thinks you're afraid. Whip him. Break him. Make him
humble."</p>

<p>He came up the steps, stopping directly before her. He looked
down at her face, "You want to see a man hurt?"</p>

<p>"Hurt&mdash;or be hurt. You're alone. So have I been. The world
is not kind. It will shrivel all the sweetness in you, it will
starve you, it will destroy you. If it can. You're alone, against a
pack of dogs. If you beat them they'll cringe. If you don't they'll
tear you apart. I have been through it all. I have learned that if
you do not fight you'll lose."</p>

<p>"Why," he said, gently for so big a man, "you've been through
hell," and then he put his hands on her arms and drew her forward
and kissed her. He stepped quickly back and left the porch. She
stood motionless, hearing his boots scuff around the house. From
the deeper shadows of the house she heard Doa Gertrude's soft
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was it a good kiss?"</p>

<p>"It was pity. Seora," murmured Valencia.</p>

<p>"So, he has a heart. The other kind of a kiss will come."</p>

<p>"What kind, Seora?"</p>

<p>"A foolish question. You know the kind of kisses men give. As
for this other man&mdash;this Solvay. He is not your man, or he
would not have left you here."</p>

<p>"I came for shelter."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the older woman, "what is shelter? I never asked for
shelter. I asked for a man. So do you. That is why you came."</p>

<p>"Should I go. Seora?"</p>

<p>"That," said Doa Gertrude practically, "will answer itself in
time."</p>

<p>Coleman crossed the yard with the light of the bunkhouse before
him. One man stood against the bunkhouse wall, a thin shadow
against other shadows; the rest had gone inside. He heard the
murmuring of their voices until he reached the bunkhouse doorway.
When he stepped through the doorway, talk ceased and he faced the
eyes of these men&mdash;the arrested, expectant attention in those
eyes.</p>

<p>Three of them sat at the room's small table&mdash;Pairvent, the
brown-skinned man and the green-eyed rider with the half beard. A
deck of cards lay on the table and a rack of poker chips, but they
were not playing. They sat by, waiting for him. Ray, the chunky
hand with the straight, blunt face, lay on a bunk, half-turned so
that he also could watch. Therefore the man out in the shadows
would be the tricky kid. Coleman thought of the kid momentarily and
then forgot him.</p>

<p>The two hands at the table had meanwhile made up their minds at
the same moment, both now rising and stepping away. Pairvent
remained, both his hands lying flat on the table: but he betrayed
himself even as he thus seemed idle, for Coleman noticed the back
of those hands show pressure. The foreman, so closely watching
Coleman, presently seemed to see a new thing for suddenly his feet
shifted slowly beneath the chair. Celeman said: "George. I didn't
make myself plain to you," and flung over the table with his
arm.</p>

<p>Pairvent rose and kicked the chair away at a single motion; and
his hand fell upon his gun and lifted it. Coleman came at him,
half-turning as he jumped. He caught Pairvent's arm with both his
hands. He twisted Pairvent's arm as he turned and he struck
Pairvent's chest with his in-driving shoulder and flung Pairvent
back against a bunk frame. He buckled Pairvent's arm downward and
inward until the foreman gave a high yell and dropped the gun.
Coleman knocked it aside with his foot; he stepped back and hit
Pairvent on the side of the jaw with his fist and moved away,
"George," he said, "this time I'll make myself plain."</p>

<p>Pairvent cast a wild, searching glance toward the corner of the
room where the gun lay. This was his unguarded moment. Coleman came
in and struck him on the side of the head, half- spinning Pairvent;
he caught the foreman at the waist and whirled him across the small
room and slammed him against the bunkhouse wall. Pairvent's breath
gushed out and he lowered his head and drove it hard against
Coleman's face. Coleman took that shock on his lips, he felt the
skin of his lips crush in; it staggered and stopped him and
Pairvent's fists beat him on neck and chest and belly.</p>

<p>Coleman ducked aside. He drew back, watching Pairvent follow:
and he ducked again and came in, catching the foreman once more
around the waist. Pairvent's knees smashed into his crotch and he
heard Pairvent's teeth snap, close by his right ear. The foreman
was a barroom fighter and now jabbed his thumb straight at
Coleman's eyes, and missed and whirled and jumped and brought the
sharp weight of his boot heel down on Coleman's instep. Coleman
hung on, braced his feet, and turned Pairvent around with a full
pivot and let him go like a rock out of a slingshot, throwing the
foreman backward into two punchers standing on the edge of this
fight. They caught Pairvent and kept him from falling and Pairvent,
dizzied by his turning, threshed around and hit the bearded puncher
full on the face before he realized it. The puncher cursed at him
and backed away. Pairvent, turned mad, suddenly seized a steel
stove poker hanging to a bunk end and whipped it full length at
Coleman.</p>

<p>Coleman took it on a shoulder. He reached forward and down and
seized one of Pairvent's long legs and dumped the man. Pairvent,
flat on the floor, rolled and suddenly shot a boot heel straight up
at Coleman's face. That heel tore along Coleman's cheek. He seized
the foot and he bent it and turned it and heard Pairvent's shouted
agony; he dragged the man out of the narrow space between the bunks
and he reached down and sledged him twice on the temples with his
fists; and stepped back. Pairvent groaned and lay on his side, made
dumb by the beating.</p>

<p>The kid stood in the doorway, his big, sullen eyes filled with
desire. Coleman whirled on him so quickly that the kid jumped back,
fear cracking the sullenness. Coleman said: "Never stand behind
me."</p>

<p>"Where the hell's behind you when you're turnin' like a top?"
muttered the kid.</p>

<p>"You takin' part in this fight?"</p>

<p>"No," said the kid. "No."</p>

<p>Coleman ran the back of a hand across his cheek and brought it
away red. Pairvent's boot heel had scraped him like a razor and
Pairvent's head had crushed his lips so that he tasted blood. Wind
came heavily out of him and ran full in, lifting and dropping his
chest. The brown-faced puncher and the rider with the half beard
stood by the wall, saying nothing; Ray lay on his bunk, watching
with a gray pleasure.</p>

<p>Pairvent rolled and sat up on the floor, pale and momentarily
sickened, "You've raised hell," he said.</p>

<p>"Some doubt in your mind about me," Coleman said. "I wanted to
put that straight." He looked at the man on the bunk. "Ray
what?"</p>

<p>"Miller," said the chunky one. "What good does that do you?"</p>

<p>Pairvent pushed himself erect and tried weight on the twisted
leg. He sat down on his bunk. "You've laid me up."</p>

<p>"You can sit and rest," said Coleman. "But not at the head of
the table."</p>

<p>"To hell with the place," said Pairvent.</p>

<p>"If you're runnin' away from a fight, go ahead and run."</p>

<p>"Who said anything about running?" asked Ray Miller in an easy,
round-toned voice.</p>

<p>Coleman looked at the other two, "What names you men use?"</p>

<p>"Ed Drum," said the whiskered one. "And it's my real name, damn
you."</p>

<p>The fellow with the stained brown face only grumbled:
"Baldy."</p>

<p>Pairvent stared at the other men, at Ray Miller. "What the hell
do you like about stayin'?" Ray Miller smiled, saying nothing.
Coleman turned from the bunkhouse and walked back to the porch.
Valencia stood waiting there; Doa Gertrude was a shadow behind
her.</p>

<p>"Day's work is done," said Coleman, and laughed quietly. He
heard Doa Gertrude give out a long sigh. Valencia touched his arm
and held it, "Can you trust them?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Not at all."</p>

<p>"Trust nobody."</p>

<p>He looked at the round, pale darkness of her face, he heard the
deep-seated bitterness in her voice. "Somebody's left his hoof
marks all over you. Listen&mdash;you can't live without trustin'
somebody."</p>

<p>"You will be hurt if you try it."</p>

<p>"Everybody gets hurt. But you can't hide in a black cave and
live small."</p>

<p>She said: "You know why I can't believe in people. You knew it
when you offered me your cigarette."</p>

<p>"I knew," he said. "I know something else, too. There's more to
you than that."</p>

<p>The pressure of her fingers now quite strong on his arm. Her
voice changed and filled with disturbed feeling. "There is," she
whispered. "There's so much more. But what good is that now?"</p>

<p>"You came up here to start over, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I did, but it won't work. He saw what I was. It is no use."</p>

<p>"Solvay," said Coleman, "is a fool."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. ANN STUART</h2>

<p class="first">SHORTLY after the fight in Horsehead's bunkhouse,
the kid with the stringy black hair saddled his horse. Ray Miller
was at the moment in the shadows and hailed him. "Where you
spookin' now. Alvy?"</p>

<p>Alvy's voice was sullen, "Air's too close around here."</p>

<p>Miller said: "Alvy, damn a man that plays all corners of the
board."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the kid, swinging in the saddle. But Ray
was too tough a man either to fight or to bluff; the hard
steadiness of his return glance made the kid drop his eyes. It was
always like this with the kid. At twenty he wanted to be a man like
Ray, deadly and caring for nothing; but he had no wisdom and none
of those gutty qualities which made a man very good or very bad. He
was a mass of emotion and self-drama, unstable as river sand,
treacherous and thoughtless; he was forever carrying a quarrel to
men better than he and always therefore being cuffed around. All
this festered in him and made him worse.</p>

<p>Ray Miller dryly drawled: "Better watch out, kid."</p>

<p>Alvy rode away. He saw nobody on the porch of the main house and
he thought to himself: "I wish he'd show up there. I'd let go at
him." Then he discovered Coleman's shape in the deep shadows; and
thin fear washed through him and he put the horse to a gallop and
ran full tilt into the night.</p>

<p>After he forded the river he swung to the south, crossed the
open plain and entered a low pine ridge. The trail carried him over
a shallow summit, directly into Drew Trumbo's yard. There wouldn't
be anybody else about. Alvy knew, for Trumbo had only a small range
and did his own work except in busy season. Alvy circled the house
and found Trumbo on the porch. Trumbo's ears had picked up his
approach. There wasn't any light on the place; therefore the kid
said, "It's me&mdash;Alvy."</p>

<p>"What goes on?" asked Trumbo.</p>

<p>"This Coleman came on the place. Had a talk with Pairvent and
made a dicker for Pairvent to stay as foreman. George figured
Coleman maybe wasn't very sure of things. So George ran his string
out a little and took head place at the supper table. After supper
Coleman came to the bunkhouse and beat hell out of George."</p>

<p>"Pairvent going to leave?"</p>

<p>"I guess not. There's a woman on the place, too. That girl who's
Ben Solvay's girl. I guess. Solvay brought her."</p>

<p>Trumbo said: "That's good going, Alvy. Be sure to keep me
posted."</p>

<p>Alvy said: "What's it look like to you now?"</p>

<p>Trumbo only added: "Keep me posted, Alvy. I'll remember
you."</p>

<p>It was always like this for Alvy. He did his part, hoping for
better. But he was always crowded out. He never made a fit with men
like Ray, or Trumbo. He sat awhile in the saddle, sullen and
self-pitying.</p>

<p>"All right," he said at last, and rode back into the ridge,
never knowing that he passed within ten feet of Tap, Dan Stuart's
foreman.</p>

<p>Tap came out of his covert as soon as the sound of Alvy's travel
died in the pines. He traced Alvy at a distance and watched Alvy's
shape grow into a black point on the grassland. Thereafter Tap
turned north and in an hour reached home. Stuart sat on the porch
with his daughter Ann, and so Tap simply paused his horse and made
up a cigarette and moved on. He put away his horse and stood
against the corral, waiting. Having dropped his signal he knew the
old man would come up. It was a half hour before Stuart arrived.
Tap said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That kid&mdash;Alvy&mdash;carried news of some kind from
Horsehead to Trumbo."</p>

<p>"He's done it before," said Stuart. "He's a go-between for
Pairvent and Trumbo."</p>

<p>"Or spyin' on Pairvent for Trumbo," said Tap. "The kid's no
good. He'd do anything. But now here's a new thing. You think maybe
Coleman's usin' him to send word to Trumbo?"</p>

<p>"They don't know each other yet. Anyhow, Trumbo wouldn't work
with Horsehead. He's out to get Horsehead and make a big fellow out
of himself. Little fellow into a big fellow." Then he fell into a
long silence, reviewing possibilities.</p>

<p>Tap said: "Wouldn't take anything for granted, Mr. Stuart. This
Coleman's not foolish." He always put a handle on Stuart's name. It
was the way Dan Stuart wanted it to be and Tap, who knew his boss
inside out, took care never to offend the man's tremendous sense of
dignity. Stuart wanted to be king and Tap, therefore, wanted him to
be king.</p>

<p>"Coleman's out of luck," said Stuart, "He's got no crew to fight
with. Those fellows will do what Pairvent wants done. Pairvent will
buck Coleman at every turn, wantin' things for himself. So they'll
get into a fight and Pairvent will beat Coleman to the draw. I see
that coming."</p>

<p>Tap said: "Before he left War Bonnet, Pairvent had a talk with
Trumbo. Then he went back to Horsehead. I been watching the ford
all day. He's still on Horsehead. Maybe Coleman made a deal with
him. Maybe there's a deal between the three. Pairvent and Trumbo
and Coleman."</p>

<p>Stuart drew a long sigh of increased anger. "God's bells. There
stands Drew Trumbo with his pint and a half of grass, trying to
beat me to Horsehead. A kid, a latecomer, a schoolboy with a
slingshot against a man with a cannon. If he thinks he sees a way
of schemin' me out of Horsehead&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tap made up a cigarette and let Dan Stuart's temper boil. He
lighted the cigarette, he held the match in his hand, narrowly
squinting at its dying flame. He said: "You been trying to do this
the roundabout way. You been trying to get all the neighbors
together on it. All you got out of that was a split Basin. Trumbo's
got a couple men, maybe three, on his side. He's made some sort of
a deal with Hoby Spade and Frank DeLeon and Hack Dobbin. The rest
of the crowd may be stickin' with you, but the price of that is a
slice of Horsehead to each of 'em when you take it. What's that
leave you? The more you slice it up the less it is worth the fight.
All or nothing. If I were you I'd step in and take it while
everybody else is waitin' around. Take it and keep it all."</p>

<p>"That," said Dan Stuart, "is my intention."</p>

<p>"Then move in now."</p>

<p>"Wait till Pairvent and Coleman quarrel. That will just leave
Pairvent for me to run off."</p>

<p>"Wait that long and Trumbo may be before you."</p>

<p>Stuart grew irritated at Tap's insistence. "Sometimes it is best
to let the other man reach first. I think I'll let Coleman reach
first."</p>

<p>Tap had offered his advice up to this point. Now that Stuart had
made a decision, Tap remained still. Stuart was the law and as far
as Tap was concerned that law was sufficient. Star Cross was his
life entirely; for it he lived and to it he gave his complete
loyalty, knowing no other allegiance. All he said was, "Let it be
so then," and turned to the bunkhouse to sleep the five short hours
he permitted himself.</p>

<p>Dan Stuart returned to the porch and found his daughter still
there. He said impatiently, "Thought you'd gone to bed."</p>

<p>"What's Tap so mysterious about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Don't let him talk you into anything."</p>

<p>The suggestion that he could be influenced by another person
affronted him greatly; for he was a man who loved power for its own
sake and the fat streak of aggressiveness in him would not let him
bear the thought of interference, "By God," he said, "nobody talks
me into anything. I have my own mind. Ann."</p>

<p>"Then don't talk yourself into anything."</p>

<p>"I will do as I please," he said. "Why don't you go to bed?"</p>

<p>He faced her as a stranger and talked with a stranger's cold
irritation. He had no softness in him; and she knew he resented
sharing his affairs with her. He had never forgiven her for not
being a boy and her earlier memories were cruel memories of having
been raised, motherless, at his rough hands as a boy would have
been raised. Somewhere along the years he had seen the uselessness
of that and instead of accepting the fact gracefully, he had turned
from her. She was a woman to run the house, nothing more.</p>

<p>"Dad," she said, "someday, when you're older, you'll look back
and you'll wonder where the nice memories are. You're destroying
them and there won't be any. You drive people away. You have driven
me away little by little. Do you want me to leave Star Cross?"</p>

<p>"Leave?" he echoed. "Where in hell would you go? This is your
home, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Is it?"</p>

<p>He stared at her, comprehending nothing, "Women are fools for
thinkin' things that make no sense." He grew impatient, "Why can't
you take things as they come instead of mooning up funny things
that are nothing at all? I'll be damned if I like the way you tear
around the country on your horse. I never know where you are. If
you were a boy I'd take the steam out of you by workin' you sixteen
hours a day."</p>

<p>"If I were a boy," she said. "I would have left you long
ago."</p>

<p>He said: "What were you doin' down at Gateway the other
night?"</p>

<p>"Riding," she said. "Just riding anywhere, away from Star
Cross."</p>

<p>"Was Trumbo down there?"</p>

<p>"You let me into none of your affairs. I'll let you into none of
mine."</p>

<p>His fiery temper flew up. "Keep away from Drew Trumbo! I want
nothing to do with him and I'll refuse to have him as a son-in-
law." He looked at her and hurled his half-suspecting question at
her. "You're a good girl, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>He stood silent and then one of the things she had previously
said came back and struck below his thick hide. "Why would you
leave me if you were a boy? If you were a boy you'd be in line for
this place. You will, anyhow, as a girl."</p>

<p>"What memories could I have of Star Cross?" she asked. "You
grasp and you shout and you curse. You give nothing good to me or
to any living thing. Someday you will see that."</p>

<p>"When you were nine years old," he said, "I had to lick you.
Then I tried to show you I wasn't really put out, so I kissed you
and you hit me in the face. I never forgot it. I never will.
Anything that lifts a hand against me is nothin' I want around. If
you'd been a boy I would have broken your bones for that."</p>

<p>She turned away from his ungovernable temper. She stepped into
her own room and lighted a lamp and stood in the room's center, a
tall girl with yellow-gold hair and a face now softened and sad. On
the dresser before her was a framed daguerreotype of her mother, a
woman she had never known. Now and then, when particularly alone,
she tried to reach back into her very earliest childhood memories
to evoke some image of her mother, some tone, some fragrance, some
soft touch; and always failed. Even so, the picture of her mother
was the closest companion she had in a solitary life. Out on the
porch her father steadily tramped his restless path on the boards,
heavy and dominant&mdash;a great egotist of a man, a caged bear
with a passion for victory and a temper which knew no bounds when
crossed. She did not hate him and she did not fear him; in her was
enough of his own gift to turn her face somewhat stern as she
thought of him.</p>

<p>She was on the porch at ten the next morning when a rider
dropped from the western ridge and came on at a canter and at a
walk. She watched his arrow-straight course for a full twenty
minutes and recognized him as Tracy Coleman when he came into the
yard. Her father meanwhile appeared with Tap and Coley Blaine.
These three men stood together as Coleman came up.</p>

<p>He turned the horse, glanced at the men and then looked at Ann
and removed his hat. He held his hat in his right hand, his arm
full length. It was a gesture which disarmed him before the men and
Ann, knowing her father and the jealous instincts of Star Cross,
was troubled by it. Coleman gave her the same kind of easy and
appreciative smile she had noticed before at Gateway; and the smile
removed the short-cut angles around his mouth. He was slimmer in
the saddle than on the ground, but even in the saddle he had
muscular bulk.</p>

<p>Her father called immediately out: "You're on wrong ground,
Coleman."</p>

<p>"Payin' a call," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"Pay no more. I will not ask you to light."</p>

<p>Coleman said: "I have been lookin' over Horsehead grass this
morning. You've got your beef eating all over it. Naturally beef
strays around. But roundup time is when outfits drive their cattle
back to their own range. Roundup's just over and nothing's been
driven off Horsehead."</p>

<p>"Let it stay," said Stuart with a cold, deep antagonism.</p>

<p>"I have been looking at that beef," said Coleman, "and I see
some Horsehead brands with a vent on 'em, and your brand below. In
the books of Horsehead there's no item of sale to you of any
Horsehead beef."</p>

<p>"It's on my books," said Dan Stuart.</p>

<p>"Let me see those books, the date and amount of sale and the
money paid to Horsehead."</p>

<p>"Ride out," said Dan Stuart. He held his temper longer than was
natural to him, Ann thought; and this was somewhat of a concession
to Coleman. Her father was studying the man with his hostile eyes,
weighing him and making up his mind.</p>

<p>Coleman said: "I am going to cut through that beef and take
every cow with a vent mark back across the river. I recognize no
sales."</p>

<p>Dan Stuart let his temper go, "You're telling me Star Cross
rustled your stock!"</p>

<p>"Let me see your books and the signed sales slip of the
Horsehead agent."</p>

<p>"Ride out!" cried Dan Stuart, "Don't let me catch you within a
mile of a cow bearin' my mark! I told you yesterday there ain't any
more Horsehead. All beef which was Horsehead is maverick stuff in
the Basin, open to any man's iron!"</p>

<p>"You're lookin' for a private war?" asked Coleman.</p>

<p>"If you wasn't in my yard," cried Stuart, "I'd shoot you
down."</p>

<p>"You are going to have a private war," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"Who's fightin' with you?" demanded Stuart, "You come up here,
tryin' to hold something which went back to public property
three-four years ago. You try to run an outfit which has been
stealin' from other Basin men. All that vented Horsehead stuff you
see with my brand on is beef that once belonged to me, was rustled
from me, which I have retaken. You're tellin' me you're going to
rustle it back. Ride right straight down to Gateway and out of the
country or you'll never see another month alive."</p>

<p>"I was in a neighborhood war once," said Coleman, casually, "It
was bad. I gather from your talk that you are after me. That makes
it plain both ways. When I see you, or any man of yours, comin' at
me. I will consider it to mean trouble and I will draw without
talk. I also propose to collect Horsehead beef wherever it is and I
will follow its tracks if it takes me into your kitchen. Since you
propose to drive me out of the country I will let nothing stand in
my way to drive you out."</p>

<p>"With what help?" said Stuart, holding the same gritty, insolent
contempt in his tone.</p>

<p>"As to that," said Coleman and bent a little in the saddle as he
spoke, "just how many friends do you think you have?" He looked
again at the girl and bowed his head to her, saying in a much
gentler voice, "I regret to speak like this before you." He put on
his hat and turned squarely against the Star Cross men and rode
away.</p>

<p>That was a moment when Ann Stuart felt fear and looked sharply
at her father who stood with his cheeks red as brick dust in the
sunlight. She was not sure to what lengths he would really go, and
as she watched him she noticed that Tap and Coley Blaine were also
watching him, ready for his nod.</p>

<p>Stuart drew a great breath. He slid a close look at his
daughter, shook his head and wheeled around the house. She knew
then he had been very near the impulse to shoot Coleman out of the
saddle.</p>

<p>Far out on the yellow land, beyond gunshot. Coleman put his
horse to a canter. Ann watched him until a ridge took him from
sight. Afterwards the thought of him remained and her interest
grew.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. HORSEHEAD'S CREW</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER his interview with Stuart, Coleman passed
over Star Cross grass to the low pine hills in the west, followed
the road through the warm, timbered shadows and came out to a point
from which he viewed Horsehead Range as it rolled on to the river,
crossed over, and continued to the mountains lying westward. Along
the distance he saw scattered cattle grazing. Earlier during the
morning he had scouted that beef. Some of it was Horsehead, some
Star Cross, and some was Horsehead with a vent brand on it, which
indicated a sale, and Star Cross below the vent&mdash;indicating
that Stuart had purchased it.</p>

<p>It was only a way of giving legal cover to a steal. There were
no records on Horsehead of such a transaction; and if Pairvent
actually had sold the beef to Stuart, the money had not been
accounted for. In any event it was no transaction he proposed to
recognize.</p>

<p>Now instead of crossing the open grass to Cloud River, he took a
forest trail south and arrived at a right-angle ridge, and turned
west. During the afternoon he saw Drew Trumbo's ranch quarters
below him in another small valley&mdash;identifying this from
Ben-Tim's map. Trumbo was a man he wanted to meet, but on some
other basis than an outright call; and so he moved on and in late
afternoon suddenly found himself sharp against the rim of the
river's canyon, about five miles below Horsehead Crossing.</p>

<p>At the ford the stream had been smooth and fast and shallow.
Here it was well embarked upon its wild-running drop to Gateway,
crowded into narrower violence by the three-hundred-foot canyon,
rushing over immense rocks, slamming in white, wicked massiveness
from wall to wall. Below this point, around a long-turning bend,
arose the sound of still more furious collision and explosion. The
power of the river was a steady beat coming up through rock and
soil to where he stood. He felt it in his legs. Far down at the
lower bend he noticed a narrow gravel bar on which a man squatted
and seemed to rock a gold pan.</p>

<p>He left the saddle and sat with his back to a tree. Luke Wall
had said that the river was death and Ben Solvay had later
mentioned that the river was everything. Now that he had seen
Stuart he partially understood what those two had in mind. The
river was a kind of drumbeat which got into a man's system; the
Basin was a shut-in world which made a man different after he
stayed long enough.</p>

<p>Thinking back on the scene, he was troubled by his own reaction.
This Stuart was a grizzly who proposed that nothing should stand in
his way and he had laid down the law clearly enough. That in itself
was nothing new; what surprised him was the way his own temper had
jumped out from beneath his control. He had been ready to fight
without taking much of a look at his chances. Maybe it was the
country already working on him.</p>

<p>He heard a horse in the timber before he saw it, making dampered
echoes on the soft soil, and he sat facing the pines and presently
observed Ann Stuart ride out of the trees.</p>

<p>She said, "Whoa-up," and sat still, slanting a small smile at
him; the last sunlight burned against her hair and brightened the
most expressive eyes he had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Good tracker," he said.</p>

<p>"In these hills," she said, "I could find you on the darkest
night of the year." His compliment had clearly pleased her. She got
down and stood before him, but it was not apparently to her liking
so to command a man, for she dropped to the ground. She had
clean-running physical lines and her face was a mirror which
changed as her feelings changed. She took up the powdered forest
soil and let it slide through her fingers and even in that small
act she was graceful. He saw laughter below her eyes and he saw
pride; yet something smothered these things, like a cloud.</p>

<p>He removed his hat before her. She watched this casual gallantry
with a sober interest and her lips made a small change at the
corners and became soft with the caught interest of a woman.</p>

<p>"I should tell you something," she said. "You will find
Horsehead beef all over these hills, vented and rebranded with
other brands. It is not my father alone who has that kind of beef.
Horsehead was closed out as a ranch some time ago by the other
owners. They now regard every Horsehead cow to be a maverick in the
Basin."</p>

<p>"A man's brand is a sign of property. It doesn't change unless
the man changes it. Nobody can vote him out."</p>

<p>"This is the Basin," she said and explained it all by that
phrase.</p>

<p>He said: "At Gateway you laughed like a woman who had no
troubles at all. Now you're sad."</p>

<p>She gave him a surprised glance. "My friend," she murmured, "you
have sharp eyes. They should be seeing other things than the things
that come and go across a woman's face."</p>

<p>He sat idle, soaking up the final sunlight, watching her and not
answering. She made a little gesture with her shoulders and her
lips stirred with a pleasant expression.</p>

<p>"In the Basin the expected thing usually happens, and the worst
thing. I like the unexpected thing for a change. It was like that
in Gateway. My father does not like Drew Trumbo. I do." Then she
grew increasingly serious. "You should not have come into the
Basin. The ranch is lost because Ben-Tim let it go too long. Other
men want it. The fight for power is everything here. But that is
not all. Pairvent is a rustler and so are the men with him. That
has gone against Horsehead. You can't stay."</p>

<p>"I'll stay."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll try," she murmured, "But you'll be alone and
you'll lose."</p>

<p>"Not alone."</p>

<p>"You're keeping that crew? I'm sorry for you."</p>

<p>He bent forward, his solid face lightening. A woman could draw
his interest at once, and perhaps many had. She thought of that
with some doubt and gave him a considerable inspection. A man like
this could be gallant to women because he held them cheaply, or
because he had some deep feeling about one particular woman. He had
strong, straight eyes which revealed warmth as his humor changed,
"What's to be sad for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Have you been much alone?"</p>

<p>"Usually."</p>

<p>"Then you should know."</p>

<p>"I guess I do. I have looked at a lot of stars, wonderin', and I
have ridden in and out of a lot of towns, just lookin'. Hate to
think of all the miles I have covered with nobody along. A man does
a lot of thinkin'. Nothing usually comes of it."</p>

<p>She got up and she turned from him. There had been something in
his voice that hurt her and made her sad because it reminded her so
much of herself. "What are you looking for?"</p>

<p>He didn't answer. She caught the hanging reins and stepped to
the saddle. She looked down at him again and noticed that he was
near to smiling. He seemed on the point of answering her question
but in the end he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Maybe I don't know."</p>

<p>The feeling she had at the moment astonished her. "Yes you do,"
she answered, "But it isn't here for you. Ride on out of the
country. Is it so hard to give up? Is it so necessary to
fight?"</p>

<p>"Not for the fightin'."</p>

<p>"Then why?"</p>

<p>"A man comin' out of nothing toward something can't turn and go
back through nothing. I know what's behind me. That country is all
empty. I do not know what is ahead. Maybe something I'm after."</p>

<p>"If you stay and if you win there'll be no kindness left in
you." She spoke with quicker feeling, "Do you want to be like these
men in the Basin? If they pull you into their troubles they'll make
you that kind of a man. You were sitting here when I came, thinking
of other and nicer things. If you stay you'll not think of those
things again."</p>

<p>"Cleanness and dirt are always together," he said, "We go
through both, every day."</p>

<p>She moved away and swung about. "Don't hate the Stuarts more
than you can help," she said, made a casual gesture of farewell and
galloped through the timber.</p>

<p>He rose and turned to the horse. In the saddle he paused a
moment to watch the solitary man crouched far below on the gravel
bar. "That man's free," he thought. But this was only a half
judgment. For if the man were free it could only be because he
wanted nothing; and if a man wanted nothing he was old, all the
fire was out of him. As long as the fires burned and strange
pictures were before him and hunger was awake, no man could be
free.</p>

<p>He passed through the trees, traveling downgrade to the north.
When he crossed the ford he felt again the pull of the tricky
waters and he pushed the horse ashore and looked back at the river
with his eyes half-closed. The river was alive; he had felt it
reach for him. That was what Luke Wall had meant. He arrived at the
ranch in the late blue twilight and washed and went into the dining
room for supper. Valencia Wilder came in and sat with him, watching
him with her chin rested in her hand; her silence was like a
feeling in the room. She wore a gray dress which had a thin thread
of scarlet in it and her shoulders were small and square within the
dress and her breasts were round-pressed plaques against it. An
opal ring burned out its color on her right small finger. Her hands
were brown, the skin of her face faintly stained by the sun.</p>

<p>"News?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I saw Stuart."</p>

<p>"One of your enemies," she said.</p>

<p>"Full of war and breathin' fire."</p>

<p>"You're alone," she said. That was all she said until he lifted
his eyes to her. She continued to watch him and he saw once more
the way she opened her glance to him, letting him in. Then she
added: "Except for me."</p>

<p>"Solvay guessed you'd have a safe week here. You may not."</p>

<p>"A week?"</p>

<p>"He thought it would take a week for you to make up your mind
about him, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't want me."</p>

<p>"How do you figure that?"</p>

<p>"Would you have waited a week?"</p>

<p>He got up from the table and circled it. He stood behind her,
looking down on the top of her black hair. She sat still, her arms
on the table; she didn't turn or lift her eyes. He put his hands
behind him, solidly holding them together. She hated the world for
what it had done to her. She had no faith, no trust. But her
desires were live-burning in her and her stillness was the
stillness of a bomb ready to explode. Nothing had touched her
spirit. It was strong and ready to venture, even after all her hard
experiences; and he guessed that regardless of her hurts and her
hate, she still wanted something to believe and to love. She
couldn't stop her spirit, she couldn't kill the flame.</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"He doesn't want me at all," she said.</p>

<p>"What the hell does he want?"</p>

<p>"A plain woman," she said and then rose and turned. Her eyes
were black and bright and he thought it wouldn't take much for her
to cry. "You know what he means by plain? He means good."</p>

<p>"Only a fool thinks he knows the difference between good and
bad."</p>

<p>She touched his chest with her hand and looked long and closely
at him; and suddenly dropped her hand. Her voice was small. "What
do you think about me?"</p>

<p>"I won't think about you as long as you're Solvay's girl. But if
I were Solvay I'd ask no questions and I would have married you
yesterday."</p>

<p>"I wonder," she murmured, her voice long and interested and
speculative, "what kind of a woman's in your heart."</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"So you think," she murmured and changed the talk. "That thin
boy, Alvy, is a traitor. I can see it in his eyes." She took his
arm, small beside him, and walked with him to the porch. He made up
his cigarette and smoked it silently through and ground it beneath
his heel; and then he slipped into the other half of his character.
He thought of her and his face held its light and its desire, but
now the old roughness returned and he was no longer thinking of her
as he left the porch and crossed to the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>Pairvent and Ray Miller were stretched out on their bunks. Ed
Drum and Baldy sat at the table playing cribbage. All these men
ignored him; they felt his presence and resented it and grew
inwardly angry&mdash;and that feeling reached him. He nodded his
head at Baldy.</p>

<p>"Baldy, but not bald. How did that come?"</p>

<p>"Black bear tore out the rear end of my pants once. I been Baldy
ever since."</p>

<p>Coleman stepped into the room and spoke over his shoulder.
"Alvy, come out of the yard."</p>

<p>The kid was a long time coming; and entered at last nursing his
sullen air. He stood in the doorway and pretended not to be
interested. Coleman took an empty chair and tipped it against the
wall and sat in it. Pairvent watched him. Ray Miller, the coolest
of the lot, slowly turned on his stomach and hooked his head over
the bunk frame so that he might look on.</p>

<p>"George," said Coleman, "you been selling Horsehead beef to
Stuart?"</p>

<p>He heard Ed Drum move his hands across the table. He heard the
silence grow thin, he felt its thinness. Pairvent stared at him.
The foreman's eyelids sprang open and closed down.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Never did."</p>

<p>"He's got our stuff vented, his own mark underneath."</p>

<p>"You'll find that all over the Basin," said Pairvent, "You heard
the rule, didn't you? Horsehead ain't an outfit now and its beef is
maverick. That's what I been up against. You can listen to me on
that, or you can listen to somebody else. But if you listen to
anybody else you're listenin' to a man who is not Horsehead's
friend. We're alone."</p>

<p>"Mighty big smoke for a little fire," commented Coleman. "I
haven't heard it all. But I can guess some more. You been foolin'
with somebody else's beef?"</p>

<p>Pairvent let out a long-held wrath. "I been makin' my own way on
this place&mdash;any way I can! You try to do any better! A man
that lives under the gun is entitled to some profit!"</p>

<p>"Then that's why we're closed out."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Pairvent and swung himself to a sitting position
on the edge of the bunk. "They'd use any excuse, or they'd go ahead
without one. You can take Horsehead, but you're going to be a
damned dead man if you try to hold it."</p>

<p>"We'll hold it," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"I'll make no fight for it. I'm through fightin'."</p>

<p>"George," said Coleman, "I heard you were tough. You don't sound
that way."</p>

<p>Pairvent groaned and looked at his revolver hanging beside the
bed. He stared at Coleman. "You'll swallow that someday."</p>

<p>"In the mornin' I'm going over to the edge of Star Cross and I'm
bringin' back every vented animal I see."</p>

<p>"You can try," said Pairvent. "Maybe you'd be fool enough to
try."</p>

<p>"You boys have been backin' up without a fight. The Basin has
got your number. Maybe you're no better at fightin' than they
figure. You've eaten well around here. You're a fat bunch and
you're sour. I don't think you can stand a fight. I'm leavin' early
in the mornin'. If anybody feels stout enough to go along, that'll
be fine."</p>

<p>He had felt the never-relaxed attention of Ray Miller's
eyes&mdash;and that was a man he felt had something in him. He
didn't look at Miller. He kept his eyes on Pairvent who sat still
and nursed his festering rage. Then he added: "But if you've sold
that beef to Stuart you wouldn't be in such a good position to go
out there and help get it back, would you?"</p>

<p>Pairvent gave a long sigh. "I will go and I will watch you get
knocked out. I'm a fool, because I'll get knocked out too. I wish
to God I'd never seen you."</p>

<p>Ray Miller said: "Always wonder about a man that talks large.
I'll just go along and see. Lot of wind in Texas. Maybe some of it
got up here."</p>

<p>The two men at the table said nothing. Ray Miller spoke for
them, and Miller grinned as he spoke. "We'll all go."</p>

<p>"No," said Coleman, "the kid won't go." He turned his attention
to Alvy. He said: "And if you leave the yard tonight I'll tie you
up and drown you in the water trough." He looked back to Miller.
"You like to fight, Ray?"</p>

<p>"Friend," said Miller, cool and grinning, "I'll fight anything,
anywhere. The bigger the jag, the better I like it. If you're
promisin' me some fun, that's fine. If you don't deliver the fun,
I'll take it out of you."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Coleman came from the house after breakfast and saddled his horse;
and found the crew, including Alvy, waiting by.</p>

<p>"Alvy," he said, "I don't want you along. Stay back and don't
leave the place."</p>

<p>The kid had some strange pride in him. He stood by his horse and
showed Coleman a humiliated, resentful face. "I can handle my end,"
he said.</p>

<p>"The question is," said Coleman, "which end are you on?"</p>

<p>"I'm workin' for Horsehead, ain't I?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>The kid drew a deep breath, "If I stay behind everybody in the
Basin will say I didn't have the nerve to ride with the outfit. I
got to ride with the outfit."</p>

<p>The rest were mounted and ready to go. Alvy stood by his horse,
holding his eyes on Coleman and waiting for an answer. Coleman
said, "Go get a rifle. Ed," and pulled at his morning cigarette.
The inside of the kid was like quicksand all churned up; he wanted
to be a man but he was still a boy. There were all sorts of
youngsters like this, full of ambition and wanting to be great men
like other great men. Somewhere along the line the wrong kind of
men crossed their trails and set the example after which they
patterned themselves. Maybe, if a good man had come along first,
Alvy's way of looking at the world would have been different.</p>

<p>Maybe. Could a kid with bad streaks in him be made good, or
could a kid who had the right things in him be made bad? He had a
responsibility to the kid and it was hard to know what to do. Ed
Drum came back with a rifle over his saddle.</p>

<p>"I got to keep with my outfit," said Alvy.</p>

<p>Alvy had a streak of loyalty in him; and loyalty covered a lot
of sins. Coleman jerked his thumb upward, and Alvy straddled his
horse at once. He pulled his hat down over his eyes and his long
lips came together and formed a tight fish-mouthed crease. The
other men had said nothing at all; they had simply sat by. They
knew Alvy better than he did but they offered him no
information.</p>

<p>"Alvy," he said, "we're going out for some Horsehead property.
But that is all, unless Star Cross meets us and gets nervous. I
don't want to see you draw a gun unless I draw mine. If you start
shootin', I'll shoot you. That clear?"</p>

<p>"All right," said Alvy.</p>

<p>"All right," said Coleman and let his horse go. Outside the
grove of the trees he looked back to see Valencia Wilder on the
porch. She raised her hand at him and he lifted his own hand and
steadied himself on the leather.</p>

<p>The sun was round in the east, directly above the hills, and the
air was crisp and clean at this hour, and the great mountains in
the west stood very near. He pointed at the ford. Pairvent and Ray
Miller riding abreast him. Baldy and Ed Drum and the kid directly
behind. This was his crew, these were the men with whom he went
into action, and of whom he knew nothing except that they had
played a crooked game. It was possible that Pairvent would sell him
out sometime during the morning, for Pairvent was a schemer. Still,
it was a gamble he had to make; for only by a show of force could
he expect to hold Horsehead. If he sat tight he lost the ranch by
the gradual encroachment of the ranchers surrounding him.</p>

<p>They came to the river, its surface all asparkle in the fresh
sun; and the smell of the river lay in the shallow canyon and the
sound of the river was a steady growl below them. He led over and
noted how carefully these men took the ford; none of them were easy
about it. When he climbed from the shallow canyon, Coleman turned
toward the low hills in the south. Half over the open land,
Pairvent broke the silence, "You're goin' the wrong direction," he
said and pointed to the ridge in the east, "Star Cross is beyond
that."</p>

<p>"We'll circle," said Coleman. "Never pays to walk headfirst into
a battle."</p>

<p>They went up a grade and passed into the pines, whereupon
Coleman turned east with the spine of the ridge, followed it three
or four miles and then swung north, thus going along the line of
hills separating Star Cross Range from Horsehead. Now and then,
through breaks of the timber, he saw cattle grazing below him on
the Star Cross side.</p>

<p>"You're sayin'," Pairvent at last spoke up, "that you expect to
be met."</p>

<p>"I told Stuart yesterday I'd be coming," said Coleman, and
looked upon Pairvent long enough to see the lengthening and the
tightening of the foreman's face. Ray Miller was to his other side.
turning to him, Coleman noticed that Ray Miller's thick chops were
fixed in a grinning cast.</p>

<p>Within another mile Coleman struck an east-and-west-running
road. He turned and followed it downgrade toward Star Cross and
halted when he had reached the edge of the timber. Half a mile
beyond him, on the plain, lay a scatter of beef; five miles beyond
that stood the shape of the Star Cross quarters. Coleman pulled
into timber beside the road and halted. Ray Miller gave him a
glance and a grin at this maneuver. Pairvent pointed to the road's
dust. "Been somebody along here this mornin'."</p>

<p>"Likely," said Coleman. Somewhere in the timber's warm and
resinous silence a woodpecker launched its quick attack on a tree,
that sound shuttering on and on through the ridge. Far over on the
northern edge of Star Cross grass he made out a cloud of rising
dust. Miller laid his eyes thoughtfully on that while Pairvent
suspiciously scanned the surrounding trees.</p>

<p>"We go out there," said Coleman, "and round up the vented stuff
we find in that nearest bunch. We drive it back this road, straight
to the ford. One of you stays here at the edge of timber to cover
us. If Star Cross comes along we'll do a little talkin', no doubt.
If you hear it turn from talk to something else, use the rifle." He
looked at Pairvent. "Who stays here. George?"</p>

<p>"Baldy's the best rifle shot."</p>

<p>"You stay. Baldy," said Coleman and nodded at Drum. "Give Baldy
the rifle. Let's get on with this."</p>

<p>He led the others out of the trees, down the last slope of the
hill; he pointed to the beef grazing directly ahead, "Scatter and
weed it out," he said. Pairvent struck off to the left at once and
Ed Drum and the kid went rushing by him. Ray Miller stayed beside
him, the grin never leaving his big mouth; there was excitement in
the man and excitement pleased him. They circled the beef and dust
began to lift out of the grass, making a signal that would be seen
from Star Cross quarters, or from the ridge if Star Cross men were
biding there. Coleman heard Ed Drum yip at the beef; he turned in
and out, spotting the vented cattle, and his horse cut them and
moved them out. It was a short job. In twenty minutes they had
their cut moving back toward the ridge. "Twenty-three," said Miller
and brushed the sweat from his heavy cheeks. His glance kept
running out to the north toward the growing ball of dust. He
pointed at it. "Comin' up."</p>

<p>They had the beef at a trot as they reached the ridge's incline.
Ed Drum's yipping got sharper and more frequent. The man, thought
Coleman, was growing nervous under pressure. He went forward,
reading the vent brands on the beef, and he found one that had a
straight Star Cross mark. He cut that cow out and let it drift.
Pairvent rode beside him, saying: "You're particular."</p>

<p>"I don't want a rustlin' charge against us."</p>

<p>"Driving this vented stuff home is rustlin' in the Basin's
judgment."</p>

<p>"Illegally vented," answered Coleman. "Stuart's been rustlin'
from us."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Pairvent, "you ought to hang Stuart for bein' the
rustler." His temper was short and his nerves wound up.</p>

<p>"That time may come," said Coleman. "Somebody's going to hang or
die."</p>

<p>Pairvent grumbled and fell to the rear of the column. They were
within the timber, moving along the red dust of the road. Baldy
came out of the trees to join them but Coleman called to him. "Keep
behind us some distance." He joined Pairvent and Miller at the rear
while the kid and Ed Drum rode swing, holding the cattle in the
road. Ahead of them the road started downgrade into the grass
again, into Horsehead grass. The river ford was five miles due west
and the sun crawled toward the top of the sky. Ray Miller steadily
sweated and his eyes were small black lines beneath his closed lids
and his cheeks were red. Pairvent's survey swept the country
ceaselessly and when they had gone a mile onward he pointed a hand
to the north. "There's your fun."</p>

<p>The dust ball which had been visible on the Star Cross side of
the ridge now was here on the Horsehead side. He saw the thin black
point of the group coming on and once he saw a flash of light
against some piece of metal. All the Horsehead crowd had seen it.
Baldy galloped forward from his rearguard position and Alvy looked
around at Coleman and showed a drawn expression. The kid was
suddenly afraid, all his thoughts of bigness gone. Coleman called
at him: "There's the timber, Alvy, You can run for it."</p>

<p>Alvy turned his head away suddenly. Ed Drum ceased his shrill
yipping and now rode with his glance riveted to the west where lay
the ford. Pairvent began to swear in a quiet, bitter way.</p>

<p>"God damn you. Coleman, this was a fool thing to do. I should
have known better. We played right into their hands."</p>

<p>Coleman said: "How many do you see in that bunch, Ray?"</p>

<p>The oncoming group was about two miles away, the men now fanning
out. "Six there," said Miller.</p>

<p>Pairvent's glance covered the whole distance around him. The
ridge was two miles behind them and to the south of them; the river
and the safety of the river's width was three miles ahead. They
were in the open, no shelter at either hand; and Pairvent's narrow
face expressed all this, showing a kind of disgust at the tactical
error made.</p>

<p>"Better get this clear between us now," he said. "What do you
propose to do? Run or stand? Wait and argue, or start shootin' when
they get in range?"</p>

<p>"Wait until they get here. We'll meet whatever bet they
make."</p>

<p>"Well," said Miller in a practical voice, "they're just about
here."</p>

<p>The oncoming riders closed the distance, spreading as they ran.
He heard the steady scud of the horses and he saw Stuart's big body
and he got the outflung echo of Stuart's voice, the words not
clear. Coleman made a short signal with his hand and rode outward
from the beef; the rest of Horsehead came up and sat beside him.
Alvy crowded his horse beside Pairvent. Ed Drum pushed in toward
Alvy. Coleman said: "Spread out&mdash;spread out. No firing unless
they fire first. Alvy, remember that." He said no more to them.
Star Cross rushed in and stopped thirty feet away and the dust of
their running came on over them and moved cloudy across the gap and
its gray silky substance touched Coleman's face and became a taste
in his mouth.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. THE SHADOW OF A HANGING</h2>

<p class="first">THERE were six of them, as Ray Miller had said.
Coleman had seen three of them before. Stuart and Tap and one other
man&mdash;these same three standing together in the Star Cross yard
the previous morning; he had noticed the creep of desire in their
eyes then, and he noticed it now. It was clearer now, and Stuart's
vein-netted face was gray with strain, with pleasure.</p>

<p>"You," he said. "Stand fast. You&mdash;kid there&mdash;hold your
hand away from your gun. Turn around, all of you. Start ridin' for
timber."</p>

<p>Tap dryly spoke. "Better unbuckle 'em first."</p>

<p>Stuart said: "Put up your hands. Ride toward me. You first,
Coleman." Then he let his satisfaction have its brutal play. "One
hour from now you're six thieves swingin' on the rope, the buzzards
pokin' at your eyes."</p>

<p>Coleman sat still, hands folded on the saddle horn. His legs
were straight down in the stirrups and his shoulders were rounded
and somewhat bent. He looked from beneath the brim of his hat at
Stuart, so that his face was shadowed and flat. He held Stuart's
eyes as he would have gripped the man's shoulders with his hands;
he neither moved nor spoke.</p>

<p>Stuart let out a passionate yell. "Move up!"</p>

<p>"Old man," said Coleman, "this beef was never sold to you and it
never belonged to you. I'm takin' it back. Then I'm goin' to comb
your range until I get every cow that's mine."</p>

<p>"Move up!" repeated Stuart in his high, half-strangled
voice.</p>

<p>"We're not movin'. We're goin' over the river with this beef. It
is up to you to start the fight. Think carefully before you do.
You're old and you're fat&mdash;and how long has it been since you
tried to beat a man to the draw? You can't do it. When you draw,
old man, you're dead. But try it if you've got to."</p>

<p>"Shoot him down," said Tap's voice, as though from a great
distance. "Shoot him down."</p>

<p>"Ray," said Coleman, "Tap's your meat if he moves."</p>

<p>He had never ceased to watch Dan Stuart, whose eyes were crowded
with the greatness of his desire to destroy. The man, Coleman
guessed, had never been seriously crossed, his temper had fed on
easy victories and on a power that had not been challenged. This is
what he had guessed the day before in the Star Cross yard, this was
what he had sensed. The stand he made now was based on that guess,
and so he held his motionless attitude and he continued to meet
that violent stare. Stuart, having spoken and having been refused,
now remained silent&mdash;and his silence seemed to be odd to his
crew, for Tap said again: "What will it be, Mr. Stuart?"</p>

<p>"Your boss," said Coleman, "is tryin' to figure whether this is
a good day to die."</p>

<p>He slid it gently at Stuart and he saw the big man's face lose
its harsh lines of triumph. He saw doubt creep into lip corner and
he recognized an expression of remote breakage, of deep inward
shame and loss of certainty. Before him, as these tight hot moments
went on, a man changed and in changing he destroyed much of
himself. It was Stuart who in the end took his eyes from Coleman
and dropped them. He put his hands on the saddle horn and he stared
at his hands, and the corners of his shoulders lost their
squareness; and then his own riders caught the sense of what had
happened and certainty went out of all of them and Tap cast a
bitter glance upon Coleman for the destruction accomplished and
seemed to grit his teeth together. Abruptly Stuart turned his horse
and rode away. He had left no command behind him; therefore Tap
murmured, "Let's go," and led the crew on Stuart's heels. Coleman
waited until Star Cross was well beyond gunshot.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "we'll move on."</p>

<p>They pulled the strayed beef together and moved it westward.
Alvy and Ed Drum riding swing. Baldy once more dropped back with
his rifle. Pairvent and Miller were at the rear of the stock with
Coleman; and nobody said anything. They wasted half an hour at the
ford getting the cattle across. Once west of the river Coleman
said, "Let them drift," and set off for the ranch with the outfit,
arriving there in the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<p>The kid, he saw, had a swagger to him as he moved away. The kid
was making himself big again, and riding for another fall. He
stored the thought in his mind, meanwhile observing Pairvent. The
foreman had brooded over the clash with Star Cross all the way
home, "I do not understand," said Pairvent. "I never saw Stuart
back up before a man before."</p>

<p>"Who," inquired Coleman, "has stood up to him recently?"</p>

<p>Pairvent pulled his eyelids together as he thought. "Can't
rightly remember."</p>

<p>"He was runnin' on a reputation."</p>

<p>"How'd you know that?" asked Pairvent.</p>

<p>"I made a guess."</p>

<p>"Damned long chance to take on a guess."</p>

<p>Coleman made up a smoke, his back propped to the corral post.
Ray Miller was near by, listening to the talk, a set grin on his
rough face. Coleman got the cigarette lighted. "Not so long a
chance, George. A man can be the world's best fighter and still be
stopped without a shot. There are few men in this world who will
stand in front of another man, twenty feet away, and risk a pull
unless they're dead sure they've got better than an even chance.
Stuart wasn't sure."</p>

<p>"I will tell you something," said Pairvent, "You sent him down
in the eyes of the Basin. You made a monkey out of him. He will
think about that until it turns him crazy. Then he'll go at you in
ways that ain't white. There's a streak in Dan Stuart like the
bloody streak in an Indian. He won't rest now until he's got you
fryin' over a fire."</p>

<p>"I observed that," said Coleman.</p>

<p>Pairvent growled, "You observe a hell of a lot." Then he
remembered his own position and the thought turned him sour again,
"Since you're so good with your eyes&mdash;what you think I'll be
doin'?"</p>

<p>"You'll play this hand through with me until you figure a chance
to get me in a corner," said Coleman. "I have got to watch out for
you, George. You want Horsehead."</p>

<p>Anger danced hot and dangerous in Pairvent's secretive eyes; he
turned on his heel and walked away. Miller's grin increased. He was
laughing without a sound and after that he did a curious
thing&mdash;he struck the top corral bar with his fist so hard that
the bar sent out a hollow echo as it vibrated and he gave Coleman
the benefit of his sly amusement and strolled toward the bunkhouse.
That brute power had come out of him like a gust in an otherwise
windless day, unexpected and unexplained. Going on to the main
house, to Valencia waiting on the porch for him, Coleman tried to
fathom the man.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Ann Stuart watched her father leave Star Cross early in the
morning, with the crew. From the house porch she followed the dust
of their traveling, as they scouted in and out of the low hills.
She knew the reason for it and she therefore understood the meaning
of the second cloud of dust straight to the west, around ten
o'clock. That cloud later vanished and the dust of her father's
party faded out into the timber farther north. Thereafter she could
only wait, and the waiting was hard. Near noon she saw a party come
out from the hill road, straight west again, moving
slowly&mdash;and at last identified her father at the head of the
Star Cross men. All six were along, which caused her a great deal
of relief, but the slowness of her father's traveling puzzled her
and when he came into the yard the grayness of his skin and the
droop of his shoulders also puzzled her. There was nothing to be
read on the face of Tap, or on the faces of the others. They pulled
away at once and went to the deeper part of the yard. Her father
stepped from his horse, came to the porch and sat down.</p>

<p>She said: "What happened?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, no more communicative now than at any other
time. Still, there was a difference in him. He looked old and he
looked tired. The heavy thrust of intolerant energy was gone. His
face was sallow to her and bitterness made its claw scratches at
his mouth corners. He sat motionless in the chair with his hands
lying palms up on his lap, and looked out upon the land as a man
might do whose active days were over.</p>

<p>She tried once again. "Did you have trouble?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk," he said.</p>

<p>She went back through the house and out into the rear yard. Tap
sat in the shade of the pumphouse, nursing a cigarette, brooding
over some injury.</p>

<p>"Tap," she said, "what went wrong?"</p>

<p>She hated the man, as he well knew; and therefore he was always
civil and evasive with her. Yet on this occasion he spoke readily,
as though he had to talk.</p>

<p>"We came across that fellow Coleman with his crew, runnin' our
beef back to his side. We stopped him. This Coleman&mdash;" and
here Tap stopped and appeared to review the incredible thing in his
mind&mdash;"sat tight and faced your dad down. That was all. We
came home like cur dogs. Coleman took the beef."</p>

<p>"That vented beef?"</p>

<p>"Beef which was on our grass," he said, "vented or not."</p>

<p>"But he claimed it to be Horsehead's?"</p>

<p>"That," said Tap, "is not the point. The point is he faced us
down and we gave out. That is the point."</p>

<p>Tap was suffering as her father suffered. It tore at his loyalty
to the ranch, it poisoned his faith in himself, and presently he
said in a dead tone: "It happened. I do not know why. I think I
will have to kill that fellow myself. There'll be no rest for me or
for your father until it is done. By God. I will do it, too!"</p>

<p>She went back to the house and stood in the living room,
watching her father through the open doorway. He sat like an
invalid whose strength came to him drop by drop; and she knew then,
from Tap's explanation, how great were the gaps torn in his spirit
and how increasingly his wounds would pain him. He was a man who
had never been crossed and he had built a legend around himself and
lived by that legend. Now it was partly destroyed and the shock had
stilled him.</p>

<p>She could not feel sympathy or sorrow for him. Those were
emotions he had driven from her heart; but she did feel pity, and
she went out and put a hand to his shoulder. "Goes bad sometimes,"
she said.</p>

<p>He had no grace to receive pity. It stung his vanity and he
moved his shoulder until her hand fell away. He gave her a familiar
glance of dislike. He got up from the chair and went to his horse
and he stood by it, thinking. Presently he said: "Next time you see
Drew Trumbo, ask him to come see me."</p>

<p>"You hate him. Why should you want to see him?"</p>

<p>"That's not important right now. Go see him and tell him."</p>

<p>He reached the saddle after a slow pull and rode north. It was
then one o'clock or after; at three he reached War Bonnet, took a
pair of drinks at the saloon and went on to the Alma. He sat there,
alone again, and again thinking of his injuries. By and by he got
some paper from the clerk and returned to his chair and found a
pencil and slowly wrote a notice on two pieces. Having done it he
left the Alma, crossed to the general store to buy a box of tacks,
and returned to the hotel. He tacked one of the notices to the
hotel wall and left town, riding toward Gunderson's ranch. A few
miles out of town he put up the second notice on the side of an
abandoned log hut.</p>

<p>Coming out of the hills. Ben Solvay saw and read the notice. He
tore it from the wall and started for Horsehead, thirty miles
away.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
It had been one of late summer's hot days and now at twilight.
Coleman, sitting on the porch steps, heat came up from the earth to
render out the keen blends of the earth. The moon rolled along the
edge of the mountains, reddened by summer's dust. Valencia came
quietly from the house and stood near him; and at last, with a
quick motion, sat beside him. There was, away over to the north,
the small run of a traveler; that and a coyote's cry. Valencia
said: "He's against the world, too. He has no friends."</p>

<p>He turned and he saw the small smile she had. He felt the
turbulence of her spirit around him as a man might feel strange
currents cut across the wind's major run. She was a white core of
light in darkness, a personality of fragrance and will, a stubborn
spirit set against the world. She had wanted many things and had
been betrayed by her wants; yet she still had them. She was still
proud.</p>

<p>"Tracy," she said, "they will never drive you away." The
fighting streak in her made her voice lift. "Never let them! Tooth
for tooth and claw for claw."</p>

<p>"Kind of a sad world that way," he reflected.</p>

<p>"You're strange. Everything's been hard for you, and you are
hard. But not hard in the way I know men can be."</p>

<p>"Known men like that?"</p>

<p>"Most of them have been like that." All the heat and resistance
of her experiences seemed to rise from her, "My trouble was in
asking for too much. It was never money or clothes, even though
those things seemed wonderful to the daughter of a poor woman. It
was more than that&mdash;to be alive and to be important. Not to be
beaten, not to grow fat and afraid, not to be just a piece of dust
lost in the road. A man would call it adventure. But men do not
like a woman to hunt adventure. It makes the woman cheap to them.
That has made me bitter. I have had to fight and hold my own part.
I could never be very soft. Men watch for softness in a woman and
then betray the woman. My own ambition has betrayed me. I have
believed too much. I have hoped for too much."</p>

<p>"I see softness in you."</p>

<p>"I have let you see it," she said, and turned to him. "I wanted
you to see what I really am. Goodness can't die out just because of
a mistake. A shadow can be perfect, but we weren't made to be
shadows. I have been lonely. I have never found what I wanted."</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "neither have I."</p>

<p>"I know," she murmured. "It is in your eyes. What is the woman
like&mdash;the woman you want?"</p>

<p>He sat still and made no immediate answer; wherefore she knew
the question reached into his deepest places. The picture of that
woman was in him, colored and rounded and given life by all the
dreaming a man spends upon his private images; she knew men well
enough to understand that. Yet there were no words which would
completely describe what he felt, and even if he found the words
which came closest to his desire, he would be reluctant to express
them. She sat near him, wanting him in a way she had wanted no man;
and wanting to be seen by him not as the world judged her, but as
she knew herself still to be, a woman of depth and goodness, with
loyalty crying in her to be claimed, with a faith that once fixed
would be as rock all her life. And then she asked herself a forlorn
question.</p>

<p>"What have I really lost that a man needs?"</p>

<p>He hadn't answered and she knew he would not answer; and so she
understood that his feeling in the matter was very strong, as she
had suspected. She watched his face&mdash;the sometimes homely and
sometimes recklessly expressive face of a man who lived his life in
action. He felt her glance and turned to her and he smiled and then
he was a man of charm, a man aware of her closeness, a man
straining on the leash of his reserve. She sat still, waiting for
that reserve to break; wishing for it and making herself desirable
to him by her smile. His thoughts came hard upon her, so near she
saw the change in his eyes, and she thought: "Perhaps now."</p>

<p>Out on the flat grassland a rider moved rapidly, inbound.
Coleman rose and stepped into the yard, waiting; the horseman came
in, wheeled to a stand and announced himself.</p>

<p>"Coleman? This is Frank DeLeon."</p>

<p>"Light," said Coleman.</p>

<p>The houselight touched him as he dismounted and walked
forward&mdash;a tall man made thin by long years; he had white
mustaches and a face seamed by weather and natural wisdom. The
wisdom had given him kindness and kindness was printed on his
face.</p>

<p>"I have heard news of you," he said. "You went over to Star
Cross and took Stuart's beef?"</p>

<p>"Horsehead beef with a sale vent on it&mdash;and his brand
below. Then have been no sales from Horsehead. That beef belonged
to us."</p>

<p>"So," said Frank DeLeon. He considered Coleman over an adequate
silence, an old man who had seen many a year run by, witnessed many
a sad thing, and had seen some happiness, "I have heard of this
venting business," he said at last, "None of it on my place. I
liked old Ben-Tim. He was my friend."</p>

<p>"That is what he told me."</p>

<p>"He would be the man to remember," said DeLeon. "A high wind
goin' down the road&mdash;that was Ben-Tim. I do not doubt the beef
was illegally vented and I do not deny it belongs to you, wherever
you may find it now." He paused to consider what was best to say,
and how far he might go in speaking, "But you will have difficulty
in claiming it. The Basin never likes to see grass goin' to waste
and after Ben-Tim left this place to foremen it went sour. The
Basin declared it a maverick outfit. Just threw it back to open
land, free for the fellow that claimed it."</p>

<p>"Who claims it?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Frank DeLeon, "the boys never got around to agreein'
on that. They been jealous of each other."</p>

<p>"I have seen a lot of country," said Coleman, "but I have never
before seen a vent brand used to cover a steal, except by
rustlers."</p>

<p>"This is the Basin," said Frank DeLeon, "and the Basin is
different. Matter of fact it is a clever idea. They will claim they
bought it. When you come to take it back, with that vent mark
showing a sale, you will be the rustler, son. Not them. They will
have public reason to hang you higher than a kite."</p>

<p>"Let them prove they bought it."</p>

<p>"Can you prove it wasn't sold to them?" pointed out Frank
DeLeon. "You can't. You're new here. They know that. As I said, it
is a clever idea."</p>

<p>"Cleverness has an answer. I will make it."</p>

<p>"That," said Frank DeLeon, "is what I have wondered." Once again
he put the search of his old, blue eyes on Coleman. "I believe you
will. You have backed Stuart down, which is a mighty queer thing.
But he will come again. Therefore you had better know the politics
of this country. Stuart does what he wishes pretty much. He drags
some of the rest of the boys along simply by the power of his heavy
hand. Gunderson and Bill Yell and Mitch Lovelace and Hack Dobbin
are under his thumb. If he raises a posse after you, he will draw
on that crowd. Then there's Hoby Spade and Clyde Medary and me. I
will not be against you. Spade and Medary may be against you, but
they will not fight for Stuart. They do not like him. More likely
you'll find Spade and Medary doing whatever Drew Trumbo does.
There's your man. Find out what he's going to do."</p>

<p>"What's he want?"</p>

<p>"He wants Horsehead."</p>

<p>The flat sounding board of the prairie lifted the echoes of
another traveler.</p>

<p>"Coming fast," said DeLeon, "In this country trouble always
travels fast."</p>

<p>He returned to his horse and stepped up and he sat in the
saddle, considering the yard; and then for the first time noticed
the girl who had been so quietly placed in the shadows.
Automatically he lifted his hat to her, his gesture an old-
fashioned full sweep of his arm. Coleman said: "My guest. Valencia
Wilder."</p>

<p>DeLeon bowed deep in the saddle. "Solvay's lady? My
congratulations to him." The rider on the flat grass came in at a
long-reaching gallop. Frank DeLeon said: "Good luck," and faded
into the pines.</p>

<p>Hardly had he done so when the new rider whirled before the
porch and brought up.</p>

<p>"Coleman," he said, "you have started your fun." His horse
carried him into the beam of house light and he stepped quickly
down. It was Solvay, his square cheeks a little more wooden than
usual. He saw Valencia and said, "Good evenin'," and searched
himself and brought forth the paper he had pulled from the cabin on
the road to Gunderson's.</p>

<p>"That's for you to read," he said and handed it to Coleman.</p>

<p>There were other ears in the yard. Pairvent moved forward from
the darkness, and Ray Miller came along. Pairvent said: "What's
up?"</p>

<p>Coleman first read the note to himself and then
aloud:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">NOTICE TO THE BASIN<br>
<br>
Today at eleven o'clock, on the flats of Star Cross just east of
Monument Ridge, I came upon the outlaw members of the Horsehead
crew, led by one Coleman, in the act of running some twenty head of
Star Cross beef west to the river. Summoned to stand and deliver
said cattle, Coleman refused and drove the stock away. Witnesses in
this act of open rustling were five members of my crew. The
following men are the rustlers:&mdash;Coleman, George Pairvent, Ray
Miller, the kid Alvy, Baldy Bickle, old Ed Drum.<br>
<br>
For each of these men I offer the reward of five hundred dollars,
to be paid by me on evidence of their capture, or on evidence of
their being killed resisting capture. The same sum for each. At the
same time, I give notice of the intention of Coleman to continue
rustling, as stated to me, and I hereby call on volunteers to
surround Horsehead quarters and take the said Coleman and his men
into custody. Failing this aid at the hands of the other
respectable men of the Basin, I propose to move against Horsehead
myself and hang the crew.<br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">Dan Stuart</span></p>
<br>

<p>Ben Solvay said: "There's your fun. Coleman."</p>

<p>Pairvent murmured: "I told you he'd put the rope over us all. We
played into his hands, like he wanted."</p>

<p>"Our beef," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"By God," flashed out Pairvent, "what difference does that make?
The man's got us."</p>

<p>"We'll be here when he comes," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"Talk for yourself," said Pairvent.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Coleman. "You can run away from the charge of bein'
a rustler, which makes you one, all the way down the trail." He
turned and he gave Pairvent a square, head-on glance, "I can't
stand a man around me without guts!"</p>

<p>Pairvent brought a hand straight down before him, striking air;
he wheeled about and groaned and walked into the black. Ray Miller,
on the edge of the shadows, looked at Coleman with a rough grin and
retreated.</p>

<p>Solvay stood in his tracks, listening. He watched Pairvent and
Miller go and he followed Coleman with his glance as Coleman moved
to the porch. Then Solvay saw the girl and noticed how closely she
kept her eyes on Coleman. It hauled him up from his other
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Ben," said Coleman, "do you know of a better place to put
Valencia?"</p>

<p>Valencia swung her glance swiftly to Coleman, astonished. She
murmured, "I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>"No," Coleman said, "you wouldn't be afraid."</p>

<p>Ben Solvay was angry at himself. He thought: "You damned fool,
what did you leave her here for?" Then he said aloud: "No use of
her movin'. But I'll stay. It might be somethin' new."</p>

<p>He still watched Valencia and he wished he knew, as she turned
her eyes to him, what lay behind the brief and curious glance she
gave him. It didn't last long; she put her attention back to
Coleman. Ben wheeled and grabbed the reins of his horse and led it
to the rear yard's corral. He took off the riding gear and he moved
over to a stack of hay and threw several armloads into the corral.
He took up his gear and strolled to the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>The Horsehead crew had gathered there and they gave him a cold
shoulder. He stared back at each man and he said in his dry, common
voice: "You can quit cheerin' anytime."</p>

<p>"You're a damned long way from home," said Baldy, giving forth
no welcome.</p>

<p>"And in damned poor company," promptly replied Ben Solvay. "You
got any notion to crowd me?"</p>

<p>"What's the hell's your hurry?" growled Baldy.</p>

<p>"If I'm hurryin'," said Ben, "it ain't backward." He pause and
awaited the fruit of this remark. Baldy shrugged his shoulders and
concluded to push no farther; whereupon Ben Solvay picked himself
an empty bunk and climbed into it. He hung up gun and belt on the
bunk's edge. He removed his hat and shoes. Having undressed, he
rolled the saddle blanket around him and lay back to stare at the
bunkhouse ceiling.</p>

<p>He was in a frame of mind both injured and self-condemning. He
had given over the girl to Coleman and the blame was his. Yet had
he not said he would be back to claim her within the week? To
himself he honestly admitted he had never intended coming
back&mdash;but it was a blow to return and to find her looking not
at him but at Coleman. He had felt poorly at himself for proposing
to welsh on his bargain; what stung him was that Valencia had
changed her mind ahead of him.</p>

<p>He lay wholly still and had it out with himself. This was not
the woman, plain and straight, he had in his mind at all; she was
something else and he did not want her. Still, she had stayed with
him every moment since he had left her, a picture that would not
leave his head, and she had drawn him here and she had raked up in
him painful and unreasonable feelings he had not previously
known.</p>

<p>He rolled a cigarette and smoked it through. The rest of the
crew had turned in and one of the men had already begun to snore.
Pairvent blew out the light. Long sleepless in the dark, Ben Solvay
saw no answer. He did not want her, yet he had not the power of
breaking her picture in his mind.</p>

<p>Coleman was still smoking on the porch when Valencia rose. She
said, "Good night," and paused long enough to see his face turn in
the shadows to her. He answered her and the sound of his voice
played through her like warmth as she went to her room. She made
herself ready for bed and she turned the light low on the stand and
thought of him because she could think of nothing else. He knew
what she was and still, when he looked at her, it was with good
eyes, a decent man looking at a decent woman. He saw something in
her other men had not taken time to see; he made her sure of
herself again, after long unsureness.</p>

<p>She thought: "If he should want me in any way at all. I'd open
the door. Perhaps he knows that too. But I wish it were possible
for him to want me the nice and right way. Is that too much to
hope? If he did I'd scrub these floors and be happy."</p>

<p>She heard Coleman's heavy steps go along the hall and turn in to
the opposite room. She thought he walked slowly and that made her
heart beat faster; she listened to his boots fall to the floor and
she heard his weight sink into the bed. Quietness came to the house
and nothing stirred on the ranch. She remained long wide-awake,
acutely aware of the big man across the hall, half- fearing and
half-hoping to hear him rise and cross to her door. Even as she had
seen the good things in his eyes, she had seen also the man-hunger
there. He was of that mixture.</p>

<p>In his room, Coleman did the small, methodical things he had
always done. He wound his watch and laid it on the stand. He hung
up gun and belt over the bed's post and laid his boots together
directly at the bed's side so that he could swing immediately into
them. He draped his pants over a chair and made up three
cigarettes; one he lighted and two he placed on the chair within
hand reach&mdash;one for the middle of the night if he awoke and
one as soon as he rose for breakfast.</p>

<p>As he smoked he sat on the edge of the bed, feeling the nearness
of Valencia. She was a powerful enough influence to be felt in the
whole house and the image of her troubled him. He thought of her
with a heavy, insistent appetite. He pulled his mind away from her
by force, but his mind went back. He brought his jaws together,
scowling and dissatisfied with himself, and he passed a hand over
his face and got up in his bare feet and prowled the room. He came
to his door and stopped and his swift desire to open the door
jarred him. He had his hand on the knob. Heat came into his face,
sticking his skin like needles. He moved away from the door and
made a complete circle of the room and sat down on the bed again.
He bent over, bringing his hands together. He thought: "She
deserves better than that. Man's full of evil. What have I got to
hope for, thinkin' like this?"</p>

<p>He turned out the light and rolled into bed. It had been a long
day and he was weary; the last ten minutes had raked him hard. He
was ashamed of himself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. GAME OF FREEZE-OUT</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Dan Stuart returned from War Bonnet, he found
his daughter had not left Star Cross that day.</p>

<p>"You didn't go see Trumbo?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. You've got a scheme up your sleeve."</p>

<p>"If I'd told you to stay away from the man," he observed
savagely, "you would have gone to him at once."</p>

<p>She met his iron-surly eyes; she shook her head.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed you'd be willing to turn me over to a man you
hated for the sake of getting what you wanted out of him."</p>

<p>He flung his fist unexpectedly at her. Just before he struck her
he opened his hand so that the flat of it caught her on the
shoulder and threw her against the house wall. He stood before her,
heavy of breath, unashamed and brutally aroused.</p>

<p>"If you were a boy I would have smashed in your face!"</p>

<p>"You have hurt me much worse in other ways," she said to
him.</p>

<p>"You're like your mother&mdash;your head is full of empty fool
things!"</p>

<p>"She must have been so sad, so lonely."</p>

<p>"Why?" cried out Dan Stuart, "I gave her a home and I fed her
and she hated me for it, like you."</p>

<p>"She had to endure living with you," said Ann. She had never
before permitted herself to say so harsh a thing; and the effect of
it in him was immediate. He gave her a glance of uncontrolled
hatred, "Your mother," he said, "set herself against me, like
you're doing. She would never see things my way."</p>

<p>"You wanted somebody you could whip and bully and you wanted her
to crawl back and lick your hand in gratitude."</p>

<p>"You know nothing of it!"</p>

<p>"I did not know her. I know you."</p>

<p>He was always a dangerous man when stung. She felt herself to be
in danger now, and she faced him with her cool calm manner and knew
he hated this above all. He could not endure resistance. He drew a
great breath.</p>

<p>"We have got to have a talk when I get this other business
settled. If you are not with me, then you are against me&mdash;and
if you are against me you cannot stay under this roof."</p>

<p>He stamped heavily across the yard and found Tap. "Ride over to
Trumbo's and tell him I want to see him."</p>

<p>Tap was a loyal man but the suggestion that Star Cross should
traffic with one of its enemies offended him.</p>

<p>"He's not for us," he complained.</p>

<p>"Go do it," said Stuart.</p>

<p>Tap went off, saying no more. The idea rankled him all across
the desert and into the timber. This was a sin against Star Cross
and a flaw in Dan Stuart. If a man was your enemy he could not
overnight be your friend. You stuck to what was; you didn't change.
This is what he thought as he came carefully down upon Trumbo's
yard and hailed Trumbo from the house. Remaining in the shadows.
Tap said: "Mr. Stuart says he'd like to talk to you," and rode
away.</p>

<p>Trumbo listened as Tap's horse ran upgrade into the timber. A
small wind came from the south, softly washing through the
treetops. Trumbo built a cigarette and reached for a match, but
before he lighted it he looked carefully at the dark yard and then
turned to the wall and cupped the match so that it would not betray
him. He played the message around his mind, seeking the meaning of
it. Stuart despised him. Stuart, never a fool, had smelled ambition
in him and Stuart could not stand ambition in other men. There was
but one throne and one king to sit on it; all others aspiring to
power were dangerous.</p>

<p>Something lay behind the message and he did not propose to move
into a trap. Stuart, maybe, would be wanting a solid Basin front to
move against Coleman. Trumbo, who was no sentimentalist, had an
amused afterthought: "Just to make the steal look a little better."
Still, it was hard to believe that so tough a fellow as Stuart
would be asking for help&mdash;and therefore lay himself open to
payment for that help&mdash;against Horsehead. How could Coleman
fight back, with a crew that was no good at all? "More to it than I
see now," he thought. With that in mind he saddled his horse and
headed for town.</p>

<p>He reached War Bonnet near midnight and stopped at the saloon
for a drink; and there he heard the story of the day. Coleman had
backed Stuart down. Stuart had posted his notice; the long expected
close-out of Horsehead was finally coming. Trumbo got all this from
the saloon keeper, Snass Moran, during the course of a drink. He
went on to the Alma and took a room and sat on the edge of the bed,
thinking it over. Presently, he grinned to himself and went to
bed.</p>

<p>With breakfast under his belt next morning, he struck out for
Horsehead, arriving there by eight o'clock and catching Coleman in
the yard. The crew was back by the bunkhouse, horses saddled and
ready to travel. Pairvent was moving forward but as soon as he saw
Trumbo he halted, stared a moment and wheeled away, to vanish
behind the house. Coleman said: "Mornin' Trumbo. Light."</p>

<p>Trumbo got down. He was as large a man as Coleman, with a
breadth to his shoulders and a naturally ruddy face in which sat a
pair of bold blue eyes, a hawk-shaped nose and a firm, laughing
mouth. He had complete confidence in himself and he displayed a
worldliness that said plain as words: "All men have a price."</p>

<p>He didn't offer his hand when he came up. "Came for a visit," he
drawled and noticed Valencia come to the porch. He lifted his hat
at once and smiled. The smile was slightly off, somewhat knowing,
and Coleman felt a slow ruffle of temper go through him. Coleman
said: "Had breakfast?"</p>

<p>"At War Bonnet. I hear you played hell yesterday."</p>

<p>"Any vented stock over your way?" asked Coleman bluntly.</p>

<p>He never would have asked so pointed a question elsewhere. The
Basin manners had gotten at him. Trumbo grinned but the grin was
guarded. "A sudden way of putting it."</p>

<p>"I'll be collectin' from now on," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"Let's wait until you get my way before we discuss it," said
Trumbo. All this while, Coleman understood, the man was figuring
him. "I wanted to talk business with you."</p>

<p>Valencia's steps went over the porch, retreating, and for a
moment Trumbo's glance followed her and the sight of her made a
feeling on his face. He brought his eyes back quickly, as though he
had permitted himself an unguarded moment.</p>

<p>"Talk it," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"There was a notice posted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I saw it," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"He would have been after your hide sooner or later. You've just
rushed matters."</p>

<p>"I'll be here when he comes."</p>

<p>"You backed him down, true. But he'll have help when he comes
again."</p>

<p>"You'll be with him?" asked Coleman.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Trumbo. "Maybe not. He's sent his bid to me, which
is a strange enough thing, considering how he hates me."</p>

<p>"Why should he hate you?"</p>

<p>"I want Horsehead, same as he does," said Trumbo, "You see? If
he wants me enough to forget a grudge it means he's comin' after
you full tilt. But he knows I won't work with him unless there's
something in it for me."</p>

<p>"What's he offerin'?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Trumbo and gave Coleman a full stare. "What
are you offering?"</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"All of Horsehead east of the river," said Trumbo, "It will make
me a nice range&mdash;and it will leave you plenty."</p>

<p>"No," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"Man," said Trumbo, pointedly patient, "you need some
help&mdash;and where do you think you'll get it? You've got no aces
up your sleeve." Trumbo watched him a long while, "No," he decided,
"you've got none."</p>

<p>"Sooner or later," said Coleman, "I'll be over your way, lookin'
for beef."</p>

<p>Trumbo's smile grew keen, "You'll be gone from here before that
happens. Listen to me. I am in this Basin for all its worth. I play
my own hand strictly. If Stuart's got a good proposition I'll take
it and I'll be back here with him. Don't make any mistakes about
me. You caught Stuart off balance. I am never off guard."</p>

<p>"Glad to know it," said Coleman, "You want to try it now?"</p>

<p>Trumbo ceased to smile and he ceased to be casual. He became
cold and careful and his temper came up within him, but not a
temper that made him rash. "I never do anything just for fun. I
play for chips."</p>

<p>"Whatever Stuart offers you," suggested Coleman, "he'll later
take away. Play with him and you're a sucker."</p>

<p>Trumbo's edged humor returned, "If he makes a deal with me, he's
the sucker. He doesn't know me and neither do you."</p>

<p>"So long," said Coleman.</p>

<p>Trumbo returned to his horse, mounted and wheeled away. He went
twenty feet and returned to Coleman. He was dissatisfied with the
scene and he wanted it right.</p>

<p>"I talked to you straight, figuring you to be a fellow that
didn't fool around with a lot of soft ideas. You're here for what
you can get. If I didn't think that, I would not have wasted my
time coming. I like to get straight to the point. Life's too short
to take the roundabout way. I figure you a tough customer, but you
have made the mistake of playing me down in your mind. When I come
back you'll find me right in front of you and you'll find me right
on your trail."</p>

<p>"So long," repeated Coleman.</p>

<p>Trumbo looked closely at Coleman and he shook his head. "With my
help you could keep half of Horsehead. Otherwise you will lose it
all. That is too bad." He turned again and this time moved straight
out upon the flat grass at a swinging canter. As soon as he left
the trees Coleman lifted his voice.</p>

<p>"George," he called, and waited for Pairvent to come forward.
"George, has he got some of our beef?"</p>

<p>"I'd guess so," said Pairvent in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>"We'll go after it."</p>

<p>Pairvent shook his head, "I won't ride on his range."</p>

<p>"That's what I wanted to know. You sold him the beef and put the
money in your pants."</p>

<p>"God damn your eyes!" growled Pairvent. "You got to see
everything?"</p>

<p>Coleman smiled a little. "Not holdin' it against you. I can
handle Trumbo without you. Meanwhile, you'll stay. We can use each
other up till the showdown."</p>

<p>Pairvent murmured: "What showdown?"</p>

<p>"When you think the time's ripe to turn against me."</p>

<p>"Coleman," sighed Pairvent, "I wish I knew you."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
When Drew Trumbo reached Cloud River he came upon a rowboat
slipping downstream stern foremost, close-hugging the edge of the
bank. Old Tam Malarkey sat in it, checking the boat's speed with
his oars. Old Tam was in his fifties, a gaunt man burned to leather
by the sun and showing a pair of rawhide wrists below a frayed
shirt. An extra set of oarlocks had been fitted to the boat and a
second set of oars lay unshipped across the seats; and a woolly dog
with one calico-colored eye sat on a pile of groceries near the
stern and showed a pink tongue as it panted. Old Tam had rowed
upriver through the easy water, moored his craft and had gone
shank's mare into War Bonnet for a month's supplies, carrying a
hundred pounds on his shoulders back to the boat. Now he would slip
carefully down the river to the brink of Number Seven Rapids, tie
his boat and carry his supplies into the depths of the canyon by
devices and footholds which only he seemed to know. Tam had been in
the canyon twenty years, panning gold lodged in the gravel.</p>

<p>Trumbo hailed him and Tam pulled in to the shore with his old
man's slow and sure pace, wasting no strength. Tam put a foot over
against the gravel, holding the boat still; he pulled out a pipe
with an enormous bowl and filled it and lighted it up, and laid a
wary glance along the glass-bright surface of the river, a veteran
fighter sizing up a long-known and respected opponent. Presently he
turned to Trumbo.</p>

<p>"On the wrong side of the river, ain't you. Drew?"</p>

<p>"Payin' a visit."</p>

<p>Old Tam sucked at the pipe until smoke made a stench around him,
"I never thought I'd see this change."</p>

<p>"Everything is just as it has been. You're a smart old fellow,
Tam, but that river's going to take you downhill someday and you'll
be the new man in Luke Wall's graveyard. Why don't you get out of
it?"</p>

<p>"I like a simple life," said Tam, "and I got it that way. Me and
the river. Nothing more. I know where I stand and I know where the
river stands. Maybe you can say the same thing, but I doubt
it."</p>

<p>"Findin' much gold?"</p>

<p>"A little," admitted Tam. He pulled his foot aboard and let the
boat drift, his oars poised. He watched the river with
shaggy-browed eyes; and then he looked back.</p>

<p>"Good thing there's just a little. If there was very much I'd
have to watch out for you fellows who want things big and easy.
What I got ain't enough to be worth your time. But if it was, you'd
be after it."</p>

<p>He had ignored the river for twenty seconds and that was long
enough; he straightened his boat with his oars and coasted down the
slick and bright water, alert and careful.</p>

<p>Trumbo swung east from the ford, considering the strangeness of
Tam who wanted so little. The point of living was to leave a great
scratch upon the world for everybody to see; to fight for power and
to use whatever set of rules would bring power. In that respect he
had always figured that Stuart had lived a good life, a life true
to the things which drove him. Only in one respect did Stuart show
weakness: he had a mind that never changed. Knowing error, he would
continue with the error, and someday would be destroyed. Trumbo had
analyzed the man many times, he had used Stuart as a text and a
lesson, and he knew he was sharper and more flexible than Stuart.
Therefore he would survive.</p>

<p>Arriving before the Star Cross house late in the morning, he
first saw Ann. She was on a horse, moving out from the yard, and
came immediately to him. He lifted his hat at her and he smiled,
but he knew at once she wasn't pleased.</p>

<p>"Your father," he explained, "wanted to see me."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you came."</p>

<p>He spoke out his surprise, "It would be a nice thing to be
welcome here, wouldn't it? It would mean a lot to you and to
me."</p>

<p>"Do you know why he wants to see you?"</p>

<p>"I can guess," he said, "He wants help."</p>

<p>"Would you make a deal with him?"</p>

<p>She was a fair, tall girl whose presence, whose smile and voice
never failed to stir him. She liked him and he thought they were
near something better than that. At Gateway one night he had taken
her into his arms and he had looked down at her. She had not
protested; she had lifted her eyes and she had watched him in her
thoughtful way. He had tried to kiss her and immediately she had
slipped out of his arms and after that her voice had gone cool, as
though he had pressed too far, too fast. She was not a girl to be
at once known; she had strong feelings and fixed standards and now
he searched himself carefully for an answer which would not bring
to those eyes the shadows of judgment of which he was really
afraid.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you want me to be on your father's side?"</p>

<p>"Not if it is the wrong side, Drew."</p>

<p>She had never told him of her personal affairs; she was very
quiet about her own life. Therefore her point of view puzzled him,
"Star Cross is your side. Ann."</p>

<p>"Not if Star Cross is wrong," she insisted.</p>

<p>Stuart came up to the corrals and stopped near the porch. He
said: "Trumbo, I'd like to see you." He tried to make it civil and
agreeable, but even then it fell short. He was doing something now
against his will, under the greater pressure of his needs. Ann rode
from the yard, bound toward the northern hills at a reaching
canter.</p>

<p>Trumbo advanced to the porch and got down. Stuart's eyes
following him with their loaded harshness. Stuart growled: "Take a
chair."</p>

<p>Trumbo walked to the chair. He stood near it and then he turned
and caught a quick glimpse of Stuart's face again&mdash;its
deep-lined, domineering strength, its blind self- faith. This man
had in him greater capacities for straight brutality than he had so
far shown the Basin. Trumbo said: "I'll stand."</p>

<p>"Stand then," snapped Stuart.</p>

<p>Trumbo smiled his short, pressed smile. "What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>"You remind me of myself when I was a younger man," said Stuart.
"You can grin well enough and you can sing and drink with the boys.
But you're cold as a fish. I spotted that a long time ago."</p>

<p>"Sure you did," said Trumbo. "You've been layin' for me a long
time, too."</p>

<p>"I never let a man get as big as I am," said Stuart. "You've got
the idea of tryin' to be. You got a piece of land too close to me.
I knew what you were up to&mdash;building your stock by slippin' a
calf at a time away from Star Cross. The oldest trick in the
world."</p>

<p>"It wasn't necessary," said Trumbo, still smiling. "Taking
Horsehead beef was easier. I can put a vent brand on their beef as
well as you can."</p>

<p>"Except," said Stuart, "that you had Pairvent bring it to you.
You paid him to rustle his own outfit."</p>

<p>"Easier that way," agreed Trumbo. "You're sore because you
didn't think of it first."</p>

<p>"Then," added Stuart, "not bein' sure of Pairvent, you paid Alvy
to spy on his own outfit for you."</p>

<p>Trumbo's eyes widened. "Know that, too?" he breathed.</p>

<p>Stuart's temper pressed at his self-control, "You have tried to
pull some of the ranchers away from me. I have heard how you
proposed to split Horsehead between yourself and Spade and Medary,
leavin' me out of it."</p>

<p>"Not hard," said Trumbo, "I can get along with those men. You
always use a club over them. I offered those boys a piece of
Horsehead for their trouble. What have you offered? You want them
to help you take Horsehead but you don't want to give them any of
it. If you're going to use a man for a sucker, Stuart, you've got
to give him something."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" Stuart said, throwing the thing at him
bluntly.</p>

<p>"Give me the Horsehead ranch quarters and the range west of the
river&mdash;and the stock on it. That leaves you the country east
of the river. The river's a proper boundary."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask for it all?" said Stuart, using a heavy
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Because," Trumbo coolly answered, "I'm not big enough to take
it all."</p>

<p>"Or any of it," retorted Stuart.</p>

<p>"What did you call me here for, then?" demanded Trumbo.</p>

<p>"To give you a chance for a little gravy," said Stuart. "Not for
the whole meal."</p>

<p>"You've tried to get the other outfits to help you clean out
Horsehead," guessed Trumbo. "But they held back. So you sent for
me. You wouldn't play pool with a man you hated unless there was no
other way out of it. I'm here but you don't like me any better than
you did&mdash;and you never will. Point is, you need me."</p>

<p>"All you've got is one set of arms," said Stuart. "No crew."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why you called me in. You're too old to lay a gun
on Coleman and come out first best. You can't figure any of your
crew doin' it either. It is a tough outfit you're proposin' to
fight. But you know I can meet him and you know I can pull
faster."</p>

<p>"How would I know that?" said Stuart.</p>

<p>Trumbo gave Stuart a long, straight-pushing glance. "You went to
a lot of trouble, some time ago, to look up my record before I came
to the Basin. I heard about it from some of my friends down the
trail. You found out didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I found out. You were too fast with your gun too many
times."</p>

<p>"That's why you want me," said Trumbo. He was smiling, now
knowing he had his man.</p>

<p>Stuart stood glum and bitter on the porch, hating every bit of
this scene. But he had a greater hatred, rising from the
humiliation Coleman had put upon him. So he said in a heavy voice:
"It is a deal. I will see Hoby Spade. I want him along. I'll be by
for you when the right day comes."</p>

<p>Trumbo went to his horse and climbed to the saddle. He looked
back at Stuart and he thought he saw a changed expression on the
man's face, a half-hidden satisfaction. Stuart was thinking that he
had done this piece of work well; that when Coleman was out of the
way, it would be no great thing to put Trumbo also out of the way.
It was on the end of Trumbo's tongue to say this much, but he held
his peace and rode on. He had his own schemes.</p>

<p>He rode over the yellow grass to the Star Cross hills, and
turned to keep within the timber, as he traveled home. Now and then
he saw the Horsehead plain below him through the pines, all yellow
with summer; and presently he noticed a flare of dust far out near
the river. He kept his eye on it as he rode, now losing it as the
trees thickened, now seeing it again. It was, he thought, a string
of cattle moving toward water; but in another ten minutes he
stopped and looked more closely. Cattle, by their own impulse,
never trudged along that steadily, or that fast. Therefore they
were being driven. Suddenly, struck by forewarning, he left the
ridge on the run and pointed west.</p>

<p>It took him an hour to reach the driven stock. Long before he
got there he knew what had happened. He counted five men with the
beef and he counted the beef itself as it strung along. There were
seventy or eighty head moving steadily away from his range. He
began to curse aloud long before any of the Horsehead crew could
hear him; he cursed the ranch and he cursed every man on it and
when he came to Pairvent he cried out: "I will kill him, by God I
will, for playing me both ways!" He looked for Pairvent and then
saw that the foreman was not with the crew. Three hundred yards
away he pinned his glance to Tracy Coleman and he drove at Coleman,
straight on; and only the deep calculating cold streak which was in
him saved him from drawing as he came. He stopped, watching Coleman
quietly turn his horse half-around. Coleman's face was bone-hard
and his eyes were wide-open, wicked and quiet.</p>

<p>"Damn your soul!" cried Trumbo.</p>

<p>Coleman laid a flat order on Trumbo, "Keep your hands on that
saddle unless you mean to fight."</p>

<p>"I met worse men than you and lived to see them buried!" snarled
Trumbo.</p>

<p>"Watch your hands." repeated Coleman. "I will not tell you
again."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you rustle my range when I was around!" yelled
Trumbo.</p>

<p>"I told you I'd be over. Now I'll tell you something else.
You've got a lot of fat stuff grazin' your grass, mostly borrowed
from Horsehead. I'll come again."</p>

<p>"No," said Trumbo, "you'll never come again."</p>

<p>"Say your piece," said Coleman, "and do what you plan to do.
We're wastin' time."</p>

<p>Trumbo sized up the crew, holding himself on even balance. Alvy
the kid was at the head of the column, walking as the beef walked,
but looking back over his shoulder. Ed Drum and Baldy moved on.
Coleman stood fast and behind him was Ray Miller, showing a
squinted smile. Trumbo gritted his teeth together. "You're waitin'
for me to be a fool." He gripped the pommel with both hands and he
squeezed his strength into them and sighed. His coolness returned.
Raising his reins, he said: "I will see you in good enough time,"
and trotted away.</p>

<p>Miller looked after Trumbo, until the latter was far beyond
range. He said to Coleman: "Now there's a boy which has smelled
powder somewhere. Didn't realize that till just now."</p>

<p>"It is written all over him. Time to push on."</p>

<p>Ray Miller's weather-tight grin remained. He said: "Now you're a
great hand to figure&mdash;and you been figurin' the boys on
Horsehead pretty close. How you got me figured?"</p>

<p>Coleman looked at him, "Rather have you on my side than against
me, Ray."</p>

<p>"I like most any kind of a fight," said Ray. "Always been that
way with me."</p>

<p>"One's coming."</p>

<p>"Then," said Ray, "I'm with you. I like the way you work."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. A SMALL DREAM DIES</h2>

<p class="first">ANN STUART rode over Star Cross grass to the
near-by southern ridge; and when she reached the trees she looked
back to discover that Trumbo had finished his interview and was
riding west. Therefore she followed the ridge, paralleling Trumbo's
course, and at last reached a junction trail and waited. At the end
of a half hour he had not appeared and so she continued until she
was on the main road directly behind his house. It was then near
noon. Drew came along not long after. She noticed at once that he
had been through some considerable scene and had been left the
worse for it. He neither lifted his hat nor smiled.</p>

<p>"Did you quarrel with my father?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "We got along all right."</p>

<p>"You're in a bad frame of mind."</p>

<p>"I just met Coleman and his crew driving my beef back over the
river."</p>

<p>"Was it that vented beef?" When he nodded, she said: "I'm sorry
you took it. Never mind what rules the Basin laid down&mdash;it
wasn't right."</p>

<p>"I'll have it back," he said.</p>

<p>"You're like my father. You give nothing up and you don't change
easily."</p>

<p>He sat still, not trying to follow her thoughts as he usually
did. The niceness and the consideration were gone and the irony
which leavened his spirit was missing. She had never been too
certain of his character but she had liked him well enough to be
interested in his future. What she now saw was a gambler's
calculating ambition, and this hurt her. "What did my father
want?"</p>

<p>"Help."</p>

<p>"He wants to destroy Coleman and he wants Horsehead. He has
always wanted it. What did he offer you?"</p>

<p>"Your father never gives anything if he can help it. I had to
make the offer&mdash;all of Horsehead west of the river for me. All
of it east of the river for him. He accepted."</p>

<p>"Coleman won't run."</p>

<p>"It will be a fight," he said, "if he can make his crew
fight."</p>

<p>"You have agreed," she said, "to help kill him. That is the
bargain."</p>

<p>He had grown irritated at the way her talk pushed him
unfavorably back.</p>

<p>"Take another look at it," he said, "If Coleman hadn't come here
that ranch would have been split up in another three months without
a fight. But Coleman comes. Look at him carefully a minute. What is
he? Another man fighting to get a piece of land&mdash;just like I
am. Is be any better than I am?"</p>

<p>Her logical mind supplied an immediate answer. "Horsehead still
has an owner. You are not the owner."</p>

<p>"The Basin says different."</p>

<p>She shook her head, "I have watched all of the Basin ranchmen
when they spoke of opening up Horsehead. In the eyes of every one
of them, Drew, was a look that wasn't quite square. They know
they're not on sound ground."</p>

<p>"Square or not," he said, "somebody in the Basin will take over
Horsehead. I want my part of it."</p>

<p>"Horsehead," she repeated, "is an owned ranch."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, he grew frank. "I am the smallest
owner in the Basin. A man like me, with nothing to show for his
years, gets sour. I have got to cut my notch. These big owners came
here when everything was open and they took what they
wanted&mdash;men no better than I am. Your father did it. So will
I."</p>

<p>"Don't grow big on other men's bones. Go where the range is
still open."</p>

<p>"The world is gettin' small. The free grass is just about gone.
I am a little too late to be one of the pirates lookin' out on a
million acres of range. But I was born to be one of those fellows
and I'll be one. Horsehead is my last chance."</p>

<p>"Drew," she said, "I have been waiting to see one man strong
enough not to be changed by the Basin. I had thought you were that
man."</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "nothing changes me. Whatever you see about Drew
Trumbo is something Drew Trumbo always had in him."</p>

<p>She was grave and thoughtful; she shook her head. "I am
disappointed."</p>

<p>He went toward her and put his hands on her shoulders. She
didn't move but as he watched her, closely and with anxiousness, he
saw little doors close against him which once had been half-
opened. He tightened his fingers on her shoulders. "Don't turn
against me!"</p>

<p>She looked down from him, "It is more than disappointment," she
murmured, and when she looked up there were tears in her eyes. He
brought her against him and he tried to kiss her. She pushed
against him and stepped aside.</p>

<p>"Ann," he said, "you want me to be a little fellow carryin' a
hoe?"</p>

<p>"You will be what you are," she said. "A man may try to change
and a woman may think she has changed him, but it is only an
outward thing. He remains the same."</p>

<p>He shook his head, "What do you want in a man?"</p>

<p>She closed it out with a gesture, and changed the subject. "When
will you be doing this?"</p>

<p>She was sorry she had asked the question. His eyes became
different and his character was another character, all in the space
of a moment. This man, she well knew, had loved her and still loved
her; in every meeting it was a feeling that came from him to touch
her. Yet this suddenly, had he the power to pull away and close her
out and look upon her as an enemy to his plans. She stepped back to
her horse and mounted. "So long. Drew."</p>

<p>"I'll see you again," he said. He came up to her and for a
little, while he recaptured his smiling manner. But it was too late
then. She had never really given him her heart; in all their
moments of closeness she had held herself away from that final
step. It wasn't only that she was not quite certain of him; she was
also unsure of herself, sometimes wondering if the lonely search of
some personal answer for herself might not lead her to a false
decision. But he had always known&mdash;for she had let him see
it&mdash;that he was closer to her and more desirable to her than
any other man. The rest might have followed. Instead, he had chosen
to put another desire before her. "I'll see you again," he
repeated, "I'll come to you someday, a man with something to
offer."</p>

<p>"An offer of land and cattle?" she said. "Drew, you're blind.
Good-by."</p>

<p>She rode through the trees, checking the horse to a walk,
meanwhile thinking of Drew Trumbo, from her first meeting with him,
onward to the last one. She recalled his words and the tone of his
voice and the unsaid things in his voice and the times he had
pleasantly lifted her spirit out of its loneliness and, as she
thought of all this, she took Drew Trumbo from her heart little by
little, until at last there was only an empty spot where he had
been.</p>

<p>She rode the hardest mile of her life; and halted and sat still,
knowing there was no living person who now had a claim on her, and
no living person on whom she might have a claim. She was as
thoroughly alone in the world as if there were no other thing alive
on the planet. All her search for color and warmth, for the comfort
of some man's closeness, had ended with this great solitariness.
She had left only her convictions of right and wrong&mdash;and so
turned downslope toward the river's ford.</p>

<p>She came to the Horsehead yard in mid-afternoon, finding
Valencia Wilder on the porch. She had heard of the girl's being
there, and the reason for it. Such news traveled with something
near the speed of light in the Basin; and it had aroused Ann
Stuart's natural curiosity. She wondered about Coleman. Even though
this girl was engaged to be married to Ben Solvay, what would her
closeness to Coleman do to him? For her first meeting with Coleman
had told her at once he was a robust man, something in his voice
and on his face betraying the quick currents which ran within him.
It would be natural for him to seek the beauty and the comfort of a
woman.</p>

<p>Valencia Wilder said: "Will you get down?"</p>

<p>Dismounting, Ann came to the porch. Valencia was a smaller girl
than she, very dark and with a spirit glowing like hot coals in
her. Her smile was a small lightness around her mouth and her eyes
were sharp and alert for trouble. She was far prettier, Ann
thought, than the grapevine rumor had indicated. She wasn't
hard&mdash;Ann looked at once for that&mdash;but she had a self-
sufficiency, and she was on guard.</p>

<p>"I'd like to speak to Tracy Coleman if he's around," said
Ann.</p>

<p>"He's back of the house," Valencia said. She stood a moment,
openly interested. "You're Ann Stuart. You know my name, I imagine,
and my reason for being here."</p>

<p>"We've got a good system of gossip in the Basin," said Ann.</p>

<p>"Unkind. I suppose," said Valencia, her expression slightly
hardening.</p>

<p>"If there was unkindness," said Ann, "men would keep that to
themselves."</p>

<p>"But not women."</p>

<p>"I seldom see other women. This is mostly a man's country."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Valencia, "they make the rules."</p>

<p>"You don't have to follow them."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Valencia.</p>

<p>Doa Gertrude came quickly through the doorway, untying an
apron. She said: "Welcome to our house," and her smooth old face
lighted. "It is long since you have been here before. Things go
well?"</p>

<p>"Things go well, Doa Gertrude. You have not visited us."</p>

<p>Doa Gertrude's face turned regretful, "The men of this ranch
and the men of your ranch&mdash;" she said, and conveyed the rest
of it with a shrug.</p>

<p>"Miss Stuart wants to see Mr. Coleman," said Valencia Wilder.
She looked at Ann and she permitted Ann to see one small,
possessive streak. "I will go tell him."</p>

<p>But Doa Gertrude said: "You would not wish to leave your guest
alone. I will do your errand for you." She moved placidly back
through the house.</p>

<p>"Something out of the old, old past," murmured Ann. "And very
nice."</p>

<p>A rebel note came to Valencia's voice. "To Ben-Tim, I gather,
she was a chattel, to remain with his property when he left."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Ann, "they thought it better to be apart. They
were both growing old and maybe they wanted to have their memories
to live on."</p>

<p>Valencia said: "You make people better than they are."</p>

<p>"Badness and goodness are close together. It is better to think
of the goodness."</p>

<p>"I would worship the memory of no man," said Valencia. "If he
didn't care enough to hold me forever, I'd hate him."</p>

<p>Ann gave Valencia a close inspection and shook her head. "You
are deceiving yourself."</p>

<p>Coleman came up from the rear of the house and turned to the
porch. He had been trying out a tough horse and his face was red
from the pounding and, when he removed his hat, sweat rolled down
from his forehead. He grinned and reached for his tobacco and
divided a look between the women. "You've met?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Valencia.</p>

<p>He had his eyes then on his hands, rolling the cigarette. The
tone of her voice lifted his glance and he watched her a
considerable moment, and it was that long look which Ann wondered
about. He was a man with sharp eyes. What did he see in this dark
strange-willed girl and what were his thoughts of her? She already
knew what Valencia Wilder's thoughts were of Coleman; as soon as he
stepped to the porch Valencia's face showed change.</p>

<p>"I wanted to talk a minute with you," she said to Coleman.</p>

<p>Valencia Wilder moved back into the house, not speaking yet
leaving something of her disturbing self behind.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised," said Coleman. "Your father and I are not
friends." He paused and soberly added: "Nor is Trumbo my
friend."</p>

<p>"I know. That's why I'm here."</p>

<p>"Thanks." he said. "But you must not get into my troubles."</p>

<p>"You got into mine, at Gateway. I'm paying back." She saw
Pairvent standing down the yard near the bunkhouse, tall and rigid
and motionless on the ground, his glance pinned to her. She said:
"Ride out from here a short way," and went to her horse. She waited
while he walked to the rear of the house and rode back. They moved
together out upon the plain, "How far can you trust your crew?"</p>

<p>"Far as I can keep my eyes on them. Except for two men. Solvay
and Miller will do."</p>

<p>"Miller's tough. He killed one of Gunderson's crew last winter
in the hills."</p>

<p>"He'll stick. He sees a good fight comin'."</p>

<p>"What a terrible judgment of a man." Then she thought of
something else and was slightly surprised. "Ben Solvay's good. How
did it happen he came here?"</p>

<p>"Came to warn me last night, about your father's notice. Then he
saw his girl again." He rode the better part of a hundred yards
before adding, "I think he regrets his decision to leave her here,
and now stays to be near her."</p>

<p>"Probably he feels she needs more protection."</p>

<p>"Probably," he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him quickly; he had an odd expression on his face
and in a moment, because of the increasing smile in her eyes, he
turned red. Suddenly she put both hands down to the saddle horn and
laughed in uncontrolled amusement. The wry, embarrassed expression
grew on him and he smiled a little and that made her laugh again,
until she had to hunt up her handkerchief and dry her eyes, "Oh,
Tracy," she said, "the expression on your face was so funny. Have I
hurt your feelings?"</p>

<p>"No," he said.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want to do that. You're a very honest man. She's
quite pretty, too."</p>

<p>"I suppose," he admitted cautiously, "she might be considered
so."</p>

<p>She tried to suppress her laughter but could not. "I suppose,"
she jeered, "you've had no time to notice it. Ah, but you are
transparent. And that is of course why Ben Solvay decided to stay
and defend his interests. Ben is not a fool."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have left her to another man's care," he
admitted.</p>

<p>"Was it," she inquired with a very gentle malice, "entirely
Ben's idea?"</p>

<p>He showed embarrassment again. "Why would she think of it? She
came here to marry him."</p>

<p>"She saw you at Gateway, didn't she?" said Ann, in the same idly
provoking tone.</p>

<p>"What of that?" He eyed her with doubt. She had her glance
thrown forward into the lengthening yellow rays of sunlight; she
was serene, and humor disturbed the corners of her mouth. "Well,"
he admitted, "if she were my girl I'd not be tradin' her
around."</p>

<p>"If she were," said Ann, still looking ahead, no longer amused.
He rode on with her, content to wait out what she had to tell him;
and so they came a good deal later to the ford. She looked back
across the plain and showed surprise. "I didn't realize I had
carried you this far from home."</p>

<p>"The ride," he said, "was pleasant to me."</p>

<p>She gave him a pleased glance, "You have a nice way of putting
things." Then she remembered the reason for her visit. "I do not
agree with my father or Drew Trumbo or the Basin. I think Horsehead
is an owned ranch and I think that vented-stock idea is just as
crooked as open rustling. I have to tell you this, otherwise you
might think it unnatural for me to say the rest of it. My father
and Trumbo intend to raid you. Soon I think."</p>

<p>He sat still on the saddle, looking out upon the river. His
nerves were well-covered, not easily touched by little disturbances
or rumors. She got the renewed impression, as she watched him, of a
man wholly confident of his chores in the surface world but greatly
troubled by other and deeper things. At times he could be quite
homely. He was now, as he turned to those fighting impulses which
seemed his natural life; his face showed its stout bones and his
lips lay in close rolls and everything in him&mdash;his fancies and
his lightness and his easy moods&mdash;were put aside.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, "you had not come to me with this."</p>

<p>"You are under no obligation to the Stuart family."</p>

<p>"Maybe not. This fight will unroll, regardless of you or me.
Still, you came." He looked at her with a straight suddenness. "I
will think of that when I do something which hurts you."</p>

<p>"My father?"</p>

<p>"I see no way of duckin' it." He gave her another direct glance,
"I do not quite understand how it is between you and your
father."</p>

<p>"It would be too long a story to tell."</p>

<p>"And I do not quite understand how it is with you and
Trumbo."</p>

<p>"That," she said slowly, "is a story which is ended. My father
made a deal with him. He accepted it&mdash;and so he will be
against you."</p>

<p>He listened to her and she felt he took in her words and
understood them and that his mind went on and grasped the things
she had not said. Gradually the plain homeliness went from his
face. "There's right and wrong&mdash;and many things half-right and
half-wrong," he observed. "I have quit judgin' people. We are all
in the same wagon, passin' through the same scenery, bound for the
same place. But every man has a different set of eyes, and there's
the beginnin' of right and wrong. That is why I'm here with you,
and why your father will move at me. It does no good to talk about
it. But I hate to think of hurtin' you."</p>

<p>She sat up in the saddle, startled at the change in him and what
the change did to her. He was more than he had been the moment
before; and he had become more to her simply by speaking from
deeper places. He was saying things that might have come straight
from her own private thoughts&mdash;said with a faintly saddened
note, an unsure note.</p>

<p>She said: "I had no intention of riding you so far. But you let
me laugh and I needed to laugh. It's been a long day."</p>

<p>He looked at her with the same directness. His thoughts were so
fully on her that they made a feeling in her, warm and
embracing.</p>

<p>"Long day. I noticed that in your eyes. Nothin' comes the way
you think it should be and the world is blind and dumb to what you
see. Finally you figure it is something that doesn't
exist&mdash;that you're just makin' pictures on water."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"I wish to God I would not be soon hurtin' you."</p>

<p>She turned the horse into the water and crossed it; she didn't
look back, even though she knew he was still watching her. She
climbed the low bluff and, as he struck out at a long run over the
flatlands, she was openly crying for the first time since
childhood. Then the tears quit and she kept her mind on him all the
way home; and suddenly she no longer felt like laughing at the
thought of Valencia Wilder in his house. The tolerance left her and
dislike of the other girl came.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Coleman returned to Horsehead through the long last sunlight,
hearing the gong-strike of the dinner bell; and he sat at the head
of the table, not speaking at all while he struggled with his close
thoughts. Stuart had six men and Trumbo made seven. There might be
another outfit throwing in with Stuart. Against that he had these
six men at the table. Which of them would fight, which of them
could he trust? He thought to himself, "I had better send Alvy on
his way before he gets another chance to betray me." Solvay would
have to pull out with the girl. That left four.</p>

<p>The crew ate and departed and Doa Gertrude silently vanished.
Valencia remained, watching him. He heard Ben Solvay impatiently
tramping back and forward on the porch. He looked at Valencia. "He
wants you."</p>

<p>She said: "He didn't want me four days ago."</p>

<p>"Changed his mind. You can see it on him."</p>

<p>"Maybe I have changed mine," said Valencia. "Can you see that on
me?"</p>

<p>He said: "You've got to pull out tomorrow. We're going to be
paid a visit."</p>

<p>"They would never touch me."</p>

<p>"If some fool starts shootin' there's no way of pushin' a bullet
aside." He got up in the twilight of the room; and she rose and
moved at him. She stood in front of him, looking up, her eyes
turned to the color of slate, and wide-sprung. There was a heavy
expression on her mouth. "What did the girl want of you?"</p>

<p>"She wanted nothing."</p>

<p>"Everybody wants something."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "everybody does. But few of us get what we
want."</p>

<p>"Nothing can stand against that stubborn mind of yours, once you
decide upon a thing. You can have whatever you want." She held
herself before him and she held her arms stiff at her sides,
waiting. She watched the effect of her nearness go through him and
she knew she had unsteadied him, she knew she had broken his will
for that moment.</p>

<p>"Tracy," she said, "after all I have been through. I'm still
good. The best of me has never been given away. I feel it, all of
it, right inside where it has always been. If there had ever been a
man big enough to see it there, it would have gone to him. There
never was such a man. Do you believe that?"</p>

<p>"I've seen it," he said. "It's there." He held his talk,
searching himself for the right word. "When you're not thinkin' of
the world you hate so much, it is like the light in a young girl's
eyes, clear as crystal."</p>

<p>"Tracy," she said, her voice crowded and trembling, "can a man
see that&mdash;and forget the rest? Can he ever?"</p>

<p>"There are men who would," he said.</p>

<p>But, listening with her whole private world waiting on him, she
did not quite hear the one thing she wanted to hear, and at that
point she gave up the good standard she had set for herself. If she
could not have him one way she would try the other. She murmured:
"You kissed me the other night," and she put her arms to his
shoulders, lightly resting them there; and reached up and kissed
him. The reserve in her vanished before the heat of her wish and
she held him with all the strength she had.</p>

<p>He touched her gently, hearing Ben Solvay's boots stamp back
through the house. Valencia stepped away, sighing. Solvay was at
the dining room's doorway. He said in a short, cranky voice: "Ten
minutes is long enough for anybody to eat supper, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ben," said Coleman, "this ranch is to be raided. Take Valencia
out of here tomorrow."</p>

<p>In the gathering darkness of the room he witnessed the relief
come to Ben's round cheeks.</p>

<p>"Tonight," Solvay said. "Right away. I'll find an extra saddle.
Never mind the trunk. I can come back for it."</p>

<p>He took Valencia by the arm, going through the house. Coleman
followed to the porch and found the crew collected under the trees.
Pairvent said: "What's on your mind? What'd the girl tell you?"</p>

<p>"Stuart's comin', with Trumbo. Don't know what other
outfits."</p>

<p>"Tonight?" asked Pairvent in a knife-keen tone.</p>

<p>"Soon. Maybe tonight, maybe not."</p>

<p>Ben Solvay left the porch and cut around to the rear yard.
Pairvent passed a hand across his wedge-shaped face.</p>

<p>"I know Stuart. He never lets a thing wait. God damn you,
Coleman, you have whipsawed us into it. Alvy, get your horse and
ride to the ford. Watch-see if anybody crosses. Don't dream,
boy!"</p>

<p>"No," said Coleman. "Get your horse and keep goin', Alvy. I
don't want you around at all."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Pairvent, "if I'm foreman, don't go over my head.
I'm not goin' to throw a man away. If he tricks us I'll kill him,
but we got to use him."</p>

<p>Alvy murmured: "This is my outfit."</p>

<p>Coleman said: "All right&mdash;all right." Alvy ran back into
the yard, making a scarecrow shape through the shadows. Coleman
called after him, "Get a horse for Doa Gertrude. She'll ride away
with Ben and Miss Wilder."</p>

<p>Pairvent said: "What'll it be. Coleman? We can stand off our own
size but we can't buck too much weight."</p>

<p>"You're stayin', George?"</p>

<p>Pairvent spoke from his long-held anger, from his grinding
resentment.</p>

<p>"I'm stayin'. I nursed this place along three years. I would
have pulled it through. I had my deals made and they were good
enough to keep the Basin from movin' in. You have played
hell&mdash;and it is your chestnuts I have got to help pull out of
the fire. I'll do it. Then we'll see whose ranch this is, yours or
mine."</p>

<p>Ben Solvay returned with three led horses. "Time to go," he
said. Alvy came by at a headlong run, rushing for the open land.
"Time to go," said Ben Solvay again.</p>

<p>Coleman murmured: "Nothing's happened yet. Slow down."</p>

<p>Doa Gertrude moved slowly forward. "What is this foolishness.
Don Tracy? What is this talk of going?"</p>

<p>"There is a reason for you to leave here," said Coleman. "It
will not be for long."</p>

<p>"I will stay," said Doa Gertrude, firm and calm, "This is my
home. Do not command me to do a thing which I cannot obey."</p>

<p>Pairvent said: "What'll it be, Coleman? Make your plan while you
got time to make it."</p>

<p>"Never plan too far, George. A man can't scheme against
ghosts."</p>

<p>Ben said: "Valencia, you'll have to try ridin' side saddle on a
straight horn. Come on&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had not stirred from the porch; and did not now. The night
wind rose and ran through the trees with its blends of dust and
grass and pine. The heat of the day slowly moved against Coleman,
the night silence had its edge of suspense. He had not felt it
before, and now stood quite still, wondering whence it came. The
crew was around him, waiting&mdash;and maybe they made the tension
which lay upon him as a growing weight. Ben started to speak again
but Coleman said: "Shut up." He took one step toward the back yard,
and stopped; and he knew the night was turning wrong while he
delayed. He made a circle on his heels. He stared through the
increased blackness of the trees. Out on the plain he saw nothing
in the shadows, and heard only the drum of Alvy's horse; presently,
as he listened, he heard that come to an abrupt halt. Pairvent also
heard it. He said: "Something's up."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Coleman. The weight pushed against him more and
more and had no direction to it. He murmured: "Valencia&mdash;Doa
Gertrude, get on your horses."</p>

<p>"Tracy," murmured the girl, "I don't want to go!"</p>

<p>"Now!" he said. It grew worse and worse; he took one false step
to the porch, halted, and swung toward the back yard. Suddenly he
broke into a run toward the corral rack. "Come on&mdash;come on.
Ben, get those women out of here." He reached the corral with the
crew tumbling behind him. Pairvent grumbled, "What's
up&mdash;where's&mdash;"</p>

<p>Coleman was in the saddle when the first racket came; and the
source of it told him how it was. Riders came down the hill behind
the house at full tilt, crying; they had circled the grass plain
during daylight to these hills, they had crept down&mdash;and they
were here. He was out in the yard, the other Horsehead men swinging
around him. Pairvent cursed violently and Ray Miller was laughing
out his dead-toned pleasure.</p>

<p>Coleman shouted at the porch: "Get out of here with your women.
Ben!"</p>

<p>Stuart's voice overrode all other voices pouring off the hill.
"Left side of the house! Left side of the house!"</p>

<p>Ray Miller answered for Horsehead; his eager answer jumped back
at Stuart, "You go to hell!" It was Ray Miller also who opened the
firing.</p>

<p>Coleman said: "Drop back to the trees in the front yard." He ran
his horse over there, troubled about the women. They were in the
saddle and Solvay had only then started off.</p>

<p>"Move out!" Coleman yelled, "Move out fast!" His crew had come
up.</p>

<p>Stuart's men boiled into the back yard and the steady, hard-
round claps of gunfire broke into the trees and ran out upon the
flats and echoed on and on through the hillside. He knew then
Stuart had found other help, for suddenly the pressure of Stuart's
outfit got greater in the front yard. The Horsehead men were steady
around him, shifting through the trees as he shifted, answering
Stuart's fire,</p>

<p>"Lay it on," he called.</p>

<p>Bullets clipped the trees near at hand; he heard them sing and
shatter, "Cover the yard," he said. "They've got no shelter." He
saw the black weave of shapes in the yard. He heard one man's cry;
and that cry took the drive out of Stuart's riders. The blackness
of their shapes grew vaguer as they turned behind the house to try
an approach from the other side.</p>

<p>Ben Solvay shouted, near at hand, "Come back here, Doa
Gertrude!"</p>

<p>Doa Gertrude rode past on her horse. Coleman reached at her and
missed her. She stopped the horse at the porch and slid down. She
said in a breathless voice, "This is my home," and in another
moment Stuart's men swept around the far side, firing in sudden
rushes. Doa Gertrude's voice lifted, high and crying: "Ah, ah,
<i>&gt;Dios!</i>"</p>

<p>She had fallen. Over there Stuart's voice turned crazy. "You've
hit a woman! Now&mdash;now&mdash;at those trees!"</p>

<p>Coleman heard Valencia Wilder's voice directly behind him, "I
won't leave!" And it was that one thing which took the fight from
him.</p>

<p>"Pairvent," he said, "Pairvent!"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"Make a run for the hills."</p>

<p>Ray Miller heard that. "What the hell&mdash;we're all
right!"</p>

<p>"Do as I say," ordered Coleman. He wheeled at Valencia. He said,
"Go in front of me." and he ran through the pines with Horsehead
moving beside him. He saw Pairvent swing into the trail and he
heard Stuart's greater yell behind.</p>

<p>"Come on&mdash;they're runnin'!"</p>

<p>Pairvent had vanished up a trail.</p>

<p>Coleman called to Valencia, "Follow Pairvent&mdash;go on, go
on!" His horse dropped to a walk on the grade, but he dug in his
spurs and forced it to a labored run. He heard Stuart once more,
now from a greater distance; and he heard Horsehead's men come
behind him. He called forward to Pairvent: "Keep going until you
get to a good hide-out." Doa Gertrude, he realized, was dead at
the doorway of the house, and Stuart had won his first move.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. DEAD WOMAN'S HAND</h2>

<p class="first">THE SMELL of powder smoke clung to the yard long
after the firing had ceased and long after Horsehead vanished up
the trail. Tap ranged around the front yard and through the front
trees. He circled the house and came again to the group standing
near the porch. He said: "Mr. Stuart, you're doin' wrong, standin'
here. We should be after him."</p>

<p>He could not understand the silence and the weariness which had
come over this group. There were ten of them. Stuart and the Star
Cross men, and Trumbo, and Hoby Spade with two of his hands. After
the last firing they had all stopped in their tracks.</p>

<p>Tap had gone onto the porch, bent over Doa Gertrude and come
back to report her death, "Bullet in the chest." The group around
him had changed at that moment&mdash;the wind punched out of their
bellies. Now he again said: "We should be after the man."</p>

<p>Spade murmured: "We go rammin' through that timber and we'll run
into a beautiful trap. He's probably layin' for us up there." Hoby
Spade's voice gave him away; he was sickened of the business.</p>

<p>Stuart said: "He won't be comin' back." Tap listened to Stuart,
hearing nothing familiar. The Star Cross owner's sureness was
gone.</p>

<p>"Why won't he?" asked Trumbo.</p>

<p>"Nothin' to come back with. That crooked crew will keep right on
travelin'. They see the writin' in the sky. He's alone with his
woman. Tomorrow this time they'll be over the range."</p>

<p>Tap thought to himself: "That is strange." For Stuart was
talking cautious.</p>

<p>Spade said: "I'll pull out. Nothing to stay for now. Good luck.
Drew."</p>

<p>Trumbo had lighted a cigarette. He reached up and pulled it
quickly from his mouth, "Hold on."</p>

<p>"For what?" asked Spade.</p>

<p>Trumbo pointed at the porch. "Doa Gertrude."</p>

<p>The chill, uneasy silence came again. Stuart said at last: "Take
the boys. Tap. Hunt up some shovels. Dig a grave somewhere." He
made a step toward the porch and wheeled back. "It could have been
a bullet from the Horsehead outfit just as well as one of ours. It
may have been."</p>

<p>"I hope so," Spade murmured. "It is a pretty grisly thing to
remember. I don't like it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Stuart, "it is done. Can't make a cake without
breakin' eggs."</p>

<p>"Can't put the wrong eggs back together again either."</p>

<p>"You don't need to keep talkin' about it," said Stuart. He
raised his voice. "Get about it, Tap. Get about it!"</p>

<p>Trumbo said: "The Basin won't like it. We're in a bad
light."</p>

<p>"Why did she have to run straight into us?" grumbled Spade.</p>

<p>"Might have been Horsehead's fire," repeated Stuart.</p>

<p>Spade suddenly thought of a possibility, "Any chance of keeping
this quiet?"</p>

<p>"You think anybody's goin' to mention it?" asked Trumbo.</p>

<p>"No." said Spade. "But she'll he missed sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Let Coleman answer for that," said Trumbo.</p>

<p>"Somebody in his outfit will talk," Spade said.</p>

<p>Stuart broke in. "Who'll believe those fellows?" Then he added
in a different tone: "There's that woman."</p>

<p>Tap called from the trees. "Solvay, too."</p>

<p>A strange sound came out of Stuart, half a groan and half a
sigh. Trumbo dragged in the smoke of his cigarette and threw it to
the ground: and he stood with his head lowered. They remained like
this, all of them hard-caught by the situation they were in. Tap
called, long afterward:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is deep enough. Get Doa Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Go get her. Tap," said Stuart.</p>

<p>Tap, who had never disobeyed Stuart before, didn't move from the
shadows of the pines and he didn't answer. Stuart jerked his head
upward and said with a return of his old arbitrariness: "You
hear?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Stuart," said Tap, "I will not touch her."</p>

<p>Trumbo suddenly swung toward the porch. Doa Gertrude had
reached the house's front door and had fallen there, her small body
blocking it. Lamplight came out of the doorway and touched her. She
lay as a little heap of black clothes, her two hands drawn up
toward her shoulders. Trumbo stepped over her into the house and
went on to a bedroom, finding a blanket. He came back and spread
the blanket on the porch. Nobody else had come forward. He lifted
Doa Gertrude onto the blanket and rolled it about her and he
carried her out to the trees. He stepped into the grave and laid
Doa Gertrude on the bottom and got out. The crew began to shovel
in the dirt; at the sound Trumbo whirled on his heels and went back
to the group. The sound followed him and suddenly he removed his
hat.</p>

<p>"It is a bad break for us," he said.</p>

<p>It didn't need to be said: they knew it. They were thinking
about it and they were trying to slide away from it. He saw it on
Hoby Spade's face; he saw it on Stuart whose eyes, even in the
shadows, showed their hard, sly gleaming. Both of these men would
try, in some way or another, to put the affair on him. Spade said:
"Time to get out of here," and walked away. Trumbo turned and
followed him; when they were alone, beyond hearing distance of the
others, Trumbo caught Spade's arm and whirled him around. He put
his face close to Spade's, "You're not backing out on us. You've
got what you wanted. You made your deal with Stuart. You're
stickin' to it."</p>

<p>Spade said: "This thing will stink up the whole Basin. No use,
Drew. Mistake's been made. I'm through with it now."</p>

<p>"How do you propose to get rid of what's already done?"</p>

<p>"It's done. But I won't make it worse by takin' Stuart's pay for
it."</p>

<p>"You'll do what you set out to do," said Trumbo. He put his
strength into the grip on Spade's arm. He saw Spade's expression
tighten and he knew he had put fear into the man, "You were in this
when it looked easy. You'll stay in it when it is gettin' hard. If
I call for help from you, I want it. If I don't get it, I'll come
after you!"</p>

<p>Spade pulled his arm free and moved away. In a moment he raced
from the yard with his two punchers. The man had less bottom than
Trumbo had thought; and his very weakness might betray them all. He
moved back to Stuart, "Spade," he said, "is trying to slide
out."</p>

<p>Stuart said nothing. Tap came up and all the Star Cross men
stood by. Trumbo rolled a cigarette and lighted it. He held the
match suddenly close to Stuart's face and watched the man. The
light went out.</p>

<p>Stuart said: "Well, time to go."</p>

<p>Trumbo said: "You think it is finished?"</p>

<p>"We drove him off," said Stuart. "It's done."</p>

<p>"You're wrong&mdash;and you'll see why in a few hours. It will
just ride back home with you."</p>

<p>Stuart walked away. Trumbo stood still, watching the Star Cross
men fade to their horses and swing back; they returned through the
yard on the run and in a little while vanished. For a moment the
murmur of their traveling remained in the air and then that died
and the silence began to flow around Trumbo, thick and disturbing.
He had not finished his smoke but he dropped it and walked to the
house. He moved to the lighted lamp in the living room and turned
it down. He put his hands in his pockets and went from room to
room. Fire burned in the kitchen stove and the coffee pot was still
warm. He lifted the pot and drank from it; and stood still,
listening for outer sounds. He left the house by the back door and
put his shoulders against the house wall, facing the slope of the
hills.</p>

<p>Spade was full of fear and Stuart would be steadily scheming to
put the burden of this affair on him, on Trumbo. Stuart, he knew,
had never intended going through with his bargain, and did not
intend to go through with it now. The killing of Doa Gertrude had
set him back; but it would be only an added prompting to work the
deal around to his own advantage if he could.</p>

<p>There was no sound at all on the place; silence pulsed around
him like the pulse of his own heart. He stood still, straining with
attention. His muscles were tight and his jaws bitten together. He
slid along the wall and returned to the front yard. He took his
horse into the front pines and he squatted down there; and he saw
something now that he hadn't seen before. He was alone on this
place, with Coleman moving somewhere free through the hills. He was
trapped on Horsehead, as Coleman had been a little while before.
Coleman had traded positions with him&mdash;and now Coleman had the
advantage of surprise and attack.</p>

<p>Stuart had probably thought that same thing, and had been quick
to pull out from the ranch and leave him alone.</p>

<p>Trumbo struck his fist into the soft soil. He rose, walking
through the trees. Doa Gertrude's grave was a dark patch on the
ground before him; he swerved aside and turned about, at that
moment realizing another thing. If he remained on the ranch he
would he admitting that Doa Gertrude's grave was of his making; if
he stayed to claim ownership of Horsehead he also stayed to claim
the grave. Maybe Stuart had thought of that too.</p>

<p>He went to his horse. One pure stream of cold feeling shot
through him when he came to think of how close he had come to
permitting Stuart to outmaneuver him. He smiled bitterly into the
night.</p>

<p>"The man who is saddled with Doa Gertrude's death is dead in
this Basin. He figures to have the Basin find me here."</p>

<p>He rode out upon the flat, headed for the river ford. They had
driven Coleman from the place; but Coleman had not lost. Coleman
was alive. Until he was dead neither Stuart nor he would be free
men!</p>

<p><br>
<br>
As soon as Stuart crossed the ford he halted to face his crew.</p>

<p>"The whole thing dies right here. Let no man carry it
farther."</p>

<p>Tap answered with a trace of resentment. "Unnecessary to mention
it. Mr. Stuart."</p>

<p>"Never does harm to speak plainly."</p>

<p>"We'll not be speakin', but you got a lot of other tongues to
consider."</p>

<p>"Trumbo," said Stuart, "will say nothing. Nor will Spade. The
information, if it comes, will come from Horsehead and there's no
man on that outfit with a name for honesty."</p>

<p>"Except Ben Solvay," said Tap. "Then, there's the woman."</p>

<p>Stuart sat silent, considering those two; and presently he spoke
in the way of a man who traces his thoughts aloud, very quietly and
with no stress. "The woman does not count. As for Solvay&mdash;he
will have to be killed. He's the only man who would be believed by
the Basin."</p>

<p>"That's tough," said Niles Peck, "Ben's not a bad hand."</p>

<p>"If he speaks," said Stuart, "he speaks against us. I have got a
job for you. Niles. Break off for town. Just drift into the saloon
and say you were crossin' Horsehead Range tonight and heard some
shootin' over that way."</p>

<p>"Which there was," commented Niles Peck. "What else do I
say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. But somebody will ride that way in the morning, out of
curiosity."</p>

<p>"Whut'll they find?" asked Niles.</p>

<p>"Trumbo," said Stuart, "Trumbo and a grave."</p>

<p>The crew pondered this a moment. Then Tap said:</p>

<p>"That's all right. That will put the load on Trumbo. Go ahead,
Niles. Get a drink or two under your belt before you talk."</p>

<p>"Won't be hard," said Niles Peck and sloped away into the night.
Stuart took his outfit on, Tap riding abreast him. Starlight showed
thin and bright against night's moonless black; and in the wind was
the first thin bitter-sweet odor of fall. Ahead of them, the low
hills lay in round shapelessness and beyond that stood the great
ragged bulk of the main mountains. Tap fell into a spell of
coughing, the dust and the weed pollen touching off an asthma which
had cursed him all his days; and the sound of his lungs was like
the pumping of an old dry-leather bellows. He calmed himself, and
said: "I wondered why you took to Trumbo so sudden. It did not seem
natural. I see why now." Then he later added in a puzzled way: "But
how'd you know there'd be the curse of a thing like Doa Gertrude
to put on the man?"</p>

<p>Stuart made no answer.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Niles Peck made it to town in an hour. There was half a crowd in
the saloon, the busy time of roundup now over and men drifting in
to soak up the dryness of summer's abstinence. Gunderson sat at a
poker table with Frank DeLeon and Bill Yell, the three of them
buried deep in a game that would not end for a week. They would
play until they were hungry, and eat; and play again until they
were half-asleep and then would sleep and play again. Doc Fallon
stood by, idly watching; the out-driver of the Gateway stage came
in for a drink and a try at the lunch counter.</p>

<p>Niles Peck wigwagged for a drink, took it straight and poured a
second; he worried the second drink around the bar with the point
of his finger. Buck Gadsby, the saloon's night-man, had a moment to
gossip and stood by. He said: "Where's the rest of your bunch?"</p>

<p>"Driving some stuff down from the high country," said Niles
Peck.</p>

<p>"You bein' the gentleman of leisure?"</p>

<p>"No. I just came off the west side. Was up at that old Cliff
cabin." Niles Peck swallowed his second drink, closed both eyes
briefly the better to withstand the wallop, and laid down payment
therefor. "I wouldn't mind knowin' what the hell the shootin' was
about."</p>

<p>"Where?" said Gadsby on the alert.</p>

<p>"At Horsehead, sounded like. I heard it away out on the flat.
One long bust, like three-four guns, maybe. I kept going some,
faster." He turned from the saloon, got on his horse and rode from
town. He thought: "I did it smooth. Lyin' might come easy to me.
Hell of a ride for two drinks, though." A mile onward he had a
disgusted second thought: "Why didn't I buy a pint to drink on the
way? Better all drunk than just comfortable."</p>

<p>Gadsby washed the used glass, put the bottle behind the bar and
dropped the two-bit piece into the till. He made a swipe at the
small wet ring on the counter with his towel and came about the
bar. He leaned over the cattle owner's table, speaking gently to
Yell and Gunderson and DeLeon. "Niles Peck just said he was ridin'
on the flat near Horsehead quarters hour and a half ago and heard a
jag of shootin'."</p>

<p>He went back to the bar and resumed his chores. The three
cattlemen kept on with their play. Doc Fallon had heard the
barkeep's talk, thought about it and stepped to the bar.</p>

<p>"Did Niles say he was riding with anybody?" he asked Gadsby.</p>

<p>"Said he was alone."</p>

<p>Fallon turned and made an idle circle of the room, looking on at
other poker tables, saying a word now and then to one man or
another; and moved back to the cattlemen's table. He bent over.</p>

<p>"That is a very funny thing. Niles said he was riding across
Horsehead alone. Now I will say something. I stood on the bluff of
the river, near the ford, about that time, and I watched a bunch
come over from the west side. I didn't call out or come up, since
it was a night ride and none of my business." He looked at the
three. "I think I know what outfit it was. If I am right, Niles was
not riding alone." Having said it, he left the saloon.</p>

<p>Frank DeLeon said: "We'll break up this game a little before
daylight. I want to go over there."</p>

<p>"Go with you," said Gunderson. Yell nodded.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
On that night there was one other person traveling the prairie at
the time Dan Stuart brought his crew over the ford. Ann, riding
under the blackly cushioned stars, had followed the net of trails
which wound in and through the low hills separating Star Cross from
Horsehead. A lonely girl, with a lonely girl's vivid imagination,
she had coursed this whole country since childhood, so that she
knew every night shadow and night sound. Brought blind-folded to
any piece of the Basin, she would have been able to orient herself
within ten minutes by some familiar shape or scar of the land.</p>

<p>This night she rode to consider her last remaining duty to her
father and had her painful tragic moments when she realized there
could be no compromise between her father and Coleman. Her father's
nature would never change. His need of power drove him and would
always drive him. The clash would come and nothing could save it
except Coleman's withdrawal, but as she remembered the bits of
character Coleman had unconsciously revealed to her, she doubted if
he would give ground. One lone silver thread of loyalty still held
her to her father, after all his brutalities; yet he was
wrong&mdash;and that conflict was a storm inside her.</p>

<p>She circled out of the hills near Trumbo's range and followed
the river northward. Half a mile from the ford she saw a group
suddenly come into view against the bluff, having crossed over from
the west side. The group paused a moment, apparently to talk, and
later a man split away while the rest moved straight east. That
would be her father and the crew returning from the trip on which
they had so abruptly started a little before sundown that day.</p>

<p>She rode diagonally across the flat, and tarried a little in the
Star Cross hills, and arrived home a half hour after them. Her
father was on the porch with his cigar.</p>

<p>Usually he had a surly question for her. Usually he said: "Where
the hell have you been spookin' this time of night?" Now he only
sat still, a taciturn, granite-willed man, wrapped in his own
affairs. She stood near him, gradually becoming aware that
something out of the way had happened. After so many years with
him, she knew the quality of his temper by little signs on him. But
he had nothing to offer her and she turned to her room. She lay
long awake, feeling fear, and as it ran through her. She thought of
Coleman and she visualized him and then she knew the reason for her
fear.</p>

<p>At sunup she watched her father stroll around the yard,
obviously restless, obviously troubled; around eleven he climbed to
his saddle and headed for town, the sun slanting around his stout,
truculent figure. Tap sat in the yard, working over a broken
bridle. She walked out to him.</p>

<p>"What's up. Tap? What went on last night?"</p>

<p>"I would not know."</p>

<p>"Say it the way you mean it. Tap."</p>

<p>"Then," he said, shortly polite, "the truth is I would say
nothing."</p>

<p>He went on with his work. This little man was a deadly bomb of
blind zeal for Star Cross; her father had but to light the fuse and
Tap would throw himself unhesitatingly into the destruction of
whatever her father wished. In a way Tap was terrifyingly simple;
in a way terribly malign. She idled through the yard, watching the
other men of the crew, noting that none of them were anxious to
meet her&mdash;that they moved off before she came close to
them.</p>

<p>Returning to the porch, she waited for her father, but as noon
grew nearer she continued to think of Coleman; and at last she
saddled her horse and started over the flat. For a short distance
she thought of going to Trumbo. Within a half mile she gave over
that idea, realizing she would meet only the same evasive silence.
If there were news it would be in War Bonnet; so she turned
townward.</p>

<p>Dan Stuart reached War Bonnet near noon and put up in front of
the Alma Hotel. He walked back to the saloon, knowing it was likely
some of the owners would be there&mdash;and as soon as he stepped
into the saloon he saw Frank DeLeon at the bar drinking an odd
mixture of beer and bitters which he had invented many years before
to doctor a fancied stomach trouble. He joined DeLeon, and his
pride unbent to permit him to speak first to a man, a thing he
seldom did. He said, "Mornin'. Frank," and waggled a finger for his
bottle of Scotch.</p>

<p>DeLeon soberly added bitters to his beer, murmuring, "I notice I
use more bitters and less beer. Man's taste changes as he gets
older. For that matter, a man changes otherwise, too." He finished
his drink and turned to meet Dan Stuart's glance with a chilled
expression, and left the saloon.</p>

<p>Stuart remained quite still. He was not entirely sure DeLeon had
meant to cut him, for the man sometimes had long spells of reserve;
yet the glance had been straight and seemingly deliberate. He stood
with his head dropped, the debating continuing in his mind. He
weighed DeLeon's manner until he grew confused and suddenly hit the
bar with his closed fist and walked out. He went on to the Alma
Hotel and crossed the lobby to the dining room. Three men were
there&mdash;a rider from Medary's outfit, a tobacco drummer, and
Fay Taggart who ran the livery.</p>

<p>He sat down, ridden by a growing obsession. Nobody had spoken of
Drew Trumbo being on Horsehead; and he knew the Basin well enough
to guess that somebody had already gone out to investigate
Horsehead on Niles Peck's rumor. He ordered his dinner and when it
came he ate in a heavy, disinterested way&mdash;an autocratic man
who never offered friendliness or interest to anyone. He had no way
of speaking casually to people, thereby discovering what he most
wanted to know. So he sat glum and formidable in the warm dining
room. He heard riders trot up the street and later he made out the
voices of Gunderson and Bill Yell as they came into the dining
room. He didn't look up. These were men he had neighbored with for
many years and if nothing had changed during the last few hours
they would simply turn at his table and sit down, out of habit.</p>

<p>When they got abreast his table he saw them from the corner of
his eye and knew they were not going to stop. He looked up at them
and he caught Gunderson's glance. He said, "Mornin', Sam. Mornin',
Bill."</p>

<p>Yell nodded. Gunderson broke his stride and paused momentarily.
He seemed about to say something&mdash;and never said it. Nodding,
he went on with Yell to a farther table. The waitress laid a pie
before Stuart; he cut out a piece and ferried it to his plate. He
ate it and laid half a dollar on the table and left his seat at
once. In the lobby he checked himself to light a cigar. The ends of
his fingers shook and he thought somebody watched him from a back
corner, but he didn't turn to see. As he walked to the street he
knew something had gone wrong.</p>

<p>His daughter had arrived and was at the moment entering the
house of Mary van Hogh, the little seamstress. He watched people
move idly along the walks, and his curiosity burned harder and
harder. He looked at each person he saw with the sharpest possible
glance, trying to read them but reading nothing. He noticed Jack
O'Boyle step out of his saddle shop and for an instant he had a
quick hope. He had always been friendly with O'Boyle and the
Irishman liked him. He would go across the street and pass the time
of the day with the man, but O'Boyle gave him a look and moved at
once into the livery stable.</p>

<p>His dull suspicion could no longer be held back. Trumbo had
outguessed him and had escaped the trap on Horsehead; somehow it
had become known that Star Cross had raided Horsehead&mdash;and
that Doa Gertrude was dead. He stood alone in town and he felt the
eyes of the town upon him. He thought: "It is in my mind, nowhere
else," and moved toward his horse. Oldness came upon him and his
first lift did not take him into the saddle; and then his brutal
anger flared up and he took a huge swing, landed on the leather and
started from town.</p>

<p>His daughter came from the seamstress's shop and called to him.
He went on, giving her no attention, but she followed and caught up
with him. He looked at her and discovered the same weight in her
eyes he had seen elsewhere this morning and all his repressed anger
and fear rose up and punished her. "You're big enough to ride home
alone! Get the hell away from me!"</p>

<p>She rode a full three hundred yards before answering him; and at
that point pulled her horse half-around, "That's what I am about to
do," she said. "Stop a moment."</p>

<p>He reined in, growling: "Don't need to make a ceremony of ridin'
away."</p>

<p>"I'm never riding back to Star Cross. There is only one thing on
it I want, Mother's picture. I wish you'd leave it at Mary van
Hogh's, someday."</p>

<p>He said: "I put up with the fool dreams of your mother a long
time. I don't want to see them in you. Let me alone."</p>

<p>"Better listen. I'm saying good-by to you."</p>

<p>He looked at her with his redly formidable eyes. The desire to
strike her was on his face; his temper had punished him all morning
and now he was dangerous, cruelty making its wild thresh through
him. He looked around him quickly, at the open prairie, at the town
four hundred yards behind them. He looked back at her. "Leave and
be damned! What man you going to? Tell me his name and I'll kill
him for what he's probably done. Is it Trumbo?" He fired this at
her quickly, indecently; and then his mind swung back and he added
in a changed voice: "Why?"</p>

<p>"You know, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing."</p>

<p>"You raided Horsehead last night&mdash;and Doa Gertrude's dead.
Where's Coleman?"</p>

<p>He said with a sly swiftness: "Who told you all that?"</p>

<p>"Almost anybody in town could tell you."</p>

<p>He turned his eyes from her, staring into the western sunlight.
She saw the age on him, the breakage beginning to show on his red
face; she saw the cruel, small down-slanting lines at the corners
of his mouth. She searched him for some soft quality, for some kind
memory to carry away, and failed. Still looking away from her, he
said: "If you leave me now you'll be lending truth to a lie."</p>

<p>"Is it a lie?"</p>

<p>He said with his old impatience: "I never explain anything to
anybody!"</p>

<p>"Someday you'll want one thing I have tried to give you. When
you want it you'll want it worse than water or food or all the land
you ever dreamed of. It will be the last thing you'll ever
want&mdash;and you'll call for it, just as you call your dogs to
you. But it won't come."</p>

<p>"What would I be wanting from you?" he challenged her.</p>

<p>"My love," she said. "But it won't come. You did a good job of
killing it."</p>

<p>"I told you once," he said, "that anything that lifts a hand
against me is something I never want around. You leave now and you
never come back."</p>

<p>"That's the way it will be. And I will be against you."</p>

<p>"Against me?" he cried out. "By God&mdash;" He would have hit
her then if she had been within reach of his big arm. He brought
his horse nearer and she saw temper slash through him and turn him
crazy. "I'll watch you and I'll watch the man you go to&mdash;and I
swear I'll kill the man!"</p>

<p>She had never lifted her voice out of its repressed calm. "Can't
you let me think of you in any nice way at all? Do you have to send
me away with so much hate and venom?" She wheeled her horse,
walking it back toward town.</p>

<p>He watched her go, a long fierce flare in his eyes, the old and
massive intolerance dominating him. When she had traveled a hundred
feet he called out, "Wait up," and rode to her, "I'd never ask you
to come back in a thousand years. I beg nothing of any human
being&mdash;never did, never will. The door's open until midnight,
on Star Cross. After that it won't ever be open to you."</p>

<p>"You can close it and lock it now."</p>

<p>"I never knew the queer things that went through a woman," he
said, half to himself, "All right. I'll send you a hundred dollars.
Don't want Dan Stuart's daughter to be beggin'."</p>

<p>"I'm staying with Mary van Hogh. Send me nothing but Mother's
picture."</p>

<p>"That," he said, with a fresh revival of temper, "I will smash
into a thousand pieces tonight!"</p>

<p>She didn't answer him but he knew he had hurt her and he was
pleased for it. She started on. He watched her in his gray,
incomprehending way; and then he called one more thing after
her&mdash;and this rose out of a place beyond his close guard,
escaping from a source of which he had no knowledge at all, and
when he spoke it he knew not why he had done so.</p>

<p>"You're my daughter, ain't you?"</p>

<p>She had her face away from him and he therefore had no way of
seeing the tears running down her cheeks. He watched her until she
had entered War Bonnet's main street; after that he set out
homeward. She was in his mind a full half the distance and his
thoughts were unclear about her, turning from odd questions to
destructive impulses, and back again to a baffled wonder. Long
later it occurred to him to remember why she had left him.
Everybody now knew that Doa Gertrude was dead. The blame was on
him and would remain here.</p>

<p>"That," he said, "will never be proved until the Horsehead
outfit comes out of the hills. They'll never come out. I will have
to go after that bunch."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch" id="ch"></a>10. IN THE HILLS</h2>

<p class="first">TWO OR three miles up the black hill trail Coleman
called ahead: "Move off the trail and wait for me," and rode
downgrade. There was below him the grunt and the pound of a horse
coming along, and the occasional rattle of a branch. Coleman
listened carefully until he was sure it was only a single rider;
and lifted his gun. He stayed in the trail and he watched the black
shape of horse and rider move into vague view below him.</p>

<p>The rider's horse felt or saw the obstruction in the trail
before the rider, and dropped to an uncertain walk. The rider's
voice began to swear softly, "Go on&mdash;go on." When he heard
that voice Coleman lowered his gun.</p>

<p>"Hold up. Alvy."</p>

<p>Alvy's breath made a steamy in-and-out report. "Coleman?"</p>

<p>"What's behind you. Alvy?"</p>

<p>"Nothin' I know of. I heard the shootin' and I came back. I got
on the edge of the trees and I heard Stuart talkin'. I figured
you'd be on this trail."</p>

<p>He had never been sure of Alvy and was not now. "What made you
think we'd come this way?"</p>

<p>"If you'd crossed the flats I'd heard you. This is the only
other way. Somebody in the yard was talkin' about Doa Gertrude.
They said she was dead."</p>

<p>"Stay here a minute. Alvy."</p>

<p>Coleman went by Alvy, dropping down-trail another hundred yards.
A wind ruffled the treetops and in that wind drifted the keen smell
of winter, distant yet true. There was nothing else. So far Stuart
was not following. He turned and rejoined Alvy; the two moved
forward at a walk. "You recognize anybody else in that bunch?"
asked Coleman.</p>

<p>"Trumbo was there. All of Stuart's outfit, I'd guess. I heard
Stuart sing out Tap's name. I heard Trumbo call to Spade."</p>

<p>"How much of a crew has Spade got?"</p>

<p>"Two-three."</p>

<p>There had been ten or eleven against him. Except for Valencia
Wilder's presence he might have stood off the attack with his crew.
The girl had made it impossible to carry on a fight. He plugged
methodically up the hill until he thought he had gone a sufficient
distance, and sent a careful call outward: "Pairvent."</p>

<p>Pairvent's "All right!" came from the near-by black.</p>

<p>"Find a good place to hole up for the night."</p>

<p>The main party came into the trail and moved upward again.
Coleman said, "Go ahead of me. Alvy," and took the rear position
after Alvy passed. He dropped back, occasionally stopping to listen
into the night, puzzled by the lack of pursuit. He had been driven
off Horsehead, but until Stuart and Trumbo had destroyed him they
could not say the job was completed. They were smart enough to know
that. Perhaps, then, it was fear of hurting the girl which held
them back. He considered this as he rode along the winding, rising
trail. There was no moon and the timber around him held a kind of
blackness that absorbed everything; nothing broke that blackness
except overhead, where the trees bordering the trail struck against
the starlit sky.</p>

<p>Maybe fear of hurting Valencia had kept them from following; but
it would not long restrain them. For they had the death of Doa
Gertrude on their hands, which was a fact which would never let
them alone. A lot of things would come out of her death. It would
change every man who had charged across that yard; it would make a
difference to each one of them. Tonight or tomorrow or next week
Stuart and Trumbo would start after Horsehead again. They would
have to do it to justify the killing of a woman; they would have to
go through with what they had planned. If they stopped short of it
Doa Gertrude's ghost would rise upon them. Their act was
incompleted. They would now have to complete it if it killed them
all.</p>

<p>An hour or so onward Pairvent's voice drifted to him: "We turn
off here," and the single-file column left the road, passed between
high rock shoulders and came upon some kind of a mountain meadow.
Water ran quick and shallow near by; the trees seemed shorter
around him and a colder wind moved up. Directly ahead seemed to be
the face of a canyon. The party had stopped and Pairvent was beside
him.</p>

<p>"This will do," Pairvent said.</p>

<p>Coleman stepped to the ground.</p>

<p>"Put a guard back on the trail. George. We'll take turns at it."
He unsaddled and let his horse stand. He said, "Valencia," and
heard her small, tired voice answer. She was still mounted. He
lifted his arms and she came heavily against him as she stepped
down. Her face brushed his head and she whispered a single, soft
word he didn't catch. He led her back to his blanket. "There's your
bed," he told her; and returned to her horse. He got the blanket
from her horse and took it to her. He crouched down near her. "I'll
find a way of getting you out of this tomorrow. Ben will know how
to circle back to War Bonnet."</p>

<p>Her fingers closed about his arm. "Doa Gertrude's dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I liked her. She was kind in her judgments. It would be nice to
grow old with so little meanness." Her tone quickened, "You're not
running from them?"</p>

<p>"I do not know yet."</p>

<p>"Don't run," she said. "You were never made to give up. Remember
what I told you&mdash;you can have anything your stubborn mind
wants." The pressure of her hand held on; and her voice was a quiet
whisper for him. Somebody moved slowly forward and stood still. A
match broke the intense black and Coleman saw Ben Solvay's face
outlined by the sudden glow.</p>

<p>Solvay let the light burn to its last guttering bit of flame
while he looked down at Valencia and at Coleman. He had a stony,
unhappy expression on his face. After the light died he spoke in a
gruff way: "Better get to sleep, Valencia."</p>

<p>Valencia drew her hand away from Coleman; he heard her faint
whisper: "Stay near."</p>

<p>He settled back, hearing the horses stir and hunt for grass.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Early morning's fog was a cold steam rolling through the canyon,
and the chill wetness of it collected in Coleman's bones. He rose
and put on his hat and he rolled a cigarette and had a quick smoke,
noting how peacefully Valencia slept; he had heard her turning
restlessly during the small hours.</p>

<p>Northward stood a ragged chunk of rocks, through which they had
apparently come the night before. South lay the up-and-down canyon
wall, something like two hundred feet high, and at its base ran a
creek which at this point was a slow-moving pool. Watching it, and
the mists which were beginning to rise from it, he saw a trout
jump. Farther on, to the east, was a widening of the canyon into a
kind of meadow. The timber made a solid mass northward.</p>

<p>"Alvy," he said, "take the horses over to that grass."</p>

<p>He walked to the creek, washed and took a deep drink to fill the
emptiness in him. He was hungry in the sharp and painful way of an
active man who sees no hope of food; he stood in the lightening fog
and felt hunger's transient irritability. Pairvent came up, the
rest of the crew straggling behind. Ben Solway remained with the
girl.</p>

<p>Pairvent said: "You still givin' orders for Horsehead?"</p>

<p>Coleman watched the yonder scene between Solvay and the girl
with interest. Solvay was stiff and displeased and appeared to be
saying unpleasant things to her&mdash;the long-brooded things of a
jealous man's mind. Coleman's eyelids drew together, temper ruffled
through him. The girl appeared to be answering with softness. She
smiled at Solvay, but he turned on his heel and moved toward the
group. When he arrived he gave Coleman a crusty stare.</p>

<p>"Or," said Pairvent, "are you goin' over the hill and leave this
mess the way you made it?"</p>

<p>"Why should I run?"</p>

<p>Pairvent's dry sarcasm grew more pronounced, "I'm askin' that
question&mdash;not answerin' it. But you got every earmark of a man
on the run. Last night we could have taken a chance of standin'
those fellows off. It might have worked. Long chance, but I
gathered that was the kind you liked."</p>

<p>"We had the girl with us."</p>

<p>"Damn the woman," said Pairvent. "Send her away."</p>

<p>"George," said Coleman, "that's enough of that."</p>

<p>"All right," said Pairvent, "what're you thinkin' to do? We
can't stay here forever."</p>

<p>"Where are we now?"</p>

<p>"Five miles from the ranch. The big canyon of Cloud River is a
couple miles east. You're two hours' ride from the summit of the
range. Ten from there downgrade to Gateway."</p>

<p>Coleman pointed west. "What's that way?"</p>

<p>"No use thinkin' of it. Too rough to get through." Pairvent
pointed at the canyon wall. "Just a lot of that."</p>

<p>"Can we cross the big canyon?"</p>

<p>"A trail goes down to an old mining shaft near the river. It
will do you no good. No way of crossing."</p>

<p>"Baldy," said Coleman, "ride back through those rocks and keep
an eye peeled. We'll stay here until something else seems in the
cards."</p>

<p>Pairvent grunted, drawing Ray Miller and Ed Drum after him as he
moved off. Coleman watched them huddle up near the trees and talk
it over. Alvy joined them.</p>

<p>Solvay said: "Want me to pull out now?"</p>

<p>Coleman looked carefully at Ben Solvay. Something stuck in the
man's craw and would not budge. He said, himself on edge: "Spit it
out. Ben."</p>

<p>"Maybe," suggested Ben, "I shouldn't have left her on
Horsehead."</p>

<p>"You were a fool to leave her on Horsehead," Coleman bluntly
told him.</p>

<p>"I took you for an honest man."</p>

<p>Coleman gave Solvay a gray, grim smile. The crankiness of hunger
clung to him and influenced the way he talked, "You gave her away
when you brought her to me. You're such a damned pure character
that you didn't want her. Now you've decided you do."</p>

<p>Solvay grew red and disturbed and angry, "Never mind me," he
said. "But I expected you to leave her alone."</p>

<p>"What do you think I've done?"</p>

<p>Solvay wanted to speak out but the thing in his mind needed
decent covering before he could show it, and so he searched himself
for words. The conversation went on between Pairvent and the rest
of the crew, over at the trees. They were in deep
debate&mdash;Pairvent doing most of the talking. The girl walked
idly through the rocky area. She had been watching Solvay and she
had at once known, Coleman guessed, that she was being
discussed.</p>

<p>Solvay said: "When you and I stand together in front of her, she
looks at you, not at me. If the things I'm thinkin' are
right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ben," said Coleman, "I'll draw a picture of you, and it is
nothin' you should be proud of. This girl came to Gateway and you
took a look at her and saw she was better than you had a right to
expect. That made you suspicious. You drew four aces, so you
figured the deal was crooked somewhere. You've been disbelievin'
your luck ever since. You brought her to Horsehead on the high and
mighty statement that she needed to be safe for a week. You didn't
mean it. What you meant was that you had changed your mind about
wantin' her. You went away and figured maybe you were through with
her. You found you couldn't ride far enough to quit thinkin' about
her. Now you're back, wanting to take up a bargain you threw over.
You cashed in your chips but you're standin' at the table tryin' to
run the game. What the hell are you so proud of, my friend?"</p>

<p>Solvay's practical face showed injury and embarrassment. He
seemed to restrain himself, he seemed to make himself listen; and
then he dropped his head and considered it all&mdash;and lifted his
glance, "In all that you are right. I want her back."</p>

<p>"Better let her alone, or quit askin' yourself questions."
Coleman looked long at this steady, unimaginative man, seeing in
him many fine things; but seeing in him too that puritanical strain
which would hound him and hound the girl. He said as a last rough
blow: "She's better than you are."</p>

<p>He watched Solvay tramp away; he crouched by the creek with his
back to the Horsehead men. Their voices kept murmuring and
Pairvent's voice occasionally got sharp. Sunlight broke into the
canyon; he turned his glance to the rim and watched it a long
while. Pairvent would stick until Pairvent saw a better scheme.
Miller would stick because there was a fight coming. Of Ed Drum and
Baldy he could form no conclusions. Alvy was a question mark. These
were men he had to depend upon.</p>

<p>He called, "Alvy," without turning his head, and heard the lad's
boots crunch along the gravel. Alvy circled and stood near the
water's edge before him, tipping his callow, characterless face
downward, "Alvy," said Coleman, "I want to give you a chore. This
is important."</p>

<p>He had judged the depth of the boy's rank pride; he saw the way
it swept across Alvy's face. Alvy said in a throaty tone: "I'll do
it."</p>

<p>"Slide down the hill and get where you can watch the ranch.
Watch it a long time. I want to know who's there. Middle of the
morning now. Be back by the middle of the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said Alvy.</p>

<p>"Alvy," said Coleman, "there's only one important thing about a
man. Good man or bad one. When he gives his word, he'll stand on
his word if it kills him." He didn't look at Alvy but he knew his
talk had effect, for Alvy's voice was guttural with importance.
"I'll do it," Alvy repeated and went away.</p>

<p>Coleman watched Alvy trot to his horse and leave the canyon. The
strike of his horse's shoes came back for a little while as clean,
tapping runs of sound. Coleman rose, meeting Pairvent and the rest
of the crew as they came up. "Sent Alvy down to scout the place,"
he said.</p>

<p>"A pail with no bottom to fetch water with," said Pairvent,
"He's been afraid all mornin'. It was a grease creepin' out on his
face. He'll run."</p>

<p>"Maybe he'll grow up."</p>

<p>"He'll run&mdash;or he'll get into trouble and die. There is no
sense in him."</p>

<p>"Grow or die," said Coleman, "It is time he did one thing or the
other."</p>

<p>He crossed to where the girl stood with Ben Solvay. Something
had passed between them. Solvay stood irresolute and troubled
before her, a flush on his cheeks. The girl had not changed. This
scene was within her grasp. She held it with her self-possession.
She had bettered Ben and had left him helpless. She spoke to
Coleman, "If Ben takes me out of here, you will have one less man.
You can't spare a man."</p>

<p>"It is not his war," said Coleman. "I want you to go. Now!"</p>

<p>An expression of helplessness replaced her certainty. Ben, a man
made wise by jealousy, saw this and abruptly turned away. Coleman
called after him. "Bring up her horse."</p>

<p>Valencia took his arm and murmured: "Don't send me away."</p>

<p>"Don't want you hurt," he said, "You go down to Gateway."</p>

<p>"I'll never see you again." She looked away from him, seeing
visions, not in this meadow, and not in this day. "A man failed me
once. Nothing else has mattered much since then, until now. Now
I've failed a man. I wish it didn't hurt so much." She paused, and
added: "Should I take Ben?" and searched his face line by line with
her anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, and once more a strange irritation
churned through him. "You're better than he is."</p>

<p>Ben moved forward with his horse and hers. Her hand held
Coleman's arm and her glance went up to him and for a moment she
lifted the last reserve from her eyes so that he looked into her
and saw the pure-white fire burning. To his tongue came many
aroused things he wanted to say, but he only murmured, "So
long."</p>

<p>Solvay gave her a hand to the saddle and got to his own horse.
Coleman reached for his cigarette sack. He had it in his fingers
and he held it still. They were at the bend, traveling around it.
She had swung in her saddle to watch and when he lifted his arm to
her she touched a hand to her lips. Coleman removed his hat until
she was gone.</p>

<p>Pairvent was behind him. Pairvent said in a grudging way, "I
liked that woman. Now you have lost another man. What you waitin'
for?"</p>

<p>"For Stuart," said Coleman.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
At noon Solvay and Valencia reached the top of the range and
traveled through a pass, which led downgrade to Gateway. Far south
the great yellow-grass plain ran on and on. After the rough
coldness of the mountains that plain was warmth to the eyes.
Valencia stopped to watch it.</p>

<p>Solvay said: "Long ride yet. Ten miles. Better keep going. You
can put up at Gateway until this is over."</p>

<p>"Maybe," she said, and again his jealous-born wisdom told him
that she was thinking of Coleman entirely.</p>

<p>"Valencia," he said, "I want to keep the bargain."</p>

<p>"You have changed your mind again?"</p>

<p>"Never was changed. The week's delay was only to let you be
sure."</p>

<p>"You're an honest man making a poor job of a lie. You have been
troubled by my past. If I married you I'd have to watch that
suspicion in your eyes the rest of my life."</p>

<p>"I've thought of that," he said, "When you came here I had
figured a sort of partnership with you, leavin' out the word love.
When I saw you I knew that wouldn't do. I had to have you the way a
man wants a woman&mdash;all of her. That changed things. A man in
love with a woman can't forget anything about her. I will admit I
am jealous. I can't help it. But I want you."</p>

<p>"You'd never have all of me, Ben. You'd never have more than you
first bargained for."</p>

<p>He looked at her in a way he had not permitted himself before,
burning and hungry and possessive, and was ashamed to stand so
naked before her. It had never been his intention to give this girl
his heart, but only to take a wife out of necessity. She had
changed that for him and the change was something he could not
control. She grew into him, even though he resisted her, and so at
last he stood before her, defeated and wanting her and hating her
past.</p>

<p>"I could kill the man!"</p>

<p>"Ben," she said, "I want him, but I'll never have him."</p>

<p>He looked down, raked and tortured, and he groaned: "Why didn't
you keep that to yourself? Why did you have to make it worse?"</p>

<p>"I have to tell the truth." She shook her head, sadly speaking.
"If I could lie, I would have been much happier."</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes and she saw the wreckage in him. "I still
want you," he said.</p>

<p>"Why, Ben," she murmured, "I'm sorry I've hurt you."</p>

<p>"Let's get on."</p>

<p>They rode on a considerable distance through the timber, saying
nothing. She was thoughtful, frequently looking behind her, and
finally said: "You can't go back to War Bonnet. The people who are
after Coleman will be after you&mdash;because you helped Coleman.
You'll never be able to live in the Basin until Coleman wins. Go
back and help him."</p>

<p>"Help him?" said Ben Solvay and showed his instant dislike.</p>

<p>"You don't know him. If you called on him for help, even if he
hated you, he'd come. He'd stay with you until the very last, and
ride away and ask nothing of you. There are not so many like
that."</p>

<p>He stopped, "Maybe I'm never going to forget about the past. Man
can't guarantee what's in his head. But I guess I have got to prove
I want you. I will do a thing I do not want to do. I do it only
because you want me to. Go straight down this trail until you reach
Gateway. Stay until I come."</p>

<p>She was about to add, "Tell Tracy I sent you," but she denied
herself the privilege. She crowded her horse near Ben and she bent
and lightly kissed him. She drew away, smiling. "So long," she said
and went down the trail. When she looked back he had disappeared
around a bend; and she stopped, no longer smiling. She was thinking
of Coleman when she said to herself: "I wish he knew I sent Ben
back. I wish he knew I had good enough in me to give up what I came
here for."</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. TIME RUNS OUT</h2>

<p class="first">ALVY RODE out of the meadow into the hill trail,
passing Baldy and hearing Baldy's warning: "Keep out of sight,
kid." The kid grinned. Descending toward Horsehead, he had before
him a narrow dusty strip closely girt by the pines, turning one
blind bend and another. He rode with the bravado of a young man who
was about important business. Coleman had told him so, and the
words made strong drink to his thirsty pride. He saw himself as he
wanted to see himself&mdash;a man on a desperate venture, a man
crafty and resourceful, a man riding so easily into great risks
that other men would be saying of him: "There goes a fighter." He
thought of this so vividly that it became the truth to him.</p>

<p>Half-down the grade he moved from the trail to timber, pausing
behind trees to scan the vistas opening before him, to listen to
all stray sounds, and at last caught sight of Horsehead's housetops
at the foot of the hills. To this point he had been confident;
here, now, a chill shook and grew tight and at that moment one part
of Alvy stood off and viewed the other part with shame.</p>

<p>He rode the last few yards in greater and greater caution and
reached the edge of the pines, here stopping to study the house and
the yard and the surrounding area. Two horses stood still against
the corral bars, hungry and waterless the last twelve hours. A band
of chickens foraged the back area of the house and somebody's
underwear hung on the clothesline near the bunkhouse. There was no
other sign of life on the place. Alvy waited a quarter hour to be
sure of this, meanwhile playing with the idea of going inside the
house. It was a risky thing to do, for the crossing between the
trees and the house was fifty yards wide and made a plain target of
him in the event somebody was inside. Fear was a wind in his belly;
it placed an oil scum on his face. He hated himself for his
weakness, and the need of crossing the open strip grew greater and
greater until he knew he had to do it or never face himself
again.</p>

<p>He moved into the open. The horses in the corral swung, scenting
him in the wind. They nickered at him and the sound whirled him
back to the timber. He cursed himself under his breath, turned and
ran up to the kitchen door. He pulled himself from the saddle. When
he hit the ground his legs shook but he clamped his teeth together
and walked through the open kitchen doorway.</p>

<p>There was a pan of bread on the table, and a cold pot of coffee
on the stove. He broke off half a loaf and moved through the house,
eating as he traveled. The front door was also open and from it he
had a view of the Horsehead grass to the north. Nothing there. His
courage crept back. Returning to the kitchen he drank cold coffee,
left the house and got on the horse.</p>

<p>He felt like a man and the old dreaming came back and he grew
reckless, "Ought to scout the flats out there," he told himself and
instantly regretted it. He tried to believe he hadn't said it but
his conscience taunted him until he turned the horse and set out
upon the grass.</p>

<p>Tracks led him straight to the ford, through occasional cattle
grazing. The ranch and the shelter of the foothills dropped behind
him and the fear stuck with him all the way to the ford. When he
got there he felt better. He had pleased his conscience again, and
now he said to himself, "Ought to cross and scout the country
around Trumbo's."</p>

<p>He crossed and turned south along the riverbank, now far out on
alien soil. Distance was all around him and the river itself was a
barrier he could not jump, except by backtracking to the ford. He
rode with his eyes steadily moving and his breath lifted and fell
upon a suddenly thin air. He played his part of a big man, but the
fear never left him and when he got within a mile of the timber,
near Trumbo's, he put the horse into a run and kept it there until
he was in the shelter of the pines.</p>

<p>He stopped a moment to clear the sweat from his face and to
consider what he should next do. He thought of how he would say to
Coleman when he returned: "I scouted the flats, crossed the ford
and went as far as Trumbo's place." He would roll a cigarette while
he talked, to show his easiness in the matter. The Horsehead crowd
would watch him and they would think better of him than they had
before. But then he seemed to hear Coleman's voice say: "What the
hell did you think was smart about dragging all around the prairie,
boy?"</p>

<p>He wanted Coleman's approval more than he wanted any other
thing. He wanted the casual nod of equality from that smart, tough
man who had ridden the trail and had held his own part. For,
although he did not realize it, he was a hero-worshipper and his
pattern now was Coleman. Then he remembered he had played the part
of informer for Trumbo, and keen shame came upon him. Coleman would
despise him for that. He thought: "I'll get closer to Trumbo's
ranch and see if anything's doing there," and moved on
southeastward through the trees. He had not ridden fifty yards when
a voice&mdash;Trumbo's voice&mdash;came at him like a bullet from
some part of the timber.</p>

<p>"Stand fast. Alvy."</p>

<p>The shock of it froze him in the saddle. He was so chilled and
so frightened that he did not try to move his head until he heard a
horse come forward from his rear. Then he turned slowly and watched
Trumbo ride up. Trumbo was smiling; there seemed to be a
friendliness in the man. Trumbo, the kid thought, figured that he
had broken away from Horsehead to bring more news. Maybe he could
get through this by lying a little. As he thought so he caught the
edge of his constant dream; he was a cool fighter facing another
hard man in a dangerous scene. It was a small, soon-dying vision,
for the fear hung on and made him small and he wanted to run and he
wished with a passionate hopelessness that he had not crossed the
ford.</p>

<p>"Well, Alvy," said Trumbo, "what's news?"</p>

<p>He was smiling and he was easy but to Alvy's fear-sharpened eyes
there was a difference, there was something cloudy-black in
Trumbo's glance.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Alvy, "I was just ridin' by."</p>

<p>"Pulling out, Alvy?"</p>

<p>"That's it," said Alvy, and adopted the excuse thankfully, "A
little too tough for me. I got nothing against the Basin
people."</p>

<p>"Where'd you leave Coleman, Alvy?"</p>

<p>Alvy made a half-hearted stand and gave a vague answer. "Up in
the hills."</p>

<p>Trumbo's voice was increasingly friendly, his smile remained.
"Alvy," he said, "we're old friends. You've brought information to
me before. Someday I mean to do something for you. Whereabouts in
the hills?"</p>

<p>Alvy's mind was a slow mind. He could not duck the question and
he could not think fast enough to get ahead of it. "Quite a ways
up."</p>

<p>"At summit, Alvy?"</p>

<p>"That's about it."</p>

<p>"Everybody still with Coleman?"</p>

<p>"The girl pulled out with Solvay."</p>

<p>Trumbo's smile lessened, "That leaves just four of them?" He hit
Alvy with his glance. "I always know when a man's lyin'. Be
careful&mdash;don't lie to me now. Just where is Coleman
hidin'?"</p>

<p>Alvy blurted out a futile protest, "I don't like to help get a
man killed."</p>

<p>"Who said he'd be killed," asked Trumbo. "We're just going to
drive him out. Don't fool with me. Where's he hiding?"</p>

<p>"Up in the Olally meadows," said Alvy. He lowered his eyes, he
sank into abysmal depths. Every dream stood in ruins and his
conscience was a loud voice saying: "You're just a fool kid, you're
afraid, you're crooked, there is no good in you and never was." He
lifted his eyes to Trumbo and dully spoke, "That's all I know."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Alvy," said Trumbo. "Keep right on riding."</p>

<p>Alvy swung by Trumbo, obsessed by the memory of Coleman's black
eyes boring into him. He heard Coleman say again: "If a man give
his word he keeps it if it kills him." Never otherwise would he
have attempted what he did. But the things inside him were more
than he could bear and Coleman's words were alive and loud in his
ears; and then he had one more great surge of bravado, one more
dream of producing triumph out of disaster. Prompted by it, he
swung and drew his gun.</p>

<p>His great moment never came. Trumbo had already drawn and now
held his revolver steady on him. Trumbo said, "I thought
so&mdash;you're a cheap kid," and fired once. Alvy heard the sound
and he felt the bullet knock him back. He slipped from the saddle
and he fell through space. The strange thing was that he seemed
never to strike ground; he fell on and on through this endless
space, out of the land of the alive.</p>

<p>Trumbo rode forward and bent in the saddle, long looking down at
the lank, immature-face. He said aloud, "I have not done that for
three years." It would have been better, he thought, if he had not
killed the kid; for the act brought forward an older pattern of his
life. It took him back to his wilder days when he had made
something of a name of himself as a tough, far south of the Basin.
From that name and from that past he had deliberately fled, wise
enough to know that a man with a reputation for fighting sooner or
later invited his own death.</p>

<p>He had run away from his record; somewhere down the trail there
were men who still hunted him. This was what Stuart had found out
about him. This was why Stuart wanted him. He had a skill Stuart
needed. Watching the dead kid, he shook his head and regretted the
act. There was no reaction of pity, no particular human feeling,
and by this he knew he had not destroyed his past years or the
qualities which had produced them. They had slept and now were
awake.</p>

<p>He rode to the edge of timber to scan the open range northward
and he thought, "Coleman smelled it. He knew I had used a gun."
Coleman was a wise man. Coleman was the same type, except for a
different strain in him. Coleman could kill, but never except for a
well-grounded reason.</p>

<p>He was also thinking in his close way of what had to be done.
Stuart had tried to trap him on Horsehead and leave the death of
Doa Gertrude at his door. Stuart had failed, but would try again.
The death of the woman was a shadow over them all, to be removed
only by removing the spectators at the scene. Trumbo never
concealed harsh things from himself; so now he ticked off in his
mind those men who had to die if he were to remain in the Basin:
Coleman, Pairvent, Baldy, Ed Drum, Ray Miller and Ben Solvay. There
was also the woman; but if she left the country he would be
content. Beyond that, there remained the problem of Stuart, but
that was for another day. First things first.</p>

<p>He turned back to his ranch and half an hour later rode into the
yard and stepped down at his porch. As he did so, Dan Stuart came
out of the house and faced him.</p>

<p>"You kept me waitin'," he said.</p>

<p>Trumbo, staring at his unexpected visitor, observed the
confidence in Stuart and at once swung about. The Star Cross crew
was at the moment coming out of the timber. He had been neatly
outmaneuvered, but even then he felt himself on sound enough ground
to show Stuart a sharp grin. "Still need me, Dan?"</p>

<p>"That's why I'm here," said Stuart. "We'll cross the river and
climb the hill until we find Coleman's outfit."</p>

<p>Trumbo said: "What made you figure I'd stay on Horsehead last
night, takin' the blame?"</p>

<p>Stuart gave Trumbo a surly stare. "You're old enough to defend
yourself."</p>

<p>"You've got gall enough for an elephant."</p>

<p>"I want to see Horsehead hangin' in a row, kickin' as they
hang."</p>

<p>Stuart had gone through the same thought that he had, reaching
the same answer. Doa Gertrude was a fact before them all,
unavoidable and not to be ignored. For a moment Trumbo had a
strange pulse of warning. Maybe Doa Gertrude, dead, was stronger
than all the living and maybe her hand would point at them forever.
He shook it aside, "I'll go along."</p>

<p>"We'll pick up Spade on the way," said Stuart.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Ann Stuart left War Bonnet by morning and reached Horsehead three
hours later, immediately noting the new grave in the pines. She
stopped to call out, "Hello, house," and raised no answer.
Dismounting, she walked through the house, had a look at the rear
yard and put her head inside the crew quarters. She noticed the two
horses penned in the corral, let them out and pumped water into the
near-by trough for them.</p>

<p>She had so long traveled around the Basin that she took no great
amount of time guessing Coleman's whereabouts. They would not,
running from gunfire, go out on the flat. They would have hit for
the nearest possible shelter&mdash;the ravines and deep pine
thickets lying back of the house. The next question was, how far
would she have to go to overtake them? The answer to that depended
entirely on the kind of man Coleman was; and therefore she had her
answer. He could not be frightened, and he would not give up
Horsehead and so he would not be far off. She paused by Doa
Gertrude's grave, remembering the Spanish woman so clearly, her
gentle hospitality, her old woman's sweet-sharp wisdom, and she
cried a little over Doa Gertrude's grave, and turned away.</p>

<p>She went into the kitchen, knowing the Horsehead men would be
hungry. She found a muslin flour sack, collected half a dozen cans
of tomatoes, some dried apricots, a mess of onions and potatoes,
and the bread on the table; out in the cooler above the well she
discovered a chunk of boiling beef. Returning to the kitchen, she
ground up a supply of coffee, found a coffee pot and a frying pan,
and prepared to mount. She had trouble lifting the sack to the
saddle and spent some time tying it to the horn.</p>

<p>As soon as she rode into the trail she observed the prints of
many horses' feet scuffed in the dark dust; these were, for a half
mile, all upward-bound prints. At that point one set came downhill;
somebody had started back for the ranch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she got to thinking of Valencia Wilder. The girl would
be with the men, since there was nothing else for her to
do&mdash;and her presence would be an extra problem for Coleman.
The thought troubled her; she could not keep from her mind the
question of Coleman's interest in Valencia. The girl had a dark and
intense pair of eyes, beautiful hair and a face that would stir any
man, even so strong a man as Coleman; or particularly a man as
strong as Coleman. For precisely because of the depth and the width
of his nature he would have heavy appetites. He could appreciate a
pretty woman; she had seen that appreciation in his eyes at Gateway
and in the hills. She had seen the flare of his sudden, warmed
thoughts. He was in that respect very human. Yet though it had been
a deeply personal interest, it had not been offensive. Even as he
had struck into her with his eyes, arousing her, he had smiled away
his trespass.</p>

<p>What would he see in Valencia&mdash;what answer would there be
for him in the girl's eyes? The thought rode with her and never
quite left her mind; it was a darkness and a weight. "I thought I
was almost in love with one man," she told herself, "How can I
believe, so soon afterwards, that I could love another?" Then an
unhappy thought gripped her. Valencia was really beautiful. Perhaps
she was not better than she should be and no doubt Tracy knew that.
But if he liked her he would never let that stop him. He would take
her as she was. Either for a little while, or else by marriage. She
changed that last part. "No, not for a little while. I don't think
he'd be happy with that. But against her, how plain I am."</p>

<p>This inward search had nothing to do with her eyes. They
rummaged the trail steadily, the trees and the tracks on the
ground. She caught the smell of pines, she heard all the little
sounds and knew what they were. She was a fair, alert girl with
expressive gray eyes, with little changes occurring around her
lips, by turns grave and humorous as the spirit moved her, and she
carried herself with reliance.</p>

<p>At the jaws of the meadow she paused, seeing the tracks turn in.
She sat still in the saddle, looking about her, and at last she
called toward the timber on the opposite side of the trail. "Come
on out of it."</p>

<p>Baldy appeared, bearing his surprise. "How'd you know?"</p>

<p>"A good general always puts out pickets."</p>

<p>"Well, keep on goin' up the trail. We just got rid of one woman.
Don't need another."</p>

<p>She smiled at Baldy. "Had anything to eat lately?"</p>

<p>Baldy looked glum, "No. You got somethin' to eat in that sack?"
He drew a troubled breath, "For God's sake, girl. You're a Stuart.
What you foolin' around Horsehead for? Here's a bunch of men all
bound for a hangin' since they was eight years old. You're doin'
yourself no good."</p>

<p>She smiled again and moved into the rock defile. "Your heart's
all right, Baldy, but I can see your stomach's got the best of
you."</p>

<p>The echo of her horse traveled ahead of her through the stony
corridor. When she turned the bend into the meadow she met Pairvent
head on, his gun lifted and his strange mud-black eyes sighting at
her along its barrel. She noticed his startled expression; he
lowered the gun and turned rapidly on his heels as though he had
committed an improper act. Coleman came up from the far side of the
meadow.</p>

<p>She watched him with a greater attention than she realized; she
was anxious to see the first reaction on his face and she found her
heart beating higher. He stopped at the head of her horse, sober
and troubled. His glance searched her thoroughly and then he
reached for his hat and she saw a trace of a smile and the change
of his eyes. It brightened the whole day.</p>

<p>He said: "How'd you find us?"</p>

<p>"I told you once I could find you anywhere. These are my
mountains." She untied the thongs holding the muslin sack. "Are you
hungry?"</p>

<p>He caught the bag as it fell and opened the top, and the
broadest possible smile lighted his face, "Heaven must be owned and
operated by women like you. George, you're the cook."</p>

<p>Pairvent came back and looked into the sack; he gave Ann a
grudging glance of approval and took the sack away, calling to Ray
Miller, "Catch up a fire. Ray."</p>

<p>Coleman had not asked her to step down, and now he was serious.
"You're makin' a tough situation for yourself. Your father's
probably in the hills now. How did you come?"</p>

<p>"Up from Horsehead."</p>

<p>"Better go back by Gateway."</p>

<p>"Let me stay a little while."</p>

<p>A day's growth of whiskers glittered like metal filings on his
face and, except when he smiled at her, the whole set of his
features was harsh. Looking down upon him she noticed the width of
his shoulders and the heavy roundness of his neck muscles. She put
a hand to his shoulder and at that instant she saw the flash of
warmth come to his eyes. He lifted his arms and as she dropped to
the ground he took her whole weight for a moment. He stepped
immediately back and looked away from her. She had stirred him.
Knowing it, she felt an uplift of spirit. It was good to know she
had the power to do that.</p>

<p>He said: "I sent Alvy down to have a look at the ranch. You see
him?"</p>

<p>"No, but there was one set of tracks going downhill. They faded
out about half a mile from the house."</p>

<p>"Probably he's playing Indian somewhere."</p>

<p>"Don't trust Alvy. He might betray you. I know he used to ride
over to Drew's. There was some arrangement between them."</p>

<p>"I suspected that. There was an arrangement between Trumbo and
Pairvent also."</p>

<p>She said: "You still put trust in Alvy after that?"</p>

<p>"There's some good in the kid. I am hoping he'll grow up."</p>

<p>"You're a kind man. Tracy, but you've not got a single rider you
can depend on."</p>

<p>"You can dig as deep a hole with a broken shovel as with a sound
one, if you've got to."</p>

<p>She looked into the meadow and saw only Pairvent and Ray Miller
crouched over the fire. Alvy was out on scout, Baldy hidden in the
trail. "Where's Ed Drum and Solvay?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the rim of the sheer canyon wall. "Ed's up there.
I sent Ben on to Gateway with Valencia."</p>

<p>He mentioned the girl's name casually but his hands went to his
pocket for his cigarette makings and he looked down as he built his
smoke; there was some feeling in him about her, some memory. Ann
said: "Why did you leave Horsehead?"</p>

<p>"After Doa Gertrude was killed I couldn't risk the same thing
happenin' to Valencia." He lighted his smoke and looked directly at
her. "I had not meant to bring Doa Gertrude's name into it."</p>

<p>She said: "Do you think it was my father, or one of his
men?"</p>

<p>"There's no name on a bullet, but it was your father who started
the raid." He shook his head. "I wish you were not here."</p>

<p>"I told you the other day how I felt about it."</p>

<p>He lifted his head and she saw the regret in him.</p>

<p>"That does not change it. It is beyond your power to change. If
we met and drew, you would be between us. If I shot, it would be
the same to me as though I were shootin' you."</p>

<p>His admission hit hard; it overfilled her heart and she had to
turn away from him to keep him from seeing the things that must
have come to her face, "You should not say that. You are entirely
free."</p>

<p>"You'd better go back to Star Cross," he said.</p>

<p>She had intended telling him of her broken relations with her
father. Now she knew she could not. His sense of responsibility was
strong enough that he would make her troubles his own&mdash;and he
had enough of his own. She said: "Pairvent's got something cooked
up. You go eat. I want to talk to you before I leave."</p>

<p>He turned to the fire. Ann led her horse to the creek's side for
water, her glance meanwhile running the top rim of the canyon wall.
It was near two o'clock and the sun still high; but when the light
struck the canyon and the timber it was partly lost. There was a
blackness upon these hills that no sun touched. She thought of many
things in those few minutes, of this wild heartbreaking land, of
her father, of Drew Trumbo and of Valencia; and always of
Coleman.</p>

<p>He returned from the fire, made cheerful by the meal. He stood
near her, rolling a cigarette and smiling. His eyebrows were as
black as his hair and as thick. He had a short white scar to the
left of his chin. She lifted her hand at it, "Where'd you get
that?"</p>

<p>"Four years ago, when I brought some cattle up the trail. We
stopped for a day at Dodge City." The memory of it made him grin,
"There was a saloon called the Nugget, so we all went in and maybe
we were a little bit stout. Only clear thing I remember was that a
girl came over the floor and started to sing a song at me. I do not
recall who objected. We fought our way out of the place, down the
street and all the way back to camp. It was a nice night."</p>

<p>"You like your pleasures strong, Tracy."</p>

<p>"All a man's got at the end of life is a set of
memories&mdash;things done well and things poorly done. The great
sin is to end up with nothing done." He threw away his smoke and
his glance seemed to pull her forward to him. "I can't live easy
and small. A man is full of things meant to be used or given away,
or maybe destroyed. The more he spends the more comes back. That is
all he is, something to be used, to have his fingers smashed and
his body bent, to fall down and get up. To hunt and find."</p>

<p>"To hunt for what?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, he would go no farther. Then his
temper changed and he lifted his eyes to the rim, turned alert.
"Alvy should have been back long ago. I do not like the smell of
this place."</p>

<p>"If he has betrayed you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned and called to Pairvent, "George, we'll get out of
here." Suddenly haste was upon him; it made him seize her arm and
lead her back to her horse. He gave her a hand up and turned to his
own horse. He sent a call up to the cliff. "Come in. Ed!" He put
his horse to a gallop and threaded the rock defile with Ann at his
heels. The sound of it had brought Baldy out of the timber. Baldy
said, "What's up?"</p>

<p>Coleman stopped. He made a motion for silence and he looked down
the trail, listening, and he faced the trail's upper side and
watched it a long while. He heard nothing and he saw nothing and
still it was plain to the girl how some kind of clear warning
disturbed him. He murmured: "They're comin' from one direction or
the other. I can't tell which one."</p>

<p>Ann said: "Dad was in War Bonnet this noon. He couldn't have had
time to circle around by Gateway. If he's near here it will be on
the Horsehead side."</p>

<p>Coleman swung uptrail at once. Ed Drum had meanwhile turned off
the rim and now advanced down the trail. The sight of the group
coming along at so fast a gait set him about; and he ran before
them, on through the trees and around the short bends. A mile or
thereabouts onward, Coleman called a halt.</p>

<p>"George," he said, "pick another hide-out."</p>

<p>Pairvent sat still, thinking, and seemed to find no suitable
point in his mind. He said: "We got to stay away from the river or
they'll box us in. As for these hills, west. I never put a horse
through 'em. Maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ann crowded around Coleman and on past Ed Drum. "I know where to
go."</p>

<p>Coleman said: "I don't want you in this, Ann."</p>

<p>She looked back, almost laughing at him; and turned and led the
party away. Some distance from the original starting point, she
left the trail and struck straight through the thickening trees,
upward into half-passable land. They dropped to a walk, the horses
grunting and sighing with the heavy labor of the climb. The sun
still remained above the horizon and still touched the high peaks
of the range; but in here twilight had already come.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Trumbo, leading Star Cross, stopped briefly at Horsehead to have a
look at the yard; and noticed the two horses roaming through it.
"Somebody's been back," he pointed out. He took to the hills at
once, going upward by one grade and another. Two hours from
Horsehead found them in the roughest possible country, with Stuart
grumbling his dislike for the slowness of advance. They made a
hard, slanting descent into a ravine and toiled up its far side;
and at this point Trumbo signaled behind him for a quieter
approach. Sliding forward, again down-grade, they came to the edge
of timber and looked out upon an open flat boxed in by a high cliff
on the other side&mdash;upon the Olally meadows quitted by Coleman
not quite ten minutes before.</p>

<p>Trumbo noticed the remnants of the fire and he made a close
survey of the rocks; he swore at himself and he led the party into
the meadow, turning through the rock defile to the main trail. He
caught the smell of dust and he drifted downgrade until he lost it
and came back, pointing upward.</p>

<p>"Not far ahead of us."</p>

<p>Tap said: "Better be a little careful."</p>

<p>"Go on. Drew," urged Stuart, "We're wasting time. It'll be dark
as the inside of a gut in another hour."</p>

<p>Trumbo said: "This dust smell is goin' to give them away. We're
on the right track."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Stuart, more and more impatient. "Get it</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. CHANGE AND LOSS</h2>

<p class="first">ANN HALTED in a small bowl-like area lying in the
heart of these massive, uptilted and fast blackening mountains.
Coleman, thrown off in his sense of direction, made a slow turn. He
pointed a hand and said: "That's south."</p>

<p>"West," said Ann.</p>

<p>Pairvent grumbled: "You've got us lost, girl."</p>

<p>"I'm not lost," she said.</p>

<p>"You're soon pullin' out," said Pairvent, "That leaves us in a
damned dark alley. If we get flushed by Star Cross we better know
where we are or else we'll head straight into a blind corral.
Where's the trail?"</p>

<p>"That way," said Ann, and pointed, "But don't try to go that way
when you leave. Star Cross will block it first thing, if they come.
Don't go north. That will bring you to the edge of the Olally
cliff, which boxes you in. Don't try the west. You could never get
through with your horses unless you had me along. The way out is to
the south."</p>

<p>Pairvent grumbled some uneasy thing half under his breath. His
man-feeling was offended to be thus dependent on a woman and he had
no faith in any Stuart. "We'd better go on south then. Right now.
One back door ain't enough. They might close it on us."</p>

<p>"Neither my father nor Trumbo knows the country well enough,"
pointed out Ann.</p>

<p>Baldy said: "My God I'm hungry. Why didn't you fellows think to
bring some of that grub along?"</p>

<p>Ed Drum grumbled: "Shut up. I'm empty too."</p>

<p>Blackness crowded into the bowl, sky-light was vaguely above
them. Horsehead's crew stood alert and glum and uncertain. Ann had
moved away. Coleman heard her voice from a far spot.</p>

<p>"Tracy," she said, and drew him on by the sound of her voice.
She touched his arm and went into the farther blackness with him
until the discontented talk of the crew was a murmur. She stopped
and turned and he saw the pale outline of her face as it lifted.
"Tracy," she said, "a man like you never runs unless he's unsure of
himself. You have been in the hills all day, just waiting. It isn't
like you to wait. There's something holding you back. I feel it and
the crew feels it. I can tell by the way they look at you."</p>

<p>"You're tellin' me to move against Star Cross?"</p>

<p>"I'm telling you that you must either start out of the country
now, or else you must fight my father. But you cannot fight him
with half a heart. It will make you slow, and if you are slow you
will be killed. What I fear is that I have made you undecided. I
don't want you to think of me. Do what you must do, regardess of
how it hurts anybody else."</p>

<p>"It would go hard for you to stand over your father's body and
know that I killed him."</p>

<p>She sighed and her voice lessened. "You are less a stranger to
me than my father. It would be harder for me to know that he had
killed you, than to know you had killed him."</p>

<p>"I do not understand that."</p>

<p>"It is too long a story." She wanted to tell him but she would
not. Her troubles were her own and she kept them to herself so
strictly that not even Trumbo had known the gulf between father and
daughter. With Coleman it was somewhat different. She knew now that
he meant a great deal to her; she knew it because of her desire to
tell him something she had never wished to tell another. But she
held it back.</p>

<p>"Mighty odd," he said in a grave, wondering tone, "how a man
will think of things he never thought of before. When I was twenty
a good fight was the best thing in life. If anybody had told me
then that I would stand in the middle of a forest, eight years
later, and dodge a fight, I would have knocked him over. You're
right. I am not sure." He shook his head, never having been unsure
before. "I did not know that all this was in my head until you
mentioned it."</p>

<p>"Put me out of your thoughts, if that is the reason."</p>

<p>"Maybe the sight of you brought it on. But it goes on from you
onto other things. Those things are not all clear. Your father will
drop, or I will, when we meet. That makes me think of you. But then
it comes to me what piece of ground is worth a killing? And what is
a man for&mdash;to seize what he wants and to hold it against all
men until he's worn out? Or is it to be riding free, takin' what
comes and lettin' other men do the same?"</p>

<p>She murmured: "I can't bring you the answer."</p>

<p>He sat down on the ground and he rolled a cigarette. She dropped
beside him, her shoulder touching him. The lighted match was a
great explosion in the black night, shining dark-red on his face;
he looked at her and saw the glow of her eyes, the wide attention
in them. The light went out.</p>

<p>"A man's like a shovel, which is no good standing in the shed.
It has to turn soil and get scoured bright, and be filed smaller
and smaller and someday break. Then it is through&mdash;but it has
seen a lot of work. Well, a useless man is small. So is a man who
lives only to grab and hold. This Basin has made a lot of men
small."</p>

<p>"It changes everything. It turns and twists everyone."</p>

<p>"So I have seen," he said, "Except you. It has left its mark on
you, but it has not changed you. You're stronger than the
Basin."</p>

<p>The cigarette burned bright, burned dull. Farther away the
Horsehead men were murmuring. A wind ran in steady sighing through
the pines, cold at this elevation. Coleman bent his big hands
together, pushing his steady thoughts through untraveled places.
The girl said nothing but her nearness buoyed him and then she put
her hand on his arm and it was like the tug of a line on a drifting
ship.</p>

<p>"But a man can be small by runnin' free. He spends the days and
comes to no halt and someday is old and has found nothing. The
world is full of drifters."</p>

<p>"Go deeper," she said. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"All I know," he said, "is it has been close by since I've been
in the Basin. Don't know what it is."</p>

<p>Her voice came softly at him, it pressed him forward. She was
the echo of his conscience speaking. "Will you stay or go? You must
know that tonight."</p>

<p>"What would you do?"</p>

<p>"I'm not Tracy Coleman."</p>

<p>"The sound of your voice is like&mdash;" He stopped and was long
still. When he resumed talking he had pulled the warmth out of it;
she felt the change and wondered, and was hurt. "A man can't run
from his chores. I have led these men into trouble. The rope is
waitin' for them all. Maybe it was waitin' for them before I came,
but I dragged them nearer to it. That is my doing."</p>

<p>"If you run, they will run. They will escape. They are not part
of your responsibility. No, it is what you want. You alone. What do
you want to do?"</p>

<p>"You're holdin' me to it, hard and fast."</p>

<p>"Because you are uncertain. You were never made to be that
way."</p>

<p>He threw the cigarette away. He drew a long breath. "If I left
this place I'd always be lookin' back over my shoulder, knowin' I
missed something, I do not know what. I will have to play it out
here."</p>

<p>She rose and stood above him, "Then do it. You will face Star
Cross sooner or later. Don't think of me then."</p>

<p>"Too late for you to ride on tonight. Camp here until mornin'.
At daylight I'll be takin' the crew back to Horsehead."</p>

<p>She was still not certain of him. So she said: "Once I heard you
say that you did what had to be done, no doubts and no regrets.
Don't change from that, Tracy. It is the only way you can
live."</p>

<p>He rose and took her arm and walked toward the shadowy group.
"Back to Horsehead when daylight comes," he said.</p>

<p>Pairvent murmured, "Never should have left," and moved away. Ann
disappeared into the outer darkness. When Coleman found her again
she had taken saddle and blanket from her horse; she had rolled up
in the blanket. He crouched near her: "Ann," he said, "what are you
thinkin'?"</p>

<p>She was silent. Her hand came up and touched him and dropped. He
rose and moved away.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Trumbo stopped the Star Cross column when dark came, "Dust smell's
gone. They left the trail here, but they'll have to camp. Can't
travel at night in that country. We'll stay here until light."</p>

<p>"Which way did they go?" asked Stuart.</p>

<p>Trumbo thought about it. "Pairvent knows the country. He
wouldn't let Coleman lead them into the big canyon. South, I think.
Over the summit toward Gateway. We'll head 'em off. Daylight's
about four-thirty. We'll move on at four."</p>

<p>They stayed in the trail and unsaddled for a cold camp. Trumbo
built a smoke and lighted it, a new thought occurring to him. He
said: "Stuart, where's your daughter?"</p>

<p>"In town."</p>

<p>Trumbo's mind worried the facts before him, terrier fashion.
"None of that outfit knows much about these hills, yet they're
battin' around like it was level ground. Somebody with them knows
this country like a book. I keep thinkin' of your daughter."</p>

<p>"She's in town," growled Stuart.</p>

<p>Trumbo pinched out his cigarette and settled on his blanket, his
suspicions growing. Ann had said she could not be neutral in the
fight. She would go to Coleman if her sense of rightness was
sufficiently stirred. She was like that, following her convictions
into strange places. A new feeling got into Trumbo and ate at his
pride like an acid and for the first time he began to think of the
personal relations between Ann and Coleman; and a furious
bitterness rose, so that he was no longer the cool and distantly
amused schemer that he had been.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
After leaving Valencia, Ben Solvay backtracked the trail for an
hour, deeply pondering his reasons for so doing, and presently his
thoughts got too involved for him and he dismounted and sat on a
rock to work his way through the confusion. Here he was, he told
himself, a man going out on an errand he had no heart in, for the
sake of a woman who wanted the man she was sending him baek to
help; and when that became clear to him he told himself that he
would not do this fool's errand.</p>

<p>It was but a momentary rebellion, for he knew he would do what
she wished. He had not the power to put her out of his mind. It was
hard to realize that he, Ben Solvay, who did his day's chores and
was content with the day, could be so greatly changed and so
weakened. For it was a weakness to him that he no longer abided his
own convictions. In a way it was a disease which had destroyed
something in him&mdash;like Tyco Rhett in town who, having had
typhoid, was no longer the same.</p>

<p>"When a man's alone," he thought, "he's complete, he needs
nothin'. But then he sees a woman and he gives something to her. He
never gets it back. If he wants to be whole again he's got to go to
the woman."</p>

<p>It went farther. As a man alone he had nobody to please but
himself; he was his own guide and his own judge and his own wants
were simple. He counted his own winnings and found them good. That
was changed. There was no pleasure in lone thoughts and he saw that
his triumphs were stale when he could not share them; and he found
himself measuring things according to Valencia's eyes.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;and his thoughts were moving fast and
irregularly&mdash;he had an odd idea. Coleman once had said: "You
sleep well at night and do not dream." He had not understood those
words. Now their meaning came to him like the sound of a gunshot
through the dark. There were other things than sleeping and eating.
There were strange images before a man, and strange visions and
great tides on the inward sweep; there was a world below the world
he saw, and in that world there were powerful feelings and agonies
and hungers and shames and beauties. And this world had been opened
by one woman suddenly appearing before him, and the old comforts
and satisfactions of his days were gone forever and he would be
going through hell and heaven for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>He thought: "How did Coleman know all this? Is one man born
different from another, or has he gone through his torment before
me?"</p>

<p>There would be torment for him in knowing that it was Coleman
she wanted. He foresaw that as an unhealing burn inside him, the
pain of it lasting as long as he lasted. When he had first heard
about her he had known her love had gone to another man&mdash;now
dead. He had prepared himself for that. It had not seemed important
then. Now that he had seen her, it was important. Then he thought:
"If she loved that fellow, how could she love another one?" He had
figured love was a single flame which, once destroyed, never burned
again. He went deeper and deeper into strange, unknown depths,
through the black tunnels of human behavior, lost and without
direction; and presently the tag end of a new thought came to him:
Maybe a woman's need to love a man and to be loved by him was so
much of her life that it went to the grave with one man but could
not be buried with him. Maybe it was like the need of air to
breathe, something that could not stop. Maybe that was the secret
of living, the reason for it.</p>

<p>And maybe there was in people a pull, like to like. She had
known him first and she had made a bargain with him. Then she had
seen Coleman; and he was the man&mdash;something in the sound of
Coleman's voice, in his eyes, in the shape of his body, something
like that crossing the air to her. He thought it until he grew
confused and shook his head. He had gone through so steady a vigil
with himself and had been so disrupted and torn apart and shaken by
the thoughts racing through him that he felt no particular
antagonism toward Coleman.</p>

<p>He had dismounted from the horse as one man; in the growing
shadows he returned to the saddle, humbled into another man. Wisdom
had come to Ben Solvay in the shape of doubt and wonder. Nothing
was positive any more. From here on even the shadows in the sky and
the pattern of the trees through twilight would not be quite the
same; nor would he ever see these things without stretching his
senses forward to reach the things singing so strangely over the
earth.</p>

<p>It was night when he reached the summit of the divide&mdash;a
swift blackness swinging cape-like around him. Not sure of his
destination, he drew off the trail, unsaddled and camped. If anyone
came along the trail he'd hear and follow; otherwise he would wait
for day.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. ECHO OF THE RIVER</h2>

<p class="first">AT TWO o'clock Coleman relieved Ray Miller on
watch. A sharp pinching cold lay throughout the hills, and the
world was a dead ball rushing through dead space. He took his
blanket over to Ann and laid it around her shoulders, and moved to
a far corner of the bowl. Near four a first skim-milk color diluted
the coffee-black shadows, and he circled the bowl, rousing the men.
When he reached Ann he found she had already wakened, and now sat
upright in her blankets. He crouched close, catching the
half-asleep softness of her face.</p>

<p>"Time to go," he said.</p>

<p>She rose at once. She stood still, working at the pins in her
hair, "Don't look too closely at me," she said.</p>

<p>He caught up his blanket and saddled his horse. Baldy was
quietly cursing the world, "Second day and nothin' to eat. Next
time you knotheads find grub. I'll do the cookin'." Ed Drum's horse
pitched along the clearing and suddenly stopped dead, brought in by
Ed's quick hand; this was no morning for fiddling. Ann rode beside
the group. "Straight over the mountain," she said.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Pairvent, a surly man turned infinitely worse by
wear and suspicion, "Look at what's ahead of us."</p>

<p>They were still short of the crest of the big hills. That somber
mass lay before them and above them, disheartening to men cold and
weary and cranky, "Take us too long to get over the hump. Maybe get
lost as well."</p>

<p>"I won't get you lost," said Ann. "I can go through here with my
eyes shut."</p>

<p>Pairvent hated the thought of being in her hands; he was set
against her and would not change, "The horses ain't had grass and
they'll play out by the time we get up there. If we get chased
they'll have no steam left for a run. This won't do."</p>

<p>Ed Drum, the most quiet man in the group, now put in his blunt
addition: "Time to turn around and go home."</p>

<p>Miller said nothing. Baldy, stabbed by hunger, made a grunting
assent. The crew. Coleman thought, had reached the end of its rope.
He said: "We're goin' home. But if Stuart is on our trail he will
have followed our tracks as far as the turnoff. If we go back that
way we'll run straight into him. I'd rather pick my own ground for
fightin'. Roundabout is the best idea."</p>

<p>"Hell with it," said Pairvent. "We been roundabout too
long."</p>

<p>In that out-and-out defiance Pairvent had, Coleman guessed, Drum
and Baldy with him. There was always a sour point in men which,
once reached, made handling of them impossible. He could do two
things, either make a show of force, or let them go as they wished.
At four o'clock in the morning a show of force seemed foolish. He
made up his mind quickly, "You go back to the trail in any manner
you please. I'm followin' Miss Stuart to the summit. I'll hit the
trail there and come back. Wait for me."</p>

<p>Miller now spoke out, "Never wise to split."</p>

<p>"No," said Coleman, "it is not wise. But it is less wise for all
of us to walk straight into Star Cross."</p>

<p>Pairvent's jealous suspicion never lessened. "You sure you're
coming back when you get to the summit?"</p>

<p>"I'll pass over the remark for the time bein', George. When you
move on, don't start the brass band."</p>

<p>It was now light enough to bring up the shadows of horses and
men. Pairvent said, "Come on," and rode away. Drum and Baldy
behind. Ray Miller sat fast, his smart mind caught by the
situation. "You're right," he said to Coleman. "We should circle.
But there's no handling George when he ain't had a meal. This is
bad, I better go with the crew. One more gun in case we hit a
snag."</p>

<p>"Wait off the trail for me when you get there," said Coleman.
Ann had already moved ahead and was a vanishing shadow in the
shouldering blackness before them. He rode after her and closed the
distance. The grade began directly beyond the bowl and rose in
stiffest pitches, putting the horses to great labor. Ann tacked it
criss-cross, making short right and left angles. They came upon
thick stands of pine and worked slowly around them; they faced
layers of rock and skirted these to more passable ground; they made
long slants through open growth. At daylight she stopped to give
the horses a badly needed breather.</p>

<p>The ride had reddened her cheeks and her lips formed a turned,
smiling line. "I have ridden this country a hundred times. The evil
in the Basin doesn't climb this far. It is too tough a ride for men
to make, and nothing here is worth enough for them to steal." She
looked at him, moved to seriousness, "If men could only be pleased
with what they have. They don't lift their eyes, Tracy. They raise
dust and the dust blinds them."</p>

<p>He made a wry remark. "I am thinkin' of the coffee we threw away
yesterday. Half a pot of it."</p>

<p>Day rose in the east and somewhere out there the sun grew bright
and warm; here it still remained cold. "Once I thought Drew was
above the Basin. It was his ambition to be a big owner that dragged
him back to its level."</p>

<p>"A man and his dream."</p>

<p>"A cheap dream," she said.</p>

<p>He started to speak, and afterwards lifted himself straight on
the saddle. Below them, to north and south, was the break of one
shot, close-followed by another, the echoes bounding on through the
hills like great balls rolling on an iron floor. No other shots
followed. Coleman swung his horse about and started it downhill. He
checked in at once, "No," he said, "not that way."</p>

<p>"It came from the trail."</p>

<p>"Go on, Ann. Get to the top."</p>

<p>She rode on, forcing her horse somewhat harder. Now and then
from this high elevation Coleman had an occasional vista outward,
to see a piece of the trail lying gray and brown in the forest's
dark green. Farther east was the hint of the big canyon's deep
slash. Away in the north lay the grass plain of the Basin, slowly
turning amber under sunlight&mdash;and sunlight now began to strike
through the trees as they rode.</p>

<p>"Two shots," said Ann over her shoulder. "What does it
mean?"</p>

<p>"Sounds like one man tried and the other man beat him to
it."</p>

<p>"Suppose it was a signal?"</p>

<p>"Pairvent wouldn't give himself away with a signal. Neither
would your father."</p>

<p>They ran on up a more gradual slope and came finally to a summit
meadow lying between low peaks, rocks bare and glittering under the
sun.</p>

<p>"Straight for the trail, Ann. Damn Pairvent. I think he walked
into an ambush. How far to the trail?"</p>

<p>"Mile."</p>

<p>They went across an open area at a slow gallop. Both horses were
winded from the climb. Coleman's running with its head dropped and
grunting at each strike of its feet. They circled the bare peak and
moved into a scattered grove of stunted trees gnarled and blistered
by wind. The ground pitched downward. They left the pines behind,
fell into the dry, gravelly bed of a winter's stream&mdash;and
arrived suddenly upon the trail.</p>

<p>The girl stopped. "That way," she said, pointing to the left,
"is Horsehead." He had already lifted his reins and she knew he was
ready to go. She gave him a short, incomplete smile. She said: "So
long, Tracy, Good luck," and turned to the right, toward Gateway.
She hadn't waited for him to speak; and when he did speak it was
with one sharp word that brought her about: "Wait." He was looking
along the trail, half-lifted in his stirrups, and as she followed
his glance she saw two men gallop forward.</p>

<p>Those two came to a complete stop for a moment, staring forward
at Coleman and at her; and then one of them raced on and the other
lifted a long yell behind him and hit into the timber. The oncoming
man was Tap; he reached for his gun as he rode and although it was
still far beyond a decent shot he fired once&mdash;as though
signaling.</p>

<p>"Whole outfit right off there," said Coleman. He watched Tap
coolly; his eyelids came together and she saw the bones of his face
make their flat pressure against his skin. Nothing hurried him
while he had his quick look and came to his conclusion. "Other
way," he said and turned about. "You'd better stick with me until
we're out of this." Ann ran before him, south down the trail's
slope, around a bend. This closed them out of Tap's sight for a
moment, and Coleman immediately called at Ann: "Off the trail and
double back."</p>

<p>She swung left, ran through timber and fell over a rough break
of land; with this shelter between them and the trail she veered
left again. Coleman pulled her to a walk with a gentle "Easy. Ann."
They moved quietly north. To the left of them lay the trail, not
more than a hundred yards distant; and now they heard the hard run
of horses along it and the shout of a man's voice. Ann turned her
head so that Coleman observed the collected gravity on her cheeks.
"My father," she murmured.</p>

<p>The sound of this fast riding came to a quick halt not far away.
Stuart's voice was a clear halloo in the thin morning air. Another
man raced by and stopped, and a horse's feet crushed dead-fallen
limbs to the rear of them. Coleman murmured: "Steady."</p>

<p>Riders swept back along the adjoining trail. Ann moved ahead,
dipping and rising with the potty earth. The stringer of land still
lay beside them but, in another ten minutes, Ann made a sharp swing
downgrade and quickened the pace. She looked around, whispering:
"This is dangerous. We're drifting into the canyon. I'm trying to
make a circle back to the trail below them, before they push us any
farther down."</p>

<p>"Long day, lots of time."</p>

<p>One more shot broke, forward and to the left. As soon as she
heard it, Ann pointed directly north. The trees began to thin and
sunlight streamed down. Ann bent in her saddle, staring ahead; she
made a signal with her hand and stopped, permitting Coleman to draw
alongside. There was a road ahead of them, "That leads from the
trail to the Star mine at the bottom of the canyon. We've got to
cross it. They may be watching. Shall we turn back and try the
Gateway end?"</p>

<p>He rode to the edge of timber and looked up the road toward the
trail. He saw nothing and he heard nothing.</p>

<p>"Over we go," he said, "on the run." He waited for her to come
up and put his spurs into the horse. They left the pines, struck
the deep dust of the road and fled across, and at once heard a yell
sail out.</p>

<p>"Tap&mdash;downhill at 'em! Beau&mdash;Henry&mdash;down at
'em!"</p>

<p>Sound poured at them from their front left quarter. Star Cross
came in from that direction, hitting the rough land hard. Stuart's
unmistakable voice rose and quit and presently rose again, now
nearer. Coleman stopped, listening to all this racket. He shook his
head at Ann.</p>

<p>"Back&mdash;and down."</p>

<p>"Once we drop into the canyon we can't get out."</p>

<p>"Down we go."</p>

<p>She swung with him, slanting with the hill. The road was
directly before them but she avoided it until the ground before
them got too steep, then turned upon it. Coleman came abreast and
halted, listening into the air. The racket was behind them and
around them; and now Stuart's voice was a stronger summons
somewhere on the far side of the road, to the south. South was
Gateway&mdash;and Stuart blocked that direction.</p>

<p>"Down," said Coleman. "Take the road."</p>

<p>She obeyed, throwing her horse into the road and descending with
it. He came behind her, his gun lifted, and he rode with his body
slung around to cover the higher rear. Thus running from bend to
bend, they were sheltered from whoever followed directly on the
road. At the end of another quarter mile the girl stopped. They
were now at the very edge of the canyon, the road becoming a ledge
cut into the canyon's wall, dropping down and down to the river's
whitely broken surface. "Last chance to double back, Tracy."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Keep going."</p>

<p>They fell at once below the rim, the horses trotting stiff-
legged. Dust flared behind them and behind them was a fainter
calling. A hundred feet on he saw the gray top of a mine shack
below and a long dump of burnt-yellow dirt stretching to the very
edge of the river. The dump made a kind of breakwater, behind which
the river's edge lay calm. Beyond the dump was a smooth,
fast-flowing stretch and below this, at half a mile, the river
exploded into rapids as it fell deeper and deeper between the
canyon walls. Heat grew thick. Suddenly behind him he heard a call,
and looked back to find Tap on the high break of the ledge.</p>

<p>Ann turned a switchback. Following her, Coleman now looked up at
Tap, and at Tap's gun. The distance was close to two hundred feet
and Tap's bullet ran far overhead. Ann knew nothing of it until she
heard the echo of the shot above the river's growing growl; and
jerked up her head in surprise.</p>

<p>Tap, preparing for a second and more careful shot, suddenly
lowered the gun as if he had not recognized her before. He stared
at her, turned around and called back of him. Another Star Cross
man came down, and Drew Trumbo rode into sight at the break. Stuart
followed immediately on his heels&mdash;these four forming a
watching group. Suddenly Trumbo rode into the ledge, followed by
the others.</p>

<p>Ann pointed ahead at the slack water behind the mine dump. "Tam
Malarkey's boat."</p>

<p>The boat swung on the gravel, its oars lying inboard on the
seats. Malarkey, old in the ways of the river, had descended this
far, tied up, and had gone on. There was no sight of him on the
open stretch above or below them. By now they had reached the
narrow gravel beach. Coleman followed Ann to the back side of the
mine building, got down and took a swift glance inside the
building, "No good," he said. He had already made up his mind.
Having been brought this far downstream, the boat was stout enough
to cross him over. The river, though fast, was smooth and he had a
half-mile leeway before reaching the rapids. It seemed a good bet
but, good or bad, it was the only bet. He said to Ann: "You're safe
with your father, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"So long." He ran at the boat before she had dismounted. She
turned to watch him, then understanding what was in his mind. Star
Cross was half down the ledge, and a shot harked against the canyon
walls and she saw the bullet lift gravel near by. Coleman, reaching
the boat, made a jump into it and ran out the oars. Ann said, half
under her breath: "Oh, no&mdash;you're a target!" She said it and
rushed from the mine house toward the water, so running as to place
herself between Coleman and Star Cross coming down the slope. She
heard her father yell: "Get out of the way!" She reached the
water's edge, watching the boat drift on, and suddenly she waded
hip deep into the river and climbed over the bow of the boat.
Coleman had begun to row. He stopped rowing and looked around. "Go
back," he said, and dug his oars deep into the water, heading again
for the shore.</p>

<p>"Keep going. Keep going! I can't go back to Star Cross!"</p>

<p>Coleman reversed direction and sent the stern of the boat
through the slack water. Directly beyond the mine dump a hard
current caught the stern and swung it down. Coleman righted the
boat, nose upstream, and put all his weight into the oars. He
realized then the river was a power he knew nothing about, for with
all his sudden and rapid laboring, the boat ran down, seeming to
squat lower as the water pulled it. He turned the bow slightly,
intending to make a long diagonal for the farther shore, but as
soon as this broadside came against the current the bow swung and
then they were racing head on at the rapids.</p>

<p>Above the growing roar of the rapids, he caught Dan Stuart's
long, hard-flung cry: "Pull that bow around, you fool! Pull it
around!" He knew then why Ann had come aboard. Neither Dan Stuart
nor any Star Cross man would fire at him now.</p>

<p>But that made little difference. The smooth green surface water
raced on, faster than he dreamed water could go, and the glass
surface began to break before little ripples, and the ripples grew
into washboard waves; and suddenly before him was the churned
flurry of the rapids and the steady, monotonous racket of them. He
was broad-side and he dug deep, forward on one oar, backward on the
other, and got the stern at the rapids and called behind him: "Sit
low, Ann."</p>

<p>The current, so far straight-running, now became a trough into
which they fell, and the trough narrowed toward a boulder half-
awash and half-screened by white spray. He laid all his strength
into the oars; he heard the edge of the rock strike the boat and he
felt the lunge of the boat as it went by. Now, looking downriver,
it seemed to him the water dropped at a forty-five- degree angle,
from one boiling explosion to another. He braced his feet on the
cleats, lifted his oars clear and watched all this rush forward,
his belly made empty by the knowledge he could do nothing more.</p>

<p>"Ann," he said, "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Remember," she called back, "Luke Wall ran this river."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. MEN ALWAYS DIE ALONE</h2>

<p class="first">IT WAS Tap, in whose soul burned so pure and so
terrible a flame of loyalty to Star Cross, who first raised his gun
and fired at the boat whirling midway in the river, his desire
making him forget the girl. Trumbo whirled and knocked Tap's gun
down, "You damned dumb fool!" he shouted.</p>

<p>He received from Tap a burning, brilliant glance of hatred. Tap
lifted the gun again, obsessed and made greedy by the target
Coleman presented. It took Stuart's bawled-out shout to stop him.
"No firin'!" Then Stuart cried full-voice to the boat,
"Coleman&mdash;pull in, pull in!"</p>

<p>Even as he shouted, the boat was caught in the full-out grip of
the river, beyond the reach of Stuart's voice and beyond the power
of recall. Trumbo watched it for a full ten seconds, his glance
clinging to the girl now sitting in the boat's bottom, both hands
gripped on the combing; he saw Coleman poise the oars and swing and
speak to Ann. Her head turned and Trumbo had a dimmed view of her
face.</p>

<p>He wheeled his horse and ran down the shore line. He untied the
lariat from its thong as he rushed ahead, and shook out its loop
and began to swing it overhead. At this point the river was not
wide; from midstream to shore was not much more than thirty feet,
but the boat was ahead of him and the current rushed it on. He
scraped his spurs full across the flanks of his horse, ramming it
to a dead gallop on the difficult footing of the gravel. The horse
stumbled and almost threw him. He grabbed his horn and kicked
himself upright again. He made some gain on the boat and he thought
that if he had a long-enough run he might get alongside it, ride a
few feet into the water and let go with the rope. He had no doubt
about holding the boat once he made a throw of it.</p>

<p>He saw he would never get a long-enough run. The boat was now
nearing the top of the rapids. At that point the gravel beach
narrowed to a foot-wide ledge at the base of the canyon wall; and
great chunks of rock, fallen from the canyon's face, studded the
shallow waters near the shore. He looked at the boat on which he
was slowly gaining, he looked at the ledge; hard by the face of the
cliff he brought the horse to a somersault stop, dropped to the
ground and ran upon the ledge.</p>

<p>The canyon wall bent in a slow quarter circle. Around this the
thin pathway traveled for a distance of two hundred feet, at the
end of which it headed into a great boulder. Beyond that point
there was no footway at all. He saw this as he ran, and he kept
half a glance on the boat now bouncing in the first heavy water of
the rapids. A roar of wilder rapids came upon him and wetness was
all around him and he breathed from the bottom of his lungs. He
began swinging his loop, building it over his head as he ran; close
upon the big boulder he stopped, turning his body half- around to
get a sight on the boat, and made a long high-arched throw.</p>

<p>He knew even as he cast that it would fall short if he held on;
and in one of those instant-born decisions which come of necessity,
he let go the rope before it had stretched full. He had allowed for
the onward run of the boat, just as he would have allowed for the
onward run of a steer; the rope led the boat, so that the boat was
broadside to it when the loop came down. He watched Ann make a
perilous stand, reach high and seize the loop with her arm. She
dropped flat in the boat, snubbing the rope with her body. Trumbo
ran hip deep into the stream, made a futile grab at the rope's free
end and slowly straightened. Ann shook her head and sat down in the
boat.</p>

<p>He had a quick stab of fright at the power of the river; he dug
his boot heels into the gravel's slickness and got ashore and
climbed the big boulder. The boat's stern shot high into the air
and its how dipped from sight below a roller; he saw Coleman poise
the oars, lower them to steady the boat, and poise them again. The
current rushed at the bend of the canyon and struck it with a
slashing and a spraying, and boiled about the black and battered
rocks. The girl was just visible as she crouched low; he saw
Coleman suddenly use the oars again in swift, short stabs. The boat
slid away from the collision of water and rock, careened until its
floor boards were visible to Trumbo, and vanished around another
bend of the canyon into the greater roar below.</p>

<p>Trumbo said to himself with a dull satisfaction: "It was a good
throw." Water dripped from him; water squealed in his boots. He
sucked air into his lungs and found his legs trembling. A thought
stabbed into him, turning and gritting through his spirit, "I wish
she had thought better of me." She would be dead in another five
minutes, all of her fairness and laughter gone, her hair streaming
in the river, the beauty of her face rubbed and broken and
destroyed by it. He stood with sickness in him; he heard Dan Stuart
calling behind him but he didn't turn. Before him, moving slowly
forward on the barest edge of the shore, he recognized Tam
Malarkey.</p>

<p>Tam shouted: "How'd they get out there?"</p>

<p>Trumbo shook his head. Stuart yelled again.
"Drew&mdash;Drew!"</p>

<p>Trumbo slid from the rock. Stuart was half-along the narrow
pathway; he waved Stuart back and he followed the Star Cross owner
to the gravel beach. The old man's face was without its ruddiness.
Pale, it showed the network of broken veins, it showed its sags and
lines, its oldness and its basic cruelty.</p>

<p>"No luck," said Trumbo. He thought to himself: "Good God.
Stuart's dead inside, so dead he stinks!" He himself had some of
that deadness. Twenty years more and maybe he would look like
Stuart. He pushed the thought aside. "No luck," he repeated.</p>

<p>He stepped to his horse and turned toward the mine shanty. He
had lamed his horse in the reckless run through the gravel and he
rode slowly, Stuart tramping abreast. The Star Cross crew stood by
the mine house, watching these two come forward. Tap stared at
Trumbo, bright evil clearly shining on that narrow face. The girl
meant nothing to Tap; and at the thought of it Trumbo's rage
swelled in him and he stared at Tap and so desired to kill the man
that Tap saw it. Trumbo thought: "He knows I'll try it sooner or
later. He will beat me to it unless I watch sharp."</p>

<p>Somebody followed them, kicking the gravel. Trumbo turned to see
Tam Malarkey move forward with his old man's loose gait. Tam
stopped and scanned the group.</p>

<p>He said: "Coleman, hey?" He knew the story then, except for the
girl's part, "How'd your daughter get in that boat. Stuart?"</p>

<p>Stuart was too far sunk into himself to hear; or too indifferent
to answer. Trumbo answered for him, "She was on Coleman's side,
Tam."</p>

<p>Malarkey carried a rifle cradled in his arms, his right hand
loosely curved around the stock of the trigger guard; his eyes
drilled their holes into Stuart with an insistence Stuart at last
felt.</p>

<p>He looked at Malarkey, "Old man," he said, "get out of
here."</p>

<p>"Old?" said Tarn Malarkey, "I could walk the heart right out of
you in an hour. I could pin you to your back in half a minute. I
could break your neck with a twist of my hands. I have seen you
ride your horse like the lord of creation, but your wind is broken
and your face has got death written all over it."</p>

<p>"Old man," cried out Stuart, "shut that loose mouth!"</p>

<p>Tam shook his head both in distaste and in sorrow for what he
saw. "You Basin fellers are a bunch of wolves lookin' for dead
carcasses to feed on. You're here now, knowin' you pushed your
daughter down the river. Think you'll ever sleep again. Stuart?
Think your grub will ever taste the same? I would not care to live
in your sort of a hell."</p>

<p>Stuart made half a motion toward his gun, driven to it by the
ceaseless goading of those words. Old Tam's shoulders swung gently,
thereby presenting the raw round muzzle of his rifle at Stuart.
There was no answer to that; the old man stood his ground, his
glance rendering out a hard judgement. Stuart walked on to his
horse, gesturing his crew to follow, and turned up the trail.
Trumbo delayed his departure, considering Tam Malarkey and in a way
envious of this bony, rugged old man who had no worries, no
ambitions cankering him.</p>

<p>"Tam," he said, "it is easy for you to judge. There is nothin'
you want. How can you judge other men that want things?"</p>

<p>Old Tam cast a weather eye on Star Cross going up the trail, and
relaxed long enough to find his pipe and light it. His hair was
gray-iron, close to his skull, his skin as smooth and dark as
dressed leather. His brows made a grizzled, tangled awning over his
eyes, over his long arched nose. His glance finished its search of
Trumbo.</p>

<p>"I have made my errors, son. Only way a man learns. You will
have to do the same. But there is no way of knowin' if you'll grow
wise from your mistakes or not. Some men do not. And some men die
from their follies before knowledge comes."</p>

<p>"Not much help, Tam," said Trumbo.</p>

<p>Tam's eyes mirrored scorn. "The damned world bleats for help,
figurin' it is somethin' that comes natural." He waved a hand at
the canyon, at the river. "You think you'll get any help from this
water or these rocks? The world will beat the livin' guts out of
you if it can. You have got to help yourself or else die."</p>

<p>Trumbo shrugged his shoulders and turned from Tam's
uncomfortable presence. His pride was ruffled at the rough talk,
his temper was disturbed; yet the distantly critical eye that
looked upon his life with so complete a detachment&mdash;that
ironic and self-knowing bit of mind in him&mdash;accepted Tam's
words as full truth, and used them as malicious weapons against
himself. There was this warp and division in Drew Trumbo, this
isolated knowledge of rightness lying lonely and ineffective and
mocking in him while his will and his energy carried him on through
baser things. He knew his baseness, he lived with it and sometimes
cringed before it; but always he kept on.</p>

<p>He followed Star Cross up the trail, thinking steadily of Ann.
The strangest images of her came to him, beautiful images of her
alive and laughing, grisly images of her torn and dead. It brought
him a kind of agony and a kind of emptiness. He heard the lovely
tone of her voice, felt the warm touch of her hand; he remembered
how her shoulders made their curve at the points, he remembered the
faint freckles at the base of her nose. He went up the canyon,
sickened and weary of riding, and when he came to consider what
chore lay next, he ground his teeth together and could scareely
face it. Still, he knew he would do what Stuart intended should be
done; he could not go back, he could not change himself, he could
be no other kind of man.</p>

<p>So he followed Star Cross out of the canyon to the main north-
and-south trail, and rode down the trail for a mile and a half, at
which point Star Cross turned into the timber and stopped.</p>

<p>Pairvent, Ed Drum and Baldy stood here, trapped at this spot
earlier in the morning as they came out of the hills; and Ray
Miller, the only man alert enough to make a draw, lay dead on the
ground. Those two shots, fired by Miller and Tap, were the ones
heard from a distance by Coleman. Ambushed by Star Cross, the other
three Horsehead men had surrendered.</p>

<p>Hoby Spade and his two riders had been left behind by Stuart to
guard Horsehead. Spade showed a great deal of relief at the
reappearance of Star Cross. He said: "You took a hell of a lot of
time. Where's Coleman?"</p>

<p>Trumbo looked at Pairvent when he answered. "Coleman went down
the river in a boat. The boat's smashed to matches by this time,
and Coleman's lodged against a couple of rocks, ten feet under
water."</p>

<p>Ed and Baldy showed the full force of the news; they looked at
each other and the starch of their last hopes went out of them. It
was visible to all the watching men. Pairvent, a tough and
cross-grained character in his mildest moments, shrugged his
shoulders, "We never should have left the ranch. That was his
mistake." Then he paid his sultry respects to Stuart. "Your
daughter no doubt led him into it, as she led us into this blind
pocket. I wanted to keep goin' straight down the trail."</p>

<p>"No," said Trumbo, "she was in the same boat that went down with
Coleman."</p>

<p>That affected Pairvent. He ran a hand across his dark jaws, drew
a breath and shook his head. "Then she was square after all. She
liked Coleman."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Trumbo, dully furious at the thought, "she did."</p>

<p>Pairvent knew what lay ahead of him; it was the finish of a hard
game&mdash;the only possible finish. Even so, he was tough enough
to make an observation which ended any remote chance of mercy. "You
boys," he said, "are sure tough on women."</p>

<p>Trumbo took it without an answer; and was shocked at himself.
Stuart, all this while acting like a drugged man, suddenly
straightened and walked at Pairvent with the red haze of murder in
his eyes. "George," he said, "I'd like to stick a knife through
that tongue of yours. I'd like to strangle you until it hung out,
and cut it off." He raised his closed fist and swept it crosswise,
catching Pairvent on the side of the head. Pairvent raised his
hands in defense. He swayed from the blow&mdash;and suddenly struck
back, knocking Stuart to the ground. Tap's gun raised, centering on
Pairvent, and he took a steady aim. He would have fired if Stuart
had not yelled at him.</p>

<p>"Cut it out. That's the way he wants it." He got up and looked
at the trees around him. He pointed at them, "Those will be fine."
He motioned his crew to be at it. He passed by Tap and murmured a
word and went on. Tap turned, following him, with Trumbo watching
that little byplay closely. These two were out near the trail and
Stuart said some quiet thing in Tap's ear. Tap nodded, swinging
back; he held his eyes steadily before him, looking straight into
the trees, but by that deliberate training of his glance he gave
himself away. Trumbo stirred on the saddle and pushed his hands
against the horn. Star Cross had three ropes hanging down from the
trees and Tap rode from rope to rope, forming the knot and the
noose in each, adjusting the length of them as casually as though
he were repairing a fence. The coldness in him was as deep as his
bones, Trumbo thought. Stuart said: "Bring up the horses."</p>

<p>Tap went back for the horses and led them up. He cut an extra
piece of rope, four feet long, and unbraided it and used the single
strands to catch and tie the hands of the Horsehead men. Pairvent
lunged away from him whereupon Stuart lifted his gun. "Be still,
George."</p>

<p>Drum and Baldy had given up, the closeness of death laying its
frost on their nerves. Trumbo, still detached and sharp-eyed,
observed this and wondered if death's forerunning chill always had
the power to freeze the pain of the final passage. He hoped it was
so, for he was a man cursed with an imagination, and his
imagination had often visualized his own end. He hoped for a
dullness just before the stroke came, but he was not sure. It
seemed to depend on the man. Drum and Baldy were only half-alive,
while Pairvent, by contrast, stood straight and hated every soul
around him with that bitterness which had been a constant thing in
him. He was a man stiff on his two feet, with a pride fierce enough
to hold him intact, and he began to taunt Stuart.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you had my guts? Watch me die&mdash;and just
remember you'll never have half the nerve. Your days are about
done. Somebody's going to kill you. Your luck ran out with Doa
Gertrude. The Basin hates the ground you walk on. You got no
friends. You sent your daughter down the river and you're standin'
here now with maggots in your mind. They'll eat you through.
They'll make a pain in you worse than any pain you ever thought of.
I hope the man that shoots you hits you in a spot that will let you
drag on for hours, suffering every second of the time."</p>

<p>Stuart looked back at Pairvent, his eyes reddened by their
broken blood vessels, vainly searching for some way of breaking
this tall Horsehead foreman, of making him bend and cry for mercy.
But he could not think of any device which would pierce Pairvent's
shell. Pairvent was as strong as he was. Pairvent was stronger, for
his glance clashed with Stuart's and his rigid face showed a gray
smile and he put his tongue between his teeth and ejected a flat,
vulgar sound.</p>

<p>"Your insides," he said, "are the insides of a cur dog."</p>

<p>Stuart dropped his glance. The choleric color so characteristic
of the man had not appeared since the scene at the river; his
complexion was a dirty-gray pallor, like the pallor of disease,
constant and startling. He said in the quietest voice he had ever
used: "Get it done. Tap."</p>

<p>Tap called the Star Cross men forward. They boosted Pairvent and
Drum and Baldy to the horses. Tap mounted and rode forward with
them, a black and wicked little man acting as death's chaperone and
liking the job. He dropped the nooses over each man. He cinched the
nooses and coolly tested the ropes. He rode back. He said, "Stand
away." He was still Star Cross foreman, obedient to his owner, and
waited now for Stuart's command.</p>

<p>Hoby Spade was sick. He wheeled his horse and trotted fifty
yards into the trees, whereupon Tap looked at him with a zealot's
intolerance. His glance came slowly back, touched Trumbo and
paused, and Trumbo saw once more that distant and eager hatred grow
bright. Stuart looked at Pairvent.</p>

<p>"This is the end of a crooked outfit. If you're thinkin' the
Basin will condemn me for this, you're wrong. The Basin would do it
sooner or later." His anger whipped him and his basic brutality fed
upon this scene, "I hope," he ground out, "the rope slips. I hope
you strangle a little at a time."</p>

<p>"You can quit talkin'," said Pairvent.</p>

<p>The lines of Stuart's face deepened and all the evil of his soul
filled them; and he thought of one last malign thing and almost
smiled as he thought of it, "Tap," he said, "George goes last. Let
him see the other boys swing."</p>

<p>Tap moved behind Drum. He paused a moment, lifting his quirt,
methodically setting himself; then he put his horse to a run,
struck Drum's horse a hard blow with the quirt as he swept by.
Drum's horse rushed on, dragging Drum from the saddle. His feet
whipped and churned in the air and broken sighs came out of him;
his legs moved more slowly and more slowly, and ceased to move.
Stuart called: "You like that. George?"</p>

<p>Pairvent said nothing. Tap swung behind Baldy, raised his quirt
and ran forward again. Baldy let a last, violent yell out of him as
he was swept from the horse and he struggled with his hands, trying
to free them. His eyes grew large and his terribly congested stare
hit Drew Trumbo. Trumbo clenched his teeth together, feeling
Baldy's agony. Tap went behind Pairvent.</p>

<p>"You like that. George?" repeated Stuart.</p>

<p>Spade called out from the rear, "My God. Stuart, a white man's a
white man! Don't drag it out!"</p>

<p>Tap struck Pairvent's horse. But Pairvent, until now wholly
still, suddenly made a leap upward from his stirrups, kicked
himself violently free and fell with a force that broke his neck at
once. The rope jerked him upward and gave a dull twang and whirled
him a little; but he had died without delay. Stuart stared at
Pairvent's full-length figure as it slowly swung and he spoke a
lifeless phrase. "He beat me out."</p>

<p>Tap rode slowly into the center of the clearing. He had his back
to Trumbo, he was looking at Stuart. Stuart said: "That's three of
them. Now we have got to find Alvy. After that I want Ben Solvay.
As for that Wilder woman. I will make sure she has left the
country."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Tap, still watching Stuart.</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart, "not all. Go ahead, Tap."</p>

<p>Tap used his legs and his left arm to bring his horse about; and
as he turned his right hand dropped for his gun. He came thus face
to face with Trumbo and he had half drawn on Trumbo. That was as
far as he moved. Trumbo, thirty feet across the small clearing, had
his own revolver centered on Tap. He had known for ten minutes that
this would come.</p>

<p>"Too late, Tap," he said.</p>

<p>Tap's face was alive with his desire. He held the gun half-
risen, pointed at the earth; he held it still and waited and
watched. Hoby Spade suddenly ran his horse forward and stopped near
Trumbo. Spade was an outraged man, a common man made brave by
desperation.</p>

<p>"You damned Paiute! Ain't nothin' enough for you?"</p>

<p>"Hoby," said Stuart, reclaiming his old, arrogant manner, "stay
out of this or you will go the same way. I've had to drag you
through this by the heels. As for Drew, I told him to look out for
himself. The two of you have made your own plans. I have made mine.
Stay out of this and go home. You will never get an inch of
Horsehead, either of you."</p>

<p>Spade called to his two riders. "Come here," he said, and waited
until they had joined him. Now he added. "I see how it will be. You
won't feel safe until you've got us out of the road. Trumbo and me
will be dodgin' through timber the rest of our days. Might be well
if we finish this business right here and now."</p>

<p>Stuart said sharply: "Don't be a damned fool, Hoby."</p>

<p>"Drew," said Spade, "you take Tap. I'll handle Stuart."</p>

<p>"Let them start it," said Trumbo. He looked at Stuart briefly:
"Start it. Dan," and he looked back at Tap.</p>

<p>Stuart's red color had returned. He watched Spade steadily,
reading the man and guessing how close he was to a killing. He had
no great opinion of Spade, but his opinion did not sufficiently
strengthen him. Therefore he shrugged his shoulders, turned about
and went to his horse, well knowing Spade would not fire at his
back. He climbed to his horse. He said: "All right," and led the
way from the grove, Star Cross following. Tap was last. Tap
reluctantly holstered his gun, reluctantly gave up his desire. In a
moment Star Cross vanished down the trail.</p>

<p>Spade ran a nervous hand over his face, "That's not the end of
it."</p>

<p>"A thing like this never does end," said Trumbo.</p>

<p>"Then," said Spade, "I think we had better finish the thing.
Stuart will hound us until we're dead. We had better get him
first." He looked at Trumbo, hating him and despising himself. "You
got me into this deal. Drew."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Hoby, play your part. You wanted some of
Horsehead."</p>

<p>"That's true," murmured Spade, "I wanted it. Then when I saw
what it meant, I didn't want it. Now it is entirely too late to
mend anything." He caught the fleeting end of that thought with all
its implications, and burst out: "A man can't ever quit in the
middle."</p>

<p>"I said there never was an end, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"We've got to go after Stuart. That's the end of it."</p>

<p>Trumbo shook his head. He sat on the saddle, a ruddy and
handsome man darkened by his thoughts; a man condemned to know
goodness and right without the strength to follow his knowledge. It
was his tantalizing insight which controlled him now.</p>

<p>"Stuart thinks he can wipe it all from his mind by destroying
the men who know of it. You think you can set everything proper by
destroying Stuart. None of that will help. This thing is like the
seed pod of a thistle, a thousand seeds bein' scattered around.
They'll root and grow everywhere&mdash;mostly in you and me and
Stuart." He drew a heavy breath, "Doa Gertrude will outlive all of
us."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Spade.</p>

<p>Trumbo shook his head and moved to the trail. Star Cross had
gone downhill in the direction of Horsehead Range, the dust of
their passage still hanging in the bright air. He could not go that
way, well knowing that from now on he would be under constant
observation by Stuart; they had set out upon a course of
destruction and had been partly successful. Yet he knew Stuart
could never feel at ease until the last outsider participating in
Doa Gertrude's death had been disposed of. Stuart would track him
without conscience; neither he nor Spade could expect any relief
from that.</p>

<p>Doa Gertrude would follow Stuart still. The time would come
when Stuart, obsessed by it, would look upon his own crew as
accusers; he would see in the eyes of his own men the memory of the
act and then he would turn crazy, and try to destroy them, "No
end," Trumbo thought. "No end at all." He turned south, moving
toward Gateway. As he did so he felt for the first time in his life
two alien sensations: the feeling of being hunted and the feeling
of being alone.</p>

<p>Ben Solvay, camped off the trail near the summit, had been
warned by the two shots, sounding in the north and not far away;
and presently, crouched in the timber, he seemed to be the center
of a good deal of crisscross riding. When that died out he got to
his horse and ducked forward from tree to tree and so eventually
spotted a group of men standing in a glade below him. Thus he was a
witness to the hanging and was helpless to prevent it. Long later,
after everybody had gone, he ventured forward and cut down the
Horsehead men, immediately leaving the area. Back in deep shelter
he considered his own situation and found it bad. Stuart and Trumbo
had wiped out most of Horsehead and no doubt would next be after
Coleman. But since he, too, had thrown in with Horsehead, it looked
as though he were also a fugitive. Valencia had been right; he
could not go back to the Basin as long as Stuart was in it.</p>

<p>He pondered this over a cigarette, very calm and very thorough;
and at last he said to himself: "Why, to hell with them," and rose
up, mentally buckling on his armor. He would find Coleman. He would
join Coleman and help out.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. IN THE GORGE</h2>

<p class="first">COLEMAN dug hard with the oars, making deep, short
chops into the water; he got the stern squared at the white
tumbling river before him, and poised the oars. They swung out of
the chute and scraped past a black-edge boulder and faced the
wilderness of white rollers ahead. The boat dropped stern first
into a short cross trough, was thrown upward and slammed down
again. Long gouts of spray curved aboard and the bottom was awash,
and the thin planking of the boat began to squeal with the twisting
and the straining given it.</p>

<p>The stern whipped aside and slowly swung beam-to. Coleman dipped
his oars and had them almost wrenched from his hands by the sudden
seizure of the current. He tried to backwater with the right oar,
but the river ran here so rapidly that he could not shove fast
enough on that oar to make pressure against the river. He put all
his force into the left oar, feeling it bend. Sometimes he buried
it deep into a roller skimming the top edge of the boat; sometimes
he caught nothing but air as the hollows came beneath him. He got
the stern straight again and rested. Sweat rolled back and forth
under the brim of his hat.</p>

<p>"Ann," he said, not daring to look around, "you're all
right?"</p>

<p>"Still here."</p>

<p>They shot on, rocked and jarred. They swayed through the eddying
turbulence at the lower end of the rapids and were picked up and
shoved forward by a stretch of smooth, fast river. He relaxed and
bowed his shoulders and wished he had time to light a smoke. His
coat was soaked and water sloshed around the boat's floor boards,
high as his ankles. He heard Ann bailing.</p>

<p>He looked at the banks and saw nothing there. To either side the
canyon rims were higher, the canyon faces steeper; down from those
rims, through the hundreds of thousands of years, huge boulder
chunks had fallen, and these boulder chunks were great black teeth
on either side of him, waiting to trap and chew the boat to
splinters. He heard Ann say: "I've got Drew's rope. Can you think
of any use for it?"</p>

<p>The river was a foreign thing to a man who drew his life from
land; a river was an enemy with unknown ways. The thought of the
rope caught his attention at once and he looked at the rocks
running by, calculating the possibility of shunting the boat near
them and laying a loop over one of their sharp points. He made a
guess as to the speed of the boat and his ability to snub it down
and he said, "Pass it forward." He took it from her and laid it at
his feet. It was a long chance, for once ashore they faced the
complete isolation of the canyon, the walls giving them no hope of
climbing out, the water permitting them no way of walking upstream
toward the mine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile as he thought of these things, the small chance faded.
The current rushed them on and the steady vibrating roar of other
rapids grew greater. He said: "What are we coming to?"</p>

<p>"Bridal Veil. Broken water and rocks. A little worse than the
last one."</p>

<p>He said: "How far have we come&mdash;how far on to Gateway?"</p>

<p>She delayed her answer, apparently making a thoughtful study of
it. Over the stern of the boat Coleman saw the river rush downgrade
straight at the base of the left canyon wall, swing from it and
pass around a bend. The main current took them hard by the wall, so
near to it that Coleman's left oar once touched the broken rock. It
swung them around the bend and as they came into the straight
stretch Coleman saw the river tilt and make its steep wild drop
through a whitely jagged surface. Once there had apparently been a
slide, scattering great rock chunks from bank to bank. Around and
over and through these rock chunks, which made darkly awash shapes,
the river broke and whirled and threw up its layers of spray. A
half-mile of water poured over this ancient wreckage, straight on
to another bend. At no place did he see a safe channel.</p>

<p>"We're four miles below the mine," said Ann. "Ten to
Gateway."</p>

<p>"Quick four and a long ten."</p>

<p>She said: "I've watched Bridal Veil many times from the west
rim. There's no main channel through it, but if you can hug the
left-hand shore you won't have as many rocks to dodge. There's a
little piece of beach below."</p>

<p>The current's smoothness broke into short, choppy ridges. He
lowered his oars and pulled the stern square and he checked speed
and side-slipped the boat to the left, and then was thrown at the
shore faster than he had calculated, straight upon the rocks. He
straightened and pulled hard, letting the boat bounce and sway
toward the head of the rapids, toward one black finger against
which the water struck and broke into spray.</p>

<p>"Tracy," she called, "I'll tell you one of old Tam's tricks. He
drifts straight at those big rocks and lets the side current carry
him around."</p>

<p>It was around nine or ten o'clock, the sun somewhere half up in
the sky but not yet reaching to the bottom of Cloud River's narrow
crack; everything down here was a pearl-gray shadowing against
which the water made its white dance. He lifted his oars a moment
and watched the half-drowned boulder leap at him; he dipped and
rowed and checked the stern hard by the rock. He was on the crest
of the water, and then he fell off and the current whipped him by
the rock, around it and into the ehop below; water poured aboard
and the boat dropped as though the bottom of the river had vanished
from it. It struck with a great jar, and immediately afterward
lifted stern foremost high into the air. He had his feet stabbed
against the floor cleats, but the drop and rise flung him forward.
His knuckles, fixed around the oar handles, hit the floor and Ann,
likewise unseated, fell against him. Her hands seized him at the
shoulders and righted him on the seat.</p>

<p>The stern had yawed wide. The left-hand shore was quite near,
all awash to the cliff face; and as he looked up at the cliff face
he saw the dark glitter of spray on it and one small green bunch of
ferns clinging high up. He hauled off from the shore's risk,
pitched around other boulders and watched the stern fall far down,
placing the boat half on its end. Somewhere behind him Ann sat high
and lonely against the sky; he heard her short, startled cry as the
stern struck a rock and swung end for end.</p>

<p>The bow was now downstream, placing Tracy's back to the lower
river and thus ending his control. He could not back water against
the swiftness of the stream. He poised the oars and turned on the
seat and in that moment's glance noticed the white tongues of the
river leaping, "Hang on!" he called.</p>

<p>He drove one oar into the river, holding it; he hauled full
strength on the other and saw the stern slightly answer. He pulled
the boat half about and felt the stream push roughly at it. Ann
sang out: "Close to the shore rocks!" Now broadside to the current,
he shoved hard with the right oar, still pulling with the left. The
boat rose as though a hand had flung it and as it came down its
bottom landed squarely on a rock; there it teetered and slowly slid
off, and when it fell away his right oar's point hit the rock and
flew from the oarlock. The handle sprang up and struck him under
the chin, knocking him back on the seat. He let go to catch
himself, straightened, and watched the oar whirl away in the
water.</p>

<p>The river came through the floor boards in a steady gush; behind
him was the quick clatter of Ann's bailing can. He used his single
oar in a kind of sculling motion to hold the stern down. The roar
which had been a solid booming all around them now was a great
racket to the rear; he saw calmer water beyond and he saw the cliff
face rise straight out of the river, below which one single patch
of gravel beach lay half-touched by the sun. The stern would not
hold to the single oar. It swung and smashed into the cliff, was
caught at the bow by the current and flung around. Ann cried:
"Watch out!" A moment afterwards the boat struck a rock and
capsized.</p>

<p>Ann's warning had turned Coleman. He had reached out and seized
her arm with his hand. The collision threw him free and the water
coldness hit him like a board and he went down lower and lower into
the black depths of the river. He touched bottom. He churned his
legs steadily, he clung to the girl's hand and felt her whirl
against him, and he rose and saw day and took in air&mdash;and went
down again.</p>

<p>He fought the river with one hand; the other hand was fixed to
Ann in a grip that would not relax. He remembered coming up again,
and thought that he must have dropped and risen thus half a dozen
times until images began to flicker and flash through his brain.
Afterwards&mdash;so long afterwards that the day seemed to have
rushed by&mdash;his feet hit solid bottom and he began to walk,
with no knowledge of where he walked. He pulled Ann with him and
saw day and breathed again. Ann fell against him, her eyes closed.
He took her in both arms and pulled her to the beach. She was a
weight that was hard to bear; he let her slide to his feet and then
he dropped to his knees and slowly stretched full length on the
rocks.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
This was the first time in his life he had ever been so punished as
to be thoroughly humbled, the first time he had thus lain and felt
himself at the last frayed ends of his vitality. He wanted only one
thing, air to breathe, and he could not seem to get it. This water,
so soft and yielding and smooth to the eye, had beaten him within a
narrow margin of his life and it had left him as no other accident
had left him&mdash;numbed and passive and powerless immediately to
rise and fight back; he felt a new thing in his body&mdash;the
terrible helplessness of being weak. The river had thoroughly
scoured out of him the will to fight.</p>

<p>He watched Ann slowly stir on the gravel. She had been turned
from him and when her face came around it had a blank expression;
he saw how slowly her thoughts moved through the empty areas of the
last few dizzying moments, filled them, and at last understood what
had happened. He watched the gradual loosening of her face from its
drab and gray preoccupation. Suddenly she reached out her hand and
closed her fingers tightly around his arm. "For a moment. Tracy,"
she said, "I thought I was alone."</p>

<p>"Tough place to be without company."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; and he saw the wake of terror in her eyes. Her
fingers fell away and she put her shoulders on the gravel and
stared at the sky.</p>

<p>The sun was overhead, breaking the rock-dull shadows in the
depths of the gorge. The heat lying between these high walls began
to reach into his marrow-deep chill; he looked at his hands and
noticed that they were pale beneath the summer's tanned blackness,
bleached and bony. Water slid through his clothes and along his
skin and dripped down. The rocks under him grew cold; he moved to a
dryer and warmer patch.</p>

<p>"I think," murmured Ann, "I must have lost consciousness for a
minute. The last thing I felt was your hand. I knew you wouldn't
let go."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I wouldn't let go."</p>

<p>Some warmth came back to him, and some confidence. By the
slowness of its return he knew he had been a long way on the road
to a distant place. He let his mind move cautiously toward the
thought of that place. The door stood a little way open and he had
the feeling that maybe he had been near enough to look through. He
shook the thought aside.</p>

<p>"Tracy," she said, "where's our boat?"</p>

<p>"Haven't looked."</p>

<p>"Have you thought of what's next?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "not yet. Roll over to warmer rocks. Better get
as dry as you can. It will be cold tonight. One thing it is not
necessary to worry about. No way of going back upriver."</p>

<p>"And no way of climbing out."</p>

<p>High above them two stunted pines grew perilously on the lip of
the rim, between five and seven hundred feet distant; between those
pines and the beach on which they lay was a dark-gray wall without
foothold. It came down from the rim in one perpendicular rush, worn
smooth by a million years of the river's assault. Halfway to the
top there was what appeared to be a ledge. He watched it for a long
time, and cast it out of his mind. The wall on the other side of
the river was equally sheer.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "Nothing there for us."</p>

<p>"That's why I wondered about the boat."</p>

<p>"The pieces of it are probably passing Gateway by now."</p>

<p>He sat up. He put his hands down to his wet boots and started to
pull them off; he foresaw a tussle and he wasn't ready for a
tussle. So he rose, feeling the thick and meaty aches in his body.
Somewhere during the last hundred feet of the rapids he had taken a
sharp beating from rocks, although he had felt nothing at the time.
His whole left side hurt him. The rapids lay behind, sunlight
whitening the lacy brilliant leap of the water; and the sound of
the water was a rush and a slash and a steady-echoing roar from
wall to wall. The beach upon which they sat was not more than three
yards wide and ran along the foot of the cliff for two hundred
feet. The downstream end narrowed and pinched out against the
bluff, the upstream end was a curving finger pointed into the
stream, between that finger's end and the cliff was a pool of slack
water in which a dozen or more logs, bleached by water and heat,
lay jammed together.</p>

<p>Coleman said: "There's the boat."</p>

<p>The mention of it was enough to bring hope to her. She came to
her feet, turning. The boat, striking the beach, had swung around
in the current, had been lifted and thrown against the logs. It lay
bottomside-up now on the gravel, one side caved in. "But not much
use to us," he added.</p>

<p>She stared at it. She stood thoroughly motionless, her shoulders
rounded, her features still; and then she turned her head to him
and he saw hollow defeat in her eyes. Knowing her composure and her
normal courage, he realized how violent a shock the sight of that
wrecked boat had been; it shook her will. He moved to her and he
put his arms around her and pulled her against him, her miseries
hurting him as they hurt her. He said, rough and short: "What made
you come with me?"</p>

<p>She lifted her arms and laid them on his sides. She held to him
with the lightest touch. She put her head against his chest, her
hair wetly and brightly shining against the overhead sun. She said
nothing; she held him and looked down.</p>

<p>"I know why you came," he added.</p>

<p>She lifted her head, "Do you?" she asked, and drew away. The
fear had gone and the despair had been pushed back. Even when she
was deeply serious her lips formed a slight upward slanting at
their corners and this, with the usual light in her eyes, made it
appear she was holding back a smile. As he saw it he felt small for
the doubts he carried within himself; this girl was greater than
anything he knew about.</p>

<p>She had turned to look again at the boat. She walked on to the
edge of the pool and she reached down and lifted something and
turned. It was Drew Trumbo's rope. "At least he tried. Tracy."</p>

<p>He took the rope and coiled it and built a loop and slowly shook
it out. This was a familiar thing, a well-understood tool whose
weight was good in his hand; and he looked around, wanting some use
for it. He considered the canyon walls again, yard by yard all the
way to the top, seeking to break its impassable surface by the
power of his wishes. He looked across the river, he swung on his
heels and studied the small gravel bar upon which they stood. Below
them was a long stretch of smooth water, bending at last out of
sight. Down there&mdash;far down&mdash;was the murmur of other
rapids.</p>

<p>"What's ahead? Better or worse?"</p>

<p>"No better. Remember how you climbed upgrade from Gateway, by
the road? That's the way the river drops."</p>

<p>He quit shaking the rope. He let it lie idle in his hand. A rope
was half of a man's needs; a horse made the other half. But in the
canyon there was no use for a horse. What took the place of a horse
here? He swung about, again regarding the boat, "It could be
patched up," he said aloud, "but it wouldn't last long."</p>

<p>He walked into the pool, knee deep, and climbed on the log jam.
He tried his weight on one log and another. "A rope and a horse can
do almost anything," he said. "On the river maybe it is rope and
something that floats. I can roll three or four of these logs into
the slack water and lash them together with the rope."</p>

<p>He was thinking aloud, piecing together a length of rope, a few
logs and a smashed boat&mdash;and making some sort of a chance for
them. He knew it was a small chance, but he was wrapping his
stubbornness around those logs along with the rope. She still felt
the quickness of his hands around her, he had seen her misery and
it had gotten into him and made him reach out to comfort her. Then
she asked herself: "Would he have done that to any woman?"</p>

<p>"But the logs," he said, "would rub the rope apart in about five
minutes. Need something else to stiffen them. That brings us back
to the boat. Take it apart. How many miles do we have to go?"</p>

<p>"The Punch Bowl is just below us. It is six miles on to
Gateway."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it might work. If it doesn't, we can hope we
hit another bar. If we hit another bar, then we can figure out what
else to use."</p>

<p>He sat down and pulled off his boots and drained the water from
them. He put them on and stepped into the water again and waggled
his head at his own folly. "I'm not thinkin' too fast." He hauled
the cracked boat ashore and tore off the broken sides. He used a
rock to splinter the ends of the boards in order to get the nails
free. It wrecked some of the boards, but the nails were more
important than anything else. He made a pile of them on the ground;
he had the boat knocked apart in an hour.</p>

<p>He took a look at the log jam. Some parts of it were too solid
to stir, some gave beneath the pressure of his weight. He went all
around the jam, sizing up the logs; he came ashore and sat down.
Ann dropped beside him and watched him reach for his tobacco. It
came out of his shirt pocket as a handful of brown pulp and when he
looked at it he showed his first real distress, "Hell of a
situation," he said.</p>

<p>"We've been very lucky," Ann told him.</p>

<p>"Written in the book when the luck runs out. I guess we haven't
come to the end of the writin'."</p>

<p>"You just believe that. Tracy. You don't practise it. If you
really felt that everything was arranged for us, regardless of how
we struggled, you'd not be prying those nails out now. You'd not be
fighting. What you really believe is that a man makes his own
luck."</p>

<p>"Maybe the wish to live is the strongest thing of all."</p>

<p>"Not in you."</p>

<p>He looked at her with some doubt, "Nothin' much in me except to
do the first thing at hand and sleep on it."</p>

<p>She smiled, long watching him, so that he saw in her eyes the
shape, the color, the outline of something he could not name, but a
thing that rushed powerfully upon him. This was strange&mdash;to
live with his restless, vague wishes and yet not to know what those
wishes were, and now to see in a woman the first form of them; as
though, long dreaming of a picture and never able to bring it out
of the misty background, he here watched it take shape. It had not
happened before.</p>

<p>"If you only wished to live," she said, "you'd have left this
country before now. If you only slept and never had hopes I would
not have jumped into this boat." She abandoned the subiect quickly,
"Our luck may hold. We may land at Luke Wall's. Then the Basin will
be at us again."</p>

<p>Habit made him reach a second time for his tobacco, "Damnation,"
he grumbled, and got up. "Well, one thing at a time." He waded into
the pool and tackled the logs.</p>

<p>He worked for an hour before he found a log which would come
free of the jam. He pushed it against the gravel and tried again;
and the afternoon was half-gone when he had collected four logs of
odd sizes and lengths in the slaek water. He was tired in a way he
had seldom been, still feeling the shock of the river, and steadily
thinking of the journey ahead of them. Even as he labored he had
not the confidence and the certainty which was always otherwise
with him. His world was one of horses and land and of things done
so many repeated times that the pattern was cut into him. This was
another world, the power and the ways of water beyond his
knowledge.</p>

<p>He laid the boards over the logs at intervals and nailed them
down, using a flat rock for a hammer, thus creating a raft with an
incomplete decking. The nails were not large and went only an inch
into the logs, and he knew the hard beating of the rapids would
pull them out. He laced the rope around and across the logs for
greater strength. He battered a ten-foot length of the rope apart
from the main rope and tied this as a life line around one log.</p>

<p>"You can slip your feet through that," he said.</p>

<p>The canyon was gray when he finished the chore. He pulled the
end of the raft against the shallow gravel and he weighted the end
with rocks to keep it from sliding back into the current; and he
stood awhile watching it. Rope and nails made a flimsy job of it;
nothing would hold it together except luck. Luck had been with them
so far and it might stay with them or it might run out. The hope of
it was all they had.</p>

<p>"We'll run it in the morning," he said. "Getting too dark
now."</p>

<p>She sat down and as he crouched beside her he noticed the calm,
close-seeing attention that went out from her to the sky. Trapped
here, she would be thinking about freedom; cold, she would be
thinking of warmth. Those things lay only a thousand feet away. As
he watched her, he thought of Valencia Wilder. This other girl came
into his head suddenly and stood before his inner vision, calling
to him with her disturbing will. He said to himself: "Why am I
thinkin' of her?" and tried to know the reason. She was nothing
mild or meek; she was not innocence. She was a hungry, rebellious
spirit speaking to him.</p>

<p>Ann spoke with a wistful amusement, "I should be thinking very
serious thoughts. But I think of coffee hot enough to burn my
tongue."</p>

<p>Wind came down the gorge, carrying away the heat; it went
through his damp clothes and turned him cold. Ann would be chilled
through in another hour. He had this in his mind but at the same
time the memory of Valencia was keen and the impulses she lifted up
in him were hard and blackly-colored so that he felt ashamed to be
thinking them so near to Ann. Yet he let those thoughts work
through him, knowing he had to find the roots of his own feelings.
He drew a long breath, he stared into the gathered blackness
down-river. A man was a mixture of things&mdash;and evil was in the
mixture.</p>

<p>Ann's voice laid its soft touch on him. "You are far away."</p>

<p>He rose and walked to the edge of the pool. The raft still hung
there; it had not shifted. He turned back to Ann and stood over
her. He said: "You're getting cold."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be done about that."</p>

<p>He sat down and turned and put his arms around her. He drew her
against his chest; he spread the edges of his coat as far about her
as they would reach. He said nothing; there was nothing he wanted
to say. He wished only to hold her, to make her warm. She lay
still, her head tipped upward and away from him. The warmth of her
body was as great as the warmth of his own; the softness of her
body came against him. The things that had been in his mind so
short a time ago disturbed him and he was afraid that the stark
wants which Valencia's memory had brought to him would reach over
to touch Ann. It was an unpleasant thought; it held him still.</p>

<p>In a moment that fear left him, for the image of Valencia faded
and the call she made upon him died and he felt a contentment
wholly new. There was a difference and a change, like a sweet warm
wind blowing. He thought: "Nothing's been like this."</p>

<p>The canyon grew black and the sound of the rapids pounded
violently through this blackness; a moonlight glow diluted the
sky's steel color and stars made a ragged pathway north and south.
Ann stirred. She turned until he saw her face, round and soft in
the shadows. Suddenly she murmured, "I am heavy on you," and drew
upright. She had her back to him, square-pointed in the night. She
sat in this manner, watching something, or listening, or caught in
her own thoughts. Presently she turned and lay out on the gravel,
half-curled. She said: "A little sleep is better than none.
Tracy."</p>

<p>He stretched beside her, gouging holes in the gravel for his
shoulders and his hips. He turned from her; she put her arm over
his shoulder. Mist began to thicken in the canyon and became a
wetness on the gravel and rolled against them and had the weight of
a fine, thin rain. Long afterwards he heard her say:
"Sleeping?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking. Everything gets smaller and smaller until
there's only one or two things left which are important."</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>She didn't answer and he didn't ask again. An hour of this
cramped position was all a man could stand. He turned about, and
this made her turn about; and so the night dragged and the wet cold
of the rocks got into him and his bones began to ache. Somewhere
beyond midnight, as near as he could judge, he rose and walked the
full length of the gravel beach and back again, shaking the cramp
from his muscles. She had risen and when he came close he saw the
weariness on her face. He sat down and pulled her into his lap; he
held her cradled again and he knew, without understanding how he
came to know it, that she had been silently crying.</p>

<p>"The waitin' is about half-over," he said.</p>

<p>"I thought I was stronger."</p>

<p>"I've seen men give way for less reason."</p>

<p>"I wasn't afraid until you walked off. Being alone is what turns
you inside out. I should do it better&mdash;I've always been
alone."</p>

<p>"You've had your people."</p>

<p>"People have been around me and I have been around people. It
isn't that kind of loneliness I mean."</p>

<p>"Everybody has to belong to somebody else."</p>

<p>"When did you learn that?"</p>

<p>He started to say, "A long time ago," but he didn't. For it
occurred to him he would not have said this before. It was a new
piece of wisdom, acquired during the last hours. A man grew, and
never realized it; and a man died and was not aware of it. This was
a law in the big book. "Not long," he said.</p>

<p>She turned from him. He put his arms around her and drew close,
to share with her the little heat left in them both.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He rose at the first break of light overhead. There had been no
sleep for either of them, nor anything else than an uneasy resting
that brought no rest. During the last small hours of the night he
had risen with an actual shock, remembering the raft in the shallow
water and remembering the river that reached for it with never
still fingers. The river never left anything alone; it needed no
sleep or rest, it was a power older than any living or moving thing
upon the earth.</p>

<p>Ann rose with him and they walked the gravel bar in chilled
silence, back and forth to whip the drugged weariness from them, to
bring some warmth back and some vitality. The night before they had
felt relief at being permitted to live; but now they were close
again to the chance of the river and the sound and smell of it and
the dank feeling of it.</p>

<p>Coleman said: "Six miles to go. How many rapids?"</p>

<p>"White water most of the way. The river drops fast from here to
Luke Wall's."</p>

<p>"Any falls to go over?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He stood at the water's edge, considering the flimsiness of the
raft, and he went over every resource within his reach and found no
other way by which to make the raft better. Then, painfully
careful, he searched the rims again with his glance, watching their
black faces turn gray. Near the water a heavy dew laid its dull
shine on the rocks; farther up daylight reached down so that he saw
again the narrow ledge near the top of the eastern edge. He had
abandoned this as a possibility the prior afternoon. Now he studied
it, lowering his attention foot by foot, searching for a way of
climbing; but as before he found none. He went over every
possibility and thought of one new chance.</p>

<p>"Your father would make an attempt to get you," he said, "He
might call in Tam Malarkey. If they could find another boat they
might snub it downstream by rope, around one bluff and another.
Hand-line the rapids."</p>

<p>"There's no other boat on the river."</p>

<p>"Might make up a raft from the boards at the mine dump."</p>

<p>"If they had thought of that they would have sent someone along
the rim to find us and signal us. They said good-by to us when we
dropped around the bend. We're dead to them."</p>

<p>Day had come, mealy within the canyon, bright-blue above.
Coleman stepped on the raft; he walked over it, trying his weight
on it. He cast off the stones anchoring it down and held out his
hand to Ann. "Time to go."</p>

<p>She walked to it and she looked back with a disturbed glance at
the gravel bar. She controlled her fear, but the shadow of it
showed. She didn't want him to see it, and held her face away from
him. But that sudden look she gave the gravel bar hit him in the
heart.</p>

<p>"I know," he said, "This was good&mdash;but it isn't good any
more."</p>

<p>"Most things are like that. We hang on, but we have to let
go."</p>

<p>"Not everything," he said, "Lie down and hook your feet through
the rope."</p>

<p>He needed an oar and had none; he needed a pole. He walked along
the log jam but found nothing suitable, and so came back to the
raft. He pushed the raft through the slack water and slowly around
the curved finger of the sandbar. The current gave the raft one
powerful blow, dragging Coleman deeper into the river. He was waist
high before he pulled himself aboard. He crawled forward until he
was beside Ann; he put his arms around one of the crossboards and
jammed his feet against another crossboard. The smooth, swift water
at the foot of the rapids began to turn the raft and to rush it
forward.</p>

<p>"What stays the same, Tracy?"</p>

<p>The raft continued its clockwise turning all down the straight
stretch of smooth water. The bluffs were sheer to either side,
forming a long bend. In a little while, looking back, he saw that
the gravel bar had dropped from sight; ahead of them was a growing
grumble. He sat up, looking sharply downhill upon ragged layers of
white and green flung up from the river's surface. The warning of
that roughness began to reach them, the smooth current breaking
into a chop which slapped aboard and laid its wetness upon them. He
looked at the boards of the raft, watching them play and buckle as
the logs shifted. He looked at the ropes.</p>

<p>Ann said: "I can understand now the queer way Luke Wall
talks."</p>

<p>"You'll see him in a half hour," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she murmured, "if he'll welcome us. He won't be the
only survivor any more. He's proud of that."</p>

<p>"Hold fast," said Coleman. He flattened and gripped the
crossboards. The river shoved them along faster and the water ahead
rolled up before them in high, broken curlers.</p>

<p>The raft was at this moment running nose first; it lifted but it
was too heavy and too slow to ride the crest of the curlers; it
dove into them. Water rolled over the raft and these two people and
weighted them down. Coleman flung one arm around Ann, hauling her
tightly against him. The raft came up with a sluggish heave and the
water poured away; the river was a steady thunder between the walls
of a narrower gorge and for a moment, with the raft slowly tilting
and falling downward, he saw the trough in which they traveled and
the ragged white peaks of water flashing to either side. The raft
sank a second time. Once more under water, he caught the dead
cannonade of the gorge and he felt the water tear at the raft and
fling it around. When they again rose they were faced upstream. The
raft's bottom struck hard and was thrown aside and a board cracked
like a pistol shot, quite near Coleman's head. Afterwards the logs
seemed to have a looser play.</p>

<p>They had gotten through one bad patch; he turned his head and
saw it recede behind him&mdash;and looked forward and viewed the
onward explosions of spray and the teeth of black rocks bare above
the surface. The raft was steadily swinging. It struck one end and
hung against the force of the river and for a while the pressure of
the current began to drive it down and drown it. Water threw Ann at
Coleman; it strained against him and wrenched one of his legs away
from the cleat. The raft shivered and he thought it ready to break
apart. Then the river boiled up, shook the raft free and hurled it
on.</p>

<p>They plunged in wheeling, drunken lunges through the wildest
stretch of the river. The raft's nose dipped and lodged and the
back end rose until Coleman slid forward; it broke free and great
layers of water rushed over it. Coleman tightened his grip around
Ann. He braced his feet and felt the weariness of his straining go
through him, softening his flesh. He had no clear idea of the time
they had been running the river; the constant turning and the
steady shock of dropping and being thrown up had dizzied him. He
had only two fixed impressions&mdash;the nearness of Ann to him and
the increasing looseness of the logs beneath. Some of the
crossboards had worked free. He felt them slide beneath him, and he
felt the playing of the board to which his hands clung. One hard
jar would tear them all loose, after which nothing held the logs
but the rope.</p>

<p>The raft ran momentarily in free water and he looked above him
and saw the rims and thought they were lower than they had been.
Light strengthened in the canyon; when he looked ahead he saw one
streak of sunlight, "Ann," he said, "Ann."</p>

<p>The roar was stronger than the sound of her voice. He heard
nothing from her; and after that he could not speak again. For the
raft struck hard, slowly slid away and fell with a jar that knocked
the wind from him. One of his feet slipped from the crossboard and
his left leg dropped between logs and he felt a streak of pain as
the logs slammed together. He yelled into the water's thunder and
he saw the girl's face turn to him, white and solemn. He dragged
his leg free and propped it against the crossboard at the same
moment the river poured over them.</p>

<p>He was tired enough then to think the dull, fatal thoughts of
surrender; he held his breath until his lungs, long punished, began
to burn and his heart was a slugging sound in his ears. The raft
came up and water boiled away. He breathed and found the air thin
and insufficient. The crossboard at his feet had gone and he found
himself straddling one log. He called to Ann: "Don't let your legs
slip down!"</p>

<p>She said: "What?" He shook his head, sucking in wind. Strong
light played on his eyes and water dripped into them so that he
could not see. He felt the raft rock and run into easier water and
he thought: "Smooth patch before the next rapids." He relaxed a
little and then he stiffened himself, waiting for the rough water
to seize them. But they ran on through smoothness, and through a
strange quietness, and the raft grated against gravel and stopped.
He heard a voice say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll both live forever. Let go the rope, Miss Stuart. Let go
and I'll lift you."</p>

<p>There was a little current lifting and rocking the logs, nothing
more. Coleman cautiously released his grip on the cross slat and
rubbed the water out of his eyes. He opened them and saw Luke Wall
standing hip deep in the stream. Ann Stuart in his arms. Luke Wall
gave him a close, thoughtful smile, "You see?" said Luke, "You see
what I been through? Just the three of us know. Ain't a thing you
can ever explain to anybody. Come off the raft before it breaks up
and floats away&mdash;which it will do in a minute. A drink of
whisky and a meal will fix it right. I heard yesterday you had
started down the river. I been here sixteen hours, waitin' to haul
you out and bury you."</p>

<p>Coleman said: "What time is it?"</p>

<p>Wall looked at him and laughed, "Now ain't it funny what a man
will think of? You know what I asked when they fished me out? I
wanted to know if it had been rainin'. It is six o'clock in the
mornin'&mdash;but what is time to you now? Never will mean the same
again. You got all the time there is."</p>

<p>"Stuart here, or any of Star Cross, or Drew Trumbo?"</p>

<p>"Trumbo rode through here last night. Nobody else."</p>

<p>"They'll come," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"You'll be inside my house if they do," said Luke Wall, "And I
am with you, son."</p>

<p>Another voice, a woman's voice, called from the bank. "Are you
hurt. Tracy?" Looking up from the raft he saw Valencia standing at
the edge of the bluff.</p>

<p>It seemed strange to him that she had gone out of his mind until
this moment; now she was before him and he looked at her a long
while, waiting for that hot, hard feeling to come back. Luke Wall
had started up the bank. Suddenly Ann said: "Put me down. Luke."
Luke Wall set her upon her feet and she walked slowly up the grade
of the bank to its top, passing Valencia without looking at the
girl.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>16. AT LUKE WALL'S MEADOW</h2>

<p class="first">RETURNING from the bitter business in the
mountains, Stuart passed through Horsehead during the early-
morning hours and headed for the river crossing. "Tap," he said,
"you move to Horsehead with a couple of the crew tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Drew Trumbo will be smellin' around the place."</p>

<p>Stuart let out a grating retort, "Trumbo will be hidin' in the
hills with the fear of God in his heart. I am not concerned with
him. Horsehead is part of our grass, and I am taking
possession."</p>

<p>Tap said nothing, but his silence held dissent, causing Stuart
to add a biting opinion. "Everybody in the Basin wanted Horsehead
to be cleared off, but nobody had guts to go about it. I did the
dirty chore. Now they'll want to share it. They'll get
nothing&mdash;not one damned spear of grass. It is mine."</p>

<p>The storm signals were up in Stuart; they showed in the down-
angled lines of his mouth corners, in the spotted flush on his
face, in the jumpiness of his voice and in the stony way he stared
before him. When that temper came upon the Star Cross owner there
was nothing to do but be still, and Tap wisely did so. Still,
certain unfinished pieces of this morning's business displeased him
and when they reached the Star Cross yard he ventured to repeat his
warning: "Trumbo will be smellin' around."</p>

<p>Stuart had a quick breakfast and went to his room to lie out on
the bed. There were a good many things on his mind; one of them was
the dully unpleasant knowledge that he was no longer young. The
night's riding and the night's cold damp in the hills had taken the
starch out of him; he felt the heaviness of his bones, he felt a
gnawing exhaustion. He turned constantly on the bed and his heart
made its heavy labor in his chest. Light came through the window
and struck his eyes; he wanted to rise and pull down the shade, but
felt too tired to do so, and laid a hand over his face.</p>

<p>The heavy crop of his years was in the threshing. His range
stretched far out on the other side of Horsehead Crossing as he
wished it and Pairvent and all those men were finished; but his
daughter was dead and the Basin hated him and would never again
accept him. He would drink alone and eat alone in town. The
miserable business of Doa Gertrude had done that. These things
went back and forth through his mind&mdash;the good and the bad,
one upon another. Lying there, sleepless and exhausted, he reached
out to possess the feeling of triumph he should have. It ran ahead
of him, beyond his reach.</p>

<p>He raised to an elbow, intending to call to the cook to bring
him a glass of water; but pride stilled the call. He looked through
the open doorway at the room which was Ann's. He stared at the
dresser within his line of vision, at the silver-plated jewel box
on it, at the brush and comb, at her mother's picture. Both of
those women had hated him, the hands of both had been raised
against him. He had tried to smash that resistance down but there
was a strange thing in women which could not be beaten&mdash;a
shadow, a look, a feeling nothing could erase.</p>

<p>"I should have turned them both out years ago. But they stuck,
and they've got the last word at last. They can both stand wherever
they are and make me feel like it was my fault. Women are clever
like that&mdash;mean and tricky and full of deceit when they
smile." As for Ann, she had deliberately stepped into Coleman's
boat. That was her doing; the decision was hers.</p>

<p>He absolved himself of her death, yet the misery of her act took
possession of him. Except for the accident of Luke Wall, no human
being had ever survived the river. She knew that and yet she had
gone with the man, her body protecting him from the guns on shore.
He lay long still, puzzling over it, and the gray ghosts of another
philosophy moved vaguely before his mind, to increase his doubt. At
last he fell into troubled sleep.</p>

<p>He awoke beyond noon with a dry throat and a numb weariness all
through him. He rose with difficulty and sat on the bed's edge with
his head in his hands, everything inside him burned out. But the
terrible march of things kept on in his head. He thought of the
other owners on the range, of Gunderson and Bill Yell and Frank
DeLeon who had cut him in town. He owed none of these men anything
and he needed nothing from them; men came to him, not the other way
around. And still his growing isolation troubled him and he
thought: "Maybe I just imagined it." The thing to do was to ride to
town and try again.</p>

<p>He washed his face, ate a cold dinner and struck out for War
Bonnet, reaching there around four. He entered the saloon and
stepped to the bar for his drink. Snass Moran pushed bottle and
glass at him. He waited for Moran to speak, his own pride insisting
that the other man make the first move, but Moran walked away,
running his towel casually along the bar. Doc Fallon sat at a
near-by table reading an old copy of <i>Harper's Weekly</i>. Doc
Fallon didn't look up.</p>

<p>Stuart stared at the bottle, which was half-full; when he next
thought to look, it was empty. He had no idea of how long he had
been standing at the bar, neither speaking nor being spoken to, but
when he turned away he noticed a lamp burning near the door. He
walked into the warm twilight and got on his horse, making three
tries before reaching the saddle. He drew a long breath, found his
reins and started from town. He thought he saw Jack O'Boyle on the
walk. He said, "Hello, Jack." and didn't hear an answer. If he had
been sober he would have stopped and called O'Boyle to account at
once. But he knew he was drunk and he wasn't sure it was
O'Boyle.</p>

<p>Somewhere out on the prairie Tap caught up with him and led him
home. The last thing he heard Tap say was: "Don't be too sure about
Trumbo. You got to put him out of the way."</p>

<p>That was a planted seed which grew while he slept; when he woke
the next morning it was a rooted purpose. He rose feeling fresh and
hale again, "Big drunk is good for a man once in a while," he
thought and ate a tremendous breakfast. He moved to the front room
for his belt and gun and for a moment he paused at Ann's bedroom
doorway. He went into the room and stood at her dresser. He
remembered how close to red her hair had been and as he looked into
the mirror above the dresser her face came before him with a
realness that shocked him. It was so still at the moment that he
felt her presence in the room. Suddenly he swept his hand across
the dresser, caught up the brush and comb, the picture and the
jewel box and carried them to the kitchen. He said to the cook:
"Open the stove lid," and threw everything into the fire. The cook
wheeled and put his back to Stuart.</p>

<p>Stuart walked from the house and called to Tap, "Get Niles Peck
and come with me." The three men saddled and set out toward the
hills westward.</p>

<p>Tap said: "If you're goin' to Trumbo's it would be better to
circle south. He's apt to be watchin' us&mdash;he'll see us across
the flat."</p>

<p>Stuart's brief flush of good feeling had soon worn out; and now
he was in the worst possible humor, "Tap," he said, "you talk too
much about the man. He got you buffaloed?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Tap with a breathlessness which revealed how
badly the remark hit him.</p>

<p>The thought of his aloneness rode with Stuart. It haunted him,
it grew as a fed fire, it unsteadied his mind. He had been cut by
his neighbors, he who had the power to crush them individually.
They looked at him across the distance of the Alma's dining room
and the thing in their eyes went through him and turned like a
knife. Because of that he had to strike back to restore his own
pride, and the first man in his mind was Drew Trumbo.</p>

<p>They came to the ridge and bore southward through the trees
until they reached the slope which fell toward Trumbo's house; and
at this point the tumult in Stuart caused him to make a foolish
move, "Tap," he said, "take Niles and circle Trumbo's. I'll come up
from the back way."</p>

<p>Tap stared at him, trying to fathom the reason for doing so
unnecessary a thing. He said quietly: "We're not surroundin' a
camp, Mr. Stuart. It is just one man we want."</p>

<p>"Don't argue!" cried Stuart, "If you're workin' for Star Cross,
do as I say."</p>

<p>Tap sighed and his thin face grew thinner from the strain of the
insult. He spoke very quietly: "Star Cross is all I have got to
live for, Mr. Stuart. You ought to know that."</p>

<p>"Go on, go on!" yelled Stuart.</p>

<p>"Just so," murmured Tap and rode on through the trees with Niles
Peck.</p>

<p>The rashness grew. It was a poison irritating Stuart's nerves
until they vibrated within him. He turned to the west, traveling a
half-overgrown trail along the ridge, and came to the main road
from Gateway. This he followed until he had gotten within a mile of
Trumbo's place. Here he left the road and entered the trees. He had
not gone fifty yards when a voice said coolly from some hidden spot
before him:&mdash;"Now wait."</p>

<p>His horse heard the unexpected noise, and the horse stopped
before Stuart thought of checking him. Stuart turned to stone in
the saddle. He lifted his reins, ready to charge, and he swept the
timber before him and saw nothing. The voice was
Trumbo's&mdash;easy and insolent&mdash;but he could not find
Trumbo.</p>

<p>"Come out," Stuart said, "come out and show yourself. You're big
enough to face a man without hidin' in the bushes, ain't you?"</p>

<p>Trumbo said: "Your eyes are bad. Dan. Look this way."</p>

<p>He was on Stuart's sight flank, standing quietly beside a pine,
his clothes blended with the gray-brown bark. He had a shoulder
point against the tree and he gave Stuart a starved, bright smile,
"Your mistake was in strayin' off from Tap and Niles."</p>

<p>"You been followin' us?"</p>

<p>"Had my eyes on you since you left the Star Cross yard."</p>

<p>"Like a damned Injun prowler. White men don't prowl."</p>

<p>Trumbo's narrowed smile was tight against his teeth. "Now, now,
Dan. We know each other too well for that kind of hogwash. You are
after me. I am after you. That is all there's to it."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Stuart and slowly turned his horse's head on to
Trumbo. He had not been too sure of Trumbo's motive; he was not
entirely sure yet. But he saw very clearly the heartlessness of
Trumbo's smile and he saw the mockery and the malice in Trumbo's
eyes.</p>

<p>"You made a bad mistake," said Trumbo, "There never was a time
when we trusted each other. But that was all right. Each man's
entitled to watch his own cards. We could have gotten along. Your
mistake was tryin' to turn on me and leave me dead with the
Horsehead bunch. It was a pretty raw thing."</p>

<p>Stuart said: "You would have done it to me."</p>

<p>"Maybe. Still, there's a difference. I would have done the job.
I would not have bungled it and left an enemy behind me. That was
your mistake. I won't bungle it, Dan."</p>

<p>Stuart remembered that Tap and Peck were not far off. They would
be at Trumbo's house now and they would wait a decent interval and
then maybe start back to find him. He eased himself on the saddle
slightly, made steady by his danger, "Drew," he said, "Hoby Spade
is a weak sister, ready to tell the Basin what he knows. He'll
crucify the both of us."</p>

<p>"I can manage that later," said Trumbo. "One thing at a
time."</p>

<p>"If you're thinkin' of knockin' me out of the saddle, consider
what happens next. Tap will hunt you like a dog, the crew with him.
You'll run before him, which will be the end of you in the
Basin."</p>

<p>"Maybe," agreed Trumbo and seemed to be impressed with the
argument.</p>

<p>"I will make you this deal," said Stuart. "I will drive Spade
out of the country. You take his range. I will add a piece from my
old range. There's a big outfit you been wantin'."</p>

<p>"That's what I want," said Trumbo.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Stuart, "it should be a deal."</p>

<p>He saw the frigid grin lengthen. "Like the last deal, Dan?"
asked Trumbo.</p>

<p>"My word on it," said Stuart.</p>

<p>Trumbo stared at Stuart with the anger of a smart man who had
been misjudged. "You damned old fool, do you think I can believe
your word?" He came out from the tree, tall and poised, and he
watched Stuart so steadily that the older man grunted a gruff
question.</p>

<p>"What the hell's in your mind now?"</p>

<p>"I was thinkin'," said Trumbo, "how you tried to break Pairvent
and make him crawl. You're the Indian, not me. I was thinkin' if I
could string this out and make you die by inches. But it is not in
me to kill a man for plain fun." He shrugged his shoulders, said
conversationally, "Something to my credit, maybe," and drew and
fired before Stuart was able to stir.</p>

<p>The older man gasped when the bullet hit him. He showed vague
surprise and he dipped his head and he started to place a hand over
his chest; before he completed the motion he rolled from the
saddle, struck on his shoulder and sprawled face up in the shadowed
dust. His hat rolled away and his face showed its red veins and its
lines of age and unlovely character through a slow- growing pallor.
Trumbo stepped forward to witness this, impersonal and without
regret; this whole thing left him without any feeling and he
recognized that fact and shook his head. "I'm goin' back to the
kind of a man I was before," he thought. "Or else I was always the
same man, just foolin' myself I could be better."</p>

<p>He turned to the trees for his horse and got to the saddle; he
listened into the late summer's stillness, not yet hearing the
approach of Tap or Niles Peck. They would catch the echo of the
shot and they would come. Maybe it would be best to stay here and
finish up with those two. He debated the idea and rejected it. The
better thing was to maneuver around and catch one man at a time,
when the chance came. One man at a time until he had settled the
argument for good. Horsehead was within his reach now if he did all
this carefully. He cut across the road and paralleled it, moving
south through timber.</p>

<p>Tap and Niles Peck got back to Stuart half an hour later and Tap
sprang from his saddle and ran awkwardly forward, calling, "Mr.
Stuart, Mr. Stuart!" Seated on his saddle, Niles Peck watched Tap
crouch over the Star Cross owner and sway at the shoulders;
presently Tap turned and Peck saw tears in the foreman's eyes.</p>

<p>"Dead?"</p>

<p>"He never drew his gun," said Tap drearily, "Trumbo did that.
Trumbo never gave him a chance."</p>

<p>"Well," said Niles Peck, unmoved by it, "you told Stuart not to
go it alone."</p>

<p>"He was powerful excited and he wouldn't listen."</p>

<p>"Never listened to nothin' anyhow," commented Peck. "Let's start
home."</p>

<p>Tap thrust a hostile stare at Niles Peck. "You take it damned
easy."</p>

<p>"I will not cry for the man. He didn't give a damn for any
livin' soul&mdash;not even his daughter."</p>

<p>"She didn't know him," said Tap. "What's any woman know about a
man? She had her heart set against him. I didn't like her
either."</p>

<p>"You do your grievin'," said Peck. "I'm goin' back to the ranch,
get my blanket and keep on movin'. You know what's goin' to happen
to Star Cross now? Same thing that happened to Horsehead. Nobody
loved Star Cross at all. Everybody hated the ground Stuart walked
on. Then there was that Doa Gertrude business. I can smell it all
over the Basin. If I rode into War Bonnet they'd point at me and
say: 'There's one of the men that killed Doa Gertrude.' How long
you think we're goin' to be let alone? I'm leavin' now."</p>

<p>Tap growled: "I ought to kill you for talkin' like that about
Star Cross."</p>

<p>Niles Peck was a man with a record of his own; he gave Tap a
stiff look. "I ain't fightin' a dead man's battle and I know when a
deal is dead."</p>

<p>Tap said: "Get out of my sight. Don't let me see you again."</p>

<p>"You won't," said Peck. "Nor any of the crew. When I reaeh home
with the news we'll all be on the road."</p>

<p>He made a gradual turn around Tap in order to keep his right
flank to the foreman, and so faded in the timber. Tap swung, again
toward Stuart, and he grew still and this stillness was upon him
for a quarter hour and tears ran down his cheeks and his face was
the face of a lost man; for Star Cross was his life and Stuart was
Star Cross, and all that was now destroyed.</p>

<p>He drew Stuart's coat together, and rose. He said aloud: "I will
be back to take care of you, Mr. Stuart. But I got to even this
thing first." He went to his horse, climbed to the saddle and
picked up Trumbo's tracks in the soft carpet of the forest; he
followed them to where they reached and crossed the main road, and
he continued with them.</p>

<p>Two miles or more from Stuart's location, the tracks curved back
to the main road and went downgrade through the road's dust. Tap
bridled at the thought of Trumbo's brazen assurance and he said to
himself: "I will watch him kick and I will watch him yell and I
will spit in his face just before he dies!" His lips moved in
relish of the thought; he dropped his head to study the pattern of
Trumbo's tracks before him. The road at this point came near the
rim of the canyon, so near that it reached the very margin of the
great, long fall to the river, and made a quick bend away. A
careful man in every respect, Tap looked behind him as he started
around the bend to be sure he was not being followed; and
thereafter looked ahead&mdash;and saw one rider come slowly into
sight below.</p>

<p>The rider likewise had his head down and so was not aware of
Tap; and the rider was Ben Solvay. Tap pulled in his horse and he
held himself quiet, watching Solvay daydream forward. Between them
lay two hundred yards of gray road dust glittering in the strong
sunlight, so deep and soft that the sound of Solvay's traveling
horse sank into it and died. Tap remembered one thing: Solvay had
been with Horsehead; and even though the distanee was too great for
a good shot, his jealous loyalty sent his hand down to the gun.</p>

<p>The shout of the bullet was a first warning of Tap's presence to
the idle-riding Solvay. He yanked up his head so quickly that his
hat fell off, and for an instant he stared at Tap, pulling his mind
back to the present moment from the far place it had been. There
was a startled break of feeling on his face and then as he grasped
the situation he whirled his horse into the trees. Tap's second
bullet followed him.</p>

<p>Tap flung his horse around and likewise ran for the trees.
Reaching this shelter he started in Solvay's direction. He heard
Solvay's horse whip through the pine branches and he had one
fugitive view of the man, low-bent, rushing deeper away. He tried a
third shot and was disgusted with himself; he changed direction to
meet Solvay's slanting course&mdash;and suddenly he lost the sound
of the horse.</p>

<p>He listened for it as he smashed into the timber; he went a
hundred feet or more before his caution stopped him. He heard the
blowing of his own horse and, bent forward in his stirrups, he
thought he caught the rasp of Solvay's mount.</p>

<p>The sound came out of the forward left. Solvay, he decided, was
over there playing 'possum. Thinking it, he rode straight on.</p>

<p>A bullet harked through the timber and smashed his arm, driving
it up toward his face. This was his right arm. He stopped the horse
and looked around him, toward his right, and found Solvay standing
no more than twenty feet away. Solvay had tricked him, had left his
horse in the thieket and had run back. Solvay said: "So long. Tap,"
and fired again. His aim was spoiled by Tap's side swing in the
saddle, so that the bullet caught Tap high on the shoulder and
keeled him against the saddle's horn. Tap fought himself upright,
making no sound. He tried to reach over with his left hand to seize
the gun hanging uselessly in his right fist. He did all this with a
bitter, careful courage, never for a moment weakening in his hate
or his single-minded intent. He tried and failed. Solvay's next
shot hit him close to the heart.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
There were these four around the table at the Gateway stage
station&mdash;Luke Wall, Valencia, Ann and Tracy Coleman. Luke Wall
said: "You need sleep. I remember that I came out of that water and
never had my fill of bed for a week. Have no worry about it,
Coleman. No enemy of yours will cross this doorsill whilst you're
here. Just tell me one thing. Who are your enemies?"</p>

<p>"My father and my father's outfit," answered Ann, who had said
almost nothing until now.</p>

<p>"I knew that already," said Luke Wall, "And who else?"</p>

<p>"Drew Trumbo," added Valencia.</p>

<p>"And I knew that, too. I just wanted to be sure. None of those
will pass this door." He was a huge, flabby man with the face of an
oriental god; and his half-hidden eyes made their bland search of
these people. "The out-bound stage will be comin' down the hill in
half an hour." He looked at Coleman. "If it is your intention to
leave the country&mdash;" He let it ride and he sat gross and
wholly comfortable in the chair.</p>

<p>Ann laid a quick glance on Coleman and brought it away. It was
Valencia who continued to watch this man, Luke Wall observed, and
as she watched him she betrayed herself.</p>

<p>"I'll go back to the Basin," said Coleman. He rose, clapping a
hand to his tobacco pocket. He swung on Wall. "Give me something to
smoke."</p>

<p>Luke handed him paper and sack and followed him out of the
house. The two stood in the yard, under the strong sunshine, and
now and then their voices came murmuring back. Ann put her hands on
the table, her attention falling to them. Suddenly she lifted her
eyes and found Valencia Wilder watching. The girl's anxiety and
urgent wonder tumbled out of her.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to be with him?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to be," said Ann.</p>

<p>She read the tempest running through Valencia Wilder; the girl's
hot spirit was roused, she was again fighting the world for what
she wanted&mdash;the world from which she had never known kindness.
"Does he want you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You should know when a man wants you. I would know."</p>

<p>"Does he?" asked Ann.</p>

<p>Valencia sighed. "I was not with him long enough," she
murmured.</p>

<p>"You were in the Horsehead house with him," pointed out Ann,
civil and distant, "You were near him. You made him aware of that,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I made him see me," said Valencia and was pleased by knowing
how that remark would hurt Ann. Then she added in a less lively
tone: "I made him want me, which any woman can do to any man. I do
not know if it is more than that." She looked long at Ann,
unfriendly and yet reluctantly honest. "Want and love are not
always the same."</p>

<p>Ann rose from the table. She started toward the stairs. On the
first step she paused to look back. "You can try again,
perhaps&mdash;and perhaps find out," she murmured and went up the
stairs.</p>

<p>Valencia feared and hated the other's composure, "She's cold,"
Valencia thought, but that was only a reflex of her dislike; her
realist's mind knew better. She rose from the table as Wall and
Coleman came into the room. Wall went on into the kitchen, closing
the door behind him. His heavy tread died away. Valencia turned and
stepped to the fireplace, holding her back to Coleman, waiting for
him to speak. She cried out silently to herself, "Let him come
here, let him touch me!" She waited until she knew he wouldn't come
to her; and then turned.</p>

<p>He had his eyes on her, he was thinking of her, and he seemed
deliberately to be letting all of her into him. He wore a troubled
expression, as though he struggled with himself; and thus he stood,
a man caught in the contradictions of his own nature,
heavy-whiskered and with the punishment of the river showing in
him. He was very tired and his clothes were wet and the knuckles of
his hands blood-raw.</p>

<p>She stepped toward him and she thought of him in the unashamed
physical way of a woman who wants a man with all her heart. She
hoped he would see it, she hoped it would sway him, she hoped he
would seize her and end the growing agony of waiting. She never
knew what changed him or when the change happened but when he
looked down at the floor everything was over and she had lost. The
light went out of the room and she stood heavy and helpless before
him.</p>

<p>"I thought," he said quietly, "you might have taken the stage
out."</p>

<p>"I couldn't go until I found out what had happened to you."</p>

<p>"Will you be goin' now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He said: "Solvay thinks a great deal of you."</p>

<p>She remembered Solvay for the first time this day. "Did he go
back to you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see him."</p>

<p>She said: "I sent him back, Tracy."</p>

<p>"He'll be somewhere in the hills. He's a good man."</p>

<p>She said: "I'll take the stage."</p>

<p>"That's goin' to be tough on him."</p>

<p>"People have to break their hearts once in a lifetime, Tracy."
She thought steadily of Coleman, even as she tried to think of
Solvay. "It will hurt him less to have me go than for me to marry
him."</p>

<p>"I would not be surprised if he followed you."</p>

<p>The thought pleased her. "If he wishes me that much&mdash;" But
she soberly put it aside, "If you see him and if he intends to
follow me, try to stop him. He'd never be happy. Nor would I. He
would remind me of too much."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a kindness that hurt her terribly. Wanting
so much from him, she had only this. He said: "I wish you a better
deal. Valencia."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "I'll make my way."</p>

<p>He turned back to the yard, walking slowly beneath the sunshine.
He stopped at the corral and laid his shoulders against it. He
smoked out his cigarette and rolled four extra ones and laid them
carefully on the top bar of the corral; he felt the sun go into
him, he felt the water drip down along his body. He began to thaw
and grow warm and as he grew warm his bruises increasingly ached;
he shifted all weight from his bad leg.</p>

<p>Valencia was on his mind still but he saw her differently now
and he was at peace with himself. Coming into the stage house he
had faced her and he had deliberately let all the temptation and
all the sweetness that she had make its way through him; he wanted
to know about the dark, wayward side in him; he wanted to know if
the unspoken offers of a woman could so ride and control him as to
destroy the other things he felt. He had to know; and he knew
now.</p>

<p>The echoes of a rider came down the narrow gorge of the trail.
Coleman turned and reached to the top corral bar for a fresh
cigarette. He placed the cigarette in his mouth and swung
back&mdash;to see Drew Trumbo stopped at the mouth of the road,
watching him across the width of the yard.</p>

<p>Trumbo had stopped. He sat still and was in hard, deep thought
as he looked upon Coleman, and presently shook his head and got off
the horse and moved forward, steadily and flat of foot. Coleman
watched him come; he had the unlighted cigarette in his mouth. It
sagged from the corner of his lip and his eyelids came close
together and made pucker lines at the edges, as though actual smoke
curled around his eyes. He was half-turned and his head bent
somewhat aside, so that he watched Trumbo from a slanted
position.</p>

<p>His range of vision ran beyond Trumbo, straight at the house.
Luke Wall and Valencia were blurred figures against the wall and he
saw Ann looking from an upper window. It occurred to him then that
he had thus first seen her, framed between the curtains of that
window and with lamplight behind her. She had been smiling and that
smile had changed the course of his life, although he had not known
it then.</p>

<p>He held his slouched, off-balanced position, a heavy man with
weariness in his bones. He knew what was coming and he knew
Trumbo's character and his skill, and he was wondering how many
other meetings like this were in the book for him, how much hard
luck, how much evil and torment. There never had been any
smoothness in his life, never a day of golden ease. It had always
been a fight&mdash;with the wind or the range or the sun, with a
man, or with himself. Where was the day of ease?</p>

<p>Trumbo had stopped several moments before, and Trumbo again
seemed to be listening to his inner conscience. He seemed to be
waiting out Coleman as well, to be trying to break the other's
stillness. Behind him was a faint racket in the gorge road, rising
above the rush of the river. He heard that&mdash;and that
apparently pushed him. He had said nothing; he said nothing now.
Coleman, closely watching, saw the man's shoulders lift one
slightest moment before his hand dropped; on that signal Coleman
drew and fired. He saw his bullet shake Trumbo and he watched
Trumbo's gun drop, unused, to the full length of the man's arm,
hold there a moment and then go sliding out of his fingers to the
ground. Trumbo shook his head; an expression, dumb and dulling,
showed on his face as he fell.</p>

<p>Wall ran forward, the lard fat on his body loosely shaking. The
racket in the gorge grew and in another quarter minute the War
Bonnet stage shot into the meadow, howled on its wheels and stopped
before the station. The driver dropped from his seat and ran at
Trumbo. Halfway over the meadow he halted, turned and went back
toward the stage. He clapped his hands against his pockets, stopped
and drew out his plug tobacco and bit off a chunk; he circled the
stage and leaned against the front wall of the house. Then be slid
down on his haunches and began to draw lines in the dust with his
forefinger&mdash;still watching the shape of Trumbo dead in the
yellow grass beyond him.</p>

<p>Wall slowed to a walk, looked down at Trumbo and came on. Great
noises came out of his chest from his running and faint sweat
glistened on his forehead; his big mouth hung open, sucking in air.
His eyes, bedded back in their pouches, had a black and damp
pleasure. He put an arm on the corral and thus supported
himself.</p>

<p>"That man was tough before he came here," he said, "He had a
record down the trail." He bent his head forward. "Where'd you get
your trainin' at this business?"</p>

<p>"Down the trail," said Coleman and returned his gun to its
holster. He stepped away from the corral and paused above Trumbo.
"He wanted a lot of things. In due time he would have gotten them,
but he couldn't wait. He thought the day was too short. Except for
one thing. Luke, he was a good man."</p>

<p>"What thing?"</p>

<p>"He had no heart," said Coleman.</p>

<p>Wall said: "In my book a man is bad or he is good. He was no
damned good at all."</p>

<p>Coleman shrugged his shoulders, "Nothin' in my book is that
certain." He lifted his head, facing the mouth of the gorge and the
great mountain tiers rising before him, black-covered even with the
sun upon them; he stiffened and his chest arched and his eyelids
pulled nearer and he looked upon the mountains with a bristling
temper, "By God," he said, "I wish I did not have to sleep out half
of this day."</p>

<p>Wall said dryly: "All that will keep. When you turn in you will
not rise until mornin'. The river's been at you."</p>

<p>The two walked over the meadow. The stage driver rose up and
said: "You goin' to change these horses?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Wall. "Now."</p>

<p>The driver said: "That Trumbo there?"</p>

<p>"Trumbo," said Wall.</p>

<p>"Change the horses," said the driver. "I want to get down into
the clear country. I see Niles Peck on the road up at the summit.
He says Trumbo has just killed Stuart. I come down to Potter's
Point and I pass Solvay who says he's just left Tap in the brush.
Tap goes after him but is slow. Tap's dead. Change the horses.
Luke."</p>

<p>Wall set about unhitching; he led the four horses away toward
the barn. Valencia stood in the doorway and watched Coleman and
stepped aside to let him pass in. He crossed to the stairs and
turned back to look at her; she was still watching him.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Tracy."</p>

<p>"So long," he said and went up the stairs. He stopped at the
head of the stairs for a moment and looked back at Valencia, and
then went down the short hall and knocked at the door of the front
room. He heard Ann's voice and opened the door and stepped in. She
stood in the middle of the room. He went toward her; he saw nothing
on her face and he felt afraid.</p>

<p>"You heard that driver?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Nothing for me to say about your father. But for you it is
hard."</p>

<p>"I could cry very easily. Not for him but for everything nice he
threw away." Some thought and some feeling ran behind her gravity,
"You are out of trouble. Are you going back to the Basin?"</p>

<p>"Ann," he said, "one thing never changes. What is the need of my
tellin' you? You know what it is. It was in your eyes when I saw
you here one night, in the barn; it has been there ever since. You
could love a man, if you found the man. If I am that man, then I
have found what I want."</p>

<p>"You might have said that last night. You knew it then."</p>

<p>"I had to know somethin' about myself. There has been no woman
before you and none will come after. That is what I had to
know."</p>

<p>"You are a faithful man. Tracy."</p>

<p>"Faithful?" he said, and there came into his glance a smile and
a warmth. He took her and kissed her and his heavy whiskers stung
her and the hardness of his arms hurt her; and she lay in his arms
and answered his need with her own. She was smiling with him, and
heavy with the goodness that filled her.</p>
