  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is an axiom of life that the course of true love never
  ran smoothly. There were certainly snags in the current of Mr. Cris Holborn's
  affair, but the largest and most considerable of these was Florrie Beaches'
  mamma, who was stout and snacky. She snacked Mr. Holborn about his profession
  (she herself being a lady of property and owning the house in Mornington
  Crescent); she snacked him about his gentlemanliness; she snacked him on the
  question of stable odours (she invariably held a handkerchief to her bulbous
  nose when he came into her drawing-room) and she snacked him about his
  education.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, in desperation, Mr. Holborn snacked back. He told her that he
  was one of the best known trainers of racehorses in England, but he was
  "Cris" to scores of the gentry and nobility, and that if a farmer's son was
  not good enough for the daughter of a retired publican, well, he'd like to
  know who was?</p>

  <p>It may be said in passing that Mr. Beaches had not only retired from The
  Trade, but he had also retired from earth, and at the moment was resting at
  Kensal Rise under a huge slab of Aberdeen granite, on which was carved a
  tissue of falsehoods concerning his virtues as a father and husband and his
  great loss to the world.</p>

  <p>And in a sense Cris Holborn's retort was justifiable. He was one of the
  best known trainers in England and one of the cleverest. In the language of
  the crude men who support the art and practice of horse-racing, he was "hot,"
  and when his horses won, he won alone: sometimes not even the owner of the
  horse was aware of the forthcoming jubilations.</p>

  <p>On a night in February, Mrs. Beaches snacked to such purpose, and was
  supported so effectively by her charming daughter, that things happened in
  Mornington Crescent. Neighbours heard the sound of shrill and angry voices, a
  door slammed violently, and there was the sound of breaking glass. . . .</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Peace reigned in Selbany Street Police Station. The station sergeant
  nodded over his book, the policeman on duty at the door yawned frequently and
  wondered if the clock over Disreili's, the High Class Jewellers, had
  stopped.</p>

  <p>The hour was 1 a.m., and it was raining greasily as it can only rain in
  Somers Town. It had been a dull night, being Thursday, when men go soberly to
  their homes and play draughts with their children and win&mdash;if the
  children have any discretion. A night when the picture houses are half empty,
  and the bung at the Rose and Cabbage leant his bloated hands on the zinc
  counter and severely condemned socialism to an empty saloon.</p>

  <p>There were only three men and one perfect lady in the cells at the back of
  the station: crime for the moment was unpopular.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Arbuthnot Challoner, whom men called The Miller because he chewed
  straws, came in hastily out of the darkness, put his reeking umbrella in one
  corner of the hall and hung his shining mackintosh on a peg.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said sardonically, in reply to the grey-haired station sergeant,
  "it <i>is</i> a nice night!"</p>

  <p>The clock ticked solemnly and noisily.</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said The Miller shortly. He had been standing for two hours in
  the rain waiting for a motor-car thief who was expected to retrieve the car
  he had garaged.</p>

  <p>At that moment, when the night seemed as barren of promise as the pages of
  Dr. Stott's sermons, a car drew up opposite the station entrance and there
  sailed into the charge room Miss Florrie Beaches and her ma. Miss Beaches was
  golden-haired and blue-eyed. She wore an evening dress of gold and crimson
  and a theatre wrap of blue and white. She had orchids at her waist and about
  her neck a choker of imitation pearls the size of pigeons' eggs. Her ma was
  more soberly arrayed in black with glittering jet ornaments.</p>

  <p>"Is this the police court?" asked Miss Beaches with a certain
  ferocity.</p>

  <p>"It is the police station," said The Miller. Florrie closed her eyes and
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"That will do," she said quietly. "I wish to have a summons against Mr.
  Cris Holborn for insulting my dear mother and breach of promise, though I
  wouldn't marry the dirty dog not if he went down on his bare knees to me!
  He's a low type and if my poor dear father had been alive he'd have bashed
  his face in!"</p>

  <p>"He would indeed," murmured Mrs. Beaches.</p>

  <p>The Miller would have explained, but&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When a lady lowers herself to be seen out with a common horse trainer,"
  Miss</p>

  <p>Beaches went on rapidly, "when she does everything for a man as I've done,
  introducing him into society so to speak, and when he didn't know what a fish
  knife was till me dear mother taught him, it's hard to hear your dear mother
  called an interfering hag."</p>

  <p>"<i>Old</i> hag," murmured Mrs. Beaches. "Don't forget the winder glass,
  Flo."</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to that, ma. Also I wish to charge him with breaking two panes
  of glass in our front door by his violent temper. I'm going to show this man
  up! Him and his lords that he knows!"</p>

  <p>"Which we don't believe," prompted Mrs. Beaches.</p>

  <p>"And the words he said about publicans is a disgrace," Florrie went on,
  "him and his horse that's going to win at Lincoln&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With twenty-one pound in hand," added the other under her breath.</p>

  <p>"With twenty-one pounds in hand?" repeated The Miller thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"That's what he says," said Miss Florrie, "though I know nothing about
  horse-racing, my dear papa having brought me up very strict. Now I want to
  know if I can't have a summons&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, miss," said The Miller gently, almost benevolently, what was
  the name of this horse?</p>

  <p>"I can't think of it for the moment," said Miss Florrie, to whom the
  identity of the animal was much less important than the exposition of her
  grievances "but if I did know I should tell that common man that always used
  to be hanging about Camden Town&mdash;Elevated Evans."</p>

  <p>"Educated Evans," corrected The Miller.</p>

  <p>"He is not living here just now, but if I can do anything in the way of
  spreading the good news&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's neither here nor there," said Miss Florrie tartly. "Can I have a
  summons "</p>

  <p>And The Miller explained that summonses were never granted at a police
  station, and certainly never granted at one o'clock in the morning. He also
  expressed his doubt as to whether the offence of Mr. Holborn had been as
  heinous as she imagined. To the best of his ability he gave her the law on
  the subject. It is not unlawful to refer to a future mother-in-law in terms
  of opprobrium, and he also explained that the word "hag," whilst it might
  mean a vicious old lady, might also describe one who could bewitch.</p>

  <p>"At the same time," he said sympathetically, "I feel that I would like to
  help you get your own back, Miss Beaches, and if you would mention the name
  of this horse I'd see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this point the silent mother became voluble.</p>

  <p>"It's no good your wasting your time here, my dear. They can't do
  anything, and if they could they wouldn't. All these men stick together. The
  best thing to do is to see your dear father's solicitors in the morning. If I
  don't have the law on Cris Holborn..."</p>

  <p>They made a noisy exeunt.</p>

  <p>It was rather strange, as they say in Somers Town when they mean to imply
  coincidence, that this reference to Educated Evans should have been followed
  up that very morning by the appearance in court of a local larcenist who in
  the old days invariably traced his downfall to the fact that he was a
  subscriber to Educated Evans' £5 specials; for Mr. Evans had been the World's
  Champion Prophet and Turf Adviser.</p>

  <p>Miss Beaches had gone home with her mother, some of her ardour for
  vengeance a little cooled. She awoke at nine o'clock to find her mother with
  a letter in her hand. It had come by hand from her outrageous lover&mdash;she
  recognised his novel spelling.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, ma!" she said. "Perhaps I was hard on him: I knew he'd send me
  an humble apology first thing in the morning."</p>

  <p>"It's got to be humble," said her ma ominously. " 'Ag I may be, but old
  I'm not!"</p>

  <p>"You've got to allow something for youth," said Florrie romantically as
  she tore open the envelope. "The poor boy wasn't himself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She read the letter: it was very short.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I'm done with you and that old nagger your ma. I'm lowering
  myself to associate with a lot of bung's relations. Farewell. Never cross my
  parth again. CRIS.</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Send back the ring I gave you, <u>I may want
  it</u>.</p><br>

  <p>Florrie didn't scream, she did not faint. She jerked her hair savagely
  into a ball and jabbed a hairpin into the confusion.</p>

  <p>"That settles him!" she hissed.</p>

  <p>Her ma was making savage noises. Florrie ran to the door and pulled it
  open. "Em-ma!" she screamed.</p>

  <p>Her maid, who was also housemaid, parlourmaid and errand girl, flew up the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"Go and find that tipping man you was&mdash;were talking about
  yesterday&mdash;go and bring him here at once!"</p>

  <p>She returned, rolling up the sleeves of her kimono pugilistically.</p>

  <p>"Nagger... !" moaned her ma.</p>

  <p>"Goin' to make thousands of pounds, is he!" said Florrie fiendishly. "I
  mustn't tell anybody, mustn't I? I'll show him... Digger Boy! That's the
  name of the horse, ma! Digger Boy&mdash;I'll Digger Boy him."</p>

  <p>She said other things&mdash;such as may be pardonable in a lady under the
  sad circumstances.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Emma was searching Camden Town for a local prophet who was
  not without honour in his own district.</p>

  <p>A day or two later Camden Town was startled by the most stupendous item of
  intelligence that had been dropped in years. Educated Evans was back!</p>

  <p>The news ran like a prairie fire from the Midland Goods Yard to the
  Holloway Road&mdash;from Great College Street to the Nag's head. Men heard
  and halted their pewter pots between counter and lip and said "Go <i>on</i>!"
  Some confessed that they thought he was dead; others corrected this
  impression regretfully. Down at the "White Hart" an old man stirred and
  glanced uneasily at the door. Miss Pluter, the new barmaid at the "Stag and
  Crown" (she who wore "Gertrude" in diamonds across her blouse) expressed a
  desire to see the man about whom she had heard so much, and a dozen knights
  and squires of the saloon bar offered eagerly to fetch Evans the very next
  night.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans had returned to the scenes of his vicissitudes and triumphs! He
  had once gone through the card at Kempton one remarkable day and had made
  two, three, five, ten thousand pounds according to the source of report. He
  had retired; he was an owner of houses; he had an estate in the country and
  occasionally wrote to former clients on note-paper headed "Haddon Hall,
  Pilberry Road, Bromley," and that in printed characters.</p>

  <p>It was believed that he had a servant of his own and was so rich that he
  wore a clean collar every day of his life. Further, it was alleged by one who
  had visited him that he had his dinner at the hour when most respectable
  people have finished their tea and are having a sluice in the kitchen
  preparatory to a visit to the pictures. This story, however, was not
  credited.</p>

  <p>Nor did the news of his return find general acceptance. Camden Town had
  been an uneducated place since Mr. Evans drove away in a taxi- cab smoking a
  Masa cigar ("all the fragrance of Havana for 6d."), waving his hand
  graciously from the window. Many a man who could not afford a mouthpiece
  regretted his going, for Evans was as good as a lawyer, and many an address,
  calculated to move the stoniest-hearted magistrate, had he composed. It was
  Evans who got Bill Barrett off a lagging by a defence (read by Bill in the
  dock) showing that he had suffered from loss of memory and sleep-walking
  since a child. Bill certainly boggled some of the words (his pronunciation of
  "somnambulism" was wonderful to hear), but there were tears in his eyes as he
  read things about himself that he had never known till that moment.</p>

  <p>In the days of his activities Educated Evans had had one faithful servant.
  His name was Samuel Toggs, he having been so christened in the dim and
  glorious ages when hansom cabs were a novelty and malefactors were publicly
  executed before Horsemonger Lane Gaol. He was called "Old Sam," partly
  because Sam was his name and partly because of his many years. His occupation
  in life, in those days, was the support of the "White Hart," a noble
  hostelry. He supported this palace of sin by keeping his back against it from
  10 a.m. to chucking-out time. In olden days he drew water for thirsty
  cab-horses and received a penny for each draw, but horses belonged to the
  past and he knew not petrol. A strange, burly old gentleman, with tender feet
  and an opalescent beard that might have been white with care, he wore, summer
  and winter, two overcoats and a pair of black woollen mittens, a woollen
  scarf and a bowler hat that he had found in the roadway after a fight on
  Christmas Day, 1891.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans had been a force in Camden Town, being an educated man and one
  learned in the ways of thoroughbred racehorses. So, if you believed him, no
  horse won unless he had received Mr. Evans' express permission to do so, and
  that in writing. Sometimes he gave them permission and they didn't win, but,
  as he said, horses are not machines. He asked his clients (for he supplied
  information for a trifle to all who acted honourable) to remember that he
  gave Braxted (What a beauty! What a beauty!) at 20-1. He made a lot of money
  and retired to the country: what was more natural than that, when he lost a
  lot of money, he should come back to town?</p>

  <p>It is strange that, as Educated Evans had journeyed towards the
  metropolis, he should think kindly, almost tenderly, of Old Sam. That beer-
  soddened ancient was in a sense a protégé of Evans'. Though from morning
  until night he propped up the walls of the "White Hart," standing with his
  back firmly fixed to the wall, and refusing to be enticed away by any save
  the potman, he had made an exception in the case of Mr. Evans, for whom he
  ran errands, hobbled about with messages to clients, and sometimes collected
  money on behalf of his patron. Old Sam had touched his cap to the educated
  man and had once called him "sir," but this was on the night that Sam had
  paid for his own drink twice.</p>

  <p>It was not until two mornings after his return that stress of business
  permitted the educated man to look up his old acquaintances, and it was by a
  pure accident that the first of these should be The Miller&mdash;a lover of
  racing and no bad friend to Evans.</p>

  <p>Mr. Challoner was standing opposite the Cobden statue, doing nothing, when
  his absent gaze rested on a man who was walking up Bayham Street. He was not
  tall, he was not broad. He was to an extent well-dressed. In one corner of
  his mouth was a large cigar; he swung a nearly-gold-headed cane as he
  strutted towards High Street, and if his bowler hat and brown boots did not
  accord with his morning coat, he had the air of a nobleman.</p>

  <p>The Miller's jaw dropped as the man came nearer, for he recognised
  instantly the World's Premier Prophet and Turf Adviser.</p>

  <p>"Well, well!" said The Miller, when the first greetings were over. "So
  you're back, and Camden Town has one more mug."</p>

  <p>"It's all very well for you to go passing personal remarks," said Educated
  Evans, with a touch of asperity in his voice, "but what's the good of locking
  the stable door after the horse has ate his wild oats, I ask you, Mr.
  Challoner?"</p>

  <p>Sergeant Challoner did not take offence at the brusqueness, even rudeness,
  of the reply, but continued to nibble his straw reflectively, his grave eyes
  fixed upon the Prophet.</p>

  <p>"You had a fortune," he said slowly. "You won it by being clever enough
  not to back your own tips, and by reducing yourself to a condition of beastly
  intoxication before you went racing. When you handed up your money and told
  the bookmakers what horse was going to win, you happened to speak the
  truth&mdash;<i>in vino veritas</i>."</p>

  <p>"I know Veritas&mdash;he's a two-year-old in Persse's stable&mdash;but
  Vino is an animal I don't remember."</p>

  <p>"Having accumulated this wealth, you took your ill-gotten gains, purchased
  a farm, and not only committed the unspeakable folly of owning racehorses,
  but added the general lunacy of attempting to train them."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"It was the feeding that done it," he said. "Was I to know that horses
  didn't eat bones and birdseed? Is there a book published on the subject? Did
  Mr. Gilpings when he wrote his highly clarsical articles in the weekly
  newspapers, mention anything about feeding animals? Anyway," he added
  hopefully, "I'll get it all back over the Lincoln. There's a horse in that
  race that hasn't been tryin' for four years. There's a big stable commission,
  and he's <i>loose</i>! This horse could hop home on his fetlocks. I'm sending
  it out on my Five-Pound Owner's Special Wire, so don't put it about,
  Miller."</p>

  <p>The detective sighed.</p>

  <p>"Camden Town has been a dull and truthful place without you," he said.
  "What's the name of this horse?"</p>

  <p>"Otono," said Educated Evans. "I've got a thousand pounds to twenty about
  it from Izzy Isaacsheim."</p>

  <p>The Miller rubbed his nose thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"He was scratched this morning," he said gently, and Mr. Evans made a
  clucking noise with his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Thank Gawd I didn't back him!" he said, and did not even attempt to
  excuse his perjury. "With that animal out of the way, it's a stone certainty
  for Cold Meat. That horse has been specially kep' for this race. I've had it
  from the boy who does him."</p>

  <p>"When you get anything good, you might come and see me," said The Miller,
  preparing to mount his bicycle. Cold Meat's been sold to go to Belgium. I
  thought you might have seen it in the papers yesterday&mdash;the way they
  send these worn-out old horses to Belgium is a scandal."</p>

  <p>He waited, and then:</p>

  <p>"How's Old Sam?" asked Evans.</p>

  <p>The Miller got down from the pedal of his bicycle.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you heard?" he asked, in a hushed whisper.</p>

  <p>"Not dead?" asked Evans, preparing to be shocked.</p>

  <p>"No," said The Miller, and then: "There's no room for you here,
  Evans&mdash;you've lost the art of tipping losers."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It's a nistoric fac'," he said, "that once you're a bricklayer you're
  always a bricklayer. It's in your blood. Look at Napoleon Bonaparte, the
  well-known French officer. When he was took away an' imprisoned on the Isle
  of Dogs did he sit down an' moan? No, Mr. Challoner, he sees a spider comin'
  down from the ceilin' an' he says 'Turn again, Napoleon,' an' sure enough he
  did."</p>

  <p>"What?" asked the dazed Miller.</p>

  <p>"Turn," said Evans, "an' I've turned. When I read in the so- called
  sporting press the ad. of this feller an' that feller&mdash;actually boastin'
  about the 7-4 winners they've give, I remember Braxted&mdash;20-1. What a
  beauty! an' Eton Boy, 100-12. What a beauty! an' such like high-class
  predictions an' prophecies, an' I says to myself, 'Evans,' I says, 'don't let
  them daylight robbers have all the loot to theirselves 'op in and help
  yourself.' "</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans gave a hitch to his shepherd plaid trousers, lit again his
  towsled cigar and wiped his moustache on the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Did Camden Town hang out its flags when you came back?" asked The
  Miller.</p>

  <p>"Sarcasm don't mean nothing to me," said Evans; "it passes me by like
  Cardinal Richloo, the highly respected clergyman said, like water on a duck's
  back in one yerhole and out of the other yerhole."</p>

  <p>"I seem to have heard that ancient wheeze at the Bedford&mdash;in the
  early nine-ties," said The Miller. "What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans studied the busy prospect of High Street before he answered.</p>

  <p>"I'm gettin' together my army of touts," he said. "I've appointed me
  Newmarket an' Lambourn men&mdash;an' to all clients new an' old I say 'Fear
  Nothing!' "</p>

  <p>"And what do they say?" asked the interested Miller.</p>

  <p>Evans coughed.</p>

  <p>"They ain't had time to reply yet," he said. "I only sent out yesterday to
  a few clients&mdash;about three thousand."</p>

  <p>"Liar," said The Miller softly, and Mr. Evans smiled as though he knew
  better.</p>

  <p>"Seen anything of young Harry Leafer&mdash;he used to be a client of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>The question was carelessly put but Mr. Evans shot a suspicious glance at
  him. For the whisper had gone round and it had reached him, that young Harry
  had disappeared suddenly and urgently only that morning. It was even said
  that he had gone to Brighton or some other foreign part.</p>

  <p>"I don't know nothing about young Harry," he said, hurt. "Can't you get it
  out of your head that I'm a 'nose,' Mr. Challoner?"</p>

  <p>"'Nose' is vulgar&mdash;say unofficial detective," murmured The Miller,
  and made preparations to go.</p>

  <p>"Look up Old Sam: he'll be tickled to death to see you," he said at
  parting. Educated Evans sniffed.</p>

  <p>"The likes of him look <i>me</i> up," he said. "He knows where to find
  me."</p>

  <p>There are few keener pleasures than the happy sense of anticipation which
  is enjoyed by the wanderer returned to his native home. He pictures the
  enthusiasm which the news of his return will bring; he sees in his mind's eye
  men crossing the road to greet him, or the shy children he left behind, now
  radiant and beautiful young women, advancing timidly to hold his hand, and
  gazing with awe upon one who had ventured abroad. Educated Evans had not been
  abroad, but Bromley is a very long way from Camden Town.</p>

  <p>He saw no recognisable shy maidens, High Street being notoriously
  deficient in this quantity. Nor did anybody rush across the road, in imminent
  peril of being run over, to grasp him warmly by the hand. The landlord of the
  "Red Lion" gave him a curt nod and did not seem to be aware of the fact that
  he had been away at all. An acquaintance of other days certainly joined him
  at the bar at his invitation, but Mr. Evans realised that he would join
  anybody who uttered the magic password to conviviality, "Wotshors?"</p>

  <p>"How's Old Sam?" asked Mr. Evans.</p>

  <p>His guest for the moment coughed and looked uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's all right," he said, and changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"I'm opening my new office this week," said Evans carelessly.</p>

  <p>His acquaintance coughed again.</p>

  <p>"I hope you'll give some winners," he said unpromisingly.</p>

  <p>"Braxted," murmured Evans. "People have got a short memory."</p>

  <p>"Personally I was at school when Braxted won," said the other with a
  certain significance.</p>

  <p>At the "Old Albany Arms" Evans found two clients of other days, and broke
  it to them that he was back in business. They seemed uncomfortable. When he
  asked after Old Sam they were embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Was the aged man ill? wondered Evans as he strolled forth into the High
  Street, and there came upon him the spirit of philanthropy and
  loving-kindness. Old Sam used to live in a house up a very narrow passage
  which was called locally "Little Hell," though there were many people who
  thought that the adjective hardly described the character of the place.</p>

  <p>Evans called. Old Sam's landlady was out. Her slatternly granddaughter
  told him that Old Sam was living in Great College Street. Mr. Evans was
  shocked. Great College Street is a thoroughfare more or less devoted to the
  plutocrat.</p>

  <p>He sought out the address: a highly respectable and classy one. There was
  a lawn in front of the house and white curtains at the window, and the bit of
  a servant girl who answered the door piped that Mr. Toggs was out, and would
  Mr. Evans come into his sitting-room and wait?</p>

  <p>Educated Evans went out into the street, a little dazed. Had Old Sam come
  into money? He was to learn.</p>

  <p>He wended his way to his newly recovered flat in Bayham Mews. He referred
  to it as a "flat," though in truth it was two rooms over a stable, and he was
  very lucky to get back his old quarters. Fortune had come to him, as The
  Miller had said, and he had started forth upon a hectic career as owner and
  trainer, freely backing his own horses, in consequence of which he had
  returned to Bayham Mews with ten pounds, one pair of plaid trousers, a gold-
  plated safety razor and a few inconsiderable articles of property which he
  had salved from the wreckage of his estate.</p>

  <p>Evans had work to do. He had acquired for a song a patent duplicator. A
  child could work it. There was in fact a picture in the advertisement of a
  pretty little girl turning out thousands of copies in an hour and smiling the
  while, as though at the ridiculous ease with which handbills, accounts and
  announcements of all kinds (to quote the literature which accompanied the
  picture) might be copied. Evans would like to have met that child. He guessed
  she was a weight-lifter in her spare moments.</p>

  <p>It was easy enough to write your announcement on wax paper. You used a
  stylo and the point went through. Then you fixed the wax paper on the
  machine, inked a roller and turned a handle. At first nothing happened. Then
  a violet oblong, covered with all the available ink, came out.</p>

  <p>Evans preferred a rubber stamp, or, alternatively, the services of a young
  lady in Great College Street, who did that kind of work at a reasonable price
  and with great rapidity.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he determined on one more attempt with the patent
  duplicator. So working, he heard the slow thump of feet on the wooden step
  that led to his door, and presently the door itself opened, revealing the
  bulbous face of an aged man. It was Old Sam. But Old Sam in a frock
  coat&mdash;Old Sam in a top hat!</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Evans," said Sam huskily, and Mr. Evans nearly dropped.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Evans!" And this from a man who was, so to speak, a slave!</p>

  <p>He blinked into the room suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Evans," he said again.</p>

  <p>The educated man waved his hand haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Push off&mdash;I've got nothing to give away," he said.</p>

  <p>Such a rebuff would have reduced a sensitive man to tears of
  mortification. Old Sam scratched himself thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I gotta tip for Digger Boy first day at Lincoln," he said, and Evans
  gasped at the insolence. Even in his delirium he realised that he'd never
  heard of such a horse as Digger Boy. But imagine the feelings of Michelangelo
  in receipt of a letter from a Florentine Correspondence School headed "Let us
  Show You How to Paint&mdash;Send No Money!" or Shakespeare being chided at
  rehearsal by a small-part lady for splitting his infinitives.</p>

  <p>"A what!" asked Mr. Evans, scarcely believing his ears.</p>

  <p>"Got it from the young lady who knows the trainer," wheezed Old Sam,
  stroking his variegated beard. "What a beauty, what a beauty! Help
  yourself!"</p>

  <p>The room spun round. This... this common loafer, this holder-open of taxi
  doors... this embeered and senile servant to the pot . . . actually
  employing terms which were sacred to Mr. Evans' exclusive profession.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute&mdash;a young lady gave you this... horse? Why?"</p>

  <p>Old Sam came farther into view. He was resplendent. A cable chain of gold
  was stretched across his portliness. He wore patent leather boots.</p>

  <p>"She sent for me," he said hoarsely, "me havin' a reputation&mdash;she
  sent for me!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans held on to a chair for support. Had the great revolution
  arrived? Had the masses destroyed the intelligentsia of the country and
  assumed control of affairs? Were the lower orders on top and the aristocracy
  of brains destroyed?</p>

  <p>"'Ere, what's the game?" said Mr. Evans, a little breathlessly.</p>

  <p>Sam looked uneasy for a moment.</p>

  <p>"When you went away I took up this tippin' business an' I've done well,"
  he said. "Can't read myself, but got a boy to look through the papers, and if
  I liked the name I give it&mdash;'aven't you 'eard of Old Sam's
  Specials?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was not dreaming.</p>

  <p>"Old Sam's Specials?" he repeated hollowly. "What did you sell 'em
  for?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Toggs shuffled his feet in his embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Tuppence," he said, and Educated Evans nearly swooned.</p>

  <p>"Tuppence!"</p>

  <p>He looked round for something to throw at the visitor, but there was only
  the patent duplicator, and even a child could not have thrown that.... Sam
  was halfway down the stairs before Evans could bring his numbed brain to
  work. He rushed to the landing and looked down into the face of the
  plagiarist.</p>

  <p>"... Robbin' my brains, you perishin' old swiper..." he yelled.</p>

  <p>"Digger Boy... 'ad 'im from 'eadquarters!" bellowed Sam. "An' don't go
  pinchin' any of my customers!"</p>

  <p>Evans put on his hat and went out to make inquiries. It was true. Almost
  every little newsagent in Camden Town sold Old Sam's Specials.</p>

  <p>"I admit they're different to yours," said one agent, and added: "They
  win.''</p>

  <p>It was night time when the real tragedy came home to him. He called at the
  White Hart, expecting to see Old Sam supporting the wall and to pass him by
  in disdain. He saw The Miller talking to a policeman near the saloon
  entrance, but Old Sam was in the private bar. Evans heard him as he opened
  the door.</p>

  <p>"I gotta horse for Lincoln that can't lose... this horse could fall down
  an' get up an' win. Lady sent for me specially to tell me. She says, 'Are you
  the well-known Educated man?' I says, 'Yes, miss &mdash;I'm known as Educated
  Toggs...' "</p>

  <p>Evans flung open the door with a savage howl and dashed in.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate that The Miller saw and gripped him in time and dragged
  him out: most unfortunate for Sam that he followed in a valiant mood: a
  crowning calamity that he should mistake the uniformed policeman with whom
  The Miller had been talking for his old patron, and should assault him with a
  pewter pot.</p>

  <p>They carried Old Sam to the station on an ambulance, and the next morning
  an unsympathetic magistrate sent him down for three weeks.</p>

  <p>"I hated putting the old man away," said The Miller. "Anyway, Evans, the
  coast is clear for you now your rival has gone."</p>

  <p>"Rival " sneered Evans. "That pie-can! Why, he don't know a horse from a
  step-ladder. I wish he'd been out when I started my season! I'm sendin' out a
  horse that couldn't lose if he was scratched."</p>

  <p>"What is this horse?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Digger Boy&mdash;help yourself&mdash;and don't forget I've got a mouth!"
  said Mr. Evans.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>II. &mdash; A SOUVENIR</h2>

  <p class="first">THROUGH his uncurtained window Mr. Evans could see the young
  lady in grey. She occupied the rooms immediately opposite his own and on the
  other side of the mews. Her uncle was a musher and drove a taxi which he and
  his brother George had purchased on the "never never" system. You pay £8o
  down and more than you can afford for the rest of your life. Her aunt was
  genteel and wore eyeglasses. They lived in a large suite of rooms which
  extended over two garages, in one of which the cab was cleaned: it never
  stayed there for any appreciable time. The uncle drove it by day, and another
  uncle, whose name was George, by night, or <i>vice versa</i>. The taxi-cab
  never complained about this perpetual motion because it was inarticulate.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was not interested in the cab, or the uncle, who always seemed
  to have boils on his neck, or Uncle George, who was a thin, acidulated man
  who talked to himself all the time. Nor did he look twice at the aunt. But
  the niece in grey, with her black hair and her saucy way of putting her hand
  on her hip, and her shining silk stockings&mdash;this young woman was, and
  had been since she first nodded to him brightly and said "Morning," an object
  of profound speculation and delight. Sometimes she nursed a baby prettily. He
  discovered in subsequent conversations that it was her sister's.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was not old. On the other hand, he was not young. And anyway,
  scholars have no age: they are youthful or ancient according to the measure
  of their erudition.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet she wonders who I am," said Mr. Evans with a quiet, sad smile.
  Few people know me outside of the profession. I'll bet she says, 'I wonder
  who that lonely man is: he looks as if he's had a lot of trouble&mdash;an'
  what an interestin' face he's got, mother or auntie, as the case may be!'
  "</p>

  <p>Thus Evans communed with himself before the mirror, not knowing at that
  time the exact relationship of the lady with the driver of cabs.</p>

  <p>One evening he leaned over the balustrade of the landing outside his door.
  She came out, looked and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Evening," she said. "It's a nice evening."</p>

  <p>"Not so good as Palermo in the South of France, or dear old India," said
  Evans. "Give me Egyp' for nice evenin's an' a half-hour's row down the Nile
  Canal."</p>

  <p>She looked at him awe-stricken, red lips parted, violet eyes wide
  open.</p>

  <p>"Have you been there?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Lots of times," said Evans carelessly; "<i>and</i> China, which is the
  most highly populised country in the world. That's where we get china from
  an' Chinese lanterns."</p>

  <p>She leaned over her landing too. There was twelve feet of space between
  them. Down below a dazed horse-keeper stopped work to listen.</p>

  <p>"It must be wonderful going abroad."</p>

  <p>Evans shrugged so violently that one of his brace buttons came off and
  fell with a musical tinkle on the cobble-stones below.</p>

  <p>"You get used to it if you're a racehorse owner," he said. " I've won the
  Calcutta Cup once but gave away the ticket to a footman at my
  club&mdash;couldn't be bothered. The Melbourne Cup&mdash;that's a wonderful
  race! Down in Orstralia."</p>

  <p>She drew a long, sighing breath; her eyes were bright. He had, he saw,
  assumed a new interest in her eyes. The glow of it made his flannel
  undershirt feel prickly.</p>

  <p>"Fancy... you own race-horses! Do they ever win?"</p>

  <p>Evans smiled tiredly.</p>

  <p>"Now and again. I don't like winnin' too often. The other members of the
  Jockey Club get that jealous there's no holdin' 'em."</p>

  <p>"But how mean!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans started to shrug again but remembered in time. Down below in the
  mews, the horse-keeper swooned against the wall.</p>

  <p>"You can't please everybody," said Educated Evans. "Even Queen Elizabeth
  couldn't do that&mdash;that's why she got her napp&mdash;her head cut off by
  B&mdash;Mary the celebrated Queen of Scotch. That led to the Diet of Worms
  an' the rise an' fall of the far-famed Oliver Cromwell, fourteen hundred and
  seventy-six," he added.</p>

  <p>She was stricken speechless for a moment, and Educated Evans
  proceeded.</p>

  <p>"That brings us to the question of Astronomy. Very few people know that
  the eclipse of the sun is caused by the earth in its revolutions comin'
  between the moon an' the sun, thus causin' many ignorant people to think that
  the whole thing's wrong, when as a matter of fact it's an act of nature."</p>

  <p>He was now speaking fluently, swinging his hat with the same easy
  carelessness as a sailor swings the lead. And when he dropped the hat into a
  puddle immediately below him, he just smiled. He was that much careless.</p>

  <p>"Take the law," he said. "There's a good many people don't understand the
  law. Many a time I've stood up in court and said to the other
  lawyers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are you a lawyer too?"</p>

  <p>Below the horse-keeper tried to say that Mr. Evans was less of a lawyer
  than a something liar, but his lips would not frame the words.</p>

  <p>"Bit of everything," said Mr. Evans modestly. "Scientific&mdash;take
  sidlitz powders&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The beautiful girl in grey was spared the need. Her aunt appeared in the
  open doorway, a mass of undigested knitting in her hands, and called her
  in.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Clara, do!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, auntie," said the girl meekly.</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you want to talk to that old man for?" demanded the
  aunt, too audibly: the rest was undistinguishable.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans sneered at her. Old! What a nerve! Still, he had impressed her:
  he could see that. He went down the wooden steps, retrieved his hat and his
  button, and returned to the privacy of his "den" to dry the one and sew the
  other. She knew him now for what he was. An educated man. She was probably
  talking to her aunt about it at that moment, chiding her parent for her
  uncharity.</p>

  <p>"No, auntie, you are wrong. I won't allow you to say that. He is
  <i>not</i> old&mdash;and what is age? One loves a man's mind; his
  breadth&mdash;his education."</p>

  <p>That's what he imagined her saying.</p>

  <p>What she actually said was:</p>

  <p>"Who <i>is</i> that funny old geezer, aunt?"</p>

  <p>"God knows," said her aunt, a pious woman. "I think he's something to do
  with dogs."</p>

  <p>But Clara Develle was honestly and sincerely interested in Educated Evans
  and wondered about him. For example, she often wondered if he was right in
  his head. And she wondered who gave him his plaid trousers, and she wondered
  if he was a burglar, but decided that he was too tender on his feet for that
  nippy profession. And as her wonderment grew, there came to her a realisation
  that there really were possibilities about the educated man.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about <i>him</i>," said her aunt sharply, when she approached
  the subject. "Your uncle Alf says things can't go on as they're going. You've
  got to find something to do. He can't keep you in idleness, because we're
  poor people, and if we wasn't we wouldn't."</p>

  <p>Miss Clara said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle's a man of the world&mdash;so is your uncle George," her aunt
  went on. "There's some things we don't know and don't <i>want</i> to know.
  Certain things have been remarked, but the least said soonest mended. Only it
  seems <i>funny</i>!"</p>

  <p>Her niece was evidently in agreement with these cryptic sentiments, hints
  and innuendos, for she sighed sadly. Mr. Evans did not see her again that
  night, but he did notice, as he had noticed before, a young man going up the
  steps after dark.</p>

  <p>Dark suspicions gathered in Mr. Evans' mind. Could this young man be a
  Fellow? Was he a Chap? The thing was preposterous... such a child... the
  aunt would never allow it. Not if she was a Good Woman...</p>

  <p>Occasionally The Miller drifted down Bayham Mews. Generally it was a
  matter of duty which brought him to this place of silence, but sometimes he
  mounted the wooden steps that led to the habitation of one who was called,
  for excellent reason, Educated Evans, in search of social
  relaxation&mdash;for even a detective-sergeant has a human side to his
  character.</p>

  <p>On this chilly night in March The Miller came up the steps and knocked at
  the door.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Mr. Challoner!" said Educated Evans graciously. "Kindly step
  inside and take the chair."</p>

  <p>"Have you got a meeting, Evans?" asked The Miller good- humouredly.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but I've only got one chair," said Evans.</p>

  <p>He wore his overcoat, for the night was cold and the fire that burnt in
  the grate was so small as to be almost invisible. The Miller glanced at the
  table, where a paraffin lamp shed its rays upon a litter of paper.</p>

  <p>"Just writing to a few of my clients, said Evans, rubbing his long nose.
  "They don't deserve it, but I've got to do it&mdash;Cold Feet for the Hurst
  Park Hurdle. He's been kept special for it. Not a yard at Lingfield&mdash;but
  this time his head's loose."</p>

  <p>"Old Sam says&mdash;" began The Miller, but the look of pain, reproach,
  contempt and acid amusement in Evans' face cancelled his communique. Old Sam
  had been a propper of boozers, a holder of horses, an opener of cab doors. As
  lowly as a slave to Educated Evans, who had given him money and orders. And
  in the protracted absence of Mr. Evans in the country, Old Sam, traitor,
  ingrate and saturated beer-hound, had blossomed forth as a tipster.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I mentioned your rival," said The Miller.</p>

  <p>The pain in Mr. Evans' face grew more acute.</p>

  <p>If The Miller had any reason for his call he did not state it. Evans was
  almost glad to see him go. Great was his fortune when later, slipping out to
  get a quick one, he met the grey girl at the end of the mews. He had an
  impression that she had just seen somebody off&mdash;a brief, blurred glimpse
  of a figure vanishing in the darkness. Should he speak to her or pass with a
  stately bow.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, Mr. Evans."</p>

  <p>She knew his name.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, Miss&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Develle," she said. "Just been seeing a friend off," she went on.
  "Not exactly a friend, but a gentleman who is always running after me."</p>

  <p>"What a cheek!" said Evans hotly. "I never heard such a thing in my life.
  It's proposterous!"</p>

  <p>They lingered awhile. Her eyes shone hotly out of the dark; the dusk of
  night was in her hair. Evans grew agitated. It was within five minutes of
  closing time.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have a chat with you, Mr. Evans," she said earnestly. "You're
  such a Man of the World, or Gentleman of the World as one might say. I'll be
  going to the Rialto pictures at eight to-morrow night. Please don't mention
  it to auntie."</p>

  <p>She was gone before he realised; her black hair and violet eyes were
  swallowed in the void. Educated Evans reeled to the nearest house of
  refreshment and drank heavily, for him.</p>

  <p>They met in the ornate vestibule of the Rialto. Harold Lloyd favoured them
  with a celluloid smile as they slipped into the dark interior.</p>

  <p>"... Yes, my aunt. My papa married beneath him&mdash;he was a Colonel in
  the army... that little baby's my sister Annie's.... Oh, I'm so glad to have
  a chat with you, Mr. Evans! I'm in such trouble. I must get some kind of
  work&mdash;I really must. It's hateful depending on relations or even
  relatives...."</p>

  <p>She told him of her struggles; of the weary round she went from aunt to
  aunt&mdash;</p>

  <p>"There's a cashier wanted at Lammer's. That's my work... if only I
  knew<br>
  somebody who knew somebody else who knew Mr. Lammer."</p>

  <p>Honestly she was not aware that Mr. Lammer was an acquaintance of his.
  When he explained that he had only to crook his finger for Mr. Lammer to skip
  like an intoxicated lamb, she thought he was swanking. The most she had
  expected of her new-found friend was a novel angle which would help her.</p>

  <p>When the lights went up he saw (for her hat was removed) that she was a
  little older than he had thought. This pleased him. He paid for a light fish
  supper out of his last half-crown and went to bed full of noble resolves.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans, of Sansovino House, Bayham Mews, was not without influence.
  There were people in Camden Town who never heard his name mentioned without
  employing the most regrettable expressions to describe The World's Premier
  Racing Prophet and Turf Adviser; but there were others who through thick and
  thin were loyalty personified.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lammer, the High-Class Draper and Ladies' Outfitter, for example,
  never ceased to sound the praises of one who, at a critical moment in his
  history, when every other man who came into his office carried a writ of
  summons in his inside left-hand pocket, had imparted to Mr. Lammer the
  exclusive information that Braxted could fall down, have a fit and
  <i>then</i> win the Stewards' Cup.</p>

  <p>The distracted Mr. Lammer had in his possession at the time the sum of
  four hundred pounds, which he had put aside for the rainy day when he would
  be obliged (in the language of Camden Town) to do a guy. This sum, withheld
  from his creditors, he invested on Braxted at 25-1. And Braxted won.
  Twenty-five times f400 is exactly 10,000, and with this sum Mr. Lammer paid
  his debts, extended his premises and entered upon a newer and brighter
  life.</p>

  <p>He was not a cultured man, being one of those who admitted responsibility
  for his own success, and he admired the erudition of his humble friend beyond
  words.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Mr. Evans," he said, as the educated man sat on the edge of a
  chair in his office and made his request, "I'll do anything I can for you.
  I've given up backin' 'orses, but if you're ever short of a few pound, step
  in and ask for what you want. You say that this young lady is All Right?"</p>

  <p>Evans drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"She's the daughter of a colonel in the Army," he explained fervently,
  "and a perfect lady: owin' to a bank failure the family's ruined. She's like
  the celebrated Dick Whittin'ton an' don't know the way to turn. And she
  reminds me of the well-known an' highly respected wife of Julius Cesar, the
  far-famed Italian&mdash;she's above the position."</p>

  <p>So it was arranged that Clara Develle should go into Lammer's store as
  junior cashier at a reasonable salary, and Evans purred his way back to
  Bayham Mews, where the young aristocrat was in residence, and waited for the
  friendly dark to tell her the good news.</p>

  <p>"I must say it's awfully good of you, Mr. Evans," she said
  rapidly&mdash;she was rather a quick talker. "What a bit of luck for me that
  I met you as I did! I'm sure my poor pa would have died with shame if he knew
  I was going into business&mdash;as a matter of fact he died from eppoplexity
  during the air-raids, him being a general and naturally brave."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans scarcely noticed her parent's promotion.</p>

  <p>"Has that feller been worrying you again?" he asked with a sub-tone of
  ferocity.</p>

  <p>On the previous night they had discussed the furtive young man who came
  and went in the dark. Mr. Evans had recognised him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Erman? Oh, dear, no," she protested. "I'd never dream of looking
  twice at him. Saucy monkey if ever there was one."</p>

  <p>"I saw him talking to you in the mews to-night&mdash;" began Evans.</p>

  <p>"Merely passing the time of day. One has to be civil in my position. I
  mean to say, you've got to be polite if you're a lady," she said
  breathlessly.</p>

  <p>Evans, the loyalest of men, felt she should know the worst.</p>

  <p>"He's a crook, a hook, and a twister," said Evans. He's done time for
  burglary and he owes me two pun' ten over Charley's Mount, what I put him on
  to. Remember, miss, if there's any trouble, I'm around!"</p>

  <p>She said she would remember: she said this rather vaguely, as though she
  were thinking of something else.</p>

  <p>"You've been simply marvellous to me," said the General's daughter with a
  sigh, and when I get working I'm going to give you a little souvenir."</p>

  <p>"A bit of ribbon," said Educated Evans sentimentally, "a stay
  lace&mdash;anything to remind me of you&mdash;nothing expensive."</p>

  <p>Things were not going well with Evans. He might have paraphrased a Mr.
  Browning and said, "Never the chance and the girl and the money all
  together."</p>

  <p>A week later Educated Evans watched the stream of life passing along
  Hampstead Road, and mused a little sorrowfully upon the unattainable value of
  things. Every motor-omnibus that flew by was worth a thousand pounds; not a
  cyclist plodded across the field of his vision that was not supported by a
  couple of pounds' worth of old iron and rubber.</p>

  <p>The landlord of his suite in Bayham Mews had that morning demanded (with a
  certain significant reference to the number of people who were begging and
  praying for the accommodation usurped by Mr. Evans) that the four weeks'
  arrears of rent should be paid by twelve noon on the following day, failing
  which&mdash;</p>

  <p>Detective-Sergeant Challoner stood by his side in as earnest a
  contemplation of the pageant of life. A keen wind blew down High Street,
  though the sun shone overhead in a blue and white sky: it was spring. Outside
  the White Hart the red-nosed Lolly Marks stood behind a big basket banked
  high with daffodils and narcissi&mdash;the placards bore the magic slogan
  <span class="smcap">"Lincolnshire Favourite Coughing"</span>&mdash;the vernal
  equinox had swung to Camden Town.</p>

  <p>"If people would act honourable," said Mr. Evans, "this would be a grand
  world to live in. As William Shakespeare, the well-known and highly popular
  poet, says, 'What a game it is!' and he was right."</p>

  <p>"Broke?" asked The Miller, with a certain hard sympathy.</p>

  <p>Yet he did not look broke. Mr. Evans for once was dressed up to his
  position. His moustache was trimmed, his collar was clean, and only an expert
  could see where he had scissored the frayed edges. A ready-made cravat was
  embellished by a jewel that might have been a ruby worth a couple of thousand
  pounds, but probably wasn't.</p>

  <p>"To pieces," said Educated Evans, and shrugged his hock- bottle shoulders.
  "When you re'lise that I sent out the winner of the Newbury Hurdle to three
  thousan' nine hundred and forty clients, and that all I had back for my
  trouble was twelve bob and a 'slush' ten-shillin' note that I nearly got
  penal servitude for passin', you understand why men like the celebrated Sir
  Francis Columbus went an' lived in America."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you see Lammer&mdash;he's a pal of yours?"</p>

  <p>Evans screwed up his face in contempt.</p>

  <p>"I never 'touch' a client," he said, and spoke the amazing truth.</p>

  <p>"Why are you waiting here?" asked The Miller after a long silence.
  "Lookin' for anybody? By the way, you haven't seen Nosey Erman about, have
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," said Evans. "that feller's less than the dust to me, to
  use a well-known expression."</p>

  <p>"I wonder why he's turned up in Camden Town?" The Miller mused. "He's got
  some game on, I'll bet."</p>

  <p>Well Mr. Evans knew the game of the wanderer. He had returned to filch the
  heart of an innocent girl&mdash;the sharp eyes of the educated man had
  detected the amorous Nosey. His exposure was accomplished.</p>

  <p>The Miller pulled at his long nose, and then:</p>

  <p>"Come round to my lodgings this afternoon and I'll hand you a pound," he
  said as he prepared to go. "But don't come if you can tap anybody else."</p>

  <p>Between gratitude and sardonic mirth at the prospect of tapping anybody
  Mr. Evans was slightly incoherent.</p>

  <p>Long after The Miller had gone he waited, and presently his vigil was
  rewarded.</p>

  <p>A slim, neatly dressed girl walked quickly up Bayham Street and turned
  towards the High Street. In an instant Educated Evans was flying across the
  roadway, and at the sound of his voice the girl turned with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mr. Evans," she said, "I thought you were at Cheltenham!"</p>

  <p>"My car broke down," said Mr. Evans mendaciously. "The carburetter keeps
  on back-firing: for two pins I'd send it back to old Rolls and give him a bit
  of me mind!"</p>

  <p>He fell in by her side, and for two minutes fifty-five seconds and a few
  fifths he trod on air, and his heart sang comic songs.</p>

  <p>Just short of Lammer's Corner she stopped and held out her hand with a
  sigh.</p>

  <p>"You are lucky, Mr. Evans," she said enviously. "It must be wonderful to
  be your own master: to go where you like and how you like. I wish I had a lot
  of money.</p>

  <p>Evans wished the same thing as fervently, but he did not say so.</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew what was going to win that big race at Cheltenham," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Benny's Hope," replied Evans promptly. "I had it from the owner, who's a
  personal friend of mine. That horse could fall down, get up, turn round to
  see what was going to be last, and then win."</p>

  <p>"Benny's Hope," she said thoughtfully, and then: "I've got that souvenir
  for you, Mr. Evans," she said. "You wouldn't think I was fast if I brought it
  round to your flat one night, would you?"</p>

  <p>And before he realised it, she had disappeared through the ornamental
  portals of Lammer's High-Class Drapers and Ladies' Outfitters.</p>

  <p>Evans walked thoughtfully back to his apartment, planning matrimony.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Educated Evans got out of bed and slipped on his dressing- gown, which was
  also his overcoat, an extra blanket, and on occasions a mackintosh. The hour
  was seven; outside in the dark mews rain was falling steadily.</p>

  <p>It was not an hour at which one might expect the most enthusiastic of
  clients would call upon the World's Champion. In truth, of late, Evans had
  found his erstwhile clientele somewhat sceptical of his information even when
  he sought them out.</p>

  <p>He lit the oil lamp and opened the door. There was nobody in sight, and
  then he heard a sound, and, stooping, lifted the long basket that stood on
  the landing and carried it into the room.</p>

  <p>"Good Gawd!" said Evans.</p>

  <p>He heard the wail before he opened the lid and saw the solemn eyes staring
  up from the interior of the basket.</p>

  <p>"Good Gawd!" said Evans again.</p>

  <p>He picked up the baby and laid it on the bed, and with a flutter of
  eyelids the tiny mortal went instantly into a sound sleep.</p>

  <p>Evans examined the basket. It bore the label of a local fishmonger and
  smelt strongly of the sea. The World's Champion ran his fingers through his
  hair and strove to recover his composure. And then he heard a heavy step upon
  the stairs, and the door opened to reveal a figure in a shiny mackintosh.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Mr. Challoner&mdash;come in."</p>

  <p>The straw between The Miller's teeth was soddened with rain, and as he
  stood in the room near the door, tiny rivulets of water dripped hurriedly to
  the floor.</p>

  <p>Without any preliminary</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mrs. Erman&mdash;a pasty-faced girl with goggly eyes?"</p>

  <p>I don't&mdash;" began Evans.</p>

  <p>"You got her a job at Lammer's," said The Miller sharply. "I knew she was
  staying here with her aunt, and I came down to make sure the other night, but
  I never dreamt she'd plant herself on you. She was hanging round here for
  something, but I couldn't guess what it was."</p>

  <p>Evans was pale, his mouth wide open.</p>

  <p>"Wha's&mdash;wha's happened?" he croaked, and The Miller laughed
  unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>"To-night they cleared Lammer's safe and made a get-away. We'll be able to
  pick them up because she's got a baby."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans opened his mouth again and tried to speak, blinked
  impotently and tried again.</p>

  <p>"Miss Develle....</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Erman," corrected The Miller, and his eyes fell upon the little
  slumberer.</p>

  <p>"Yours?" he asked, and Educated Evans shook his head, speechless.</p>

  <p>The Miller walked across the room and examined the child. He saw what
  Evans in his agitation had failed to see. A card tied to the baby's wrist by
  a piece of pink ribbon, and the card was inscribed:</p>

  <p class="cp">A little sooveneer."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Erman was good at figures, but her spelling left much to be
  desired.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>III. &mdash; THE MAKER OF WINNERS</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Miller would have passed the crowd at the corner of
  College Street, only the voice that emerged from the centre of the throng had
  a familiar ring, and he edged his way into the press with no great
  difficulty, for certain of the audience recognised Detective-Sergeant
  Challoner and were passionately desirous that the recognition should not be
  mutual.</p>

  <p>In the midst of a cleared circle was a thin iron rod held by a small and
  dirty-faced boy, and attached to the rod by a gallows bracket was a
  spluttering naphtha lamp. And round and round the clear space in the middle
  of the crowd walked a man who was jockey from the waist up. The colours were
  familiar to The Miller. He had seen them to the fore on the day Weathervane
  won the Royal Hunt Cup and when London Cry won at Goodwood. Though the great
  owner of the colours had recently changed His trainer, there was no evidence
  that He had engaged Educated Evans as first jockey to the stables.</p>

  <p>The tipster had a bundle of cards in one hand, a riding whip in the other;
  his jockey cap was a little too big for him, and the peak flopped down over
  his nose, and all that The Miller could see was a fringe of ragged moustache,
  the tip of a stubby nose and an unshaven chin....</p>

  <p>"... And let me tell you people who know me far and wide that a man of my
  education wouldn't go lowerin' hisself to appear in public like the famous
  Lady Gawdiva who rode through the streets of London with nothin' on to settle
  a bet, if it wasn't that I can't letcher miss the most unbeatable certainty
  that ever looked through a bridle. Did I give yer Salmon Trout? Did I beg an'
  implore yer to back Charley's Mount&mdash;did I go down on my knees to yer
  and say 'Whatever y'do, don't leave out Twelve Pointer for the
  Cambridge'&mdash;did I tell you what his twelve points was...?"</p>

  <p>The Miller waited through another quarter of an hour's eloquence; waited
  till Mr. Evans had stripped his royal livery and resumed his coat. And
  then:</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised to hear you telling the tale, Evans."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans shrugged his narrow shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It's common, I admit&mdash;but I got to work up my connections, Mr.
  Challoner. Competition's done it. Old Sam got my best customers. You wouldn't
  think that old pub-lizard could compete with a man like me. Why, I could talk
  him blind, Mr. Challoner. Where's his education? Could he put a letter
  together like me? Could he get a job like I got&mdash;a hundred pound job
  with lashin's of money besides? No! That old Sam is a low, uneducated
  pub-prop! But I got him. He's goin' for Lapwing to win the Newbury Cup, an'
  the horse don't run. I've had it from the boy that does him. Ice Box is a
  certainty&mdash;tried twenty-one pound better than Blue Nose. He'll come home
  alone."</p>

  <p>The Miller walked on until they came to the corner of Stibbington
  Street.</p>

  <p>"I don't fancy Ice Box," he said then.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"Could you fancy Twelve Pointer with six stun three? Could you fancy
  Pharos, the property of the celebrated Sir Derby, with no weight at
  all&mdash;that's Ice Box at 7-5!"</p>

  <p>Again The Miller was thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I saw you with a swell in Euston Road this afternoon&mdash;friend of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>Educated Evans looked important, coughed knowledgably and patently avoided
  the topic.</p>

  <p>"He's an acquaintance&mdash;good-night, Mr. Challoner."</p>

  <p>"Hold hard: who is this lad you were with?" asked The Miller. "Got an idea
  I know him."</p>

  <p>"He's a doctor," said Educated Evans briefly. "Doctor Walling&mdash;a
  client."</p>

  <p>He seemed disinclined for further discussion. The Miller watched him
  turning back towards Bayham Street, his colours under his arm, using his whip
  as a walking-stick, and then of a sudden the officer of the law forgot that
  there was such a person in the world as Educated Evans, For, glancing idly up
  at the dark facia of a house, he saw the figure of a man walk carefully along
  a parapet and disappear into a top window.</p>

  <p>It was a large house and respectable. It was owned by a Mr. Opes, a
  builder, who lived on the premises and had his workshops in what had once
  been his back garden.</p>

  <p>The Miller crossed the road and presently a uniformed constable appeared.
  There was a brief consultation and the policeman went off to telephone for a
  few reserves.</p>

  <p>Waiting until he had returned, the sergeant went up to the door and
  knocked; it was opened by a small maid-servant, who told him that nobody was
  home but she: the family was at the Bedford music-hall. After he had
  explained who he was, and had supported the young lady, who never before had
  felt that she could throw a faint in such safe and agreeable circumstances,
  he went upstairs and found, hidden in a cupboard, William Henry Smith, by
  trade a painter, by inclination a small-time burglar. By which is meant that
  he compared with real burglars as a street singer compares with
  Tetrazzini.</p>

  <p>"It's a cop&mdash;I'll go quiet," said the philosophical William in plain
  English. "I rumbled you as soon as I took a screw through the winder. When I
  got my lamps on you I knew you was a busy. What'll I get&mdash;a
  laggin'?"</p>

  <p>"Hope for the best," said The Miller, as he snapped handcuffs on the man
  (William sometimes changed his mind about going quietly).</p>

  <p>As they walked to the station:</p>

  <p>"I have to work for <i>my</i> livin'," said William Henry Smith bitterly.
  "I'm not like this here Educated Evans, that can go tellin' the tale an' the
  police not so much as clout him!"</p>

  <p>One of the standing grievances of the criminal classes is the immunity of
  the non-criminal classes.</p>

  <p>"What has Evans done to you?" asked The Miller, who was a tireless seeker
  after knowledge.</p>

  <p>William Henry thought hard and could find no offence in the Educated
  Man&mdash;at least no offence that he could put into words at that
  moment.</p>

  <p>"He's unlucky," he said. " It's well known all over Camden Town that if
  you have anything to do with Educated Evans you'll have bad luck. An' why I
  did a bust at that so-and-so taller chandler's house, when I've got a hundred
  pound job to do for a gent, I don't know," he added in despair. "When I come
  out of my house to have a stroll round I'd got no more idea of bustin' that
  house than I had of flyin'&mdash;I must be gettin' childish. But the fact is,
  Miller, I can't resist paripits. If I see a paripit rennin' round a house
  I've got to get up to it..."</p>

  <p>He expatiated on the lure of parapets and threw in a remark or two about
  the temptation of pantry windows, and The Miller listened with great
  forbearance.</p>

  <p>"What was this hundred pound job you were going to do?" he asked, during a
  pause in Mr. Smith's homily.</p>

  <p>But William Henry Smith was no Squeaker.</p>

  <p>"You said you were going to do a hundred pound job for a gentleman," said
  The Miller patiently. "What's the good of being silly?&mdash;I'm your best
  friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But William Henry was deep in his gloomy thoughts.</p>

  <p>"And there was a hundred pound job waiting for me," he repeated moodily.
  "A hundred pound sweet. No risk, and, in a manner of speaking, quite lawful.
  But the moment I knew Educated Evans was in it I ought to have run away from
  London, I ought indeed, Miller."</p>

  <p>"Was he in it?" asked The Miller, as they turned into a street where the
  blue lamp of the station house gleamed mournfully.</p>

  <p>"He was and he wasn't," was the cryptic reply. "He was, and yet he didn't
  know he was, if you understand me rightly? He's unlucky, that feller.
  Tipster! Why, he couldn't tip a load of dirt into a shell-hole, that
  feller!"</p>

  <p>William Henry had once served in the Labour Corps in France, and his
  illustrations were occasionally of a military character.</p>

  <p>When The Miller had seen his guest safely housed, and had furnished the
  station sergeant with a number of uncomplimentary particulars about William
  Henry and his past and hopeless future, he strolled home to his lodgings in
  Great College Street, a very thoughtful man.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans had spoken about a hundred pounds&mdash;William Henry
  Smith, painter, had also spoken of a hundred pounds. Was it a coincidence
 ...?</p>

  <p>There was at this time a celebrated race-horse named Digger Lad. He was
  trained in the north, and, for some extraordinary reason, he was a good
  horse. Everybody knows that good horses are not trained in the north. If
  Ormonde had been sent to a stable in Yorkshire he would have become
  automatically a selling plater. He would have looked round, taken a screw at
  the pitheads and chimneys, listened bewildered to one of the stable boys
  saying, "Tha knows lad an' all," and would have immediately developed boils,
  strangles and infantile rickets. But Digger Lad was a good horse. Even
  Newmarket, which, according to the touts, is entirely populated by horses
  that could win the Derby in a bad year, admitted that Digger Lad was a good
  horse, and that, if he'd only been trained in Newmarket, he would have been
  an aeroplane.</p>

  <p>He was favourite for the City and Suburban. That is to say, he was
  favourite with everybody except the bookmakers, who had laid him at all
  prices from 50-1 to 9-4. With them, he was no more favourite than measles in
  a girls' school.</p>

  <p>As Mr. Evans walked home to Sansovino House, his educated brain was
  occupied by thoughts of Digger Lad, that wonderful horse, and it is a
  remarkable tribute to his self-control that, though the name had trembled on
  the very tip of his tongue, he had made no reference to this animal of
  quality.</p>

  <p>Unconscious of the doubt that he had raised in the minds of the
  constabulary, he reached Sansovino House, which was a room over a stable in
  Bayham Mews, unlocking the door, locked it again, pulling up the ruins of a
  mat to keep the room airtight, and lighting his oil lamp, began to put on
  evening dress. Which meant that after a sluice in a pint and a half of water,
  he changed into a pair of check trousers, put on a nearly clean collar, an
  Ascot tie (embellished with a large golden pin in the shape of a horseshoe,
  which is popularly supposed to bring great luck to the wearer), and, rubbing
  his boots with a towel to raise a polish, he found the white bowler hat he
  had purchased for a mere song, rubbed a bit of dry pipeclay over the stains,
  and, taking down a pair of yellow wash-leather gloves from the line, fitted
  one with some difficulty upon his left hand, for they had shrunk in the
  process; and, after finding his walking-stick, which was under the bed, he
  blew out the lamp and went forth, a model of sartorial sportiness.</p>

  <p>A penny 'bus took him to the Oxford Street end of Tottenham Court Road,
  alive at this hour with throngs of the idle rich who had just been turned out
  of the cinema houses. Passing through Soho Square, he came to a small
  restaurant, into which he turned. It was at the moment inhabited by a stout
  French lady in a dirty apron and a well-dressed man who sat at one of the
  tables drinking coffee. He turned his head as Evans appeared and nodded him
  to a chair opposite.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, doctor," said Educated Evans languidly, as he handed his
  stick to the waiter, who handed it back to him. "Sorry I'm so late. But a
  couple of members of the Jockey Club called at my diggings, and I couldn't
  get rid of 'em. They didn't half rap about the way the turf's going from bad
  to worse. One of 'em&mdash;Lord X.: I won't tell you his name because he
  wouldn't like it&mdash;said to me: 'Evans, speaking as a man of education and
  knowledge&mdash;' "</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the other testily. "Sit down. What'll you take? It's too
  late for a drink."</p>

  <p>"Coffee," said Evans indifferently. "I've been drinking champagne all the
  night till I'm sick of the sight of a tumbler. As I was saying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was expecting another gentleman to come to-night&mdash;a friend of
  mine," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>He was a thin-faced man with eyes that never kept still.</p>

  <p>"But I will tell you before he comes what I want you to do. Do you know
  Wilmer's in King's Cross?"</p>

  <p>"The livery and bait stable?"</p>

  <p>"That is the place," said the doctor. "You told me you were willing to
  earn a hundred."</p>

  <p>Evans nodded dumbly. He was willing to earn ten shillings at that
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Now I have told you before, and I'll tell you again, the strength of the
  situation," said the shifty-eyed man, sucking at the stub of an unlighted
  cigar. "I'm one of the connections of Digger Lad."</p>

  <p>Again Mr. Evans nodded, this time almost humbly. The very thought that he
  was hobnobbing with "connections" was overpowering.</p>

  <p>"Digger Lad is arriving from the north to-night, and goes on to Epsom
  to-morrow," said the doctor, slowly and emphatically. "He has had a tiring
  journey&mdash;you know what horses are."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"As a owner and trainer," said the World's Best Tipster, "I understand 'em
  inside and outside, up and down, this way and that way, so to speak. As the
  celebrated George III. said to the well-known Duke of Wellington, the highly
  renowned officer in the Army&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about the Duke of Wellington," said the doctor, who was
  disinclined at the moment to listen to any other voice than his own. "The
  point is that the owner doesn't want this horse"&mdash;he looked round and
  lowered his voice &mdash;"doped!" he hissed.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans bit his lip and looked profound.</p>

  <p>"But he's got to be doped or he won't win," the doctor went on. "The
  owner's a personal friend of mine, but I've got to look after him for his own
  good, if you understand me?"</p>

  <p>Educated Evans did not understand.</p>

  <p>"Here's the stuff," said the doctor, put his hand in his pocket and took
  out what looked to be like a tiny jam tin. He prised up the sunken lid with a
  coin and displayed a brown treacly mass.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine will get the stable open, and all you've got to do is to
  get into the box, put your finger in that and let him lick it."</p>

  <p>"Suppose he bites me?" said Evans, a cold shiver running down his
  back.</p>

  <p>"Bite you!" said the other contemptuously. "You understand horses, don't
  you? Horses don't bite, they suck!"</p>

  <p>"But they've got teeth," said the obstinate Evans. "I've seen 'em?"</p>

  <p>"They never use them," said the veterinary authority. "Are you game?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was rather white by now. He coughed, looked helplessly up at the
  fly-blown ceiling.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's all right," he said uneasily. "I mean there's nothing
  wrong in it?"</p>

  <p>"Should I&mdash;me a doctor of medicine and all&mdash;ask you to do
  anything that wasn't right?" demanded the reproachful doctor.</p>

  <p>But Evans was not happy.</p>

  <p>"How about getting into the stable?"</p>

  <p>"He'll be taken to Wilmers' the moment he arrives to- morrow." The doctor
  spoke with great rapidity. "The boys will go away to get a cup of coffee, and
  they'll lock the stable door. A friend of mine's going to open it&mdash;he'd
  have done the whole job, only he don't understand horses."</p>

  <p>The doctor might have added that he himself would have done the whole job
  but his ignorance of the thoroughbred race-horse was almost as colossal as
  William Henry Smith's.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans took the treacle pot, put on the lid slowly and dropped it
  into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"What time is this other fellow coming?" he asked faintly.</p>

  <p>That was exactly the question the doctor was asking himself for he knew
  nothing about the unhappy ending to William Henry's stroll.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said. "Meet me here at seven to- morrow."</p>

  <p>The future was brighter for Mr. Evans than he had dared confess. None,
  seeing the man commonly, indeed vulgarly, declaiming to a circle of
  incredulous punters, would have imagined that fortune had again tapped
  timidly on his front door.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smiled to himself as he clumped up the wooden stairs that led to
  the very door on which the fairy fingers of fortune had danced. What a
  triumph would be his when it came out that Educated Evans <i>was in with the
  owners!</i></p>

  <p>Old Sam...! Educated Evans grinned diabolically at the thought of his
  rival's discomfiture. That beer-burdened snake in the grass!</p>

  <p>He blew in the end of his big key, inserted it in the lock and tried to
  turn it. But it was already turned: he had, in fact, forgotten to lock the
  door when he went out, and it was unfastened. He pushed open the door and
  stood paralysed with horror and indignation.</p>

  <p>The oil lamp was burning smokily, and by its light lie saw there was a man
  in the room. An ancient man with a prismatic beard. He sat in a chair, his
  hands clasped on his waistcoat, his mouth open, his eyes closed.</p>

  <p>2 a.m.! Mr. Evans almost choked. Possibly he made appropriate noises. Old
  Sam opened one eye and waved a feeble hand.</p>

  <p>"Come in... Evansh! Take a sheat... wasyours?"</p>

  <p>Evans strode into the room, his eyes glaring.</p>

  <p>"Outside!" he hissed. " 'Op it, you ale-eatin' perisher! You are not
  satisfied, you uneducated old 'ound, with takin' the bread out of my mouth,
  but you come a-trespassin' in my house!"</p>

  <p>Old Sam surveyed him glassily.</p>

  <p>" 'Tain't a house, it's an aylorft," he said, and for a moment Educated
  Evans thought he was talking a foreign language.</p>

  <p>The man was intoxicated. Evans shuddered at the pollution brought upon
  Sansovino House. And not only was he intoxicated, but he was truculently so,
  and, surveying him, a doubt crept into Mr. Evans's mind. He was old but
  muscular, and under the stimulus of strong drink old men have done terrible
  things. Educated Evans coughed, and his tone grew more conciliatory.</p>

  <p>"You can't stay here, Sam," he said mildly. " I've got to get to bed."</p>

  <p>Old Sam stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"I'm staying here," he said with great deliberation, "till to-morrer. I
  got pinched over you, and you went and give away a stable secret what I got
  from the boy that done him. To-morrer, you uneducated man "&mdash;Evans
  gasped and turned even paler&mdash;" I'm sendin' out a tip that'll knock you
  silly, and I'm stayin' here to see that you don't get ahead of me."</p>

  <p>"But, Sam," said the agitated Mr. Evans, in an even more friendly tone,
  "you can't stay here, old man. I've got one of my clients coming up to see me
  here tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Old Sam. "Your client! Walker the fishmonger. He owes! I've
  come for an explanation."</p>

  <p>He found the word rather difficult to say, but eventually said it.</p>

  <p>"When I lay in the cold prison cell&mdash;at my time of life too&mdash;I
  thought I'd come out and cut your throat&mdash;give us something to eat. I'm
  starving."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans was being ordered about in his own house.</p>

  <p>"My dear old Sammy," he said, "as the celebrated Michael Angelo said to
  the well-known Lewdcreature Burgia, it can't be done."</p>

  <p>And to demonstrate the absurdity of the whole situation, Evans took off
  his coat, hung it on a peg, as though, whatever happened, he was going to
  bed.</p>

  <p>"Want to fight, do you!" roared Old Sam, and staggering to his unsteady
  feet reached for the first missile which came to his hand, which was Mr.
  Evans' small but hard poker.</p>

  <p>No horse that Educated Evans ever tipped moved faster than the World's
  Champion Prophet and Turf Adviser.</p>

  <p>The Miller, strolling towards High Street, saw a shivering man in his
  shirt sleeves standing at the end of the mews.</p>

  <p>"... Half an hour ago," explained Evans tremulously. " Come into my house
  and threatened to murder me! After all I've done for him! The four ale I've
  stood him! The perishin' old beer-biter!"</p>

  <p>"Come along with me," said The Miller authoritatively. "We'll deal with
  this Trojan. What's this great tip of his for to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't tell me," said Evans, with some asperity. "And what's more, if
  he did I wouldn't take the slightest notice of it." They mounted the steps
  together. The lamp was still burning when Evans opened the door, and Old Sam
  was seated at the table and was talking drowsily to himself.... Nothing to
  eat in this 'ole," he mumbled, "only bread and golden surrop, and he carries
  <i>that</i> round in his coat pocket!"</p>

  <p>A cut loaf was before him, and a small open tin. There was also a
  half-eaten slice of bread covered thickly with a brown, treacly
  substance.</p>

  <p>Evans did not faint, but somehow he knew that Old Sam would not be in a
  position on the following day to give a tip, good, bad, or indifferent.</p>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; A JUDGE OF RACING</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Honourable Mr. Justice Bellfont was a very human man
  with a wide knowledge of human affairs. If the name of Carslake had been
  mentioned in his court, he would not have said, "Who is Brownie Carslake?"
  but would have told you the position Brownie occupied in last year's list of
  winning jockeys, and his lowest riding weight. If he did not tell the court
  this aloud, he would have exposed his knowledge <i>sotto voce</i>, for he had
  the habit of speaking his thoughts aloud.</p>

  <p>On Saturday meetings you could see him at Kempton or Hurst, and he had
  even been known to journey north to witness the field in the Manchester
  November Handicap emerge from the fog. He had a cousin who owned horses and a
  nephew who trained them. He was, in the sense of experience and knowledge,
  the widest judge that ever sent a lad for a stretch.</p>

  <p>He loved horses, and even in the days when he was a prosperous junior,
  never had more than a pound each way on Ormonde. And if there wasn't a horse
  relatively as good as Ormonde in the field he did not bet at all.</p>

  <p>He had a notoriously tender place for the little thief, and a hard surface
  for the clever financiers who came at rare intervals before him, and his
  terse "You will be kept in penal servitude for seven years," had brought
  distress to many a family which was living in luxury on the doings that papa
  had extracted from poor investors.</p>

  <p>Therefore it was, in a sense, an act of providence that Water Holl came
  before him&mdash;for Walter, though a tea-leaf, was a good fellow and a
  well-meaning man.</p>

  <p>In the clear grey of morning, before the shops are open and whilst yet
  milkmen are lying in their beds, Camden Town is a place of solemn splendour,
  and even her public-houses have an especial dignity. Save for a belated cat
  or so making its weary way homewards after a night spent in reckless
  debauchery, nothing human moved in High Street. The drone of a distant
  newspaper van chug-chugging to Euston, the twitter of the birds in Bayham
  Street and the distant hoot of a goods engine at the Midland Goods Station,
  are the only sounds that break the sylvan stillness.</p>

  <p>The Miller had spent the night profitably in conducting a raid upon a
  snide factory just off Ossulton Street, and now, at peace with mankind, he
  stood surveying the desert of High Street.</p>

  <p>A figure came shuffling round a corner, saw him instantly and faded out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>The Miller did not move: seemingly he had not seen the wayfarer. Presently
  the furtive man peeped round the corner, saw his enemy standing apparently
  oblivious of his presence, and, turning, walked back the way he had come,
  satisfied that justice was happily blind.</p>

  <p>Mr. Walter Holl would have found it difficult to run, for he carried in
  his cloth bag a large quantity of lead piping and brass taps that he had
  acquired in the earlier hours of the morning from an untenanted house in the
  Holloway Road.</p>

  <p>He was half-way back to Great College Street when he heard the softest
  sound behind him, and turned to meet The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Lord! Mr. Challoner, you give me a fright! Them rubber soles of yourn
  ain't half quiet "</p>

  <p>"Been shopping?" asked The Miller pleasantly, his eyes upon the bulging
  bag.</p>

  <p>"Them?" Mr. Holl asked innocently as he opened the bag and displayed his
  loot. "They belong to a friend of mine, a plumber. He's goin' up to Scotland
  to do a job an' he asked me to bring the bag to the station for
  him&mdash;gave me a bob to do it. You see, Mr. Challoner, he got soused last
  night an'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come along and have a cup of coffee at the station," said The Miller,
  "and we'll talk over old times. How long ago is it since I took you for
  'busting' empty houses, Holl? Must be nearly three years."</p>

  <p>Mr. Holl fell in by his side, The Miller's hand affectionately gripping
  his arm.</p>

  <p>"It's a cop," said Walter, with the philosophy of his kind. "I got these
  out of a house in the Holloway Road&mdash;Number 804, or maybe 408. It's hard
  luck on me, because I was goin' to get a packet out of Telltale in the
  Victoria Cup. I've been workin' honest for two years, but what with this here
  unemployment an' Lloyd George bein' the Gover'ment, an honest man can't make
  a living."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lloyd George has been out of office for years," said The Miller, and
  Walter sneered.</p>

  <p>"This choppin' an' changin' of gover'ments is the ruin of the workin'
  classes," he stated.</p>

  <p>At the police station he was searched; before he was put into the cells he
  asked a special favour.</p>

  <p>"I'd be very much obliged, Mr. Challoner, if you'd ask Educated Evans to
  put a piece together for me, so as, when I go in front of the old bubble an'
  squeak, I've got, so to speak, a full answer?"</p>

  <p>"Can't you afford a mouthpiece?" asked the sympathetic Miller, referring
  in this crude way to a gentleman learned in the law.</p>

  <p>"Mouthpiece!" Walter was scornful. "Why, all these so-and- so lawyers 'ang
  together. Why, I see a picture the other day of Marshall 'All an' Courteous
  Bennett walkin' arm an' arm together&mdash;and they was on different sides in
  a murder! No so-and-so lawyers for me!"</p>

  <p>"Moderate your language," said The Miller. " I'll tell Evans, though I
  don't know what he can do for you except to tip that you'll get time. In
  which case you'll probably get off."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans, of Tapin House, Bayham Mews (he had a disconcerting habit
  of renaming his residence after big race winners) was indeed a friend to the
  poor and afflicted, in addition to being the World's Greatest Turf
  Adviser.</p>

  <p>And at that moment he was riding on the crest of a wave.</p>

  <p>Camden Town, which had lost confidence in the man and the prophet, was
  slowly regaining its faith. For had he not given in rapid succession:</p>

  <p class="cp">Argo! What a beauty!<br>
  Argo! What a beauty!<br>
  Argo! What a beauty!</p>

  <p class="first">together with:</p>

  <p class="cp">Mr. Clever! What a beauty!<br>
  Mr. Clever! What a beauty!<br>
  Mr. Clever! What a beauty!</p>

  <p class="first">to quote his own admirable literature.</p>

  <p>It was rumoured (mainly by Mr. Evans) that the West End bookmakers were
  panic-stricken. People had come to his flat and paid him real money to
  encourage him in his good work.</p>

  <p>The Miller walked up the wooden stairs which led to Tapin House, and found
  one who described himself immodestly as "The Wizard of Camden Town," engaged
  in the study of the next day's programme. Evans received him gravely&mdash;as
  a man of property would receive a bailiff, or a successful author a reviewer;
  in other words, as somebody who was respected but did not count.</p>

  <p>Briefly The Miller explained the reason for his visit, Evans shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I've given up writin' out defences for common people," he said. " I'm too
  busy, as the well-known Sir Francis Drakes said to the soldier when he was
  teachin' the young princes in the Tower to say their twice-times table. What
  with owners an' trainers an' what not writin' to ask me not to tip their
  horses, an' what with me correspondents at Lambourn, Newmarket an' Epsom
  sendin' me yards an' yards of winners, I've got no time to disgrace meself
  with Walter Holl. What's he done?"</p>

  <p>The Miller told him, and Mr. Evans made an impatient sound.</p>

  <p>"The man was certainly a client of mine in the past, but whether he acted
  honourable or not I can't tell till I've seen me books. I'll see what I can
  do."</p>

  <p>"What is going to win the Gatwick Handicap?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Blue Nose," said Evans indifferently. " I'm not troublin' about that
  race&mdash;it's too easy. Give me somethin' hard, like the Victoria Cup."</p>

  <p>"Blue Nose?" queried The Miller. Evans went to his bed, turned the pillow
  and produced a letter.</p>

  <p>Read that," he commanded.</p>

  <p>The Miller read.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">DEAR SIR,</p>

  <p class="letter">With reference to your inquiry, Blue Nose has done no work
  for six months and has a very bad leg.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours faithfully,</p>

  <p class="letter">H. HAGGITT.</p><br>

  <p>"That Haggitt," said Evans profoundly, "couldn't tell the truth to his
  doctor. What's more, he owes me one. So I wrote to him, knowin' that whatever
  he sent me would be a lie. Blue Nose is money for nothin'. Help yourself an'
  don't forget I've got to pay rates an' taxes."</p>

  <p>The Miller was impressed.</p>

  <p>"Telltale will win the Victoria Cup," he hazarded.</p>

  <p>Here The Miller voiced the opinion commonly held by all keen racing men.
  For Telltale had, so to speak, been flung into the handicap. He had been left
  (also, so to speak) ten minutes in the Newbury Cup and had been beaten a
  short head by a great horse. Ardent sportsmen in Camden Town were going down
  to Hurst Park in a fortnight's time to place their underwear at the disposal
  of the receptive bookmakers, and, if the truth be told, Mr. Walter Holl's
  divers larcenies and felonies had been performed or committed with the object
  of getting a little stock of money to invest in this gilt-edged security.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans scratched his nose.</p>

  <p>"He <i>ought</i> to win it," he admitted. "He ought to be able to fall
  down an' get up an' then win. But them bookmakers won't lay more than twoses
  an' more likely it'll be six ter four on the field an' twenty to one bar two.
  And that don't pay me an' my clients."</p>

  <p>He looked round cautiously, though there was no danger of being
  overheard.</p>

  <p>"You're in the lore, Mr. Challoner; what about Dum Spyro? He's trained by
  Falston&mdash;he's the nephew of Lord What's-his-name, the highly celebrated
  judge."</p>

  <p>"You mean Mr. Justice Bellfont?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"That's him. Don't you ever get any tips at Scotlan' Yard? Don't judges
  put things in your way&mdash;they ought to. Where would they be without
  busies?"</p>

  <p>The Miller chuckled.</p>

  <p>"The judge doesn't give tips, you poor miserable man!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was deep in thought.</p>

  <p>"If I thought Dum Spyro was on the job I'd take him to beat the fav'rite.
  But that Falston's so close that he's stuck together. He don't bet, but he
  wouldn't tell his own wife where he kept his shirts; he's that tight you
  couldn't open him with a pickaxe."</p>

  <p>The Miller went away and brooded on the immediate problem of Blue Nose. He
  was, in a way, slightly amused by the perverted reasoning of the World's
  Premier Turf Prophet. So was the station-sergeant and several form- studying
  constables. When Blue Nose won that afternoon by the length of a street they
  were slightly annoyed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans spent the greater part of the evening composing an address which
  Walter could read from the dock. He had composed many such: generally
  speaking, they began in very much the same strain.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"May it please your Worship. It was said by the celebrated
  Shakespeare, 'The quantity of Mercy is not strange,' therefore I ask your
  worship, in the terrible position I find myself, an innocent man dragged
  ruthfully to the bar of justice, to take a lenient view of a mere bagatelle
  committed under the influence of drink, that well-known curse."</p><br>

  <p>The three hours spent in this labour were, however, so much wasted time,
  as he learned on attending the police court the next morning.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, Evans," said The Miller, but this will be an Old Bailey case. We
  found a lot of stolen property in his house, and he is certain to be
  fullied.* He tells me he did a bit of work for you in the past two
  years?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Fully committed for trial.]</p>

  <p>This was true. Mr. Holl had earned many an odd shilling. He had run a few
  errands, scrubbed the educated man's floor, and once had distempered the
  walls of his bed-sitting-working room.</p>

  <p>"If you go up before the judge and say a few words for him, you might save
  him a lagging," suggested The Miller&mdash;a scheme which at first filled the
  World's Champion with quaking fear, but which afterwards had certain
  attractions.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans had participated in many police court proceedings, but he
  had never yet attained to the distinction of making an official appearance at
  the Old Bailey.</p>

  <p>By great good fortune, Mr. Holl was fullied in time to catch next week's
  sitting of the Central Criminal Court. Kind friends, one and all, whipped
  round to supply the funds necessary to secure the services of that eminent
  barrister-at-law, Mr. Chubblechine, a very young man who knew just as much of
  the world as can be viewed from the quad of Caius College, Cambridge, and
  Pump Court, E.C.4. Educated Evans, wearing his check trousers and nearly gold
  horseshoe tiepin, his almost white bowler hat on the side of his head,
  strolled into the hall of the Old Bailey, the observed of all observers.</p>

  <p>"It's curious, Mr. Miller," he said modestly, "how a feller gets known.
  All them people know me... I'm, so to speak, the sinicure of all eyes."</p>

  <p>"They think you're Woddle, the forger, surrendering to his bail," said The
  Miller coldly. "And listen, Evans: when you get up in front of the judge,
  don't talk too much&mdash;it's Bellfont."</p>

  <p>Figuratively speaking, the ears of Educated Evans pricked.</p>

  <p>"The highly famous Lord Bellfont&mdash;him whose nephew trains Dum Spyro?"
  he asked, and The Miller nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's a bit of luck," said Evans thoughtfully. "When he sees the kind of
  man he's got to deal with, I bet he'll ask me into his private room an' have
  a talk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Miller's eye was cold.</p>

  <p>"The only private room you'll ever be asked into," he said, "is one of
  twenty in the basement, which has a lock on it and a peep-hole where the
  warder can see that you're not committing suicide."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Evans was not depressed.</p>

  <p>It was two o'clock that afternoon when Mr. Holl stepped brightly up from
  the bowels of the earth into the dock. He pleaded "Not guilty" in a chirpy
  tone.</p>

  <p>At a quarter to three, Educated Evans walked into the witness-box, and,
  having kissed a strange book, leant negligently on the ledge of the box.</p>

  <p>"You are," said the youthful counsel, "a very well-known sporting
  journalist?"</p>

  <p>Evans was momentarily staggered at this description.</p>

  <p>"In a sense and in a way I am."</p>

  <p>The saturnine figure on the bench glared at him.</p>

  <p>"Are you or aren't you?" he rasped.</p>

  <p>"I am, my dear lord," said Evans, and went on to answer questions which
  were intended to prove, beyond any question of doubt, that Walter Holl was
  between whiles a hard-working man, a good father and a kind and loyal friend.
  The counsel for the prosecution did not even trouble to cross- examine
  him.</p>

  <p>"When you say you are a sporting journalist, what do you mean?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, my dear lord&mdash;" began Evans.</p>

  <p>"There is no need for you to be affectionate," said his lordship.</p>

  <p>"The fact is," said Evans, a little wildly, "I'm what you might term the
  World's Champion Turf Adviser and Pronosticator. I'm the gentleman that gave
  Braxted at 20/1&mdash;what a beauty, dear lord Also Tarpin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;a tipster!"</p>

  <p>It is impossible to convey all the scorn, derision, contempt and
  condemnation in his lordship's tone.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear sir&mdash;my dear lord, I mean&mdash;I'm a prophet. As the
  well-known and highly respected John Bunions, the celebrated composer of
  Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday, said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A tipster!"</p>

  <p>His lordship's lips curled.</p>

  <p>"A prophet an' turf adviser, dear my lord," murmured Evans. "The same
  address for twenty-five years; not one of them gone to-day and come to-morrer
  people. As the far-famed Lord Winston Churchill said, 'Jer swee&mdash;I'm
  here!' "</p>

  <p>The judge leant back in his padded chair; the cold malignity in his eyes
  made Mr. Evans shudder.</p>

  <p>"You infernal rascal!" he muttered. When he was annoyed, he invariably
  spoke his thoughts aloud. "You robber; you ought to be in the dock!"</p>

  <p>And then:</p>

  <p>"You have the audacity to come here to certify a man's character!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear lord," said Evans faintly.</p>

  <p>"You send out your inf&mdash;your prophecies as to what horse will
  win?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear&mdash;my lord." Evans in his terror was swaying in the box.</p>

  <p>"And you have the&mdash;really I&mdash;I am amazed at your audacity! Do
  you profess to be able to predict horses that will win races?"</p>

  <p>Evans nodded&mdash;he hoped respectfully.</p>

  <p>"I believe you are a swindler!" said the judge firmly. "I believe that you
  are obtaining money by false pretences."</p>

  <p>The educated man saw the prison gates yawning wide to receive him. Cold
  perspiration trickled down his nose. The hands that gripped the ledge were
  clammy&mdash;the court spun round him.</p>

  <p>But the unconquerable spirit which is latent in every prophet sustained
  him. In a last desperate effort to justify himself:</p>

  <p>"The fact is, dear old&mdash;dear mister... my lord," he stammered, "it's
  easy. Now take Telltale&mdash;he can't help winnin' the Victoria Cup...."</p>

  <p>"Not a ghost of a chance," muttered his lordship." Not with Dum Spyro in
  the field...."</p>

  <p>So low he spoke that only Evans heard him. Then, aloud, and with a stern
  look in his eye:</p>

  <p>"Stand down, sir!" he said. " The fact that the unfortunate prisoner has
  nothing better in the shape of witnesses than a wretched swindling tipster,
  is proof of his friendlessness."</p>

  <p>He let off Walter with three months' hard.</p>

  <p>Evans staggered out of court like a man in a dream. The Miller spoke to
  him, but he did not hear. In Newgate Street he found a taxi and drove back to
  Bayham Mews.</p>

  <p>That evening, Detective-Sergeant Challoner made one of his frequent calls
  at the Hall of the Prophet, and found Evans in his shirt-sleeves struggling
  with the patent duplicator that a child could work. Round and round the
  little cylinder was turning, and with every revolution there appeared a
  quarto sheet, wet with violet ink. In silence The Miller picked up a sheet
  and read:</p><br>

  <p>"What is the horse?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Dum Spyro," said Evans rapidly. "I had it from Lord Bellfont
  hisself&mdash;didn't you see him give me the wink?"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>V. &mdash; AN AMAZING SELECTION</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE is no doubt at all that Educated Evans had a soft
  place in his heart for ladies. And it is no exaggeration to say that ladies
  had a tender place in their hearts for Educated Evans.</p>

  <p>As Miss Maudie Hallsback (the beautiful barmaid at the "Rose and Crown"}
  used to insist:</p>

  <p>"I don't care what you say, he's a nice man, and the way he lifts his hat
  to you when you meet him out, is a fair treat to see. He may be long-winded,
  and I dessay he is, but there's no getting away from his education."</p>

  <p>"He don't let you," said her gloomy audience; "he fairly rams it down your
  throat! I don't believe harf he says about hist'ry. Take that bit about
  Bloody Mary&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Miss Maudie's cold eyes fixed him.</p>

  <p>"As a bird is known by his note so is a man by his conversation," she said
  pointedly, and left Mr. Lew Figtree spluttering protests.</p>

  <p>It was the same with the beautiful Miss Birdie Rothman&mdash;her that has
  "Birdie" in oriental diamonds right across her chest&mdash;and the same with
  Mrs. Grail, the proprietress of the "Egg and Duck." They all spoke well of
  Educated Evans. He was holding Miss Rothman spellbound one evening.</p>

  <p>"Very few people know," he said, "that the moon is a extinct volcano. How
  it got up in the sky is a problem that's known only to a few of us. Take
  rainbows. Now a lot of people think rainbows are real, but as a matter of
  fact they're an optical illusion. Take Mars: there's canals on Mars owin' to
  there bein' no trains&mdash;everything's got to go by water. Take the
  stars&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lord, Mr. Evans, what a headpiece you've got!" said the awe-stricken
  lady. Educated Evans smiled modestly.</p>

  <p>"It's readin' that does it," he said, "an' experience. Take Camden Town.
  It used to be a wild jungle full of savages that painted their faces with
  wood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's not much better now," retorted the young lady.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans' dearest enemy was one Old Sam, as all the world knows. His age
  was variously computed between seventy and a hundred. He had the appearance
  of one who had been on nodding terms with Noah. If the Biblical parallel be
  permissible, his ark nowadays was the saloon bar of the "Red Lion," whence he
  sent forth his doves full of hope and confidence. This ale-sustained ancient
  had once been the veriest slave of Educated Evans, shuffling about Camden
  Town to execute his orders for a mere tuppence a time. But in the absence of
  Evans, Old Sam had not only blossomed forth as a tipster, usurping the
  position of his master, but had developed, as the result of his lucky pin-
  pricks, an arrogance, indeed a truculence, which ill became one of his
  years.</p>

  <p>"He ought," said Evans bitterly, "to be thinking about another world,
  instead of which he's pinchin' Captain Coe's nap and sendin' it out as
  private information! But I'll do the old perisher! I've got a bit of
  information for the Liverpool Cup from me Epsom correspondent that'll fairly
  put it across him."</p>

  <p>"It occurs to me," said The Miller, "that your style and language have
  deteriorated since your absence from Camden Town."</p>

  <p>Evans coughed, a little embarrassed. Any reflection upon his diction
  touched him nearly and sorely.</p>

  <p>"He's not worth any better. He's a low, uneducated, guzzlin' 'ound!"</p>

  <p>The tenderness of heart which was Educated Evans' especial property,
  together with an increase in the volume of his business, led him, unwisely as
  it proved, to employ an assistant, Mrs. Arabella Bolton, whose husband at the
  time was away in the country: a thin, peaky-faced, discontented woman, with a
  wail against life and against that much of life which sustained her husband
  in his Dartmoor retreat. Evans, who subsequently had reason to be thankful
  for his charity, took her on out of pity, she having in her younger days been
  what is known as a "clerk" at Pinkses, the jam-makers. A client of his had
  told him about the destitute state of Mrs. Bolton, and since at that moment
  there was a great deal of work to be done, Evans sent for her.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I'm much obliged to you Mr. Evings," she exclaimed. "It's very
  good of you I'm sure I was offered a much better job last week but I was that
  sick and ill that I couldn't take it" (she spoke without any commas,
  full-stops or periods, and her speech in some ways resembled an Act of
  Parliament).</p>

  <p>"What with Bolton took away and bringing disgrace on me which my father
  thank God don't know anything about it or he'd turn in his grave and two
  mouths to fill and his relations not allowing me a ha'penny-piece though
  they're well off his father being in the butchering business in Smithfield
  market getting his money out of selling kagmag* to poor people that it's a
  shame what do you want me to do Mr. Evings?"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* kagmag (also cagmag). Nobody seems to know the
  derivation of this synonym for bad meat.]</p>

  <p>Evans explained, and the thin-faced Mrs. Bolton sat down in the one
  rickety chair with a disparaging sneer on her face, and proceeded to open and
  sort out the letters which had arrived by that morning's post as the result
  of an advertisement which, in some miraculous fashion, Educated Evans had
  succeeded in getting into the <i>Sporting Chronicle</i>. Usually the
  <i>Sporting Chronicle</i> is more careful.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bolton lived at Little College Court, which rather suggests the
  shaded quadrangle of some ancient house of learning, but was, in point of
  fact, a cul-de-sac of microscopic houses, where babies were born every day
  and old people died every other week.</p>

  <p>Her next door neighbour was a Mrs. Lube, who had the dubious distinction
  of being the granddaughter of Old Sam, who now lodged with her, and at this
  time was keeping her, her family, her husband and her husband's aunt. The
  prosperity which had come to Old Sam as the result of his miraculous tips was
  advertised in the sparkling rings in Mrs. Lube's ears, and in the magnificent
  wrist-watch she wore when she went to the pictures. She was a great friend of
  Mrs. Bolton's, having troubles of her own, and there were, so to speak, no
  secrets between them.</p>

  <p>"Good Gawd, Mrs. Bolton" said Mrs. Lube, in a hushed voice. "You don't
  mean you're workin' for that old 'ound, the so-called Educated Evans?
  Educated, indeed! Why, he went to a Board School, as everybody knows! Giving
  'isself airs and takin' the bread out of our mouths, so to speak, me an' my
  poor husband, my poor old grandfather, a man of his age, to be cast on the
  world for us to keep!"</p>

  <p>"I've got to live," said Mrs. Bolton, hardly knowing whether she ought to
  defend her employer or admit his delinquencies and deficiencies right off,
  and ready to take either side under provocation.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I don't think no worse of you," Mrs. Lube hastened to assure
  her friend. "But it's a bit lowerin' to have to work for that kind of
  daylight robber."</p>

  <p>"I've got to live," repeated Mrs. Bolton. "What with my old man being put
  away through drink and wimmin as I shall maintain to my dying day and two
  mouths to fill...."</p>

  <p>"Come in and have a cup of tea, Arabella," said Mrs. Lube, as a great idea
  flooded her dull brain.</p>

  <p>And in the best parlour (which was also the only parlour and had been
  newly furnished out of the proceeds of Old Sam's prophecies), they sat down
  and had a good talk&mdash;and Mrs. Lube was an expert pumper.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Mrs. Bolton. Do you mind me seeing my grandfather? He
  usually has a cup of tea and a bloater about now?"</p>

  <p>Mr.. Lube hustled out of the room, went up the narrow stairs and intruded
  herself into Old Sam's bedroom. Here sat the prophet, looking rather like a
  prophet of old. He woke with a start, rubbed his bald head and blinked up at
  his granddaughter. She closed the door carefully, and, in a hoarse whisper,
  passed on the information she had gained.</p>

  <p>"... it's running in the Liverpool Cup on Thursday. He's had it from
  Epsom." Old Sam scratched his bald head.</p>

  <p>"Paddy?" he said thoughtfully. "Never 'eard of the 'orse! Is it a
  'orse?"</p>

  <p>"How do I know, grandfather " rasped Mrs. Lube. "I'll ask Alf when he
  comes<br>
  home."</p>

  <p>"What can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Send it out, grandfather," said this representative of his progeny, who
  was the real manager of the business. "Spread it all over Camden
  Town&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'll do it too," interrupted Old Sam. Mrs. Lube shook her head
  vigorously.</p>

  <p>"No, he won't," she said darkly. "We'll settle his hash, grandfather...
  the low,<br>
  common man, taking the bread and butter out of my dear children's mouth. I'm
  sure it's a struggle to live. If wasn't for Alf's dole, we'd be out of 'ouse
  and 'ome."</p>

  <p>Old Sam sighed. For three months he had been the most popular member of
  the family, but the return of Educated Evans had marked a crisis in his
  affairs.</p>

  <p>"If something ain't done, grandfather," Mrs. Lube went on, and there was a
  note of menace in her voice, "you'll be outside the 'Red Lion' with your back
  against the wall, picking up a penny here and there."</p>

  <p>Old Sam sighed again.</p>

  <p>"Tell Alf to get it printed," he said, and was glad when the door closed
  after this dominating woman.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube's work was not done. A shrewd and thrifty woman, she had put a
  bit by for a rainy day out of the magnificent receipts which had followed the
  point of Old Sam's pin picking the name of Charley's Mount in the
  Cesarewitch. Mrs. Bolton needed very little persuasion.</p>

  <p>"Five pounds in the hand," as she said, "was worth two or three in the
  bush," for it was by no means certain (indeed, Educated Evans hinted as much)
  that she had struck a permanency at Tapin House.</p>

  <p>That evening, Educated Evans went forth in search of the one policeman for
  whom he had any respect, and he discovered The Miller, standing outside the
  "Nag's Head," where he had been waiting for two hours in the hope of picking
  up an acquaintance of his, urgently wanted by Scotland Yard. Since his bird
  was not likely to fly thither that night, The Miller walked back down High
  Street and listened with scepticism larded with interest to the story
  Educated Evans told.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about Roysterer, never mind about Dinkie," said Evans firmly.
  "This horse Paddy will win ten minutes, I got him from a man who's got a
  nephew in the stable. And, what's more," he added triumphantly, "I've seen
  him gallop."</p>

  <p>"Have you been touting horses, Evans?" asked the surprised Miller.</p>

  <p>Evans nodded.</p>

  <p>"I go down and have a look at 'em now and again," he said indifferently,
  as though such events were an everyday occurrence. "Now nobody knows anything
  about this horse but me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I seem to have observed that it's been tipped by several of the weekly
  papers," suggested The Miller.</p>

  <p>They're only guessing," said Evans meaningly. " I <i>know</i>!"</p>

  <p>"What's that woman Bolton doing with you? You're not contracting a
  matrimonial alliance?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans turned upon him the gaze of a wounded fawn.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised at you, Mr. Challoner," he said. "A man of my education.
  Why, the Queen of Sheeney&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sheba," corrected The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Well, whoever she was&mdash;she wouldn't tempt me. Nor would the
  celebrated Cleopatrick, who got her well-known needle through being turned
  down by the highly celebrated Nero, the far-famed Italian. If Mary Queen of
  Scots come into my room and said, 'Evans, what about taking me to the
  pictures?' I'd say, ' 'op it,' I'm done with women! Besides, she's a
  nagger."</p>

  <p>"Mary Queen of Scots?" asked The Miller in surprise.</p>

  <p>"No, Mrs. Bolton. She's always got something to grouse about. If it ain't
  one thing it's the other, and if it's not that it's something else."</p>

  <p>He certainly found Mrs. Bolton in a grumbling mood when he reached home
  that night. She said she was ready to drop; she'd been turning the handle of
  the duplicator that a child can work for three hours, and was in a condition
  of exhaustion.</p>

  <p>The response to Evans' appeal had been a heavy one. There were no fewer
  than three hundred envelopes on the table, half of which were filled. Ever a
  lover of peace, the educated man gave her fair words, and, more to the
  purpose, a promise of overtime; and together they finished the work, stuck
  down the last envelope and affixed the stamps. Evans looked at his
  announcement again with a glow of pride.</p><br>

  <p class="quote">TAPIN LODGE,<br>
  BAYHAM MEWS.</p>

  <p class="quote">SIR,</p>

  <p class="quote">Once more I am able to put you on to the Goods. Far-famed
  throughout every land and nation where the British flag is flown, the sun
  never sits on the name of Educated Evans, the World's Premier Prophet and
  Turf Adviser.</p>

  <p class="quote">To-day I send you a piece of information that nobody else
  has got!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">What a beauty!<br>
  What a beauty!<br>
  What a beauty!<br></p>

  <p class="quote">You can go your maximum on</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">PADDY****</p>

  <p class="quote">to-day&mdash;he will win in a canter.</p>

  <p class="quote">Yours truly,</p>

  <p class="quote">EDUCATED EVANS.</p>

  <p class="quote">P.S.&mdash;Put me on the odds to 1/-.</p><br>

  <p>"Rubbish and nonsense, I call it," said Mrs. Bolton.</p>

  <p>Evans' smile was one of great superiority.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand these things, Mrs. Bolton," he said. " Naturally the
  turf don't appeal to women, though I've known ladies who've made fortunes out
  of my high-class selections."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bolton sniffed. She was gathering the envelopes into packets and
  putting them into the pillow-slip which Evans had borrowed from her for the
  purpose.</p>

  <p>"Post 'em in the High Street," said Evans.</p>

  <p>"What about my money?" asked his assistant, more to the point. "I can't go
  toilin' and moilin' for a mere nothing with two mouths to fill."</p>

  <p>Though her work was only for two days Evans generously handed her a
  one-pound note.</p>

  <p>"Is the overtime here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and your lodging allowance," said Evans sarcastically.</p>

  <p>He went to sleep with a feeling that he had done a good day's work. The
  information he had received about Paddy was undoubtedly reliable.</p>

  <p>He was cooking his breakfast in the morning when a small and dirty-faced
  boy arrived with a small and dirty-faced note. It was from Mrs.
  Bolton.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Sir&mdash;it ran&mdash;I was took so bad when I got
  home last night that I can't come to work any more. Please send pound by
  bearer instead of week's notice.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

  <p class="letter">MRS. BOLTON.</p><br>

  <p>"Go back to your mother," said Evans, rightly sensing the relationship of
  the small and grimy child," and tell her I'm Not Made of Money."</p>

  <p>The little boy waited till he was downstairs and in the mews beyond the
  fear of pursuit, and made certain derisive noises which were very irritating
  to a man of Mr. Evans' refined susceptibilities.</p>

  <p>He had plenty to occupy his mind until the afternoon, and then he strolled
  forth to get a copy of the afternoon paper. It was a little disconcerting to
  find at the newspaper shop a small stack of Old Sam's Midnight Specials, and
  to be told that Sam had made Paddy his five-starred nap.</p>

  <p>"The perishin' old plagiariser," spluttered Evans, choking with
  indignation. "Why, that's the horse I sent out! He's got it from that woman
  Bolton that lives next door to him...."</p>

  <p>His feelings were somewhat mollified by the arrival at that moment of a
  newspaper runner, and the discovery, in the smudged space, of the news that
  Paddy had won.</p>

  <p>"Seven to two it is," said the shopkeeper. "I heard it on the telephone.
  One of the runners told me. They got that price from the blower round at the
  Arts Club."</p>

  <p>Evans scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"The news must have got out," he said. "I reckoned it'd be ten to
  one."</p>

  <p>But a shock awaited him when, a little later, he strolled into the shop of
  a client. "It won," he said laconically.</p>

  <p>"What won?" demanded Mr. Harry Leek, the well-known furniture dealer.</p>

  <p>"Paddy&mdash;I sent it to you&mdash;fear nothing!" The furniture dealer
  frowned.</p>

  <p>"You didn't send anything to me," he said, "or I'd have backed it."</p>

  <p>Evans turned pale.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you didn't get my five-pound special?" he
  squeaked.</p>

  <p>But not only had this gentleman not received it, but nobody else had
  received it, as Evans discovered when he made a rapid visit to four or five
  of his clients.</p>

  <p>Pale with fury, he half ran to Little College Court and knocked at the
  door behind which Mrs. Bolton had her habitation.</p>

  <p>"Mother's ill in bed and can't see nobody," said an uncompromising young
  lady of fifteen.</p>

  <p>"Go up and ask your mother what she done with them letters what I gave her
  to post last night," said Evans huskily.</p>

  <p>She ain't had no letters. She's not right in 'er 'ead&mdash;she's
  deleerious and nobody's allowed to see her," said the daughter, and pushed
  the door close in Evans' face.</p>

  <p>"Is 'e gorn?" asked Mrs. Bolton over the banisters. "Like his cheek,
  coming to my 'ouse!" she said, as she came downstairs, very fit and well.
  That serves him right for trying to sweat the poor," she said.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with the letters, mother?" asked her darling
  child.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bolton ran her fingers through her untidy hair.</p>

  <p>"They'll keep for a bit. I'll ask Old Sam."</p>

  <p>She did not ask Old Sam because it was not her way to do anything she
  arranged to do. With Mrs. Bolton things just happened; and she had forgotten
  the fact that underneath her bed was a pillowslip full of unposted letters,
  when, on the Wednesday morning, she opened the door to see a familiar
  face.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Mrs. Bolton. How's the world treating you?" asked The
  Miller cheerfully&mdash;and when he was cheerful something dirty was going to
  happen.</p>

  <p>"Good&mdash;good-morning, Mr. Challoner," faltered Mrs. Bolton. "You're a
  sight for sore eyes, I must say. Is it anything about my husband you want to
  know?"</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly," said The Miller, leaning negligently against the
  door-post. "You've been working for Mr. Evans, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, a sudden fear gripping her side.</p>

  <p>"I understand he gave you some letters to post&mdash;about three hundred,
  each with a three-ha'penny stamp on it, which represents roughly about one
  pound seventeen and sixpence."</p>

  <p>The throat of Mrs. Bolton, a comparatively honest woman, went dry.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, he did, sir," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Did you post them?" asked The Miller carelessly, his hard, grey eyes on
  hers.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir "&mdash;how she said the words she never knew.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>She nodded dumbly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, then, I shall have to make inquiries at the post office," said The
  Miller, and took his leave with a happy nod.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bolton closed the door and, staggering up the stairs, sat on her bed.
  Visions of the female equivalent for Dartmoor swam before her eyes. Going to
  the head of the stairs she called in a hollow voice for her daughter, and
  Millicent&mdash;such was the name of this child&mdash;came up the stairs and
  listened to the horrid tale.</p>

  <p>"Let's burn 'em," she suggested brightly. "Or "&mdash;as an idea struck
  her&mdash;"let's slip out and put 'em in the post to-night.</p>

  <p>"Nobody'll see who posted 'em, and they can't bring nothin' up against
  you, mother." It was a wonderful idea.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>A gloomy Educated Evans strolled into the High Street, sad and depressed.
  All that morning he had avoided the busy haunts of men, gravitating, as was
  his wont, to the Thames Embankment; and now, with little interest in life,
  for he felt that his luck was baulked, he came back to the great highway with
  a feeling that fate had indeed baffled him.</p>

  <p>The Miller, riding past him on his motor-bicycle, saw him, and, stopping,
  jumped off and came back with a beaming face.</p>

  <p>"You old scoundrel!" he said heartily. "Fancy sending out a twenty to one
  winner! I've backed it, and you're on the odds to a shilling."</p>

  <p>Evans' jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"Only got the letter this morning." The Miller took it from his pocket and
  handed it to the flabbergasted World's Champion. "You didn't tell me this
  horse was going for the Newbury Cup.... I'll see you later, Evans."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans walked along, High Street like a man in a dream, receiving, it
  seemed at every yard, the onrush of some admiring friend who crossed the road
  or flew from a shop to congratulate him upon his prescience.</p>

  <p>For Paddy, who had won the Liverpool Cup at 7/2, had also won the Newbury
  Cup at 20/1! And the three hundred foolish people who had received the
  belated communication meant for the Liverpool event were blissfully unaware
  of what a providential tipster Mrs. Bolton was. And Educated Evans, who did
  not even know that Paddy was entered for the Newbury event, received the
  congratulations with a modest smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes... I was goin' to send it for Liverpool, but changed my mind...
  information pays in the long run."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; A GOOD GALLOP</h2>

  <p class="first">ALFRED ROBSPEAR, a distant acquaintance of Educated Evans,
  called at Sansovino House very early in the morning to borrow a shilling.</p>

  <p>He was a raw, lop-sided man of forty-five, who had been out of employment
  for twenty years, until a miracle happened and he discovered that by calling
  every week at the Labour Exchange he could draw enough money to keep his
  children and his favourite bookmaker from starvation.</p>

  <p>"You don't get no shillings out of me," said Evans firmly, and went down
  the wooden steps to draw a pail of water for his morning ablutions.</p>

  <p>Mr. Robspear did not immediately follow. This, Educated Evans remembered
  later....</p>

  <p>It was not the happiest day in Mr. Evans' life. It was, in fact, a morning
  of crisis when he surveyed his possessions and calculated skilfully and with
  accurate judgment the exact amount he could raise on his non- necessities. He
  had a library of books which included three annual volumes of <i>Racing
  Up-to-Date</i>, a turf ready-reckoner and five dog-eared volumes which had
  been presented to him by a client in lieu of the five shillings which Mr.
  Evans had earned by his gift of prophecy, and which were supposed to be
  valuable, one at least being yellow with age and having "f's" for "s's " in
  the typescript. And it is pretty well-known that ancient books with "f's" for
  "s's" are sometimes sold for enormous sums.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans sighed and, gathering together his books, tied a piece of string
  round them and was leaving his room to carry the volumes to Jones' Renowned
  Marine Store, when a thought occurred to him, and, pulling back the mattress
  of his bed, discovered that his best pair of trousers was missing.</p>

  <p>Alfred Eustace Robspear was no relation to the French gentleman whose name
  was thus anglicised. He was not sea green nor, if his finger-prints records
  at Headquarters are to be believed, was he incorruptible.</p>

  <p>Probably no black deed of his is comparable, in point of sheer infamy,
  with his villainous attempt to twist Mr. Evans of Bayham Mews, notorious
  wherever the Empire's flag is flown as the World's Premier Sporting Prophet
  and Turf Adviser. He carried his sorrows to Sergeant Challoner.</p>

  <p>"Robspear? He'd rob Shakespeare, that fellow would," said Educated Evans,
  trembling with annoyance. "What did he do? When I gave him Marrow
  Bones&mdash;it ought to have won ten minutes but the jockey wasn't
  trying&mdash;he comes to my flat an' pinches the only good pair of trousis
  I've got! An' me due at the Hollyoak Whist Drive to-night to meet a young
  lady, a regular..."</p>

  <p>He used a French expression and The Miller was startled.</p>

  <p>"A what?" he asked, shocked. " Do you know what that means?"</p>

  <p>"It's French for bein' half in this world an' half in the next," said
  Evans.</p>

  <p>Very gently The Miller explained the meaning of the term.</p>

  <p>"Lord love a duck!" said the agitated Evans. "I thought she dropped her
  eyes when I called her that."</p>

  <p>"If she had kicked you in the stomach it would have been no more than you
  deserved," said The Miller severely. "Do you want to make a charge against
  Robspear?"</p>

  <p>Here Educated Evans hesitated. Grievous a loss as he had suffered, he was
  not prepared to come copper on a fellow citizen.</p>

  <p>"I'll reason with him," he said. "I'll talk to him in what I might term a
  diplomatic manner: just the same as the well-known Queen Elizabeth argued
  with the far-famed Spanish gentleman, Signor Armada, in 1066, causin' her
  never to smile again."</p>

  <p>"There's another point I'd like to take up with you, Evans&mdash;you told
  me yesterday Fideles was a certainty for the Richmond Handicap at Kempton on
  Easter Monday. What do you know about it?"</p>

  <p>"Fee-dellis?" Educated Evans was startled. " I didn't tell you that, Mr.
  Challoner. What I said was Fiddles&mdash;Bolfort's horse."</p>

  <p>"I pronounce it a little differently, but it is the same horse," said The
  Miller patiently. "Have you dreamt this one or is it genuine? I can't imagine
  old Bolfort winning a race except by accident. He never gallops his horses
  and has one winner every leap year."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans smiled mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"Him and me's like brothers," he said. Prophetic words!</p>

  <p>There was a time when John Bolfort was a name to conjure with. The
  Bolforts had been trainers of horses since the days of Richard III., or maybe
  Alfred the Great (or, as some cynics say, since the times of Aethelred the
  Unready). Even to-day the word "Bolfort" against a horse's name in any
  programme is a cachet of its respectability, for John Felton Bolfort is a man
  of superior learning and eminent toniness. John Bolfort went to Eton, as all.
  Bolforts have done. Indeed, it is often suggested that Eton was founded by
  Henry VI. for the purpose of giving this great family of trainers the
  education so necessary to the scientific super-vision of racehorses.</p>

  <p>Mr John Bolfort trains at Marsh in the Moor: that is to say, attached to
  the old manor house, where he drinks his port at a polished table, are a
  dozen or so loose boxes, where horses are sent to feed and canter and
  sometimes race. For the past twenty years he has had an average of 2.75 per
  cent. winners per annum. Regular racegoers leave out his horses, uttering the
  slogan: "When he wins I can afford to lose." And it suits Mr. Bolfort, who
  cares very little whether he wins or loses, having a mind superior to horses
  and being wholly engrossed in the study and collection of early church music.
  In truth his owners do not worry whether he wins or loses: they are mainly
  fine old country gentlemen who ride to hounds, drink port, and bemoan the
  passing of the Reform Bill in eighteen thirty something, which, as everybody
  knows, ruined England.</p>

  <p>But if, by accident, he gets the horses of a plebeian, upstart owner who
  wants to know whether his horse is going to win, Mr. Bolfort shrugs his
  shoulders, shakes his white head, strokes his patriarchal beard and
  smiles.</p>

  <p>"I can only tell you," he says, in his well-modulated voice, "that your
  horse is very well."</p>

  <p>If the owner becomes a little too insistent, Mr. Bolfort writes him a
  letter and asks him if he will kindly take his horses elsewhere. That is the
  kind of man Mr. Bolfort is.</p>

  <p>When his horses win, as they occasionally do, his is mildly surprised but
  the surprise on the part of the public is not so mild, because his winners
  invariably start amongst the "20/1 others," and low down punters, who have
  backed the favourite and seen it pipped a short head on the post, curse Mr.
  Bolfort and wish his charge had dropped dead, yet console themselves by
  repeating: "When he wins I can afford to lose."</p>

  <p>He had in his stable a horse called Fideles, which common bookmakers
  invariably called Fiddles," and Fiddles was remarkable in that it had run
  thirty-five times without catching the judge's eye, or indeed any other
  portion of his countenance. Fideles was the property of Lord Livergrome, who
  was a gentleman of the old school who liked to see his colours in public. It
  would have cost him much less to have had those same colours carried around
  on a pole, but he preferred to see them on a jockey's back, and paid
  cheerfully the most expensive entrance fees.</p>

  <p>By the curious workings of fate, Mr Bolfort was browsing in Camden Town
  and was standing at the counter of Jones' Renowned Marine store and
  Second-hand Bookshop, examining a germ-infected copy of a very old book when
  Evans came into the store, nodded jauntily to the untidy lady behind the
  counter, and put his books on the counter.</p>

  <p>"I've got a few odds and ends here, Mrs. Jones, you might like to buy," he
  said airily." Me library's getting overstocked. The books are valuable, but I
  haven't time to take 'em down to Christie's, the celebrated auctioneers."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jones, with a look of disparagement on a face that was otherwise
  featureless, cut the string and turned over the books one by one.</p>

  <p>"Eightpence," she said laconically.</p>

  <p>"Eightpence?" said the indignant Evans. "Why that there book's got 'f's'
  for 's's' in it."</p>

  <p>"It's not worth tuppence," said the cruel Mrs. Jones. "What's it about,
  anyway? What's a madrigal?"</p>

  <p>"A madrigal," said Evans, with dignity, "as everybody knows, is a book
  about lunatics: one of the most famous books that's ever been published."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bolfort came out of his trance.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir," he said, in his gentle voice, reached for the book and,
  turning over the pages, uttered an exclamation.</p>

  <p>" 'Elizabethan. Madrigals, collected by Thomas Scott,' " he said. "I
  should like to buy that. Good gracious me it's the book I've been looking for
  for years! What do you want for it, sir?"</p>

  <p>Evans coughed. He hated to say too little for fear he got it, or too much
  lest he be assaulted. Mr. Bolfort saved him the trouble.</p>

  <p>"I will give you five pounds," he said apologetically, and Evans nodded
  dumbly.</p>

  <p>"You are a collector, sir?" said Mr. Bolfort, ignoring the glaring Mrs.
  Jones, who had been robbed out of £4 19s. 4d.</p>

  <p>"A bit of a one," said Evans, recovering his voice.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bolfort shook his hoary head.</p>

  <p>"Alas! I wish that I had the time to devote to that fascinating hobby," he
  said; " though I think I have the best collection of old English madrigals in
  the country. You must come down to Bolfort House one day and look over my
  library. I find most people are more interested in my horses than in my
  books."</p>

  <p>"Bolfort House?" said Evans hollowly. "You ain't&mdash;aren't&mdash;you're
  not Mr. Bolfort, the highly celebrated trainer?"</p>

  <p>The highly celebrated trainer smiled sadly. "I would rather be known for
  my madrigals," he said.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Evans walked arm-in-arm down Great College
  Street&mdash;with a trainer! With a man whose name appeared in newspapers,
  with a gentleman who could race horses every day of his life and think
  nothing of it.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, you must see my collection," said Mr. Bolfort, who was
  interested in the subject of books to the exclusion of all else; who even
  regarded the shabbiness of his new acquaintance as a proof of his genius.</p>

  <p>The Miller was patrolling High Street, Camden Town, next morning, when Mr.
  Evans crossed the road to intercept him.</p>

  <p>"I got them trousis back, Mr. Challoner," said Evans. "It was a bit of a
  joke on Robspear's part... it would have been awkward for me if I hadn't.
  I'm going down to spend a week-end with my old friend Bolfort."</p>

  <p>The Miller looked at him suspiciously. " It's rather early in the day for
  fairy-tales," he said, " but I'll buy this one. Bolfort the trainer?"</p>

  <p>"I'm spending a week-end with him," said Evans, coughing importantly. "as
  I've told you before, him an' me's like brothers. 'Evans,' he said, 'come
  down and see that horse of mine Fiddles.' "</p>

  <p>Evans coughed again, this time not so importantly.</p>

  <p>"I've been having a bit of trouble getting money in from clients&mdash;"
  he began.</p>

  <p>"Why should they give you money?" demanded The Miller. " Except to get you
  out of the country "</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when Educated Evans approached him with some urgency, The
  Miller parted. For there was this to be said about his educated friend, that
  he never forgot his debts.</p>

  <p>The money was very necessary, for the fare to Marsh in the Moor was
  exorbitantly high, and the walk from the railway station would have been an
  immense distance but for the station fly he was able to hire. The next
  morning Evans woke up in a four-poster bed and looked round the enormous
  apartment with a sense of complacency. He had spent the night before drinking
  port and examining books which were Greek, Sanskrit and Cuneiform to him. He
  had skilfully led the conversation to the subject of race-horses, and had
  been as skilfully led back to the matter of madrigals and Gregorian chants.
  But this morning he was to see with his own eyes the interior of a real
  racing stable.</p>

  <p>"Do you ride, Mr. Evans? Why, of course you do," old Mr. Bolfort corrected
  himself. " You were telling me how you won the Bengal Steeplechase."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans turned pale.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had a ride for years," he said. "and I'm a bit nervous about
  strange horses."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said Mr. Bolfort. "I'll have a hack for you that is as quiet
  as a mouse."</p>

  <p>What Evans at that moment wanted was a horse as steady as a concrete
  gun-platform, but this he could not state without a loss of caste.</p>

  <p>The horse was waiting at the door. Mr. Bolfort lent him a pair of gaiters
  to put on over his trousers and handed him a whip. "I never use a whip," said
  Educated Evans tremulously.</p>

  <p>"You'd better take a whip, sir," said the stable boy in attendance. "Old
  Toby shies at anything and he wants a couple of rib-benders before he settles
  down."</p>

  <p>Evans took the whip in his trembling hand and looked again at the horse.
  It was an enormous horse: he could scarcely see over the top of it. How he
  got into the saddle he never knew. Before he realised what had happened,
  there was a huge mass of coarse hair wobbling beneath him, and he was
  clutching desperately to the saddle with one hand, following Mr. Bolfort's
  hack as it moved towards the stables, which were half a mile from the house.
  Happily, Mr. Bolfort was at first content to walk; but half-way to the
  stables he called Evans to his side, and as though the horrible beast that
  the World's Champion bestrode understood his words, he broke into a most
  uncomfortable jog- trot which jerked every atom of breath from his educated
  body. Thereafter, however, the ride was a pleasant one, for Mr. Bolfort was
  also content to walk his mount.</p>

  <p>"You'll see some nice horses," said the old trainer; " though I must
  confess that I'm not as much interested in them as my grandfather was. I love
  to see a horse looking sturdy, with his coat shining and a little flesh on
  his bones. I believe in treating animals kindly, as I would myself wish to be
  treated."</p>

  <p>"That's what I always say," said Evans.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to get used to the dangerous experience of moving through
  the air with his head some ten feet from the ground, and a little of the
  colour was coming back to his face.</p>

  <p>"The curious thing about horses," mused Mr. Bolfort, "are the likes and
  dislikes they have. Now I've got a horse in my stable that simply loathes old
  Toby."</p>

  <p>"The one I am riding?" asked Mr. Evans, feeling a certain amount of
  sympathy with anything that shared his utter dislike of the ambling beast
  beneath him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, old Toby," Bolfort went on. " The horse in question is one called
  Fideles. The mere sight of that hack&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He tapped old Toby on the nose, and old Toby did a violent shy, in the
  course of which, by some miracle, Evans preserved his seat, though not his
  presence of mind.</p>

  <p>"The sight of old Toby," the trainer went on, unconscious of the panic he
  had aroused in the bosom of the World's Best Tipster, "drives Fideles into a
  fury. Now I've often tried to account for this extraordinary prejudice, but
  so far I have not succeeded."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I get off the horse when we come to the stables&mdash;I
  mean before Fiddles see him?" begged Evans, large beads of perspiration on
  his brow.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. You can't ride round the stables, you know," said the old man
  good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>Happily there was a stable boy who seemed to understand horses at the
  entrance of the yard, and Evans slid down Toby's forelegs to the ground, his
  knees trembling beneath him, and for the space of two minutes he had the head
  lad to himself.</p>

  <p>"Nice place this," said Evans conversationally.</p>

  <p>The head lad, who had the face of an aged man and the legs of an infant,
  growled something uncomplimentary.</p>

  <p>"Going to see Fiddles?" he asked, and Evans' heart warmed towards one who
  pronounced the word correctly. "That 'orse ought to win a race, you know,
  guv'nor," said the head lad, "but Mr. Bolfort won't give him a
  gallop&mdash;says it strains their 'earts! One good gallop, and old Fiddles
  would win that Richmond 'Andicap next week as sure as you're born!"</p>

  <p>At this moment the trainer came back and conducted his guest round the
  stables. At the third door he paused.</p>

  <p>"This is Fideles," he said, "and he's rather a wild fellow, so I wouldn't
  advise you to come inside."</p>

  <p>He opened the top half door, and revealed a ferocious animal whose lips
  curled back in a sneer at the sight of the man who had so often tipped
  him.</p>

  <p>"That's Fideles," said Mr. Bolfort, "Put him over the other side,
  boy."</p>

  <p>It was only then that Evans noticed that there was a boy attached to the
  horse by an iron chain. At least, it seemed so.</p>

  <p>"If I went into that box," said Mr. Bolfort complacently, "he'd eat me.
  You wouldn't be in there two minutes alive, Mr. Evans. Whoa, boy!"</p>

  <p>For Fideles had suddenly whipped round and lashed out with his hooves in
  the direction of the box door. Evans made a hasty retreat.</p>

  <p>The inspection of the stables did not take a long time. Mr. Bolfort had
  spoken the truth when he said that horses did not interest him as much as
  madrigals. With some reluctance, but with the comforting assurance that the
  house was very near, Evans was assisted into the saddle of his hack and he
  and his host walked side by side out of the gate.</p>

  <p>"I almost think that Fideles of mine would win a race, but unhappily he is
  such a brute that none of my lads likes to ride him, and the boy who does
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Was that the boy that does him?" asked Evans in an awed voice, thinking
  of the diminutive youth attached by a chain.</p>

  <p>"That is the boy that does him. He's too light: the horse would simply run
  away with him. He's such a brute...."</p>

  <p>There was a clatter of hooves behind and he turned his head, and Evans,
  who did not dare to turn his head for fear of falling off, saw a look of
  amazement and horror in the trainer's face.</p>

  <p>"Fideles!" he gasped. "He's after that hack of yours! Gallop, Mr. Evans,
  for heaven's sake!"</p>

  <p>Evans screwed his head round and caught one glimpse of the ferocious horse
  galloping towards him, followed by three yelling stable boys, and he almost
  fell off his horse.</p>

  <p>Toby did not need to have spurs clapped to him, even if Educated Evans had
  had spurs to clap. With an unearthly snort he bounded forward. Mr. Evans
  clutched his mane and held tight. The house flew past them; they were
  crossing a field at seventy miles an hour&mdash;or it may have been a hundred
  and seventy. It seemed more. A hedge loomed in front of them. Before Evans
  realised what had happened, he felt himself rise, fly over the hedge, still
  clutching the mane, his legs dangling helplessly, the stirrups striking his
  knees most pain fully at every stride. He heard the thunder of the hooves
  behind, and, more by accident than design, saw the openmouthed fury that
  pursued them not more than half a dozen yards away.</p>

  <p>Through a field of cabbages, over another fence&mdash;how he maintained
  his seat he never understood&mdash;into a country road, past a
  motor-car&mdash;or it may have been six motor-cars&mdash;through a farmyard,
  twice round a haystack, with Fideles following, and then back towards the
  stable. Evans closed his eyes and waited for death as he saw his
  fear-maddened mount dashing, as it seemed, straight for a brick wall.</p>

  <p>Toby stopped suddenly. Not so Evans. He described a wonderful curve
  through the air, and he had a sensation of flying, saw beneath him the top of
  a wall, then suddenly his eyes, ears and nose were filled with sharp ends of
  straw, and he lay half-conscious.</p>

  <p>Two stable boys helped him up, and he heard, in a dim, dazed way, that his
  horse was safe. He was not wildly elated at the news.</p>

  <p>"Is Fiddles dead?" he asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>But Fiddles lived.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>On the evening of Easter Monday, Educated Evans sat in his room, a long
  cigar between his teeth, a look of infinite satisfaction in his eyes. There
  The Miller found him, at peace with the world.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations, Evans!" he said heartily. "Fiddles won all right
  &mdash;I got twenties to my money."</p>

  <p>Mr.. Evans removed his cigar.</p>

  <p>"You can thank me," he said simply. "He wouldn't have won but for me. I
  says to Bolfort when I see the horse, 'Bolfort,' I says, 'that horse wants a
  gallop. Let me lead him one gallop an' he'll win.' "</p>

  <p>"And did he let you " asked The Miller incredulously.</p>

  <p>Evans knocked off the ashes of his cigar. "It wasn't a question of
  letting," he said "The matter was took out of his hands."</p>

  <p>The Miller did not believe him&mdash;but for once The Miller was
  wrong.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7"></a>VII. &mdash; A HORSE OF THE SAME COLOUR</h2>

  <p class="first">THE two-year-old Hesperus was a grey. And the two-year-old
  Milikins was also a grey. And both their owner and their trainer were hoary-
  headed men who had grown grey with artfulness.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tooks (<i>the</i> Randolph Tooks) had two stables, one at Lambourn and
  one in Wiltshire, and to the Wiltshire stable he sent Milikins and to the
  Lambourn establishment he sent Hesperus, just as soon as he had bought these
  horses privately from their breeder. Only he changed their names and when the
  stable boys at Lambourn were talking about the amazing speed of Milikins they
  were in reality talking of Hesperus.</p>

  <p>Only the astute Mr. Groom, the trainer, and the astuter Mr. Tooks knew
  this.</p>

  <p>Hesperus (wrote the head lad of the Wiltshire stable) isn't worth
  tuppence: you can leave him out every time he runs.</p>

  <p>He was writing to one of his punters, for naughty head lads sometimes have
  a few correspondents who will give them the odds to a fiver in return for
  information.</p>

  <p>Milikins is a smasher (wrote a literary stable boy who supplied a
  plutocratic tipster with information). "We tried him yesterday at level
  weights with Hard Egg and Dontbelate and he smothered them.</p>

  <p>"Be open and frank about these horses," said Mr. Tooks, the wily owner.
  "If any of these newspaper touts come nosing round your gallops, don't hurt
  'em&mdash;give 'em a drink. We'll enter Hesperus and Milikins at one meeting,
  I'll send my own boys to bring the horses on to the course, and we'll skin
  the ring."</p>

  <p>It is not an offence at law or by the rules of racing to call a horse by
  any name you wish, so long as he runs by the name he is entered. There is
  many a high-sounding Derby winner who is called "Bill" in the stable, and if
  the stable name for Hesperus was Milikins, nobody was hurt but the stable
  hands who, contrary to Rule 176, sub-section v, conveyed illicit
  information.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans, the World's Champion Prophet and Turf Adviser, did not
  ordinarily interest himself in the thoroughbred race-horse, as a horse. To
  him, a horse was a name in the daily newspapers anchored to the column by a
  weight, the names of his owner (to which "Mr." was affixed) and his trainer,
  who was just Jones or Smith without any mistering nonsense whatever.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Evans had smelt the early dawn of the gallops and seen the vast
  uplands of country places, and had, moreover, felt the soul-stir which comes
  only to those who have sat on the back of a thoroughbred hack. In other
  words, he had once been the overnight guest of a real trainer, and the
  exhilaration of the experience had got into his blood and even found its way
  to his legs. From Isaacs in High Street he acquired a pair of riding breeches
  and gaiters. He began to take an interest in the horses stabled in the mews,
  and would often imitate, unconsciously perhaps, the hissing noise that grooms
  make when they run a dandy brush over a horse's back.</p>

  <p>But the most remarkable change that this experience of his had brought
  about was his passion for observation. He had been twice to Epsom and had
  shivered on the top of Six Mile Hill whilst innumerable horses that looked
  very much like one another came at an alarming pace towards him. He had been
  as far afield as Newmarket&mdash;and he had made one most profitable visit to
  a spot which was somewhere between East Ilsley and Wantage. It may be
  explained that none of these journeys cost money, a friend and client of his,
  who did odd cartage-jobs with a motor-van that he had picked up for a song,
  giving him a lift whenever he was going near to a training centre.</p>

  <p>These serious preoccupations of Educated Evans had not escaped the keen
  eyes of Camden Town. Mr. Evans was again in favour. Even the carters at the
  Midland Goods Station, who had once (so it is said) bribed the driver of a
  shunting engine to run him over, took him to their arms. His detested rival,
  Old Sam, had been unlucky. Possibly he was using the wrong kind of pin to
  find winners, but certain it is that, when the ancient man walked abroad, his
  beard of many colours floating in the wind, disappointed punters said bitter
  things to him. The riding breeches and gaiters of Educated Evans were the
  final blow to Old Sam. He came to Mr. Evans' house one night, breathing hops
  and vengeance, but the Educated Man had gone down into Berkshire
  overnight.</p>

  <p>Early the following morning Mr. Groom, the eminent trainer, rode out on to
  the downs, his string of horses having gone ahead of him. Cantering towards
  the end of the trial ground, he became aware of a figure on his misty horizon
  and a big motor lorry drawn up by the side of the road.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, sir," said Mr. Groom politely.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, sir," said Evans, ready to bolt.</p>

  <p>"Are you one of those newspaper gentlemen?" said the amazingly polite
  trainer.</p>

  <p>Evans, who could not tell a lie, admitted that he was.</p>

  <p>"Ah! then you'll see an interesting gallop," said Mr. Groom. "I never
  object to newspaper gentlemen seeing my trials. What paper do you
  represent?"</p>

  <p>Educated Evans mentioned a journal which would have reeled from Printing
  House Square to Fleet Street had it but heard.</p>

  <p>"It's a good paper but the price is high," remarked the trainer.</p>

  <p>"We're thinkin' of rejuicin' it," said Evans carelessly. "I was only
  sayin' to Lord What's-his-name yesterday, 'people won't pay fourpence unless
  you give away a pattern or somethin'&mdash;' "</p>

  <p>"Here they come!" Groom interrupted as four dots came over the skyline and
  grew larger every second.</p>

  <p>Evans knew enough about horses to see at a glance that the leader was a
  grey. It flashed past him four lengths ahead of the rest.</p>

  <p>"Yes... very good," agreed Groom.</p>

  <p>"No, I can't tell you its name&mdash;but it is the only grey I have in the
  stable. Good-morning, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Evans," said the educated man airily. "You may have heard of me&mdash;the
  celebrated Educated Evans? Braxted... don't that recall nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Were you named after him?" asked Mr. Groom.</p>

  <p>The Master of Paddy Lodge, Bayham Mews, shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I'll write it down for you," he said, oblivious to Mr. Groom's obvious
  indifference.</p>

  <p>Drawing a fat fountain-pen from his pocket (purchased only a few days
  before from the shilling bargain basement of Pelfridge's) he inscribed his
  name on a bit of paper he found in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Look out!"</p>

  <p>Evans heard the warning shout and stared round. The horses had been pulled
  up and were returning to where he and the trainer stood. The grey, still
  fighting for its head, was within a yard of him, and as he looked, the animal
  spun round like a teetotum.</p>

  <p>Pen and paper fell from Evans' hand as he stumbled back. He saw a hoof
  smash on the pen and a spurting fountain of green ink leap up.</p>

  <p>"Keep away from him!" called the trainer sharply, and Evans retreated to
  the road. He did not even call attention to the loss of his pen.</p>

  <p>"That horse didn't seem to like you," said the trolley driver, as his
  passenger climbed up.</p>

  <p>Evans shrugged again.</p>

  <p>"I'm cruel to horses&mdash;I admit it," he confessed. "He ain't forgot the
  hidin' I gave him last week."</p>

  <p>Three minutes later he was being rattled towards Newbury, his mind
  seething with excitement. At the first newspaper shop he stopped and bought a
  copy of <i>Horses in Training,</i> and turned eagerly to that page which bore
  the name of Mr. Groom's charges.</p>

  <p>"Milikins, gr. colt by Grey Fairy&mdash;Mill Girl."</p>

  <p>Milikins! Here was a tip, not from the boy that did him, but from his very
  own eyes!</p>

  <p>The Miller, who had been out of town for four days, having gone to Paris
  to take over the body of Harry Elbert, the well-known fishmonger who, being
  in a precarious financial position, had packed up a parcel of his employers'
  money (The Deep Sea Fisheries Limited&mdash;The Shops with the Blue Tiles)
  and gone abroad with the young lady from Higgins the Poulterers.</p>

  <p>He came back and, having safely hutched Harry, went in search of Educated
  Evans.</p>

  <p>That learned man he found at his home, Paddy Lodge, and Mr. Evans was
  engaged</p>

  <p>in the comparatively innocent occupation of frying a sausage.</p>

  <p>"Ever heard of Ptolemy, Evans?"</p>

  <p>The World's Champion Turf Adviser shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Tolly Me?" he frowned. "That's one of Bennett's hair- trunks, ain't
  it?"</p>

  <p>The Miller spelt the word and the face of his host lit up.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mean Pet-olmy&mdash;heard about him? He belongs to the celebrated
  Adjer Kan an' he can catch pigeons. He's runnin' in the Jubilee&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He belongs to quite another gentleman, he's running in the Derby, and
  they tell me in Paris he can't lose."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans sniffed and turned the sausage with his one- pronged fork.</p>

  <p>"There's a horse in the Derby," he said, with great deliberation, " that
  can fall down, eat a good meal, get up an' <i>then</i> win it! This horse was
  tried twenty-one pound better than Sansovino, belongin' to the highly popular
  Sir Stanley Derby, of Derby House, Newmarket&mdash;a personal friend of mine.
  I've written letters to him."</p>

  <p>"That seems a pretty slight foundation for friendship," said The Miller
  dryly. "Do you call all the people your friends just because you write to
  'em?"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Evans significantly. "If they act honourable. Everybody don't
  act honourable. Twenty-one pun' eight shillin's, a basket of greens and a
  gramophone that don't work&mdash;that's all I got out of three hundred
  clients."</p>

  <p>"It seems a lot," said The Miller, and Mr. Evans sighed in
  resignation.</p>

  <p>"I gave 'em Paddy, 20/1&mdash;what a beauty&mdash;did I or did I not?"</p>

  <p>"You did," said the officer of the law. "You sent it out for the Liverpool
  Cup, but the woman to whom you gave the letters refrained from posting them
  till Tuesday. In consequence of which you've got a reputation you don't
  deserve."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'll get another next week," he said mysteriously. "Maybe, when a
  certain horse comes home alone, I'll get a reputation that won't be deserved
  too! Oh, no! Oh, dear no!"</p>

  <p>"I hate you when you're sarcastic," said The Miller. "Come on! What is
  this come-home-aloner?"</p>

  <p>But Mr. Evans was adamantine.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry not to oblige you, Mr. Challoner, but I've got competition in
  my business. There's a certain party&mdash;no names no pack-
  drill&mdash;who's fairly doggin' me to get information: him an' his pretty
  daughter."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans used "pretty" in the offensive sense to describe Mrs. Lube,
  of whom most people have heard.</p>

  <p>It was regrettable that Mr. Evans was not of the temperament which makes
  secrecy possible. All Camden Town knew that the master of Paddy Lodge had a
  rod in pickle: its actual name he did not tell. He contented himself with
  "hints."</p>

  <p>Certainly he hinted to such effect that he had aroused a considerable
  amount of curiosity, and at the same time had provoked mean- spirited men to
  discover for themselves the identity of this wonderful horse that he was
  giving on Thursday, and which, in two incautious moments, he had stated to
  one person, would win the Birbeck Two-Year-Old Plate at Gatwick, and to
  another, that it was a grey. When you know the race and the colour of a
  horse, and there are but two grey horses running, and one of those loudly
  advertised by every newspaper dealing with the noble sport of horse-racing,
  it is not difficult to arrive at a conclusion.</p>

  <p>"That's it!" said young Harry Gribbs, examining the programme. " It's
  Milikins! It'll start at four to one on&mdash;that's a nice five pound
  special, I don't think!"</p>

  <p>In other quarters the identity of the animal had been discovered. The
  Miller called round to see his friend.</p>

  <p>"Evans, you're going to lose your connection, my lad," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was in an irritable, indeed a nervous, state of mind, because he
  had recognised his indiscretion. In the first place, his secret information
  was everybody's news. It would be difficult to find a weekly paper that had
  not put a star against Milikins, except those that had put two.</p>

  <p>"And obviously that is the horse you have been gassing about all this
  week."</p>

  <p>"That's where you're wrong," snapped Evans, and The Miller stared at
  him.</p>

  <p>"But you said it was a grey; you said it was running in this two-year-old
  race."</p>

  <p>"Never mind what I said," Educated Evans looked almost truculent. "Ain't I
  entitled to be diplomatical, the same as the well-known Gallypot, the French
  astrologer, who, when he was asked if the world turned round, replied to the
  haughty dogs of Venice: 'It do and it don't.' Ain't I entitled&mdash;good
  lord-'mighty!&mdash;to use discretion and artfulness and cleverness? Am I
  supposed to carry me heart up me sleeve?"</p>

  <p>"Calm yourself, Horatius," said the Miller. "I meant no harm. Only
  everybody in Camden Town thinks you're tipping Milikins, and even Old Sam
  thinks you're losing your dash."</p>

  <p>"So-and-so and so-and-so Old Sam!" said the exasperated Evans.</p>

  <p>"Be calm, Elijah!" said The Miller gently. "And what is that horrible
  green stuff on your fingers?"</p>

  <p>"It's ink that I got for me fountain pen&mdash;it won't come orf."</p>

  <p>"Nor will Hesperus," said Sergeant Challoner, and Evans ground his
  teeth.</p>

  <p>He went back to Paddy House, Bayham Mews, slammed and locked the door and
  sat for a quarter of an hour glaring at the notice he had run off on his
  duplicator.</p><br>

     style="text-align:center">MILIKINS.</p><br>

  <p>Evans groaned with every fresh discovery. He realised, in some indefinable
  way, that his very reputation was at stake. Camden Town was waiting to sneer
  at him, and he took a sudden and dramatic resolve. Very painfully, he wrote
  out a new duplicator sheet, substituting for "Milikins" the word "Hesperus."
  That at least was a grey and was in the same race&mdash;for he was committed
  to a grey.</p>

  <p>What did the sporting newspapers say of Hesperus? Even the <i>Saturday
  Sports Herald,</i> whose training correspondents tip every horse in the race,
  had little to remark in his favour. "Ours is not good," said the local
  correspondent.</p>

  <p>Others were equally offensive. Evans groaned again. There was no help for
  it. Better to send a wild outsider, without a possible chance of winning,
  than sacrifice his fame for sagacity. Setting his teeth, he finished writing
  on the wax paper, and the bell of St. Pancras' Church was chiming three
  before he climbed into bed, so weary that he forgot to take off his
  braces&mdash;a precaution he had never neglected before.</p>

  <p>Was Camden Town agog at the news it had received? It was.</p>

  <p>"Hesperus?" said The Miller, wrinkling his brows, and went in search of
  the tipster. But Mr. Evans had left by an early rattler for the scene of the
  contest.</p>

  <p>Mr. Groom, the eminent trainer, was running both horses, he was glad to
  see, for a non-runner was almost as damaging to the prestige of a turf
  prophet as an odds-on favourite.</p>

  <p>In what miraculous fashion Mr. Evans contrived to get into the most
  exclusive enclosures at a race meeting, nobody has ever discovered. He is one
  of the few sportsmen in the world who has had the distinction of being thrown
  over the rails of the Royal Enclosure at Ascot. Amongst his other battle
  honours is the experience of being kicked out of Newmarket private stand
  twice in one day. It is certain he was in the Gatwick paddock, without the
  title which payment usually confers upon the patrons of racing.</p>

  <p>Miller had a day off; his motor-cycle had whizzed him into Surrey, and his
  profession procured him the same advantage in the matter of admission as Evan
  had obtained through another cause.</p>

  <p>"What's this Hesperus you've sent out?"</p>

  <p>" A horse," said Evans laconically.</p>

  <p>"Does it run?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It will run and will win by the length of the Holloway Road," he said.
  "I've had this horse give to me by the boy that does him, and I've brought
  down twenty pounds to back him."</p>

  <p>The Miller shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Give the money to me: I'll mind it," he said gently. "You're ill, Evans.
  The truth is, you intended giving Milikins, and when you found everybody else
  was giving it, you switched over."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans raised his shoulders in patient protest.</p>

  <p>"Them that laughs last laughs least," he said cryptically.</p>

  <p>It was true he had as much as f25 in his pocket. It was quite untrue that
  he intended risking so much as a penny upon Hesperus. What he did design was
  a plunge upon Milikins, that would bring some solace for the losses he would
  sustain over his idiotic tipping.</p>

  <p>Just before the 4.15, he was leaning on the rail, watching the horses
  parade. There were two greys, but which was Hesperus and which was Milikins,
  he did not know. Educated Evans never recognised a horse until the jockey got
  up.</p>

  <p>Just as the numbers were going into the frame, The Miller came hurrying to
  Evans and led him to a quiet corner of the paddock.</p>

  <p>"Evans," he said, "there's some talk about these horses being mixed up:
  that Milikins is really Hesperus, and Hesperus Milikins. You told me you saw
  a trial?"</p>

  <p>Evans nodded importantly.</p>

  <p>"Then you can tell one horse from the other. Which of those two greys won
  the trial?"</p>

  <p>Evans glanced back at the saddling ring, where the horses were slowly
  walking. Beyond the fact that they were two greys, he was quite unable to
  distinguish the trial winner, for two horses, as I have remarked, looked as
  much alike to Evans as two pairs of boots of similar make and size.</p>

  <p>And then there flashed across his mind a recollection of the alarming
  incident which had marked the end of the trial.</p>

  <p>"Here, hold hard, Miller," he said agitatedly. "I can tell you in a
  twink!"</p>

  <p>He hurried back to the ring, followed by Mr. Challoner, and presently the
  greys came along, one following the other. Evans glared down at their feet,
  and then, with a gurgle of joy, he pointed.</p>

  <p>"That's Milikins," he said. "See them green spots on his legs?... My
  fountain-pen...."</p>

  <p>Incoherently he told the story of his loss, which was now to prove his
  gain.</p>

  <p>"That's Milikins," he said. "He'll win by the length of Tattersall's...
  that horse is money for nothing," he went on, forgetting his role of prophet,
  forgetful of three hundred unfortunate people whom he had begged and implored
  to back Hesperus. "... that horse could stand on his head and win."</p>

  <p>"You daylight robber!" said The Miller softly. "Then you were
  bluffing?"</p>

  <p>Evans threw out his hands in protest.</p>

  <p>"A man of my position has got to fyness," he said simply, and The Miller
  was in too much of a hurry to ask for an explanation.</p>

  <p>Evans went back to the ring again. There were the green spots on the
  grey's fetlock. He smiled triumphantly, and, clutching his £20 in a hot hand,
  he hustled his way into Tattersall's and, taking £35 to £20, climbed up the
  stand to see his money come home.</p>

  <p>"I've got to get it some way or the other, Mr. Challoner," he said to The
  Miller, who joined him. "Self-preservation's the first law of betting, and
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They're off!"</p>

  <p>The start was a straggling one, but Hesperus&mdash;even Evans recognised
  Hesperus now &mdash;jumped off in front, was a certain winner at two
  furlongs, an assured winner at four furlongs, and actually did win by ten
  lengths.</p>

  <p>"Hesperus?" said the dazed Evans. "The&mdash;the thieves and robbers!
  They've been and run them horses on me!"</p>

  <p>And then it slowly dawned upon him that, however much his pocket might
  have suffered at Gatwick, his reputation in Camden Town was considerably
  enhanced. Well, well," he said tolerantly, " it's a case of information v.
  guesswork. If I'd stayed at home I'd have made a lot of money. I knew they'd
  rung this horse, and if you hadn't put me off it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Miller gave him one glance, which would have withered an ordinary man.
  But Evans was no ordinary man.</p>

  <p>Said Mr. Groom, the trainer, to Mr. Tooks, the owner:</p>

  <p>"Did you see that ugly little devil looking at the horse's legs? He's a
  tout or something and came up to my gallops. What did he do? Why, he dropped
  some green ink on Hesperus. I guessed he'd been sent to find out which was
  which, so I cleaned Hesperus&mdash;and a devil of a job it was&mdash;and put
  a few green spots on Milikins. Artful, eh? I tell you these newspaper chaps
  want a bit of beating!</p>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8"></a>VIII. &mdash; MIXING IT</h2>

  <p class="first">EVERY great man has his sycophants, partly because,
  realising their greatness, they cannot hear too much about it, and partly
  because flattery produces largesse in some shape or form.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans was a great man: he was the World's Champion Prophet and
  Turf Adviser, which in itself is a distinction that many a man would give his
  head to possess. He was also a scholar and an authority on all sorts of
  esoteric subjects.</p>

  <p>You could never floor Evans with any kind of question, historical,
  astronomical, biological or anatomical. He was the only man in Camden Town
  who knew what an appendix was for.</p>

  <p>And Abe Slow was his most vocal admirer. Abe was a bookmaker who had
  fallen on evil times owing to his honesty. He used to admit this.</p>

  <p>"If I'd thieved same as..." (he named quite a number of limited liability
  bookmakers, and named them libellously) "I'd be walking about in my
  Rolls-Royce car, but, Mr. Evans, believe me or believe me not, I'd rather
  have my ear cut off than fiddle."</p>

  <p>Evans believed him. At that particular moment he believed anything, for he
  was in his politest mood. A high stool was under him, the shining counter of
  the saloon bar of the "Blue Horse" was before him, and within earshot was the
  loveliest barmaid in Camden Town&mdash;Miss Bella, she with the diamond
  ear-rings and the wrist-watch.</p>

  <p>"Very true, very true," said Evans, condescendingly and loudly. "How true
  it is, as the celebrated Mikel Vally, the well-known Eyetalian artist, said,
  'Honesty's a good servant but a bad master,' which reminds me."</p>

  <p>The beautiful barmaid was wiping a wine glass, breathing upon it to obtain
  a better polish, but she was listening and Evans raised his voice still
  louder.</p>

  <p>"Travellin' as I have in all parts of the uncivilise' world, Africa,
  Orstralia, Wantage an' other wild spots, I've often seen things that people
  don't know, such as lions, tigers, ostridges&mdash;where we get feathers
  from&mdash;kang'roos, elephants...."</p>

  <p>The beauteous Bella stifled a yawn and walked to the other end of the
  counter to serve a customer. Mr. Evans shrugged his thin shoulders, and from
  there on the conversation became normal.</p>

  <p>"I've had my ups and I've had my downs," Abe went on, "but if I'd 'a had a
  gentleman like you behind me I shouldn't be in my present position&mdash;good
  health, Mr. Evans."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans nodded as his beer flowed down another man's throat. He knew,
  but preferred not to know, that Abe was once a street-corner bookmaker, with
  a limit of tenses and a strict all-in rule for doubles, trebles and
  accumulators. Even these restrictive regulations had not averted ruin in the
  year that Humorist won the Derby. Abe had paid out £47 10s. 0d. over that
  race without a murmur&mdash;partly because the two chief winners were Lew
  Davis, the celebrated middleweight, and Alf Sossino, who had done two
  stretches for biting policemen, and partly because he was an honourable man.
  This latter cause was, however, the smaller part.</p>

  <p>"Have you thought any more about that idea of mine?" asked Abe, as he
  wiped his mouth.</p>

  <p>Evans had thought a great deal. That idea of Abe's was in a way rather
  intriguing.</p>

  <p>"A man in my position&mdash;" he began, but Abe arrested his objection
  eloquently.</p>

  <p>"You've got the capital, you understand the game, you've got the
  information," he said rapidly. "I've got what you might call the book-
  keepin' ability. It's money for nothing, Mr. Evans. All you've got to do is
  to stand up an' the money rolls in. You know the ones that are dangerous, all
  you've got to do is to say polite, 'Very sorry, my book's full,' an' lay the
  duds!"</p>

  <p>"It's rather low," murmured Educated Evans, half convinced, "standin' up
  on a race-course an' makin' a exhibition of yourself."</p>

  <p>Abe grew more voluble, more urgent as he saw his great idea gaining
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Everybody knows you by name, Mr. Evans," he said. "People will simply
  flock round you...."</p>

  <p>The truth must be told: Educated Evans was seriously considering the
  possibility of "mixing it." To tip with the one hand, and to make a book with
  the other. It was delightfully simple and had been done before. And the
  prospect of standing up on Epsom Downs and shouting the odds was not
  altogether without its allurement.</p>

  <p>Ever a dreamer, he had visions of a palatial establishment in Shaftesbury
  Avenue and a big rosewood office where he could sit smoking expensive cigars
  and drinking port wine, whilst an army of clerks dealt with stacks of bets,
  mainly losing ones.</p>

  <p>"I'll do the clurking, you'll take the money&mdash;give me a quarter share
  in the book an' pay my expenses, that's all I ask, Mr. Evans," pleaded Abe.
  "You'll come home at night with your pockets full of gold an' silver
 ...."</p>

  <p>"I'll think about it," said Evans.</p>

  <p>He had already decided when strife disturbed the harmonies of Brisl Villa,
  Bayham Mews, N.W. It was due in the main to A Certain Woman. To make the
  situation perfectly clear to every reader, there were in Camden Town two Turf
  Prophets, one known wherever the Union Jack flies, and the sun never sets, as
  the World's Champion the other (this is the view of the said World's
  Champion) a miserable old man, or an usurper; a pub-propping, uneducated old
  bounder named Sam.</p>

  <p>The straw-chewing representative of the Criminal Investigation Department
  whom Camden Town called The Miller, listened sympathetically to Educated
  Evans.</p>

  <p>"She came round to me an' asked me what I meant by takin' the bread out of
  her children's mouth by givin' winners&mdash;Dio-meeds, what a beauty!"</p>

  <p>"Long odds on," murmured The Miller, "if you refer to Diomedes."</p>

  <p>"I can't help the price," retorted Educated Evans briskly. "That horse was
  give to me by the brother of the aunt of the boy who does him, but it got
  out."</p>

  <p>"And what did you say to Mrs. Lube?"</p>

  <p>"I merely told her that business was business an' that what her
  grandfather did was nothin' to do with me. She asked me if I wanted to see
  her and her children in the workhouse an' her husband rejuiced to workin' for
  his livin' like a common lab'rer. I told her I didn't care. And that's the
  result!"</p>

  <p>He fingered his cheek tenderly. The skin beneath his left eye was slightly
  swollen and very blue.</p>

  <p>"If she hadn't been a lady I'd have sloshed her!" said Evans, his voice
  trembling with pardonable annoyance. "But like King Alfred the Unready, I
  turned again an' counted six. I wouldn't hit her back even if she'd have let
  me. I sort of looked at her contemptchus."</p>

  <p>"Where were you then?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Under the bed," said Evans. "I had to go somewhere so that I didn't let
  my temper get the better of me. I ordered her out of my room. But the woman's
  got no sense of dignity."</p>

  <p>"Take a summons," suggested The Miller, in his best judicial manner.</p>

  <p>Evans coughed.</p>

  <p>"I thought of doin' it an' told her so, an' she got the poker an' started
  waggin' it under the bed. But she didn't get me&mdash;I was firm with
  her."</p>

  <p>"What on earth did you do?" demanded the astonished Miller.</p>

  <p>"I got farther under the bed," said Evans. "I beat a strategic retreat
  like the far-famed Hinderburg, the highly celebrated 'Un. An' she got
  frightened after a bit. I told her what I thought of her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"After you found that she couldn't reach you with the poker?" asked The
  Miller.</p>

  <p>"It may have been before or it may have been after," said the diplomatic
  Evans. "I told her that she wasn't educated an' ought to be ashamed of
  herself. An' she began to see that she had a pretty hard nut to deal with an'
  got out."</p>

  <p>"I'll talk to her," said The Miller, who was something of a
  peacemaker.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell her I told you." Educated Evans was alarmed. "I don't want her
  cumin' round here&mdash;I won't be responsible for what happens."</p>

  <p>"To whom?" demanded the police officer sardonically.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube, the granddaughter of Old Sam, Tipster and Ale- Eater, was a
  woman of great character and determination. She had for a brief period
  enjoyed considerable prosperity as a result of her relative's successful
  prognostication. But the return of Mr. Evans to the scene of his earlier
  activities had coincided with a slump in Old Sam's powers as a prophet. There
  was a great uneasiness in the Lubian household. Mr. Lube, her husband, was
  worried and irritable. He came home from the "Blue Peter" as many as three
  times a day to inquire into the sale of Old Sam's Midnight Special, a little
  blue card printed locally and enjoying (until Evans's return) an extensive
  sale at tuppence. On the back of this card and printed in very big type was
  the announcement:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Old Sam's Friends in the Training stables often send him a
  11th hour tip which is sent by telegram to all clients who act honourable and
  send 10/- by T.M.O.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Eventually&mdash;why not now?<br>
  Send to-day&mdash;without delay.</p><br>

  <p>It must be admitted that the latter urgent request was a blatant
  plagiarism, being pinched from the literature of Educated Evans, who in turn
  had lifted the phrases bodily from a highly respected turf accountant.</p>

  <p>When The Miller called at the little house where Old Sam slept and had his
  meals, Mrs. Lube was on the point of leaving for the pictures&mdash;the lure
  being those stupendous super-films (then showing) "Only a Mother: the story
  of a Wasted Life," and "Silk Garters&mdash;a story of Stage Life and
  Intrigue."</p>

  <p>Her face fell at the sight of The Miller. "Come in, Mr. Challinger," she
  said graciously.</p>

  <p>Sergeant Challoner, who was accustomed to having his name mutilated by
  people who invariably chose the wrongest pronunciation, followed her into the
  over-furnished parlour.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mrs. Lube," he said genially, "what is all this I hear about your
  going to see Evans and raising a fuss?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube blinked twice.</p>

  <p>"As Gawd's my judge and if I drop dead this minute an' never utter another
  syllable, I've not so much as spoken an 'arsh word against the Dirty Dog!"
  she said tremulously. I went up to see him as one lady to another gentleman
  an' all I said, without the word of a lie, an' if I die this very minute,
  was: 'Excuse me, Mr. Evins, but do you realise what you're a doin' of to a
  poor old man that 'asn't got your 'ealth and strength,' I says, an' taking
  the bread out of my children's mouth,' I says, 'with your low common tippin,
  and sayin' "Beware of spurious imitations," ' I says, 'an' look here,' I
  says, 'I know enough about you to get you ten years,' I says, an' with that
  he ups an' insults me about my lodger!"</p>

  <p>"You surprise me " said The Miller. There had been certain rumours... "I
  am surprised," he said again, and Mrs. Lube nodded.</p>

  <p>"And he called my poor dear grandfather a beer-bitin' old 'ound! So
  naturally</p>

  <p>bein' a woman with feelin's, I handed him one!"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," murmured The Miller.</p>

  <p>"An' the low, cowardly, sneakin' so-and-so&mdash;excuse my language, Mr.
  Challinger, but I'm a woman and have got my feelin's&mdash;he got under the
  bed and yelled murder! If I'd only got at him with a&mdash;with my hands, I'd
  have skull-dragged him!"</p>

  <p>Thereupon The Miller began to speak, no longer affably, but in the ominous
  fashion of detective sergeants, and what he said left Mrs. Lube unrepentant
  but in tears.</p>

  <p>She had recovered by the time her grandparent returned from lunch at the
  "Red Lion," his nearly white beard waving in the breeze.</p>

  <p>"... only a couple of pints, Agartha," he protested, "an' one of them was
  give me."</p>

  <p>"Now listen to me, grandfather," said his buxom descendant. This has gone
  on quite long enough. How many midnights do you think you've sold
  to-day&mdash;ten! You've got to rouse yourself up, gran'father; you've got to
  bustle round. I've got two Mouths to fill and All talks about sellin' the
  harmonium. Me and him and you are goin' to the races to-morrow an' you've got
  to hang round and Hear Something."</p>

  <p>"Races?" gasped her aged relative. " 'Orse races? I don't know nothing
  about 'orses. I'd get run over."</p>

  <p>"You're goin' to the Epsom races tomorrow," she said firmly. "I'm not
  goin' to allow that low, common potherb to say you don't know nothing about a
  horse except that he drinks water&mdash;that's what he said, grandfather,
  when he was under the bed&mdash;an' I'm goin' to take you down to- morrow.
  Alf's borrowed a horse an' trap an' Charlie Luce, the sign-painter, is
  getting some placards painted to put on the waggonette. Alf says it's the
  only thing to do. He's a racin' man. He says you've got to advertise. All
  you've got to do is to sit round wearin' a top hat&mdash;I got one from the
  rag-shop for fourpence. Alf will do the talkin'."</p>

  <p>Old Sam was mollified.</p>

  <p>"I can sit round in a top hat all right," he said, "if it fits."</p>

  <p>"It's got to fit. I can put a bit of paper under the lining," said the
  determined female; "and we'll have a few bottles of beer in the trap."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Old Sam. Epsom grew suddenly an attractive place.</p>

  <p>Two mornings later, all the street in which Old Sam lived gathered to see
  the resplendent waggonette which was to carry him to the field of
  victory.</p>

  <p>"Now understand this," said Alf, the oracle, as he doffed his collar.
  We've got to give a winner to-day or we're out!"</p>

  <p>"What's going to win this race?" asked Mrs. Lube.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Taping's a certainty, according to the papers, but it's no
  good giving short-priced horses. What we want is a sign. I dreamt last night
  of boiled mussels: is there a horse called Boiled Mussels running?"</p>

  <p>They searched the programme, but if Boiled Mussels existed his owner had
  neglected to enter him for any event that day.</p>

  <p>"What about asking Mr. Dimitri?" suggested Mrs. Lube helpfully, and her
  husband turned on her a disapproving eye.</p>

  <p>"I don't want no lodgers interfering with my business," he said
  coldly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dimitri was a shipping clerk employed by an Athenian firm, and
  occupied the room next to Old Sam. He was, it must be confessed, a constant
  source of friction between husband and wife, for he was young, fairly
  good-looking, and had nice manners.</p>

  <p>"I thought of asking him to come down with us," suggested Mrs. Lube.</p>

  <p>Her husband's eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"If he goes, I stay at home," he said, and Mrs. Lube, who could be very
  violent, became so.</p>

  <p>"All right, all right," said Alf, in alarm, for he had, on more occasions
  than one, been forced to take the cover which had so well served Educated
  Evans. "Don't let's have any argument."</p>

  <p>And so Mr. Dimitri, who had already arranged to go by train, being a
  thrifty Levantine, leapt at the opportunity of being conveyed free of all
  charge to Epsom Downs, with the chance of cold meat sandwiches and bottled
  beer thrown in. Thus they progressed through Streatham and Ewell, the
  cynosure of all eyes, and thus they came, Mrs. Lube furtively holding her
  lodger's hand (for her husband was driving and her grandfather was asleep) to
  the Downs.</p>

  <p>To Educated Evans, the day on which the Great Metropolitan Stakes was
  decided had been a day of splendour and glory. For the first few minutes of
  his experience, he was embarrassed, alike by the new patent-leather satchel
  he carried over his shoulder, and by the bundle of tickets which he gripped
  in his moist hand. But the novelty appealed to him. The result of the first
  race, in which, by some miracle, nobody amongst his ever-growing list of
  clients backed the winner, no less than the delightful consequence of the
  second race, where the only person who did back the winner never troubled to
  claim his money, gave him a confidence which might have had disastrous
  consequences, but for his attendant book-keeper.</p>

  <p>"Don't go shouting twenty to one the field, Mr. Evans," begged Abe, beads
  of perspiration on his face. "It's all right now, because they think you're
  kidding."</p>

  <p>"What shall I say?" asked Evans.</p>

  <p>"Say 'Five to one bar one,' " said the practical Abe.</p>

  <p>"What do I bar?" asked Evans, interested.</p>

  <p>"Anything they want to back," said Mr. Slow.</p>

  <p>He had behind him, supported on two sticks, a banner, painted
  overnight:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">EDUCATED EVANS<br>
  The World's Famous Turf Accountant.<br>
  No way barred. No Limit.<br>
  Same address for Fifty years.</p><br>

  <p>And possibly it was true that his fame had gone abroad, for a stream of
  punters flowed steadily in his direction, and his satchel grew heavy with
  illicit silver. Mr. Evans went home that night from Tattenham Corner Station,
  sitting on his bag, and spent a delirious hour counting his gains.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it, Mr. Evans?" asked his partner anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Money for nothing," said Evans. "If Screw had won instead of Brissell,
  I'd have been able to retire. We'll settle up to-morrow, Abe."</p>

  <p>Mr. Abe Slow looked dubious.</p>

  <p>"Better settle to-night," he suggested. "That's the custom in the
  profession."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans gracefully bowed to the custom and paid out one quarter of
  his winnings.</p>

  <p>He was now so engrossed in his new occupation that he almost forgot to
  send out his Five Pound Special, and would have done so for the City and
  Suburban had not The Miller happened along providentially.</p>

  <p>"Taping is a cert," said Evans. "It's waste of money to send it out."</p>

  <p>It was fortunate for all concerned that, having passed this piece of
  information on to one who received it with every evidence of scepticism and
  scorn, Evans had not time to set in motion the duplicator which a child could
  work, and Camden Town was deprived of an excuse for blasphemy.</p>

  <p>A fair morning, with a chill wind blowing; the green, rolling Downs, and a
  sky flecked with light, vaporous clouds; and a song in the heart of Educated
  Evans.</p>

  <p>The crowd was bigger than on the previous day. New clients recognised him
  with a smirk. One helped to erect the banner with the strange device, and was
  rewarded. Evans examined the book with a professional air, rustled the cards
  between his fingers, and:</p>

  <p>"I'll lay on the City! Four to one Taping, four to one Taping. Ten to one
  De Orsey, ten to one De Orsey..."</p>

  <p>And then he stopped, as his eyes fell upon a horrific sight. Near to his
  pitch a waggonette was drawn up, and its emaciated horse was being released
  from his work of bondage, preparatory to his being allowed to feed, free of
  all cost, on the grass provided by the Epsom ratepayers. It was an ancient
  waggonette; the weather-worn sides were covered with linen streamers,
  excitingly inscribed; whilst diagonally, and supported by two clothes-props
  on the waggonette, was a banner even more urgent and boastful than Mr.
  Evans's.</p><br>

  Beware of Imitators!!!</p><br>

  <p>The placards on the sides were to the same effect.</p>

  <p>"Educated Sam!" gasped Evans, growing purple. " Look at the old
  perisher!"</p>

  <p>Seated in the back was the patriarchal figure of Sam himself, his whiskers
  crumpled on his bosom, his mittened hands clasped on his stomach, a hat a
  size or so too large crushed down over his ears, for he was sleeping
  peacefully, despite the proddings of a red-faced female in black silk.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, grandfather," she said sharply. " You're 'ere."</p>

  <p>Old Sam opened his eyes and stared round.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, grandfather. Look, there's the race-'orses!"</p>

  <p>He glowered owlishly at the course, where half a dozen gaily attired
  riders were cantering up towards the five-furlong post.</p>

  <p>"Got the cards ready, grandfather " Mrs. Lube was visibly agitated. "Go
  on, Alf, say a few words."</p>

  <p>All was a stocky man with ginger hair and a drooping ginger moustache. He
  was something of an orator, having sold patent medicines in the public
  streets in the days of his youth. He got up on the driving seat and became
  talkative, and Evans listened spellbound.</p>

  <p>"Educated Sam!" he groaned hollowly. "Well, of all the sauce...!"</p>

  <p>And then a brilliant idea struck him.</p>

  <p>"Friends one and all!" His strident voice might have been heard in the
  grand stand, half a mile away. "This boozing old 'ound is trying to rob me of
  my living! He's no more educated than I&mdash;than you are. I'll lay twice
  the market odds against anything he tips."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube listened aghast. She climbed up the waggonette by the side of
  her drowsy ancestor.</p>

  <p>Go on, grandfather," she hissed. " Tip something."</p>

  <p>Old Sam pondered a moment, stroking his beard.</p>

  <p>"What's running?" he asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>Alf, the barker, turned with a marked card.</p>

  <p>"That sounds good&mdash;tip that"</p>

  <p>"Not for this race, grandfather," his intelligent grand- daughter
  protested. "Tip it for the City. If you give one for this race and it don't
  win, you'll get no more customers."</p>

  <p>"What about Taping?" asked Alf anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Look at 'em conspiring together!" sneered Evans raucously. "They've never
  so much as seen a race-horse wag his tail... !"</p>

  <p>So excited was he that he did no business on the first race, which was
  well for him, for a hot favourite won; and little business on the second
  race. It was only when they began betting on the City and Suburban that he
  came to realise his vanishing opportunities.</p>

  <p>"What about De Orsey?" asked Old Sam. He won a race the other day."</p>

  <p>"A selling race," said Alf.</p>

  <p>"He won a race," said the old man doggedly. " I see it in the paper. De
  Orsey!"</p>

  <p>Alf and his wife exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"Taping won a race, too," said Alf.</p>

  <p>"And it's easier to write, grandfather," said Mrs. Lube, who did most of
  the clerical work.</p>

  <p>"De Orsey," murmured Old Sam, and dozed off again.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Mrs. Lube uttered a squeak and pointed to their guest.</p>

  <p>"Greek... you married?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Dimitri's mouth was full of sandwich, but he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Greek Bachelor!" screamed Mrs. Lube, purple in the face. "Go on,
  Alf&mdash;bark it!"</p>

  <p>Alf was a good barker, and an example of his style may not be out of
  place...</p>

  <p>"... You see before you one of the grand old men of the turf. He's looked
  after more 'orses than any trainer going (which was true, for, in the days
  when horses were not a novelty, Old Sam drew water for them at the Red Lion
  for a penny a time, until some interfering society put on a horse trough,
  thus robbing the poor of their livelihood). "Take a look at him, and tell me,
  ladies and gentlemen, if a man like that could tell a lie! Old Sam is one of
  the most famous educated men in the country. He's writ books&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You're a liar!" roared the exasperated Evans from his pitch. " He can't
  write his own name, the thievin' old gin-hawk!"</p>

  <p>"He's writ books," said the unperturbed Alf, watching with some
  satisfaction the spectacle of Educated Evans dancing from one foot to the
  other in his impotent rage. " And they've been bought and sold, as is well
  known. He's come down here to give you the winner of the City from
  information received...."</p>

  <p>When the first of the tips came to Educated Evans, he laughed long and
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Greek Bachelor? I'll lay you fifty to one," he said recklessly. " I'll
  lay anybody fifty to</p>

  <p>one Greek Bachelor!" he roared. "I'll lay 'em a hundred to one Greek
  Bachelor. That horse ain't got no more chance of winning this celebrated race
  than the far-famed Cleopatra, the well-known needle-maker. I'll lay any price
  you like Greek Bachelor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Here, what are you doing?" asked Abe, in a ferocious whisper. "You can't
  go laying fifty to one against horses."</p>

  <p>"I'll lay a hundred to one," said Evans rashly. "Come on&mdash;roll up...
  an 'undred to one...!"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Evans in the days of his youth had been a runner. He did not run as fast
  as Greek Bachelor, but he beat his field by a longer distance. He ran into
  the landscape, so to speak, and by-and-by that portion of the howling mob
  which had not taken his satchel and divided his money, gave up the chase and
  went back to the sport of kings.</p>

  <p>Abe Slow, who, belying his name, was just behind him, shouted the news,
  but still Evans ran and did not stop until he staggered up to the gates of a
  great mansion. Here he collapsed, and when Abe came up to him Mr. Evans was
  receiving first-aid from two uniformed attendants.</p>

  <p>"What's this place?" he gasped, as he opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Banstead Lunatic Asylum," said one of the men.</p>

  <p>Abe Slow's lips curled.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to go no further, Evans," he said bitterly. " This is your
  natchral 'ome!"</p>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE FREAK DINNER</h2>

  <p class="first">ALL the world knows Frithington-Evans. At least, all the
  sporting world knows him. Even his educated namesake had heard of him. Mr.
  Frithington-Evans was an extremely rich young man, an owner of race-horses
  and a pet of a certain class of people who did not work for their living, and
  who were sometimes described as "the smart set," occasionally miscalled
  "society," but more frequently referred to as "that lot."</p>

  <p>Mr. Frithington-Evans had so much money that he could have well afforded
  to race his horses honestly. But deep down in the slither of spirituality
  which he called a soul, he had a rooted objection to anybody making money but
  himself and his friends. He was by nature suspicious, changed his trainer as
  a rule twice a year; and when he found that somebody was backing his horses,
  employed a detective agency to discover who this miscreant was, and if, by
  any chance, the unfortunate punter happened to be in Mr. Frithington- Evans'
  employ, he was summarily dismissed.</p>

  <p>Amongst his friends was Lady Mary Herban, a beautiful young lady, who was
  received in the homes of all broad-minded people. They qualified for this
  description when they received her. It was after Mr. Frithington-Evans had
  won a nice little race in the north, with a horse that had 21 lbs. in hand,
  and which started at 100/8, that Lady Mary suggested the dinner. Frithington-
  Evans wriggled and complained about the expense.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a mean little devil, Frithy," said Lady Mary severely. "You
  backed that horse s.p. with every unfortunate bookmaker in
  England&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I put you in," he pleaded. "You won a packet!"</p>

  <p>"I know you put me in, and now you can stand the dinner. We'll have a real
  racing dinner, with jockeys and bookmakers, and have canvas stretched on the
  dining-room walls and painted to look like Pontefract race- course."</p>

  <p>Frithington-Evans turned pale and rattled his keys.</p>

  <p>"That'll cost a lot of money," he. said. "And I hate freak dinners anyway!
  Look here, Mary, let's wait until&mdash;well, I've, got a nice little coup
  that's likely to come off at Chester."</p>

  <p>"We'll have it now," said Mary scornfully; and since they were very good
  friends indeed (Lady Mary's husband being abroad and wholly indifferent) the
  dinner was arranged.</p>

  <p>It is very trying for a man of delicate susceptibilities to meet the
  rebuffs and insults of common people, and the other Mr. Evans never displayed
  his fine qualities to greater advantage than when he met with a smile, in
  which contempt and mysterious understanding were blended, the ill- printed
  placards which decorated almost every newsagent's shop in Camden
  Town:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">IF YOU WANT THE BEST TIPS<br>
  OLD SAM HAS THEM!<br>
  Greek Bachelor!<br>
  Greek Bachelor!<br>
  Greek Bachelor!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">£100,000 paid to any Charity if it can be proved
     that<br>
  Old Sam did not tip Greek Bachelor for the City and Suburban.<br>
  Don't go to Educated Welshers&mdash;<br>
  Go to the Grand Old Man of Camden Town.</p><br>

  <p>Educated Evans could not afford to smile. Indeed, it was a painful
  physical effort to smile at all. Nevertheless, he met these vulgar attacks
  upon his probity with a loftiness which did credit, as some said, to his
  noble spirit, but, as others claimed, to the thickness of his hide.</p>

  <p>"Mixing it, Mr. Challoner," he explained sadly, "always leads to trouble.
  As Looey the nineteenth, him that had his napper cut off in Paris, France,
  said as he was ascending the scaffold: 'They may 'ang me, but they can't
  prove I killed the little princes in the Tower.' And that's my position, Mr.
  Challoner. I'm being persecuted like the celebrated Hougemonts, who was
  massacred in Bartholomew's Hospital; but I'm too much of a gentleman to mind.
  It's breed that counts every time."</p>

  <p>"It was very unfortunate," said The Miller sympathetically. "But whatever
  induced you to make a book?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans made a gesture of indifference. His brave heart would not allow
  him to reveal the despair which had settled on him. For the story of his
  Epsom folly had run like wildfire through Camden Town. Clients had written
  him insulting letters; he had been ordered out of the saloon bar of the "Red
  Lion" by a flaccid landlord who had uttered, in stentorian tones "We don't
  want no welshers here." Even his thick-and-thin clients had deserted him.</p>

  <p>"The public's fickle," he said philosophically. "And after Paddy! What a
  beauty, what a beauty And Dio-meeds!"</p>

  <p>Evans went home with an aching heart to Brisl Manor, still over a stable
  in Bayham Mews, locked the door and sat down in the airless, ill- furnished
  room, his head between his hands, his bruised spirit incapable of initiating
  the least movement. He heard the sound of light feet on the wooden stairs
  outside, but did not raise his head. There came a knock, and another and,
  arousing himself, he walked apathetically to the door, pulled back the bolt
  and flung it open.</p>

  <p>"What do you want&mdash;" he began, but got no farther, and stood staring
  at his visitor.</p>

  <p>She was slim and very pretty, and dressed with a simple elegance that took
  Evans's breath away. He did not recognise Lady Mary Herban, because he was no
  student of the illustrated weeklies which portray the higher branches of
  society in their moments of ease and recreation. If he had been such a
  student he would have seen pictures of Lady Mary, sitting on a shooting
  stick, pigeon-toed, at point to point meetings; he would have seen her
  smiling in groups; he would have seen studio portraits of her singly; in
  fact, it would have been very difficult for him to have missed Lady Mary, who
  appeared in these high-class publications almost as frequently as the
  advertisements of ladies' underwear.</p>

  <p>Her smile was a dazzling one; she exuded a faint perfume which went
  immediately to the head of this educated man.</p>

  <p>"May I come in?" she asked sweetly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, ma'am," stammered Evans, and she followed him into the bare
  room.</p>

  <p>"You are Mr. Evans, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded dumbly.</p>

  <p>"I am Lady Mary Herban, and I am wondering if you can help me."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my lady," he gasped, when he could find his tongue at all.</p>

  <p>"We are giving a racing dinner on Monday, and we are having a
  representative of everybody in the sporting world. We have a bookmaker who
  will lay us the odds, and we thought it would be an excellent idea if you
  would care to come as a tipster!"</p>

  <p>Evans coughed. The word chilled him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not exactly a tipster, me lady," he said. "I'm what you might term a
  Sporting Prophet. This is what you might call my office." (The tumbled bed
  belied him.)</p>

  <p>"We would pay you well, Mr. Evans," said her ladyship, who was quite
  indifferent as to whether this was the office or the boudoir of the world's
  most famous turf prophet. "The dinner will be at my house, 104 Grosvenor
  Square, and we're having the room arranged like a race-course. Everybody will
  wear morning dress, and Lord Ferrerby is bringing two horses with their
  jockeys. We do so hope, Mr. Evans, that you will be able to help us."</p>

  <p>The head of Educated Evans was in a whirl. He expected the day to produce
  little more that would assuage his misery; and here, by some beneficent
  workings of providence, he found himself plunged as if were into the vortex
  of high society.</p>

  <p>"I'll certainly do anything I possibly can. You'd like a tip for the
  Derby? Zionist is a cinch. That horse could fall down, get up and then win.
  Don't talk to me about Picaroon; don't talk to me about El Sassik; don't talk
  to me about Aon&mdash;whatever his name is. Zionist, who belongs to the
  celebrated Adjer Kan, could fall down&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," said Lady Mary soothingly. "Then I take it you will
  come, Mr. Evans? I will give you five pounds now and five pounds on the
  night. Here is the address. When you arrive at the house will you ask for my
  butler, and he will take you to a room where you can dress. We should like
  you to wear something rather loud. You don't mind, do you?"</p>

  <p>Evans did mind. He hated loudness. He preferred, and said so, to wear his
  check trousers and a classy green tie, with horseshoe complete. To his
  surprise, Lady Mary agreed that that would be a more suitable costume.</p>

  <p>As she was taking a graceful adieu:</p>

  <p>"Hold 'ard, my lady. You don't mind me saying that I've been engaged as
  private tipster to your ladyship?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all." Lady Mary seemed to be delighted at the prospect. She hated
  publicity but liked to be talked about.</p>

  <p>For an hour after she had left, Mr. Evans sat trying to put in order his
  scattered thoughts, though it was rather like trying to catalogue the sparks
  at a fireworks display. And then the possibilities of this adventure began to
  take hold of him. There would be present at the dinner loftily owners,
  possibly aristocratic trainers, certainly a jockey or two. He might stock
  himself for a year on the information to be gleaned at that remarkable
  banquet.</p>

  <p>Putting on his hat, he hurried forth in search of his oracle and The
  Miller, who had had a pretty unpleasant morning at the police court, was not
  at first in a mood to advise him.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary Herban!" he said. "That woman would raid herself at a night
  club to get her name in the papers!"</p>

  <p>Educated Evans began to look upon life from a new angle. The jauntiness
  returned to his step; the smile which greeted the placarded slanders of Old
  Sam became natural. Here he was, private turf adviser to the aristocracy! He
  had been chosen, of all the thousands of members of his profession, to
  represent the fraternity. It was not unpleasing.</p>

  <p>He made at least two visits to Grosvenor Square, and from the opposite
  side of the street regarded with rapture and awe the magnificent mansion
  which held so rare a jewel as Lady Mary Herban, and in which he would figure,
  to the confounding of his detractors and the utter annihilation of his senile
  rival. Such things are reported in the newspapers. On the following morning
  he would see:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Amongst those present at Lady Mary Herban's select and
  aristocratic party was the well-known Educated Evans, whose celebrated tips
  are all the go just now. Mr. Evans, a tall, good-looking man in the early
  forties, replying to the toast of his health, said&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>The relatives of Old Sam, not unnaturally jubilant at the turn of
  fortune's wheel, had at the same time no doubt about the elasticity of their
  enemy.</p>

  <p>To them came a distorted rumour of Mr. Evans' noble patronage.</p>

  <p>"That feller would swank hisself into Buckin'ham Palace," said Mrs. Lube,
  granddaughter and manager of the aged Sam. "Alf, don't let him out of your
  sight! If he's goin' to a lord's party, as he says he is, he's bound to get
  soused and you ought to be able to get anything out of him!"</p>

  <p>"He ain't goin' to any party!" said her husband contemptuously. "It's all
  talk!"</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Lube was not of that opinion.</p>

  <p>The Miller says he is&mdash;he told a lady friend of mine. Alf, that man
  would swank hisself into the Bank of England. Watch him!"</p>

  <p>Little did Mr. Evans know that from thence onward he was under
  observation.</p>

  <p>It was seven o'clock on a pleasant spring evening when he descended the
  area steps in Grosvenor Square (Mr. and Mrs. Lube watching furtively from the
  corner of the square) and was received somewhat haughtily by Lady Mary's
  butler. Lady Mary's butler, Simmings, was less impressive than ordinary by
  reason of the fact that all the servants of the house had been ordered to
  array themselves in sporting attire. And Mr. Simmings was certainly too stout
  for a jockey.</p>

  <p>"Come in, come in," he said testily. "Henry, show this man up to the
  dressing-room... lot of stuff and nonsense! I never heard of such rubbish in
  my life...."</p>

  <p>Henry, who was also dressed as a jockey, and rather fancied himself, for
  he was thin and had legs like straws, led the way up the stairs into the big
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Want to see this show before it starts?" he asked, and, pushing open the
  door, Evans saw an amazing sight.</p>

  <p>The room had been converted into a race-course. The table, which ran down
  the centre, was covered with green cloth, and a winning-post had been erected
  at one end where Lady Mary was to sit. The walls had been converted by the
  scene-painter into an idealised race-course. The floor was covered by a rough
  green cloth; a judge's box, real rails and a saddling bell had been added to
  the usual garniture of the room.</p>

  <p>"They talked about bringing 'orses here," said Henry, "but they can't get
  'em up the steps. You're a tipster, ain't you? What d'you know?"</p>

  <p>Evans thought it was a moment to assert his dignity.</p>

  <p>"I'm Mr. Evans, the celebrated Turf Adviser," he said, with a touch of
  hauteur, "and as the celebrated Richard Cower de Lion, the well- known Gay
  Crusader, said to his brother, the Duke of Clarence, who was drownded in a
  bottle of claret: 'You keep your place and I'll keep mine.' "</p>

  <p>The impressed Henry handed him over to one of the servants hired for the
  day, and. who alone were dressed like civilised waiters. He was taken up to
  the third floor, where, as he understood from Henry, he was to wait until he
  was called for. The gloomy, middle-aged man who escorted him to his room had
  views of a communistic, not to say bolshevistic, type.</p>

  <p>"If the money these 'ere burjoises were spending on this kind of muck was
  give to the poor, comrade, this'd be a land fit for 'eroes to live in. But
  the day is coming," he added darkly, "when the burjoises will know all about
  it "</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" asked Evans, a little hazy.</p>

  <p>"It's them that's got what you ain't got," was the cryptic reply.</p>

  <p>Henry, the jockey, came up to see him, and Evans learned that he would not
  be required until half-past nine, when the dinner was over, and he was left
  to rehearse his speech, which began:</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen,&mdash;Education, as everybody knows, is one of the
  grandest things in the world, and I stand before you to-day, an exposition of
  erudition and brainwork versus guesswork and picking 'em out with a
  pin...."</p>

  <p>From below, when he opened the door, came the sound of revelry and
  laughter. The dinner had begun, and he paced the little room, repeating his
  speech, stopping now and again to fasten his white spats, which constantly
  came undone... There was a knock at the door: it was the socialistic servant,
  and he had in his hand a telegram.</p>

  <p>"They ain't half goin' it downstairs," he said gloomily. "Wine flowin'
  like water! Little do they know what's waitin' 'em! This is for you."</p>

  <p>Evans took the telegram from his hand: it was addressed "Evans, 104
  Grosvenor Square." He opened it in wonder. Only The Miller knew he was
  attending this dinner party.</p>

  <p>The wire was addressed from a little training centre west of Newbury, and
  it had been handed in at one o'clock that day, but apparently had been
  readdressed.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">EVANS, 104, GROSVENOR SQUARE. TRIED LONGLEGS A CERTAINTY
  ADVISE YOU RUN HIM WEDNESDAY AND HAVE A GOOD BET.</p><br>

  <p>It was signed with the name of Mr. Frithington-Evans' latest trainer.</p>

  <p>For a long time the educated man did not understand his good fortune, and
  then he began a frantic effort to lick down the torn flap.</p>

  <p>"This is for another gentleman," he said, " not for me. Take it down to
  him."</p>

  <p>"One of the burjoises?" asked the waiter, with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"He's worse than that," said Mr. Evans.</p>

  <p>Longlegs! he thought, as the door closed upon the hired waiter. What a
  chance to rehabilitate himself with the sceptics of Camden Town! He had
  hardly reached this conclusion when the door was flung open violently, and a
  red-faced young man exploded into the room.</p>

  <p>"Here, you fellow, what the devil do you mean by opening my telegrams?" he
  demanded wrathfully. " This was addressed to me."</p>

  <p>"My name's Evans too," said Mr. Evans gently. " Perhaps we're related.
  We've had some very flighty people in our family, my uncle Joe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you read it, confound you!" roared the agitated Frithy.</p>

  <p>"I certainly read it&mdash;" began Evans.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you did, did you?" said the gentleman between his teeth, and, before
  Evans realised what had happened, the door had slammed and he heard the click
  of a turning lock.</p>

  <p>Frithy flew downstairs. Lady Mary was waiting in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth did you dash away? We're only just beginning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That&mdash;that&mdash;..."spluttered Mr. Frithington- Evans, pointing
  dramatically up the stairs, "has got the best thing of the year in his
  possession! Do you realise what that means, Mary? He'll spread it all over
  London. The damned thing will start at six to four... oh, my God! why did I
  come to this party?"</p>

  <p>She saw that the situation was a serious one. Mr. Frithington-Evans was in
  danger of losing money.</p>

  <p>"What can we do? she asked, for she also spelt life with an</p>

  <p>"He's got to be kept there until the race is over. Under no circumstances
  is he to be allowed to leave the house or use the telephone. You've got to
  put a servant on to watch him day and night. As for that cursed trainer, I'll
  fire him as soon as the race is over. The fool, to wire!"</p>

  <p>He conveniently forgot that he had left strict instructions that the
  result of the trial should be sent to his house in Berkshire.</p>

  <p>Evans waited with growing impatience for the summons that came not. As the
  horror of his position gained on him, Educated Evans grew deathly pale.</p>

  <p>Outside in the dark of Grosvenor Square two people were in earnest
  conversation. It's makin' a fool of me," said Mr. Alf Lube bitterly,
  "bringin' me here an' keepin' me without so much as a drink &mdash;what
  for?"</p>

  <p>His lady wife answered with ominous calm. "He'll come out in a minute,
  oiled to the world," she said malignantly, "an' if he's got information we'll
  get it, Alf. I'm not takin' risks&mdash;I've got two mouths to fill an'
  grandfather might pop off any day."</p>

  <p>"It's makin' a fool of me," said Alf, but wisely uttered no other
  protest.</p>

  <p>It was nearing midnight, and Evans was lying down on the little bed, when
  a step outside the door brought him to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Are you awake?"</p>

  <p>It was the socialistic waiter, and the hollowness of his voice through the
  keyhole sent a shiver down Evans' spine.</p>

  <p>"They're goin' to do you in," said the voice pleasantly. "That burjoise
  that the wire was meant for says you've got to be kept here for a
  week&mdash;they're goin' to starve you to death, comrade."</p>

  <p>"Are they&mdash;comrade?" quavered Evans.</p>

  <p>"The best thing you can do is to tie your sheets together and let yourself
  down to the street. Me and a couple of comrades will stand underneath and
  catch you if you fall. Long live the revolution!"</p>

  <p>"What revolution " asked Evans.</p>

  <p>"Wot's coming," said the waiter, and immediately crept away.</p>

  <p>Evans opened the window and, looking down four storeys, withdrew, dizzy.
  To knot three sheets together and lower yourself from a fourth- story window
  is a very easy matter in books; but when there are no sheets, the
  difficulties increase. Moreover, Evans had never knotted anything together in
  his life.</p>

  <p>Another simple plan was to climb up to the roof, tap the telephone wires
  and call the police; but as against this, he couldn't climb, and he had never
  tapped anything except an old friend in his more impecunious moments.</p>

  <p>Midnight came one o'clock struck&mdash;two. And then, looking out of the
  open window, by the light of a street lamp he saw two people. They were the
  comrades who had come to catch him when he jumped, he guessed. Nevertheless,
  he did not jump.</p>

  <p>And then a brilliant idea struck him. Pulling a paper from one pocket and
  a pencil from another, he wrote:</p>

  <p class="letter">Please take this to Sergeant Challoner, the well-known
  Miller.</p>

  <p>And, underneath:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">DEAR MR. CHALLONER&mdash;This comes hoping to find you
  quite well as I am not. Longlegs is a stone certainty for the Leigh Handicap.
  Would you kindly oblige by asking somebody to send this for me to all
  clients, old and new?</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours truly,</p>

  <p class="letter">EDUCATED EVANS.</p><br>

  <p>Wrapping the paper around half a crown, he threw it, and had the
  satisfaction of seeing one of the watchers pick it up...</p>

  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Lube hurried home with the paper which had fallen into their
  hands, and half an hour later were reading the message. When they had
  finished:</p>

  <p>"A trap," said Mrs. Lube. "The artful old rat! He spotted us watchin' and
  tried to catch us. This letter goes round to The Miller&mdash;we'll send a
  boy with it. Let 'em send it out! Longlegs&mdash;I'll give him Longlegs!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Lube pocketed the half-crown and felt that he was in some measure
  repaid for his vigil.</p>

  <p>And when, two days later, Longlegs won at 100/8, and Mr. Evans was
  released from captivity with a ten-pound note and a warning to keep away from
  Grosvenor Square, there was rejoicing in Bayham Mews.</p>

  <p>"And let me tell you, Evans," said The Miller firmly, "that you'll get me
  hung if you send me letters like that. What do you think my inspector would
  say?"</p>

  <p>"He'd say 'What a beauty!' Mr. Challoner," said Educated Evans.</p>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10"></a>X. &mdash; THE USER OF MEN</h2>

  <p class="first">BY some miracle, Educated Evans had recovered his prestige
  in Camden Town. Possibly it was the reaction from the failure of Old Sam,
  that ancient impostor, whose Midnight Special had napped six successive
  odds-on chances, only one of which succeeded in finishing in the first
  three.</p>

  <p>It was significant that a certain railway Goods Yard, which is a solid
  body of public opinion, had turned to Evans after the remarkable victory of
  Longlegs at Chester, and that not only had they paid for this incomparable
  selection, but many of them had acted honourably afterwards. Evans had
  received two large Scottish salmon, with their labels obviously torn off, a
  bushel of apples with a label pasted over, and a small case containing three
  bottles of invalid wine. And then Siezem had won at Warwick at the surprising
  price of 100-6, and Siezem had been the Double Nap Fear Nothing Help Yourself
  Midday Special of Educated Evans.</p>

  <p>"I got it from the boy who does him," said the exultant man of learning.
  "I've had that information locked up, so to speak, in my bosom for munce and
  munce. I've been waiting for him, I've been watching his gallops, and at last
  I says, 'To-day's the day.' "</p>

  <p>"The story you told me last night," said the patient Miller, "was that you
  got so fed up with trying to find a winner that you shut your eyes and stuck
  it with a pin. But perhaps you're more truthful when you're sober?"</p>

  <p>"I had two half-pints last night," said Evans reproachfully. "It's the
  'eat makes me go funny like that."</p>

  <p>Down in the little street where Old Sam had his habitation there was a
  great deal of heartburning, and not a little wrath. There was also a crisis.
  Mrs. Lube was in her most vixenish mood. Not so Old Sam, who sat before the
  empty firegrate, his eyes closed, humming snatches of songs, the most modern
  of which was " Tarara-boomdeay!"</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised at you, grandfather," said his exasperated relative.
  "Sitting there as drunk as a lord and not caring whether me and my two poor
  children are in the workhouse. Why don't you go and find things?"</p>

  <p>"Greek Bachelor&mdash;what a beauty!" murmured Old Sam. "What a beauty,
  what a beauty!"</p>

  <p>He repeated "What a beauty!" about forty times, until his voice sank to
  nothingness and his head followed suit. Mrs. Lube looked at her husband.</p>

  <p>"I've got forty pounds," she said deliberately.</p>

  <p>Her husband started.</p>

  <p>"You never have? Then a sense of his wrongs came uppermost. "And last</p>

  <p>week I asked you to lend me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've got forty pounds, saved&mdash;from the wreck."</p>

  <p>She nodded at the wreck, who, blissfully unconscious of this
  uncomplimentary reference, was sleeping noisily.</p>

  <p>"And I've got something to do with my money besides givin' it to you to
  guzzle away. I'm going to take him into partnership."</p>

  <p>"Who?" asked her lawful husband, his mind flying instantly to a certain
  undesirable Greek lodger.</p>

  <p>"That Evans." The words almost choked her.</p>

  <p>"Give him money?" All Lube was incredulous.</p>

  <p>"I'm goin' to take him into partnership. He's doin' too well. That's what
  Mr. Elmer of the 'Red Lion' said to me: 'Why don't you go into partnership?
  What's the good of competition?' "</p>

  <p>Her husband had only the vaguest idea of what constituted a partnership,
  and what mysterious ritual preceded its creation.</p>

  <p>"There's no sense in scrappin' with him. What we've got to do is to make a
  partnership, get his addresses, make as much use of them as we can, and
  then&mdash;"She snapped her fingers tragically. The outlook for Educated
  Evans was not a promising one.</p>

  <p>To approach her victim was a delicate business. Mr. Evans saw her coming
  up the steps and locked his door. It was difficult to negotiate an
  amalgamation of interests through the little window which looked out on to
  the landing, with half the inhabitants of Bayham Mews forming an interested
  audience.</p>

  <p>"I don't want no truck with you, Mrs. What's-your-name," said Evans, pale
  but determined, and keeping at a reasonable distance from the open window,
  which, fortunately, was too small for an ample lady to climb through.</p>

  <p>"Let bygorns be bygorns," pleaded Mrs. Lube. I want to live in 'armony.
  Forty pounds is forty pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forty pounds&mdash;ha ha ha!" Evans' laugh was sardonic and scornful. "
  Forty pound for half a share of my business! What I'm gettin' thousan's an'
  thousan's for! Woman, you're mad! Go away before I forget I'm a
  gentleman!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube swallowed something.</p>

  <p>"Think it over, Mr. Evans," she said, with a grimace which was intended as
  a smile.</p>

  <p>Evans pointed to the steps.</p>

  <p>"Go!" he said dramatically.</p>

  <p>Every man's favourite dream usually centres around easy money. Educated
  Evans used to dope himself to sleep with a story of his own creation. It was
  about a foreigner who had robbed a foreign bank, had escaped to London with
  negotiable property in a large handbag, and, in a moment of mental
  aberration, had deposited the bag on Educated Evans' doorstep, and, having
  thus disposed of his ill-gotten wealth, went away and drowned himself. Better
  men than Educated Evans will read this and start guiltily.</p>

  <p>And now, it seemed that the dream of years was to come true; for fate, in
  a sealskin coat, had descended upon him, and the days and hours he should
  have spent analysing the relative merits of thoroughbred race- horses, were
  occupied in the compilation of balance-sheets. Thus:</p>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1305241h-images/EE2-02.jpg"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>It was not a balance-sheet which would pass the average auditor, for Evans
  had put at least one item on the wrong side of the sheet.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that money in large quantities could be made, and there
  is less doubt that Mr. Evans, given the necessary capital, would make it.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lucy Tarbet could provide that capital. She had wealth beyond
  imagining. Two resplendent public-houses, house properties outside of
  computation, money at the bank, jewels rare and costly, a little flat of her
  own in the most elegant part of Regent's Park. It seemed that Mr. Evans'
  dream had come true.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Tarbet, with a bland smile, to her nearest and dearest
  friend, "he is a funny little fellow&mdash;common as dirt, but quite comic in
  his way. Mind you, he's got a headpiece all right. But he's like the rest of
  them, my dear "she sighed very heavily, as only a stout lady can
  sigh&mdash;"he's after the money!"</p>

  <p>"I can't see how you can take up with a common man who's only a low,
  vulgar tipster, Lou," said her friend, who had almost as many diamond rings
  as Mrs. Tarbet, and owned quite a number of greengrocer's shops in the north
  of London.</p>

  <p>"I've not taken up with him," said the amiable Mrs. Tarbet. "I'm not
  taking up with any man, not after my experience with George. Men! I use 'em,
  my dear! Come upstairs and see my new dress. I got it from Way's and it's a
  dream..."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>On the following Saturday The Miller was talking with the official on duty
  at the members' entrance at Hurst Park, when a man walked briskly past them.
  He wore a peaked cap, around the band of which were the words " Hurst Park
  Race Club," and he carried in his hand an important-looking blue
  envelope.</p>

  <p>"Who is that bird?" asked the discreet detective.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;one of the ground men, I expect," said the
  officer.</p>

  <p>The Miller passed through the motor enclosure on the heels of the
  messenger, followed him across the course and over the members' lawn into the
  paddock.</p>

  <p>Still the man with the blue envelope walked on, until he disappeared in an
  outbuilding. The Miller waited. Presently the man came out, minus his
  envelope and wearing a crushed-looking trilby hat.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Evans."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans was momentarily startled.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been on the staff of this race-course?" asked The
  Miller sternly.</p>

  <p>For a second the educated man was embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"It's a mild form of deception, if I may use the expression," he said,
  "but nobody loses nothing by it. If I didn't get into Tatt's this way I
  shouldn't come in at all, so, in a manner of speakin', the stewards don't
  lose so much as a tosser. There's a horse in the first race that's money for
  jam. I've had him from the boy who does him. He was tried with the celebrated
  Golly Eyes an' walked away from him. Mugman's the name, help yourself but
  keep it dark."</p>

  <p>The Miller sighed.</p>

  <p>"Evans, I'm compounding a felony by not pinching you&mdash;my kind heart
  will be the ruin of me. I suppose you've got a collection of cap-bands and
  use a different one for each horse?"</p>

  <p>"All except Ascot," confessed Evans modestly. "It's one of the best lot of
  cap-bands you ever see. I call 'em my members' badges."</p>

  <p>"What was in the envelope?</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Evans shamelessly. "It's got 'To the
  Secretary&mdash;Urgent' on it. Nobody don't dare stop you if you've got that.
  It's as much as their job's worth."</p>

  <p>Here, the representative of the law thought, was an opportune moment to
  deliver a lecture on morality. Evans listened meekly.</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you, Mr. Challoner, an' I won't do it again. Honesty
  begins at home, as I always say, an' as the famous Lord Wolsey&mdash;him that
  haunts Hampton Court&mdash;said, 'If I'd only looked after myself like I've
  looked after other people, I shouldn't be drawin' the dole.' That's a
  nice-lookin' horse, Mr. Challoner!"</p>

  <p>He pointed to an animal which was being led round by a groom.</p>

  <p>"He looks like Zionist to me&mdash;I'd recernise the horse
  anywhere&mdash;I see him do a gallop up at Wantage. Funny how some people can
  recernise horses an' other people can't&mdash;that's Zionist all right."</p>

  <p>"To be exact, it is the starter's hack," said The Miller patiently.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" Evans was respectfully interested. "I didn't know the Adjer
  Kan had sold him. It only shows, Mr. Challoner, what horses come down to. As
  the highly respected Dr. Johnstone said, 'The more I see of horses the more I
  like dogs.' That's a funny-lookin' horse goin' into the ring. I wouldn't back
  her with bad money. Look at &gt;her feet&mdash;look at her ribs!"</p>

  <p>The Miller consulted his card.</p>

  <p>"That is Mugman. Presently we shall see him fall down, get up and
  <i>then</i> win! he said quietly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans coughed.</p>

  <p>"Looks ain't everything," he said, very truly.</p>

  <p>"How is business, Evans?" The Miller was kind enough to change the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"Not so bad." Mr. Evans was surprisingly indifferent. "Camden Town's no
  good to a man like me. I'm thinkin' of takin' a office at Newmarket an' doin'
  things on the big scale. Advertisements everywhere&mdash;balloons over
  Epsom&mdash;sanwidge men with boards up an' down the West End."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Mr. Challoner was politely sceptical. "Have you come into a
  fortune?" Evans considered this question.</p>

  <p>"In a sense&mdash;yes," he said, and went on: "You haven't seen my young
  lady about, have you?"</p>

  <p>He grew rosy under the stern eye of his companion.</p>

  <p>"Did she have a cap-band too?" asked The Miller. "Or did she wear the cap
  and apron of a tea-room waitress "</p>

  <p>"Her? Evans was slightly amused. "She's got money of her own&mdash;an'
  what a lady! Manners! You never saw manners like 'em. Talks French better
  than a Frenchman. Hongri, the celebrated French waiter, said that he don't
  understand some of the words she uses. That's class. Here " His voice sank.
  "I'll introduce you!"</p>

  <p>A lady was approaching them. She was, The Miller guessed, lingering in the
  thirties, and she was, not to put too fine a point on it, on the stout side.
  Without being pretty she was pleasant; the pink of her cheeks was a deep
  pink.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Tarbet, permittez moi to introduce you to my friend, Mr. Challoner,"
  said Evans, who had evidently acquired the French language.</p>

  <p>"Excuse fingers," said Mrs. Tarbet briskly. "I've just been eating fish.
  Ain't it hot? You're here, then?" This to Evans, who smirked foolishly. " I
  been lookin' all over the place for you. What's goin' to win this first race?
  Mugman? Don't make me laugh. I've got a tip for Ooji from one of our
  customers. So long! I'll see you at Assizes."</p>

  <p>With this bright quip she passed on.</p>

  <p>"She's never, so to speak, at a loss for an answer," said the admiring
  Evans. "Witty? She'd make a cat laugh!"</p>

  <p>"Barmaid?" asked The Miller, who was not easily amused.</p>

  <p>"She owns property," said Evans impressively: "two public- houses an' a
  block of flats!"</p>

  <p>"And you come into the last category," said The Miller, who occasionally
  employed words which were more Greek than French to Educated Evans.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later he joined the lady in the sealskin coat.</p>

  <p>"Who was that bird you introduced me to, Evans?" she asked, a little
  resentfully. "Don't go introducin' me to your race-course friends, I
  beg."</p>

  <p>"He's one of the stewards," exaggerated Mr. Evans, and the lady was
  mollified. They had met at the cinema; she had trodden on his toe by accident
  (for she was ladylike and would not descend to a vulgar subterfuge) and at
  his invitation they had supped together at Isaacs' Fish Bar. She was a widow
  and lonely. She admired cleverness and education. Mr. Evans had the goods. He
  was both clever and educated. At Isaac's fish bar she learned for the first
  time that the world went round the sun once in twenty-four hours, that people
  used to be hung at Marble Arch, and that Ormonde won the Derby in a snow-
  storm and had to have butter put on his feet to help him slip round Tattenham
  Corner. She was also instructed in medieval history, and discovered that
  B&mdash; Mary, Queen of Scotch, was not all that a lady should be, and that
  Julius Caesar, the far-famed Italian, signed the Magna Charter and laid the
  foundations of the Rules of Racing.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, being a monied woman, she was not willing to submit her
  intelligence to the domination of any man, however learned.</p>

  <p>"Come along and see this race, and we'll have a chat afterwards about The
  Business. I don't want to put my money into anything that I can't see my way
  out of."</p>

  <p>The moral position of Educated Evans was strengthened when Mugman
  scrambled home a head in front of the horse he had backed. Even Mrs. Lucy
  Tarbet was impressed.</p>

  <p>"Logic an' deduction an' information v. guesswork," murmured Evans,
  surreptitiously tearing up the ticket which, if the second had won, would
  have brought him five very necessary pounds. "That horse was sent out to
  three thousand clients...." Then, remembering that she would certainly want
  to see his books, "or, rather, would have been sent out, only I was in such a
  hurry to meet you that I only had time to send thirty wires. If I had a bit
  of capital..."</p>

  <p>He enlarged upon the prospects. Mrs. Tarbet listened thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"How much do you want?" she asked. Evans dared not say, in case he put the
  figure too low.</p>

  <p>"Thousands," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Fiddlesticks " said Mrs. Tarbet scornfully. "I wouldn't mind putting
  fifty pounds into it."</p>

  <p>The hopes of Educated Evans fell with a dull, sickening thud.</p>

  <p>"Fifty!" he laughed hollowly. "Why, fifty pounds wouldn't go nowhere!"</p>

  <p>She nibbled the end of her glove, frowning. "Do you know any other horse
  that's going to win to-day?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Evans smiled.</p>

  <p>"Brass Nail is a stone certainty," he said. "The common people will back
  Blue Nose. An' in the last race High Up can't be beat. I got him from a
  servant girl who's got a sister who walks out with the head lad."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," said Mrs. Tarbet. " just wait here."</p>

  <p>She hurried into the ring and came back with a smile of triumph.</p>

  <p>"I said I'd put fifty pounds into your business. Well, I've put it on your
  horse! We'll see what happens. I've got ten to one with my friend Mr. Izzy
  Friedman."</p>

  <p>Evans looked at her wildly.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to waste money like that for?" he blurted.</p>

  <p>"Waste?" Mrs. Tarbet's eyebrows went up.</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly waste," said the palpitating Evans. "But putting all
  that money on... it ain't much, but it might do a bit of advertising."</p>

  <p>"Don't let us discuss it," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>He followed her, a miserable man, back to the ring. His misery was not
  long-lived. Brass Nail made all the running and won by a neck.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps you're right after all," he beamed. " Five hundred and
  fifty&mdash;you can do a lot with five hundred and fifty."</p>

  <p>"Ye-es," said Mrs. Tarbet thoughtfully. " Tell me that bit about High Up
  again."</p>

  <p>"You're not going to back another horse?" said Evans, in alarm. "With five
  hundred and fifty we could do some advertising</p>

  <p>She made an impatient noise.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us talk business, please, Mr. Evans," she said, and he was
  crushed to silence.</p>

  <p>Just before the last race, she found him leaning miserably over the rails
  of the saddling ring.</p>

  <p>"I've just seen a friend of mine, and he says that High Up hasn't got any
  chance at all."</p>

  <p>"I don't care nothing about what he says," said the wretched Evans. "If
  you're going to back horses, back 'em! If you're going to tip horses, tip
  'em! You can't mix it. I've tried. What I say is this: put two hundred pounds
  into advertisin', put two hundred pounds into a office; put a hundred into
  expenses, keep fifty for yourself...."</p>

  <p>But he was addressing the air. Mrs. Tarbet was making her rapid way back
  to Tattersall's.</p>

  <p>He roused himself sufficiently to stroll into the ring, climb to the top
  of the littered stand, and watch a race which had no more interest for him
  than the golden dome of the stewards' stand. He didn't even know the colours
  of High Up, and until he saw the number in the frame and consulted his card,
  he was not aware that High Up had won. And then, with a wildly beating heart,
  he dashed down into the ring.</p>

  <p>"What price was that?" he asked, almost incoherently.</p>

  <p>"Four to one," somebody told him, and he flew through Tattersall's into
  the paddock, searching vainly for his inamorata.</p>

  <p>She was standing talking to a number of obese friends when he flew up to
  her, his face beaming.</p>

  <p>"You was right after all, Lucy," he said.</p>

  <p>She transfixed him with an icy stare: obviously she was in a very bad
  temper.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Tarbet, if you please," she snapped. "Please go away. I don't want
  to hear any more about your beastly horses. If you don't go, I'll call a
  policeman!"</p>

  <p>Evans reeled back, pallid of face, as these words fell from the fresh red
  lips of the User of men. He tried to speak, but she silenced him with a
  gesture, and dejectedly he slouched across the paddock, his hands in his
  pockets, the picture of misery.</p>

  <p>He was wandering towards the open horse gate, and as he was half-way
  between the unsaddling ring and the gate, the horses were coming in. And
  between the jockeys on the first two there was something like unpleasantness.
  Evans heard...</p>

  <p>"... you bored me out from the rails, you dirty dog... . Of course I'm
  going to object...."</p>

  <p>An objection! Evans was electrified. This fat vampire had friends in the
  ring. At the word "Objection!" she would fly to one of her bookmaking pals
  and save her money. Hell hath no fury like a turf prophet scorned. He would
  be avenged on this woman. Instantly, as the idea took shape, he turned and
  raced across the paddock. Mrs. Tarbet was still talking to one of her
  friends, and at the sight of the dishevelled Evans her face clouded.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Tarbet, for one minute. I've something very important to
  say to you," he begged urgently. "It's not about business, it's about
  somethin' that's goin' to happen next week..."</p>

  <p>Excuse me," she said frigidly to her friend, and consented to walk with
  Evans out of earshot.</p>

  <p>What wild story he told her, he never remembered. It was evidently
  something fascinating, for she listened open-mouthed, her attention so
  concentrated that she never heard the cry of "Objection!"</p>

  <p>There was no need for her to go into the ring. She had arranged for her
  money to be sent to her by cheque. After about five minutes. . . .</p>

  <p>"I don't know what on earth you're talking about, Evans," she said
  raucously. "You're simply wasting my time with a lot of nonsense about a
  horse that'll run on Wednesday. I don't want any of your tips, and I don't
  want any more to do with you. You're simply coming after my money, and I
  can't stand spongers."</p>

  <p>Evans could swallow the insult and smile. He must keep her engaged in
  conversation so that there was no possibility of her saving her money. The
  red flag was flying but this Mrs. Tarbet did not notice. And then a blessed
  word reached him. Somebody shouted "Sustained!" and the faint sound of it
  came to his ears. At that moment Evans was magnificent.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very kindly for your attention, Mrs. Tarbet, and I can only
  say, in conclusion, that, having done in your stuff, we'll cry quits."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;'done in my stuff,' you guttersnipe?" she asked
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"Your horse is disqualified," he hissed. "Rat's Tail has got the race on
  an objection!"</p>

  <p>"High Up disqualified!" she shrieked. "My Gawd! I backed Rat's Tail!"</p>

  <p align="center">XI. &mdash; THE LADY WATCH DOG</p>

  <p>SATAN, the original labour exchange for Idle Hands, put it into the heart
  of Alf Lube that the diamond-encircled wristwatch worn by Mrs. Arabella Fich,
  the proprietress of the "Three Dogs" public-house in Stibbington Street,
  could do him a bit of good. Mrs. Fich was an absentminded woman and had the
  habit, when she assisted in the bar, to put her watch on a little shelf at
  the back of the bar. A man (said the Evil One) with a long reach and a
  walking- stick, could hook out that watch without the slightest exertion.</p>

  <p>One Thursday evening, when trade was very bad, Mr. Lube turned into the
  saloon bar and found its other occupant a solitary man sitting on a high
  stool and thoughtfully regarding a glass of whisky and water. Mr. Lube's lip
  curled.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Evans," he said coarsely. "Been welshing lately?"</p>

  <p>Educated Evans regarded him with the look of a wounded fawn.</p>

  <p>"Politeness costs nothing," he said mildly.</p>

  <p>"Been down to Epsom lately?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans did not reply.</p>

  <p>"I wonder a man like you's got the nerve to show himself in a bar
  parlour," nagged Alf. "Here, missis, give me a small bitter. I can't afford
  whisky&mdash;I don't welsh."</p>

  <p>"Nor work," said Evans, still regarding his glass.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lube's chubby face darkened.</p>

  <p>"I don't welsh," he said.</p>

  <p>"Nor work," said Evans absently; "not since you come out of stir,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>It was true that on three occasions Lube had been put away for trifling
  offences. But to be told by a man like Evans....</p>

  <p>"You're askin' for it!" he said, breathing through his nose. "I've killed
  men for less than that!</p>

  <p>Evans lifted his glass, smelt the contents and drank leisurely.</p>

  <p>"You're an uneducated man," he said, after the last gurgle, "and if Old
  Sam wasn't keepin' you, you'd be in Pentonville. As for your wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't say a word against my wife!" hissed Mr. Lube, making a
  fear-inspiring grimace and edging closer.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry for you, Lube," said Mr. Evans, getting down from his stool.
  "You can't help your misfortune. Buy yourself a drink."</p>

  <p>He put down sixpence on the counter and walked out. Lube glared after him,
  pouched the sixpence and drank his bitter bitterly.</p>

  <p>He was not a fighting man. And Evans had spoken the truth. The Lube family
  was at the point of crisis. That very night his wife had refused him a
  shilling, though she knew that his dole was due on the morrow. Moreover, she
  had refused him the wherewithal to go to Kempton.</p>

  <p>His eyes, roving the bar, rested on the sparkling watch half hidden from
  view between two claret glasses. He knew a fence at Finsbury who would give
  him at least a fiver for that. Mr. Lube hesitated. It was so long since he
  had broken the law that he had almost acquired the habit of honesty. The four
  ale bar was empty; the barmaid was at the other end of the bar, her back
  towards him, engrossed in a book. He lifted his walking-stick tentatively,
  laid it on the counter, stretched... The watch dropped in his pocket. In a
  few seconds he was in the street.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you, Alf?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube was engaged in preparing a rough balance sheet of Old Sam's
  Midnight Special when her husband came in. One glance at his face told her
  everything, for his was an easy face to read.</p>

  <p>"Nothin'." He was very jerky of speech. "Thought I'd go up an' see a
  friend of mine at Finsbury&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She held out her large hand.</p>

  <p>"Drop," she said tersely.</p>

  <p>Alf spluttered, bullied, lied, but in the end the watch was lying in her
  palm.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Fich's," she said calmly. "You're a nice father of a family, I don't
  think!"</p>

  <p>He tried to bluster his way out. By accident he touched the right
  note.</p>

  <p>"It's that 'ound Evans&mdash;he got me wild, the way he talked about you
  an'&mdash;an' the lodger. He said no wonder we tipped Greek Bachelor...."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dimitri, the nice-looking Greek lodger, had departed from the home of
  the Lubes after a terrific scene. Alf felt he might put into Mr. Evans' mouth
  some of the private thoughts on the subject which he had not hitherto dared
  to express on his own behalf.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he did, did he?" said Mrs. Lube, grey with fury. "An' you sat round
  an' said nothing! A dam' fine husband you are!"</p>

  <p>One lie was as easy as another. Alf described how he had caught the
  traducer by the throat and shaken him sick. His wife did not believe him but
  was appeased. She looked at the watch again.</p>

  <p>"He was in the bar when you went in?" she asked. "Now you go up to bed and
  keep your big mouth shut, or I'll take the rollin' pin to you like I did last
  Good Friday!"</p>

  <p>Alf meekly obeyed.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube decided to make a call on Educated Evans next day, and she did
  so at a moment when the World's Champion Prophet and Turf Adviser was engaged
  in the case of Henrietta Bowsome.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans had never heard of Henrietta Bowsome, and might never have
  heard of her, for he seldom read anything else in a newspaper than the
  columns in which racing correspondents explain why their selections did not
  win the day before; but it happened that he was in attendance at the police
  court, a client of his having fallen into grievous error.</p>

  <p>Educated Evans, because of his erudition and his well-known gifts in the
  matter of terminology, had prepared the defence which was read from the dock
  and instantly recognised.</p>

  <p>"I think," said The Miller <i>sotto voce</i> to his protegé as they walked
  out into the lobby, " that if it hadn't been for that defence of yours, young
  Herbert would have got off. As it is, he's going to do three months. Why
  don't you change your style?"</p>

  <p>Evans raised his eyebrows and said nothing. It was useless to argue with
  Sergeant Challoner in his more aggravating moods.</p>

  <p>"Is Henrietta a client of yours, by the way?" asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"Henrietta? I don't know the gentleman."</p>

  <p>"It's a lady, to be exact," said The Miller, and described Henrietta's
  weakness. She was a " shopper." It was her custom to walk into one of those
  crowded departmental stores which ornament Oxford Street, carrying on her
  hands a large muff. A pillow muff is a very convenient appendage to a lady
  with a weakness for acquiring property in the Homeric manner, for what
  Henrietta</p>

  <p class="verse">...thought she might require<br>
  She went and took.</p><br>

  <p>Interested, Mr. Evans strolled back to the court, in time to see a very
  pretty, well-dressed girl step blithely into the dock, nod smilingly to the
  unresponsive magistrate, and glance round the court with the air of one who
  was visiting her old home and was gratified to discover that nothing had been
  changed. And at the end of the evidence....</p>

  <p>"Really, Henrietta, I don't know what to do with you," said the
  magistrate, leaning back in his chair and taking off his pince-nez. "You are
  incorrigible!"</p>

  <p>"It is very difficult for me to find work with my record," said Henrietta.
  She had a soft, cooing, almost pathetic voice.</p>

  <p>The magistrate shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The missionary can do nothing with you. This thieving&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Kleptomania,</i>" murmured Henrietta. "It runs in the family. My
  father was a tax-collector."</p>

  <p>The magistrate gazed sternly round the court.</p>

  <p>"I will not have any laughing in this court," he said. "This is a very
  serious matter, and unless you can find somebody who is willing to employ you
  and be guarantee for your good behaviour, I shall send you to prison with
  hard labour."</p>

  <p>He waited expectantly.</p>

  <p>"I will," said Evans huskily.</p>

  <p>He had had no more intention of intervening in this case than he had of
  kissing a policeman.</p>

  <p>The magistrate put on his glasses again, the better to observe the
  philanthropist.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're Evans, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lord," said the educated man.</p>

  <p>"Is he a householder "</p>

  <p>The Miller came to the rescue here, inwardly cursing his friend, and
  explained that Evans certainly was on the voters' list.</p>

  <p>"But what on earth can you do with this girl? Are you an employer of
  labour?"</p>

  <p>Evans nodded dumbly. In justice to him, although he was acting on impulse,
  he was prompted by the subconscious knowledge that he needed assistance in
  the great and beneficent work of conveying to the sporting public information
  which even owners and trainers did not possess. For Evans had had the good
  fortune to tip a 20/1 winner at Sandown Park. On this particular day it was
  difficult, if one tipped a winner at all, not to tip one at a long price, for
  it was that Black Thursday when hundreds of punters, great and small, spent
  their evenings filling up petitions in bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>The magistrate heaved a deep, dissatisfied sigh.</p>

  <p>"All right; she'll be bound over in the sum of twenty pounds on your
  recognisances, Mr. Evans." And his tone suggested that he would have added:
  "And I wish you joy of your bargain," but he was a kind-hearted man and did
  not wish to depress unduly one who had undertaken a task of such
  magnitude.</p>

  <p>"You've done it, my lad," said The Miller under his breath. "This is going
  to cost you twenty of the best and brightest. She'll be up again before the
  old man within a week."</p>

  <p>Evans was too interested in his new responsibility to heed the
  warning.</p>

  <p>She was a pretty girl, this Henrietta, in a pinkish way, with a trick of
  showing her white teeth, for she was easily amused. For the moment she was a
  little scared too, for she had served one period as a guest of the
  proprietors of Holloway Castle, and had no desire to repeat her
  experience.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what makes me do it, Mr. Evans," she said, as they walked
  towards Bayham Mews together. " But somehow, when I see loose property laying
  around, I've got to hook it or die."</p>

  <p>"You listen to me, Henrietta," said Evans soberly, and in the manner of a
  father, "and you'll not go far wrong. Come to me for advice. If you find the
  temptation a-overcomin' you, out of business hours, just pop round and see
  me."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"But I shan't have to pop round, shall I?" she asked. "Aren't you going to
  give me some work?"</p>

  <p>"There's plenty of work," said Evans enthusiastically, "and what's more,
  you'll be well paid for it. Can you typewrite?"</p>

  <p>She said she thought she could.</p>

  <p>"It would teach me to spell," she said. Later he discovered how bad a
  speller she was.</p>

  <p>"You stick to me, Henrietta," he said, in his best parental manner; "
  never say a word of what goes on inside my office, be my watch dog, and
  you'll Make Money. I'll show you the office."</p>

  <p>The office had an occupant. Mrs. Lube, in her best clothes and wearing all
  the family jewels, was sitting in the one chair, fanning herself with the
  afternoon paper. Her manner was gracious; she even smiled, though the smile
  vanished and a look of surprise and understanding came into her bulgous eyes
  when the girl followed Evans into the room.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Mr. Evans," she said sweetly.</p>

  <p>Evans left the door wide open and stood at a respectful distance.</p>

  <p>"My dear grandfather sent me round to ask if you'd be good enough to tell
  him what you're sending out for the Chester Cup," she said, almost
  apologetically. "He says he wouldn't like to send the same horse because
  people might talk."</p>

  <p>Evans was thunderstruck. This advance from the enemy's camp was amazing.
  He could hardly believe his ears.</p>

  <p>"Eh . . well, Mrs. Lube... to tell you the truth, I was thinkin' of
  sendin' Laberens, belonging to the well-known Rajah of Ranji, the celebrated
  cricket-ball thrower."</p>

  <p>Again Mrs. Lube smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's so good of you, Mr. Evans," she said, as she rose to go. "Perhaps
  you'll slip round an' have a sociable drink one day?"</p>

  <p>She was gone before he recovered from the shock.</p>

  <p>"Me have a drink with her!" he said at last. "Would I take a sitlitz
  powder from the hands of the celebrated Lewd-creature Burgia, the female
  Crippen of Rome, Italy?"</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" asked Miss Bowsome curiously.</p>

  <p>"She's Nothing," said Evans, and changed the subject. "This is my little
  den," he explained. " I've thought out some of the best winners here that any
  man's ever found. In that there corner by the fireplace I got the idea for
  Braxted&mdash;20/1, what a beauty!&mdash;on that table I writ or wrote
  'Taping&mdash;Fear Nothing!' I lay on that bed an' thought out Paddy
  &mdash;20/1, what a beauty...!"</p>

  <p>Henrietta looked round the historic apartment without any visible signs of
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>Where's the other room?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"What other room?" demanded Evans.</p>

  <p>"Where do I sleep?" she demanded, her innocent eye on his.</p>

  <p>Evans stared at her.</p>

  <p>"Ain't you got a home?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I haven't got a home," she replied scornfully. What's more, I
  can't get lodgings. I've got such a bad name that nobody will trust me in
  Camden Town."</p>

  <p>The colour left the cheeks of the World's Greatest Tipster.</p>

  <p>"You can't stay here," he squeaked.</p>

  <p>"This is my room!"</p>

  <p>She sat down in the one chair and folded her arms.</p>

  <p>"I've got to stay here," she said steadily. "You're in charge of me: the
  magistrate said so. Besides, how can I keep honest if I'm away from you? The
  moment I get out of your sight I shall be pinching something; I can't help
  it, Mr. Evans!"</p>

  <p>Educated Evans took half a cigar from the mantelshelf with a hand that
  shook, and lit it unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"This is a nice thing!" he said, in a tone which meant that it was
  anything but that." I've got myself into a nice kind of trouble through
  helping young women, I must say!"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you got any place where you can sleep? she asked innocently.
  "Couldn't you take lodgings?"</p>

  <p>Evans grew testy.</p>

  <p>"I can't have you sleeping here, getting me a bad name," he said, with
  vigour and vehemence. "It's ridiculous an' absurd. Why, I'll have people
  pointing the finger of scorn at me, as though I was one of them celebrated
  pashers of Hindustan."</p>

  <p>Her eyes lit up.</p>

  <p>"With divans and things," she breathed, "and beautiful Indian curtains and
  wonderful Persian rugs on the floor! Like the pictures!"</p>

  <p>Evans staggered.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a pasher, and I never will be a pasher," he said sternly.
  "Nobody's ever breathed the breath of scandal against me. I'm like Caesar's
  celebrated friend, Cleopatra, whose well-known needle we all admire&mdash;see
  Shakespeare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't you sleep out somewhere?" she interrupted his discourse to ask.
  "It's so easy for you, Mr. Evans."</p>

  <p>Her voice had in it that note of pathos which so thrilled him.</p>

  <p>"I'm a poor girl&mdash;lonely and friendless, with everybody's hand
  against me, Mr. Evans. I'm not educated like you are, Mr. Evans. I know I
  shan't be reformed&mdash;I've tried to be. But give me a chance, Mr. Evans.
  If I could only raise enough money to get to Canada, I might marry a farmer
  and live in the country where there's nothing to pinch but corn."</p>

  <p>The upshot of it was that Evans took a room with his friend, the
  motor-lorry man. It was not an arrangement exactly pleasing to him, as he
  told The Miller that night when they met in the High Street outside the
  cinema.</p>

  <p>"You're a fool," said The Miller. "And what's more, you're going to get a
  bad name. That girl can't help stealing. Her parents were that way. She can
  hardly write her own name and her general education is nil!"</p>

  <p>"She's fond of poetry&mdash;she told me so," said Henrietta's defender
  stoutly.</p>

  <p>"Pah!" snarled The Miller. "Poetry!"</p>

  <p>Early the next morning, as he was strolling to the station, he was
  intercepted by Mrs. Lube, who had heard, it seems, the plaintive outcry of
  the landlady of the "Three Dogs " and had certain information to impart...
  .</p>

  <p>At that moment, when The Miller and the voluble Mrs. Lube sat in the
  inspector's room, Evans entered Bayham Mews, determined to regularise an
  intolerable situation. The lorry-driver's bed was hard. Mr. Evans could not
  bring his mind to the contemplation of the thoroughbred race-horse in an
  alien atmosphere. Henrietta must find lodgings. He had practically arranged
  this.</p>

  <p>But when he got to his "office" the girl was not there. The bed was neatly
  made; the floor was brushed; the hearth tidied; but Henrietta had
  vanished.</p>

  <p>On the table was a note.</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR MR. EVINS.&mdash;Fairwell, Try to fogit me.<br>
  The ruleing pasions very strong<br>
  If you carnt go write you must go rong.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours truely</p>

  <p class="letter">HENRIETTA.</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;Excuse speling the potry was on a sell door at
  Holleway.</p><br>

  <p>Evans breathed a sigh of relief. For the moment he thought nothing of the
  possible estreatment of his recognisances.</p>

  <p>He had taken up his pen to indite a frenzied appeal to the speculative
  classes, when he heard men coming up the stairs. The Miller came in first,
  and behind him was a man whom Evans recognised as a detective- constable.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to disturb you, Evans," said The Miller. "You were in the 'Three
  Dogs' the other night?"</p>

  <p>Evans was shaking.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Challoner," he said.</p>

  <p>"Whilst you were there, Mrs. Fich lost a wrist-watch the value of which is
  over £150. It was stolen from a shelf behind the bar. There is information
  that you left the bar hurriedly, and I have a warrant to search your
  room."</p>

  <p>Educated Evans said not a word, but stood like a man in a dream, watching
  the systematic combing of his room.</p>

  <p>"Nothing here," said The Miller; "not that I expected to find
  anything."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and, as he did so, asked carelessly:</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Lube been in your room lately?"</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," said Evans. "I found her here when I got back from the
  court."</p>

  <p>The Miller smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"Where is Henrietta?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Gorn," said Evans, and showed him the letter.</p>

  <p>The Miller read it carefully.</p>

  <p>You found a winner when you took that girl," he said.</p>

  <p>When he left Zionist House, he went straight back to Mrs. Lube's home.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the information, Mrs. Lube," he said dryly; "and I'll tell
  you straight away that when your husband says that he saw Evans reaching with
  a stick, I don't believe him."</p>

  <p>"Did you find the watch, Mr. Challoner?" she asked anxiously. "An' did you
  pinch the thievin' hound?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't find the watch," said The Miller carefully, "and Evans didn't
  find it."</p>

  <p>"Did you look under the mattress?" asked the agitated woman. "That's where
  thieves hide property."</p>

  <p>"And that's where they find it too," said The Miller cryptically.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="story11"
     name="story11"></a>XII. &mdash; THE JOURNALIST</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. FRITHINGTON-EVANS had a colt, Sunsweet, by Sunstar out
  of Toffee. It was trained by an old stud groom who knew more about horses
  than most trainers.</p>

  <p>From time to time Mr. Frithington-Evans sent a good handicapper to
  Shropshire to try this wonderful two-year-old, and every trial aroused joy in
  the shrivelled soul of this rich young man, who was a sportsman by profession
  and a gentleman by custom.</p>

  <p>It was arranged that the horse should be brought to Alexandra Park, where
  the opposition was unimportant, and by skilful organisation, Mr. Evans
  secured 1752 bookmakers' accounts. Some were in his own name, some in
  fictitious names. In defiance of the laws of racing he advertised through a
  trusty agent and in this way obtained accounts to reach the total given. On
  the day of the race the wires would be sent from a hundred sub-post offices
  in London, each batch being preceded by long-winded telegrams addressed to
  himself, the idea being to delay the despatch of the wires. It was what Mr.
  Evans called a "coop." Unfortunately...</p>

  <p>Mr. Frithington-Evans was by nature and inclination a twister. He twisted
  Lord Bascom (Viscount Bascom of Bascom) to the extent of fifteen hundred
  pounds. Not that Frithy needed the money. He had so much that he was ill with
  it, but it was his nature to twist.</p>

  <p>Lord Bascom was very annoyed, and with good reason, when, at their club,
  Frithy coolly denied that he had ever promised to put a monkey on Longlegs
  for his friend the first time he was trying.</p>

  <p>"Imagination, dear old thing," he said coolly. "You're dreaming!"</p>

  <p>Now, although Lord Bascom was an extremely wealthy man (he was chairman of
  fourteen colliery companies) he was also an extremely mean man. And he hated
  losing fifteen hundred pounds.</p>

  <p>"You're a dirty skunk," he roared, and one of these days I'm going to get
  even with you!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Frithington-Evans grinned, and that grin cost him a lot of money.</p>

  <p>"You blabbed Longlegs all over the place&mdash;and I only got three to one
  to my money," he said.</p>

  <p>His lordship did not call him a simple liar. He added something.</p>

  <p>"Didn't you kidnap a dirty tipster, and didn't he manage to get the news
  out of the house that Longlegs was a certainty? Why the man didn't bring an
  action against you for illegal imprisonment, I don't know. You've caught me,
  Frithy, and I shall catch you or my name's not Bascom!"</p>

  <p>Good luck!" said Frithy cheerfully, having no fears.</p>

  <p>Lord Bascom went back to his office, red in the neck and breathing
  vengeance stertorously. It had been on the tip of his tongue to talk about a
  certain horse called Sunsweet&mdash;for his lordship lived in Shropshire,
  near the secret training quarters, and the best of servants talk. And then by
  chance there fell into his hands a copy of an unique publication. . . .</p>

  <p>There was no greater admirer, nor more consistent supporter, of Educated
  Evans, than Mr. Bert Sybil, the printer. He did everything for Evans except
  lend him money; and in justice to our friend, such a request never came from
  the World's Champion Prophet and Turf Adviser. He had even expressed a.
  willingness to print Mr. Evans' tips at cost price, but, as Educated Evans
  pointed out to him, the inspiration for his selections came so late in the
  day that it would be a waste of money to put them into cold type.</p>

  <p>Evans was working late one night, revising his tattered list of clients,
  when Mr. Sybil called upon him, and the visit was a little surprising,
  because Evans believed that Mr. Sybil was a wealthy man who could well afford
  the services of a professional mouthpiece. As it happened, he did not come in
  search of advocacy.</p>

  <p>"Heard about my trouble, Evans?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr. Sybil. Sit down, won't you?"</p>

  <p>Evans himself sat on the table, placing the only chair in the room at the
  disposal of his visitor. Mr. Sybil sighed.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm for it this time," he said. "Trade's bad, or I wouldn't
  have taken on the job. You're a man of the world and you understand
  that."</p>

  <p>Evans understood and sympathised. For the third time in three years Mr.
  Sybil had been summoned by the police for printing the tickets of an illicit
  sweepstake. He had been fined large sums, and had had ominous warnings.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid they're going to put me away this time, Evans," said Mr.
  Sybil, gazing reflectively at his cigar. "I've been in before, but nobody
  knows that but you and me. I tried to straighten The Miller, but he wouldn't
  be squared. Now the point is, what's going to happen to the business when I'm
  away? I've got a sort of manager, but I don't trust him any farther than I
  can chuck him. I'm not married, I've got no relations, and there's nobody in
  Camden Town that I can put in charge. Do you know anything about
  printing?"</p>

  <p>Evans' first inclination was to give a history of the printing art from
  its inception by the celebrated Klaxon in 1066, but on reflection he decided
  to deny all knowledge of the trade.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sybil smoked thoughtfully for a long time without speaking.</p>

  <p>"You know enough about it to pay the wages bill, I suppose? I've got a
  dozen contracts that'll keep the works going till I come out. What I want is
  somebody to keep an eye on it as if it was his own. I don't mind paying two
  or three pounds a week," he added suggestively.</p>

  <p>Although Educated Evans knew nothing about printing, he knew a great deal
  about two or three pounds a week, and after two hours spent in instructions
  and warnings, the arrangements were made, and Mr. Sybil's foresight was
  justified when, on the following morning, he was sent to two months' in the
  second division.</p>

  <p>"It's a bit hard on me," complained Evans to his chief confidant. "What
  with the rush of business and the lies that Old Sam and his grand-daughter's
  tellin' about me, an' Ascot comin' on, I haven't got any time to mess about
  with printing businesses. I've got all my work cut out gettin' lists."</p>

  <p>Addresses are the life-blood of the tipster. There are many eminent firms
  of publishers which issue classified dictionaries of various trades. You may
  discover at a glance all the ironmongers and most of the linen- drapers who
  do business in England. You may, by the turning of a page, have revealed to
  your eyes the directors of public companies. But up to date, nobody has
  published a volume indispensable to every turf prophet&mdash;a Dictionary of
  Mugs.</p>

  <p>There goes on a trade in addresses which is a lucrative one. One tipster,
  having exhausted his credit and the patience of his clients, will sell his
  list to another of his profession, who, employing a new method of approach
  and a new appeal to the credulity of his clients, may revive in their bosoms
  the hope and faith which are so essential to the well-being of the turf
  prophet.</p>

  <p>"If I can only get a list or two, Mr. Challoner, I'll be playing banker at
  the well-known Monte Carlo."</p>

  <p>Now The Miller, like most officers of the Criminal Investigation
  Department, had an extensive knowledge of the queer trades of London; and the
  list-touter was a familiar object on his mental landscape. And he knew that
  these evil men sometimes produced lists which had been assiduously copied
  from reputable directories, and were of no more value to a hard-working turf
  prophet than a copy of the War <i>Cry</i> would be to a system worker.</p>

  <p>"Who is offering you a list?" he asked, and, after a second's
  hesitation&mdash;for Evans had a natural objection to supplying information
  to the police:</p>

  <p>"Joe Liski," he said, and The Miller smiled.</p>

  <p>"Joe couldn't fall straight if he fell out of a balloon," he said
  picturesquely. "Take my advice, Evans: let. Mrs. Lube buy all the lists she
  wants, and you stick to your own. Why don't you advertise "</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"As the celebrated Queen Elizabeth said to Cardinal Rishloo, when he asked
  her why she didn't get married: 'Ask me another.' Them newspapers are too
  particular, and they're very expensive, Mr. Challoner, and they want to know
  all your private affairs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Such as whether the winner you say you sent out, you actually did send?"
  suggested The Miller, and, as Evans evaded the question, he was probably
  right. "Why not start a newspaper of your own? You've got the business."</p>

  <p>The idea only then dawned upon Educated Evans.</p>

  <p>"A paper?" he said thoughtfully. "Bless my soul! Evans' Weekly, or the
  Educated Magazine!"</p>

  <p>As soon as he could, with politeness, shake himself clear of the Miller's
  company, he hurried to the little side street where Sybil's Electric Printing
  Works were situated. The foreman and manager, a thin, shifty man, was
  surprisingly helpful.</p>

  <p>"You could do it for about seven pound a week," he said, after making
  rough calculations on the back of a bazaar bill. "You want a fellow on a
  bicycle to take the papers round to the shops&mdash;what are you going to
  charge for it?"</p>

  <p>"Half a crown?" suggested Evans.</p>

  <p>The printer took a pinch of snuff&mdash;printers who do not take snuff
  have no right to the title.</p>

  <p>"What about tuppence?" he said brutally, and added: "I don't mind doing
  this job: it'll liven things up a bit. It hasn't been the same place since
  the governor's been away. We never had a week pass that the police didn't
  come in, and that prevented you feeling dull."</p>

  <p>The scheme now took definite shape, and Evans applied himself to his new
  avocation with tremendous intensity.</p>

  <p>The magic of printer's ink was in his blood. For three days he neglected
  all business, whilst he moved deliriously through the grime and ruin of a
  jobbing printer's office. For there is this about all such places: that they
  have the appearance of having survived a bad earthquake which was accompanied
  by a phenomenal shower of soot.</p>

  <p>The news came to the Old Sam faction in the nature of a shock.</p>

  <p>" 'Im with a paper!" said Mrs. Lube, aghast at the suggestion. "I'll
  believe it when I see it."</p>

  <p>She saw it soon enough. The first number of " Evans' Imperial Racing Guide
  and Backer's Friend "appeared on the Tuesday. It consisted of four very small
  pages, but there was meat and drink in every line. One column was
  headed:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">WHAT I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES.</p>

  <p class="newspaper"
     style="text-align:center"><i>By Educated Evans, the World's Premier
     Prophet and Turf Adviser.</i></p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">Down at Kempton the other day I had a good look at Fluky
  Jane. She wasn't trying a yard. Where were the stewards?</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="newspaper">How long will it be before Mr. Frithington-Evans, the
  celebrated owner of Longlegs, is warned off? This man is a curse to the turf,
  besides being a low-spirited hound.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="newspaper">I understand that a great coop is intended with Mugman.
  This horse won at Hurst Park when I tipped it. What a beauty! What a beauty!
  But his trainer ought to be warned off for the way he ran at Sandown.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="newspaper">Mr. Challoner, the celebrated detective officer, who is
  highly respected by Camden Town, as all the world knows, has his eye upon a
  certain beer-eater who calls himself a turf prophet. If this man had his
  rights he would be doing time.</p><br>

  <p>Styme, the foreman, read these notes with great relish.</p>

  <p>They're a bit personal, ain't they, Mr. Evans?</p>

  <p>"They've got to be," said Evans, who had sat up all night in the printing
  office in order to get the first copy of the paper. "I'm goin' to clean the
  turf. Many a horse sent out by me has had his head pulled off as soon as it
  was known that Educated Evans had give 'im!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Styme scratched his chin thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, the old man's inside and he can't see it," he said with
  satisfaction. "But didn't there ought to be some tips in the paper?"</p>

  <p>Evans gasped. He had forgotten the tips!</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lube read the paper from title to imprint. It was not the reference
  to her sacred grandparent that really annoyed her, so much as certain
  paragraphs marked.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">PERSONAL CHIT-CHAT AND CAMDEN TOWN GOSSIP.</p>

  <p align="center"> </p>

  <p class="newspaper"
     style="text-align:center"><i>(By Educated Evans, the World's Champion
     Prophet and Turf Adviser.)</i></p>

  <p class="newspaper">The goings on of the lower classes is getting worse and
  worse. The Greek Bachelor having been kicked out of its lodgings, still meets
  the fair English lady at the cinema, as I have seen with my own
  eyes....</p><br>

  <p>Mrs. Lube choked, went purple, crushed the paper in her hand and flung it
  into the grate; thought better of it and smoothed it out, and, grabbing her
  hat, pulled it viciously over her head. She dashed into the kitchen, selected
  a small but heavy rolling-pin, put in the market bag and went out in search
  of Evans.</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans saw her coming; barricaded the door, and conducted his
  negotiations through the window, keeping well out of sight and out of
  reach.</p>

  <p>You dirty, slanderous, perjurous 'ound!" screamed the enraged female.
  "Open that door to me and I'll..." She enumerated the various portions of
  his anatomy on which, given the opportunity, she would experiment.</p>

  <p>"Go away before I send for the police," shouted Evans.</p>

  <p>"I'll 'police' you, you perjurous..."</p>

  <p>She had a large supply of adjectives, and Evans, listening, realised that
  journalism had its drawbacks and its dangers. Happily for him, "Evans'
  Imperial Racing Guide and Backer's Friend" enjoyed a strictly local
  circulation, and other gentlemen who might have had just cause for resentment
  at his exposure of their weaknesses were blissfully ignorant of the charges
  brought against them.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Evans got home that night he found a man sitting on the bottom
  step of the wooden stairs which led to his room. At first anticipating
  violence, he put himself in an attitude of defence.</p>

  <p>That you, Evans? growled a voice. "What the devil do you mean by keeping
  me waiting here? I told you I should come at ten o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Me, sir?" said Evans. "Nobody told me nothin'. Come upstairs."</p>

  <p>He recognised, by the acerbity and haughtiness of his caller, that he had
  a gentleman to deal with. The mystery was explained partially when he found a
  letter which had evidently been pushed under his door. The visitor also found
  an explanation, for he snatched the letter from Evans's hand.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you, and I can only spare five minutes. Are you the
  owner of this rubbish?"</p>

  <p>He produced a carefully folded copy of Evans' Imperial Racing Guide and
  Backers' Friend.</p>

  <p>"I'm the owner and I'm not the owner," said Evans, temporising. "All the
  nasty things in that paper was written by a friend of mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Never mind who wrote it. A lot of it's true. You know Frithington-Evans,
  don't you? Of course, you're the fellow that he locked up in his room? Why
  the devil didn't you sue him?"</p>

  <p>"Could I?" said Evans, with a new interest in life.</p>

  <p>"Of course you could, you fool!" said his lordship. "You could have got a
  couple of thousand pounds out of the little beast! Now I want you to do
  something for me. When does your paper come out?"</p>

  <p>"Any day," said Evans, recklessly disregarding the regular habits of
  well-conducted weekly newspapers.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you something. I'm going to spoil Frithy's little joke. He's no
  relation of yours?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank Gawd!" said Evans, and his pious denial aroused the first sign
  of pleasure that the visitor had displayed.</p>

  <p>"Well, now, listen. Get out a new paper, and put in a paragraph something
  like this: 'Sunsweet will win at Alexandra Park.' Send it out to all your
  friends&mdash;the more the better&mdash;and there you are. Now how much will
  it cost?" He took out a pocket-book.</p>

  <p>Evans wasn't quite certain whether to say £2 or £5.</p>

  <p>"Will a hundred do?"</p>

  <p>Evans, speechless, nodded.</p>

  <p>"Now how many people can you send this out to?"</p>

  <p>Evans thought.</p>

  <p>"About two thousand," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said his lordship. And then an idea struck him. "Come to my
  office in the morning, or rather, to the office of a friend of mine, and I
  will give you a list of people to whom you can send this paper. But mind you,
  you've got to keep in the paragraph about that scoundrel being warned off! If
  you can think of anything worse to say, don't hesitate to say it. Here is the
  address: if I'm not there&mdash;of course I shan't be there," he added
  hastily, " because it's not my office&mdash;ask for the secretary."</p>

  <p>He wrote down the address on the blotting-pad and left without further
  ceremony. All that evening he sat up, till two o'clock in the morning,
  compiling a list of people to whom the reference to Mr. Frithington- Evans,
  and particularly the reference to Sunsweet, would bring joy and profit. It
  was not a long list, about two hundred in all.</p>

  <p>At three o'clock the next afternoon, Mr. Evans, having made the necessary
  alterations in his paper, came into Basinghall Street, passed the imposing
  portal, and knocked at the door of the room to which he had been directed. A
  harassed secretary appeared.</p>

  <p>"Lists?" said the gentleman with a frown. "Oh, yes, you're the man Lord
  Bascom was expecting."</p>

  <p>He went to a telephone and Evans heard him.</p>

  <p>"Man come for the list... yes, my lord, Evans... on your desk? You don't
  mean... all right, my lord!" The latter rather hastily.</p>

  <p>Lord Bascom! Evans knew the name, and remembered dimly having had the
  nobleman pointed out to him on a racecourse. So he was under the
  distinguished patronage of Lord Bascom! He glowed.</p>

  <p>Presently the secretary returned with a large roll of paper.</p>

  <p>"Bring this list back when you've finished with it," he said.</p>

  <p>It was an enormous list: it contained nearly five thousand names, and
  Evans had to recruit all sorts of odd labour to prepare the wrappers. He
  spent the greater part of the night superintending the new edition. All
  unnecessary paragraphs, save that relating to Mr. Frithington- Evans, were
  deleted, and, in large letters:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Under the patronage of his Lordship, Lord Bascom, Educated
  Evans, the Wizard of Camden Town! The World's Premier Prophet and Turf
  Adviser! Braxted&mdash;what a beauty!</p>

  <p class="quote">His lordship has give me a tip which same will be sent for
  10/. T.M.O. addressed to H. Evans, Greek Bachelor House, Bayham Mews. This is
  a beauty! It can't be beat! Given to me by one of the world's grandest old
  sportsmen, God bless him!...</p><br>

  <p>Evans was too much of a professional to send out Sunsweet or any other
  sweet without making sure that he got something out of it.</p>

  <p>Lord Bascom had been called away into the country, so he never saw, until
  it was too late, the unauthorised use of his name. Had he known that the
  document supplied to the wretched tipster was a list of the shareholders of
  his company, he would have died on the spot.</p>

  <p>Old Sam and his coterie read the "come on " and wondered how long it would
  be before Evans was putting out his tin at Dartmoor.</p>

  <p>"It's forgery, that's what it is," said Alf. "It stands to reason that no
  gentleman's going to have anythin' to do with a tyke like that...."</p>

  <p>The Miller saw the paragraph and was really alarmed. He hastened round to
  Bayham Mews and found Mr. Evans entirely surrounded by telegraph envelopes,
  and huge stacks of money orders piled up on the table.</p>

  <p>"It's rolling in&mdash;Sunsweet, help yourself," said the exuberant
  tipster. "Twelve hundred an' forty-two pounds ten up to date, Miller!" He was
  hysterical with joy. "They're comin' in faster than I can open 'em!"</p>

  <p>"Did he give you this tip? asked The Miller.</p>

  <p>"He certainly did," said Evans, in his most rollicking manner. "That
  Sunsweet will win this afternoon by the length of a street. What a beauty,
  what a beauty!"</p>

  <p>It was only by accident that Mr. Frithington-Evans learned of the tragedy,
  and immediately burnt the telegrams he was sending and sent away his
  messengers. Blue and red with rage, he stamped up and down his expensive
  drawing-room, and visited on the head of his groom-trainer the piled- up
  wrath which properly belonged to Educated Evans.</p>

  <p>"We'll run the damn thing and run it down the course," he said. "Where's
  the horse?"</p>

  <p>"On the course, sir," said the shivering groom, " in charge of Mr.
  Thomson, your trainer."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evans seized the telephone directory and searched. There was only one
  number for Alexandra Park, and this he called.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to Mr. Thomson, who is in charge of my horse," he said. "I
  am Mr. Frithington-Evans."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," said a voice.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed, and then somebody asked:</p>

  <p>"Is it about Sunsweet?</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is." Anger made Mr. Frithington-Evans incautious.</p>

  <p>" Now listen, Thomson: that horse is to run but it's not to win&mdash;do
  you understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment: I think you've made a mistake," said the voice at the
  other end of the line. " We couldn't find your trainer. It is the senior
  steward speaking."</p>

  <p>Frithy did not collapse.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;yes," he said, more mildly. "I &mdash;er&mdash;meant to say that
  my horse isn't running."</p>

  <p>"You horse <i>is</i> running, Mr. Frithington-Evans," said a very stern
  voice, "and if it can win, it will win, Mr. Frithington-Evans!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Frithy.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch: it was too late to rewrite his wires, and his
  messengers had departed.</p>

  <p>"What a beauty! What a beauty!" murmured Educated Evans.</p>

  <p>"Hold up," said The Miller, and pushed him against the wall. "Where's your
  key?"</p>

  <p>"What a beauty! What a beauty!" murmured Educated Evans, and began to
  sing.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with you, Evans," said The Miller, as he dragged him up the
  stairs and flung him on to his bed, " is that you can't carry corn. A little
  success drives you mad."</p>

  <p>"What a beauty! What a beauty!" murmured Evans, and, so murmuring, fell
  asleep.</p>
