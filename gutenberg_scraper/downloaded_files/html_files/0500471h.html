  <h3>PART I</h3>

  <p class="first">AS a collection of human oddments, the National Gallery on
  copying day surpasses even the Reading Room of the British Museum, and almost
  equals the House of Commons. The spectacle that it afforded was a source of
  perennial interest to Mr. Joseph Fittleworth, as were also the productions of
  the professional copyists, humorously described in official parlance as
  students. For Joseph Fittleworth was himself a painter, with a leaning to the
  methods of the past rather than to those of the future, a circumstance which
  accounted for his professional failure. Which illustrates the remarkable fact
  that in these days, when even indifferent Old Masters sell at famine prices,
  while the unsold work of contemporary genius grows mouldy in the studios, an
  artist's only chance of popularity is to diverge as far as possible from the
  methods of those great men of the past whose productions are in such
  demand.</p>

  <p>Hence it had happened that Fittleworth had accepted with avidity a not
  very lucrative supernumerary post at the National Gallery where he could, at
  least, have his being amidst the objects of his worship, which we may remark
  included an exceedingly comely young lady, who came regularly to the gallery
  to copy pictures, principally of the Flemish school.</p>

  <p>On this particular Thursday morning Mr. Fittleworth walked slowly through
  the rooms, stopping now and again to look at the work of the copyists, and
  dropping an occasional word of judicious and valued criticism. He had made a
  tour of the greater part of the building and was about to turn back, when he
  bethought him of a rather interesting copy that he had seen in progress in a
  small, isolated room at the end of the British Galleries, and turned his
  steps thither. The room was approached by a short corridor in which a man was
  seated copying in water-colour a small Constable, and copying it so execrably
  that Fittleworth instinctively looked the other way and passed hurriedly to
  the room beyond. The work in progress here interested him exceedingly. The
  original was a portrait of James the Second by Sir Godfrey Kneller, and the
  copy was so perfect a reproduction that Fittleworth halted by the easel lost
  in admiration of the technical skill displayed. The artist, whose name
  appeared from an inscription on his colour box to be Guildford Dudley, was
  seated, looking at his picture and the original, as he deliberately mixed a
  number of tints on his palette.</p>

  <p>"I see you haven't begun work yet," Fittleworth remarked.</p>

  <p>The painter looked up at him, owlishly through a pair of very large,
  double focus spectacles, and shook his head, which was adorned by a tangled
  mass of very long, reddish hair.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "I am just having a preliminary look before
  starting."</p>

  <p>"Do you think your copy wants anything done to it at all?" asked
  Fittleworth. "It's excellent as it stands, though just a trifle low in
  tone."</p>

  <p>"Not lower than the original, is it?" demanded the artist.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Fittleworth, "but it will be in a year or so, when the
  medium has darkened, and it's a good deal lower than the original was when
  first painted."</p>

  <p>The painter reflected. "I'm inclined to think you're right," said he. "I
  ought to have kept it one or two degrees higher. But it isn't too late," he
  added, briskly. "A day's work or so ought to bring it up to the proper
  key."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth was doubtful and rather sorry he had spoken. Raising the tone
  meant practically going over the entire picture afresh, which seemed a risky
  proceeding in the case of a finished, and highly successful, painting. He
  attempted gentle dissuasion, but, finding the painter resolved on the
  alteration, refrained from urging him further.</p>

  <p>"I see," said he, "that the glass is on the original. Wouldn't you like to
  have it taken off?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, thanks," was the reply. "There's no reflection in it from
  here."</p>

  <p>"The glass lets the tone down a little," Fittleworth began; but there he
  paused, with his mouth slightly open, and the painter started and fell into a
  rigid posture, with his palette-knife poised motionless in mid-air.
  Astonishment was writ large on the faces of both men as they listened. And
  not without cause; for, clear and distinct, came the notes of a hautboy,
  playing a lively melody, and most evidently from somewhere within the sacred
  precincts of the building. Fittleworth remained for some seconds rigid as a
  statue, with his mouth open and his eyes fixed on those of the painter; but
  suddenly he recovered himself, and, without a word, darted from the room.
  Passing the water-colourist, who was looking over his shoulder and grinning,
  he entered the larger gallery, to find the easels deserted and the students
  trooping out of the door; and, following them, soon found himself in a
  momentarily-augmenting crowd of copyists, all surging towards the source of
  the music and all on the broad grin.</p>

  <p>It was in the Venetian room that Fittleworth finally ran the musician to
  earth. There he found a dense crowd, collected round Titian's Bacchus and
  Ariadne, and at its centre, a tall, thin man of grotesque and whimsical
  aspect, who wore a steeple-crowned felt hat and a long cloak, apparently
  quite oblivious of his audience. At the moment of Fittleworth's arrival, he
  was giving a spirited and skilful rendering of the "Carnival de Venise" with
  somewhat florid variations, and meanwhile keeping a pensive eye fixed on the
  picture. Fittleworth, controlling his features as well as he could, pushed
  through the crowd and touched the stranger lightly on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," said he, "to interrupt your really admirable performance,
  but I'm afraid we can't allow it to continue here."</p>

  <p>The stranger rolled a solemn, and somewhat reproachful, eye towards the
  official, and pausing for a moment on a low note, sprang up an octave and
  opened a fresh suite of variations, of really surprising agility. Fittleworth
  smothered a grin and waited patiently until the bravura passage came to an
  end with a most astonishing flourish, when he once more entered his polite
  demurrer. The stranger removed the instrument from his mouth and, having
  waited for the applause to subside, turned gravely to Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"Do I understand," said he, "that you object to music in this
  establishment?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth replied in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>The stranger shook his head solemnly. "That," said he, "seems to be an
  extraordinarily mistaken view. Surely you do not dispute the essential
  kinship of the fine arts?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth smiled evasively, and the stranger continued, amidst a murmur
  of encouraging giggles from the students:</p>

  <p>"You will not deny, sir, that the different fine arts are but various
  modes of a general sense of beauty."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth was not denying anything; he only objected to the hautboy.</p>

  <p>"Then," the stranger persisted, unmoved, "you will admit that each of the
  modes of beauty is reinforced by exposition and illustration through the
  other modes. For my part," he added finally, "I regard appropriate and
  sympathetic music as indispensable to the due appreciation of pictorial
  beauty," and with this, he turned away and moved off through the gallery
  followed, like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, by an attendant multitude.</p>

  <p>Fittleworth was in somewhat of a dilemma. There was no explicit rule
  against the playing of musical instruments in the galleries and the act was
  not in itself unlawful; moreover, the stranger's plea, though fantastic and
  absurd, was advanced so suavely and plausibly that it was difficult to deal
  with. He was still smilingly considering what it were best to do, when the
  stranger halted before Claude's "Embarkation of St. Ursula" and forthwith
  began a plaintive rendering of "Partant pour la Syrie." For awhile the humour
  of the situation was too much for Fittleworth, and the performance was nearly
  at an end before he had recovered himself sufficiently to renew his protests;
  but as the stranger moved away, he once more addressed him with polite, but
  urgent, remonstrance. The musician regarded him with reproachful surprise and
  again urged him to consider the intimate relation between the different modes
  of beauty, instancing the performances of Miss Maud Allen as a familiar and
  popular example; and even while Fittleworth was racking his brain for a
  suitable rejoinder, the stranger drew up abruptly before David's portrait of
  Elisa Bonaparte, and fixing a fiery eye upon the picture, burst into the
  "Marseillaise."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth felt himself becoming hysterical as the students cheered and
  the stirring phrases of the warlike melody rang through the building. It was
  useless to protest. The stranger only frowned, and rolled a compelling eye
  that demanded silence. Bewildered attendants watched the performance from
  afar with horrified stares and the crowd grew from moment to moment. After a
  brief appreciation of Fragonard's "Happy Mother" (to the air of "La Vierge a
  la Creche"), he moved on into the Dutch Gallery, and pausing before a picture
  of Van Ostade's, struck up with surprising spirit and verve "The Dutchman's
  Little Wee Dog"; which brought down the house and, incidentally, put a term
  to the performance. For at this point, to Fittleworth's great relief, an
  irritable old lady, who was copying a Rembrandt, came forward and demanded
  how she could "be expected to work in this disgusting hubbub." Fittleworth
  took the opportunity to point out to the musician that the galleries were at
  present filled with workers to whom his admirable performance, though
  delightful on a more seasonable occasion, was, just now, a distraction and a
  hindrance.</p>

  <p>The stranger turned, and raised his steeple-crowned hat. "That," said he,
  with a low bow to the old lady, "is an entirely different matter. If my
  presence is a source of disturbance, there is nothing for it but for me to
  wish you a very good morning."</p>

  <p>With this and another low bow, and an elaborate flourish of his hat, he
  turned, and adjusting the mouth piece of his instrument, walked away briskly
  towards the entrance hall, playing "The Girl I left behind me."</p>

  <p>It was some considerable time before the galleries settled down again. The
  students, gathered into groups, eagerly discussed the fantastic stranger, and
  Fittleworth, passing from one group to another, was assailed by innumerable
  questions. It was getting on for lunch time when he found himself once more
  in the neighbourhood of the isolated room where the portrait was in progress,
  and he noticed, as he passed through the corridor, that the water-colourist
  had already left. He found Mr. Dudley staring discontentedly through his
  great spectacles at the picture on his easel, and a single glance showed him
  that there was abundant cause for discontent.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it?" the painter asked, looking up doubtfully.</p>

  <p>Fittleworth pursed up his lips. "I'm afraid," said he, "you haven't
  improved it. The tone is certainly higher but the likeness has suffered, and
  the whole thing looks coarse and patchy."</p>

  <p>Dudley gazed gloomily at the canvas and nodded. "I'm afraid you're right,"
  said he. "I've mucked it up. That's the plain truth."</p>

  <p>"You certainly haven't improved it," agreed Fittleworth, "and, if I might
  venture to advise, I would recommend you to clean off this morning's work and
  consider the picture finished."</p>

  <p>The painter stood up and surveyed his work savagely. "You're perfectly
  right," said he, "and I'll follow your advice." He closed his folding-palette
  and began rapidly to pack up his materials, while Fittleworth stood, gazing
  regretfully at the spoiled painting. When he had packed his box and
  brush-case, Dudley proceeded to secure the canvas, which was very neatly
  arranged for safe transport, being fixed by catches to the bottom of a
  shallow box, the sliding lid of which served to protect the wet surface.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to take it away with you?" Fittleworth asked, as the
  painter slid the lid into its groove and fixed on the carrying straps.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Dudley, "I will take it home and then I shan't be tempted
  to tinker at it again when I've cleaned this mess off."</p>

  <p>Having closed and packed his easel, he picked up his heavy colour-box, his
  brush case and a leather bag, and Fittleworth, seeing him thus encumbered,
  politely offered to carry the box which contained the painting; and so they
  walked together to the entrance-hall, where Fittleworth delivered up the
  shallow box to its owner, wishing him luck in his efforts to obliterate the
  traces of the unfortunate morning's work.</p>

  <p>About eleven o'clock on the following forenoon, Fittleworth halted by the
  easel appertaining to Miss Katharine Hyde for a few minutes' confidential
  chat. He did not often allow himself this luxury, for the two young people
  had agreed that their relations inside the building had better be kept on a
  business footing. But every rule has its exceptions, and besides, as
  Katharine had not been present on the previous morning, she had to be told
  about the musical stranger. Fittleworth was in the midst of a spirited
  narration of the incident, when one of the attendants approached with a
  mysterious air.</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir," said he, "but there's a Mr. Dudley has come to work at
  his picture and we can't find it."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth frowned. "Dudley, Dudley," he muttered, "isn't that the--yes,
  of course." And, as a red-haired person with large spectacles advanced in the
  wake of the attendant, he said, "Have you been asking for your picture, Mr.
  Dudley?" The artist replied that he had. "But, my dear sir," laughed
  Fittleworth, "you took it away with you yesterday morning."</p>

  <p>The painter gazed at him with owlish surprise. "I wasn't here yesterday
  morning," said he.</p>

  <p>Fittleworth stared at him, in silent astonishment, for a few moments. Then
  he exclaimed impatiently:</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense, Mr. Dudley. You can't have forgotten. You were working at
  the picture all the morning, and I helped you myself to carry it to the
  entrance hall."</p>

  <p>The painter shook his head. "I was working the whole of yesterday in the
  National Portrait Gallery. You must have helped some one else out with my
  picture."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth started, and was sensible of a chill of vague alarm. The
  painter's appearance was so remarkable that a mistake seemed impossible. And
  yet he began to have an uneasy feeling that this was not the same man. There
  was the same long, red hair and the same enormous spectacles, but the face
  was not quite that of the man whom he had talked to yesterday, and the voice
  and manner seemed appreciably different. And again, a vague and chilly terror
  clutched at his heart.</p>

  <p>"Shall we go and look at the attendance book?" said he; and as the painter
  agreed with alacrity, they hurried away.</p>

  <p>"Your name is Guildford Dudley, I think," said Fittleworth, with his
  finger on the page that recorded yesterday's attendances.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Dudley, "but that's not my handwriting."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth reflected for a moment in a state bordering on panic.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," said he, "there's something wrong; but we'd better run round
  to the Portrait Gallery and verify your statement."</p>

  <p>They hurried out together, and turning round into St. Martin's Place,
  entered the Portrait Gallery, where a very brief investigation proved that
  Mr. Dudley had been engaged the whole of the previous day.</p>

  <p>Fittleworth broke out into a cold sweat. It was evident that a fraud had
  been committed; and a most elaborate fraud for, among other matters, an
  attendance card must have been counterfeited. But what could be the object of
  that fraud? A copy, no matter how good, seemed hardly worth such deliberate
  and carefully-considered plans. Fittleworth and the painter looked at one
  another, and with the same horrible suspicion in both their minds they
  hurried away together to put it to the test.</p>

  <p>As Fittleworth entered the small, isolated room where the counterfeit
  Dudley had been at work on the previous day, he drew a breath of relief; for
  there, at least, was the original, secure in its frame. But his relief was
  short-lived; for Dudley, who had followed him closely, strode up to the
  picture and, after a quick, critical glance, turned to him with raised
  eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"That is my copy," said he.</p>

  <p>Fittleworth felt all his terror reviving, and yet this awful thing seemed
  impossible.</p>

  <p>"How can it be?" he exclaimed. "You see that the canvas is quite uninjured
  and the frame is screwed to the wall."</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about that," replied Dudley. "I only know that that's my
  copy."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth directed an agonised stare through the glass, and as he looked
  more closely, he felt a growing suspicion that the painter was right. The
  brush work and even the surface of the original had been closely and cleverly
  imitated, but still--here Fittleworth turned sharply to an attendant, who had
  followed them into the room.</p>

  <p>"Go and fetch a screwdriver," said he, "and bring another man with
  you."</p>

  <p>The attendant hurried away and returned almost immediately accompanied by
  a workman, carrying a screwdriver. The frame of the picture, unlike some
  others in the gallery, was fitted with brass plates which were screwed to
  hard wood plugs let into the wall. By Fittleworth's direction, the workman
  proceeded to unscrew one of the plates while his assistant grasped the
  picture frame. Fittleworth impatiently watched the screwdriver as it made
  about a dozen turns, when the man stopped and looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"There's something rummy about this screw, sir," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"It seems to turn all right," said Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it turns all right," said the man, "but it don't git no forrader.
  Let's try another."</p>

  <p>He did so, but the second screw developed the same peculiar properties.
  And then a most remarkable thing happened. As the workman stepped back to
  direct a puzzled look at the screw-plates, his assistant must have pulled
  slightly at the frame for it began to separate visibly from the wall. The
  workman dropped his screwdriver and seized the frame which, with another
  pull, came away bodily, with the four screws loose in the plates.</p>

  <p>Fittleworth uttered a cry of despair. A single glance at the back of the
  brand-new canvas put the fraud beyond all doubt, and another glance at the
  screws left little to be explained as to the methods adopted by the robber.
  To Dudley, however, who was unaware of the events of the previous day, the
  whole affair was a profound mystery.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how they managed it at all," said he, "unless they got in in
  the night."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you about it presently," said Fittleworth. "Meanwhile, if you
  will lend us your copy for a few days, we will put the frame back; and mind,"
  he added, addressing the attendants, "nothing is to be said about this at
  present."</p>

  <p>When the picture had been replaced and the men had gone away, Fittleworth
  gave the artist a brief account of the happenings of the previous day, to
  which Dudley listened thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I see the general scheme," said he, "but what I don't understand is how
  that man managed to do it all in such a short time, and with people moving
  about the galleries, too."</p>

  <p>"I think that's all clear enough," said Fittleworth, "see, the actual
  exchange of the pictures need have taken less than a minute. Everything had
  been carefully prepared beforehand. The thieves must have come here on
  previous days with the dummy screws in their pockets, and it would be the
  easiest thing in the world to take out the screws one at a time and push the
  dummies in in their place. And as to loosening the canvas in the frame, two
  men could easily do that in a minute or two, when once the screws were
  removed, if they had a sentinel posted in the corridor. Comparatively few
  people come to this room, you know."</p>

  <p>"But that would need three men at least," objected Dudley.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," replied Fittleworth, "and I think there were three men; the
  hautboy player was one; his business being to draw every one away from the
  scene of action, and I feel no doubt that the water-colourist was another; a
  sentinel posted in the corridor to keep watch while the third man made the
  exchange."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Dudley; "and when he'd made the exchange he oiled out the
  original, rubbed on some colour and put in a few touches on the high
  lights."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth nodded. "Yes," said he, "that is what he must have done; and
  it would have been fairly easy since the picture was in such good condition
  and there were no cracks to cover up."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Dudley. "It would, it would. But, all the same, he must have
  been a pretty fair colourist and uncommonly skilful with his brush."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he must," agreed Fittleworth, "and that suggests a very important
  question: this man obviously knew you well, as is proved by the exactness
  with which he personated you. He also knew exactly what you were doing and
  has known for some time past, for this was evidently a premeditated scheme,
  most carefully thought out. Moreover, the personator was clearly a painter of
  some skill, and even allowing for his make-up must have resembled you
  somewhat in appearance. Now, Mr. Dudley, can you think of anyone to whom that
  description could apply?"</p>

  <p>The painter reflected awhile, and Fittleworth added, somewhat abruptly:
  "Who commissioned this picture?"</p>

  <p>"This copy," replied Dudley, "and the one I was doing next door were
  commissioned by an American gentleman, named Strauss, who is staying at the
  Savoy."</p>

  <p>"What is Mr. Strauss like?" Fittleworth asked.</p>

  <p>"He is a tall, lean man, somewhat like the portraits of Abraham
  Lincoln."</p>

  <p>"Ah," murmured Fittleworth, recalling the hautboy player. "How did you
  come to make Mr. Strauss' acquaintance?"</p>

  <p>"He introduced himself to me a month or so ago, when I was copying at the
  Luxembourg; in fact," added Dudley, with a sudden flash of reminiscence, "it
  was he who suggested that excellent box to protect one's work. He had one
  made for a copy that I did in Paris, and he provided me with two more for
  these two copies."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth reflected profoundly. The modus operandi of this clever fraud
  was becoming more and more obvious. Clearly, it would be necessary to make
  inquiries about Mr. Strauss, and meanwhile, the Director of the Gallery would
  have to be told about the catastrophe; a horrible duty, to the execution of
  which Fittleworth braced himself with a sinking heart and with a suspicion
  that his official days were numbered.</p>

  <p>An unwonted air of depression brooded that evening over the modest
  apartments of Miss Katharine Hyde, for Fittleworth had just recounted, in
  minute detail, and a hushed, funereal voice, the appalling history of the
  robbery.</p>

  <p>"It's a hideous affair," he groaned, in conclusion. "The Director took it
  very well, considering all things, but, of course, I shall have to go."</p>

  <p>"Did he say so?" asked Katharine.</p>

  <p>"No, but you know the sort of howl that will be raised when the thing
  becomes known. It'll be frightfully uncomfortable for him, and the least I
  can do is to take the full blame, seeing that I actually carried the picture
  out. I shall have to offer to resign and he'll have to accept my resignation.
  What I shall do or a livelihood after that, the Lord only knows."</p>

  <p>"It's dreadful for you," said Katharine, "with all your talents and
  accomplishments, too."</p>

  <p>"It is hard," agreed Fittleworth; "just as there seemed a chance of our
  being able to marry after all these years. I suppose I ought to release you,
  Katie, now that our prospects seem hopeless."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked simply. "I shouldn't want anyone else, you know; and as
  to my freedom, well, I'm free to be a spinster now if you don't marry me. But
  we won't give up hope. Perhaps the picture will be found, after all, and then
  you won't have to resign. Is it a very valuable picture?</p>

  <p>"It's worse than that," said Fittleworth. "It was a loan, and I should say
  of priceless value to the owners for sentimental reasons."</p>

  <p>Katharine looked interested, and being anxious to divert her lover from
  the subject of their personal misfortunes, asked for more particulars.</p>

  <p>"The picture has quite an interesting history," said Fittleworth. "It was
  painted by Kneller in 1688, and the story goes that the king was actually
  sitting to the painter when a messenger arrived with the news that the Prince
  of Orange had landed in Torbay. The portrait was intended as a gift to Samuel
  Pepys to whom the king was greatly attached, and in spite of the agitation
  that the bad tidings naturally produced, he commanded Kneller to proceed and
  get the portrait finished so that his old friend and loyal servant should not
  be disappointed."</p>

  <p>"And did Pepys get the picture?" Katharine asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes; and what's more, it remains in the possession of the family to this
  day, or, at least, it did until it was stolen. So you see, apart from its
  intrinsic value as a painting, it has this especial value to the family. I
  had sooner those brutes had stolen almost any other picture in the gallery,
  even the Raphael Madonna."</p>

  <p>"Is there no clue whatever to the identity of the thief?" Katharine
  asked.</p>

  <p>"There was one clue," Fittleworth replied, "but it has broken off short;
  an American gentleman, named Strauss, who commissioned the portrait. We
  looked him up at the Savoy, but he has disappeared, and nothing whatever is
  known as to whence he came or whither he has gone. He was undoubtedly one of
  the robbers, but he seems to have vanished into thin air."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," said Katherine, "I daresay the police will soon catch him and
  he'll be sure to have taken care of the picture;" and with this hopeful
  prognosis, the subject was dismissed, at least from speech, though in the
  minds of both the young people the missing picture remained as a sombre
  background to all other thought.</p>

  <p>As he walked to the gallery on the following morning, Fittleworth
  considered, for the hundredth time, the most prudent form of procedure.
  Should he write an official letter tendering his resignation, or should he
  adopt the less final and deadly plan of offering verbally to resign? He was
  undecided when he turned in at the gate and began to ascend the steps; but he
  reached a decision as he reached the third step from the top, at the very
  moment when he collided with a commissionaire who was also ascending in
  company with a brown paper parcel. He would resign, in the first place, at
  any rate, by word of mouth and see how they took it.</p>

  <p>And having formed this decision, he proceeded without further delay to put
  it in execution.</p>

  <p>The Director and the Keeper had apparently talked the matter over,
  anticipating this course of action. "Well, Fittleworth," said the former,
  "the matter doesn't rest with me. If it did, I should say--Who's this from,
  Jenkins?" The question was addressed to an attendant who had just brought in
  a brown paper parcel, addressed by name to the Director.</p>

  <p>"Don't know, Sir John," was the reply. "A commissionaire brought it. He
  said there was no answer and he's gone."</p>

  <p>The Director nodded, and as the man went out he scrutinised the parcel
  critically and examined the typewritten address label. "If the matter rested
  entirely with me," he resumed, "I should say--er--now, what the deuce can
  this be?" He turned the flattish, oblong parcel, over and over, and finally,
  picking up the office penknife, applied its edge abstractedly to the string.
  "I should say," he repeated--"if the matter rested with me, that is, which,
  of course, it doesn't, that--it's a box. I haven't ordered any box. I wonder
  what the deuce--" Here he pulled the paper fairly open and Fittleworth
  uttered a cry of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Fittleworth?" Sir John asked; to which the former made no
  reply, but leaning across the table, quickly pulled out the sliding lid of
  the box. And then there fell on the room the silence of utter amazement, for,
  from the shallow box, there looked out composedly the familiar features of
  James the Second.</p>

  <p>"Well," Sir John exclaimed, at length, "this is the most astonishing
  affair of all. I suppose it's all right," he added suspiciously, unclamping
  the picture and lifting it out of the box. "They're such uncommonly artful
  dodgers; still, I think there's no doubt this is the genuine original. But
  why on earth have they returned it, after taking all that trouble to steal
  it?"</p>

  <p>The three men pored over the canvas, searching suspiciously for any sign
  of change or substitution. But there was none. The surface of the painting
  was unaltered and apparently none the worse for its recent vicissitudes.</p>

  <p>"They seem to have handled it carefully," Mr. Barnard remarked. "No one
  would dream that it had been covered up with fresh paint."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Sir John; "it hasn't left a trace. They must have used a
  slow-drying oil and cleaned it off immediately. But," he added, turning the
  picture over, "they had the canvas off the stretcher. Do you notice?" He held
  the picture towards the other two, who eyed it narrowly.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me, Sir John," said Fittleworth, after running his eye round
  the edge of the canvas, "that it's only been off at one end. The tacks at the
  top and the upper part of the sides don't seem to have been disturbed."</p>

  <p>The Director looked at the picture once more. "You're quite right,
  Fittleworth," said he. "The canvas has been off the stretcher at the lower
  end only; and what's more, the bottom bar of the stretcher has been removed
  and replaced by a fresh piece. Do you see that? The piece that has been
  inserted is old wood but it's different from the other three, and you can
  clearly make out the fresh surface that has been left in cutting the tenons.
  It is a very astonishing thing. What do you make of it, Barnard?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnard could make nothing of it and said so. "The whole thing is a
  complete mystery to me," said he. "They may have damaged the old stretcher
  bar and had to replace it; but I don't see why they wanted to unfasten the
  canvas at all."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," said Sir John, "but the main thing is that we've got the
  picture back uninjured, and, that being so, perhaps you would like to
  reconsider your resignation, Fittleworth."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I will, Sir John," replied the latter. "The affair is known
  to several people and there's bound to be some sort of inquiry."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," rejoined the Director. "At any rate, we will hear
  what the Trustees say. Of course, if the matter rested with me--but it
  doesn't; so, for the time being, I must accept your resignation."</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>PART II</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was perhaps fortunate that Saturday is a public day at
  most galleries, and so, an off-day for copyists; for in any case there would
  have been no work on this disastrous morning for Miss Katharine. Within a few
  minutes of Fittleworth's arrival at the Gallery, she had taken up a position
  at the foot of the Nelson Column to await the promised report on the course
  of events. Fittleworth, on leaving the Director's room, made straight for the
  trysting place, and was received with a bright smile and a small,
  outstretched hand, as they turned away together towards Whitehall.</p>

  <p>"Well," asked Kate, "what has happened?"</p>

  <p>"I've offered to resign," replied Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"And of course Sir John scouted the idea?" said Katharine.</p>

  <p>"Oh, did he?" exclaimed Fittleworth. "Not at all. He did say that if the
  matter rested with him, he'd--"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"I don't quite know, but the great news is that the picture has come
  back."</p>

  <p>"Oh, good!" exclaimed Katharine. "But, if it has come back, why on earth
  should you resign?"</p>

  <p>"You'll see if I tell you how it came back;" and here Fittleworth
  described the mysterious return of the picture and the still more mysterious
  change of the stretcher bar.</p>

  <p>"But I still don't see why you're resigning," Katharine persisted.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Fittleworth, "I'll explain. You see, Sir John and Barnard are
  concerned with the picture, qua picture, and from that point of view, a
  stretcher-bar is just a stretcher-bar and nothing else. But there's one point
  that they've overlooked--at least, I think they have. This was not only a
  picture: it was a family relic."</p>

  <p>"But what has that to do with it?" asked Katharine.</p>

  <p>"That question, my dear girl, is best answered by another. What did those
  men want with the old stretcher-bar?</p>

  <p>"Well, what did they?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Fittleworth; "but as soon, as I saw that the bar
  had been changed, I realised that there was something more in this robbery
  than met the eye. Consider the facts, Katie. First you will see that these
  men were not common thieves, for they have not only returned the property,
  but have obviously been most careful not to injure it; which is quite unlike
  a criminal, who is usually perfectly regardless of the amount of damage he
  does. In the second place, you will notice that these men wanted the bottom
  stretcher-bar of the canvas, and wanted it so badly that they were willing to
  go to great trouble and expense to get it. Next, you will see that these are
  men of very superior intelligence. One of them is quite a skilful painter,
  and another an expert musician, and one of them, at least, is a person of
  great ingenuity. And now, consider the picture itself. It was painted for the
  King when the Revolution had actually begun and was to be given into the
  custody of a man who was the King's trusty friend, who was a man of
  unswerving loyalty, of infallible judgment and discretion, and who was so
  perfect a man of the world that he was practically certain not to be involved
  in any of the troubles that were to follow. What does this suggest to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't suggest anything," she replied, with a vague little shake of
  the head. "What does it suggest to you?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, "you will agree that for a small and precious object,
  the stretcher-bar of a valuable picture would furnish an ideal hiding-place;
  and seeing that three men who are obviously not fools have gone to immense
  trouble to get possession of this bar, I am inclined to assume that it had
  been used for that purpose."</p>

  <p>"Really, Joe!" exclaimed Katharine, "what a delightfully romantic idea!
  And how Machiavellian of you to have thought of it! Shall we turn into the
  Park for a little while?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth assented, and as they had now reached the gates of the Horse
  Guards, they passed through, furtively watched by the gaudy sentinel, who
  stood, like some gorgeous tropical bird, keeping guard over the tunnel-like
  entry. The two lovers walked soberly across the great gravel expanse, and it
  was not until they had passed through the small gate into the Park, that they
  took up the thread of their talk. It was Katharine who spoke first.</p>

  <p>"Have you made any sort of guess as to what it was that was hidden in that
  bar?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," replied Fittleworth; "and it's no use guessing. But this
  much I think is plain: those men must have had some pretty definite
  information, and as they couldn't have got it from the picture, they must
  have got it from somewhere else; and the question is, where else could they
  have got it?</p>

  <p>"Could some one have told them?" Katharine suggested.</p>

  <p>"No, certainly not, for if anyone had known of the hiding-place, the
  hidden object would have been removed long ago. The only possible conclusion
  seems to be that a written record of the hiding-place exists and has been
  overlooked."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Katharine. "You mean among some of the old family
  papers."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," said Fittleworth, "but I think not. You see that, wherever the
  record is, these men have obtained access to it. Now, they can hardly be
  members of the family, for if they had been, they could have abstracted the
  stretcher-bar when the picture was in the private collection instead of
  waiting until it was in a public gallery. So that it seems to follow that the
  record that they have seen, is in some place which is accessible to the
  public. And if it is accessible to the public, why, you see, Katie dear, that
  it must be accessible to us."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Katharine. "I suppose it must; ii we only knew where to look
  for it. But perhaps my Machiavellian Joseph has thought of that, too."</p>

  <p>"I haven't had much time to think about it at all," replied Fittleworth;
  "but there is one likely place that occurs to me, and probably much the most
  likely: my old college."</p>

  <p>"At Cambridge?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Magdalene. That was Pepys's college, you know, and he bequeathed to
  it, not only the famous Diary, but a large number of manuscript memoirs on
  naval and political affairs, as well as prints and collections of ancient
  paintings. It is highly probable that the document of which we are assuming
  the existence is among the papers in the Pepysian library; but if it is,
  there is one little difficulty which will have to be got over."</p>

  <p>"What is that?</p>

  <p>"Why, you remember that the prudent and secretive Samuel had a way of
  writing his private memoranda in shorthand, which he evidently used for
  security rather than brevity; and that being so, we may be pretty certain
  that our hypothetical document would be in shorthand, too. That is rather a
  serious difficulty, though I fancy that the system that he used was not a
  very complicated one. I must find out what Rich's system is like."</p>

  <p>Katharine clapped her hands. "Rich's!" she exclaimed. "How delightful!
  Have you forgotten that I am an expert in Rich's shorthand?"</p>

  <p>"I never knew," said Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I'm sure that I told you. It was when I used to copy drawings and
  manuscripts at the British Museum that I got a commission to make a facsimile
  of a volume written in Rich's shorthand. Of course, it was necessary to know
  something about the system or I should have got the characters wrong, so I
  learnt it up from an old handbook, and by the time I had done my task I had
  become rather skilful. It's really quite simple, you know, as compared with
  modern systems like Pitman's."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth regarded Katharine with admiring surprise. "What a clever
  little lady it is!" he remarked, "and how opportunely clever, too! Do you
  think it would take you long to teach me?"</p>

  <p>"But what is it that you propose to do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I propose to go down to Magdalene, and go through all the Pepys papers of
  the Revolution period, keeping an especially sharp look-out for any written
  in short hand. There are not likely to be many of these, for poor old Pepys's
  eyesight became so bad that he had to give up keeping a shorthand diary after
  1670."</p>

  <p>Katharine reflected earnestly, and as they took possession of an empty
  seat in a secluded path, she wrapped her hand coaxingly around his arm.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to make a rather bold proposition, Joe. Of course you can learn
  Rich's shorthand without any difficulty. But it would take some time and a
  good deal of trouble, whereas I already know it and have had quite a lot of
  experience in copying and reading the characters. Now, why shouldn't you take
  me with you to Cambridge and let me decipher the shorthand papers?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth took a critical survey of the toe of his boot, and reflected
  on the personal peculiarities of a a mythical female of the name of Grundy;
  and Katharine, stealing a cautious glance at him, deciphered a cryptogram
  that was easier than Rich's.</p>

  <p>"Maggie Flinders would put me up, I know," she said a propos of the
  decipherment. "She's a something at Newnham, and we're quite old
  friends."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth's face cleared. "That gets rid of one difficulty," said he,
  "and the other difficulty I must get over as best I can."</p>

  <p>"You mean the expense that the inquiry will involve?" said Katharine.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You see, I have no doubt that something of considerable value has
  been stolen, and stolen through my thick-headedness; and if that something
  can be recovered, it's my duty to get it back if I spend my last halfpenny in
  doing it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Katharine. "I quite agree with you, excepting as to the
  thick-headedness, which is all nonsense; for of course the Director himself
  would have been taken in if he'd been in your place. So I'm going to make
  another proposition. I am just as keen on your getting this thing back as you
  are; in fact, your credit is my credit. Now, I have a little capital put by
  for a contingency that doesn't seem likely to arise just at present, and I
  should like to invest some of it in our joint undertaking."</p>

  <p>It is needless to say that Fittleworth objected violently. It is equally
  needless to say that Katharine trampled on his objections with scorn, and
  that when they rose from the seat, the inevitable thing had happened. As the
  poet expresses it: "Man has his will but Woman has her way." The joint
  expedition to Cambridge was an accepted fact.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>PART III</h3>

  <p class="first">THE services of Miss Flinders were not required after all.
  An old friend of Fittleworth's, a tutor and fellow of the college, who had
  married and settled down in Cambridge, had accommodation in his house for a
  pair of industriously studious turtledoves, and was even willing to provide
  them with a small study in which to carry out their researches.</p>

  <p>So, Mrs. Grundy being thus appeased on extremely advantageous terms, the
  doves aforesaid took up their abode in the residence of Mr. Arthur Winton,
  M.A., and the permission of the Master of the College that of the Curator of
  the Pepysian Library having been applied for and obtained, the great
  investigation began.</p>

  <p>It was a Tuesday morning, bright and sunny, when Fittleworth set forth on
  his quest. He carried with him, in addition to a quarto notebook, a
  half-plate camera of wooden construction, the property of Mr. Winton, who was
  an expert photographer and who had made the excellent suggestion that any
  likely documents should be photographed in order that they might be studied
  quietly at home and facsimile copies retained permanently for subsequent
  reference. So Fittleworth went forth with the camera in his hand and bright
  hope in his heart, picturing himself already restoring to its unconscious
  owner that (presumably precious) object of unknown nature, the very existence
  of which was unsuspected by anyone but himself. It would be a great
  achievement. His credit would be thereby completely restored and he must
  infallibly be reinstated in his not very lucrative office.</p>

  <p>The first cool draught which blew upon his enthusiasm came from the
  material placed at his disposal. It was a colossal mass. Apart from the
  prints, drawings, maps and collections of poetry, none of which could be
  entirely disregarded--for even the poems might contain a concealed
  hint--there was an enormous bulk of miscellaneous papers, all of which must
  be gone through before any could be rejected. And, as he gazed at the
  collection with growing dismay, he realised for the first time the
  extraordinary vagueness of his quest. What was it, after all, that he was
  looking for? The question admitted only of the most ambiguous answer. He had
  but two fixed points; the Revolution and the portrait by Kneller. Of the
  connection between them he was totally ignorant, and so might easily miss the
  clue even if it were under his very eyes.</p>

  <p>The famous Diary he dismissed after a brief glance of fond curiosity, for
  its last sad entry of May the 3rd 1669, was long before the stormy days when
  the catholic obstinacy of James brought its inevitable catastrophe. Other
  dated papers, too, could be set aside; but when all that was possible in this
  way had been done, the residue that remained to be studied was still
  appalling in its bulk. The first day was entirely taken up by a preliminary
  inspection, of which the chief result was profound discouragement. There
  followed a fortnight of close and strenuous labour, involving the minute
  study of countless documents on every possible subject, with fruitless
  efforts to extract from them some information bearing even indirectly on the
  picture. Day after day did he return to Katharine with the same dismal report
  of utter failure; and though his spirits revived under the influence of her
  bright hopefulness, yet as the the job ran on and the joint capital dwindled,
  so did his optimism grow less. It was a bigger undertaking than he had
  bargained for. The mass of material and the formalities accompanying the
  examination of precious relics involved an expenditure of time and labour
  that was quite beyond his calculations.</p>

  <p>And there was another discouraging element, of which for the present he
  said nothing to Katharine. As the days passed without a hint of any clue, a
  horrible suspicion began to creep into his mind. Suppose the whole thing was
  a delusion! That the substitution of the stretcher-bar was due merely to some
  chance accident, and that he was searching for something that had no
  existence save in his own imagination. Then all this labour and time and
  ill-spared money were utterly thrown away. It was a dreadful thought; and as
  it came to him again and again at increasingly frequent intervals, his heart
  sank and the future grew dark and hopeless.</p>

  <p>It was on the fifteenth day that the first faint ray of hope pierced the
  gloom of his growing despair. On that day, amidst a collection of
  unclassified papers, he lit on something that at least invited inquiry. The
  find consisted of three small sheets of paper, evidently torn from a pocket
  memorandum book, each about four inches by two and a half, and all covered
  with microscopic writing in a strange, crabbed character which Fittleworth
  immediately recognised as some kind of shorthand. There was nothing to
  indicate the date, and, on applying to the librarian, Fittleworth was
  informed that nothing was known about the little papers excepting that they
  had belonged to Pepys, and were almost certainly in his handwriting. The
  script on them had never been deciphered, although several persons--one quite
  recently--had examined them; and the librarian was of opinion that they were
  never likely to be, as the writing was so small und so excessively shaky and
  badly written that it appeared to be practically undecipherable.</p>

  <p>The librarian's report was, on the face of it, discouraging. But to
  Fittleworth the very illegibility of the writing gave it an added interest,
  hinting, as it did, at a late period when the use of the shorthand had become
  difficult. At his request the Diary was produced for comparison of the style
  of handwriting; and, on comparing the first of the six volumes with the List,
  it was evident that there was a change in the character of the script, though
  even the last entry, where Pepys records the failure of his eyesight, was
  much clearer and better written than the microscopic scrawl on these three
  loose leaves. Which was highly satisfactory, provided only that the
  illegibility was not so complete as to render decipherment utterly
  impossible.</p>

  <p>Having applied for and obtained permission to photograph the three
  leaves--each of which had writing on one side only--Fittleworth exposed three
  plates, and then, suspending his labours for the day, set forth homeward full
  of excitement and revived hope.</p>

  <p>He was, just approaching the house when Katharine overtook him and,
  judging by his early return that something had happened, asked eagerly: "Have
  you got it, Joe?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth smiled. "I've got some sort of document in shorthand," he
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it says anything about the picture?" asked Katharine. "But
  there," she added, with a laugh, "my excitement is making me talk nonsense.
  Of course, I've got to find out what it says."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Fittleworth, "you have; and I wish you joy of the job. It's a
  fearful scrawl; so bad that nobody has been able to decipher it yet. The
  librarian tells me," he added, with a knowing glance at her, "that only three
  months ago, an American scholar, who had obtained permission to go through
  the collection, spent more than a week trying to decipher it with the aid of
  a watchmaker's lens and had to give it up after all. So you see, my dear,
  that you have a very pretty little task before you."</p>

  <p>Katharine looked at him thoughtfully. "That doesn't sound very
  encouraging," she said; and then, after a pause, during which she reflected
  profoundly, with her usually smooth forehead furrowed by cogitative wrinkles,
  she looked up suddenly. "I suppose, Joe, he didn't make anything of it after
  all."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth laughed genially. "I was waiting for that," said he. "You are
  thinking that the American scholar may be a gentleman of musical tastes. I
  expect you are right and I hope you are, as that would prove that we are
  really on the track of our friends; but we shall be able to judge better when
  you have given us a sample of your skill. We shall be rather up a tree if
  you're not able to decipher the thing."</p>

  <p>The latter contingency Katharine declined to entertain, and the pair,
  resisting the attractions of tea, made straight for Mr. Winton's dark-room.
  The three plates were developed without a hitch, and while two were drying in
  the rack, the third was taken to the window for inspection.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Fittleworth, as Katharine stood at lie window, holding out
  the wet negative towards the sky, "what do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>For some seconds Katharine made no reply, but continued to gaze at the
  crabbed lines on the black background with a frown that gradually
  deepened.</p>

  <p>"It's very small writing," she replied, at length, "and frightfully
  indistinct."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was afraid it was," said Fittleworth; "but can you make out
  anything of the--er--purport, or--er--or, what it's about, in fact?"</p>

  <p>There was a brief pause; then Katharine, looking him tragically in the
  eyes, exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"My dear Joe, I can't make out a single word. It's absolute scribble."</p>

  <p>There was another pause, at the end of which Fittleworth murmured the
  single and highly irrelevant word, "Moses!"</p>

  <p>The impatience of the investigators would not allow them to wait for the
  natural drying of the negatives One after another, the plates were plunged
  into methylated spirit, and when dry, printed off rapidly on glossy bromide
  paper; and with the prints before her on a table by the study window, the
  agonised Katharine fell to work with Fittleworth's pocket lens and a most
  portentous frown.</p>

  <p>Five minutes passed. Fittleworth moved stealthily, but uneasily, about the
  room on tiptoe, now forcing himself to sit on the edge of a chair, and now
  forced by his excitement to rise and tiptoe across to another. At length,
  unable to contain himself any longer, he asked in a hushed voice: "Is it very
  awful stuff, Katie?"</p>

  <p>Katharine laid down the lens and looked round at him despairingly.</p>

  <p>"It's perfectly frightful, Joe," she exclaimed. "I simply can't make
  anything of it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it isn't Rich's shorthand at all," suggested Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes it is. I can see that much and I've made out a 'with' and two
  'the's,' but the rest of it looks like mere scribble."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth sprang from the chair on which he had been seated nearly ten
  seconds. "Oh, come," said he; "if you can make out that much, you can make
  out the rest. Only we shall have to go to work systematically. The best way
  will be to mark each word as you decipher it and write it down on a piece of
  paper. That's the best of working from a photograph which it doesn't matter
  about spoiling."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see what you mean," said Katharine.</p>

  <p>"The method I suggest is this," he replied. "First mark the three
  photographs A, B and C. Then, number the lines of each and prepare three
  sheets of paper lettered and numbered in the same way. Then, when you
  decipher a word, say on photograph A line 6, write it down on the sheet
  marked A, on the sixth line and the proper part of that line; and so on.
  Could I help you?"</p>

  <p>Katharine thought that he could, and accordingly, he drew a chair to the
  table and proceeded to prepare three sheets of paper in the way he had
  suggested and to mark the photographs.</p>

  <p>There is something about a really methodical procedure, that inspires
  confidence. Of this Katharine was immediately sensible, and when the two
  "the's" and the "with" had been set down in their proper places, she felt
  that a beginning had really been made and returned to her task with renewed
  spirit.</p>

  <p>"There's a 'his,'" she announced presently, "at the end of line 1, page B,
  and the first word of the next line is a longish one ending in 'ty.'"</p>

  <p>"It isn't 'Majesty,' I suppose," suggested Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course it is," exclaimed Katharine, "and the next word is 'wt,'
  followed by two short words ending in 'll.'"</p>

  <p>"White Hall?" queried Fittleworth; and White Hall it turned out to be on
  further examination. The next proceeding was to search for a recurrence of
  these words with the result that "His Majesty" occurred six times in all, and
  "'White Hall" twice.</p>

  <p>"Now try the words adjoining 'His Majesty,'" Fittleworth suggested. "Take
  the one on page B. We've got 'His Majesty at White Hall.' Now, what is before
  that?"</p>

  <p>"There's a 'me' and then 'attack' or 'attach.'"</p>

  <p>"'Me attack His Majesty,'" murmured Fittleworth. "That doesn't sound
  right. Could it be 'attend'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I believe it is, and then the word before it must be 'bidding.'
  We're getting on splendidly. Let us try the 'His Majestys' on page A. Line 5
  seems to begin: 'As to its' something, 'His Majesty has' something,
  'his'--now, what has His Majesty done? Oh, I see, 'written.' 'His Majesty has
  written his--"</p>

  <p>"Instructions," suggested Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"No, nor wishes, nor--oh, I see 'commands,' and the next words are 'in
  full in a' something, 'which he' something 'to me in a small' something
  'box.' Now, let us see if we can fill in that sentence. 'As to its'
  something, 'His Majesty has written his commands'; now, as to his what? It
  seems to begin with a 'd'."</p>

  <p>"Destiny?" suggested Fittleworth, and as Katharine shook her head he
  proposed "destruction," "deposition," and finally, "disposition."</p>

  <p>"No, it's not 'disposition.' It's 'disposal.' 'As to its disposal His
  Majesty has written his commands in full in a paper which he'--something 'to
  me in a small' something 'box which he--'"</p>

  <p>"Gave, sent, presented, showed, exhibited..."</p>

  <p>"'Delivered,' that's it. 'Delivered to me in a small' something
  'box.'"</p>

  <p>"Wooden, ivory, leather, silver--"</p>

  <p>"Gold," announced Katharine triumphantly, "'a small, gold box'; and the
  sentence runs on: 'the said box being' something 'with His Majesty's'
  something, something, 'and this box he bid me put by in some safe and '--it
  looks like 'secret place.' I'm getting to read it much more easily now. Let
  us go hack to that 'box.' 'With His Majesty's' something seal,' I think."</p>

  <p>"Private seal, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. Then it reads: 'The said box being sealed with His
  Majesty's private seal and this box he bid me put by in some safe and secret
  place.' This is splendid, Joe. We shall make it out yet and you can see
  already that we're on the right track."</p>

  <p>"Yes; and we can see how those other gentlemen got on the track. But as
  you seem to be getting more used to the writing, wouldn't it be as well now
  to try to begin at the beginning and go straight on?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would. But the question is, which is the beginning?"</p>

  <p>"The best way to solve that difficulty would be to work out the first line
  of each page. Don't you think so, Katie?</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course; and I'll begin with page A. Now, the first line seems to
  read: 'bids me to carry '--no, it isn't 'carry'; I think it's
  'convey'--'convey it to Sir'--Andrew, I think--'Sir Andrew Hyde--'"</p>

  <p>At this point Katharine laid down the lens and turned to gaze at
  Fittleworth with a very curious expression of surprise and bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"A namesake of yours, Katie," he remarked; "an ancestor, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Joe, that's just it. Only, in that case it would be 'Sir Andreas.'"
  She scrutinised the paper again through the lens and at length exclaimed
  triumphantly, "and it is 'Andreas.' Let us see how it goes on: 'To Sir
  Andreas Hyde, a cousin of my Lord Clarendon'--yes, that is the man--'who is
  to deposit it in some secure place in one of his houses in Kent.' I wonder if
  he means the picture!"</p>

  <p>"We shall see presently," said Fittleworth; "but meanwhile it is evident
  that this is not the first page. Just have a look at page C."</p>

  <p>Katharine transferred her attention, as well as her excitement would
  permit, to the latter page; but after a prolonged examination she shook her
  head.</p>

  <p>"This isn't the first," she said, "for the top line begins with the words:
  'had concluded the business.' Then page B must be the first. Let us try
  that." She brought the lens to bear on the opening words of page B, but after
  a brief inspection she sat up with an exclamation of disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Joe, how tantalising! This isn't the first either! There's a page
  missing. You will have to go back to the library and see if you can find
  it."</p>

  <p>"That's rather a facer," said Fittleworth; "but I think, Katie dear, we'd
  better work out what we've got as these pages will have to be deciphered in
  any case, and then we shall be able to judge how much is missing. Let us have
  the first line of page B."</p>

  <p>With a dejected air Katharine picked up the lens and resumed her task,
  slowly reading out, with many a halt to puzzle over a difficult word, the
  contents of page B.</p>

  <p>"...to me a messenger bidding me attend His Majesty at White Hall.
  Whereupon I set forth and found the King in the Matted Gallery, talking with
  divers officers and noblemen. When I had kissed his hand he spoke to me
  openly on the affairs of the navy, but presently, making an occasion to carry
  me to his closet, did there open the matter concerning which he had sent for
  me. It appeareth that he hath caught some rumours of certain noblemen and
  bishops--even the Archbishop as he do think--having invited the Prince of
  Orange; which he did condemn as most fowle, unhandsome and treasonable. Now,
  recalling the misfortunes of his brother the late King and their royal
  father, he would make some provision lest he should be driven into exile,
  which God forbid. Here upon he spake very graciously of our long friendship
  and was pleased to mention most handsomely my faithful service and judgement
  in the service of the navy, and then he did come to the matter in hand. First
  he spake of Sir William Pepys who did bring his ship the 'James and
  Mary'..."</p>

  <p>That was the end of page B, and, as Katharine eagerly to scan the already
  deciphered first the other two pages, her eyes filled.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Joe dear!" she exclaimed in an agonised voice, "what an awful
  disappointment! Don't you see? It doesn't run on at all. These are only odd
  leaves."</p>

  <p>"M'yes," said Fittleworth. "It does look rather a take in. Still, we'd
  better go on. And as page C seems to refer to the conclusion of the business,
  whatever it was, we may as well take A next. Keep up your courage, little
  woman. I may be able to find the missing pages at the library. Now, what has
  page A got to say?"</p>

  <p>Once more Katharine addressed herself to her task, wiping her eyes as a
  preliminary measure; and slowly and with many a halt to wrestle with an
  almost undecipherable word, the crabbed scrawl was translated into good,
  legible longhand.</p>

  <p>"...bids me to convey it to Sir Andreas Hide, a cousin of my Lord
  Clarendon, who is to deposit it in some secure place in one of his houses in
  Kent. As to its disposal, His Majesty hath written his commands in full in a
  paper which he delivered to me in a small golde box, the said box being
  sealed with His Majesty's private seale, and this box he bid me put by in
  some safe and secret place, and to speake of the matter to none, not even Sir
  Andreas himselfe, until after His Majesty's death and that of the Prince of
  Wales (if God should spare me so long) unless, in my discretion it should
  seeme goode to do so. Also that I do make some provision for the delivery of
  the said paper in the event of my own death.</p>

  <p>"When I had returned home I considered at length where I should bestowe
  the golde box, and presently I bethought me of the King's picture which Sir
  Godfrey is now about Painting and which His Majesty do design to give to me,
  and it did appear to me that the wooden frame whereon the canvass is strained
  should furnish a moste secure hiding-place. I made no delay to seek out Sir
  Andreas at his house at Lee in Kent, to whom the King had already spoken
  about the matter, and did deliver into his hand the said..."</p>

  <p>Here the page ended, and, when she had written the last word, Katherine,
  alter a brief interval of numb silence, fairly burst into tears.</p>

  <p>Fittleworth stroked her hand consolingly. "There now, Katie darling," he
  said in a soothing tone. "We won't cry about it, though it is most
  confoundedly disappointing. You have done splendidly; and we are really
  picking up quite a lot of information."</p>

  <p>"But what was it that he gave Sir Andreas? It couldn't have been the
  picture, because he hadn't got it then."</p>

  <p>"No, evidently not. Let us work out page C. This is quite a short piece
  and looks rather like the end of the record."</p>

  <p>Once again, Katherine dried her eyes and took up the discarded lens; and
  slowly--but less slowly than before--the decipherment proceeded.</p>

  <p>"...had concluded the business, the tide serving, I did take boate to
  White Hall and there reported to His Majesty what I had done but said naught
  about the picture, reflecting that the secret shall be safer if t'is known to
  none save myselfe.</p>

  <p>"This is a weighty business and do trouble me somewhat; indeede I do
  mistruste the King's plan which hath too much of secrecie, and leaveth too
  much in the hands of one man, though that man be, God knows, honest in
  intention and wishful to serve His Majesty in all things, especially at this
  sorrowfull time. But I shall do as I am bid and if it please God that the
  affaire miscarry, at leaste it shall be through no lacke of zeale on my
  parte."</p>

  <p>As Katharine wrote the last word, she closed the lens and handed it back
  to Fittleworth. "There!" she exclaimed, "that is certainly the end of the
  record and we are just as wise as to what it was that he gave to Sir Andreas
  as we were before. You will have to go back to the library to-morrow and
  search for the missing leaves."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth held up an admonitory finger. "Now don't be an impatient and
  unreasonable little person, Katie. It is most likely that the missing pages
  have disappeared altogether, so, before we spend precious time in searching
  for them, let us consider what we have got out of these.</p>

  <p>"First, we know that the lost stretcher-bar contained a small gold box in
  which was an important document. That is a great point scored; a very great
  point, Katie; because, you will please to remember, it was pure guess-work as
  to whether there was anything at all in the stretcher until you deciphered
  these papers.</p>

  <p>"Then we know that Pepys handed to Sir Andreas a something that was
  evidently of considerable value. We don't know what that something was, but
  we know where it was deposited--at least we should if we could find out where
  Sir Andreas's houses in Kent were."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you that," said Katharine.</p>

  <p>"You can!" exclaimed Fittleworth, gazing at her in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied complacently, "I can tell you all about it. You seem to
  forget that I am a Hyde. This Sir Andreas was the head of our branch of the
  family and I know all about him. We were just plain country gentlefolk,
  unlike our great connections, the Clarendons, and the Rochesters, but we have
  pretty complete family records, and I have studied them in great detail. Sir
  Andreas had three houses; one at Lee, near London, one at Snodland, near
  Maidstone, and a third, a small place called Bartholomew Grange, in the Isle
  of Thanet. Sir Andreas, who was a Catholic, was killed at the Battle of the
  Boyne, and the family seems to have become considerably impoverished soon
  after, for his son, Matthew Hyde, sold the houses at Lee and Snodland and
  went out to New England."</p>

  <p>"And what became of those two houses?"</p>

  <p>"I believe they were both pulled down and rebuilt. At any rate, they went
  out of the family. Well, Matthew remained out in New England until the
  beginning of Queen Anne's reign--1703, I think--and then he set sail for home
  in a merchant ship called the Harvest Moon. The Harvest Moon sailed out of
  Boston Harbour in December, 1703, and was never heard of again, nor, of
  course, was Matthew Hyde; and the estate--what little there was of it--went
  to his son, Robert, who had remained in England."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth considered these facts in silence for some time, toying
  abstractedly with the papers. At length he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I think we can guess what happened. Pepys kept his own counsel during the
  whole reign of Dutch William, but when Anne came to the throne (she was a
  daughter of Anne Hyde, by the way, and a kinswoman of yours), he looked on
  the succession as settled, and being then an old man, thought it time to
  inform Matthew of the existence of the document hidden in the picture and
  that other something that he had given into the custody of Sir Andreas. I
  imagine that he sent a messenger to Matthew with a sealed letter containing
  this information, that Matthew immediately sailed for England and was lost at
  sea; and that before the news of the shipwreck reached this country Pepys
  himself was dead (he died on the twenty-first of May, 1704). Thus the secret
  was lost, even as wise old Samuel Pepys had feared that it might be."</p>

  <p>"But it isn't lost completely," Katharine reminded him, "for this
  ingenious 'American scholar' seems to have got on the track of it; and the
  question is how are we to get on his track?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know who owns the third house--Bartholomew Grange?" Fittleworth
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Katharine. "I own it."</p>

  <p>"You do!" exclaimed Fittleworth, staring at her incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I thought you knew. My father was the last male of this branch of
  the family and I am actually the last descendant. The little house in Thanet
  is all that remains of the family estates, and the rent of it is what I live
  on--that and my copying."</p>

  <p>"Then you could get access to it?</p>

  <p>"Of course I could. The present lease runs out next year, I am sorry to
  say--for my rent will cease then and I shall have to pay the wages of the
  housekeeper, who is an old servant of our family. So I could easily ask to
  make a survey of the premises. But of what use would it be? We have no
  evidence that the mysterious 'it' is hidden there, and if we had, we don't
  know what it is or where it is concealed."</p>

  <p>"No, my dear, that is perfectly true. But you are forgetting that we are
  in search of three men who probably believe (and perhaps with good reason)
  that they have the clue; and who almost certainly have the stolen gold box
  with them. If Bartholomew Grange is the only house remaining in the family,
  those gentlemen will undoubtedly look round there first; and if we are not
  too late, there we shall find them; and if we can't make them disgorge by
  fair means I shall have them arrested for the robbery of the picture.
  Remember, the gold box is our immediate object; the rest of the inquiry can
  wait."</p>

  <p>"And what do you propose to do next?" Katharine asked, as a flush of
  pleasurable excitement mounted to her cheek.</p>

  <p>"I propose that you send a letter to your tenant to-night and that we
  start for town the first thing to-morrow morning and from there go straight
  on to Thanet. We can talk over details as we go."</p>

  <p>Katherine gazed at her lover admiringly. "What a clever old thing you are,
  Joe!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I should think I am!" laughed Fittleworth. "If it hadn't been for my
  expert knowledge of Rich's shorthand and the neat way in which I deciphered
  that--"</p>

  <p>"Oh, go along, you old humbug!" Katharine exclaimed, making not very
  alarming hostile demonstrations. And, in a symbolical and strictly
  Pickwickian sense, he went along.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>PART IV</h3>

  <p class="first">THE Isle of Thanet has a certain peculiar charm which
  lingers even to this day, despite the too-successful efforts of the
  speculative builder to annihilate it. A few years ago--at the date of this
  history, for instance--before the unlovely suburban streets had arisen to
  disfigure it, the north-eastern quarter of the island wore a pleasant air of
  remoteness that disguised its proximity to busy Margate and prosperous
  Broadstairs. It was in this quarter that the business of our adventurers lay,
  and, having risen with the lark and been fortunate in the matter of trains,
  they reached it quite early in the day.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Fittleworth, sniffing the salt air with the joy of an
  escaped Londoner, as they left the outskirts of Margate behind, and took
  their way along the broad path by the cliff's edge; "your worthy ancestor
  wasn't such a bad judge, Katie. I shouldn't mind living here myself. By the
  way, I suppose there is no chance of your tenant objecting to our looking
  over the house?"</p>

  <p>"She can't; and if she could, she would not. She is quite a nice person, a
  widow lady with two daughters. I told her in my letter who you were, and that
  we wanted to see what would have to be done to the place if the tenancy was
  not renewed. I also mentioned that you were an artist, and greatly interested
  in old houses; which is perfectly true, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my dear. But I am a good deal more interested just now in
  three very ingenious gentlemen and a small gold box."</p>

  <p>"It will be frightfully disappointing if they haven't been here after
  all," said Katharine.</p>

  <p>"It will be much more frightful if they have been here and gone away.
  That's what I am afraid of. They have had a pretty long start."</p>

  <p>"They have; but they couldn't have ransacked the place without the consent
  of Mrs. Matthews, my tenant. But we shall soon know everything; that is the
  house, in among those trees."</p>

  <p>The sight of their goal stimulated them to quicken their steps. Soon they
  came to a high flint wall enclosing thickly wooded grounds, and, skirting
  this reached a gate on the landward side. Entering, and advancing along a
  moss-grown path, they presently came in sight of the house, a smallish
  building of cut flint and brick, with the quaint, curved Flemish gables that
  are so characteristic of this part of the world.</p>

  <p>"What a jolly old house!" exclaimed Fittleworth, halting to run his eye
  admiringly over the picturesque building with its time-softened angles and
  its rich clothing of moss, lichen, and house-leek.</p>

  <p>"Sixteen-thirty-one, I see," he added, glancing at the date-tablet over
  the porch, "so it was a nearly new house when Sir Andreas had it."</p>

  <p>He rang the bell, and the door was almost immediately opened by a
  staid-looking middle-aged maidservant, who was evidently expecting them, and
  who greeted Katharine affectionately and cast an interested glance at
  Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Miss Kate," she said, "that Mrs. Matthews is not at home. She
  had to take the young ladies up to town this morning, and she won't be back
  for a week or more; but she left all the keys for you, and this note, and she
  said that you were to make yourself quite at home and do whatever you please.
  There are three gentlemen looking over the place, but they won't be in your
  way."</p>

  <p>At the last sentence, Fittleworth's eyes lighted with a warlike gleam, and
  he glanced at Katharine. "Do you know what these three gentlemen are, Rachel,
  and why they are looking over the place?</p>

  <p>"I heard Mrs. Matthews say, sir, that they are architects, whatever that
  may be. But they are wonderfully interested in the house. They have been
  about the place for more than a week, making sketches of the rooms and
  staircases, drawing plans of the grounds, tapping at the walls, and looking
  up the chimneys. I never saw such goings-on. They spent two whole days in the
  cellars, making sketches, though what they can see in a plain brick cellar
  beats me, sir. They went all round them tapping the walls with a mallet, and
  they even wanted to take up some of the floor, but, of course, Mrs. Matthews
  told them she couldn't allow that without the landlady's permission. Perhaps
  you'd like to see them, miss."</p>

  <p>"Are they here now?" asked Katharine.</p>

  <p>"One of them is--Mr. Simpson. He is in the Chancellor's Parlour, making
  sketches of the wood work."</p>

  <p>Katharine glanced at Fittleworth. "I think we had better see Mr. Simpson,"
  said he; and on this, the maid ushered them through a long corridor to a
  remote wing of the building, where, at a massive door she halted and turned
  the handle.</p>

  <p>"Why, he's bolted himself in!" she exclaimed; and added under her breath,
  as she applied somewhat peremptory knuckles to the door: "Like his
  impudence!"</p>

  <p>The knocking evoked no response, nor was there any answering sound from
  within when it was repeated and reinforced by loud rapping with Fittleworth's
  walking-stick. Rachel listened at the keyhole, and, as still no sound was
  audible, she exclaimed indignantly:</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm sure! It's a pretty state of things when strangers come to bolt
  people out of their own rooms."</p>

  <p>"But," said Fittleworth, "the odd thing is that there doesn't seem to be
  anybody in there. Can we see in through any of the windows?</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir," answered Rachel. "The window looks out on the Chancellor's
  Garden, a little garden closed in by a yew hedge. If you'll follow me, I'll
  show it to you; though, of course, Miss Kate knows the way."</p>

  <p>As they followed the maid out into the grounds, Fittleworth asked: "Why is
  this room called the Chancellor's Parlour?"</p>

  <p>"It is named after the great Lord Clarendon, the head of the family, you
  know," Katharine replied. "The tradition is that he used sometimes to come
  down here for rest and quiet, and that he occupied this wing which is cut off
  from the rest of the house and has its own separate garden. This is the
  garden, and that is the window of the parlour, fortunately not fastened."</p>

  <p>The old-fashioned leaded casement was slightly open, so that Rachel could
  reach in and unhook it from the strut. As she threw it wide open, she
  announced:</p>

  <p>"There's no one in the room, but I can see that the bolt is shot. He must
  have got out of the window. I call that pretty cool, in another person's
  house. And why wasn't the door good enough for him, I should like to
  know?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he didn't want his work disturbed," suggested Fittleworth. "I see
  he has a large drawing on an easel. However, I will step in through the
  window and unbolt the door, while you go round."</p>

  <p>He climbed in easily through the window, and, having unbolted the door
  cast an inquisitive glance at the absent Simpson's arrangements. On a
  sketching-easel was a large drawing board covered with a sheet of Whatman, on
  which was the earliest beginning of a drawing of the carved mantelpiece. A
  table close by bore one or two pencils, a water-colour palette, a jar of
  water, a slab of rubber, and a number of brushes. The drawing--what there was
  of it--was expertly done, but represented, at the most, half an hour's
  work.</p>

  <p>"How long had Mr. Simpson been in this room?" he asked, as Rachel and
  Katharine entered.</p>

  <p>"The three gentlemen came here yesterday and made some sketches, but Mr.
  Simpson didn't bring his things till this morning. He came about nine, and at
  half-past eleven he came to me for a jar of water."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth reflected, with a cogitative eye on the drawing.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said at length, with a glance at Katharine; "I think we can
  manage without Mr. Simpson. As we are here, we may as well begin our survey
  with this room. Don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>Katharine agreed; and when she had explained to the hospitable Rachel that
  they had lunched in the train, the maid said:</p>

  <p>"Then I will leave you now. If you want anything you have only to ring.
  It's an old room, but it has an electric bell. And if I might make a
  suggestion, it would be as well to close the window, so that Mr. Simpson will
  have to come in by the door in a proper and decent way."</p>

  <p>As soon as she was gone, Fittleworth and Katharine looked at one another
  significantly, and the latter exclaimed: "What an extraordinary thing, Joe.
  Do you really think he got out of the window?"</p>

  <p>"I doubt it very much, Katie. But, at any rate, we will adopt Miss
  Rachel's suggestion, and see that he doesn't come back that way; and then we
  will have a good look round."</p>

  <p>He closed and fastened the window, and stood awhile surveying the room. It
  was a smallish apartment, rather barely furnished with five carved walnut
  hairs, an oaken livery cupboard, and a ponderous draw-table with the thick
  foot-rests and massive melon-bulb legs of the period. A wide fireplace with a
  richly-carved mantel, and a door--apparently that of a built-in
  cupboard--were the only constructive features that presented themselves for
  consideration, excepting the panelling, which extended over the whole of the
  walls.</p>

  <p>"There's evidently something queer about Mr. Simpson's proceedings, as we
  might expect," said Fittleworth. "According to Rachel, he was in this room
  from nine o'clock until at least half-past eleven. Now, what was he doing? He
  wasn't drawing. If you look at the work on his board you can see that either
  you or I could have done it in ten minutes. But the handling shows that he is
  not a duffer. Then it being eleven-thirty, he went to the kitchen for a jar
  of water. What did he want that water for? He wasn't going to colour. He had
  barely begun his outline, and there is a good day's drawing in that
  mantelpiece."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Katharine, "that is rather suspicious. It looks as if he had
  gone there to see what the servants were about."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Or to make a demonstration of being at work before he bolted himself
  in. That would suggest that he had already made a discovery. I wonder, by the
  way, what he has in that bag. Would it be improper to look into it?"</p>

  <p>Whether it was improper or not, he did so, and as he opened the flap of
  the large sketching bag, which hung by its strap from a chair back, Katharine
  approached and peered in.</p>

  <p>"That's rather a queer outfit for a water-colour artist," she remarked, as
  he fished out a leather roll-up case of tools.</p>

  <p>"Very quaint," replied Fittleworth. "So is this: what ironmongers describe
  as a case opener, and Mr. Sikes would call a jemmy. And what might this coil
  of rope be for? It is thin stuff--what sailors call a 'lead-line,' I
  think--'but it is too thick for an easel-guy, and there's too much of it.
  There seems to be about a dozen yards. But there! It's of no use looking at
  his appliances; we know what Mr. Simpson was after. The question now is:
  Where is Mr. Simpson?</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Katharine, "he couldn't be in that cupboard?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth stepped across and gave a pull at the projecting key.
  "Locked," he announced. "He couldn't very well have locked himself in and
  left the key outside. I wonder if there is anything to be seen in the
  chimney. These wide old chimneys were favourite places for hiding-holes."</p>

  <p>He slid the old dog grate out of the way, and, stooping under the lintel,
  stood up inside the roomy chimney. It was evident that the flue was not
  straight, for no light came from above, and, as very little light was
  reflected up from the floor, the cavity was in almost total darkness.
  Fittleworth struck a wax match, and, by the aid of its feeble light, explored
  that part of the interior that was within the range of vision. But closely as
  he examined it, nothing met his eye but the uninterrupted surface of
  blackened brickwork. Reflecting, however, that hiding-holes would not be made
  ostentatiously conspicuous, he stooped, and, reaching out to the andirons,
  picked up the poker.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to hit him with that poker, I hope, Joe," laughed
  Katharine, who had unlocked the cupboard, and was now standing with the open
  door in her hand. Fittleworth reassured her as to his intentions, and,
  ducking under the lintel, stood up once more in the dark chimney. Having lit
  another match he began systematically to sound the brick work, comparing
  critically the notes given out by the successive blows of the poker, and
  noting the resistance and feeling of solidity. But the result was no more
  encouraging than that of the ocular inspection; the "percussion note"
  exhibited a disappointing uniformity, and the sense of resistance conveyed
  through the poker was that of a very solid brick wall.</p>

  <p>He had been working several minutes, his attention concentrated on the
  unresponsive mass of brickwork, when he was startled by the slamming of a
  door. He stopped to listen, and then, after a brief interval, he was aware of
  a muffled cry and the sound of thumping on hollow woodwork. Instantly he
  stooped to look out, blinking at the unaccustomed light, and as he looked he
  uttered a cry of amazement.</p>

  <p>The room was empty.</p>

  <p>He sprang out across the hearth, and as he reached the floor the muffled
  call was repeated in a familiar voice, framing the word "Joe!" and the
  thumping recommenced, both sounds clearly proceeding from the cupboard.
  Striding across to the latter, he seized the key and pulled at it vigorously,
  but the door refused to yield. Then he gave the key a turn, where upon the
  lock clicked, the door flew open, and out stepped Katharine, laughing
  heartily, and yet not a little agitated.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear Joe!" she exclaimed, "that wretched door gave me such a
  fright. I believe it is possessed with a devil. It seemed to entrap me with
  intelligent, calculating malice."</p>

  <p>"Tell me exactly what happened," said Fittleworth. "How did you get in
  there?"</p>

  <p>"I walked in, of course, you old absurdity. You see, while you were
  rummaging about in the chimney, I stood here with the door open, looking at
  all that clutter on the shelves. Then my eye caught that delightful old jar
  on the top shelf, and I stepped in to reach it down; but no sooner was I
  inside than that miserable door slammed to, and the wretched lock snapped,
  and there I was, like a mouse in a trap. It's a mercy you were at hand."</p>

  <p>"It is, indeed. But now that we've got you out, I think we will have a
  good look at that trap. It's a queer arrangement for a cupboard. It has a
  spring lock, and you notice that the very solid brass hinges are of the skew
  pattern to make the door self-closing. I don't see any reason for
  either."</p>

  <p>"No; that was what I was thinking when I was inside. You want to keep
  people out of a cupboard, not to fasten them in."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. So we will just prop this door open with a chair and examine
  this singular cupboard, or closet, minutely."</p>

  <p>He pulled the door wide open, and, having fixed it in that position by
  means of an elbow chair, began his investigations, taking the door itself as
  the first item. Having tried the lock and examined the exterior, he ran his
  eye critically over the inner surface, and then he made a discovery. Near the
  top of the door was a small, square patch of wood, which yielded to pressure,
  and on pressing which the bolt of the lock slid back.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, "I smell a fox, Katie. Do you see? This is an internal
  release. Now what could that be for?</p>

  <p>"Why, obviously, to enable a person who was shut in to let himself out. It
  is a hiding-place, Joe. Don't you see? A fugitive who was closely pursued
  could step in and the door would shut behind him. Then the pursuers would
  come and give a pull at the key, and say, as you did, that a man couldn't
  lock himself in a cupboard and leave the key outside. And then they'd go
  away."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth smiled, and shook his head. "That is all very well, my dear
  girl, but suppose there happened to be a Katie among them who would have the
  curiosity to turn the key and open the door? That wouldn't do. No, my dear,
  you may take it as practically certain that there is a way out of this
  cupboard. Your inquisitive pursuer would open the door and find the cupboard
  empty, and then the outside key would be highly convincing. Let us
  investigate."</p>

  <p>He stepped into the cupboard which was about four feet deep and of which
  the back was occupied by five massive but rather narrow shelves, and looked
  inquisitively around. The whole interior--sides, floor and ceiling--was lined
  with solid oak boards, and the shelves were occupied by various articles
  that, to judge by their appearance, had slowly accumulated in the course of
  years. It was to these shelves that Fittleworth specially directed his
  attention and that Katharine.</p>

  <p>"You notice," said he, "that all the shelves are more or less filled up
  with what you call 'clutter,' excepting the second one from the top, which
  has evidently been cleared, and quite recently, too, as you can see by the
  dust marks. Also that the back boarding has a hollow space behind it."</p>

  <p>By way of demonstrating this, he gave one or two noisy thumps on the
  hollow-sounding back; but at the third blow he paused and turned excitedly to
  Katharine.</p>

  <p>"We've hit it--literally--Kate. Do you see? This board is beginning to
  give. It is a hinged flap, of which the joints were hidden by the shelves.
  We'll soon run Mr. Simpson to earth now."</p>

  <p>As Katharine craned forward to peer into the cupboard, Fittleworth gave a
  vigorous shove at the movable board, driving it back several inches.
  Instantly there followed a loud snap and a thunderous rumbling, and the
  entire cupboard began to descend rapidly. Fittleworth clutched frantically at
  the shelf to steady himself, while Katharine, with a little cry of alarm,
  leaned over the brink of the well-like shaft, looking down, as if petrified,
  at her vanishing companion.</p>

  <p>The cupboard continued to descend for about ten feet. Then it stopped,
  and, at the same moment, the bottom fell down, swinging like a trap-door on
  invisible hinges. It was well for Fittleworth that he had kept his grasp of
  the shelf, for otherwise he must have been precipitated down the shaft that
  yawned beneath him, a dark, apparently unfathomable, well. As it was, he had
  nearly been jerked from his none too secure hold, and he now hung by his
  hands, only his feet kicking in mid-air; an impossible position for more than
  a bare minute, as he realised at once from the strain on his fingers.
  However, after some cautious groping with one foot he managed to find the
  bottom shelf, and when he had got both his feet securely planted on this, the
  strain on his hands was relieved and he was able to look about him. Glancing
  up, he saw that only the back half of the cupboard ceiling had come down, so
  that there was a two-foot space above him, through which he could see the
  agonised face of Katharine thrust over the brink of the well.</p>

  <p>"Can't I do anything, Joe?" she cried in a terrified voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "Get that rope of Simpson's and throw one end down to
  me and tie the other end securely to the leg of the table."</p>

  <p>Her face disappeared, and, as the sound of hurried movement came from
  above, Fittleworth looked over his shoulder at the side of the well that was
  visible to him; which presented the smooth surface of the chalk through which
  the shaft had been cut, and at its middle a shallow recess fitted with
  massive iron rings, and forming a fixed ladder, which apparently gave access
  to the bottom of the shaft. He looked longingly at those solid rungs, rusty
  as they were, and considered whether he could reach across and grasp one, but
  his hold was too insecure to allow of his reaching out with that horrible
  dark pit, of unknown depth, yawning beneath. There was nothing for it but to
  cling to the shelf, though his fingers ached with the tension and his muscles
  were beginning to tremble with the continuous strain. He gazed up at the
  narrow opening, and listened eagerly for the sounds from above that told him
  of Katharine's hurried efforts to rescue him; and as he listened, there came
  to his ears another sound--from beneath--a hollow, sepulchral voice, echoing
  strangely from the sides of the shaft.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Warren?"</p>

  <p>"All right," answered Fittleworth. "We'll get down to you presently. Are
  you hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; broken my ankle, I think. But don't you hurry. Be careful how you
  come down."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth was about to reply, when Katharine's face reappeared at the
  opening above. "Here's the rope, Joe," said she. "I've tied it quite firmly
  to the table leg, and I shall keep hold of it as well. Catch."</p>

  <p>The rope came rattling down the shalt, and, as Katharine dexterously swung
  it towards him, Fittleworth caught it with one hand, and hauled on it as well
  as he could in the hope that the cupboard, partly relieved of his weight,
  would rise. But the force that he could exert with one hand was not enough
  for this. Pull as he might, the cupboard remained immovable.</p>

  <p>Finding that this was so, and that the repeated efforts were only
  fatiguing him, he decided to risk grasping the rope with both hands; but the
  instant he let go his hold on the upper shelf he swung right out over the
  well, and his feet began to slip from the lower shelf. In another moment he
  would have been dangling free over the deep chasm--unless the thin rope had
  broken; but now, as he swung out within reach of the ladder, he made a snatch
  with one hand at an iron rung. Grasping this firmly, he was able, without
  difficulty, to spring across on to the ladder, and, as his feet finally left
  the shelf, the cupboard began, with loud rumblings, to ascend.</p>

  <p>Fittleworth stood on the ladder looking up at the receding cupboard and at
  Katharine's anxious face, and wondering what would happen next. His curiosity
  was soon satisfied. As the cupboard approached the top of the shaft, the
  floor began to rise, and would have closed completely but for the rope, on
  which it jammed, leaving a narrow chink through which came a glimmer of
  light. It was an awkward predicament, and Fittleworth was doubtful what to
  do; but, as he was considering, Katharine's voice came through the chink.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right, Joe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You had better go down a little farther out of the way. The cupboard is
  coming down again."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth hastily descended a few rungs to avoid a knock on the head and
  then stopped, wondering how Katharine proposed to send the cupboard down.
  Before he had reached any conclusion, the rope was smartly drawn up, there
  was a jarring sound above and the cupboard began to descend, but more slowly
  this time, as if checked in some way. When it had descended a few feet, the
  floor, not having risen far enough to reach its catch, owing to the rope,
  began to fall down; and then Fittleworth, looking up, saw to his amazement
  that Katharine was clinging to the interior. As the cupboard reached the
  bottom of its run and came to rest, he climbed up the ladder until he was
  opposite and then looked round anxiously. But Katharine's position was much
  more secure than his had been, for she was holding firmly with one hand to a
  massive brass peg that was fixed on the side of the cupboard, and with the
  other was grasping the rope which she had passed round a stout hook that was
  fixed near the floor--apparently for that very purpose--and then round the
  peg; thus she had been able easily to check the descent of the cupboard.
  These arrangements, however, Fittleworth was not able to see in the dim light
  which prevailed in the shaft, and remembering his own difficulties, he looked
  at Katharine in some consternation.</p>

  <p>"How on earth are we going to get you up again, Katie?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why," she replied, "you just run up the ladder and pull at the rope. I've
  got it firmly fixed to this hook."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth crawled up a few rungs and gave a cautious pull at the rope,
  when the cupboard moved an inch or two upwards, whereupon he began to climb
  rapidly up the ladder. He was only hall-way up, how ever, when a hollow voice
  from below echoed appealingly.</p>

  <p>"Don't be longer than you can help, Warren."</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens!" exclaimed Katharine. "What on earth was that?"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Fittleworth. "That's our friend Simpson." Then, raising his
  voice, he called out: "We'll come down to you as soon as we can," and
  continued his ascent to the top of the ladder.</p>

  <p>As soon as he reached the solid floor of the room, he seized the rope and
  began cautiously to haul on it; and as the tension increased, the great
  bronze chain which suspended the cupboard began to rumble over its
  pulley-wheel. In a few seconds the cupboard itself appeared in the opening;
  as its floor came flush with that of the room it stopped, and a double snap
  announced that the two catches--the one which supported the cupboard itself
  and the other which held the floor--had slipped into their places. Then
  Katharine, having tried the floor with infinite caution, let go the peg and
  stepped out into the room.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Fittleworth as he handed her out, "I'm proud of you, Katie.
  It was positively heroic of you to come down for me in that way; and how
  cleverly you managed it, too. It's not for nothing that you are a yachtsman's
  daughter."</p>

  <p>Katharine received these commendations with calm satisfaction, but her
  mind was evidently running on the unearthly voice that had hailed them from
  the depths, for she asked anxiously:</p>

  <p>"How are we going to get that poor creature up, Joe?"</p>

  <p>"We will consider that presently," replied Fittleworth. "Meanwhile, we
  will just put away the rope and make things ship-shape while we talk matters
  over."</p>

  <p>"But," persisted Katharine, "we can't leave the poor wretch down there in
  that horrible pit. Can't we get him up now?"</p>

  <p>"I think he'll have to stay there until we've settled what to do. We shall
  want some further appliances, and probably some help. But listen!"</p>

  <p>He coiled up the rope quickly and had just replaced it in Simpson's bag,
  when the door opened and Rachel reappeared.</p>

  <p>"If you please, miss," said she, "the two gentlemen, Mr. Furse and Mr.
  Tanner, have come to look for Mr. Simpson. I told them what had happened, and
  that you were here. Will you see them, miss? They're in a most awful taking
  about Mr. Simpson."</p>

  <p>As she finished speaking, footsteps were heard in the corridor and the two
  gentlemen entered without further ceremony, upon which Rachel introduced
  them, somewhat stiffly, and departed. Fittleworth looked at the two strangers
  curiously and had no difficulty in recognising in them the hautboy player and
  the water-colour copyist respectively, though it was clear that neither of
  them recognised him. Both were in, a state of great agitation, especially the
  musician, and it was he who addressed Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"This is a most astonishing and alarming thing, sir. Our friend Simpson
  appears to have vanished completely."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Fittleworth, "a most surprising affair. I can't imagine why
  he should have gone out through the window."</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure that he did?" asked the musician.</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Fittleworth, "he's not here, as you see, and he couldn't
  have got out through the door, so he must have left by the window, unless he
  went up the chimney."</p>

  <p>Here Fittleworth caught a reproachful glance from Katharine, and the
  musician, who had been introduced as Mr. Furse, rejoined: "I can't help
  thinking that he must be somewhere on the premises. Would you object to our
  looking round?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth reflected awhile and ultimately ventured on a chance shot. "I
  think, perhaps, you may be right, Mr. Warren--"</p>

  <p>The two men started visibly, and the musician interrupted: "My name, sir,
  is Furse."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Fittleworth, "Mr. Furse, then I think we had better have
  an explanation, as our activities overlap somewhat. I am acting on behalf of
  Miss Hyde, the owner of this house."</p>

  <p>"But what has that to do with us?" asked Mr. Furse.</p>

  <p>"I think you will see when I explain my business, which is connected with
  certain property of Miss Hyde's, to wit, a small gold box, containing certain
  documents, relating to some of her other property."</p>

  <p>For some seconds the two men stared at Fittleworth in speechless
  amazement; then Furse asked hesitatingly: "But what has this to do with
  us?</p>

  <p>"Oh, come, come, sir," said Fittleworth impatiently, "it's of no use to
  try to keep up this pretence. We know that you took the box and that it is in
  your possession at this moment."</p>

  <p>The two men, who appeared completely dumbfounded, glanced quickly at one
  another, and Furse asked: "Do I understand that this box, of which you are
  speaking, is the property of this lady?</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Fittleworth. "This is Miss Katharine Hyde, the heir
  and only surviving descendant of Sir Andreas Hyde, whose name will be
  familiar to you."</p>

  <p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed Mr. Furse. "I had no idea there were any
  descendants living. Perhaps you will allow my friend and me to consult
  together on the matter."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth was quite ready to agree to this, but he had no intention of
  leaving them alone in the room. Accordingly, he suggested the Chancellor's
  Garden as a retired spot where they could converse at their ease, and
  proceeded to usher them out by the side door. Returning to the parlour, he
  found Katharine with the cupboard door open, listening intently for any
  sounds which might come up through the floor.</p>

  <p>"You cold-blooded old wretch, Joe!" she exclaimed, "to sit there calmly
  discussing that trumpery box, while poor Mr. Simpson may be dying at the
  bottom of that horrible shaft."</p>

  <p>"My dear Kate," protested Fittleworth, "we didn't put him there. He shall
  be got up as soon as possible, but, meanwhile, it is quite a valuable aid to
  our negotiations."</p>

  <p>Katharine was shocked at his callousness and urged an immediate rescue,
  but Fittleworth, unmoved by her reproaches, calmly watched the two men
  through the window, as they paced the little green, evidently engaged in
  anxious discussion. The discussion was, however, quite a brief one, for in
  about a couple of minutes they turned, with an air of finality, and walked
  briskly towards the side door.</p>

  <p>"They haven't been long," Fittleworth remarked as they passed out of view
  and the side door was heard to open. "I wonder what they've decided to do?
  They can't very well say they haven't got the box now."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth was right. As soon as the two men entered the room, Mr. Furse
  opened the proceedings in a manner quite frank and business-like.</p>

  <p>"We'd like you to tell us, sir," said he, "exactly what you know about
  this affair and what you wish us to do."</p>

  <p>"As to what we know," said Fittleworth, "I may say we know everything. The
  box, which was sealed with King James' seal and contained an important
  document, was removed by you--very cleverly, I must admit--from the National
  Gallery seventeen days ago, and you have come here to search for the property
  that was deposited by Sir Andreas Hyde. As to what we wish, we simply desire
  you to restore the box to its owner."</p>

  <p>Mr. Furse seated himself in a large elbow-chair and, placing his
  finger-tips together, addressed himself to Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"Now, see here," said he. "That box was never in Miss Hyde's possession,
  and I guess no one knew of its existence, or of the existence of the other
  property that you mention; and I guess you don't know, now, what that
  property is or where it's stowed."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong there," said Fittleworth, rather casuistically; "we know
  exactly where it's hidden, which is, I think, more than you do; but surely,
  all this is irrelevant. The property belongs to Miss Hyde and there's an end
  of the matter. You're not disputing her title, are you?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, we are not. To be perfectly frank with you, our position is
  this: we lit on the trail of this property by chance, and, being under the
  impression that it was without an owner, we laid ourselves out to salve it,
  and I may tell you that we have spent a great deal of time, money and trouble
  on locating it. Now, it turns out that this is not treasure trove at all;
  that there is a rightful owner living; and my friend, Tanner, and I have
  talked the matter over and have decided that we, personally, are prepared to
  surrender our claim on certain conditions, but of course we can't answer for
  Mr. Simpson, nor can we act without his consent."</p>

  <p>"What are your conditions?" asked Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"We should want our expenses refunded, and we want permission to search
  these premises for our friend."</p>

  <p>"That's not unreasonable," said Fittleworth, "and as regards the property
  of Sir Andreas, I am willing to agree; but I must stipulate that you hand us
  over immediately the box and its contents. You have them with you,
  probably."</p>

  <p>"No, we haven't," said Furse. "We could produce them, but, first of all,
  we want to look for Simpson. His case is actually urgent, for the probability
  is that he has got boxed up in some confounded secret chamber and can't get
  out."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right," said Fittleworth. "I know exactly where he is, and
  I will make conditions with you. You produce the box and its contents, and I
  will produce Mr. Simpson."</p>

  <p>"And supposing we don't agree?" asked Furse.</p>

  <p>"Then I am afraid we shall have to retain Mr. Simpson as security."</p>

  <p>The long, humorous face of Mr. Furse wrinkled into a grim smile, as he
  glanced inquiringly at his companion.</p>

  <p>"What do you say to that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tanner raised his eyebrows. "It seems to me, Warren," said he, "that
  this gentleman has got us in a cleft stick. I guess we've got to agree."</p>

  <p>Mr. Furse rose and looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"It'll take us well over an hour to produce that box. Say we are back here
  in an hour and a half?"</p>

  <p>"Then," said Fittleworth, "I think we can promise that you shall find Mr.
  Simpson here when you return."</p>

  <p>This arrangement having been agreed to, the two gentlemen departed,
  Fittleworth and Katharine escorting them to the front door. As they
  disappeared down the drive, the former turned to Katharine:</p>

  <p>"Now, my dear, to the work of rescue. I think we shall have to take Rachel
  into our confidence, as we shall want her assistance."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Rachel was lurking in the background, having scented
  some sort of mystery, and Fittleworth forthwith put her in possession of such
  of the circumstances as it was necessary for her to know; whereat she was
  profoundly thrilled and highly gratified.</p>

  <p>"There, now," she remarked, "that's what comes of poking and prying about
  in other people's houses. But how are you going to get him out, sir?"</p>

  <p>"He'll have to be hoisted up, I suppose," said Fittleworth. "Do you happen
  to have such a thing as a length of strong rope?"</p>

  <p>He asked the question somewhat hopelessly, stout rope not being a common
  domestic appliance; but Rachel answered promptly: "There's the well rope,
  sir, if you could get it off the windlass."</p>

  <p>"I think we could manage that," said Fittleworth; "and then we shall want
  some weights, about two hundredweight altogether."</p>

  <p>This presented more difficulty, until Katharine conceived the luminous
  idea of filling a couple of small sacks with earth, which solved the problem
  perfectly.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes they had collected these appliances and a lantern, and
  carried them to the Chancellor's Parlour, when, having bolted the door, they
  fell to work forthwith. First, the door of the cupboard was propped open with
  a chair; then Fittleworth laid the two small, but heavy, sacks of earth on
  the bottom shelf, and, the cupboard now being weighted, he set the point of
  his walking-stick against the movable board at the back, and gave a heavy
  thrust. Instantly there was a loud snap and the cupboard rumbled away down
  the shaft, like a primitive lift, and as the great bronze chain ran out, an
  enormous stone counterpoise was seen to rise at the side. As on the first
  occasion, the cupboard stopped about ten feet down and the floor dropped like
  the trap of a gallows. The next proceeding was to light the lantern and
  attach it to one end of the rope--the other end being secured, as before, to
  the table--by which Fittleworth lowered it carefully down the shaft until he
  had paid out some twenty-five feet. Then as its glimmer still showed nothing
  but the walls of the shaft, and the view was somewhat obstructed by the
  cupboard, he decided to go down and reconnoitre.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that ladder's all right?" said Katharine.</p>

  <p>"It seems to be," he answered. "The rungs are rusty, but they seem quite
  firm and strong, and you may trust me to be mighty careful."</p>

  <p>With this, he let himself over the brink and began slowly to descend,
  watched anxiously by the two women from above, testing each rung cautiously
  with his foot before throwing his weight on it. As he passed the suspended
  cupboard the voice of Simpson from below hailed him with the inquiry:</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Warren?"</p>

  <p>"No," answered Fittleworth, and continued to descend.</p>

  <p>"Is it Bell?" asked Simpson.</p>

  <p>Fittleworth again replied in the negative, but made a mental note of the
  name. As he passed the lantern he saw that it had descended to within six or
  seven feet from the bottom of the shaft, which was covered by a considerable
  heap of ancient rags and mouldering straw and twigs, thrown down apparently,
  by some humane person to mitigate the effects of an accidental fall. At one
  side was a narrow doorway, cut in the chalk, opening upon a short flight of
  steps, and on the top step a man was sitting, nursing his bare foot.</p>

  <p>It was a curious meeting. The light of the lantern reflected from the
  walls of the narrow cavity, rendered the two men plainly visible to one
  another, and the recognition was instantaneous. Fittleworth, of course,
  "placed" his man without difficulty, but the other was evidently at a
  loss.</p>

  <p>"I seem to know your face," he said, looking critically at Fittleworth;
  "but yet--where have I met you?"</p>

  <p>"In the National Gallery," Fittleworth replied; and as the other's face
  took on an expression of unmistakable alarm, he added: "I've not come with
  hostile intentions. We will talk over our little business later; for the
  present we have to consider how to get you out of this hole."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," said Simpson, "that I can't climb the ladder.'</p>

  <p>"No, of course you can't," replied Fittleworth, "we shall have to haul you
  up. But if I fix you in a loop at the end of the rope, you can help us by
  hauling yourself up with your hands. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>Simpson thought the plan would answer admirably, and Fittleworth forthwith
  set about executing it. First, he called up to Katharine to lower a dozen
  feet more rope. Then, detaching the lantern from the end of the rope, he made
  a good-sized bowline knot in the latter, and fitted the loop round Simpson's
  hips.</p>

  <p>"There," said he, "I will go up now and help them to hoist, and, when I
  give the word, you take hold of the ladder and sit down in the loop of the
  rope. As we haul, you must help yourself up by the ladder, and be careful
  that you don't knock that unfortunate foot of yours, which we must have
  attended to as soon as we get you up."</p>

  <p>"It's very good of you," Simpson began; but Fittleworth, considering that
  this was no time for the exchange of politenesses, began to re-ascend the
  ladder. As he stepped out on to the floor of the parlour, he briefly
  explained the arrangements to his two assistants, and then, having shouted
  down a warning to the prisoner below, the three began to haul steadily at the
  rope. It was probably an uncomfortable experience to Simpson, but the plan
  was highly effective, and in a minute or so the captive appeared at the top
  of the shaft, and was tenderly helped over the perilous edge.</p>

  <p>As he stood on one foot, supported by Fittleworth, he gazed confusedly
  about the room, and asked:</p>

  <p>"Where are the others? Warren and Bell, I mean."</p>

  <p>"They've gone into Margate," replied Fittleworth, "but they'll be back
  shortly. Meanwhile, if Mistress Rachel can lend us a bedroom, we will see you
  comfortably settled, and send for a doctor."</p>

  <p>"There's a spare bedroom over this," said Rachel, "and, as it's all ready,
  we can take Mr. Simpson up at once, and then the boy can go off on his
  bicycle and fetch Dr. Finlay."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure," said Simpson, "it's exceedingly charitable of you all to take
  so much trouble about me. It's more than I deserve, after--" he paused to
  look doubtfully at Rachel, who, for her part, looked as expressionless as a
  moderately benevolent graven image, and was equally uncommunicative.</p>

  <p>"For the present," said Fittleworth, "we'll confine our attention to your
  foot. When that has been attended to, and your friends arrive, we can discuss
  other matters."</p>

  <p>As soon as Simpson had been comfortably settled in the cosy, old-fashioned
  bedroom, with a wet handkerchief applied to his ankle, the party returned to
  the Chancellor's Parlour.</p>

  <p>"Well," asked Katharine, "what is the next thing to be done?"</p>

  <p>"The next thing," said Fittleworth, "is to make a little exploration on
  our own account. There is evidently a chamber or tunnel at the bottom of the
  shaft, and I propose to go down and see what's in it."</p>

  <p>"Then I'm coming down, too," said Katharine.</p>

  <p>At this Rachel protested most emphatically. "You'd much better not, miss,"
  she exclaimed. "Supposing you were to fall off the ladder!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to suppose anything of the kind, Rachel. You'll let me come
  down, won't you, Joe?" she added wheedlingly.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you shouldn't," replied Fittleworth, "it's quite an easy
  ladder to climb. But we shall want Rachel to keep guard at the top, as we do
  not want those two good gentlemen; so the housemaid had better be told that,
  if they arrive before we have finished our explorations, they are to be shown
  up to Mr. Simpson's room, and are to wait there for us."</p>

  <p>The disapproving, but obedient, Rachel received the instructions with
  resignation, and, having executed them and bolted the door, took her place at
  the edge of the shaft with an expression of deep foreboding. First, the rope
  was lowered to its former position, when Fittleworth, steadying himself by
  it, got on the ladder and descended a few rungs; then Katharine, also
  grasping the rope and herself frantically grasped by Rachel, essayed the
  first few perilous steps.</p>

  <p>"It's really quite safe and easy, Rachel," she said, as she clung
  tenaciously to the rusty bars and let herself down cautiously, rung by rung;
  and, with this assurance, the faithful handmaid was somewhat comforted,
  though she continued to watch the disappearance of her young mistress into
  the depths of the shaft with a face of horror and dismay.</p>

  <p>The progress down the ladder occupied little more than a minute, and its
  completion was duly announced for the benefit of the watcher above.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Katharine, as Fittleworth picked up the lantern, "that
  you didn't see anything of the mysterious 'it' when you were down here
  before?</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "we are going to find 'it' together, Katie; at least, I
  hope so. Be careful of those steps."</p>

  <p>They descended the rudely cut steps, rounded by the damp and slimy with
  fungous growths, and entered a narrow passage, of which the end was lost in
  obscurity, and of which the floor descended at a sharp angle. Fittleworth
  held the lantern aloft, throwing its light on the greenish, sweating wails
  and the roughly-vaulted roof. There was something weirdly impressive in the
  aspect of this ancient tunnel, which had probably seen no light for centuries
  but that which now glimmered from the lantern. The lapse of time was marked
  not only by that eerie vegetation that clothed the wails, but by little
  stalactites that drooped from projections on the roof, and sparkling
  stalagmitic masses which had begun to grow up from the floor. But of traces
  of visitors there were none, excepting that, in one place, under the mantle
  of vegetation there could be seen on the wail some indistinct initials with a
  heart and the date 1594. Slowly the explorers advanced down the sloping
  tunnel, descending at intervals short flights of steps, which were placed at
  points where the direction of the tunnel changed, and still there was no sign
  of any concealed object or of any hiding-place. At length, on descending
  another short flight of steps, they turned into a straight length of tunnel,
  at the end of which appeared a bright spot of light, cold and bluish in tone
  as compared with the yellow glimmer of the lantern--evidently daylight. They
  hurried forward, and, passing a massive wooden gate, which had fallen back on
  its decayed hinges, came to a roughly-built wall of chalk masonry which
  blocked the tunnel. The spot of light corresponded to a space from which one
  of the stones had fallen or crumbled, and Fittleworth had no difficulty in
  climbing up and applying his eye to the hole.</p>

  <p>"What are you smiling at, Joe?" Katharine asked, as a faint grin appeared
  on Fittleworth's face.</p>

  <p>His reply was to descend and assist her to take his place. It was a very
  curious scene that she looked upon as she peered through the opening; curious
  by reason of the contrast that it offered with this grim, old tunnel, wrapt
  in sepulchral darkness and charged with mystery and memories of a generation
  long since dead and forgotten. A sea cave with a floor of weed strewn sand
  and the shining beach beyond; and near its entrance a pair of very modern
  lovers, the swain industriously carving their joint initials with a very
  conspicuous heart, while the maiden stood by and encouraged him with admiring
  exclamations.</p>

  <p>"So," said Fittleworth, as Katharine stepped down, "the world wags pretty
  much in our days as it did in the year 1594. But, meanwhile, we seem to be at
  the end of our explorations, and 'it' still remains an unknown quantity. I
  wish I hadn't been so beastly cocksure with Warren, now."</p>

  <p>"But it must be hidden here, somewhere in this tunnel," said
  Katharine.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't follow at all. The purpose of these works is pretty obvious,
  especially when we consider that the tunnel was cut at least as early as the
  time of Elizabeth. They form a combined escape and death trap. You see that
  we are looking in near the roof of the cave, and this wall is probably built
  over a flight of steps. The idea clearly was that a Catholic, or Protestant,
  as the case might be, could escape down the shaft and out through the cave to
  a boat. If the pursuers discovered the secret of the cupboard, they would
  probably be shot down the shaft and killed; and even if they came down the
  ladder, they could be ambushed at any one of these sharp turns in the
  tunnel."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Katharine, in a tone of disappointment, "you think that 'it'
  may be hidden in some other part of the house?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that's what it looks like," replied Fittleworth, "and, as we
  don't know what 'it' is, or what its size may be, the search for it isn't so
  very hopeful."</p>

  <p>They turned and retraced their steps slowly through the zigzag tunnel and,
  as they went, they spoke little and apparently thought much. Arrived at the
  foot of the shaft, Fittleworth, with a reflective air, tied the lantern to
  the end of the rope, and called out to Rachel to pull it up to the level of
  the cupboard. Then they began the ascent, Katharine going first.</p>

  <p>When they reached the level of the cupboard, Fittleworth paused and looked
  round.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, Katie," said he. "I'm going to try a little
  experiment."</p>

  <p>Katharine stopped in her climb and, looking-down on him inquisitively, saw
  him reach across and grasp one of the bags of earth. A good pull dislodged it
  from the shelf and it fell to the bottom of the shaft with a dull thump.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, Joe!" exclaimed Katharine. "You'll have the cupboard going up
  and shutting us in."</p>

  <p>"I want it to go up a little way," he replied; and descending a couple of
  rungs, he put his hand to the bottom of the cupboard and pushed steadily
  upwards; when the cupboard, relieved of a portion of its weight, rose three
  or four feet and again came to rest.</p>

  <p>"Eureka!" Fittleworth exclaimed excitedly. "I was right. I thought our
  secretive friends would not waste such an excellent opportunity."</p>

  <p>He followed the cupboard up a few steps and, giving it another shove, sent
  it up a good six feet. Katharine gave a little cry of delight. In the side of
  the shaft, at the spot that had been hidden by the suspended cupboard, was a
  deepish recess, fitted with iron hand-holds, and pierced by a narrow doorway.
  Grasping one of the hand-holds, Fittleworth stepped on the ledge of the
  recess and entered the doorway.</p>

  <p>"You're not to go in without me," Katharine commanded, letting herself
  down in a mighty hurry.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Fittleworth. "Pass me the lantern across, and get a good
  hold of that handle before you step on the ledge."</p>

  <p>He took the lantern from her and, backing into the doorway, watched her
  anxiously as she crossed to the ledge. The perilous passage accomplished, he
  backed into the doorway with the lantern, and she followed him into a short
  passage, and from this, into a small, square chamber. As he turned and held
  the lantern aloft they both uttered an exclamation of joy; for a single
  glance around the little cell, showed them that they had found the object of
  their quest. On the floor, near to one wall, raised from the damp surface on
  blocks of cut chalk, were three rudely-made chests, clamped with iron bands
  and guarded by massive locks. Fittleworth threw the light of the lantern on
  each in succession. All of them were roughly fashioned, as if by a ship's
  carpenter, and each bore on the lid, in incised lettering, the same
  inscription: "Shipp, James and Mary. Stowe in ye lazaret"; and then in dotted
  lettering, as if marked with an awl or marline spike, "His Majesty's Portion,
  W.P."</p>

  <p>"'W.P.,'" mused Fittleworth. "That would be Sir William Phips, whoever he
  was. Now, the question is, whose property is this? It's His Majesty's
  portion, but did the king hand it to Sir Andreas as a gift, or only to hold
  in trust for safe keeping?"</p>

  <p>"Does it matter?" inquired Katharine, with feminine disregard for these
  niceties.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it does," replied Fittleworth. "If it belonged to Sir Andreas, it is
  your property, but if it was the king's, it's treasure trove."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" exclaimed Katharine. "King James' family is extinct, so there's
  no question about his heirs; and finding is keeping. Besides, it's in my
  house and was put here by my ancestor."</p>

  <p>"You're a dishonest little baggage!" laughed Fittleworth, whose private
  opinions, however, on the moral aspects of treasure trove were much the same
  as those of most other sensible men, "but perhaps the document may give us
  some further information. At any rate, it is satisfactory to have found 'it'
  ourselves. And now we had better go up and see if our understudies have
  arrived yet."</p>

  <p>He helped Katharine across to the ladder and, as they emerged from the
  shaft, to Rachel's unspeakable relief, the front door bell rang.</p>

  <p>"That'll be Mr. Furse and his friend," remarked Rachel. "The doctor has
  been and gone away again."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Fittleworth, "they had better be shown up to Mr. Simpson's
  room, and, when they are ready to see us, perhaps you will kindly let us
  know."</p>

  <p>He closed the door of the cupboard, and, as Rachel departed on her
  mission, he drew two chairs up to the table.</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I want to say to you," said Katharine. "Of course we
  have found this property, whatever it is, ourselves, but we should never have
  found it if it had not been for those three men. They are the real
  discoverers."</p>

  <p>Fittleworth assented somewhat dryly, and Katharine went on: "They've had
  an awful lot of trouble, Joe, and they've been most clever and ingenious, and
  when we broke in upon them they were on the very point of winning the reward
  for all their labour."</p>

  <p>"They hadn't found the hiding-place," objected Fittleworth.</p>

  <p>"No, but I feel sure they would have found it. They are evidently
  exceedingly clever men--almost as clever as you, Joe."</p>

  <p>"Rather more so, I should say," laughed Fittleworth. "They did me in the
  eye pretty neatly."</p>

  <p>"Well, at any rate," said Katharine, ignoring this, "they discovered it by
  sheer cleverness, did by taking infinite trouble, and it will be an awful
  disappointment to the poor things to have it snatched from them at the last
  moment."</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Fittleworth, as Katharine paused interrogatively.</p>

  <p>"Well, don't you think we ought to let them have at least a substantial
  share of whatever is in those chests?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth smiled grimly. "It's a most irregular business altogether,
  Katie. In the first place, I, an official of the Gallery, propose to compound
  a felony by receiving the stolen property, which I fancy we are not going to
  restore to the owner of the picture."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said Katharine. "It wasn't his. It's mine."</p>

  <p>"And then," continued Fittleworth, "we propose to make a perfectly illegal
  arrangement with the robbers for disposing of certain treasure trove which is
  the property of the Crown."</p>

  <p>"Oh, stuff, Joe!" exclaimed Katharine. "It's my property, or at least
  ours, and we're going to keep it, you know we are. Now, how much are we going
  to give these poor creatures?"</p>

  <p>"It's your property, Kate," said Fittleworth, with a grin; "at least, you
  say it is, so you must decide."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said she, "let us consider. There are three chests, one for
  you, one for me and one for them. What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth, though secretly approving, was disposed to adopt the
  cantankerous attitude of a trustee or adviser; but Katharine saw through him
  at once.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you agree with me," she said, ignoring his protests. "We shall
  enjoy our windfall so much more if we're not greedy. So that's settled. And I
  think I hear Rachel coming."</p>

  <p>A moment later the handmaid entered to announce that Mr. Furse and his
  friends were ready to see them, and they adjourned, forthwith, to the bedroom
  above.</p>

  <p>"I hope," said Katharine, as they entered, "that the doctor has given a
  favourable report, and that you are in less pain now, Mr. Simpson."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," was the reply, "I am quite comfortable now. It seems that it
  was only a severe sprain, after all."</p>

  <p>Katharine congratulated him on his escape, and Mr. Furse--or Warren--then
  opened the business with characteristic briskness.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir, my friend, Pedley, late Simpson, is quite agreeable to our
  handing over the box and contents on the terms mentioned, which, however,
  must include immunity from any proceedings in respect of the picture."</p>

  <p>"So far as I am concerned," said Fittleworth, "I agree, although such an
  agreement is quite illegal, as you know. But the arrangement is between
  ourselves and need go no farther."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Warren. "But, does anyone besides Miss Hyde know that you
  were on our track?"</p>

  <p>"No. We acted quite secretly, and as the picture has been restored, no
  action is likely to be taken by the authorities."</p>

  <p>"Then in that case," said Warren, "and as you agree to our terms, I will
  hand the property to Miss Hyde, and will let you have an account of our
  expenses later."</p>

  <p>With this he produced from his pocket a small paper packet, and, opening
  it, displayed a small, plain, gold box, somewhat like an exceedingly flat
  cigar case, which he handed to Katharine.</p>

  <p>"The paper," said he, "is inside; and I may say, madam, that I believe you
  will find it an exceedingly interesting document."</p>

  <p>Katharine, having thanked him, opened the little box and took from it a
  sheet of very thin paper, folded twice, and covered with writing of an
  antiquated style and very pale and faded. Opening the paper, she ran her eye
  quickly the writing, and then handed the document to Fittleworth. "Perhaps
  you had better read it aloud," said she. Fittleworth took the paper and
  examined it curiously. One side of it was occupied by what seemed to be a
  list or schedule; the document proper occupied the other, and it was with
  this that Fittleworth began:</p>

  <p>"James, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and
  Ireland, unto our trusty and well-beloved Andreas Hide and all other such
  persons as may be concerned with these presents. Whereas the saide Andreas
  Hide hath on sundry occasions contributed divers sums of money for our use
  and service Now We do convey to the saide Andreas Our portion of the treasure
  which Captain Sir William Phips of New England did lift from the Spanish
  wracke at Hispaniola the saide share being of the value of thirty thousand
  pounds sterling as sett forth in the accompt on the backe hereof to be
  disposed of in manner following namely the saide treasure to be secured by
  the saide Andreas Hide in some safe and secret place to be held intact for
  Our use as occasion may require while the present troubles continue and soe
  to be held if need bee during Our life and that of Our Son James Prince of
  Wales to be faithfully rendered up to Us or to the saide Prince upon Our or
  his demand as Our or his necessities may require but upon Our death and that
  of the saide Prince the saide Treasure to revert absolutely and become the
  sole property of the saide Andreas Hide or the heirs of his body.</p>

  <p>"Given under Our hand at Our Palace of White Hall on the twentieth day of
  September in the Year of our Lord God 1688.</p>

  <p>"JAMES R."</p>

  <p>As Fittleworth finished reading, he glanced significantly at Katharine,
  and Mr. Warren gave an approving nod. "So you see, Miss Hyde," said the
  latter, "there is no question of treasure trove. This is your own property,
  if you know where to find it. I need not say that if we had known of your
  existence, we would have notified you. Rather foolishly, we assumed that
  there were no heirs in existence--that the family was derelict, and, of
  course, the good old laws of treasure trove don't appeal much to an
  American."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said Katharine. "May we see what's on the other side?"</p>

  <p>Fittleworth turned the paper over and began to read from the inventory on
  the back:</p>

  <p>"Three chests containing the King's share of Captain Phips' treasure as
  follows:</p>

  <p>"The first chest containeth,</p>

  <p>"Twenty-one bars of golde</p>

  <p>"Two large baggs pieces of eight</p>

  <p>"Six parcels dust golde</p>

  <p>"Three baggs coyned golde</p>

  <p>"One bagg two hundred large pearls</p>

  <p>"Two baggs unpolished stones (divers)."</p>

  <p>At this point Fittleworth paused. "Is it worth while," he asked, "to go
  right through the list? We shall have to verify the contents of the chests
  presently, and we know the total value."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Warren, "I guess you'll find enough to pay our little
  expenses, with a trifle over. And that reminds me that we should like, if
  possible, to have the sum--which we will put at two hundred pounds--paid in
  the actual contents of these chests. It has been quite a little romance for
  us, and we should like some memento of it."</p>

  <p>Katharine glanced significantly at Fittleworth, who then said: "I
  understand that Miss Hyde wishes you to consider yourselves as partners in
  this enterprise, and to take a substantial share of the treasure--"</p>

  <p>"A third," said Katharine, "if you think that's fair."</p>

  <p>"Fair!" exclaimed Warren. "It's a great deal more than fair, it's
  exceedingly handsome; but I really don't--"</p>

  <p>"You see," interrupted Katharine, "you are really the discoverers, and it
  would seem such a tame ending to your little romance if you only took away a
  few trifles."</p>

  <p>Warren was about to protest, but Katharine continued: "We shall be very
  unhappy if you don't take a fair share. Remember, we should never have known
  anything about it but for your cleverness, and the daring way in which you
  borrowed that picture. Come, Mr. Warren, I will make a condition; you shall
  tell us how you did it, and then help us to get the chests out."</p>

  <p>To these not very onerous conditions the three Americans agreed after some
  further protests and consultation between themselves, and Simpson, or rather,
  Pedley, then asked: "I suppose the chests are stowed in that place at the
  bottom of the shaft?"</p>

  <p>"No, they're not," replied Fittleworth. "They're less than half-way down;
  but I hope you'll be able to be present when they're lifted, which is the
  next business that we have to consider, and a rather troublesome business it
  will be, I expect."</p>

  <p>The business, however, turned out to be less troublesome than Fittleworth
  had anticipated, for the three enterprising American gentlemen, having read
  the inventory, and knowing the nature of the treasure, had already provided
  themselves with the appliances necessary for dealing with the ponderous
  chests.</p>

  <p>These appliances, consisting of a powerful tackle, a set of chain slings,
  some wooden rollers, and one or two crowbars, were stored at their hotel,
  from whence Warren and Bell proceeded to fetch them without delay. Then
  Pedley, with his foot in a splint, was carried down to the Chancellor's
  Parlour, and, the door being bolted, salvage operations began forthwith. The
  tackle was hooked on to the great bronze chain that suspended the cupboard,
  and the chests, one by one, secured in the slings, were dragged on rollers to
  the opening into the shalt, and finally hoisted up to the floor of the
  parlour.</p>

  <p>The old room had doubtless looked on many a strange scene, but on none
  stranger than that which was revealed by the light of the hanging lamp and
  the candles that burned in the old silver candlesticks. The three chests,
  wrenched open, despite their massive locks, by vigorously-wielded crowbars,
  stood empty in a corner, and the five conspirators, seated round the ancient
  draw-table, gazed upon a treasure that made even its sturdy legs creak
  protestingly. Bars of gold--dull, soapy, and worthless in aspect--bags of
  gold dust, uncut gems and antiquated coins, lay cheek by jowl, with heaps of
  rings, trinkets, and ornaments of a suspiciously ecclesiastical character. At
  the head of the table Katharine sat, with the inventory before her, checking
  the items as they were called out by Fittleworth, with the impressive manner
  of an auctioneer. It was late at night before the ceremony was concluded; by
  which time the spoil, divided into three approximately equal portions, had
  been returned to the chests, of which one, allocated to the three
  adventurers, was duly marked and secured with the chain slings, ready for
  removal.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing," said Fittleworth, "that I should like to know before
  we part. I can see pretty well how you got on the track of the treasure, but
  I cannot see how you ascertained which of the stretchers contained the gold
  box. I noticed that the canvas had been unfastened only at the one end, so
  you must either have known beforehand, or made a lucky guess."</p>

  <p>Warren laughed complacently. "We Americans are a progressive people," said
  he, "and we have a way of applying recent scientific knowledge to useful
  ends. We didn't know beforehand where that gold box was, and we didn't have
  to make a shot. We just took the picture, in its case, round to an electrical
  instrument maker's, and got him to pass the X-rays through it, while we
  looked at it through a fluorescent screen. We couldn't see much of the
  picture, but we could see the gold box plain enough, so we just made a pencil
  mark over the spot on the paper in which the case was wrapped. Is there
  anything more you would like to know?"</p>

  <p>"If it wouldn't seem inquisitive," said Fittleworth, "I think we should
  like to know with whom we have had the pleasure of sharing the plunder."</p>

  <p>Warren rubbed his chin, and cast a comical look of inquiry at his two
  friends; then, having received an assenting nod from each of them, he
  replied: "We are sharing one or two secrets already, sir, and if I mention
  that one of us is a Professor of History at a well-known university in the
  United States and that the other two of us are respectively Professor of
  European Architecture at the same academic institution and Conservator of a
  famous Museum, why, then, we shall share one secret more."</p>

  <p>Three days later there arrived at the Captain Digby, where Fittleworth was
  staying, a letter from the Director asking him to withdraw his resignation.
  It was a gratifying circumstance, and he hastened to communicate it to
  Katharine. But in the meantime she had also received a letter--from her
  tenant, Mrs. Matthews--asking to be allowed to determine the tenancy in a
  month's time. Katharine read her letter to Fittleworth, and then, laying it
  down, asked somewhat abstractedly:</p>

  <p>"Didn't you once say, Joe, that you would like to live in this old house
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I did," he replied, "and I repeat it most emphatically."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Katharine, "Sir John will have to accept your
  resignation."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; THE BRONZE PARROT</h2>

  <p class="first">THE Reverend Deodatus Jawley had just sat down to the
  gate-legged table on which lunch was spread and had knocked his knee,
  according to his invariable custom, against the sharp corner of the seventh
  leg.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would endeavour to be more careful, Mr. Jawley," said the
  rector's wife. "You nearly upset the mustard-pot and these jars are
  exceedingly bad for the leg."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's of no consequence, Mrs. Bodley," the curate replied
  cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"I don't agree with you at all," was the stiff rejoinder.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter, you know, so long as the skin isn't broken," Mr.
  Jawley persisted with an ingratiating smile.</p>

  <p>"I was referring to the leg of the table," Mrs. Bodley corrected,
  frostily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I beg your pardon!" said the curate; and, blushing like a Dublin Bay
  prawn, he abandoned himself in silence to the consideration of the numerical
  ratios suggested by five mutton chops and three prospective consumers. The
  problem thus presented was one of deep interest to Mr. Jawley, who had a
  remarkably fine appetite for such an exceedingly small man, and he awaited
  its solution with misgivings born of previous disappointments.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are not very hungry, Mr. Jawley," said the rector's wife.</p>

  <p>"Er--no--er--not unusually so," was the curate's suave and casuistical
  reply. The fact is that he was always hungry, excepting after the monthly
  tea-meetings.</p>

  <p>"Because," pursued Mrs. Bodley, "I see that Walker has only cooked five
  chops; and yours looks rather a small one."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it will be quite sufficient, thank you," Mr. Jawley hastened to
  declare; adding, a little unfortunately perhaps: "Amply sufficient for any
  moderate and temperate person."</p>

  <p>The Reverend Augustus Bodley emerged from behind the Church Times and
  directed a suspicious glance at his curate; who, becoming suddenly conscious
  of the ambiguity of his last remark, blushed crimson and cut himself a
  colossal slice of bread. There was an uncomfortable silence which lasted some
  minutes, and was eventually broken by Mrs. Bodley.</p>

  <p>"I want you to go into Dilbury this afternoon, Mr. Jawley, and execute a
  few little commissions."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Mrs. Bodley. With pleasure," said the curate.</p>

  <p>"I want you to call and see if Miss Gosse has finished my hat. If she has,
  you had better bring it with you. She is so unreliable and I want to wear it
  at the Hawley-Jones' garden party to-morrow. If it isn't finished you must
  wait until it is. Don't come away without it."</p>

  <p>"No, Mrs. Bodley, I will not. I will be extremely firm."</p>

  <p>"Mind you are. Then I want you to go to Minikin's and get two reels of
  whitey-brown thread, four balls of crochet cotton and eight yards of lace
  insertion--the same kind as I had last week. And Walker tells me that she has
  run out of black lead. You had better bring two packets; and mind you don't
  put them in the same pocket with the lace insertion. Oh, and as you are going
  to the oil-shop, you may as well bring a jar of mixed pickles. And then you
  are to go to Dumsole's and order a fresh haddock-- perhaps you could bring
  that with you, too--and then to Barker's and tell them to send four pounds of
  dessert pears, and be sure they are good ones and not over-ripe. You had
  better select them and see them weighed yourself."</p>

  <p>"I will. I will select them most carefully," said the curate, inwardly
  resolving not to trust to mere external appearances, which are often
  deceptive.</p>

  <p>"Oh, and by the way, Jawley," said the rector, "as you are going into the
  town, you might as well take my shooting boots with you, and tell Crummell to
  put a small patch on the soles and set up the heels. It won't take him long.
  Perhaps he can get them done in time for you to bring them back with you. Ask
  him to try."</p>

  <p>"I will, Mr. Bodley," said the curate. "I will urge him to make an
  effort."</p>

  <p>"And as you are going to Crummell's," said Mrs. Bodley, "I will give you
  my walking shoes to take to him. They want soling and heeling; and tell him
  he is to use better leather than he did last time."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Mr. Jawley passed through the playground appertaining
  to the select boarding-academy maintained by the Reverend Augustus Bodley. He
  carried a large and unshapely newspaper parcel, despite which he walked with
  the springy gait of a released schoolboy. As he danced across the desert
  expanse, his attention was arrested by a small crowd of the pupils gathered
  significantly around two larger boys whose attitudes suggested warlike
  intentions; indeed, even as he stopped to observe them, one warrior delivered
  a tremendous blow which expended itself on the air within a foot of the other
  combatant's nose.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Fie!" exclaimed the scandalised curate. "Joblett! Joblett! Do you
  realise that you nearly struck Byles? That you might actually have hurt
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I meant to hurt him," said Joblett.</p>

  <p>"You meant to! Oh, but how wrong! How unkind! Let me beg you--let me
  entreat you to desist from these discreditable acts of violence."</p>

  <p>He stood awhile gazing with an expression of pained disapproval at the
  combatants, who regarded him with sulky grins. Then, as the hostilities
  seemed to be--temporarily--suspended, he walked slowly to the gate. He was
  just pocketing the key when an extremely somnolent pear impinged on the
  gate-post and sprinkled him with disintegrated fragments. He turned, wiping
  his coat-skirt with his handkerchief, and addressed the multitude, who all,
  oddly enough, happened to be looking in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>"That was very naughty of you. Very naughty. Some one must have thrown
  that pear. I won't tempt you to prevarication by asking who? But pears don't
  fly of themselves--especially sleepy ones."</p>

  <p>With this he went out of the gate, followed by an audible snigger which
  swelled, as he walked away, into a yell of triumph.</p>

  <p>The curate tripped blithely down the village street, clasping his parcel
  and scattering smiles of concentrated amiability broadcast among the
  villagers. As he approached the stile that guarded the foot-path to Dilbury,
  his smile intensified from mere amiability to positive affection. A small
  lady--a very small lady, in fact--was standing by the stile, resting a
  disproportionate basket on the lower step; and we may as well admit, at once
  and without circumlocution, that this lady was none other than Miss Dorcas
  Shipton and the prospective Mrs. Jawley.</p>

  <p>The curate changed over his parcel to hold out a welcoming hand.</p>

  <p>"Dorcas, my dear!" he exclaimed. "What a lucky chance that you should
  happen to come this way!"</p>

  <p>"It isn't chance," the little lady replied. "I heard Mrs. Bodley say that
  she would ask you to go into Dilbury, so I determined to come and, speed you
  on your journey" (the distance to Dilbury was about three and a half miles)
  "and see that you were properly equipped. Why did not you bring your
  umbrella?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jawley explained that the hat, the boots, the fresh haddock and the
  mixed pickles would fully occupy his available organs of prehension.</p>

  <p>"That is true," said Dorcas. "But I hope you are wearing your chest
  protector and those cork soles that I gave you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jawley assured her that he had taken these necessary precautions.</p>

  <p>"And have you rubbed your heels well with soap?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the curate. "Thoroughly; most thoroughly. They are a little
  sticky at present, but I shall feel the benefit as I go on. I have obeyed
  your instructions to the letter."</p>

  <p>"That is right, Deodatus," said Miss Dorcas; "and as you have been so
  good, you shall have a little reward."</p>

  <p>She lifted the lid of the basket and took out a small paper bag, which she
  handed to him with a fond smile. The curate opened the bag and peered in
  expectantly.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" he exclaimed. "Bull's-eyes! How nice! How good of you, Dorcas! And
  how discriminating!" (Bull's-eyes were his one dissipation.) "Won't you take
  one?</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," replied Dorcas. "I mustn't go into the cottages smelling
  of peppermint."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said Deodatus. "I often do. I think the poor creatures rather
  enjoy the aroma, especially the children."</p>

  <p>But Dorcas was adamant; and after some further chirping and twittering,
  the two little people exchanged primly affectionate farewells; and the
  curate, having popped a bull's eye in his mouth, paddled away along the
  foot-path, sucking joyously.</p>

  <p>It is needless to say that Mrs. Bodley's hat was not finished. The curate
  had unwisely executed all his other commissions before calling on the
  milliner; had ordered the pears, and even tested the quality of one or two
  samples; had directed the cobbler to send the rector's boots to the hat-shop;
  and had then collected the lace, black lead, cotton, pickles and the fresh
  haddock and borne them in triumph to the abode of Miss Gosse. It appeared
  that the hat would not be ready until seven o'clock in the evening. But it
  also appeared that tea would be ready in a few minutes. Accordingly, the
  curate remained to partake of that meal in the workroom, in company with Miss
  Gosse and her "hands"; and having been fed to bursting-point with French
  rolls and cake, left his various belongings and went forth to while away the
  time and paint the town of Dilbury--not exactly red, but a delicate and
  attenuated pink.</p>

  <p>After an hour or so of rambling about the town, the curate's errant
  footsteps carried him down to the docks, where he was delighted with the
  spectacle of a military transport, just home from West Africa, discharging
  her passengers. The khaki-clad warriors trooped down the gang-planks and
  saluted him with cheerful greetings as he sat on a bollard and watched them.
  One even inquired if his--Mr. Jawley's--mother knew he was out; which the
  curate thought very kind and attentive of him. But what thrilled him most was
  the appearance of the chaplain; a fine, portly churchman with an imposing,
  coppery nose, who was so overjoyed at the sight of his native land that he
  sang aloud; indeed, his emotion seemed actually to have affected his legs,
  for his gait was quite unsteady. Mr. Jawley was deeply affected.</p>

  <p>When the soldiers had gone, he slowly retraced his steps towards the
  gates; but he had hardly gone twenty yards when his eye was attracted by a
  small object lying in the thick grass that grew between the irregular
  paving-stones of the quay. He stooped to pick it up and uttered an
  exclamation of delight. It was a tiny effigy of a parrot, quaintly wrought in
  bronze and not more than two and a half inches high including the pedestal on
  which it stood. A perforation through the eyes had furnished the means of
  suspension, and a strand of silken thread yet remained to show, by its frayed
  ends, how the treasure had been lost.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jawley was charmed. It was such a dear little parrot; so quaint; so
  naive. He was a simple man and small things gave him pleasure; and this small
  thing pleased him especially. The better to examine his find, he seated
  himself on a nice, clean, white post and proceeded to polish the little
  effigy with his hand-kerchief, having previously moistened the latter with
  his tongue. The polishing improved its appearance wonderfully, and he was
  inspecting it complacently when his eye lighted on a chalked inscription on
  the pavement. The writing was upside down as he sat, but he had no difficulty
  in deciphering the words "Wet Paint."</p>

  <p>He rose hastily and examined the fiat top of the post. There is no need to
  go into details. Suffice it to say that anyone looking at that post could
  have seen that some person had sat on it. Mr. Jawley moved away with an angry
  exclamation. It was very annoying. But that did not justify the expressions
  that he used, which were not only out of character with his usual mild
  demeanour, but unsuitable to his cloth, even if that cloth happened to
  be--but again we say there is no need to go into details. Still frowning
  irritably, he strode out through the dock gates and up the High Street on his
  way to Miss Gosse's establishment. As he was passing the fruiterer's shop,
  Mr. Barber, the proprietor, ran out.</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, Mr. Jawley. About those pears that you ordered of my young
  man. You'd better not have those, sir. Let me send you another kind."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the curate.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, those pears, to be quite candid, are not very good--"</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether they are good or bad," interrupted Mr. Jawley. "I am
  not going to eat them," and he stamped away up the High Street, leaving the
  fruiterer in a state of stupefaction. But he did not proceed directly to the
  milliner's. Some errant fancy impelled him to turn up a side street and make
  his way towards the waterside portion of the town, and it was, in fact,
  nearly eight o'clock when he approached Miss Gosse's premises (now closed for
  the night) and rang the bell. The interval, how ever, had not been entirely
  uneventful. A blue mark under the left eye and a somewhat battered and dusty
  condition of hat and clothing seemed reminiscent of recent and thrilling
  experiences, and the satisfied grin that he bestowed on the astonished
  caretaker suggested that those experiences, if strenuous, had not been wholly
  unpleasurable.</p>

  <p>The shades of night had fallen on the village of Bobham when Mr. Jawley
  appeared in the one and only street. He carried, balanced somewhat unsteadily
  on his head, a large cardboard box, but was otherwise unencumbered. The box
  had originally been of a cubical form, but now presented a slightly irregular
  outline, and from one corner a thin liquid dripped on Mr. Jawley's shoulder,
  diffusing an aroma of vinegar and onions, with an added savour that was
  delicate and fish-like. Up the empty street the curate strode with a martial
  air, and having picked up the box--for the thirteenth time--just outside the
  gate, entered the rectory, deposited his burden on the drawing-room sofa, and
  went up to his room. He required no supper. For once in a way he was not
  hungry. He had, in fact, taken a little refreshment in town; and whelks are a
  very satisfying food, if you only take enough of them.</p>

  <p>In his narrow and bumpy bed the curate lay wakeful and wrapped in pleasing
  meditation. Now his thoughts strayed to the little bronze parrot, which he
  had placed, after a final polish, on the mantelpiece; and now, in delightful
  retrospection, he recalled the incidents of his little jaunt. There was, for
  instance, the slightly intoxicated marine with whom he had enjoyed a playful
  interview in Mermaid Street. Gleefully he reconstituted the image of that
  warrior as he had last seen him, sitting in the gutter attending to his
  features with a reddened handkerchief. And there was the overturned whelk
  stall and the two blue-jackets outside the "Pope's Head." He grinned at the
  recollection. And yet there were grumblers who actually complained of the
  dullness of the clerical life!</p>

  <p>Again he recalled the pleasant walk home across the darkening fields; the
  delightful rest by the way side (on the cardboard box), and the pleasantries
  that he had exchanged with a pair of rustic lovers--who had told him that "he
  ought to be ashamed of himself; a gentleman and a minister of religion, too!"
  He chuckled aloud as he thought of their bucolic irritation and his own
  brilliant repartee.</p>

  <p>But at this moment his meditations were broken into by a very singular
  interruption. From the neighbourhood of the mantelpiece, there issued a
  voice, a very strange voice, deep, buzzing, resonant, chanting a short
  sentence, framed of yet more strange and unfamiliar words:</p>

  <p>"Donkh e didi ma turn. On esse?"</p>

  <p>This astounding phrase rang out in the little room with a deep, booming
  emphasis on the "turn," and an interrogative note on the two final words
  There followed an interval of intense silence, and then, from some distance,
  as it seemed, came the tapping of drums, imitating most curiously the sound
  and accent of the words--"turn," for instance, being rendered by a large drum
  of deep, cavernous tone.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jawley listened with a pleased and interested smile.</p>

  <p>After a short interval, the chant was repeated; and again, like a far-away
  echo, the drums performed their curious mimicry of speech. Mr. Jawley was
  deeply interested. After a dozen or so of repetitions, he found himself able
  to repeat, with a fair accent, the mysterious sentence, and even to imitate
  the tapping and booming of the drums.</p>

  <p>But, after all, you can have too much of a good thing; and when the chant
  had continued to recur, at intervals of about ten seconds, for a quarter of
  an hour, Mr. Jawley began to feel bored.</p>

  <p>"There," said he, "that'll do," and he composed himself for slumber. But
  the invisible chanter, ignoring his remark, continued the performance da capo
  and ad lib.--in fact, ad nauseam. Then Mr. Jawley became annoyed. First he
  sat up in bed, and made what he considered appropriate comments on the
  performance, with a few personal references to the performer; and then, as
  the chant still continued with the relentless persistence of a chapel bell,
  he sprang out and strode furiously over to the mantel piece.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" he roared, shaking his fist at the invisible parrot; and,
  strange to say, both the chant and the drumming ceased forthwith. There are
  some forms of speech, it would seem, that require no interpreter.</p>

  <p>When Mr. Jawley entered the breakfast-room the following morning, the
  rector's wife was in the act of helping her husband to a devilled kidney, but
  she paused in the occupation to greet the curate with a stony stare. Mr.
  Jawley sat down and knocked his knee as usual, but commented on the
  circumstance in terms which were not at all usual. The rector stared aghast,
  and Mrs. Bodley exclaimed in shrill accents:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Jawley, how dare--"</p>

  <p>At this point she paused, having caught the curate's eye. A deathly
  silence ensued, during which Mr. Jawley glared at a solitary boiled egg.
  Suddenly he snatched up a knife, and with uncanny dexterity decapitated the
  egg with a single stroke. Then he peered curiously into the disclosed cavity.
  Now if there was one thing that Mr. Jawley hated more than another, it was an
  underdone egg; and, as his eye encountered a yellow spheroid floating in a
  clear liquid, he frowned ominously.</p>

  <p>"Raw, by gosh!" he exclaimed hoarsely, and, plucking the egg from its
  calyx, he sent it hurtling across the room. For several seconds the rector
  stared, silent and open-mouthed, at his curate; then, following his wife's
  gaze, he stared at the wall, on the chrysanthemum paper of which appeared a
  new motive uncontemplated by the designer. And, meanwhile, Mr. Jawley reached
  across the table and stuck a fork into the devilled kidney.</p>

  <p>When the rector looked round and discovered his loss he essayed some
  spluttered demands for an explanation. But, since the organs of speech are
  associated with the act of mastication, the curate was not in a position to
  answer him. His eyes, however, were disengaged at the moment, and some
  compelling quality in them caused the rector and his wife to rise from their
  chairs and back cautiously towards the door. Mr. Jawley nodded them out
  blandly, and being left in possession, proceeded to fill himself a cup of tea
  and another of coffee, cleared the dish, emptied the toast-rack, and having
  disposed of these trifles, concluded a Gargantuan repast by crunching up the
  contents of the sugar basin. Never had he enjoyed such a breakfast, and never
  had he felt so satisfied and joyous.</p>

  <p>Having wiped his smiling lips on the table cloth, he strolled out into the
  playground, where the boys were waiting to be driven in to lessons. At the
  moment of his appearance, Messrs. Joblett and Byles were in the act of
  resuming adjourned hostilities. The curate strode through the ring of
  spectators and beamed on the combatants with ferocious benevolence. His
  arrival had produced a brief armistice, but as he uttered no protests, the
  battle was resumed with a tentative prod on the part of Joblett.</p>

  <p>The curate grinned savagely. "That isn't the way, Joblett," he exclaimed.
  "Kick him, man. Kick him in the stomach."</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir," said Joblett, regarding his preceptor with saucer eyes.
  "Did you say kick him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," roared the curate. "In the stomach. Like this!"</p>

  <p>He backed a few paces, and fixing a glittering eye on Byles' abdomen,
  rushed forward, and, flinging his right foot back until it was almost visible
  over his shoulder, let out a tremendous kick. But Byles' stomach was not
  there. Neither was Byles--which, of course, follows. The result was that Mr.
  Jawley's foot, meeting with no resistance, flew into space, carrying Mr.
  Jawley's centre of gravity with it.</p>

  <p>When the curate scrambled to his feet and glared balefully around, the
  playground was empty. A frantic crowd surged in through the open house door,
  while stragglers hurriedly climbed over the walls.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jawley laughed hoarsely. It was time to open school, but at the moment
  he was not studiously inclined. Letting himself out by the gate, he strolled
  forth into the village, and sauntered up the street. And here it was, just
  opposite the little butcher's shop, that he encountered the village atheist.
  Now this philosopher who, it is needless to say, was a cobbler by profession,
  had a standing and perennial joke, which was to greet the curate with the
  words:</p>

  <p>"How do, Jawley!" and thereby elicit a gracious "Good-morning, Mr. Pegg,"
  and a polite touch of the hat. He proceeded this morning to utter the
  invariable formula, cocking his eye at the expectant butcher. But the
  anticipated response came not. Instead, the curate turned on him suddenly and
  growled:</p>

  <p>"Say 'sir,' you vermin, when you speak to your betters."</p>

  <p>The astounded cobbler was speechless for a moment; but only for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"What!" he exclaimed, "me say' sir' to a sneakin' little devil-dodger,
  what--"</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Jawley turned and stepped lightly over to the shop. Reaching in
  through the open front, he lifted a cleaver from its nail, and, swinging it
  high above his head, rushed with a loud yell at the offending cobbler. But
  Mr. Pegg was not without presence of mind, which, in this case, connoted
  absence of body. Before you could say "wax," he had darted into his house,
  bolted the door, and was looking down with bulging eyes from the first floor
  window on the crown of the curate's hat. Meanwhile the butcher had emerged
  angrily from his shop, and approached the curate from behind.</p>

  <p>"Here," he exclaimed gruffly, "what are you doing with that chop--" here
  he paused suddenly as Mr. Jawley turned his head, and he continued with
  infinite suavity:</p>

  <p>"Could you, sir, manage to spare that cleaver? If you would be so
  kind--"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jawley uttered a sulky growl and thrust the great chopper into its
  owner's hands; then, as the butcher turned away, he gave a loud laugh, on
  which the tradesman cleared his threshold at a single bound and slammed the
  half-door behind him. But a terrified backward glance showed him the curate's
  face wreathed in smiles, and another glance made him aware of the diminutive
  figure of Miss Dorcas Shipton approaching up the street.</p>

  <p>The curate ran forward to meet her, beaming with affection. But he didn't
  merely beam. Not at all. The sound of his greeting was audible even to Mr.
  Pegg, who leaned out of his window, with eyes that bulged more than ever.</p>

  <p>"Really, Deodatus!" exclaimed the scandalised Miss Dorcas. "What can you
  be thinking about; in such a pub--" Her remonstrances were cut short at this
  point by fresh demonstrations, which caused the butcher to wipe his mouth
  with the back of his hand, and Mr. Pegg to gasp with fresh amazement.</p>

  <p>"Pray, pray remember yourself, Deodatus!" exclaimed the blushing Dorcas,
  wriggling, at length, out of his too-affectionate grasp. "Besides," she
  added, with a sudden strategic inspiration, "you surely ought to be in school
  at this time."</p>

  <p>"That is of no consequence, darling," said Jawley, advancing on her with
  open arms; "old Bod can look after the whelps."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but you mustn't neglect your duties, Deodatus," said Miss Dorcas,
  still backing away. "Won't you go in, just to please me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my love, if you wish it," replied Jawley, with an amorous
  leer. "I'll go at once--but I must have just one more," and again the village
  street rang with a sound as of the popping of a ginger beer cork.</p>

  <p>As he approached the school, Mr. Jawley became aware of the familiar and
  distasteful roar of many voices. Standing in the doorway, he heard Mr. Bodley
  declare with angry emphasis that he "would not have this disgraceful noise"
  and saw him slap the desk with his open hand; whereupon nothing in particular
  happened excepting an apparently preconcerted chorus as of many goats. Then
  Mr. Jawley entered and looked round; and in a moment the place was wrapped in
  a silence like that of an Egyptian tomb.</p>

  <p>Space does not allow of our recording in detail the history of the next
  few days. We may, however, say in general terms that there grew up in the
  village of Bobham a feeling of universal respect for the diminutive curate,
  not entirely unmixed with superstitious awe. Rustics, hitherto lax in their
  manners pulled off their hats like clock-work at his approach; Mr. Pegg,
  abandoning the village street, cultivated a taste for foot paths, preferably
  remote, and unobstructed by trees; the butcher fell into the habit of sending
  gratuitous sweetbreads to the Rectory, addressed to Mr. Jawley, and even the
  blacksmith, when he had recovered from his black eye, adopted a suave and
  conciliatory demeanour.</p>

  <p>The rector's wife, alone, cherished a secret resentment (though outwardly
  attentive in the matter of devilled kidneys and streaky bacon), and urged the
  rector to get rid of his fire-eating subordinate; but her plans failed
  miserably. It is true that the rector did venture tentatively to open the
  subject to the curate, who listened with a lowering brow and sharpened a lead
  pencil with a colossal pocket-knife that he had bought at a ship-chandlers in
  Dilbury. But the conclusion was never reached. Distracted, perhaps, by Mr.
  Jawley's inscrutable manner, the rector became confused and, to his own
  surprise, found himself urging the curate to accept an additional twenty
  pounds a year, an offer which Mr. Jawley immediately insisted on having in
  writing.</p>

  <p>The only person who did not share the universal awe was Miss Dorcas; for
  she, like the sun-dial, "numbered only the sunny hours." But she respected
  him more than any; and, though dimly surprised at the rumours of his doings,
  gloried in secret over his prowess.</p>

  <p>Thus the days rolled on and Mr. Jawley put on flesh visibly. Then came the
  eventful morning when, on scanning the rector's Times, his eye lighted on an
  advertisement in the Personal Column:</p>

  <p>"Ten pounds reward. Lost; a small, bronze effigy of a parrot on a square
  pedestal; the whole two and a half inches high. The Above Reward will be paid
  on behalf of the owner by the Curator of the Filmographical Department of the
  British Museum, who has a photograph and description of the object."</p>

  <p>Now Mr. Jawley had become deeply attached to the parrot. But after all it
  was only a pretty trifle, and ten pounds was ten pounds. That very afternoon,
  the Curator found himself confronted by a diminutive clergyman of ferocious
  aspect, and hurriedly disgorged ten sovereigns after verifying the
  description; and to this day he is wont to recount, as an instance of the
  power of money, the remarkable change for the better in the clergyman's
  manners when the transaction was completed.</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon when Mr. Jawley re appeared in the village of
  Bobham. He carried a gigantic paper parcel under one arm, and his pockets
  bulged so that he appeared to suffer from some unclassified deformity. At the
  stile, he suddenly encountered Mr. Pegg, who prepared for instant flight, and
  was literally stupefied when the curate lifted his hat and graciously wished
  him "good evening." But Mr. Pegg was even more stupefied when a few minutes
  later, he saw the curate seated on a doorstep with the open parcel on his
  knees, and a mob of children gathered around him. For Mr. Jawley, with the
  sunniest of smiles, was engaged in distributing dolls, peg-tops,
  skipping-ropes and little wooden horses, to a running accompaniment of
  bull's-eyes, brandy balls and other delicacies, which he produced from
  inexhaustible pockets. He even offered Mr. Pegg, himself, a sugar-stick which
  the philosophic cordwainer accepted with a polite bow and presently threw
  over a wall. But he pondered deeply on this wonder and is probably pondering
  still in common with the other inhabitants of Bobham.</p>

  <p>But though, from that moment, Mr. Jawley became once more the gentlest and
  most amiable of men, the prestige of his former deeds remained; reverential
  awe attended his footsteps abroad, devilled kidneys and streaky bacon were
  his portion at home; until such time as Miss Dorcas Shipton underwent a
  quieter metamorphosis and became Mrs. Deodatus Jawley.</p>

  <p>And thereafter he walked, not only amidst reverence and awe, but also
  amidst flowers and sunshine.</p>

  <p>P.S.--The curious who would know more about the parrot, may find him on
  his appropriate shelf in the West African Section, and read the large,
  descriptive label which sets forth his history:</p>

  <p>"Bronze gold-weight in the form of a parrot. This object was formerly the
  property of the great Ashanti War Chief, Amankwa Tia, whose clan totem was a
  parrot. It was worn by him, attached to his wrist, as an amulet or charm and,
  when on a campaign, a larger copy of it, of gilded wood, was carried by the
  chief herald, who preceded him and chanted his official motto. It may be
  explained here that each of the Ashanti generals had a distinguishing motto,
  consisting of a short sentence, which was called out before him by his
  heralds when on the march, and repeated, with remarkably close mimicry, by
  the message drums. Thus, when several bodies of troops were marching through
  the dense forest, their respective identities were made clear to one another
  by the sound of the chant on the drums. Amankwa Tia's motto was: 'Donkh e
  didi ma turn. On esse?' Which may be translated '(Foreign) Slaves revile me.
  Why?' A somewhat meaningless sentence, but having, perhaps, a sinister
  significance."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; THE MISSING MORTGAGEE</h2>

  <h3>PART I</h3>

  <p class="first">EARLY in the afternoon of a warm, humid November day, Thomas
  Elton sauntered dejectedly along the Margate esplanade, casting an eye now on
  the slate-coloured sea with its pall of slate-coloured sky, and now on the
  harbour, where the ebb tide was just beginning to expose the mud. It was a
  dreary prospect, and Elton varied it by observing the few fishermen and fewer
  promenaders who walked foot to foot with their distorted reflections in the
  wet pavement; and thus it was that his eye fell on a smartly-dressed man who
  had just stepped into a shelter to light a cigar.</p>

  <p>A contemporary joker has classified the Scotsmen who abound in South
  Africa into two groups: those, namely, who hail from Scotland, and those who
  hail from Palestine. Now, something in the aspect of the broad back that was
  presented to his view, in that of the curly, black hair and the exuberant
  raiment, suggested to Elton a Scotsman of the latter type. In fact, there was
  a suspicion of disagreeable familiarity in the figure which caused him to
  watch it and slacken his pace. The man backed out of the shelter, diffusing
  azure clouds, and, drawing an envelope from his pocket, read something that
  was written on it. Then he turned quickly&mdash;and so did Elton, but not
  quickly enough. For he was a solitary figure on that bald and empty expanse,
  and the other had seen him at the first glance. Elton walked away slowly, but
  he had not gone a dozen paces when he felt the anticipated slap on the
  shoulder and heard the too well-remembered voice.</p>

  <p>"Blow me, if I don't believe you were trying to cut me, Tom," it said.</p>

  <p>Elton looked round with ill-assumed surprise. "Hallo, Gordon! Who the
  deuce would have thought of seeing you here?"</p>

  <p>Gordon laughed thickly. "Not you, apparently; and you don't look as
  pleased as you might now you have seen me. Whereas I'm delighted to see you,
  and especially to see that things are going so well with you."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Elton.</p>

  <p>"Taking your winter holiday by the sea, like a blooming duke."</p>

  <p>"I'm not taking a holiday," said Elton. "I was so worn out that I had to
  have some sort of change; but I've brought my work down with me, and I put in
  a full seven hours every day."</p>

  <p>"That's right," said Gordon. "'Consider the ant.' Nothing like steady
  industry! I've brought my work down with me too; a little slip of paper with
  a stamp on it. You know the article, Tom."</p>

  <p>"I know. But it isn't due till to-morrow, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't it, by gum! It's due this very day, the twentieth of the month.
  That's why I'm here. Knowing your little weakness in the matter of dates, and
  having a small item to collect in Canterbury, I thought I'd just come on, and
  save you the useless expense that results from forgetfulness."</p>

  <p>Elton understood the hint, and his face grew rigid.</p>

  <p>"I can't do it, Gordon; I can't really. Haven't got it, and shan't have it
  until I'm paid for the batch of drawings that I'm working on now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but what a pity!" exclaimed Gordon, taking the cigar from his thick,
  pouting lips to utter the exclamation. "Here you are, blueing your capital on
  seaside jaunts and reducing your income at a stroke by a clear four pounds a
  year."</p>

  <p>"How do you make that out?" demanded Elton.</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," protested Gordon, "what an unbusinesslike chap you are! Here's
  a little matter of twenty pounds quarter's interest. If it's paid now, it's
  twenty. If it isn't, it goes on to the principal and there's another four
  pounds a year to be paid. Why don't you try to be more economical, dear
  boy?"</p>

  <p>Elton looked askance at the vampire by his side; at the plump blue-shaven
  cheeks, the thick black eyebrows, the drooping nose, and the full, red lips
  that embraced the cigar, and though he was a mild tempered man he felt that
  he could have battered that sensual, complacent face out of all human
  likeness, with something uncommonly like enjoyment. But of these thoughts
  nothing appeared in his reply, for a man cannot afford to say all he would
  wish to a creditor who could ruin him with a word.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't be too hard on me, Gordon," said he. "Give me a little time.
  I'm doing all I can, you know. I earn every penny that I am able, and I have
  kept my insurance paid up regularly. I shall be paid for this work in a week
  or two and then we can settle up."</p>

  <p>Gordon made no immediate reply, and the two men walked slowly eastward, a
  curiously ill-assorted pair: the one prosperous, jaunty, overdressed; the
  other pale and dejected, and, with his well-brushed but napless clothes, his
  patched boots and shiny-brimmed hat, the very type of decent, struggling
  poverty.</p>

  <p>They had just passed the pier, and were coming to the base of the jetty,
  when Gordon next spoke.</p>

  <p>"Can't we get off this beastly wet pavement?" he asked, looking down at
  his dainty and highly-polished boots. "What's it like down on the sands?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's very good walking," said Elton, "between here and Foreness, and
  probably drier than the pavement."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Gordon, "I vote we go down;" and accordingly they descended
  the sloping way beyond the jetty. The stretch of sand left by the retiring
  tide was as smooth and firm as a sheet of asphalt, and far more pleasant to
  walk upon.</p>

  <p>"We seem to have the place all to ourselves," remarked Gordon, "with the
  exception of some half-dozen dukes like yourself."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he cast a cunning black eye furtively at the dejected man by
  his side, considering how much further squeezing was possible, and what would
  be the probable product of a further squeeze; but he quickly averted his gaze
  as Elton turned on him a look eloquent of contempt and dislike. There was
  another pause, for Elton made no reply to the last observation; then Gordon
  changed over from one arm to the other the heavy fur overcoat that he was
  carrying. "Needn't have brought this beastly thing," he remarked, "if I'd
  known it was going to be so warm."</p>

  <p>"Shall I carry it for you a little way?" asked the naturally polite
  Elton.</p>

  <p>"If you would, dear boy," replied Gordon. "It's difficult to manage an
  overcoat, an umbrella and cigar all at once."</p>

  <p>He handed over the coat with a sigh of relief, and having straightened
  himself and expanded his chest, remarked: "I suppose you're beginning to do
  quite well now, Tom?"</p>

  <p>Elton shook his head gloomily. "No," he answered, "it's the same old
  grind."</p>

  <p>"But surely they're beginning to recognise your talents by this time,"
  said Gordon, with the persuasive air of a counsel.</p>

  <p>"That's just the trouble," said Elton. "You see, I haven't any, and they
  recognised the fact long ago. I'm just a journeyman, and journeyman's work is
  what I get given to me."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that the editors don't appreciate talent when they see
  it."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," said Elton, "but they're most infernally
  appreciative of the lack of it."</p>

  <p>Gordon blew out a great cloud of smoke, and raised his eyebrows
  reflectively. "Do you think," he said after a brief pause, "you give 'em a
  fair chance? I've seen some of your stuff. It's blooming prim, you know. Why
  don't you try something more lively? More skittish, you know, old chap;
  something with legs, you know, and high shoes. See what I mean, old chap?
  High with good full calves and not too fat in the ankle. That ought to fetch
  'em; don't you think so?"</p>

  <p>Elton scowled. "You're thinking of the drawings in 'Hold Me Up,'" he said
  scornfully, "but you're mistaken. Any fool can draw a champagne bottle upside
  down with a French shoe at the end of it."</p>

  <p>"No doubt, dear boy," said Gordon, "but I expect that sort of fool knows
  what pays."</p>

  <p>"A good many fools seem to know that much," retorted Elton; and then he
  was sorry he had spoken, for Gordon was not really an amiable man, and the
  expression of his face suggested that he had read a personal application into
  the rejoinder. So, once more, the two men walked on in silence.</p>

  <p>Presently their footsteps led them to the margin of the weed-covered
  rocks, and here, from under a high heap of bladder-wrack, a large green
  shorecrab rushed out and menaced them with uplifted claws. Gordon stopped and
  stared at the creature with Cockney surprise, prodding it with his umbrella,
  and speculating aloud as to whether it was good to eat. The crab, as if
  alarmed at the suggestion, suddenly darted away and began to scuttle over the
  green-clad rocks, finally plunging into a large, deep pool. Gordon pursued
  it, hobbling awkwardly over the slippery rocks, until he came to the edge of
  the pool, over which he stooped, raking inquisitively among the weedy fringe
  with his umbrella. He was so much interested in his quarry that he failed to
  allow for the slippery surface on which he stood. The result was disastrous.
  Of a sudden, one foot began to slide forward, and when he tried to recover
  his balance, was instantly followed by the other. For a moment he struggled
  frantically to regain his footing, executing a sort of splashing, stamping
  dance on the margin. Then, the circling sea birds were startled by a yell of
  terror, an ivory-handled umbrella flew across the rocks, and Mr. Solomon
  Gordon took a complete header into the deepest part of the pool. What the
  crab thought of it history does not relate. What Mr. Gordon thought of it is
  unsuitable for publication; but, as he rose, like an extremely up-to-date
  merman, he expressed his sentiments with a wealth of adjectives that brought
  Elton in the verge of hysteria.</p>

  <p>"It's a good job you brought your overcoat, after all," Elton remarked for
  the sake of saying something, and thereby avoiding the risk of exploding into
  undeniable laughter. The Hebrew made no reply&mdash;at least, no reply that
  lends itself to verbatim report&mdash;but staggered towards the hospitable
  overcoat, holding out his dripping arms. Having inducted him into the garment
  and buttoned him up, Elton hurried off to recover the umbrella (and,
  incidentally, to indulge himself in a broad grin), and, having secured it,
  angled with it for the smart billycock which was floating across the
  pool.</p>

  <p>It was surprising what a change the last minute or two had wrought. The
  positions of the two men were now quite reversed. Despite his shabby
  clothing, Elton seemed to walk quite jauntily as compared with his shuddering
  companion who trotted by his side with short miserable steps, shrinking into
  the uttermost depths of his enveloping coat, like an alarmed winkle into its
  shell, puffing out his cheeks and anathematising the Universe in general as
  well as his chattering teeth would let him.</p>

  <p>For some time they hurried along towards the slope by the jetty without
  exchanging any further remarks; then suddenly, Elton asked: "What are you
  going to do, Gordon? You can't travel like that."</p>

  <p>"Can't you lend me a change?" asked Gordon. Elton reflected. He had
  another suit, his best suit, which he had been careful to preserve in good
  condition for use on those occasions when a decent appearance was
  indispensable. He looked askance at the man by his side and something told
  him that the treasured suit would probably receive less careful treatment
  than it was accustomed to. Still the man couldn't be allowed to go about in
  wet clothes.</p>

  <p>"I've got a spare suit," he said. "It isn't quite up to your style, and
  may not be much of a fit, but I daresay you'll be able to put up with it for
  an hour or two."</p>

  <p>"It'll be dry anyhow," mumbled Gordon, "so we won't trouble about the
  style. How far is it to your rooms?"</p>

  <p>The plural number was superfluous. Elton's room was in a little ancient
  flint house at the bottom of a narrow close in the old quarter of the town.
  You reached it without any formal preliminaries of bell or knocker by simply
  letting yourself in by a street door, crossing a tiny room, opening the door
  of what looked like a narrow cupboard, and squeezing up a diminutive flight
  of stairs, which was unexpectedly exposed to view. By following this
  procedure, the two men reached a small bed-sitting-room; that is to say, it
  was a bed room, but by sitting down on the bed, you converted it into a
  sitting-room.</p>

  <p>Gordon puffed out his cheeks and looked round distastefully.</p>

  <p>"You might just ring for some hot water, old chappie," he said.</p>

  <p>Elton laughed aloud. "Ring!" he exclaimed. "Ring what? Your clothes are
  the only things that are likely to get wrung."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, sing out for the servant," said Gordon.</p>

  <p>Elton laughed again. "My dear fellow," said he, "we don't go in for
  servants. There is only my landlady and she never comes up here. She's too
  fat to get up the stairs, and besides, she's got a game leg. I look after my
  room myself. You'll be all right if you have a good rub down."</p>

  <p>Gordon groaned, and emerged reluctantly from the depths of his overcoat,
  while Elton brought forth from the chest of drawers the promised suit and the
  necessary undergarments. One of these latter Gordon held up with a sour
  smile, as he regarded it with extreme disfavour.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think," said he, "you need have been at the trouble of
  marking them so plainly. No one's likely to want to run away with them."</p>

  <p>The undergarments certainly contrasted very unfavourably with the delicate
  garments which he was peeling off, excepting in one respect; they were dry;
  and that had to console him for the ignominious change.</p>

  <p>The clothes fitted quite fairly, notwithstanding the difference between
  the figures of the two men; for while Gordon was a slender man grown fat,
  Elton was a broad man grown thin; which, in a way, averaged their superficial
  area.</p>

  <p>Elton watched the process of investment and noted the caution with which
  Gordon smuggled the various articles from his own pockets into those of the
  borrowed garments without exposing them to view; heard the jingle of money;
  saw the sumptuous gold watch and massive chain transplanted and noted with
  interest the large leather wallet that came forth from the breast pocket of
  the wet coat. He got a better view of this from the fact that Gordon himself
  examined it narrowly, and even opened it to inspect its contents.</p>

  <p>"Lucky that wasn't an ordinary pocketbook." he remarked. "If it had been,
  your receipt would have got wet, and so would one or two other little
  articles that wouldn't have been improved by salt water. And, talking of the
  receipt, Tom, shall I hand it over now?"</p>

  <p>"You can if you like," said Elton; "but as I told you, I haven't got the
  money;" on which Gordon muttered: "Pity, pity," and thrust the wallet into
  his, or rather, Elton's breast pocket.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, the two men came out together into the gathering
  darkness, and as they walked slowly up the close, Elton asked: "Are you going
  up to town to-night, Gordon?"</p>

  <p>"How can I?" was the reply. "I can't go without my clothes. No, I shall
  run over to Broadstairs. A client of mine keeps a boarding-house there. He'll
  have to put me up for the night, and if you can get my clothes cleaned and
  dried I can come over for them to-morrow."</p>

  <p>These arrangements having been settled, the two men adjourned, at Gordon's
  suggestion, for tea at one of the restaurants on the Front; and after that,
  again at Gordon's suggestion, they set forth together along the cliff path
  that leads to Broadstairs by way of Kingsgate.</p>

  <p>"You may as well walk with me into Broadstairs," said Gordon; "I'll stand
  you the fare back by rail;" and to this Elton had agreed, not because he was
  desirous of the other man's company, but because he still had some lingering
  hopes of being able to adjust the little difficulty respecting the
  instalment.</p>

  <p>He did not, however, open the subject at once. Profoundly as he loathed
  and despised the human spider whom necessity made his associate for the
  moment, he exerted himself to keep up a current of amusing conversation. It
  was not easy; for Gordon, like most men whose attention is focussed on the
  mere acquirement of money, looked with a dull eye on the ordinary interests
  of life. His tastes in art he had already hinted at, and his other tastes lay
  much in the same direction. Money first, for its own sake, and then those
  coarser and more primitive gratifications that it was capable of purchasing.
  This was the horizon that bounded Mr. Solomon Gordon's field of vision.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, they were well on their way before Elton alluded to the
  subject that was uppermost in both their minds.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Gordon," he said at length, "can't you manage to give me a bit
  more time to pay up this instalment? It doesn't seem quite fair to keep
  sending up the principal like this."</p>

  <p>"Well, dear boy," replied Gordon, "it's your own fault, you know. If you
  would only bear the dates in mind, it wouldn't happen."</p>

  <p>"But," pleaded Elton, "just consider what I'm paying you. I originally
  borrowed fifty pounds from you, and I'm now paying you eighty pounds a year
  in addition to the insurance premium. That's close on a hundred a year; just
  about half that I manage to earn by slaving like a nigger. If you stick it up
  any farther you won't leave me enough to keep body and soul together; which
  really means that I shan't be able to pay you at all."</p>

  <p>There was a brief pause; then Gordon said dryly: "You talk about not
  paying, dear boy, as if you had forgotten about that promissory note."</p>

  <p>Elton set his teeth. His temper was rising rapidly. But he restrained
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I should have a pretty poor memory if I had," he replied, "considering
  the number of reminders you've given me."</p>

  <p>"You've needed them, Tom," said the other. "I've never met a slacker man
  in keeping to his engagements."</p>

  <p>At this Elton lost his temper completely.</p>

  <p>"That's a damned lie!" he exclaimed, "and you know it, you infernal,
  dirty, blood-sucking parasite."</p>

  <p>Gordon stopped dead.</p>

  <p>"Look here, my friend," said he; "none of that. If I've any of your damned
  sauce, I'll give you a sound good hammering."</p>

  <p>"The deuce you will!" said Elton, whose fingers were itching, not for the
  first time, to take some recompense for all that he had suffered from the
  insatiable usurer. "Nothing's preventing you now, you know, but I fancy cent.
  per cent. is more in your line than fighting."</p>

  <p>"Give me any more sauce and you'll see," said Gordon.</p>

  <p>"Very well," was the quiet rejoinder. "I have great pleasure in informing
  you that you are a human maw-worm. How does that suit you?"</p>

  <p>For reply, Gordon threw down his overcoat and umbrella on the grass at the
  side of the path, and deliberately slapped Elton on the cheek.</p>

  <p>The reply followed instantly in the form of a smart left-hander, which
  took effect on the bridge of the Hebrew's rather prominent nose. Thus the
  battle was fairly started, and it proceeded with all the fury of accumulated
  hatred on the one side and sharp physical pain on the other. What little
  science there was appertamed to Elton, in spite of which, however, he had to
  give way to his heavier, better nourished and more excitable opponent.
  Regardless of the punishment he received, the infuriated Jew rushed at him
  and, by sheer weight of onslaught, drove him backward across the little
  green.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, Elton, who knew the place by daylight, called out in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Look out, Gordon! Get back, you fool!"</p>

  <p>But Gordon, blind with fury, and taking this as attempt to escape, only
  pressed him harder. Elton's pugnacity died out instantly in mortal terror. He
  shouted out another warning and as Gordon still pressed him, battering
  furiously, he did the only thing that was possible: he dropped to the ground.
  And then, in the twinkling of an eye came the catastrophe. Borne forward by
  his own momentum, Gordon stumbled over Elton's prostrate body, staggered
  forward a few paces, and fell. Elton heard a muffled groan that faded
  quickly, and mingled with the sound of falling earth and stones. He sprang to
  his feet and looked round and saw that he was alone.</p>

  <p>For some moments he was dazed by the suddenness of the awful thing that
  had happened. He crept timorously towards the unseen edge of the cliff, and
  listened.</p>

  <p>There was no sound save the distant surge of the breakers, and the scream
  of an invisible sea-bird. It was useless to try to look over. Near as he was,
  he could not, even now, distinguish the edge of the cliff from the dark beach
  below. Suddenly he bethought him of a narrow cutting that led down from the
  cliff to the shore. Quickly crossing the green, and mechanically stooping to
  pick up Gordon's overcoat and umbrella, he made his way to the head of the
  cutting and ran down the rough chalk roadway. At the bottom he turned to the
  right and, striding hurriedly over the smooth sand, peered into the darkness
  at the foot of the cliff.</p>

  <p>Soon there loomed up against the murky sky the shadowy form of the little
  headland on which he and Gordon had stood; and, almost at the same moment,
  there grew out of the darkness of the beach a darker spot amidst a
  constellation of smaller spots of white. As he drew nearer the dark spot took
  shape; a horrid shape with sprawling limbs and a head strangely awry. He
  stepped forward, trembling, and spoke the name that the thing had borne. He
  grasped the flabby hand, and laid his fingers on the wrist; but it only told
  him the same tale as did that strangely misplaced head. The body lay face
  downwards, and he had not the courage to turn it over; but that his enemy was
  dead he had not the faintest doubt. He stood up amidst the litter of fallen
  chalk and earth and looked down at the horrible, motionless thing, wondering
  numbly and vaguely what he should do. Should he go and seek assistance? The
  answer to that came in another question. How came that body to be lying on
  the beach? And what answer should he give to the inevitable questions? And
  swiftly there grew up in his mind, born of the horror of the thing that was,
  a yet greater horror of the thing that might be.</p>

  <p>A minute later, a panic-stricken man stole with stealthy swiftness up the
  narrow cutting and set forth towards Margate, stopping anon to listen, and
  stealing away off the path into the darkness, to enter the town by the inland
  road.</p>

  <p>Little sleep was there that night for Elton in his room in the old flint
  house. The dead man's clothes, which greeted him on his arrival, hanging
  limply on the towel-horse where he had left them, haunted him through the
  night. In the darkness, the sour smell of damp cloth assailed him with an
  endless reminder of their presence, and after each brief doze, he would start
  up in alarm and hastily light his candle; only to throw its flickering light
  on those dank, drowned-looking vestments. His thoughts, half-controlled, as
  night thoughts are, flitted erratically from the unhappy past to the unstable
  present, and thence to the incalculable future. Once he lighted the candle
  specially to look at his watch to see if the tide had yet crept up to that
  solitary figure on the beach; nor could he rest again until the time of high
  water was well past. And all through these wanderings of his thoughts there
  came, recurring like a horrible refrain, the question what would happen when
  the body was found? Could he be connected with it and, if so, would he be
  charged with murder? At last he fell asleep and slumbered on until the
  landlady thumped at the staircase door to announce that she had brought his
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was dressed he went out. Not, however, until he had stuffed
  Gordon's still damp clothes and boots, the cumbrous overcoat and the smart
  billy-cock hat into his trunk, and put the umbrella into the darkest corner
  of the cupboard. Not that anyone ever came up to the room, but that, already,
  he was possessed with the uneasy secretiveness of the criminal. He went
  straight down to the beach; with what purpose he could hardly have said, but
  an irresistible impulse drove him thither to see if it was there. He went
  down by the jetty and struck out eastward over the smooth sand, looking about
  him with dreadful expectation for some small crowd or hurrying messenger.
  From the foot of the cliffs, over the rocks to the distant line of breakers,
  his eye roved with eager dread, and still he hurried eastward, always drawing
  nearer to the place that he feared to look on. As he left the town behind, so
  he left behind the one or two idlers on the beach, and when he turned
  Foreness Point he lost sight of the last of them and went forward alone. It
  was less than half an hour later that the fatal headland opened out beyond
  Whiteness.</p>

  <p>Not a soul had he met along that solitary beach, and though, once or
  twice, he had started at the sight of some mass of drift wood or heap of
  seaweed, the dreadful thing that he was seeking had not yet appeared. He
  passed the opening of the cutting and approached the headland, breathing fast
  and looking about him fearfully. Already he could see the larger lumps of
  chalk that had fallen, and looking up, he saw a clean, white patch at the
  summit of the cliff. But still there was no sign of the corpse. He walked on
  more slowly now, considering whether it could have drifted out to sea, or
  whether he should find it in the next bay. And then, rounding the headland,
  he came in sight of a black hole at the cliff foot, the entrance to a deep
  cave. He approached yet more slowly, sweeping his eye round the little bay,
  and looking apprehensively at the cavity before him. Suppose the thing should
  have washed in there. It was quite possible. Many things did wash into that
  cave, for he had once visited it and had been astonished at the quantity of
  seaweed and jetsam that had accumulated within it. But it was an
  uncomfortable thought. It would be doubly horrible to meet the awful thing in
  the dim twilight of the cavern. And yet, the black archway seemed to draw him
  on, step by step, until he stood at the portal and looked in. It was an eerie
  place, chilly and damp, the clammy walls and roof stained green and purple
  and black with encrusting lichens. At one time, Elton had been told, it used
  to be haunted by smugglers, and then communicated with an underground
  passage; and the old smuggler's look-out still remained; a narrow tunnel,
  high up the cliff, looking out into Kingsgate Bay; and even some vestiges of
  the rude steps that led up to the look-out platform could still be traced,
  and were not impossible to climb. Indeed, Elton had, at his last visit,
  climbed to the platform and looked out through the spy-hole. He recalled the
  circumstance now, as he stood, peering nervously into the darkness, and
  straining his eyes to see what jetsam the ocean had brought since then.</p>

  <p>At first he could see nothing but the smooth sand near the opening; then,
  as his eyes grew more accustomed to the gloom, he could make out the great
  heap of seaweed on the floor of the cave. Insensibly, he crept in, with his
  eyes riveted on the weedy mass and, as he left the daylight behind him, so
  did the twilight of the cave grow clearer. His feet left the firm sand and
  trod the springy mass of weed, and in the silence of the cave he could now
  hear plainly the rain-like patter of the leaping sand-hoppers. He stopped for
  a moment to listen to the unfamiliar sound, and still the gloom of the cave
  grew lighter to his more accustomed eyes.</p>

  <p>And then, in an instant, he saw it. From a heap of weed, a few paces
  ahead, projected a boot; his own boot; he recognised the patch on the sole;
  and at the sight, his heart seemed to stand still. Though he had somehow
  expected to find it here, its presence seemed to strike him with a greater
  shock of horror from that very circumstance.</p>

  <p>He was standing stock still, gazing with fearful fascination at the boot
  and the swelling mound of weed, when, suddenly, there struck upon his ear the
  voice of a woman, singing.</p>

  <p>He started violently. His first impulse was to run out of the cave. But a
  moment's reflection told him what madness this would be. And then the voice
  drew nearer, and there broke out the high, rippling laughter of a child.
  Elton looked in terror at the bright opening of the cavern's mouth, expecting
  every moment to see it frame a group of figures. If that happened, he was
  lost, for he would have been seen actually with the body. Suddenly he
  bethought him of the spy-hole and the platform, both of which were invisible
  from the entrance; and turning, he ran quickly over the sodden weed till he
  came to the remains of the steps. Climbing hurriedly up these, he reached the
  platform, which was enclosed in a large niche, just as the reverberating
  sound of voices told him that the strangers were within the mouth of the
  cave. He strained his ears to catch what they were saying and to make out if
  they were entering farther. It was a child's voice that he had first heard,
  and very weird were the hollow echoes of the thin treble that were flung back
  from the rugged walls. But he could not hear what the child had said. The
  woman's voice, however, was quite distinct, and the words seemed significant
  in more senses than one.</p>

  <p>"No, dear," it said, "you had better not go in. It's cold and damp. Come
  out into the sunshine."</p>

  <p>Elton breathed more freely. But the woman was more right than she knew. It
  was cold and damp, that thing under the black tangle of weed. Better far to
  be out in the sunshine. He himself was already longing to escape from the
  chill and gloom, of the cavern. But he could not escape yet. Innocent as he
  actually was, his position was that of a murderer. He must wait until the
  coast was clear, and then steal out, to hurry away unobserved.</p>

  <p>He crept up cautiously to the short tunnel and peered out through the
  opening across the bay. And then his heart sank. Below him, on the sunny
  beach, a small party of visitors had established themselves just within view
  of the mouth of the cave; and even as he looked, a man approached from the
  wooden stairway down the cliff, carrying a couple of deck chairs. So, for the
  present his escape was hopelessly cut off.</p>

  <p>He went back to the platform and sat down to wait for his release; and, as
  he sat, his thoughts went back once more to the thing that lay under the
  weed. How long would it lie there undiscovered? And what would happen when it
  was found? What was there to connect him with it? Of course, there was his
  name on the clothing, but there was nothing incriminating in that, if he had
  only had the courage to give information at once. But it was too late to
  think of that now. Besides, it suddenly flashed upon him, there was the
  receipt in the wallet. That receipt mentioned him by name and referred to a
  loan. Obviously, its suggestion was most sinister, coupled with his silence.
  It was a deadly item of evidence against him. But no sooner had he realised
  the appalling significance of this document than he also realised that it was
  still within his reach. Why should he leave it there to be brought in
  evidence&mdash;in false evidence, too&mdash;against him?</p>

  <p>Slowly he rose and, creeping down the tunnel, once more looked out. The
  people were sitting quietly in their chairs, the man was reading, and the
  child was digging in the sand. Elton looked across the bay to make sure that
  no other person was approaching, and then, hastily climbing down the steps,
  walked across the great bed of weed, driving an army of sand-hoppers before
  him. He shuddered at the thought of what he was going to do, and the clammy
  chill of the cave seemed to settle on him in a cold sweat.</p>

  <p>He came to the little mound from which the boot projected, and began,
  shudderingly and with faltering hand, to lift the slimy, tangled weed. As he
  drew aside the first bunch, be gave a gasp of horror and quickly replaced it.
  The body was lying on its back, and, as he lifted the weed he had
  uncovered&mdash;not the face, for the thing had no face. It had struck either
  the cliff or a stone upon the beach and&mdash;but there is no need to go into
  particulars: it had no face. When he had recovered a little, Elton groped
  shudderingly among the weed until he found the breast-pocket from which he
  quickly drew out the wallet, now clammy, sodden and loathsome. He was rising
  with it in his hand when an apparition, seen through the opening of the cave,
  arrested his movement as if he had been suddenly turned into stone. A man,
  apparently a fisherman or sailor, was sauntering past some thirty yards from
  the mouth of the cave, and at his heels trotted a mongrel dog. The dog
  stopped, and, lifting his nose, seemed to sniff the air; and then he began to
  walk slowly and suspiciously towards the cave. The man sauntered on and soon
  passed out of view; but the dog still came on towards the cave, stopping now
  and again with upraised nose.</p>

  <p>The catastrophe seemed inevitable. But just at that moment the man's voice
  rose, loud and angry, evidently calling the dog. The animal hesitated,
  looking wistfully from his master to the cave; but when the summons was
  repeated, he turned reluctantly and trotted away.</p>

  <p>Elton stood up and took a deep breath. The chilly sweat was running down
  his face, his heart was thumping and his knees trembled, so that he could
  hardly get back to the platform. What hideous peril had he escaped and how
  narrowly! For there he had stood; and had the man entered, he would have been
  caught in the very act of stealing the incriminating document from the body.
  For that matter, he was little better off now, with the dead man's property
  on his person, and he resolved instantly to take out and destroy the receipt
  and put back the wallet. But this was easier thought of than done. The
  receipt was soaked with sea water, and refused utterly to light when he
  applied a match to it. In the end, he tore it up into little fragments and
  deliberately swallowed them, one by one.</p>

  <p>But to restore the wallet was more than he was equal to just now. He would
  wait until the people had gone home to lunch, and then he would thrust it
  under the weed as he ran past. So he sat down again and once more took up the
  endless thread of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>The receipt was gone now, and with it the immediate suggestion of motive.
  There remained only the clothes with their too legible markings. They
  certainly connected him with the body, but they offered no proof of his
  presence at the catastrophe. And then, suddenly, another most startling idea
  occurred to him. Who could identify the body&mdash;the body that had no face?
  There was the wallet, it was true, but he could take that away with him, and
  there was a ring on the finger and some articles in the pockets which might
  be identified. But&mdash;a voice seemed to whisper to him&mdash;these things
  were removable, too. And if he removed them, what then? Why, then, the body
  was that of Thomas Elton, a friendless, poverty-stricken artist, about whom
  no one would trouble to ask any questions.</p>

  <p>He pondered on this new situation profoundly. It offered him a choice of
  alternatives. Either he might choose the imminent risk of being hanged for a
  murder that he had not committed, or he might surrender his identity for ever
  and move away to a new environment.</p>

  <p>He smiled faintly. His identity! What might that be worth to barter
  against his life? Only yesterday he would gladly have surrendered it as the
  bare price of emancipation from the vampire who had fastened on to him.</p>

  <p>He thrust the wallet into his pocket and buttoned his coat. Thomas Elton
  was dead; and that other man, as yet unnamed, should go forth, as the woman
  had said, into the sunshine.</p>

  <h3>PART II</h3>

  <h3>(Related by Christopher Jervis, M.D.)</h3>

  <p class="first">FROM various causes, the insurance business that passed
  through Thorndyke's hands had, of late, considerably increased. The number of
  societies which regularly employed him had grown larger, and, since the
  remarkable case of Percival Bland, the Griffin had made it a routine practice
  to send all inquest cases to us for report.</p>

  <p>[Compiler's note: the Percival Bland case actually follows directly after
  this one in the book: clearly the order of stories has been transposed.]</p>

  <p>It was in reference to one of these latter that Mr. Stalker, a senior
  member of the staff of that office, called on us one afternoon in December;
  and when he had laid his bag on the table and settled himself comfortably
  before the fire, he opened the business without preamble.</p>

  <p>"I've brought you another inquest case," said he; "a rather queer one,
  quite interesting from your point of view. As far as we can see, it has no
  particular interest for us excepting that it does rather look as if our
  examining medical officer had been a little casual."</p>

  <p>"What is the special interest of the case from our point of view?" asked
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I'll just give you a sketch of it," said Stalker, "and I think you will
  agree that it's a case after your own heart.</p>

  <p>"On the 24th of last month, some men who were collecting seaweed, to use
  as manure, discovered in a cave at Kingsgate, in the Isle of Thanet, the body
  of a man, lying under a mass of accumulated weed. As the tide was rising,
  they put the body into their cart and conveyed it to Margate, where, of
  course, an inquest was held, and the following facts were elicited. The body
  was that of a man named Thomas Elton. It was identified by the name-marks on
  the clothing, by the visiting-cards and a couple of letters which were found
  in the pockets. From the address on the letters it was seen that Elton had
  been staying in Margate, and on inquiry at that address, it was learnt from
  the old woman who let the lodgings, that he had been missing about four days.
  The landlady was taken to the mortuary, and at once identified the body as
  that of her lodger. It remained only to decide how the body came into the
  cave; and this did not seem to present much difficulty; for the neck had been
  broken by a tremendous blow, which had practically destroyed the face, and
  there were distinct evidences of a breaking away of a portion of the top of
  the cliff, only a few yards from the position of the cave. There was
  apparently no doubt that Elton had fallen sheer from the top of the
  overhanging cliff on to the beach. Now, one would suppose with the evidence
  of this fall of about a hundred and fifty feet, the smashed face and broken
  neck, there was not much room for doubt as to the cause of death. I think you
  will agree with me, Dr. Jervis?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," I replied; "it must be admitted that a broken neck is a
  condition that tends to shorten life."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," agreed Stalker; "but our friend, the local coroner, is a
  gentleman who takes nothing for granted&mdash;a very Thomas Didymus, who
  apparently agrees with Dr. Thorndyke that if there is no post mortem, there
  is no inquest. So he ordered a post mortem, which would have appeared to me
  an absurdly unnecessary proceeding, and I think that even you will agree with
  me, Dr. Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>But Thorndyke shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said he. "It might, for instance, be much more easy to push
  a drugged or poisoned man over a cliff than to put over the same man in his
  normal state. The appearance of violent accident is an excellent mask for the
  less obvious forms of murder."</p>

  <p>"That's perfectly true," said Stalker; "and I suppose that is what the
  coroner thought. At any rate, he had the post-mortem made, and the result was
  most curious; for it was found, on opening the body, that the deceased had
  suffered from a smallish thoracic aneurism, which had burst. Now, as the
  aneurism must obviously have burst during life, it leaves the cause of
  death&mdash;so I understand&mdash;uncertain; at any rate, the medical witness
  was unable to say whether the deceased fell over the cliff in consequence of
  the bursting of the aneurism or burst the aneurism in consequence of falling
  over the cliff. Of course, it doesn't matter to us which way the thing
  happened; the only question which interests us is, whether a comparatively
  recently insured man ought to have had an aneurism at all."</p>

  <p>"Have you paid the claim?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No, certainly not. We never pay a claim until we have had your report.
  But, as a matter of fact, there is another circumstance that is causing
  delay. It seems that Elton had mortgaged his policy to a money lender, named
  Gordon, and it is by him that the claim has been made, or rather, by a clerk
  of his, named Hyams. Now, we have had a good many dealings with this man
  Gordon, and hitherto he has always acted in person; and as he is a somewhat
  slippery gentleman we have thought it desirable to have the claim actually
  signed by him. And that is the difficulty. For it seems that Mr. Gordon is
  abroad, and his whereabouts unknown to Hyams; so, as we certainly couldn't
  take Hyams's receipt for payment, the matter is in abeyance until Hyams can
  communicate with his principal. And now, I must be running away. I have
  brought you, as you will see, all the papers, including the policy and the
  mortgage deed."</p>

  <p>As soon as he was gone, Thorndyke gathered up the bundle of papers and
  sorted them out in what be apparently considered the order of their
  importance. First he glanced quickly through the proposal form, and then took
  up the copy of the coroner's depositions.</p>

  <p>"The medical evidence," he remarked, "is very full and complete. Both the
  coroner and the doctor seem to know their business."</p>

  <p>"Seeing that the man apparently fell over a cliff," said I, "the medical
  evidence would not seem to be of first importance. It would seem to be more
  to the point to ascertain how he came to fall over."</p>

  <p>"That's quite true," replied Thorndyke; "and yet, this report contains
  some rather curious matter. The deceased had an aneurism of the arch; that
  was probably rather recent. But he also had some slight, old-standing aortic
  disease, with full compensatory hypertrophy. He also had a nearly complete
  set of false teeth. Now, doesn't it strike you, Jervis, as rather odd that a
  man who was passed only five years ago as a first-class life, should, in that
  short interval, have become actually uninsurable?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it certainly does look," said I, "as if the fellow had had rather
  bad luck. What does the proposal form say?"</p>

  <p>I took the document up and ran my eyes over it. On Thorndyke's advice,
  medical examiners for the Griffin were instructed to make a somewhat fuller
  report than is usual in some companies. In this case, the ordinary answers to
  questions set forth that the heart was perfectly healthy and the teeth rather
  exceptionally good, and then, in the summary at the end, the examiner
  remarked: "the proposer seems to be a completely sound and healthy man; he
  presents no physical defects whatever, with the exception of a bony ankylosis
  of the first joint of the third finger of the left hand, which he states to
  have been due to an injury."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked up quickly. "Which finger, did you say?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The third finger of the left hand," I replied.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked thoughtfully at the paper that he was reading. "It's very
  singular," said he, "for I see that the Margate doctor states that the
  deceased wore a signet ring on the third finger of the left hand. Now, of
  course, you couldn't get a ring on to a finger with bony ankylosis of the
  joint."</p>

  <p>"He must have mistaken the finger," said I, "or else the insurance
  examiner did."</p>

  <p>"That is quite possible," Thorndyke replied; "but, doesn't it strike you
  as very singular that, whereas the insurance examiner mentions the ankylosis,
  which was of no importance from an insurance point of view, the very careful
  man who made the post-mortem should not have mentioned it, though, owing to
  the unrecognisable condition of the face, it was of vital importance for the
  purpose of identification?"</p>

  <p>I admitted that it was very singular indeed, and we then resumed our study
  of the respective papers. But presently I noticed that Thorndyke had laid the
  report upon his knee, and was gazing speculatively into the fire.</p>

  <p>"I gather," said I, "that my learned friend finds some matter of interest
  in this case."</p>

  <p>For reply, he handed me the bundle of papers, recommending me to look
  through them.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said I, rejecting them firmly, "but I think I can trust you
  to have picked out all the plums."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled indulgently. "They're not plums, Jervis," said he;
  "they're only currants, but they make quite a substantial little heap."</p>

  <p>I disposed myself in a receptive attitude (somewhat after the fashion of
  the juvenile pelican) and he continued: "If we take the small and
  unimpressive items and add them together, you will see that a quite
  considerable sum of discrepancy results, thus:</p>

  <p>"In 1903, Thomas Elton, aged thirty-one, had a set of sound teeth. In
  1908, at the age of thirty-six, he was more than half toothless. Again, at
  the age of thirty-one, his heart was perfectly healthy. At the age of
  thirty-six, he had old aortic disease, with fully established compensation,
  and an aneurism that was possibly due to it. When he was examined he had a
  noticeable incurable malformation; no such malformation is mentioned in
  connection with the body.</p>

  <p>"He appears to have fallen over a cliff; and he had also burst an
  aneurism. Now, the bursting of the aneurism must obviously have occurred
  during life; but it would occasion practically instantaneous death.
  Therefore, if the fall was accidental, the rupture must have occurred either
  as he stood at the edge of the cliff, as he was in the act of falling, or on
  striking the beach.</p>

  <p>"At the place where he apparently fell, the footpath is some thirty yards
  distant from the edge of the cliff.</p>

  <p>"It is not known how he came to that spot, or whether he was alone at the
  time.</p>

  <p>"Someone is claiming five hundred pounds as the immediate result of his
  death.</p>

  <p>"There, you see, Jervis, are seven propositions, none of them extremely
  striking, but rather suggestive when taken together."</p>

  <p>"You seem," said I, "to suggest a doubt as to the identity of the
  body."</p>

  <p>"I do," he replied. "The identity was not clearly established."</p>

  <p>"You don't think the clothing and the visiting-cards conclusive."</p>

  <p>"They're not parts of the body," he replied. "Of course, substitution is
  highly improbable. But it is not impossible."</p>

  <p>"And the old woman&mdash;" I suggested, but he interrupted me.</p>

  <p>"My dear Jervis," he exclaimed; "I'm surprised at you. How many times has
  it happened within our knowledge that women have identified the bodies of
  total strangers as those of their husbands, fathers or brothers? The thing
  happens almost every year. As to this old woman, she saw a body with an
  unrecognisable face, dressed in the clothes of her missing lodger. Of course,
  it was the clothes that she identified."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was," I agreed; and then I said: "You seem to suggest the
  possibility of foul play."</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, "if you consider those seven points, you will agree
  with me that they present a cumulative discrepancy which it is impossible to
  ignore. The whole significance of the case turns on the question of identity;
  for, if this was not the body of Thomas Elton, it would appear to have been
  deliberately prepared to counterfeit that body. And such deliberate
  preparation would manifestly imply an attempt to conceal the identity of some
  other body.</p>

  <p>"Then," he continued, after a pause, "there is this deed. It looks quite
  regular and is correctly stamped, but it seems to me that the surface of the
  paper is slightly altered in one or two places and if one holds the document
  up to the light, the paper looks a little more transparent in those places."
  He examined the document for a few seconds with his pocket lens, and then
  passing lens and document to me, said: "Have a look at it, Jervis, and tell
  me what you think."</p>

  <p>I scrutinised the paper closely, taking it over to the window to get a
  better light; and to me, also, the paper appeared to be changed in certain
  places.</p>

  <p>"Are we agreed as to the position of the altered places?" Thorndyke asked
  when I announced the fact.</p>

  <p>"I only see three patches," I answered. "Two correspond to the name,
  Thomas Elton, and the third to one of the figures in the policy number."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Thorndyke, "and the significance is obvious. If the paper
  has really been altered, it means that some other name has been erased and
  Elton's substituted; by which arrangement, of course, the correctly dated
  stamp would be secured. And this&mdash;the alteration of an old
  document&mdash;is the only form of forgery that is possible with a dated,
  impressed stamp."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be rather a stroke of luck," I asked, "for a forger to happen
  to have in his possession a document needing only these two alterations?"</p>

  <p>"I see nothing remarkable in it," Thorndyke replied. "A moneylender would
  have a number of documents of this kind in hand, and you observe that he was
  not bound down to any particular date. Any date within a year or so of the
  issue of the policy would answer his purpose. This document is, in fact,
  dated, as you see, about six months after the issue of the policy."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, "that you will draw Stalker's attention to this
  matter."</p>

  <p>"He will have to be informed, of course," Thorndyke replied; "but I think
  it would be interesting in the first place to call on Mr. Hyams. You will
  have noticed that there are some rather mysterious features in this case, and
  Mr. Hyams's conduct, especially if this document should turn out to be really
  a forgery, suggests that he may have some special information on the
  subject." He glanced at his watch and, after a few moments' reflection,
  added: "I don't see why we shouldn't make our little ceremonial call at once.
  But it will be a delicate business, for we have mighty little to go upon. Are
  you coming with me?"</p>

  <p>If I had had any doubts, Thorndyke's last remark disposed of them; for the
  interview promised to be quite a sporting event. Mr. Hyams was presumably not
  quite newly-hatched, and Thorndyke, who utterly despised bluff of any kind,
  and whose exact mind refused either to act or speak one hair's breadth beyond
  his knowledge, was admittedly in somewhat of a fog. The meeting promised to
  be really entertaining.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyams was "discovered," as the playwrights have it, in a small office
  at the top of a high building in Queen Victoria Street. He was a small
  gentleman, of sallow and greasy aspect, with heavy eyebrows and a still
  heavier nose.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. Gordon?" Thorndyke suavely inquired as we entered.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyams seemed to experience a momentary doubt on the subject, but
  finally decided that he was not. "But perhaps," he added brightly, "I can do
  your business for you as well."</p>

  <p>"I daresay you can," Thorndyke agreed significantly; on which we were
  conducted into an inner den, where I noticed Thorndyke's eye rest for an
  instant on a large iron safe.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Mr. Hyams, shutting the door ostentatiously, "what can I do
  for you?"</p>

  <p>"I want you," Thorndyke replied, "to answer one or two questions with
  reference to the claim made by you on the Griffin Office in respect of Thomas
  Elton."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyams's manner underwent a sudden change. He began rapidly to turn
  over papers, and opened and shut the drawers of his desk, with an air of
  restless preoccupation.</p>

  <p>"Did the Griffin people send you here?" he demanded brusquely.</p>

  <p>"They did not specially instruct me to call on you," replied
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Hyams bouncing out of his chair, "I can't let you occupy my
  time. I'm not here to answer conundrums from Tom, Dick or Harry."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke rose from his chair. "Then I am to understand," he said, with
  unruffled suavity, "that you would prefer me to communicate with the
  Directors, and leave them to take any necessary action."</p>

  <p>This gave Mr. Hyams pause. "What action do you refer to?" he asked. "And,
  who are you?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke produced a card and laid it on the table. Mr. Hyams had
  apparently seen the name before, for he suddenly grew rather pale and very
  serious.</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of the questions that you wished to ask?" he
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"They refer to this claim," replied Thorndyke. "The first question is,
  where is Mr. Gordon?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Hyams.</p>

  <p>"Where do you think he is?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I don't think at all," replied Hyams, turning a shade paler and looking
  everywhere but at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the latter, "then the next question is, are you
  satisfied that this claim is really payable?"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have made it if I hadn't been," replied Hyams.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said Thorndyke; "and the third question is, are you satisfied
  that the mortgage deed was executed as it purports to have been?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say anything about that," replied Hyams, who was growing every
  moment paler and more fidgety, "it was done before my time."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Thorndyke. "You will, of course, understand why I am
  making these inquiries."</p>

  <p>"I don't," said Hyams.</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "perhaps I had better explain. We are dealing, you
  observe, Mr. Hyams, with the case of a man who has met with a violent death
  under somewhat mysterious circumstances. We are dealing, also, with another
  man who has disappeared, leaving his affairs to take care of themselves; and
  with a claim, put forward by a third party, on behalf of the one man in
  respect of the other. When I say that the dead man has been imperfectly
  identified, and that the document supporting the claim presents certain
  peculiarities, you will see that the matter calls for further inquiry."</p>

  <p>There was an appreciable interval of silence. Mr. Hyams had turned a
  tallowy white, and looked furtively about the room, as if anxious to avoid
  the stony gaze that my colleague had fixed on him.</p>

  <p>"Can you give us no assistance?" Thorndyke inquired, at length.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hyams chewed a pen-holder ravenously, as he considered the question.
  At length, he burst out in an agitated voice: "Look here, sir, if I tell you
  what I know, will you treat the information as confidential?</p>

  <p>"I can't agree to that, Mr. Hyams," replied Thorndyke. "It might amount to
  compounding a felony. But you will be wiser to tell me what you know. The
  document is a side-issue, which my clients may never raise, and my own
  concern is with the death of this man."</p>

  <p>Hyams looked distinctly relieved. "If that's so," said he, "I'll tell you
  all I know, which is precious little, and which just amounts to this: Two
  days after Elton was killed, someone came to this office in my absence and
  opened the safe. I discovered the fact the next morning. Someone had been to
  the safe and rummaged over all the papers. It wasn't Gordon, because he knew
  where to find everything; and it wasn't an ordinary thief, because no cash or
  valuables had been taken. In fact, the only thing that I missed was a
  promissory note, drawn by Elton."</p>

  <p>"You didn't miss a mortgage deed?" suggested Thorndyke, and Hyams, having
  snatched a little further refreshment from the pen-holder, said he did
  not.</p>

  <p>"And the policy," suggested Thorndyke, "was apparently not taken?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Hyams "but it was looked for. Three bundles of policies had
  been untied, but this one happened to be in a drawer of my desk and I had the
  only key."</p>

  <p>"And what do you infer from this visit?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Hyams, "the safe was opened with keys, and they were
  Gordon's keys&mdash;or at any rate, they weren't mine&mdash;and the person
  who opened it wasn't Gordon; and the things that were taken&mdash;at least
  the thing, I mean&mdash;chiefly concerned Elton. Naturally I smelt a rat; and
  when I read of the finding of the body, I smelt a fox."</p>

  <p>"And have you formed any opinion about the body that was found?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have," he replied. "My opinion is that it was Gordon's body: that
  Gordon had been putting the screw on Elton, and Elton had just pitched him
  over the cliff and gone down and changed clothes with the body. Of course,
  that's only my opinion. I may be wrong; but I don't think I am."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Mr. Hyams was not wrong. An exhumation, consequent on
  Thorndyke's challenge of the identity of the deceased, showed that the body
  was that of Solomon Gordon. A hundred pounds reward was offered for
  information as to Elton's whereabouts. But no one ever earned it. A letter,
  bearing the post mark of Marseilles, and addressed by the missing man to
  Thorndyke, gave a plausible account of Gordon's death; which was represented
  as having occurred accidentally at the moment when Gordon chanced to be
  wearing a suit of Elton's clothes.</p>

  <p>Of course, this account may have been correct, or again, it may have been
  false; but whether it was true or false, Elton, from that moment, vanished
  from our ken and has never since been heard of.</p>

  <h3>PART I</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. HENRY PALMER looked furtively, but critically, at Dr.
  Macmuffigan. He had been told that on Friday night he would most probably
  find the doctor drunk. And so it had turned out. But the question that
  agitated Mr. Primer was: how drunk was he, and, above all, was he drunk
  enough?</p>

  <p>A delicate and difficult question this. Afflicted persons are apt to
  spring surprises on one. The near sighted man, with a squint to boot, who
  ought to be as blind as a bat, will sometimes develop a disconcerting
  acuteness of vision; one-legged men astonish us with incredible feats of
  agility; the uncertainty of the deaf is a matter of daily observation; while
  as to the drunk, proverbial philosophy has actually devised for them a
  special directing Providence. So Mr. Palmer watched the doctor narrowly and
  with anxious speculation.</p>

  <p>"And how long has this friend of yours been ill?" demanded the latter
  huskily, and with a slight brogue.</p>

  <p>"At intervals, for a week or two," replied Mr. Palmer; "but the last
  attack only came on this morning."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose you want me to come this very moment?" said Dr. Macmulligan
  aggressively.</p>

  <p>"If you could," replied Palmer. "He's in a very critical state."</p>

  <p>"I know," growled Macmulligan. "It is the old story. Put off sending for
  the doctor till the patient's at the last gasp, and then drag him away from
  his dinner or out of his bed."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Palmer; "but may I take it that you'll come?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose ye may," replied the doctor. "Juty is juty, though 'tis
  devilish unpleasant. Give me the name and address, and I'll be with you in a
  jiffy."</p>

  <p>He opened a manuscript book, and, dipping his pen in an open jar of cough
  lozenges, stared interrogatively at Mr. Palmer. The latter noticed the
  circumstance approvingly, and decided that Dr. Macmulligan would do.</p>

  <p>Sheerness Harbour, that is the wide estuary of the Medway, at nine o'clock
  on an autumn night, with a brisk sou'-wester and driving rain, is no ideal
  sailing ground. Dr. Macmulligan, hunched up in the stern sheets of the boat,
  swore continuously, with exacerbations as the spray slapped his face and
  trickled down the collar of his mackintosh.</p>

  <p>"It's a disagreeable journey that I've brought you," Palmer said
  apologetically; "beastly cold, too. May I offer you a little refresher to
  keep the weather out?" and here he produced from a locker a large flat bottle
  and a tumbler.</p>

  <p>"'Dade! but you may," the doctor replied with alacrity; "'tis cold enough
  to freeze a brass monkey." He took the flat bottle, and, with unexpected
  steadiness, poured out half a tumblerful, and, having sniffed at it
  approvingly, took a quick gulp and drew a deep breath. "'Tis a fine whisky
  that," he remarked, with another gulp in verification. "I'd like to know your
  wine merchant, sir."</p>

  <p>Palmer laughed. "So I suspect," said he, "would some of the gentlemen at
  the Custom House."</p>

  <p>The suggestion contained in that last remark so gratified the doctor that
  he could do no less than pledge the wine merchant anew; and, in fact, by the
  time the boat's fore-foot grated on the little hard on the Isle of Grain, the
  flat bottle contained nothing but convivial memories. Nevertheless, as they
  fought their way through wind and rain, the doctor's comparative steadiness
  of gait filled his conductor with surprise and secret uneasiness. But the
  thing had to be carried through now, and bracing himself for the final scene,
  he rapped softly on the door of a lonely house on the marshes.</p>

  <p>In a few moments the door was unfastened, and its opening revealed a man,
  holding a candle in one hand, and, in the other, a handkerchief with which he
  mopped his eyes. He blinked inquiringly at the new-comers, and asked
  dejectedly: "Is that the doctor, Henry?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Palmer, "I hope--"</p>

  <p>Here he paused, and the other shook his head sadly. "Come in," said he;
  and, as they followed him into the dismal room, on the table of which another
  fiat bottle and three tumblers were set out, he continued: "It happened less
  than an hour after you left, Henry. I suppose the doctor may as well see
  him?"</p>

  <p>"And phwat for?" demanded the doctor, adding somewhat obscurely: "D'ye
  take me for Lazarus?"</p>

  <p>To this the dejected man made no reply, but, taking up the candle, stole
  out of the room on tiptoe and began to ascend the stairs, followed by Palmer
  and the protesting doctor. Silently they crept up--excepting the doctor, who
  missed a step half-way up, and commented hoarsely on the circumstance--to a
  door on the first floor, which their conductor noiselessly opened and
  beckoned them to enter.</p>

  <p>The room was in total darkness save for the light of the candle, which
  showed a large bed by the wall, and lying on it, on the farther side, a
  motionless figure covered by a sheet. The man with the candle tiptoed to the
  bed, and reverently drawing back the sheet, let the flickering light fall on
  the uncovered face. And a ghastly face it was with its dead-white skin, its
  bandaged jaws, and the two pennies resting on the eyelids, and looking, in
  the dim light, like the dark shadows of empty sockets.</p>

  <p>Palmer and his friend gazed sadly at the still figure and sighed deeply.
  But the doctor was less affected. After a single glance at the bed, he turned
  away with a grunt, remarking: "We've had our trip in the wet for nothing.
  'Twas an undertaker ye wanted," and with this he proceeded cautiously to
  descend the stairs to the more cheerful room below, whither the other two men
  shortly followed.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Palmer, as he mixed the doctor a glass of toddy, "we
  shall want a certificate?"</p>

  <p>Macmulligan nodded.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't write it now and save a journey?"</p>

  <p>"No; I don't carry the forms about with me," the doctor replied, adding
  with a bibulous twinkle, "Ye see, me patients are usually alive--to begin
  with, at any rate. But ye'll have to put me across in the boat, so ye can
  come to the surgery and get the certificate. And ye can call on the
  undertaker and fix up the funeral, too. 'Tis best to get these affairs
  settled quickly. Ye don't want a corpse in the house longer than ye can
  help."</p>

  <p>Having delivered this advice gratis, the medicus emptied his tumbler, and
  rose. Palmer buttoned his oilskin coat, and the three men went out to the
  door. The rain had now ceased, but as the two voyagers stepped forth into the
  night a chilly wind swept across the marshes and the low murmur of breaking
  waves came up from the shore. The man who was left behind watched the two
  figures as they receded down the rough path, and, as they disappeared, he
  stepped into the sitting-room, and, taking a pair of marine glasses from a
  shelf, went out and followed the other two stealthily down the path. Through
  the glasses he watched them get into the boat, saw them push off and hoist
  the sail, and then, as the dim shape of the latter faded into the darkness,
  he returned to the house and shut the door.</p>

  <p>Having replaced the binoculars, he once more took the candle and ascended
  the stairs. But not on tip toe this time. Taking the stairs two at a time, he
  walked briskly into the chamber of death, and set the candle on a chest of
  drawers.</p>

  <p>"It's all clear, Joe," said he. "I've seen 'em start across."</p>

  <p>On this the figure on the bed pushed back the sheet and sat up, and having
  adroitly caught the two pennies as they dropped, spun them in the air, and
  began to untie the jaw bandage.</p>

  <p>"Yah!" he exclaimed, wagging his chin up and down. "What a relief it is to
  get that beastly thing off! Chuck us my dressing-gown, Tom, and a towel to
  wipe off this powder."</p>

  <p>He stood up, stretching himself, and, having donned the dressing gown and
  wiped his face briskly, descended with his companion to the lower room.</p>

  <p>"So much for act one," he remarked, pouring him self out a "tot" of
  whisky. "We're safe for the certificate, I suppose, Barratt?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Barratt, "and for the burial order. We've got over the main
  difficulty. All the rest is plain sailing."</p>

  <p>"It may be," rejoined the other, "but it's deuced complicated. Just run
  over the programme again, and see if I can get it into my thick head."</p>

  <p>Barratt took up a position on the hearthrug with an expository air, and
  proceeded to explain. "It's really quite simple," said he, "so far as getting
  the stuff is concerned. The difficulty was to find a safe place to stow it
  until the hue and cry was over, and we've done that. The programme now is:
  First, we've got to get the local undertaker to make us a coffin to
  measurements that Palmer will give him, and deliver it to Palmer, who will
  bring it across in the boat; and there'll have to be a lead coffin inside,
  which he'll have to leave open for us to solder down. I think Palmer will be
  able to manage that. Then, when we have got the coffin, Palmer takes the boat
  up to East Haven Creek by Canvey Island, and leaves her there. Next, he and I
  call at the premises--properly made up, of course--with your duplicate keys,
  and some dummy specimens in cases and ask the caretaker for a receipt for
  them.</p>

  <p>"While he is unpacking the cases, we grab him from behind and run him down
  to the strong room and lock him in. Then we open the door for you and you
  show us where the most classy articles are kept. 'While we are packing them
  in the cases, you go and give Jim Baker the tip, and he brings his car
  round--with the wrong number plate on it. We carry the cases out--they will
  be quite small ones--and stow them in the car, get in ourselves, and away we
  go. It's all quite simple and straightforward, broad daylight, nothing
  suspicious about it, cases always going in and out there. Well; Jimmy runs us
  down near to the creek. It will be dark by then. We get out and carry the
  case across the marshes to the boat, drop down with the tide and sail across
  here. Meanwhile, Jimmy slithers away, and when he gets to a quiet place at a
  safe distance changes his number plate. Then off he scoots to Norwich. They
  can suspect him if they please, but they won't find any of the stuff about
  him, because it will be safely screwed down in the late William Brunton's
  coffin."</p>

  <p>"Then, are you going to send the coffin to Gravelham by rail?"</p>

  <p>"No; too much fuss and too many papers and records in the company's books.
  I shall send the burial order to Allen, the undertaker, and tell him the
  coffin is coming by barge. Then he will collect it and make all the
  arrangements for the funeral; and I shall stipulate that the remains are to
  be deposited in the catacombs, not in a grave or vault. That's why we've got
  to have a lead coffin."</p>

  <p>"You say you've got a key of the catacombs?"</p>

  <p>"Not a key; a squeeze. I got it about the time I first thought of this
  little jaunt, when you were taking the squeeze from the keys of your late
  employer, like a faithful and trustworthy private secretary--"</p>

  <p>"Oh, chuck that!" interrupted the other irritably. "You needn't jeer after
  having egged me on to do it."</p>

  <p>"Righto, Murray, old man," said Barratt with a cynical grin, "we'll get
  back to the business. Mr. Allen will arrange a nice quiet funeral, and when
  we have followed our dear departed brother to his last resting place--for the
  present--we can take a little holiday and let things settle down. Do you
  follow the process?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," replied Murray, "and it seems quite a neat plan."</p>

  <p>"Neat!" exclaimed Barratt; "it's positively masterly. Just consider! Here
  we've got a bulky swag that we can't melt and we can't break up, and which,
  if it were all together, would give us away instantly; and yet which is quite
  negotiable piece by piece. All we want is a safe hiding-place, and, by Jove!
  we've got it. These catacombs are better than any bank or safe deposit. When
  we want to raise the wind, all we've got to do is to call on the late
  lamented, and hook out one or two pieces. The Yankee collector will do the
  rest."</p>

  <p>"But are the catacombs quite accessible?"</p>

  <p>"Bless you!" laughed Barratt, "they seem to have been built for the very
  purpose. The cemetery is outside the town, and all you've got to do is to get
  over the wall; you can bring a ladder if you like, there's no one to
  interfere. I tell you, Murray, this little investment will yield us an income
  for years."</p>

  <p>"So it ought," growled Murray. "It will take something substantial to
  recompense me for all that I've gone through."</p>

  <p>On which Barratt grinned once more, and cut off the end of a cigar.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>PART II</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. EDWARD ALLEN, Furnisher and Undertaker, stood in his
  little office, rubbing his hands softly and sympathetically, as four bereaved
  gentlemen, in correct, but unostentatious mourning, were ushered in. The
  names by which he knew then are not material to this history; to us they are
  known respectively as Thomas Barratt, Henry Palmer, Joseph Murray, and Jimmy
  Baker.</p>

  <p>"I am deeply concerned, gentlemen," said Mr. Allen, giving his hands an
  extra rub, "to inform you that the coffin has not yet arrived. The weather,
  as you know, has been somewhat boisterous, and doubtless the barge has been
  delayed by the exigencies of navigation."</p>

  <p>The four men looked at one another uneasily, and Mr. Allen continued: "We
  may expect it at any moment. My conveyance is waiting at the wharf, and the
  mourning carriage is in readiness to start the instant the coffin
  arrives."</p>

  <p>At these unwelcome tidings the countenances of the four mourners assumed
  an expression admirably in keeping with the business on hand, though, during
  the temporary absence of the undertaker, they exchanged remarks which might
  have sounded slightly out of character. However, there was nothing for it but
  to wait on the vagaries of wind and tide; and this they did, with outward
  calm and inward tumult of spirit.</p>

  <p>As some three-quarters of an hour passed, their nervous tension
  progressively increased. And then came a dramatic interruption. At the door
  of the office the undertaker appeared in a state of manifest agitation,
  accompanied by a seafaring man, whom Barratt instantly recognised as the
  skipper of the barge.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," the undertaker said, in impressive tones, "I deeply regret to
  announce that a most dreadful thing has happened. It appears that the coffin
  has been--er--temporarily mislaid."</p>

  <p>The four men with one accord, sprang to their feet.</p>

  <p>"Mislaid!" they exclaimed with one voice, and Jimmy Baker added: "What the
  blazes do you mean by 'mislaid'?"</p>

  <p>The undertaker indicated the skipper with a silent wave of the hand, and
  the skipper stared sulkily at the sou'-wester that he held.</p>

  <p>"Overboard," he remarked stolidly.</p>

  <p>"What?" shrieked Barratt.</p>

  <p>"Overboard it is," the skipper persisted doggedly.</p>

  <p>"But, how did it happen?" demanded Palmer.</p>

  <p>"Why, d'ye see," replied the skipper, in even, unimpassioned tones, "'twas
  like this here: we set that there coffin across the fo'ksl scutfie, to be out
  o' the way like, 'cos my mate, he didn't like a-havin' of it aboard. Said as
  how it'd bring trouble on us; and right he were, sure enough. We hadn't fair
  got out through the Jenkin afore it began. Up comes a bloomin' collier
  a-hootin' like blazes and nearly wipes the paint off our quarter; then up we
  bumps agin the Yantlet Buoy, and I reckon that started the bloomin' corfin
  a-travellin', though we didn't twig it. Then up comes a regilar squall from
  west'ard, and lays us right over to leeward--nearly capsized us, that there
  squall did, and I reckon the lurch we took give that corfin another lift. But
  we never noticed nothin' cos, just then, a steam trawler an' a collier an' a
  Rooshian timber boat all comes on top of us together a-bellerin' like bulls
  o' Bashan. Thought we was bound for the cellar that time, I did, and so did
  my mate. But we jest managed to get 'er about afore the timber boat 'it us,
  and, as we come up, we takes a sea right over the 'ead. That's what done it,
  I reckon, but we didn't spot it, you understand. Well, when we was clear o'
  them blighters, I says to my mate, I says: 'Bill,' I says, 'jest run forrard
  and take a turn of a rope's end round that there corfin.' So he 'ooks it
  forrard, and then I 'ears 'im' oller out. 'Joe,' he says, 'there ain't no
  bloomin' corfin 'ere,' 'e. says. ''What!' I says. 'No,' he says, 'corfin's
  gone overboard,' 'e says, an' that's how it happened. I puts up me 'elm, and
  we cruised about there for nigh upon a hower, but nary a sign o' that there
  corfin did we see. Three times we was within a inch o' bein' run down, an' we
  nearly smashed ourselves on the Middle Blyth buoy, an' then we lost our tide,
  an' 'ad to bring up in Hole Haven. So now yer know about it."</p>

  <p>As the skipper finished his narrative, he surveyed his hearers with a
  defiant stare, noting with some surprise the consternation that appeared on
  the countenances of the four mourners. To his nautical mind it seemed that
  the obsequies had been very satisfactorily concluded, and the needless
  expense of a shore funeral saved. Even the undertaker viewed his clients'
  emotion with secret wonder, and thought they must have been exceedingly
  attached to the deceased.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Allen," said Barratt gloomily, when the skipper had departed;
  "what's going to happen, and what is to be done?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Allen was doubtful, but opined that the coffin would probably turn up
  somewhere. "But," he added, "I don't suppose you want an inquest."</p>

  <p>His clients certainly did not, and said so with much emphasis. Then Mr.
  Allen developed the luminous idea of having some bills printed, or
  advertising in the papers; and he had begun drafting an advertisement
  beginning: "Lost, a coffin with contents," when Barratt interrupted him:</p>

  <p>"The coffin was addressed to you, Mr. Allen," said he. "For security, I
  painted the direction on the wood with Stockholm tar, so it won't have washed
  off."</p>

  <p>Mr. Allen was secretly shocked, but outwardly approving.</p>

  <p>"A very wise precaution," said he, "and most fortunate under the
  circumstances." Here he was called away for a short time, and during his
  absence the four conspirators debated anxiously whether they should scatter
  and watch the developments from afar, deputing the undertaker to conduct the
  funeral, or whether they should take the risk of waiting for tidings of the
  lost sheep. They had not reached any conclusion when Mr. Allen returned, and,
  having decided to continue the discussion later, they solemnly adjourned the
  proceedings and prepared to depart.</p>

  <p>Just as they reached the outer door of the premises, a seafaring man of
  truculent aspect entered, and stared around; and, looking out, they were
  aware of four other mariners approaching up the street, bearing a large,
  elongated object wrapped in a tarpaulin.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mr. Allen?" the ship-man inquired, fixing a fierce blue eye on
  the undertaker; and when the undertaker admitted his identity the seaman
  continued: "I'm the master of the tug Peacock. Name of Swivells. I've got a
  coffin consigned to you. Picked her up derelict off Yantlet Creek. Will ye
  'ave 'er? If you say yes, you've got to pay salvage; if not, I delivers 'er
  to the Receiver of Wrecks."</p>

  <p>Mr. Allen began cautiously to inquire as to the amount of the salvage
  dues, when Barratt interrupted:</p>

  <p>"We won't haggle for a sovereign or so, Mr. Allen. I'll settle with the
  captain, if you will arrange to have the funeral carried out without
  delay."</p>

  <p>Mr. Allen bowed and hurried away, and so faithfully did he carry out his
  instructions that when the five mariners came forth from the saloon bar of
  "The Privateer," four singularly cheerful-looking mourners were in the very
  act of scrambling into the mourning carriage.</p>

  <p>Decency will not allow us to follow the proceedings further. On the ears
  of the less callous Murray, the solemn and beautiful words of the Burial
  Service jarred painfully, whereas, to Barratt, we have with regret to admit
  that the references to the Resurrection merely associated themselves with the
  projected liberation of the swag. And thus the curtain fell on the obsequies
  of the late William Brunton, and thereafter the funeral baked meats were
  consumed without tears or lamentation--quite the contrary, in fact--in the
  festive neighbourhood of Piccadilly Circus.</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>PART III</h3>

  <p class="first">NEARLY six months had passed. The memory of the mysterious
  and successful robbery, by which the famous Harland collection of Chinese
  porcelain was plundered of its choicest gems, had faded from the minds of all
  but professed collectors; and the funeral of the late William Brunton had
  become to Mr. Allen and his friends as a tale that is told--and told pretty
  frequently.</p>

  <p>It was a dark night. The Parish Church clock had just struck half-past
  eleven; the heavy goods train had just rumbled through the station, and
  belated steamers were hooting on the river, when four men approached the
  cemetery of Gravelham by a deserted footpath, and gathered under the black
  shadow of the wall.</p>

  <p>"Your show, Barratt," said a voice, resembling that of Mr. Jimmy Baker.
  "I'll hoist you up while you fix the contraption."</p>

  <p>In response, Barratt produced from his overcoat pocket a small rope ladder
  of thin, tough line, with two iron hooks at the top. Being hoisted up by the
  accommodating Jimmy, he fixed the hooks to the coping, got astride the wall,
  and dropped down inside. The others quickly followed, and the last one,
  having been hoisted up for the purpose, detached and pulled over the ladder
  and refixed it on the inside. Then, leaving it hanging, they stole off along
  the path towards the catacombs.</p>

  <p>"This is a ghoulish sort of job," grumbled Murray, as they descended the
  steps and stood in the well-like cavity before the grisly black doors. It was
  certainly an eerie place. Even in the darkness they could see the crumbling
  tablets on the moss-grown jambs, seeming to whisper of dissolution and decay.
  A strange mouldy smell seemed to hang about that grim portal, and as they
  waited while Barratt oiled the great key, the wind stirred the big black
  doors until it sounded as if some one within were stealthily groping for some
  means of escape.</p>

  <p>At length the great key was inserted, the bolt shot back with a hollow
  clang, and the gloomy door swung inwards with a long-drawn sepulchral
  groan.</p>

  <p>"Poof!" exclaimed Murray, breathing the musty air distastefully; "let's
  have a light, Barratt, for God's sake!</p>

  <p>"Wait till I've shut the door and stopped up the key-hole," was the reply;
  and Murray heard with an uncomfortable thrill the heavy door pushed to and
  the key turned from the inside. Then Barratt composedly produced a reading
  lantern and, having lit the candle, threw its light along a massive shelf and
  on the square ends of the row of coffins.</p>

  <p>"Fourth from the end, I think," said Palmer, "but I'd better hop up and
  have a squint."</p>

  <p>And as he climbed up, Murray asked:</p>

  <p>"How many are you going to take, Barratt?"</p>

  <p>"Only three," was the reply; "two Powder Blues and a Red Hawthorn. It's no
  use taking more than we've negotiated. Have you got him, Palmer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Palmer, "it's all right. Stand by to catch hold when I
  shove," and, stooping to grasp the end, he gave a heave that slid the coffin
  well out beyond the edge of the shelf. His companions caught it, and with
  some difficulty lifted it to the ground. Then Barratt produced from his
  pocket a ratchet screwdriver of most approved design, and began skilfully to
  extract the screws.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, as he picked out the last, and his companions each drew a
  jemmy from his pocket, "stand by to hoist all together."</p>

  <p>The jemmies were duly inserted into the well-pitched crack; Barratt gave
  the words "One, two, three," and as he uttered the word "three" there was a
  bursting sound, the lid tilted and slid off, and the four men sprang back
  with astonished gasps. Barratt snatched up the lantern and threw its light
  into the coffin, and from the four men came simultaneously muffled cries of
  amazement.</p>

  <p>There was a brief interval of silence, during which the conspirators stood
  motionless as statues, staring with incredulous horror at the coffin. At
  length Barratt spoke:</p>

  <p>"You idiot, Palmer; you've sent us down the wrong coffin!"</p>

  <p>Palmer stumbled round, and, lifting the lid, held it up to the light of
  the lantern, which shone inexorably on the name-plate of the mythical William
  Brunton, and on the tar-written inscription which had so shocked the
  susceptibilities of the undertaker.</p>

  <p>"It's our coffin right enough," said Palmer; "there's no doubt of
  that."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there?" shouted Baker wrathfully. "Then perhaps you will tell me
  how that old woman got into it, and what's become of our swag?"</p>

  <p>"That's what we should like somebody to tell us," said Barratt, staring
  gloomily at the coffin, and holding his handkerchief over his nose. "Some one
  has butted in and upset our apple cart. Some one who'd got a superfluous
  corpse."</p>

  <p>"You're right, Barratt," said Murray. "Very superfluous, indeed. Look
  here," and he advanced cautiously to the coffin and pointed to a ragged hole
  in the throat of the repulsive figure within it.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Barratt, "there's no mistake about it. That old woman has
  been 'done in.' Our coffin must have come in mighty handy for somebody who
  was in a tight place. And by that same token, we're in a pretty tight place
  ourselves. The sooner we get that coffin lid on again and clear out, the
  healthier it will be for our necks."</p>

  <p>The justice of these remarks was obvious. Willing and rather shaky hands
  replaced the lid. The screws were run rapidly into their holes, and the
  coffin replaced on its shelf. Once more the lock clanged, the gloomy door
  swung open with a groan and closed forever on the tragedy of the late William
  Brunton. A couple of minutes later, four dejected men trailed along the dark
  footpath on a circuitous route to the station, and for a while none of them
  spoke. It was Mr. Jimmy Baker who broke the silence in a tone of deep
  exasperation:</p>

  <p>"Well," he exclaimed, "you are a pretty lot of blighters! Just see what
  you've done. You've blued about three hundred pounds of good money, and what
  have you got for it? You've provided a free funeral for some old Jude who
  wasn't wanted, and you've made one of her pals a present of fifty thousand
  pounds worth of stuff. And where do I come in!"</p>

  <p>"You don't come in at all," growled Barratt; "you go out--with the rest of
  us; and devilish thankful you ought to be!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h3>PART IV</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was about a month later that the Morland Telegraph
  published under conspicuous head-lines the following announcement:</p>

  <p>"STRANGE DISCOVERY OF THE HARLAND TREASURES</p>

  <p>"The mystery which enshrouded the remarkable robbery from Mr. Harland's
  collection of priceless Chinese porcelain has been resolved into an even
  greater mystery. Yesterday morning, the Rector of Stoke, in the Hundred of
  Hoo, walking down to the Blyth Sand to bathe, and looking round to observe
  the effects of the recent gale, noticed with surprise the necks of a number
  of blue jars standing up out of the sand. Picking one up, he saw at once that
  it was a porcelain vessel of great beauty, and proceeded with extreme care to
  disinter the remainder. Having some knowledge of porcelain, he immediately
  recognised the pieces as Chinese vases and jars of the kind known as Powder
  Blue and Hawthorn; and, recalling the late robbery, he carefully conveyed
  them to his house and communicated with the police. They have since been
  identified by Mr. Harland as his property, and he is to be congratulated on
  the fact that the discovery was made by so cultivated and conscientious a
  person."</p>

  <p>The above paragraph was read with very different feelings by different
  readers. To the four conspirators, and to the public at large, it only made
  the mystery more profound. One man alone read in it nothing more than the
  final closing of a painful chapter. Laying down the paper, that man--a
  simple, white-haired bargeman--closed his eyes, and recalled the tragic
  incidents of a stormy night some seven months ago. He saw himself on his
  little barge, breasting the waters of the dark estuary, alone with his
  turbulent, drunken wife. He saw her, in a fit of wild passion, rush down to
  the cabin for the old-fashioned service revolver that he had foolishly kept
  there. He saw her struggle out of the little hatch, gibbering and
  threatening. He saw the flash and heard the loud report as she fell sprawling
  on the deck, and recalled his stony horror as he stood looking down at her
  corpse. And then, that marvellous interposition of Providence! The mysterious
  bumping and tapping against the barge's side; the floating coffin, so weirdly
  opportune; and then that great wonder when, having painfully hauled it on
  deck and unscrewed the lid, his knife, ripping open the lead case, had
  revealed no corpse, but a mere collection of crockery! He recalled the
  dreadful exchange, the hollow splash as the coffin went once more adrift; the
  secret landing on the Blyth Sand; the careful interment of the china at
  high-water mark, and the tremulously-spoken, though casuistically true report
  which he had circulated next day that his old woman had slipped overboard in
  the darkness. He recalled it all clearly with a sigh that was not wholly
  regretful; then he opened his eyes, folded the newspaper and closed the
  chapter for ever.</p>

  <p class="first">MR. PERCIVAL BLAND was a somewhat uncommon type of criminal.
  In the first place he really had an appreciable amount of common-sense. If he
  had only had a little more, he would not have been a criminal at all. As it
  was, he had just sufficient judgment to perceive that the consequences of
  unlawful acts accumulate as the acts are repeated; to realise that the
  criminal's position must, at length, become untenable; and to take what he
  considered fair precautions against the inevitable catastrophe.</p>

  <p>But in spite of these estimable traits of character and the precautions
  aforesaid, Mr. Bland found himself in rather a tight place and with a
  prospect of increasing tightness. The causes of this uncomfortable tension do
  not concern us, and may be dismissed with the remark, that, if one
  perseveringly distributes flash Bank of England notes among the
  money-changers of the Continent, there will come a day of reckoning when
  those notes are tendered to the exceedingly knowing old lady who lives in
  Threadneedle Street.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bland considered uneasily the approaching storm-cloud as he raked over
  the "miscellaneous property" in the Sale-rooms of Messrs. Plimpton. He was a
  confirmed frequenter of auctions, as was not unnatural, for the criminal is
  essentially a gambler. And criminal and gambler have one quality in common:
  each hopes to get something of value without paying the market price for
  it.</p>

  <p>So Percival turned over the dusty oddments and his own difficulties at one
  and the same time. The vital questions were: When would the storm burst? And
  would it pass by the harbour of refuge that he had been at such pains to
  construct? Let us inspect that harbour of refuge.</p>

  <p>A quiet flat in the pleasant neighbourhood of Battersea bore a name-plate
  inscribed, Mr. Robert Lindsay; and the tenant was known to the porter and the
  char woman who attended to the flat, as a fair-haired gentleman who was
  engaged in the book trade as a travelling agent, and was consequently a good
  deal away from home. Now Mr. Robert Lindsay bore a distinct resemblance to
  Percival Bland; which was not sur prising seeing that they were first cousins
  (or, at any rate, they said they were; and we may presume that they knew).
  But they were not very much alike. Mr. Lindsay had flaxen, or rather sandy,
  hair; Mr. Bland's hair was black. Mr. Bland had a mole under his left eye;
  Mr. Lindsay had no mole under his eye&mdash;but carried one in a small box in
  his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>At somewhat rare intervals the Cousins called on one another; but they had
  the very worst of luck, for neither of them ever seemed to find the other at
  home. And what was even more odd was that whenever Mr. Bland spent an evening
  at home in his lodgings over the oil shop in Bloomsbury, Mr. Lindsay's flat
  was empty; and as sure as Mr. Lindsay was at home in his flat so surely were
  Mr. Bland's lodgings vacant for the time being. It was a queer coincidence,
  if anyone had noticed it; but nobody ever did.</p>

  <p>However, if Percival saw little of his cousin, it was not a case of "out
  of sight, out of mind." On the contrary; so great was his solicitude for the
  latter's welfare that he not only had made a will constituting him his
  executor and sole legatee, but he had actually insured his life for no less a
  sum than three thousand pounds; and this will, together with the insurance
  policy, investment securities and other necessary documents, he had placed in
  the custody of a highly respectable solicitor. All of which did him great
  credit. It isn't every man who is willing to take so much trouble for a mere
  cousin.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bland continued his perambulations, pawing over the miscellaneous
  raffle from sheer force of habit, reflecting on the coming crisis in his own
  affairs, and on the provisions that he had made for his cousin Robert. As for
  the latter, they were excellent as far as they went, but they lacked
  definiteness and perfect completeness. There was the contingency of a
  "stretch," for instance; say fourteen years' penal servitude. The insurance
  policy did not cover that. And, meanwhile, what was to become of the
  estimable Robert?</p>

  <p>He had bruised his thumb somewhat severely in a screw-cutting lathe, and
  had abstractedly turned the handle of a bird-organ until politely requested
  by an attendant to desist, when he came upon a series of boxes containing,
  according to the catalogue, "a collection of surgical instruments the
  property of a lately deceased practitioner." To judge by the appearance of
  the instruments, the practitioner must have commenced practice in his early
  youth and died at a very advanced age. They were an uncouth set of tools, of
  no value whatever excepting as testimonials to the amazing tenacity of life
  of our ancestors; but Percival fingered them over according to his wont,
  working the handle of a complicated brass syringe and ejecting a drop of
  greenish fluid on to the shirt of a dressy Hebrew (who requested him to
  "point the dam' thing at thomeone elth nectht time"), opening musty leather
  cases, clicking off spring scarifiers and feeling the edges of strange,
  crooked, knives. Then he came upon a largish black box, which, when he raised
  the lid, breathed out an ancient and fish-like aroma and exhibited a
  collection of bones, yellow, greasy and spotted in places with mildew. The
  catalogue described them as "a complete set of human osteology" but they were
  not an ordinary "student's set," for the bones of the hands and feet, instead
  of being strung together on cat-gut, were united by their original ligaments
  and were of an unsavoury brown colour.</p>

  <p>"I thay, misther," expostulated the Hebrew, "shut that bocth. Thmellth
  like a blooming inquetht."</p>

  <p>But the contents of the black box seemed to have a fascination for
  Percival. He looked in at those greasy remnants of mortality, at the brown
  and mouldy hands and feet and the skull that peeped forth eerily from the
  folds of a flannel wrapping; and they breathed out something more than that
  stale and musty odour. A suggestion&mdash;vague and general at first, but
  rapidly crystallising into distinct shape&mdash;seemed to steal out of the
  black box into his consciousness; a suggestion that somehow seemed to connect
  itself with his estimable cousin Robert.</p>

  <p>For upwards of a minute he stood motionless, as one immersed in reverie,
  the lid poised in his hand and a dreamy eye fixed on the half skull. A stir
  in the room roused him. The sale was about to begin. The members of the
  knock-out and other habitus seated themselves on benches around a long,
  baize table; the attendants took possession of the first lots and opened
  their catalogues as if about to sing an introductory chorus; and a gentleman
  with a waxed moustache and a striking resemblance to his late Majesty, the
  third Napoleon, having ascended to the rostrum bespoke the attention of the
  assembly by a premonitory tap with his hammer.</p>

  <p>How odd are some of the effects of a guilty conscience! With what absurd
  self-consciousness do we read into the minds of others our own undeclared
  intentions, when those intentions are unlawful! Had Percival Bland wanted a
  set of human bones for any legitimate purpose&mdash;such as anatomical
  study&mdash;he would have bought it openly and unembarrassed. Now, he found
  himself earnestly debating whether he should not bid for some of the surgical
  instruments, just for the sake of appearances; and there being little time in
  which to make up his mind&mdash;for the deceased practitioner's effects came
  first in the catalogue&mdash;he was already the richer by a set of
  cupping-glasses, a tooth-key, and an instrument of unknown use and diabolical
  aspect, before the fateful lot was called.</p>

  <p>At length the black box was laid on the table, an object of obscene mirth
  to the knockers-out, and the auctioneer read the entry: "Lot seventeen; a
  complete set of human osteology. A very useful and valuable set of specimens,
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>He looked round at the assembly majestically, oblivious of sundry
  inquiries as to the identity of the deceased and the verdict of the coroner's
  jury, and finally suggested five shillings.</p>

  <p>"Six," said Percival.</p>

  <p>An attendant held the box open, and, chanting the mystic word "Loddlemen!"
  (which, being interpreted, meant "Lot, gentlemen"), thrust it under the
  rather bulbous nose of the smart Hebrew; who remarked that "they 'ummed a bit
  too much to thoot him" and pushed it away.</p>

  <p>"Going at six shillings," said the auctioneer, reproachfully; and as
  nobody contradicted him, he smote the rostrum with his hammer and the box was
  delivered into the hands of Percival on the payment of that modest sum.</p>

  <p>Having crammed the cupping-glasses, the tooth-key and the unknown
  instrument into the box, Percival obtained from one of the attendants a
  length of cord, with which he secured the lid. Then he carried his treasure
  out into the street, and, chartering a four-wheeler, directed the driver to
  proceed to Charing Cross Station. At the station he booked the box in the
  cloak (in the name of Simpson) and left it for a couple of hours; at the
  expiration of which he returned, and, employing a different porters had it
  conveyed to a hansom, in which it was borne to his lodgings over the oil-shop
  in Bloomsbury. There he, himself, carried it, unobserved, up the stairs, and,
  depositing it in a large cupboard, locked the door and pocketed the key.</p>

  <p>And thus was the curtain rung down on the first act. The second act opened
  only a couple of days later, the office of call-boy&mdash;to pursue the
  metaphor to the bitter end&mdash;being discharged by a Belgian police
  official who emerged from the main entrance to the Bank of England. What
  should have led Percival Bland into so unsafe a neighbourhood it is difficult
  to imagine, unless it was that strange fascination that seems so frequently
  to lure the criminal to places associated with his crime. But there he was
  within a dozen paces of the entrance when the officer came forth, and mutual
  recognition was instant. Almost equally instantaneous was the self-possessed
  Percival's decision to cross the road.</p>

  <p>It is not a nice road to cross. The old horse would condescend to shout a
  warning to the indiscreet wayfarer. Not so the modern chauffeur, who looks
  stonily before him and leaves you to get out of the way of Juggernaut. He
  knows his "exonerating" coroner's jury. At the moment, however, the
  procession of Juggernauts was at rest; but Percival had seen the presiding
  policeman turn to move away and he darted across the fronts of the vehicles
  even as they started. The foreign officer followed. But in that moment the
  whole procession had got in motion. A motor omnibus thundered past in front
  of him; another was bearing down on him relentlessly. He hesitated, and
  sprang back; and then a taxi-cab, darting out from behind, butted him
  heavily, sending him sprawling in the road, whence he scrambled as best he
  could back on to the pavement.</p>

  <p>Percival, meanwhile, had swung himself lightly on to the footboard of the
  first omnibus just as it was gathering speed. A few seconds saw him safely
  across at the Mansion House, and in a few more, he was whirling down Queen
  Victoria Street. The danger was practically over, though he took the
  precaution to alight at St. Paul's, and, crossing to Newgate Street, board
  another west-bound omnibus.</p>

  <p>That night he sat in his lodgings turning over his late experience. It had
  been a narrow shave. That sort of thing mustn't happen again. In fact, seeing
  that the law was undoubtedly about to be set in motion, it was high time that
  certain little plans of his should be set in motion, too. Only, there was a
  difficulty; a serious difficulty. And as Percival thought round and round
  that difficulty his brows wrinkled and he hummed a soft refrain.</p>

  <p>"Then is the time for disappearing,<br></p>

  <p>Take a header&mdash;down you go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A tap at the door cut his song short. It was his landlady, Mrs. Brattle; a
  civil woman, and particularly civil just now. For she had a little request to
  make.</p>

  <p>"It was about Christmas Night, Mr. Bland," said Mrs. Brattle. "My husband
  and me thought of spending the evening with his brother at Hornsey, and we
  were going to let the maid go home to her mother's for the night, if it
  wouldn't put you out."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't put me out in the least, Mrs. Brattle," said Percival.</p>

  <p>"You needn't sit up for us, you see," pursued Mrs. Brattle, "if you just
  leave the side door unbolted. We shan't be home before two or three; but
  we'll come in quiet not to disturb you."</p>

  <p>"You won't disturb me," Percival replied with a genial laugh. "I'm a sober
  man in general but 'Christmas comes but once a year'. When once I'm tucked up
  in bed, I shall take a bit of waking on Christmas Night."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brattle smiled indulgently. "And you won't feel lonely, all alone in
  the house?"</p>

  <p>"Lonely!" exclaimed Percival. "Lonely! With a roaring fire, a jolly book,
  a box of good cigars and a bottle of sound port&mdash;ah, and a second bottle
  if need be. Not I."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brattle shook her head. "Ah," said she, "you bachelors! Well, well.
  It's a good thing to be independent," and with this profound reflection she
  smiled herself out of the room and descended the stairs.</p>

  <p>As her footsteps died away Percival sprang from his chair and began
  excitedly to pace the room. His eyes sparkled and his face was wreathed with
  smiles. Presently he halted before the fireplace and, gazing into the embers,
  laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>"Damn funny!" said he. "Deuced rich! Neat! Very neat! Ha! Ha!" And here he
  resumed his interrupted song: "When the sky above is clearing, When the sky
  above is clearing, Bob up serenely, bob up serenely, Bob up serenely from
  below!"</p>

  <p>Which may be regarded as closing the first scene, of the second act.</p>

  <p>During the few days that intervened before Christmas Percival went abroad
  but little; and yet he was a busy man. He did a little surreptitious
  shopping, venturing out as far as Charing Cross Road; and his purchases were
  decidedly miscellaneous. A porridge saucepan, a second-hand copy of "Gray's
  Anatomy," a rabbit skin, a large supply of glue and upwards of ten pounds of
  shin of beef seems a rather odd assortment; and it was a mercy that the
  weather was frosty, for otherwise Percival's bedroom, in which these
  delicacies were deposited under lock and key, would have yielded odorous
  traces of its wealth.</p>

  <p>But it was in the long evenings that his industry was most conspicuous;
  and then it was that the big cupboard with the excellent lever lock, which he
  himself had fixed on, began to fill up with the fruits of his labours. In
  those evenings the porridge saucepan would simmer on the hob with a rich
  lading of good Scotch glue, the black box of the deceased practitioner would
  be hauled forth from its hiding-place, and the well-thumbed "Gray" laid open
  on the table.</p>

  <p>It was an arduous business though; a stiffer task than he had bargained
  for. The right and left bones were so confoundedly alike, and the bones that
  joined were so difficult to fit together. However, the plates in "Gray" were
  large and very clear, so it was only a question of taking enough trouble.</p>

  <p>His method of work was simple and practical. Having fished a bone out of
  the box, he would compare it with the illustrations in the book until he had
  identified it beyond all doubt, when he would tie on it a paper label with
  its name and side&mdash;right or left. Then he would search for the adjoining
  bone, and, having fitted the two together, would secure them with a good daub
  of glue and lay them in the fender to dry. It was a crude and horrible method
  of articulation that would have made a museum curator shudder. But it seemed
  to answer Percival's purpose&mdash;whatever that may have been&mdash;for
  gradually the loose "items" came together into recognisable members such as
  arms and legs, the vertebra&mdash;which were, fortunately, strung in their
  order on a thick cord&mdash;were joined up into a solid backbone, and even
  the ribs, which were the toughest job of all, fixed on in some semblance of a
  thorax. It was a wretched performance. The bones were plastered with gouts of
  glue and yet would have broken apart at a touch. But, as we have said,
  Percival seemed satisfied, and as he was the only person concerned, there was
  no more to be said.</p>

  <p>In due course, Christmas Day arrived. Percival dined with the Brattles at
  two, dozed after dinner, woke up for tea, and then, as Mrs. Brattle, in
  purple and fine raiment, came in to remove the tea-tray, he spread out on the
  table the materials for the night's carouse. A quarter of an hour later, the
  side slammed, and, peering out of the window, he saw the shopkeeper and his
  wife hurrying away up the gas-lit street towards the nearest omnibus
  route.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Percival Bland began his evening's entertainment; and a most
  remark entertainment it was, even for a solitary bachelor, left alone in a
  house on Christmas Night. First, he took off his clothing and dressed himself
  in a fresh suit. Then, from the cupboard he brought forth the reconstituted
  "set of osteology" and, laying the various members on the table, returned to
  the bedroom, whence he presently reappeared with a large, savoury parcel
  which he had disinterred from a trunk. The parcel being opened revealed his
  accumulated purchases in the matter of shin of beef.</p>

  <p>With a large knife, providently sharpened before hand, he cut the beef
  into large, thin slices which he proceed to wrap around the various bones
  that formed the "complete set;" whereby their nakedness was certainly
  mitigated though their attractiveness was by no means increased. Having thus
  "clothed the dry bones," he gathered up the scraps of offal that were left,
  to be placed presently inside the trunk. It was an extraordinary proceeding,
  but the next was more extraordinary still.</p>

  <p>Taking up the newly clothed members one by one, he began very carefully to
  insinuate them into the garments that he had recently shed. It was a ticklish
  business, for the glued joints were as brittle as glass. Very cautiously the
  legs were separately inducted, first into underclothing and then into
  trousers, the skeleton feet were fitted with the cast-off socks and
  delicately persuaded into the boots. The arms, in like manner, were gingerly
  pressed into their various sleeves and through the arm-holes of the
  waistcoat; and then came the most difficult task of all&mdash;to fit the
  garments on the trunk. For the skull and ribs, secured to the back-bone with
  mere spots of glue, were ready to drop off at a shake; and yet the garments
  had to be drawn over them with the arms enclosed in the sleeves. But Percival
  managed it at last by resting his "restoration" in the big, padded arm-chair
  and easing the garments on inch by inch.</p>

  <p>It now remained only to give the finishing touch; which was done by
  cutting the rabbit-skin to the requisite shape and affixing it to the skull
  with a thin coat of stiff glue; and when the skull had thus been finished
  with a sort of crude, makeshift wig, its appearance was so appalling as even
  to disturb the nerves of the matter-of-fact Percival. However, this was no
  occasion for cherishing sentiment. A skull in an extemporised wig or false
  scalp might be, and in fact was, a highly unpleasant object; but so was a
  Belgian police officer.</p>

  <p>Having finished the "restoration," Percival fetched the water-jug from his
  bedroom, and, descending to the shop, the door of which had been left
  unlocked, tried the taps of the various drums and barrels until he came to
  the one which contained methylated spirit; and from this he filled his jug
  and returned to the bedroom. Pouring the spirit out into the basin, he tucked
  a towel round his neck and filling his sponge with spirit proceeded very
  vigorously to wash his hair and eyebrows; and as, by degrees, the spirit in
  the basin grew dark and turbid, so did his hair and eyebrows grow lighter in
  colour until, after a final energetic rub with a towel, they had acquired a
  golden or sandy hue indistinguishable from that of the hair of his cousin
  Robert. Even the mole under his eye was susceptible to the changing
  conditions, for when he had wetted it thoroughly with spirit, he was able,
  with the blade of a penknife to peel it off as neatly as if it had been stuck
  on with spirit-gum. Having done which, he deposited it in a tiny box which he
  carried in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

  <p>The proceedings which followed were unmistakable as to their object. First
  he carried the basin of spirit through into the sitting-room and deliberately
  poured its contents on to the floor by the arm-chair. Then, having returned
  the basin to the bedroom, he again went down to the shop, where he selected a
  couple of galvanised buckets from the stock, filled them with paraffin oil
  from one of the great drums and carried them upstairs. The oil from one
  bucket he poured over the armchair and its repulsive occupant; the other
  bucket he simply emptied on the carpet, and then went down to the shop for a
  fresh supply.</p>

  <p>When this proceeding had been repeated once or twice the entire floor and
  all the furniture were saturated, and such a reek of paraffin filled the air
  of the room that Percival thought it wise to turn out the gas. Returning to
  the shop, be poured a bucketful of oil over the stack of bundles of firewood,
  another over the counter and floor and a third over the loose articles on the
  walls and hanging from the ceiling. Looking up at the latter be now perceived
  a number of greasy patches where the oil had soaked through from the floor
  above, and some of these were beginning to drip on to the shop floor.</p>

  <p>He now made his final preparations. Taking a bundle of "Wheel"
  firelighters, he made a small pile against the stack of firewood. In the
  midst of the firelighters he placed a ball of string saturated in paraffin;
  and in the central hole of the ball he stuck a half-dozen diminutive
  Christmas candles. This mine was now ready. Providing himself with a stock of
  firelighters, a few balls of paraffined string and a dozen or so of the
  little candles, he went upstairs to the sitting-room, which was immediately
  above the shop. Here, by the glow of the fire, he built up one or two piles
  of firelighters around and partly under the arm-chair, placed the balls of
  string on the piles and stuck two or three bundles in each ball. Everything
  was now ready. Stepping into the bedroom, he took from the cupboard a spare
  overcoat, a new hat and a new umbrella&mdash;for he must leave his old hats,
  coat and umbrella in the hall. He put on the coat and hat, and, with the
  umbrella in his hand, returned to the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>Opposite the arm-chair he stood awhile, irresolute, and a pang of horror
  shot through him. It was a terrible thing that he was going to do; a thing
  the consequences of which no one could foresee. He glanced furtively at the
  awful shape that sat huddled in the chair, its horrible head all awry and its
  rigid limbs sprawling in hideous grotesque deformity. It was but a dummy, a
  mere scarecrow; but yet, in the dim firelight, the grisly face under that
  horrid wig seemed to leer intelligently, to watch him with secret malice out
  of its shadowy eye-sockets, until he looked away with clammy skin and a
  shiver of half-superstitious terror.</p>

  <p>But this would never do. The evening had run out, consumed by these
  engrossing labours; it was nearly eleven o'clock, and high time for him to be
  gone. For if the Brattles should return prematurely he was lost. Pulling
  himself together with an effort, he struck a match and lit the little candles
  one after the other. In a quarter of an hour or so, they would have burned
  down to the balls of string, and then&mdash;He walked quickly out of the
  room; but, at the door, he paused for a moment to look back at the ghastly
  figure, seated rigidly in the chair with the lighted candles at its feet,
  like some foul fiend appeased by votive fires. The unsteady flames threw
  flickering shadows on its face that made it seem to mow and gibber and grin
  in mockery of all his care and caution. So he turned and tremblingly ran down
  the stairs&mdash;opening the staircase window as he went. Running into the
  shop, he lit the candles there and ran out again, shutting the door after
  him.</p>

  <p>Secretly and guiltily he crept down the hall, and opening the door a few
  inches peered out. A blast of icy wind poured in with a light powdering of
  dry snow. He opened his umbrella, flung open the door, looked up and down the
  empty street, stepped out, closed the door softly and strode away over the
  whitening pavement.</p>

  <h3>PART II</h3>

  <h3>(Related by Christopher Jervis, M.D.)</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was one of the axioms of medico-legal practice laid down
  by my colleague, John Thorndyke, that the investigator should be constantly
  on his guard against the effect of suggestion. Not only must all prejudices
  and preconceptions be avoided, but when information is received from outside,
  the actual, undeniable facts must be carefully sifted from the inferences
  which usually accompany them. Of the necessity for this precaution our
  insurance practice furnished an excellent instance in the case of the fire at
  Mr. Brattle's oil-shop.</p>

  <p>The case was brought to our notice by Mr. Stalker of the Griffin Fire and
  Life Insurance Society a few days after Christmas. He dropped in, ostensibly
  to wish us a Happy New Year, but a discreet pause in the conversation on
  Thorndyke's part elicited a further purpose.</p>

  <p>"Did you see the account of that fire in Bloomsbury?" Mr. Stalker
  asked.</p>

  <p>"The oil-shop? Yes. But I didn't note any details, excepting that a man
  was apparently burnt to death and that the affair happened on the
  twenty-fifth of December."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," said Mr. Stalker. "It seems uncharitable, but one can't
  help looking a little askance at these quarter-day fires. And the date isn't
  the only doubtful feature in this one; the Divisional Officer of the Fire
  Brigade, who has looked over the ruins, tells me that there are some
  appearances suggesting that the fire broke out in two different
  places&mdash;the shop and the first-floor room over it. Mind you, he doesn't
  say that it actually did. The place is so thoroughly gutted that very little
  is to be learned from it; but that is his impression; and it occurred to me
  that if you were to take a look at the ruins, your radiographic eye might
  detect something that he had overlooked."</p>

  <p>"It isn't very likely," said Thorndyke. "Every man to his trade. The
  Divisional Officer looks at a burnt house with an expert eye, which I do not.
  My evidence would not carry much weight if you were contesting the
  claim."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," replied Mr. Stalker, "and we are not anxious to contest the
  claim unless there is manifest fraud. Arson is a serious matter."</p>

  <p>"It is wilful murder in this case," remarked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I know," said Stalker. "And that reminds me that the man who was burnt
  happens to have been insured in our office, too. So we stand a double
  loss."</p>

  <p>"How much?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"The dead man, Percival Bland, had insured his life for three thousand
  pounds."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke became thoughtful. The last statement had apparently made more
  impression on him than the former ones.</p>

  <p>"If you want me to look into the case for you," said he, "you had better
  let me have all the papers connected with it, including the proposal
  forms."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stalker smiled. "I thought you would say that&mdash;I know you of old,
  you see&mdash;so I slipped the papers in my pocket before coming here."</p>

  <p>He laid the documents on the table and asked: "Is there anything that you
  want to know about the case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke. "I want to know all that you can tell me."</p>

  <p>"Which is mighty little," said Stalker; "but such as it is, you shall have
  it.</p>

  <p>"The oil-shop man's name is Brattle and the dead man, Bland, was his
  lodger. Bland appears to have been a perfectly steady, sober man in general;
  but it seems that he had announced his intention of spending a jovial
  Christmas Night and giving himself a little extra indulgence. He was last
  seen by Mrs. Brattle at about half-past six, sitting by a blazing fire, with
  a couple of unopened bottles of port on the table and a box of cigars. He had
  a book in his hand and two or three newspapers lay on the floor by his chair.
  Shortly after this, Mr. and Mrs. Brattle went out on a visit to Hornsey,
  leaving him alone in the house."</p>

  <p>"Was there no servant?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"The servant had the day and night off duty to go to her mother's. That,
  by the way, looks a trifle fishy. However, to return to the Brattles; they
  spent the evening at Hornsey and did not get home until past three in the
  morning, by which time their house was a heap of smoking ruins. Mrs.
  Brattle's idea is that Bland must have drunk himself sleepy, and dropped one
  of the newspapers into the fender, where a chance cinder may have started the
  blaze. Which may or may not be the true explanation. Of course, an habitually
  sober man can get pretty mimsey on two bottles of port."</p>

  <p>"What time did the fire break out?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"It was noticed about half-past eleven that flames were issuing from one
  of the chimneys, and the alarm was given at once. The first engine arrived
  ten minutes later, but, by that time, the place was roaring like a furnace.
  Then the water-plugs were found to be frozen hard, which caused some delay;
  in fact, before the engines were able to get to work the roof had fallen in,
  and the place was a mere shell. You know what an oil-shop is, when once it
  gets a fair start."</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Bland's body was found in the ruins, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Body!" exclaimed Mr. Stalker; "there wasn't much body! Just a few charred
  bones, which they dug out of the ashes next day."</p>

  <p>"And the question of identity?"</p>

  <p>"We shall leave that to the coroner. But there really isn't any question.
  To begin with, there was no one else in the house; and then the remains were
  found mixed up with the springs and castors of the chair that Bland was
  sitting in when he was last seen. Moreover, there were found, with the bones,
  a pocket knife, a bunch of keys and a set of steel waistcoat buttons, all
  identified by Mrs. Brattle as belonging to Bland. She noticed the cut steel
  buttons on his waistcoat when she wished him 'good-night.'"</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "was Bland reading by the light of an oil
  lamp?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Stalker. "There was a two-branch gasalier with a porcelain
  shade to one burner, and he had that burner alight when Mrs. Brattle
  left."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflectively picked up the proposal form, and, having glanced
  through it, remarked: "I see that Bland is described as unmarried. Do you
  know why he insured his life for this large amount?"</p>

  <p>"No; we assumed that it was probably in connection with some loan that he
  had raised. I learn from the solicitor who notified us of the death, that the
  whole of Bland's property is left to a cousin&mdash;a Mr. Lindsay, I think.
  So the probability is that this cousin had lent him money. But it is not the
  life claim that is interesting us. We must pay that in any case. It is the
  fire claim that we want you to look into."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke; "I will go round presently and look over the
  ruins, and see if I can detect any substantial evidence of fraud."</p>

  <p>"If you would," said Mr. Stalker, rising to take his departure, "we should
  be very much obliged. Not that we shall probably contest the claim in any
  case."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, my colleague and I glanced through the papers, and I
  ventured to remark: "It seems to me that Stalker doesn't quite appreciate the
  possibilities of this case."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed. "But, of course, it is an insurance company's
  business to pay, and not to boggle at anything short of glaring fraud. And we
  specialists too," he added with a smile, "must beware of seeing too much. I
  suppose that, to a rhinologist, there is hardly such a thing as a healthy
  nose&mdash;unless it is his own&mdash;and the uric acid specialist is very
  apt to find the firmament studded with dumb-bell crystals. We mustn't forget
  that normal cases do exist, after all."</p>

  <p>"That is true," said I; "but, on the other hand, the rhinologist's
  business is with the unhealthy nose, and our concern is with abnormal
  cases."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke laughed. "'A Daniel come to judgement,'" said he. "But my
  learned friend is quite right. Our function is to pick holes. So let us
  pocket the documents and wend Bloomsbury way. We can talk the case over as we
  go."</p>

  <p>We walked at an easy pace, for there was no hurry, and a little
  preliminary thought was useful. After a while, as Thorndyke made no remark, I
  reopened the subject.</p>

  <p>"How does the case present itself to you?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Much as it does to you, I expect," he replied. "The circumstances invite
  inquiry, and I do not find myself connecting them with the shopkeeper. It is
  true that the fire occurred on quarter-day; but there is nothing to show that
  the insurance will do more than cover the loss of stock, chattels and the
  profits of trade. The other circumstances are much more suggestive. Here is a
  house burned down and a man killed. That man was insured for three thousand
  pounds, and, consequently, some person stands to gain by his death to that
  amount. The whole set of circumstances is highly favourable to the idea of
  homicide. The man was alone in the house when he died; and the total
  destruction of both the body and its surroundings seems to render
  investigation impossible. The cause of death can only be inferred; it cannot
  be proved; and the most glaring evidence of a crime will have vanished
  utterly. I think that there is a quite strong prima facie suggestion of
  murder. Under the known conditions, the perpetration of a murder would have
  been easy, it would have been safe from detection, and there is an adequate
  motive.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, suicide is not impossible. The man might have set fire
  to the house and then killed himself by poison or otherwise. But it is
  intrinsically less probable that a man should kill him self for another
  person's benefit than that he should kill another man for his own
  benefit.</p>

  <p>"Finally, there is the possibility that the fire and the man's death were
  the result of accident; against which is the official opinion that the fire
  started in two places. If this opinion is correct, it establishes, in my
  opinion, a strong presumption of murder against some person who may have
  obtained access to the house."</p>

  <p>This point in the discussion brought us to the ruined house, which stood
  at the corner of two small streets. One of the firemen in charge admitted us,
  when we had shown our credentials, through a temporary door and down a ladder
  into the basement, where we found a number of men treading gingerly, ankle
  deep in white ash, among a litter of charred wood-work, fused glass, warped
  and broken china, and more or less recognisable metal objects.</p>

  <p>"The coroner and the jury," the fireman explained; "come to view the scene
  of the disaster." He introduced us to the former, who bowed stiffly and
  continued his investigations.</p>

  <p>"These," said the other fireman, "are the springs of the chair that the
  deceased was sitting in. We found the body&mdash;or rather the
  bones&mdash;lying among them under a heap of hot ashes; and we found the
  buttons of his clothes and the things from his pockets among the ashes, too.
  You'll see them in the mortuary with the remains."</p>

  <p>"It must have been a terrific blaze," one of the jurymen remarked. "Just
  look at this, sir," and he handed to Thorndyke what looked like part of a
  gas-fitting, of which the greater part was melted into shapeless lumps and
  the remainder encrusted into fused porcelain.</p>

  <p>"That," said the fireman, "was the gasalier of the first-floor room, where
  Mr. Bland was sitting. Ah! you won't turn that tap, sir; nobody'll ever turn
  that tap again."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke held the twisted mass of brass towards me in silence, and,
  glancing up the blackened walls, remarked: "I think we shall have to come
  here again with the Divisional Officer, but meanwhile, we had better see the
  remains of the body. It is just possible that we may learn something from
  them."</p>

  <p>He applied to the coroner for the necessary authority to make the
  inspection, and, having obtained a rather ungracious and grudging permission
  to examine the remains when the jury had "viewed" them, began to ascend the
  ladder.</p>

  <p>"Our friend would have liked to refuse permission," he remarked when we
  had emerged into the street, "but he knew that I could and should have
  insisted."</p>

  <p>"So I gathered from his manner," said I. "But what is he doing here? This
  isn't his district."</p>

  <p>"No; he is acting for Bettsford, who is laid up just now; and a very poor
  substitute he is. A non-medical coroner is an absurdity in any case, and a
  coroner who is hostile to the medical profession is a public scandal. By the
  way, that gas-tap offers a curious problem. You noticed that it was turned
  off?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And consequently that the deceased was sitting in the dark when the fire
  broke out. I don't see the bearing of the fact, but it is certainly rather
  odd. Here is the mortuary. We had better wait and let the jury go in
  first."</p>

  <p>We had not long to wait. In a couple of minutes or so the "twelve good men
  and true" made their appearance with a small attendant crowd of ragamuffins.
  We let them enter first, and then we followed. The mortuary was a good-sized
  room, well lighted by a glass roof, and having at its centre a long table on
  which lay the shell containing the remains. There was also a sheet of paper
  on which had been laid out a set of blackened steel waistcoat buttons, a
  bunch of keys, a steel-handled pocket-knife, a steel-cased watch on a
  partly-fused rolled-gold chain, and a pocket corkscrew. The coroner drew the
  attention of the jury to these objects, and then took possession of them,
  that they might be identified by witnesses. And meanwhile the jurymen
  gathered round the shell and stared shudderingly at its gruesome
  contents.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, gentlemen," said the coroner, "to have to subject you to this
  painful ordeal. But duty is duty. We must hope, as I think we may, that this
  poor creature met a painless if in some respects a rather terrible
  death."</p>

  <p>At this point, Thorndyke, who had drawn near to the table, cast a long and
  steady glance down into the shell; and immediately his ordinarily rather
  impassive face seemed to congeal; all expression faded from it, leaving it as
  immovable and uncommunicative as the granite face of an Egyptian statue. I
  knew the symptom of old and began to speculate on its present
  significance.</p>

  <p>"Are you taking any medical evidence?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Medical evidence!" the coroner repeated, scornfully. "Certainly not, sir!
  I do not waste the public money by employing so-called experts to tell the
  jury what each of them can see quite plainly for himself. I imagine," he
  added, turning to the foreman, "that you will not require a learned doctor to
  explain to you how that poor fellow mortal met his death?"</p>

  <p>And the foreman, glancing askance at the skull, replied, with a pallid and
  sickly smile, that "he thought not."</p>

  <p>"Do you, sir," the coroner continued, with a dramatic wave of the hand
  towards the plain coffin, "suppose that we shall find any difficulty in
  determining how that man came by his death?"</p>

  <p>"I imagine," replied Thorndyke, without moving a muscle, or, indeed,
  appearing to have any muscles to move, "I imagine you will find no difficulty
  what ever."</p>

  <p>"So do I," said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"Then," retorted Thorndyke, with a faint, inscrutable smile, "we are, for
  once, in complete agreement."</p>

  <p>As the coroner and jury retired, leaving my colleague and me alone in the
  mortuary, Thorndyke remarked: "I suppose this kind of farce will be repeated
  periodically so long as these highly technical medical inquiries continue to
  be conducted by lay persons."</p>

  <p>I made no reply, for I had taken a long look into the shell, and was lost
  in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"But my dear Thorndyke!" I exclaimed; "what on earth does it mean? Are we
  to suppose that a woman can have palmed herself off as a man on the examining
  medical officer of a London Life Assurance Society?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "I think not," said he. "Our friend, Mr. Bland,
  may conceivably have been a woman in disguise, but he certainly was not a
  negress."</p>

  <p>"A negress!" I gasped. "By Jove! So it is! I hadn't looked at the skull.
  But that only makes the mystery more mysterious. Because, you remember, the
  body was certainly dressed in Bland's clothes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, there seems to be no doubt about that. And you may have noticed, as
  I did," Thorndyke continued dryly, "the remarkably fire-proof character of
  the waistcoat buttons, watch-case, knife-handle, and other identifiable
  objects."</p>

  <p>"But what a horrible affair!" I exclaimed. "The brute must have gone out
  and enticed some poor devil of a negress into the house, have murdered her in
  cold blood and then deliberately dressed the corpse in his own clothes! It is
  perfectly frightful!"</p>

  <p>Again Thorndyke shook his head. "It wasn't as bad as that, Jervis," said
  he, "though I must confess that I feel strongly tempted to let your
  hypothesis stand. It would be quite amusing to put Mr. Bland on trial for the
  murder of an unknown negress, and let him explain the facts himself. But our
  reputation is at stake. Look at the bones again and a little more critically.
  You very probably looked for the sex first; then you looked for racial
  characters. Now carry your investigations a step farther."</p>

  <p>"There is the stature," said I. "But that is of no importance, as these
  are not Bland's bones. The only other point that I notice is that the fire
  seems to have acted very unequally on the different parts of the body."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke, "and that is the point. Some parts are more burnt
  than others; and the parts which are burnt most are the wrong parts. Look at
  the back-bone, for instance. The vertebrae are as white as chalk. They are
  mere masses of bone ash. But, of all parts of the skeleton, there is none so
  completely protected from fire as the back-bone, with the great dorsal
  muscles behind, and the whole mass of the viscera in front. Then look at the
  skull. Its appearance is quite inconsistent with the suggested facts. The
  bones of the face are bare and calcined and the orbits contain not a trace of
  the eyes or other structures; and yet there is a charred mass of what may or
  may not be scalp adhering to the crown. But the scalp, as the most exposed
  and the thinnest covering, would be the first to be destroyed, while the last
  to be consumed would be the structures about the jaws and the base, of which,
  you see, not a vestige is left."</p>

  <p>Here he lifted the skull carefully from the shell, and, peering in through
  the great foramen at the base, handed it to me.</p>

  <p>"Look in," he said, "through the Foramen Magnum&mdash;you will see better
  if you hold the orbits towards the skylight&mdash;and notice an even more
  extreme inconsistency with the supposed conditions. The brain and membranes
  have vanished without leaving a trace. The inside of the skull is as clean as
  if it had been macerated. But this is impossible. The brain is not only
  protected from the fire; it is also protected from contact with the air. But
  without access of oxygen, although it might become carbonised, it could not
  be consumed. No, Jervis; it won't do."</p>

  <p>I replaced the skull in the coffin and looked at him in surprise. "What is
  it that you are suggesting?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I suggest that this was not a body at all, but merely a dry
  skeleton."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "what about those masses of what looks like charred
  muscle adhering to the bones?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "I have been noticing them. They do, as you say, look
  like masses of charred muscle. But they are quite shapeless and
  structureless; I cannot identify a single muscle or muscular group; and there
  is not a vestige of any of the tendons. Moreover, the distribution is false.
  For instance, will you tell me what muscle you think that is?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to a thick, charred mass on the inner surface of the left tibia
  or shin-bone. "Now this portion of the bone&mdash;as many a hockey-player has
  had reason to realise&mdash;has no muscular covering at all. It lies
  immediately under the skin."</p>

  <p>"I think you are right, Thorndyke," said I. "That lump of muscle in the
  wrong place gives the whole fraud away. But it was really a rather smart
  dodge. This fellow Bland must be an ingenious rascal."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke; "but an unscrupulous villain too. He might have
  burned down half the street and killed a score of people. He'll have to pay
  the piper for this little frolic."</p>

  <p>"What shall you do now? Are you going to notify the coroner?"</p>

  <p>"No; that is not my business. I think we will verify our conclusions and
  then inform our clients and the police. We must measure the skull as well as
  we can without callipers, but it is, fortunately, quite typical. The short,
  broad, flat nasal bones, with the 'Simian groove,' and those large, strong
  teeth, worn flat by hard and gritty food, are highly characteristic." He once
  more lifted out the skull, and, with a spring tape, made a few measurements,
  while I noted the lengths of the principal long bones and the width across
  the hips.</p>

  <p>"I make the cranial-nasal index 55," said he, as he replaced the skull,
  "and the cranial index about 72, which are quite representative numbers; and,
  as I see that your notes show the usual disproportionate length of arm and
  the characteristic curve of the tibia, we may be satisfied. But it is
  fortunate that the specimen is so typical. To the experienced eye, racial
  types have a physiognomy which is unmistakable on mere inspection. But you
  cannot transfer the experienced eye. You can only express personal conviction
  and back it up with measurements.</p>

  <p>"And now we will go and look in on Stalker, and inform him that his office
  has saved three thousand pounds by employing us. After which it will be
  Westward Ho! for Scotland Yard, to prepare an unpleasant little surprise for
  Mr. Percival Bland."</p>

  <p>There was joy among the journalists on the following day. Each of the
  morning papers devoted an entire column to an unusually detailed account of
  the inquest on the late Percival Bland&mdash;who, it appeared, met his death
  by misadventure&mdash;and a verbatim report of the coroner's eloquent remarks
  on the danger of solitary, fireside tippling, and the stupefying effects of
  port wine. An adjacent column contained an equally detailed account of the
  appearance of the deceased at Bow Street Police Court to answer complicated
  charges of arson, fraud and forgery; while a third collated the two accounts
  with gleeful commentaries.</p>

  <p>Mr. Percival Bland, alias Robert Lindsay, now resides on the breezy
  uplands of Dartmoor, where, in his abundant leisure, he, no doubt, regrets
  his misdirected ingenuity. But he has not laboured in vain. To the Lord
  Chancellor he has furnished an admirable illustration of the danger of
  appointing lay coroners; and to me an unforgettable warning against the
  effects of suggestion.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; THE ATTORNEY'S CONSCIENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">I SUPPOSE if I were a sensitive man I should not be writing
  this history; or, at any rate, should not contemplate its perusal by
  strangers. For no man cares to be written down a liar; and many will conceal
  an incredible truth rather than run the risk. However, of these
  hyper-sensitive folk I am not one. For a good many years now I have practised
  at the bar; and, if that fact offers no guarantee of unimpeachable veracity
  it at least furnishes presumptive evidence of a fairly robust moral
  epidermis. I may not be believed; but the frankest scepticism will leave me
  undisturbed and unabashed.</p>

  <p>My connection with the surprising events that I am about to record, began
  at the moment of my entering the shop of Mr. Reuben Solomon in Booksellers'
  Row. The "Row" has been swept away some years by a progressive County
  Council, and sorrowful ratepayers may look in through the palings and see
  very expensive wild flowers blooming--but not paying rates--upon its site.
  But in those days it was still standing, a happy hunting-ground for the
  bibliophile and a perennial joy to the urban artist; and Mr. Solomon's shop
  still gladdened the bookish eye with colossal black-letter folios, antique
  volumes in rusty calf and dainty, vellum-bound Elzevirs.</p>

  <p>I found Mr. Solomon alone at the back of the shop dusting a range of
  shelves with a feather brush, and at once noticed a departure from his usual
  sprightly, genial manner. The worthy bookseller looked in decidedly low
  spirits.</p>

  <p>"Good-morning, Mr. Solomon," I said cheerfully; "I hope I find you well
  this beautiful weather."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't," he replied sourly.</p>

  <p>"Indeed! I am sorry for that. What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>He laid down the feather brush and looked at me gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Balmy," said he.</p>

  <p>"Balmy?" I repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," he rejoined. "Balmy." And then, as I stared at him in
  astonishment, he added by way of elucidation: "on the crumpet."</p>

  <p>I was exceedingly surprised. Solomon was a cultivated man--I might say a
  learned man--and was not addicted to these coarse colloquialisms. But, of
  course, I did not take him seriously. The diagnosis of insanity is not
  usually made by the lunatic himself.</p>

  <p>"You're out of spirits this morning, Mr. Solomon," I said.</p>

  <p>"Spirits be blowed!" said he. "If I'm not going off my blooming onion
  I'll--but there! it's no concern of yours, Mr. Mitchell. You've come to see
  those books that I wrote to you about. I've made them up into a parcel, as I
  thought you would like to take them home to look at at your leisure. There
  are five of them--"</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly, and, to my amazement, began to retreat down the
  shop in a most singular, stealthy manner, flattening himself against the wall
  as if he were squeezing past some bulky obstacle, and watching suspiciously
  the opposite range of bookshelves. When he was half-way down the shop, he
  turned and almost ran out; and on following him into the street, I found him
  earnestly examining the stock-in-trade of another bookseller some three doors
  farther up.</p>

  <p>"You were saying, Mr. Solomon--" I began.</p>

  <p>"Yes, about that parcel of books. It is on the shelf over the fireplace.
  Your name is written on it. Perhaps you wouldn't mind going in and taking it.
  I find the shop rather stuffy just at present."</p>

  <p>This was certainly very queer behaviour and most unlike Solomon, who was
  in general the very pink of politeness. I was greatly puzzled; but, as I was
  somewhat pressed for time, I went into the shop, found my parcel and bustled
  off with it after a few hasty words to the bookseller.</p>

  <p>As I had to call at the chambers of another barrister, I took the
  opportunity to run up to my own and leave the parcel there; and, as the books
  were of some value and were not mine, at present, I bestowed them in the
  upper part of my bureau, and, according to my invariable habit, turned the
  key. Then I went about my business.</p>

  <p>From my friend's chambers I went across to the Appeal Court, in which I
  was that day engaged. I lunched with the Q.C. with whom I was associated, and
  when the court rose I went home with him to dine and talk over the case.</p>

  <p>I remained with him until past eleven o'clock. When I emerged from his
  chambers in Paper Buildings, I perceived three persons--two men and a
  woman--sauntering slowly up towards Crown Office Row and looking about them
  with the leisurely air of sightseers. One of the men, who carried a
  violin-case, was apparently acting as showman, and, as I overtook them, I
  recognised him as a crony of mine, a law student named Leyland. I would have
  passed with a flourish of the hat, but he hailed me to stop.</p>

  <p>"I say, Mitchell, can you tell us where it was that Lamb lived with his
  sister? Wasn't it Crown Office Row?"</p>

  <p>"No; he was born in Crown Office Row, but the chambers where he and Mary
  Lamb lived were in Mitre Court Buildings."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Leyland, addressing the lady, "you will have to come and see
  the place by daylight. The gate is shut now. We must get Mr. Mitchell to show
  us round the old place some day; he knows every stone of it and who lived in
  every house from the time of the Knights Templars downward. You wouldn't
  mind, Mitchell, would you? Miss Bonnington is rabid on historic
  associations."</p>

  <p>"I should be proud and delighted," said I.</p>

  <p>"It is a dear old place," said Miss Bonnington; "so peaceful and monastic.
  How I should love to live here! But I suppose there are no Eves in this
  Paradise."</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "It is given up to Adam and the serpent; especially the
  serpent."</p>

  <p>Miss Bonnington laughed: and a very pretty, musical laugh it was, and very
  pleasant to listen to. Indeed, she impressed me as a very charming young
  lady; sweet-faced and soft-spoken, though quite self possessed.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you played the fiddle, Leyland," said I, glancing at the
  case in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I don't," he replied. "This is Miss Bonnington's. I groan aloud on the
  'cello, and Mr. Bonnington hammers the 'well-tempered clavier.' We've been
  having a little revival meeting in my chambers."</p>

  <p>Thus we chatted as we strolled quietly up the untenanted walk. My
  appointment as future cicerone seemed to have served as an informal
  introduction, and when we came to the corner of Fig Tree Court, we halted to
  gossip awhile before saying good-night.</p>

  <p>"What a very extraordinary old gentleman that was!" Miss Bonnington said
  suddenly. "And how inquisitively he looked at us."</p>

  <p>We all turned to follow her gaze, but the old gentle man had already
  passed into the gloom of the narrow court and was little more than a bulky
  shadow.</p>

  <p>"He's a deuce of a size," said Leyland. "Looks like a turtle walking
  upright."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miss Bonnington, "but did you see how oddly he was dressed? He
  seemed to have a cocked hat and gaiters like a bishop's. Would he be a judge,
  do you think?"</p>

  <p>I laughed at the idea of one of Her Majesty's judges going abroad in a
  cocked hat and gaiters, and delicately suggested an optical illusion.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Leyland, "you'll be able to see for yourself, presently. He
  has turned into your entry. I expect he has come to offer you a brief."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "I mustn't keep him waiting. Remember, that whenever you
  are disposed for a historic prowl round the Temple, I am at your
  service."</p>

  <p>I shook hands with my newly-made friends and Leyland and betook myself to
  number 21, Fig Tree Court, on the second floor of which my chambers were
  situated. Slowly ascending the stone stairs, I speculated on the unknown
  visitor of quaint aspect, until I at length reached my own landing. But there
  was nobody waiting for me. Evidently Leyland had mistaken the entry, for mine
  were the only residential chambers in the building.</p>

  <p>I let myself in with my key, shut the heavy "oak," and was about to take
  off my overcoat when my attention was arrested by a very strange
  circumstance.</p>

  <p>There was a light in my sitting-room.</p>

  <p>It was very singular and rather disturbing. I stood in the tiny lobby
  gazing at the streak of light--the door stood slightly ajar--and wondering if
  it could possibly be a burglar, though burglary was practically unknown in
  the Temple, and listening intently. There were no sounds of movement or,
  indeed, of any kind except a faint, continuous creak, curiously like the
  squeak of a quill pen. I stepped forward on tiptoe, softly pushed open the
  door, and looked into the room.</p>

  <p>What I saw astonished me beyond words. Seated at my open bureau, writing
  rapidly with one of the quill pens which I, with an old-fashioned lawyer's
  conservatism, still use, was a man, apparently a stranger. As his back was
  turned to me I could not see what he was like, excepting that he was
  excessively bulky, and that he wore a grey wig. This latter fact puzzled me
  greatly. It is not customary for counsel to wear their wigs in chambers at
  midnight, and I could see, moreover, that he was not in his gown. It was very
  remarkable.</p>

  <p>I watched him for awhile in speechless astonishment, a huge, unreal
  silhouette against the light of the single wax candle that I always keep in
  the antique silver candlestick on my bureau. He wrote on steadily with a loud
  chirping of the quill, turned the paper over and continued on the other side,
  and finally signed his name with an elaborate flourish, as I gathered from a
  series of more vehement squeaks. Then he laid the pen in the rack and helped
  himself to a pinch of snuff.</p>

  <p>At this point I thought it expedient to attract his attention, and, to
  that end, coughed gently. But he took no notice. I coughed again a little
  louder, but still he appeared unaware of my presence. And then suddenly it
  flashed upon me that I must have got into the wrong chambers. I do not know
  why I thought this, for there was my own bureau with my own candlestick on
  it, there was the parcel of books at the stranger's elbow, and there was the
  high back of my Queen Anne chair cutting across the tail of his wig. But the
  misgiving was so strong that I must needs steal back into the lobby and
  softly open the outer door to satisfy myself.</p>

  <p>No; there was no mistake. There was my own name "Mr. James Mitchell"
  painted legibly above the lintel. Having ascertained this, I re-entered,
  closed the door rather noisily and strode across the lobby. But now another
  surprise awaited me.</p>

  <p>The room was in darkness.</p>

  <p>I stopped short expecting my visitor to come out. But he did not; nor was
  there any sound of movement from within. Rather nervously I struck a wax
  match and once more entered; and, as I looked round I uttered a gasp of
  amazement.</p>

  <p>The room was empty.</p>

  <p>I stood for some seconds staring with dropped jaw into the dim vacancy
  until the match burned my finger; when I dropped it and lit another in a
  mighty hurry. For the idea suddenly occurred to me that this unwieldy
  stranger must be a lunatic, and was perhaps at this moment lurking under the
  table. Very hastily I lit the gas and stepped back to the door. But a
  moment's investigation showed me that there was no one in hiding. The room
  was undeniably empty; and yet there was no exit save by the door at which I
  had entered. The affair was incomprehensible and beyond belief. Not only was
  the room empty; there was no sign of its having been entered. The bureau was
  shut, and when I stepped over to it and tried the flap, I found it locked as
  I had left it.</p>

  <p>Needless to say, I searched the entire "set." I lit the gas in the lobby,
  the bedroom, the office and the little kitchen. I looked under the bed, into
  the wardrobe, and opened cupboards that would hardly have hidden a baby, much
  less the leviathan who had so amazingly vanished. And when I had proved
  beyond all doubt that there was no one in the chambers but myself, I went
  back to the sitting-room and gazed uncomfortably at the bureau. Of course
  there could be only one explanation. The fat man was an illusion; a figment
  of my own brain. There had really never been anyone in the place at all.</p>

  <p>This was all very well as an explanation, but it was not particularly
  satisfactory. Hallucinations are awkward things. The brain that generates non
  existent fat men is not a sound brain. And the circumstantiality of the
  illusion only made it worse. For I could recall the fat man perfectly as he
  sat with the candlelight filtering through the edge of his wig; and now that
  I came to reflect on it, that wig was a very peculiar one. It was not a
  barrister's wig at all, nor a judge's, in fact it was not a horse-hair wig of
  any kind. It was softer and closer as if made of actual human hair.</p>

  <p>Reflection on the subject was so disquieting that I determined to dismiss
  it from my mind; and, to that end, set about composing a letter which I had
  to send off to a solicitor in the morning. Unlocking and opening the flap of
  the bureau, I lit the candle, and, seating myself, took a sheet of paper from
  the stationery drawer and picked up a pen from the rack. As I turned over the
  opening paragraph of my proposed letter, and before I had raised the lid of
  the ink-stand, I tried the point of the pen, as is my habit, on my
  thumb-nail. How can I express my astonishment when, on glancing at my nail
  after doing so, I perceived on it a little spot of wet ink!</p>

  <p>I was thunderstruck. Here, at any rate, was a tangible fact; and what made
  it more conclusive was the circumstance that I had, that very morning, placed
  a new pen in the rack and thrown the old one away. This pen, therefore, now
  charged with wet ink, had never been used by me. It was an amazing affair. I
  sat or a quite considerable time reflecting on it, and might have reflected
  much longer, but that, happening to glance at the pen in my hand, I perceived
  that it was perfectly clean and unused. There was not a sign of ink on it,
  either wet or dry. Instinctively I held up my thumb-nail and looked at it.
  But the spot of ink had vanished; or, at least, there was no spot there, and,
  of course, there had never been any spot. The wet ink, like the fat man, was
  an illusion; the product of some disordered state of my own brain.</p>

  <p>It was excessively disturbing, but it was useless to puzzle over it and
  fret about it. No doubt the condition would pass, and meanwhile it were wiser
  to ignore it, and quietly attend to my health. Thus reflecting, I addressed
  myself to my letter, dipped my pen, wrote "Dear Sir," and plunged forthwith
  into the matter. I wrote on with the easy fluency of a man who is committing
  to paper that which is already in his mind, reached the bottom of the page,
  turned over, finished the letter in a couple more lines, and signed my name.
  Then I rose and fetched the letter-book from my copying-press.</p>

  <p>I had opened the book, and was about to take the brush from the water pot
  when my eye chanced to fail on the letter that I had just written; whereupon
  I fairly cried out with astonishment. For the name that I had signed was not
  my own name, nor was it even in my own handwriting; and, if anything could
  make the affair more astonishing, it was that I had written down a name that
  was entirely strange to me--Phineas Desborough. Who on earth was Phineas
  Desborough? and what was his confounded name doing at the foot of my
  letter?</p>

  <p>I don't mind admitting that I was now considerably alarmed, and that the
  hand with which I picked up the precious document was far from a steady one.
  So completely was I overpowered that I was sensible of no further surprise on
  finding the matter of the epistle as strange as the signature, or on seeing
  the purple copying ink fade before my eyes into a spectral brown. My capacity
  for astonishment was exhausted. However, I reflected grimly, there could be
  no breach of confidence in reading my own letter, and accordingly I reseated
  myself and proceeded to run my eye, with far from pleasurable curiosity, over
  the faded writing to ascertain what I had been saying. I read the letter
  through with close attention and now quote its contents with a clear memory.
  They were as follows:</p>

  <p>"16, Field Court, Gray's Inn,</p>

  <p>"11th April, 1785.</p>

  <p>"Madam,--Your esteemed letter of the 20th ultimo was duly received by me
  with profound gratification. Pray permit me respectfully to acknowledge the
  gracious condescension of your language towards one who has wrought much
  mischief and who now makes restitution only on the verge of the grave. It
  were better, I conceive, since your guardian must on no account be privy to
  our meeting, that you should not be seen at my chambers. You say that you
  will arrive in London on the evening of the 22nd instant, and will be free
  from the observation of your guardian on the following afternoon. That being
  so, I venture to give you the following directions: Walk from your lodging at
  the Saracen up Fleet Street on the south side and so through that arch of
  Temple Bar that abuts on Mr. Child's Bank. In that arch I shall take my stand
  at three of the clock punctually, and since the arch encloses but a strait
  passage, and my person (by reason of my habit of body and the dropsy with
  which it hath pleased God most justly to afflict me) will occupy the greater
  part thereof, you must needs pass me so close that I may readily place the
  book in your hands without being observed.</p>

  <p>"Conceal the book most carefully ('tis but a small one), and when you are
  quite private and secure from observation, carry a sharp pen-knife round the
  line that I have marked within the cover so as to cut fairly through the
  lining.</p>

  <p>"I shall say no more, save that I have devised my entire property by will
  to your brother Jonathan, and that I entreat you to advise me when you have
  accomplished my directions and have the writing safely in your custody.</p>

  <p>"I am, Madam,</p>

  <p>"Your Most obedient humble Servant,</p>

  <p>"Phineas Desborough.</p>

  <p>"To Mrs. Susan Pierpoint."</p>

  <p>I laid the letter down and took a few turns up and down the room. Here, at
  least, was no illusion. The circumstantial detail and the names of the
  persons, entirely unknown to me, seemed to put that quite out of the
  question. The thing that troubled me most was the ink, the change in which
  admitted of no reasonable explanation. And, now that I came to think of it,
  the paper itself had seemed to undergo some kind of metamorphosis; a change
  that I had, as it were, noted subconsciously and passed over at the moment.
  To make sure that this was actually the case, I stepped over to the bureau
  and again took up the letter. And then I stood like a graven image with the
  sheet of paper in my hand and my eyes riveted on the opening words:</p>

  <p>"Dear Sir,</p>

  <p>"Bayste V. Jarvie,</p>

  <p>"19, Fig Tree Court, Inner Temple, 18th May, 1901.</p>

  <p>"Referring to our conversation of the 16th instant--"</p>

  <p>I turned the page and looked on my signature "James Mitchell," of which
  the ink was still fresh and purple. So Phineas Desborough's letter, like the
  ink spot and the fat man, was after all an illusion.</p>

  <p>But what an illusion! Even as I glanced over my own missive, couched in
  the characterless phraseology of to-day, the more rounded periods of the
  antique letter came fresh and word-perfect to my memory. There was something
  out of the common here. Either some outside agency had by some means gained
  access to my consciousness, or I was (to borrow Mr. Solomon's graceful
  euphemism) "going balmy on the crumpet." And neither alternative was an
  agreeable one to contemplate.</p>

  <p>I placed my letter in an envelope, which I addressed but left open that I
  might examine it in the morning and make sure that it had undergone no fresh
  metamorphoses. Then I went to bed, to lie awake a full hour meditating on
  Phineas Desborough and Mistress Susan Pierpoint and wondering if there had
  ever been such persons or if they were merely the products of a disordered
  brain.</p>

  <p>Among my acquaintances in the Temple at this period was, as I have already
  mentioned, a law student named Frank Leyland. I had a great regard for
  Leyland. In the first place, he was a fine handsome young fellow, and I have
  a partiality for good-looking people. Then he was fairly bursting with health
  and good spirits, qualities which, also, I appreciate highly. For your happy
  man is a benefactor to his species. Just as one may gather knowledge from the
  wise, so, by contact with the happy, may one improve one's spirits; a truth
  deserving of consideration by the middle-aged.</p>

  <p>It was on the following Sunday night that I encountered Leyland, emerging
  with the other worshippers from the Temple Church, and--I regret to
  say--yawning prodigiously.</p>

  <p>"Why do you go to church if it makes you yawn?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Free lesson in elocution," he replied. "There's no model like a
  good-class parson. Actor's no good; too florid. Lawyer's too prosy. But a
  parson's the happy mean; a good style not hampered by matter. Are you going
  home?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I was going home; to Fig Tree Court, that is to say."</p>

  <p>"Why not come and smoke a cigar with me?" Leyland suggested.</p>

  <p>Why not? I was not specially yearning for a solitude which was apt to be
  disturbed by reminiscences of the late (or never) Phineas Desborough and
  suspicions of crumpetic unsoundness.</p>

  <p>"I've just bought a Wheatley's Pepys," said Leyland; and that settled it.
  A minute later we were in his rather expensively appointed chambers in
  Tanfield Court with a pile of his newly-purchased books on the table.</p>

  <p>We overhauled the treasures one by one, dipping into them and sampling
  passages, criticising illustrations and appraising bindings, until, at the
  bottom of the pile, we came on Goodeve's "Real Property."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see you are not neglecting your studies," I said, nodding at
  the forbidding volume, but not essaying to sample its contents.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's not professional enthusiasm," said Leyland. "I have a personal
  interest in property law at the moment. That's why I bought Goodeve; but now
  that I've got you here, I don't see why I shouldn't take counsel's opinion
  instead of muddling it out myself."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I. It will probably save time. Pass the tobacco-jar and
  propound your riddle."</p>

  <p>He pushed over the jar and a box of cigars. "The question is," said he,
  "what is the position of a man who threatens to cut his only son off with a
  shilling?"</p>

  <p>"Well," I replied, "in my limited experience as a playgoer, his position
  is usually in the middle of the hearth-rug, with his legs a-straddle, and his
  hands under his coat-tails."</p>

  <p>Leyland grinned cheerfully. "I mean his legal position," said he. "Can he
  do it?</p>

  <p>"That is a very vague question to come from a half-fledged barrister. The
  question turns on the manner in which the property is held. If a man holds
  his property absolutely, he can dispose of it absolutely; if he holds it
  subject to conditions, he can only dispose of it in accordance with those
  conditions. But why do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"Because my respected governor has expressed his
  intention--contingently--of putting the process into operation on me."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Would it be indiscreet to ask why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the usual thing. My matrimonial projects are not acceptable."</p>

  <p>"Your father objects to the lady, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"No; he has never seen her. But he jibs at her father. You see, my
  governor is an old-fashioned country gentleman and he's nuts on his family.
  God knows why. There seem to have been untold generations of country bumpkins
  bearing our name, and, for some reason, he is proud of the fact, and
  considers us the salt of the earth. Now, the lady's father is a musician; he
  plays the organ and teaches music. Also he is not a millionaire. But the
  organ is the real trouble. My governor says he's not going to have his son
  marrying the daughter of a damned organ-grinder. So there you are."</p>

  <p>"It's not delicately put," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"No, the gov's a rude old man when he's put out. But it's such confounded
  nonsense. The musician's is a noble profession, and, as to the organ, why
  it's the Zeus of the instrumental Olympus. Think of all the great men who
  have played the organ. There's Mozart and Bach, and Handel himself--"</p>

  <p>"And Johnny Morgan," I interrupted; but by Leyland's feeble smile I saw
  that he had never heard the old song, and so missed the point of the
  joke.</p>

  <p>"Well, the upshot of it is," Leyland concluded, "that the governor refuses
  his consent. He says if I marry the daughter I can apprentice myself to her
  father, and he will furnish me with one shilling sterling, and the price of a
  monkey.</p>

  <p>"Why a monkey?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he seems to think that a monkey is an indispensable adjunct to organ
  playing. He's not musical, you know."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think he will give way if he is treated judiciously?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't. He's as obstinate as a mule. And what's worse, he has
  snookered me for the time being by explaining his intentions by letter to my
  proposed papa-in-law. The result being that I am at present a rejected
  suitor."</p>

  <p>"But, if you are rejected, your legal position is pointless."</p>

  <p>"Oh, is it, by Jove!" said Leyland. "You don't think I agree to the
  rejection, do you? Because I don't. I tell you, Mitchell, I'm going to marry
  Kate Bonnington," and Leyland stuck out his chin with a distinct reminiscence
  of the parental mulishness.</p>

  <p>"So I gathered from your manner the other evening; and I can't pretend to
  disapprove after seeing Miss Bonnington. But you say that relations between
  you are broken off for the present."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, they're not," said Leyland. "We are perfectly good friends still.
  You see, I am taking lessons on the organ from Papa Bonnington."</p>

  <p>"That savours of mere low cunning on your part. But go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, Bonnington is quite willing, in the abstract, for me to marry his
  daughter, and Miss Kate is also agreeable--in the abstract--but they both
  refuse to be the cause of my being disinherited."</p>

  <p>"And, of course," I added, "you couldn't cut much of a figure as a married
  man on one shilling sterling and the price of a monkey."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. But if the old man can't disinherit me, I think matters could be
  arranged. I might, for instance, borrow enough on my expectations to start
  myself in some sort of business. Hence my inquiry as to the governor's
  powers."</p>

  <p>"Which brings us back to the original question; does your father hold the
  property absolutely or conditionally?"</p>

  <p>"I'm hanged if I know," said Leyland. "I suppose I must try to find out.
  What I do know is that there seems to be a strong suspicion of some sort of
  flaw in the title."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! That sounds unpleasant; but it is also rather vague."</p>

  <p>"It's quite vague," said Leyland. "But I'd better tell you what I know
  about it, which is uncommonly little. The story is connected with an ancestor
  of ours named Anthony Leyland, who lived in the time of George the second.
  Anthony seems to have been mixed up in some Jacobite foolery, and, when that
  game fizzled out after the '45, he retired to the continent. The man who then
  held the Leyland property was a Whig and a loyalist, so, I suppose Anthony
  reckoned that if he kept out of sight, his peccadilloes would be forgotten by
  the time he was due to succeed to the estate. But, as a matter of fact, he
  never did succeed to it. He lived at Louvain, and died there before his
  innings was due. It seems that at Louvain he carried on some sort of business
  in partnership with a man named Bonnington."</p>

  <p>"Bonnington!" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," laughed Leyland; "Bonnington. That is the cream of the joke, and
  that is what, I suspect, makes the old man so bitter. You'll hear why,
  presently.</p>

  <p>"Well, at the time of his death, Anthony was a widower with two children,
  a daughter named Susan, ten years old, who lived in England with an aunt, and
  a son, Jonathan, who had been born in Louvain, and who was only two years
  old. Of this son and also of the daughter he made Bonnington the guardian;
  but it seems he also made some arrangements with the family lawyer, for this
  gentleman--whose name I forget--passed through Louvain a few days before
  Anthony's death, and had an interview with him. Also it is known that this
  lawyer subsequently acted for Anthony's son.</p>

  <p>"Six months after Anthony's death the property fell in, and Bonnington,
  with the aid of the lawyer, managed to put Jonathan Leyland in possession,
  the management of affairs devolving on him (Bonnington) during Jonathan's
  minority. Well, it was all plain sailing so far. Jonathan was duly placed in
  possession, and in the course of time grew up to manhood or, at least, to the
  adult state, for he was never more than about half a man."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, in the first place, he was a dwarf, and in the second, his left arm
  and leg were withered apparently from his infancy. There is a portrait of him
  at home that shows a hideous little goblin with a lop-sided face and a big
  crutch. He seems to have been a rare old cough-drop--a regular terror to the
  neighbourhood, with a pleasant habit of rousing up the servants with the end
  of his crutch. He was a malignant, ill-conditioned little devil. He used to
  beat his wife and harry his sister, and generally raise Cain in the house.
  The only person he could get on with was Bonnington; but Bonnington's son,
  Walter, who was about his own age, seems to have been a special mark for his
  malice; and when he reached his majority, he hoofed out the unlucky Walter to
  fend for himself."</p>

  <p>"How do you know all this?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"His sister, Susan, kept a sort of diary and family chronicle which we
  have at home with a number of old letters. She married quite young, but
  became a widow a couple of years later, and came back to live under the
  fraternal roof. And a gay old time she seems to have had."</p>

  <p>"But what about the flaw in the title?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm just coming to that. It seems that one fine day, Mistress Susan
  received a very queer letter from the lawyer--I can't remember the fellow's
  name, but it doesn't matter--hinting to her that there had been some
  hocus-pocus about the property, and that both Bonnington and he were
  concerned in the fraud, what ever it was. I've seen the letter, and deuced
  vague it is; but he goes on to say that he has committed the facts for safe
  keeping to a volume of Horace or Virgil or some other Latin writer--I forget
  which--in his possession, and that he wants to hand the volume to her to be
  used in evidence after his death. The letter is endorsed on the back by
  Mistress Susan to this effect; that she did write to Mr.--whatever his name
  was--proposing to come to London and call on him, but he has never replied,
  or, which I rather suspect, he has answered, and his letter has been
  intercepted by my guardian (as I still call him) Mr. Bonnington. And there
  the matter ends. There's something queer, but we don't know what it is. We
  only know that Bonnington was in it; and that's what makes my governor so
  mad. He's frightfully sick to think that his title is shaky, and he loathes
  the name Bonnington."</p>

  <p>"But," I said, "it is only a chance similarity of name, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Is it, by Jove?" said Leyland. "Not a bit. Kate's father is the direct
  descendant of the much-abused Walter. We know that, because the families have
  always kept more or less in touch. The enmity is my governor's personal
  hobby."</p>

  <p>"Well, Leyland," I said, after a reflective pause, "it seems to me that
  your cue is to imitate the wisdom of the late Susan. Lie low and don't stir
  up mud. You don't want to upset the title to your own property."</p>

  <p>A distinct recrudescence of the ancestral mulishness appeared in Leyland's
  face "I daresay you're right," he said, "but, all the same, I'd like to know
  what that old lawyer had to tell. By the way, what do you suppose he meant by
  'committing the facts' to what seems to have been a printed book?"</p>

  <p>"Who can say? He may have written a statement on the fly-leaf, or, more
  probably, have attached a cipher connected with the text. However, as I have
  said, you had better leave the title alone and try more persuasive methods
  with your father. Introduce him to Miss Bonnington, for instance. That would
  probably settle the matter."</p>

  <p>Leyland's face brightened at my appreciation of the maiden of his choice,
  and, dismissing the legal question, he said: "Speaking of Kate, you promised
  to take her and her father on a personally-conducted tour round the Temple.
  When can I ask them to come? Sunday's no good, you know, to an organist."</p>

  <p>I considered my engagements for the week, and then replied: "Wednesday
  would do for me. Let them come early, and, when we have seen everything and
  traced the historical connections from Adam downwards, we will all repair to
  my chambers and drink tea. How will that do?"</p>

  <p>Leyland thought it would do excellently, and, subject to his friends'
  agreement, the arrangement was made.</p>

  <p>Need I hesitate to confess that my chambers in Fig Tree Court broke out,
  about this time, into unwonted sprightliness? Or to tell how the brief bag
  that I brought home on Wednesday received its lading at the pastrycook's? Or
  how an iced cake was smuggled into the Temple in a wig-box? Or how the
  ancient silver teapot was secretly polished with a silk handkerchief and
  sundry "collector's pieces" came forth of a cabinet to grace the tea-table?
  Why not? I am but a musty bachelor to whose lair the visitations of fair
  maids are in good truth as angel's visits. And angels must be suitably
  entertained. To pretty Kate Bonnington I had taken an instant liking, and my
  friend Leyland's little romance engaged my warmest sympathy. Such a romance
  might have been my own but for--however, that is another story.</p>

  <p>We met the tourists in state at the main entrance and carried them in
  procession through the ancient precincts. We talked of the Wars of the Roses,
  of the Knights Templars and of Twelfth Night. We raised the shades of Johnson
  and Goldsmith, of Burke and Sheridan. In Mitre Court Buildings we saw poor
  Charles and Mary Lamb go forth weeping, hand in hand, to the dreaded
  madhouse, and waited for them to "come again with rejoicing." We threw crumbs
  for the sparrows by the fountain and talked of Martin Chuzzlewit and Ruth
  Pinch (and here methought the fair Kate looked a shade conscious), and we
  looked into the church and to Mr. Bonnington's joy heard Father Smith's organ
  play. It was all very pleasant. The sky was sunny, the plane trees were
  golden, and when we turned into Fig Tree Court the shade and coolness were
  very grateful.</p>

  <p>Under the influence of tea the historic and literary reminiscences
  revived. Then Leyland, who was something of a bibliophile, strolled over to
  my shelves, tea cup in hand, to browse among my books and terrify me for the
  safety of my precious wedgwood. Suddenly he turned--and nearly upset the
  cup.</p>

  <p>"I saw Solomon this morning--the bookseller, I mean, not the other chap.
  He was asking after you. Said he'd sent you some books to look over."</p>

  <p>"God bless me!" I exclaimed, "so he did, and I have never opened the
  parcel."</p>

  <p>"Let's open it now and see what they are," said Leyland.</p>

  <p>I produced the parcel, and, cutting the string, displayed the treasures: a
  "Treacle Bible," an ancient treatise on alchemy and magic, a couple of recent
  historical works and a chubby, vellum-bound duodecimo.</p>

  <p>"What a dear little book!" Miss Bonnington ex claimed, pouncing on the
  latter, to our undissembled amusement. "So dainty and small and genteel. Oh,
  why can't people print and bind books like this now?"</p>

  <p>Her question passed unanswered, for Leyland was already deep in the
  "Treacle Bible"--a mere curiosity which I, certainly, had no intention of
  keeping--and expounding its peculiarities to Mr. Bonnington. From the bible
  we passed on to the book of magic, over which we discussed the quaint beliefs
  of our ancestors. Suddenly Mr. Bonnington looked at his daughter and asked:
  "What is the matter, Kate?"</p>

  <p>At the question, I looked up from the book. Miss Bonnington was sitting
  rigidly still with the little volume, clasped in both hands, resting in her
  lap. Her eyes were wide open and fixed, apparently, on the opposite wall.</p>

  <p>"What is it Kate?" her father repeated; and, as she still appeared
  unconscious of the question, he leaned forward and lightly touched her hand;
  where upon she started violently and gazed around her like a
  suddenly-awakened sleeper.</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary thing!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What is an extraordinary thing, my dear?" demanded Mr. Bonnington.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible to dream without going to sleep?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"If you have been dreaming and you haven't been to sleep, it must be," her
  father answered, "Have you?"</p>

  <p>"It is astonishing," she said. "It must have been a dream, and yet it was
  so real, so vivid."</p>

  <p>"What was, my dear? What was? Hey? Hm?" and in his impatience Mr.
  Bonnington leaned forward and tapped her knuckles.</p>

  <p>"Be patient and I'll tell you. The dream began quite suddenly. This place
  vanished, and I was in a street, a crowded street filled with people in
  curious dresses such as one sees in old engravings. There was no pavement;
  only a row of posts between the road and the footway on which I was walking.
  The shops had funny little small-paned windows, like the shops in a country
  village, and each one had a sign hanging above the window or door. I walked
  quickly, and had the feeling of going somewhere for a definite purpose, and
  presently, when a kind of arched gate way came in sight, I seemed to have
  expected it. This gateway--I seem, even now, to recognise it; perhaps from
  having seen it in some picture--had three arches, a large one over the road,
  and two small ones for foot-passengers, and a large window over the middle
  arch. As I approached the gate to pass through I saw a man standing under the
  left-hand arch as if waiting for some one. He was an elderly man, very fat
  and very pale; and now that I come to think of him, he reminds me of that old
  gentleman who passed us that night in Fig Tree Court. I walked towards him
  with a very curious feeling of having expected to find him there, and, as I
  passed through the arch, brushing closely against him because he took up so
  much of the space, he put something into my hand. I remember taking what he
  gave me as if I had expected it; and then you woke me up."</p>

  <p>"Can't you recall what it was that he gave you?" Mr Bonnington asked.</p>

  <p>"I have a sort of feeling that it was a book; but I expect that it is only
  because I was holding this book when I woke," and she held up the little
  duodecimo and laid it on the table.</p>

  <p>As Kate Bonnington told her story, I listened with growing wonder, and,
  when she had finished, I fell into a reverie in which the eager questionings
  of her father and Frank Leyland came to me as sounds from an infinite
  distance. I roused only when Leyland, taking the little book carelessly from
  the table, glanced at it and addressed me.</p>

  <p>"You remember, Mitchell, I was telling you about a book to which that old
  lawyer had committed certain facts. I thought it was Horace or Virgil. It
  wasn't, it was Sallust. This reminded me."</p>

  <p>He held the little book towards me, and I read on the label "Sallustii
  Opera."</p>

  <p>For a few moments I looked vacantly at the book; then, with eager
  expectation I took it from his hand and opened it; and somehow, it seemed in
  no wise strange, but perfectly natural and in order, that I should find on
  the fly-leaf, traced in faded, brown ink in a hand which I recognised,
  "Phineas Desborough, 1756."</p>

  <p>I say that it seemed quite natural, but I must, nevertheless, have been
  really astounded for I presently became aware that my three friends were
  regarding me with uncommon curiosity.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Mitchell?" asked Leyland. "You look as if you had
  seen a ghost too."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have," was my reply; and I returned to the examination of the
  mysterious little volume. The fly-leaf bore no mark other than the name and
  date, but when I turned to the back cover I at once perceived--and again it
  seemed quite natural and reasonable--a thin, pale line of brown ruled round
  the margin of what my bookish eye instantly detected as a false end-paper.
  Without a word, I produced my penknife, and, opening it, laid the little book
  on the table. As I brought the point of the keen blade on to the faded line,
  Leyland sprang up and exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! What is the man going to do now?" I made no reply, but carried
  the blade steadily along the line until it had traversed the four sides,
  separating a little panel of the end-paper. I lifted this off, and then,
  turning the book over, shook out two little sheets of very thin yellowish
  paper, each covered with pale brown, very minute writing.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Leyland. "Hidden bank notes, hey!" He picked up one
  of the little leaves, glanced at it, and then stood staring at me, as if
  thunderstruck.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Mitchell," he said in a low voice. "Do you see what this
  is?"</p>

  <p>He handed the little leaf to me, and I then saw that he had been looking
  at the back of the document, on which was written in ordinary-sized
  handwriting:</p>

  <p>"The statement of Anthony Leyland, Gent, received by me from his hand on
  the 16th day of August, 1753, in a sealed packet which I afterwards
  opened.</p>

  <p>"Phineas Desborough."</p>

  <p>"This is a confidential document, Leyland," I said. "It concerns you, and
  may contain important family secrets."</p>

  <p>"Secrets be hanged!" he replied. "There are no secrets between us. Read it
  out. Let us hear what Anthony Leyland had to say in 1753."</p>

  <p>My legal instincts rose in revolt at the proposal, though I was devoured
  by curiosity. But Leyland was immovable, and, after a few ineffectual
  protests, I put on my spectacles and addressed myself to the decipherment of
  the microscopic script.</p>

  <p>"Louvain,</p>

  <p>"August the 3rd, 1753.</p>

  <p>"My dearest Child,--I am writing these words (with a crow's-quill-pen),
  lying on the bed whence I shall presently be borne to an alien grave,
  trusting that, by the Christian charity of some stranger, they shall come
  safely to your hand. I am dying in a strange land, with no friend near me,
  and no fellow-countryman save my partner, James Bonnington; to whose care,
  therefore, I must needs commit my little son, your brother Jonathan. But this
  I do with much misgiving, for I trust not Mr. Bonnington, who is a shrewd and
  worldly man; and who hath been most willing and even eager to undertake the
  duty, which makes me mistrust him the more. To be plain, I fear he may
  practise some fraud. For you are to know that this Bonnington is a widower
  (his wife died in the late sickness which carried off your dear mother), and
  hath one little son but a month or two older than your brother; a poor,
  mis-shapen wretch, having one arm and leg withered from his birth, on whom
  his father doteth--though I blame him not for that. But my fear is that he
  shall set this poor bantling in your brother's place; which he may readily do
  since he is your brother's guardian, and no one knoweth the children.
  Perchance I misjudge him; and God grant that it be so. Yet, for safety, I
  tell you this. That your brother is a lusty child, well-shapen and fair like
  his mother. That he hath a mole on his left cheek, and on his right breast a
  mother-mark of a red colour, about the bigness of a groat. By these you shall
  know the child; for Bonnington's son is sallow and black, and, as I have
  said, maimed from birth.</p>

  <p>"Should that happen which I fear, and this letter reach you safely, keep
  it till you are of age, and then seek counsel of some wise and honest
  man.</p>

  <p>"I commend you, dear child, to the good God, and so farewell.</p>

  <p>"From your loving Father,</p>

  <p>"Anthony Leyland."</p>

  <p>"To Mistress Susan Leyland."</p>

  <p>"August the 11th. Mr. Desborough, the attorney, is now in Louvain, and
  comes to me to-morrow, when I shall deliver this to his keeping to convey to
  you."</p>

  <p>There was profound silence for a while after I had finished reading. Then
  Leyland asked:</p>

  <p>"'What is the other paper, Mitchell?"</p>

  <p>I picked up the paper, and, glancing at it, replied: "It is Desborough's
  statement. Shall I read it?</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Leyland, and accordingly I read aloud:</p>

  <p>"I, Phineas Desborough, of 16, Field Court, Gray's Inn, Attorney at Law,
  do affirm and declare as follows:</p>

  <p>"That I received the attached statement from Anthony Leyland, Gent, in a
  sealed packet: that I opened the packet and withheld the letter from Susan
  Leyland to whom I had promised to deliver it: that I did afterwards conspire
  with James Bonnington to substitute his son Walter for Jonathan the son of
  the said Anthony. That with my connivance and assistance the said Walter did
  enter into possession of the estate real and personal to which the said
  Jonathan was entitled which estate he doth continue to hold; that the said
  Walter did and still doth pass under the name and style of Jonathan Leyland
  and that the said Jonathan was and still is unlawfully and fraudulently
  caused to believe that his name is Walter Bonnington and that he is the son
  of the said James Bonnington.</p>

  <p>"Given under my hand this 29th day of March, 1785.</p>

  <p>"Phineas Desborough."</p>

  <p>"Signed in my presence,</p>

  <p>"William Horrell, of 6 Hand Court, Holborn, Clerk."</p>

  <p>I laid down the paper, and looked at my three friends, but for some time
  none of us spoke. Leyland was the first to break the silence; and his first
  words framed the inevitable question.</p>

  <p>"How did you know those papers were in that book, Mitchell?"</p>

  <p>There was no occasion for secrecy or reticence. My audience was not likely
  to be sceptical. In a few words, I told the story of my midnight visitor and
  the mysterious letter. And when the wonder of this had a little subsided,
  there came the further and equally inevitable question.</p>

  <p>"By the light of those two statements, Mitchell, what do you say is the
  present position? It seems that my governor is playing cuckoo."</p>

  <p>"The position is," said I, "that you are Frank Bonnington, and that Miss
  Kate here is Kate Leyland."</p>

  <p>"And would those papers be good evidence in a court of law?"</p>

  <p>"Probably. But I must point out that after the lapse of a hundred and
  fifty years, it might prove very difficult to oust a tenant from possession.
  And your father has the sinews of war, and would probably fight to the last
  ditch."</p>

  <p>"Now there you are quite wrong," said Leyland. "The governor is as
  obstinate as the devil, but he's an honest man, and generous, too. If you
  show him those papers and give him all the facts, I'll undertake that he'll
  march out, bag and baggage, without any action at law at all."</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Bonnington rose and reached out for the papers. "If that is the
  case," said he, "I think we had better pop those two statements in the grate,
  and put a match to them." And he would have done it, but that I, with a
  lawyer's solicitude for documents, whisked them out of his reach and,
  clapping them in my pocket-book, buttoned my coat.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Mitchell," said Leyland. "I am sure you agree with me that
  justice must be done."</p>

  <p>"I do. I agree most emphatically. But I must insist on its being done in a
  reasonable manner."</p>

  <p>"As for instance--"</p>

  <p>"Well, I understand that Mr. Bonnington, as I will still call him, has no
  son and only one daughter. Now supposing he enters an action against your
  father, and succeeds in ousting him; what is the result? The result is that
  Miss Kate Bonnington becomes transformed into Kate Leyland. But surely, my
  dear boy, the same result could be reached by a much shorter and less costly
  process."</p>

  <p>Leyland stared at me for a few moments and then his face broke out into an
  appreciative grin. "By Jove, Mitchell," said he, "you ought to be Lord Chief
  Justice. Of course, that's the plan." He turned his gaze on Miss Kate (whose
  complexion had suddenly assimilated itself to that of the peony), and
  added:</p>

  <p>"That is to say, if Miss Leyland would condescend to marry a poor,
  penniless devil like Frank Bonnington."</p>

  <p>That weighty question they subsequently settled to their mutual
  satisfaction and everyone else's. For the "governor" justified his son's
  estimate of his character by "climbing down" with the agility of an opossum.
  Thus, by a short and inexpensive procedure, Kate Bonnington became Kate
  Leyland--it happened the very day after I took silk--and thus, after a
  century and a half, did Phineas Desborough make restitution.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-07"
     id="ch-07"></a>VII. &mdash; THE LUCK OF BARNABAS MUDGE</h2>

  <p class="first">BARNABAS MUDGE was a man whose intellect was above his
  station in life; which is not necessarily to rate him with Aristotle or
  Herbert Spencer. For his station was only that of a jobbing bricklayer.
  Still, there are bricklayers and bricklayers; and Barnabas was of the brainy
  variety, which is by no means the most common.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, however, his mental gifts had not materially advanced him along
  the road to prosperity. Possibly luck had been against him, or it may have
  been that the village of Baconsfield offered but a limited scope for the
  working of his philosophic mind. At any rate, when we make his acquaintance
  on a sweltering day in June, we find him occupied in the unworthy task of
  demolishing a ruinous, isolated cottage on the extreme outskirts of the
  village.</p>

  <p>It was a roasting day. As Barnabas stood on the summit of the wall,
  sulkily pecking at the solid old brickwork, the sweat ran down his face and
  arms and even wetted the haft of his pick. To make matters worse, old Joe
  Gammet was depositing a liberal dressing of fish manure on the adjacent
  field. The deceased fish were presently to be sown evenly over the ground,
  not with the design--as the unagricultural reader might suppose--of producing
  a crop of mackerel, but for the purpose of enriching the soil; but at present
  the enrichment was more diffused, for the fish, set out in symmetrical heaps,
  lay under the broiling sun, "wasting their sweetness on the desert air."</p>

  <p>"Paw!" exclaimed Barnabas, driving his pick viciously into a joint of the
  hard old brickwork, "them fish do stink. Talk about the plagues of Egypt!
  Frogs is nothin' to it. And here comes that old swine with another load."</p>

  <p>He glanced sourly at the approaching cart and, taking aim at a spot lower
  down the wall, struck with the energy of exasperation. But here he
  encountered mortar of a somewhat different quality. The pick buried itself in
  a crumbling joint, and, as he wrenched at the haft, a considerable mass of
  brickwork detached itself and fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Hallo!" said Barnabas. And well he might. For the falling bricks had
  disclosed a small, cubical chamber in the wall; which chamber, as he could
  see by craning forward, was occupied by a covered, earthenware jar. This was
  highly interesting. It was also just a trifle inopportune; for old Gammet had
  now approached to within a hundred yards and was smiling with ominous
  geniality.</p>

  <p>Barnabas clambered down and began hastily to repair the effects of his
  last vigorous stroke, fitting the dislodged bricks back in their places as
  well as he could in the short time at his disposal. Then he climbed up to his
  former perch and began to work furiously on another part of the wall with his
  back to the approaching cart. But this aloofness of manner availed him
  nothing; for Joe Gammet, having arrived opposite the cottage, halted his
  cart, and, displaying a miscellaneous assortment of variegated teeth, hailed
  his acquaintance in a fine, resonant agricultural voice.</p>

  <p>"Wot O! Barney!"</p>

  <p>Barnabas looked round, with a red handkerchief applied to his nose.</p>

  <p>"Here, I say, Joe!" he gasped. "Just you move on with that there perfumery
  of your'n. It's a-makin' me giddy."</p>

  <p>Old Gammet chuckled and expectorated skilfully through a convenient
  aperture in the teeth. "You needn't be so delicut," said he. "Nice, 'ealthy
  country smell, I calls it. Nourishin' too. Wot's good for the land is good
  for them wot lives on the land." He took up a reposeful posture in the
  dismantled doorway and continued reflectively: "Rare tough job you've got
  there, Barney. Them old coves could build, they could. Used the right sort of
  stuff, they did. But there's a patch there that don't look much class of
  work. Why, I could pull it down with my 'ands!"</p>

  <p>He fixed a filmy eye on the piece of wall that Barnabas had just
  reconstituted and made as if to enter the cottage.</p>

  <p>"'Ere, don't you come inside," roared Barnabas. "It ain't safe." In
  illustration of this, he adroitly dislodged a few bricks just over the
  threshold, causing the aged Gammet to hop out through the doorway with quite
  surprising agility.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't yer see me a-standin' underneath?' the old labourer demanded
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>"I can't see nothin'," said Barnabas. "I can only smell. Would you mind
  movin' them wallflowers o' yourn a bit further off?"</p>

  <p>Old Gammet growled an unintelligible reply, and, sulkily grabbing his
  horse's bridle, moved away in the direction of the cart track that led into
  the field. Barnabas watched him impatiently, and, when the cart had fairly
  entered the field, he looked up and down the lane to satisfy himself that no
  further interruption threatened, and, once more, scrambled down.</p>

  <p>He removed the bricks more carefully this time, with a view to subsequent
  rebuilding, if necessary, and, thrusting his head into the mysterious cavity
  in the wall, took off the cover of the jar.</p>

  <p>"My eye!" he exclaimed as he applied the organ, thus apostrophised to the
  mouth of the jar. And perfectly natural the exclamation was; for the jar was
  full to the brim of glistening golden coins.</p>

  <p>For a few seconds he stood petrified with incredulous joy. Then he put
  forth a tremulous hand and picked out half a dozen or so; and his joy was yet
  further intensified. He had expected to find some ancient unmarketable
  coinage that shouted "Treasure Trove" from every worn line of its obsolete
  device. But nothing of the kind. The quantity of gold that passed through his
  hands was as a rule; inconsiderable. But he knew a sovereign when he saw it.
  And he saw it now. Yea, not one, but several hundreds.</p>

  <p>"Immortal scissors!" ejaculated Barnabas; and once more I repeat that the
  exclamation was justified by the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Now, to the pellucid intellect of Barnabas Mudge certain facts were at
  once obvious. Here, for instance, was a negotiable property of some hundreds
  of pounds--wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. That property, it is true,
  was not strictly speaking his; but Barnabas was a practical man to whom the
  pedantic subtleties of the law made no appeal. A more immediate problem was
  how to secure this heaven-sent windfall; and to this he gave his earnest
  attention as, having replaced the coins and the jar cover, he once more
  carefully built up the opening of the hiding-place.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, luck had persistently been against him. All the village knew him
  to be a poor man; and if now he should suddenly blossom out into unexplained
  wealth, curiosity would be aroused and probably suspicion too. Yet it was
  useless to be rich if one had to live in the appearance of poverty; and
  hoarding money was folly as this forgotten treasure plainly demonstrated.
  However, the final management of this undreamed of wealth could be considered
  later. The immediate problem was how to get it safely conveyed to his own
  house unobserved by prying eyes. As his truck, small as it was, could not be
  pulled in through the doorway, the precious jar would have to be carried out
  to the road, which might be safe enough if it were previously wrapped in a
  sack. But the magnitude of the stake was affecting his nerves to the extent
  of developing a perfectly unreasonable degree of caution and
  secretiveness.</p>

  <p>At present old Gammet was the insuperable obstacle. It was impossible to
  reopen the hiding-place and bring out the jar until he was gone; for he had
  seen the loose brickwork, and, being a crafty old rascal, might smell a rat.
  Thus reasoned Barnabas with absurdly exaggerated wariness--for conscience
  doth make cowards of us all--and as he pecked listlessly at the wall he kept
  an anxious eye on the old labourer, cursing his dilatory movements and his
  ridiculous care for appearances. For Joe Gammet, if his olfactory sense was
  not very discriminating, had a fastidious eye, and was evidently bent on
  disposing his unsavoury commodity in something like a symmetrical pattern; in
  fact, Barnabas could actually see him carefully counting the already
  deposited heaps and pacing out the distance to the site for the next one.</p>

  <p>"Now, there's a fat-headed old blighter for you!" Barnabas growled angrily
  as he watched. "Why can't he dump the stuff down and hook it?" In his
  exasperation he found himself counting the heaps, too, and calculating how
  many more the cart-load would produce. There were at present two complete
  rows, each of thirty-one heaps, and old Gammet was now engaged in depositing
  the twenty-sixth heap in the third row; and such is the power of suggestion
  that Barnabas paused in his labours to see if the dwindling contents of the
  cart would furnish out the five more heaps that were needed to complete the
  third row.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact the "perfumery" petered out at the twenty-ninth heap,
  to Gammet's evident regret, for, having deposited it, he solemnly and with
  extended arm, counted the whole collection over again. And then, at last, he
  climbed into the empty cart and disconsolately drove away.</p>

  <p>"Now for the oof," said Barnabas as the cart disappeared up the lane. He
  climbed down from his perch, and, placing in readiness a sack that he had
  brought with him, began to remove the loose bricks.</p>

  <p>But at this moment there smote on his ears the sound of wheels approaching
  from the opposite direction to that which Gammet had taken.</p>

  <p>"Drat it!" he exclaimed, hastily replacing the bricks and creeping to a
  small side window that commanded a view down the lane. "Who is it now? Why
  it's Mother Mooney and that slut of a gel of hers. Now what might they be up
  to?"</p>

  <p>At present they were up to speering about in an inquisitive and highly
  suspicious manner, and meanwhile, Mrs. Mooney was mooring to a fence rail a
  donkey which was harnessed to a primitive cart. Then, from the latter, the
  two women extracted each a sack and bustled into the field lately occupied by
  Mr. Gammet. Barnabas watched them with absolute stupefaction as they bore
  down on the heaps of fish with unmistakable intentions.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm blowed!" exclaimed Barnabas. "If they ain't come to pinch the
  myrrh and frankincense! So that's the way you runs a market garden. But I
  don't see what they wants a-countin' of 'em for; that there donkey cart won't
  hold the whole bilin'."</p>

  <p>The object of this mysterious proceeding, however, became evident
  presently, for it appeared that the two marauders, having noted Mr. Gammet's
  symmetrical arrangement, had decided not to disturb it and thereby draw
  attention to their unlawful proceedings. They accordingly began operations on
  number twenty-nine, and, having stowed it in their sacks, carried these to
  the donkey cart, and returning with two empty ones, renewed the assault on
  Gammet's property at the last heap on the next row.</p>

  <p>"There now!" exclaimed Barnabas admiringly, "there's a artful old baggage
  for yer! Thinks old Gammet won't miss 'em; and more he won't neither, if she
  don't take too many."</p>

  <p>His good opinion of her was justified in this also, for the discreet Mrs.
  Mooney contented herself with the removal of the three terminal heaps,
  leaving Mr. Gammet's symmetrical pattern apparently unchanged, and cleanly
  picking up even the minutest incriminating fragments.</p>

  <p>Barnabas patiently awaited the retreat of the two raiders, and as the
  donkey cart at length disappeared down the lane, he took another last look
  round and then once more uncovered the treasure chamber. The jar, though of
  no great size, was uncommonly heavy, and its introduction to the sack under
  the agitating circumstances was a matter of some difficulty. When it was
  safely accomplished and he had staggered out with his prize to the truck and
  there buried it under a heap of tools, sash-frames, rafters and other debris
  from the cottage, there followed several agonised minutes, during which he
  feverishly built up the opening of the chamber--for it would obviously have
  been madness to leave that cavity exposed to the inquisitive eyes of the
  villagers. But fortunately no one passed down the lane while he was thus
  occupied, nor was there anyone in sight when at length he stole forth
  guiltily and, taking up the pole of the truck, set out homewards at a pace,
  and with a degree of anxious care, suggestive of a rural funeral. We need not
  describe that journey in detail; let it suffice to say that at the end of it,
  Barnabas felt several years older and found himself deeply impressed alike
  with the surprising populousness of Baconsfield and his own hitherto
  unsuspected popularity. At length, with a sigh of relief, he trundled his
  cart into the tiny backyard of the cottage in which he lived all alone; a few
  moments more and he had borne his treasure in through the back door and shot
  the bolt; and thus was the first, and most essential, step taken on the road
  to fortune.</p>

  <p>It is needless to say that Mr. Mudge's first proceeding was to ascertain
  the extent of his wealth; to which end he tenderly bore the jar up the tiny
  staircase to the room above, where he tipped out its contents, in a glorious
  shining heap, on the bed, and began, with trembling fingers, to count the
  coins into smaller heaps in the manner of a glorified Gammet.</p>

  <p>The total was no less than six hundred and thirteen golden sovereigns, a
  sum, the bare contemplation of which produced symptoms of vertigo, and as he
  knelt by the narrow pallet, running an ecstatic eye over the unbelievable
  collection, his intellect began once more to occupy itself with the problem
  of an unsuspicious transition from poverty to affluence. No miser was
  Barnabas, who might find pleasure in mere gloating over a hoard of
  unnegotiable riches; but he was too wary to plunge into such sudden
  self-indulgence as might set the villagers whispering into the ear of the
  rural constable. What was necessary was some plausible explanation of the
  change in his financial condition; an explanation that was rendered
  necessary, not only by the amount of the windfall, but by a very curious
  circumstance which he had noticed while counting the coins; namely, that the
  sovereigns all bore the same date. That was, in fact, very odd indeed, and
  caused Barnabas to speculate in some surprise whether the identity of date
  was due to a miser's freak, or whether perchance, the hoard was the product
  of some forgotten bank robbery. Of course, that was no business of his
  excepting as to its result; which was that he would need to use some extra
  caution in introducing that large family of twins to a censorious world.</p>

  <p>He turned the problem over again and again as he replaced the coins in the
  jar and deposited the latter in a recess up the bedroom chimney; but he
  reached no conclusion. He cogitated on it profoundly as he boiled the kettle
  and made his tea, but still without result; and when, later in the evening,
  he locked up the house and directed his accustomed steps towards the Black
  Bull Inn, he was still without the vestige of a plan. And yet the change in
  his circumstances had not been without some slight and subtle influence; for,
  yielding to an impulse of which he was hardly conscious, he had, just before
  starting, transferred, from the oaken chest in his bedroom, in which he kept
  his little savings, no less a sum than fifteen shillings to the pocket of his
  mole-skin trousers.</p>

  <p>He was not the first to arrive in the tap-room of the "Black Bull." By no
  means. Over a dozen rustics had already arrived, and were at the moment
  recreating themselves by throwing darts at a cork target on the wall, and
  backing their respective abilities by small wagers. As Barnabas entered, old
  Joe Gammet was in the very act of taking aim; not a particularly good aim it
  seemed, for the dart ultimately found a billet in the corner of an adjacent
  picture frame.</p>

  <p>"I'll 'ave that shot over again," the wily old rustic affirmed, with great
  presence of mind. "This 'ere Barney a-baulked me a-comin' in so
  sudden-like."</p>

  <p>And, regardless of the protests of his disconcerted comrades, he stolidly
  pulled the dart out of the frame, returned to his station, and forthwith made
  a bull's-eye.</p>

  <p>In the inevitable dispute that followed as to the payment of the wager,
  Barnabas found himself implicated by the ingenious Gammet, who sought thus to
  divert the attention of the losers. But Barnabas was no gambler, and with
  equal adroitness, he proceeded to excuse himself.</p>

  <p>"My 'and ain't steady enough, Joe," said he. "Tain't recovered yet from
  that there fish of yourn."</p>

  <p>Old Gammet snorted disdainfully. "You makes a rare outcry, you do," said
  he, "about a few 'eaps o' nice, fresh fish."</p>

  <p>"A few!" exclaimed Barnabas. "Dunno what you call a few. There was upwards
  of eighty 'eaps of 'em."</p>

  <p>"Upwards o' ninety, Barney," corrected Gammet.</p>

  <p>Barnabas shook his head. "Upwards of eighty, I should say," said he. The
  actual number had escaped him for the moment, and his rejoinder was dictated
  by the mere habit of contradiction inherent in the British rustic. But Gammet
  took him up sharply. "I tell yer there was over ninety o' them 'eaps," he
  said dogmatically.</p>

  <p>The definiteness of the statement aroused Mr. Mudge's attention, and,
  rapidly recalling the actual numbers, with the little subtraction sum worked
  by Mrs. Money, he said in a dogged tone:</p>

  <p>"Not ninety, Joe, over eighty. I looked at them 'eaps carefully and I've
  got a educated eye."</p>

  <p>"Look 'ere!" exclaimed Gammet, in suppressed excitement, "you ain't the
  only cove wot's got a educated eye. I got one, too, and I tell yer there's
  over ninety o' them 'eaps, and I'll bet yer a shullin' I'm right."</p>

  <p>Barnabas smiled a discreet smile. "I never bets, Joe," said he, "and you
  knows it. But, all the same, there worn't ninety o' them 'caps," and with
  this he strolled through into the bar to obtain the refreshment necessary for
  the continuance of the discussion, and also to reflect at leisure on the
  situation. When he returned with his tankard of ale, he was aware of a
  certain ill-concealed expectancy in the aspect of his rustic acquaintances,
  strongly suggestive, to his mind of a secret understanding; and his agile
  intellect instantly framed an appropriate course of action.</p>

  <p>"Uncommon sudden this 'ot weather's set in," he remarked to the company in
  general.</p>

  <p>"Remarkable," agreed Gammet, "but to return to this 'ere fish--"</p>

  <p>"Not me," said Barnabas, "I've had enough o' that there fish. 'Twixt
  eighty and ninety 'eaps of 'em--"</p>

  <p>"Over ninety," interrupted Gammet.</p>

  <p>"Not over," retorted Barnabas. "Under ninety, I say, and I reckon I can
  trust my eye to a dozen or so."</p>

  <p>"There's more'n ninety," said Gammet; and, as Barnabas shook his head once
  more, old Gammet continued eagerly: "Why don't yer back yer opinion if yer'e
  so bloomin' cocksure?"</p>

  <p>"'Twouldn't be fair," said Barnabas. "I ain't never wrong in a matter o'
  numbers."</p>

  <p>A howl of derision from the assembled company greeted this boastful
  statement, and Barnabas was so earnestly invited by the assembled rustics to
  pouch old Gammet's "shullin'," that he, at length, and with much show of
  reluctance, accepted the wager. But no sooner were the preliminaries
  arranged, than Bob Chalmers, the miller, came forward and said he'd have a
  shullin's worth, too, and his example being followed, one after the other, by
  the rest of the company, Barnabas found himself committed to the extent of
  twelve shillings; which sum was duly carried in procession by the rustic
  sportsmen into the bar and deposited with the counterstakes in the custody of
  the landlord; who, in his turn becoming inoculated, invested a shilling
  himself. Then the whole twenty-six shillings in assorted coinage having been
  lodged in an empty Toby jug, and the bar being placed in the care of the
  landlord's wife, the whole company of gamesters set forth together to inspect
  the deceased leviathans.</p>

  <p>"Now then," said old Gammet, as the party halted at the entrance to the
  field, and the wagerers furtively produced pocket handkerchiefs 'let's be
  clear about this 'ere bet. I say there's over ninety o' them 'eaps and you
  say there's under ninety. Ain't that right?</p>

  <p>"Under ninety it is," agreed Barnabas, and with this the procession
  entered the field.</p>

  <p>The procedure was deliberate and exhaustively thorough. Sam Pullet's new
  ash sapling, that he had cut that very day, was adopted as a tally-stick, and
  as the procession halted opposite each malodorous heap it was registered by a
  notch cut on the stick. The process took time, especially as there was a
  tendency to periodic misunderstandings as to which heap the last notch
  referred to; but at length, after four false starts had been made and
  corrected by beginning again de novo, the entire round was completed, and all
  that remained was to count the notches. This task was assigned to the
  landlord, and as that sportsman reached the last notch, and falteringly
  pronounced the word, "eighty-eight," he turned a reproachful eye on Joe
  Gammet.</p>

  <p>"You've made a mistake, Tom," exclaimed the chap-fallen Joseph, who had,
  however, already detected the discrepancy, but despairingly strove to
  temporise. He took the stick from the landlord, and, running his fingers down
  the notches, continued, with ill-feigned triumph: "There, I told yer so,
  ninety-one it is, ninety-one, I makes it."</p>

  <p>"Then you makes it wrong," said Barnabas; and the stick being solemnly
  passed round, elicited the unanimous verdict of eighty-eight, and a general
  lowering of the sportsmen's visages. Three times more did that melancholy
  procession slowly perambulate that marine necropolis, and each time the same
  depressing result emerged. At the end of the third perambulation there was a
  deathly silence, and then Bob Chalmers broke into open reproaches.</p>

  <p>"Look 'ere, Joe Gammet!" he exclaimed, gloomily, "what's the meanin' o'
  this 'ere? You told us as how you'd counted 'em yourself. It's my belief as
  it's a put-up job."</p>

  <p>"Nothun o' the kind," retorted Gammet. "Ninety-one 'eaps I counted afore I
  come away. Somebody 'as bin and stole three of 'em," and here he fixed a
  suspicious eye on Barnabas, who retorted sarcastically by offering to turn
  out his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Stole yer grandmother, Joe," the landlord growled somewhat obscurely.
  "Who's a-goin' to steal rotten fish?"</p>

  <p>Joe Gammet was about to make an angry rejoinder, possibly resenting the
  singular ancestry ascribed to him by the landlord's last remark, when
  Barnabas blandly interposed with the suggestion that they should return and
  refresh on the proceeds of the gamble; on which there were signs of reviving
  cheerfulness, especially on the part of the landlord.</p>

  <p>The company which left the "Black Bull" that evening was hilarious beyond
  all precedent, but none of the roysterers staggered homewards in a more
  joyous frame than did Barnabas Mudge. For he had found a solution to his
  problem. By this chance, foolish incident he had found a way to that
  appearance of modest affluence that he had justly considered necessary to his
  safety. With characteristic energy and judgment he followed out the policy
  thus suggested by chance. A judicious measurement, privately taken, of the
  sun-dial on the church porch, with another of the tap-room table, served with
  due diplomacy to evolve another wager; secret inspections of the weather
  forecasts in the papers at the village library not only made him an authority
  on meteorology, but enriched him to the extent of four and threepence. After
  a few such demonstrations of his infallibility, the cautious rustics began to
  decline his invitations to back their opinions; but although his actual
  activities thus necessarily came to an end, a general vague belief grew up,
  and was fostered by him, that his unerring judgment and never-failing luck
  were furnishing him with a handsome increase of income.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that Barnabas Mudge embarked on the one and only
  real gamble of his life. It came about in this wise; returning homeward by a
  foot-path across the fields, he suddenly perceived a smart-looking gig, drawn
  by a handsome, mettlesome horse, careering wildly down an adjacent cart
  track. From the fact that the gig was empty, Barnabas naturally inferred that
  the horse had bolted, and as he knew that the track led direct to the steep
  edge of a gravel pit, he perceived that a disaster was imminent. Now Mr.
  Mudge was not only a man of intellect; he was also a man of action. The
  galloping horse was yet some distance away, and there was still time for some
  effort to avert the catastrophe. Accordingly, he ran across the field, and,
  lurking behind a bush that bordered the cart track, awaited the approach of
  the runaway until the latter had advanced to within some thirty or forty
  yards, when he darted out, cap in hand, and proceeded to execute a sort of
  fandango with much flourishing of arms and encouraging exhortations; as a
  result of which the astonished horse stopped dead to observe this amazing
  apparition, and before he could recover his wits, Barnabas had swooped down
  on him and grabbed him by the bridle. A few seconds later, while Barnabas was
  still soothing his captive's troubled spirit by equine blandishments, a small
  man appeared on the cart track, running as fast as two extremely spindly and
  slightly bandy legs would propel him, and, approaching breathlessly,
  introduced himself as the proprietor of the horse.</p>

  <p>"You've had a narrow squeak, you have," said Barnabas. "Another hundred
  yards, and he'd have been in the gravel pit."</p>

  <p>"I know," said the new-comer. "I thought of that pit as soon as the beggar
  started. You're a trump, that's what you are, my lad," and his hand strayed
  towards his breeches pocket.</p>

  <p>And here, once again, we perceive the subtle effect of the invaluable jar
  of gold. A month ago, Barnabas would have pocketed gleefully the two
  sovereigns that were exhibited in the stranger's palm. But now he was a man
  of means and could afford to indulge in the expensive luxury of pride.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," he said, magnanimously waving the sovereigns away. "I'm
  glad to have been able to help you, but I reckon you'd have done the same for
  me."</p>

  <p>The horsey gentleman returned the coins to his pocket, somewhat
  reluctantly. "Don't see that you need be so blooming proud," he said, as he
  relieved Barnabas of his charge; "however, if you won't take a tip in hard
  cash, perhaps you'll take a tip of another kind; only, mind you," he added
  impressively, "what I'm going to tell you mustn't go any farther. Is that
  agreed?"</p>

  <p>Barnabas gave the required assurance, and the other resumed:</p>

  <p>"Now, listen to me. I'm a trainer--name of Bates; you may have heard of
  me. Well now, I've got a regular soft thing on, and I'm going to take you
  into it, only, you mustn't let on to a living soul. You know the Imperial
  Cup's going to be run for next week at Newmarket." Barnabas nodded. "Well
  now, there are two outsiders entered for the first two races; King Tom and
  Columbine. There'll be long odds against them both. Now, if you take those
  odds, you'll have as near as may be a dead cert. That's a tip that's worth
  money, and I tell you again to keep it to yourself."</p>

  <p>With this and a touch of the hat, he started forward with the mollified
  horse, leaving Barnabas to return to the foot-path.</p>

  <p>Now, Mr. Mudge, as we have said, was no gambler, and his idea of a "dead
  cert" was not quite the same as a sporting man's. He was flattered by the
  possession of this special information, but it did not occur to him to make
  any use of it; indeed, the whole affair had faded from his mind when a chance
  circumstance recalled it. It was on the evening of the first day of the races
  that he happened to be in the bar of the "Black Bull" with one or two of his
  acquaintances. The occasion was a somewhat special one, for, having lured
  some misguided rustic--much against the advice of his friends--into a bet, he
  had just brought off a "dead cert" of his own kind, and was in the very act
  of receiving payment, when a gig stopped at the inn door, and a stout,
  red-faced man got down and entered. The new-comer was well known to the
  denizens of the "Black Bull," being none other than Mr. Sandys, the famous
  bookmaker; a gentleman of suave and genial manners, especially on the present
  occasion, he having, as he expressed it, done rather a good line during the
  day. He was even disposed to be facetious, for having assuaged his thirst
  with a preliminary gulp, he smiled round on the awe-stricken yokels, and
  invited them jointly and severally to try a bout with Fickle Fortune.</p>

  <p>"Hey!" said he, sticking a fat thumb into Barnabas' ribs, "what do you
  say? Smart-looking chap like you ought to be ready to back his fancy. Come
  now, what can I do for you?" and here he produced a fat, leather-covered
  volume and licked the point of a lead pencil.</p>

  <p>And then it was that Barnabas Mudge went stark mad. And yet, perhaps, not
  so mad as he seemed; for in that moment, it flashed upon him that even to
  lose money gloriously, magnificently, was to add to that reputation that he
  was so carefully cultivating.</p>

  <p>"How do the odds go?" he asked carelessly; and the yokels drew nearer with
  dilated eyes, while the landlord rested his knuckles on the counter and
  leaned forward inquisitively. Mr. Sandys produced a list of the fixtures, and
  began to read off numerical statements which sounded like the delirious
  mutterings of an insane stockbroker.</p>

  <p>"What about King Tom?" inquired Barnabas. "He's in the first event I
  see."</p>

  <p>The bookmaker shook his head. "No class," said he, and added,
  altruistically, "Don't you go chucking your coppers away on dark 'orses."</p>

  <p>"And then," pursued Barnabas, ignoring Mr. Sandys' really well-meant
  advice, "there's Columbine. She's in the second event, I see."</p>

  <p>Mr. Sandys emptied his glass with an impatient gulp. "Another outsider,"
  said he. "Hasn't got a bloomin' look in. You take my tip, and put your money
  on a horse that's known."</p>

  <p>Barnabas took a quick glance round at the circle of open-mouthed rustics,
  and then announced bumptiously. "I'm a goin' to back my fancy, and I fancies
  them two 'orses. What'll you give me on the double event?"</p>

  <p>The bookmaker was so taken aback that he had to call for another whisky
  and soda.</p>

  <p>"Double event," he roared. "I won't do it. It would be just picking your
  pocket, and I don't pick the pockets of working men."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Barnabas, "then I must take my money to some one
  else."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you're going to make somebody a present," said Mr. Sandys, "it may
  as well be me as anyone else. I'll give yer a hundred to one. That won't hurt
  you. How much shall we say? A bob?"</p>

  <p>Barnabas turned to the bulging-eyed landlord and asked in a casual tone:
  "Tom, can you let me 'ave such a thing as twenty pound? You shall have it
  back in half an hour."</p>

  <p>There was a breathless silence for two or three seconds. But the gambling
  fever had seized the landlord as well as Barnabas. Without a word, he retired
  to some secret lair whence he presently returned with four new five-pound
  notes.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the bookmaker, "if you're clean off your onion, there's
  nothing more to be said; only, I warn you, you'll lose your money. Won't you
  think better of it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm a-goin' to back my fancy," said Barnabas doggedly; upon which Mr.
  Sandys formally registered the transaction, explaining that he could not
  receive the money in a public place, but that it was to be sent to his
  office.</p>

  <p>Having once committed himself to this rash enterprise, Barnabas acted his
  part consistently. The entreaties of the excited yokels that he would attend
  the race in person and see that he got fair play, he ignored with magnanimous
  calm and went about his ordinary business as though a twenty-pound wager were
  a mere unconsidered trifle, and the oaken chest, from which he had extracted
  the bulk of his savings, were the repository of untold wealth. But he was the
  only calm person in the village; and when, in the waning afternoon, he betook
  himself to the "Black Bull," to await the return of the bookmaker, he found
  the tap-room packed and overflowing into the bar, where the landlord was
  compressing a month's business into a couple of hours.</p>

  <p>In the interval, his brief attack of speculative mania had died out, and
  he had come prepared to increase his growing reputation by a stoical
  indifference to the loss that he had already accepted as inevitable; and
  while a mob of agitated yokels stood out in the road, eagerly watching for
  the returning party, Barnabas sat in the Wycombe arm-chair and stolidly read
  the morning paper, an object of respectful and admiring astonishment to the
  other inmates of the tap-room.</p>

  <p>About five o'clock, there suddenly arose a clamour from without. A score
  of heads, round-eyed with excitement, appeared at the open window, and a
  score of voices strove to break in upon his philosophic calm.</p>

  <p>"He's a-comin', Barney! He's a-passin' the finger-post now! He's opposight
  the pond!" and then, after a brief, but clamorous interval, "Here he is!" and
  the unmoved Barnabas, with his eye glued to an advertisement for a
  respectable housemaid, heard the gig stop, and was then aware of an
  irritable, but familiar voice calling out in the bar: "Where's that feller
  Mudge? Is he here?"</p>

  <p>Barnabas laid down the paper and yawned. Then he rose and stretched
  himself, and, sauntering out into the bar, perceived Mr. Sandys, surrounded
  by a closely-packed mob of yokels, and grasping a cheque-book and a fountain
  pen. But he was no longer genial, nor in the least inclined to be facetious.
  On the contrary he greeted Barnabas with a sour grin and slapped his
  cheque-book down on the only clean spot on the counter.</p>

  <p>"So, here you are," said he. "Confound you! Do you know you've eaten up
  the whole of my earnings?"</p>

  <p>Barnabas muttered an apology, being somewhat confused by the unwonted
  conduct of the usually genial Sandys, and stood by, watching in some
  bewilderment, as the bookmaker scribbled on a cheque, accompanying the
  process with disparaging comments.</p>

  <p>"S'welp me! Cleaned out by a bloomin' chaw bacon! Better get a bloomin'
  nurse to come round with me next time. There 'y'are!"</p>

  <p>There was a soft sound of rending, and the astonished Barnabas found
  himself regarding an elongated slip of mauve paper that flickered at the end
  of his nose. With slowly dawning comprehension, he took the cheque and
  laboriously spelled out its mandate to pay to Barnabas Mudge the sum of two
  thousand pounds; and he was still staring at it, in absolute stupefaction, as
  the wheels of the bookmaker's gig rolled away down the road.</p>

  <p>It is notorious that circumstances alter cases. As Barnabas betook himself
  homeward with the two thousand pound cheque in his pocket, the jar of gold
  which had hitherto monopolised his field of mental vision, sank into sudden
  insignificance. He even debated whether it were not better publicly to
  announce the discovery of the treasure and so put himself definitely on the
  right side of the law; but a renewed inspection of the jar, with its
  glittering contents, produced the inevitable result. Cupidity overcame
  discretion.</p>

  <p>It was two days later that he set out for the neighbouring market town for
  the purpose of opening an account at the bank to which the landlord of the
  "Black Bull" had introduced him. Before starting, he had once more brought
  forth the jar from its hiding-place, with a half-formed intention of taking
  that with him, too. But the singular identity of date on the coins deterred
  him; for the strange coincidence would inevitably be noticed by the officials
  of the bank, and notice was precisely what Barnabas did not desire. So he
  returned the jar to its hiding-place, to serve as a store to be drawn upon
  for current expenditure, but first, he took from it ten sovereigns, which he
  dropped into his trousers pocket. With two thousand pounds at the bank, he
  could surely afford to jingle a little loose gold.</p>

  <p>It was not unobserved by Barnabas that his appearance at the bank in his
  very indifferent best suit created a somewhat unfavourable impression, and he
  decided anon to furnish himself with raiment more suitable to his new
  station.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the eight-mile walk had developed an appetite and an agreeable
  thirst which he decided to assuage, regardless of expense, at the "King's
  Head." But here, too, his costume exposed him to humiliations;
  notwithstanding which, he worked his way stolidly through the entire bill of
  fare, watched superciliously by an obviously suspicious waiter, by whom the
  rather startling bill of costs was laid beside his plate before he had fairly
  finished his fourth slab of cheese.</p>

  <p>Barnabas, however, was not offended. On the contrary, the bill afforded
  him the means of vindicating his position; which he did by carelessly
  dropping on it one of the golden gifts of benevolent Providence. The effect,
  however, on the waiter was not quite what he had hoped; for that supercilious
  menial, as he retired, turned the coin over and over in his palm as if he
  were a numismatist inspecting a specimen of some rare and ancient coinage. If
  Barnabas could have followed him into the office, he would have seen that
  this numismatic enthusiasm was actually communicated to the manager; by whom
  the coin was closely examined, rung on the desk and finally weighed in a very
  queer little balance.</p>

  <p>"Now then," said Barnabas to the waiter, who lurked furtively in the
  vicinity of his seat, with a futile pretence of having forgotten him, "how
  much longer are you going to be with that there change?"</p>

  <p>"Yessir, coming, sir, in one minute," the waiter replied, casting an
  expectant look towards the door; which at that very moment opened to admit
  three persons of whom one wore the becoming costume of the local police. The
  three strangers and the waiter deliberately converged upon Barnabas, and the
  waiter remarked, more lucidly than grammatically: "This is 'im!"</p>

  <p>Barnabas rose, with a chilly sensation at his spine and a premonition of
  evil. One of the strangers, who looked like a guardsman in mufti, held out
  his hand, on which lay a sovereign, and opened his mouth and spake:</p>

  <p>"I am a police officer. I am going to arrest you on a charge of uttering
  counterfeit coin, and it's my duty to caution you that anything you say will
  be used in evidence against you."</p>

  <p>Barnabas broke out into a cold sweat. "Do you mean to tell me," he
  faltered, "that that is a bad sovereign?"</p>

  <p>"Rank bad 'un," replied the officer, suddenly dropping his legal
  phraseology, "and I want to know if you've got any more." Here Barnabas was
  led unresisting, to the office, where, his pockets being expertly turned out,
  the other nine sovereigns were brought to light, and laid in an incriminating
  row on the desk.</p>

  <p>"Same old lot!" said the detective, as he ran his eye rapidly over them.
  "I thought we'd seen the last of Fred Gilbert's masterpieces. Where did yer
  get this stuff, young man?"</p>

  <p>Now Barnabas, as we have said, was a man of intellect; and, at the first
  appearance of the police, had been completely enlightened by a flash of
  intuition; and he now saw clearly that his only chance lay in a frank
  statement of the actual facts. He accordingly recited in detail the
  circumstances attending the discovery of the treasure, and he was encouraged
  as he proceeded to observe a slow grin spreading over the officer's
  countenance.</p>

  <p>"Where do you say this house was?" the detective asked.</p>

  <p>"Harebell Lane, Baconsfield. Last house on the right 'and side."</p>

  <p>The detective chuckled. "That's the place," said he. "We went through it
  most carefully after Freddie was nobbled at Newmarket, but couldn't find a
  single piece. Rare downy bird was Frederick. Kept all his moulds and stuff at
  his place in London. However, you'll have to come along, young man, for if
  you didn't make this snide money, you prigged it, on your own showing, though
  I don't suppose the magistrates will be hard on you."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, they were not. On the contrary, they were disposed to
  be hilarious to the verge of impropriety; for when Barnabas was charged with
  "having unlawfully concealed from the knowledge of our Lord the King the
  finding of a certain treasure," the entire Court, including the prosecuting
  detective, broke into the broadest of grins; and when the Clerk rose to point
  out to their Worships that the word "treasure" was defined in the statute as
  "any gold or silver in coin, plate, or bullion, hidden in ancient times,"
  whereas, the present treasure consisted in a quantity of base metal, the
  grins gave way to audible chuckles, and the amused justices agreed to take
  advantage of the legal quibble and acquit the prisoner.</p>

  <p>On the very same day, Barnabas surrendered the fateful jar to the
  detective as "Trustee of our Lord the King," and ventured smilingly to
  express the hope that His Majesty would make no improper use of his newly
  acquired wealth.</p>

  <p>It is now some years since these stirring events befell, years which have
  justified Fortune in the favours she was pleased to bestow on Barnabas Mudge;
  whose honoured name has since then not only adorned a multitude of
  contractors' noticeboards, but has occasionally appeared at the foot of
  cheques compared with which the memorable draft of Mr. Sandys would be a mere
  bagatelle.</p>
