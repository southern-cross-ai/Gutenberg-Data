<p class="caption">Exhilarating climbs are included in many of
Victoria's walks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Walking for health and pleasure is increasing in popularity in
Victoria every year.</p>

<p>In recent times the rare beauty of much of Victoria's
countryside, and the splendid grandeur and rich luxuriance of the
mountains and valleys of this State have become better and better
known.</p>

<p>No holiday season passes without innumerable parties of healthy,
enthusiastic boys and men, and, in these days of energetic
womanhood, young women, too, taking the road for health and
pleasure&mdash;pleasure which no other form of travel can give.</p>

<p>Of all forms of exercise, there is, perhaps, none better or more
convenient than that of walking. Walking brings us out into the
open, where the air is purest. It increases respiration, bringing
greater supplies of pure oxygen to the lungs, and insuring a pure
blood stream, without which we cannot feel fit and well. It makes
the heart beat firmer, and it clears the brain, giving a feeling of
exhilaration and well-being which, alone, makes this exercise well
worth while.</p>

<p>As a recreation walking is not easily surpassed. As an exercise
it is known by all health authorities and students of physical
culture to be one of the best which the human being can enjoy.</p>

<p>The walker is master of his own destiny. He may stop where he
will and proceed as he likes; he may loiter amid the forest to boil
his billy in a delightful spot by the stream; he may diverge as he
wishes to enjoy more thoroughly the glories for which our
magnificent mountain areas are so notable.</p>

<p>Victoria is splendidly suited to the needs of the walker. There
are fine mountain routes with beautiful scenic views; there are
valleys full of infinite charm.</p>

<p>The railways give ready access to every point to which the
walker's attention is here directed, and the railway ticket
facilities are such that there is no difficulty in the way of
leaving a train at one point and joining another at a remotely
distant station, after spending unforgettable days revelling in the
rare beauty or the splendid majesty of the intervening wilds.</p>

<p>All of the walks specified herein have been explored and some
have been frequently traversed by enthusiastic walkers. Some are
over well-made roads, others over mere bridle tracks. Some link up
with all the comforts of civilisation; others are just threads
which string together the primitive, though always homely, comforts
of pioneering settlements.</p>

<p>The list mentioned in this folder by no means represents all the
walks available in this State, neither are the descriptions in any
way comprehensive. Practically all the walks can be undertaken in
the reverse direction to those shown herein.</p>

<p>The object of the folder is to point out the most desirable
routes. Additional particulars may be obtained from the Government
Tourist Bureau, Queen's Walk, opposite Town Hall, Melbourne, or
from the Secretary of the Melbourne Amateur Walking and Touring
Club, Mr. W. F. Waters, 343 Little Collins-street, Melbourne, C1,
or the Secretary of the Melbourne Women's Walking Club, Miss A.
Creaton, 95 Queen Street, Melbourne, Cl.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Walks in Mt. Buffalo National Park</h2>

<p>Mt. Buffalo National Park might well be termed the walker's
paradise, because in this wonderful region (using the superb Chalet
as headquarters) there are innumerable walks which may he taken to
points of enthralling interest.</p>

<p>A feature of walking in the Mt. Buffalo National Park is that
one may undertake walks to many of the vantage points on the
Plateau without the arduous climbing usually associated with a
mountain holiday. Once the tourist arrives at The Chalet by motor
there is no necessity for further climbing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are climbs which may be definitely
undertaken by the more venturesome. Strange as it may seem, there
are areas in the Mt. Buffalo National Park which have never been
thoroughly explored. This offers a thrilling field for the
mountaineer.</p>

<p>Walking in the Mt. Buffalo National Park is undertaken under
ideal conditions. Fine tracks have been constructed to the
principal points, and the air on the high altitude of the Plateau
is bracing and invigorating.</p>

<p>Detailed information concerning the numerous walks in the Mt.
Buffalo National Park is available in a special booklet,
"Delightful Walks around Mt. Buffalo National Park," issued free on
application by letter or in person to the Government Tourist
Bureau.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Importance of Good Equipment</h2>

<p>For the enjoyment of a walk one needs to be properly equipped. A
Rucksack, a water bottle (such as a military water bottle), and
other things are very desirable.</p>

<p>A list of equipment which might well be taken on a walking trip
is shown hereunder&mdash;</p>

<p>FOR MEN.&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Light woollen underwear.</li>

<li>Light shirt with soft collar.</li>

<li>Breeches.</li>

<li>Leggings or puttees.</li>

<li>Alternatively, shorts and stockings might be included as these
make a very suitable and comfortable garb.</li>

<li>Strong waterproof boots.</li>

<li>Spare pairs of sox, according to the length of the walk.</li>

<li>Haversack.</li>

<li>Blanket (if camping in hut or sleeping out).</li>

<li>Portable first-aid outfit.</li>

<li>Snake bite remedy.</li>

<li>Good length of stout card.</li>

<li>Jack-knife.</li>

<li>Matches.</li>

<li>Compass.</li>
</ul>

<p>FOR WOMEN.&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Women are advised to have simple, strong, serviceable
clothes.</li>

<li>Good strong boots, with low heels.</li>

<li>For long walks, men's riding breeches and boots might be found
desirable.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the longer walks, when it is advisable to carry food, it is
suggested that, in order to save weight, equipment should include
only those articles actually required.</p>

<hr>

<h2>List of Desirable Walks</h2>

<p>Hereunder is a list of walks. In each case it is assumed that
the walker is starting from Melbourne. The total period which each
should reasonably occupy is shown.</p>

<p>Tourist maps to indicate the routes of most of these walks may
be obtained at the Government Tourist Bureau.</p>

<p>Good train services connect either with the starting or
finishing points for the various walks. Timetables are varied
according to the season of the year. Before undertaking any of the
walks it is advisable to consult a current timetable or confer with
station staffs or the Government Tourist Bureau. Special facilities
are granted for round trips, enabling return to the city by a
different rail route.</p>

<p>Most of the information concerning the walks listed hereunder
has been supplied by Mr. R. H. Croll, one of the leading
authorities on walking in Victoria, and by Mr. W. F. Waters,
Secretary of the Melbourne Amateur Walking and Touring Club. Mr.
Croll's books, "The Open Road in Victoria," and " Along the Track,"
deal in detail with many of these walks.</p>

<p>Details concerning some of the walks were supplied by Mr. J. M.
Reed, I.S.O., ex-Chairman of the State Tourist Committee.</p>

Miles)<br>
Via Freeburgh (Six or more Days&mdash;85 Miles)<br>
Via Mt. Hotham (Seven or more Days-95 miles)<br>
<i>Under Snow between May and November</i></p>

<p>Train to Bright (196 miles). There are three routes by which the
Plains may be reached; the first via Tawonga and Mt. Fainter, the
second via Freeburgh and Dungey's track, and the third via Mt.
Hotham and Dibbin's Hut.</p>

<p>If the first is chosen follow the road to Tawonga. Accommodation
at hotel (19 miles). Next day via the Tawonga track to Bogong
Jack's Hut (13½ miles), thence on to Mt. Fainter (6,160 feet) and
follow track to Tawonga Hut (7 miles). Few old snow poles still
standing along the track. Thence from hut down on to flat and
through stockyard fence, following line of newly-erected but
unnumbered snow poles out on to the plains (1½ miles), to the
vicinity of Mt. Jim, where a line of numbered snow poles from
Blair's Hut is met and joined at Pole No. 27, together with a
numbered line from Dibbin's Hut.</p>

<p>If the Dungey's track route is chosen, turn off at the Freeburgh
Bridge and follow track up a tributary of the Ovens, crossing over
into the Kiewa watershed at Symond's Gap to Lawler's Hut (18 miles)
and on to Blair's Hut, a further 6 miles. From Blair's Hut a cut
track sidles up on to the plains, the first of the snow poles being
met with where the timber begins to thin out. These poles bear
consecutive numbers on oval plates, and at No. 27 the line of
unnumbered poles from Tawonga Hut junctions with the line of
numbered poles (square plates) from Dibbin's Hut.</p>

<p>If the route via Mt. Hotham is chosen, walk or travel by car to
Harrietville (16 miles). From thence two routes to Hotham are
available:-</p>

<p>(1) by way of Mt. Feathertop and the Razorback (14 miles);
or,</p>

<p>(2) by way of Mt. St. Bernard and the Alpine road (20
miles).</p>

<p>Accommodation at The Bungalow, Mt. Feathertop, the Cottage at
Mt. Hotham or at the Hospice at Mt. St. Bernard. Thence follow the
'phone line back on to Mt. Hotham and turn off at the noticeboard
indicating route to Bogong High Plains, and follow the line of snow
poles bearing consecutive numbers on square plates. In four miles
the route will lead into the head of the Cobungra River where
Dibbin's Hut is situated. Another four miles up on to and across
the plains will lead to pole No. 27 of the line of poles from
Blair's Hut, and the junction of the line of unnumbered poles from
the Tawonga Hut.</p>

<p>The line of poles bearing consecutive numbers on oval plates
then leads easterly across the plains, the line bearing numbers on
square plates terminating at the junction.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of pole No. 150 look for the turn-off into the
Tourist Committee's Hut, a commodious building erected for the
convenience and use of skiers and walkers.</p>

<p>It will be a suitable base from which to make side trips to
various points of interest on the plains. From the new Hut the line
continues to Wallace's Hut, 1 mile (off to the side and down in
valley), thence on to Kelly's and Fitzgerald's Huts, a further 4
miles.</p>

<p>From Kelly's Hut return to the snow pole line and follow it down
on to Wildhorse Creek and thence down to Big River Bridge on Glen
Wills&mdash;Omeo road.</p>

<p>Twelve miles further on is the Anglers' Rest Hotel and a further
18 miles will lead into Omeo.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Between the months of May and November the snow lies deeply on
the plains, and during that period the trip should be attempted
only by experienced skiers and those accustomed to snow
conditions.</p>

<p>If desired, the services of guides can he hired during either
winter or summer months.</p>

<p>From Omeo there is a choice of three routes for returning to
Melbourne as follows:&mdash;</p>

<hr>

<h3>15.&mdash;Omeo to Bruthen</h3>

<p class="cp">(Four or more Days&mdash;75 Miles)</p>

<p>Rail to Bairnsdale (170¼ miles), thence car to Omeo. The main
highway is followed for the whole distance. Soon after leaving Omeo
the Great Dividing Range is crossed at either Tongio Gap or
Pointing's Gap, and Swift's Creek is reached in 20 miles by the
former route or 24 miles by the latter route. Here the pedestrian
is in the beautiful Tambo Valley, which is traversed until Bruthen,
on the main Gippsland railway line, is reached.</p>

<p>The small hamlets of Doctor's Flat, 4 miles beyond Swift's Creek
(accommodation), Ensay (accommodation) 11 miles further on, Tambo
Crossing (accommodation) a further 12 miles, and Double Bridges, 12

<p class="cp">
</p>

<p>(Six Days&mdash;73 Miles)</p>

<p>Rail to Forrest (103 miles), thence to Apollo Bay by road (18
miles). The coastline is then followed from Apollo Bay to Glen
Aire, a distance of 32 miles. On this section accommodation is not
available until Glen Aire is reached, and it is essential,
therefore, that provision be made to camp out. Glen Aire to
Rivernook (19 miles) is the next stage, and the journey to Port
Campbell (15 miles) may be accomplished in one day. The final
stage, Port Campbell to Peterborough, is a distance of 7 miles.
From Peterborough the railhead at Camperdown (35 miles) may he
reached by car, thence return by train to Melbourne 123¼

<h3>17.&mdash;Wilson's Promontory</h3>

<p class="cp">(National Park)<br>
(A Week or 10 Days)</p>

<p>Connected with the mainland by an isthmus which is bounded by
the waters of Waratah Bay on the one side and those of Corner Inlet
on the other, Wilson's Promontory reaches farther south than any
other land on the Australian coast.</p>

<p>The Promontory, a National Park with an area of 100,000 acres,
may be reached from any one of three railway stations, viz., Fish
Creek, Foster or Bennison.</p>

<p>From Fish Creek or Foster the route is by road to Darby (roughly
30 miles from either place), where the National Park Chalet is
located. To journey from Bennison, however, involves crossing the
waters of Corner Inlet to the southwest corner by boat, and then
travelling overland for about 9 miles to Darby.</p>

<p>At Darby, comfortable accommodation may be obtained, or, for
those who desire it, a hut is available to camp in; also a camping
ground on which to pitch tents.</p>

<p>From here many fine tours may be made among the ranges and along
the coast. Oberon Bay (12 miles) is probably one of the best
coastal trips, and Lilly Pilly Gully is an outstanding inland
excursion (7 miles). The resources of the Park from the touring
point of view are, however, almost inexhaustible and provide
scenery of infinite variety and charm. Before camping is allowed on
the Park, a permit must be obtained from the Secretary of the
National Park Trustees, National Museum, Melbourne.</p>

<p class="cp">(One Day&mdash;10 Miles)</p>

<p>Train to South Morang (16¾ miles). On leaving station take
Whittlesea road until you reach the South Morang Hotel and swing to
the left. Cross the Plenty River. A steady climb and a twist to the
left bring you almost to the summit of the hill. The track bends to
the right to end in a north and south road. Turn north and you will
come to the State school at Tanck's Corner, where a road makes off
on the right for Diamond Creek. Keep straight down the hill and up
the opposite slope. Half a mile from the school there is a
junction; take the road to the right. There are nearly three miles
of this road before you reach the turn-off for Hurstbridge. An
orchard marks the corner where you turn on to the road, on which
you are to go down hill for 2½ miles. At half a mile it branches;

Creek, and just above it is the railway station.</p>

<hr>

<h3>22.&mdash;Hurstbridge&mdash;Panton Hill&mdash;Eltham</h3>

you may reach Panton Hill (3 miles) this way. In about an hour you
will come to a junction board, indicating that you have come 3¼
miles and still have another quarter of a mile to Panton Hill. A
cross road near the small store in the township leads on the one
hand to Diamond Creek and on the other to Watson's Creek and Yarra
Glen. Carry on to Kangaroo Ground, after which a winding siding
with a northerly aspect follows, then on to the township of
Research, after which the going becomes level, and where there is a
bend to the left the railway line will be observed. Follow it for
half a mile to Eltham station.</p>

<hr>

<h3>31.&mdash;Phillip Island</h3>

<p class="cp">(Four or Five Days or More)</p>

<p>It is not possible to do any of the extended walks on Phillip
Island during a day visit, and even residence in Cowes makes some
of the best walks difficult for a single day. For the camper-out
there is plenty of tea-tree and other shelter, and if you follow
the route here described you will need to carry two days'
provisions and arrange for another two days' supply to be picked up
on the road. There is a good road to the Nobbies, also an excellent
beach, a little longer than the road, but more interesting. It
takes in McHaffie's Reef and Cat Bay. Near the latter is Swan Lake,
and a little beyond the lake is a house (Phelan's). You have
travelled about 12 miles, so there is ample time to choose a
suitable camp and see the Nobbies and Seal Rocks.</p>

<p>Head towards Cape Woolamai. Kitty Miller's is a pleasant little
bay, and a couple of miles further on Pyramid Rock looms up, then
some striking hummocks topped with tea-tree. After camping in this
vicinity make a day's excursion to the headland. There is a fair
approach along the west beach until the sand ends. San Remo, on the
mainland, can be seen across the Narrows, and the roofs of
Wonthaggi further east.</p>

<p>On leaving Woolamai, keep on the ridge. You can spend the night
in Newhaven or return to your yesterday's lodging. For your next
day you may take the coastal road to Rhyll, nearer Cowes. A camp
just outside Cowes will place the party in a good position to catch
the boat home on the following morning.</p>

<hr>

<h3>32.&mdash;Warburton to Healesville via Narbethong</h3>

<p class="cp">(Two Days&mdash;25 Miles)</p>

<p>Train to Warburton (47¾ miles). The Mt. Donna Buang road is

down into the Acheron Valley. The camping site is reached in a
further two miles. The route then lies along the valley parallel to
the river, the new road leading out on to the Blacks' Spur road
near the Narbethong township (12 miles).</p>

<p>The 14 miles thence into Healesville can be negotiated by
service car, or the distance can be covered on foot. From
Healesville, train is taken to Melbourne (39 miles).</p>

<p>Train to Warburton (47¾ miles); thence walk or drive to Cement
Creek, whence the well-graded road to the summit of Donna Buang
(4,080 feet), 12 miles from Warburton, is followed. As a winter
trip with snow on the ground this is fairly severe, but it is easy
enough in summer. A ski run has been cut on the summit to enable
skiers to enjoy some running after a fall of snow. More direct
routes are up timber and bush tracks from Warburton. They cut the
distance down to five or six miles, but are for the young and
sturdy only. There is now a comfortable hut on the summit of Mt.
Donna Buang, and a fine view from Lookout Tower. The tour may be
continued to Ben Cairn (6 miles), thence down to Millgrove (7
miles), where the train is met.</p>

mining township on Donnelly's Creek (10 miles). From Donnelly's
Creek there is a steady ascent along the old Coach road past
Edwards' Hill to The Springs (6 miles). There is a hut at the
Springs, and thence if the old road leading northerly along the
spur be followed through fine forest country, it will lead out on
to Mt. Useful, 4720 feet (6 miles), a magnificent viewpoint.</p>

<p>From The Springs follow the old road southerly down the spur to
Seaton (21 miles), and thence on foot or by car to Heyfield
Station. Train to Melbourne (l20½ miles). Camping gear necessary.
This walk can be strongly recommended as it embraces many
interesting features such as the scenery along the valleys of the
Yarra, Jordan, and Donnelly's Creek; the splendid viewpoints such
as those along the road nearing Matlock, and from Matlock Hill, Mt.
Lookout and Mt. Useful; and all the interesting relics along the
route of transport of the old Gold Days in North Gippsland.</p>

generally considered to be even better than that of the Werribee
Gorge.</p>

<hr>

<h3>41.&mdash;Pakenham to Beaconsfield</h3>

<p class="cp">(One Day&mdash;15 Miles)</p>

<p>Train to Pakenham (35½ miles). Keep on the north side of the
railway line and walk through the township towards Melbourne along
the Gippsland road. Little more than a mile out of Pakenham is
Burke's Hotel, on the corner of the Toomuc Valley road, branching
off to the north. Go up the valley until you reach the Toomuc
Valley orchard. Enquire for track through the orchard and ask
permission to use it. Your track comes out on to a broad
thoroughfare opposite the site of an old house. Turn to the left,
and the road will take you up a final spur into Upper Beaconsfield.
Pass along the principal street to the Post Office, near which a
