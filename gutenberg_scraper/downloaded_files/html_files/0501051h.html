<h3>PREFACE TO GEORGE COLLINGRIDGE'S DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA,
PUBLISHED IN 1895.</h3>

<p>Of the many books which have been published on subjects
relating to Australia and Australian History, I am not aware of
any, since my late friend, Mr. R. H. Major's introduction to his
valuable work, "Early Voyages to Terra Australis," which has
attempted a systematic investigation into the earliest
discoveries of the great Southern Island-Continent, and the first
faint indications of knowledge that such a land existed. Mr.
Major's work was published in 1859, at a time when the materials
for such an enquiry were much smaller than at present. The means
of reproducing and distributing copies of the many ancient maps
which are scattered among the various libraries of Europe were
then very imperfect, and the science of Comparative Cartography,
of which the importance is now well recognised, was in its
infancy. For these reasons his discussion, useful though it still
is, cannot be regarded as abreast of modern opportunities. It is,
indeed, after the lapse of more than a third of a century,
somewhat out of date. Having, therefore, been led to give close
attention during several years to the whole subject, I have
thought the time ripe for the present work.</p>

<p>The distance from the great centres and stores of knowledge at
which I have been compelled to labour will excuse to the candid
critic the errors which will no doubt be discovered; yet I feel
some confidence that these will prove to be omissions rather than
positive mistakes. No pains have been spared in investigating the
full body of documents now available.</p>

<p>Though unable to examine personally some manuscripts of
interest and value, I believe I can truly say that I have read
every book and examined every map of real importance to the
question which has been produced in English, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Italian and Dutch. I have corresponded also largely
during the past four years with many of the most eminent members
of the Geographical Societies of London, Paris, Madrid, Lisbon,
Rome, Amsterdam and Neuchatel. To these gentlemen I am deeply
indebted for searches which they have made for me in the
libraries and museums within their reach, for much information
readily and kindly afforded, and for the interest and sympathy
which they had at all times manifested in my labours. My thanks
are due also to the gentlemen in charge of the Sydney Free Public
Library who kindly enriched their collection with many rare, and
very useful volumes of permanent importance which I was unable to
procure myself, and who aided my researches by every means in
their power.</p>

<p>I cannot hope that in a subject so vast and interesting, I
shall be found to have said the last word, yet I trust that my
book may prove to be of value, both in itself, and as directing
the attention of others to a field which should be mainly
explored by residents of Australia. Such as it is, I now send it
forth, with the natural solicitude of a parent, and commend it to
the indulgence of the reader, and the kindly justice of the
critic.</p>

<h3>PUBLISHERS' NOTE.</h3>

<p>Ten years ago, Mr. George Collingridge published "The
Discovery of Australia."--a large quarto volume, bulky, erudite
and expensive. It took its place as a valuable contribution to
the literature of the country, and remains the world-accepted
authority on the important and interesting subject with which it
deals. But it was in nowise suited to the general reader--being
designed more for the scholar than for the person who desired to
conveniently possess himself of authentic information relating to
the earliest annals of Australian discovery.</p>

<p>To meet the requirements of the general reader, and to serve
as a text book of Australian History, the present publication has
been issued as a handy compendium of the original volume.</p>

<p>From this book, all controversial matter has been omitted as
irrelevant to a work intended as a handbook for either scholar or
student.</p>

<p>The valuable facsimiles of rare and ancient maps have been
retained, many illustrations have been included in the text, and
the story of the explorers has been dealt with at greater length
by the author, whose patient antiquarian research, his knowledge
of European and Oriental Languages, and his opportunities as a
member of several Geographical Societies, have given him unusual
facilities for the compilation of a work which may confidently be
expected to find its way into every scholastic, public and
private library in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>THE PUBLISHERS.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>The discovery of a continental island like Australia was not a
deed that could be performed in a day. Many years passed away,
and many voyages to these shores of ours were undertaken by the
leading maritime nations of Europe, before the problematic and
mysterious TERRA AUSTRALIS INCOGNITA of the ancients became
known, even in a summary way, and its insularity and separation
from other lands positively established.</p>

<p>We must not be astonished, therefore, at the strange
discrepancies that occur in early charts and narratives, for it
took time to realize how different portions of our coast lines,
which had been sighted from time to time might be connected, and
how the gaps might be filled in by fresh discoveries and
approximate surveys.</p>

<p>The question as to who first sighted Australia, and placed on
record such discovery, either in the shape of map or narrative,
will, in all probability, ever remain a mystery.</p>

<p>However, that such a record was made appears evident when we
consider certain early charts, follow carefully the testimony
which the evolution of Australian cartography affords, and take
cognisance of various descriptive passages to be found in old
authors.</p>

<p>These passages will be given here in connection with the old
charts, and followed up by the narratives of voyages in search of
the "Great South Land."</p>

<p>The numerous maps and illustrations have been carefully
selected; they will greatly help the student towards
understanding these first pages of the history of Australia.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h4>IN QUEST OF THE SPICE ISLANDS.</h4>

<blockquote>"And the New South rose with her forehead bare--<br>
Her forehead hare to meet the smiling sun--<br>
Australia in her golden panoply;<br>
And far off Empires see her work begun,<br>
And her large hope has compassed every sea."<br>

<p>What was the relative position of European nations in the
arena of maritime discovery at the beginning of the sixteenth
century?</p>

<p>Portugal was then mistress of the sea.</p>

<p>Spain, too, indulging in an awakening yawn, was clutching with
her outstretched hands at the shadowy treasure-islands of an
unfinished dream.</p>

<p>England had not yet launched her navy; Holland had not built
hers.</p>

<p>Portugal had already buried a king--the great grandson of
Edward III. of England--whose enterprise had won for him the name
of Henry the Navigator.</p>

<p>Slowly and sadly--slowly always, sadly often--his vessels had
crept down the west coast of Africa; little by little one captain
had overstepped the distance traversed by his predecessor, until
at last in 1497 a successful voyager actually rounded the
Cape.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-03"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-06.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Portuguese Fleet</b></p>
</center>

<p>Then Portugal, clear of the long wall that had fenced her in
on one side for so many thousands of miles, trod the vast expanse
of waters to the east, and soon began to plant her flag in
various ports of the Indian Ocean. [See Portuguese flags on <a
href="#maps-col-08">Desliens' Map.</a>]</p>

<p>Pushing on further east in search of the Spice Islands, she
found Sumatra, Borneo, the Celebes, Java, Timor, Ceram, the Aru
Islands and Gilolo; she had reached the famous and much coveted
Moluccas, or Spice Islands, and set to work building forts and
establishing trading stations in the same way as England is doing
nowadays in South Africa and elsewhere.*</p>

<blockquote>[* In a chart of the East Indian Archipelago, drawn
probably during the first Portuguese voyages to the Spice Islands
(1511-1513), the island of Gilolo is called Papoia. Many of the
islands situated on the west and north-west coast of New Guinea
became known to the Portuguese at an early date, and were named
collectively OS PAPUAS. The name was subsequently given to the
western parts of New Guinea. Menezes, a Portuguese navigator, is
said to have been driven by a storm to some of these islands,
where he remained awaiting the monsoonal change.]</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile the Spaniards, after the discovery of America by
Columbus, were pursuing their navigations and explorations
westward with the same object in view, and it soon dawned upon
them that a vast ocean separated them from the islands discovered
by the Portuguese.</p>

<p>Magellan was then sent out in search of a westerly passage; he
reached the regions where the Portuguese had established
themselves, and disputes arose as to the limits of the Portuguese
and Spanish boundaries.</p>

<p>Pope Alexander VI. had generously bestowed one-half of the
undiscovered world upon the Spanish, and the other half upon the
Portuguese, charging each nation with the conversion of the
heathen within its prospective domains.</p>

<p>Merely as a fact this is interesting enough, but viewed in the
light of subsequent events it assumes a specific importance.</p>

<p>The actual size of the earth was not known at the time, and
this division of Pope Alexander's, measured from the other side
of the world, resulted in an overlapping and duplicate charting
of the Portuguese and Spanish boundaries in the longitudes of the
Spice Islands,* an overlapping due, no doubt, principally to the
desire of each contending party to include the Spice Islands
within its own hemisphere, but also to the fact that the point of
departure which had been fixed in the vicinity of the Azores, was
subsequently removed westward as far as the mouth of the
Amazons.</p>

<p>If Portugal and Spain had remained to the present day in
possession of their respective hemispheres, the first arrangement
would have given Australia and New Guinea to Portugal; whereas
the second arrangement would have limited her possessions at the
longitude that separates Western Australia from her sister States
to the east, which States would have fallen to the lot of Spain.
Strange to say, this line of demarcation still separates Western
Australia from South Australia so that those two States derive
their boundary demarcation from Pope Alexander's line. A few
years after the discovery of the New World the Spanish Government
found it necessary, in order to regulate her navigations, and
ascertain what new discoveries were being made, to order the
creation of an official map of the world, in the composition of
which the skill and knowledge of all her pilots and captains were
sought. Curiously enough, as it may appear, there is an open sea
where the Australian continent should be marked on this official
map.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-04"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-08.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Majellan</b></p>
</center>

<p>Are we to infer that no land had been sighted in that
region?</p>

<p><a name="xref-01"></a>Such a conclusion may be correct, but we
must bear in mind that prior to the year 1529, when this map was
made,* the Spaniards had sailed along 250 leagues of the northern
shores of an island which they called the <i>Island of Gold</i>,
afterwards named New Guinea, and yet there are no signs of that
discovery to be found on the Spanish official map. It is evident,
therefore, that this part of the world could not have been
charted up to date. This is not extraordinary, for it was not
uncommon in those days, nor was it deemed strange that many years
should elapse before the results of an expedition could be known
at head-quarters. In order to realise the nature of the delays
and difficulties to be encountered, nay, the disasters and
sufferings to be endured and the determination required for the
distant voyages of the period, we have but to recall the fate of
Magellan's and Loaysa's expeditions.</p>

<blockquote>[* See the <a href="#maps-col-02">Ribero

<p><b>The Victoria</b></p>
</center>

<p>Those navigators were sent out in search of a western passage
to the Spice Islands, and with the object of determining their
situation.</p>

<p>Of the five vessels which composed Magellan's squadron, one
alone, the <i>Victoria</i>, performed the voyage round the
world.</p>

<p>The <i>S. Antonio</i> deserted in the Straits which received
Magellan's name, seventy odd of the crew returning to Spain with
her.</p>

<p>The <i>Santiago</i> was lost on the coast of Patagonia.</p>

<p>The <i>Concepcion</i>, becoming unfit for navigation, was
abandoned and burnt off the island of Bohol, in the St. Lazarus
Group, afterwards called the Philippines.</p>

<p>The <i>Trinidad</i> was lost in a heavy squall in Ternate
Roads, and all hands made prisoners by the Portuguese. Many of
them died, and, years after, only four of the survivors reached
their native shores.</p>

<p><a name="ill-06"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-10.jpg"></p>

<p><b>The <i>Trinidad</i> in a Squall</b></p>
</center>

<p>The <i>Victoria</i>, after an absence of three years all but
twelve days, returned to Spain with thirty-one survivors out of a
total crew of two hundred and eighty. The remaining one hundred
and sixty or seventy had perished. It is true that some of those
shared the fate of Magellan, and were killed in the war
undertaken in the Philippines to help their allies.</p>

<p>The fate of Loaysa's armada was still more disastrous. A short
description of it will be given in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these drawbacks, the period was one of
great maritime activity, and many unauthorised and clandestine
voyages were also performed, in the course of which Australia may
have been discovered, for the western and eastern coasts were
charted before the year 1530, as we shall see by and by.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4>VOYAGES TO THE SPICE ISLANDS AND DISCOVERY OF PAPUA.</h4>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-08"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-12.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Sebastian del Cano</b></p>
</center>

<p>Whilst the Portuguese and Spaniards were fighting for the
possession of the "Spicery," as they sometimes called the
Moluccas, the old dispute about the line of demarcation was
resumed in Spain and Portugal. It was referred to a convocation
of learned geographers and pilots, held at Badajoz, on the shores
of the Guadiana.</p>

<p>Those learned men talked and argued, and their animated
discussions extended over many months; but no decision was
arrived at.</p>

<p>Sebastian del Cano, who had been appointed commander after
Magellan's death at the Philippines, and had returned to Spain
with the remnant of the expedition, had been called upon to
report his views at the meetings, but he, also, had not been able
to prove under what longitude the Spice Islands were situated;
and now another fleet was ordered to be fitted out to make
further investigations.</p>

<p>It was entrusted to Garcia Jofre de Loaysa, with del Cano as
pilot-major, and other survivors of Magellan's armada.</p>

<p>They sailed from Coruna in July, 1525, with an armament of
seven ships. Every precaution was taken to ensure the success of
the voyage, but the expedition proved a most disastrous one
notwithstanding. During a fearful storm del Cano's vessel was
wrecked at the entrance to Magellan's Straits, and the
captain-general was separated from the fleet.</p>

<p>Francisco de Hoces, who commanded one of the ships, is
reported to have been driven by the same storm to 55 deg. of
south latitude, where he sighted the group of islands which
became known at a later date under the name of South Georgia and
South Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>It was April before the rest of the fleet entered Magellan's
Straits, and the passage was tedious and dismal, several of the
sailors dying from the extreme cold. At last, on the 25th of May,
1526, they entered the Pacific Ocean, where they were met by
another storm, which dispersed the fleet right and left.</p>

<p>On this occasion an extraordinary piece of good luck befel one
of the small vessels of the fleet--a pinnace or row boat, of the
kind called <i>pataca</i>, in command of Joam de Resaga, who
steered it along the coast of Peru, unknown at the time, and
reached New Spain, where they gave an account to the famous
conquerer of Mexico, Fernand Cortez, telling him that Loaysa was
on his way to the islands of cloves.*</p>

<blockquote>[* It is strange that this voyage, along the coasts
of an hitherto unexplored country, preceding as it did, not only
the conquest of Peru by Pizarro, but even the arrival of that
<i>conquistadore</i> in the South Pacific Ocean, should have
remained unknown by Prescott and all other historians of the
conquest of the <i>Land of the Incas</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>The remnant of the fleet steered a north-westerly course when
once in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>They were in a sore plight. Both commanders were sick, and,
nearing the Line, on the 30th of July, Loaysa died. Four days
after, Sebastian del Cano, who had escaped and weathered so many
storms and dangers, expired also, leaving the command of the
expedition to Alonzo de Salazar.</p>

<p>Salazar steered for the Ladrones. On the 4th of September he
arrived at that group, where he met Gonzalo de Vigo, one of the
seamen of the <i>Trinidad</i>.</p>

<p>From the Ladrones the expedition sailed for the Philippines,
and on the way Alonzo de Salazar, the third commander, died.</p>

<p>Martin de Iniquez was now appointed to the command, and it was
November before they came to anchor at Zamofo, a port in an
island belonging to the King of Tidor, who had become their ally
during their previous voyage.</p>

<p>Disputes immediately arose between the Spaniards and the
Portuguese commander settled at Ternate. A war ensued, which
lasted for several years, with various degrees of success and
activity, the people of Tidor supporting the Spaniards and those
of Ternate the Portuguese settlers.</p>

<p>Galvano, the Portuguese historian of the Moluccas, and a
resident there for many years, informs us that only one vessel of
Loaysa's fleet reached the Spice Islands. The fourth commander,
Martin de Iniquez, died some time after, poisoned, it is said,
and the command of the remnant of the expedition was entrusted to
Hernando de la Torre. But the only vessel left was found to be so
much damaged in repeated actions with the Portuguese that it had
become unfit for the homeward voyage.</p>

<p>About this time, 1527, Fernand Cortez, the conqueror of
Mexico, sent from New Spain his kinsman, Alvaro de Saavedra, in
search of Loaysa's expedition.</p>

<p>Saavedra set out from the Pacific coast with three armed
vessels and one hundred and ten men.</p>

<p>Two of the vessels were almost immediately separated from the
commander, and their destiny remains a mystery to the present
day.</p>

<p>Saavedra, however, in command of the <i>Santiago</i> pursued
his course alone and reached the Spice Islands, after a voyage of
a little over two months.</p>

<p>His countrymen were delighted to see him, but remembering
their own sad experiences, would hardly credit that he had come
from New Spain in so short a time.</p>

<p>He was immediately attacked by the Portuguese, and various
engagements took place in which he was supported by the survivors
of Loaysa's armada, who had now built a brigantine out of the
planks of their famous fleet of seven vessels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Saavedra, during the intervals of peace, did not
neglect to load up his good ship with spices, and, in the
beginning of June, 1528, he set sail for New Spain. The
prevailing winds that had favored his outward passage were now
against him. He tried to avoid them by taking a southerly course,
and, in doing so, he fell in with the northern coast of New
Guinea, the shores of which, as I have intimated, he followed for
no less than 250 leagues.</p>

<p><a name="ill-09"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-13.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Scene from the Spice Islands.</b></p>
</center>

<p>The Spaniards found traces of gold all along this part of the
country, and Saavedra named the island <i>Isla del Oro</i>, the
Island of Gold; but his description of the natives, whom he found
to be black, with short crisped hair or wool, similar to those of
the coast of Guinea in Africa, gave rise, no doubt, to the
alteration in the name, for at a later date the island became
known as <i>Nova Guinea</i>, or New Guinea.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the shores of New Guinea, Saavedra hoped to be
able to reach New Spain, but the head winds which still prevailed
compelled him to return to the Spice Islands.</p>

<p>The following year, in May, 1529, in another attempt to reach
New Spain, he again coasted along the northern shores of New
Guinea; he then sailed to the north-east, as in his previous
voyage, and discovered some islands which he called <i>Los
Pintados</i>, from the natives being painted or tattooed.</p>

<p>The people were fierce and warlike, and from a canoe boldly
attacked the ships with showers of stones thrown from slings.</p>

<p>To the north-east of Los Pintados several low inhabited
islands or atolls were discovered, and named <i>Los Buenos
Jardines</i>, "The Good Gardens."</p>

<p>Saavedra cast anchor here, and the natives came to the shore,
waving a flag of peace; they were light-complexioned and
tattooed. The females were beautiful, with agreeable features and
long black hair; they wore dresses of fine matting. When the
Spaniards landed, they were met by men and women in procession,
with tambourines and festal songs. These islands abounded in
cocoanuts and other vegetable productions.</p>

<p>From the Good Gardens Islands they set out again towards New
Spain.</p>

<p>On the 9th of October, 1529, Saavedra died; and the next in
command, vainly attempting to make headway in an easterly
direction, returned once more to the Spice Islands.</p>

<p>The remnant of Saavedra's expedition reached Spain, by way of
the Cape of Good Hope and Lisbon, seven years later, in 1536.</p>

<p>According to Galvano, the Portuguese historian, Saavedra's
discoveries in 1529 were more extensive than in 1528. He says the
Spaniards coasted along the country of the <i>Papuas</i> for five
hundred leagues, and found the coast clean and of good
anchorage.</p>

<p>The year that witnessed the return from the Spice Islands of
the survivors of Saavedra's expedition, 1536, witnessed also the
sailing of another fleet sent out from New Spain by Fernand
Cortez to discover in the same waters.</p>

<p><a name="note-04"></a>It consisted of two ships commanded by
Grijalva and Alvarado.</p>

<p>The account of this voyage of discovery is very vague, and the
various writers on the subject do not entirely agree. This is
due, perhaps, to the fact that Alvarado abandoned the enterprise
from the start, and went to the conquest of Quito, in Peru,
leaving the sole command to Grijalva.</p>

<p><a name="ill-10"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-14.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Tidor Volcano, seen from Ternate.</b></p>
</center>

<p>It appears certain, however, that Grijalva visited many
islands on the north coast of New Guinea, and one, in particular,
called <i>Isla de los Crespos</i>, Island of the Frizzly Heads,
at the entrance of Geelvinck Bay, near which a mutiny occurred,
and Grijalva was murdered by his revolted crew.</p>

<p>His ship was wrecked, and the expedition came to an end, a few
of the survivors reaching the Spice Islands in 1539.</p>

<p>Most of the names given during the course of the exploration
are difficult to locate.</p>

<p>Besides the various place-names mentioned by Galvano,
<i>Ostrich Point</i>, the <i>Struis Hoek</i> of later Dutch
charts, is, perhaps, a reminiscence of this untimely voyage.</p>

<p>A casoar, or cassowary, would, of course, be called an
ostrich, and here we have for the first time in history a
picturesque description of that Australasian bird.</p>

<p>Galvano's translator says: "There is heere a bird as bigge as
a crane, and bigger; he flieth not, nor hath any wings wherewith
to flee; he runneth on the ground like a deere. Of their small
feathers they do make haire for their idols."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h4>THE SPICE ISLANDS, IN RIBERO'S MAP.</h4>

<p>I must now say a few words about the official map of the
world, alluded to on <a href="#xref-01">page 16.</a> It is by
Ribero, and will be found on <a href="#maps-col-02">pages 28 and
29.</a> The date of this map is 1529.</p>

<p>The portion reproduced shows the Spice Islands, and a glance
at this part of the world brings vividly to our minds the intense
desire of each contending party to possess a region that yielded
the wealth that is here described.</p>

<p>The map is Spanish, and Spain has allotted to herself the
lion's share, planting her flag in the midst of "Spice and
everything nice" (see Spanish hemisphere), and relegating the
Portuguese flag to the Straits of Sunda (see Portuguese
hemisphere). For thousands of miles around, ships--the seas are
dotted with specimens similar to the two included within our
small area--fleets of them, converge towards, or sail away from
these spice-bearing islands. Every quaint old craft, whether
light caravel or crazy galleon, is underwritten with the legend,
<i>Vengo de Maluco</i>, I come from the Moluccas, or, <i>Vay a
Maluco</i>, I go to the Moluccas, as though that region were the
only one on the face of the globe worthy of consideration. And
all that "Province of Maluco" bears inscriptions denoting the
particular product for which each island is celebrated.</p>

<p>These are:--<br>
Timor, for Sandal-wood; Java, for Benzoin;* Borneo and Celebes,
for Camphor; Amboyna, for Mace and Nutmegs; and last, not least,
Gilolo, for Cloves.</p>

<blockquote>[* Benzoin, a fragrant gum-resin obtained from Styrax
Benzoin, used in pharmacy, and as incense.]</blockquote>

<p>Let us now consider some other features of this map. The
overlapping of territorial boundaries to which I have alluded, is
apparent here in the repetition of the western coast line of
Gilolo.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the Spanish map claims Gilolo and the
other Spice Islands, such as Ternate, Tidor, Batchian, etc.,
since they are set down, in the western half of the world.</p>

<p>This is wrong, for those islands virtually fell within the
Portuguese sphere. I have purposely drawn your attention to these
deceptions and distortions on this Spanish map because on the
first map of Australia, which we shall consider by and by, we
shall see that the Portuguese made use of similar methods which
they, of course, turned to their own advantage.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-13"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-22.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Nutmegs and Cloves, from an Old Chart</b></p>
</center>

<p>For instance, they blocked the sea-way to the south of Java,
and, in other ways, restricted the approach to the Spice Islands
to channels over which they had control. Observe that the smaller
islands of the East Indian Archipelago, from Java to Flores, are
not charted, although they were well-known at the time. There
must have been a reason for this, for these missing islands are
precisely those which we shall find grafted on to the Australian
continent (Jave-la-Grande) in the charts that we are coming
to.</p>

<p>Observe also that the south coast of Java is not marked. The
reason for this is obvious, the south coast was not known. Java,
indeed, was believed to be connected with the Great Southern
Continent, and was called <i>Java Major</i>, to distinguish it
from Sumatra, which was named <i>Java Minor</i>.</p>

<p>In proof of the Portuguese belief concerning the connection
and size of Java, I quote here what Camo&euml;ns, their immortal
poet, says:--</p>

<blockquote><i>"Olha a Sunda* tao larger, que huma banda<br>
Esconde pare o Sul difficultuoso."<br>
    Os Lusiadas.</i><br>
<br>
Java behold, so large that one vast end<br>
It, covers towards the South tempestuous.</blockquote>

<p><b>Diego do Couto's Pig</b></p>
</center>

<p>Towards the year 1570, however, practical Portuguese seamen
had become aware of a more accurate shape for Java, and Diego do
Couto, the Portuguese historian, describes its shape in the
following manner:--</p>

<p>"The figure of the island of Java resembles a pig couched on
its fore legs, with its snout to the Channel of Balabero,* and
its hind legs towards the mouth of the Straits of Sunda, which is
much frequented by our ships. The southern coast, [pig's back] is
not frequented by us, and its bays and ports are not known; but
the northern coast [pig's stomach] is much frequented, and has
many good ports."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4>VILLALOBOS' EXPEDITION AND FURTHER DISCOVERIES IN PAPUA.</h4>

<p>After various treaties, signed at Segovia, Seville and
Zaragoza, the King of Spain renounced at last, his claim to the
Spice Islands, for the sum of 350,000 ducats.</p>

<p>But this agreement did not interfere with other possessions of
the Spanish crown, nor did it prevent the Spaniards from making
fresh conquests within the limits which had been allotted to
them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Portuguese were more active in their
explorations.</p>

<p>Making the Spice Islands the centre of their enterprise, under
the guidance and governorship of Galvano, the "Apostle and
historian of the Moluccas," they sent their caravels in every
direction, equipping also native junks and proas for purposes of
trade and discovery. From Japan in the north, to Timor in the
south, and from Java in the west, to the Carolines and Ladrones
in the east, they penetrated everywhere.</p>

<p>The Spaniards on their side continued to lay claim to the
islands of the archipelago of St. Lazarus, discovered by
Magellan, and, after Villalobos expedition, called the Philippine
Islands, in honour of Phillip II. of Spain.</p>

<p>These islands, situated outside the Spanish sphere, had fallen
under Portuguese sway by treaties with the native kings, and by
conquests made after the death of Magellan.</p>

<p>Of these events the Spanish government knew but little, but
Magellan's initiatory work and conquests were not to be
abandoned, and Don Antonio de Mendoza, the Viceroy of New Spain,
was ordered to equip and send out a colonising expedition without
delay.</p>

<p>It was entrusted to Ruy Lopez de Villalobos, and set sail from
New Spain on the 1st of November, 1542.</p>

<p><b>Timor, from an Old Chart</b></p>
</center>

<p>The Armada was composed of six ships and four or five hundred
soldiers. On their way from the west coast of North America to
the Philippines, they discovered many islands in the North
Pacific Ocean; among others the Hawaiian Group, visited many
years after by Cook, and named by him the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>In 1543 one of the ships belonging to the fleet, the <i>San
Juan</i>, commanded by <i>Bernardo della Torre</i>, with
<i>Gaspar Rico</i> as first pilot, made an attempt to return to
New Spain.</p>

<p>But in their numerous efforts to reach America from the Great
Asiatic Archipelagoes, the Spaniards had not yet found out the
proper season nor latitude to sail in, and through their want of
knowledge concerning the periodicity of the winds in those
regions, they met with many disappointments and mishaps.</p>

<p>In Bernardo della Torres' attempt, many islands were
discovered, and, after sailing seven hundred leagues in their
estimation, the wind failing, they were compelled to return to
the Philippines.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the attempt at colonisation had been a failure and
the fleet had sailed away and reached the Moluccas, to which
islands della Torre repaired.</p>

<p>In the year 1545 the <i>San Juan</i> was despatched again.</p>

<p>She was now commanded by <i>Inigo Ortiz de Retez, Gaspar
Rico</i> being still the pilot. They sailed from Tidor in the
Moluccas, in the beginning of the year, and made extensive
discoveries on the north coast of <i>Os Papuas</i>, or Papua,
which discoveries will be seen on the old Spanish chart in the
next chapter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4>THE FIRST MAP OF NEW GUINEA.</h4>

<p>Had the Portuguese and Spanish known the map of New Guinea as
we know it nowadays they would, no doubt, have described it as a
Guinea fowl, Bird of Paradise or some such creature, as
delineated above, in the same way as they described Java and
other islands in these seas.*</p>

<blockquote>[* Celebes was likened to a spider, Ceram to a
caterpillar, etc., etc.]</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="#maps-col-03">map of Nova Guinea</a>, shows,
however, that their ideas were like all original ideas concerning
shapes of countries--imperfect.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some of the principal features of the Portuguese
and Spanish discoveries in Papuas and New Guinea, up to the year
1545, are clearly discernible.*</p>

<blockquote>[* The original Portuguese and Spanish documents that
were used in the compilation of this map have been lost or have
not yet come to light. Our copy dates from the year
1600.]</blockquote>

<p>It will be noticed that Gilolo is now placed in its correct
position, twenty degrees to the west of where it was placed
before in Ribero's map.</p>

<p>It is now in the Portuguese sphere where it should be.</p>

<p>The Portuguese discoveries in New Guinea occupy what might be
described as the fowl's head and neck. They come under the name
of OS PAPUAS, and the islands where Menezes is said to have
sojourned--<i>hic hibernavit Georg de Menezes</i>--in the year
1526.</p>

<p>The three nameless large islands, between Os Papuas and Nova
Guinea represent, no doubt, the Misory Islands and Jobi of modern
charts.</p>

<p>The Aru Islands are also charted, and the Tenimber or Timor
Laut group is indicated (although it bears no name) as having
been the sojourn of Martin Alfonso de Melo,* a Portuguese
navigator, whose name has not been otherwise recorded, as far as
I know, in the history of maritime discovery in these parts.</p>

six or seven degrees of south latitude, must represent the modern

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h4>JAVE-LA-GRANDE. THE FIRST MAP OF AUSTRALIA.</h4>

<p>The maps that I am going to describe in this chapter are
beautiful specimens of medieval work; they are, however, somewhat
startling, for they reveal, in a most unexpected and sudden
manner, nearly the whole of the coasts of Australia discovered,
yet, without any narrative of voyage to prepare us for the
fact.</p>

<p>They stand alone, therefore, as the most important documents
hitherto come to light bearing on the early discovery and mapping
of Australia.</p>

<p>They belong to a type of manuscript Lusitano-French, or
Lusitano-Spanish planispheres, which is represented by several
specimens, all of which are copies from a prototype which has
either been destroyed or has not yet been found.</p>

<p>As the original model, or prototype, is of a date anterior to
1536, they may be considered collectively notwithstanding the
apparent later date of some of them.*</p>

<blockquote>[* Desliens' bears the date 1566; <a href=
"#maps-col-08">see</a> pages 70-71.]</blockquote>

<p>The Australian portion, or Jave-la-Grande, of the oldest one,
given here first, is taken from a large chart of the world, on a
plane scale, painted on vellum, 8ft. 2in. by 3ft. 10in., highly
ornamented with figures, etc., and with the names in French.</p>

<p>At the upper corner, on the left hand, is a shield of the arms
of France, with the collar of St. Michael; and on the right,
another shield of France and Dauphiny, quarterly. It was probably
executed in the time of Francis I. of France, for his son, the
Dauphin, afterwards Henry II.; hence, this chart has sometimes
been called the "Dauphin Chart."*</p>

<blockquote>[* Another of these planispheres, belonging to the
same French School of Cartography, was presented to Henry II. of
France. About that time a movement was set on foot for the
colonisation of the Great Southern Continent, or Jave-la-Grande.
The promotors failed in their endeavours, and one of them went to
England with the hopes of better success; he also failed in his
efforts, and the great colonising scheme was
abandoned.]</blockquote>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-21"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-31.jpg"></p>

<p><b>The Great Albuquerque</b></p>
</center>

<p><a name="note-02"></a>This chart formerly belonged to Edward
Harley, Earl of Oxford and one of the principal Lords of the
Admiralty, after whose death it was taken away by one of his
servants. It. was subsequently purchased by Sir Joseph Banks,
Bart., and presented by him to the British Museum in 1790.</p>

<p>Copies of this and other maps of the same category, have been
made for the Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide Free Public
Libraries, at considerable expense. This was a wise step on the
part of our governments, for the strongest evidence of early
discovery as yet brought to light is shown in the draughting of
these old charts of Australia.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as I have said, they are all mere copies of
copies, the first of which were more or less altered in outline
and corrupted in nomenclature, from a prototype which has not yet
been found.</p>

<p>But, if the internal evidence of these odd charts clearly
shows the original or originals to have been Portuguese or
Spanish, one point of the question will be settled, and the
Portuguese and Spanish will undoubtedly be entitled to the claim
and honor of having discovered Australia.</p>

<p>As to the matter of date, that is of less importance, and can
be fixed approximately, for the discovery must have taken place
at some period between the arrival of the Portuguese and Spanish
in these seas and the draughting of the earliest known chart,
that is between the years 1511 and 1536, a period of 25
years.*</p>

<blockquote>[* When the Portuguese reached India and the East
Indian Archipelago (1511) they were the masters in those seas,
and became the possessors of many charts used by Javanese, Malay,
Chinese, and Arabian sailors.<br>
<br>
The great Albuquerque refers to a large chart of this
description, which was afterwards lost at sea, but of which
copies had been made by the pilot Rodriguez. It showed all the
coasts and islands from China, the Spice Islands, and Java, to
the Cape of Good Hope and Brazil. It is difficult to believe that
the Javanese, Malays, Chinese, or Arabs had any knowledge of
Brazil in South America, although the Malays and Arabs had
rounded the Cape of Good Hope, coming from the east side, of
course. I am inclined to think that the term Brazil mentioned by
Albuquerque refers to Australia, which had been called
<i>Brasilie Regio</i> from an early date--a date prior to the
discovery of Brazil in the year 1500. See, on this subject, my
paper in the proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of
Australasia under the heading "Is Australia the Baptismal Font of
Brazil?" Vol. VI., No. 1, Sydney, N.S.W.]</blockquote>

<p>But, after all, until the very date of the expedition which
resulted in the first discovery can be ascertained, the question
of nationality of the first discoverers is a much more
interesting one.</p>

<p>Having no other documentary evidence except these old charts,
the first conclusion drawn was that as they are all written in
French, the French were the discoverers in spite of the fact that
no French claim had been made.</p>

<p>The late R. H. Major, the author of "Early Voyages to.
Australia," having thoroughly considered the possibility of a
French claim, came to the conclusion that such a claim was
untenable. Being somewhat shaken, however, in his first belief of
a Portuguese discovery, he was led to adopt a Proven&ccedil;al
theory to explain certain words which on these old Gallicized
charts, were neither Portuguese nor French. The whole subject was
in this state of incertitude and confusion, when, a few years
ago, having occasion to examine minutely these old documents, I
discovered on the oldest of them a phrase in Portuguese, which,
curiously enough, had escaped the notice of all the learned
critics who had made a special study of this early specimen of
cartography.</p>

<p>The phrase I had discovered, "<i>Anda ne barcha</i>," or "No
boats go here," situated as it is in the Gulf of Carpentaria,
had, in my mind, a very great significance, since it not only
proves the Portuguese origin of the chart, but also the
genuineness of the discovery made in that as it showed that the
discoverers were fully aware of the shallowness of the water off
this part of the coast of Australia.</p>

<p>It must be admitted however, that on the original chart the
nautical phrase "<i>Anda ne barcha</i>," may refer to the
difficulty of navigating the strait between Java and Bali, or the
one between Bali and Lomboc.</p>

<p>When I say that this phrase proves the Portuguese origin of
the chart, I do not mean to convey the idea that I accepted it,
there and then, as a proof of Portuguese origin, but I rather
took it as a clue, for the meaning of those words had evidently
not been understood by the copyist, since he had left them in
their original form, instead of translating them into French, and
had mistaken them for the names of two islands.</p>

<p>This clue led me to make a special study of every word on the
chart that had proved so interesting, the result being that I
came to the conclusion that the western coasts of Australia had
been chartered by the Portuguese, whereas the eastern coasts,
which fell within the hemisphere allotted to the Spaniards, had
been discovered and charted by them.</p>

<p>If we take for granted--and I think we may--that these charts
are unquestionably of Portuguese and Spanish origin, the next
point of importance that calls for our attention relates to the
peculiar configuration, or, to be more precise, the strange
distortion which all these specimens have undergone. This
distortion is so great that one might fail to recognise Australia
within the coast line set down, were it not for the general
fitness of the terms used as descriptive of this coast line,
terms which have been handed down to us in the course of the
geographical evolution, and some of which are recorded in the
very maps we use every day.</p>

<p><b>Australia and Jave-la-Grande compared</b></p>
</center>

<p>Moreover, we have the equally important fact that within the
latitudes and longitudes charted, Australia does actually hold
its place in the vast ocean around. See map of Australia and
Jave-la-Grande compared, given here.</p>

<p>We must make great allowance for the measurement of longitudes
as computed in the days when the first circumnavigators were
called upon to determine whether the Moluccas fell within the
Spanish or the Portuguese territory, for, after their return, the
matter was as unsettled as ever.</p>

<p>Albeit, the errors of these charts are far more suggestive of
deliberate distortion than, of inaccurate charting.</p>

<p>In describing Ribero's chart, I made some remark about Spanish
distortions. I come now to the Portuguese ones, which refer to
this subject.</p>

<p>For instance, the Portuguese, who were the first to make
discoveries in these seas, must have been perfectly aware that
the coasts they had charted lay more to the east, and if they
dragged them out of position and placed them under Java as shown
in these maps, it was in order to secure to themselves the lion's
share, for their line of demarcation, as fixed by Pope Alexander,
did not extend much beyond the east coast of Timor.*</p>

<blockquote>[* A contemporaneous Spanish pilot named Juan Gaetan,
of whom we have already heard in connection with the Spanish
voyages on the north coast of New Guinea [see pages <a href=
"#note-04">25, 26, 28</a>], and who aboard Portuguese ships
navigated all the seas to the north of Australia, has put the
following remarks on record with reference to Portuguese
charts.<br>
<br>
 He says: "I saw and knew all their charts. They were all
cunningly falsified, with longitudes and latitudes distorted, and
land-features drawn in at places and stretched out at others to
suit their purposes, etc., etc., and when they found out that I
understood their little pranks they made strenuous efforts to get
me to enlist in their service, and made me advantageous offers,
which, however, I scorned to accept."--In
<i>Ramusio</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>They could not have believed that Timor was situated to the
east of the peninsula, now known as York Peninsula, and clearly
shown in these charts, nor that there was not an open sea to the
south of Java since the first circumnavigators, returning to
Spain from Timor, with the last ship of Magellan's fleet, sailed
through it. (See track of their ship on map of <a href=
"#maps-03">Timor</a>, p. 40.)</p>

<p>But the secret was so well kept, that seventy-eight years
after Magellan's voyage round the world, Java and Australia were
still believed to be one and the same continent by certain
otherwise well-informed navigators, as will be seen by
Linschoten's "Discours of Voyages into ye East and West Indies,"
published in London, in the year 1598, in which the following
description, from Portuguese sources, occurs:</p>

<p>"South, south-east, right over against the last point or
corner of the Isle of Sumatra, on the south, side of the
equinoctial line, lyeth the island called JAUA MAIOR, or Great
Java, where there is a strait or narrow passage, called the
strait of Sunda, of a place so called, lying not far from thence
within the Isle of Java. The island beginneth under 7 degrees on
the south side, and runneth east and by south 150 miles long; but
touching the breadth it is not found, because as yet it is not
discovered, nor by the inhabitants themselves well known."</p>

<p>"Some think it to be firme land* and parcel of the countrie
called TERRA INCOGNITA, which, being so, should reach from that
place to the <i>Cape de Bova Sperace</i> [Cape of Good Hope]; but
as [?] it is not certainly known, and, therefore, it is accounted
an island." <a name="note-01"></a></p>

<blockquote>[* The term implies continental land]</blockquote>

<p>The above passage [shows?] that the author was uncertain as to
whether Australia, which he calls the Great Java, was connected
or not with ANTARCTICA, which he terms TERRA INCOGNITA; and his
hesitation may be readily understood when we consider that some
maps of the period disconnected Java-la-Grande from the TERRE
AUSTRALLE INCOGNEUE; whereas others connected it with Kerguelen
and Tierra del Fuego.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-22"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-33.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Bamboos</b></p>
</center>

<p align="center"><b>THE ILLUMINATIONS.</b></p>

<p>I shall say a few words now about the illuminations. They form
a conspicuous feature in these old maps, and lend a great charm
to such productions of a bygone age; it would be a useless task,
however, to seek in these quaint devices a strict pourtrayal of
the scenes appertaining to the countries they might be supposed
to illustrate; to do so would be to forget their chief purpose,
the decorative. But, allowing for the liberty usually granted to
the artist, nay, often exacted by him, the scenes depicted are
not borrowed from the realms of "Idealism" to the extent that has
been supposed by certain commentators.</p>

<p>The kangaroo is not represented; no, nor the gum-tree either,
perhaps! But that clump of bamboos* on the top of a hill is not a
volcano in full eruption, as a learned critic once ventured to
assert.</p>

<blockquote>[* Bamboos are plentiful on the north-western coasts
of Australia, planted, no doubt, by Malay fishermen in search of
trepang, who from time immemorial frequented those
shores.]</blockquote>

<p>We see, on these charts, fairly correct presentments of that
animal seen for the first time by the Spaniards in the straits to
which Magellan gave his name, and described by the Italian
narrator, Pigafetta, who accompanied the first
circumnavigators.</p>

<p>Pigafetta says:--<br>
"This animal has the head and ears of a mule, the body of a
camel, the legs of a stag, and the tail of a horse, and like this
animal it neighs."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-23"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-34.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Guanaco</b></p>
</center>

<p>The animal thus described by Pigafetta is the Guanaco,
<i>Camelus huanacus</i>, and it is not astonishing to find it
represented on the Australian continent, for we know* that this
continent was supposed to be connected with <i>Tierra del
Fuego</i> and was sometimes called <i>Magellanica</i>, in
consequence. In the chart that I am describing, Australia is
called Jave-la-Grande--La Grande Jave would have been the proper
French construction; but the term Jave-la-Grande is merely the
translation of Java Maior, the Portuguese for Marco Polo's Java
Major.</p>

<blockquote>[* See remark <a href=
"#note-01">above</a>.]</blockquote>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-24"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-35.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Marco Polo</b></p>
</center>

<p>The great Venetian traveller, Marco Polo, described Java from
hearsay as being the largest island in the world, and the
Portuguese finding this to be incorrect, as far as their
knowledge of Java proper was concerned, but finding nevertheless,
this "largest island in the world" to the south-east of Java, in
fact, approximately in the longitudes and latitudes described by
Polo; the Portuguese, I say, did the best thing they could both
for Marco Polo's sake and their own, when they marked it on their
charts where it was said to be, and with the name given to it by
Polo, for he calls it Java Major to distinguish it from Sumatra,
which island he named Java Minor.</p>

<p>The channel or river, marked between Java and Australia, is
evidently a concession due to the fact that a passage was known
to exist. This channel, which is left white in the chart I am
describing, is painted over in the specimen dated 1550 [see <a
href="#maps-col-07">map</a> pp. 68-69], as though it were
blocked, and two men are represented with pick and shovel as in
the act of cutting it open.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, in both maps, the upper silhouette of the
landscape in this part defines the real south shore of Java.</p>

<p>On the continental part, the Australian Alps, the range of
hills on the western and north-western coast, and the great sandy
interior of Australia, are also roughly sketched in. Was it all
guess-work?</p>

<p align="center"><b>PLACE-NAMES.</b></p>

<p>It will not be necessary, I think, to give an elaborate
description of the place-names that occur on this map; those who
wish to know more about them may consult my larger work on "The
Discovery of Australia."</p>

<p>We need not dwell either on those that are inscribed along the
northern shores of Java, well-known to the Portuguese twenty
years at least before these maps were made.</p>

<p>The southern shores of Java are joined to Australia, or, at
least, only separated from it by a fictitious river named Rio
Grande, the Great River, which follows the sleek curve of the
"pig's back" described by D. do Couto, the Portuguese
historian.</p>

<p>In the Portuguese sphere some of the more salient features of
the coast lines bear the following names:-- <i>Terre
ennegade.</i> Ennegade has no possible meaning in French.</p>

<p>It is a corruption of Terra Anegada which means submerged
land, or land over which the high tides flow considerably. It
refers to a long stretch of shore at the entrance to King Sounds,
where the tides cover immense tracts of country, and which has,
in consequence, been called Shoal Bay. <i>Baye Bresille;</i>
Brazil Bay, corresponds with King Sound.</p>

<p>The islands on the western coast, known as Houtman's
Abrolhos,* and those near Sharks' Bay, are all charted with the
reefs that surround them, although they bear no names on this
map.</p>

<blockquote>[* <i>Abrolhos</i> is a Portuguese word applied to
reefs; literally, it means "open your eyes."]</blockquote>

<p>Lower down, there is a strange name, that has led to some
stranger mistakes; it is LAMA, or LAME DE SYLLA, written HAME DE
SILLE on another of these maps. It is a curious jumble that I
have not been able to decipher; it occurs close to the mouth of
the Swan River of modern charts.</p>

<p>Later French and Dutch map-makers took it for the name of an
island in that locality.</p>

<p>Now, in those days, navigators and geographers were constantly
in search of certain more or less fictitious islands, among
which, the "Island of Men" and the "Island of Women," had been
sought for in vain.</p>

<p>Could this be one of the lost islands? The old-fashioned
letter s, resembling an f, made <i>Hame de sille</i> look like
<i>Hame de fille</i>, and a French geographer jumped at the
conclusion that the word was <i>fille</i>, and that he had found
the long lost island.</p>

<p>He called it accordingly <i>I. des Filles</i>,* Island of
Girls. The Dutch translated the name on their charts where a
<i>Meisje Eylandt</i> may be seen; but, instead of the girls that
they expected to see the island peopled with, they found it
overrun by beautiful creatures, it is true, but, alas! of the
small wallaby kind, peculiar to the outlying islands of Western
Australia.</p>

<blockquote>[* See <a href="#maps-13">Vangondy's map</a> of
Australia (1756).]</blockquote>

<p>It goes without saying that they did not know of the term
<i>wallaby</i>, and taking those pretty creatures for overgrown
rats, they called the island Rat Island or Rat's Nest, and
Rottnest is the Dutch form thereof, preserved to this day.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the eastern shores of Australia, for we
need not trouble about the southern shores as they are connected
with the Antarctic continent.</p>

<p>We notice first, <i>Simbana</i>, one of the original names of
the island of Sumbawa.</p>

<p>You will remember that there are several islands left out in
<a href="#maps-col-02">Ribero's map</a> [see pp. 28-29]. Now the
principal one between Java and Timor is Sumbawa, and, strangely
enough, we find that island grafted on here, and thus forming the
northernmost part of York Peninsula, with Timor to the east of it
in its actual position with reference to Sumbawa and smaller
islands around, although out of place with reference to
Australia. We next come to <i>Coste Dangereuse</i>, Dangerous
Coast. It is situated in the locality of the Great Barrier Reef,
not far from the spot where, nearly three hundred years later,
Lieutenant Cook, in the <i>Endeavour</i>, was almost wrecked. The
name speaks for itself; it appears along a coast lined with
reefs, clearly shown on this map. <i>Baye Perdue</i>, Lost Bay, a
broad bay with an island in mid-channel, the modern Broad Sound
and Long Island. This name suggests a double voyage, a bay that
was once discovered and could not be found again.*</p>

<blockquote>[* Many years ago an old cannon, supposed to be of
Spanish origin, was dug out of the sand a little to the south of
Broad Sound, and near Port Curtis. It may be connected with this
Lost Bay.]</blockquote>

<p><i>R. de beaucoup d'isles</i>; the letter R, in Spanish, meant
either river or coast. This appellation refers to the locality of
the Burnett river, where the coast is lined with numerous
islands. The term may, therefore, mean either "coast of many
islands," or "river of many islands." <i>Coste des Herbaiges</i>,
Coast of Pastures; it has been suggested that this name gave rise
to the term Botany Bay, chosen by Sir Joseph Banks,* instead of
Stingeray Bay, given by Cook. The locality, however, corresponds
to a stretch of coast further north than Botany Bay. [* It will
be remembered that this chart once belonged to Sir Joseph Banks.

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h4>PIERRE DESCELIERS' MAP.</h4>

<p>This is a map of the same type as the one I have just
described. It forms part of another large manuscript planisphere,
draughted and illuminated by Pierre Desceliers, a priest of
Argues near H&acirc;vres, and it bears in bold characters an
inscription to that effect with the date 1550.</p>

<p>At first sight the most, remarkable feature of this map is the
display of descriptive matter contained in cartouches spread here
and there between the illuminations. These, however, do not refer
to Australia but are descriptive of such countries as Java,
Sumatra, Pegu, Malacca, Ceylon, the Andaman Islands, etc.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-25"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-36.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Ant Hills</b></p>
</center>

<p>The only illustrations which might be supposed to appertain to
Australia are those <i>not alluded to in the French text</i>, a
fact which suggests that the other, extraneous matter, has been
interpolated.</p>

<p>The illustrations, not alluded to in the French text, may,
therefore, have belonged to the prototypic map, such are the
representations of trees, rough guniah-looking dwellings,
guanacos, and those strange, huts on the western coast, which may
have been inspired by some freak of nature as seen by Dampier on
the same coast some hundred and thirty odd years after these
charts were painted. Dampier says: "There were several things
like haycocks standing in the Savannah, which at a distance we
thought were houses, looking just like the Hottentots' houses at
the Cape of Good Hope; but we found them to be so many
rocks."</p>

<p>Dampier and his companions may have mistaken some anthills for
rocks. P&eacute;ron the French explorer describes some huge
dome-shaped ant-hills seen on this coast, and Captain Pelsart,
wrecked in 1629, also describes some ant-hills seen by him and
his companions when in search of water on this same coast in
latitude 22 degrees south.</p>

<p>In 1818, Allan Cunningham, when on the west coast of
Australia, at the Bay of Rest, took occasion to measure one of
these gigantic ant-hills of that coast. He found it to be eight
feet in height, and twenty-six in girth.</p>

<p>Pelsart's account runs thus: "On the 16th of June, in the
morning, they returned on shore in hopes of getting more water,
but were disappointed; and having no time to observe the country
it gave them no great hopes of better success, even if they had
travelled further within land, which appeared a thirsty, barren
plain, covered with ant-hills, so high that they looked afar off
like the huts of negroes..."</p>

<p>Dampier in his second voyage to this coast in the year 1699,
but more than one-hundred miles further south, describes again
some of these evidently very remarkable features of the western
coast of Australia. He says: "Here are a great many rocks in the
large savannah we were in, which are five or six feet high and
round at the top like a haycock, very remarkable; some red and
some white." But Flinders, when on this coast, actually came
across native huts similar to those depicted on P. Desceliers'
chart of Australia.</p>

<p><a name="ch-08"></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h4>DESLIENS' MAP.</h4>

<p>His is another planisphere, of the same school of
map-makers.</p>

<p>I give it here in its entirety, in order to show how the
Australian portion stands, in all these maps, with reference to
other countries.</p>

<p>It will be observed that, for accuracy, Australia compares
favorably with, for instance, North America, named on this map,
La Nouvelle France.</p>

<p>Besides its beautiful execution there is nothing to call for
special notice unless it be that three Portuguese flags are shown
as flying over Australian shores, a sure sign of annexation. The
map-maker's name, <i>Nicolas Desliens</i>, date 1566, and Dieppe,
the place where the map was made, are marked on a scroll right
across the fictitious portion of Java-la-Grande.</p>

<p>In this short chapter, before leaving the subject of the old
manuscript maps of Australia, and devoting the remaining pages of
my book to actual voyages of discovery, I shall refer once more
to the importance of the Lusitano-Spanish planispheres of the
Dieppese school of cartography* because most of those documents,
becoming the property of French map-makers, were used in various
endeavours which were made to induce European sovereigns to
colonize the Great South Land.</p>

<blockquote>[*Most of these maps were made at Dieppe; all of them
were made in the north of France.]</blockquote>

<p>In the preceding pages I have only described the most
important of these manuscript charts. The following is the list
in chronological order of all the specimens known to exist:--</p>

<pre>
1. The Dauphin Chart         1530-36
2. N. Valiard's (so-called)  1539-49
3. Jean Roze's               1542
4. The Henri II. (of France) 1546
5. P. Desceliers'            1550
6. G. Le Testu's             1555
7. Desliens'                 1566

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h4>MENDANA AND SARMIENTO DISCOVER THE SOLOMONS.</h4>

<p>With the hope of making fresh discoveries and in pursuance of
their object to establish a trade between the Spice Islands and
their newly acquired colonies on the western shores of America,
the Spaniards continued to send out expeditions whenever an
opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Ever widening their sphere of action, they now looked forward
to the southern regions of the Pacific Ocean as the land of
promise, the <i>El Dorado</i> of their dreams; Saavedra's <i>Isla
de Oro</i> and Retez's and Gaspar Rico's discoveries were not to
be forgotten either.</p>

<p>It is in those regions that the legends and traditions of the
times placed the islands from which King Solomon derived the gold
and other treasures that served for the decoration of the temple
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>These legends, founded partly on historical events, and partly
coupled with traditions handed down in the Royal Incarial
families of Peru, seem to have given a powerful stimulus to
Spanish enterprise in the South Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The hopes they gave rise to were, in addition, strengthened by
the desire to discover the Great Southern Continent in a more
effectual way than had hitherto been done: these prospects
originated all the expeditions which, leaving the shores of South
America, followed one after another in the same wake. The
Spaniards were now firmly established in Peru and it came to pass
that a certain Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, a Spanish officer of
unusual erudition in maritime and other matters, having collected
and translated many historical documents, or <i>guipus</i>,*
relating to the Incas, became aware that one of them, their
wisest and greatest monarch, named Tupac Yupanqui, had made an
extensive voyage by sea towards the setting sun, which lasted
over twelve months, bringing back much treasure from the
countries he had visited. During the course of this voyage Tupac
had discovered two large islands, named <i>Nina-Chumpi</i> and
<i>Hahua-Chumpi</i>, or <i>Fire-Island</i> and
<i>Outer-Island</i>.</p>

<blockquote>* The ancient Peruvians had a curious method of
keeping tally of events. They had no alphabet, and instead of
writing they made use of strings of various make, colour, and
length, and, with the addition of knots, more or less
complicated, were able to place on record any important
event.</blockquote>

<p>Sarmiento believed that he had obtained valuable information
from the Incas and their <i>guipus</i> relative to these islands,
which were also believed to be the outposts of a southern
continent, and he thought that he could fix their position
approximately.</p>

<p>In consequence, in the year 1567, he made a proposal for the
re-discovery by the Spaniards of these distant lands. In one of
his memorials to Philip II, he represented that he knew of many
islands in the South Sea which were undiscovered by Europeans
until his time, offering to undertake an expedition for their
re-discovery with the approval of the Governor of Peru, who was
then Lope Garcia de Castro.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-26"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-37.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Mendana's Fleet</b></p>
</center>

<p>Garcia de Castro willingly accepted Sarmiento's offer, and not
only helped him in every way that lay in his power, but also
offered him the sole command of the fleet. But, Sarmiento
insisted that it should be entrusted to Alvaro de Mendana, a
young nephew of Garcia de Castro.</p>

<p>This was probably a mistake on the part of Sarmiento, and was,
no doubt, the cause of the failure of the expedition, and we may
also attribute to his refusal of the sole command, the fact that
his name has hitherto remained ignored not only in connection
with this initiatory voyage, but also in connection with the
further voyages of Mendana, Queiroz and Torres.</p>

<p>Sarmiento, however, stipulated that he should have the conduct
of the discovery and navigation, and that no course should be
altered without his consent.</p>

<p>The two ships of the expedition sailed from Callao, the port
of Lima, in Peru, on the day of the feast of Santa Ysabel, the
19th of November, 1567, and Santa Ysabel became the patroness
saint of the expedition.</p>

<p>Sarmiento intended to steer W.S.W. until he reached the tropic
of Capricorn,* and this direction was kept until the 28th of
November.</p>

<blockquote>[* Sarmiento, and after him Torres, both endeavoured
to keep in the latitude of the tropic of Capricorn. In the charts
of the period a port or bay was marked on the coast of Java-Major
in that latitude. See "Baye Perdue," in the Lusitano-Spanish
charts.]</blockquote>

<p>On that day the chief pilot, Hernando Gallego, altered the
course without Sarmiento's permission, and in defiance of the
instructions, being supported by Mendana in so doing.</p>

<p>So it happened that, notwithstanding Sarmiento's protests and
constant remonstrances, Gallego and Mendana, persisted in this
more northerly course for forty days, evidently with the
intention of making for the better known seas that surround the
Caroline and Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>Sarmiento constantly urged that the islands and continent that
he was in search of were more to the south.</p>

<p>However, no land being sighted after many days, Mendana became
alarmed and requested Sarmiento to resume charge of the
navigation.</p>

<p>He did so, and ordered the course to be shaped W.S.W.,
announcing at the same time that land would be sighted on the
next day, and this proved correct.</p>

<p>An island was discovered which received the name of
<i>Nombre-de-Jesus</i>. It has been identified with Nukufetau, in
the Ellice group.</p>

<p>They had been sixty-two days at sea and were sadly in want of
a change of diet. Seventeen days later, they sighted the small
islands and rocks which they called <i>Baixos de la
Candelaria</i>, Candlemas Reefs; these have been identified with
Lord Howe Islands, lately ceded to England by Germany.</p>

<p>On the 7th of February, they reached at last a large island
called Atoglu by the natives. The Spaniards gave to it the name
of the patroness saint of the voyage, Santa Ysabel.</p>

<p>Natives came off in crescent-shaped canoes to meet them.</p>

<p>They found a bay on the northern coast, and having noticed the
planet Venus at 10 o'clock in the morning, they called this bay
the <i>Baya de la Estrella</i>, the Bay of the Star, a name which
has been restored to it in recent years.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-27"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-38.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Crescent-shaped canoes</b></p>
</center>

<p>They began at once to build a brigantine which had been taken
out in pieces; in fifty-four days it was put together with the
help of fresh timber obtained on the island.</p>

<p>Sarmiento then conducted a reconnoitering expedition inland,
but met with hostility from the natives.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Gallego and Ortega, the camp-master,
examined the coast on board the brigantine and discovered several
other islands.*</p>

<blockquote>[* Very little gold, if any, was found in the Solomon
group.]</blockquote>

<p>An expedition in search of the Great Southern Continent, or
<i>Java Maior</i>, was also projected with the brigantine, but
soon abandoned, as they found the little ship unsuitable for open
sea work.</p>

<p><a name="note-5"></a>All the islands discovered were supposed
to belong to the outlying islands situated to the east of New
Guinea, and the inference, as we know, was not, far from the
truth; it led, however, to a curious mistake, which I shall
explain when describing the earliest map of the Solomon Islands,
towards the end of next chapter.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="maps-05"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-39.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Santa Ysabel Island</b></p>
</center>

<p>In May, the expedition left <i>Santa Ysabel</i>, and after
sighting many more islands of the group, they cast anchor off the
coast of a large island which Gallego named <i>Guadalcanal</i>,
after his own native place near Seville.</p>

<p>On the 19th and 22nd, Sarmiento and Mendana, accompanied by
Ortega, made excursions into the interior, ascending a high
mountain and enjoying a magnificent panorama. Afterwards a boat's
crew was massacred by the natives, and Sarmiento was obliged to
make severe reprisals.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="maps-06"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-40.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Guadalcanal Island</b></p>
</center>

<p>In August, the expedition removed to another island which was
named <i>San Christobal</i>, where they remained for forty days,
refitting and taking in supplies, and here the brigantine, which
had done such good service in exploring the shallow coasts,
was abandoned.</p>

<p>Sarmiento now desired to return by way of the islands
discovered by the Inca Tupac Yupanqui, and submitted a report to
that effect on September the 4th, 1568.</p>

<p>But Mendana insisted upon steering east, and notwithstanding
the remonstrances of many, he shaped a course for New Spain.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of January, 1569, they reached the port of
Santiago de Colima, refitted at Realejo, and returned to Callao
on September 2, after an absence of 19 months.</p>

<p>During the voyage there had been many disagreements, and
Mendana intended to bring charges against Sarmiento when he
arrived at Lima.</p>

<p>As little justice could be expected from the uncle in
adjudicating on his nephew's conduct, Sarmiento considered it to
be the wisest course to leave the ship at Realejo, and wait at
Guatemala until Lope Garcia de Castro should be relieved of his
command.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h4>MENDANA IN SEARCH OF THE SOLOMON ISLANDS.</h4>

<p>Twenty-six years had elapsed since the Sarmiento-Mendana
voyage, and now Mendana was sent out again with instructions to
found a colony at the island of <i>San Christobal</i>, in the
Solomon Group; and from thence to make another attempt to
discover the Great Southern Continent, the Java Maior, that
formed such a conspicuous feature on the maps of the period, and
was beginning to attract the attention of other countries besides
Spain.</p>

<p>Mendana's fleet was composed of three large vessels and a
frigate.</p>

<p>Pedro Fernandez de Queiroz was his captain and chief pilot;
the other officers were Lope de Vega, Felipe Corzo, and Alenzo de
Leyva.</p>

<p>As it was intended to settle a colony, many took their wives
with them, and amongst these were: Da. Isabel de Barreto,
Mendana's wife, and Da. Mariana de Castro, the wife of Lope de
Vega.</p>

<p>They set sail from Callao on the 9th of April, 1595, and,
after discovering the Marquesas, and a few smaller islands, they
sighted land on September the 7th, which Mendana believed, at
first, to be the Solomons, of which he was in quest.</p>

<p>They soon found out their mistake, and named the island
<i>Santa Cruz</i>. To the northward of this island was seen a
most remarkable volcano in full eruption.* The frigate was
ordered to sail round it to search for Lope de Vega's ship, which
had parted company some time previously.</p>

<p>They thought that she might have passed to the north, but the
hopes of seeing her again were very faint.</p>

<p>Mendana continued near the north coast of Santa Cruz,
searching for a port, and was rejoined there by the frigate,
which returned without any tidings of Lope de Vega and his
ship.</p>

<p>At last a port was discovered where the ships anchored in
smooth water, close to the shore.</p>

<p>On the 21st of September, they found a better port, which
Mendana named <i>La Graciosa</i>, for it was very beautiful,
larger and more commodious than the one where they were first
anchored. A river of moderate size and a copious stream of very
clear water gushing from beneath some rocks was found in
proximity to the anchorage. Here an attempt at colonisation was
made, but what with the hostility of the natives, sickness, and a
mutinous spirit, the young colony did not progress favorably. To
make matters worse, Mendana himself fell ill and died, and the
grand scheme which, under favourable circumstances, might have
resulted in the foundation of a Spanish Australian Empire, was,
perforce, abandoned for the while. The remnant of this disastrous
expedition, having repaired to the Philippine Islands, returned
to New Spain in the year 1596.</p>

<p align="center"><b>AN EARLY MAP OF THE SOLOMONS
ISLANDS.</b></p>

<p>The discovery of true Solomon Islands was soon forgotten and
Mendana's vague notions about them led historians and geographers
astray as to their position and size.*</p>

<blockquote>[* In a map of the South Sea, <i>Mar del Zur</i>,
published towards the year 1650, the Solomon Islands are
represented as extending in a sweeping curve, resembling their
natural trend it is true, but the position is from the locality
of New Caledonia and New Zealand, right across the Pacific Ocean
to the south of Cape Horn. In that distance 40 islands are
represented, of an average size equal to the two large islands of
New Zealand, truly a magnificent mistake!]</blockquote>

<p>In the few old maps that exist, it is difficult to determine
precisely in what measure the members of the expedition are
responsible for the charting; some of it is certainly the
guesswork of geographers, based, it must be acknowledged, on the
best information then available, for we must bear in mind that
the accounts of Mendana's expedition were only known from a few
extracts, the actual narratives being lost at the time these
charts were draughted. Now that some of those narratives have
been found, it is easy to identify the present day Solomon
Islands with the group discovered by the Spaniards; most of the
latitudes in the old chart that I give here, agree with those
given by Herrera, the Spanish historian, which shows that if they
have been thrown out of position, as they are on some old charts,
it is through the fault of the map-makers.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="maps-08"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-50.jpg"></p>

<p><b>The Earliest Map of the Solomon Islands</b></p>
</center>

<p>The map given here is by Mazza, an Italian geographer of
distinction; it is the earliest one that I have been able to
procure, the earliest known to exist, the date being between 1583
and 1589.</p>

<p>I have marked on it the probable track of the ships; the first
bay where they anchored, and which was called <i>Baya de la
Estrella</i>, is marked by No. 1. The second anchorage, on the
coast of Guadalcanal, marked No. 2, was named <i>Puerto de la
Cruz</i>; and the locality where the third sojourn was made, and
where the brigantine was abandoned, is marked by the No. 3.</p>

<p>The island thus marked, bears no name on the map; it is the
southernmost large island, however, and corresponds therefore
with <i>San Christobal</i>, where the third and last sojourn was
made, and where, at a later period, a colony was to have been
founded.</p>

<p>The island bearing the name <i>Nombre de Jesus</i>, is
misnamed, evidently as the result of interference on the part of
the cartographer, for, according to the narrative, it lies at
many days' sail from the first land sighted in the Solomon Group,
and has been identified, as I have said before, with Nukufetau in
the Ellice Group.</p>

<p>Other mistakes of the map-maker are, <i>Amacifre</i> instead
of <i>Arecifes</i> reefs; and <i>Maiulata</i> for <i>Malaita</i>.
Malaita, however, is a mistake of the Spaniards, for the natives
call their island Mala and ita means "here"; as one might say,
"here is Mala."</p>

<p>The curious mistake <a href="#note-5">alluded to</a> on page
63 is this:</p>

<p>In most of the old maps that were made prior to the
identification of Sarmiento's and Mendana's discoveries, the
Solomon Islands were placed much too close to New Guinea,
occupying, in fact, the position of New Britain and New Ireland.
This was owing to the belief on the part of the Spaniards, that
they had reached the region where their predecessors, Saavedra,
Retez and Gaspar Rico, had made their discoveries: so that, New
Britain, New Ireland, and all the other islands, of the Bismark
Archipelago were once believed to be the Solomon and Guadalcanal
the extreme east end of New Guinea.</p>

<p><b>Queiroz's Fleet</b></p>
</center>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h4>QUEIROZ'S VOYAGE.</h4>

<p>We come now to the most important expedition that ever set out
in search of Australia. We have reached the year 1605, in the
month of December, of which Queiroz, this time the commander of
another Spanish fleet, set sail from the coast of Peru with the
object of renewing the attempt at settlement in the island of
Santa Cruz, and from thence to search, for the "continent towards
the south," which he believed to be "spacious, populous and
fertile."</p>

<p>The intentions of navigators and the instructions given to
them are seldom thoroughly carried out. We shall see, in this
case, that Queiroz failed to reach Santa Cruz in the same way as
Mendana had failed to reach the Solomans; although they both
sailed almost within sight of the islands they were looking
for.</p>

<p align="center"><b>THE VOYAGE.</b></p>

<p>According to Gonzales de Leza, the pilot of the expedition,
the name of the <i>Capitana</i>, or Queiroz's ship, was the
<i>San Pedro y San Pablo</i>; the <i>Almiranta</i>, named the
<i>San Pedro</i> was commanded by Luis Vaes de Torres; the
brigantine or Zabra, was named the <i>Tres Reyes</i>, and was
commanded by Pedro Bernal Cermeno.</p>

<p>With variable winds, the three ships that composed the fleet
sailed towards the west till the 26th of January, 1606, when, in
the afternoon, they sighted a small island. No anchorage could be
found and it was thought that it could not be inhabited, so they
passed it. Continuing on a westerly course three days later, they
came in sight of another island of larger dimensions; here, also,
finding no convenient landing place, they passed on.</p>

<p>The sky now became obscured, and, as they proceeded, rain set
in, followed by thunder and lightning; then a fearful tempest
threatened their destruction.</p>

<p>Presently, however, the storm abated, and through a rift in
the clouds they perceived land and made for it.</p>

<p>They found it to be an island about thirty leagues in
circumference, apparently an atoll, for it was described as
having "a lagoon inside," and was surrounded by a coral reef.
Here they wanted to get wood and water, but finding no entrance
or bay they had to abandon their attempt.</p>

<p>They continued their course, and the next day, 5th of
February, they came in sight of four other islands of the same
description, and all equally inaccessible.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-31"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-52.jpg"></p>

<p><b>An Atoll Reef</b></p>
</center>

<p>They passed them, keeping on a westerly and north westerly
course, passing several other islands, all unfavourable to their
purpose.</p>

<p>At last being in 18&deg; 40' south, they passed the day with
some rain, and the next day, 10th of February, from the topmast
head a sailor cried out, "Land-a-head."</p>

<p>It is strange how all the early navigators, Magellan,
Sarmiento, Mendana, Queiroz and many others, always managed to
steer clear of the larger islands that spread like a net across
the South Pacific Ocean, and either found an open sea, or hit
upon some insignificant atoll.</p>

<p>From a careful study of the various narratives of this voyage
it is evident that Queiroz had just sailed an the outskirts of
the Tuamotu or Low Archipelago, and was now nearing Tahiti, which
island however, he never set foot on.*</p>

<blockquote>[* Many writers have erroneously identified Queiroz's
"<i>Conversion de San Pablo</i>," Torqamada's "<i>Sagitaria</i>,"
with Tahiti. Sagitaria is Makatea or Aurocra Island of the modern
chart, and Conversion de San Pablo is Anaa, or Chain Island,
about 200 miles east of Tahiti, in the same
latitude.]</blockquote>

<p>At the announcement of "Land-a-head" their joy was great, for
in several places they saw columns of smoke arising, which was a
clear sign of inhabitants, whence they concluded that all their
sufferings were at an end.</p>

<p>They bore down to the land on the northern side; but finding
no harbour, the <i>Capitana</i> endeavoured to beat up against
the wind and pass along the island again, but in vain.</p>

<p>Queiroz then detached the smallest vessel, or brigantine, to
look for a port, while the two other vessels lay alongside of
each other in sight of the land.</p>

<p>The brigantine cast anchor near the coast, "in ten fathoms,
stones and coral."</p>

<p>The commander then gave orders to man the armed boats, and
then made to shore. As they approached the land the Spaniards saw
about a hundred natives inviting them, by signs of friendship, to
land and go to them, but it was not practicable to make good
their landing, the waves broke with such fury upon the rocks,
that all their efforts proved ineffectual.</p>

<p>The enterprise was abandoned with the more regret, as the
fleet began to be in want of fresh water, and they had come to
the sad conclusion that they had nothing to do but to return,
when a young sailor, full of fire and courage, braving the
danger, and generously devoting himself for the honor of the
expedition, and the preservation of his companions, stripped off
his clothes, threw himself into the sea, and swam to the
rocks.</p>

<p>The natives, struck by this act of courage, went into the
water to his assistance, took him in their arms, embraced him
affectionately, and received him with all manners of caresses,
which his gratitude abundantly returned.</p>

<p>His example was soon imitated by several Spaniards, who passed
the breakers, and were received by the islanders with the same
testimonies of sensibility and affection. These brave savages
were all armed: some carried lances of twenty-five or thirty
palms in length; some a sort of sabres, and others stone-headed
clubs; all these weapons were of wood.</p>

<p>These islanders were tall, with dark brown skins and bodies
well proportioned; their habitations were scattered irregularly
on the sea-shore, among palms and other trees which abounded in
the island. On the fruits of these, together with the produce of
their fishing, the inhabitants subsisted.</p>

<p>When night came on the Spaniards swam back to their boats;
some natives followed them, and were treated with those marks of
friendship which their generosity deserved: presents were also
added; but they could not ever be prevailed upon to go on board
the brigantine; instead of that they plunged into the water in
order to return to shore.</p>

<p>During the night the vessels drifted considerably, and at
eleven in the morning had lost eight leagues, but were still
within sight of land; they were now in hopes of being able to get
water there. They sent out the boats to seek for a river; and as
the appearance of the shore gave no promise of anchorage, the
vessels lay-to alongside of each other as before.</p>

<p>The waves broke upon the coast with such violence, that it was
impossible to attempt making the rock without risking the loss of
boats and men; the sailors, therefore, threw themselves into the
water, and by dint of industry and efforts, were enabled to raise
their boats, and fix them on some rocks which were dry at low
tide.</p>

<p>Having thus secured their boats, the Spaniards visited two
small plantations of palms, cocoanut and other useful trees which
were near the place where they had landed; but all their
endeavours to discover fresh water were fruitless.</p>

<p>They came at length to a small opening where the soil was
moist; here they dug wells, but the water proved brackish. Their
trouble was a little recompensed by the ease with which they
procured an ample provision of cocoa and other nuts. With these
they allayed their hunger and their thirst at pleasure; and every
man loaded himself with as many as he could carry for his
comrades who remained on board the ships.</p>

<p>To regain the place where they had landed they walked about
half a league, and in the passage had the water up to their
knees, because the sea, flowing full in, with great impetuosity,
had risen above the rocks surrounding the island and overflowed
the shore.</p>

<p>Fortunately, when they least expected it, they discovered a
passage between the rocks; there they got into the boats and
brought them so near to land, that they could all embark with
ease and return to their vessels.</p>

<p>The ships stood off all night; and the following day, the 12th
of February, they coasted along the island to the N.W. point.,
the latitude of which they determined by an observation of the
sun to be 17&deg; 40' S. This island they called <i>Conversion de
San Pablo</i>. It is Anaa, or Chain Island, about 200 miles east
of Tahiti, in the same latitude.</p>

<p>Departing from Conversion de San Pablo, and continuing his
route in a N. westerly direction, Queiroz discovered the islands
following:--</p>

<p><i>La Fugitiva</i>, two days and a half from Conversion de San
Pablo. Seen to the N.E., but, as the fleet was too much to
leeward, they did not attempt to touch there.</p>

<p><i>La Isla del Peregrino</i>, a day's sail further. They left
this also to windward, and proceeded to the W. On February the
21st, land was seen a-head; the brigantine was detached to
reconnoitre this new island more closely, and anchored on the
coast in a bad harbour, where the ships could not lie with
safety.</p>

<p><i>Isla de San Bernardo</i>, which was the name given to this
island, was found to be very flat, with a lagoon in its centre,
and thirty miles in circumference.</p>

<p>The boats were sent out in hopes of getting water; but they
searched in vain for it, and only met with great quantities of
cocoanuts. The fish, which abounded on the coasts, and the birds,
which were also very numerous, suffered themselves to be caught
by hand.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-32"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-53.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Type of Island Woman</b></p>
</center>

<p>It was supposed to be inhabited; its latitude, by observation,
was about 10&frac12;&deg; S. From this island they proceeded all
night under very little sail, because the wind blew fresh in
their stern, and the great number of birds that passed them
proved that land was near.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of March, land was discovered to the W. It was an
island six leagues round, which offered but a bad anchorage. The
boats landed with difficulty, and one of them was actually
overset in one of their visits and the crew nearly drowned among
the breakers.</p>

<p>This natural obstacle was probably not the most obstinate that
existed there; they found the island inhabited by a warlike
people, that opposed them in every enterprise.</p>

<p>In different skirmishes, several natives were killed, and some
of the Spaniards wounded, so that after some unsuccessful
attempts to get water they were obliged to abandon the place.</p>

<p>They speak particularly with enthusiasm of the beauty and
studied dress of the women, who, according to their accounts,
surpassed the fairest Spanish ladies, both in grace and
beauty.</p>

<p>This island was called <i>Isla de la Gente Hermosa</i>, Island
of the Handsome People. I have been able to obtain a photograph
of one of the descendants of the native women so much admired by
the Spaniards, and you may judge for yourselves whether they were
right in their appreciation.</p>

<p>The design of Queiroz was to reach Santa Cruz without delay,
and with this object in view he directed his course westward, for
in these latitudes they expected to come in sight of the lofty
volcano, Tinacula, which would enable them to identify Santa
Cruz.</p>

<p>After many days' navigation, they discovered, from the
mast-head of the Capitana, a high and black-looking island,
having the appearance of a volcano and lying W.N.W. They could
not reach it for several days; after which they soon perceived
that it was not Tivacula, as they had at first thought, for they
had to pass among several small islands in order to get near it,
and they well remembered that Tinacula stood alone in its awful
and solemn grandeur.</p>

<p>The small islands that surrounded the larger one that they had
taken for a volcano were most of them on the western side, but
far enough from the larger one to leave a channel capable of
receiving ships. Torres, the second in command, was sent to
reconnoitre this island.</p>

<p>(I shall give his description in <a href="#ch-12">Chapter
XII.</a>)</p>

<p>In this harbour the fleet anchored in twenty-five fathoms. At
no great distance, and within the reefs that surrounded these
islands, a smaller island was observed, not more than five or six
feet above the level of the water. It was formed of stones and
coral, and seemed to be the work of man. They counted there
seventy houses, which were covered with palm leaves, and hung
with mats within.</p>

<p>The islanders gave them to understand that it was a retreat
for them, for the sake of security and defence, when the
inhabitants of the neighbouring islands came to attack their
possessions; and that they, in their turn, invaded their
neighbours in strong and large canoes, in which they could with
safety commit themselves to the open sea. They also informed them
that towards the south there were very extensive lands, and one
in particular called Mallicolo.*</p>

<blockquote>[* This indication of lands to the south, named
Mallicolo, may have meant either Vanikoro (where La Perouse was
wrecked after leaving Botany Bay), or Mallicolo (sometimes called
Malekula), to the south of Santo, in the New Hebrides
group.]</blockquote>

<p>The Spaniards had, therefore, sufficient information that
there were many more islands in the neighbourhood of that on
which they had landed, and this knowledge led Queiroz to abandon,
for the while, the idea of making for Santa Cruz. The natives
called their island TAUMACO; it abounded with bananas, cocoanut
trees and palms; it produced also sugar canes, and many kinds of
nutritious roots.</p>

<p>The fleet here obtained, without difficulty, refreshments,
wood, and water, of which it stood in great need. The Spaniards
lived on good terms with the natives, who were eager to procure
them all the assistance that their island afforded; nor was peace
infringed till the very moment of their departure.</p>

<p>Thinking that it would be of service in the remainder of the
voyage, to have some natives on board, who might act as guides or
interpreters, the Spaniards seized four, whom they carried on
board by force. Their chief was soon informed of it, and came to
demand them in the most earnest manner; but, seeing the need in
which they would be of interpreters should they land as they
hoped on the Great Southern Continent, the chief, whose name was
Tomai, was informed that they could not be returned, and war was
instantly declared.</p>

<p><a name="maps-09"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-54.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Queiroz's Track</b></p>
</center>

<p>A fleet of canoes came out to attack the Spanish ships, which
their fire arms quickly dispersed, and would totally have
destroyed, had not these brave islanders, with all their courage,
been sensible of their inferiority. Thus the thunder of European
artillery made good the right of the Spaniards; but force by no
means gives a sanction to base treachery.</p>

<p align="center"><b>THE FLEET LEAVES TAUMACO.</b></p>

<p>Queiroz quitted this island of Taumaco on the 18th of April,
and, <i>giving up his project of settlement at Santa Cruz</i>,
sailed towards the south in search of the land of Mallicolo and
other lands indicated by the chiefs of Taumaco.</p>

<p>On the 21st, in the evening, they discovered land in the S.E.
They manoeuvred cautiously all night. They then sailed along the
northern shores of what proved to be a small island. The captain
of the Almiranta, Luis Vaez de Torres, went in a canoe to examine
it.</p>

<p>He could not find an anchorage for the fleet; but he went near
enough to the land to converse with the natives, who offered him
a present of nuts, and a piece of stuff made of palm leaves woven
together.</p>

<p>He learned from them that their island was caged TUCOPIA*; and
they made him understand by signs that, if he sailed southwards,
he would meet with extensive countries, where the inhabitants
were fairer than those he had yet seen. As this island afforded
no shelter from the wind, they did not remain there. In coasting
along it, they perceived that it produced many fruit trees, of
which they saw several plantations. They say that "It lies in
latitude 12&deg; S."</p>

<blockquote>[* The first island arrived at by the Spaniards
bearing a native name preserved to this day, and that can,
therefore, be positively identified, with reference to this
voyage.]</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>QUEIROZ'S REGION OF ESPIRITU SANTO.</b></p>

<p>As we are coming now to islands which I have positively
identified,* it will be well to follow the itinerary on the maps
given here.</p>

<blockquote>[* See Portuguese, Spanish, and Victorian
Geographical Societies' Journals. 1903-1904.]</blockquote>

<p>The fleet proceeded southwards, with variable winds, till the
25th of April, when, at day-break, a very high land was seen in
the latitude of 14&frac12;&deg; (Bougainville's "Pic de
l'Etoile," the "Star Island" or Merlav, of modern charts.) They
named it San Marcos.</p>

<p>From San Marcos they went on a S.W. course, with men at the
mast-head; and at 10 in the forenoon, at a distance of 12 leagues
to the S.E., a land of many mountains and plains was sighted, the
end of which could not be seen throughout the day. Queiroz gave
it the name of <i>Margaritana</i>. It is the island of the New
Hebrides group which Bougainville named Aurora.</p>

<p>About 20 leagues to the west, an island was seen that looked
so beautiful that they determined to go to it. About a third of
the way they saw another island, 3 leagues off. It was flat, with
a hill that looked like a rock in the distance. Two canoes under
sail came from it, from which they knew that it was
inhabited.</p>

<p>On account of its thick woods and pleasant appearance, the
name of <i>Vergel</i>, or Flower-Garden, was given to it. There
was little wind, and, owing to the necessary caution in
navigating among unknown islands, they hove-to during the
night.</p>

<p>To the north of Vergel island, which is the Merig Island of
modern charts, they saw another large island running N.E. and
S.W., and the peaks of its numerous mountains gave the captain a
strong desire to go and see it; but he gave it up, owing to other
things that occurred. Its latitude they found to be 13&deg;, and
they named it <i>Las Lagrimas da San Pedro</i>. The Tears of St.
Peter.</p>

<p>To the N.W. another island was seen, with a circumference of
60 leagues. It had two high and sloping hills, one at each end.
The rest was flat and of very pleasant appearance, alike from its
shape and numerous trees. Its latitude they found to be less than
14&deg;. They named it <i>Portales de Belen</i>.</p>

<p>Upon nearing the island to the westward of San Marcos, they
saw columns of smoke arising in all directions, and at night many
fires. In the centre it was rather high, and thence its slopes
extended in all directions to the sea, so that its form was a
massive round with only the parts towards the south, broken with
ravines.</p>

<p>There were many palm trees, plantains, verdure, abundant
water, and the land was thickly inhabited. The circumference was
about 50 leagues, though some gave it much more and thought that
it would support about 200,000 inhabitants. Its latitude was
14&deg; 30'. Owing to its great beauty, it was named <i>Virgen
Maria</i>; it is the modern Gaua, in the Banks' group.</p>

<p>Four canoes with unarmed natives came to the Almiranta, and
made signs to offer to take him into port. Seeing that the
Spaniards did not wish it, they made presents of cocoanuts and
other fruits. Having received a good return, they went back to
their island. As the disposition of the natives seemed to be
good, the captain sent a party in the launch and one boat, to
examine the coast and find a port. The party was under the
command of Pedro Lopez de Soto. They found to the S. and S.E.
clean bottom at 20 fathoms or less, where the ships might have
anchored if the weather to be experienced had been known. They
saw a great number of people on the island, who came out to see
and call to them. They followed the boat without passing certain
boundaries, and by this they supposed that there were partitions
of property between the people not on good terms.</p>

<p>Among them there were two distinct colours. While the natives
were looking at each other and talking by signs, a man rushed
down from behind some rocks. He was well made, of a clear mulatto
colour, the hairs of his beard and head brown and crisp, and
rather long. He was robust and vigorous. With a jump he got into
the boat, and, according to the signs he made, he appeared to
ask: "Where do you come from? What do you want? What do you
seek?" Assuming that these were the questions asked, some of the
Spaniards said, "We come from the east, we are Christians, we
seek you, and we want you to be ours."</p>

<p>He showed himself to be so bold, that the Spaniards understood
that he wanted to make them believe that to him they were a small
affair. He presently was undeceived, for he was seized and
brought to the ship, where he came on board so fearlessly that
the Spaniards had to confess that he was no coward.</p>

<p>The captain embraced him, and asked about the land by signs,
of which he appeared to give extensive information. He pointed to
several places on the horizon, counted on his fingers several
times, and ended by pronouncing several words in Spanish, thereby
showing that he had come in contact with earlier Spanish
navigators in those seas. The Spaniards say that it was "very
pleasant to hear him, to see how lively he was, how vigorous and
agreeable in his manner; having a bright look for all, including
those who importuned him with a desire for information."</p>

<p>The night having come on, the launch arrived, and the pilot of
her told Queiroz that they were bringing a native prisoner,
secured by a hatchway chain. Soon after, however, the prisoner
broke his chain; and, taking part of it and the padlock with him
on one foot, he jumped overboard.</p>

<p>Queiroz heard this with great regret, fearing that the man had
been drowned. To make sure of their first prisoner, he ordered
him to be given his supper and to be put in the stocks, but on a
bed where he could sleep. He also ordered that the ships should
go in search of the one that had escaped.</p>

<p>Going in search at 10 at night, the look-out man heard a voice
from the water, and made out the place where the native, being
tired out, was struggling with death.</p>

<p>To the cries of the swimmer carne answer from the prisoner, in
such doleful tunes that it caused grief to all to see the one and
hear the other. The swimmer was got on board, to the joy of
himself and the crew, and to their surprise that he could have
sustained such a weight on his foot for four hours.</p>

<p>The padlock and chain were at once taken off, and he was given
his supper, with wine to drink, and then put in the stocks, that
he might not try it on again. There both remained all night,
talking sadly and in confusion. At dawn, the captain, pretending
that he quarrelled with all for putting them in the stocks, let
them out. He then ordered the barber to shave off their beards
and hair, except one tuft on the side of their heads. He also
ordered their finger-nails and toe-nails to be cut with scissors,
the uses of which they admired. Queiroz caused them to be dressed
in silk of divers colours, gave them hats with plumes, tinsel,
and other ornaments, knives, and a mirror, into which they looked
with caution.</p>

<p>This done, the captain had them put into the boat, and told
Sojo to take them on shore, coasting along to the end of the
island, to see what there was beyond. The natives came, and the
fear being passed, they sang their happy and unhoped-for fate.
Arrived at the beach, they were told to jump out, which they
could hardly believe.</p>

<p>Finally, they jumped overboard, where there were many natives;
among them a woman with a child in her arms, who received the two
with great joy. It appeared that she was the wife of the first
native, and that he was a chief, for all respected and obeyed his
orders. They seemed to be contented and gave each other many
embraces, with gentle murmurings. The chief, pointing with his
finger, seemed to be saying that the Spaniards were a good
people. Many came to where the boat was, and they showed such
confidence, that when one of the Spaniards asked the mother for
her baby, she gave it. Seeing that it was passed from one to
another, to be seen and embraced, the natives were well pleased.
In fine, a good understanding was established.</p>

<p>The swimmer ran away, and presently came back with a pig on
his shoulders, which he offered to his new friends. The chief
gave them another, and a bunch of curious plantains, their shape
being like that of moderate-sized egg-plants without points, the
pulp orange colour, sweet and tender. The other natives emulously
presented cocoanuts, sweet canes, and other fruits, and water in
joints of cane four <i>palmos</i> long, and one thick. Pointing
to the ships, they seemed to say that they should anchor there,
that they might give them all they had in the island. The
Spaniards took their leave and went on to the point, where they
saw the coast of the island trending north, and the other of
Belen at a distance of 4 leagues to the N.W. Satisfied with their
view, they returned to the ship.</p>

<p>All the natives of this island were not equally well disposed
towards the Spaniards, for the boatswain's mate of the Almiranta
was wounded in one cheek by an arrow: certain natives being
envious of the friendship of the others, or being enraged
because, when they called to the Spaniards, they did not care to
stop and speak with them, shot off arrows, and had an answer from
muskets. The wound of the boatswain's mate healed quickly, and
they knew thereby that the arrows were not poisoned. More
mischief would have been done if their friend the swimmer had not
come running, shouting, and making signs for the boat to keep
away--"a great proof of gratitude," says the Spanish
narrator.</p>

<p><b>New Hebrides</b></p>
</center>

<p>Towards the end of April, one Melchor de los Reyes was looking
out at the mast-head, when, at three in the afternoon, he saw at
a distance of 12 leagues to the S.W. and S., more or less, an
extensive land. For this, and because the eye could not turn to a
point that was not all land, the day was the most joyful and the
most celebrated day of the whole voyage.</p>

<p>They went towards the land, and next day found themselves near
a coast running to the west. The name of <i>Cardona</i> * was
given to this land in memory of the Duke of Sesa, who had taken a
deep interest in the voyage, as well at Rome as at the Court of
Spain, and because the captain felt very grateful.</p>

<blockquote>[* The name of the Duke of Sesa was Don Antonio de
Cardona, Y Cordova. On a visit to Rome, as a pilgrim, Queiroz was
well received by Cardona, who was the ambassador from Spain at
that Court. The land which Queiroz, named Cardona was Aoba Island
of the modern chart.]</blockquote>

<p>When they set out for the said land there was seen, far away
to the S.E., a massive and very lofty chain of mountains, covered
with thick masses of white clouds, in the middle and on the
heights, while the bases were clear.</p>

<p>It seemed from aloft that the coasts of these two lands
approached to form one. The captain gave the name of <i>La
Clementina</i> to this range of mountains. It seemed to be in
about 17&deg;. (The lofty range that crowns Pentecost
Island).</p>

<p>Having come nearer to the land, an opening was seen in it,
and, as it appeared to be a port, Queiroz sent an officer in a
boat, with soldiers and rowers, to examine it. In the afternoon
this officer returned, reporting that the opening formed a narrow
island 6 leagues long, running N. and S., rather high, inhabited,
and well wooded; and where it was found to be sheltered to the E.
and N.E., there was bottom at 30 fathoms, and a strong current.
The captain gave it the name of <i>San Raimundo</i>. (It is the
<i>Isla de Santiago</i> of <a href="#maps-col-05">de Prado's
chart.</a>) See p. 34.</p>

<p>Coasting along this island to the W., there came out on the
beach many tawny men, very tall, with bows in their hands,
calling loudly to the Spaniards.</p>

<p>As the new-comers would not approach, they threw a great
bundle of capon's feathers into the sea, intending with that, and
by sending out boys, to induce the Spaniards to come within shot
of their arrows.</p>

<p>Then they shot off volleys from their bows which the Spaniards
returned with muskets. Further on they saw many natives of fine
make and good colour, and away to the S. and S.E. three and four
ranges of very high mountains (Malicolo and Ambrym), which seemed
to join on to the other ranges that had been seen to the S.E.</p>

<p>With such good news that the land was inhabited, they sailed
onwards on a western course; and at a distance of 6 leagues, on
the 1st of May, 1606, they entered a great bay, where they passed
the night.</p>

<p>Next day, the captain sent the admiral* away in a boat to look
for a port.</p>

<blockquote>[* The Spanish term applied to the second in
command.]</blockquote>

<p>Two canoes came out to the ships with men in them, having
their bows ready. They stopped for an interval and rowed for
another. They spoke loudly, and looked at the newcomers and at
the shore, showing themselves to be troubled. Those in the launch
fired off a piece to astonish them, which it did, for they took
to flight, rowing as hard as they could.</p>

<p>Torres, the admiral, returned in the afternoon very well
satisfied, and those who accompanied him were equally pleased,
and could not hold back the joyful news that they had found a
good port; for this is what they had hitherto failed to find,
though they had sought for one with anxious wishes to succeed.
Without a port, the discovery, they knew, would be of little
importance.</p>

<p>Next day, being the 3rd of May, the three vessels anchored in
the port with great joy, giving many thanks to God. Natives were
seen passing along the beach.</p>

<p>The captain, with the boats, went to look at them, with the
desire to take some of them and send them back clothed and kindly
treated, so that in this and other ways friendship might be
established. He did all he could to induce them to get into the
boats. They did the same to get the Spaniards to land, and as the
latter would not, the natives flung certain fruits into the
water, which the men in the boats collected, and with which they
returned to the ships.</p>

<p>The day after, the captain ordered the admiral to go on shore
with a party of soldiers, and try by all possible means to catch
some natives, so as to establish peace and friendship, based on
the good work they intended to do for them.</p>

<p>The party ran the boat high up on the beach, and quickly
formed in a squadron, for the natives were coming, and it was not
known with what object. Being near, they made signs and spoke,
but were not understood. The Spaniards called to them in return;
then the natives drew a line on the ground and seemed to say that
the new-comers were not to pass beyond it. They could not
understand one another, and there seems to have been a want of
management and discipline. Natives were seen in the woods, and to
frighten them some muskets were fired into the air. A soldier who
had lost patience, or who had forgotten his orders, fired low and
killed a native. The others, with loud cries, fled. A Moor, who
was the drummer in the Spanish corps, cut off the head and one
foot of the dead native, and hung the body on the branch of a
tree, without being seen to do it by those on the beach.</p>

<p>It then happened that three native chiefs came to where the
Spaniards were, who, instead of showing them kindness, and taking
them on board, showed them the headless body of their comrade,
pretending that this cruelty was a means of making peace.</p>

<p>The chiefs, showing great sorrow, went back to where their
people were, and shortly afterwards sounded their instruments,
that is, their war drums, with great force and noise, which was
heard on the hills among the trees.</p>

<p>Then from many directions they began shooting arrows and
darts, and throwing stones, while the Spaniards fired on them,
turning on one side or the other.</p>

<p>Queiroz saw all this from the ship where he was, with great
regret to find peace turned into war. It appeared to him best to
land more men in the direction taken by a number of natives, who
were trying to surround the Spaniards. The supporting party got
into such conflict with the enemy that the captain was obliged to
fire two pieces. The balls, tearing the branches of the trees,
passed over the natives; but, after this, and the resistance made
by the soldiers, the enemy retired.</p>

<p>At the same time, the natives who were on the beach moved
forward, brandishing their clubs, and with arrows fitted to their
bows--and darts poised to throw, menacing with loud shouts. Then
a tall old native advanced making a sound on a shell with great
force. He seemed to be the same chief who had spoken to the
soldiers, and they understood him to say that his people would
defend their country against those who came to it killing their
inhabitants. Eight of the musketeers were in ambush, and one of
them, unfortunately, as he afterwards stated, killed this chief,
and presently the rest desisted.</p>

<p><b>The Big Bay of Santo</b></p>
</center>

<p>Three or four raised their dead on their shoulders with great
celerity, and went inland, leaving the neighbouring villages
deserted. The narrator here remarks: "Such was the end of the
peace that the captain hoped for and sought for, the means of
discovering the grandeur of the land, and all was contained in
it."</p>

<p>Shortly after Queiroz went on shore again and instituted an
order of knights of the Holy Ghost, with a badge, or insignia, in
the shape of a cross of a blue colour, to be worn on the
breast.</p>

<p>Towards evening of the same day all three vessels displayed
many lights, and they sent off many rockets and fire-wheels. All
the artillery was fired off; and when the natives heard the noise
and the echoes resounding over hills and valleys, thy raised
great shouts.</p>

<p>The Spaniards sounded drums, rang the bells, had music and
dancing, and had other forms of rejoicing, in which the men
showed great pleasure...</p>

<p>Next morning it was not quite dawn when the camp-master and
ministers, taking with them an armed party in the two boats, went
on shore. They landed near the launch with four small pieces of
artillery to be used in a fort in case of necessity. Within, the
monks arranged a clean and well-ordered altar under a canopy.
This was the first church, and was named by the captain "Our Lady
of Loreto."</p>

<p>Everything having been arranged as well as the tine would
allow, it was reported to the captain, who left the ship with the
rest of the people. All the three companies were drawn up in good
order on the beach...</p>

<p>The Royal Ensign, Lucas de Queiroz (Queiroz's nephew), came
forth with the standard in his hands.</p>

<p>The banners, which were fluttering and brightening the whole
scene, received their tribute from discharges of muskets and
arquebuses. Presently, the captain came out and went down on his
knees, saying: "To God alone be the honour and glory." Then,
putting his hand on the ground, he kissed it, and said: "O Land
sought for so long, intended to be found by many, and so desired
by me!" Then formal possession was taken under six different
headings, the last being: "Possession in the name of His
Majesty,"--which read as follows:--</p>

<p>"Finally, I take possession of this bay, named the Bay of St.
Philip and St. James, and of its port named Santa Cruz, and of
the site on which is to be founded the City of New Jerusalem, in
latitude 15&deg; 10', and of all the lands which I sighted and am
going to sight, and of all this region of the south as far as the
Pole, which, from this time shall be called AUSTRALIA DEL
ESPIRITU SANTO, with all its dependencies and belongings; and
this for ever, and so long as right exists, in the name of the
king, Don Philip, third of that name, king of Spain, and of the
eastern and western Indies, my king and natural lord, whose is
the cost and expense of this fleet, and from whose will and power
came its mission, with the government, spiritual and temporal, of
these lands and people, in whose royal name are displayed these
his three banners, and I hereby hoist the royal standard."...</p>

<p>Then followed masses and various other ceremonies, including
the creation of a municipality and the elections of officers
thereto.</p>

<p>After which Queiroz ordered Torres to take an armed party, and
penetrate further into the interior...They saw more and better
farms and villages than before, and at one village they found the
natives much occupied with their dances. When they saw the
Spaniards approaching, they began a flight to the mountains,
leaving strewn about, as they fled, bows, arrows, and darts. The
people of the party found two roast pigs, and all their other
food, which they eat at their ease. They carried off twelve live
pigs, eight hens and chickens, and they saw a tree which
astonished them, for its trunk could not have been encircled by
fifteen or twenty men; so they returned to the ships. Queiroz, on
the last day of Easter, taking with him such an escort as seemed
necessary, went to an adjacent farm of the natives and sowed a
quantity of maize, cotton, anions, melons, pumpkins, beans,
pulse, and other seeds of Spain; and returned to the ships laden
with many roots and fish caught on the beach. Next day Queiroz
sent the master of the camp, with thirty soldiers, to reconnoitre
a certain height, where they found a large and pleasant valley,
with villages. When the inhabitants saw them coming, many
assembled together in arms. They caught there three boys, the
oldest being about seven years of age, and twenty pigs. With
these they began to retreat, and the natives, with vigour and
bravery, attacked their vanguard, centre and rearguard, shooting
many arrows. The chiefs came to the encounter, and by their
charges forced the Spaniards to lose the ground they were
gaining. Arrived at a certain pass, they found the rocks occupied
by many natives, who were animated by the desire to do them as
much harm as possible. Here was the hardest fight, their arrows
and stones hurled down from the heights causing great damage to
the party.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-33"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-57.jpg"></p>

<p><b>War Drums</b></p>
</center>

<p>When the captain heard the noise of the muskets and the
shouting, he ordered three guns to be fired off, to frighten the
natives and encourage his people, and the better to effect this
at the port, those in the ships and on the beach were sent to
support the retreating party in great haste. The forces having
united, they came to the ships, saving the spoils, and all
well.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the master of the camp was sent to examine the
mouth of the river, which is in the middle of the bay, with the
launch, a boat, and a party of men. He tried the depth at the
mouth, and found that there was no bottom, with the length of an
oar and his own arm. He went further up in the beat, and the view
of the river gave much pleasure to those who were with him, as
well for its size and the clearness of the water, as for its
gentle current and the beauty of the trees on its banks.</p>

<p>The launch passed further up, and they landed on the bank and
went inland. They found a small village of four streets, and an
open space at the most elevated part. All round there were many
farms, surrounded by palings. Two spies were posted, who warned
the natives, and they all fled. The Spaniards found in their
houses several kinds of fish, roasted and wrapped in plantain
leaves, and a quantity of raw mussel in baskets, as well as
fruits and flowers hung on poles. Near, there was a burial place.
They also found a flute and certain small things worked out of
pieces of marble and jasper. As they heard drums and shells
sounding, and a great murmuring noise, understanding that it came
from a large number of people, they retreated, followed by the
natives, who did not dare to attack them. Finally, they got to
the launch in peace, and returned to the ships.</p>

<p>On many other occasions they went to fish and to seek for
things very necessary for the requirements of the ships,
returning well content with the excellence of the land.
Encounters with the natives were not wanting, and it is believed
that some of the natives were killed by the Spaniards, although
the latter denied it, when suspected and accused of the deed.</p>

<p>After the celebration of the Festival of Corpus Christi,
Queiroz announced his intention of visiting the "lands to
windward." At which Torres asked, "in his name and those of the
crew, that another day might be allowed for the people to catch
fish," and the historian says that "it happened that they fished
in a certain place whence they brought to the ship a quantity of
<i>paryos</i>, which are considered poisonous, like those in
Havana and other ports. As many as ate them were attacked by
nausea, vomiting, and feverish symptoms."*</p>

<blockquote>[* The ill-effects of the poisonous fish of
Santo.]</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>SPANISH DESCRIPTION OF THE BIG BAY OF
SANTO.</b></p>

<p>This bay, to which the captain gave the name of St. Philip
and St. James, because it was discovered on their day, is 1700
leagues from Lima, from Acapulco 1300, from Manila in the
Philippines 1100 leagues.</p>

<p>Its entrance is to the N.W., in 15&deg; S., and the port is in
15&deg; 10' S. The bay has a circuit of 20 leagues at the
entrance 4 leagues across. The variation of the compass is 7&deg;
N.E.</p>

<p>The land which forms, the bay runs directly N. on the E. side,
with sloping heights and peopled valleys well covered with trees.
This side ends at the mouth of the bay with a height rising to a
peak, and the coast runs E. and then S.E., but we could not see
how it ends.</p>

<p>The other land to the W. runs nearly N.W., and to the point is
11 leagues in length, consisting of a range of hills of moderate
height, which the sun bathes when it rises and where there are
patches without trees, covered with dried up grass.</p>

<p>Here are ravines and streams, some falling from the heights to
the skirts of the hills, where many palm groves and villages were
seen. From the point on this side the coast turns to the W.</p>

<p>The front of the bay, which is to the S., is 3 leagues long,
and forms a beach. In the middle there is a river which was
judged to be the size of the Guadalquivir at Seville. At its
mouth the depth is 2 and more fathoms; so that boats, and even
frigates could enter. It received the name of the 'Jordan.' On
its right is seen the Southern Cross in the heavens, which makes
the spot noteworthy.</p>

<p>To the eastward, at the corner of this bay, there is another
moderate-sized river called 'Salvador,' into which the boats
entered at their pleasure to get water.</p>

<p>The waters of both rivers are sweet, pleasant, and fresh. The
one is distant from the other a league and a half, consisting of
a beach of black gravel, with small heavy stones, excellent for
ballast for a ship.</p>

<p>Between the said two rivers is the port. The bottom is clean,
consisting of black sand, and here a great number of Ships would
have room up to 40&frac12; <i>brazos</i>.</p>

<p>It is not known whether there are worms.*</p>

<blockquote>[* <i>Teredo Navalis</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>As the beach is not bare nor driven up, and the herbs are
green near the water, it was assumed that it was not beaten by
the seas; and as the trees are straight and their branches
unbroken, it was judged that there were no great storms. The port
was named 'Vera Cruz,' because we anchored there on that day.</p>

<p>In the whole bay we did not see a bank, rock, or reef; but it
is so deep that there is no anchorage except at the above port.
It is better to approach near the river Salvador, and there is
another moderate port which is distant 2 leagues from this on the
N. to S. coast.</p>

<p>All the said beach is bordered by a dense mass of great trees,
with paths leading from them to the shore. It seemed to serve as
a wall, the better to carry on defensive or offensive operations
against other natives coming to make war. All the rest is a level
plain, with hills on either side. Those on the W. side run
southward, becoming more elevated and more massive as their
distances increase. As for the plain, we have not seen where it
ends. The earth is black, rich, and in large particles. It is
cleared of wild trees to make room for fruit trees, crops, and
gardens surrounded by railings. There are many houses scattered
about, and whenever a view could be obtained, many fires and
columns of smoke were discerned, witnesses of a large
population.</p>

<p>The natives generally seen here are corpulent, not quite black
nor mulatto. Their hair is frizzled. They have good eyes. They
cover their parts with certain cloths they weave. They are clean,
fond of festivities and dancing to the sound of flute and drums
made of a hollow piece of wood. They use shells also for musical
instruments, and in their dances make great shouting at the
advances, balances, and retreats. They were not known to use the
herb.*</p>

<blockquote>[* Betel.]</blockquote>

<p>Their arms are heavy wooden clubs, and bows of the same,
arrows of reed with wooden points, hardened in the fire, darts
with pieces of bone enclosed.</p>

<p>Their interments are covered. We saw some enclosed burial
grounds with oratories and carved figures, to which they make
offerings. It is, to all appearance, a courageous and sociable
people, but without care for the ills of their neighbours; for
they saw some fighting with us without coming to help them.</p>

<p>The houses are of wood, covered with palm-leaves, with two
sloping sides to the roof, and with a certain kind of outhouse,
where they keep their food. All their things are kept very
clean.</p>

<p>They also have flower-pots with small trees of an unknown
kind. The leaves are very soft, and of a yellow-reddish
colour.</p>

<p>The bread they use is mainly of roots, whose young shoots
climb on poles, which are put near them for that purpose.* The
rind is grey, the pulp murrey colour, yellow, or reddish; some
much larger than others. There are some a yard and a half in
thickness, also two kinds; one almost round, and the size of two
fists, more or less. Their taste resembles the potatoes of Peru.
The inside of the other root is white, its form and size that of
a cob of maize when stripped. All these kinds have a pulp without
fibres, loose, soft, and pleasant to the taste. These roots are
bread made without trouble, there being nothing to do but to take
them out of the earth, and eat them, roast or boiled. They are
very good cooked in pots. Our people ate a great deal; and, being
of a pleasant taste and satisfying, they left off the ship's
biscuit for them. These roots last so long without getting bad,
that on reaching Acapulco those that were left were quite
good.</p>

<blockquote>[* The Kumara, or sweet potato, and
yams.]</blockquote>

<p>Their meat consists of a great quantity of tame pigs, some
reddish, others black, white, or speckled. We saw tusks 1&frac14;
<i>palmos</i> in length, and a porker was killed weighing 200
lbs. The natives roast them on hearths, wrapped up in plantain
leaves. It is a clean way, which gives the meat a good colour,
and none of the substance is lost.</p>

<p>There are many fowls like those of Europe. They use capons.
There are many wild pigeons, doves, ducks, and birds like
partridges, with very fine plumage. One was found in a lasso,
with which the natives catch them. There are many swallows; we
saw a macaw and flocks of paraquets; and we heard, when on board
at early dawn, a sweet harmony from thousands of different birds,
apparently buntings, blackbirds, nightingales, and others. The
mornings and afternoons were enjoyable from the pleasant odours
emitted from the trees and many kinds of flowers, together with
the sweet basil. A bee was also seen, and harvest flies were
heard buzzing.</p>

<p>The fish are skate, sole, pollack, red mullet, shad, eels,
<i>pargos</i>, sardines, and others; for which natives fish with
a three-pronged dart, with thread of a fibrous plant, with nets
in a bow shape, and at night with a light. Our people fished with
hooks and with nets for the most part. In swampy parts of the
beach shrimps and mussels were seen.</p>

<p>Their fruits are large, and they have many cocoanuts, so that
they were not understood to put much store by them. But from
these palms they make wine, vinegar, honey, and whey to give to
the sick. They eat the small palms raw and cooked. The cocoanuts,
when green, serve as <i>cardos</i> and for cream. Ripe, they are
nourishment as food and drink by land and sea.</p>

<p>When old, they yield oil for lighting, and a curative balsam.
The shells are good for cups and bottles. The fibres furnish tow
for caulking a ship; and to make cables, ropes, and ordinary
string, the best for an arquebus. Of the leaves they make sails
for their canoes, and fine mats with which they cover their
houses, built with trunks of the trees, which are straight and
high. From the wood they get planks, also lances and other
weapons, and many things for ordinary use, all very durable. From
the grease they get the <i>yalagala</i>, used instead of tar.</p>

<p>In fine, it is a tree without necessity for cultivation, and
bearing all the year round.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of plantains: one, the best I have seen,
pleasant to smell, tender and sweet.</p>

<p>There are many <i>Obos</i>, which is a fruit nearly the size
and taste of a peach, on whose leaves may be reared silkworms, as
is done in other parts.</p>

<p>There is a great abundance of a fruit which grows on tall
trees, with large serrated leaves. They are the size of ordinary
melons, their shape nearly round, the skin delicate, the surface
crossed into four parts, the pulp between yellow and white, with
seven or eight pips. When ripe it is very sweet, when green, it
is eaten boiled or roasted. It is much eaten, and is found
wholesome. The natives use it as ordinary food. There are two
kinds of almonds: one with as much kernel as four nuts
lengthways, the other in the shape of a triangle; its kernel is
larger than three large ones of ours, and of an excellent
taste.</p>

<p>There is a kind of nut, hard outside, and the inside in one
piece without a division, almost like a chestnut; the taste
nearly the same as the nuts of Europe.</p>

<p>Oranges grow without being planted. With some the rind is very
thick, with others delicate. The natives do not eat them. Some of
our people said there were lemons.</p>

<p>There are many, and very large, sweet canes; red and green,
very long, with jointed parts. Sugar might be made from them.</p>

<p>Many and large trees, bearing a kind of nut, grew on the
forest-covered slopes near the port. They brought these nuts on
board as green as they were on the branches. Their leaves are not
all green on one side, and on the other they turn to a yellowish
grey. Their length is a <i>geme</i>,* more or less, and in the
widest part three fingers. The nut contains two skins, between
which grows what they call mace, like a small nut. Its colour is
orange. The nut is rather large, and there are those who say that
this is the best kind. The natives make no use of it, and our
people used to eat it green, and put it into the pots, and used
the mace for saffron.</p>

<blockquote>[* The space between the end of the thumb and the end
of the forefinger, both stretched out.]</blockquote>

<p>On the beach a fruit was found like a pine apple. There were
other fruits, like figs, filberts, and <i>albaricoques</i>,*
which were eaten. Others were seen, but it was not known what
fruits they were, nor what others grew in that land. To give a.
complete account of them and other things, it is necessary to be
a year in the country, and to travel over much ground.</p>

<blockquote>[* Apricots.]</blockquote>

<p>As regards vegetables, I* only knew amaranth, purslane, and
calabashes.</p>

<blockquote>[* It is Belmonte, Queiroz's secretary, who is
describing the bay and its products.--G. C.]</blockquote>

<p>The natives make from a black clay some very well-worked pots,
large and small, as well as pans and porringers in the shape of
small boats.*</p>

<blockquote>[* I have seen some of these in the Noumea
Museum.-G.C.]</blockquote>

<p>It was supposed that they made some beverage, because in the
pots and in cavities were found certain sour fruits.</p>

<p>It appeared to us that we saw there quarries of good marble*;
I say good, because several things were seen that were made of it
and of jasper. There were also seen ebony and large
mother-o'-pearl shells; also some moderate-sized looms. In one
house a heap of heavy black stones was seen, which afterwards
proved to be metal from whence silver could be extracted. Two of
our people said they had seen the footprints of a large
animal.</p>

<blockquote>[* Coral cliffs.]</blockquote>

<p>The climate appeared to be very healthy, both from the rigour
and size of the natives, as because none of our men became ill
all the time we were there, nor felt any discomfort, nor tired
from work. They had not to keep from drinking while fasting, not
at unusual times, nor when sweating, nor from being wet with salt
or fresh water, nor from eating whatever grew in the country, nor
from being out in the evening under the moon, nor the sun, which
was not very burning at noon, and at midnight we were glad of a
blanket. The land is shown to be healthy, from the natives living
in houses on terraces, and having so much wood, and because so
many old people were seen. We heard few claps of thunder, and had
little rain. As the river flowed with clear water, it was
understood that the rains were over.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that we had not seen cactus nor sandy
wastes, nor were the trees thorny, while many of the wild trees
yielded good fruit. It is also to be noted that we did not see
snow on the mountains, nor were there any mosquitos or ants in
the land, which are very harmful, both in houses and fields.</p>

<p>There were no poisonous lizards either in the woods or the
cultivated ground, nor alligators in the rivers. Fish and flesh
keep good for salting during two or more days. The land is so
pleasant, so covered with trees; there are so many kinds of
birds, that owing to this and other good signs, the climate may
be considered to be clement and that it preserves its natural
order. Of what happens in the mountains we cannot speak until we
have been there. As no very large canoes were seen, with so large
a population, and such fine trees, but only some small ones, and
the mountain ranges being so very high to W. and E., and to the
S., and the river Jordan being so large, with great trees torn up
and brought down at its mouth, we came to the conclusion that the
land must be extensive, and yielding abundantly; and that
consequently the people were indolent, and have no need to seek
other lands.</p>

<p>I am able to say with good reason, that a land more
delightful, healthy and fertile; a site better supplied with
quarries, timber, clay for tiles, bricks for founding a great
city on the sea, with a port and a good river on a plain; with
level lands near the hills, ridges, and ravines; nor better
adapted to raise plants and all that Europe and the Indies
produce, could not be found. No port could be found more
agreeable, nor better supplied with all necessaries, without any
drawbacks; nor with such advantages for dockyards in which to
build ships; nor forests more abundant in suitable timber good
for buttock timbers, houses, compass timbers, beams, planks,
masts and yards. Nor is there any other land that could sustain
so many strangers so pleasantly, if what has been written is well
considered. Nor does any other land have what this land has close
by, at hand, and in sight of its port; for quite near there are
seven islands,* with coasts extending for 200 leagues, apparently
with the same advantages, and which have so many, and such good
signs, that they may be sought for and found without shoals or
other obstacles; while nearly half-way there are other known
islands,** with inhabitants and ports where anchorages may be
found. I have never seen, anywhere where I have been, nor have
heard of such advantages...</p>

<blockquote>[* Vanua Lava, Gaua, Aurora, Aoba, Pentecost,
Ambryna, and Malekula.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[** Gente hermosa, etc.]</blockquote>

<p>As it was arranged that the ships should leave the port,
understanding that the sickness was not very bad, they made sail
on the 28th of May. In the afternoon the sick were so helpless
that the captain ordered the pilots to keep the ships within the
mouth of the bay until the condition of the people was seen next
day. They were all in such a state that the captain gave orders
for the ships to return to port where, the wind being fair, they
were easily anchored. Then steps were taken to take care of the
sick, and they all got well in a short tune.</p>

<p>On the day after they anchored a number of natives were seen
on the beach, playing on their shells. To find out what it was
about, the captain ordered the master of the camp to go with a
party of men in the two boats to learn what they wanted. When the
Spaniards were near them, they vainly shot off their arrows to
the sound of their instruments. From the boats four musket-shots
were fired in the air, and they returned to the ships.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the captain ordered them to return to the
shore, taking the three boys, that the natives might see them,
and be assured that no harm had been done to them, the fear of
which was supposed to be the cause of all this disturbance. When
they arrived, the boys called to their fathers, who, though they
heard them, did not know their sons by the voices or by sight,
because they were dressed in silk. The boats came nearer, that
they might get a better view; and, when the boys were known, two
natives waded into the water up to their breasts, showing by
this, and by their joy during all the time the sweet discourse
lasted, that they were the fathers of the boys.</p>

<p>The natives were given to understand that the muskets were
fired because they fired the arrows. To this they answered that
it was not them, but others of a different tribe; and that, as
they were friends, they should be given the three boys. They said
they would bring fowls, pigs, and fruit, and present them. They
were told by pointing to the sun, that they were to return at
noon. They went away, and the boats went back to the ships. At
the time arranged the natives sounded two shells, and the boats
went back with the three boys, whose fathers, when they saw and
spoke to them, did not show less joy than at the first interview.
They gave the Spaniards a pig, and asked for the boys. They said
that they would bring many on the next day, which, accordingly
they did, sounding the shells.</p>

<p>The boats again went to the shore, taking a he- and a
she-goat, to leave there to breed; also taking the boys as a
decoy to induce the natives to come, so as to take them to the
ships, and let them return. They found two pigs on the beach;
and, when they were delivered up, the Spaniards gave the goats in
exchange, which the natives looked at cautiously, with much
talking among themselves.</p>

<p>The fathers begged for their sons; and, because their demand
was not granted, they said they would bring more pigs, and that
the Spaniards were to come back for them when they gave the
signal. In the afternoon the same signal was made, and the boats
returned to the shore. But they only saw the goats tied up, and
two natives near them, who said that they would go to seek for
others, as they did not want the goats. Thinking that this looked
bad, a careful observation was made, and many natives were seen
among the trees with bows and arrows. Understanding that this was
a plan for seizing some of the men, or for some other had object,
the muskets were fired off, and the natives hastily fled with
loud shouts.</p>

<p>The Spaniards recovered the goats and returned to the
ships.</p>

<p>Queiroz, seeing that the natives of that bay continued to be
hostile, owing to the bad treatment they had received, resolved
to proceed south to get a nearer view of the great and high chain
of mountains in that direction; desiring by the sight of them to
reanimate all his companions; because, as he said, "in the event
of his death, he felt sure they would continue the work with
ardour until it was finished." He left the bay with the three
vessels on Thursday, the 8th of June, in the afternoon. They met
with contrary winds and decided to return to port. All night they
were beating on different tacks at the mouth of the bay. At dawn
the <i>Almiranta</i> was 3 leagues to windward, and at three in
the afternoon she and the launch were near the port...The force
of the wind was increasing, and the night was near, owing to
which the pilot* ordered that if they could not reach the port,
they were to anchor wherever it was possible. The night came on
very dark. The <i>Almiranta</i> and the launch appeared to have
anchored.</p>

<blockquote>[* Gonzalez de Leza.]</blockquote>

<p>They saw the lanterns lighted, to give the <i>Capitana</i>
leading marks, as she was also going to anchor. Soundings were
taken, and they found 30 fathoms, not being an arquebus shot from
the port. The wind came down in a gust over the land. Sails were
taken in, and the ship was only under a fore course, falling off
a little. The chief pilot, exaggerating very much the importance
of being unable to find bottom, together with the darkness of the
night, the strong wind, the numerous lights he saw without being
able to judge with certainty which were those of the two ships,
said to the captain that he was unable to reach the port.</p>

<p>The captain commended his zeal and vigilance. There was one
who said, and made it clearly to be understood, that more
diligence might easily have been shown to anchor or to remain
without leaving the bay; and that, with only the sprit sail
braced up, she might have run for shelter under the cape to
windward. It was also said that they went to sleep. In the
morning the captain asked the pilot what was the position of the
ship. He replied that she was to leeward of the cape; and the
captain told him to make sail that she might not make leeway. The
pilot answered that the sea was too high and against them, and
that the bows driving into the water would cause her timbers to
open, though he would do his best. The narrator here remarks
"that this was a great misfortune, owing to the captain being
disabled by illness on this and other occasions when the pilots
wasted time, obliging him to believe what they said, to take what
they gave, measured out as they pleased." Finally, during this
and the two following days, attempts were made to enter the bay.
The other vessels did not come out, the wind did not go down;
while, owing to the force of this wind the ship, having little
sail on, and her head E.N.E., lost ground to such an extent that
they found themselves 20 leagues to leeward of the port, all
looking at those high mountains with sorrow at not being able to
get near them.</p>

<p>The island of <i>Virgen Maria</i> was so hidden by mist that
they could never get a sight of it. They saw the other island of
<i>Belen</i>*, and passed near another, 7 leagues long. It
consisted of a very high hill, almost like the first. It received
the name of <i>Pilar de Zaragoza</i>. It is the Ureparapara of
modern charts. Many growing crops, palms, and other trees, and
columns of smoke were seen on it. It was about 30 leagues to the
N.W. of the bay; but there were no soundings and no port.</p>

<blockquote>[* Vanua Lava, in the Banks group.]</blockquote>

<p>They diligently sought its shelter, but were obliged to give
it up owing to the wind and current; and on the next day they
found themselves at sea, out of sight of land.</p>

<p>Queiroz made an attempt to reach Santa Cruz where, in case of
separation, the fleet was to rendezvous in Graciosa Bay. He
failed to reach that island and sailed for Acapulco, which he
sighted on the 3rd of October, 1606, and thence overland he
reached Mexico with a small escort on his way back to Spain,
where he arrived destitute.</p>

<p><b>New Holland</b></p>

<p>On his return to Spain, Queiroz reported to the king the
discovery of the Australian continent. Thus it came to pass, in
after years, that Australia was represented as shown in the
accompanying map, and not until the French navigator
Bougainville, and after him our immortal Cook, re-discovered the
New Hebrides, was the illusion concerning Queiroz's discovery of
Australia thoroughly dispelled.</p>

<p>In a work published in Paris, in 1756, the same year,
therefore, as the map by Vaugondy, given here, De Brosses, the
author of a work on Australian Discovery, describing New Holland,
the name then given to Australia, says:--</p>

<p>"On the eastern coast is the <i>Terre du St. Esprit</i> (the
Land of the Holy Ghost), discovered by Queiroz."</p>

<p align="center"><b>SPANISH MAP OF THE BAY OF ST. PHILIP AND ST.
JAMES IN ESPIRITU SANTO ISLAND (NEW HEBRIDES).</b></p>

<p>The map given here was drafted by Don Diego de Prado, the
cartographer of Queiroz' fleet. When compared with a modern map
(see pp. 97-114), it will be seen how correct it is. The
Spaniards approached their anchoring ground from the north and
the perspective elevations of the hilly country is given as seen
from the decks of their ships, a common practice in those days,
but one, which in this case, necessitated placing the south on
top; for purposes of comparison, it will be necessary, therefore,
to reverse the map, mentally or otherwise.</p>

<p>The original map, which is of a much larger size, bears an
inscription in Spanish (for want of space incomplete in my copy),
referring to the discovery, date of taking possession, latitude,
etc. It draws attention to the anchors marked in the bay and says
that in those places the ships cast anchor. It will be noticed
that no less than nine of these anchorages are marked, and that
most of them are in the port of Vera Cruz. The inscription says
also that the <i>Capitana</i> left them on the 11th of June.</p>

<p>It has often been said that Queiroz's port of Vera Cruz is not
to be found in the big bay of St. Philip and St. James, that the
water is too shallow in the locality where the port was said to
be. This objection, however, may be overcome.</p>

<p>When amongst the islands of the group, a couple of years ago,
a friend of mine, a French geologist of note, informed me that he
had found numerous signs of upheaval in the corner of the bay,
where, precisely, the port of Vera Cruz is marked on D. Diego de
Prado's chart. This, coupled with what Queiroz says about "great
trees torn up and brought down" by the rivers, accounts, no
doubt, for what appears to be incorrect in the Spanish chart if
compared with modern features.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p align="center"><b>TORRES' DISCOVERIES.</b></p>

<p>I shall give here Torres' account from that portion of it that
has come to be intimately connected with Australian
discovery.</p>

<p>As there was a misunderstanding, to say the least of it,
between Queiroz, the Portuguese, and his lieutenant Torres, the
proud Spaniard, the second in command during the voyage we have
just read about, it will be just as well to hear both sides of
the question, and thus be able to form a more correct opinion of
what really happened on the occasion of the last of Spain's great
navigators' memorable voyage towards the Great South Land.</p>

<p>Torres, in a letter to the king of Spain says:</p>

<p>About sixty leagues before reaching Santa Cruz, we found a
small island of 6 leagues, very high, and all around it very good
soundings; and other small islands near it, under shelter of
which the ships anchored.*</p>

<blockquote>[* The island mentioned here was TAUMACO, which has
been identified as one of the large islands of the Duff group,
not far from Santa Cruz.]</blockquote>

<p>I went with the two boats and fifty men to reconnoitre the
people of this island; and at a distance of a musket shot from
the island, we found a town surrounded with a wall, and only one
entrance without a gate.</p>

<p>Being near with the two boats, with an intention of investing
them, as they did not by signs choose peace, at length their
chief came into the water up to his neck, with a staff in his
hand, and without fear came directly to the boats; where he was
very well received, and by signs which we very well understood,
he told me that his people were in great terror of the muskets,*
and, therefore, he entreated us not to land, and said that they
would bring water and wood if we gave them vessels. I told him
that it was necessary to remain five days on shore to refresh.
Seeing he could not do more with me he quieted his people, who
were very uneasy and turbulent, and so it happened that no
hostility was committed on either side.</p>

<blockquote>[* Some of them had, no doubt, a lively remembrance
of the effect of Spanish fire arms, having been at Santa Cruz,
eleven years before, when Mendana's fleet anchored in Graciosa
Bay.]</blockquote>

<p>We went into the fort very safely; and, having halted, I made
them give up their arms, and made them bring from their houses
their effects, which were not of any value, and go with them to
the island to other towns.</p>

<p>They thanked me very much; the chief always continued with me.
They then told me that TAUMACO was the name of their island.</p>

<p>All came to me to make peace, and the chiefs assisted me,
making their people get water and wood, and carry it on board the
ship. In this we spent six days.</p>

<p>The people of this island are of agreeable conversation,
understanding us very well, desirous of learning our language and
to teach us theirs.</p>

<p>They are great cruisers; they have much beard; they are great
archers and hurlers of darts; the vessels in which they sail are
large, and can go a great way. They informed us of more than
forty islands, great and small, all peopled, naming them, and
telling us they were at war with many of them. They also gave us
intelligence of Santa Cruz Island, and of what happened when
Mendana was there.</p>

<p>The people of this island are of ordinary stature. They have
amongst them people white and red, some in color like those of
the Indies, others woolly-headed, blacks and mulattoes. Slavery
is in use amongst them. Their food is yams, fish, cocoanuts, and
they have pigs and fowls. The name of the chief is Tomai.</p>

<p align="center"><b>QUEIROZ AND TORRES LEAVE TAUMACO FOR THE
SOUTH.</b></p>

<p>We departed from Taumaco with four natives of the place, whom
we took, at which they were not much pleased; and as we here got
wood and water, there was no necessity for us to go to Santa Cruz
Island; which is, in this parallel* sixty leagues further on.</p>

<blockquote>[* It is not exactly in the same
parallel.]</blockquote>

<p>So we sailed from hence, steering S.S.E. to 12&deg; 30' S.
latitude, where we found an island like that of Taumaco, and with
the same kind of people, named Tucopia. There is only one small
anchoring place; and passing in the offing, a small canoe with
only two men came to me to make peace, and presented me with some
bark of a tree, which appeared like a very fine handkerchief,
four yards long and three palms wide; on this I parted from
them.</p>

<p>From hence we steered south. We had a hard gale of wind from
the north, which obliged us to lie to for two days: at the end of
that time it was thought, as it was winter, that we could not
exceed the latitude of 14&deg; S., in which we were, though my
opinion was always directly contrary, thinking we should search
for the islands named by the chiefs of Taumaco.</p>

<p>Wherefore, sailing from this place we steered west, and in one
day's sail we discovered a volcano, very high and large [Star, or
Merlav Island], above three leagues in circuit, full of trees,
and of black people with much beard.</p>

<p>To the westward, and in sight of this volcano, was an island
not very high, and pleasant in appearance. There are few
anchoring places, and those very close to the shore; it was very
full of black people.</p>

<p>Here we caught two in some canoes, whom we clothed and gave
presents to, and the next day we put them ashore. In return for
this they shot a flight of arrows at a Spaniard, though in truth
it was not in the same port, but about a musket shot further on.
They are, however, a people that never miss an opportunity of
doing mischief.</p>

<p>In sight of this island and around it are many islands, very
high and large, and to the southward one so large* that we stood
for it, naming the island where our man was wounded, <i>Santa,
Maria</i>.</p>

<blockquote>[* This "one so large." is <i>Espiritu Santo</i>;
Torres, evidently, did not share Queiroz's belief, but took it
for what it was, an island. See for corroboration what he says
further on, 8 paragraphs below.]</blockquote>

<p>Sailing thence to the southward towards the large island we
discovered a very large bay, well peopled, and very fertile in
yams and fruits, pigs and fowls.</p>

<p>They are all black people and naked. They fought with bows,
darts and clubs. They did not choose to have peace with us,
though we frequently spoke to them and made presents; and they
never, with their good will, let us set foot on shore.</p>

<p>This bay is very refreshing, and in it fall many and large
rivers. It is in 15&deg; 45' S., latitude and in circuit it is
twenty-five leagues. We named it the bay of <i>San Felipe</i> and
<i>Santiago</i>, and the land <i>del Espiritu Santo</i>.</p>

<p>There we remained fifty days; we took possession in the Name
of Your Majesty.</p>

<p>From within this bay, and from the most sheltered part of it,
the <i>Capitana</i> departed at one hour past midnight, without
any notice given to us, and without making any signal. This
happened the 11th of June, and although the next morning we went
out to seek for them, and made all proper efforts, it was not
possible for us to find them, for they did not sail on the proper
course, nor with good intention.</p>

<p>So I was obliged to return to the bay, to see if by chance
they had returned thither. And on the same account we remained in
this bay fifteen days, at the end of which we took Your Majesty's
orders,* and held a consultation with the officers of the
<i>Brigantine</i>.</p>

<blockquote>[* The orders included instructions to sail as far as
the 21st parallel; also to <i>rendezvous</i> at <i>Graciosa</i>
bay, which order Torres appears to have disobeyed.]</blockquote>

<p>It was determined that we should fulfil them, although
contrary to the inclination of many, I may say of the greater
part; but my condition was different from that of Captain Pedro
Fernandez de Queiroz.*</p>

<blockquote>[* Torres insinuates here that Queiroz was overruled
by his crew.]</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>TORRES LEAVES SANTO.</b></p>

<p>At length we sailed from this bay, in conformity to the order,
although with intention to sail round this island,* but the
season and strong currents would not allow of this, although I
ran along a great part of it. In what I saw there are very large
mountains. It has many ports, though soma of them are small. All
of it is well watered with rivers.</p>

<blockquote>[* Again, Torres states that Espiritu Santo is an
Island, see 8 paragraphs previous.]</blockquote>

<center>
<p><a name="maps-14"></a><img alt="" src="0501051h-images/fda-59.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Torres' Track</b></p>
</center>

<p>We had at this time nothing but bread and water. It was the
depth of winter, and I had sea, wind, and ill will of my crew
against me. All this did not prevent me from reaching the
latitude mentioned (21&deg; S.), which I passed by one degree,
and would have gone further if the weather had permitted,* for
the ship was good. It was proper to act in this manner, for these
are not voyages performed every day, nor could Your Majesty
otherwise be properly informed.</p>

<blockquote>[* When Torres says, he "would have gone further,"
etc., he evidently thought he was not far from the Australian
Continent; a few days' sail, three at the most, would have
brought him to Cape Capricorne, on the coast of Queensland, a
little to the south of the "Lost Bay" that was marked on some of
the maps of the period.]</blockquote>

<p>Going in the said latitude on a S.W. course, we had no signs
of land that way.</p>

<p>From hence I stood back to the N.W. till 11&deg; 30' S.
latitude; there we fell in with the beginning of New Guinea, the
coast of which runs W. by N. and E. by S.</p>

<p>I could not weather the E. point, so I coasted along to the
westward on the south side.</p>

<p>I may here interrupt Torres' description in order to point out
the various discoveries which he made along the southern shores
of New Guinea during the course of his voyage to Manila in which
he passed through the straits that bear his name.</p>

<p>The recovery of some ancient manuscript charts and other
documents throws considerable light on this perilous and
interesting voyage.*</p>

<blockquote>[* The charts in question were pillaged from the
Spanish archives during the wars of Napoleon I., and taken to
Paris. There, buried away and uncatalogued, they were found, some
years ago, by a friend of mine, who caused them to be returned to
their original owners and acquainted me with their existence,
thus enabling me to get copies of them which were first published
to the English speaking world in my work on "The Discovery of
Australia," in the year 1894.]</blockquote>

<p>There lies at the eastern extremity of New Guinea a group of
beautiful islands supposed to have been first sighted in the year
1873 by the leader of an English expedition, bent on discovery.
Captain John Moresby, of H.M.S. <i>Basilisk</i>, the leader in
question, in the account of his discoveries in New Guinea,
published in 1876, says:</p>

<p>"I trust that the work done by H.M.S. <i>Basilisk</i>, in
waters hitherto untracted, on shores hitherto untrodden, and
among races hitherto unknown by Europeans will be held to call
for some account."</p>

<p>Now, by comparing the Spanish map given here, with Moresby's
it will be seen how Moresby's work, on this point of the coast,
had been forestalled by Torres.</p>

<p>The features and place-names in the Spanish chart will reveal
some of the most important of Torres' discoveries at the
south-east end of New Guinea, where the Spanish navigator made
his first stay in order to refresh the crews of the
<i>Almiranta</i> and <i>Brigantine</i>.</p>

<p>From a description on this chart we learn that during five
days and nights the Spaniards stood in sight of those tantalizing
verdant shores, unable to effect a landing, threading their way
through perilous reefs and over dangerous shoals.</p>

<p>Then, at last, they rounded, no doubt, the cape which Torres
called <i>Cabo de tres hermanas</i>, or Cape of the Three
Sisters, passed the next point marked (A) on the map, near the
east point of the compass, and came to anchor in a little bay
which was called <i>Puerto de San Francisco</i>.</p>

<p>It is situated near the south-east entrance to Rocky Pass,
between Basilisk and Hayter Islands, and formed, in all
probability, during their sojourn in these parts, the centre of
their various excursions to the islands and bays around.</p>

<p>Its name, San Francisco, gives us the date of Torres' landing
(14th of July, 1606), for it was customary in those days to name
discoveries after the saints of the calendar; but the feast of
St. Bonaventure occurs also on July the 14th, so that name was
likewise made use of, and given to the whole territory
discovered.</p>

<p>Contrary to Torres', Moresby's approach, in the year 1873, was
from the N.E. where the mainland of New Guinea was supposed to
extend beyond Hayter, Basilisk and Moresby's Islands.</p>

<p>The English captain had already cut off Moresby's Island, left
his good ship <i>Basilisk</i> at anchor in the strait thus
discovered (Fortescue Strait), and--the numerous reefs rendering
navigation impossible for his ship--taken to his boats, the
galley and cutter.</p>

<p>Moresby and party then rounded the northern shores of what
they thought might prove to be the "beginning of New Guinea,"
when, suddenly, a bay seemed to open towards the south.</p>

<p>Moresby entered it, and, by the merest chance, hit upon the
identical narrow passage which Torres, 267 years previously, had
discovered from the south side and named <i>Boca de la
Batalla</i>, Mouth of the Battle; having, no doubt, had an
encounter there with the natives.</p>

<p>Moresby called that mouth Rocky Pass, and grew enthusiastic at
the discovery, and at having "separated another island from New
Guinea."</p>

<p>He was anxious to find if Rocky Pass would afford a passage
for his ship, and spent the remainder of the day in examining it;
but a rocky ledge, which ran across, barred it to the ship, and
made it dangerous even for boats at the strength of the tide.</p>

<p>Moresby's experiences help to show the difficulties that the
Spaniards had to deal with, and also that Torres must have been
compelled to leave his two ships at anchor somewhere to the south
of the <i>Baya de San Milian</i>; San Francisco Bay, for
instance; and use the only rowing boat he had for his
excursions.</p>

<p>In this he explored the bay formed by the horse-shoe-shape of
Basilisk Island, named it the <i>Baya de San Milian</i> (modern
Jenkins Bay), and penetrated to the largest bay to be found among
all the islands he had discovered in this region--that is Milne
Bay. He says: "We went a long way out from <i>Cabo Fresco</i>
[modern Challis Head of Moresby's chart], which is as far as we
could go towards the east in a boat."</p>

<p>Other nautical remarks which I translate from the old Spanish
text of the chart are: "Towards the E. [N.E.] we did not see the
end of the land, but we could judge from the various small
islands that the channels were wide; towards the west there are
no channels, only land and continuous lofty ridges, '<i>Tierra
alta y cerrada</i>' (evidently the Mount Owen Stanly ranges in
the distance). We steered in that direction, but had to give up
further progress after a while owing to the inadequacy of our
boat."</p>

<p>These and other notes on the Spanish chart correspond exactly
with what Moresby says of Milne Bay; and the dimensions given to
that bay by de Prado, the cartographer of the expedition (40
leagues in circumference), may be considered as a fairly correct
estimate.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July, Torres and his party having concluded
their running survey of Basilisk Island, landed and took
possession in the name of the king of Spain, naming as I have
said, the whole territory the TIERRA DE SAN BUENAVENTURA.</p>

<p>A careful examination which I have made of a much distorted
copy of a general map of New Guinea, made by Torres'
cartographer, shows that Torres' <i>Tierra de san
Buenaventura</i> (Basilisk Island), is one of several islands off
the south-eastern extremity of New Guinea; and, by coupling this
fact with what Torres says of his inability to navigate the bay
(Milne Bay), and proceed east of Cabo Fresco (Challis Head),
although he noticed wide channels in that direction, we may infer
that the reefs and coral patches (not contrary winds as generally
believed) compelled him to seek the southwest passage to
Manila.*</p>

<blockquote>[* Torres evidently did not discover the passage,
discovered by Moresby and named by him China Strait, otherwise he
might have been able to take the northern course.]</blockquote>

<p>This becomes still more evident when we consider that Moresby
also was unable to take his ship through to the northern
shores.</p>

<p>From these regions Torres sailed to Orangerie Bay of modern
charts, which he discovered on the 10th of August, 1606, and
named in consequence, THE GREAT BAY OF ST. LAWRENCE.*</p>

<blockquote>[* On the same day, one hundred years before, the
Portuguese had discovered Madagascar, which they called the
Island of St. Lawrence.]</blockquote>

<p>Here, another lengthy stay was made and an extensive survey,
comprising the laying out of a township, as may be seen by the
accompanying map.</p>

<p>Then the little squadron went right up into the Gulf of Papua
and down again as far as 11&deg; S. latitude.</p>

<p>Not, therefore, through Torres Strait, so called, did Torres
pass, but through Endeavour Strait, which has been named after
Captain Cook's ship, the <i>Endeavour</i>.</p>

<p>Sailing along the shores of the islands to the north of
Australia, between Cape York and Prince of Wales Island, Torres
regained the coast of New Guinea and put in at the bay of St.
Peter of Arlanza (modern Triton Bay), in order to refresh his
crews.</p>

<p>There he took possession on the 18th of October, 1606, and,
after a lengthy sojourn, sailed away to the Philippine
Islands.</p>

<p>He had discovered Australia without being aware of the fact,
and had completed the Spanish circumnavigation of New Guinea.</p>
