  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">MOLLY DUNN sat waiting on the rickety old porch of Enoch
  Summers&rsquo; store in the village of West Fork. For once she was oblivious
  to the approach of the lean-faced, long-legged young backwoodsmen who lounged
  there with their elders. Molly was sixteen and on the eve of a great
  adventure. She had been invited to ride to Flagerstown with the Sees. She had
  been there once some years before and the memory had haunted her. In her
  pocket she had money to buy new stockings and shoes, which compensated
  somewhat for the fact that she carefully kept her feet and ankles hidden
  under the bench. She wore her good dress and bonnet, and though not satisfied
  with them she was not ashamed.</p>

  <p>Andy Stoneham, a tall youth with sallow face and fuzzy beard, edged over
  closer and closer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;re orful stuck up this mawnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
  drawled.</p>

  <p>Molly looked at the bullet holes in the wall of the old store. She had
  seen them before, and long ago when she was ten she had stuck her finger in
  them and wondered about the battle that had been fought there once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; up to Flag, huh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d dress up like this for West Fork?&rdquo;
  inquired Molly, loftily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you used to, didn&rsquo;t you? You shore look purty. But I
  can&rsquo;t see you&rsquo;ve any call to get uppish. I&rsquo;ve seen you in
  thet rig before, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember, Andy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got a darn short memory,&rdquo; replied Andy,
  bluntly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I take you to the last dance in thet
  dress?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I shore did. An&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t I hug you in
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; queried Molly, flippantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet I did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten. But I&rsquo;ve heard it said you&rsquo;re so
  big an&rsquo; awkward you have to hold on to a girl when you dance. Else
  you&rsquo;d fall down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, how aboot kissin&rsquo; you, too? On the way to the dance
  an&rsquo; drivin&rsquo; home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, did you!&rdquo; retorted Molly, her face hot. Andy&rsquo;s
  voice carried rather far. &ldquo;An&rsquo; what did I do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I figger thet you kissed me back an&rsquo; then slapped my
  face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Andy Stoneham, you&rsquo;re a liar about that first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw! ... Say, Molly, there&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be a dance
  next week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where at?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hall&rsquo;s Mill. Come on an&rsquo; go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Andy, I don&rsquo;t like that place,&rdquo; returned Molly,
  regretfully. &ldquo;Besides, I wouldn&rsquo;t go with you, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you shore air gettin&rsquo; stuck up. An&rsquo; why
  not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because of what you said&mdash;about huggin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
  kissin&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of thet? I did an&rsquo; you liked it. Aw, you&rsquo;re funny.
  Haven&rsquo;t all the boys done the same?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They have not,&rdquo; declared Molly. &ldquo;Who ever said such a
  thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heerd Sam Wise say it. An&rsquo; Bill Smith laughed, though he
  didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the kind of fellows you are!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Molly. &ldquo;Talk about a girl behind her back? ... To kiss an&rsquo;
  tell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, at thet we&rsquo;re not so gabby as your cowboy admirers from
  Pleasant Valley. Take thet red-headed cowpuncher. Accordin&rsquo; to his talk
  he&rsquo;s a tall fellar with gurls. He shore had you crazy aboot
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He did not,&rdquo; said Molly, hotly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you acted orful queer then. Danced all the time with him.
  An&rsquo; three times walked out under the pines. Aw, I watched you.
  An&rsquo; come Saturday night he was drinkin&rsquo; heah, an&rsquo;
  accordin&rsquo; to his talk he could have had a lot more than huggin&rsquo;
  an&rsquo; kissin&rsquo; from you, if he only got you alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Andy Stoneham!&mdash;You let him talk that way aboot me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, why should I care? You&rsquo;ve shore been mean to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should you, indeed?&rdquo; replied Molly, coldly, and turned
  away.</p>

  <p>At that juncture a horseman rode up and his advent not only interrupted
  Molly&rsquo;s argument with her loquacious admirer, but had a decided
  quieting effect upon the other occupants of the porch. He was a lean
  range-rider, neither young nor old, and he fitted the hard country. His horse
  showed the dust and strain of long travel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Seth,&rdquo; said old Enoch Summers, rubbing his bristled
  chin and stepping out. &ldquo;&rsquo;Pears like you been humpin&rsquo; it
  along. Whar you come from?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me an&rsquo; Arch Dunn just rode over from the Diamond,&rdquo;
  replied the other.</p>

  <p>Molly&rsquo;s attention quickened to interest at the mention of her
  brother. Seth Haverly was his boon companion and they had been up to
  something.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thar&rsquo;s news stickin&rsquo; out all over you,&rdquo;
  drawled Summers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Git down an&rsquo; come in. Mebbe a drink wouldn&rsquo;t go
  bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; home an&rsquo; get a snack of
  grub.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One by one the men on the porch joined Summers. The fact that Seth Haverly
  did not want a drink, as much as his arrival, interested them.</p>

  <p>Haverly had a still brown face and intent light eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enoch, you know thet drift fence we been hearin&rsquo; aboot for
  the last year?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I heerd the talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n talk now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep. Me an&rsquo; Arch rode along it, for ten miles, I figger.
  Straight as a bee-line. New three-wire fence, an&rsquo; barbed at
  thet!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you say? Barbed!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Silence greeted Seth&rsquo;s nonchalant affirmative.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch had a hunch aboot this fence goin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; went on
  Haverly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; in Flag we found it was a fact.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, who&rsquo;s buildin&rsquo; it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traft.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. He could afford it. Wal, what&rsquo;s his idee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t very flatterin&rsquo; to West Fork,&rdquo; drawled
  Seth, with a grin. &ldquo;We heerd some things thet&rsquo;d be hard for you
  old cattle-nesters to swaller, if they&rsquo;re true. But me an&rsquo; Arch
  only had the word of some idle cowpunchers. We couldn&rsquo;t get any
  satisfaction from Traft&rsquo;s outfit. New foreman. Nephew from Missourie,
  we heerd. Tenderfoot, but I agree with Arch, who said he was no fool. Anyway,
  we asked him polite like: &lsquo;Say, mister, what&rsquo;s the idee of this
  drift fence?&rsquo;&mdash;An he looked me an&rsquo; Arch over an&rsquo; said,
  &lsquo;What do you suppose the idee is?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Short an&rsquo; sweet!&rdquo; ejaculated a man standing beside
  Summers. &ldquo;Wal, you two-bit free-range cattlemen can put thet in your
  pipes an&rsquo; smoke it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon he strode off the porch and down the road, erect and forceful,
  his departure expressive of much.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me an&rsquo; Arch was sure curious aboot this fence,&rdquo;
  continued Seth. &ldquo;We rode out of Flag an&rsquo; started in where the
  fence begins. It strikes south into the timber at Traft&rsquo;s line,
  an&rsquo; closes up every draw clear to the Diamond. At Limestone we hit into
  Traft&rsquo;s outfit. They&rsquo;ve got the job half done an&rsquo; by the
  time the snow flies thet drift fence will run clear from Flag to Black
  Butte.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! A hundred miles of drift fence!&rdquo; exclaimed some one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh,&rdquo; nodded Summers, sagely. &ldquo;An&rsquo; all the
  cattle will drift along to Black Butte an&rsquo; then drift back
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Haverly swung his spurred boot back to his stirrup and without another
  word rode away.</p>

  <p>Molly watched the departing rider as thoughtfully as any of the others on
  Summers&rsquo; porch. This drift fence must be going to have a profound
  significance for the few inhabitants along the West Fork of the Cibeque.</p>

  <p>Then down the road from the other direction appeared the See buckboard,
  sight of which brought Molly bouncing to her feet. To her relief young John
  See was not in the vehicle with his parents. John had more prospects than any
  of the young men Molly knew, but he also had more than his share of their
  demerits. The buckboard rolled to a stop.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hop up, Molly,&rdquo; called See, gayly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re late
  an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t no fault of yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good mawnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; returned Molly, brightly, as she climbed
  to the seat beside Mrs. See.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mornin&rsquo; lass,&rdquo; replied the rancher&rsquo;s wife.
  &ldquo;You look like you could fly as well as hop.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m on pins,&rdquo; cried Molly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never
  be able to thank you enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Caleb,&rdquo; spoke up Summers. &ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;ve
  got time to come inside a minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mawnin&rsquo;, Enoch,&rdquo; replied See, which greeting included
  the others present. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, come in anyhow,&rdquo; returned Summers, bluntly, and went
  into the store.</p>

  <p>See grumbled a little, as he wound the reins around the brake-handle, and
  laboriously got down. He was a heavy man, no longer young. All the loungers
  on the porch followed him into the store, but Andy Stoneham remained in the
  door, watching Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That lout&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; sheep eyes at you, Molly,&rdquo;
  said Mrs. See.</p>

  <p>Molly did not look. &ldquo;He just said some nasty things to me,&rdquo;
  she confided. &ldquo;Then the fool asked me to go to a dance at Hall&rsquo;s
  Mill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, you&rsquo;re growin&rsquo; up an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s time you
  got some sensible notions,&rdquo; said Mrs. See, seriously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to Flag,&rdquo; trilled Molly, as if that
  momentous adventure was all that mattered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lass, you&rsquo;re a bad combination. You&rsquo;re too pretty
  an&rsquo; too crazy. I reckon it&rsquo;s time to get you a
  husband.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly laughed and blushed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what ma says. But
  it&rsquo;s funny. I have to work hard enough now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Caleb See came stamping out of the store, wiping his beard, sober of face
  where he had been merry. Without a word he stepped into the buckboard, making
  it lurch, and drove away. Molly was reminded of the news about the drift
  fence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. See, while I was waitin&rsquo; for you Seth Haverly rode
  up,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d just come in from the Diamond with
  my brother Arch. They&rsquo;d been to Flag. An&rsquo; he was tellin&rsquo;
  old Enoch Summers about a fence that was bein&rsquo; built, down across the
  country. A drift fence, he called it. What&rsquo;s a drift fence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While Mrs. See pondered over the query Caleb answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, lass, it&rsquo;s no wonder you ask, seein&rsquo; we
  don&rsquo;t have no fences in this country. On a free range cattle travel all
  over, accordin&rsquo; to water an&rsquo; grass. Now a drift fence is
  somethin&rsquo; that changes a free range. It ain&rsquo;t free no more.
  It&rsquo;s a rough country this side of the Diamond. All the draws head up on
  top an&rsquo; run down into the West Fork, an&rsquo; into the Cibeque. Water
  runs down these draws, an&rsquo; feed is good. Wal, a drift fence built on
  top an&rsquo; runnin&rsquo; from Flag down country will keep the cattle on
  top. They&rsquo;ll drift along an&rsquo; water down on the other side. Then
  they&rsquo;ll drift back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why were they so serious about it?&rdquo; asked Molly, curiously.
  &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t a drift fence a good thing?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it is, for Traft an&rsquo; Blodgett, an&rsquo; the big
  cattlemen up Flag way. But for us folks, who live off the Diamond, it
  ain&rsquo;t so good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most of us couldn&rsquo;t live much worse,&rdquo; replied Molly,
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet you could, lass. Haven&rsquo;t you always had milk
  an&rsquo; beefsteak, an&rsquo; shoes to wear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most always, but not always. Just now I&rsquo;m walkin&rsquo; in my
  bare toes,&rdquo; said Molly, with giggle. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t saved up
  money enough to buy stockings an&rsquo; shoes I&rsquo;d never
  come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, you goin&rsquo; to have a new dress, too,&rdquo; declared
  Mrs. See. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you we are goin&rsquo; to a picnic.
  Goin&rsquo; to be a big time in Flag on Saturday, most like the
  Fourth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, heavenly!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly, rapturously. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
  to think I almost didn&rsquo;t come! ... Mrs. See, you&rsquo;re awfully
  kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. See went on with something in his mind. &ldquo;No Molly, we&rsquo;ve
  been fair to middlin&rsquo; prosperous down here in the valley. But this
  drift fence will make a difference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Caleb, isn&rsquo;t the land owned by the government? Couldn&rsquo;t
  any man homestead it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s the rub. Traft has no right to fence
  this free range. But he&rsquo;s a rich, powerful old duffer an&rsquo;
  bull-headed as one of his steers. Who&rsquo;re we down here to go to law?
  An&rsquo; where&rsquo;d we go? Fairfield, the county seat, is farther away
  than Flag. It takes time an&rsquo; money to travel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed the good woman. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;ll
  mean hard times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Susan, we can stand hard times, an&rsquo; I reckon come out
  ahead. But this drift fence means trouble. It&rsquo;s a slap in the face to
  every free ranger in this section. They&rsquo;ll all take it Traft accuses
  them of stealin&rsquo; unbranded stock that drifts down into the draws on the
  West Fork.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What kind of trouble, Uncle Caleb?&rdquo; queried Molly,
  soberly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lass, do you remember the Pleasant Valley war over across the
  mountains in the Tonto? Let&rsquo;s see, you must have been about six years
  old. Ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember, mamma wouldn&rsquo;t let me play out of the yard.
  We lived at Lunden then. But if I hadn&rsquo;t remembered I&rsquo;d sure know
  what that war was. Papa talks about it yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Lass, some people say your dad was crippled for sympathy to
  one faction in that fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pa denies it. But he was on the side of the sheepmen. An&rsquo;
  that riles my brother Arch somethin&rsquo; funny. They never get along. Arch
  isn&rsquo;t much good, Uncle Caleb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! I&rsquo;d not say that, for Arch has good parts. But
  he&rsquo;s much bad, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s no joke.... Wal, if Traft&rsquo;s
  outfit ever finishes their fence&mdash;at least down in the Diamond,
  it&rsquo;ll be cut. An&rsquo; as Traft runs a lot of hard-ridin&rsquo;
  an&rsquo; shootin&rsquo; cowpunchers, there&rsquo;s shore goin&rsquo; to be
  blood spilled. It takes years sometimes to wear out these feuds. An&rsquo;
  we&rsquo;ve a lot of thick-headed hombres in our neck of the
  woods.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His ominous reasoning had a silencing effect upon his hearers. The women
  of that country were pioneers in suffering, and there were many widows and
  orphans. Molly thought of her brother Arch. He was only twenty-two, yet he
  had killed more than one man, and through many fights, but few of them
  bloodless, he had earned a reputation that was no source of pride to his
  family. Arch not so long ago had been a nice boy. Lack of work, and drinking,
  and roaming the woods with fellows like Seth Haverly, had ruined him. Now it
  would grow worse, and that would make it harder for Molly&rsquo;s crippled
  father, who had to sit at home and brood.</p>

  <p>Molly conceived a resentment against the rich cattleman who could impose
  such restrictions and embitter the lives of poor people. And as for
  Traft&rsquo;s tenderfoot relative, who had come out from Missouri to run a
  hard outfit and build barbed-wire fences, Molly certainly hated him. Funny if
  she should meet him! What would he be like? A change from long-legged,
  unshaved, ragged boys who smelled of horses would be a relief, even if he was
  an enemy. It was unlikely, however, that she should have the luck to
  encounter Mr. Traft&rsquo;s nephew from Missouri, which fact would be good
  luck for him, at least. Molly would certainly let him know what she thought
  of him.</p>

  <p>It occurred to her presently that Arch had seen this new foreman of
  Traft&rsquo;s and could tell her all about him. How was Arch going to take
  this newcomer? Seth Haverly was as easy-going a boy as Arch, but dangerous
  when crossed. Molly was prone to spells of depression and she felt the
  imminence of one here.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, in order to shake off the insidious shadow, she devoted herself
  to the ride and to her companion, who needed a little cheering also.</p>

  <p>It had been years since Molly had been so many miles from the village. She
  did not remember the road. From her own porch she always had a wonderful view
  down the valley and across to the grand upheaval of earth and rock locally
  called the Diamond, and at the rugged black hills to the south. But now she
  was riding at a fast trot of a spirited team through a winding timbered
  canyon, along the banks of the West Fork. As there was a gradual down grade,
  the gray cliff walls grew higher until they were far above. Only a lone
  horseman was encountered in all the fifteen miles down to where the West Fork
  poured its white torrent into the Cibeque. Here Mr. See took the main road,
  which climbed and wound and zigzagged up the long slope. Molly looked down
  and back at the wilderness which was her home. All green and gray, and so
  big! She could not hate it, somehow. All her life she had known that kind of
  country. She had played among the ferns and the rock, and in the amber water,
  and under the brown-barked pines and spruces, where deer and elk and wild
  turkeys were as common as the cows she drove from pasture in the dusk. She
  felt that it would take a terrible break to sever her from this home of
  forest and gorge.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">FROM the head of the Cibeque the road wound through
  undulating forest land, heading the deep draws and glens, and gradually
  ascending to the zone of cedar and piñon, which marked the edge of the
  cattle-range.</p>

  <p>There had been snow on the ground all winter, which accounted for the
  abundance of gramma grass, now beginning to bleach in the early summer sun.
  Cattle dotted all the glades and flats and wide silvery meadows; and toward
  afternoon, from a ridge top the vast gray-green range spread like a billowy
  ocean far as eye could see.</p>

  <p>Several ranches were passed at any one of which See would have been
  welcome to spend the night, but he kept going all of daylight, and by night
  had covered more than half the journey to Flagerstown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, wife, we&rsquo;ve made Keech&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
  good, considerin&rsquo; our late start,&rdquo; remarked See, with
  satisfaction, as he drove into a wide clearing, the hideousness of which
  attested to the presence of an old sawmill. Rude clapboard cabins and fences,
  not to note the barking dogs, gave evidence of habitation.</p>

  <p>The cabins, however, were more inviting inside, Molly was to learn, and
  that the widow Keech was a most kindly and loquacious hostess. She had two
  grown daughters, and a son about fourteen years old, an enormously tall boy
  who straightway became victim to Molly, a conspicuous fact soon broadly
  hinted by his elders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So this hyar is John Dunn&rsquo;s girl growed up,&rdquo; said Mrs.
  Keech. &ldquo;I knowed your father well, an&rsquo; I seen you when you was a
  big-eyed kid. Now you&rsquo;re a woman ridin&rsquo; to Flag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly, however, was not to be led into conversation. This adventure seemed
  to her too grand to be joked about. She was keen to listen, and during the
  dinner hour heard much about Flagerstown and the fair to begin there on the
  morrow, and to end on Saturday with a rodeo. Mrs. See had not imparted all
  this marvelous news to Molly and she laughed at the girl&rsquo;s
  excitement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you know aboot this drift fence?&rdquo; finally asked See.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Caleb, it&rsquo;s a downright fact,&rdquo; replied the widow,
  forcefully. &ldquo;Harry has seen it. Traft&rsquo;s outfit are camped ten
  miles north of us. They&rsquo;ll pass here this summer an&rsquo; be down on
  your Diamond by the time snow flies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. So we heerd. But what&rsquo;s your idee aboot it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Caleb, all things considered, it&rsquo;ll be good for the
  range. For no matter what folks say, cattle-rustlin&rsquo; is not a thing of
  the past. Two-bit stealin&rsquo; of calves is what it really is. But
  rustlin&rsquo;, for all that. An&rsquo; up this way, anyhow, it&rsquo;ll
  help.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you runnin&rsquo; any stock?&rdquo; asked See,
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cows, mostly. I send a good deal of butter in to town. Really am
  gettin&rsquo; on better than when we tried to ranch it. I don&rsquo;t have to
  hire no-good punchers. People travel the road a lot these days. An&rsquo;
  they all stop hyar. I&rsquo;ve run up some little cabins.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a good idee,&rdquo; said See.</p>

  <p>Molly listened to hear everything, and particularly wanted to learn more
  about the young Missouri tenderfoot who had come out West to build fences for
  Traft. He would certainly have a miserable existence. And it was most liable
  to be short. To Molly&rsquo;s disappointment, no more was said about the
  drift fence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we&rsquo;ll rustle off to bed,&rdquo; concluded See.
  &ldquo;Mrs. Keech, I&rsquo;ll want to leave early in the
  mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly shared one of the new cabins with Mrs. See. It was small, clean, and
  smelled fragrantly of dry pine. It had three windows, and that to Molly was
  an innovation. She vowed she would have one like it, where she could have
  light in the daytime and air at night. She was tired, but not sleepy. Perhaps
  the bed was too comfortable. Anyway, Molly lay wide awake in the dark,
  wondering what was going to happen to her. This trip to Flagerstown might be
  a calamity for her. But she must have it. She must enjoy every moment of it,
  no matter what discontent it might engender.</p>

  <p>The hounds bayed the wolves and made her shudder. Wolves and coyotes
  seldom ranged down in the brakes of the Cibeque. Bears and lions were
  plentiful, but Molly had never feared them. Wolves had such a mournful,
  blood-curdling howl. And when the hounds answered it they imitated that note,
  or else imparted to it something of hunger for the free life their wild
  brothers enjoyed.</p>

  <p>When at last Molly fell asleep it seemed only a moment until she was
  rudely awakened. Mrs. See was up, dressing by lamplight. A gray darkness
  showed outside the open window, and the air that blew in on Molly was cold
  enough for early fall, down on the West Fork.</p>

  <p>But the great day was at hand. She found her voice, and even had a
  friendly word for the boy Harry, who certainly made the most of it. When she
  came out from breakfast, a clear cold morning, with rosy flush in the east,
  greeted her triumphantly, as if to impart that it had some magic in
  store.</p>

  <p>Harry squeezed Molly&rsquo;s arm, as he helped her into the buckboard, and
  said, confidently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you at the <i>rodeo</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hope so,&rdquo; replied Molly.</p>

  <p>Then they were off behind fresh horses and soon into the cedars. Jack
  rabbits bounded away, with their ridiculously long ears bobbing erect; lean
  gray coyotes watched them roll along; deer trotted out of sight into thick
  clumps of brush.</p>

  <p>Soon they came to the open top of a ridge and Molly saw a gray, dim,
  speckled world of range, so immense as to dwarf her sight. The scent from
  that vast gulf was intoxicating.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the sweet smell?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sage, you Cibeque Valley backwoods girl,&rdquo; replied Mrs. See.
  &ldquo;Anyone would think you&rsquo;d never been out of the
  timber.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t, much,&rdquo; laughed Molly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen
  an&rsquo; smelled sage, but it&rsquo;s so long ago I&rsquo;d forgotten.
  Reckon I&rsquo;d better be pretty careful up at Flag, Auntie See?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore you had. But what aboot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Talkin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m so ignorant,&rdquo; sighed Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be dumb. You just think before you speak.
  You&rsquo;re such a pretty little mouse that it&rsquo;ll become you. I
  don&rsquo;t care for gabby girls, myself. An&rsquo; I never seen a man who
  did, if he was in earnest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly was silent enough for the next long stretch. She watched a sunrise
  that made her think how beautiful the world was and how little she had seen,
  hidden down there in the green brakes. But she reproved herself for that.
  From her porch she could see the sun set in the great valley when the Diamond
  sheered abruptly down into the Cibeque, and nothing could have excelled that.
  And what could be better than the wooded canyons, deep and gray and green,
  with their rushing streams? But this open range took her breath. Here was the
  cattle country&mdash;what Mr. See had called the free range, and which riders
  like her brother Arch and Seth Haverly regarded as their own. Yet was it not
  a shame to fence that magnificent rolling land of green? For a moment Molly
  understood what it meant to be a range-rider, to have been born on a horse.
  She sympathized with Arch and Seth. A barbed-wire fence, no matter how far
  away, spoiled the freedom of that cedared grassy land.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, lass, thar&rsquo;s the smoke of Flag,&rdquo; said Mrs. See.
  &ldquo;Way down in the corner. Long ways yet. But we&rsquo;re shore
  gettin&rsquo; there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Smoke,&rdquo; said Molly, dreamily. &ldquo;Are they burnin&rsquo;
  brush?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw! That smoke comes from the railroad an&rsquo; the
  sawmill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>From there on the miles were long, yet interesting, almost every one of
  them, with herds of cattle wearing different brands, with ranches along the
  road, with the country appearing to spread and grow less cedared. Ten miles
  out of Flagerstown Mr. See pointed to a distant ridgetop, across which a new
  fence strung, startlingly clear against the sky. It gave Molly a pang.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traft&rsquo;s drift fence, I reckon,&rdquo; said See.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d almost rather have this a sheep range!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For all her poor memory, Molly remembered Flagerstown&mdash;the black
  timbered mountain above it, the sawmill with its pile of yellow lumber, the
  gray cottages on the outskirts, and at last the thrilling long main street,
  with buildings that looked wonderful to her. Mr. See remarked with
  satisfaction that the time was not much past four o&rsquo;clock. He drove
  straight down this busy thoroughfare. Molly was all eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hyar we are,&rdquo; said Mr. See, halting before a pretentious
  brick building. &ldquo;This is the new hotel, Molly. Now, wife, make the best
  of our good trip in. Take Molly in the stores. I&rsquo;ll look after the
  horses, get our rooms, an&rsquo; meet you hyar at six
  o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly leaped out of the buckboard with a grim yet happy realization that
  she would not need much longer to be ashamed of her shoes and stockings.</p>

  <p>Three hours later, Molly, radiant and laden with bundles, tagged into the
  hotel behind Mrs. See, likewise laden, to be greeted vociferously by Mr.
  See.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake! Have you robbed a store or been to a
  fire?&mdash;An&rsquo; hyar me waitin&rsquo; for supper!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Caleb, it happens seldom in a lifetime,&rdquo; replied his beaming
  wife. &ldquo;Help us pack this outfit to our rooms. Then we&rsquo;ll have
  supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly had a room of her own. She had never even seen one like it. Loath to
  leave her precious purchases, she lingered until they called her from the
  hall. It struck her again how warmly these old people looked at her. Molly
  guessed she was a circus and ruefully admitted reason for it.</p>

  <p>The dining-room might have been only &ldquo;fair to middlin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
  as Mr. See put it, but it was the most sumptuous place Molly had ever
  entered. Sight of it added to the excitement of the few hours&rsquo; shopping
  effectually robbed her of appetite.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon Molly wants a biscuit an&rsquo; a hunk of
  venison,&rdquo; remarked Mr. See.</p>

  <p>Molly did not know quite how to take that remark. She became aware, too,
  of being noticed by two young men at a near-by table. They were certainly not
  cowboys or timber-rangers. Molly was glad to get out and upstairs to the
  privacy of her room.</p>

  <p>There she unpacked the numerous bundles and parcels, and laid out her
  newly acquired possessions upon the bed. How quickly her little hoard of
  money had vanished! Still, it had gone farther than she had anticipated. Mrs.
  See had been incredibly generous. A blue print dress, a white dress with
  slippers and stockings to match, the prettiest little hat Molly had ever seen
  in her life, ribbons and gloves and what not&mdash;these had been the
  expansion of the good woman&rsquo;s promise.</p>

  <p>But not only the pleasure of looking and buying had Molly to think of. She
  had met more people than she had ever met before. She had been asked to serve
  in one of the booths at the fair. One of the storekeepers had offered her a
  position as clerk in his dry-goods department. And altogether the summing up
  of this day left Molly staggered with happiness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;ll
  spoil me.&rdquo; And she cried a little before she went to sleep.</p>

  <p>Another morning probed deeper into Molly&rsquo;s faculties for enjoyment
  and wonder. Mrs. See had relatives and friends in Flagerstown, and they made
  much of Molly. Not the least of that morning&rsquo;s interest was a look at
  Jim Traft, cattle king of the range. It was in the bank, where Molly and Mrs.
  See had visited with Mr. See.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s the old reprobate,&rdquo; whispered See to Molly.
  &ldquo;Jim Traft, who&rsquo;s fencin&rsquo; off West Fork from the
  range!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly stared. She saw a big man in his shirt sleeves and dusty top boots.
  He had a shrewd weather-beaten face, hard round the mouth and chin, but
  softened somewhat by bright blue eyes that certainly did not miss Molly. If
  he had not been Jim Traft it would have been quite possible to like him.</p>

  <p>As they turned to go out he hailed See.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t I know you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon I know you, Traft,&rdquo; returned See, not
  over-civilly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Caleb See.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. I never forget faces. You live down in the Cibeque. Glad to
  meet you again. If you&rsquo;re not in a hurry I&rsquo;d like to ask you some
  questions about your neck of the woods.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Glad to accommodate you, Traft,&rdquo; returned See, and then he
  indicated his companions. &ldquo;Meet my wife.... An&rsquo; this is our
  little friend, Molly Dunn. Her first visit to Flag since she was a
  kid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Traft shook hands with Mrs. See, and likewise Molly. He was quaint and
  genial, and his keen eyes approved of Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, wal! I&rsquo;m shore glad to meet you, young lady,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Molly Dunn of the Cibeque. I think I used to know your father.
  An&rsquo; this is your first visit to Flag in a long time?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. It seems a whole lifetime,&rdquo; replied Molly.</p>

  <p>When Molly got outside again she exclaimed, breathlessly: &ldquo;Oh, Mrs.
  See, he looked right through me! ... I don&rsquo;t want his pity.... But
  I&rsquo;m afraid the Dunns of the Cibeque have a bad name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon they have, Molly dear,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. See,
  practically. &ldquo;But so far as you are concerned it can be lived
  down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Mrs. See&mdash;I&rsquo;d have to stick to dad an&rsquo;
  Arch,&rdquo; said Molly, suddenly confronted with a lamentable fact.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. In a way you&rsquo;ve got to. I wouldn&rsquo;t think much of
  anyone who couldn&rsquo;t stand by her own kin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not until afternoon on the ride out to the fairgrounds did Molly quite
  forget Jim Traft&rsquo;s look and the ignominy of the Dunns. But once arrived
  there she quite lost her own identity. This girl in blue at whom everybody
  stared was some other person. Crowds of people, girls in gay apparel, cowboys
  in full regalia, Indians in picturesque attire, horses, horses, horses, and
  prize cattle, and every kind of a vehicle Molly had ever heard of, appeared
  to move before her eyes.</p>

  <p>Quite by magic, it seemed, she found herself separated from the smiling
  Mrs. See and conducted to a gayly decorated booth. There she was introduced
  to a girl about her own age, with whom she was to share the fascinating work
  of serving the public with sandwiches and coffee. Fortunately for Molly, her
  partner was nice and friendly, and certainly gave no indication that she had
  ever heard of the Dunns of West Fork.</p>

  <p>Under her amiable instruction Molly, who was nothing if not expert at
  waiting at table, acquitted herself creditably. But she could not get used to
  the marvelous gown she had on, and was in a panic for fear she might get a
  stain upon it. She did not, however, have so much work that she could not see
  what was going on, and presently she was having a perfectly wonderful
  time.</p>

  <p>Once she served three cowboys. They were hardly a new species to Molly.
  Nevertheless, she had not seen such brilliant scarves and fancy belts. She
  noticed, too, that these young men, like Arch and Seth, packed guns in their
  belts, a custom she had hardly expected to find at a fair. One of them made
  eyes at Molly.</p>

  <p>After a while they came back, when Molly&rsquo;s partner had left, and if
  ever Molly had seen the devil in the eyes of a youth she saw it in one of
  these customers. Still, he was not bad-looking and Molly could not help
  liking him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;What&rsquo;d you say your name was?&rdquo; he
  asked as he straddled the bench before the counter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; replied Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>ex</i>&mdash;cuse me. My mistake,&rdquo; he returned,
  crestfallen at the subdued glee of his comrades. &ldquo;Have you any
  pop?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or ginger ale?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not any pink lemonade?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only coffee an&rsquo; sandwiches an&rsquo; cake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cake? Well, give us cake an&rsquo; coffee,&rdquo; ordered the
  cowboy.</p>

  <p>She served them swiftly and discreetly, deftly avoiding the bold hand that
  sought to include her fingers as she passed a cup.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you live here?&rdquo; he asked, presently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know quite well I&rsquo;m a stranger in Flag, else you
  wouldn&rsquo;t be so impertinent,&rdquo; returned Molly, severely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw!&rdquo; He subsided with that exclamation. And his comrades
  proceeded to enjoy themselves at his expense. Molly&rsquo;s keen ears lost
  nothing of the banter. They were just brimful of fun. Evidently the bold one
  enjoyed something of a reputation as a lady-killer, and had at last met
  defeat. Presently, as he could not get Molly to notice him, and grew tired of
  listening to his friends, he threw some silver on the counter and said,
  loftily, &ldquo;Keep the change, Little Snowflake.&rdquo; Then he strode
  away, and after a few moments the others followed.</p>

  <p>From this time Molly was kept busy, and only gradually did it dawn upon
  her that a string of cowboys kept coming and going, for the very obvious
  reason of getting a look at her. More than once she heard the name Snowflake.
  Still, none of them were rude. Manifestly they had taken her for a guest of
  some prominent family in town, and a lady of quality. Molly enjoyed it
  hugely, though she had more than one melancholy reservation that it might
  have been different if they had guessed she was only one of the Dunns of the
  Cibeque.</p>

  <p>Soon she was relieved by the young lady, Miss Price, who shared the booth
  with her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the boys guessing,&rdquo; said this smiling
  worthy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve nagged me to death. I don&rsquo;t know them all,
  though. Just keep it up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t do anythin&rsquo; but wait on them,&rdquo;
  gasped Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Guess they think you&rsquo;re cold when
  you&rsquo;re only shy,&rdquo; went on Miss Price. &ldquo;But you can have a
  heap of fun. Keep on freezing them. Tomorrow night you&rsquo;ll have the time
  of your life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tomorrow night?&rdquo; faltered Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. Big dance after the <i>rodeo</i>. Didn&rsquo;t my mother tell
  you? Anyway, you&rsquo;re going with us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t heard. It&rsquo;s terrible kind of you. But
  I really couldn&rsquo;t go. I&rsquo;m such a stranger. An&rsquo; if
  they&mdash;they think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You dear kid! You are going. Mrs. See promised mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly thrillingly resigned herself to the unknown. The afternoon ended all
  too soon, and she rode back to town, babbling to the pleased Mrs. See about
  the adventure she was having. That night they were out to dine with relatives
  of Mrs. See. No other young person was present and Molly had the relief of
  being comparatively unnoticed. These serious older people talked about the
  affairs of the town and the range, all of which found lodgment in
  Molly&rsquo;s mind.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">IT WAS Saturday afternoon and the <i>rodeo</i> had just
  begun, which accounted for the deserted appearance of the grounds adjacent.
  Molly had remained longer than was really necessary. Mrs. See would be
  waiting for her at the stand. She was about to leave when she saw that she
  was to have a last customer.</p>

  <p>A young man, in overalls and heavy boots, got off a dusty horse and
  approached the booth. He asked for something to eat and drink. Apparently he
  took no notice of Molly. His face wore a troubled look.</p>

  <p>Of all the young men Molly had waited upon in two days, this was the first
  one who had not looked at her twice, and the only one who had not appeared
  gay or bold or pleasant. Molly felt a little pique and secondly more than a
  little curiosity.</p>

  <p>He might have been twenty-two or -three years old and evidently was not a
  cowboy. Molly judged that he would have been fair-skinned if he had not been
  so sunburnt. His nose had begun to peel, but these demerits did not exactly
  keep him from being handsome. Presently he laid his sombrero on the counter,
  which act disclosed light wavy hair, and a broad brow marred by deep
  furrows.</p>

  <p>He struck Molly just about right, and considering her vast experience
  during these two days, she imagined she was a connoisseur in young men. He
  slowly drank the last of his coffee, and looking up, met Molly&rsquo;s
  glance. Then she knew he had not seen her before. He had gray eyes full of
  shadows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you do if you were just about licked?&rdquo; he
  queried, suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; exclaimed Molly.</p>

  <p>He repeated the question, this time more deliberately, as if now he
  weighed it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d get up an&rsquo; fight some more,&rdquo; declared
  Molly, surprised into genuine sincerity.</p>

  <p>He smiled. Then something beside surprise happened to Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You would? Suppose then you got licked sure?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t make no difference,&rdquo; replied Molly, at last
  forgetting to watch her speech. And she smiled back at him.</p>

  <p>He saw her really then as a girl, and not as any individual who might
  propound a personal point of view. Leaning his elbows on the counter, he
  regarded her with interest verging upon admiration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ll take your hunch. I&rsquo;ll not quit. If they
  lick me&mdash;I should say <i>when</i> they lick me, I&rsquo;ll get up and
  fight some more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His words were severe, his purpose almost grim, yet Molly realized the
  best compliment she ever had received was being paid her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never saw you before,&rdquo; he went on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t my fault,&rdquo; replied Molly, demurely, with
  level gaze on him. What a nice face he had!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t live in Flag,&rdquo; he protested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No indeed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from the Cibeque.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cibeque. Is that a town or a ranch or what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a valley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never heard of it. How far?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two days&rsquo; ride.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just here on a visit?&rdquo; continued the young man, and it was
  manifest that every word carried him farther into interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. We leave in the mawnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Molly, and sighed.
  Would she ever come back to Flagerstown? And if so, could it ever be so
  wonderful?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long while yet,&rdquo; he returned, and smiled
  again, with a meaning which made Molly&rsquo;s heart jump. &ldquo;I
  haven&rsquo;t heard, but of course there&rsquo;ll be a dance tonight. And
  you&rsquo;ll be going?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly nodded. She had begun to be conscious of confusing sensations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet every blame cowboy at this <i>rodeo</i> has a dance
  with you,&rdquo; he declared, jealously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He gave her a long gaze that began in doubt and ended with trust. Molly
  felt that he knew every last thing in the world about her and she wanted the
  earth to open and swallow her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for these town dances,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to this one&mdash;if it&rsquo;s true you&rsquo;re
  not engaged for every dance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To tell the truth I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t one single dance
  yet,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well! Then your best fellow isn&rsquo;t here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t happen to exist,&rdquo; said Molly, wistfully.
  Like all the others, he had taken her for somebody, and if he knew she was
  only Molly Dunn of West Fork he would not be so nice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen. This is a serious matter,&rdquo; he rejoined, gravely.
  &ldquo;Young ladies aren&rsquo;t always to be believed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to anyone,&rdquo; retorted Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Honest! You haven&rsquo;t a best fellow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t <i>any</i> fellow,&rdquo; replied Molly, blushing
  rosily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only sixteen. Did you think me as old as
  Methuselah?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your age hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me. But I&rsquo;d have taken you
  for eighteen, anyhow. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter.... Have you been in
  Flag lately?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not for years. I was a little girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you dance with me tonight?&rdquo; he asked, without any
  pretense.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Molly, equally sincerely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How many times?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know about that. You see, I&rsquo;m not used
  to city dances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;d be quite proper, if that worries you. You see
  <i>I</i> might be taken for your best fellow. I&rsquo;d sure like that....
  Would you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d not be terribly disagreeable to me,&rdquo; said Molly,
  archly, and after a roguish glance she looked away.</p>

  <p>But he responded to that differently from what she might have expected.
  &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he rejoined, and stood up, with his gray eyes
  alight. &ldquo;Save some dances for me. Good-by, Miss Cibeque.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He strode away and led his horse in the direction of the corrals. Molly
  stood there tingling, to be disturbed by the arrival of Mrs. See.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had one last customer,&rdquo; said Molly, as if apologizing for
  the delay.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Child, everythin&rsquo; closed at one. The <i>rodeo</i> is
  on,&rdquo; returned Mrs. See. &ldquo;Hurry now, but don&rsquo;t forget the
  cash. We&rsquo;ll turn that over to Mrs. Price.... You&rsquo;ve been a
  success, Molly. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m tickled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They hurried into the crowded stand, where some one had kept seats for
  them; and straightway Molly became absorbed in her first <i>rodeo</i>. After
  that, time meant nothing. The horse-races left her weak and quite husky, for
  she yelled in unison with everybody else present. The staid Mrs. See hit a
  fat gentleman on the head with her umbrella, and that was only a minor
  indiscretion observed by Molly.</p>

  <p>Then came exhibition trick riding by experts of the range. Molly could
  ride a horse herself and she knew what good horsemanship included, but this
  riding went far beyond anything she could have imagined. One rider, bareback,
  rode at full speed, and he slipped all over his horse, even underneath. But
  that appeared less wonderful than the splendid rider who rode two
  race-horses, standing with one foot on the bare back of each. Molly thrilled
  to her toes at that performance.</p>

  <p>The roping of calves was not new to her, though she had never believed
  such swift time possible. The roping of two-year-olds was a sterner game.
  Next after that came the riding of bucking bronchos. In any horse country
  there are bound to be some mean horses, and Molly imagined she had seen a
  few. But she had not even known what a mean horse was like. There was a black
  devil of a mustang with rolling white eyes that simply made the cold chills
  run over Molly. Buck! He went six feet into the air, doubled up, and came
  down stiff-legged. And he threw three successive riders. Yet how these lean,
  supple, round-limbed, small-hipped cowboys could ride! They stuck on like
  burrs. But it was dangerous sport. Many were thrown. One red-headed fellow
  had a horse fall back on him. Another rolled clear over with his horse and
  still came up in the saddle. At this the crowd roared. Molly saw another boy
  carried off the field, but she had not observed what had happened to him.
  When that whirling, dusty, snorting, and yelling mêlée ended it was none too
  soon for Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bulldoggin&rsquo; steers next,&rdquo; said Mr. See, consulting his
  program.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Goodness! Do they chase them with bulldogs?&rdquo; ejaculated
  Molly, in amaze.</p>

  <p>See laughed heartily. &ldquo;Wal, thet&rsquo;s a good one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Caleb, this is Molly&rsquo;s first <i>rodeo</i>,&rdquo; reproved
  his wife, though it was plain the girl&rsquo;s remark had tickled her.</p>

  <p>Molly was soon to learn more. A wicked wide-horned steer was let loose,
  and a cowboy, superbly mounted, came tearing down the field, to drive the
  steer furiously, catch up with it, and then to dive out of his saddle. He
  alighted on the neck of the steer, and swinging down by the horns he tumbled
  it head over heels, and rolled over with it. Molly screamed. But the cowboy
  came out of the dust unhurt and victorious, for there he sat on the head of
  the steer, holding it down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There! What do you think of that for a cowboy?&rdquo; exclaimed
  See, turning to Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s wonderful. But he&rsquo;s crazy. Who ever heard of such
  a thing?&rdquo; returned Molly, feelingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. See. &ldquo;I think this
  bulldoggin&rsquo; sport is brutal. Where&rsquo;s the sense in it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t none. But shore takes a slick rider to do it,&rdquo;
  said her husband.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A cowboy once told me he didn&rsquo;t have an unbroken bone in his
  body. Now I can see why,&rdquo; commented Molly.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, though this style of riding, and downing a steer like a
  bulldog, made Molly cold and sick, she could not help watching it through.
  She would certainly have something to tell Arch Dunn. Fortunately, none of
  the riders were seriously hurt during this most perilous test of horsemanship
  and hardihood. And the rest of the program allowed Molly to recover.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, lass, an&rsquo; how&rsquo;d you like it?&rdquo; asked Mr.
  See.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the most wonderful time in all my life,&rdquo;
  dreamily replied Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With the best yet to come,&rdquo; added Mrs. See. &ldquo;This is
  all very well for the men, but it&rsquo;s the dance where a girl
  shines.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With that remark there came flashing back to Molly the strange thoughts
  and sensations roused by her last customer at the booth. Ought she not tell
  Mrs. See about this young man? Molly was inherently honest and she knew she
  should, but she was also in conflict with feelings new to her, and most
  confusing. She would wait. What would Mrs. See and Mrs. Price think of her if
  they knew she had promised dances to a stranger who had not even told her his
  name? That omission had not even occurred to Molly until now. All during the
  service at the booth she had been most careful of her tongue, and then the
  very last young man had made her forget herself and what was due her
  hostesses. Molly could not understand it. He had sort of carried her away.
  Still, he had not been bold like some of the cowboys, or flirtatious like
  others. At least she did not think so. But then she might have been wrong.
  The trouble was he had surprised her into liking him. No doubt of that! Who
  was he and what had troubled him and how had he been about licked, as he
  called it? Would it be possible for any young fellow to be so clever and so
  deceitful as to make up all that? Molly was startled. She had known boys to
  do queer tricks. But she loyally defended this one who had found her weak. He
  was as honest as he was nice.</p>

  <p>Here Molly got down to the point where he had become so undisguisedly
  interested in the fact that she did not have a best fellow. There had been a
  soft, almost mischievous light in his gray eyes. Could he have meant that he
  would like to be her best fellow? Molly burned within and without. The
  tumultuous fact was that he could be her only fellow, if he wanted to be. And
  she was ashamed and shocked to confess it. What had good Mrs. See brought
  upon her?</p>

  <p>This perturbing state of mind got side-tracked again at the hotel, from
  which there was a general exodus of ranchers who lived near town. Molly was
  thrown in contact with women whom the Sees knew. And at dinner they sat with
  friends, so that Molly was not able to think for herself, until she got to
  her room. There anticipation and delight assailed her again, into which crept
  a dread of what she knew not.</p>

  <p>Then she spread the white gown and accessories out on the bed, to revel in
  them, and forget the proximity of catastrophe. The following hour was one of
  exultation and dismay combined. She fixed her hair this way and that, never
  satisfied. It was an apparition which stared wide-eyed at her from the
  mirror. Who was this girl? Her arms and shoulders were bare. She could not
  get over the feeling of being still undressed.</p>

  <p>When Mrs. See came in, to exclaim in raptures over her, then Molly&rsquo;s
  last vestige of sense went into eclipse. She needed to be scolded and
  reminded that she was only Molly Dunn of the Cibeque, instead of being lauded
  to the skies, and told not one of the society girls at St. Louis, where Mrs.
  See had once been, could hold a candle to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Upon your haid be it!&rdquo; murmured Molly, tragically.</p>

  <p>And so they went out to the dance, which was held in the town-hall a few
  blocks from the hotel. They walked, and Molly trod on air. Never in her life
  had she felt anything like her sensations when she walked through the crowd
  before the hall, between lines of men and women, children, Indians, and then
  at the entrance, before a phalanx of polished-faced cowboys. Whatever
  happened, she would have that to remember.</p>

  <p>Inside there was a goodly assembly, among whom were Mrs. Price, her
  daughter Ellen, and an awkward son about Molly&rsquo;s age. They at once
  appropriated Molly, and this perhaps was the time of greatest strain for her.
  It was scarcely necessary, however, for Molly to remember Mrs. See&rsquo;s
  injunctions. She scarcely had a voice at all. Fortunately, she was too little
  and dainty to be clumsy, and shyness only added to her charm.</p>

  <p>There was a good deal of standing around, talking and waiting, with
  introductions in order, while slowly the hall filled comfortably. Then the
  music began and it was not a fiddle sawed by a backwoodsman, but real music,
  and Molly could have danced in leaden boots.</p>

  <p>Waltzes and square dances, with the former in large proportion, were to be
  the program. Molly&rsquo;s first partner was the Price boy, who could not
  dance very well, but that did not spoil it for her. It developed that
  intermissions were frequent, but brief. The young people clamored to dance.
  They would let the old folk sit and look on and talk. Molly had the next
  dance with a friend of Ellen&rsquo;s, a young man of the town, very pleasant
  and attentive, and a good dancer. And the third with Mr. Price, himself, who
  declared he would allow nothing to prevent him having a dance with Molly. She
  enjoyed it, too, for he was light on his feet and full of fun.</p>

  <p>All this while, which seemed interminable despite her enjoyment, Molly
  knew there was something amiss. The dance had really begun and she was there.
  Everywhere she turned she met smiles and admiring glances. They bewildered
  her. Yet she was keen to note that this was no wild, continuous, stamping
  log-cabin dance. Hilarity prevailed, but not boisterousness. She wondered if
  there would be any drinking and fights. A dance without these would be new to
  Molly.</p>

  <p>Then, after the fourth, when she was standing with a group near the
  entrance of the hall, she saw Him. She felt herself tremble. He wore black
  and looked tall and slim. His eager eyes, dark with excitement, swept the
  hall. Molly knew what they were searching for. She had never wanted anything
  so badly as for him to see her, yet she was afraid. He did see her. His smile
  and bow came before he had time to look her over. Then Molly&rsquo;s cup grew
  perilously full. But what would he do? She was standing with Ellen Price and
  her friends. Suppose this stranger would present himself! Molly thought she
  might pretend to have forgotten his name; then if he had any sense he could
  save the situation for her. To her relief, however, he did not approach.</p>

  <p>The music burst forth again and another partner claimed Molly. But even in
  the whirling throng she did not lose sight of this young man whom she had
  promised dances. Now and then as she turned she saw him leaning against the
  wall. Met his dark glance! It followed her everywhere. He did not dance. He
  did not mingle with the crowd. During the next intermission she saw that he
  was noticed by girls, who whispered to one another, and by cowboys who gave
  him rather contemptuous looks. Both actions struck Molly singularly. In some
  sense he seemed an outsider or else he did not choose to make himself
  agreeable. The meaning of feminine glances sent his way was not lost upon
  Molly. And when she, too, dared to glance his way, to find him watching her,
  she would quickly avert her eyes. She realized that he hopefully and
  reasonably expected her to give him an opportunity.</p>

  <p>At the end of the next number, which Molly had with young Price, she
  claimed to be a little tired and wanted to sit down. They found a vacant
  place, where they conversed for the brief interval.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall I take you across to mother?&rdquo; asked young Price.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I&rsquo;ll wait here for my next partner,&rdquo;
  replied Molly, graciously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me then,&rdquo; he returned, and left her.</p>

  <p>Molly hoped her stranger would be quick. But she had scarcely prepared
  herself for his sudden arrival.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this mine?&rdquo; he asked, bending over her eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured Molly, rising.</p>

  <p>Then he whirled her into the throng. His presence did not quite make her
  oblivious to his strong arm, his light step, his perfect time. But instantly
  Molly realized she did not need to help this young man learn his steps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was afraid you&rsquo;d forgotten me,&rdquo; he said, pressing her
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; returned Molly.</p>

  <p>He laughed and obeyed her. Molly&rsquo;s head came about to his shoulder
  and she just escaped contact with it. Not that she wished to! She felt that
  her face must be burning and she would have liked to hide it there. She did
  not seem to be making any effort to dance. Yet she was whirling, swaying,
  gliding around among dancers who looked vague and dim. All the threatened
  feelings accumulated during the last two days took possession of her now.</p>

  <p>The music ceased when they were at the farther end of the hall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come. Let&rsquo;s get out before some of them grab you,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;I must talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">HE LED her out through a corridor to a long porch, high up
  over a garden. It appeared deserted and shadowy. There was moonlight at the
  corner and just at the edge of it a bench. He found a seat for her there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look perfectly lovely,&rdquo; he said, expelling a deep breath,
  as if in relief. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know me, anyhow,&rdquo; returned Molly,
  not knowing what to say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor you me. But at first I thought you did. It sure was jolly. To
  think I almost didn&rsquo;t ride to town!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That would have been terrible, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; murmured
  Molly. She could not remain silent. He seemed to draw expression from
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It sure would. But I don&rsquo;t want to tell you about myself,
  now. I want to talk about you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we mysterious?&rdquo; He took her hand and held
  it.</p>

  <p>Molly did not have the desire to withdraw it, nor the strength. But she
  managed to look up. How pale and eager he was! His eyes devoured her. And his
  face wore an ineffable smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All&rsquo;s fair in love and war,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;And I rustled you away from <i>them</i>,&rdquo; he indicated the
  distant dance-hall by an eloquent gesture, &ldquo;to have a minute with you
  alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly&rsquo;s presagement that something was going to happen to her was
  near its fulfillment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strange thing about you&mdash;a lack I can&rsquo;t
  understand,&rdquo; he went on.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;do you mean?&rdquo; faltered Molly. Had he found her out
  already?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the most wonderful thing for me. I mean about
  the&mdash;the lack of that best fellow you said you didn&rsquo;t have. How
  does it happen? Sure you&rsquo;re only sixteen. But that&rsquo;s quite grown
  up in this country. Have you a fierce father or brother?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet I have. Both!&rdquo; replied Molly, with a little laugh.
  She was sure of her ground here.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then that accounts. I&rsquo;m glad. I was afraid of something else.
  ... Very well, I make application for the vacant place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Place?&rdquo; echoed Molly, weakly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I most earnestly apply for the job of being your best
  fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&mdash;you can&rsquo;t be serious!&rsquo; exclaimed Molly,
  in confusion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Serious? I&rsquo;m afraid it is,&rdquo; he said, running a hand
  through his hair. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me. And I haven&rsquo;t any
  recommendations. But I&rsquo;d like you to take me on without
  these.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t customary,&rdquo; returned Molly, trying to be light
  when she feared he might hear the outrageous beating of her heart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know that. But I&rsquo;ve a weakness to be trusted with
  responsibility. If I hadn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;d never gotten into the trouble
  I&rsquo;m bucking now.... You&rsquo;ll have to take me on faith&mdash;or not
  at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t it&mdash;it apply to me&mdash;that way?&rdquo;
  asked Molly, tremulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m a man. And you&rsquo;re a girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m beginnin&rsquo; to find that out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed as if her reply was encouragement and possessed himself of her
  other hand. Then undoubtedly he began to draw her a little toward him, but to
  do him justice Molly imagined he did not realize it. She did, however, to the
  imminent danger of rout of reserve and self-control.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would take you as my best girl&mdash;my <i>only</i> girl, I
  should say, without one single thing beside your Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly felt irresistibly drawn to the edge of an abyss. Here was an
  opportunity quite beyond even her dreams.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo; Molly did not know
  just what he was, besides being very careless and foolish. He had her almost
  leaning on his shoulder now. She had not made the slightest resistance. She
  was as unstable as water. Still, she tried to think in spite of his nearness
  and her dawning emotions. &ldquo;If I
  said&mdash;yes&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; afterwards you went back on
  me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Heavens! ... Little girl, you had better say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;
  pretty quick or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He choked at the end of that passionate utterance. Molly knew what he
  meant. For the moment it paralyzed her. And then it was too late. He had her
  in his arms&mdash;tight against his breast. Molly closed her eyes. She did
  not realize her state beyond the exquisite contrast to what her backwoods
  admirers had roused in her. And suddenly that thought ended in a singular
  revulsion. She stiffened. She repulsed him with a stinging slap which,
  blindly delivered, struck him across the lips.</p>

  <p>He uttered an inarticulate cry of surprise and regret. His hand went to
  his mouth, and then he applied a handkerchief there. The force of the blow
  had cut his lip.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I apologize,&rdquo; he said, constrainedly. &ldquo;Sure lost my
  head&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t mean to insult you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly, with as unaccountable an impulse as the other placed a tender
  trembling hand on his lips. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she
  whispered, wildly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that&mdash;at all.&rdquo; And
  she followed the touch of her hand with a shy swift kiss. Then she gasped at
  her utter effrontery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well!&mdash;You make sweet amends,&rdquo; he said, haltingly, as if
  she were beyond him. &ldquo;By that did you mean
  &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly dropped her head and covered her face with her hands. The tight, hot
  constriction in her breast eased its grip.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I meant, only it wasn&rsquo;t
  &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In that case you&rsquo;d better explain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly looked up, impelled by his tone. His eyes burned doubtfully down
  upon her. His face shone pale in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m dishonest,&rdquo; she burst out.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve slapped boys before when they&mdash;took liberties with me.
  I liked them, I suppose, but I didn&rsquo;t want them pawin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
  kissin&rsquo; me.... I really gave in to you.... Only, I wasn&rsquo;t fair. I
  wasn&rsquo;t honest. I hit you because I&mdash;I wanted you to keep on
  believin&rsquo; I was what all these people thought.... They&rsquo;ve made me
  act a lie. Me&mdash;in these pretty clothes! But, oh, I couldn&rsquo;t help
  it. I was afraid all the time. I <i>knew</i> somethin&rsquo; terrible would
  happen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wanted me to believe you were what?&rdquo; he asked, sharply,
  bending over her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like Miss Price an&rsquo; her friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think they might do well by being more like you,&rdquo; he
  returned. &ldquo;I asked to be your best fellow. I sure never asked it of any
  of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo; cried Molly, distracted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can see and think, cain&rsquo;t I? You&rsquo;re the sweetest,
  loveliest little girl I ever met.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly was brutally torn between the ecstasy of that and the mercilessness
  of her honesty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine feathers make fine birds,&rdquo; she replied, bitterly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You poor kid! ... There&rsquo;s something queer here, but I swear
  it&rsquo;s not in you. I&rsquo;m taking your kiss for
  &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;&mdash;Heavens! what else could a kiss mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no. It meant nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are your kisses so common, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the first boy I <i>ever</i> kissed,&rdquo; she flashed
  at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very proud of that. Well, then, what else could it mean
  except &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was beside myself. I told you.... I was ashamed&mdash;sick
  because I hit you. But I wasn&rsquo;t dishonest when I kissed you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You said you wanted me to think you like Miss Price and her
  friends. That puzzles me. I do think they can&rsquo;t compare with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re only fooled,&rdquo; she said, despairingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. This pretty dress, an&rsquo; the
  place&mdash;an&rsquo; everythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, it wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference to me what you wore or
  where you were,&rdquo; he protested, tenderly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it would!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, you child, didn&rsquo;t I fall in love with you at the
  booth?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This protestation was almost too beautiful and poignant for Molly to bear.
  It came in the nature of a revelation of her own beset state. In another
  instant she knew she would surrender and fall into his arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know who I am!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re my sweetheart!&rdquo; he returned, triumphantly.</p>

  <p>Molly suffered during one instant of glorious exaltation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am Molly Dunn, of the Cibeque,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly Dunn. What a pretty name! ... Cibeque? Oh, that&rsquo;s the
  valley you told me about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. They call it the brakes of the Cibeque.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunn, I&rsquo;ve heard that name, too. Oh yes, I got into an
  argument with a fellow named Dunn. Slinger Dunn, they called him. But sure
  you couldn&rsquo;t be any relation to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she queried, in a curious calm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heavens! He&rsquo;s a desperado! Wonderful-looking chap. They call
  him &lsquo;Slinger&rsquo; because of his habit of throwing a gun. He has
  killed several men. The sheriff here is scared to death of him. I happened to
  cross his trail, unfortunately, and gave him a piece of my mind. If I ever
  saw lightning in a man&rsquo;s eyes I saw it then. Whew! ... Well, his
  companion, as tough-looking fellow as he was, dragged him away. Saved me a
  scare if not more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His right name is Arch,&rdquo; replied Molly, and rose to her
  feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, living around here you&rsquo;d have heard of him. It
  must be disgusting to have a criminal like that roaming around with the name
  of Dunn. People might think he is related to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young man rose slowly, in consternation, and made an appealing
  gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible, Miss Dunn.... Perhaps a very distant
  relation?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He is my brother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God! Your brother? You lovely, dainty, sweet little lady! ...
  Why, I saw him again, drunk and dirty, hobnobbing with Mexicans and Indians.
  If he&rsquo;s a&mdash;one of your family, he surely must be an
  outcast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. He was home the day I left to come here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He appeared suddenly staggered, not only by the truth, but by the nature
  of his transgression.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; he began, hurriedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  hurt you. I never dreamed&mdash;please forgive me.... After all, it was
  natural enough. Another of my damned tenderfoot blunders! But who would ever
  think that you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Now you&rsquo;ve said it,&rdquo; she interrupted,
  passionately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Dunn, I was only going to say who would ever think a wonderful
  girl like you could have such a rotten brother.&mdash;Well, it makes no
  difference to me, I assure you of that,&rdquo; he said, bravely, essaying a
  fine effort to keep under restraint. He was regarding her fearfully and again
  he had turned pale.</p>

  <p>The bitterness of reality had steeled Molly, yet she shook inwardly as he
  stood there, erect and earnest, doing her honor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yet it does, or you couldn&rsquo;t have talked so,&rdquo; she
  replied, shaking her head gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say it doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;And I certainly
  shall hold you to your word.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Word? I didn&rsquo;t give any.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You kissed me. Of your own sweet will! You can&rsquo;t get over
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I cain&rsquo;t.... But it wasn&rsquo;t a promise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It certainly was. More than a promise. Unless you lied to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lie? I wouldn&rsquo;t lie to you,&rdquo; she declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I hold you to it.... Come, let&rsquo;s forget the&mdash;the
  thing. You see, Molly, we fell in love before we got acquainted. Didn&rsquo;t
  we? Isn&rsquo;t that great?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say we&mdash;I fell in love,&rdquo; returned Molly,
  pondering over the significance of the words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in words&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again Molly felt the imminence of a precipice. She could not resist this
  young man, stranger though he was, and presently she would not care to
  try.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I kissed you because I wanted to be square,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;With myself, same as with you. I sure wasn&rsquo;t when I hit you.
  That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How can you say that? Kissing me proved your honesty. And for such
  a girl as I hold you to be, a kiss means a good deal. It just about means
  everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly was mournfully becoming cognizant of that very fact. Desperately she
  cried out again that she was only Molly Dunn of the Cibeque.</p>

  <p>At this he seized her in his arms, masterfully, yet guardedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop harping on that,&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What do I care who
  you are? You might be Sally Jones of the Missouri. I don&rsquo;t care any
  more than you&rsquo;d care if my name was Bud Applegate instead of Jim
  Traft.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Instead&mdash;of&mdash;what?&rdquo; faltered Molly, slipping out of
  his arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, James Traft! Jim, for short.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traft? But that&rsquo;s the name of&mdash;of the cattle
  king.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;m his nephew. My Dad is his brother. I was named
  after Uncle Jim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the new foreman of the Traft outfit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; he replied, nettled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very
  question your brother asked me. Only he was insulting and
  you&rsquo;re&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t care to have <i>you</i> ridicule me.
  The idea of my being a foreman seems to stick in the craw of these
  Westerners. Why not? I&rsquo;m no nincompoop.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the fellow who&rsquo;s buildin&rsquo; the drift
  fence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I am,&rdquo; he replied unsteadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you know that fence is a slap in the face to every person down
  in the Cibeque?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. Uncle Jim said it would rile a lot of no-good
  homesteaders.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the daughter of one of them. An&rsquo; sister to
  another,&rdquo; rejoined Molly, in tragic finality, and with a flash of eyes
  she left him there.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">UP TO eighteen years of age James Traft had often seen his
  uncle, the Arizona pioneer and cattleman, who made frequent trips East. There
  had grown up a bond of affection between them. James had from knee-high
  listened to stories of Indian fights and road-agents, gunmen and rustlers.
  The Westerner had never married; he was devoted to his brother, who was
  James&rsquo;s father.</p>

  <p>Then had come an interval of four years during which Jim Traft did not
  visit Missouri. His vast interests had grown so complicated that he could not
  leave them. During this time James had been at loose ends, trying farming,
  clerking, and odd jobs without any indication that he might set the world on
  fire. At last a letter from the West at least changed the world for
  James.</p>

  <p>Some passages in this blunt letter to his father were hard for James to
  swallow.&mdash;In the natural course of events all of Jim Traft&rsquo;s
  property would go to his nephew James. But that was something aside from
  James ever making good use of it. If he were a strong, resourceful boy with
  guts he might become a rancher. The cattle industry was growing. The days of
  the great rustler barons were gone, though cattle-stealing still represented
  altogether a big loss to the range. And so on.</p>

  <p>The implication seemed to be that James would get all his uncle&rsquo;s
  money without having worked for it, and that there was a question whether or
  not he was big enough for the West. At first James had been humiliated and
  furious, and would hear nothing of going to Arizona. Nevertheless, his father
  prevailed in the end. Old Jim was caustic and crude; he had grown up in the
  stern school of the ranges, but he was the very salt of the earth and had
  genuine affection for James. He would be terribly hurt if James refused and
  he would never understand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It scares me a little, Jimmy,&rdquo; his father had said.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to have the real stuff in you out there. I believe
  you have and I want you to go. Show Jim you&rsquo;re a Traft!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Persuaded and made to realize his opportunity, for which he should
  sacrifice anything and strive with all his heart, James started West. His
  first acquaintance with the Great Plains had come from the window of a train,
  and long before he saw the vast gray slopes of Colorado and the white-peaked
  Rockies, the latent spirit of adventure stirred thrillingly in him. Then the
  wild timbered uplands of New Mexico and the red-walled canyons of Arizona won
  him to the West, long before he stepped off the train at Flagerstown.</p>

  <p>He had telegraphed his uncle as to his arrival, but there was no one to
  meet him. What a funny, slow, sleepy, wide-streeted town! Every other
  building, all high-boarded and weathered, appeared to house a saloon. He knew
  his uncle lived out of town, though not far. James finally found a
  livery-stable, where he engaged a loquacious negro to drive him, bag and
  baggage, out into the country. What he learned from this citizen of
  Flagerstown, in that short drive, was certainly not reassuring.</p>

  <p>But James liked the pine forest and the gray levels along the road, and
  the black mountains rising in the distance. And he had a fine view of Jim
  Traft&rsquo;s ranch home. It was nothing at all like he had pictured. Uncle
  Jim had been long on cattle deals and short on description, so far as talk
  was concerned. Across one of the wide grassy flats the long, low white house
  stood on a pine-timbered knoll, and below it clustered a bewildering array of
  corrals, barns, and sheds. Cattle dotted the wide valley, and on the fenced
  meadows horses and colts grazed, too numerous to count.</p>

  <p>The road wound along the edge of the timber, from which James had ample
  opportunity to see the ranch at different angles, and by the time he reached
  the house was wild with enthusiasm about his future home.</p>

  <p>A low-roofed comfortable porch fronted the house. Here James deposited his
  baggage, and paying the driver, he knocked. Nobody answered, however, so he
  went around to the back. A wide courtyard led out to the corrals. He espied
  men out there and directed his footsteps in that direction.</p>

  <p>Soon he came upon three cowboys around a horse, and then his uncle, who
  stood with another man, watching them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Uncle Jim!&rdquo; he yelled, and his rapid strides soon
  fetched him up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Jim!&rdquo; replied the rancher, as if he had seen his
  nephew only yesterday, and extended his hand. &ldquo;Got your telegram, but
  forgot to meet you.... By gum! you&rsquo;ve sprung up like a weed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Traft had not changed. His garb, however, was new to Jim, and consisted of
  high boots, corduroys tucked in them, an old leather belt with an empty
  gun-sheath on it, gray soft shirt, and a vest that had been new years ago. He
  was a stalwart figure of a man, nearing seventy, but still erect and rugged,
  with a lined hard face expressive of his life on the frontier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shake hands with Ring Locke,&rdquo; said Traft, indicating his
  companion, a tall, lean, sandy-complexioned Westerner whose narrow eyes were
  almost hidden under an old black sombrero.</p>

  <p>Jim was cordial and prompt in his greeting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do!&rdquo; drawled Locke, whose accent proclaimed him a Texan.
  &ldquo;I shore am glad to meet you, sah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is the nephew I told you about, Ring,&rdquo; went on Traft.
  &ldquo;He has come West to run the Diamond outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim tried to bear well the scrutiny given him by this range boss of his
  uncle&rsquo;s, a right-hand man who had been with him twenty years.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle should have said I&rsquo;ll <i>try</i> to run that outfit,
  Mr. Locke,&rdquo; said Jim, frankly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid. But
  I&rsquo;m an awful tenderfoot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Perhaps his earnestness favorably impressed Locke, for he smiled and
  replied, dryly, &ldquo;Wal, it ain&rsquo;t bad to start when you&rsquo;re a
  tenderfoot, just so long as you know it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet I know it,&rdquo; continued Jim, hastening to follow that
  up. &ldquo;When Uncle&rsquo;s letter came I was sure up a tree. It sounded
  wonderful. But I had listened to Uncle Jim&rsquo;s stories about gunmen and
  bad cowboys, wild steers and bucking bronchos, stampedes and rustling. It
  wasn&rsquo;t easy to decide.... But here I am. And I can take a
  licking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, reckon you&rsquo;re likely to get it,&rdquo; rejoined Locke.
  &ldquo;But in this heah country a lickin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;, so
  long&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not for keeps.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim took almost instantly to the lean Texan. But the three cowboys
  standing by, apparently like hitching-posts, yet with still eyes and faces,
  gave him an uncomfortable sensation. To be sure, they heard every word. What
  clean-cut, lithe-limbed young men! The one holding the horse had a gun
  hanging low from his belt. Jim faced this triangle of judges, for so they
  seemed, expecting to be introduced. But his uncle apparently neglected or
  avoided it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back to the house,&rdquo; he said, and led Jim away.
  &ldquo;Have a good trip out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet. I&rsquo;ve got a stiff neck from looking out of the car
  window,&rdquo; replied Jim, enthusiastically. &ldquo;No matter what
  you&rsquo;ve read or heard, you can&rsquo;t get any true idea till you
  <i>see</i> it. I mean the plains, hills, valleys, ranges, and mountains... .
  Uncle, I liked all the whole long ride out. But Arizona best.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. Maybe the great red walls&mdash;the
  canyons.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh.... Sorry I didn&rsquo;t meet you at the train. I reckoned I
  would. How&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine and well. Uncle, she was crazy to have me come, but scared
  stiff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good! An&rsquo; how&rsquo;s that storekeeper brother of mine, your
  dad?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been so well lately, but I guess it&rsquo;s nothing
  much. He sent a letter and some things which I have for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he kick about your comin&rsquo; out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. All he kicked about was my making good. He gave me a stiff
  talk, you bet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They reached the house, where Jim was conducted to a large light room,
  with walls and floor of clean yellow pine. A few deerskin rugs, a
  wood-burning stove, a table with lamp, an old bureau and mirror, and spare
  blanketed bed, constituted the contents, the simplicity of which pleased
  Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come out on the porch and we&rsquo;ll talk,&rdquo; his uncle had
  said. And Jim, after securing the letter and parcels he had mentioned,
  hurried out to deliver them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. I&rsquo;ll look at them later.... Wal, Jim, you&rsquo;ve
  growed. You&rsquo;re a pretty husky chap. Too heavy, mebbe, but ridin&rsquo;
  the range will soon change that. By the way, have you been ridin&rsquo; much
  since I saw you last? You used to take to hosses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Had two years of riding every day. You know I tried
  farming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, your dad mentioned it. How&rsquo;d you make out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I fell down, Uncle,&rdquo; replied Jim, regretfully. &ldquo;I just
  couldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; why not?&rdquo; asked Traft, as if he already knew.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, unless it was too tame. Every day the same! I
  thought I&rsquo;d die. But I stuck two years. Then dad sold the farm, which
  was lucky for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What else you been doin&rsquo; these four years since I seen
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was still in school for a year after you last visited us. Then
  the two years on dad&rsquo;s farm. And the last year I tried several jobs,
  only one of which I was any good at.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what was that?&rdquo; asked Traft, kindly. &ldquo;Reckon
  it wasn&rsquo;t clerkin&rsquo; in the store?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m almost ashamed to tell you, Uncle. It was on my own
  hook, though. I got an idea some shade trees would look fine round our place.
  So I drove out to the river and dug up cottonwoods and planted them. Dad
  laughed at me. Then our neighbor hired me to do the same for his place.
  Through that I got other jobs, and I was making good money when your letter
  came.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll be dog-goned!&rdquo; ejaculated the rancher.
  &ldquo;Plantin&rsquo; trees, an&rsquo; cottonwoods at that. Son, it was a
  darn good idee.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim thanked his lucky stars he had confided something he had been afraid
  his uncle would think trivial.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, so much for Missouri,&rdquo; went on Traft.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here in Arizona now. Reckon I might have wrote you all
  about what I want and hope. But it wouldn&rsquo;t have been fair to you or
  me. Fact is I couldn&rsquo;t have said all I need to in a letter. Your dad
  would have throwed a fit. I reckoned it&rsquo;d be better to get face to face
  an&rsquo; have it out. Don&rsquo;t you figger that way, too?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I certainly do, Uncle, especially if it&rsquo;s as big and hard a
  job as I imagine. And if it&rsquo;s really true that you have made me your
  heir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, naturally, all I have would go to your dad an&rsquo; you. But
  that&rsquo;s not the question.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a serious part of it for me,&rdquo; declared Jim,
  bravely. &ldquo;I appreciate your kindness, Uncle Jim, but if I can&rsquo;t
  make good as a rancher&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t want the
  property.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh, I see. Wal, reckon your dad never guessed that.&rdquo; Jim
  felt the piercing intensity of eyes like a pale blue gleam, yet not lacking
  understanding. &ldquo;However, what becomes of my property ain&rsquo;t the
  main issue with me. Blood is thicker than water. An&rsquo; under any
  circumstances I&rsquo;d want my only kin to have what I left.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, Uncle, what is the main issue?&rdquo; queried Jim,
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon it&rsquo;s I want you to be as near a son to me as
  possible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy, Uncle, if it depends on sincerity and affection
  and obedience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll help, but it depends most on what I said in my
  letter. Guts!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember, and that worried me. But I hope I have some.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, the job I want you to take is the hardest in the
  West.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. The harder the better,&rdquo; declared Jim,
  answering the stimulation of doubt. &ldquo;I always told dad that I needed
  responsibility. He never gave me any. The fact that you will put
  responsibility on my shoulders is half of the battle right now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, that&rsquo;s straight talk,&rdquo; returned his uncle, nodding
  his head thoughtfully. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I liked the way you spoke up to Ring
  Locke. If he took a shine to you it&rsquo;d help a lot.... But, Jim, the hell
  of it is no rancher who knows the West ought ever to give a tenderfoot from
  the East such a job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon because of natural human feelin&rsquo;s. But
  I&rsquo;m just bull-headed enough to want a Traft an&rsquo; nobody else to
  take my place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you were a young man, Uncle, could you take care of this
  job?&rdquo; asked Jim, curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. An&rsquo; I reckon I could do it yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; returned Jim, feeling his face blanch.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll commit myself here. I&rsquo;ll <i>do</i> it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine! I like your spirit, son,&rdquo; exclaimed Traft, warmly, and
  a smile transformed his hard lined face. &ldquo;Now listen. I&rsquo;m
  runnin&rsquo; about eight thousand head of cattle, mebbe more. But we can
  never get a count. That&rsquo;s a lot of stock, Jim. Figger out the value at
  forty dollars a head, which is a low estimate. Wal, I lose from a thousand
  head up every year. Most of this loss can be laid to cattle thieves. It has
  gradually growed worse an&rsquo; has begun to rile me. I used to laugh at
  this two-bit rustlin&rsquo;. But it&rsquo;s no good deceivin&rsquo; myself
  any longer. The thing is serious. I&rsquo;ve reason to believe Ring Locke
  knows it&rsquo;s worse than he&rsquo;ll tell me. Anyway, he&rsquo;s the
  best-posted cowman on the range.&mdash;Blodgett runs a big lot of cattle. So
  does Hep Babbitt. They&rsquo;re all losin&rsquo; stock, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Jim, this is bad,&rdquo; declared Jim, in surprise.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost like the rustler stories you told me when I was a
  kid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, if I don&rsquo;t miss my guess you&rsquo;ll shore live one of
  them stories,&rdquo; responded Traft, with a grim laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being robbed, but you don&rsquo;t know where the
  cattle go?&rdquo; queried Jim, ignoring the start his uncle&rsquo;s statement
  gave him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! We know darn well where they&rsquo;re
  goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;South of here, in the brakes under the Diamond. An&rsquo; the
  Diamond, I should explain, is high country south of here. On three sides it
  sheers straight down an&rsquo; cattle can&rsquo;t get off. But on the west,
  for forty miles or so, it slopes off into the roughest canyon country in
  Arizona. Thicker than the Tonto. These canyons head up high in the timber
  an&rsquo; run down deep an&rsquo; rough. All of them have fine grass
  an&rsquo; water. Lots of deer, bear an&rsquo; turkey, too, if you like to
  hunt. Wal, a good deal of stock, especially cows with unbranded calves, drift
  into these draws an&rsquo; work down into the brakes. There the cows are
  killed an&rsquo; the calves stolen. It used to be these thieves would take
  the meat an&rsquo; bury or burn head an&rsquo; hide. But lately they kill too
  many. They just down the cows in a thicket or drag them into one, an&rsquo;
  leave them there for the varmints. Locke&rsquo;s last report shore riled
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, Uncle, this tough job you&rsquo;re giving me has to do with
  the thieves,&rdquo; asserted Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I should sort of smile it does,&rdquo; drawled Traft.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why not intrust it to an experienced Westerner, like
  Locke?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Locke can&rsquo;t bother with it, an&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t if he
  could, at least the way I want to stop it. An&rsquo; as I told you I want a
  Traft to do this. Son, it&rsquo;ll be a big thing for the range, if we
  succeed. I don&rsquo;t want one of these gun-packin&rsquo; cowboys to have
  the credit, when I can throw it to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind, Uncle,&rdquo; said Jim, with a dry humor
  not lost upon Traft. &ldquo;Are you sure anyone but a fool tenderfoot would
  tackle the job?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Traft laughed. He was growing more at ease with Jim. &ldquo;Some of my
  boys are achin&rsquo; to get the job. Jim, my Diamond outfit is the damnest
  bunch of cowpunchers in Arizona. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s this Diamond outfit
  you&rsquo;re to take charge of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damnest bunch! Doesn&rsquo;t sound very good, Uncle. Just what do
  you mean?&rdquo; returned Jim, dubiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Huh! I&rsquo;ll leave that for you to find out.... Now to come out
  with my plan. I want a drift fence built from my ranch here clear down across
  the Diamond to where it jumps off. A hundred-mile fence!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a drift fence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a fence along which cattle will drift south as far
  as they can go, then drift back. It&rsquo;d have several good uses, but the
  main one is to keep the cows an&rsquo; calves from driftin&rsquo; down into
  the brakes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, the building of a fence even a hundred miles long
  oughtn&rsquo;t be so difficult.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore it won&rsquo;t. But keepin&rsquo; it up after it&rsquo;s
  built is where the hell will come in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim grasped subtly that here was the crux of the whole matter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be opposition? Down on the Diamond,&rdquo; he
  rejoined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore will. An&rsquo; for that matter all over the range. Even
  Blodgett is oncertain about fencin&rsquo; the range. You see, a barbed-wire
  fence in this country is nothin&rsquo; short of murder. An&rsquo; these
  nesters an&rsquo; homesteaders an&rsquo; backwoodsmen will lose by it.
  An&rsquo; as for cowboys, Lord! how they hate any kind of a fence! I reckon I
  used to. But I&rsquo;m ahead of my day. I can see what is needed an&rsquo;
  what is comin&rsquo;. So, Jim, you can trust me so far as the benefit to
  ranchers is concerned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle, have you an actual right to fence the range?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, but it&rsquo;s open to question. If it ever went to law
  I&rsquo;d have to prove my contention. An&rsquo; whoever sued me would have
  to show why he was bein&rsquo; hurt. No honest cattleman will ever take such
  action. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m shore doubtful about any of the homesteaders
  goin&rsquo; so far.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Could you prove your contention, which of course is that you are
  being robbed?&rdquo; queried Jim, earnestly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I could, if Ring Locke an&rsquo; some of my cowboys would
  testify. But they hate the idea like sixty. I&rsquo;ll expect you to find out
  what they know, an&rsquo; then add evidence of your own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. So far so good. How about your moral right?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, I&rsquo;m glad you ask that. You&rsquo;re no fool, if you are
  a tenderfoot. The question of moral right is the most puzzlin&rsquo;
  one&mdash;the most open to argument. My own conscience is clear on that. I
  <i>know</i> in the long run the range will benefit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you know? Prove it to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you can see how us big cattlemen will profit by it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s easy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, the little cattlemen will have to stop
  stealin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no more to it, you&rsquo;re absolutely right. But
  won&rsquo;t you close the range or fence off part of it from them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In some sense, yes. But only those draws an&rsquo; canyons I told
  you about. There&rsquo;s shore water an&rsquo; grass enough in them for ten
  times the stock they own. Any one of them will admit that. These honest
  ranchers will just stop appropriatin&rsquo; calves they&rsquo;re not shore
  they own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The really honest fellows do that now?&rdquo; queried Jim, in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore they do, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t hardly think they&rsquo;re
  stealin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; the other kind?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we&rsquo;ll put them up a stump. Some of them will see the
  handwritin&rsquo; on the wall an&rsquo; quit. An&rsquo; others will cut our
  fence an&rsquo; go right ahead stealin&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s where our trouble
  will come in. Mebbe we can stop it in a few years, mebbe not. Some of the
  ranchers here think it&rsquo;ll start a long hard fight. An&rsquo;
  that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re leavin&rsquo; it to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Uncle, what do <i>you</i> think it will lead to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; much compared to what I&rsquo;ve been through. But I
  reckon some fence-cuttin&rsquo; an&rsquo; hard ridin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
  shootin&rsquo; will seem a whole lot to you. Ha! Ha!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very funny,&rdquo; said Jim, soberly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, son, your face was. Don&rsquo;t let my Diamond outfit see you
  look like that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to hide my feelings from them?&rdquo; queried Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. You&rsquo;re not to have any, except gettin&rsquo; mad,
  an&rsquo; when you do that you want to let them see it damn
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! ... Uncle, I can see this is going to be a lovely easy
  job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;d shore please me if you&rsquo;d find it that....
  Jim, I&rsquo;m puttin&rsquo; a lot on you. An&rsquo; I reckon in a way
  it&rsquo;s selfish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; replied Jim, hastily. &ldquo;I
  believe implicitly in you, Uncle Jim. I&rsquo;ll make your ideals and motives
  mine.... Otherwise, I&rsquo;m scared stiff, but I believe I like the tough
  job you&rsquo;ve given me&mdash;if I can only make a go of it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, the best encouragement I can give you is that I like the way
  you face it,&rdquo; returned Traft. &ldquo;Shore it&rsquo;s more than I
  expected, first off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Uncle. That&rsquo;ll help a lot,&rdquo; declared Jim,
  feelingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like some advice, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I never was much on givin&rsquo; advice. Nobody ever follows
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d try. But at least you can tell me what you&rsquo;d do, if
  you had all your knowledge of the range, yet were only my age.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw! That&rsquo;s a stumper. Jim, I reckon I&rsquo;m
  goin&rsquo; to like you, outside of blood relationship. What&rsquo;d I do?
  Wal, let&rsquo;s see.... First off I&rsquo;d go to town an&rsquo; buy the
  best cowboy outfit I could get, an&rsquo; that means saddle, bridle, spurs,
  chaps, sombrero, gun, boots, an&rsquo; so on. That would be for special
  occasions. Then I&rsquo;d wear most the time just plain overalls. I&rsquo;d
  pack the gun an&rsquo; begin to learn to shoot it. I&rsquo;d have a little
  straight talk with the boys who was to work under me an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d let
  them know I was to be boss. I&rsquo;d always do my share of any an&rsquo; all
  kinds of work. I&rsquo;d show a disposition not to give any boy a job I
  wouldn&rsquo;t try to tackle myself. I wouldn&rsquo;t be too nice to take a
  drink, on occasions where it might be wise, but I&rsquo;d leave drink alone.
  Also&mdash;an&rsquo; I hardly need to tell you this&mdash;I&rsquo;d leave the
  town slatterns alone. I&rsquo;d lend my money free, but never my hoss or
  saddle or spurs. I&rsquo;d always stand the brunt of any trouble directed
  against my outfit. That&rsquo;ll be hard, for you&rsquo;ll find each
  an&rsquo; every one of your cowboys keen to do that same thing. Last,
  an&rsquo; I reckon most particular an&rsquo; hard, I&rsquo;d stand up under
  the hell the Westerners will make for a tenderfoot. I&rsquo;d run the
  gauntlet. I&rsquo;d make all the decent fellows like me&mdash;an&rsquo; most
  of them are decent&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d make the others respect
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim had the good humor and the nerve to laugh in his uncle&rsquo;s
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha! Ha! Is <i>that</i> all, Uncle? I thought you were going to
  give me something hard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; declared Traft, gruffly, with a dubious look at his
  nephew, &ldquo;I was a-goin&rsquo; to add somethin&rsquo; that I never could
  do, myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; asked Jim, suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get married pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim whistled. &ldquo;Heavens! I hope you haven&rsquo;t picked out a
  Western girl for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. But I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo; you didn&rsquo;t leave no Eastern
  girl behind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Luckily I didn&rsquo;t, Uncle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, that&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo;. You won&rsquo;t find these
  Western girls special sweet on a tenderfoot. But you&rsquo;re not
  bad-lookin&rsquo;. You shore have prospects, an&rsquo; if you try you might
  win one of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whew!&mdash;Uncle, that&rsquo;s a sticker. I&rsquo;m afraid
  I&rsquo;ll have to jump the traces on that one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, I&rsquo;m onreasonable,&rdquo; said Traft, wistfully.
  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d shore like to hear the laughter of children round this
  ranch-house before I die.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">A WEEK elapsed before the Diamond outfit came in from the
  range.</p>

  <p>Jim made the most of that reprieve. He was up at dawn and did not go to
  bed till late. He went at Ring Locke like a youngster who could not swim in a
  swift current and was going to hold on or die. But Locke seemed only kind and
  aloof. He answered some questions; he never vouchsafed any range lore. Jim
  was sharp enough to find out, however, that Locke had a keen eye for him, and
  this gave him some grain of comfort.</p>

  <p>Apparently his uncle never saw him unless he bumped right into him. Jim
  refused to take all or any of the wonderful horses that were his to own and
  ride. He rode or tried to ride all the mustangs and bronchos about the ranch.
  At first he kept account of the times he got thrown, but he gave this up. He
  certainly did know, however, that he had many bruises and sprains and bumps.
  Moreover, he grew so saddle-sore that it was agony for him to struggle up on
  a horse.</p>

  <p>During this wait he learned every nook and cranny of the ranch, and there
  were a thousand acres and more, including the timber. He could not avoid
  coming into occasional contact with other of his uncle&rsquo;s cowboy
  outfits. And these instances were painful to Jim.</p>

  <p>He found also, on numerous trips into town, where it was impossible to
  keep from meeting people, that he was an object of very great interest to
  everybody, especially the girls and young women. Jim, remembering his
  uncle&rsquo;s wishes, and being far from a hater of the opposite sex, at the
  outset made himself most agreeable. Presently he confined himself merely to
  politeness. The interest he had observed did not extend as far as personal
  propinquity.</p>

  <p>One morning he had returned from a disastrous determination to stick on
  the back of a mustang, and had again taken up a dirty job at the barn, when a
  farmhand approached him with a message: &ldquo;Boss says the Diamond outfit
  is in waitin&rsquo; fer you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim let them wait awhile, until he got himself thoroughly dirty and tired
  and cross. Then he limped round to the bunkhouses. His uncle did not appear
  to be among the bunch of cowboys at the last house. No doubt he had beat a
  hasty retreat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet the old devil is snickering,&rdquo; muttered
  Jim.</p>

  <p>He approached the young men, and before he got even close he saw they
  constituted a remarkable group. They had a singular similarity, and yet upon
  near scrutiny they were not at all alike.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do, boys!&rdquo; he said, bluntly, as he halted before them.
  &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the Diamond outfit I&rsquo;m to boss? ... Well,
  I&rsquo;m not a damn bit gladder to meet you than you are to meet
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Most of them greeted him with a word or nod. Jim found that he had not
  exactly spoken the truth, for he certainly sustained thrills when he looked
  these cowboys over. There did not appear to be one as old as he was, nor, for
  that matter, as big, though several were as tall. Lithe-bodied, long of limb
  and bow-legged, with small round hips and wide shoulders, lean and sharp of
  face, bronzed and sunburnt, with expressionless eyes like gimlets they
  certainly belonged to a striking and unique class.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who was your last foreman?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>

  <p>After quite a long silence one of them replied, &ldquo;Jud
  Blue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he here with you now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon no one has noticed him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if he&rsquo;s where he ought to be he&rsquo;s in hell,&rdquo;
  came the laconic reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; flashed Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jud was shot last month down on the Diamond.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shot! ... Was it an accident?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore was, for him. But whoever did it was lookin&rsquo; pretty
  straight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim did not betray the shock this intelligence gave him, but he certainly
  made note of another circumstance his uncle had not imparted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which one of you has been longest with my uncle?&rdquo; he
  questioned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hump Stevens, heah, was in the first Diamond outfit. Six years ago,
  wasn&rsquo;t it, Hump?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Round aboot thet,&rdquo; drawled a tall tawny cowboy who was
  stoop-shouldered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stevens, then, ought to be foreman of this outfit,&rdquo; returned
  Jim. &ldquo;And after him every one of you according to your service. Well,
  let&rsquo;s understand each other right here. I certainly am not stuck on the
  job and think I&rsquo;m the last fellow on earth to tackle it. But my uncle
  has put it on me. He wants to leave his property to me. And I won&rsquo;t
  have it unless I can deserve it. And that means make good at ranching from
  the ground up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Blank, still faces baffled Jim. It was impossible to tell whether or not
  these cowboys were in the least impressed. They certainly thought he was a
  liar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can lay off till Monday morning,&rdquo; added Jim, curtly. And
  before he started to limp away he gathered that his first order to them had
  been received with a pleasant surprise.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the ensuing hour was the most profoundly thoughtful of any since
  he had decided to embark upon this adventure. What an unknown quantity the
  Diamond outfit! He had needed only one look at these devil-may-care boys to
  realize it. Cowboys were not wholly strangers to him. These, however, were
  the dyed-in-the-wool range product. They were potential chain lightning and
  firebrand. He was conscious of admiration, dread, and an acute desire to make
  friends with them. After meeting them he realized he could not expect any
  material help from Ring Locke or his uncle. The matter was personal.</p>

  <p>Wherefore he carefully kept out of their way for a day and a half. On
  Saturday afternoon he went to town, and he had not been there long before he
  heard that the Diamond outfit was painting some very vivid red. Jim laughed.
  After a while, however, it grew monotonous. And when he happened to encounter
  Miss Blodgett in one of the stores and have her subtly refer to his cowboys
  he became irritated. Must the whole town take up the situation which his
  uncle had precipitated? A second look into Miss Blodgett&rsquo;s hazel eyes
  confirmed the suspicion. She was the nicest of the girls he had met so far, a
  tall, rangy girl who looked like she could ride a horse. She had freckles and
  brown curls and was rather pretty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I met Curly Prentiss in the post-office,&rdquo; she announced,
  after he had greeted her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; asked Jim, though he had an inkling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know Curly yet?&rdquo; she rejoined, merrily.
  &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s one of your Diamonds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see! Fact is I don&rsquo;t know any of them. Was there
  anything particular about your meeting him today?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so very&mdash;for Curly. He used to ride for us. Finest cowboy
  in the world. But when he drinks&mdash;well, his tongue wags.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it wagged about me on this occasion?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It sure did.... Mr. Jim, have you anyone to write home to your
  mother and sister?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim eyed her with misgivings. These Western girls were as deep as the
  cowboys. Jim conceived an idea, however, that Miss Blodgett was friendly, or
  she would never have made that remark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean about the disposition of my remains?&rdquo; rejoined Jim,
  dryly. &ldquo;Thanks, but I&rsquo;m going to see that will not be necessary.
  I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with my new job. In fact, I like the West&mdash;and
  everybody out here. Good afternoon, Miss Blodgett.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And Jim went on, muttering to himself: &ldquo;Dog-gone it! They&rsquo;re
  all after my scalp, even the girls. I hope I&rsquo;m not going to get
  sore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently he went into a pool-room to buy a smoke. The place was fairly
  well crowded, and at the very first table he saw a cowboy he recognized as
  one of his Diamond outfit. He was in the act of making a shot. But he
  straightened up. His fine tanned young face was flushed and there were other
  indications that he had been drinking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I ain&rsquo;t doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said,
  slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who said you were?&rdquo; returned Jim, realizing that he must have
  looked sharply at the boy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; for Curly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jim, suddenly inspired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sheriff Bray just collared Curly. Honest, boss, Curly was
  behavin&rsquo; himself strick proper. But Bray has got it in for us Diamond
  fellars. An&rsquo; Curly&rdquo;&mdash;here the cowboy came round the table to
  be closer to Jim&mdash;&ldquo;Curly was pretty drunk an&rsquo; noisy. It was
  a chance for Bray, who&rsquo;d never had nerve enough any other time. This
  sheriff is a four-flusher, boss. He&rsquo;s never had one of us in jail
  yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which way did they go?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Down the street. The jail&rsquo;s across the tracks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim hurried out and in the direction advised, not certain of his position
  in the matter. Still, he did not take kindly to the idea of one of his
  cowboys going to jail. Moreover, he had met Sheriff Bray and had not been
  greatly impressed in that individual&rsquo;s favor. Jim, while crossing the
  tracks, espied Bray dragging a reluctant and protesting cowboy along the
  station platform, followed by a small crowd. Running ahead, Jim intercepted
  them. This cowboy he also recognized, a tall handsome fellow with curly
  yellow hair, just now very red in the face, but not so drunk as Jim had been
  led to suppose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, Sheriff!&rdquo; called Jim, as he confronted them.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got one of my boys. What&rsquo;s the charge?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; gruffly returned Bray.</p>

  <p>He was a burly man, thick-featured, with a bluish cast of countenance, and
  he wore his sheriff&rsquo;s badge and gun rather prominently. &ldquo;Oh,
  it&rsquo;s young Mr. Traft. I didn&rsquo;t know you.... Wal, this boy was
  gettin&rsquo; a little too obstreperous to suit me. So I&rsquo;m
  runnin&rsquo; him in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Obstreperous! What do you mean by that?&rdquo; demanded Jim,
  arriving at his decision.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thet&rsquo;s what I call it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, what&rsquo;d you do?&rdquo; inquired Jim, of the red-faced,
  blue-eyed boy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I was singin&rsquo;,&rdquo; asserted Curly. &ldquo;This heah
  one-hoss occifer sings in&mdash;choir an&rsquo; he thinks
  he&rsquo;s&mdash;only singer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you can sing in jail,&rdquo; declared the sheriff, with a
  gleam in his eye.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bray, I reckon you&rsquo;d better not run Curly in,&rdquo; said
  Jim, coolly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk along across and get away from this
  crowd. I&rsquo;ll take Curly around the block.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, for a tenderfoot you&rsquo;re startin&rsquo; right in to play
  a high hand,&rdquo; sneered Bray. All the same he had his doubts, which Jim
  was quick to observe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Correct, Bray,&rdquo; rejoined Jim, as he took Curly&rsquo;s arm.
  Between them they walked him away from the curious onlookers, and round a
  corner to the entrance of the jail. Here Curly&rsquo;s face was a study.
  Manifestly before Jim&rsquo;s arrival he had surrendered to the majesty of
  the law, but this amazing champion in the shape of his boss had galvanized
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bray, there ain&rsquo;t none of Diamond outfit ever been&mdash;in
  jail. It&rsquo;s disgrash,&rdquo; he asserted, belligerently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll vouch for him, Sheriff,&rdquo; added Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Prentiss, you come along,&rdquo; ordered Bray, roughly.</p>

  <p>By this time Jim&rsquo;s blood had grown a little hot. He had recalled
  what his uncle had said about Bray and thought he might just as well face the
  issue. He jerked Curly free from the sheriff, and interposed himself between
  them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you had any charge against Curly I wouldn&rsquo;t interfere. But
  you haven&rsquo;t. Why, he isn&rsquo;t half drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrest you both for resistin&rsquo; an officer,&rdquo;
  threatened Bray, his hand going to his hip.</p>

  <p>Jim saw the action, followed it with his eye.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;d throw your gun on us,&rdquo; he said, with
  derision.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, let go an&rsquo; stand aside. This heah ain&rsquo;t funny no
  more,&rdquo; spoke up Curly. The change in him, the ring in his voice, made
  Jim jump, but he did not release the cowboy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Curly, I&rsquo;m responsible here,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

  <p>Bray had subtly altered, which fact Jim grasped to have to do with
  Curly&rsquo;s sudden menace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Traft, I&rsquo;ll let him go in your care,&rdquo; he growled.
  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; you a hunch. Prentiss said somethin&rsquo;.
  This Diamond outfit ain&rsquo;t funny no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bray. I consider that a compliment to me. Come on,
  Curly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim walked the cowboy down the block and up a side street until they got
  out of the center of the town. Neither he nor Curly broke silence during this
  walk. Finally Jim halted on a corner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, will you go back to the ranch? I&rsquo;d go with you, but
  I&rsquo;ve errands to do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, are you orderin&rsquo; me?&rdquo; queried the cowboy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m asking you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then. I&rsquo;ll have to make it an order. Will you go
  now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon. The Diamond ain&rsquo;t disobeyin&rsquo; orders. But
  what&rsquo;d you want to go do this heah trick for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trick? I&rsquo;ve only kept you out of jail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. An&rsquo; the outfit will be sore at me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; protested Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to stand for me bein&rsquo; friends
  with a tenderfoot boss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim began to get a glimmering. The tall cowboy seemed pained over this
  little service. He looked most disapprovingly at Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, you needn&rsquo;t let that embarrass you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Apparently Curly could not help being embarrassed. He wheeled and strode
  away. Half across the street he turned. &ldquo;Boss, I forgot. I&rsquo;m in
  an orful fix,&rdquo; he said, and strode back. &ldquo;My gurl&rsquo;s in
  town. I haven&rsquo;t laid eyes on her for two months. Shore it won&rsquo;t
  be safe to let it go longer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, are you asking me to explain to your girl or to allow you to
  come back to town?&rdquo; queried Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I was just tellin&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I dare say you are in a fix. What do you want of me?&rdquo;
  rejoined Jim, who divined that the cowboy did not like to ask a favor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d never do for you to see Nancy. I lost one gurl that
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, I&rsquo;ll help you out. Promise you&rsquo;ll not take
  another drink today. Then walk out to the ranch and walk back tonight.
  That&rsquo;ll sober you. And you can see your girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Curly swore. He bent a strange blue gaze upon Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon there ain&rsquo;t no help for it,&rdquo; he muttered, as
  if declaring an inevitable fact to himself. Then he strode away.</p>

  <p>Jim scarcely knew how to take this last declaration and he went back
  uptown, pondering over it. These cowboys were certainly going to be problems.
  They were like children. But he had had a most pleasing reaction from his
  first encounter with one of the Diamond outfit.</p>

  <p>Jim returned to his errands, which took him up and down the main
  thoroughfare of Flagerstown, and therefore past the saloons and pool-halls.
  It struck him that the town was growing rather lively as evening approached.
  All the hitching-rails were crowded with saddle-horses, many of which took
  Jim&rsquo;s appreciative eye.</p>

  <p>Jim was entering the hotel, where he expected to meet his uncle and ride
  home with him, when he was detained by another member of the Diamond, who
  barred his way obviously if not rudely. Two other cowboys drew back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mister Traft. I&rsquo;m Hack Jocelyn, an&rsquo;
  I&rsquo;m wantin&rsquo; a word with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was cool, insolent, and something else Jim could not name.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you one of my cowboys?&rdquo; asked Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been ridin&rsquo; with the Diamond, if thet&rsquo;s what
  you mean. But I ain&rsquo;t shore I&rsquo;m stayin&rsquo; with the
  outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim had been told by no less an authority than Ring Locke that horses and
  men could not separate the Diamond outfit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not, eh? Well, you want to be pretty sure, or you
  won&rsquo;t be riding for it. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jocelyn appeared to be gauging Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was in Babbitt&rsquo;s an&rsquo; they told me they&rsquo;d sent
  out a wagon-load of barbed wire to the ranch. Fer the Diamond outfit!
  An&rsquo; I calls him a liar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll have to apologize. It was for the Diamond. And
  there&rsquo;s a carload more ordered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell you say!&rdquo; ejaculated Jocelyn, in amaze and gathering
  anger. &ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s it fer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None of your business, Jocelyn,&rdquo; retorted Jim. &ldquo;If
  you&rsquo;d asked me civilly I&rsquo;d have told you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But barbed wire is most used fer fences!&rdquo; exclaimed the
  cowboy. His two comrades edged closer until they were beside him, watchful,
  hiding their feelings, if they had any. &ldquo;An&rsquo; nobody in
  Gawd&rsquo;s world would reckon the Diamond&rsquo;d have anythin&rsquo; to do
  with thet!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Diamond is in for some new experience, Jocelyn. And you may as
  well know fence-building is one of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw! It shore is. A tenderfoot dude foreman! Then barbed-wire
  fence! My Gawd! what&rsquo;s the range comin&rsquo; to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jocelyn had turned to his companions, to whom, in fact, his exclamation
  had been directed. Jim shot out a hand and spun him around like a top.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you call me a tenderfoot dude foreman?&rdquo; he queried, and
  despite his temper he was quick-witted enough to ascertain that Jocelyn was
  not armed. Otherwise he would wisely have restrained himself altogether.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Mister Traft, I reckon I did,&rdquo; he drawled. He expressed
  the usual cowboy nonchalance, but there was also a vindictive quality in his
  words, if not their content.</p>

  <p>Jim knocked him flat. He had not calculated consequences. In accepting his
  uncle&rsquo;s job he had burned his bridges behind him. But when Jim saw
  Jocelyn lying there, then slowly rising, his hand to his face, which was
  black as a thundercloud, he awoke to another sensation. He would not,
  however, have recalled the blow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn, you&rsquo;re fired,&rdquo; he said, as coolly as the
  cowboy had spoken. &ldquo;But if you come out to the ranch and apologize to
  me I&rsquo;ll take you on again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You better be packin&rsquo; a gun,&rdquo; declared Jocelyn,
  darkly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, shut up, if you can&rsquo;t talk sense,&rdquo; returned Jim, in
  disgust. &ldquo;You insulted me. And if you&rsquo;re not man enough to own up
  to it you can bet there&rsquo;s no place on the Diamond for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jocelyn&rsquo;s two friends laid hold of him and drew him away.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Jim turned to enter the hotel, where among several persons who
  had been spectators of the little byplay were his uncle and Ring Locke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello! Say, I&rsquo;m sorry you happened to see that,&rdquo; said
  Jim, regretfully. &ldquo;But, Uncle, he just made me boil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come inside,&rdquo; rejoined Traft, and when the three of them were
  out of earshot of bystanders he turned to Locke. &ldquo;Ring, he called
  Hack&rsquo;s bluff. An&rsquo; mebbe he didn&rsquo;t poke that puncher&rsquo;s
  snoot! I damn near choked myself to keep from yellin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim, as surprised at this speech as at
  Traft&rsquo;s glee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, the only fault I can locate in you so far is you talk too
  quick an&rsquo; too much. It&rsquo;ll get you in serious trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I nearly burst at that,&rdquo; expostulated Jim.</p>

  <p>Ring Locke shook his lean hawklike head forebodingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s six fer me an&rsquo; half a dozen fer the
  other,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad an&rsquo; good. More good,
  I&rsquo;d say. If the new foreman of the Diamond had stood fer
  that&mdash;wal, he couldn&rsquo;t have had a chance. Mebbe the boys put Hack
  up to it. If so he&rsquo;ll be as nice as pie an&rsquo; come back to square
  himself. If not&mdash;&rdquo; Here Locke shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ring, I&rsquo;ll bet you four bits he&rsquo;ll be out here
  tomorrow,&rdquo; said Traft.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But suppose he doesn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we fill his place?&rdquo; asked Jim, anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. We can&rsquo;t fill the place of any of thet outfit,&rdquo;
  rejoined Locke. &ldquo;But I was thinkin&rsquo; of what it&rsquo;d mean... .
  Young man, this same Hack Jocelyn has shot fellars fer less.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, son,&rdquo; corroborated Traft, somberly.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it. This gang of yours has made way with
  nine men since they rode for me. Six years! Shore some of them were damn good
  riddance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;n nine, boss,&rdquo; corrected Locke. &ldquo;Lonestar
  Holliday got drove out of Texas fer a shootin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; gasped Jim. &ldquo;Those fine clean boys
  murderers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, you&rsquo;re out West now,&rdquo; said his uncle, testily.
  &ldquo;When two men get into an argument or quarrel an&rsquo; draw&mdash;it
  ain&rsquo;t murder if one is killed. We couldn&rsquo;t run the range without
  cowboys an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re shore a tough crowd of young roosters....
  Ring, fetch round the buckboard an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll go home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the way out Traft dilated on the serious and uncertain side of range
  life. Jim realized that his education on the West had but just begun. He had
  not been ignorant of facts, but they seemed vastly significant and perturbing
  at close hand. During the ride out and at supper he maintained silence.
  Later, when he had recovered from the effect of this first clash, he could
  not feel that he would have desired to have met it in any other way. But
  neither his uncle nor Ring Locke could understand his feelings. Jim himself
  found them rather complicated. He had been furious, then frightened, then
  cold. And now, instead of wanting to go home to Missouri, he surrendered
  still more to Arizona.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">LATE on Sunday afternoon, while Jim sat on the porch, his
  uncle called attention to a cowboy approaching from a direction in which he
  could not be seen from the bunkhouses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud Chalfack,&rdquo; anounced Traft, with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Bud?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see pronto. He&rsquo;s the peacemaker of the outfit.
  Bud&rsquo;s a diplomat, the slickest, coolest hand on the range. Whenever
  anyone is in wrong, Bud is elected to set him right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh,&rdquo; returned Jim, dubiously. He watched the cowboy stroll
  up the lane and down the path to the porch. Bud appeared to be a little
  fellow, but sturdy, bow-legged, and otherwise suggestive of long association
  with horses. He was smoking a cigarette, which he threw away as he reached
  the steps. He had an open, guileless countenance and he reminded Jim of a
  rosy-faced cherub.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good evenin&rsquo;, Mr. Traft, an&rsquo; howdy, boss!&rdquo; he
  said, cheerfully. &ldquo;May I set down?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, Bud,&rdquo; replied Traft, genially. &ldquo;Reckon you look
  sort of weak. What ails you? Too much town?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Weak? I couldn&rsquo;t fork a bench at a feast, let alone a hoss.
  We been wrastlin&rsquo; all day with Hack. But you ought to see the other
  fellars. They&rsquo;re laid out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Hack here?&rdquo; asked Jim, quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s down at the bunkhouse. I been sent fer him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come himself?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, fust off he wouldn&rsquo;t come an&rsquo; I reckon now he
  ain&rsquo;t able.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bud&rsquo;s grave infantile face was averted for a moment, during which
  Jim shot a quick glance at his uncle, to be rewarded by a wink. Matters were
  progressing favorably. Jim drew a breath of relief and gave in to the fun of
  the situation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What ails him? Did he get drunk last night? Sick this
  morning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I reckon both. But it ain&rsquo;t them. We was sorta put out
  with Hack. Shore we didn&rsquo;t mean to let him bust up the Diamond.
  An&rsquo; he was daid set on thet. So after arguyin&rsquo; all day we got
  tired, an&rsquo;&mdash;wal, Hack&rsquo;s in bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see. Then he can&rsquo;t come over to apologize and get his job
  back. Or did he want to do it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Hack shore wanted the job back all right, but he hated the
  terms. He said, &lsquo;Jest tell the boss I&rsquo;ll apologize if he&rsquo;ll
  swear I won&rsquo;t have to dig no holes fer fence-posts.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim had difficulty in restraining a shout.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, I&rsquo;m afraid Hack will have to dig holes along with the
  rest of us. I sure expect to,&rdquo; replied Jim, gravely.</p>

  <p>The cowboy looked incredulously to Mr. Traft for corroboration of that
  statement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, it&rsquo;s up to Jim. You&rsquo;ll have to fight it out
  together. You can tell the boys, though, that Jim will not give them
  anythin&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t tackle himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, sir. Thet&rsquo;s shore fairer&rsquo;n any foreman I
  ever rode under.... But Hack won&rsquo;t never dig no fence post-holes. We
  had it out with him an&rsquo; so I may as well tell you. He yells at us,
  &lsquo;Hell! if I gotta dig holes, let &rsquo;em be graves fer thet Cibeque
  bunch of calf thieves.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal!&rdquo; the old rancher exclaimed, and glanced from Bud to see
  how his nephew would take that. Jim did not feel like shouting with laughter
  over it. Nevertheless, he concealed his consternation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, wasn&rsquo;t Hack just raving?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore he was ravin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; he&rsquo;d reason, too. Boss,
  shore your uncle has told you what this drift fence will do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t told me anything,&rdquo; replied Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, some of us will have to, then,&rdquo; said Bud. &ldquo;I
  ain&rsquo;t quite agreed with Hack an&rsquo; the other boys of the Diamond.
  But I&rsquo;ve only been ridin&rsquo; hyar fer a couple of years. Hack swears
  we&rsquo;ll have to fight. He knows Seth Haverly an&rsquo; his outfit of the
  Cibeque. Bad hombres, he called them. An&rsquo; Slinger Dunn don&rsquo;t need
  no introduction &rsquo;round Flag. You can see his trade-mark in more&rsquo;n
  one place.... Some of the boys agree with Hack. We&rsquo;ll have hell
  buildin&rsquo; thet fence, an&rsquo; wuss&rsquo;n hell when we get it
  done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, is the Diamond game to build that drift fence?&rdquo; queried
  Jim, with sarcasm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet your life it is,&rdquo; flashed Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you going to stick together?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we reckon nothin&rsquo; but death can bust the
  outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If I left it to a vote, how many of you would be for building the
  fence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, we&rsquo;ve already voted. This mawnin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; Hack
  was the only fellar to drop a black mark in the hat. Leastways, we think it
  was Hack.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that. Now how do you stand on the moral
  issue?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I don&rsquo;t just savy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all cattlemen in the making. Is it right or
  wrong?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, fact is, we&rsquo;re not all shore. But the most of us believe
  that Mr. Traft knows more an&rsquo; sees farther, an&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t
  never do no homesteader or little cattleman a low-down trick. We&rsquo;re
  goin&rsquo; to believe he&rsquo;s right an&rsquo; stand by him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you all think he shouldn&rsquo;t have saddled this job on to a
  tenderfoot nephew?&rdquo; queried Jim, penetratingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&mdash;I reckon we do,&rdquo; replied Bud, growing red in the
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Jim, triumphantly, to his amused uncle.
  &ldquo;See what you&rsquo;ve done! ... Come, Bud, I&rsquo;ll walk down to the
  bunkhouse with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He found half a dozen of the boys there, but missed Curly Prentiss. Hack
  Jocelyn lay on a bunk under a window, the light of which showed him rather
  badly bruised up. He had one black eye, which he endeavored to hide.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hack, you get your job back, but it was a half-hearted
  apology,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I&rsquo;d never give in but fer this low-down lousy
  outfit,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you
  straight I won&rsquo;t dig no fence-post holes. I&rsquo;ll cut an&rsquo; haul
  posts. I&rsquo;ll cook an&rsquo; wash, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll pack water
  an&rsquo; run errands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hack, you don&rsquo;t look like you were sorry you insulted
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I don&rsquo;t reckon it no insult. I was only bein&rsquo;
  funny. But you shore do wear nice store clothes, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I wear overalls all week and put on clean shirt and
  pants without being a dude?&rdquo; inquired Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it depends on the pants an&rsquo; the shirt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Matter of taste, eh? Well, I&rsquo;ll wear out my St. Louis clothes
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jocelyn peered hard out of his unclosed eye, at this new specimen of range
  foreman, and then gave up with a disgusted grunt.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Next morning before sunrise the Diamond rode out upon their momentous
  adventure. Thirty saddle and pack horses, one four-horse wagon hauling wire
  and tools, and the chuck-wagon, made quite a cavalcade. Ring Locke saw them
  off, but Traft did not show up. Locke&rsquo;s last word was one of
  commendation at Jim&rsquo;s wise move to pitch the first camp five miles out
  of town. Jim intended to drop bales of wire all along the way, then work back
  from camp.</p>

  <p>By the time that camp was pitched Jim imagined he was at the head of the
  weirdest <i>rodeo</i> ever given in the West. But the only argument he had
  was with Curly, who took violent exception to the ragged, bony old mustang
  Jim chose to ride.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you,&rdquo; protested Curly, at length.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll eat out of your hand till he gets a chance to kick your
  brains out. Thet ain&rsquo;t no hoss fer the boss of the Diamond. It&rsquo;s
  an orful disgrace.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to put up with a lot, Curly,&rdquo; said Jim,
  patiently. &ldquo;I can ride this nag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ride him! There ain&rsquo;t no cowpuncher in this outfit who can do
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Curly, I have ridden him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only foolin&rsquo;. Boss, he&rsquo;ll pile you up aboot
  tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim started the work just after the noon hour and it beat any circus he
  ever attended. He dug the first hole himself, with his cowboys gaping
  around.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in satisfaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Whoopee!</i>&rdquo; yelled Hack Jocelyn, in stentorian voice.
  &ldquo;Boys, heah&rsquo;s the grave of the Diamond!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His fellow cowboys whooped so wildly in reply that Jim felt constrained to
  believe Jocelyn&rsquo;s pessimistic augury. Then, under Jim&rsquo;s orders,
  they set to work, and they yelled and swore, and kept up a constant harangue
  with one another. Jim had three of them dragging in long poles, which were
  cut into seven-foot lengths, five feet of which were to stand above ground.
  Jim had thought out his plan and it bade fair to work. Bud Chalback, Lonestar
  Holliday, and Hump Stevens had volunteered to handle the wire, which, next to
  post-hole digging, seemed to be the most obnoxious to these aristocrats of
  the range.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for Jim, it was not necessary to build the drift fence in a
  straight line. A general direction to the south, keeping to levels and the
  easiest way, was the rule. Jim marked the line and the holes for a certain
  distance, then went back to help in all details of the labor. It had happened
  that not so many months ago he had built a barbed-wire fence round his
  father&rsquo;s farm in Missouri. He had not forgotten that. His father had
  not only been an exacting employer, but he knew how to go about
  fence-building. So Jim had a distinct advantage over his cowboys, who
  certainly had never had any share in such work. All the same, they found
  fault with every single detail of Jim&rsquo;s plan and execution, sometimes
  so guilelessly and with such apparent sincerity that he knew they had begun
  their mischief. He took especial care, however, in every instance to explain
  and prove to them the fallacy of their criticisms. Here was too good a chance
  to miss.</p>

  <p>The first day ended, and a dirty, sweaty, hungry string of cowboys walked
  back to camp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d a thunk it? Hoofin&rsquo; it to camp! As if
  barbed-wire-fence buildin&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t enough. Boys, we&rsquo;d be
  better off in the pen at Yuma,&rdquo; declared Cherry Winters, throwing his
  sombrero.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a helluva good thing none of us has to cook on this
  job,&rdquo; said Uphill Frost. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve all got to thank the boss
  fer thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Up,&rdquo; replied some one, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d liefer you was
  the cook, &rsquo;cause then we&rsquo;d soon be daid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look aheah, Jackson Way,&rdquo; retorted Frost. &ldquo;You
  hungry-lookin&rsquo; jack rabbit! I kin beat you makin&rsquo; sourdough
  biscuits any day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore you can. I ain&rsquo;t no cook.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And so the badinage went on. Jim shut his ears when he was a little way
  off, to avoid hearing their facetious remarks about him, but on occasions he
  caught some of it.</p>

  <p>The amazing day ended with Jim&rsquo;s adding a lame back and blistered
  hands to his other ills. They had camped in the open field, where a few
  straggling pines had escaped the lumbermen, and the site was far from pretty.
  Jim unrolled his tarpaulin under one of them. He had never slept out in the
  open in his life. The cowboys would have laughed if they had seen him in his
  room at the ranch-house, struggling over the rolling and roping of that
  bed.</p>

  <p>The cook had been highly recommended to Jim, by no less a person than
  himself, and that, too, in writing. He claimed to hear fairly well, but he
  was dumb. Shot in the throat once, by a vicious cowboy!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, when is thet cadiverous galoot a-goin&rsquo; to yell,
  &lsquo;Come an&rsquo; get it&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded Hack.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anybody know what his handle is?&rdquo; asked another.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, our cook&rsquo;s name is Jeff Davis,&rdquo; announced Jim,
  importantly. &ldquo;He hails from Alabama. He can&rsquo;t talk, but he wrote
  he could hear fairly well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why cain&rsquo;t he talk?&rdquo; asked Hack.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A dumb cook! Holy Jupiter! We&rsquo;re Jonahed fer
  keeps!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine. He cain&rsquo;t cuss the daylights out of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if he can cook&mdash;O-Kay!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s enough rebels in this heah outfit now without
  havin&rsquo; a rebel cook,&rdquo; growled another.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; added Jim, by way of answer to all these remarks,
  &ldquo;Jeff claims to have been shot in the throat by a vicious cowboy. Made
  dumb forever. Think of it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, he might have been one of these fellars who talk too
  much,&rdquo; declared Hack, significantly.</p>

  <p>The sudden and violent beating of a tin pan appeared to be Jeff&rsquo;s
  call to supper.</p>

  <p>Uphill Frost, who had fallen into a doze, leaped up with a yell,
  &ldquo;Injuns!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was the last to reach the chuck-wagon, perhaps by the fraction of a
  second. The things they said to the grave-faced cook, as he filled their
  plates and cups, were enough, Jim thought, to make a dumb man swear. Probably
  he alone caught a curious little gleam in Jeff&rsquo;s deep-set eyes. That
  gave Jim food for thought. Then the members of the Diamond stood around, or
  sat cross-legged like Indians on the ground. The ensuing silence fell like a
  mantle. It seemed so beneficent and wonderful that Jim imagined he had been
  suddenly transported to another world.</p>

  <p>After supper they had a camp fire around which they sat and smoked. Jim
  enjoyed that hour. The infinite and various moods of the cowboys seemed to
  have flagged. Then one by one they, some without removing their boots, rolled
  in their tarpaulins. Jim took off some of his clothes, and when he stretched
  out in his bed with a groan he felt that he would never move again. How
  delicious that bed! He burned and ached all over, and tired as he was could
  not soon go to sleep. The canopy of white stars seemed so wonderful and
  strange. The air, which had turned cold with the night wind down off the
  mountain, blew over his face. Jim had heard his first coyote chorus at the
  ranch, so he was in a way prepared for another at close range. Evidently this
  visiting bunch sat round in a half-circle, just behind his bed, and barked,
  yelped, whined their wild concatenations. He enjoyed the music for a while,
  but he conceived that he might have a murderous instinct develop.</p>

  <p>He endeavored to enumerate the especial happenings and remarks of the day.
  Impossible! It had been his intention to keep a diary. He did not think he
  could do the opportunity justice, though he would try. Besides, it would
  never do to record many of the speeches of these range-riders.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he felt something tugging at the back of his bed, at the blankets
  under him. It made him start violently and instinctively frightened him. A
  coyote! Did the scavengering beggars steal that close? He yelled with much
  meaning but poor articulation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;GIOUT!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then he popped up. He could see a few feet back of his bed. Nothing there!
  Perhaps it might have been a gopher or a rattlesnake about which the boys had
  remarked after supper. With a boot he beat around back of his coat, which he
  had folded up for a pillow. Then with a still shaking hand he felt back
  there. And it came in contact with a rope. It had been tied to an end of the
  blanket over him, and this had been drawn half off. &ldquo;Well, by
  gosh!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

  <p>From all around strange sounds arose. He sat there amazed until he grasped
  the situation. The cowboys had played their first trick on him and were now
  trying to hold in a fiendish and bursting glee. Presently from way over near
  the chuck-wagon broke out a raucous: &ldquo;Haw! Haw! Haw!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim untied the rope and flung the end as far away as he could.
  Sons-of-guns, he called them to himself! But nevertheless, he was tickled.
  They would make life miserable for him. Nevertheless, he took this as an
  augury of good luck. His uncle had assured him that if they played tricks on
  him there was hope. If they suffered him in silence and let him severely
  alone the case was hopeless. Jim lay back happy, despite his chagrin at being
  scared half out of his wits, and went to sleep.</p>

  <p>Next morning he hobbled around cheerfully without mentioning the incident
  and went to work. That turned out to be a trying day, particularly in keeping
  at it. Upon returning to camp he washed his blistered hands, and then
  thinking to rest a little before supper, he sought his bed.</p>

  <p>But it was gone. At first he imagined he had mistaken the place, but he
  soon reassured himself that he was right about the location. After a few
  moments he discovered his bed-roll high up in the pine tree, swinging by the
  rope. Jim swore under his breath. If he had to climb that tree, crippled as
  he was, it would afford these devilish cowboys a treat. He just would not
  attempt it. They stood and sat around, waiting for call to supper, and
  obviously they were aware of his predicament</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, were I a little bir-r-rd,&rdquo; sang one of them.</p>

  <p>Jim decided he would make one gigantic bluff. He had been pretty lucky so
  far. Why not play that to the limit? Whereupon he went to his pack, and
  taking up his Colt, he aimed steadily at the rope above his head and shot. He
  cut the rope. As he gasped, the bed-roll fell with a heavy thump. Jim flipped
  the gun in a way he had learned through a week&rsquo;s practice, and
  carelessly tossed it over to his pack. Then approaching the cowboys he said,
  seriously, &ldquo;I sure hope none of you hombres make me throw a gun on
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They seemed to be a wide-eyed and stricken group.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I shore ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to do thet little
  thing,&rdquo; spoke up Curly.</p>

  <p>So they had to score another for the tenderfoot. That night around the
  camp fire they were thoughtful, and whispered behind Jim&rsquo;s back. He
  went to bed knowing the war was on, and that he was in for utter rout. Ring
  Locke had said cowboys when pressed would do anything under the sun. Jim had
  thought it all out, and he could only regulate his conduct according to
  theirs. The main issue for him was to earn their respect.</p>

  <p>Nothing happened that night nor the next day, but on the following night
  he was awakened by a terrible crash and jar. He lay there shaking. The stars
  above showed more numerously. The pine tree must have been struck by
  lightning, for its branches no longer sheltered him. It had fallen. But there
  could not have been a stroke of lightning, because the sky gave no sign at
  all of storm. The cowboys had provided the lightning. Probably they had sawed
  the tree nearly through during the day, when he was absent, and at night they
  had pulled it down. The tips of one of the branches lay across Jim&rsquo;s
  feet, which he moved after some effort. Nice gentle cowboys! Not for a long
  while did Jim go to sleep, after that.</p>

  <p>By the end of the week they had finished the drift fence townward to where
  it joined Traft&rsquo;s ranch. They had also about finished Jim. Saturday
  night he spent alone in camp, except for the cook, who plainly showed a
  solicitude for Jim. Sunday he was to have gone in to see Uncle Jim, but he
  never left the camp. Late afternoon the cowboys began to straggle back in
  twos and threes, some of them still pretty drunk. Jim resented that. He
  watched them come, careful to see who were the sober ones. Bud returned,
  holding Hack Jocelyn in his saddle; and Curly performed a like office for
  Cherry Winters. Drink manifestly was Hack&rsquo;s besetting sin, for he
  presented a somber and ugly figure. On the other hand, Cherry was funny.
  Curly handled him roughly, even to tripping him up twice; still in spite of
  it Cherry succeeded in getting to Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bosh, ish all ri&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, waving a deprecatory hand.
  &ldquo;Be&rsquo;n lookin&rsquo; at redeyes, but I&rsquo;m sober&rsquo;s
  jedge. An&rsquo; I wanna tell you. Lash night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Curly dragged him away. At sunset Jim took a long walk, which in a way
  mitigated his mood. The supper gong recalled him. As he neared camp his keen
  ears caught Curly saying: &ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s shore eatin&rsquo; into my
  gizzard. I reckon he&rsquo;s pretty decent, considerin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, somethin&rsquo; shore is eatin&rsquo; you,&rdquo; returned
  Hack Jocelyn, sarcastically. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got no kick comin&rsquo;.
  Ain&rsquo;t we buildin&rsquo; this drift fence? What the hell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim wondered if this talk referred to him or his uncle, and after a
  moment&rsquo;s consideration decided it was about himself. Curly, then, as
  Jim had grasped before, was leaning a little toward championing him. It was
  the one bright spot in a gloomy week-end.</p>

  <p>On Monday at dawn they broke camp and drove south to the edge of the
  timber, perhaps another five miles. Here the camp site delighted Jim. It was
  on a grassy bench just where the pines began, and near a beautiful spring.
  The bare despoiled land they had traversed was no longer visible. This drive,
  of course, included the dropping of bales of wire along the way; and that,
  with the unpacking and making camp, constituted the day&rsquo;s work.</p>

  <p>At this camp matters came to a pass where Jim grew beside himself with
  rage. And the incident that capped the climax was where Curly Prentiss, after
  gradually and perceptibly leaning toward friendship for Jim, suddenly became
  alienated. Jim laid this to influence of a clique of four in the Diamond
  outfit, the ringleader being Hack Jocelyn. And it happened that Jim had begun
  to need some little evidence of reward for his unswerving patience and
  endurance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a saffron streak as
  wide as the road.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, is thet thar relatin&rsquo; to my work on this heah drift
  fence?&rdquo; queried Prentiss, with keen glance on two of the cowboys who
  certainly heard Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m bound to admit you do more than your share,&rdquo;
  rejoined Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, then, I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; your remark as personal,
  an&rsquo; if <i>you</i> ain&rsquo;t just as yellow you&rsquo;ll step out with
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, Curly!&rdquo; ejaculated Jim, wearily. &ldquo;You
  wouldn&rsquo;t make it a matter of guns?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, in this heah country a man has to protect himself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. And how in the hell am I to protect myself from most of this
  devilish bunch without a friend?&rdquo; queried Jim, bitterly.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been banking on you right along. You have helped me a good
  deal, though you may not know it. I like you. And I swear you were beginning
  to like me. Then all of a sudden you turn cold and mean.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you called me saffron?&rdquo; asked Prentiss,
  with curious little flecks of light in his eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, the outfit put it up to me this heah way. They accused me of
  bein&rsquo; friends with you. An&rsquo; they made me cut the deck. You or the
  Diamond.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So that is it,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;I never thought of that.
  Naturally you&rsquo;d stick to them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m demandin&rsquo; an apology before the
  outfit,&rdquo; said Curly, with the air of one who held a whip hand.</p>

  <p>It was on Jim&rsquo;s lips, of course, to beg Curly&rsquo;s pardon, when
  something perverse prompted him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose I won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, then, as you cain&rsquo;t stand fer a little gun-play,
  I&rsquo;ll have to lick you,&rdquo; drawled Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll <i>have</i> to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, you couldn&rsquo;t do that if you tried it every day we are
  building this fence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This retort, as amazing to Jim as to Curly, came out of the past days of
  Jim&rsquo;s turmoil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister Traft, I&rsquo;m shore differin&rsquo; with you. An&rsquo;
  I&rsquo;ll show you pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get the apology over first,&rdquo; replied Jim,
  dryly.</p>

  <p>It happened to be just before supper-time and all the boys were there. Jim
  did not require to be told that they had heard about what he had called
  Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fellows, I&rsquo;ve a word to say,&rdquo; he began, and the slow
  sly glances he drew made him want to swear at them. &ldquo;I want to
  apologize to Curly before you all. I told him he had a streak of saffron.
  Well, I take it back. And instead of Curly I&rsquo;ll apply it to those of
  you who made Curly turn me down. I don&rsquo;t know who they are, but you
  know. It is pretty low down. This rotten job I&rsquo;ve tackled for my uncle
  has got on my nerves. There&rsquo;s so much I don&rsquo;t know. Curly or any
  one of you could help me. I think he was leaning that way. But you made him
  quit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Jim turned to Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, Mister Prentiss. You politely invited me to a gun party, and
  then threatened to lick me. But neither of these made me apologize to you. It
  was because I had done you an injustice. Now I&rsquo;ll tell you some more
  before your grinning-ape pards. You can&rsquo;t lick me. And unless you make
  a blamed good stab at it right here and now I <i>will</i> say you&rsquo;re
  yellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Curly&rsquo;s face was more of a study than that of his allies, which
  certainly presented a good deal in puzzles. But presently at the prospect of
  a fight long deferred they began to beam.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I reckon your uncle will&mdash;&rdquo; began Bud,
  conscience-stricken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shet-up, you durn little crow!&rdquo; bawled somebody, presumably
  Hack.</p>

  <p>Lonestar Holliday burst into the circle. &ldquo;Fellars, heah comes thet
  Slinger Dunn,&rdquo; he whispered, warningly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">TWO riders had come out of the woods. They were not cowboys,
  yet Jim could not in a glance determine why he made that distinction. Had it
  not been for Lonestar Holliday&rsquo;s announcement and its instant and
  singular effect upon his comrades, Jim would not have made anything unusual
  about a visit from strange riders. That had already happened. Nevertheless,
  as the former horseman halted, Jim modified this opinion.</p>

  <p>The rider looked like an Indian, yet his skin was dark bronze instead of
  red. His features were shadowed by the brim of an old black sombrero, yet
  piercing eyes shone out of that obscurity. He wore a buckskin shirt, much the
  worse for long usage. The rest of his apparel corresponded with any
  cowboy&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>The second stranger was a lean-faced, hard-lipped young man, with eyes
  that appeared to oscillate like a compass needle.</p>

  <p>Both were mounted on long-haired, ragged, wild-looking horses. The saddles
  were superb, with long <i>tapa dores</i>. Rifles were slung in saddle
  sheaths.</p>

  <p>The foremost of these two riders did not greet the Diamond, individually
  or collectively. And Jim, quick to note this and that none of his men spoke,
  waived any sort of greeting himself. But he stepped out in front with an air
  of authority. This placed him somewhat closer to the rider, in a better
  light, and he looked up into a handsome, still, strange face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You the new boss of this heah Diamond outfit, hey?&rdquo; inquired
  the rider, in cool hostility.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m supposed to be,&rdquo; replied Jim, just as
  coolly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young Traft, from Mizzourie?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;James Traft,&rdquo; corrected Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Mister Traft! I shore am glad to meet you,&rdquo; drawled
  the rider, without any intimation that he intended to reveal his own
  name.</p>

  <p>Presently Jim replied. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t return the compliment if you
  don&rsquo;t say who you are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Holliday took a couple of slow steps, which placed him beside Jim, an
  action that somehow thrilled Jim, though he might have misunderstood its
  significance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, it&rsquo;s Slinger Dunn an&rsquo; his pard, Seth Haverly,
  from the Cibeque,&rdquo; said Holliday, crisply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Lonestar,&rdquo; returned Dunn.</p>

  <p>It was noticeable that Holliday had no more to say. But Jim greeted the
  visitors and asked them to get down and stay for supper.</p>

  <p>Dunn might not have heard, for all the sign he gave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, ain&rsquo;t you buildin&rsquo; sort of a long fence?&rdquo; he
  queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s getting pretty long,&rdquo; replied Jim, with a
  laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long&rsquo;s it goin&rsquo; to be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hundred miles, the cowboys say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t say! ... Thet&rsquo;s purty long. An&rsquo;
  barb-wire, too. What kind of a fence is this heah goin&rsquo; to
  be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A drift fence to hold cattle, Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; returned Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idee&mdash;a drift fence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you suppose?&rdquo; counter-queried Jim, just as curtly.
  Then he gazed up into burning eyes that positively gave him a shock.</p>

  <p>The second rider came up. &ldquo;Arch, let&rsquo;s be goin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
  he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I suppose a lot. But I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; questions,&rdquo;
  went on Dunn. &ldquo;This heah fence is ole Jim Traft&rsquo;s
  idee?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly it is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does he own the land?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he aimin&rsquo; to fence free range?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will divide the range, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, along heah it won&rsquo;t make no difference to nobody. But
  when it gets down in the Diamond it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be a bad deal for
  cattlemen in the brakes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told, Mr. Dunn,&rdquo; rejoined Jim.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just beginning to learn the cattle business, and can&rsquo;t
  say one way or the other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon you won&rsquo;t go far,&rdquo; replied the other,
  meaningly, and he rolled a cigarette without ever taking his gleaming eyes
  off Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo; let&rsquo;s rustle out of this,&rdquo;
  interposed Haverly, reaching over to give Dunn a jerk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the end of the Diamond with this drift
  fence,&rdquo; averred Jim. &ldquo;And after it is finished my outfit will see
  that it stays up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your outfit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, mister, you cain&rsquo;t have it in your haid thet your
  Diamond outfit will stick to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that notion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;re plumb off the trail. Even down in the brakes we
  heah what Jocelyn thinks of you. An&rsquo; Cherry Winters. An&rsquo; Uphill
  Frost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to admit that some of my men ridicule me,&rdquo;
  said Jim, feelingly. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s deserved, for I sure am a
  tenderfoot. But all the same the drift fence goes up and <i>stays</i> up, if
  it takes half a dozen Diamond outfits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dunn poised his cigarette, arrested by a speech that evidently struck
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traft, no drift fence will ever stay up in Cibeque County,&rdquo;
  he returned, presently, with grim passion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen. Thanks for giving me a hunch. And now,
  since you&rsquo;re neither polite nor agreeable, will you please mozey on out
  of my camp?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dunn&rsquo;s face showed the darker for a wave of blood. His companion
  roughly seized him, nearly unseating him from the saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger, I shore ain&rsquo;t waitin&rsquo; to be ordered out of no
  tenderfoot&rsquo;s camp,&rdquo; he said, gruffly, dragging at Dunn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a little late,&rdquo; put in Jim, with sarcasm.
  &ldquo;My invitation included you. Now I say to both of you&mdash;<i>get
  out!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The instant Jim had delivered this contemptuous order he realized he had
  done something terrible. Not only Dunn&rsquo;s aspect, but Jim&rsquo;s men
  appeared to freeze. Jim had never seen such a blazing hell in human eyes as
  he encountered in Dunn&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>Haverly reached down, and grasping the bit of Dunn&rsquo;s horse wheeled
  it and the rider away. Dunn could be heard cursing his comrade and getting
  roundly cursed in return. They were watched out of sight into the woods.</p>

  <p>Jim turned to his men. As he did so he observed Curly Prentiss move his
  right hand, containing a cocked gun, from behind his back. This revealed to
  Jim more of the nature of this encounter with the two riders from the
  Cibeque, but it in no wise mitigated his temper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of you men,&rdquo; he said, with a ring in
  his voice. &ldquo;If I told my uncle about this he&rsquo;d fire every last
  one of you. You may be the great Diamond outfit, but to me you&rsquo;re a lot
  of four-flushers. What the hell do I know about Slinger Dunn and his kind?
  Some of you might have chipped in and stood by me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I reckon we stood by you without you knowin&rsquo; it,&rdquo;
  declared Curly Prentiss. &ldquo;You were doin&rsquo; the talkin&rsquo;.
  An&rsquo; if we&rsquo;d chipped in there would have been gun-play.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly&rsquo;s right, boss,&rdquo; added Lonestar Holliday. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t know if Dunn seen Curly slip his gun out. But I reckon he did, as
  he was shore civil for him. This Slinger Dunn has a bad rep. He&rsquo;s
  killed several men an&rsquo; shot up more&rsquo;n you could count.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I&rsquo;ll chip in a word,&rdquo; said Hack Jocelyn.
  &ldquo;It shore was nervy of you to fire Dunn out of our camp. If you
  hadn&rsquo;t been a tenderfoot you&rsquo;d never have done it. You want to
  look out for Slinger Dunn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, I&rsquo;m not afraid of him, even if he is a
  gun-slinger,&rdquo; declared Jim, passionately. &ldquo;How do I know it
  wasn&rsquo;t another trick, hatched by some of you? You may think
  you&rsquo;re having fun at my expense. Perhaps you are. But there ought to be
  a limit. You&rsquo;re such awful liars I can&rsquo;t believe one word you
  say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, are you callin&rsquo; us liars?&rdquo; inquired Curly, in a
  queer tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon I am. Damn liars! You&rsquo;re more. You&rsquo;re a flock
  of swell-headed, cross-grained, cantankerous cowboys. Now put that in your
  cigarettes and smoke it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At least for once Jim silenced them. He had no idea of the magnitude of
  his offense and he did not care. He had been frightened, and if anger had not
  come to his rescue he would have betrayed it. That would be the finish. He
  had vowed he would never let any of this famed Diamond outfit see him scared.
  At that juncture Jeff called them to supper, but Jim stalked off into the
  woods and walked under the dark pines. He recovered from his fit of temper,
  but not from the sense of disaster that had slowly accumulated. This task he
  had undertaken seemed well nigh impossible. At length, gloomy and troubled,
  he stalked back to camp and to bed.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Next day the stretching of wire fence went on, and now with a remarkable
  celerity, compared with that done in the open country. The strands of wire
  were nailed upon trees, and seldom had a post-hole to be dug. Perhaps this
  had a cheering effect upon the members of the Diamond, but Jim regarded their
  attempts at approaching him, their sudden solicitude, their amazing
  amiability, with suspicion. He was right, too, for that night, when he opened
  his bed-roll he found the blankets soaked. Some one had poured a bucketful of
  cold spring water into one end of the roll. Jim pondered over this mean
  trick. Oh, he would get even, but what ought he do on the moment? He could
  strip a blanket off every one of his men and by so doing catch the guilty
  party. But he decided against that course of procedure. Instead he built a
  roaring fire, so hot that he almost roasted the boys alive before they could
  awake and move back in the woods. Such profanity! Jim had heard a little on
  the docks at St. Louis, but it could not hold a candle to this. He took half
  the night to dry his blankets, knowing, of course, that a huge fire would
  keep his men awake. Then he went to bed, and in the darkness before dawn he
  crawled out to yell words he had heard them often use:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;THE DAY&rsquo;S BUSTED! ROLL OUT!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That day and another passed. The camp was moved ten miles down in the
  woods, into a wide pleasant draw where a creek ran, and wild turkeys gave Jim
  a thrill. The wagon had to go into Flagerstown for more wire, and the driver
  returned with a note from Traft, asking Jim why he had not been in to the
  ranch to report. Jim never answered it, nor did he ride in. Another week-end
  went by, including Sunday, when Jim was left in peace.</p>

  <p>He was nearing the end of his rope now. As the days passed and the drift
  fence lengthened, these incomprehensible cowboys of the Diamond outfit were
  driving Jim to distraction. They meant to break him. They were going to. No
  tenderfoot out of Missouri could ever run the Diamond! So Jim had
  overheard.</p>

  <p>They were bewildering in the infinite variety of their attacks, and he was
  almost helpless because he knew so little of the West, and horses, and of the
  nature of cowboys. To him they seemed inhuman&mdash;cool, still-faced or
  smiling devils, hiding their sincerity, if they had any, possessed of a
  fiendish desire to nag him, worry him, inconvenience him, make him
  acknowledge defeat.</p>

  <p>On Monday the wire-wagon went on ahead, along a line Jim had blazed on
  Sunday, and dropped its load, then went back to town for another,
  necessitating now a trip of three days.</p>

  <p>Jim, driving the men hard that week, reached the end of the blazed line
  before the wagon returned. There was a wide deep ravine that had to be
  crossed. The country was growing rougher.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; said Bud, that morning, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lot of
  bales of wire been rolled down in the draw.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The rest of the outfit whooped, but Jim could not tell whether it was from
  resentment or satisfaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who rolled them?&rdquo; he roared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;n&rsquo;ll do I know?&rdquo; retorted Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Another funny trick!&rdquo; ejaculated Jim. And he walked on along
  the line to the ravine. There far down at the bottom he espied a dozen or
  more bales lying scattered about.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go down and pack them up,&rdquo; ordered Jim to his men, who had
  followed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Wha&mdash;at?</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up thet hill on foot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One and all they sat down in the shade, to begin rolling cigarettes. When
  Jim swore at them they smiled in the slow, cool way that always infuriated
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he fumed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pack them up
  myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He strode down the slope, which he found steeper and longer than it had
  appeared at first glance. Like a toy he handled a bale of wire. Jim was
  powerful. He could throw a sack of grain or a barrel up into a wagon.
  However, by the time he had packed that bale up the hill he knew what a heavy
  load was. He had bitten off more than he could chew. But with those intent
  eyes on him so watchfully, he could not quit. He went down again, and this
  time was careful to zigzag up the steep slope. It took him two hours of the
  most trying toil to finish the job. Then, hot as fire, and wringing wet with
  sweat, he panted at the silent cowboys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;if you&rsquo;re rested&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go on&mdash;with
  the fence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, we was just waitin&rsquo; to see how soon you&rsquo;d think
  of gettin&rsquo; a pack-hoss fer thet job,&rdquo; observed Hump Stephens,
  amiably.</p>

  <p>For Jim to realize how again, for the thousandth time, he had showed how
  utterly unfit he was to be foreman of the Diamond, did not improve his mood.
  He worked off the mood at length, as he invariably succeeded in doing, just
  as if he did not know another would soon be imposed upon him.</p>

  <p>It was Curly Prentiss who discovered horse tracks along the line, and he
  showed them to Jim, no doubt in the interest of himself and companions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fresh tracks, an&rsquo; unshod horses at thet,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Reckon we can lay it to some of the Cibeque outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I accused you fellows,&rdquo; he replied,
  regretfully. No matter what he did or said now, it was wrong.</p>

  <p>Friday, at the lunch hour, Bud Chalfack approached Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; fer the outfit,&rdquo; he announced.
  &ldquo;We figger thet we&rsquo;re aboot up on this week&rsquo;s work,
  an&rsquo; we want this afternoon an&rsquo; tomorrow off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; queried Jim, in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We want to ride in today. There&rsquo;s a fair on in Flag,
  an&rsquo; tomorrow&rsquo;s <i>rodeo</i> day. Most of us are
  entered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t stop our fence-building to go to
  <i>rodeos</i>,&rdquo; protested Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore we can. We-all cain&rsquo;t see any hurry aboot the fence.
  An&rsquo; when the Fourth comes we&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;way down too far to
  ride in. So we want to have a chanct at this <i>rodeo</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim actually could not decide whether this was insubordination or the
  legitimate claim of a cowboy. He felt helpless. If he refused they would go,
  anyhow. If he gave his consent it might well be that they had him
  &ldquo;buffaloed,&rdquo; as Curly had been overheard to say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, you go on your own hook,&rdquo; he said to Bud.</p>

  <p>They rode off, a gay and superb group of young riders, who made his heart
  swell with pride and yet saddened it with the thought that he never could be
  received by them. Why had they not asked him to go with them? He would have
  been delighted. He had never seen a <i>rodeo</i>. But they did not want him;
  they were ashamed of their tenderfoot foreman.</p>

  <p>After they had gone, Jim strode off toward the woods. He was astounded to
  hear Jeff Davis call.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, you oughtn&rsquo;t go out alone. But if you must go, take a
  rifle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim did not answer, though he was grateful to Jeff. The cook, then, had
  perpetrated a hoax on the Diamond. He was not dumb. And it was a sure bet
  that neither was he slightly deaf, as he had claimed. Here would be one on
  the cowboys, presently. Jim assured himself that he would not betray Jeff. He
  did not, however, take the latter&rsquo;s advice, but went on into the forest
  alone and unarmed.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to feel a strange solace or help or something in the deep
  solitude of the woodland. It was early summer now. The ferns and wild flowers
  were springing up along the brown aisles. His step made not the slightest
  noise. He saw squirrels and birds, and once, gray vanishing forms that might
  have been deer. Huge cliffs festooned with moss and vines, from which dripped
  water, arrested him in his walk. There was a pleasant low sough of wind in
  the tree tops. If anything could have spurred his flagging spirits, the
  sweetness and loneliness of this forest would have done so. But he guessed he
  was about beaten. And that confession, gaining audible admission into his
  consciousness, could not be dislodged.</p>

  <p>The afternoon passed, and he returned to camp, there to eat supper in
  silence, without appearing to remember that the cook had spoken to him. He
  slept well, but in the morning the old bitterness and hopelessness assailed
  him again. An impulse to ride to town seized him, and straightway he acted
  upon it. He did not quite acknowledge to himself that this was a signal of
  defeat, but it would probably come out when he faced his uncle.</p>

  <p>He reached home about noon, to ascertain that his uncle was at the fair.
  Jim rode out there, and walked his horse. What a vacillating jackass he was!
  It would hurt Uncle Jim to find him a quitter. Ought he not to try again?
  Weary and distressed, he entered the fairground; and espying a gayly
  decorated booth advertising lunch, he dismounted and approached the counter.
  He gave an order to a girl behind. When he was about through he happened to
  look up, to see a pair of gold-brown eyes upon him.</p>

  <p>And they wrenched out of him the query, &ldquo;What would you do if you
  were about licked?&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <p>It was when the girl had finally said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d get up an&rsquo;
  fight some more!&rdquo; that Jim really looked at her with seeing eyes. If
  her spirited reply had stirred him, what more did the toss of her pretty dark
  head, with its glints of gold. She was a little girl, very young, and she
  wore a dainty blue dress. Still, there were contours under it that betrayed
  womanhood. She had a small, oval, almost dusky face. Her hands were small and
  brown, yet they struck him as strong and capable. She was Western, of course,
  but she was a little lady of quality. He kept talking, scarcely with any idea
  of what he was saying. And that suddenly betrayed to him a swift and
  remarkable interest in her. After that he knew what he was saying to her, and
  every word added to a realization of charm. By the time he had found out she
  did not have a best fellow he seemed far on a strange new adventure; and when
  he rode away toward the stands, with her shy half-promise of a dance that
  night, he changed his mind about his mission to Flagerstown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
  get up an&rsquo; fight some more!&rdquo; She had looked it, too. What a sweet
  and fiery little girl! Evidently she had taken it for granted that he had
  been knocked down. Well, he had been. But he had gotten up. And he would act
  precisely and indomitably upon her advice. Fight! He would whip each and
  every one of that Diamond outfit.</p>

  <p>He gave his horse to a boy at the stalls, and went round to the stand,
  where he soon found his uncle, and was welcomed in a way that made him
  ashamed. It pleased his uncle that he had come to town in his work
  clothes.</p>

  <p>The <i>rodeo</i> was on. And Jim sat enthralled. &ldquo;The Diamond bunch
  will walk away with everythin&rsquo;,&rdquo; his uncle had averred, but even
  that startling prophecy had not prepared Jim.</p>

  <p>He sat there gripping his seat, yelling when the crowd yelled. And he saw
  Curly Prentiss ride wild bronchos that threw all the other riders; he saw
  Hack Jocelyn break the record for roping two-year-olds; he saw Bud Chalfack
  climb all over a horse, racing at breakneck speed; he saw Jackson Way ride
  two beautiful horses, standing with one foot on the back of each, and beat
  his opponents two full lengths; and lastly he saw Lonestar Holliday win the
  money for the perilous feat of bulldogging steers.</p>

  <p>Out of sixteen events the Diamond outfit took nine first prizes. Jim
  scarcely could contain himself. That was his band of cowboys. He might have
  hated them before today, but now he loved them. He gathered vaguely that
  something tremendous had happened to him.</p>

  <p>He rode out to the ranch-house in a trance, divided between pride for his
  cowboys and the momentous dance near at hand. He shaved and washed and
  changed his clothes, aware of an undue regard for his appearance. His uncle
  had guests, to whom Jim was presented as the boss of the Diamond. Jim
  acquitted himself creditably, and kept his miserable secret, strangely
  growing less miserable.</p>

  <p>Then he was off to the dance, eager, with palpitating heart, amused at
  himself, amazed and glad. He now had opportunity to show some of these
  Flagerstown girls that if he was a tenderfoot he could interest and perhaps
  win a prettier girl than any of them. But he had not prepared himself for a
  vision in white&mdash;his girl of the booth&mdash;stunningly transformed by a
  gown, a brown-armed, brown-faced beauty with haunting dark eyes. She saw Jim
  at once. She bowed. And whatever had not already happened to his heart surely
  happened then.</p>

  <p>Jim did not approach anyone; he saw only her. And he was in a torment
  waiting for her to give him the opportunity he longed for. If she did not he
  must go to her, and introducing himself ask for the dance. But she divined
  his predicament. How the dark eyes met his across the hall, through the
  whirling throng! Soon she sought a seat with her young partner, and obviously
  dismissed him. Jim made haste to reach her, to bend over her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dance!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

  <p>She rose, her face like pearl, her eyes downcast, and gave herself to his
  embrace.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">IT WAS Sunday, and Jim had returned to the Diamond camp, a
  bewildered and chastened young man. Except for Jeff, who was asleep under a
  tree, the camp was deserted. Jim went again into the deep shade and quiet of
  the forest. There out of chaos his thoughts got some semblance of control
  over his emotions and order in themselves.</p>

  <p>All the other egregious tenderfoot blunders he had made could not in the
  aggregate sum up the magnitude of alienating Molly Dunn. He writhed under
  that. And always he would protest&mdash;who could have imagined that sweet
  dainty girl sister to a desperado, a gun-thrower, a killer, a rustler of the
  very brakes it was Jim&rsquo;s task to fence off from the range? Then, just
  as poignantly he would add&mdash;but what difference did it really make who
  was her brother and why had he been so asinine as to distress and shame her
  with the connection?</p>

  <p>He found excuse for himself for everything but that. It had struck him
  almost dumb at first to realize that he had lost his head and seized her,
  hugged her atrociously, surely would have devoured her with kisses had she
  not brought him to his senses with a cutting blow across his mouth. That act,
  at once under the astounding dominance of her voluntary kiss&mdash;a strange
  sweet little touch of cool lips&mdash;had lost its heinousness. In the light
  of the present hour, when it came to him that there had been genuine
  sincerity, the wild impetus of first love, he realized he had not much to be
  sorry for there. But she had not known that. How would she ever know? Not
  that knowing would change her! Her eyes haunted him. What a magnificent
  blaze! In them had been repeated the fire of Slinger Dunn&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>Why had Molly Dunn kissed him? He recalled her pitiful little confession,
  and that hurt Jim more than anything else. She was not what he had thought
  her and she yearned to be. Jim stoutly fought against the fading and receding
  of something beautiful. The dream, the glory of new vibrant emotion, had to
  pale before reality. Yet Jim could not renounce, nor could he resign himself
  to another bitter blow this West had given him. It was sudden, complicated,
  and disastrous. But was it irremediable? A grain of comfort lay in the fact
  that he had time to think, to go over it, to puzzle it out, to find what had
  actually happened to him, to conceive who and what Molly Dunn was, and
  understand her reaction to their meeting.</p>

  <p>Most vivid of the things he recalled was the bitter reproach in her big
  eyes. Why had she reproached him? Not because he had unwittingly intimated of
  a wide class distinction between Jim Traft and Molly Dunn. She knew she was
  Molly Dunn of the Cibeque. The reproach had come from a deep and terrible
  hurt. Jim divined suddenly that maybe she, too, had fallen in love at first
  sight. The ecstasy of that was short-lived. It could not be true. His own
  state for weeks had been one of excitement, strain, growing to morbidness.
  Then a swift change to romance and sentiment had thrown him off his balance.
  He sank as deep into the depths as he had been lifted to the skies. All of
  which seemed only to add to the mystery and fascination and fatality of Molly
  Dunn. He discovered himself vainly trying to do battle against her own
  estimate of herself. Just a little backwoods girl to whom a white gown had
  added charm! But he soon scouted that. Molly Dunn had innate charm.</p>

  <p>Through the pine trees he saw some of the cowboys returning from
  Flagerstown, and the considerable distance between them did not drown sounds
  of their hilarity. Jim plumped down under a pine, overcome by an entirely new
  and unforeseen probability. Some of the members of the Diamond had been at
  that dance last night. Beyond the bounds of hope and reason was it that they
  might not have seen him there with Molly Dunn. Those hawk-eyed cowboys could
  see through walls. They had an uncanny genius for finding out everything. But
  they needed only to know a little to drive Jim to distraction.</p>

  <p>He lingered there in the woods, not actually afraid yet, but certainly
  loath to confront them. Molly Dunn&rsquo;s terse statement that she would get
  up and fight some more, which he had appropriated as a slogan, in this
  vacillating hour lost its grip. What a pity if he could not be actuated by
  that spirit again! Perhaps it would revive, if he got sufficient cue for
  anger.</p>

  <p>Long before the supper hour, which Jeff had early on Sunday, the cowboys
  rode into camp. So presently Jim felt the imperative necessity of showing
  himself, because longer absence would only aggravate any suspicions
  concerning him.</p>

  <p>He dragged himself up and to the edge of the forest, only there bracing
  himself for the ordeal. Somebody saw him coming. Did they pursue their usual
  demeanor and pay no attention to him? They did not. To his horror they lined
  up on each side of the camp fire, and faced him like a lot of grim judges.
  Jim divined that whatever he had dreaded was about to be perpetrated. And
  some last shred of courage came to his aid as he ran the gauntlet of the
  merciless Diamond.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, boys! Back early&mdash;I see,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully, if
  haltingly. &ldquo;I changed my mind and went in to the <i>rodeo</i>
  yesterday. You sure gave me the treat of my life. I congratulate the outfit
  on so many prizes. You can bet I was proud of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not a murmur! He bent over to move a couple of billets on the newly
  started camp fire, solely to hide his face. Then he sauntered on toward the
  tree where he kept his pack and bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, boss, we heahed ya walked off with a prize yourself,&rdquo;
  called Bud Chalfack. &ldquo;Some little blue-ribbon boy from
  Mizzourie!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That sally of Bud&rsquo;s was greeted by uproarious mirth. Like a giant
  hand it pulled Jim round. His cowboys presented a group of nine young men in
  varying stages of convulsions. The devil himself emanated from them. Jim
  choked back a sharp retort. Then Cherry Winters, still quite drunk, staggered
  over to Jim, his red face a whole grin of impish delight, and he essayed to
  deliver what must have been intended for an important speech. But its manner
  of delivery and incoherence spurred Jim to a blunt, &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo;
  and a hard shove. Cherry kept on staggering, this time backward, and he kept
  on until he met with an obstacle in shape of Jeff&rsquo;s woodpile. He fell
  on this, toppled it over upon him, and he did not arise. The gang whooped.
  They had all been drinking, and Bud looked pretty wabbly on his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tenderfoot hell!&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;You got us&mdash;skinned
  to frazzle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bud, but I don&rsquo;t quite savvy,&rdquo; returned
  Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I shore&mdash;ben savin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; up,&rdquo;
  raved Bud, beside himself with maudlin emotion. &ldquo;Th&rsquo;
  outfit&rsquo;s all heahed aboot you last night. But I <i>seen</i>
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, anybody not blind could have done that,&rdquo; snapped Jim,
  trying to pierce the secret intensity of Bud&rsquo;s rapture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I ben&mdash;savin&rsquo; it up,&rdquo; crowed Bud, slapping his
  knees with his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You better keep saving it,&rdquo; warned Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, boss, I couldn&rsquo;t think of thet. It&rsquo;s too orful
  good. I gotta tell the Diamond aboot it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If Jim had any dignity left it was that of the gathering might of fury.
  What did the little fool know? Jim resisted a fierce impulse to slap the
  gaping mouth. The cowboys clamored to hear. They sensed the long-hoped-for
  corralling of their tenderfoot foreman. Jim grimly gazed from face to face.
  Most of them were only in fun, and Bud was drunk. Curly, too, appeared a
  little under the influence of the bottle. But Hack Jocelyn was keen, cold,
  leering. Jim did not miss anything.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I seen you on the porch,&rdquo; shouted Bud,
  triumphantly.</p>

  <p>Jim gasped at that revelation. Oh, misery! How exceedingly worse than he
  had dreaded!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fellars, I seen our fastidinous boss from Mizzourie,&rdquo; went on
  Bud, swelling with his dénouement, &ldquo;I seen him huggin&rsquo; thet
  little hussy&mdash;Molly Dunn!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Before Jim realized what he was doing he had leaped at Bud, to knock him
  over the pack-saddles. The blow had been solid, and at least for the moment
  another of the Diamond was down and out.</p>

  <p>Curly Prentiss jumped out from the circle, slamming his sombrero down with
  a smack.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You two-faced Mizzourie gent!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Bud&rsquo;s
  my pard. I&rsquo;m shore gonna lick you for thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah! You bow-legged cowpuncher!&rdquo; blazed Jim. &ldquo;If you
  can&rsquo;t fight any better than you dance&mdash;you&rsquo;ll never lick
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That hurt Curly more than the blow to his friend. He threw his scarf one
  way, his vest another, his gun-belt at Jackson Way, and he almost sprawled on
  the ground ridding himself of chaps and spurs.</p>

  <p>The delay gave Jim time to collect his wits. But even that and some
  semblance of coolness did not mitigate his welcome of a battle with any or
  all of this confounded Diamond outfit. The incentive he needed had been
  miraculously forthcoming.</p>

  <p>Curly gave a capital imitation of a bull about to charge when he was
  detained by Uphill Frost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold on a minnit,&rdquo; yelled that individual, impressively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t corral me. I&rsquo;m gonna pulverize this
  gurl-huggin&rsquo; foreman,&rdquo; replied Curly, swinging his arms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, an&rsquo; my money&rsquo;s on you, Curly, old
  buckaroo,&rdquo; said Frost, holding up a hand stuffed with greenbacks of
  small denominations.</p>

  <p>There was a noisy scramble then among the cowboys to get money up on
  Curly. But it developed that not a single backer of Jim came forward. If Jim
  had not been so wretched about Molly and so furious at these pig-headed
  cowboys he would have howled with mirth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take every bet,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whoopee!&rdquo; yelled somebody, with an eye to fortune.
  &ldquo;Give any odds, boss?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two to one,&rdquo; answered Jim. &ldquo;But hurry. I want to get
  this over and have my supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Atta boy, Curly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Larrup him unmerciful!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fightin&rsquo; fer the Diamond!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Curly came lumbering in Jim stepped aside and hit him in the ribs.
  The blow gave forth a hollow sound. Curly whirled around and plunged,
  swinging. He delivered wide sweeping blows that, if any of them had connected
  with Jim, would have fulfilled the hopes of the yelling Diamond. But they
  expended their strength on the empty air. In a couple of moments Jim became
  aware that Curly could not hit him. The cowboy was a wonder in a saddle, but
  on the ground he was lost. He got his feet tangled up and he appeared the
  farthest remove from nimble. After hitting Curly a few times here and there
  Jim discovered a vulnerable spot in Curly&rsquo;s big handsome nose.
  Wherefore Jim began to concentrate on that. He whacked it with his left. Soon
  the blood began to flow and with it Curly&rsquo;s wild exuberance. But this
  did not improve his fighting. Then Jim landed his right and that upset Curly.
  He sat down quite suddenly. This also upset Curly&rsquo;s backers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Git up, you big cheese!&rdquo; yelled Hack Jocelyn, and he did not
  mean to be funny. &ldquo;Our money&rsquo;s on you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Curly responded to that trenchant call. And now to his amazement was added
  fury. In the ensuing few moments he showed that his spirit was willing but
  his flesh weak. The blows he landed upon Jim were inconsequential. On the
  other hand Jim gave him a severe drubbing. After the third knock-down Curly
  merely sat up. It chanced that this time he was near Bud, who was also
  sitting up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd! pard, hev we come to this?&rdquo; cried Bud, evidently
  sober enough to realize. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d he hit me with?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon it was a hoss-shoe,&rdquo; said Curly, feeling his swollen
  and bloody nose.</p>

  <p>Jim stepped closer and peered down at Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Prentiss, have you got enough?&rdquo; he asked, fiercely.</p>

  <p>Curly looked up without the least trace of resentment and nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I cain&rsquo;t say how it come aboot, but I&rsquo;m shore
  licked,&rdquo; he said, and he grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I pick this fight?&rdquo; went on Jim, quick to grasp the
  situation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shore didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Are you going to threaten me with that damn nonsense
  about gun-play or are you going to shake hands?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Curly laboriously got to his feet. Something had pierced the armor of his
  stupidity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll shake,&rdquo; he rejoined, and he took
  Jim&rsquo;s proffered hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re drunk,&rdquo; growled Hack Jocelyn, in disgust,
  with a hard eye on Curly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; we had our money on you!&rdquo;
  With that he strode surlily away.</p>

  <p>Bud Chalfack essayed to rise, a task no means easy, owing to the billets
  of wood that surrounded his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, you better stay there, because if you get up I&rsquo;ll only
  have to knock you down again,&rdquo; said Jim, menacingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t fightin&rsquo; you. Thet was Curly,&rdquo;
  protested Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No matter. You&rsquo;re a little skunk, and I&rsquo;ll have to do
  it, unless you have another pard who&rsquo;ll take it for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh.&rdquo; Bud looked around, and it was evident that at the
  moment not one of the cowboys seemed eager to take Jim&rsquo;s hint.
  &ldquo;Boss, so you&rsquo;re one of them fellars thet&rsquo;s never satisfied
  once he gets a-goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re bigger&rsquo;n me an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t do
  nothin&rsquo; except give you away. An&rsquo; if you hadn&rsquo;t soaked me
  I&rsquo;d hev told the fellars&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you tell any more I&rsquo;ll beat you into jelly. And I&rsquo;ll
  do that anyhow unless you apologize.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw! Fer callin&rsquo; Molly Dunn a little hussy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim looked a grim affirmative.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, boss. I crawl. But I didn&rsquo;t mean any
  insult.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t?&mdash;Say, you little dumb-head! Didn&rsquo;t you
  lie when you said you saw me hug her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I think I was sober <i>then</i>,&rdquo; replied Bud, gravely.
  &ldquo;I seen you hug her. You lifted her clean off the floor. She whacked
  you one&mdash;an&rsquo; when you let her down, she went fer you sudden-like
  an&rsquo; kissed you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim faced the silent puzzled cowboys. He had extracted all the humor for
  them from the situation, and he believed for once he had the upper hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, Bud was drunk last night. He has heaped disgrace on me and
  insulted a fine little girl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bud took violent exception to this, as was manifest from his face and
  actions, without the speech that followed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, it ain&rsquo;t no disgrace to hug a gurl in Arizonie.
  An&rsquo; if it happened to be Molly Dunn you&rsquo;d shore make this outfit
  proud. &rsquo;Cause Molly Dunn has handed the mitt to me an&rsquo; Lonestar.
  An&rsquo; she shore set Hack Jocelyn down cold an&rsquo; hard. Hack is plumb
  crazy over her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you called her hussy!&rdquo; thundered Jim, trying to hide his
  rapture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, boss, I didn&rsquo;t mean thet in no insultin&rsquo;
  way,&rdquo; protested Bud. &ldquo;Molly&rsquo;s a little wildcat. She&rsquo;s
  a devil. She has shore made this Diamond outfit sick. Why, me an&rsquo;
  Lonestar was flirtin&rsquo; with her down at West Fork, an&rsquo; we never
  knowed she was Slinger Dunn&rsquo;s sister! ... Boss, I take thet hussy
  back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, in that case I&rsquo;m sorry I misunderstood you,&rdquo;
  said Jim, and offered his hand to Bud.</p>

  <p>Jeff&rsquo;s noisy banging call to supper ended the incident. Jim imagined
  an almost imperceptible transformation in the air of the cowboys, except in
  Jocelyn and Winters, who were surly and uncommunicative.</p>

  <p>Jim sought his bed early. There was no singing round the camp fire that
  night. Scarcely had darkness set in when the fire flickered and went out. The
  coyotes had uninterrupted possession of the silence. But Jim did not find
  slumber coming easily. He believed he had stumbled on a way to get the best
  of the Diamond outfit. He was not sure that his hope was not father to the
  conviction, but the more he pondered over his achievement the more elated he
  became. These simple elemental boys respected only achievement. They did not
  really in the least care who a man was. It was what he could do! And Jim
  believed he could whip every last one of them. Hack Jocelyn would be a mean
  customer. Jim had liked Hack less and less all the time, and Bud&rsquo;s
  allusion to Hack&rsquo;s interest in Molly Dunn aggravated the feeling.
  Jocelyn would be dangerous in a fight and not to be trusted in relation to a
  woman. Jim could have laughed aloud at this deduction. Already he seemed to
  be anticipating rivals! But so far as Molly Dunn was concerned he certainly
  could not trust himself.</p>

  <p>Jim reflected. It had amazed him&mdash;the ease with which he had bested
  Curly, and he tried to reason out why. Curly was a big, lithe, strong fellow,
  who ought to have put up a very aggressive battle. But he had been born on a
  horse and had lived in a saddle. On the ground he did not know what to do
  with himself. Slow, awkward, uncertain, he had been at Jim&rsquo;s mercy.
  Whereupon Jim took stock of himself. He weighed around one hundred and
  seventy. He had a long reach, a fist like a mallet; he was quick as a cat and
  fast on his feet. Only a couple of years back he had been pretty clever with
  his hands. And this had come about naturally enough. When he was about
  fourteen years old he was friends with a boy who had a cousin come visiting
  from the East. And this cousin taught Jim and his friend something of the
  manly art of self-defense.</p>

  <p>It began to look as if Jim had another asset which he had not counted on
  at all. The fence-building on a Missouri farm had been the first; now the
  second was this playful and friendly boxing habit. These cowboys had long
  since given him reason to resort to violence. But Jim knew he had been
  backward and perhaps afraid. From some source had come the courage of a lion.
  He chuckled to himself. No fear that these cowboys would haul in! By their
  very nature&mdash;their pugnacity and curiosity&mdash;they must grow worse.
  Each and every one of them would feel it his bounden duty to wipe up the
  camp-ground with the tenderfoot foreman of the Diamond. Jim reveled in a
  situation that a few days back had been well-nigh intolerable. No wonder they
  had been a pondering lot of young men! A gleam of light they refused to see
  had begun to penetrate their craniums.</p>

  <p>But as for Molly Dunn! When Jim let clamoring thoughts of her dominate his
  consciousness his exultant glee died and his heart sank like lead in his
  breast. So some of these tough cowboys knew her! Had dared to approach her!
  The idea made Jim&rsquo;s blood run hot and cold. Still, Molly could not have
  helped that, if these cowboys had discovered where she lived or any place she
  frequented. West Fork! He had not heard of that place. But he would very soon
  see it for himself. Stone walls could not keep these riders of the Diamond
  out. How much less then could a girl do it? Molly had spunk, though, Jim
  thought. It was no use to let pride and distrust have sway over him. As he
  lay there, his face upward to the dark canopy of pines, through which
  starlight filtered, he realized he was infatuated. That was as far as he
  grasped truth. Molly was an enigma, but only that because of the allusions of
  Bud Chalfack. That confounded cowboy had been witness to the scene on the
  porch in Flagerstown. He had seen Molly&rsquo;s incredible response to
  Jim&rsquo;s embrace. Jim felt it as a sacrilege. How could he dream and
  ponder over something that had been profaned by the keen eyes of a vulgar
  cowboy? Jim writhed over this aspect of the situation. Then when Jim was
  abject a staggering thought struck him. Bud Chalfack had lied about the
  interpretation of the word hussy. Bud was a smooth-tongued, crafty cowboy.
  Jim had observed a hundred instances of his diplomacy with his comrades. He
  was the brainiest of the lot.</p>

  <p>The thought of Bud&rsquo;s trenchant remark was sickening. If these
  cowboys actually knew Molly Dunn, if they had ever been in her willing
  presence&mdash;especially that hard-lipped, veiled-eyed Jocelyn&mdash;it
  would be for Jim no less than a calamity. Because he would have at once to
  turn his back on romance. Then suddenly he recalled Molly&rsquo;s shy swift
  kiss&mdash;timid if there had ever been a timid kiss&mdash;and later her
  sharp retort that he had been the first ever to have that from her, and
  loyalty and love leaped to her defense. There, then, the battle raged in
  Jim&rsquo;s mind&mdash;between uncertainty and gossip, between romance and
  realism, between faith and unfaith.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">MOLLY DUNN filled the bucket at the spring and set it
  down.</p>

  <p>She had been home from Flagerstown ten days&mdash;two weeks&mdash;exactly
  fifteen days, and they seemed years. All had changed. Her very identity was
  not the same. If she had ever had any capacity for happiness, it had
  fled.</p>

  <p>She looked at the old wooden bucket She had carried it as long as she
  could remember, and that was as far back as when she had been so little she
  could scarcely lift it. And the spring&mdash;all her life she remembered
  that. Once it had been an unfailing source of wonder and gladness. It was the
  biggest and finest spring of granite water of all the springs in the Cibeque
  Valley. It roared out from under a mossy cliff at the head of a shady glen,
  as large as a room and as deep as a well. Molly could see the pink-sided
  trout lying along the rocky sides; she could see the golden gleams deep down
  where the bubbles sparkled out of the shadow. Maple Spring was deep enough to
  drown her, and Molly wished she had the courage to fall in and sink. But she
  had accidentally fallen in there often, and she could swim like a fish. It
  would be of no use.</p>

  <p>The glen, too, had been one of her perennial joys. The spring lent music
  and movement as it boiled and eddied round the great hole and then burst over
  a little fall to begin its melodious way down the winding gully. Many rocks
  and drooping ferns lined the banks; maples and sycamores leaned over the
  amber water, letting only gleams of sunshine through; huge pines and spruces
  rose from the bank above to tower high. Above the spring on a level bench
  were grass and flowers, and clean, flat, gray stones where Molly had played
  alone all her childhood and dreamed hours of her girlhood. It had been a
  hiding-place, too, for it was isolated and not close to the cabin or trail.
  The squirrels and jays shared this secret with Molly. Only in the fall when
  the wild turkeys came down, and the hunters followed, were the sanctity and
  sweetness of this glen disrupted.</p>

  <p>But Molly gazed about with eyes hopelessly disillusioned or else blinded
  by the trouble that had come to her. All because of the wonderful ride to
  Flagerstown&mdash;a white gown, a dance&mdash;and Him! Molly felt she could
  never be again what she had been before that visit. She would be what he had
  mistaken her for or she would die.</p>

  <p>Every day since her return home had seen a struggle. At first she had been
  hot and resentful in her humiliation. She had hated Jim Traft. She would be a
  worthy sister to Slinger Dunn. She would carry on so boldly with the riders
  that her name would become a byword on the range for&mdash;for&mdash;Molly
  did not know what, but she would find out. She would encourage that nice
  little cowboy of the Diamond&mdash;Bud Chalfack, whose name she had never
  known until the night of the dance. And she would flirt outrageously with
  Curly Prentiss. Indeed, she would no longer repel the advances of Hack
  Jocelyn, though she disliked and feared him. She would show Jim Traft that
  she could win his vain and stuck-up cowboys and cast them aside, for Seth
  Haverly and even for Andy Stoneham.</p>

  <p>But opportunities for such conduct had multiplied and she had not availed
  herself of them. Seth had been often at her home, with her brother Arch, but
  she knew why he came. And always Andy waylaid her when she went on errands
  down to the village. On Sunday she had espied Hack Jocelyn riding up the
  trail from West Fork, and she had dodged into the brush.</p>

  <p>She resented her vacillation and was long in understanding. But as the
  days went by she had finally realized that she was terribly, miserably in
  love. Her amaze and scorn, her fury and contempt, her pride and her shame,
  her wretched attempts to sink under this malady and make of herself what Jim
  Traft must think her&mdash;all were of no avail and only added to her
  burden.</p>

  <p>Lately Molly had begun to soften toward Jim, and that had been the
  forerunner of dreams and remembrances and longings. Once she had surrendered
  to this sweet fancy she was doomed. Before she knew it she could no longer
  fight herself or the thought of Jim. So that a few lonely afternoons in the
  glen, a few nights lying wide awake in the dark loft of the cabin, had been
  her undoing. The shame of it made her more furious than ever, but she was
  helpless. In the daylight she had some semblance of character. At least she
  could throw off yearnings and what she deemed idiotic enchantments, but at
  night she became a weak girl, with aching heart and mad tumultuous
  emotions.</p>

  <p>Each morning for a week when she had come to the spring for water she had
  set the bucket down, to indulge in pondering, brooding thoughts. This morning
  they prevailed longer than usual. But at length she picked up the heavy
  bucket and took the trail home. She left the glen behind, and perhaps the
  most bearable of her thoughts.</p>

  <p>The trail led to the clearing, to the forty acres of hideous slash in the
  forest that Dunn had homesteaded twenty years before. The rest of the hundred
  and sixty acres consisted of timber land. Dunn had never &ldquo;proved
  up&rdquo; on his claim, and therefore had no patent for it.</p>

  <p>Arch Dunn plowed the red field and planted the beans and corn and sorghum
  and potatoes. He had spells when he stayed home and worked about the farm.
  But the last year or two he had left the harvesting of the crop to Molly and
  her mother.</p>

  <p>As Molly passed along the trail, under the cedars and piñons and an
  occasional pine, she gazed out at the red furrows, now green-ridged with
  beans and corn; she saw that she would soon have to get in there with a hoe.
  It had never occurred to her before, but she certainly hated that beanfield.
  Here and there stood dead pines and cedars that had been &ldquo;ringed&rdquo;
  by an ax and left standing to become bleached and ghastly; and everywhere
  black stumps stuck up, surrounded by a patch of weeds. Farmers in the Cibeque
  let the stumps rot out.</p>

  <p>The cabin, at the end of the clearing, fitted the scene. It consisted of
  two one-room log buildings, with a porch between, and one rough-shingled roof
  over all. The shingles were moss-green in places and the logs were bleached.
  In the chinks between, sections of clay had broken out. The fences were down,
  the sheds built of uneven clapboards.</p>

  <p>Altogether Molly saw the homestead with gloomier eyes than ever. Yet it
  could boast of the finest view in all the Cibeque. To north and east the vast
  gray-cliffed and canyon-notched wall of the Diamond towered, a mountain face
  of a thousand features and never the same any two hours of the day. Southward
  opened up the valley of the Cibeque, all its whole length from this high
  prospect. But its endless promontories, and long ridges running down, its red
  walls and gray crags, its winding bright ribbon of water through the green
  valley, and in the far distance the dim blue ranges, had little charm to
  intrigue Molly Dunn this unhappy day.</p>

  <p>She carried the bucket into the kitchen end of the cabin&mdash;a dark
  room, only in winter a place of comfort.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been gone long enough to dig a well,&rdquo; remarked
  her mother, with sarcasm. Mrs. Dunn was still young and good-looking enough
  to be jealous of Molly. She had come from a station considerably above John
  Dunn&rsquo;s, and she was a bitter, unhappy woman. Since Molly had grown old
  enough to attract the attention of men, what accord that had existed between
  mother and daughter had gradually been broken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That bucket is heavy an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a long ways,&rdquo;
  replied Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You used to fetch it in a jiffy. You met some cowboy on the
  trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s funny, but I didn&rsquo;t this
  mawnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you must have fallen in the spring, then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wisht I had,&rdquo; returned Molly, flippantly. She went out and
  across the porch. Her father had gotten up and was slouching in his crippled
  way to the big blanketed chair where he passed his wakeful hours. Of late
  Molly had seemed to see him differently, with pity and tolerance. These
  feelings, too, applied to her mother. Dunn was not an old man in years, but
  he was in all else. His dark hair, shading gray, hung down over his knotted
  pale brow. He was a broken man, living in the past, ruined by some secret
  association with an infamous war between sheepmen and cattlemen, and devoured
  by passions that had outlived his enemies. Molly had affection for her
  father, despite the impatience and disgust which grew with the years. And of
  late, since her own trouble, she had begun to have some little understanding
  of her mother&mdash;of what it must have meant to be faithful to Dunn all
  these years. There flashed over Molly a consciousness that she could follow
  Jim Traft to the end of the world and slave her fingers to the bone for him.
  Then she laughed at her imbecility. For her to aspire to be the wife of Mr.
  James Traft, gentleman tenderfoot from Missouri, and the sole heir to old Jim
  Traft&rsquo;s land and stock&mdash;that was rather far-fetched and
  ridiculous. Besides, she did not do anything of the kind. But she could not
  control vagrant and perverse thoughts. Here flashed another. This same Jim
  Traft had importuned her to let him be her best fellow. How pale and earnest
  he had looked! It was impossible to repudiate his sincerity. To be his
  sweetheart! Molly had a stronger, sweeter, more suffocating rush of emotion.
  What would become of her if this thing grew? She must throw herself at Andy
  or Seth, or both of them, and kill this affliction. But could those louts
  kill it? Molly divined they could not kill anything except her self-respect.
  And that, strangely, had become a pronounced thing. She would now have it to
  contend with. Her pride&mdash;her vanity! All because she had been hugged by
  a handsome young fellow from Missouri! Molly let out a peal of ringing
  laughter that made even her father take notice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lass, you&rsquo;ve been queer since you come back from Flag,&rdquo;
  he remarked, in his quavering voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I feel queer, dad,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I waked up from my
  backwoods sleep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Backwoods! You mean this heah homestead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind what I meant, dad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He could not understand, and if she confessed the truth to her mother it
  would only add fuel to that strange animosity which had developed between
  them.</p>

  <p>Molly plunged into one of her working spells. It could never have been
  said of her, at any time, that she was lazy, but she took streaks in which
  she was busy from dawn to sundown. Small as she was, Molly had strength and
  endurance. Her little tanned hands were pretty to look at, on the back; her
  palms, however, and the insides of her fingers were hard and cut and
  calloused. They occasioned Molly pangs of regret, though she had never felt
  ashamed of the labor that had coarsened them. It was just that the vanity
  inborn in her rebelled. She was vain of her little feet and trim ankles; and
  that was why she never went barefoot and barelegged any more. She would brush
  her hair until it crackled and shone gold glints in its dusky splendor. But
  she could work like a beaver, and she did this day, preoccupied and sad most
  of the time, yet cheerful during intervals.</p>

  <p>Toward sunset, while Molly was at the wood-pile&mdash;one of her many
  accomplishments being skill with an ax&mdash;her brother Arch approached.
  This was an unprecedented action for him. Years before she and Arch had been
  like sister and brother, playmates, but that seemed long before he had taken
  to evil ways of the woods and had earned the sobriquet of Slinger Dunn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, cain&rsquo;t you leave a little work around heah for
  me?&rdquo; he complained.</p>

  <p>She dropped the fagot she had picked up, and she stared at him. What a
  handsome, shiftless, backwoods beggar! He had the build of an Indian. Horses
  had not warped his legs nor broken any bones. His soiled buckskin garments
  somehow suited him. For some amazing reason he had shaved the golden down
  from chin and lips, and his dark, lean face shone clean and smooth.
  Arch&rsquo;s eyes usually lost their piercing quality when they beheld Molly.
  Just now they were bearable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, you shore ain&rsquo;t drunk,&rdquo; she said, thoughtfully
  regarding him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. An&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t sick, nuther,&rdquo; he replied.
  &ldquo;Never you mind aboot me. But cain&rsquo;t I be civil without you
  gettin&rsquo; sassy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore I hope so. An&rsquo; now I know somethin&rsquo; ails you,
  Arch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Set down. A fellar cain&rsquo;t talk in there,&rdquo; he said,
  jerking a sinewy brown hand toward the cabin. &ldquo;Dad is out of his haid.
  An&rsquo; mother&mdash;wal, poor mother raves if you so much as open your
  mouth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor mother? Yes, an&rsquo; poor dad, too.... Arch, you said a
  lot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, what chanct have we ever had to help make them
  different?&rdquo; he queried, swallowing hard. &ldquo;I never had no
  schoolin&rsquo; atall. An&rsquo; you&mdash;only a couple of years. What do we
  know? ... An&rsquo; before I was sixteen I was Slinger Dunn!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly was so amazed she could not keep track of flying thoughts. One held,
  however, and it was that if awakening consciousness of heretofore vague
  things could come to her it surely was possible for them to come to Arch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, is it too late?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell! yes, for me. But for you, Molly&mdash;wal, mebbe it&rsquo;s
  not. I hope to Gawd it ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, if you want to know, I&rsquo;m as down in the mouth as
  you,&rdquo; said Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have been queer lately, since you come home.... Mol, did
  anythin&rsquo; happen at Flag?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A whole lot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your feelin&rsquo;s get hurt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly gave a solemn little nod.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, tell me aboot it,&rdquo; he went on, with that wonderful flash
  of eyes.</p>

  <p>Molly laughed. &ldquo;So you can shoot somebody up?&mdash;No, Arch, you
  cain&rsquo;t ever help me that way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is thet so? Wal, you never know. But all the same; tell
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, it was awful for me,&rdquo; she replied, unable to resist
  sympathy. &ldquo;Mrs. See took me, as you know. She was lovely. Bought me
  clothes&mdash;an&rsquo; oh! such a beautiful dress. All white&mdash;what
  there was of it! Arch, I actually felt naked. She has fine friends in Flag.
  She introduced me. I was asked to help in a booth at the fair.... Well,
  it&rsquo;s like a dream now. A dream you cain&rsquo;t believe. I&mdash;I was
  the belle at that dance, Arch. Can you believe it? I was crazy with
  joy&mdash;at bein&rsquo; taken for a&mdash;a lady. I must have looked one,
  Arch.... Then somethin&rsquo; happened an&rsquo; my heart broke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They found you out, Mol?&rdquo; he queried, shrewdly. &ldquo;Thet
  you lived down in the brakes? Thet your dad was John Dunn? An&rsquo; your
  brother Slinger Dunn of the Cibeque?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Arch, I was found out,&rdquo; she replied: &ldquo;But I
  didn&rsquo;t go back on you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore you&rsquo;d never do thet,&rdquo; he said, somberly.
  &ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to have gone to Flag!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Must I stick here buried in the backwoods all my life?&rdquo; she
  asked, passionately.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, thet stumps me. I reckon I&rsquo;d have said yes a while
  back. But if you <i>was</i> made much of in Flag&mdash;if you <i>was</i> took
  for a lady, why, there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; turrible wrong!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is, Arch. That&rsquo;s the trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s with dad an&rsquo; me? An&rsquo; with mother,
  too, &rsquo;cause she&rsquo;s stuck to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, I am a Dunn, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mol, I come out heah to ask you a fool question. I see thet now.
  But I promised Seth an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll keep it. He wants to know if
  you&rsquo;ll marry him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seth Haverly? Heavens!&mdash;No!&rdquo; she cried, aghast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckoned you liked Seth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I did, once, a little.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, marryin&rsquo; Seth wouldn&rsquo;t help none. Now you make me
  think, Molly, I&rsquo;d be ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; thet. But you needn&rsquo;t
  never tell him.... Andy Stoneham is a decent fellar, though. An&rsquo;, Mol,
  he&rsquo;s turrible sweet on you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That tobacco-chewin&rsquo; lout!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who you gonna marry, then&mdash;to git you out of this heah
  hole?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one, Arch. You see that marryin&rsquo; one of these Cibeque boys
  would only nail me heah.... An&rsquo; the&mdash;the kind of a boy
  I&mdash;I&mdash;who could save me&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t have me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be a damn poor sort, then,&rdquo; flashed Arch, with
  passion. &ldquo;If I was sich a fellar as you mean I could swaller a lot for
  you, Molly. Don&rsquo;t fool yourself. You&rsquo;re good enough for any
  fellar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His earnestness, his sincerity, touched Molly. She went to the wood-pile
  and sat down beside him, meaning to thank him, to yield to this surprising
  sympathy in him, but all she did was to burst into tears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he said, almost roughly. &ldquo;Molly,
  I heah this Diamond cowboy, Hack Jocelyn, was seen in West Fork last
  Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. <i>I</i> saw him, myself, an&rsquo; I shore ducked into the
  brush.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Wal, thet lets you out, if you&rsquo;re not
  lyin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly dried her useless tears and presently faced him. &ldquo;Arch, I used
  to lie to you, about the boys an&rsquo; everythin&rsquo;. But I
  wouldn&rsquo;t no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon Jocelyn hasn&rsquo;t rid down heah so often the last year
  for nothin&rsquo;. Molly, is it you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Arch, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did at first. But not now. He&rsquo;s older. He&rsquo;s daid in
  earnest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! You mean aboot you? In love with you? Wants to marry you,
  same as Seth?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, he&rsquo;s in love, all right, but he never said
  nothin&rsquo; about marryin&rsquo; me. An&rsquo; of course I wouldn&rsquo;t
  have him if he had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I should smile not!&rdquo; ejaculated Arch. &ldquo;Marry one
  of thet Diamond outfit? My Gawd! ... But at thet they&rsquo;re some pretty
  decent boys compared to Jocelyn.... Mol, he an&rsquo; me are aboot ready to
  meet up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, you can&rsquo;t help me by killin&rsquo; any more
  fellars,&rdquo; cried Molly, shocked at the significance of his words.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one thing against me&mdash;your bloody record. An&rsquo;,
  Arch, if you keep on&mdash;if you should happen to kill one of that Diamond
  outfit&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll just go to the bad!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took that darkly, without a protest, as if consciousness was being
  driven home to a man inevitably lost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon I want to tell you suthin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he spoke up.
  &ldquo;All this talk aboot marryin&rsquo;.... I up an&rsquo; asked Lil
  Haverly to marry me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch! You did? Lil
  Haverly&mdash;that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind what. Anyway, I did, an&rsquo; I told her I&rsquo;d turn
  over a new leaf an&rsquo; go to ranchin&rsquo; if she&rsquo;d have me.
  An&rsquo; she laughed in my face! ... She&rsquo;d let me be sweet on her,
  too, Molly, an&rsquo; thet fooled me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s no good!&rdquo; retorted Molly, fiercely, suddenly and
  astoundingly conscious of her brother&rsquo;s pain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, not much, mebbe. Anyway, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he
  replied, sitting up. &ldquo;Come. I&rsquo;ll help you pack in this
  wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Molly slaved and brooded the days away. She could make life bearable by
  getting so tired during the day that sleep made short shift of the long,
  dark, silent nights. On Sunday she accepted the calls of Andy Stoneham and
  other village boys. Her wild intention to flirt viciously, to play fast and
  loose with them, seemed an utter impossibility, once they were in her
  presence. One Sunday afternoon, while walking the trail with Andy from the
  cabin to the creek, he took her hand in his, as had been his wont in the
  past&mdash;a preliminary to his by no means timid love-making. Molly let her
  hand lie passively in his a moment, which encouraged Andy to squeeze it. She
  wondered about this. She had absolutely no interest whatever in the action,
  except as something further to study about herself. Coming to the shade of a
  piñon tree, Andy gave her a little pull, accompanying the move by one of his
  speeches. Molly freed herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Andy, don&rsquo;t do that again,&rdquo; she said, quietly, with a
  glance, and walked on.</p>

  <p>Presently he caught up with her, and falling into step with her went on
  beside her for a goodly distance, without speaking. It was some time after
  this incident that Molly realized he had never attempted another liberty with
  her.</p>

  <p>The other boys, however, were hopeless in this regard, and the only way
  Molly could circumvent them was to entertain them on the porch. Two of these
  Sunday afternoons were rendered exciting by the fact of cowboys from the
  Diamond riding up and down the trail. Hack Jocelyn was one of them on both
  occasions. The other cowboys Molly did not know, though she had certainly
  seen the youngest one, frank-faced, and as rosy as a girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; said Andy, on the second of these visits, &ldquo;you
  know thet cowboy Jocelyn belongs to the Diamond?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore I know,&rdquo; replied Molly. &ldquo;Is that a
  crime?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, reckon &rsquo;tis, leastways since thet outfit&rsquo;s been
  buildin&rsquo; the drift fence.... Jocelyn has an eye fer you,
  gurl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very handsome an&rsquo; attractive. &rsquo;Most all the
  Diamond boys are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Why doesn&rsquo;t Jocelyn brace in hyar then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He aims to catch me alone, Andy. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s just as well
  you&rsquo;re heah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much obliged. Glad I&rsquo;m good fer suthin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied
  Andy, with sour humor. &ldquo;But jokin&rsquo; out of it, this fellar Jocelyn
  is up to tricks. Last night I seen him in Mace&rsquo;s saloon. He had money
  an&rsquo; was spendin&rsquo; it. Sort of stumped me to see Seth Haverly
  drinkin&rsquo; with him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Andy!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly, aroused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I jest did. Honest Injun. An&rsquo; you ain&rsquo;t the only
  one surprised.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was Arch there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon not. Arch hasn&rsquo;t been around lately. Now what&rsquo;s
  he a-goin&rsquo; to say to thet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say! He won&rsquo;t say anythin&rsquo;. But he&rsquo;s liable to do
  somethin&rsquo;. Seth an&rsquo; Arch are like brothers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, around hyar Arch is considered a dangerous fellar, but one
  you can trust. Seth ain&rsquo;t so dangerous, they say, but he cain&rsquo;t
  be trusted. Now we know thet Arch an&rsquo; Seth, the other Haverlys,
  an&rsquo; Hart Merriwell, an&rsquo; Boyd Flick, an&rsquo; some others make up
  the Cibeque outfit. One or more of them, on an&rsquo; off, rode fer the
  Coffee Pot, the Hash Knife, the Bar O an&rsquo; other outfits in the valley.
  But so far as I know not one of them is ridin&rsquo; fer any outfit
  now&mdash;except their own.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly echoed his last words and she caught the significance of his lowered
  voice and roving look around.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It jest strikes me funny thet Jocelyn of the Diamond seems to me
  makin&rsquo; up to Seth Haverly of the Cibeque. How does it strike you,
  Molly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not funny, you can bet,&rdquo; replied Molly, with a short laugh.
  &ldquo;Andy, there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in the wind. I&rsquo;m
  thankin&rsquo; you for givin&rsquo; me a hunch. Arch is strange an&rsquo;
  sore lately. He&rsquo;s that touchy aboot the Diamond boys an&rsquo; their
  work I cain&rsquo;t get a word out of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Wal, Molly, you can shore get them out of me,&rdquo; rejoined
  Andy, solidly, as one who had hit upon a happy medium. &ldquo;I heard folks
  talk aboot Jocelyn. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you what. If he keeps on
  ridin&rsquo; down to West Fork it&rsquo;s gonna be plumb bad fer
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Andy!&rdquo; faltered Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger will <i>kill</i> him,&rdquo; whispered Andy. &ldquo;My own
  idee is thet Slinger might stand fer Jocelyn gettin&rsquo; thick with Seth
  an&rsquo; his outfit, fer after all this brother of yours is a lone timber
  wolf. But he&rsquo;ll never stand fer Jocelyn runnin&rsquo; after
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Andy, I know he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; whispered Molly. &ldquo;But
  I&rsquo;ve told Arch aboot it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, air you shore you ain&rsquo;t interested in Jocelyn
  atall?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m shore. I was at first. Like a ground squirrel with a
  snake! But now&mdash;Jiminy, I&rsquo;ll run like a scared rabbit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s good if it&rsquo;s true. Will Slinger believe you?
  Molly, excuse me, but thar&rsquo;s folks who say you&rsquo;re meetin&rsquo;
  Jocelyn on the sly, along the trail somewheres.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again Molly suffered a hint of her status in West Fork. She passed by
  Andy&rsquo;s covert suspicion. What could he know of a girl&rsquo;s honesty?
  But she told him rather forcibly that at least her brother trusted and
  believed her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Wal, I&rsquo;m glad. You know what a place West Fork is fer
  talk. Wuss&rsquo;n a beehive. An&rsquo; the drift fence has shore stirred up
  hell. Molly, do you know thet son-of-a-gun tenderfoot Traft is &rsquo;most
  clear to the brakes with his damned fence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t heahed,&rdquo; replied Molly,
  thrilling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, he is. Most clear on the Diamond! Ole Enoch Summers says,
  &lsquo;Tenderfoot hell! Thet boy is Jim Traft over again, an&rsquo; you
  two-bit calf-chasers hev gotta look out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Summers&mdash;say that?&rdquo; gasped Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He shore did, an&rsquo; to a whole storeful of fellars.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>From that hour Molly was kinder to Andy. She relied upon him to fetch her
  news&mdash;the facts as well as gossip. And Andy, evidently sensing some
  change in her, accepted the part gratefully. Molly went to one of the
  Saturday-night dances with him. It was an ordeal. She was made much of,
  though some of the boys were rude, and some of the girls catty with their
  remarks. Where was the grand white dress with which Molly Dunn had killed off
  the Diamond outfit, including young Mr. James Traft?</p>

  <p>Molly did not stay long, especially after she had espied Hack Jocelyn
  enter the hall. She was quick enough, and Andy helped her, to get out before
  Jocelyn saw her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take me home, Andy,&rdquo; she said, nervously holding his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s a huggin&rsquo;-bee inside an&rsquo; a
  fightin&rsquo;-bee outside,&rdquo; replied Andy, sardonically. &ldquo;West
  Fork as she is an&rsquo; always will be, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Saturday night at West Fork always had been exciting, and Molly could
  count on her fingers the times she had seen it. But no longer was it
  diverting. There were groups of men and boys outside, noisy and rough. Sounds
  of hilarity came from the saloons. Indians passed her with soft tread. She
  heard the jingle of spurs on all sides. Shadows passed in front of the dimly
  lighted windows. The air was cool and sweet after the smoky hall. The dark
  bulk of the Diamond promontory stood up against the star-studded sky line.
  Molly was glad to turn off the street into the lane, and she held
  Andy&rsquo;s arm tighter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I ain&rsquo;t had a chanct like this in a coon&rsquo;s
  age,&rdquo; said Andy, as if stolidly realizing the opportunity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Andy, I&rsquo;m afraid of Hack Jocelyn,&rdquo; replied Molly,
  simply. &ldquo;I <i>cain&rsquo;t</i> be your sweetheart. I
  <i>cain&rsquo;t</i> let you handle me.... Do you want me to be afraid of you,
  too? Afraid to have you take me home in the dark?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not reply at once. Evidently the facts were hard to assimilate by
  his slow mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, now you tax me aboot it, I reckon I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly regarded that as more than an answer to her question. Andy, too,
  like Arch, had unplumbed depths in the darkness of which there must be
  good.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">DRY, hot midsummer lay upon the Cibeque. In the shade of the
  glen Molly spent hours idle on a rock, watching the big trout lying still in
  the clear water. The bees hummed by. The sumac on the stony slope had taken
  on touches of red and brown. Squirrels and jays were taking their high-noon
  siesta. The lizards, however, were active. They loved the heat and the dry
  brush and the hot stones. Molly never wearied of watching them and she could
  sit so quietly that the tiny ones would crawl over her hand. Seen near, they
  were beautiful with their many colors and jewel eyes.</p>

  <p>Things that concerned the life of West Fork revolved uppermost in her
  mind. The drift fence, so dominant a factor now, was well out on the Diamond.
  In the eyes of the Cibeque folk young Jim Traft was a perfect hurricane for
  work. Conflicting stories about how he worked and his fights with his cowboys
  were rife about the village. More cattle had drifted down into the brakes
  this summer than ever before. Vague hints that they all did not drift there
  of their own accord filtered to Molly&rsquo;s ears. Her father was
  perceptibly failing now, and her mother talked of going back to Illinois.
  Molly wondered what was to become of her, and she did not care much.</p>

  <p>Arch had been home steadily for a month, more morose than she had ever
  seen him. But he had driven Molly out of the beanfield and had harvested the
  beans himself. She tried not to see that he and the Haverly gang had cattle
  deals frequently. They drove cattle in from the brakes and down the Cibeque,
  small bunches and short drives that had a sinister significance to Molly.
  Resolutely she refused to think the matter out clearly.</p>

  <p>She went back home through the woods, watchful along the trail, sure that
  she was going to hear any rider or see anyone before he discovered her. A
  ten-acre pasture appeared to have more young cattle than it could very well
  graze. But they had not been there the day before.</p>

  <p>Along the eastern side of the cabin a line of sunflowers blazed gold in
  the sun. Molly&rsquo;s mother had planted sunflowers every spring as long as
  Molly could remember. It had always seemed funny to Molly, but she guessed
  nothing was that any more. Her father drooped in his chair on the porch; her
  mother puttered around in the kitchen; some ragged saddled horses stood
  bridles down out at the edge of the timber. Molly knew that Arch would be out
  there. The still hot summer air seemed charged with a suspense.</p>

  <p>Molly&rsquo;s mother sent her on an errand to the village. She was always
  glad when a trip of this kind could be made in the daytime. Her mother had a
  habit of forgetting until just before the evening meal. Molly did not start
  out toward the horses. She hurried out back of the barn and slipped into the
  woods to cut across to the trail, sure that none of the riders with Arch had
  observed her.</p>

  <p>The dusty village street was asleep. So was old Enoch Summers in his
  store. Molly made the necessary purchase, and not tarrying to listen to his
  gossip, though his query about Arch made her curious, she made haste
  homeward.</p>

  <p>When she reached the shady trail she went slower to regain her breath. At
  a thickly overgrown point, where the trail turned, a brown hand shot out from
  the green and grasped her arm. Molly was not the screaming kind. But she
  struggled with all her fierce young strength. It availed nothing, however,
  and she was dragged through the brush a step or two into a little clearing
  beside a huge fallen pine. Molly was frightened but not surprised to look up
  into the dark face of Hack Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, sweetheart!&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;I bin layin&rsquo; fer
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let go,&rdquo; said Molly, and she jerked so hard that she freed
  her arm. &ldquo;What you want? ... Did you have to drag me in
  heah?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, there&rsquo;s some folks I&rsquo;d rather not see me,&rdquo;
  replied Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My brother Arch, for one, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m standin&rsquo; tolerable with Slinger. I was
  thinkin&rsquo; of thet sneak, Andy Stoneham. He&rsquo;s got eyes an&rsquo; he
  thinks too much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what you want? Mother sent me on an errand She&rsquo;ll be
  waitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let her wait. Reckon I&rsquo;ve waited often an&rsquo; long enough.
  I had to see you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you <i>had</i> to, why didn&rsquo;t you come to my home, like
  any decent fellow would?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had reasons, Molly. But I&rsquo;m glad to tell you one
  of them ain&rsquo;t pressin&rsquo; no more. I&rsquo;ve quit the
  Diamond.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This had decided interest and surprise for Molly, though she did not voice
  it. She peered, however, up under the big sombrero, at the cowboy&rsquo;s
  handsome, wicked face. It bore recent signs of battle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand Jim Traft no longer,&rdquo; went on Jocelyn.
  &ldquo;I bin layin&rsquo; fer a chance to quit a month an&rsquo; more. We had
  some words. An&rsquo; it ended in a fist fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he lick you?&rdquo; asked Molly, unable to resist her swift
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon he did,&rdquo; returned Jocelyn, ruefully.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a slugger with his fists, an&rsquo; thet kind of
  fightin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t mine, I couldn&rsquo;t make him draw a gun while I
  was ridin&rsquo; with the Diamond, so I jest quit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Quit so you <i>could</i> make him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. An&rsquo; I reckon thet sounds good to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It means nothin&rsquo; to me,&rdquo; replied Molly, lying with
  tight lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was this heah talk aboot Bud Chalfack seein&rsquo; Traft
  insult you at the fair dance in Flag?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s news to me. Was there such talk?&rdquo; rejoined Molly,
  flippant to hide her start.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There shore was, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; the round like
  brush fire. Any reason fer it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t stop waggin&rsquo; tongues.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You danced with Jim Traft an&rsquo; went out with him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Jocelyn, if I did, that&rsquo;s my business an&rsquo; none of
  yours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly Dunn, I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; it mine,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d lie even if there was anythin&rsquo;. But you
  ought to have sense enough to know Jim Traft couldn&rsquo;t be serious aboot
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly looked away into the forest, conscious of deep-seated pain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good day, Mr. Jocelyn. I&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said,
  and moved away.</p>

  <p>Like a panther he leaped at her, cursing under his breath. She was a leaf
  in his grasp and she realized it. He lifted her high, held her close, and it
  was only by contortions of her supple body that she escaped hot fierce kisses
  on her lips. These burned face and neck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stayin&rsquo; heah&mdash;till I get through&mdash;with
  you,&rdquo; he panted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me&mdash;down. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; choked
  Molly.</p>

  <p>He let her slide till her feet touched the ground, but did not at once
  release her. Molly burned with more than shame. She could have killed him if
  she had not been so scared. All cowboys were violent and rude at times, but
  this one was a man with a cruel hand as masterful and relentless as if she
  were a horse. She must use a woman&rsquo;s wit or she might have infinitely
  more to regret. The place was secluded, lonely, so far from any cabin that
  screams would be useless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; he said, giving her a shake.
  &ldquo;Molly Dunn, you made up to me when I met you. An&rsquo; now
  you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to pay fer it. I&rsquo;m through with the Diamond
  an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m throwin&rsquo; in with the Cibeque. If you fell sweet fer
  Jim Traft, like them moon-eyed Flag girls, you can jest forget
  it.&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m crazy in love with you an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
  goin&rsquo; to have you. An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll marry me as soon as I make
  the stake we&mdash;I&rsquo;m figgerin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marry you!&mdash;Mister Jocelyn, you&rsquo;re shore takin&rsquo; a
  lot on your haid,&rdquo; said Molly, aghast and astounded at his effrontery.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankin&rsquo; you because a man cain&rsquo;t do any more
  than ask that of a girl, but I must say no.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; why must you?&rdquo; he queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if I know gurls, you&rsquo;ll change your tune soon as I make
  my stake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stake. What you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never you mind now. I want to talk to you aboot your brother.
  Accordin&rsquo; to the Haverlys he ain&rsquo;t got any use fer me. No reason
  except I was on the Diamond an&rsquo; thet I&rsquo;m supposed to have been
  driftin&rsquo; round heah on your trail. An&rsquo; thet ain&rsquo;t no lie!
  Wal, you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to set me straight with Slinger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I am!&rdquo; quoth Molly. Her fear held her in abeyance, but
  she could not wholly suppress her leaping spirit. &ldquo;If I know Arch Dunn
  that little job wouldn&rsquo;t be easy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve figgered it out,&rdquo; declared
  Jocelyn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been goin&rsquo; the rounds thet Jim Traft made a
  show of you at the dance. An&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll see it gets to
  Slinger&rsquo;s ears pronto. Wal, you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to admit
  it&rsquo;s true, an&rsquo; tell him I quit the Diamond because of it. Savvy,
  sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I savvy that you are a deep an&rsquo; cunnin&rsquo; hombre, Mister
  Jocelyn,&rdquo; replied Molly, sarcastically. Not to have saved her another
  of his onslaughts could she have restrained from that retort. But
  Jocelyn&rsquo;s instant grin proved that he took it for a compliment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can jest bet your sweet life I am.... An&rsquo; now soon as you
  swear you&rsquo;ll tell this to Slinger&mdash;an&rsquo;, wal, give me a
  kiss&mdash;you can run home to your mom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly could not look back on any experience with men like Jocelyn. He
  lacked something most cowboys had. But she divined that with whatever sort of
  girls he had consorted he had won them to his will. It seemed rather a force
  of character than conceit. Where Molly had disliked him, had been vaguely
  repelled, now she thoroughly hated and feared him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kiss you, but&mdash;I&rsquo;ll <i>think</i> aboot
  tellin&rsquo; that to Arch,&rdquo; she replied, playing for time, to
  propitiate him enough to let her escape from a predicament she would never
  let herself in for again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t let you go on thet, Molly,&rdquo; he said,
  cheerfully. The idiot actually felt sure of her. And he began to roll a
  cigarette, a shadow of a smile on his dark smooth face.</p>

  <p>Molly averted her eyes, lest he read in hers the thought that was forming.
  Once out of reach of his long arm she could get away. The cowboy did not live
  who could catch her on foot. Molly calculated distance and moment, while
  concentrating all her energy. Suddenly like a flash she ducked and bounded at
  once, under the brush into the trail. Jocelyn shouted and crashed through.
  But Molly darted away. She could run like a deer. Her moccasined feet
  pattered on the hard trail. He thudded heavily after her, soon losing ground.
  Molly looked over her shoulder to see that he might as well have been roped,
  for all the hope he had of catching her.</p>

  <p>She screeched a laugh back at him and sped on out of his sight, never
  slacking her swift pace until she reached the place she had cut across to
  avoid the riders. Once in the clearing, she went slowly so as to regain her
  breath.</p>

  <p>The fool! The hard-lipped cowpuncher&mdash;to think he could bully her
  into knuckling to him! But otherwise she welcomed the encounter. Hack Jocelyn
  had quit the Diamond. It was a stunning fact against all precedent. He was
  making up to the Cibeque, and especially to Arch Dunn. Some deviltry afoot!
  Molly divined that she was not the whole contention. She recalled
  Jocelyn&rsquo;s looks and words&mdash;his actions. How grimly satisfied with
  himself! He had built some big cowboy trick. What a clever ruse to win
  Slinger Dunn&rsquo;s friendship! If anything could have placated the lone
  timber wolf of the Cibeque, that crafty lie might.</p>

  <p>Molly sat down on a log to rest. And the gist of this complex situation
  burst upon her in realization of menace to Jim Traft. That agitated Molly
  even more than Jocelyn&rsquo;s attack on her. Hackmore Jocelyn would kill
  Jim, and if he did not Slinger Dunn or the Haverlys would. Molly divined it,
  shocked that it had not dawned upon her before, and her warm pulsing blood
  turned to ice. Jocelyn had proved traitor to the Diamond. For that he would
  be welcomed by the Cibeque, though she doubted Arch&rsquo;s complaisance. An
  infernal scheme had been hatched and Hack Jocelyn was the prime mover in it.
  And what did he mean by a stake? Molly understood the word to imply what
  riders called food or money that they hoped to get by some lucky or clever
  break. Jocelyn had certainly meant the latter and no small amount. Molly
  racked her brains for a solution, which was not forthcoming. Then her mother,
  espying her on the log, called, loudly. Molly hurried to the cabin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I declare, but you take long to do anythin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Mrs.
  Dunn, harshly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, so would anyone if she got waylaid by a bully of a
  cowpuncher,&rdquo; retorted Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded the mother, with a keen look at Molly&rsquo;s
  heated face.</p>

  <p>Instead of answering Molly ran like a squirrel up the ladder to the loft
  that opened over the porch. It had two compartments, one over each cabin.
  That over the kitchen was a storeroom, and the other, over the living-room,
  was Molly&rsquo;s. It had a window at the far end, a rude contraption that
  had been put in by Arch. The V-shaped roof was high enough only in the middle
  for Molly to stand erect. Since Molly had been a child this had been the only
  room she had ever had, but she preferred it to the living-room, where her
  parents slept and quarreled. Arch Dunn used to sleep on the porch below, and
  then Molly had felt safe, but for years now, most of the nights, only the
  pines and spruces had sheltered him. What furniture there was in
  Molly&rsquo;s boudoir was home-made, and some of it by her own hands. Yet
  until Mrs. See had taken her to Flagerstown she had been contented in this
  loft. But then she had been a good many things before that lamentable
  visit.</p>

  <p>At any rate, Molly kept her cubbyhole, as she called it, clean and neat,
  and fragrant with the scent of pine and spruce boughs, upon which she spread
  her blankets. She lay down there now and tried to puzzle a way through the
  maze of circumstances which seemed to have involved her.</p>

  <p>Following her mother&rsquo;s call to supper, Molly heard Arch&rsquo;s
  slow, clinking footfall. When he wore moccasins he could not be heard at
  all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Molly?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She got huffy because I asked her a question
  an&rsquo; flounced out somewhere,&rdquo; replied the mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some of your questions are shore irritatin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
  Arch. &ldquo;What was thet particular one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She came home red in the face and panting, and when I told her it
  had taken her a long time to go to the store, she said she&rsquo;d been
  waylaid by a bully of a cowpuncher. Then I asked her
  &lsquo;who?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. I reckon the gurl&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; too big an&rsquo;
  pretty to be alone on the trails,&rdquo; returned the son, ponderingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Big! She&rsquo;s only a mite, an&rsquo; not so awful
  pretty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly is no kid any more. You can bet I&rsquo;m findin&rsquo; thet
  out. An&rsquo; as fer bein&rsquo; pretty&mdash;where&rsquo;s your eyes, ma? I
  heah she beat them Flag gurls all hollow at the fair dance. I heah a
  lot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never hear anything,&rdquo; complained Mrs. Dunn.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck in this cabin from sunup till dark. I want to get away
  before I die on my feet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly had heard such ranting of her mother&rsquo;s for years, but she was
  stunned to hear Arch reply that maybe soon they would be able to move away
  from the Cibeque.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch! What&rsquo;ve you done now?&rdquo; queried the mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; jest yet. But I reckon to make a stake
  soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&mdash;Call the girl to supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Arch stepped to the end of the porch and called, &ldquo;Hey,
  Mol.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly thought best to answer sleepily: &ldquo;Yes, Arch. Heah I am. What
  you want?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Supper, you wood-mouse,&rdquo; he replied, and he waited by the
  ladder to give her a slap and then lift her down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No kid no more! Mol, you&rsquo;re as heavy as a sack of
  beans.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore, an&rsquo; worth aboot as much,&rdquo; retorted Molly.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re plumb interested in me lately, Arch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep. I am, more&rsquo;n you&rsquo;d guess,&rdquo; he replied.
  &ldquo;You an&rsquo; me are goin&rsquo; to have a little confab after
  supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly looked straight into his piercing eyes, though she felt her face
  burn and her nerves quiver. However she did not reply. She carried her
  father&rsquo;s meal to him and placed the board across the arms of his
  chair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lass, what&rsquo;s Arch jawin&rsquo; you aboot?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea, dad. He&rsquo;s got one of his
  spells.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much goin&rsquo; on heah,&rdquo; declared Dunn.
  &ldquo;They all think I&rsquo;m blind, settin&rsquo; on this porch. But my
  eyes are good yet for cattle-rustlers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly saw Arch lift his lean head with the action of an eagle, and give
  his father a dark look. She felt perturbed herself at her father&rsquo;s
  pointed remark, though now and then he would make some caustic allusion to
  the movements of cattlemen.</p>

  <p>He hated them, and made little distinction between ranchers and rustlers.
  His day had been one when sheep held the range. Molly ate her supper in
  silence, which, in fact, was what they all did.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, sister, you can have a walk with <i>me</i>,&rdquo; said Arch,
  dryly, as he got up from the table.</p>

  <p>Molly did not need to look at him again. She knew there was something in
  the wind, but she felt only half frightened. Arch was a puzzle lately. She
  walked beside him as he led her along the edge of the field toward the creek.
  The heat of the day was gone; the sun had sunk, yet the top of the Diamond
  blazed gold and red; there were deer in the pasture with the cows; somewhere
  a burro brayed shrilly. When Arch got to the head of the trail where it led
  down into the glen toward the spring he halted and said: &ldquo;Reckon this
  is far enough. No one can heah you if you do squawk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, you&rsquo;re not a bit funny,&rdquo; replied Molly.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; you cain&rsquo;t make me squawk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who was the bully of a cowboy thet waylaid you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hackamore Jocelyn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckoned so. On your way home from the store? I seen you go out
  the back trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. He must have seen me, too, for he waited along the
  trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, what&rsquo;d he do, Mol?&rdquo; went on Arch.</p>

  <p>He was hard to penetrate, yet so far Molly had no great misgivings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, I don&rsquo;t <i>have</i> to tell you everythin&rsquo; or
  anythin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said, steadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon you don&rsquo;t, to be fair aboot it. But you ought to. Poor
  ole dad is done, an&rsquo;, wal, I reckon ma&rsquo;s no good. I&rsquo;m no
  good, either, fer thet matter. But I&rsquo;m your brother, Molly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She had never heard him speak like that before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, you&mdash;you don&rsquo;t trust me,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell! It&rsquo;s only the last few days thet I seen you was old
  enough to mistrust.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;how can I confide in you?&rdquo; she asked, simply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, are you goin&rsquo; to make me choke thin&rsquo;s out of
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not anxious aboot it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, then, are you sweet on this Diamond cowboy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; rejoined Molly, with a titter.</p>

  <p>He laughed, too. &ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s one on me. But fer the moment I mean
  this heah Jocelyn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly told him bluntly just what she thought of Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll be dog-goned. I been given to believe you was sweet
  on him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who told you, Arch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It come round aboot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody lied. I haven&rsquo;t any use for Jocelyn. If you want to
  know, I&rsquo;ll give you the straight goods aboot him&mdash;so far as I am
  concerned&mdash;but, Arch, I&rsquo;d a good deal rather not tell
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;if you&rsquo;re willin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;ll make you mad, an&rsquo; probably run you into
  another fight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, it&rsquo;s no shore bet thet Jocelyn an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t
  fight, anyhow. Seth has been talkin&rsquo; too much for Jocelyn. He&rsquo;s
  too anxious. There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; up. It looks to me like Jocelyn
  wants to double-cross the Diamond an&rsquo; somehow throw in with the
  Cibeque. I&rsquo;m not shore. But I don&rsquo;t take to the puncher. Mebbe
  I&rsquo;m cross-grained. Mebbe it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s throwed a gun
  heah an&rsquo; there. All the same, if he&rsquo;d double-cross Traft
  he&rsquo;d shore do the same by us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Long before Arch had concluded that speech, Molly had made her decision to
  be honest&mdash;to hold back nothing, though at the suspicion he might
  presently ask pertinently about Jim Traft her heart came into her throat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, you&rsquo;re on the track,&rdquo; she replied, swiftly.
  &ldquo;Jocelyn has quit the Diamond. Had a fight with&mdash;Jim Traft, he
  said, an&rsquo; jumped at a chance to quit. He had a black eye, a cut lip,
  an&rsquo; some other fist marks. An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; Here
  Molly paused to relieve the oppression in her breast, and failed to do it.
  &ldquo;Jocelyn tried to bully me into lyin&rsquo; to you. Wanted me to tell
  you he&rsquo;d quit the Diamond because&mdash;because Jim Traft had insulted
  me. Then he could throw a gun on Traft!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Slinger Dunn whistled long and low, and afterward muttered a deep curse.
  His brown hand shot out like the strike of a snake and snapped a dead twig of
  cedar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, you&rsquo;ve shore cleared up part of this heah deal,&rdquo;
  he said, gratefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a hundred Jocelyn aimed to throw
  in with the Cibeque.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said, Arch,&rdquo; rejoined Molly, and
  impelled by released emotion, she began at the point when Jocelyn waylaid her
  on the trail and recalled every word and action of that encounter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So much fer Hackamore Jocelyn,&rdquo; muttered Dunn. &ldquo;I
  wonder now&mdash;I jest wonder what cairds Seth holds&mdash;or if it is his
  deal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust Seth Haverly with his grandma&rsquo;s
  spectacles,&rdquo; said Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Molly, mebbe I&rsquo;d better take your hunch. But I
  cain&rsquo;t believe Seth would double-cross me, leastways with a puncher
  from the Diamond. An&rsquo; thet brings us to real talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly had only to look up to realize that herself. Dunn fastened a hand in
  her blouse, so close and tight as to pinch her neck, and with a slow pull he
  drew her up so that her eyes were scarcely a foot from his.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I heah aboot Jim Traft insultin&rsquo;
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what you heahed, Arch&mdash;but
  it&rsquo;s a lie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you meet him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, at the fair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; went to thet dance with him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no. I went with Mrs. See.... But Jim Traft came&mdash;an&rsquo;
  I&mdash;I danced with him once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s all? You wasn&rsquo;t out in the moonlight
  with him, on the porch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;we walked out a&mdash;a little.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he grabbed you an&rsquo; hugged you?&rdquo; demanded
  Dunn, leaning down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Y-yes, Arch&mdash;he did,&rdquo; whispered Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You let him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s big an&rsquo; strong.... What could I&mdash;I do? But at
  that I slapped him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which was proof you felt insulted. So how&rsquo;s it come you say
  you wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen&mdash;Arch&mdash;an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t choke me,&rdquo; she
  gasped. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t honest with him. The truth is&mdash;I
  took to him&mdash;somethin&rsquo; outrageous. An&rsquo; he must have guessed
  it.... But when he&mdash;he had me in his arms&mdash;I hit him. I&mdash;I
  wanted him to believe I <i>was</i> insulted. He&rsquo;d taken me for a girl
  far above one from the Cibeque.... But I really wasn&rsquo;t
  insulted&mdash;an&rsquo; when I hit him I wasn&rsquo;t honest.
  An&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly reached the subtlety of a woman in her instinct to protect Jim
  Traft. And she seemed to divine that her brother might not know more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Took to him somethin&rsquo; outrageous!&rdquo; ejaculated Arch,
  incredulously. &ldquo;Molly Dunn!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Molly Dunn,&rdquo; retorted Molly, gaining courage with
  resentment. &ldquo;Even if I do belong to the Dunns of the Cibeque I&rsquo;ve
  got a heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t blamin&rsquo; you, Mol,&rdquo; he returned, as if
  realizing the inevitableness of the fact, and he let go of her.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only a kid. An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s shore a
  good-lookin&rsquo; fellar. An&rsquo; he can talk. But, Molly, the thing is
  he&rsquo;s old Jim Traft&rsquo;s kin. He&rsquo;s worth a million. An&rsquo;
  he couldn&rsquo;t have no honest intent toward you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no fool, Arch, if I am a kid,&rdquo; she rejoined.
  &ldquo;I know when a man means bad by me. Lord knows I&rsquo;ve had reason
  to. I shore knew today when Jocelyn grabbed me.... But Jim Traft didn&rsquo;t
  mean bad. I swear it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, he must have talked you out of your haid,&rdquo; said Dunn,
  amazed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. He didn&rsquo;t waste any time talkin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;d hardly
  got out in the moonlight. It was that white dress, Arch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What white dress?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The one Mrs. See bought for me. It&rsquo;s lovely.
  He&mdash;they&mdash;everybody there said I looked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You poor kid! Mebbe they was all to blame. Damn thet See woman,
  anyway.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, let me put on the dress for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I don&rsquo;t need any white dress to know how pretty you
  are.... An&rsquo; I reckon I hold ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; Traft your
  defendin&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not fair, Arch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his shaggy head doggedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cain&rsquo;t tell me honest thet Jim Traft didn&rsquo;t make
  you feel you was Molly Dunn of the Cibeque.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Arch, I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t. He did. He was shore surprised.
  An&rsquo; he let out what he thought. Afterward he tried to&mdash;to soften
  it. But&mdash;but then my heart was broke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dunn made a swifter and more expressive movement of his hand, passionate
  and vindictive.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hurtin&rsquo; your feelin&rsquo;s thet way is a wuss insult than
  huggin&rsquo; you,&rdquo; he declared, with a note of pathos in his
  anger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It hurt like sixty, Arch. But he didn&rsquo;t mean it. There is a
  difference between Molly Dunn of the Cibeque an&rsquo; Jim Traft from the
  East&mdash;rich, educated, with family name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. You said it, Molly. Family name. You&rsquo;re daughter of old
  John Dunn. An&rsquo; sister to Slinger Dunn!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told him that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before or after?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was after, of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore it was. No, Mol, there ain&rsquo;t no overlookin&rsquo; thet.
  He was only playin&rsquo; with you. Shore, in some safer place he&rsquo;d
  gone farther. Made a hussy of you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>No!</i>&rdquo; cried Molly, poignantly, as if at the thrust of a
  blade.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re givin&rsquo; it away thet you&rsquo;d let
  him go as far as he liked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Arch! How can you&mdash;talk so!&rdquo; sobbed Molly.
  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie. <i>You&rsquo;re</i> insultin&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head gloomily, and averted his blazing eyes, to hide their
  thought from her. Then he strode away, leaving her there trembling and
  stricken.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR days Molly lived in a perpetual state of nervous dread
  of events that had cast their shadows.</p>

  <p>Arch remained in one of his brooding moods. He worked in the fields as if
  to make up for lost time. And he did not go to the village in the evenings.
  The Haverlys rode over every day or so and engaged him in long talks, which
  left Arch more taciturn than ever.</p>

  <p>Then one morning when Molly came down she saw Arch&rsquo;s horse saddled
  and carrying a small pack.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where are you goin&rsquo;, Arch?&rdquo; she asked, at
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up on the Diamond, an&rsquo; I reckon you better stick around
  home,&rdquo; he replied, gruffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you&mdash;goin&rsquo; for?&rdquo; she dared ask.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, fer one thing, to see if this outfit is lyin&rsquo; to me. I
  didn&rsquo;t tell you thet Seth an&rsquo; his new pard swear they posted a
  notice up north of the Diamond. They laid down the law fer thet drift fence.
  The Cibeque wouldn&rsquo;t stand fer the fence goin&rsquo; farther than the
  haid of East Fork. Thet&rsquo;s in the saddle just under the Diamond.
  An&rsquo; if it was built farther it&rsquo;d be laid down pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What else you goin&rsquo; for?&rdquo; added Molly, anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon you ought to know,&rdquo; he replied, with a dark
  glance on her.</p>

  <p>Molly in trepidation followed him out to his horse, where her mother would
  not hear. She laid a trembling hand on him, as he was about to mount. She did
  not know what to say. But terror of something possessed her. &ldquo;Arch, if
  you really love me you&mdash;you won&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stared down at her, arrested by her agitation if not her words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who ever said anythin&rsquo; aboot me lovin&rsquo; you?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No one. But you <i>do</i>, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she implored.
  &ldquo;Somebody must love me or&mdash;or I cain&rsquo;t live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem to&rsquo;ve been tolerable healthy all along,&rdquo; he
  drawled. Nevertheless, he evaded the question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only you to help me, Arch,&rdquo; she went on, swiftly.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; hard not to run true to what they expect of
  Molly Dunn. An&rsquo; I can be drove too far. I&rsquo;ll hate you if&mdash;if
  you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he was flint. Molly gathered that her emotion somehow augmented his
  suspicion of her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have run true to the Dunns, I reckon,&rdquo; he replied,
  bitterly, and rode away.</p>

  <p>Molly hid up in the loft, tormented beyond endurance. When she could stand
  it up there no longer she climbed down and went out to look for her horse.
  She had not done her errands by horseback for a year or more, for the very
  good reason that she had no saddle and would not be seen in the village
  without one. The dignity of sixteen years had been embarrassing in many ways.
  Molly had ridden bareback since she was big enough to get on a horse.</p>

  <p>She found the pony in the unfenced north end of the clearing. He was wild
  and she did not easily corner him. But finally, when she had him and was
  patting his neck she wondered what she had wanted him for. And she seemed
  struck with the fact that it was not beyond her to ride up on the Diamond to
  warn Jim Traft his life might be in danger. But worried as Molly was, she did
  not think that so dire a thing would threaten until the drift fence actually
  crossed the Diamond. Down in the valley the opinion was general that the
  barbed wire would never go so far. Moreover, Molly remembered more than once
  when Slinger Dunn had ridden off with intent to fight, and this morning he
  had not been like that.</p>

  <p>Three days later, while Molly was in the village with her mother, she
  heard that her brother was there, drunk and quarrelsome. At the store she met
  Andy Stoneham, who was a clerk for Enoch Summers. While waiting upon Molly,
  he contrived to whisper: &ldquo;Heaps goin&rsquo; on, an&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t
  I better come out tonight?&rdquo; Molly nodded, and joined her mother,
  conscious of a sinking sensation in her breast.</p>

  <p>Old Enoch was full of talk. &ldquo;High jinks goin&rsquo; on around West
  Fork. Hain&rsquo;t been so busy since last fall round-up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; queried Mrs. Dunn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cattle movin&rsquo;. Riders comin&rsquo; through.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This time of year! Well, that&rsquo;s strange.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it is, Mrs. Dunn. An&rsquo; we can lay it to thet drift fence.
  Did you heah the latest aboot Jim Traft?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d I ever hear any news?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly felt the blood tingle in her cheeks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s shore news,&rdquo; replied the storekeeper.
  &ldquo;Young Traft has had notices put up thet he&rsquo;d make no claim to
  cattle already drifted down into Sycamore Canyon. His drift fence has crossed
  the head of Sycamore an&rsquo; is now out on the Diamond.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, is that all the news?&rdquo; declared Mrs. Dunn,
  indifferently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, most folks is agreed thet Jim Traft was shore more than square
  to the Cibeque when he done thet,&rdquo; went on Summers. &ldquo;Mebbe
  there&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n a thousand haid of steers, let alone cows
  an&rsquo; calves, in the brakes of Sycamore. Seth Haverly an&rsquo; his
  outfit sold near two hundred two-year-olds hyar yesterday. Forty-eight
  dollars a head! An&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve gone back fer another drive. Reckon
  they&rsquo;ll have most of thet stock, before the other boys get wind of
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forty-eight a head!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Dunn, who appeared to be
  conjuring with figures. &ldquo;Arch was in on that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it seems not. He&rsquo;s had a fall-out with the Cibeque, or
  somethin&rsquo;. Anyway, he was in town last night. It was Slinger who busted
  in here with news thet the drift fence had reached Tobe&rsquo;s Well. It
  shore upset all reckonin&rsquo;s around West Fork. Tobe&rsquo;s Well is way
  out on the Diamond.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While her mother completed her purchases, Molly waited in the grip of
  conflicting feelings. She could not help a thrill to hear Jim Traft kindly
  spoken of, nor a start at the information he had passed Sycamore Canyon with
  his fence. This was the dead line drawn by the riders of the brakes. Traft
  had disregarded their notice.</p>

  <p>Molly calculated that he was then actually within ten miles of West Fork,
  and not more than forty, to the east end of the Diamond. She had ridden up
  and down the brakes of Beaver Canyon and knew the trail to Tobe&rsquo;s Well.
  She had also been over the Derrick Trail once, but had no confidence that she
  could remember how to find it.</p>

  <p>After supper that evening she waited at the gate for Andy, something she
  had never before done, and she knew he would make stock of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; he ejaculated, when he arrived to beam upon her with
  his homely face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s different when you want suthin&rsquo; of
  somebody, ain&rsquo;t it, Molly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon so, Andy. You see what bein&rsquo; friendly does.
  I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; a heap of worryin&rsquo; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m just
  low-down enough to want your help.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;ve cause to worry, Molly Dunn,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of sight somewhere. I&rsquo;m plumb scared of thet
  Hackamore Jocelyn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly led him back of the cabin along the edge of the clearing to the
  creek and halted beside a huge fallen pine. The amber creek babbled over the
  rocks below; the squirrels and jays were noisy; the woods was full of the
  golden glow of sunset.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, last night I happened on suthin&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s got me
  scared stiff,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;After work hours I went up the crick to
  ketch a mess of trout. An&rsquo; as I was comin&rsquo; back along the crick
  trail I seen Seth Haverly an&rsquo; some riders. I ducked into the brush
  an&rsquo; squatted down. I reckoned they&rsquo;d pass. But I&rsquo;m a
  son-of-a-gun if they didn&rsquo;t stop in a little glade not forty steps from
  where I hid. With Seth was his brother Sam, an&rsquo; Hack Jocelyn. The
  Haverlys stayed in their saddles, but Jocelyn got off. He acted oneasy.
  An&rsquo; he walked up an&rsquo; down the trail. They was waitin&rsquo; fer
  some one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it was Slinger,&rdquo; said Molly, who sometimes in
  excitement used her brother&rsquo;s sobriquet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It shore was. Wal, fust off, Jocelyn swore Slinger wouldn&rsquo;t
  come, an&rsquo; Seth said he would.... Molly, they stayed there till dark
  an&rsquo; I could repeat every blame word they said. But heah short an&rsquo;
  sweet is what it all means.... Hack Jocelyn has got in with the Cibeque
  outfit, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;re aimin&rsquo; to double-cross Slinger.
  They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to cut the drift fence an&rsquo; lay the blame on
  to Slinger. They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to kidnap Jim Traft an&rsquo; squeeze a
  big ransom out of his uncle. Thet&rsquo;s the stake Jocelyn is playin&rsquo;
  fer. But I seen, if Seth couldn&rsquo;t, thet Hack is playin&rsquo; a deeper
  game than they savvy. Mebbe Slinger is on to him.&rsquo;Cause Slinger
  wouldn&rsquo;t heah of Jocelyn throwin&rsquo; in the Cibeque. He
  wouldn&rsquo;t go in the cattle drive they&rsquo;re plannin&rsquo;. Thet all
  came out in their talk before Slinger got there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;did he come?&rdquo; cried Molly, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep. Jest before dark. Hart Merriwell an&rsquo; Boyd Flick was with
  him. &lsquo;Seth,&rsquo; says Slinger, cool-like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
  splittin&rsquo; with the Cibeque. No hard feelin&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;ve got
  mebbe a better man than me in Jocelyn. Anyway, I cain&rsquo;t take the share
  of this cattle money you sent me. Much obliged, Seth. An&rsquo; heah it
  is.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; then Seth says,&rdquo; went on Andy, after a pause.
  &lsquo;All right, Slinger. You&rsquo;re shore your own boss. An&rsquo; if
  there&rsquo;s no hard feelin&rsquo;s on your side there&rsquo;s shore none on
  mine. But you ought to come in on thet kidnappin&rsquo; deal. Why, it&rsquo;s
  a gold-mine. Old Jim Traft won&rsquo;t blink an eye at a hundred
  thousand.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger owned it was a pretty slick deal an&rsquo; easy money, but
  he jest couldn&rsquo;t see it thet way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An&rsquo; why in hell not?&rsquo; asked Seth, sore as a
  pup.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wal,&rsquo; says Slinger, &lsquo;I reckon there&rsquo;s
  more&rsquo;n one reason. But particular with me is thet I happen to be
  goin&rsquo; to shoot Jim Traft.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So we figgered,&rsquo; says Seth, &lsquo;but cain&rsquo;t
  you wait till we&rsquo;ve got thet ransom money?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nope,&rsquo; replies Slinger. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the
  deal. An&rsquo; if I happen to run into any of you Cibeque gents up on the
  Diamond, I&rsquo;ll take particular offense. Savvy thet?&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We ain&rsquo;t deaf, Slinger. But I, fer one, am shore plumb
  surprised,&rsquo; answers Seth, slick-like.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wal,&rsquo; went on Slinger, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been sort of
  surprised myself, lately.&rsquo; ... An&rsquo; he shore said it full of
  meanin&rsquo;. Slinger rode away then, an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You heahed all this last night?&rdquo; interrupted Molly,
  poignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, before sundown.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But we heahed Slinger was drunk!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nary drunk. Somebody lied to you. He was as cool an&rsquo; hard as
  ice. Those fellars was scared of him, Molly. I haven&rsquo;t seen him since.
  Now to go on with what happened. You never heerd such cussin&rsquo;. Some
  from Seth an&rsquo; most from Jocelyn. Then they got their haids together
  again. It was all right with them aboot Slinger goin&rsquo; to kill young
  Traft. But they didn&rsquo;t want that to spoil their stake. An&rsquo; they
  reckoned they&rsquo;d have to give up the ransom idee. Hack Jocelyn busts in
  then with another. An&rsquo; it was that if Slinger did queer their kidnap
  deal by killin&rsquo; Traft, they&rsquo;d have a chanct to rustle a big bunch
  of stock an&rsquo; lay thet on to Slinger also. This struck Seth an&rsquo;
  his brother all right. An&rsquo; they won over the other two fellars. Then
  they started off. One of the horses must have smelled me fer he shied
  an&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t come far from jumpin&rsquo; on me.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Somethin&rsquo; in thet brush,&rsquo; said Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By this time I was pretty scared an&rsquo; I up an&rsquo; tore
  through the brush. Mebbe Jocelyn didn&rsquo;t let out a roar. An&rsquo; he
  shot three times after me. I don&rsquo;t want no bullets closer to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Andy, they&rsquo;ll find you out,&rdquo; cried Molly,
  fearfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, mebbe, but I don&rsquo;t see how they can. I&rsquo;d hate to
  have thet Hack Jocelyn meet up with me very soon, an&rsquo; you bet
  I&rsquo;ll see him fust.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Jim Traft will never see Slinger first,&rdquo; wailed
  Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon not. Molly, ain&rsquo;t you a little over-concerned aboot
  Traft?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No more than I am about Slinger,&rdquo; retorted Molly.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful mess. Oh, Andy, what can I do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do? Good Heavens! gurl, you cain&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
  he declared. And his idea of the enormity of such a supposition made Molly
  conscious of her helplessness. Yet could she not ride up to Tobe&rsquo;s
  Well, find the Diamond camp, and save Jim Traft from both her brother and the
  Haverlys with their new and treacherous ally? Tobe&rsquo;s Well was only ten
  miles. She could ride there and back in less than half a day. If she once
  eluded Slinger! But she would have to wait until he left, for he might come
  home any time, and he would find her trail and run her down. It was not
  conceivable that he would ride directly into the Diamond camp bent on his
  deadly intent. Slinger was slow to act upon any project, secretive and wary.
  Like an Indian he would watch the trails.</p>

  <p>Andy, roused to a sense of his importance, repeated parts of his story,
  and then guardedly leaned toward the possibility of telling Slinger of the
  plot against him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, you might let on you heerd all this yourself,&rdquo;
  continued Andy. &ldquo;I reckon Slinger would believe you. Shore he would.
  An&rsquo; thet&rsquo;d let me out. I&rsquo;m plumb afraid of Hackamore
  Jocelyn. He&rsquo;s got it in fer me because of you. Aw, I figgered thet. He
  only had to look at me onct.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Andy, I&rsquo;ll not give you away,&rdquo; said Molly, earnestly.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m shore owin&rsquo; you a good deal.... Yes, I ought
  to tell Slinger. Oh, I must think.... Andy, I&rsquo;ll go back now. I
  don&rsquo;t want to risk missin&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They walked through the woods in the gloaming, and Molly did not repulse
  Andy when he timidly took her hand. He deserved some recompense for his
  interest in her brother&rsquo;s fortunes and his loyalty to her.</p>

  <p>She went as far as the gate with him. &ldquo;Andy, you&rsquo;ve been good
  to me lately,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I like you for it. I
  haven&rsquo;t a friend in all this valley, unless it&rsquo;s you. I wish I
  could be more to you. But I&mdash;I cain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bidding him good night, she ran back to the cabin. It was quite dark under
  the porch. No lamp had been lighted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You better come a-runnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; came in slow, cool voice
  from the gloom. &ldquo;Who was thet with you? Looked like Andy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Arch&mdash;&rdquo; panted Molly, feeling her way to the
  porch. &ldquo;Yes, it was Andy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You like thet fellar?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;more than I used to&mdash;which wasn&rsquo;t
  much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Andy ain&rsquo;t as no-good as some of them. He works.
  An&rsquo; he doesn&rsquo;t guzzle drink all the time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, are you goin&rsquo; to be home a while now?&rdquo; asked
  Molly, sitting down beside him. She bumped against his gun, which contact
  gave her an icy little shudder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pa had one of his sinkin&rsquo; spells tonight,&rdquo; said Arch,
  ignoring her query.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He looked bad today,&rdquo; rejoined Molly, sighing.
  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s ma?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She got him to bed an&rsquo; I reckon she&rsquo;s in there.... I
  been sittin&rsquo; heah thinkin&rsquo;, Molly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What aboot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, fer once not aboot my own damn self. Pa&rsquo;s failin&rsquo;,
  an&rsquo; ma&rsquo;s thet contrary. Course I&rsquo;m home so little it
  don&rsquo;t matter. But it&rsquo;s tough on you, Molly. What&rsquo;re you
  goin&rsquo; to do soon&mdash;when we bust up?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Arch!&rdquo; faltered Molly, and she felt for his hand,
  slipping hers into it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Might as well face it,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  goin&rsquo; to get killed or have to leave the Cibeque country. Pa
  won&rsquo;t last long. An&rsquo; ma will go back to Illinois. Will you go
  with her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly pondered a long moment. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if she didn&rsquo;t
  make me. I&rsquo;d hate to leave heah.... Arch, I can get work in
  Flag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. An&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t a bad idee. But don&rsquo;t get any
  moonshine idees in your haid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you mean, Arch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, aboot Jim Traft. Because you&rsquo;ll be in fer a heap more
  hurt than you&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly had fortified herself for the very thing hinted in his slow drawl,
  nevertheless it made her blood run cold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shore in for more hurt any way you look at it,&rdquo;
  said Molly, sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Natural like. Life ain&rsquo;t no <i>fiesta</i> fer the Dunns... .
  If I&rsquo;d only knowed when I was a kid what I know now!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly thought the moment propitious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, the Cibeque outfit is goin&rsquo; to double-cross you. Hack
  Jocelyn is at the bottom of it. But Seth Haverly is as treacherous. They want
  you to throw in with them an&rsquo; kidnap Jim Traft. Hold him for ransom.
  Course you know this, because you refused to be in it. But there&rsquo;s a
  lot you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you darned little wood-mouse!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;You
  was there last night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, I heahed more&rsquo;n you,&rdquo; she replied, evasively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. What was thet shootin&rsquo; aboot, after I
  left?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hack Jocelyn heahed a noise in the brush an&rsquo; shot three
  times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal! I come darn near ridin&rsquo; back.... Molly, what did you
  heah?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Briefly then she told him what had happened along the trail, as related by
  Andy; and though the supposition was that she had been there she actually did
  not lie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; muttered Slinger Dunn, and he held her hand
  tight. &ldquo;I had a hunch. I didn&rsquo;t trust Jocelyn. But thet Seth
  could be so low-down! My Gawd!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, it couldn&rsquo;t be no worse,&rdquo; went on Molly, in
  agitation. &ldquo;They mean to cut the drift fence an&rsquo; lay it on to
  you. An&rsquo; if the ransom deal falls through&mdash;owin&rsquo; to you
  killin&rsquo; Jim Traft&mdash;they&rsquo;ll rustle a big bunch of cattle.
  An&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll all be laid on you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She felt him freeze, and he was silent so long that she could not restrain
  an appeal for him to abandon an idea of revenge and to go away somewhere.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; leave it easy fer them?&rdquo; he queried, harshly.
  &ldquo;I know their deal now.... I&rsquo;ll settle with them
  afterward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He slipped off the porch. His moccasined feet made no sound and his dark
  form vanished in the gloom. Molly clapped a hand over her mouth. Of what
  avail to call out! Shaken and wretched, she climbed to her loft and crawled
  to her bed. Through the hours of distress that followed, one growing resolve
  at last found permanence, and then she slept.</p>

  <p>In the gray of dawn she was peering down from the loft, watching Slinger
  Dunn&mdash;when on the first time for long he rolled out of his bed on the
  porch and pulled on his boots and buckled on his spurs and
  gun-belt&mdash;when he slipped off in the gloom to return with his
  horse&mdash;when he packed blankets and biscuit and meat, and then rode away
  on his mission.</p>

  <p>Molly sat there, thinking out her plan. She would let Slinger get some
  miles ahead, then she would follow, climb the Diamond, and when some distance
  from Tobe&rsquo;s Well she would make a detour and hit the trail beyond
  Traft&rsquo;s camp, and ride back to it. She could hardly get lost, going
  only a short way from the trail. The peril lay in being discovered by
  Slinger. He would probably half kill her. But if she accomplished her purpose
  and saved Jim Traft from his enemies, she did not care what Slinger might do.
  In fact, that would be the end of Molly Dunn in the Cibeque. She would be
  hated from one end of the valley to the other. Traitress! A little fool who
  betrayed her brother and her kind for love of a man who had only played with
  her! An object of scorn she would be, and so far as Seth Haverly and Hack
  Jocelyn were concerned, she would be marked for life. Molly knew the Cibeque.
  Seth Haverly would choke the very life out of her, and Hack Jocelyn would do
  worse. These convictions added to Molly&rsquo;s terror, yet in no wise
  changed her mind.</p>

  <p>Before her mother was up, Molly put on her buckskins and slipped down out
  of the loft with a blanket, which she carried out to the barn and strapped on
  her pony. She fed him grain. Then she coiled a lasso and tied it to the end
  of his halter.</p>

  <p>The sun was rising like a rose in the cloudless sky. Dark and wild loomed
  the Diamond. It seemed to call to Molly. Every moment added to her courage.
  She saw clearer the beauty and the good of her action, if it were successful.
  In time even her own people would see that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you up early for?&rdquo; demanded her mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you heah Slinger?&rdquo; asked Molly, who knew how to
  divert attention from herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t, and you quit calling him that name,&rdquo;
  returned Mrs. Dunn, garrulously. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you
  enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ma, if I guess right he&rsquo;s aimin&rsquo; to add more to what
  gave him that name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord help us!&rdquo; cried the mother, and she launched into a
  tirade against her son and ended against her husband and Molly and the
  low-down life in the brakes.</p>

  <p>That likewise strengthened Molly. She made another resolve. If she got out
  of this adventure alive, she would ride to Keech&rsquo;s and hire the boy
  there to drive her to Flagerstown. There she would go to work. Molly roused
  to a glamour over this enterprise.</p>

  <p>After breakfast, the first moment that offered, she ran to the barn, and
  leading Jigger out she mounted him and rode into the woods.</p>

  <p>Soon she came to the trail, in the dust of which she espied the tracks of
  Slinger&rsquo;s horse, and turning into it she rode north. Jigger was not
  shod and his hoofs padded softly. He could not be heard very far, and Molly
  vowed that she would see any rider before he saw her.</p>

  <p>It was still and cool in the forest, and she soon reached the zone where
  the Diamond cut off the morning sunlight. Here the dark shade was almost like
  twilight. The trail followed the creek and often crossed it. The amber water
  foamed around the boulders. Great gray rocks lined the banks, and above stood
  up the maples and oaks, and the lofty pines and spruces.</p>

  <p>At every turn of the trail Molly would peep around before going on.
  Always, too, she had a keen eye for Slinger&rsquo;s tracks. This was easy
  riding and there were miles of the gradual ascent before the trail entered
  one of the brakes, which was merely a local name for canyon. Open forest,
  with scarcely any brush, afforded vistas on all sides. Molly saw deer, but no
  cattle. She was still down out of the cattle zone.</p>

  <p>In a few miles the forest changed and thickened. The maples and oaks had
  been left behind. Clumps of young pine obstructed vision. The silver spruces
  began to lord it over the yellow pines. Manzanita appeared, and tufts of
  grass in open spots. Molly had difficulty in keeping the charm of the forest
  from breaking her vigilance. The wall of brown-streaked green rose on both
  sides. Through openings in the foliage she saw the lofty gray crags of the
  Diamond promontories. Soon she would be climbing in earnest, and then she
  must exercise extreme caution.</p>

  <p>Presently she missed Slinger&rsquo;s tracks in the dust of the trail.
  Molly rode back, bending in anxious scrutiny. She had been careless. Soon she
  found where he had turned out of the trail. Molly slipped off her horse. What
  could this mean? She dared not go on for fear she might get ahead of him.
  Perhaps he was going to climb the Diamond by a trail known only to himself.
  Molly stood in dismay, pondering the problem.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a rifle-shot clear and sharp up the trail gave her a violent
  start. A wild cry followed. Molly stood transfixed. Then came the clatter of
  rapid hoof beats. She drew her horse behind a thicket of pines.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM TRAFT, resting on the soft, fragrant matt behind a
  spruce tree, and waiting for the call to supper, inadvertently heard
  conversation most assuredly not intended for his ears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. You cain&rsquo;t deal no more cairds to me,&rdquo; Curly
  Prentiss was saying to some one. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take a hand in any more
  deals against the boss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Curly, we all reckon you wasn&rsquo;t at your best when he
  licked you,&rdquo; rejoined Uphill Frost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you&rsquo;d been drunk. An&rsquo; you know how weak likker
  makes you. An&rsquo; you was sort of in fun. You didn&rsquo;t get
  mad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A silence betrayed that no doubt this eloquence and persuasion were balm
  to Curly&rsquo;s wounded vanity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mebbe so. Dog-gone! ... But he hit me on the nose an&rsquo; seen
  how it hurt. Then he kept pokin&rsquo; me again right there. An&rsquo;
  thet&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;ll do to you, Up. He&rsquo;ll find out how
  anythin&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; your belly hurts you. Aw, you know you
  cain&rsquo;t even stand a tight belt. You&rsquo;ve et so many million
  sour-dough biscuits thet your insides is gone. An&rsquo; you, Jack Way, if
  you pick a fight with our boss, Gawd help you! Because you&rsquo;re all weak
  spots. You&rsquo;ve not got a well bone in your body. An&rsquo; ev&rsquo;ry
  time he cracks you with one of them big fists, you&rsquo;ll yell. I&rsquo;ll
  bet a month&rsquo;s pay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take you up. Heah thet, Frost,&rdquo; grumbled Way. &ldquo;Fact is,
  though, I&rsquo;m afeard he will lick me. He shore put it all over Lonestar
  last Saturday. But we gotta fight him. <i>Somebody</i> has gotta do it or the
  Diamond is done fer on the range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe sech talk!&rdquo; declared Curly.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; a big stunt with this fence. Boys, the boss is
  a chip of the old block.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hack Jocelyn says so an&rsquo; Hack&rsquo;s an old-timer
  heah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be smart not to listen to him,&rdquo; replied Curly, in
  lower tone. &ldquo;Hack&rsquo;s out fer trouble. Not fun! He&rsquo;s stuck on
  Molly Dunn an&rsquo; he cain&rsquo;t stand fer the Flag talk aboot the boss
  winnin&rsquo; Molly. There&rsquo;ll be a fight one of these days as will be a
  <i>real</i> one. An&rsquo; I wanna see it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Natural you&rsquo;d like to see Hack get licked proper,&rdquo;
  growled Frost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can shore bet on thet,&rdquo; said Curly, emphatically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you an&rsquo; Bud have double-crossed us,&rdquo; complained
  Jackson. &ldquo;Bud is clean out with it. He says: &lsquo;You can all go to
  hell. I&rsquo;m sidin&rsquo; with the boss.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, you cain&rsquo;t blame Bud much. The boss kept me out of
  jail, but thet ain&rsquo;t a marker to what he done fer Bud. An&rsquo; if you
  look back hasn&rsquo;t this heah Jim Traft done somethin&rsquo; fer each of
  us, &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; mebbe, Hack? Now I ask you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Both cowboys were significantly silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna pick a fight with him, anyway,&rdquo; concluded Up
  Frost. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sore at me an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll be easy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When you aim to pick it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had my mind made up more&rsquo;n onct. But when I get near the
  son-of-a-gun, I don&rsquo;t stick to it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. You jest cain&rsquo;t help likin&rsquo; Jim Traft. If Hack
  Jocelyn wasn&rsquo;t in the outfit we&rsquo;d all be fer the boss
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up, if you tackle him, I&rsquo;ll do it, too, soon&rsquo;s he licks
  you,&rdquo; put in Jackson Way. &ldquo;An&rsquo; mebbe we can get Cherry to
  try ag&rsquo;in, if he licks me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If? Haw! Haw! Say, you couldn&rsquo;t hire Cherry to stand up
  ag&rsquo;in under them sledge-hammer fists. Fer fact is he was sittin&rsquo;
  down all the time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we can get Hump to tackle it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He an&rsquo; Hump&rsquo;s been tolerable civil
  lately. It&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; on Hump.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, air you helpin&rsquo; to keep this outfit from
  bustin&rsquo;?&rdquo; queried Frost, scornfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon I am,&rdquo; replied Prentiss, in colder knife-edged tone.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; you can expect trouble between me an&rsquo; Jocelyn any
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell you say!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Jack, I told you.... Let&rsquo;s go an&rsquo; try to talk Hump
  into suthin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cowboys strolled away into camp, arguing and complaining, while Jim
  Traft lay there amused and touched and singularly pleased. This incident
  occurred at a camp on Pine Creek in the forest on what was called the Saddle.
  It lay half way between Black Butte and the Diamond. Not for weeks had Jim
  seen or heard anything so encouraging to him. He could not contain his
  delight. The drift fence was going on. He had not been in Flagerstown for
  weeks, but letters from his uncle kept him informed of the news at that end
  of the fence. He had long since worked and ridden out the soreness of muscle
  and bone, that had made him suffer so excruciatingly. He was now strong and
  hard. He could stick in a saddle. He could dig fence-post holes all day. In
  truth he seemed vastly changed and improved, and almost happy, despite
  periodic spells of depression. The months did not pale Molly Dunn&rsquo;s
  charm.</p>

  <p>The call to supper disturbed Jim&rsquo;s reverie. He got up, and keeping
  the thick, low-spreading spruce tree between him and camp he walked off into
  the woods, and circling, came back to camp on the other side. Meantime he had
  evolved a plan to help Uphill Frost and Jackson Way to realize their
  ambitions in regard to a physical clash with him. The prospect simply filled
  him with glee.</p>

  <p>He found the boys at supper, and a sudden cessation of voices proved he
  had interrupted something unusual, for cowboys seldom talked during their
  brief mealtime.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry to spoil your talk, boys,&rdquo; he said, with sarcasm and
  putting on a severe face. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t go without my meals to let
  you gab about me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, you might flatter yourself,&rdquo; replied Bud Chalfack.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. But not this time,&rdquo; said Jim, as he surveyed the
  mask-like faces. &ldquo;Hack looks mighty innocent and indifferent. The rest
  of you, though, strike me bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We was only talkin&rsquo; aboot the fence,&rdquo; put in Frost.
  &ldquo;Me an&rsquo; Jack stand by our argyment of this mawnin&rsquo;.
  You&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; thet line wrong lately, keepin&rsquo; to this
  thick woods hyar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, tomorrow we&rsquo;ll run off a way, then, into the open
  draws. And I&rsquo;ll give you and Jack the job of digging post-holes for a
  few days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A long howl of mirth made the welkin ring. After that had subsided Uphill
  and Jackson rendered the air blue around camp.</p>

  <p>Jim stood it a while and then, though it was not out of the ordinary, he
  pretended to take exception to such profanity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shut your dirty mouths,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;If you want to
  rave you can do it without such cuss words.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wha-at!&rdquo; bawled Uphill. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this hyar a free
  range? Cain&rsquo;t I open my mouth?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you eat with it? This is supper time. And the rest
  of us are hungry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You heered thet, Jack,&rdquo; roared Up, in real or assumed
  wrath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shore did,&rdquo; yelled Jack.</p>

  <p>Whereupon the two of them burst out into another long string of profanity.
  Jim got up and deliberately punched Uphill in the mouth and then Jack. That
  certainly and effectually stilled the profanity, as well as all other
  vociferations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After supper I&rsquo;ll oblige you boys with all the satisfaction
  you want,&rdquo; said Jim, sitting down again.</p>

  <p>Uphill&rsquo;s face was brick red and he appeared about to explode.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet&mdash;you will&mdash;boss,&rdquo; he choked.</p>

  <p>Jackson Way bent thoughtfully over his supper, with the somber air of a
  boy who had been let into something unawares.</p>

  <p>Another silence fell. This time Hackamore Jocelyn broke it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So the Diamond&rsquo;s come to this!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in
  derision. &ldquo;My Gawd! no wonder we&rsquo;re the talk of the
  range.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim bent a clear straight gaze upon his one real enemy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn, the Diamond is doing fine, according to reports from
  Flag,&rdquo; he said, deliberately. &ldquo;And I can see how it could do
  better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. So can I,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn, with far less subtlety than
  Jim&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, hell,&rdquo; interposed Bud Chalfack, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t
  no outfit on the range thet could run this drift fence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, cowboy, you mean <i>would</i> run it, an&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s
  no lie,&rdquo; returned Jocelyn, sneeringly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All stale talk, Hack,&rdquo; spoke up Jim. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
  think of something new? I sure get tired of it. You&rsquo;ve got a reputation
  for hatching up tricks and deals. Why can&rsquo;t you be original in your
  gab? It&rsquo;d amuse us, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim had spoken cheerfully, yet with scintillating pointedness. And this
  remark fell like a blanket upon the company. Most of the cowboys took a bold
  look at Jocelyn, to see what effect this strong talk from the boss might
  have. Jocelyn&rsquo;s lean face paled and he bent over his plate. The tension
  relaxed, but Jim felt that he had inserted a wedge into the breach.</p>

  <p>Uphill Frost finished his meal in remarkably quick time for him. And he
  arose to make most elaborate preparations for the fray.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, tell me where you want your carcass planted,&rdquo; spoke up
  Bud, quizzically. &ldquo;An&rsquo; give me word to send home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That resurrected the humor of the cowboys, except in several
  instances.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Any money to bet, Up?&rdquo; inquired Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be fun,&rdquo; quoth Frost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should smile not. Lay you ten to one you cain&rsquo;t lick
  Jim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Jim!</i>&rdquo; ejaculated Uphill, with a fierce snort.
  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Jim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, our boss, you damn fule,&rdquo; replied Curly, innocently.</p>

  <p>Jim got up with alacrity, and threw off his vest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, you be my second,&rdquo; he said, cheerily. &ldquo;Fetch those
  soft gloves of mine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bud complied and Jim pulled them on. These were heavy, soft, woolen gloves
  that Jim wore occasionally.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lemme see? What&rsquo;s the idee of gloves?&rdquo; asked Uphill,
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you badly, Up. These gloves are like
  pads.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say. Wal, you might have a hoss-shoe or nail hid in
  them. Lemme see.... Ahuh, I&rsquo;ll take my chanct with your bare
  fists.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s get it over,&rdquo; said Jim, business like.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve fence to build, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a few passes at each other Uphill swung in like a snorting bull, and
  Jim making a feint with his right came up hard with his left. It connected.
  Bam!</p>

  <p>Up got rid of breath he could not retain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; yelled Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Got Up&rsquo;s bread-basket fust off,&rdquo; added Bud,
  merrily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fellars, we&rsquo;d better move back,&rdquo; suggested Cherry.
  &ldquo;Fer if the boss soaks him thar ag&rsquo;in we&rsquo;ll be
  dodgin&rsquo; biscuits.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Up had begun valiantly, evidently adhering to a preconceived plan of
  battle. Jackson Way behind him kept calling encouragements. They danced
  around, and presently Jim ran in to take a couple of blows in order to plant
  another, at the pit of Up&rsquo;s stomach. <i>Biff!</i> It had a solid sound.
  Up let out a groan. His face changed remarkably, and from that instant he
  became a changed man. He left his face and head wholly unguarded, endeavoring
  to stem the attack on his lower anatomy. Jim could have landed at will on
  nose or eye or chin. But he wanted to hit Up&rsquo;s weak spot and he fought
  accordingly. He got in two or three blows, glancing ones, and not quite on
  the mark. Yet they spread consternation and terror to poor Up&rsquo;s heart.
  He had nothing left to get enraged upon. He grew mortally afraid that he
  would sustain another blow in his vital spot. And he made a ludicrous
  spectacle.</p>

  <p>Hack Jocelyn stood in the background, smoking a cigarette, disdainful and
  aloof. The other cowboys, including Jackson Way, gave vent to their riotous
  feelings.</p>

  <p>Jim took the fight in hand then.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cussin&rsquo; cowpuncher,&rdquo; he said, imitating the
  vernacular of his men. &ldquo;You lazy hole-diggin&rsquo; gopher! Take this
  one in the gizzard.&rdquo; ... <i>Wham!</i> ... &ldquo;You bow-legged,
  biscuit-eatin&rsquo; rhinoosceross!&rdquo; ... Pop!&mdash;&ldquo;Right on the
  kisser! Forgot you had a face, hey, Up? Look out now.&rdquo; ... Crack!
  Smack! ... <i>Zugg!</i></p>

  <p>That last one, a solid blow over Up&rsquo;s rather stout middle, elicited
  an awful groan from him. He sagged, and bent forward like a jack-knife.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fer Gawd&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; gasped Up, his face convulsed.
  &ldquo;Boss, don&rsquo;t hit me&mdash;there&mdash;no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim lowered his fists and ceased prancing around the bewildered
  cowboy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. Have you got enough?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aplenty,&rdquo; groaned Up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, then, provided you call it square for keeps and shake
  hands. Otherwise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; interrupted Frost, hastily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ben
  ag&rsquo;in you, jest natural an&rsquo; cussed. But there was no sense in it.
  An&rsquo; hyar you are!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Uphill showed the true manliness back of his contrary, cowboy,
  cantankerous spirit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Jack, come on. It&rsquo;s the only way for us to settle the
  difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon so, boss,&rdquo; returned Jack, ruefully. &ldquo;But it
  ain&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? Sure, I didn&rsquo;t start this. If you want to
  apologize&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. I ain&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; back. But my pore
  body has too many sprains an&rsquo; dislocations an&rsquo; cracks to stand
  your hammerin&rsquo;. All the same, I&rsquo;ll take my medicine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he did take it, putting up a better fight than Frost&rsquo;s, though
  of obvious pain to himself and less fun for the cowboys. He brought the blood
  from Jim&rsquo;s nose, an inconsequential blow, yet one loudly applauded by
  his companions. Shortly after that Jim caught him in the ribs. Jack went down
  in a heap, rolled over, and laboriously sat up, his face ashen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim&mdash;it was&mdash;bad enough&mdash;hittin&rsquo; all my
  other&mdash;places,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;But them busted&mdash;ribs! I
  knowed you&rsquo;d find them.... Would you mind&mdash;callin&rsquo; it off
  fer keeps?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you want,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve bloodied
  my nose! And I reckon I&rsquo;d like to soak you some more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw no! Take it out on Hackamore,&rdquo; replied Jack, beseechingly,
  and he got up to offer his hand to Jim.</p>

  <p>His suggestion instantly charged the atmosphere with something more
  compelling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strikes me,&rdquo; said Jim, quickly. &ldquo;How about it, Jocelyn?
  You&rsquo;ve a sore head. You&rsquo;ve been mean and full of poison talk. And
  I haven&rsquo;t been as decent as I might have been. Let&rsquo;s have a whack
  at each other. It can&rsquo;t do any harm and it might do good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t soil my gloves on you, Mister Traft,&rdquo;
  drawled Jocelyn, with undisguised malignity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t you? I reckon you&rsquo;re thinking more of your
  handsome face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep, I ben told it&rsquo;s handsome lately, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
  shore keepin&rsquo; it so,&rdquo; returned Jocelyn, with caustic
  significance. No one there could have misinterpreted him.</p>

  <p>Jim bit his tongue. It was no time for him to say more or make a move.
  Jocelyn packed his gun and had the look of a man who would strain any chance
  to use it.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>That incident marked the definite break between Jim and Jocelyn. There was
  no hope of a better state of feeling. Jim hoped this disgruntled cowboy would
  keep to his threat to quit the Diamond. Both Bud and Curly had warned Jim to
  let Hack alone to take his own time. They assured Jim that Hack would go
  presently, but they could not quite figure just what he was up to. Jim was
  glad of their advice and this late evidence of friendship. It seemed, indeed,
  that Jocelyn was now the only thorn in the flesh of the Diamond. Day by day
  he became more alienated from Cherry Winters and Hump Stevens, who had been
  the last of his stand-bys.</p>

  <p>Another Saturday came. Some of the boys went to Flagerstown. Hack had
  disappeared before daylight, and according to Bud and Curly his horse tracks
  led south.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, he&rsquo;s gone to West Fork,&rdquo; claimed Bud, with a wise
  look.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore as you&rsquo;re born,&rdquo; agreed Curly, wagging his bright
  head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, let&rsquo;s ride down there, too,&rdquo; suggested Bud.</p>

  <p>The idea found favor with Curly, who looked at Jim for approval.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a bad idee, boss. We&rsquo;ll hit the Sycamore trail
  at Tobe&rsquo;s Well an&rsquo; go off the mountain there. Thet&rsquo;s aboot
  at the haid of the brakes. We&rsquo;ll get a line on driftin&rsquo; cattle,
  an&rsquo; mebbe other thin&rsquo;s, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Go, by all means,&rdquo; replied Jim, and he found himself fighting
  an almost irresistible longing to go with them.</p>

  <p>That was the longest week-end Jim had put in since his advent in Arizona.
  He was on pins and needles until Bud and Curly returned, late Sunday night.
  To his disappointment, they seemed uncommunicative and brought no news of any
  moment. They had not seen Hackamore Jocelyn. They did not mention either
  Slinger or Molly Dunn. They reported considerably more cattle than they had
  expected to run across. Numerous dead cows, and old carcasses, neither of
  which had been killed by wolves or lions, lying in the open along the trails,
  attested to a changed and startling condition of affairs since the drift
  fence had been started.</p>

  <p>Jim was too sick at heart to go into the subject of stolen stock any
  deeper that night. What had he expected of the boys? When he lay alone in the
  dark, his eyes peering through the canopy of foliage at the stars, he
  confessed to himself that he had yearned for even a word of Molly Dunn. Next
  morning at an opportune moment he asked Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore I seen Molly,&rdquo; replied the cowboy, frankly. &ldquo;At
  the village. But she didn&rsquo;t see me. Looked sweeter&rsquo;n a peach to
  me. Changed a little, though, somehow. Curly says so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything about Hack?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep. An&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t good news,&rdquo; replied Bud,
  soberly. &ldquo;Curly reckoned we&rsquo;d better not tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you might ride off down there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, tell me if there&rsquo;s anything to worry you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t worryin&rsquo; us exzactly,&rdquo; rejoined Bud,
  scratching his head. &ldquo;I wanted to tell you, an&rsquo; Curly talked
  ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn went to see Molly Dunn,&rdquo; asserted Jim, quietly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He shore did, which ain&rsquo;t none of our bizness, since thet
  little devil has no use for us. But, boss, this is damn queer. Hack is
  makin&rsquo; up to the Haverlys. An&rsquo; thet means the Cibeque
  outfit!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what of it? I wish he&rsquo;d quit us, as he&rsquo;s
  hinted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What of it? Gosh! I don&rsquo;t know. But if Hack quits us
  I&rsquo;ll shore tell you what Curly an&rsquo; I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Hackamore Jocelyn did not ride into camp until late Monday night. This was
  a break against rules, and Jim saw that the cowboys were keen to get his
  reaction to it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been, Jocelyn?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Down in the brakes to see my gurl,&rdquo; replied the cowboy,
  almost gayly. He had not been drinking. There seemed to be a singular elation
  or buoyancy about him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you get back Sunday night, same as Curly and Bud?
  They went down to West Fork.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell you say!&rdquo; In a twinkling Jocelyn was his old self.
  &ldquo;Wal, if you want to know I was havin&rsquo; too sweet a time with
  Molly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not inquiring into your private affairs,&rdquo; said Jim,
  coldly. &ldquo;But if you take another day off without permission, I&rsquo;ll
  fire you.... Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I ain&rsquo;t hard of hearin&rsquo;, Mister Traft,&rdquo;
  replied Jocelyn, softly.</p>

  <p>No more was said. Jocelyn ate his supper alone. The cowboys sat silent.
  Jim sought his bed presently, and tried to find ease from his pain in
  slumber.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The drift fence went on mile after mile, and one camp followed another.
  Three week-ends in succession Jocelyn rode down to West Fork, but on each
  occasion he returned some time late on Sunday night. The other cowboys ceased
  riding to Flagerstown. Curly and Bud rode off alone the second week-end,
  evidently bent on a mission of their own, which Jim guessed to be the
  movement of cattle, as well as of Hackamore Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>Early in August, Jim Traft, acting solely upon his own judgment and
  responsibility, celebrated his fencing off the many heads of Sycamore Canyon
  from the brakes of the Cibeque, by posting notices that the Diamond would lay
  no further claim to stock in and north of Sycamore, and west of the drift
  fence.</p>

  <p>It was a strategic move on Jim&rsquo;s part. It caught the fancy of every
  cowboy in his outfit, excepting Jocelyn, who, nevertheless, was staggered by
  it. Jim had just wanted to be generous to the riders down in the brakes. He
  had authority to do what he thought best. What did a few herds of cattle,
  more or less, matter to his uncle? But a singular reaction to this
  proclamation was the effect upon his cowboys and the several homesteaders
  living in the proscribed limits. Jim won his cowboys by that act, and further
  alienated Jocelyn. The homesteaders called at his camp, unmistakably friendly
  and grateful. They all profited by it. One of them told Bud that he could now
  make a good start at ranching.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was stealin&rsquo; a few cattle right along,&rdquo; vowed Bud.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; he admitted it. Any honest cattleman will admit he&rsquo;s
  run a few haid not strictly his.... Dog-gone it, boys, Jim Traft has hit one
  plumb center.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But so far as Jim was concerned this splendid news, which he knew would
  travel like wild-fire all over the range, was more than offset by
  Jocelyn&rsquo;s talk. The shrewd cowboy had divined how his talk about West
  Fork and Molly Dunn hurt Jim, and after that he kept everlastingly at it at
  meal hours or round the camp fire. At first it was just conceited comments
  upon his girl and her attachment to him. Gradually, however, it developed
  into vulgar parade of conquest, at which times Jim would make himself scarce.
  It threatened worse, and Jim vowed if he heard any more derogatory to Molly
  Dunn that he would force the issue with Jocelyn, come what might, and dismiss
  him from the Diamond.</p>

  <p>In mid-August the drift fence, now up on the great triangular promontory,
  received its first backset from enemies. Half a dozen stretches, where it
  crossed the heads of Rocky Canyon, had been laid low, with wire cut and
  hopelessly tangled, and posts broken down. Two days of hard labor were
  required to repair the damage. Jim had his consolation in the slow anger of
  the cowboys. It frightened him, too, for he now saw indications of his
  uncle&rsquo;s prophecy coming true.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, let me trail them hoss tracks,&rdquo; begged Curly Prentiss.
  &ldquo;I can find out in two days who cut our wire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose you do, Curly. What good will that do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we can stop it from happenin&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in. An&rsquo;,
  Jim, shore as Gawd made little apples it will happen, onless we hit thet
  trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you propose to stop it?&rdquo; queried Jim, aghast at the
  flashing-eyed cowboy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s fer you to say, after we ketch these
  hombres.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s wait a little. A few miles of wire, a few
  days&rsquo; extra work&mdash;what&rsquo;s that to us? I&rsquo;ll admit,
  though, if they keep on we&rsquo;ll be up a stump.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. We cain&rsquo;t help matters by waitin&rsquo;. Bud an&rsquo;
  I agree it&rsquo;s thet Cibeque outfit, though we cain&rsquo;t prove
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Prentiss,&rdquo; spoke up Jocelyn, bitingly, &ldquo;I reckon you
  know it&rsquo;s onhealthy to speak names when you cain&rsquo;t prove
  nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hack, I can shore prove one thing damn pronto,&rdquo; snapped
  Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s thet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I take offense at your speakin&rsquo; up fer the
  Cibeque.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. But what does thet prove?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It proves you can git my game any minnit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if thet&rsquo;s so there ain&rsquo;t any helluva rush.
  I&rsquo;ve a date with my gurl, Molly, on Sunday, an&rsquo; I shore
  wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re a liar, Hack!&rdquo; retorted Curly,
  passionately.</p>

  <p>Jim got between the two, and by backing Curly away from the camp fire he
  prevented more trouble for the present.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, he makes me see red,&rdquo; raved Curly, when they were
  alone. &ldquo;I could uv stood his crack aboot the Cibeque, &rsquo;cause Bud
  an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know shore who cut the fence. But he&rsquo;s all the
  time throwin&rsquo; pore little Molly Dunn up to me. I liked her orful well,
  Jim. An&rsquo; I cain&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s thick with him. I
  cain&rsquo;t! <i>Mebbe</i> she is. But I jest cain&rsquo;t believe it.
  He&rsquo;s a &mdash;&mdash; liar!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thick!&rdquo; echoed Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. He claims he&rsquo;s thick with Molly. Haven&rsquo;t you
  heahed him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. What do you mean by thick?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s pretty low-down fer a gurl as sweet an&rsquo; young
  as Molly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;It might be true?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell yes. Thet&rsquo;s what hurts so. Shore he&rsquo;ll marry her
  sooner or later, if it&rsquo;s true. Gurls like Molly don&rsquo;t grow on all
  the bushes. An&rsquo; I reckon most uv the cowboys would take her if she
  <i>was</i> a d&mdash;&mdash; little hussy. Bud swore he would.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How about you, Curly?&rdquo; asked Jim, in strangely level
  voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would, too. In a minnit,&rdquo; replied Curly, with his fair head
  lifting in a way to thrill Jim. &ldquo;What chance has thet pore kid had? Her
  father&rsquo;s no good. An&rsquo; they say her mother will cock her eye at a
  cowboy. An&rsquo; Slinger Dunn! He&rsquo;d be enough to ruin any
  gurl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim made no immediate reply. He sat on his bed and pulled the petals off a
  tiny aster, which he had absentmindedly plucked. Twilight was stealing down
  through the forest, melancholy and tranquil. The heat of the day was
  dissipating. A bell on one of the hobbled horses tinkled musically. The vast
  forest sighed with a breath of breeze, moving down from the heights.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, I wish I were as much of a man as you are,&rdquo; said Jim,
  presently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, boss, thet&rsquo;s nonsense! You shore are an&rsquo;
  more,&rdquo; burst out Curly, nonplussed yet pleased. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bin a
  drill fer you&mdash;this Diamond job. But the outfit&rsquo;s with you.
  Honest, Jim, an&rsquo; heah&rsquo;s my hand on it. We cain&rsquo;t count
  Jocelyn. But to hell with him! He&rsquo;s bin a disturber always, an&rsquo;
  he&rsquo;s growed wuss. I reckon you&rsquo;d better fire him
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, I couldn&rsquo;t answer for my temper&mdash;if I faced him
  again tonight,&rdquo; replied Jim, unsteadily. &ldquo;Perhaps tomorrow or
  soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, ain&rsquo;t you takin&rsquo; this hombre too serious? After
  all, you&rsquo;re boss of the Diamond. An&rsquo; who&rsquo;s Hack
  Jocelyn?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not <i>who</i> he is, but what he <i>claims</i>,
  that&rsquo;s dug into me,&rdquo; replied Jim, frankly, lifting his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Claims! You mean aboot Molly?&rdquo; asked Curly,
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Only I take it harder than you, Curly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fust Bud, an&rsquo; then me, an&rsquo; now you! Aw! ... Who&rsquo;d
  ever thunk it? Thet black-eyed little devil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, I&rsquo;d bet my life she&rsquo;s decent,&rdquo; declared
  Jim, with emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So would I. But it&rsquo;s a long shot, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re
  takin&rsquo; odds!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">THE day came when Jim Traft had his first look at the
  country from the rim of the Diamond.</p>

  <p>It was from the western promontory under which the Cibeque curled like a
  winding snake. The rest was endless green, relieved by bare spots and gray
  specks, which were the homesteads of the inhabitants. West Fork lay almost
  under the rim, a few cabins and fields, a gray line of road between some
  houses. Far to the south the dense forest began to lose its grip and showed
  bare grass flats and ridges. Westward the slopes ran up in long slants, like
  the ribs of a washboard, ending in a craggy mountain range.</p>

  <p>Standing above the forest to look back through the wilderness he had built
  the drift fence, Jim gazed down over a gradual descent to the open cattle
  country, rolling and vast and dotted, ending in deep purple distance.</p>

  <p>The splendid panorama transported Jim. He gazed long, and ever his eyes
  traveled back to the picturesque little homestead in the bend of the Cibeque,
  where he imagined Molly Dunn lived. He could see a log cabin, a ragged
  clearing in the woods, and tiny specks that must have been cattle or
  horses.</p>

  <p>He lingered there a long while. This, his first sight of Arizona land from
  a lofty prospect, had staggered him with its vastness, its magnificence, its
  tremendous note of solitude and the wild. For weeks a subtle happiness in his
  surroundings had been almost imperceptibly stealing over Jim. He had grown to
  love the forest and life in the open. He could not hate this beautiful
  wilderness, because through it he had received the cruelest hurt he had ever
  suffered. And when at length he clambered over the rocks, up to a level and
  to his horse, he realized that Arizona had claimed him.</p>

  <p>On the way back to camp, while riding across one of the grassy draws which
  headed on the western side of the Diamond, Jim found another placard nailed
  to a tree. It was identical with one Hackamore Jocelyn had brought in from
  the head of Sycamore, and its crude misspelled message read the same. This
  one, however, had a round black spot in the center. Upon tearing the placard
  loose Jim saw that the spot was a bullet hole. It stirred a curious heat in
  his veins. And he was reminded of Curly&rsquo;s admonition, not to ride
  around alone through the forest. &ldquo;To be honest aboot it, boss,
  I&rsquo;m more afeared Hack Jocelyn will take a shot at you than one of these
  Cibeque hombres,&rdquo; said Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly! I can&rsquo;t believe that of Jocelyn,&rdquo; expostulated
  Jim. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hard to believe it of Slinger Dunn. But one of my
  own men. No!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, heah you are&mdash;the same old tenderfoot! You&rsquo;re daid
  wrong, Jim. Jocelyn would do thet little thin&rsquo; if he had a chance.
  Mebbe it&rsquo;s on his mind an&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s why he hangs on heah. But
  Slinger Dunn would never shoot you or no other man in the back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You rate Slinger Dunn above Jocelyn as a man?&rdquo; queried Jim,
  in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord! yes. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s hard to explain, boss. But
  you&rsquo;ll get it some day.... Please take another hunch from me. An&rsquo;
  from this next camp we&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m advisin&rsquo; you to
  have one man whose job is to keep back off the fence line an&rsquo;
  watch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bad idea, Curly,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;You
  can take turns, one man a day. But it&rsquo;ll slow us up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, Jim. This heah drift fence won&rsquo;t be done this fall,
  an&rsquo; what with patchin&rsquo; it up an&rsquo; savin&rsquo; our hides,
  we&rsquo;ll shore be next year on the job, an&rsquo; then some
  more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh! Curly, but you&rsquo;re a pessimistic cuss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I don&rsquo;t know jest what thet is, but I reckon it&rsquo;s
  a compliment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Next day Jim moved camp to Quaking Asp and inaugurated the scout duty for
  one man. It was hailed with satisfaction, except in case of Jocelyn, who
  ridiculed it as another &ldquo;new-fangled idee from Missourie.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That lets you out, Jocelyn,&rdquo; retorted Jim, like a flash.
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I would have trusted you, anyhow, with a job so
  important as that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was throwing down the gauntlet with a vengeance, and certainly
  against the advice of Curly and Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister Traft, you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; mighty pert these
  days,&rdquo; returned Jocelyn, the ugly expression changing his handsome
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m finding out what little good it does to be civil to
  some people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Wal, your wise joke was more&rsquo;n oncivil, I take
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn, you can take that crack of mine any way you
  like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shucks! We&rsquo;re shore bustin&rsquo; out brave now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keeping my mouth shut in the past wasn&rsquo;t proof I was afraid
  of you, Hack Jocelyn. I&rsquo;ve politely invited you to fight&mdash;twice.
  Beware of the third time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bud slouched in between the belligerents, sloe-eyed, and hard of face for
  him, but he did not speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore,&rdquo; drawled Jocelyn, with that peculiarly mean note.
  &ldquo;I know you invited me to a fist fight. An&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t take
  you on. My sweetheart won&rsquo;t have me all bunged up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim felt the cold tightening of his skin, which heralded the receding of
  blood from his face. Either this crafty cowboy had guessed his secret or he
  had learned something from Molly Dunn. And in the passion of the moment Jim
  inclined to the latter suspicion. If he replied to Jocelyn, or even glanced
  at him, there would be no more possibility of restraint. Yet Jim quivered in
  his eagerness to get his hands on Jocelyn. Curly saved the situation for
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hack, you ain&rsquo;t showin&rsquo; much respect fer our
  boss,&rdquo; he said, and interposed his long frame before Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>That worthy let out a guffaw. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so long thet you did
  the same. Now you&rsquo;re eatin&rsquo; out of his hand. Wal, Curly Prentiss,
  you lay to this. Heah&rsquo;s one who&rsquo;ll never do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon none of us figgered you would. Hack, you may have the edge
  on me an&rsquo; Hump, an&rsquo; mebbe Lonestar, when it comes to years on the
  range. But we ain&rsquo;t quite looney.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This droll speech, delivered in apparent good humor, effectually silenced
  Jocelyn, who without more ado left the group.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I&rsquo;d reckon he&rsquo;ll last heah till one more pay
  day,&rdquo; ended Curly. But several of the boys, outspoken and less
  humorous, took issue with him on that score.</p>

  <p>Another Saturday arrived, and at noonday, when the cowboys knocked off for
  the week, Jocelyn, with more than usual of his donning his best and gaudiest,
  made a parade of his start for West Fork.</p>

  <p>Jeff Davis, the dumb cook, electrified Jim and prostrated the cowboys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a quiet man an&rsquo; I like peace,&rdquo; he began, in a
  perfectly clear and resonant voice. &ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s why I never talk. But
  that &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; Jocelyn has got me riled.
  An&rsquo; if some of you &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; cowpunchers
  don&rsquo;t shet him up, I&rsquo;ll slip some coyote poison in the
  &mdash;&mdash; meat!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Such profanity had never before been heard in the Diamond camp, at least
  since Jim had taken charge. The boys gave the cook wide-eyed and gaping
  stares, then after their usual manner when enraptured, they whooped like
  Indians and rolled on the ground. Upon partial recovery they delivered
  themselves with characteristic remarks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Our tongue-tied cook!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deaf an&rsquo; <i>dumb</i>! Haw! Haw!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; mebbe he cain&rsquo;t cuss!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <p>No other of the Diamond outfit left camp that week-end. They had a lazy,
  jolly time of it, interspersed with some thoughtful conferences about the
  obstacles ahead. Jim could not feel that they had accepted him as one of them
  yet, but they had changed so materially that their humor had lost its
  sting.</p>

  <p>At Quaking Asp a stream of cold water ran down into the canyon, and half a
  mile below the rim there were pools full of fine trout. Bud took Jim fishing.
  Now it chanced that fishing had always been Jim&rsquo;s favorite pastime, but
  he had never seen a rainbow trout. The tackle was not much, Bud averred;
  merely hooks and lines which he dug out of his kit. They cut poles and caught
  grasshoppers for bait. Jim had the most thrilling few hours of his Western
  experience, always putting aside those fatal hours with Molly Dunn. He caught
  a number of nice trout, and Bud caught a string as heavy as he wanted to pack
  uphill. When they arrived at camp with fresh fish for supper they were
  received with vociferous acclaim.</p>

  <p>On Sunday they assayed to go again, and Curly begged to be taken. He was
  put to catching grasshoppers, and the spectacle of that long-legged,
  awkward-running cowboy, whooping wildly and batting grasshoppers with his
  huge sombrero, was something to see.</p>

  <p>They had a great day on the brook, the climax of which was when Curly
  slipped off a rock and fell in to his neck.</p>

  <p>It wanted an hour to sunset when they arrived in camp. To Jim&rsquo;s
  amaze Hack Jocelyn had just ridden in and had kicked his chaps off.
  Jim&rsquo;s quick eyes noted the cowboy&rsquo;s gun belt hanging on the
  pommel of his saddle. The sight seemed to make every fiber in Jim leap.
  Jocelyn presented a marked contrast to the debonair braggart of a courtier
  who had left for West Fork only the day before. His garb looked as if he had
  slept in a hay-loft. His face was haggard, dark, and sullen. Not many hours
  past he had been under the influence of liquor.</p>

  <p>If Jocelyn saw the approach of Jim and his companions, he gave no evidence
  of it, but went on in forceful harangue to Cherry Winters and Lonestar.</p>

  <p>Jim caught the tail end of a speech that drew him up, strung and sharp. He
  dropped his string of trout. In a few strides he was upon Jocelyn, and with
  hard hand jerked him round.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were you speaking of Molly Dunn?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if it&rsquo;s any of your &mdash;&mdash; mix, yes, I
  was,&rdquo; returned Jocelyn, deliberately, and the way he squared himself
  and dropped his right hand to his side was not to be overlooked. Only he had
  forgotten that his gun hung in his belt over the pommel of his saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn, you&rsquo;re fired,&rdquo; rang out Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. Beat you to it, Traft. I quit,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if I recollect, it was yestiddy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. Get out of my camp. You can&rsquo;t even eat
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traft, thet ain&rsquo;t Western&mdash;to send a man out
  hungry,&rdquo; said Jocelyn, darkly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it Western to speak vilely of a girl?&rdquo; flashed Jim,
  hotly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Depends on thet gurl, Mister Traft.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn, what you said <i>may</i> be true, though, by God! I think
  you&rsquo;re a liar! One way or another you&rsquo;re a dirty
  skunk!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Jim lunged out with all the fury of might and grief. His big fist
  covered one of Jocelyn&rsquo;s malignant eyes. The cowboy fell over the
  bench, knocking Winters down. Jim leaped after them, and plunged upon
  Jocelyn, to kick him fiercely, and then fall on him like a battering-ram.</p>

  <p>Curly was the first to leap and grasp Jim. But he could do nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Help, somebody!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Bulldog him, Bud! ...
  There! ... Why, boss, shore you&rsquo;d killed the fellar. Come now.... You
  shore lost your temper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Between them they dragged Jim off the bloody-faced Jocelyn, who sat up
  groggily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some of you&mdash;lead him out of&mdash;camp,&rdquo; panted Jim,
  struggling for breath. &ldquo;Then come back for his horse and pack.... And
  his wages, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim turned away unsteadily, with Bud still holding his arm. &ldquo;Let
  go!&rdquo; growled Jim, roughly. &ldquo;Or I&rsquo;ll biff you
  one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I ain&rsquo;t fit to face my Maker jest yet,&rdquo; drawled
  Bud, complying with this command.</p>

  <p>They crossed to where Jim had his bed and pack. &ldquo;Fetch my bag, the
  one I keep my money in,&rdquo; said Jim, as he sat down. He was visibly
  shaking and the sweat dropped from his face. Bud brought out the little bag
  and opened it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I don&rsquo;t see how we could hev avoided thet, boss,&rdquo;
  he said, resignedly, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Avoid hell!&mdash;Ought to have jumped him long ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim looked at his big, dirty, red-stained hands. &ldquo;Get out the money,
  Bud.... Let&rsquo;s see. I&rsquo;ll pay him the month out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pay him nuthin&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t owe,&rdquo; declared Bud,
  carefully calculating and counting out the amount due. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give
  it to Cherry an&rsquo; let him hand it over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim did not look up from the ground until he had recovered his balance.
  Jocelyn had evidently been led off into the woods, for Cherry appeared to be
  following with his horse and Hump Stevens with his pack. They disappeared.
  Whereupon Curly and Bud returned to Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Best job fer the Diamond in six years,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. But bad fer the boss, Bud,&rdquo; added Curly, gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, I couldn&rsquo;t stand him any longer. I
  couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; broke out Jim, spreading wide his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore you couldn&rsquo;t. But Jocelyn will never get over thet. I
  don&rsquo;t mean the lickin&rsquo;, though you near busted him. It&rsquo;s
  what you called him an&rsquo; orderin&rsquo; him out of camp. Thet&rsquo;ll
  go over the range. It&rsquo;ll aboot make Hack Jocelyn an outlaw.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry. I suppose he&rsquo;ll kill me, but I
  couldn&rsquo;t have done otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Jim, it&rsquo;s <i>done</i>,&rdquo; rejoined Curly.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s shore slated fer wuss company. I&rsquo;ll bet my spurs
  Slinger Dunn will kill him. But the thing fer you to make up your mind aboot
  is&mdash;if you ever meet Jocelyn ag&rsquo;in, no matter where, grab your gun
  an&rsquo; begin to shoot. Savvy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, will you promise to do thet little trick?&rdquo; asked Bud,
  just as earnestly as Curly had spoken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, boys, I promise,&rdquo; replied Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine an&rsquo; dandy,&rdquo; declared Curly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re no
  slouch with a gun an&rsquo; Hack ain&rsquo;t so much. It&rsquo;d been plumb
  murder fer me to draw on him. But the chances are slim you&rsquo;ll ever meet
  up with Jocelyn alone. If he gets in the Cibeque an&rsquo; Slinger Dunn
  stands fer it&mdash;which I&rsquo;ll gamble he won&rsquo;t&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
  be jumpin&rsquo; out of the fryin&rsquo;-pan into the fire. Jocelyn is only
  another cowpuncher thet&rsquo;s gone to the bad. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of
  them. The Cibeque will be the wuss off with Jocelyn. They&rsquo;ll cut our
  fence an&rsquo; rustle our stock. An&rsquo;, boss, if you don&rsquo;t hold
  the Diamond back, every damn one of thet two-bit outfit will be daid or in
  jail before the snow flies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; added Bud, impressively, &ldquo;Curly an&rsquo; I know
  right now thet the Haverlys are cuttin&rsquo; our fence an&rsquo;
  rustlin&rsquo; our cattle. We didn&rsquo;t ride down to West Fork fer
  nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you had trouble enough. An&rsquo; we reckoned we&rsquo;d keep
  it as long as we could.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you give me proofs I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not hold the Diamond
  back,&rdquo; declared Jim, and probably that decision marked the West
  claiming him for its own.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we cain&rsquo;t lay a hand on proof jest this minnit, but
  it&rsquo;ll shore come,&rdquo; replied Bud.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The Diamond operated out of that camp until wagon loads of fresh supplies
  and more wire arrived from Flagerstown. Then they pushed on to Tobe&rsquo;s
  Well, which was the end of the road. Thereafter all transports had to be
  packed on horseback.</p>

  <p>Each succeeding camp site had added something to Jim&rsquo;s appreciation
  of Arizona; and Tobe&rsquo;s Well outdid them all.</p>

  <p>Tobe, an obscure bear-hunter, had long ago built a log shack there, after
  which the canyon and the bubbling well of crystal spring water had taken his
  name. The situation was wholly different from the other camp settings. The
  canyon headed on the west slope of the Diamond, in a deep bottle-necked,
  gray-cliffed gorge. The floor consisted of several acres of cleared land and
  as much more in pine and spruce. The well was a huge spring at the upper end
  of the clearing and the wonderful flow of water boiled and bubbled up in the
  center. Under a magnificent spruce, the dead top of which tipped the rim-wall
  above, stood the old log shack in ruins. There were several outlets to this
  miniature lake, little rivulets that wound away under grass and fern-bordered
  banks to merge into one stream in the center of the gorge. Soon it gathered
  velocity and plunged with low roar through the canyon neck, thereafter to
  fall precipitously down to the Cibeque. Giant pines and spruces stood far
  apart around the well, too lordly and self-contained to mingle branches or
  shade. White and purple asters, gold daisies, and blue flags waved in the
  summer wind. Birds and squirrels appeared tame and friendly. A herd of deer,
  does and fawns, stood with ears erect to watch the wagons roll clatteringly
  in at the rocky gateway.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, this heah is one waterhole you cain&rsquo;t fence off the
  Diamond,&rdquo; declared Curly, with a chuckle.</p>

  <p>And indeed it seemed imperative to run the drift fence considerably below
  the gateway. Tobe&rsquo;s Canyon was one of the brakes of the Cibeque, not so
  large and open as the Sycamore, or Deer or Long Horn Canyons. It was,
  however, a big country in itself, extremely wild and rugged up on the slope
  of the Diamond, and a noted place for bear and lion. The cattle that drifted
  down Tobe&rsquo;s Canyon had never been recovered by their owners.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have my fall hunt right here,&rdquo; declared
  Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, heah&rsquo;s a gent who&rsquo;d like to chop wood an&rsquo;
  pack water fer you,&rdquo; said Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;, boss, if I do say it myself, I can cook rings around
  Jeff,&rdquo; added Bud, eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both on,&rdquo; replied Jim, gladly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Lord! we&rsquo;re forgettin&rsquo;,&rdquo; went on Curly.
  &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t hev the fence up by October, an&rsquo; if we do get it
  up it&rsquo;ll only go down ag&rsquo;in.... An&rsquo; then we&rsquo;ll be
  huntin&rsquo; wire-cutters an&rsquo; cattle thieves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the second day at Tobe&rsquo;s Well the drift fence was run below and
  around this famous waterhole and back up on the Diamond.</p>

  <p>Jim had a rather uneasy conscience. Tobe&rsquo;s Well lay below the rim,
  and there was no other water close either to the north or south. Of course
  all the water from the well ran on down the mountain and cattle west of the
  fence could find it. But somehow the thing did look as if he was fencing off
  a waterhole. And he ventured to ask Curly what he thought the West Forkers
  would say about it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, hell, let &rsquo;em drink whisky,&rdquo; declared Curly.
  &ldquo;Boss, you&rsquo;re too turrible conscientious. Our side will say
  we&rsquo;re savin&rsquo; the drift of cattle. Their side will say we&rsquo;re
  fencin&rsquo; off grass an&rsquo; water. It&rsquo;s nip an&rsquo; tuck. But
  wait till you heah some bullets hissin&rsquo; past your ear!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sixth day from that fell to Jim as his turn for the scout duty he had
  initiated. He had saddled and mounted while yet the others were at
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, how fur do you aim to ride back along the line?&rdquo; asked
  Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make for Sycamore, strike the fence, and work this
  way,&rdquo; replied Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, keep your eye peeled,&rdquo; said Curly, gruffly.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Jim rode out of the canyon and up to the rim above, from which he gazed
  down with a stinging sensation of pleasure at the wild camp site, the does
  and fawns grazing with the horses, the blue column of smoke curling upward,
  and at the circle of cowboys round the fire.</p>

  <p>Lonestar&rsquo;s mellow voice floated up: &ldquo;Oh, I am a Texas cowboy,
  jest off the Texas plains. My trade is cinchin&rsquo;
  saddles&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim wheeled his horse off into the pines, conscious that his full heart
  could not quite attain the joy of realization. He loved the West; he was
  proving his mettle to his uncle and his father; he had begun to fit in with
  these elemental, dare-devil cowboys; he liked life in the open and the wild.
  But he could not rid himself of the pang and oppression in his breast, of the
  persistence of a bitter sickening doubt and regret. Long weeks, even months,
  had not killed his love for Molly Dunn. Time and thought, long hours in the
  lonely nights and bitter reflection, had proved to Jim that the one constant,
  ever-growing thing had been love. Some day before long he would ride down to
  West Fork and see Molly Dunn. See for himself what she was and if there was
  not reason for his blind faith!</p>

  <p>So his thoughts came and went, repeated themselves and augmented, while he
  rode through the forest. There was no trail, but he had his direction and
  knew he could not miss Sycamore. Cattle were numerous and many of them wild.
  He saw not only unbranded calves and heifers, but two-year-old steers. And he
  remarked this as something against the large cattlemen. It could do no less
  than tempt the little stockmen and the homesteaders to something morally
  dishonest, if not so according to range law. And once a man had stolen
  unbranded cattle, he was on the down grade. This was Jim&rsquo;s personal
  conviction. Curly Prentiss would argue, &ldquo;Wal, how do I <i>know</i> this
  heah unbranded calf ain&rsquo;t mine?&rdquo; Jim had to concede the point,
  but he thought it could become far-fetched. The free range and mixed cattle
  were mistakes. Jim, however, admitted he could not see any remedy at present.
  The drift fence was a start.</p>

  <p>Arriving at Sycamore, he rode west a short distance until he came to the
  fence, when he turned south to follow it. He walked his horse, keeping back a
  few rods, and he peered ahead with keen eyes. He covered several miles in
  this cautious manner and came out on the bank of a swampy swale, from which
  water drained down into Rocky Canyon. Aspen thickets, clumps of new spruce
  and pine, filled the head of this canyon. Cattle were drifting down.</p>

  <p>Jim found the fence down in a section clear across this gateway to the
  brakes. He really had not expected to find a cut, and hard on his surprise
  and dismay roused his slumbering wrath.</p>

  <p>He proceeded, though less cautiously, with his rifle across the pommel.
  And along toward noon he rode down the wooded slope under Tobe&rsquo;s Well.
  Cattle were working down here, too. Not drifting! Jim prepared himself for
  another surprise. The bottle-neck width of Tobe&rsquo;s Canyon had been
  sheared of its wire fence. A clean-cut job it was, every wire strand having
  been cut on each side of trees and posts.</p>

  <p>Jim descried fresh hoof tracks in the dim, seldom-used trail. Such was his
  wrath now that he followed them, keeping on the grass and under the pines
  where his horse walked quietly. Once the animal neighed, much to Jim&rsquo;s
  annoyance. That worried Jim, but did not deter him. And as he worked down,
  keeping intense vigilance on all sides, he could scarcely fail of impressions
  as to the wildness of Tobe&rsquo;s Canyon.</p>

  <p>His intent was to trail this fence-cutter clear to his hole, wherever that
  was; and Jim&rsquo;s excitement kept him from realizing the miles he
  descended, until he got down on comparative level, in the midst of a most
  beautiful forest of spruce and pine. Few indeed were the open glades and
  aisles. He heard cattle or elk breaking sticks back of the trail; the black
  squirrels and blue jays noisily resented his presence; he saw a squirrel-hawk
  flash down through an opening and crash into a tree, to flop violently and
  fly off, clutching a furry victim in his claws. That was a near bit of cruel
  nature to Jim.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his horse elevated his ears and stopped. The trail ran straight
  for twenty paces, and turned at a huge brown pine. A man stepped out, silent
  as a shadow. Jim recognized the lithe buckskin-clad form, the dark face, the
  eyes like holes that exposed fire behind. He leveled a gun, took deliberate
  aim, while Jim froze in his saddle.</p>

  <p>He saw red belch from the gun. A sharp impact as from a violent gust of
  wind struck him. Then a terrific shock, a tearing rend of flesh, a thundering
  crash! Jim&rsquo;s horse plunged to throw him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">VIOLENT collision with ground or tree ended Jim&rsquo;s
  acute consciousness. His first sensations afterward were the chill of water
  on his face and a burning pain in his breast. Then he felt hands on his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>He forced his weighted eyelids open, to see bright sunshine and spread of
  foliage over him. He lay half sitting up against a log. Beside him knelt a
  girl. She uttered a broken cry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Mister Traft&mdash;you&rsquo;ve come to!&rdquo; she
  exclaimed, huskily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly Dunn!&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s voice was not very strong. She
  straightened up a little so the light struck her face. It appeared pale and
  convulsed, with big dark eyes dilated in horror. Both her little hands were
  red with blood. This fully clarified Jim&rsquo;s stunned faculties. &ldquo;Am
  I bad hurt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know! I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo; she
  cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Show me where I&rsquo;m shot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your breast ... heah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s shirt was open. Even with the girl&rsquo;s help it took nerve
  to feel for the wound. His whole breast burned. A wet scarf lay pressed tight
  over his heart. Warm slippery blood! It had saturated his clothes. It was
  flowing freely. Then his fingers located a hole in his flesh that seemed on
  fire. Despite the shock to his wits Jim knew he had not been shot through or
  near the heart. The bullet hole ranged upwards. Had it missed his lungs? The
  moment was fraught with terror. And as he felt of it he was gazing up into
  the strained eyes of the girl. He localized the sharpest pain higher up. The
  bullet had come out on top of his left shoulder. From here the blood poured.
  Something cold and ghastly released its clutch upon Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bullet&mdash;glanced,&rdquo; he muttered. Then he asked if there
  was any other wound.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You hit on your haid,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I&rsquo;ll not die,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank God! I&mdash;I was so terribly frightened. What can I
  do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had water here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I filled your hat at the brook.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tear this scarf in strips,&rdquo; directed Jim. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
  find a clean one in my pocket.... Inside.... Now tear that&mdash;and fold
  into pads. You&rsquo;ve only to wash off the blood&mdash;and bind the pads on
  tight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She complied with his instructions, without hesitation, though her hands
  shook.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But this top hole! You&rsquo;re bleedin&rsquo; so! Fast as I wipe
  the blood off&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put one of the pads over it. Press tight. Now I&rsquo;ll hold it
  there.... Knot the strips.... Slip under my arm&mdash;over my shoulder. Now
  the other pad ... and tie tight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The difficult task was at length accomplished. Molly sat back on her
  heels, plainly weak. Tiny drops like dew stood out upon her forehead. Her
  hair was wet. She made a move to brush it back from her face, then, aware of
  her bloody hands, she essayed to do it with her elbow, holding them out so as
  to avoid contact.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly Dunn, you&rsquo;ve got my blood on your hands&mdash;all
  right,&rdquo; said Jim, with significance.</p>

  <p>But it escaped her. &ldquo;I shore have&mdash;and it sickens me,&rdquo;
  she whispered. Then pouring water from his sombrero she washed them, and
  wiped them upon the grass.</p>

  <p>Jim felt faint, and he was suffering severe pain, both of which in the
  thrilling agitation of the moment seemed nothing to be concerned about.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must get you back off the trail heah,&rdquo; she spoke up,
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. If you help me I can manage,&rdquo; he replied. With her
  assistance he labored to his feet and walked, leaning on her. For a little
  girl she certainly was strong. They seemed to go far. Jim grew dizzy. He
  heard running water, but could not see it. Blurred spruce trees stood up all
  around. His head swam, and when the girl stopped to let him down it was none
  too soon for Jim. He spoke, but apparently she did not hear. Then his sight
  cleared. She was coming with water in his sombrero.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You aboot fainted that time, Mister Jim,&rdquo; she said, lifting
  his head so he could drink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;should&mdash;smile,&rdquo; whispered Jim, as he lay back.
  Presently he had recovered again, not only to the mounting pains, but to a
  thrilling sense of this extraordinary situation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;happened?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore a lot,&rdquo; she replied, mournfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know who shot me?&rdquo; he went on.</p>

  <p>She hung her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me. I know. It was your brother, Slinger
  Dunn.... He stepped out from behind a tree ... didn&rsquo;t seem in any
  hurry. But I was paralyzed. I forgot I had a gun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond me&mdash;that you&rsquo;re alive. Oh, I&rsquo;m
  thankful.... But what&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim felt the lump over his breast where the lower pad had been bound. It
  was right under his shirt pocket over his heart. His finger located the
  bullet hole in his shirt and at the same instant his watch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See here, Molly,&rdquo; he said, curiously. &ldquo;Take my watch
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She complied. The watch was of heavy silver and had been long in the Traft
  family. Evidence was not wanting that it had served its day. The bullet had
  struck the case, making a heavy dent and then had glanced upward.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That accounts,&rdquo; whispered Molly. &ldquo;I wondered aboot it.
  Slinger doesn&rsquo;t often miss what he shoots at.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Saved my life!&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; exclaimed
  Jim, fondling the watch. &ldquo;And I came awful close not fetching
  it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, such luck! Thank Heaven! ... But, Mister Traft, what&rsquo;ll
  we <i>do</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do? I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. I couldn&rsquo;t get on a
  horse.... I&rsquo;ll probably be laid out. My, but it throbs and
  burns!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have fever. An&rsquo; maybe blood-poisonin&rsquo;. We
  got to have medicine,&rdquo; she rejoined, tragically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do to send you up to my camp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not? My horse is heah, tied over there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The boys would know your brother shot me. I don&rsquo;t want
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore they&rsquo;ll find it out, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose. But if I&rsquo;m on my feet I could keep them
  from&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister Jim, you needn&rsquo;t let Slinger off on my account,&rdquo;
  she interrupted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have something to say to him when I&rsquo;m all right
  again,&rdquo; declared Jim, grimly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d the&mdash;Why did he
  shoot me? On account of this drift fence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Reckon it was aboot me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. It&rsquo;s gone all over the country&mdash;what you
  did&mdash;what <i>we</i> did&mdash;that night of the dance ... out on the
  porch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud Chalfack&mdash;the devil!&rdquo; ejaculated Jim, stirringly
  aware of Molly&rsquo;s scarlet blush. &ldquo;He told it! ... Oh, I&rsquo;m
  sorry, Molly! That was such a&mdash;a crazy thing for me to do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon I was just aboot as crazy,&rdquo; she replied, generously,
  and smiled just a little wistfully. &ldquo;But Slinger didn&rsquo;t heah what
  <i>I</i> did ... an&rsquo; he shore wouldn&rsquo;t believe me. I was scared
  he&rsquo;d choke it out of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What does he think, Molly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be no worse, Mister Jim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The damn blockhead! Some of these Arizona fellows make me see red.
  ... I&rsquo;ll make it my business to hunt Mister Slinger up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t do that! I beg you!&rdquo; she implored.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose I busted in on him somewhere. At your home or in the saloon
  at West Fork&mdash;before other people. He wouldn&rsquo;t murder me outright,
  would he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. But he&rsquo;d make you draw. Arch is the most awfulest man
  when he&rsquo;s mad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know whether he was mad or not, but he sure looked
  awful,&rdquo; replied Jim, forcing a laugh. &ldquo;Molly Dunn, how&rsquo;d
  you happen to come along here and find me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger just the same as told me he&rsquo;d kill you,&rdquo; she
  replied, grave, dark eyes on him. &ldquo;I waited this mawnin&rsquo; till he
  was gone. Then I trailed him. My plan was to keep behind him till we were up
  on top, then I&rsquo;d ride off the trail an&rsquo; go round to your
  camp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well! What for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to warn you aboot Slinger. An&rsquo; that you was in
  &rsquo;most as much danger from the Cibeque outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly Dunn!&rdquo; he cried, incredulously. &ldquo;Then it
  wasn&rsquo;t an accident? You actually came to save me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The distance to the little brown hand on her knee was not far, and his
  quickly bridged it. She seemed neither shy nor cold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It shore wasn&rsquo;t no accident, Mister Jim,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must have risked a good deal, Molly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think aboot it. But if they find it out down in the
  brakes&mdash;well, the Cibeque wouldn&rsquo;t be no place for me. An&rsquo;
  Slinger will aboot kill me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry! And grateful! Molly Dunn, I&rsquo;ve got to
  think up some way to prove it.... But you must not let Slinger or any one see
  you. How far is it to your home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon aboot five miles, down through the woods. I can keep off the
  trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you happen to find me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I trailed Slinger to where his tracks went off into the woods. Then
  I stopped. Pretty soon I heahed a shot&mdash;then a cry&mdash;then a horse
  comin&rsquo; my way fast. I hid behind a spruce. An&rsquo; I seen Slinger
  ride by. I didn&rsquo;t know what had happened. But I tied my horse an&rsquo;
  slipped up the trail. First I saw your horse. He was makin&rsquo; off,
  draggin&rsquo; his bridle. Then I found you lyin&rsquo; by a tree.
  You&rsquo;d fallen off an&rsquo; hit your haid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She released her hand from his and gently touched Jim&rsquo;s head above
  his temple, where even a slight pressure caused him pain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better fetch your horse,&rdquo; she added, rising.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go far or stay long,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>The slight buckskin-clad form vanished in the green. And only then did Jim
  take note of his surroundings. He lay in a sort of lean-to made of spruce
  boughs, dead and brown. He could see one small bit of blue sky; all the rest
  was green. He heard a low murmur of running water. The place was secluded,
  and redolent of dry sweet pine needles.</p>

  <p>But the effort to sit up caused him so much pain that he was glad indeed
  to lie back. He must not forget that he had been shot. What an adventure! His
  thoughts simply whirled, and he had to force them to a logical plan. He
  absolutely must send the girl home soon. Could he dare let her risk coming
  back the next day? The idea overcame him. Sooner or later the cowboys would
  find him, though the last place they would look would be down the trail from
  Tobe&rsquo;s Well.</p>

  <p>Soft thuds on the ground made Jim aware that Molly was returning with his
  horse. They ceased. Then he heard a rustling sound, and then the soft flop of
  leather. Next she appeared with his saddle blankets and his coat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister Jim, didn&rsquo;t you have a gun?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So I did. A rifle.... I had it across the front of my saddle when
  Slinger stepped out from behind that tree.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She disappeared again. And he lay there, subject to renewed emotion.
  Presently she returned with the rifle, to deposit it by his side. How pretty,
  slim, and graceful she looked in buckskin! He told her so. She just gazed at
  him with great, reproachful, melancholy eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you worn the lovely white dress since?&rdquo; he added.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.... I&rsquo;m savin&rsquo; that to be buried in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly! ... You should have said married. How
  sweet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister Jim, you&rsquo;re shore talkin&rsquo; too much&mdash;not to
  say too wild. Your face is hot. An&rsquo; time is flyin&rsquo;. What&rsquo;ll
  we do? I&rsquo;ve hobbled your horse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must go home at once. Don&rsquo;t let anybody see you.... Will
  you come back tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, with gravity, as if only she knew what
  that promise implied.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you. Better fetch some medicine. I&rsquo;m going to be pretty
  sick.... And some clean linen to bandage my bullet holes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a canteen on your saddle,&rdquo; she said, and
  stepped outside the shack to procure it. Upon returning she placed it beside
  his rifle. Then on her knees she scraped up a soft pile of pine needles, and
  spread his saddle blankets upon them, and folded his coat for a pillow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bed for you. I reckon you won&rsquo;t get cold. If
  you do, use one of the blankets.... An&rsquo; now I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim gazed up at her as she knelt there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly ... kiss me,&rdquo; he importuned, quite beside himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister Jim!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here alone, unable to move.... Slinger might come
  back and kill me.... Kiss me, Molly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. He won&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I might bleed to death or die of fever,&rdquo; he went on,
  wildly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of your haid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I am. But I know what I&rsquo;m asking. Please kiss
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ask that of <i>me</i>&mdash;Molly Dunn?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who or what you are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Twice he reached for her, but she was just a little too far away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; she said, in alarm, edging close on
  her knees. Then he could reach her. How large and dark her eyes appeared in
  her pale face!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kiss me, and go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She bent over his forehead as if impelled, yet earnestly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried, seeing her intent, and moving impatiently.</p>

  <p>Then blushing duskily scarlet she bent lower, closing her eyes, and laid
  cool sweet lips on his. Before Jim could catch his breath to speak again she
  had fled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Low down of me to take advantage of her that way,&rdquo; he
  muttered. &ldquo;But, after all, was it? ... Curly would say, &lsquo;Thet
  shore aboot spills me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon Jim called Molly every adorable name that he had ever heard or
  could make up, and in some measure satisfied himself of sincerity. After
  which he lay for long in a dream, the pleasure of which made him almost
  unconscious of pain. From that he fell into a fitful slumber.</p>

  <p>When he awoke the light low down had shaded and rays of gold slanted
  through the forest. He was uncomfortably hot and thirsty, but the pain had
  somewhat dulled. It hurt him, however, to move over on to the bed of boughs,
  and he was glad to stretch out. Common sense told him that his situation was
  pretty serious, if his condition was not, but he could hardly dwell on
  anything else save Molly Dunn&rsquo;s return the next day. What endless hours
  to wait! Suppose she did not come? But that girl would come. Jim knew it
  positively. Nevertheless, he tried to consider his predicament.</p>

  <p>The boys would scarcely be apt to search for him until next day. He had
  often been absent from camp until late. Then they would ride north to
  Sycamore, and the chances were favorable that they would not find him until
  the following day. Jim hoped they would not. Slinger Dunn, though, might come
  back to see his victim. After pondering this, however, Jim inclined to
  Molly&rsquo;s conviction that Slinger would not come. There was nothing else
  to speculate upon then but the girl. Jim suddenly felt glad for the solitude
  of the forest and the long night hours that he must pass wakefully.</p>

  <p>He watched the gold fade from the tips of the spruces. The sky turned
  gray. Twilight enveloped the green surroundings in obscurity. Soon all was
  black except a small space of sky overhead where pale stars blinked, and grew
  clear and white. The stillness was something that Jim soon felt he could not
  endure. But it did not last. A sigh breathed through the tree tops. The night
  wind had begun its dominance of the forest. Soon from all around came
  rustlings and stealthy sounds.</p>

  <p>From time to time Jim had to take a swallow of water from the canteen.
  These movements caused him acute pain, but when it subsided he suffered only
  the dull throbbing ache in head and breast. He could stand it. He did not
  mind only when it interfered with the pondering of his problem. Some late
  hour in the night relief from his mental struggle came, if not for the
  physical distress under which he labored. He had made up his mind about Molly
  Dunn, and a sweetness, a gladness, pervaded his soul. Then he fell
  asleep.</p>

  <p>Jim awoke at what he imagined must be the dark hour before dawn. He lay
  flat on his back, and it took a moment or more for him to realize he was not
  in camp, but alone in the deep forest, wounded, and parched by thirst. This
  he satisfied, and had begun to mill over his predicament again when his heavy
  eyelids closed as if weighted with sleep.</p>

  <p>When again they unclosed not only had dawn come, but the sun had arisen;
  and squirrels and jays were holding forth noisily.</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s throbbing headache had departed, and aside from the painful
  itching and contracting of his wounds he seemed to be doing pretty well
  indeed. At any rate, he told himself so. He sat up, finding that only the use
  of his left arm and shoulder hurt him severely. About this hour, he
  reflected, and with considerable gratification, there would be consternation
  in the Diamond camp. Curly and Bud, on the rampage, would scatter those
  cowboys like a bunch of quail; and lonesome riders encountered in the woods
  were going to have to give strict account of their presence.</p>

  <p>Sooner or later some one would find him, and if no one did he might be
  able in a couple of days to reach camp. Perhaps he was not very practical
  this morning, for he almost felt grateful to Slinger Dunn. Young Jim Traft,
  head of the Diamond outfit, shot by a fence-cutter in the Cibeque&mdash;how
  that would fly over the range! And how would his uncle take it? And Ring
  Locke? Jim realized that he would have risen in their estimation. All the
  same, he did not intend to betray Molly Dunn&rsquo;s brother. Jim had the
  nucleus of a plan hazily forming in his mind.</p>

  <p>Waiting for Molly Dunn was not in the least wearisome, though the moments
  multiplied into hours. Jim had too much to thrill over&mdash;to conjecture
  about. How would she take him? He tried to imagine the expression of her
  face&mdash;of her wonderful eyes at the critical moment.</p>

  <p>Thus dreamily engaged, he was not prepared for low clatter of hoofs down
  the trail. He sat up with such a start that he wrenched his shoulder and had
  to pay a severe penalty. The forest was very still, except for birds and
  squirrels. The rhythmic beat of hoofs subsided, and likewise Jim&rsquo;s
  mounting heart. Then the sound came clear again. The hoofbeats were soft, and
  the horse that made them was neither heavy nor shod. They swelled clearer for
  a little, slowed down, and then ceased.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Molly,&rdquo; said Jim, softly, and yet he endeavored to
  fortify himself against mistake. The moments dragged, and he was becoming
  nervous and discouraged, when a rustle of brush and soft footfalls just
  behind the lean-to brought him up transfixed and thrilling.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the slight gray form he had in his mind&rsquo;s eye appeared
  before him. She was bareheaded and the sunlight glinted from her disheveled
  hair. She carried a bundle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, there you&mdash;are! I was&mdash;shore scared!&rdquo; she
  panted. Her eyes appeared unnaturally large and black in her small pale
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Morning, Molly! I reckoned you&rsquo;d never come,&rdquo; he said,
  gladly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;all right?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had an awful night. And I was bad until just now,&rdquo; he
  replied.</p>

  <p>She sat down, and depositing her bundle, she put a hand to her bosom as if
  to still its heaving. She averted her eyes. It was plain she could not look
  at him. She appeared worn and troubled, as if she had passed a harassed,
  sleepless night. She seemed such a wistful, pathetic little figure.
  Jim&rsquo;s heart filled with tenderness and he could scarce contain his
  tremendous secret.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, did you get home safe?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Slinger didn&rsquo;t come, an&rsquo; ma never heahed
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m sure glad. I&rsquo;ve worried a
  lot.&rdquo; Then, noticing that she wore a blood-stained bandage around her
  left hand, he asked solicitously if she had not injured herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I just put this on to fool ma, so I could go to the
  store,&rdquo; she explained in a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I told
  Mr. Summers I&rsquo;d cut myself an&rsquo; was scared of blood poison. I
  bought this medicine, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve fetched some clean linen, a towel
  an&rsquo; soap, an&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; for you to eat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just wonderful, Molly!&rdquo; said Jim, and meant it
  in a multiplicity of ways.</p>

  <p>She gave him a fleeting flash of eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch some
  water,&rdquo; she returned.</p>

  <p>Jim noted, as she glided away with the canteen, how cautiously she peeped
  around the spruce tree before venturing farther. She was gone some moments,
  that dragged for the eager Jim. Then presently she reappeared as noiseless as
  a shadow, to set the dripping canteen down beside him, and knelt to undo a
  buckskin thong around the bundle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to hurt right smart,&rdquo; she said,
  practically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I could stand to be carved into mincemeat by you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon she laid a cool hand on his forehead and temples, and then
  slipped it inside his open shirt to feel of the bandages.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you don&rsquo;t&rsquo;pear to have fever, but you shore look
  an&rsquo; talk flighty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will you hold still an&rsquo;
  keep quiet? This&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to hurt like sixty. I&rsquo;ve done it
  more&rsquo;n once for Arch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim nodded his acquiescence, and thought it would be safer and facilitate
  the operation if he closed his eyes. She cut the strips of scarf that had
  served as a bandage and then she essayed to remove the pads. They had
  evidently crusted with blood and they stuck tight. She saturated them with
  water and pulled gently at them until it appeared that more force must be
  used. Jim made the mental reservation that it hurt twice times sixty. But
  once the pads had been removed, how soothing to his hot skin and the
  irritated wounds were the touch of her cool hand and the feel of water!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister Jim, from what little I know aboot gun-shot wounds,
  I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re not so bad off this mawnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dare say my&mdash;my favorable condition can be laid to my
  beautiful and splendid nurse,&rdquo; he replied, without opening his eyes. He
  thought he caught a suppressed titter, but could not be sure. Then he
  attended to her applying a stinging solution to his wounds and a deft and
  thorough bandaging of them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There. I cain&rsquo;t do no more for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
  reckon these bullet holes are healin&rsquo; clean, but it&rsquo;d be sense to
  have your men get you to Flag, pronto.... An&rsquo; then stay there, Mister
  Jim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Molly. I&rsquo;m very grateful to you,&rdquo; he rejoined,
  opening his eyes to smile up at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Flag, of course,
  if it&rsquo;s necessary. But I&rsquo;ll come back.... Molly, is it safe for
  you to stay with me awhile?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Safe? I reckon so, now I&rsquo;m heah,&rdquo; she replied,
  thoughtfully. &ldquo;Ma won&rsquo;t miss me.... But all the same I ought to
  <i>run</i>!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Run? From what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From you, Mister Jim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Please leave off the Mister. We&rsquo;ve known each other a long
  time, now. It&rsquo;d be perfectly proper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She laughed, and her mirth had just a touch of bitter mockery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should you run from <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with you only twice an&rsquo; you made a fool of me
  both times,&rdquo; she replied, resentfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never did,&rdquo; he protested. If he could stir her, even to
  anger, he might overcome the aloofness he sensed in her this morning. But
  failing in this, he thought he knew a way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shore did. That night on the porch at Flag! You grabbed me just
  like Hack Jocelyn an&rsquo; other cowpunchers I know. An&rsquo;
  yesterday&mdash;that was worse. Your persuadin&rsquo; me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, consider. There was no excuse for me at the dance. But
  yesterday there was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe for you. But not for me. I shore wonder what you think of
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim saw the delight of playing upon her simplicity must be forsworn. She
  seemed to be smarting under shame. The moment had come, far swifter than he
  had anticipated, but he welcomed it, hastened to end forever her doubts of
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, if you&rsquo;ll look around I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think
  of you,&rdquo; he said, in the coolest, easiest tone he could muster.</p>

  <p>The dark head whirled. Her spirited action, the fire of her eyes, the
  receding of hot color, implied a doubt of him and her resentment at it. Yet
  there seemed something else in her expression, not conscious hope, but a
  pathos due to the dream she only half divined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; he asked, simply, but with deep
  emotion.</p>

  <p>Perhaps nothing else could have so altered her. At length she burst
  out:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister Jim!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s dispense with the Mister. Call me plain Jim, and say
  &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boy, now I know what ails you,&rdquo; she said, in
  self-reproach.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. I haven&rsquo;t come to that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not out of your haid, what on earth are you?&rdquo;
  she cried, wildly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In love, Molly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In love! ... With <i>me</i>?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>He got hold of her hand, to find it trembling. &ldquo;Listen,
  child,&rdquo; he began, determined to convince her. &ldquo;You remember our
  meeting. Well, I think I fell in love with you then. If not then, at the
  dance surely. And last night I made up my mind to ask you to marry me.
  I&rsquo;ve been shot, I know, Molly. And I&rsquo;m excited. But I am
  absolutely in possession of all my wits. I love you very dearly. And I want
  to make you my wife.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me? Molly Dunn?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you, Molly Dunn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Jim Traft devoutly thanked the god of love or faith, or both,
  whatever it had been that had prompted him to broach this most impelling and
  sacred of all propositions to a woman. For though Molly Dunn was wholly
  unconscious of it, the instant he had convinced her was one of a singular
  transformation. He had convinced her of so marvelous a thing that it worked a
  like change in her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! ... I cain&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
  incredulous with the amazing truth. &ldquo;My God! What would Slinger say to
  that? An&rsquo; ma an&rsquo; pa an&rsquo; Andy&mdash;an&rsquo; that
  grinnin&rsquo; Jocelyn?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, it doesn&rsquo;t matter in the least what they&rsquo;d say.
  But a great deal what <i>you</i> say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Mister Jim&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop calling me that,&rdquo; interrupted Jim, imperiously, and he
  shook her. He divined not only that she really cared for him, but that she
  could never hold out against him. It shone in her startled eyes. She betrayed
  it in other unconscious ways. &ldquo;Call me Jim.... Do you hear?
  <i>Jim!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore I heah you ... Jim,&rdquo; she replied, sweetly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It sounds very nice. Now, what do you say, Molly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shore upset. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be so&mdash;so proud
  all my life&mdash;an&rsquo; happy that you love me an&rsquo; want me.... But,
  Jim, I cain&rsquo;t marry you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly! Do you love some one else?&rdquo; he queried, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t you care for me?&rdquo; he
  implored.</p>

  <p>She gave him an enigmatical little smile, as much mournful as
  derisive&mdash;something dedicated to the stupidity of man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, heah you have lost your haid,&rdquo; she went on.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Molly Dunn of the Cibeque. They always called me that. My
  brother is Slinger Dunn. An&rsquo; this last shootin&rsquo; will make him an
  outlaw.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It needn&rsquo;t, Molly. No one need ever know. I&rsquo;ll not
  tell. And I&rsquo;ll find a way to change Slinger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s only one reason,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;My
  father has lived for years under a cloud. No one can prove he belonged to
  that murderous outfit. But it&rsquo;s behind.... My mother isn&rsquo;t much
  good, either. There&rsquo;s talk aboot her an&rsquo; this an&rsquo; that
  cowboy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I wouldn&rsquo;t be marrying your family,&rdquo; replied
  Jim, sagely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, I may be pretty, like a wood-mouse, as Arch calls me, but
  I&rsquo;m nobody,&rdquo; said Molly, mercilessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  no&mdash;no fit girl for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded, stabbed again by that fierce, jealous
  doubt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sure got good looks. You&rsquo;ve the face, the
  hands&mdash;the instincts of a lady. There must be good blood in your family
  somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. My mother came from a Southern family. She brags aboot it to
  this day. It&rsquo;s a lot to do with her fittin&rsquo; so poor in a log
  cabin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, if&mdash;if&rdquo;&mdash;he tortured himself to get this
  out&mdash;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;ve had affairs with any boys&mdash;that damned
  Jocelyn&mdash;or anyone&mdash;affairs you&rsquo;re ashamed of&mdash;just
  forget them. I <i>know</i> you&rsquo;re the kind of a girl who&rsquo;d tell
  me. But I really don&rsquo;t want to know. I think you&rsquo;ve had a rotten
  deal down here in the Cibeque. What chance have you had&mdash;among these
  louts? Curly Prentiss said that.... So, Molly, turn your back on the whole
  mess and come to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim Traft, do you think I&rsquo;d ever disgrace you
  <i>now</i>?&rdquo; she flashed, with tears welling down over her cheeks.
  &ldquo;Just that you said would make me love you, if nothin&rsquo; else
  could. But it also makes me see clear.... I&mdash;I cain&rsquo;t marry
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim did not press this point any further, for her demeanor, the way she
  clung to his hand, the tremendous agitation that shook her, the traitorous
  eyes which she did not realize, were facts that moved him with tumultuous
  joy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Jim, I reckon you&rsquo;ve heahed talk aboot me,&rdquo; she
  went on. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re shore the one man I&rsquo;d tell
  everythin&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t you let any lies aboot me stick in your
  haid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, Molly,&rdquo; said Jim, which he feared was not
  wholly truth. But on the other hand, under circumstances of extreme
  exasperation, had he not clung to some strange championship of her? Then he
  told her of Hack Jocelyn&rsquo;s vain boastings, of his innuendoes, and at
  last his open, vile claim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger will kill him for that,&rdquo; she replied, furiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have done it myself,&rdquo; declared Jim. &ldquo;The boys
  had to pull me off him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I saw his face an&rsquo; taunted him with it,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;Hack admitted you licked him.... Jim, he scared me bad that time. He
  lay in wait for me along the trail home. An&rsquo; he jerked me into the
  brush. That&rsquo;s when I learned he was quittin&rsquo; the Diamond
  an&rsquo; makin&rsquo; up to the Cibeque. He was playin&rsquo; for a big
  stake. My brother had no use for Hack. An&rsquo; Hack aimed to win him over
  by makin&rsquo; me tell him he&rsquo;d quit the Diamond because you insulted
  me. When I didn&rsquo;t take kind to this deal, he grabbed me up in his arms
  an&rsquo; near broke every rib I own. An&rsquo; he kissed me, Jim&mdash;all
  over except my mouth.... You bet I was scared an&rsquo; I changed my tune. He
  let me down then, an&rsquo; pretty quick I broke an&rsquo; ran.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all the claim Hack Jocelyn had on you! ... Molly,
  all the time I <i>knew</i> he was a liar. But, oh, it nearly broke my
  heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, he never had no claim on me,&rdquo; she replied, earnestly.
  &ldquo;Some of the other boys have tried to make up to me by grabbin&rsquo;
  me. <i>You</i> did, Jim Traft!&mdash;It must be a failin&rsquo;. But, I cross
  my heart, Jim, no boy ever got anythin&rsquo; like you got from
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; cried Jim.</p>

  <p>That and the stealing of Jim&rsquo;s arm round her waist, drawing her
  down, would have been Molly&rsquo;s undoing. But he heard a soft step. He
  felt Molly freeze under his arm. A shadow crossed the light above him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">JIM had only a glimpse of Slinger Dunn looming over him, gun
  in hand. Then Molly, with a scream, threw herself upon Jim protectingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So heah you are, you wood-louse,&rdquo; grated Slinger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, I found him&mdash;on the trail&mdash;bleedin&rsquo; to
  death,&rdquo; cried Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When&mdash;an&rsquo; what you doin&rsquo; up heah?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I went ridin&rsquo;, Arch. Yesterday. I heahed a shot. Then
  you came by like mad. An&rsquo; I found him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You was meetin&rsquo; him heah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. No. Honest to God&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly Dunn, I&rsquo;ve had my doubts aboot you lately. An&rsquo;
  now I&rsquo;m shore.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim managed to move enough to get his eyes from under Molly&rsquo;s
  disheveled hair. He needed only one look up at Slinger Dunn&rsquo;s face to
  understand Molly&rsquo;s terror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunn, she&rsquo;s not a liar,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly. &ldquo;She
  couldn&rsquo;t have known I was on the trail. I was trailing the man who cut
  the drift fence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, she&rsquo;d lie an&rsquo; you&rsquo;d swear to it.&rdquo; His
  piercing gaze rested curiously on Jim. &ldquo;How&rsquo;n hell do you happen
  to be alive?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your bullet hit my watch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, heah&rsquo;s another,&rdquo; said Slinger, with strange
  intensity, and he brought the gun up to align it with Jim&rsquo;s head. But
  quick as a flash Molly covered Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Slinger, don&rsquo;t kill him,&rdquo; she
  begged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shore will. An&rsquo; I jest aboot as lief bore you, too.... Git
  up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He kicked Molly, and his boot came partly in contact with Jim&rsquo;s
  thigh. The brutality of it, after the deadly speech, seemed to liberate Jim
  from a cold paralysis.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let go of me, Molly,&rdquo; ordered Jim. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s such
  a skunk as that, he might kill you. And if he means to murder me you
  can&rsquo;t stop him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo;, Mister Traft,&rdquo; returned Dunn,
  harshly.</p>

  <p>Molly not only refused to move, but she got her arms around Jim, and clung
  to him, shielding his vital parts with her quivering body.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, you cain&rsquo;t shoot him&mdash;when he&rsquo;s
  down&mdash;crippled&mdash;defenseless,&rdquo; she burst out, passionately.
  &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be human. It wouldn&rsquo;t be like Slinger Dunn...
  . If it&rsquo;s on my account, you&rsquo;re wrong&mdash;terribly wrong. He
  never meant&mdash;bad by me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I reckon he&rsquo;s <i>done</i> bad by you. An&rsquo;
  you&rsquo;re not only lyin&rsquo; for him, but givin&rsquo; yourself
  away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You cold-hearted devil!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How could you
  have a decent thought? ... Kill me, too!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. You damn little hussy! ... But bein&rsquo; daid
  wouldn&rsquo;t hide your shame, Molly Dunn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Arch, there&rsquo;s no shame.... There&rsquo;s been
  nothin&rsquo; but thoughts an&rsquo; feelin&rsquo;s that have changed me... .
  I love him. Cain&rsquo;t you see it? I love him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I ain&rsquo;t blind,&rdquo; replied Slinger, and reaching down
  he laid hold of Molly and tried to pull her off. But she clung like a leech.
  Then with a curse he shifted his hold to her hair. Even then he could only
  budge her by savage force, and he had to step on Jim&rsquo;s shoulder to keep
  her from lifting him with her. Suddenly Molly, fierce as a wildcat, flung
  herself upon Slinger, and fought him for the gun, which he held out in his
  right hand.</p>

  <p>The girl&rsquo;s courage, following her declaration of love, roused the
  lion in Jim. With all his might he kicked Dunn&rsquo;s hand, knocking the gun
  out of it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold still!&mdash;Somebody comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; whispered Dunn,
  hoarsely, stiffening.</p>

  <p>Molly slipped out of his grasp, down to the ground. Jim listened, but
  could hear nothing save the pounding of his heart. Dunn stood strung like a
  listening deer, gradually relaxing his intensity. He might have been
  mistaken. But during this short interval he had removed his eyes from Molly,
  who suddenly snatched up the gun. She held it low, with both hands tight,
  pointing up at Dunn&rsquo;s body.</p>

  <p>Jim could not bear the terrible intent expressed in her face and eyes. He
  grasped the gun, turned it aside.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, you mustn&rsquo;t shed your brother&rsquo;s blood&mdash;even
  to save my life,&rdquo; he said, very low. And at his words she relinquished
  the gun.</p>

  <p>Slinger Dunn seemed to be calculating desperate chances. That Jim would
  not instantly turn the gun on him never flashed into his consciousness. Jim
  grasped this and thought he might turn it to good account. The last thing he
  could be forced to do would be to kill Molly&rsquo;s brother.</p>

  <p>Then the brush crashed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Hands up!</i>&rdquo; came in cool, sharp voice that made
  Jim&rsquo;s blood leap.</p>

  <p>Dunn&rsquo;s back was turned. Swiftly he elevated his arms high above his
  head. Jim moved to see that Curly Prentiss had appeared round the corner of
  the lean-to. He held a cocked gun.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come round heah, Bud,&rdquo; he called. And with more crashing in
  the brush Bud Chalfack followed his extended rifle into view. Both cowboys
  stepped closer, eyes quick and hard.</p>

  <p>Jim slipped Dunn&rsquo;s gun out of sight&mdash;an act as impulsively
  swift as the thought that prompted it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Face around heah,&rdquo; ordered Curly, and as Dunn pivoted he
  showed no surprise, but an alert, cold suspicion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Gawd!&rdquo; shouted Bud. &ldquo;Look, Curly! If there
  ain&rsquo;t the boss ... an&rsquo; Molly Dunn!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim seized avidly upon his opportunity, though his wit and spirit far
  exceeded his physical strength.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hello&mdash;boys!&rdquo; he began, huskily. &ldquo;So you found
  me&mdash;at last.... Put up your guns.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong heah?&rdquo; demanded Curly, and Jim&rsquo;s
  heart felt a rush of warm gladness and thrill at the significance of the
  cowboys&rsquo; mien.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong, Curly&mdash;now&mdash;you&rsquo;ve found me,&rdquo;
  replied Jim, cheerfully, though he realized his appearance must have given
  the lie to his words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, you&rsquo;re pretty white&mdash;an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s blood
  on your shirt,&rdquo; returned Curly, sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet. But put down your gun&mdash;and you, too, Bud. I&rsquo;m
  nervous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you look it,&rdquo; growled Curly, complying with Jim&rsquo;s
  order. Bud likewise lowered his weapon. &ldquo;I reckon you&rsquo;d better
  talk fast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly,&rdquo; burst out Jim, in relief, &ldquo;yesterday I found a
  cut in the drift fence. And horse tracks on the trail. I followed them down
  here.... Somebody shot me, knocked me galley-west off my horse.... When I
  came to, Molly Dunn was bathing my face. Pretty lucky for me she happened to
  ride along. She was on her way up to camp&mdash;to warn me that Jocelyn and
  the Cibeque outfit had planned to kidnap me&mdash;for ransom. She heard the
  shot and found me.... Well, it turned out the bullet had glanced off my watch
  and cut up through my shoulder. We tied it up. I wasn&rsquo;t able to get on
  my horse. Molly wanted to ride up to camp and fetch you, but I thought
  it&rsquo;d be best for her to go home. You fellows would probably trail me,
  and if you didn&rsquo;t she could ride up today.... Well, Molly came today,
  and it seems that her brother trailed her. Found us here. And, well&mdash;the
  truth is, he thinks I&rsquo;m a bad egg&mdash;and had evil intentions toward
  Molly. That upset me&mdash;and made Molly sore. We were having hell when you
  came up.... And, I reckon&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger Dunn, you&rsquo;re shore a hell of a bright fellar,&rdquo;
  quoth Curly, with all the sarcasm of a disgusted cowboy. &ldquo;Let your
  hands down. An&rsquo; mebbe you&rsquo;d do well to make yourself scarce
  around heah. But before you go you put this in your pipe an&rsquo; smoke it,
  you &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; hard nut of a Cibeque gun-slinger!&mdash;My
  boss, Jim Traft, wouldn&rsquo;t never have evil intentions toward <i>no</i>
  gurl, much less so sweet an&rsquo; luvly a little lady as your
  sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger, sumbody ought to beat the daylights out of you,&rdquo;
  added Bud, with even more scorn. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll bet you a hat
  the boss will do it sometime.... Me an&rsquo; Curly both made up to Molly.
  Was we good enough fer her? No, we was not. Mebbe Jim <i>was</i> good enough.
  But you can gamble both he an&rsquo; Molly are above your low-down
  suspicions.... Now you mozey along, and hereafter stay on your side of the
  fence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Slinger eyed them while they delivered their separate speeches, and then
  looked strangely down upon Molly, who had rallied somewhat from the ravages
  of emotion, and lastly at Jim. There was little to be made of his impassive
  face, strong and hard as brown stone. Then he strode out to disappear in the
  brush.</p>

  <p>The situation lost its suspense.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You dog-gone old tenderfoot!&rdquo; said Curly, sitting down beside
  Jim, to place a hand on him. &ldquo;Gone an&rsquo; got yourself shot fer the
  Diamond! I shore hope it ain&rsquo;t bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bud crowded in beside Molly. &ldquo;Boss, I wuz orful scared fust off.
  &rsquo;Course we didn&rsquo;t see who it wuz.... Gosh! I never wuz so glad
  aboot nothin&rsquo;.... Did thet bullet go deep?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not very. I bled a good deal. And I&rsquo;m sore. But I should
  think you could hold me on my horse and get me up to camp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so little Molly found you!&rdquo; ejaculated Curly,
  tossing his sombrero and shaking his curly head, while he bent bright knowing
  eyes upon the confused girl. &ldquo;My Gawd! the luck uv some fellars! ...
  How air you, Miss Molly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so well, this minute, Mr. Prentiss,&rdquo; replied Molly, with
  a wan smile. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m shore glad&mdash;the way it&rsquo;s turned
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Molly!&rdquo; drawled Bud. &ldquo;You look orful purty this
  minnit. So you saved our boss? Wal, I reckon now the Diamond will belong to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; interposed Jim, with a happy ring in his voice,
  &ldquo;I know <i>a</i> diamond that will be Molly&rsquo;s, if she&rsquo;ll
  take it&mdash;along with the boss of the Diamond.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The cowboys looked bewildered volumes and were speechless, which loss of
  function absolutely testified to a state so rare in them. And Molly was
  hopelessly stricken and confused. She had no strength left, even if rebellion
  was in her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You boys take yourselves off in the woods for ten minutes,&rdquo;
  ordered Jim, audaciously.</p>

  <p>Curly got up awkwardly, after the manner of cowboys, and Bud followed
  suit. It was just as well, thought Jim, that he had flabbergasted them and
  then had not allowed them time to recover. Signs were forthcoming of
  potential and scintillating cowboy wit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But say good-by to Molly,&rdquo; added Jim, relenting.</p>

  <p>Curly had dignity and selflessness. &ldquo;Miss Molly, you shore hev my
  thanks. Jim has won over the Diamond, an&rsquo; if, as he hints, he&rsquo;s
  won you&mdash;wal, I don&rsquo;t wonder, an&rsquo; I reckon him the luckiest
  fellar on the range. Good-by an&rsquo; good luck.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bud, however, availed himself of an opportunity to make sheep&rsquo;s
  eyes. &ldquo;Molly, good-by, an&rsquo; so long&rsquo;s it can&rsquo;t be
  <i>me</i>, I reckon you&rsquo;ve made the best deal by ropin&rsquo; the
  boss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They slumped away into the spruce, leaving a pleasant jingle of spurs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re terrible&mdash;an&rsquo; lovable, too,&rdquo;
  burst out Molly, lifting a flushed face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet they are. But that tickled me, Molly,&rdquo; declared Jim.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a time with them. And of all the tables turned on them,
  this with you is the best!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Jim, it cain&rsquo;t ever be true,&rdquo; she murmured,
  sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forget your trouble now, Molly dear,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;You
  must hurry home. I&rsquo;ll find some way to let you hear from me. A
  letter&mdash;or I&rsquo;ll come to West Fork.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t! It wouldn&rsquo;t be safe!&rdquo; she
  cried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I think we turned the table on Slinger, too. That fellow is
  no clod.... Darling, do you know you told him&mdash;<i>you loved
  me</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What else could I do?&rdquo; wailed Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Heavens, tell me you didn&rsquo;t lie!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She turned away her face. &ldquo;No, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You do love me?&rdquo; he implored, drawing her close.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t help it.... But don&rsquo;t ask me&mdash;never no
  more&mdash;what you did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;re going to be distressed. But, Molly
  Dunn, that offer stands!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&mdash;What do you think I&rsquo;m made of, anyhow? ...
  But, Jim, the wonderfulest thing I ever lived was when you hatched that lie
  to save Slinger.... That Prentiss boy is a real hombre. He&rsquo;d have shot
  Slinger in the wink of an eye. An&rsquo; my brother knew it.... Jim, if I
  hadn&rsquo;t loved you before that I&rsquo;d have done it after.... Perhaps
  it&rsquo;s all for some good. You shore have changed me. Who knows? Maybe
  even Slinger Dunn might be made to see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had the same thought, Molly,&rdquo; said Jim, earnestly.
  &ldquo;And some day I&rsquo;ll follow it up.... Now you must go,
  Molly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He released her, won to solicitude by the gray hue and strain of face she
  betrayed. But suddenly she surprised him by flinging her arms around his neck
  and pressing lips and cheeks to his. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Jim! <i>Jim!</i> ...
  &rdquo; Then she rose and ran into the spruce.</p>

  <p>Jim lay back spent, elated, conscious of recurring pangs in his wounds,
  overcome by his feelings. So that sooner or later, when the cowboys returned
  of their own accord, it was no wonder they were concerned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lemme see where he got plugged?&rdquo; growled Curly, and with Bud
  assisting, he untied the bandages. &ldquo;Wal, Bud,&rdquo; he continued,
  presently, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only a groove, an&rsquo; we could do no better
  by it.... Reckon it&rsquo;s the gurl thet took the sap out of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Anyone could see he was light-haided,&rdquo; replied Bud,
  plaintively. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it funny what a lovely female can do to a
  fellar? But, my Gawd! if I&rsquo;d been Jim&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Idiots!&rdquo; burst out Jim, opening his eyes and sitting up.
  &ldquo;Shut up and get me to camp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ex-coose us, boss,&rdquo; said Curly, hastily. &ldquo;You see, we
  was comin&rsquo; back&mdash;reckonin&rsquo; your&mdash;the little lady had
  gone&mdash;but jest then she pounced on you,
  an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, you needn&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; interrupted Jim.
  &ldquo;You are a couple of two-faced demons from Hades. Find my horse.
  He&rsquo;s hobbled here somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, boss, I understand you,&rdquo; drawled Curly, as he got up.
  &ldquo;My conscience has stung me more&rsquo;n onct fer mistrustin&rsquo; my
  friends on account uv a gurl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They ambled away into the woods, snickering and talking low, and presently
  Curly&rsquo;s mellow laugh rolled out. Jim had to love them, realizing they
  were secretly delighted with his conquest of Molly Dunn. But what would his
  uncle Jim say? Jim wisely decided to withhold the matter until sometime when
  he could contrive to have the old bachelor cattleman see Molly in that white
  dress. Then the rest would be easy. Just here, however, he happened to
  remember Molly had refused him and importuned him not to ask her &ldquo;never
  no more.&rdquo; The poor harassed, conscientious, adorable child!</p>

  <p>Presently Jim&rsquo;s reverie was disrupted by the advent of the cowboys
  with his horse and their own. Bud found his saddle, and then came into the
  lean-to for the blankets.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on, you boss of the Diamond,&rdquo; he said, making no effort
  to help Jim up.</p>

  <p>Jim slowly crawled to a post of the lean-to and using that as a support he
  labored to a standing position. For a moment he felt dizzy. Then it
  passed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fetch this medicine and towel,&rdquo; he said, as he walked
  out.</p>

  <p>Bud was singing one of his Texas ditties: &ldquo;When a boy falls in love
  with a pretty turtle dove, He will linger all around her under
  jaw&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They made no move to help Jim on his horse, and he certainly gave no hint
  that their aid would have been most helpful. This cowboy school was a hard
  one. Jim remembered something about the Spartans, and concluded that
  Curly&rsquo;s and Bud&rsquo;s mothers had been Spartans. He swung up into the
  saddle to fierce shooting pangs through his shoulder.</p>

  <p>They rode off, with Bud leading the way, and Curly beside Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss,&rdquo; he said, abruptly, &ldquo;are you shore Slinger Dunn
  didn&rsquo;t shoot you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say! Whatever gave you that idea?&rdquo; queried Jim, who did not
  need to feign surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, when he turned round he shore expected to be bored. An&rsquo;
  fact is, I come damn near borin&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have made a terrible mistake, Curly,&rdquo; rejoined
  Jim, seriously.</p>

  <p>Jim managed fairly well in the saddle on the level ground, and even up the
  first gradual ascent of the trail, but when they reached the steep and rough
  part he had to hold on to the pommel. And he had never before suffered such
  sickening weakness and pain. But he stuck it out. He realized that he could
  do it, else these cowboys would never have let him tackle it alone.
  Nevertheless, he ground his teeth to keep from calling out. If anything in
  the world could have kept Jim Traft from falling out of his saddle, upon
  arriving in camp, it would have been the warwhoop the cowboys let out when
  they saw him. But even that could not do it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">A WHOLE week had to pass by before Molly Dunn came out of
  her trance. &ldquo;I shore been walkin&rsquo; in my sleep,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>

  <p>Good luck facilitated an otherwise insupportable situation. Her parents
  never learned she had been away from home nearly the whole of two days.
  Slinger had arrived at the cabin before Molly, and Molly had a suspicion it
  had been through him, somehow, that their mother had not become aware of her
  absence. She felt Slinger&rsquo;s eyes upon her, at times when she was not
  looking at him, but he never spoke to her, never gave any indication that he
  heard her. More significant of his mental chaos were the hours he spent
  sitting idle. Sometimes he would go into the field and work, careful to take
  a rifle along. Molly would catch a glimpse of him, leaning motionless on a
  spade, looking off into the forest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whatever ails your brother?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Dunn. &ldquo;I
  hear him walkin&rsquo; the porch at nights.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ma, I reckon he&rsquo;s in love,&rdquo; replied Molly,
  mischievously, &ldquo;Folks get queer when they&rsquo;re that way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> know, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said her mother.</p>

  <p>Molly nursed a calamitous conviction that she did. And she became
  grief-stricken.</p>

  <p>She fell into a state in which there were no moments of relaxation, or
  dream, or relief from misery. Her heart was broken and she wanted to die. She
  thought of drowning herself in the great Maple Spring, and pictured herself
  lying at the edge, down in the clear water, her face white and her hair
  waving, and her eyes wide open, staring up at the cruel world which she had
  chosen to relinquish. There was some consolation in this picture. Arch would
  find her and suffer sorrow that he had been partly the cause of her demise.
  The thought of a conscience-stricken mother was not unpleasant. And then Jim
  might be the first to discover her lying cold and dead in the spring. Where
  he had driven her! The aching ecstasy of this thought vanished in sudden pain
  and self-reproach. Why should she make Jim suffer? He had done nothing but
  fall in love with her&mdash;nearly lose his life through her. He had lifted
  her out of obscurity. He had exalted her. No! She could not make him any
  unhappier than he was already. She had to forswear thought of suicide.</p>

  <p>She could not do her work, which involved her in trouble with her mother.
  She moped all day, most of it in some corner; and she chose the dark and bare
  and squalid places, that seemed to be in harmony with her moods. At dusk she
  sat out in the clearing, on a stump, and watched the bats and the
  night-hawks. She did not sleep well. Many hours she crouched at her little
  window in the loft, and during those when the gloom and silence of dawn
  seemed like her life, she suffered most.</p>

  <p>A second Sunday came. Would she date all the rest of her life from that
  last day in the woods with Jim Traft? What would become of her? When Andy
  called she begged him to excuse her. &ldquo;Why, gurl, you&rsquo;re sick! You
  look turrible!&rdquo; he said, anxiously.</p>

  <p>Then in the afternoon young Keech came on horseback. He was very
  mysterious, and Molly felt she would presently be rude, but he whispered to
  her that he had brought something for her which he had left outside by the
  fence. He gave no explanation and departed even more mysteriously than he had
  come, even winking at her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darn fool!&rdquo; muttered Molly, who had no patience these days.
  &ldquo;Whatever is he up to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, curiosity consumed her and she went out by the gate and
  searched in the bushes. There she stumbled upon a large package, neatly tied
  in paper, the like of which she had seen in the big Flagerstown store. Molly
  was puzzled. Had young Keech begun to &ldquo;spark&ldquo; her in this
  romantic manner? It was highly improbable, because if he had fetched her
  presents he would most assuredly want to see her reaction to them.</p>

  <p>No! That package was Jim Traft&rsquo;s first message. Molly divined it,
  and passionately she reproached herself for her doubt of him. Still, he might
  have forgotten her. This might be a joke, or anything.</p>

  <p>Molly watched her chance to carry the parcel in unobserved, and up to the
  sanctity of her attic. Then, with trembling hands and beating heart, she
  opened it. Inside were three smaller parcels, and some books, one old and
  several new. One parcel was a box of candy tied with ribbons. Another
  contained the most beautiful silk scarf Molly had ever seen. The third was a
  little sewing-kit, containing everything imaginable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore it&rsquo;s from Jim&mdash;bless his heart!&rdquo; she
  murmured, and searched frantically for a note. There appeared to be none, and
  her wild hopes subsided. She examined the books and thrilled at their titles.
  The old book was a school grammar and had the look of long thumbing. Then on
  the fly-leaf she discovered handwriting: &ldquo;James Traft. Wellsville High
  School. Sept. 1, 1878.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll be dog-goned! He&rsquo;s sent me his school-book,
  of ten years ago! ... Now what in the dickens does he mean by
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly was thrilled, puzzled, and then suddenly dismayed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  a hint for me to study how to talk correct,&rdquo; she muttered, resentfully.
  But anger would not abide with her. One single query drove it away. Why
  should Jim Traft want her to make up for her lack of education? There could
  be only one answer. And straightway Molly was lifted to the skies and plunged
  into the depths. She had imagined&mdash;most absurdly&mdash;that he had
  repented of his rash offer, and had let her go at her own valuation. But he
  had not. He wished her to study. He believed in her. He meant&mdash;But Molly
  dared not follow on that thought.</p>

  <p>Molly hugged the grammar, miserably sure of her mingled pain and joy. She
  put it under her pillow. She kissed the silken scarf and tied it round her
  neck. And all the rest of that afternoon she sat by her window, devouring
  both the candy and the story-books. A hundred times she looked dreamily out,
  to whisper: &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he write me a letter?&rdquo; And after a
  while it dawned upon her wondrously that Jim Traft, despite his demands, was
  trying to make it easy for her.</p>

  <p>All during the next week, Molly studied, day after day until her eyes
  ached. She taunted herself, but she could not help it. The brooding thoughts
  of making away with herself recurred, but they could not gain any hold in
  this new and strange consciousness. There seemed to be a joy even in her
  torment. Why could not her life be like that of the girls in the story-books?
  When she had punished herself greatly with their power over her, then she
  went back to the grammar.</p>

  <p>The next Sunday Molly waited all day for another possible visit from young
  Keech. But he did not come and she had to fight bitter disappointment. Reason
  came back to her, however, after she had become thoroughly wretched. Keech
  would have to ride to Flagerstown&mdash;a whole day, and another back home.
  Then it would take the same time to make the trip down the Cibeque and back.
  Four days out of one week! That was too much. But he might come again the
  following Sunday, and she lived on hope of that.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile September was far on its way. The golden flowers of autumn had
  begun to line the trails and fields. In the glen the ferns were turning
  brown. High up in the notches under the Diamond the scarlet, and purple, and
  gold, had begun to burn in the sunlight. Fall had come&mdash;the season Molly
  loved best.</p>

  <p>Slinger still stayed at home, though now he went to the village; and Molly
  detected that he drank. Once or twice he had spoken gruffly to her. And he
  had cut the corn and packed it in to the crib; he had repaired the fence to
  keep the hogs out; he had begun to haul and chop the winter supply of
  firewood.</p>

  <p>Molly marveled and sadly divined the torment in him. No doubt he had
  expected a visit from the Flagerstown sheriff, or the cowboys of the Diamond.
  But they did not appear. And no word of Jim Traft having been shot by
  fence-cutters had yet reached West Fork. Molly believed now that it never
  would, and so she told her brother.</p>

  <p>Other news and rumors were rife, however, some of which might be true.
  Work on the drift fence had not progressed beyond Tobe&rsquo;s Well. All the
  labor that the Diamond put in was in repairing sections that had been laid
  low. Small herds of stock had been reported on the trails, driven by riders
  whose names were not even whispered in West Fork. Money appeared plentiful in
  the village. There had been several shooting frays, of small consequence, one
  of which had been an attack on Andy Stoneham while walking the trail to
  Molly&rsquo;s home.</p>

  <p>Another Sunday arrived, and with it, after Molly had waited long agonizing
  hours, young Keech with more of a mysterious air, more assurance that he
  shared a great secret, more winks and grins. He nearly drove Molly mad. He
  stayed for a whole insupportable hour, during which, before her drooping
  father and her inquisitive mother, and once or twice her sharp-eyed brother,
  Molly had to maintain her equilibrium as well as the demeanor of a village
  maiden entertaining a visitor. At last Keech said he wanted to run down to
  West Fork, and Molly accompanied him as far as the lane that led out from the
  barn, where he had left his horse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a pack fer you inside, hid in the corner,&rdquo; he
  informed her, with a meaning grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop in on my way back,
  in case you want to send a letter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Letter!&rdquo; faltered Molly. &ldquo;How&mdash;how soon&rsquo;ll
  you be back?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon aboot sundown. I&rsquo;ll whistle,&rdquo; he returned, and
  rode off down the lane.</p>

  <p>Molly watched him guiltily. He seemed to take it for granted that she was
  a party to this courtship of Jim Traft&rsquo;s. The affair certainly could
  not be kept secret very long, even if young Keech justified the trust Jim had
  in him. Molly knew these youngsters. Soon everybody would learn that she was
  accepting gifts from the nephew of rich old Traft, and that would only be
  another black mark for Molly Dunn of the Cibeque. Not that Molly cared on her
  own account&mdash;she was thinking of Jim, and how her people and neighbors
  of West Fork would only have more against him. It would never enter their
  heads that he might have honorable intentions. Oh, if she could only let them
  know his honesty&mdash;his goodness!</p>

  <p>She went in the barn and found the pack. Three times as large and heavy as
  the first one! Molly&rsquo;s fingers burned to open it, but she resolutely
  hid it and ran back to the house. She would return it. But no, she had not
  the strength to do that, let alone hurt Jim&rsquo;s feelings. She would write
  and tell him not to send any more.</p>

  <p>Up by her loft window, Molly labored over that letter and her tears fell
  upon it. She was aware that she was placing in Jim&rsquo;s hands documental
  proof of her lack of education. It hurt her, but she was not ashamed, and she
  wrote as she would have talked. She had meant to make it short, which
  intention turned out to be impossible. For she had to explain to Jim why he
  must not send more presents, why he must forget her. And then she seemed
  driven to add more, the content of which she scarcely realized and that she
  dared not read over.</p>

  <p>She was sad while she waited in the lane for Keech, yet conscious of
  something she had not felt before. She was proving to herself and to Jim that
  she did not wholly lack decency and consideration. A melancholy consolation
  came to her. This was the end of her brief little romance.</p>

  <p>Keech trotted down the lane, and received the letter as a matter of
  course. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rustle along, Molly. I&rsquo;m stoppin&rsquo; at
  the head of the Cibeque. Have a little sparkin&rsquo; to do on my own hook.
  Haw! Haw! ... Good-by till next time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly watched him ride away into the gloom of the forest. And when he had
  gone she stood there, looking up at the grand bulk of the Diamond, from the
  rugged rim of which the afterglow of sunset was fading, and felt vaguely that
  somehow she was a forlorn little soul, cheated of love and happiness. Yet she
  was glad she had arisen to the heights, even if forever afterward she must be
  plunged into the depths.</p>

  <p>Under cover of the thickening dusk she secured the pack and carried it to
  the cabin and up to her secluded abode. There was at least one exceedingly
  good feature about her room, and it was that nobody ever got up there. Molly
  could not remember when anyone, except Arch, who had patched the roof, had
  invaded her retreat.</p>

  <p>Panting, Molly sat down by her window, with her hand on the precious pack.
  She would revel in opening it, and in its contents, which must do for all
  time. Little chance of her ever having another suitor and less of her ever
  wanting one!</p>

  <p>Dusk had settled down now. Her window was open, and a cool air began to
  move down from the mountain. The pines stood up like a black fringe. She
  could see the hideous dead trees in the clearing, and the pale blot of the
  bare fields. A cowbell tinkled, and somewhere a hound bayed. It seemed very
  sweet and peaceful there. Molly felt that strife and anguish were matters of
  the heart.</p>

  <p>At last she lighted her lamp, and in its uncertain light she opened the
  pack, ashamed of her rapture, yet utterly victim to it. Carefully she
  assorted the parcels, little and big, searching for a letter. But again there
  was none. And Molly was glad. If she read written words of love and hope and
  demand from him she would be as unstable as water. Suppose he should take
  exception to her letter of renunciation and boldly come to see her? Her heart
  gave a wild leap, then subsided proportionately. He would not come. He had
  pride and he would never stand more than a second refusal from Molly
  Dunn.</p>

  <p>More books, and these from St. Louis! To her amaze all the parcels were
  marked with the name of that distant Eastern city. He had sent for things.
  The Flagerstown stores were not good enough for her. How could she ever
  resist his way of making somebody of her? Then for the ensuing hour she
  marveled at and gloated over a multiplicity of pretty and useful little
  presents. He did not submerge her with an overwhelming sense of great
  expenditure. He had tact and taste. &ldquo;Oh, the darlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she
  murmured, &ldquo;if he ever sees me again&mdash;it&rsquo;s shore all day with
  me!&rdquo; Then she crawled into bed and cried herself to sleep.</p>

  <p>During the next few days Molly went through a hundred variations of mood,
  ranging from lofty pride to self-pity, from resignation to furious revolt.
  And then she seemed to fix upon a settled wretchedness. Yet the days passed
  and life had to be lived and neglected work done.</p>

  <p>On Saturday afternoon she went to the village with her mother, the first
  visit there for a month. It was the one day in the week when there was any
  activity at West Fork. Molly felt a reluctance to being seen, yet a tingling
  curiosity in regard to possible rumors. She knew she could tell instantly,
  when she met any of the girls or young men, if they had heard of the
  marvelous romance that had enmeshed her.</p>

  <p>But she was to discover that, so far as her acquaintances were concerned,
  Molly Dunn was the same old Molly Dunn as ever. Strange to realize, Molly was
  chagrined. If they could know how far she had been removed from the ordinary
  life of West Fork!</p>

  <p>Old Enoch Summers&rsquo; establishment, that combined several stores in a
  row, all connected, stood on the main corner of the village street, and next
  to it was Mace&rsquo;s Saloon, a place of doubtful character, and one which
  Summers openly frowned upon, but in which rumor gave him a large interest.
  Board porches high off the ground, with wide steps in the middle and at each
  end, were a feature of West Fork&rsquo;s few business houses. Saddle-horses
  and buckboards, along the hitching-rails, attested to visitors in town. And
  in the next block all the available room along the plank sidewalk was taken
  up by wagons and buggies.</p>

  <p>Molly for once was glad she had come with her mother, of whom it had been
  said that she had scant civility for Molly&rsquo;s admirers. They came at
  length to Summers&rsquo; store, where Molly had to run the gauntlet of
  numerous men, old and young, strangers and acquaintances. It was a busy hour
  for the village merchant and his clerks. Mrs. Dunn and Molly had to await
  their turn, and when Mrs. Dunn met the worst gossip in West Fork, to become
  avidly absorbed at once, Molly, as a matter of self-preservation as well as
  taste, strolled on through this store into the next. Presently she found
  herself quite near the door, and curiously took a peep out. A young man had
  just ridden up to the porch. And when Molly recognized Jim Traft she nearly
  dropped to the floor. Fate had led her aimlessly to that door&mdash;for this.
  Then as the usual hum of talk of the loungers outside abruptly ceased, Molly
  realized that she was indeed not the only interested one. Jim surveyed the
  group on the porch, then dismounted and threw his bridle, to step up half the
  steps.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, coolly, and his resonant
  voice carried. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Jim Traft and I&rsquo;m looking for
  Slinger Dunn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly bit her tongue to keep from crying out. Her next impulse was to rush
  to Jim. But that would be a crazy thing to do. He certainly would resent it.
  Her quick glance flashed over his lithe figure. He wore corduroys, high
  top-boots, and a brown shirt. Manifestly he could not have had a weapon upon
  him. Relief mitigated Molly&rsquo;s terror. He did not mean to fight, and
  certainly Slinger, no matter how provoked, could not shoot an unarmed man
  before all these people. Jim did not look exactly pleasant, but how fine,
  Molly thought, and manly and clean-eyed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Mister Traft, you&rsquo;ll find Slinger in Mace&rsquo;s
  saloon,&rdquo; drawled some one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied Traft, and flipping a silver dollar to an
  urchin there, he said, &ldquo;Johnny, go in and tell Slinger Dunn that if he
  isn&rsquo;t afraid to come out Jim Traft would like to see him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boy snatched up the coin and bounded off the porch. Jim stepped up
  another step. He appeared composed, but pale. He had some deep motive in
  bearding Slinger Dunn right in his own den. Molly fell prey to a tumult of
  thrill and shudder. She could not have rushed out now, for she was riveted to
  the spot. Traft&rsquo;s message had caused a low exclamation to run through
  the occupants of the porch, a dozen or more of whom Molly could see through
  door and window. Jim surely would have espied her had he looked in. But he
  faced down the porch, toward Mace&rsquo;s saloon.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By gum! Slinger&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said some one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckoned thet&rsquo;d fetch him,&rdquo; replied another. These two
  stood near the door and partly shielded Molly. She wrenched at her fettered
  feet, to move a little forward, the better to see. However, she could not see
  Slinger yet. People in the store behind her approached.</p>

  <p>Then the slow step of a spurred boot sent a combined fire and ice over
  Molly. Slinger came into view, crossed the porch to confront Traft.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you send thet kid in heah,&rdquo; and Slinger jerked his left
  hand backward. His right hung significantly free and low, &ldquo;askin&rsquo;
  me out if I wasn&rsquo;t afeard?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Slinger. Yes, I did,&rdquo; replied Jim, and he stepped up
  the last step. After a keen fearless glance straight into Slinger&rsquo;s
  eyes, he extinguished the cigarette he carried and dropped it off the porch.
  It was noticeable that he wore gloves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you want to be careful aboot sendin&rsquo; fer me thet
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No offense. I just wanted you outside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what fer, Mister Traft?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Several things, Slinger, and for that reason I&rsquo;m glad some of
  your friends and town folks are present,&rdquo; replied Traft. A small group
  of men had followed Dunn out of the saloon, but did not come up on the porch.
  In fact, they edged out toward the hitching-rail.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; demanded Dunn, in mingled anger and
  amaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;First I want to tell you I&rsquo;m sorry my outfit suspected you of
  cutting our drift fence. We found out who did it, and though we never said it
  was you, we think we owe you an apology. So I&rsquo;m apologizing for myself
  and the Diamond&mdash;to you, publicly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it wasn&rsquo;t necessary fer nobody to apologize to
  <i>me</i>,&rdquo; returned Dunn, with a grim laugh. &ldquo;All the same, I
  hadn&rsquo;t nuthin&rsquo; to do with cuttin&rsquo; your drift
  fence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, that settles that. Now you settle <i>this</i>. There&rsquo;s
  talk going around about your sister and me. Some of it is credited to you.
  Did you tell Hack Jocelyn and Seth Haverly that you not only heard I had
  insulted Molly&mdash;mistreated her, but you <i>believed</i> it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon I did, Mister Traft,&rdquo; replied Slinger, not shorn of
  his personality, because nothing could have done that, but plainly
  staggered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Traft, raising his voice. &ldquo;Now listen.
  You are dead wrong. I fell in love with Molly&mdash;pretty pronto, I admit.
  And I asked her to marry me. <i>Twice!</i> ... Was that an insult? I shall
  ask her again. Will that be an insult?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t see it thet way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;well, embrace her <i>before</i> I asked her. But I
  meant no insult. I was just excited&mdash;out of my head. Could that be held
  against me by any fair-minded person&mdash;knowing I followed it up with an
  offer of marriage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, it couldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; declared Dunn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks again.... Well, Molly refused me. And one of the reasons she
  gave me was that she was Slinger Dunn&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly saw Arch flinch, and tremendously agitated as she was she felt a
  pang for him. This Jim Traft had a tongue as deadly as a bullet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Slinger Dunn, listen,&rdquo; added Traft, his voice rising to
  a ring. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to hear something. If you were half the man
  you think you are you&rsquo;d quit this lazy, drinking, gun-slinging life for
  your sister&rsquo;s sake. She&rsquo;s a fine little girl&mdash;good as gold,
  damn your stupid heart! And she deserves a better fate than to be disgraced
  and degraded by a rotten two-bit of a desperado brother.... But you&rsquo;ve
  not got sense enough to see what she&rsquo;s worth. And as for your talk
  about her, well, you are a dirty, low-down skunk. You&rsquo;re a yellow dog.
  You&rsquo;re a liar, and a suspicious, miserable Cibeque blood-spiller. Now,
  I&rsquo;m not much on guns, but if you&rsquo;re not a coward&mdash;a
  <i>coward</i>,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll lay off that gun-belt. And I&rsquo;ll
  swear, if I don&rsquo;t beat you as you deserve, I&rsquo;ll borrow a gun from
  somebody here, and fight you your own way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without the slightest hesitation Slinger unbuckled his belt, containing
  the heavy gun, and handed it shakily over to some one. He sailed his sombrero
  off the porch, exposing a livid face. He made a gesture, eloquent of supreme
  fury, and added to it with incoherent speech. Then like a panther he leaped
  at Traft.</p>

  <p>Molly saw Jim move as quickly, just as Slinger reached him, and appeared
  to strike at the same instant. The blow cracked. Its force, added to
  Slinger&rsquo;s momentum, sent him off the porch, where only a remarkable
  agility kept him on his feet. But he thumped solidly against the
  hitching-rail, which broke. Horses snorted and jumped. The crowd let out a
  whoop. Fights were mostly as common as meals in the Cibeque and infinitely
  more amusing. People inside the store crowded out, and joining the men cut
  off Molly&rsquo;s view. She edged out, back to the wall, fearful, yet
  tremendously impelled. She had gloried in Jim&rsquo;s brave front, but she
  felt he would be helpless in a fight with Slinger. Bumping against a bench,
  Molly stepped up on it.</p>

  <p>She saw Jim go down off the steps to meet Slinger. Then began a fierce
  exchange of blows, with Slinger slowly forced backward in front of
  Mace&rsquo;s saloon. Something was wrong, or unusual, Molly vaguely gathered
  from the exclamations and whispers of the villagers. Slinger Dunn had the
  reputation of being able to whip his weight in wildcats. But evidently he was
  slow in getting started here. Suddenly a blow upset him, and he plumped down
  ridiculously. The crowd warming to the fight greeted that with yells.</p>

  <p>Slinger bounced up, only to be knocked down again. Then pandemonium broke
  loose. The young man from the Diamond might not be going to get mauled into a
  pulp. He might be cordially hated, but that had nothing to do with the
  surprise and glee of the West Forkers. Molly could not longer distinguish the
  shouts, the jeers, the egging on of the contestants, the riotous advice.</p>

  <p>Bounding up with the agility he was noted for, Slinger took a couple of
  nasty digs in order to get hold of Traft. He clinched and plainly sought to
  trip his antagonist or wrestle him down. But Jim was the heavier and
  stronger, for with a whirl and a fling he sent Slinger sprawling. This
  occasioned a sudden silence. Was it possible for Slinger Dunn to be
  worsted?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stand up and fight&mdash;you Indian!&rdquo; yelled Traft. And
  indeed Dunn had the look and the suppleness of an Indian.</p>

  <p>Dunn, now bloody and dirty, responded as if he had no control over
  himself, as if this taunting voice could drive him to anything. He crouched
  and bored in, fighting low, until Traft swung up under his guard.
  Dunn&rsquo;s head jerked up. Another blow sent it back, and a third, square
  on the nose, making the blood fly, landed him on his back.</p>

  <p>This time Slinger did not bounce up. Something was being battered into his
  consciousness&mdash;something that had already dawned upon the crowd. He
  slowly and cautiously rose, a stream of red running from his nose, down
  across his tight lips and protruding chin. Again he changed his tactics,
  proving that a fury of confidence had succeeded to grim realization, and that
  where an ordinary fighter would have been whipped he still had resource to
  spirit and energy. He tried a square stand up, give and take. It grew evident
  that had he adopted this style in the beginning he would at least have done
  better, for he hit Traft now and then. But the latter could take punishment.
  If it hurt he gave no sign. His method grew clear to the bystanders, and
  wagers were shouted out, backing him to win. Molly, in a fit of wild joy at
  Jim&rsquo;s unexpected and wonderful ability, jumped up and down on the
  bench, and it was not certain that she did not cry out.</p>

  <p>Soon down went Slinger again. The blow that prostrated him was from
  Traft&rsquo;s right, and was a swing, coming at the end of a succession of
  short blows, delivered fast and closely, no doubt to beat his antagonist back
  and out of balance. Anyway, Molly saw her brother go piling into the
  dust.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon now Slinger will rooster him, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s shore
  aboot time,&rdquo; declared a young fellow in front of Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yep. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m damn curious,&rdquo; replied his
  companion.</p>

  <p>Other remarks were not wanting. Evidently Slinger Dunn was not yet beaten.
  Molly had heard of the &ldquo;rooster&rdquo; trick in fighting, but had never
  seen it. And her lot had been to see many an encounter between boys of the
  Cibeque. She had seen more than one dance interrupted, with the dancers
  fleeing to the walls, while a fierce battle ensued in the middle of the
  floor.</p>

  <p>But fear for Jim had fled from Molly. He could meet any of Slinger&rsquo;s
  backwoods tricks.</p>

  <p>Slinger slowly circled Traft, keeping well away. Undoubtedly Traft was
  ready for a new attack. When he got rather close to the wall he divined that
  Dunn was trying to back him into such a position, whereupon he stood
  stock-still and waited. Suddenly Slinger dove down with incredible swiftness,
  on the back of his head and neck and elevated his feet even higher than his
  arms had been.</p>

  <p>His boots were armed with long spurs. He began to kick at Jim. He actually
  appeared to stand on the back of his neck and his elbows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rooster him, Slinger!&rdquo; bawled a lusty-lunged lout. And the
  crowd of West Forkers roared.</p>

  <p>Molly saw Jim back from this amazing onslaught, and that was what he
  should not have done. For Slinger, hunching himself on his elbows, quick as a
  cat, forced Jim to the wall. He dodged one vicious kick that raked the wall.
  Another caught him on his extended arm, tearing his sleeve from wrist to
  shoulder. Molly saw a glimpse of red. Then a cruel spur cut open Jim&rsquo;s
  chin. At this Molly screamed at her brother, but her voice was lost in the
  din. If Slinger did not kill Jim he would surely disfigure him for life. She
  leaped off the bench and darted here and there to get through the circle of
  men. Suddenly a louder yell, hoarse and thrilling, made Molly desperate. She
  squeezed into the front.</p>

  <p>Jim, in bent position, had both arms round Slinger&rsquo;s legs. The
  terrible spurs stuck up, but they scarcely moved. Jim threw Slinger from him
  with such force that he turned clear over, his head and shoulders acting as a
  pivot. He fell with a flop. Jim made one jump and landed square on him with
  both heavy boots. This overbalanced Jim, who went down, but he went down
  kicking. Rolling over, he was up and at Slinger just as that hideous
  blood-and-dirt begrimed individual tried to rise.</p>

  <p>Jim fastened both hands in his neck and lifted him and flung him sheer
  against the wall, where his head rang like bone on wood. But Jim did not
  stop. As Slinger, eyes rolling, tongue hanging out, was sinking down, Jim
  banged him against the wall again, and finished with a terrific sodden blow.
  Slinger sank down limp and senseless.</p>

  <p>The crowd grew silent. Molly had sense enough left to hide behind some
  one. Jim gazed down a long moment at his beaten antagonist, and then with
  scarf he wiped the blood and sweat and dirt from his face. He turned
  sidewise, so that Molly saw a pale tense cheek.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;See here&mdash;you fellows,&rdquo; panted Jim, &ldquo;I come
  down&mdash;here&mdash;to lick him&mdash;and to offer him&mdash;a job....
  Reckon he&rsquo;s not worth it.... But I&rsquo;ll go through with my part.
  ... Tell him&mdash;when he comes to&mdash;that if he can play
  square&mdash;there&rsquo;s a place on the Diamond for him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then Jim parted the crowd and disappeared. Molly slipped back up on the
  porch into the store, and never even thinking of her mother, she hurried
  through to the other corner store and went out the side entrance. Sobbing,
  and in a terrible condition of mind, she ran home.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">IT DID not help much for Molly to be home, safely hidden in
  her loft, except that presently she could breathe freely and would not be
  seen. Her world of the Cibeque had come to an end. She had been publicly
  championed, in a royal way that left no peg for the poison-mongers of West
  Fork to hang calumny upon. Jim Traft had beaten her brother half to death. He
  had proclaimed his love in the street, for those who ran to hear. He had
  blazoned abroad the incredible fact that twice Molly Dunn had refused to
  marry him and that he meant to ask her again. He had called Slinger Dunn all
  the dastardly names he could lay his tongue to, had banged and pounded and
  kicked him to insensibility, and then he had told the crowd Slinger could
  have a place on the Diamond, if he were man enough to take it.</p>

  <p>Not one of the romances Jim had sent her in book form could reach up to
  the heights of this true happening in West Fork. How impossible to believe!
  Yet Molly knew her eyes and ears were to be trusted, if not her heart. Jim
  Traft had done a marvelous thing. It was breath-taking. He had a noble spirit
  that might not be wholly realized in the valley, but his ability to whip the
  wildcat of the Cibeque and then offer him a job on the greatest outfit of the
  range, would be appreciated. That kind of language was understood down in the
  brakes.</p>

  <p>Molly began to divine that Jim was invincible. He had brought brains and
  brawn with him, and the West had taken stock of it. He had given his enemies
  a hard row to hoe. Molly had spent so many hours dreaming and thinking about
  Jim that now in the light of his decisive and open stand she could understand
  him. And she summed up her reaction to it all in a tragic whisper: &ldquo;My
  land! If he comes heah I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fall at his feet!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her mother&rsquo;s return warned Molly that she was liable to have a bad
  half-hour, and she tried to fortify herself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, you up there?&rdquo; came a trenchant call.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, ma.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come down pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly started promptly, but lagged slower and slower, and she thought she
  would drop off the last steps of the ladder. Her mother stood there, arms
  akimbo, gazing at her with an entirely new and astounding expression.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you run home?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was a fight&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; it scared
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It needn&rsquo;t have&mdash;since it was in your honor.... Molly
  Dunn, did you hear what that young Traft told the crowd?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, ma. I was there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s the truth? He <i>did</i> ask you to marry
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly nodded mournfully. Presently she would be treated to a terrible
  harangue, and she had already stood enough for one day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over town. Crowds on the corners talking. I was told
  by ten or a dozen people. But I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. You&rsquo;re sure
  it&rsquo;s no trick? I ran everywhere, hunting you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mother, it&rsquo;s the bitter truth,&rdquo; said Molly,
  steadily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bitter! Are you crazy, girl? ... It tastes pretty sweet to me... .
  Did you say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to young Traft?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re in love with him. That&rsquo;s what has ailed you
  ever since you went to Flag. Anybody could see you were lovesick.
  Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ma, I&rsquo;m shore sick aboot somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied
  Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, then, why didn&rsquo;t you accept
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m Molly Dunn of the Cibeque.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then indeed the storm broke over Molly, though it was so vastly different
  from what she had anticipated that instead of casting her down it began to do
  the opposite. In fact her mother presented a most interesting and amusing
  study, after the first tirade about Molly&rsquo;s lack of family pride. Molly
  learned that she was a granddaughter of Rose Hillyard of Virginia, and had
  bluer blood than any Traft who ever lived.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I always try to keep these West Fork louts away from
  you?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Dunn, in protest at the outrageous way she had been
  foiled. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I bring you up different? You always were
  somebody, Molly Dunn. And that&rsquo;s where your father and me split. Now
  it&rsquo;s proved. You&rsquo;re courted by a fine young chap. He must be
  <i>mad</i> about you&mdash;to tell it in the street. They said his being a
  tenderfoot didn&rsquo;t make him any the less a fighter from way back.... He
  damn near killed your brother, and folks weren&rsquo;t backward about saying
  that&rsquo;d have been a good thing.... Molly, this young fellow will go far
  out here in the West. He&rsquo;s got stuff in him. He&rsquo;s nephew to old
  Jim Traft, they tell me, who owns ranches all over, and eighty thousand head
  of stock.... You can&rsquo;t refuse to marry him. Why, it&rsquo;ll be our
  salvation!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly had to listen and she dared not voice her protest. Moreover she was
  as much amazed as her mother was indignant. She could not understand this
  sudden right about face in regard to her admirers. Temporary relief, however,
  came with an interruption in shape of the arrival of several young men,
  bringing Slinger home.</p>

  <p>For once her mother&rsquo;s tongue stopped its wagging. Arch Dunn was a
  spectacle to behold. He could walk, but that was about all, and he rewarded
  the kindly offices of those who had escorted him by driving them off. Both
  Mrs. Dunn and Molly stood back, afraid to approach or speak, and almost
  afraid to look. Slinger dragged himself around to the back porch, where he
  sagged to his bed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch&mdash;can I do anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo; faltered Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon, since I cain&rsquo;t do for myself,&rdquo; was the
  surprising answer.</p>

  <p>Molly hastened to get a pan of water, soap and bandages and salve, and
  hurried to his side. She divined that by this incident she would either gain
  or lose a brother. She unbuckled the long spurs, shuddering at the
  blood-stains on one of them. Arch had got what he deserved. The imprint of
  hobnails on his face appeared to be a brand. He had been treated to a dose of
  his own medicine. But the fatal issue might be now that he would kill Jim
  Traft. Molly prayed and hoped. Could not the same thing, almost, that had
  happened to her, happen to Arch? She pulled off his boots, and then his wet
  and torn shirt. The mixture of blood, sweat, and dirt actually made it
  heavy.</p>

  <p>It was not pleasant to look into her brother&rsquo;s visage. Yet pity and
  tenderness came to her aid.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Much obliged, Molly,&rdquo; he said, when she had finished what
  little she could do. &ldquo;Was you in town when the cyclone hit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Arch. I&mdash;I saw it,&rdquo; she replied, thrilled that he
  would talk to her in such wise. She prayed for something to make the moment
  helpful for this wayward brother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see him lick me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She murmured an affirmative.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd! who&rsquo;d ever thunk it? A Missourie
  tenderfoot!&mdash;But, Molly, he had it on me. I never was so hurted in all
  my fights. He must have binged my nose a thousand times. I could have
  bellared out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, you must have&mdash;have hurt him very much, too,&rdquo; said
  Molly. &ldquo;He was all bloody.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. I reckon so. I&rsquo;d have cut him to pieces&mdash;I was
  thet mad.... Molly, I got too mad. An&rsquo; at thet he hurt me wuss with his
  sharp tongue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d not have been so&mdash;so bad if you hadn&rsquo;t tried
  to &lsquo;rooster&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, all&rsquo;s fair in thet kind of a fight. I don&rsquo;t care
  aboot thet any more&rsquo;n I care aboot his lickin&rsquo; me. He&rsquo;s
  simply a better man. I told them so.... But I reckon there&rsquo;s another
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, you&mdash;you&rsquo;ll meet Jim&mdash;force him to
  draw?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;d be natural-like, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;From the stand of the Cibeque, yes. But there&rsquo;s a bigger way
  to meet it. If you forced him to draw, you&rsquo;d kill him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Huh! I&rsquo;m not so damn shore of thet. Mister Jim Traft is a
  surprisin&rsquo; hombre.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arch, I shan&rsquo;t beg you again,&rdquo; went on Molly,
  eloquently, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll <i>pray</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pray? What fer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For you to see clear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;n hell can I see anyway with both eyes shet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Brother, I mean see with your spirit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, you talk like thet parson who was shot heah onct.... Molly, did
  Traft want to marry you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Solemnly Molly nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t see very well. Talk. Honest now&mdash;did
  he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Arch&mdash;an&rsquo; that justified my faith in
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon a fellar could do no more.... An&rsquo; you wouldn&rsquo;t
  take him up &rsquo;cause you was Slinger Dunn&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was one reason,&rdquo; admitted Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve a reputation that to civilized folks would look
  terrible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I&rsquo;ll gamble there&rsquo;s wuss men than me. It
  ain&rsquo;t nuthin&rsquo; to pack a gun an&rsquo; use it when you&rsquo;re
  crowded.... Now thet day up the canyon. I shore gave young Traft a long time
  to shoot. An&rsquo; he had a rifle in his hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong aboot it, Arch. He wouldn&rsquo;t
  want to kill you in the first place&mdash;an&rsquo; second, when you met him
  he&rsquo;d forget he had a gun. Or be scared.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Scared! Thet hombre? He was orful scared of me today! Nope,
  it&rsquo;s jest gun-slingin&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t brought up with
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be plain murder.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll let him off&mdash;providin&rsquo; you agree to
  marry him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Arch!</i>&rdquo; whispered Molly, at once rapt and stricken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only deal you can make with me, an&rsquo; you bet it&rsquo;s a hard
  one to swaller.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly knew Slinger Dunn and that she must grasp at straws.
  &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;take-you-up, Arch,&rdquo; she said, in a
  strangled voice. &ldquo;If he&mdash;asks me&mdash;any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry none, sister. Thet hombre will be heah today.
  An&rsquo; you can make him ask you again. Reckon, though, he&rsquo;ll wait
  till dark&mdash;not wantin&rsquo; you to see his mug. I shore bunged him
  up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly trembled on the brink of the precipice to which she had been driven.
  She dared not look over. She must leap with closed eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;rooster him bad?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. Only scratched him. But I was shore leggin&rsquo; it fer him
  when he ducked an&rsquo; grabbed me.... Fetch me a drink. I&rsquo;m shore
  parchin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently Molly stole away to her nest under the roof, thankful to let
  well enough alone, so far as Slinger was concerned. To secure his promise not
  to kill Jim was more than she had hoped for, at any cost. And that cost! What
  a terrible thing to take upon herself! If Jim did not ask her again and soon,
  he would not live very long. Slinger kept his promises. Molly felt that she
  would die for Jim and it was not so very much worse to have to marry him. The
  prospect dazzled and terrified her. If Jim would live in a log cabin and let
  her work for him! That would be heaven. But he would want to take her away
  from the Cibeque&mdash;from the woods! from Maple Spring! and wear stockings
  and live in the mansion of a ranch-house at Flagerstown, and meet his rich
  old uncle&mdash;his other relatives&mdash;and his mother. Molly was overcome
  at the thought. She could not do it. But to save his life she would do
  anything. She sank on her bed with a sensation as if her breast was caved in.
  And there she lay, like a wounded deer, for hours, and never could have
  accounted for them.</p>

  <p>She crawled down to help get supper and she took some to Arch, who could
  not eat, and she sat at table more to avoid clash with her mother than to
  satisfy hunger.</p>

  <p>In the dusk she wandered along outside the lane, irresistibly drawn. Her
  mother and brother were fools. Jim would not come. She longed for him, yet
  prayed he would stay away.</p>

  <p>The bats were whirling in the clear cool air overhead. The Diamond stood
  up black and bold, somehow strengthening her. All her life she had looked up
  to that mighty bulk. The smell of burning pine floated from the dark forest.
  A night-hawk flitted by with sharp note.</p>

  <p>Then a whistle electrified Molly. She had been whistled for many times in
  this gloaming hour. It was one of the courting tricks of the Cibeque. But
  never before had a whistle sent a blade into her heart or lent her wings. Her
  moccasined feet pattered on the hard-packed ground.</p>

  <p>She saw a dark form at the gate, leaning on the bars. She ran on.
  Yes&mdash;Jim! ... Then somehow she was sitting on the top bar&mdash;one hand
  at her bursting breast and the other, which was her left, in Jim&rsquo;s
  grasp. He spoke, but she did not distinguish what he said, and she could not
  reply. She felt his rough strong hands. He was slipping something on her
  finger. A ring!</p>

  <p>Then from the gloom behind rasped a low hard voice: &ldquo;<i>Hands up,
  Traft!</i>&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dark forms appeared out of the brush, almost without rustle. One man
  shoved a gun against Jim&rsquo;s back. Seth Haverly! Up went Jim&rsquo;s
  hands. Molly recognized Sam Haverly. The third man came close&mdash;laid a
  powerful hand on her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you yap we&rsquo;ll kill him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly would have fallen but for his hold. It was Hackamore Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Turn round, Traft, an&rsquo; march,&rdquo; ordered Seth
  Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? A hold-up?&rdquo; queried Jim, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep still&mdash;or it&rsquo;ll be wuss!&rdquo; hissed Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fellars, I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; the gurl along,&rdquo; announced
  Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>Haverly made a fierce gesture, which included his gun. &ldquo;You air like
  hell! I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you agin, Jocelyn, thet I&rsquo;m runnin&rsquo;
  this outfit. Stay heah an&rsquo; keep her quiet till we git away with the
  hosses.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Seth, I want the gurl,&rdquo; replied Jocelyn, low and
  doggedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll divvy my share of Traft&rsquo;s ransom with
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash; you, Jocelyn!&rdquo; cursed Haverly.
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have hell enough without that. Do you want Slinger Dunn on
  your trail? ... Stay heah an&rsquo; hug the gurl who hasn&rsquo;t no use fer
  you, if you&rsquo;re that much of a sucker. But foller us pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Haverlys then forced Jim ahead of them, vanishing in the gloom of the
  lane. Molly heard the whinny of a horse at a distance. She seemed paralyzed.
  Hack Jocelyn loomed over her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; you willin&rsquo; or by force,&rdquo;
  he whispered, bending down to peer at her. &ldquo;An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
  fergit&mdash;if you make even a peep they&rsquo;ll shoot Traft.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where they goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; gasped Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up back on the Diamond. Thet wasn&rsquo;t my idee. They don&rsquo;t
  know Curly Prentiss. But they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to hide Traft an&rsquo;
  hold him fer ransom. But when they git the money they&rsquo;ll kill him. Hang
  him on the drift fence!&mdash;- Thet&rsquo;s the plan. An&rsquo; the only
  chanct of savin&rsquo; his life is fer you to go with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll that&mdash;save Jim?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it. I&rsquo;ll stick out fer lettin&rsquo; him go.
  An&rsquo; if it comes to a pinch I&rsquo;ll force them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You swear to Gawd!&rdquo; demanded Molly, in fierce passion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. I swear to Gawd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger will kill you. I cain&rsquo;t answer fer him. It
  won&rsquo;t be long till he&rsquo;s on my trail. I&rsquo;m warnin&rsquo; you,
  Hack Jocelyn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heah you,&rdquo; he replied, grimly. &ldquo;Reckon Slinger
  is&mdash;or would be&mdash;a stumper. But he&rsquo;s crippled, an&rsquo;
  before he&rsquo;s out ag&rsquo;in, it&rsquo;ll all be over.... I&rsquo;ll hev
  my stake an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll ride out of the country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You an&rsquo; me?&rdquo; she queried, marveling at the man&rsquo;s
  egotism and stupidity.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You an&rsquo; me, Molly Dunn. Shore it&rsquo;s been long in my
  mind.... Now, will I hev to hawg-tie you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go willin&rsquo;. But keep your hands off me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He led her down the darkening lane, out of the clearing into the
  forest.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Jim Traft heard that rasping command to throw up his
  hands, and felt the hard prod of a gun against his back, he came down to
  earth with a sickening thud.</p>

  <p>Behind Molly he saw a dark form rise and loom. He recognized it. Hack
  Jocelyn! With a muttered curse at his heedless disregard of Andy
  Stoneham&rsquo;s warning he lifted his hands above his head. Then another
  dark form clinked into sight. He was ordered to face round. A swift glance
  was the last he had of Molly. Jocelyn&rsquo;s looming over her further added
  to his dismay.</p>

  <p>The men had their short and disgruntled argument, then Jim was forced down
  the lane. Jocelyn&rsquo;s staying behind to &ldquo;hug&rdquo; Molly, as
  Haverly so vulgarly put it, made the heat dance back into Jim&rsquo;s veins.
  He turned once to call out to Molly, but a hiss and a move from Haverly
  dissuaded him. He could scarcely help her, and after a moment&rsquo;s
  reflection he saw the fallacy of Jocelyn&rsquo;s kidnapping her, too, and he
  had faith in Molly&rsquo;s wit and nerve. It galled him horribly to leave her
  there, to be subjected to rudeness, perhaps insult. And the uncertainty of
  the situation would grow on him until Jocelyn joined them again.</p>

  <p>At the point where the lane entered the road to town three other men
  waited with horses. Jim was amazed to make out his own horse, saddled and
  bridled. These kidnappers evidently were thorough and bold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your game, Haverly?&rdquo; queried Jim, breaking into
  a whispered colloquy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re holdin&rsquo; you fer ransom,&rdquo; came the gruff
  reply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take you to a hidin&rsquo;-place an&rsquo; send a
  rider in to Flag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll recommend my uncle&rsquo;s paying it, provided you
  agree to two things.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That the ransom isn&rsquo;t made out of all reason&mdash;and that
  Hack Jocelyn doesn&rsquo;t share in it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Haverly let out a grunt which might have meant anything. Jim conceived an
  idea, which he proceeded to put into execution at once.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This man Jocelyn is no good,&rdquo; went on Jim. &ldquo;He had
  friends on the Diamond and he double-crossed them. He&rsquo;s not a straight
  shooter. He plays both ends against the middle. You fellows are a lot of
  suckers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sam&mdash;you heah thet?&rdquo; sharply ejaculated Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hell! I ain&rsquo;t deaf,&rdquo; replied one of the uneasy
  listeners.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn is using you Cibeque fellows to his own end and you can bet
  on it,&rdquo; concluded Jim, thinking this entering wedge enough for the
  moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seth, I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; leary myself,&rdquo; replied Sam
  Haverly. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sorry I plugged Jocelyn&rsquo;s game.
  When he killed Andy Stoneham tonight, right in the road, I shore throwed a
  fit. Nobody but Boyd an&rsquo; Hart an&rsquo; me seen it done. But you can
  gamble West Fork will lay thet on to us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Killed Andy Stoneham!&rdquo; ejaculated Seth, leaning forward.
  &ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jest now, almost. You ought to have heahed the shot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll be &mdash;&mdash;! What on earth fer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn swore Stoneham was spyin&rsquo; on him an&rsquo;
  givin&rsquo; us away to Molly Dunn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Jealous of poor Andy!&mdash;Gawd! but thet fellar is crazy
  aboot Molly Dunn.... We better not wait fer him. Tie his hoss, Boyd,
  an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll hit the trail.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim was told to climb into his saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hart, you lead his hoss. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll foller behind
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They started off at a trot and soon turned off the road into a trail. It
  was dark and overgrown with branches of trees that had to be dodged or
  brushed aside. Jim knew that he had not ridden down to West Fork by that
  trail. He settled himself for what he anticipated a long night ride and his
  thoughts were gloomy. He had been shocked to hear that Andy Stoneham had been
  shot by Jocelyn. Not an hour after Andy had warned Jim to keep indoors! But
  Jim had disregarded this advice, to his bitter regret. If only Jocelyn would
  catch up with them! His distrust of this cowboy had been more than justified.
  Jim realized now that Molly would be in peril. Jocelyn had insisted on
  kidnapping her, too. The chances were he would do it. Then, when he brought
  her along with him, there would be precipitated a complex situation. It might
  well be that Jocelyn in his passion had bitten off more than he could
  chew.</p>

  <p>Jim grew darkly active in thought. He contended with the problem that
  presupposed Jocelyn was following with Molly. And while he cudgled his brains
  he rode on into the denser forest. His captors were silent, and kept to a
  trot on level ground, and a walk over rough places and upgrades. The moon
  arose and sent a shadowed blanching into the forest. They rode down into a
  gully, where water ran over rocks, and the unshod horses slipped and
  splashed. It was weird and wonderful under the great pines, that moaned
  fitfully above. They climbed out of the gully to zigzag up a steep trail,
  soft and full of rocks. And after one of the halts to let the horses rest Jim
  made certain they were climbing the Diamond. The nerve of these Cibeque
  riders! Jim knew the Diamond was a big country, exceedingly wild and rough on
  the high west slope, but he would have staked a good deal on Curly Prentiss
  trailing them to their lair. Curly&rsquo;s reputation as to tracker would
  have to be sustained. How the outfit would drive him! As to that, they would
  each and every one ride out on the man-hurt. This aspect of the situation was
  thrilling, but Jim felt qualms at the possible outcome. He had come to know
  his men now.</p>

  <p>The moon went down; the sky grew dark blue and star-fired. Jim&rsquo;s
  captors climbed out on top of the rim, and when Jim looked down into that
  black abyss he caught his breath. They rode on into the forest, toward the
  east, and after a long ride they headed a thick-timbered canyon, and turned
  west again. They climbed a ridge and kept to its summit for what seemed hours
  to the wearying Jim, and at last they cut down into wild dense forest. In the
  gray of dawn they rode up again, into open grassy parks where no hoof-tracks
  would show, down again and up once more, to descend a pine-and
  spruce-timbered slope, to enter at daylight a beautiful white-grassed park,
  fringed by forest.</p>

  <p>Jim saw a shaggy gray log cabin in the edge of the pines. A flock of wild
  turkeys, all gobblers, stately and bronze-flecked, walked across the open.
  Far down the valley-like park, near a willow-bordered stream that wound
  through, stood deer motionless, with heads and long ears up.</p>

  <p>Smoke issued from the rude outside stone chimney of the cabin. Then a man
  appeared, rifle in hand. Haverly let out a shrill whistle. Another man
  appeared, and he shouted in hoarse welcome.</p>

  <p>The cabin was very old, built of peeled pine logs and split shingles,
  which in places had rotted through. The front of the roof had an overhang of
  ten feet or more, with one post at each corner. That end of the cabin was
  open and there were no windows or doors. The fire was inside. Saddles and
  pack outfits were stacked under this projecting shed-like roof.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we&rsquo;re heah,&rdquo; announced Seth Haverly to Jim, as
  they came to a halt at the cabin. &ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t say that you squealed
  a hell of a lot on the way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was a thin, wiry young man, blond, with hazel eyes, clear as light and
  which certainly did not have any shifty quality. His beard was like fine
  amber moss.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Haverly, I&rsquo;m not a squealer,&rdquo; replied Jim.
  &ldquo;And I could be worse off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore you could,&rdquo; said the other, after a moment of surprise.
  &ldquo;I reckon Jocelyn had you figgered wrong or he lied like a
  streak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What notion of me did he give you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you was a dude tenderfoot, afeered of your shadder. Swore he
  licked stuffin&rsquo;s out of you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim laughed. &ldquo;Am I to get down?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. Pile off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was Jocelyn in West Fork yesterday when I had a little set-to with
  Dunn?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. But I was an&rsquo; I seen your little set-to.... Might I
  ask, Mister Traft, what you&rsquo;d call a big set-to?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;ll be a pretty fair one when Curly Prentiss and
  the Diamond hole you fellows here,&rdquo; responded Jim, cheerfully.
  &ldquo;And a real one when Slinger Dunn meets Hack Jocelyn. I wouldn&rsquo;t
  be in Jocelyn&rsquo;s boots for a million.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Huh!&mdash;Wal, I kinda like you, Jim Traft, an&rsquo; I reckon I
  did thet fust day at Limestone, when I rid into your camp with Slinger. Do
  you recollect?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember you, and that you seemed to have some
  sense.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I used to. But I&rsquo;m damned if I don&rsquo;t think it left
  me when I fell out with Slinger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the horses were unsaddled, hobbled, and turned loose. And Jim
  had a chance to look over the men. They were all young and they looked the
  part they were playing. Jim did not, however, conceive a very unfavorable
  impression. They were a group of cowboys misled&mdash;gone wrong; and that
  appeared to be a common enough thing in Arizona during the last of the
  &rsquo;eighties.</p>

  <p>Sam Haverly was also blond, almost red of hair and complexion, more sturdy
  than his brother, less lean of face and intelligent of eye. Hart Merriwell
  could not have been picked out of a group of cowboys for any distinct
  individuality. Boyd Flick was dark, small, and as he hobbled around in his
  enormous chaps Jim thought that he could never have stopped a pig in a lane.
  Jim had yet to hear the names of the two members of Haverly&rsquo;s outfit
  that had been keeping camp here in the park. They certainly struck him
  forcibly, and the bigger one, a brawny fellow for a rider, had very pale eyes
  and hair like tow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s our new boss?&rdquo; he inquired, after greeting Seth,
  and his tone did not lack sarcasm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Matty, you can cut thet talk,&rdquo; replied Haverly. &ldquo;Or
  I&rsquo;m gonna get sore.... Jocelyn stayed behind.&rdquo; And in succinct
  words he gave his questioner a few details of what had detained him. And
  these elicited a short terse comment, mostly profane.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re hungry come an&rsquo; git it before I throw it
  out,&rdquo; called the other fellow, from the cabin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make yourself to home,&rdquo; said Haverly to Jim, leading him
  in.</p>

  <p>Whereupon these backwoods riders, precisely after the manner of cowboys,
  ate their breakfast standing or sitting or squatting, and one of them knelt
  with his. Jim very soon could have recommended the cook, and he made a hearty
  meal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What am I supposed to do now?&rdquo; he asked, genially.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you shore wouldn&rsquo;t expect me to sing fer your
  amoosement,&rdquo; replied Seth, dryly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m feeling pretty good now, considering, and I
  don&rsquo;t want to take risks,&rdquo; returned Jim, just as dryly.</p>

  <p>This retort went home, for remarks were forthcoming anent Seth&rsquo;s
  opinion of his vocal powers. The men looked frankly at Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Traft, do I hawg-tie you or not?&rdquo; queried Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t read your mind. As a matter of fact,
  Haverly, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ve got much gray matter. Or
  you&rsquo;d never have let Jocelyn persuade you into this deal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Haverly took that retort gravely, as well as corroborative ones from Matty
  and the cook.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll give your word not to make a break I won&rsquo;t
  tie you up,&rdquo; went on Haverly to Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Man, I can&rsquo;t promise that. Would you?&rdquo; protested
  Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ve done it, an&rsquo; lied like hell.... Mister Jim,
  you peer to be a straight-talkin&rsquo; fellar. Reckon we&rsquo;ll jest cut
  this idee of you bein&rsquo; a tenderfoot.... You can set around heah in
  comfort. But if you run we&rsquo;ll wing you. Thet&rsquo;s my order. Do you
  savvy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure. And much obliged. Molly was right when she said you were a
  pretty decent fellow. It was only bad company that was making an outlaw of
  you. She was glad Slinger quit your outfit,&rdquo; replied Jim, departing
  somewhat from literal veracity. But he had a deep game to play and he knew he
  could work hard in this simple, primitive mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, so Molly said thet!&rdquo; he ejaculated, with a queer look on
  his face. And he fell into a profound reverie.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hyar we air,&rdquo; announced Matty, spreading his hands.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; thet Jocelyn not in the outfit. Air we goin&rsquo; to wait
  around, riskin&rsquo; our necks, while he sparks a gurl?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sparks nuthin&rsquo;. He&rsquo;ll have to hawg-tie Molly Dunn, if
  he wants her near him,&rdquo; replied Seth, snorting.</p>

  <p>Jim imagined he saw an opening. &ldquo;Say, didn&rsquo;t you see Jocelyn
  grab Molly last night? If he hadn&rsquo;t she&rsquo;d have run.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I seen him. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll bet you-all a hundred thet he
  packs her up heah,&rdquo; replied Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, the man&rsquo;d be out of his haid,&rdquo; said Matty.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough to kidnap this heah Traft boy fer money. But to
  haul a Cibeque gurl up heah&mdash;for doubtful reasons!&mdash;Seth, this
  Jocelyn ain&rsquo;t no Cibeque fellar nohow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Matty, you&rsquo;d needn&rsquo;t rag me,&rdquo; rejoined Seth,
  sullenly. &ldquo;I cussed him fierce last night. An&rsquo; I said
  &lsquo;No!&rsquo; If he fetches her &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;;
  it&rsquo;ll be the wuss fer him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;d be wuss fer us, don&rsquo;t you fergit
  thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sam Haverly spoke up, &ldquo;Matty, you ain&rsquo;t heerd aboot Jocelyn
  shootin&rsquo; Andy Stoneham last night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Andy! Fer Heaven&rsquo;s sake, thet good-natured clerk of
  Enoch&rsquo;s!&rdquo; exclaimed Matty, aghast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hack swore Andy was informin&rsquo; ag&rsquo;in&rsquo;
  us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They all looked puzzled, and Seth Haverly shook his blond head broodingly.
  The expression of thoughts, opinions, criticisms, animosities, by these
  woodsmen seemed equivalent to the amassing of evidence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; broke in Jim, &ldquo;Hack Jocelyn is too deep for
  you. He had the Diamond standing on its head. Even after I saw through him I
  had a job convincing some of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you give us a hunch aboot this deal,&rdquo; suggested
  Seth Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; declared Jim, &ldquo;provided you agree to what I
  asked.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seth turned to Matty, who evidently was an important member of the outfit.
  &ldquo;Traft says he&rsquo;ll advise his uncle to pay a ransom,
  providin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s not out of all reason, an&rsquo; thet Jocelyn
  don&rsquo;t git no share.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Strikes me hard,&rdquo; said Matty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn will raise hell. He wanted to name the amount of ransom
  an&rsquo; write the letter to old Traft. But he&rsquo;s not heah an&rsquo;
  we&rsquo;ve shore no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim had a wild idea. &ldquo;Haverly, would you trust <i>me</i> to get the
  ransom for you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That rendered the eager group speechless. Before Haverly regained his
  voice the cook, who had gone outside to empty a pan, whistled low and sharp.
  They all jumped, and it certainly startled Jim. Then Seth strode out, to be
  followed by the others.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn comin&rsquo; down out of the woods&mdash;ridin&rsquo;
  double,&rdquo; said the cook, pointing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fletch, if you ain&rsquo;t correct!&rdquo; ejaculated Matty. To
  this Seth Haverly added a volley of curses.</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s eyes roved and strained, at last to espy a horse coming under
  the pines carrying double. He stood stock-still, suddenly galvanized. How
  slowly the tired horse descended the slope! It was some moments before Jim
  made out Molly clearly. She was riding astride, behind Jocelyn&rsquo;s
  saddle, and appeared to sit there easily. Her dark head grew
  distinct&mdash;then her face&mdash;then her eyes. Jim wondered how he would
  ever have the courage to look into them. A long night ride through the wild
  forest with that vicious cowboy!</p>

  <p>Jocelyn had a gray corded face&mdash;eyes like gimlets. He threw the
  bridle and, hands on hips, regarded the silent group.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Missed the trail an&rsquo; was lost till daylight,&rdquo; he
  explained.</p>

  <p>Seth Haverly took a step out in front of his comrades. He was slow,
  guarded, but not afraid.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So, Jocelyn, you kidnapped Molly?&rdquo; he queried, harshly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. She come willin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She come willin&rsquo;. Ask her yourself,&rdquo; returned Jocelyn,
  coolly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, is he tellin&rsquo; me straight? Did you come up heah of
  your own accord?&rdquo; demanded Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, Seth,&rdquo; replied Molly, calmly.</p>

  <p>Haverly stepped closer and peered up into Molly&rsquo;s face, as if to
  read not only confirmation of Molly&rsquo;s admission but of suspicions of
  his own. Again he made that striking gesture with his hand, and turning to
  Jim, baffled, eyes afire, he said, &ldquo;Traft, will you take a look at
  Molly an&rsquo; tell me if she&rsquo;s drunk, crazy
  or&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not finish. There seemed to be eloquent manifestations about him
  that he had loved Molly Dunn.</p>

  <p>Jim dragged himself forward to obey, and there might have been a chain
  with iron balls attached to his legs. Yet something sustained him despite the
  icy clutch at his heart.</p>

  <p>Molly&rsquo;s face was wan. The big dark eyes gazed straight down into
  Jim&rsquo;s. He read in them love, hope, meaning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mawnin&rsquo;, Jim!&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Molly! How&mdash;are you?&rdquo; he managed to get
  out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All&mdash;right?&rdquo; he echoed. But he took little stock of her
  words. Jocelyn had acquired some control over her, probably lying to her
  about his authority in this kidnapping deal. Jim&rsquo;s whole inner being
  seemed to collapse with his sudden relief. Her eyes told him all he wanted to
  know.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. Only awful sleepy, hungry, an&rsquo; sore,&rdquo; she
  answered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you come with Jocelyn willingly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon so, Jim. But I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of choice,&rdquo;
  drawled Molly, and from behind Jocelyn&rsquo;s shoulder she gave him a deep
  warning look that certainly could not have been lost by the others.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn laughed sardonically. &ldquo;My word goes a hell of a long way in
  this heah outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You fetched her ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; my order,&rdquo; declared Seth
  Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. But I tell you she <i>would</i> come,&rdquo; snarled
  Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell that to the chipmunks,&rdquo; retorted Seth, contemptuously,
  and turning to Molly: &ldquo;Get down, gurl. You shore look fagged. Fletch
  will fix you somethin&rsquo; to eat. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll make a bed for
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He picked up an ax and strode off toward a clump of spruce. Molly slid
  down, and limping to a seat under the extension she asked for a drink of
  water. Matty hastened to get a dipperful from a bucket and proffered it, not
  without kindliness. Here was a girl of the Cibeque&mdash;their own
  kind&mdash;placed in a queer predicament by a comparative stranger.</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s gaze had followed Molly devouringly. Happening then to shift
  it to Jocelyn, he was struck by that worthy&rsquo;s deep-set eyes, smoldering
  fire. Jim read intuitively that his very life was in peril, right at the
  moment. There did not appear to be any reason why Jocelyn could not and would
  not shoot him, as he had Andy Stoneham. It stilled Jim&rsquo;s emotion.
  Sitting down, back to a log, he studied the ground and tried to catch at
  whirling thoughts. And the first one he got hold of was that Molly&rsquo;s
  strength and composure were due to sacrifice. She was in possession of facts
  unknown to him or Haverly&rsquo;s outfit. Jim believed he could unravel the
  plot presently.</p>

  <p>Seth returned carrying a huge bundle of spruce boughs, which he carried
  into the back of the cabin, where a stall-like partition hid a corner.
  Evidently behind this he made a bed, for he came out to get a blanket. After
  which task he reappeared, to approach Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can sleep back there an&rsquo; be out of the way,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>Finally Jocelyn dismounted, and uncinching the wet horse he threw saddle
  and blankets, unbuckled the bridle, and let him go.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo;
  then we&rsquo;ll talk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went in to the fireplace and sat on a box, where he could not see
  Molly. And when he bent ravenously to his meal Jim ventured to look at her.
  Deliberately she held up her left hand, and slipping the ring round to the
  back of her finger, where the big diamond caught the sunlight, she gave Jim a
  smile that seemed reward for all his agony. Yet, on second thought, there
  seemed, beside love and loyalty, a sadness that might be renunciation.</p>

  <p>Seth Haverly saw Molly&rsquo;s look, also the ring, and if he did not put
  two and two together Jim missed his guess. Moreover, Seth did not react
  sullenly to this revelation.</p>

  <p>Presently Molly had satisfied her hunger and thirst, and she repaired out
  of sight behind or in the stall at the back of the cabin. Jocelyn, about
  finished with his meal, watched her go, and there seemed that of a lean wolf
  in his gaze. A moment later he got up, and giving his belt a hitch he stalked
  out under the overhang of the roof, a strong figure, sure of himself and his
  resourcefulness. Among these men, anyway, he had no superior, and knew
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind, Seth?&rdquo; he queried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore there&rsquo;s aplenty, Jocelyn, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re part
  of it,&rdquo; replied Haverly, gruffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Mister Traft&rsquo;s been talkin&rsquo; to you. The man who
  gets your ear last has you on his side.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, if I&rsquo;m not loco you stuffed both my ears prutty
  full.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come away from these crawfish of yours, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll
  settle this deal pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope, not no more. Sam an&rsquo; the rest of my outfit air
  goin&rsquo; to heah every word I say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jocelyn rolled and lighted a cigarette. It struck Jim that he was prepared
  for most anything, and had little respect for the minds and abilities of
  these Cibeque riders. He leaned against the log post of the cabin and smoked,
  his hard eyes studying every one of them, and not missing Jim. Something Ring
  Locke had said to Jim seemed to be justified here. Jocelyn was one of the
  breed of far-riding cowboys, outlawed from many ranges, perhaps, and a
  dangerous man. He looked it now.</p>

  <p>Seth Haverly, after a pause, went on speaking: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sore aboot
  your shootin&rsquo; Andy Stoneham.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s none of your bizness,&rdquo; snapped Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But it is. You&rsquo;re in my outfit now. We&rsquo;ll all be held
  part responsible for thet. I reckon it don&rsquo;t make a hell of a lot of
  difference&mdash;if we get away with this ransom deal. But your
  stealin&rsquo; Molly Dunn from her home&mdash;thet&rsquo;ll let us
  out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haverly, I didn&rsquo;t steal her. You&rsquo;ve got ears, man. You
  heered her say she came willin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That nettled Jocelyn. He had lost grip here. &ldquo;Haverly, you&rsquo;ve
  no call to worry on account of Molly. She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; away with me to
  marry me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is!&mdash;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re leavin&rsquo; us
  heah?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s your affair. I told you it&rsquo;d be a good idea to
  light out fer another range or hole up till the thing blowed over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Haverly got up, red in the face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of my mix, if Molly means to marry you. But it
  looks damn queer to me. I <i>know</i> thet gurl. She wouldn&rsquo;t
  double-cross a Cibeque dog.... You&rsquo;re playin&rsquo; a prutty high hand,
  Jocelyn, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m admittin&rsquo; you&rsquo;re too smart fer this
  outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. But it ain&rsquo;t so much of a compliment.... You&rsquo;ve
  no kick comin&rsquo;, if you get your stake out of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t of had. But your murderin&rsquo; Stoneham
  an&rsquo; runnin&rsquo; off with Molly&mdash;thet puts a bad complexion on
  the whole deal. I&rsquo;ve a mind to back out of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will like hell!&rdquo; asserted Jocelyn. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go
  through on this deal or you&rsquo;ll have me to square up with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The scarcely veiled threat had its solid effect upon Haverly. A break was
  imminent between them&mdash;a fact Jocelyn probably saw, but it would not
  come at once or openly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, we ain&rsquo;t got a lot of time to palaver,&rdquo; said Seth.
  &ldquo;Curly Prentiss is on Traft&rsquo;s trail, you can bet. The West
  Forkers air goin&rsquo; to give him a hunch. An&rsquo; wurst, Slinger Dunn
  has got to be considered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunn was beat so bad thet he&rsquo;ll be layin&rsquo; up fer a
  week. Mister Traft played into our hands there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn, you cain&rsquo;t figger Slinger, an, thet&rsquo;s why
  I&rsquo;ve my doubts aboot you. Shore as Gawd made little apples Slinger Dunn
  is on your trail right this minnit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jocelyn looked up at the threatening clouds rolling from the
  southwest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll rain tonight an&rsquo; then we can&rsquo;t be
  trailed,&rdquo; he said, confidently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thet&rsquo;ll only delay Slinger. He knows every hole in these
  hills, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s shore a hound on a scent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly Jocelyn took hold of Haverly and dragged him out of earshot of
  the listeners. There in plain sight under a pine they argued, with Haverly
  growing less and less protesting. Finally they reached some kind of an
  agreement and returned to the cabin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sam, we&rsquo;ve made the best of a bad bargain,&rdquo; announced
  Seth. &ldquo;The hitch was Molly. I jest don&rsquo;t care to be around if
  Slinger happens along. Wal, Jocelyn has agreed to take the gurl an&rsquo; go
  to the haid of the draw up heah, an&rsquo; stay hid in thet trapper&rsquo;s
  cabin at Turkey Spring. A rifle-shot will warn him to rustle.... As fer the
  deal&mdash;we&rsquo;ll send Boyd to Flag pronto with the letter to old Traft.
  Boyd&rsquo;s got the fastest hoss, an&rsquo; allowin&rsquo; half a day to get
  the money he can make it in lessen two days. What you say?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; said Sam, laconically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it ain&rsquo;t so slick,&rdquo; added Matty. &ldquo;Tomorrer
  is Sunday an&rsquo; no bank is open. Suppose Boyd don&rsquo;t find old Traft
  at home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jocelyn waved this aside as if unworthy of consideration.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the letter thet&rsquo;ll fetch results. Blodgett or any of
  Traft&rsquo;s friends would dig up ten thousand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, will they?&rdquo; queried Matty, dubiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  write the letter. It&rsquo;ll be short an&rsquo; sweet. It&rsquo;ll say if
  thet money isn&rsquo;t heah with Boyd in twenty-four hours we&rsquo;ll kill
  Jim Traft an&rsquo; hang his body over his drift fence!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">JOCELYN opened a saddle-bag, to take out a small packet,
  which he lay on the ground. Then, as if it was an after-thought, he lifted
  out a large flask which he shook with satisfaction. Placing it back, he next
  removed a bottle half full of dark-red liquor. He drank from it. And then he
  slipped that in his hip pocket.</p>

  <p>Jim shared Seth Haverly&rsquo;s surprise at this act.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it ain&rsquo;t no time fer drinkin&rsquo;, onless your
  nerve&rsquo;s pore,&rdquo; he said, caustically.</p>

  <p>The other wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bright fellar, Seth,&rdquo; rejoined Jocelyn, rising
  with the packet. &ldquo;But you ain&rsquo;t as bright as I am. My idee is to
  make Traft write this letter to his uncle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shucks! I thought of thet long ago. An&rsquo; fer thet matter, he
  offered to do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who offered?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traft heah. But he made it providin&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t ask fer
  too much ransom, an&rsquo; thet you wasn&rsquo;t to hev no share.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! The hell you say!&rdquo; returned Jocelyn, with a dark glance
  at Jim. Then he opened the packet and laid writing-paper, pen, and ink on the
  woodpile. &ldquo;Fetch a box.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One of the party procured a box from inside. &ldquo;Now, Mister Jim Traft,
  I reckon you&rsquo;ll put one of your accomplishments to good use,&rdquo;
  declared Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>As Jim rose from his seat Seth Haverly made that singular gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, in lower tone. &ldquo;Jocelyn, I&rsquo;ll
  agree aboot sendin&rsquo; fer the money. But I&rsquo;m daid set
  ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; your double-crossin&rsquo; old Traft.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Talk low, you &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
  rejoined Jocelyn, swiftly. &ldquo;She might be awake an&rsquo; heah you... .
  Git it off your chest quick.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Haverly had paled so that his thin amber beard stood out in contrast. He
  knelt on one knee and whispered, huskily, &ldquo;I weaken on two points of
  your deal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Layin&rsquo; the blame on Slinger Dunn, fer
  one&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too late. I&rsquo;ve already fixed thet in West Fork. Never mind
  your other point.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim had heard enough to divine Jocelyn&rsquo;s diabolical plot. Whether
  that ransom was paid or not, he realized Jocelyn meant to decorate the drift
  fence with his dead body, like a scarecrow hung up in a cornfield. There was
  one instant when it seemed Jim&rsquo;s whole internal machinery would fail.
  Then he rallied in desperate spirit. Right then and there he would have
  snatched a gun from one of these men, had he been close enough. He nursed the
  inspiration. If he could kill Jocelyn, that at least would save Molly. Slowly
  his muscles set to the terrible determination.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You already fixed the blame&mdash;on Slinger!&rdquo; ejaculated
  Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore did. An&rsquo; nobody but you fellars can prove <i>he</i>
  didn&rsquo;t shoot thet store clerk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn, you&rsquo;re orful smart, but you cain&rsquo;t work
  miracles,&rdquo; said Haverly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t argue. I&rsquo;ve no time to tell you how I
  put the job up on Dunn. But it&rsquo;s <i>done</i>. If he has started on our
  trail, he&rsquo;ll never be able to clear himself. Thet&rsquo;s
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gawd-Almighty!&rdquo; gasped Haverly.</p>

  <p>At this juncture Jim, whose eyes kept continually traveling back to the
  corner of the cabin, made the startling discovery that Molly was peeping
  round the corner of the stall. This added to Jim&rsquo;s uneasy sense of
  premonition and made him more restless than ever. He tried to move round
  where he could warn Molly to be careful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody tie up this fellar,&rdquo; ordered Jocelyn, who apparently
  could see in all directions at once. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s snoopin&rsquo; around.
  Reckon he&rsquo;d like to get back there with my lady love.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But nobody lifted hand or foot to comply with his order. Snatching up a
  lasso he made at Jim, and swung the loose loops viciously, cracking on
  Jim&rsquo;s hip. It was just possible for Jim to resist leaping at Jocelyn,
  who he knew would shoot him upon the slightest excuse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Turn round an&rsquo; lean ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; the post,&rdquo; he
  commanded. &ldquo;An&rsquo; put your hands behind you.&rdquo; With that he
  proceeded to bind Jim&rsquo;s hands and feet, and tied the last in intricate
  knots. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t my rope, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll have to be
  cut.&rdquo; Then he kicked Jim&rsquo;s feet from under him, letting him down.
  It so happened that Jim slid round in falling, and there he sat, back to the
  post, helpless and so devoured by wrath that he felt he was sweating
  blood.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Jocelyn drew his bottle from his hip pocket and took a
  drink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To celebrate the day, Mister Traft,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;An&rsquo; when I drink the rest of this I&rsquo;ll set the bottle on
  your head an&rsquo; treat you to some real shootin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Repairing to the box, he sat down again before the writing-materials.
  &ldquo;Hell! I was goin&rsquo; to make him write the letter, an&rsquo; now
  I&rsquo;ve tied him up.... Wal, I&rsquo;ll write it myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he did, laboring over the task like a schoolboy. Then he read it over
  with evident satisfaction.</p>

  <p>Seth Haverly held put a lean hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; to see
  what you writ.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Imperturbably Jocelyn sealed the letter. &ldquo;Reckon you couldn&rsquo;t
  read it, if I let you,&rdquo; said Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re demandin&rsquo; more&rsquo;n we agreed on,&rdquo;
  shouted Haverly, beside himself with rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shore am. Ten thousand wouldn&rsquo;t begin to do me.
  You&rsquo;re a fool, Haverly. Old Traft will <i>pay</i> to save his
  nevvy&rsquo;s precious life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll pay all in vain,&rdquo; snarled Haverly,
  white to the lips.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn gave little heed to him, and turning to Flick he presented the
  letter. &ldquo;Ride like hell, now. An&rsquo; get this in Traft&rsquo;s hands
  today, or Blodgett&rsquo;s. An&rsquo; if they ain&rsquo;t handy go to Tobin
  at the bank. Anyone of them will pile out the greenbacks. An&rsquo; you ride
  back, pronto.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t stuck on the job,&rdquo; declared Flick, brusquely,
  rising to his feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safer than waitin&rsquo; here, you can gamble....
  An&rsquo; I reckon I needn&rsquo;t tell you what I&rsquo;ll do to
  you&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Flick threw the letter in Jocelyn&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Go to hell! You
  cain&rsquo;t make me do your dirty job an&rsquo; insult me to
  boot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Seth and Matty quickly intervened, one to rescue the letter and the
  other to lead Flick aside. Between them they persuaded him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go an&rsquo; do my damndest,&rdquo; said
  Flick. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you straight, Jocelyn has busted
  the Cibeque.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With that he picked up his saddle, blanket, and bridle, and disappeared
  round the corner of the cabin. Jocelyn stood up, to tilt his bottle and drain
  the contents. He was about to fling the empty bottle aside when he remembered
  something. Stalking over to Jim, he pulled him up to an erect sitting
  posture, rapped his head hard against the post and set the bottle upon
  it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with elation, and drawing his gun he
  flipped it in the air, catching it by the handle with great dexterity.
  &ldquo;Anybody want to bet me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No one answered. Seth Haverly looked a protest he knew it would be useless
  to voice. Jocelyn had dominated the group. He had alienated them, but had
  them under his thumb. Jocelyn stepped off ten long paces and turned, his face
  singularly bright, to level the gun.</p>

  <p>Jim saw that the hammer of the Colt was up. Next instant he looked into
  the small black tube-like barrel of the quivering weapon. All faculties but
  sight seemed to be in abeyance. And that deadly little hole suddenly belched
  fire. He felt a slight jar, just before the gun boomed. Particles of
  shattered glass fell on his head and shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! How&rsquo;s thet, Seth? Shot the neck off first crack!&rdquo;
  cried the grinning devil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s damn bad, if you ask me,&rdquo; growled Haverly.
  &ldquo;Thet gun of yourn can be heerd fer miles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Jocelyn leveled it again Jim&rsquo;s consciousness seemed undamped.
  Jocelyn was aiming a little lower this time. Back of the gun gleamed the eyes
  of a cat playing with a mouse.</p>

  <p>Then came a rush and patter of moccasined feet. Molly flashed out. She
  struck up the gun so violently that it went off harmlessly in the air.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hey, gurl! You might get hurt,&rdquo; protested Jocelyn, as if he
  had been interrupted at a favorite sport.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hack Jocelyn, put away that gun,&rdquo; demanded Molly,
  furiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, little lady, you cut quite a figger in my eyes, but you
  ain&rsquo;t givin&rsquo; orders yet,&rdquo; drawled Jocelyn. But a keen
  person could have observed that here he was on uncertain ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put it away&mdash;or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll <i>you</i> do?&rdquo; interposed Jocelyn, darkly. All
  the same he lowered the gun.</p>

  <p>Seth Haverly, his brother, and their three comrades showed undisguised
  satisfaction at the turn of affairs. Seth, in fact, exhibited more. Molly
  Dunn, whatever her relation to this man or his villainy, was certainly not
  afraid of him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m liable to do anythin&rsquo;, Hack Jocelyn,&rdquo; she
  said, and she looked it.</p>

  <p>Seth stepped out unsteadily. &ldquo;Molly, you better stay back. Honest,
  gurl, Hack was only foolin&rsquo;. He ain&rsquo;t really goin&rsquo; to hurt
  Traft.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar, Seth,&rdquo; snapped Molly. &ldquo;You know
  better. An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re a lot more than a liar. Flick was right, only
  the Cibeque <i>is</i> busted. You let Jocelyn drive Slinger out an&rsquo; now
  you&rsquo;re&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shet up,&rdquo; ordered Jocelyn, sheathing his gun. &ldquo;Molly,
  you&rsquo;re damn pretty when you&rsquo;re riled, but you&rsquo;re
  goin&rsquo; too far. Shet your mouth now, or I&rsquo;ll slap it good
  an&rsquo; hard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You <i>dare</i> touch me!&rdquo; she blazed, with such passion that
  it affected even Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>Jim, loving Molly so deeply, and feeling her emotion so tremendously, had
  an intuition of a change in her that was not wholly explained by her fears
  for him. She had heard intimations not intended for her. She had realized
  Jocelyn&rsquo;s perfidy&mdash;that if murder was to be averted she would have
  to do it. This, of course, could have roused Molly&rsquo;s wild spirit to any
  extreme. Still, there seemed to be something else. Was Molly talking to gain
  time? Her suppressed air of suspense, her furtive glances, were slight
  indeed, compared with stronger expressions, yet they did not escape Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I&rsquo;ll touch you aplenty an&rsquo; pronto,&rdquo; replied
  Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>And that fetched Jim&rsquo;s gaze back to the leader in this woodland
  drama. He was in time to note Jocelyn, as he espied the ring on Molly&rsquo;s
  left hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get thet ring?&rdquo; demanded Jocelyn, suddenly
  hot. &ldquo;On your third finger! An&rsquo; a big sparkler!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None of your mix, Hack Jocelyn,&rdquo; retorted Molly, and she put
  her hands behind her back. It was then that Jim imagined he saw her look over
  Jocelyn or behind him.</p>

  <p>Jim peered across the grassy open to the wooded slope. On that side the
  pines were scattered, as by an expert landscape gardener who wanted a
  beautiful open forest. And on the instant Jim sighted the flash of a dark
  form vanishing behind a tree trunk. It resembled what he imagined an Indian
  would look like, and all his being responded in a concerted shock. Had Molly
  seen it?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You two-faced hussy!&rdquo; ejaculated Jocelyn, dark with jealous
  wrath. &ldquo;Stick out your hand.... Lemme see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly coolly brought her hand round and extended it, fingers spread, upper
  side exposed, and she preened it before the exasperated cowboy. She might
  have been actuated by many motives, but one of them assuredly was a
  woman&rsquo;s desire to inflict pain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckoned you was hidin&rsquo; thet from me,&rdquo; declared
  Jocelyn, tragically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You just had that idea. Why should I hide it from you&mdash;or
  anybody else? ... It&rsquo;s my engagement ring.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Engagement!&rdquo; echoed Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore.... An&rsquo; I may as well announce it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wimmen shore air hell,&rdquo; muttered Jocelyn, more to himself, as
  if the puzzle of Molly Dunn&rsquo;s dual nature was beyond him. He seemed to
  be studying her as a species new to him, as fascinating as mysterious. And
  his doubt grew.</p>

  <p>Jim took advantage of the moment to glance across the open to the slope,
  up and down, and to each side. He was about to believe he had been deceived,
  when far down to the left, at the edge of the forest, he saw something
  move&mdash;a shadow of a branch or the tail of a horse or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, who gave you thet ring?&rdquo; went on Jocelyn, coming to
  himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mister James Traft,&rdquo; replied Molly, blushing deeply. Even
  though she was playing a woman&rsquo;s wit against this jealous lover, she
  could not conceal her maidenly confusion, her pride and joy.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn bellowed like a bull.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Since when? How long you bin engaged to this &mdash;&mdash;
  tenderfoot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon&mdash;since the night of the <i>rodeo</i> dance in
  Flag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Perhaps nothing else could have shaken Jocelyn as this mortal blow to his
  vanity. Perhaps Molly was working on that very weakness. If so, she was
  taking desperate chances and she knew it. A transformation took place in
  Jocelyn, not a swift one, but a gradual breaking up of illusive force, of the
  one vital vulnerable link in his personality, and it left him a cold, hard
  fiend.</p>

  <p>As he whipped up his gun Molly stepped in front of him, to shield Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to kill me first,&rdquo; she declared,
  resolutely. Certain it was, however, that she knew he would not shoot
  her.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn was in no hurry now. He had a gun in his hand. He would torture as
  well as slay.</p>

  <p>Seth Haverly, however, took him as seriously menacing Molly. &ldquo;My
  Gawd, Jocelyn&mdash;put thet down!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. I feel too much at home with my gun stickin&rsquo; out in
  front.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly seemed to Jim to be at the end of her rope. Slowly Jocelyn backed
  her toward where Jim sat, his head against the post, still holding the broken
  whisky bottle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Seth Haverly, but you&rsquo;re a rotten coward!&rdquo; cried
  Molly. &ldquo;You leave it for a girl to face this devil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Molly, devil or not, I&rsquo;m in a deal with him,&rdquo;
  expostulated Seth, as if stung. &ldquo;An&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t no call fer
  me to risk my hide.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deal, yes&mdash;a dirtier deal than you know.
  He&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly Dunn,&rdquo; cut in Jocelyn, &ldquo;shet your jaw&mdash;or
  it&rsquo;ll be too late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too late! Why, you poison-tongued snake&mdash;do you think
  I&rsquo;d believe you again? ... You can kill me an&rsquo;
  Jim&mdash;an&rsquo; this yellow bunch, for all I care. But, by God! I&rsquo;m
  givin&rsquo; you away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jocelyn made a fierce reach for her. But he did not quite lose himself in
  the passion of the moment. He had to stand clear, to be free, to watch the
  Haverlys. So he dared not close in with her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m warnin&rsquo; you onct more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly must have kept her burning eyes on him, at bay, while she denounced
  him to the Cibeque.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Seth, <i>he</i> cut the drift fence, even while he was
  workin&rsquo; on the Diamond. An&rsquo; after. He aimed to get you an&rsquo;
  Slinger blamed for that. He&rsquo;s double-crossed you as he did Jim. He
  means to take <i>all</i> the ransom money ... to murder Jim an&rsquo; lay
  that on to you.... Oh, I <i>know</i>. I see through him&mdash;now.... He got
  me up heah&mdash;by swearin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d save Jim&rsquo;s life
  if&mdash;if I&rsquo;d give in to him. I agreed. An&rsquo; then he kept at
  me&mdash;all night long&mdash;an&rsquo; once I had&mdash;to fight him. But
  I&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t give in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You pop-eyed cat,&rdquo; yelled Jocelyn, stridently. &ldquo;Who
  wants you to give in?&mdash;I&rsquo;ll rope you like I would a mean
  hawse!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly the gun banged. Jim felt the bottle blown off his head. Molly
  screamed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right under your arm, Molly,&rdquo; said Jocelyn.
  &ldquo;How&rsquo;s thet fer shootin&rsquo;?&rdquo; And he began to step from
  one side to the other, the gun extended about even with his hip.</p>

  <p>Molly did not back away from his formidable advance. She blocked his every
  move, interposing her body between the gun and Jim. Then like a cat she
  pounced upon Jocelyn&rsquo;s hand, shoving it out of line. Bang! The bullet
  scattered dust and gravel over Jim. Both her hands and then her teeth were
  locked on Jocelyn&rsquo;s wrist.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leggo!&rdquo; he yelled, lustily, wrestling to get free. But he
  could not free himself. With left hand he lifted Molly by her hair. He swung
  her clear of the ground, her weight nothing to his powerful arms. But he
  could not shake her grip. Blood began to drip from his wrist.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bite, &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; he cursed. And lifting her he tried to
  get the gun on Jim. But as he pulled the trigger she swung desperately,
  spoiling his aim. The gun roared and a bullet tore splinters out of the post
  beside Jim&rsquo;s ear, and whirred away into the forest. The recoil of the
  heavy Colt loosened Molly&rsquo;s teeth, but not her hands. She screeched
  like a wild creature. Before Jocelyn could take advantage of this, she again
  buried her teeth in his wrist. He swung her aside, but she alighted on her
  feet. He fought her to and fro, until they entered the cabin. Haverly and his
  men were caught in a trap. Like rats they ran to dodge behind the stall, yet
  to peep out at this extraordinary encounter.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn took another snap shot at Jim, narrowly missing him. The shock of
  this explosion, right at her ear, appeared to weaken Molly, for she let go
  with her teeth, and her weight sagged on Jocelyn&rsquo;s arm. He shifted his
  left hand from her hair to her neck, where his long fingers shut like a vise.
  Yet on the instant he could not get loose. His malignant cry, however, hoarse
  and exultant, attested to the victory he saw. Molly could no longer move. He
  was lifting her, and the gun.</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s distended sight caught a shadow of something passing him. He
  could not move, even his eyes, but out of the tail of his right he saw a
  buckskin-clad figure that had appeared as if by magic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Hey, cowpuncher!</i>&rdquo; rang out the voice of Slinger
  Dunn.</p>

  <p>Jocelyn jerked up his head and a fleeting consternation showed on his
  convulsed face. He let go of Molly&rsquo;s neck. And as her hands slipped
  loose she slid down.</p>

  <p>Like a whipcord Jocelyn&rsquo;s gun leaped. But as it leaped Dunn&rsquo;s
  crashed. Jocelyn appeared to be arrested. Then shot through the heart, he
  staggered forward, with an awful look that set blankly, and plunged step by
  halting step, to fall clear outside of the cabin.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">A HEAVY breath escaped Slinger Dunn as he removed his gaze
  from the twitching Jocelyn to Molly and then to the bound Traft. His battered
  face was scarcely recognizable, but his eyes were wide open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears like I didn&rsquo;t get heah none too soon,&rdquo; he
  drawled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger! Just&mdash;in time!&rdquo; gasped Jim.</p>

  <p>Molly sat up dazedly, her hair disordered, blood on her chin and nerveless
  hands. &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Oh!&mdash;Oh!&rdquo; she moaned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Air you hurted, Molly?&rdquo; asked Dunn.</p>

  <p>She stared wildly. &ldquo;<i>Arch!</i>&rdquo; she cried, in recognition.
  &ldquo;Is&mdash;he daid?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon, onless he wears a big watch in his breast
  pocket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly got shakily to her feet and ran unevenly to Jim, where she fell,
  still game, still proof against the collapse that had taken her strength.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cut&mdash;this&mdash;rope,&rdquo; she whispered, huskily, plucking
  at Jim&rsquo;s bonds.</p>

  <p>Dunn, with a wary glance at the back of the cabin, dropped a knife in
  front of Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim&mdash;did he&mdash;hit you?&rdquo; she asked, fearfully, as she
  freed his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. But I sure know what a bullet sounds like.... Let me have the
  knife.... Molly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I cain&rsquo;t heah you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His gun deafened
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim severed the knotted rope and got up, lifting Molly with him, which
  action assured her that he was uninjured.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;thank heaven!&rdquo; She cried, sinking against him.
  &ldquo;Jim! Jim! I thought&mdash;he&rsquo;d hit you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim held her tight, and probably no other moment of his life could ever
  equal that one. Following it he became aware of Dunn sheathing his gun.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come out heah!&rdquo; he called, and his voice was piercing enough
  to penetrate more than a board stall.</p>

  <p>Seth Haverly came out first, livid of face, and Matty followed, visibly
  shaken, but unafraid.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Slinger, he had us buffaloed,&rdquo; explained Seth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who else back there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sam slouched out, then Hart Merriwell, and lastly Fletch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Boyd?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jocelyn sent him with a letter to old Jim Traft.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh.&rdquo; Then Dunn turned to his sister.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, you was shore fightin&rsquo; thet skunk, an&rsquo; I
  needn&rsquo;t ask if he got the best of you. But Seth, heah, an&rsquo;
  Sam&mdash;did they stand around an&rsquo; let thet hombre bulldog
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The moment was critical and Molly reacted to it as might have been
  expected from Slinger Dunn&rsquo;s sister. If Jim had had the impulse to
  check her he suppressed it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They shore did,&rdquo; she cried, lifting her pale face from
  Jim&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;An&rsquo; what is wuss, Arch, they <i>believed</i>
  him ... believed I&rsquo;d got thick with him an&rsquo; come up heah, a
  willin&rsquo; hussy.... I agreed to give in to Jocelyn&mdash;if he saved
  Jim&rsquo;s life. No use lyin&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;d have done it.... But I
  never trusted him. I lay back there in the stall&mdash;listenin&rsquo;
  an&rsquo; watchin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; pretty soon I knew his game.... Arch, I
  was &rsquo;most crazy. I prayed&mdash;an&rsquo; I peeped out through a chink
  between the logs. An&rsquo; I saw you comin&rsquo; under the pines! ...
  <i>Oh!</i> then I had to brace an&rsquo; keep Jocelyn off his
  guard&mdash;till you&mdash;could get heah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon it&rsquo;s aboot good fer Jim Traft thet you
  <i>air</i> Slinger Dunn&rsquo;s sister,&rdquo; drawled Dunn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good and fine and wonderful,&rdquo; declared Jim, fervently.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thanking God she <i>is</i> Molly Dunn of the
  Cibeque!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet squares you with me, Jim Traft,&rdquo; replied Slinger,
  gruffly. &ldquo;Take her away from the cabin.... An&rsquo; wash the blood
  offen her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim was not loath to lead Molly away, half supporting her in his arm. He
  lifted her across the brook, surprised and pleased to find she was a pretty
  heavy little chunk. He led her on, across the open grassy flat and up the
  first gentle slope to a pine tree, where a fragrant brown matt, and shade,
  invited a stop.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is far enough,&rdquo; he said, letting her down.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me. There&rsquo;ll be a fight,&rdquo; she cried,
  clinging to him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But only to the brook to wet my scarf.... You&rsquo;re all
  bloody.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then hurry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim made short work of the trip down to the brook, and while soaking his
  silken scarf he heard a loud angry protest of Haverly in the cabin, and the
  cold ring of Slinger&rsquo;s voice. He ran back to Molly. She was spitting
  like an angry cat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I bit him, Jim, I bit him! I&rsquo;d have chewed him to pieces... .
  But now it&rsquo;s over I&rsquo;m sick&mdash;sick with the taste an&rsquo;
  smell an&rsquo; sight of his blood.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And as she spat out she did look sick.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, darling. Your biting saved my life.... My God! how
  wonderful you were&mdash;how I love you!&rdquo; And he kissed her
  passionately, stained lips and chin and hands.</p>

  <p>Evidently this treatment effectually checked her nausea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;Jim&mdash;somebody&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who cares?&mdash;But let me scrub you good,&rdquo; laughed Jim, and
  he did scrub her mouth inside and outside, and nearly washed the skin off her
  chin, and likewise the little strong brown hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There goes one. Slinger&rsquo;s let him off. Look!&rdquo; said
  Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Matty,&rdquo; replied Jim, recognizing the tall member
  of Seth&rsquo;s outfit. He was in a hurry, and snatching up a saddle and
  bridle he strode off up the park, looking back over his shoulder. &ldquo;He
  didn&rsquo;t seem a bad sort of fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. Slinger is hell when he&rsquo;s&mdash;like you saw
  him.... Oh, but wasn&rsquo;t Hack Jocelyn the
  dastardliest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sweetheart, don&rsquo;t think of him,&rdquo; entreated Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s daid! An&rsquo; Slinger killed him&mdash;all on my
  account.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, not all. Some on mine, and some on his own.... Honey, did you
  really mean you&rsquo;d accepted me&mdash;when you threw it up to
  Jocelyn&mdash;that we were engaged?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Jim&mdash;but, man alive, you cain&rsquo;t make love to me
  now! I tell you Slinger will <i>kill</i> Seth Haverly, an&rsquo; like as not
  Sam, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, but I hope not,&rdquo; declared Jim. &ldquo;All
  the same, Molly Dunn, while they&rsquo;re palavering I <i>can</i> make love
  to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Funny tenderfoot from Missourie you are&mdash;I guess not,&rdquo;
  she declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost another Curly Prentiss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. You couldn&rsquo;t pay me a compliment that&rsquo;d please
  me more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, I&rsquo;d have liked Curly if he hadn&rsquo;t the
  cowboys&rsquo; weakness,&rdquo; said Molly, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bein&rsquo; too gay with a girl&mdash;the very first
  thing&mdash;all same like an Easterner I met once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&mdash;Where&rsquo;d you meet <i>him</i>, Molly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon it was in Flag.... Oh&mdash;Jim&mdash;&rdquo; She was
  surrendering to his arm, when suddenly she started up. &ldquo;Look! Another
  leavin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the cook. Fletch, they called him,&rdquo; said Jim,
  watching the man, who lost no time in imitating Matty&rsquo;s example in
  making tracks from the cabin, burdened by his saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hart Merriwell left, besides Seth an&rsquo; Sam. Slinger will let
  Hart go. Now you watch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Presently Jim espied Merriwell come out, in no great hurry, and instead of
  striding away he slipped round to the back of the cabin and peered through a
  chink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, there must be something up,&rdquo; declared Jim
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen! That&rsquo;s Slinger shoutin&rsquo;,&rdquo; rejoined
  Molly.</p>

  <p>Jim did distinguish Slinger&rsquo;s voice, with its high ringing note, but
  only the sound carried so far. What meaning he could attach to the harangue
  he had to supply himself. But as Slinger kept on it was no great task to
  imagine the storm of violent backwoods profanity with which he was berating
  the brothers who had betrayed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just like I heahed once at a dance,&rdquo; said Molly, with a sigh.
  &ldquo;There!&rdquo; She jerked spasmodically at the crack of a gun, and
  clapping her hands over her ears she sagged against Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh!&mdash;That didn&rsquo;t sound like Slinger&rsquo;s
  gun!&rdquo; ejaculated Jim, and all his being seemed suspended upon his
  hearing. Bang! &ldquo;That was Slinger&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he went on, huskily,
  tightening an arm round Molly. Shots followed, three or four, so swiftly as
  to be hardly separated. Then again came the heavy boom and a volley of
  lighter reports. There was a pause that might have been a suspension of
  hostilities. Jim dared believe it was over. Then followed loud reports, a
  heavy one&mdash;more of the sharp rifle shots&mdash;another heavy, and
  quickly the boom. Silence! Smoke drifted out of the cabin, showing blue
  against the green pines. Hart Merriwell, who had evidently run off, appeared
  coming slowly back, halting, waiting, then approaching again. But there were
  no more shots.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All&mdash;daid!&rdquo; whispered Molly, lifting her head. She must
  have been able to hear the shots even with her ears covered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; replied Jim, huskily. &ldquo;I
  see Merriwell coming back.... There. He&rsquo;s going in.... Molly,
  I&rsquo;ll go, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the end&mdash;of the Cibeque,&rdquo; she murmured.
  &ldquo;Poor Arch! ... He wasn&rsquo;t all bad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay here, Molly,&rdquo; admonished Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
  back&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo; He squeezed her hand, and getting up he
  ran down the slope, leaped the brook, and soon reached the cabin. As he
  peeped round the post, against which he had sat not many minutes past, his
  hand came in contact with the place splintered by Jocelyn&rsquo;s bullet.</p>

  <p>The interior of the cabin was still smoky. Jim saw one of the men huddled
  in a heap. Then on the other side he espied Merriwell kneeling beside
  Slinger, whom he had propped up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;alive yet?&rdquo; called Jim, breathlessly, and he ran
  in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo! Shore, Slinger&rsquo;s alive, but shot all up,&rdquo;
  replied Merriwell. &ldquo;Help me carry him out of this smoke.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They lifted the bleeding, broken body and carried it out to the shady
  side, where they laid it on a blanket. While Jim lifted Slinger&rsquo;s head
  Merriwell placed a saddle under it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;ll&mdash;cash in, Slinger, ole pard,&rdquo; he
  said, gulping. &ldquo;Anythin&rsquo; I can do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Molly?&rdquo; asked Dunn, faintly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s across the brook. I&rsquo;ll call her,&rdquo; replied
  Jim, and he got up to go round the cabin. Molly was coming. She had seen them
  carry her brother out. Jim went out to meet her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, he&rsquo;s alive. He asked for you.&rdquo; He had to run to
  keep up to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Arch!&rdquo; burst out Molly, dropping on her knees. &ldquo;Are
  you&mdash;bad hurt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Molly, I ain&rsquo;t hurt atall&mdash;but I
  reckon&mdash;I&rsquo;m done fer,&rdquo; he said, feebly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where there&rsquo;s life there&rsquo;s hope,&rdquo; interposed Jim,
  as he too knelt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, cain&rsquo;t we do anythin&rsquo;?&rdquo; cried Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t happen&mdash;to have some&mdash;whisky?&rdquo;
  replied Slinger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some here,&rdquo; said Jim, leaping up. &ldquo;Where
  did I see it? ... Jocelyn had it.&rdquo; Jim ran to the saddle-bags, and
  procuring the flask he rushed back. Dunn took a stiff drink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Jim Traft, you&rsquo;re lucky&mdash;thet you&rsquo;re not
  layin&rsquo; around heah full of bullet holes,&rdquo; he said, in stronger
  voice, not devoid of humor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I guess yes,&rdquo; said Jim, fervently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was fer killin&rsquo; you myself&mdash;till Molly made me&mdash;a
  promise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What promise?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, air you goin&rsquo; to keep it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Arch,&rdquo; replied Molly, as she bent over him, her bright
  tears falling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good! Reckon thet&rsquo;ll be aboot all,&rdquo; said Slinger, with
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly dear, tell me the promise,&rdquo; rejoined Jim,
  earnestly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, he was shore set on killin&rsquo; you. I begged him not to.
  An&rsquo; he said he&rsquo;d let you off&mdash;if I&mdash;I would make you
  ask me again&mdash;to marry you&mdash;an&rsquo; take you up.... So I
  promised.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim took Dunn&rsquo;s limp hand. &ldquo;Slinger, she&rsquo;d never have
  had to make me. I&rsquo;d kept asking till doomsday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Then you&rsquo;re powerful fond of my kid sister.... Wal, I
  cain&rsquo;t thank Gawd fer much&mdash;but I do fer thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s <i>do</i> somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; burst out Molly,
  in desperation. &ldquo;Hart, where&rsquo;s he shot bad?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lord! he&rsquo;s shot bad all over,&rdquo; declared Merriwell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, I tell you bullet holes are nothin&rsquo; to Slinger Dunn.
  He&rsquo;s not bleedin&rsquo; at the lungs, because he&rsquo;d be
  spittin&rsquo; blood. This cut on his haid isn&rsquo;t bad. His left arm is
  broke. There&rsquo;s a hole in his right shoulder.... Heah, low down is the
  bad one.... Oh, my Heavens!&mdash;But let&rsquo;s tie it tight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The practical Molly prompted the stricken men to get busy and do what was
  possible for the wounded one. Jim believed the gun-shot in the abdomen would
  have killed any ordinary man. It had gone clear through. They padded that and
  bound it up. He had another dangerous wound in the hip, which, according to
  Merriwell, like the hole in his abdomen, had been made with a rifle.</p>

  <p>While they washed and dressed his wounds, as best they could do it with
  limited means, Slinger talked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sam throwed fust on me, when I was keepin&rsquo; two eyes on Seth.
  An&rsquo; he got me thet crack in the belly. It keeled me over, or the
  fight&rsquo;d been short an&rsquo; sweet.... I nailed Sam. Then Seth showed
  his true color at last. He dove fer the stall an&rsquo; began shootin&rsquo;
  from behind. He had a Colt an&rsquo; a forty-four Winchester. An&rsquo; he
  shore pumped lead into me.... I sent a couple through the stall. Hit him, fer
  he cussed hard. But he come back at me. Then I flopped over along the wall,
  where he couldn&rsquo;t see me onless he come out. He&rsquo;d used up all his
  shells fer the Colt. Anyway, he didn&rsquo;t take risk to load, an&rsquo;
  stuck to the rifle. Reckon thet beat him. I got to the corner by the
  stall&mdash;leaned over quick&mdash;an&rsquo; bored him&mdash;when he was
  tryin&rsquo; to shift the rifle round.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Beyond a slight huskiness Dunn&rsquo;s voice did not depart radically from
  a tone of ordinary conversation. There was no trace of emotion, unless the
  mere fact of lengthy recital of the fray was one. He had a remarkable
  vitality. Jim knew that in case of injury, especially from gun-shots, the
  next perilous thing to the wound itself was the shock to the consciousness.
  This probably had not occurred in Dunn at all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Merriwell, what more is to be done?&rdquo; queried Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon nuthin&rsquo;, onless he wants us to pray. How aboot it,
  Slinger?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; was the laconic reply. He lay still, with closed eyes,
  a limp and ghastly sight. Molly sat beside him, supporting his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heah hosses,&rdquo; suddenly spoke up Dunn, opening his eyes.</p>

  <p>They all listened, and Jim shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t close enough to the ground. I shore heah
  hosses,&rdquo; added Dunn.</p>

  <p>Merriwell got up to walk out away from the cabin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bunch of cowboys comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, excitedly.
  &ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;d better make myself scarce.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim joined him. &ldquo;No need to run, Merriwell. That&rsquo;s Curly
  Prentiss and some of my outfit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By gum! An&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve ketched Matty an&rsquo;
  Fletch,&rdquo; ejaculated the other.</p>

  <p>So it appeared to be, and presently Jim made certain of it. Curly rode
  down the slope, followed by Bud and Lonestar and Jackson Way, who had in tow
  the late fleeing members of the Cibeque.</p>

  <p>Curly threw his bridle and made one sweep of his long leg and slid to the
  ground. A blue flash of keen eyes took in the situation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, boss! Mawnin&rsquo;, Miss Molly!&rdquo; he said, and lifted
  his sombrero from his bright hair. Then he bent his gaze upon the prostrate
  Dunn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Prentiss, you&rsquo;re a little late in the day,&rdquo; said Dunn.
  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m recommendin&rsquo; you let Matty an&rsquo; Fletch go. I
  did.... It was Jocelyn an&rsquo; Seth an&rsquo; Sam. Take a look in the
  cabin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Curly did as he was bidden, returning promptly, a queer cold look in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Slinger, it shore was a good job. But I&rsquo;m sorry they got
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I ain&rsquo;t cashed yet, an&rsquo; if I do it shore
  won&rsquo;t be owin&rsquo; to Seth or Jocelyn. Sam&rsquo;s the one who bored
  me. I wasn&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; fer it from him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bud Chalfack and the cowboys came riding down, to halt before the
  group.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone, Jim, if it ain&rsquo;t fine to see you on yore
  feet,&rdquo; said Bud, heartily. &ldquo;How do, Molly! ... Somebody tell me
  what&rsquo;s come off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon Jim briefly related the circumstances leading up to the stop at
  this cabin, the wrangle over the conditions of the ransom, the blackguard
  conduct of Jocelyn, and the several fights that succeeded. If Jim emphasized
  anything it was the wit and courage and ferocity of Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone me!&rdquo; burst out Bud, with worshipful eyes on the
  girl. &ldquo;Molly, I always knowed you was the sweetest an&rsquo;
  wonderfulest little devil in Arizonie, but now I jest haf to take off my hat
  to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And he did it, quite gallantly.</p>

  <p>Curly&rsquo;s encomium was directed at Jim. &ldquo;You lucky son-of-a-gun!
  To come out heah an&rsquo; steal her from us!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Slinger had missed nothing of all this. He seemed not only incredibly
  tenacious of life, but singularly possessed of receptive faculties.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, fellars, she&rsquo;s Molly Dunn of the Cibeque,&rdquo; he
  drawled.</p>

  <p>Molly took exception to compliments on the moment. &ldquo;You heartless
  cowpunchers! Heah&rsquo;s daid men all aboot an&rsquo; Slinger
  dyin&rsquo;&mdash;yet you talk an&rsquo; make eyes at me. Jim, you&rsquo;re
  just as bad. Curly, haven&rsquo;t you got some sense?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I&rsquo;m shore beggin&rsquo; your pardon,&rdquo; replied
  Curly, contritely, as he threw off his gloves and knelt by Slinger.
  &ldquo;Tell me jest where he&rsquo;s shot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly and Merriwell together gave him the desired information. Curly got
  up, decisive though grave. &ldquo;Mebbe he&rsquo;s-a chance. You cain&rsquo;t
  kill some fellars.... Jack, ride to Flag an&rsquo; fetch back the doctor. He
  can drive a buckboard clear to Cottonwood. You lead an extra saddlehoss,
  an&rsquo; then come rustlin&rsquo; across country.... Holliday, you an&rsquo;
  Bud go back to camp an&rsquo; pack some of our outfit over heah. Fetch the
  boss&rsquo;s pack an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t fergit everythin&rsquo; to make Miss
  Molly comfortable.... Boss, do you want to hold these Cibeque men heah? I
  reckon if we let them go they&rsquo;ll haid Flick off with thet ransom money.
  An&rsquo; we shore don&rsquo;t want to lose thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold them, then, till Flick comes back,&rdquo; replied Jim.
  &ldquo;You and I can take turns on guard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Traft,&rdquo; spoke up Matty, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d like to
  know, we&rsquo;re so darn glad the way things hev come off thet we
  won&rsquo;t need watchin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">SLINGER DUNN sank into a pallid insensible state that Jim
  believed was the coma preceding death. Molly, too, succumbed to a fear that
  every moment would be his last. But the hours passed; the three prisoners
  played cards and made no trouble whatever; Curly and Jim erected a tarpaulin
  shelter over Dunn, and a spruce-bough bed for Molly beside him; they got
  supper from the coarse stores they found in Haverly&rsquo;s packs; the
  setting sun filled the forest with a mellow glory; the heavy buffeting wings
  of wild turkeys going to roost in the pines broke the silence. And Slinger
  Dunn still lived.</p>

  <p>Night fell, and the wind moaned the threatening storm. Coyotes ranged the
  park and yelped a staccato whining protest at the camp fire. Weird flickering
  shadows played on the cabin and the improvised tent. Molly sat close to her
  brother, leaning against the wall, silent and watchful. The only way she
  could ascertain that Dunn still lived was by touch, and when his pulse grew
  imperceptible and his hands cold she laid her head on his breast to listen to
  his heart.</p>

  <p>Jim stayed up with her, and seldom left her, except to replenish the fire
  and take a look at the inside of the cabin, where the prisoners slept. Curly
  lay across the opening, and every time Jim stepped near, though ever so
  noiselessly, he would awaken. The dead men had been moved to a corner of the
  cabin and covered with canvas.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Jim paced up and down, finding action helpful to the surcharged
  condition of his mind. He never closed an eye, and seldom indeed was there an
  interval of any length when he was not watching Molly. In the dead of night
  there in that lonely forest he came to full appreciation of her sterling
  worth and a deep respect for the primitive life that had developed her. Many
  things considered by civilized people as necessary were merely superficial.
  Molly had the great qualities, virtue, courage, and love.</p>

  <p>When he would approach her, as he did often, and sink down on one knee to
  peer at the pale Slinger, Molly would take hold of him. By the firelight he
  could see the big eyes, black as night, rest upon him with a glance that made
  him wonder how life had come to reward him so beautifully.</p>

  <p>Towards dawn the wind ceased and despite the overhanging clouds the air
  chilled until it grew bitter cold. Jim wrapped his coat round Molly and laid
  his saddle blanket over Slinger. He kept the fire going, and stood close to
  it, burning his palms, turning from front to back.</p>

  <p>It grew very black and still, the formidable hour before dawn when even
  the life of the forest seemed at lowest ebb. Slinger would go soon, Jim
  thought.</p>

  <p>Molly called him. &ldquo;He whispered somethin&rsquo; just now,&rdquo; she
  said. &ldquo;I think he called for Seth&rsquo;s sister. He was sweet on her.
  ... She&rsquo;ll hate even his memory now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim sat with her then, silently awaiting the end, holding her against him.
  It seemed the most melancholy and poignant of all the long night hours. How
  welcome the first gray streaks! Something ghastly and ghostly stole away into
  the forest. A fine misty rain began to fall. Daylight at last with Slinger
  Dunn still not dead!</p>

  <p>Curly appeared around the corner of the cabin, yawning, and stretching his
  lithe length.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mawnin&rsquo;, you babes in the woods,&rdquo; he said, and dropped
  beside them, to lean over Dunn. &ldquo;Wal, Slinger, old man, I reckoned
  you&rsquo;d be long where the blue flags an&rsquo; the cornflowers
  blow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, not yet,&rdquo; replied Jim. &ldquo;All night we&rsquo;ve
  been expecting him to die. And every moment the last hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It takes so long,&rdquo; said Molly, sadly.</p>

  <p>Curly placed his ear over Dunn&rsquo;s heart and listened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you both got the willies,&rdquo; he declared, as he rose with
  a glad smile. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to croak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; ejaculated Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Curly!&rdquo; cried Molly, in an agony of hope.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore he&rsquo;ll live. I ain&rsquo;t no doctor, but I&rsquo;ve
  seen a heap of fellars pass out. An&rsquo; Slinger don&rsquo;t show no
  earmarks of thet this mawnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly&rsquo;s little remaining strength eked out here and she collapsed in
  Jim&rsquo;s arms. He let her gently down on the bed of spruce and covered her
  over. &ldquo;Go to sleep, honey,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to rain,&rdquo; announced Curly, when
  indeed it was raining already. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rig up another tarp heah
  fer Slinger.... Look! Molly asleep all in a jiffy. Poor kid! ... Jim, I
  don&rsquo;t see how I kin give her up to you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? Well, please be reasonable about it,&rdquo;
  replied Jim, dryly.</p>

  <p>They stretched a tarpaulin over the makeshift canvas shelter.
  &ldquo;Thet&rsquo;ll do fer a spell. Mebbe we kin move him into the cabin
  after Doc Shields looks him over.... But say, boss, how aboot them stiffs in
  there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to be buried, of course.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, the Haverlys ought to have decent burial, I s&rsquo;pose, but
  thet Hack Jocelyn, &mdash;&mdash;, he ought to be throwed to the
  coyotes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim followed Curly inside. He stripped the scant covering off the bodies.
  It was not a pretty spectacle. Jim recoiled. But Curly viewed it
  differently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Daid center on thet left vest pocket,&rdquo; he muttered, bending
  over Jocelyn. &ldquo;Slinger&rsquo;s fancy shot, I&rsquo;ve heahed say. Wal,
  I&rsquo;m durned if I want the jasper slingin&rsquo; one at me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim went back to rouse the three prisoners.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Roll out, you buckaroos, and help get breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Matty lumbered up cheerfully, and the others followed with an alacrity
  that presupposed a desire to please. Probably they did not hold themselves
  guilty of the deal hatched by the Haverlys and Jocelyn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, you Cibeque duffers,&rdquo; said Curly, facetiously, &ldquo;I
  fell asleep purpose last night so you could sneak off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Prentiss, I&rsquo;d hate to of tried it. But all we own in the
  world is this pack outfit,&rdquo; explained Matty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, thet ain&rsquo;t a hell uv a lot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While they ate breakfast the rain ceased and blue sky showed overhead,
  soon to be obscured, however, by fast scudding clouds out of the
  southwest.</p>

  <p>Molly slept on, and even the bells on the Diamond pack-horses ringing down
  the slope did not wake her. Jim did not recall ever being so glad to see
  cowboys as then.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The whole night long!&rdquo; sang out Bud. &ldquo;The whole night
  long!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, Bud, if it was long for you, what do you suppose it was for
  Molly and me?&rdquo; retorted Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see you haven&rsquo;t covered Stinger&rsquo;s face, so he
  mustn&rsquo;t hev croaked yet,&rdquo; replied Bud, practically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, boys! Sure glad to see you,&rdquo; said Jim, running his eye
  over the group. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Hump and Uphill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Cherry will tell you what he thinks, an&rsquo; it
  ain&rsquo;t no cheerful news,&rdquo; announced Bud. &ldquo;We left some uv
  the hosses an&rsquo; packs. Jeff is comin&rsquo; somewhere back. He shore
  hates a saddle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Cherry?&rdquo; queried Jim, approaching Winters,
  who was dismounting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I reckon Stevens an&rsquo; Frost hev struck somethin&rsquo;
  out at the head of Derrick. We left a note fer them to hit our trail.
  An&rsquo; I reckon they&rsquo;ll be along, mebbe tonight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim did not see in Cherry&rsquo;s words much to be worried about. But
  still less did he like Cherry&rsquo;s expression than the hint in Bud&rsquo;s
  remark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, unpack and make camp,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;If Dunn pulls
  through we&rsquo;ll have to stay here for days. Put up the little tent for
  Molly, if you fetched it. But first thing after you unpack bury these dead
  men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One by one, Bud leading, the cowboys went up to have a look at Slinger and
  Molly. Strange to say, no remarks were forthcoming, which was probably owing
  to solicitude for the girl. Then, after the fashion of cowboys, they set to
  work. Jeff Davis rode down into camp, and added his efficient hands to the
  task.</p>

  <p>The rain held off till early in the afternoon, when it began to fall in
  earnest. Molly slept on through it all, dry and snug under shelter and
  blanket. Slinger showed no change. The three Cibeque men had been
  unceremoniously moved out of the cabin, which the cowboys had thoroughly
  cleaned. Jim, after a short stay beside Molly and her brother, watchful to
  see any change in the latter, went inside the cabin to wait. There was
  nothing much to do now, but wait.</p>

  <p>Bud appeared to be industriously working over something. It was a section
  of aspen tree, split in half, on the white surface of which he had carved
  some words. Jim bent over Curly, who was intent on the artist.</p>

  <p>Hackamore Jocelyn, N. G. Drift Fence Cutter Died with his boots on, Sept.
  1889.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I clean forgit the date,&rdquo; said Bud, viewing his work with
  satisfaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Reckon it&rsquo;s aboot the twenty-third. Towards the end of
  September, anyhow. An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the date amount to? Jocelyn should
  never hev bin borned. All we aim to celebrate with this heah tombstone is
  thet he&rsquo;s damn good an&rsquo; daid,&rdquo; replied Curly.</p>

  <p>The other cowboys noted Bud&rsquo;s work with quite different points of
  view.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, anyone could see you onct worked in a graveyard,&rdquo; said
  Cherry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idee&mdash;cuttin&rsquo; out a haidpiece fer thet
  greaser?&rdquo; inquired Lonestar, scornfully. &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be sum
  sense in it if we&rsquo;d buried Slinger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. But it&rsquo;s good practice in case Slinger croaks,&rdquo;
  observed Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hev I gotta tell you fellars any more thet Slinger will
  live?&rdquo; queried Curly, annoyed that his judgment was questioned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He might, Curly. Life is darn oncertain. I&rsquo;ll bet you Slinger
  croaks,&rdquo; returned Bud, much animated at the prospect of a wager.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw hell!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, then, I&rsquo;ll bet you he croaks before Doc Shields gits
  hyar,&rdquo; went on Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d gamble on your grandma&rsquo;s coffin,&rdquo; asserted
  Curly, in supreme disgust. &ldquo;Funniest thing, too. You always
  lose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like hob I do! Right this minnit your spurs an&rsquo; chaps belong
  to me. You&rsquo;d be naked &rsquo;most but fer my magnamity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, it shore ain&rsquo;t no wonder no gurl will stick to
  you,&rdquo; replied Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s a gurl got to do with games uv chance? I&rsquo;m a born
  better, as you know to your cost.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll bet on anythin&rsquo; in Gawd&rsquo;s
  world,&rdquo; protested Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s the secret. How much did I clean up when the boss
  licked you&mdash;an&rsquo; Cherry an&rsquo; Up an&rsquo; Lonestar? Huh! I got
  it all down, an&rsquo; if we live to reach Flag ag&rsquo;in, I&rsquo;ll be
  rich.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be drunk, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, you make me orful tired. If I wasn&rsquo;t so all-fired fond
  uv you&mdash;fer no reason thet any human bein&rsquo; could
  see&mdash;I&rsquo;d be riled at your insults.... Now listen. Money talks. Put
  up or shet up. Hyar&rsquo;s my roll.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bud exhibited a roll of greenbacks that made Curly&rsquo;s eyes stick out
  and likewise excited Lonestar and Cherry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;n hell&rsquo;d you git thet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I bin holdin&rsquo; out. Now produce your roll. It&rsquo;ll look
  like a peapod thet a hoss stepped on.... Wal mebbe not so flat,&rdquo; added
  Bud, as Curly retaliated by surprising him. &ldquo;Now, hyar&rsquo;s a bet
  thet&rsquo;ll show how game I am. My roll ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; yours thet
  Slinger <i>won&rsquo;t</i> croak!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Curly&rsquo;s face was saved, and the risk of his money, too, by the
  arrival of Jack Way and Dr. Shields. The latter was a little man, lost in a
  heavy slicker. From the exchange of greetings he was well acquainted with
  several of the Diamond. He got off, and out of the slicker, then removed a
  small medicine-satchel and a parcel from the saddle-bag.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your man?&rdquo; he queried, after being introduced
  to Jim. &ldquo;Fetch clean hot water.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim did not think it necessary to awaken Molly. The job would be gruesome
  and she would insist on helping. Dr. Shields felt of Dunn&rsquo;s pulse and
  heart, and said, &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; which meant little to Jim. Then he cut
  open Dunn&rsquo;s blood-caked garments, and first removed the bandages from
  the wound in the abdomen. At sight of this he shook his head. When he saw
  that the bullet had gone clear through he nodded his head. So Jim inferred it
  was both bad and good. Cherry fetched a pan of hot water. Whereupon the
  doctor went to work, and with Jim&rsquo;s assistance, in an hour had all six
  wounds dressed.</p>

  <p>To Jim&rsquo;s amaze Slinger opened his eyes. No doubt all the while he
  had been conscious.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ought to be a hoss-doctor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hurtin&rsquo;
  me wuss&rsquo;n the bullets.... Am I goin&rsquo; to cash?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dunn, that shot in your belly ought to have killed you long
  ago,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;The one in your hip is bad, but not
  critical. The others just gun-shots.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you fetch any whisky?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Shields made haste to supply this evident pressing need.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said Slinger, &ldquo;I knowed you gave me some whisky
  of Jocelyn&rsquo;s. But I shore didn&rsquo;t want to live on thet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suddenly Molly sat up, wide-eyed and bewildered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, wood-mouse! You&rsquo;ve shore slept a lot,&rdquo; said
  Dunn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Arch!&mdash;Jim!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, this is Dr. Shields from Flag. He has just attended to your
  brother&rsquo;s wounds, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Jim could not reply to Molly&rsquo;s mutely questioning eyes. And Dr.
  Shields, blunt as he was, shrank from their wonderful eager look.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, I&rsquo;m further from bein&rsquo; daid than last
  night,&rdquo; spoke up Slinger for himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk. Don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; admonished the doctor,
  and he led Jim and Molly away. &ldquo;Very likely he told the truth,&rdquo;
  continued Shields, presently. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make predictions. He ought
  to have passed out long ago. Some of these cowboys are like Indians, to whom
  bullet holes and knife-cuts are nothing. Your Curly Prentiss is one....
  Miracles happen. This man <i>might</i> live. If he lasts till tomorrow
  I&rsquo;d say there was hope. I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The rain dripped through the roof of the old cabin, in some places in
  little streams, one of which happened to go down Bud Chalfack&rsquo;s neck.
  It had the effect of a lighted match dropped in gunpowder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bud, why don&rsquo;t you git used to water?&rdquo; complained
  Curly, when the explosion had subsided.</p>

  <p>Molly had dinner in the cabin and she was the object of much solicitude.
  She went back to her shelter, claiming it dry, at least. The three Cibeque
  men became restless as the afternoon grew late. Boyd Flick did not return.
  All the cowboys save Bud passed the time playing cards. Bud had evidently
  become enamoured of his carving ability, for he spent hours over the other
  half of the aspen log. When he exhibited his latest bit of sculptural genius
  the cowboys were spellbound. Bud had hewn out a masterpiece of a wooden
  headpiece for a grave. And he had engraved upon it: &ldquo;Curly Prentiss.
  Died &mdash;&mdash;. Unmarried.&rdquo; This he presented to Curly, before the
  bursting cowboys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bow-legged, kangaroo-rat!&rdquo; declared Curly, who could not
  see the joke. &ldquo;I could of married a hundred gurls.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And so the day passed, every minute of it with less strain for Jim. He was
  attentive to Molly, who began another vigil over her brother. The rain roared
  on the canvas, but Molly was comfortable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traft, you look fagged out,&rdquo; said Dr. Shields, when night
  fell. &ldquo;Go to bed. I&rsquo;ll keep tab on Dunn and wake you if
  there&rsquo;s any turn for the worse. He simply amazes me.</p>

  <p>Jim slipped under Molly&rsquo;s shelter to encourage her and say good
  night. In the dark he was feeling round for her when she tugged at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sssh! He&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, you&rsquo;ll not sit up all night again? Dr. Shields said
  he&rsquo;d watch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay down when I get sleepy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Jim,
  I&rsquo;m beginnin&rsquo; to hope.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; replied Jim, and put his arms around her. Molly
  gave a start and then slowly relaxed. Jim waited to see what she would do.
  After a long moment she stirred, and in the dim light of the smoldering camp
  fire he saw her head come up. Then shyly and sweetly, but surely, she
  returned his embrace, and just brushed his cheek with her lips. Thrilled and
  utterly grateful and content, he bade her good night.</p>

  <p>He sought his own bed in the stall behind which Seth Haverly had met
  death. Once stretched out, Jim discovered how weary he actually was, and that
  was the extent of his conscious mental activity for this trying day. He slept
  till the ring of ax and stirring of men roused him. It was a dark, wet, gray
  dawn, but evidently the rain had ceased. While pulling on his boots, he heard
  Curly speak:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Doc, how&rsquo;s your patient this mawnin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I give up, Prentiss. You cowboys are not made of flesh and blood.
  Dunn just asked for a cigarette,&rdquo; replied the doctor.</p>

  <p>Jim went to the fire in a hurry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then he must be&mdash;be&mdash;&rdquo; he faltered, just overcome
  with hope for Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traft, I reckon he&rsquo;ll pull through. I&rsquo;ll look him over
  after breakfast. Then you can send a man with me. I left my horses tied in a
  corral over here where the road ends. Guess they&rsquo;ll be all right, but
  I&rsquo;d like to hurry.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, it shore is good,&rdquo; said Curly. &ldquo;My hunch was all
  right. But I was scared stiff fer the little gurl.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim felt too grateful for expression and had to restrain himself from
  rushing in to Molly. At the breakfast call she appeared, pale, yet somehow
  glowing, and to Jim&rsquo;s delight she chose a seat beside him.</p>

  <p>The morning showed a prospect of clearing weather. A bit of sunlight
  tipped the spear-pointed spruces on the ridge. Jays and squirrels were
  noisily in attendance upon the cabin.</p>

  <p>Dr. Shields seemed vastly relieved, and not a little glad.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Molly, you can rest easy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your brother
  will live.... Traft, I&rsquo;m leaving only a few instructions. Give Dunn a
  little whisky and water now and then, for a couple of days. If fever sets in
  send for me. But there&rsquo;s no sign of that or other complications. His
  wounds have closed clean in this forest air. Then begin to feed him
  nourishing soups, beef tea, and presently light food. But don&rsquo;t overdo.
  In about ten days make a canvas litter and have four men pack him to the
  road, where you can safely haul him in a wagon to Flag.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When the genial doctor had said good-by to all and ridden away with his
  guide, Bud ejaculated plaintively: &ldquo;Nourishin&rsquo; soup! Beef tea! I
  need somethin&rsquo; like thet myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My Gawd!&rdquo; added Curly, his loyal champion, at times.
  &ldquo;So do I. This heah fence-buildin&rsquo; has run me down to skin
  an&rsquo; bones.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a two-dollar bill thet if I got shot up our
  deaf-an&rsquo; dumb cook would feed me salt mackerel,&rdquo; ended Bud, in
  disgust.</p>

  <p>Long since Jim had learned this apparent discontent and garrulousness were
  just their perennial spirit of fun, but he still found occasion to pretend he
  did not understand them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly, you and Bud are so darn full of energy&mdash;suppose you
  split some shingles and repair the cabin roof,&rdquo; he suggested,
  dryly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, it ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to rain no more,&rdquo; replied
  Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think it might. It&rsquo;s clouding up just like Curly&rsquo;s
  face now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I&rsquo;m as weak as a sick cat,&rdquo; protested Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel better at work. That&rsquo;s what you boys need.
  Good hard work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, fer cripe&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; exploded Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Bud,&rdquo; said Curly, with resignation. &ldquo;No
  turkey-huntin&rsquo; this heah mawnin&rsquo;. We gotta work while our
  Mizzourie boss looks at his gurl like a dyin&rsquo; duck in a
  thunderstorm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They hailed Cherry on the way out, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re helpin&rsquo; us
  split shingles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo; demanded that worthy, affronted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We said so. Orders from the boss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was well that Jim had advised this job, for no sooner had it been
  completed than the swift-moving clouds rolled up black and the rain poured
  down in a gray deluge. It rained all day. The cooped-up cowboys talked and
  played and joked and quarreled. Once Jim heard a thought-provoking speech
  from Curly, evidently made in deep argument: &ldquo;Wal, <i>I</i> tell you
  gazaboos there&rsquo;s only one man in Arizonie who could fill
  Jocelyn&rsquo;s boots on the Diamond.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim saw Molly at meal-times. She had grown shyer as the strain of anxiety
  lessened. And the cowboys, now that her cause for distress had been removed,
  began to pay pretty compliments and make sly little speeches and eye her with
  flirtatious longing. She seemed even shyer with Jim. But he was happy, and
  when night fell, with the rain teeming down, he could not resist a moment
  alone with her under the canvas. Slinger, however, was awake, evidently
  suffering, and cursing Dr. Shields about the limited nips of whisky. Jim
  could only squeeze Molly&rsquo;s hand and say good night.</p>

  <p>It stormed that night, a regular equinoctial gale. The old cabin groaned
  and threatened to fly away on the winds of the wind. Jim thought there really
  was risk, for the rafters were heavy. Nevertheless, like the cowboys, he took
  the risk. It was wonderful to lie snug and warm, however, and listen to the
  crash and roar of the gale through the forest, and the intermittent and
  varying spells of rain on the roof. Now and then a faint flash of lightning
  showed the lashing pines, and dull thunder reverberated across the heavens.
  Toward morning the fury of the storm abated and it turned cold. When daylight
  came the sky was fast clearing, the air had a keen cold edge, and the color
  of the forest had perceptibly changed. There were hints of red in the maples,
  brown in the oaks, and the aspens showed a splash of gold. The willow leaves
  were gone. Autumn had come to this low part of the Diamond, and he ventured a
  guess that winter had laid a white mantle on the high promontories. This
  caused Jim concern, for he had hoped to get the drift fence finished before
  the snow fell.</p>

  <p>He went outside to wash. The morning was beautiful, with rose and gold
  clouds skimming the tree tops, and the sky a deep blue. The brook was a
  rushing torrent of amber water, full of floating aspen leaves, and it was
  cold enough to make his fingers ache.</p>

  <p>He was wiping his face with his scarf when Curly and Bud appeared, each
  with a rifle and a fine turkey gobbler.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mawnin&rsquo; boss, did you hev enough sleep?&rdquo; drawled
  Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, you ain&rsquo;t risin&rsquo; with the larks no more,&rdquo;
  added Bud, with pretended solicitude. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve no wuss
  ailment than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim swore mildly at them. &ldquo;You went wild-turkey-hunting without
  taking me! It&rsquo;s a low-down trick. When I&rsquo;ve been waiting and
  longing to go.... I&rsquo;ll get even with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I&rsquo;m downright sorry,&rdquo; replied Curly, with
  profound regret. &ldquo;But it was dark an&rsquo; cold, an&rsquo; Bud
  says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, don&rsquo;t lie it on to me,&rdquo; interrupted Bud,
  scornfully. &ldquo;You know you said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll jest aboot make the
  boss weep if we waddle in with a couple of turks.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It just has done that,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, wait till Jeff roasts these young birds!&rdquo; added Curly.
  &ldquo;Boy, yore mouth&rsquo;ll water so you&rsquo;ll swear you&rsquo;ve got
  dropsy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. Do I get to go along next time? Of course there&rsquo;s a lot
  of odd jobs around camp&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vociferously and in unison Curly and Bud gave remarkable evidence of their
  regret and how they would make amends that very day.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>It turned out that Jim would not leave Molly. Her brother was in agony
  most of the time, with fever threatening, and not until late did he grow
  easier. They were all concerned about Slinger, except Curly, who said:
  &ldquo;Wal, the third day is the wust. From now on he&rsquo;ll mend
  fast.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Next morning, however, Jim routed Curly and Bud out so early that they
  could not see even a tree for half an hour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, wild turkeys is wild, shore, but they ain&rsquo;t
  owls,&rdquo; complained Bud.</p>

  <p>And Curly, loyal as always, vowed that Jim was not going to be permitted
  to shoot a turkey while still on the roost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s pot-huntin&rsquo;, boss, an&rsquo; not sporty
  atall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After eating that turkey drumstick last night, I&rsquo;d perpetrate
  any kind of a dark deed to get another,&rdquo; averred Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? Wal, now don&rsquo;t talk so much,
  an&rsquo; mebbe, if it ever gits daytime, we&rsquo;ll see a flock,&rdquo;
  rejoined Curly.</p>

  <p>Jim, therefore, kept his exuberant spirits under restraint. He noticed,
  however, that Bud and Curly talked right on as usual, and after a few moments
  he dryly mentioned the fact.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, you see, these heah turkeys air used to us cowboys
  ridin&rsquo; around in the woods,&rdquo; explained Curly. &ldquo;They know
  our voices.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Daylight came, with rosy color and nipping air, with frost like diamonds
  on the gramma grass, and so quiet that a falling aspen leaf rustled loudly.
  Evidently they had come up to the head of the park, for they crossed a brook
  and passed a tumble-down log cabin, where Hack Jocelyn had elected to hide
  with Molly and wait for the ransom. Curly remarked about how the plans of
  crooked men went wrong more often than right.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Flick ought to ride in today,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;He might be
  cute enough to savvy the way the deal has turned out an&rsquo; skedaddle with
  the money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;&rdquo; began Jim, when he got a prod
  from Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Shet up, you elocuteners!
  Turkey!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim heard the well-known gobble of a turkey, and it certainly resembled
  that of a tame turkey at home. Bud led the way over a rise of ground, under
  green and gold aspens, into an open glade, wildly closed at its upper end by
  a confusion of maples, oak, and pines. There were logs on the ground, and one
  huge pine across them. Something crashed ahead through the brush, snapping
  twigs. Then came a rap of bone on wood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Elk. Never mind him,&rdquo; whispered Bud. &ldquo;<i>There!</i> A
  big gobbler&mdash;lookin&rsquo; at us.&rdquo; He forced his rifle into
  Jim&rsquo;s eager hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where? ... That thing? It&rsquo;s a stump.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take a chanct, boss,&rdquo; said Curly, with a chuckle. &ldquo;If
  it&rsquo;s a stump it ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to run. An&rsquo; if
  it&rsquo;s a turkey, keep on shootin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aim low an&rsquo; be quick,&rdquo; added Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I tell you that thing is a black stump,&rdquo; remonstrated
  Jim, always and forever looking for tricks from these boys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Honest to Gawd, boss, it&rsquo;s a turk,&rdquo; appealed Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, to please you. But <i>I</i> know it&rsquo;s a stump. I can
  see,&rdquo; replied Jim, and he leveled the rifle and fired. To his utter
  consternation the motionless stump turned into the most magnificent bird he
  had ever seen. It ran swift as a deer. It thumped the ground. It was black
  and bronze, with a wonderful speckled tail, like an immense fan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stump, huh? Why didn&rsquo;t you peg him while he was
  runnin&rsquo;?&rdquo; queried Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh! I forgot I had a gun. What a sight! Say, that wasn&rsquo;t a
  turkey, but an ostrich!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, it was shore a rotten shot,&rdquo; said Curly. &ldquo;But he
  didn&rsquo;t scare the flock.... See them scratchin&rsquo; over
  heah&mdash;under the jackpines?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim did see them and grew wildly excited. It was an enormous flock, some
  of which exhibited signs of nervousness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Duck now, an&rsquo; crawl after me,&rdquo; whispered Bud, getting
  down on his knees. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve seen or heerd us, but we&rsquo;ll get
  a shot if we&rsquo;re smart.... Now, boss, don&rsquo;t crawl like a elephant
  with a broken laig.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim did not see anything but grass and leaves, the ground, logs, and tree
  trunks for several strenuous moments. But he heard turkeys gobble, and then,
  close at hand: put-put, put-put-put.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; swore Bud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the hens thet bust
  up everythin&rsquo;.... O Lord! hyar they come.... Now stand up an&rsquo;
  shoot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim got to his feet and certain was it that he shook. The great black and
  bronze gobblers, the sleek, smaller, less conspicuous hens, were coming under
  the scrub pines, out into the open. They no longer resembled tame turkeys.
  The huge-breasted gobblers, with their long beards, their stately nodding
  walk, suddenly halted. Jim picked out one that looked as high as a church and
  pulled the trigger.</p>

  <p>Then ensued a terrible crashing, buffeting, roaring <i>mêlée</i>. The
  turkeys burst into united action. A dozen or more launched themselves
  marvelously into the air, and flew as swiftly as quail, only with tremendous
  flapping of wings, right at Jim. But most of the flock ran. Jim shot at this
  one and that one. He could not get the bead on them. How they ran! Curly was
  yelling and shooting. Bud was shooting and yelling. Turkeys darted right
  between them, here, there, everywhere. Jim kept working the lever of the
  rifle, aiming and firing. Then the uproar ceased. Jim stood holding a hot
  rifle, looking bewildered, while his two companions held their sides.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone!&rdquo; gasped Curly, as soon as he could speak.
  &ldquo;They shore stampeded us. Boss, aboot how many did you
  knock?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gosh! I never touched a feather, that I could see. Oh, it was
  wonderful! ... But why in the dickens didn&rsquo;t you prepare me for such a
  charge?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I know turkeys orful well, but I didn&rsquo;t hev this bunch
  figgered,&rdquo; said Bud. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you plug one?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head sorrowfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as bum a
  hunter&mdash;as&mdash;as everything else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How many times did you shoot?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.... The gun&rsquo;s empty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! So &rsquo;tis. It had ten shells in the magazine, one in
  the barrel. Countin&rsquo; thet stump thet wus a turkey, you&rsquo;ve shot
  eleven times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Lord! I must have. But didn&rsquo;t you boys shoot a lot,
  too?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I picked out a buster an&rsquo; lambasted him,&rdquo; replied Bud,
  laconically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I shore hated to break in on you,&rdquo; added Curly.
  &ldquo;But I seen you was shootin&rsquo; over their haids an&rsquo; between
  their laigs, so I jest had to pulverize one fer supper. You ought to hev
  heahed him hit the ground. Sounded like a bull.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bud walked across logs and grass and picked up a beautiful hen turkey.
  Curly went somewhat farther in the opposite direction and picked up a gobbler
  that dragged head and wings on the ground. Both cowboys returned with much
  pride and sang-froid, to lay their quarry at Jim&rsquo;s feet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Plumb center, mine,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, I always hit turkeys in the neck,&rdquo; said Curly.
  &ldquo;You see thet shot doesn&rsquo;t spoil any meat. I always pick out a
  turk either runnin&rsquo; towards me or away from me, straight. You
  cain&rsquo;t hit one of them runnin&rsquo; crossways or even
  quarterin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was a great shot, Curly,&rdquo; replied Jim, admiringly. The big
  gobbler was a rare specimen of the finest game bird, glistening, purple and
  black, bronze-flecked and white, with plenty of red-brown. And
  heavy&mdash;Jim could hardly lift him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boss, your shootin&rsquo; can be improved on a little,&rdquo; said
  Curly, seriously. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;d got holed up by the Cibeque bunch, as
  might have happened, or by thet Hash Knife outfit, which is shore goin&rsquo;
  to come off an&rsquo; be wuss, wal, I&rsquo;d hate to have my life
  dependin&rsquo; on you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So would I, Curly,&rdquo; replied Jim, very sober and
  self-accusing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, let&rsquo;s mozey back to camp. You practice all day,
  shootin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll try again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Upon returning to camp the excitement of the hunt was dispelled by an
  astonishing fact. Boyd Flick had ridden into camp with the ransom money,
  which he was glad indeed to get rid of, and he and the other three members of
  the Cibeque were packing to leave.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Traft, it wasn&rsquo;t no deal of mine,&rdquo; said Flick, frankly.
  &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t need to tell you thet. Jocelyn had us all buffaloed.
  I&rsquo;m glad Slinger croaked him an&rsquo; thet the Cibeque is done
  fer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They had breakfast with Jim&rsquo;s party, bade them and Slinger good-by,
  and rode away into the forest, manifestly glad to get off so easily with
  whole skins.</p>

  <p>Some time after they had gone and camp life had resumed normality, Molly
  called Jim, &ldquo;You come heah.&rdquo; She led him around the cabin, out of
  sight of the others. Jim&rsquo;s instant perturbation subsided when he saw
  that she was smiling, though her gold-black eyes were full of fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The sons-of-guns! Devils!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Curly an&rsquo; Bud. All of the bunch. Listen heah. I happened to
  be near when Bud an&rsquo; Curly got Lonestar an&rsquo; Cherry behind the
  corner of the cabin there. I could tell they were up to some mischief, so I
  listened. Heah&rsquo;s what Bud said: &lsquo;Fellars, it&rsquo;s so darn good
  I near bust waitin&rsquo; a chanct to tell you. Me an&rsquo; Curly took Jim
  huntin&rsquo;&rsquo; (they always call you Jim behind your back, an&rsquo; I
  shore like thet), &lsquo;an&rsquo; soon&rsquo;s it got daylight we seen a
  gobbler as big as a hill. Jim swore it was a stump. But we made him shoot.
  Laws! he was funny when thet stump ran off like a wild steer. We located the
  flock an&rsquo; sneaked up on them. Say, it couldn&rsquo;t hev worked out any
  better if we&rsquo;d had a deal with them gobblers. They got skeered
  an&rsquo; come at us. I said to Jim, stand up an&rsquo; shoot. He did
  an&rsquo; then hell busted loose. Me an&rsquo; Curly turned loose our
  artillery an&rsquo; let go all we had. I even took a peg with my six-gun.
  Neither of us so much as winged one of them turks. But Jim killed
  two&mdash;them we fetched in. Thet gobbler will weigh thirty-five pounds.
  Only we seen pronto thet Jim reckoned he&rsquo;d missed. Never touched a
  feather, he said, an&rsquo; was shore down in the mouth. Curly gives me the
  wink, an&rsquo; so we hands Jim a deal. Curly an&rsquo; me only shot one
  each, an&rsquo; as a matter of course downed a turk. Curly enlarged on how he
  always picked one out comin&rsquo; or goin&rsquo; straight, an&rsquo; shot
  him in the neck. Kin you beat thet, boys? My Gawd! ... Wal, Jim swallered the
  whole deal. He was shore nice aboot it, an&rsquo; grateful to me an&rsquo;
  Curly, an&rsquo; as humble as pie.... My land! nuthin&rsquo; we ever did
  tickled us so much!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly paused a moment breathlessly, her eyes alight. &ldquo;An&rsquo; Jim,
  the devils doubled up like poisoned coyotes, an&rsquo; howled, an&rsquo;
  yowled, an&rsquo; rolled over on the ground.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim surely wanted to howl and yowl himself, but he limited himself to
  jumping up and down in mingled rage and mirth. Then he vented it in all the
  language he dared use before Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they maddenin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;But,
  Jim, they&rsquo;re strong for you, an&rsquo; I cain&rsquo;t help lovin&rsquo;
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Neither can I, only, Molly, I&rsquo;ve got to have revenge for
  that&mdash;or die,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll help you. Heah&rsquo;s an idea, Jim.
  These two boys cain&rsquo;t hunt wild turkeys. They don&rsquo;t know the
  least bit aboot it. Now I do. Slinger taught me. I could call turkeys before
  I was ten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Call? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can call them right up to you, so you can knock them over with a
  stick, almost. I&rsquo;ve done it a thousand times.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But <i>how</i> do you call them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With a turkey-caller. We make that out of a wing bone. But I can
  call with a hollow weed, too. I&rsquo;ll show you an&rsquo; teach you.
  Heah&rsquo;s my plan. You tell Curly an&rsquo; Bud you think they&rsquo;re
  not so good, after all, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; with me to kill a
  few turkeys. Then we&rsquo;ll go, several mawnin&rsquo;s an&rsquo;
  evenin&rsquo;s, too. I like sundown best. We&rsquo;ll fetch turkeys in.
  An&rsquo; after we get a dozen or so you can say to Curly an&rsquo; Bud:
  &lsquo;Boys, I quit huntin&rsquo; with you,&rsquo;cause when I killed turkeys
  you lied an&rsquo; swore you did it. That mawnin&rsquo; when you claimed the
  big gobbler an&rsquo; hen&mdash;all the time I knew. <i>All</i> the time I
  was shore of your low-down trick!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great! Wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed Jim, beside himself with the joy
  of such a double prospect. &ldquo;Molly, darling, run or I&rsquo;ll hug you
  right here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She ran, laughing over her shoulder.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Jim dryly remarked to the cowboys that he guessed he
  would not hunt with them any more, they looked nonplused and then blank. And
  he realized that if Molly could live up to her part of the program, he would
  crush the tricksters forever.</p>

  <p>That morning, too, Dunn showed a decided turn for the better, and Jim,
  losing all his misgivings, was happy for Molly. She loved this backwoods
  brother and had faith in him. Jim generously waived the ambush on the trail
  and the rooster trick to which Slinger had treated him, and vowed he would
  share Molly&rsquo;s faith. Long before that he had decided to reward Slinger
  for saving his life.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the camp grew merry, with only one drawback now, and
  that was the failure of Hump Stevens and Uphill Frost to arrive. Jim grasped
  that the cowboys were concealing anxiety from him, if not more. To his
  queries, Curly made evasive answers. But there was a cloud in the
  cowboy&rsquo;s flashing blue eyes, and Jim read its portent. He decided to
  send Jackson Way and Cherry Winters to Tobe&rsquo;s Well to ascertain if the
  missing cowboys were there. If they would only come in, or if news arrived
  that they were safe, Jim felt that he would be happy, and could even face
  that grim old Westerner who had entrusted him with such responsibility.</p>

  <p>There were only two rifles in camp and they belonged to Curly and Bud.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You boys don&rsquo;t need to go hunting, anyway,&rdquo; said Jim,
  as he appropriated the rifles and all the shells in sight. &ldquo;Considering
  how many thousand turkeys you&rsquo;ve killed, Bud, and how many you, Curly,
  have shot through the neck, running at you, there certainly shouldn&rsquo;t
  be any excitement left in it for you. So just think of <i>me</i>, going out
  with Molly, after wild turkeys!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That last thrust was almost revenge enough, Jim thought. Still, after a
  moment&rsquo;s recall of past suffering, he steeled his heart. Supper was had
  at four o&rsquo;clock, after which he started off with Molly, scarcely able
  to to contain himself. And after he got out of sight of camp he no longer
  did.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, are we goin&rsquo; huntin&rsquo; or makin&rsquo; love?&rdquo;
  queried Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we do both?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. If you keep on huggin&rsquo; me an&rsquo; kissin&rsquo; my
  ear&mdash;how am I to heah turkeys, let alone call them? ... If you
  <i>must</i> make love, let&rsquo;s set right down under this spruce an&rsquo;
  do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly Dunn!&rdquo; cried Jim, in the throes of temptation he
  knew he must resist. How bewildering she was! Her simplicity sometimes
  stunned him. He divined that his reward would be infinitely greater if he let
  her take her own time to respond to him.</p>

  <p>They climbed a slope, scaring squirrels, rabbits, and deer on the way, and
  came out on top of a ridge where the forest made Jim ache with its wildness
  and beauty. Towering yellow pines and stately silver spruces lorded it over
  the green-gold aspens and the scarlet maples. The ground was soft with pine
  needles and moss and decaying wood. Everywhere lay logs and windfalls, which
  had to be climbed over or avoided. The setting sun lent a glamour to the dry,
  sweet wilderness. Here were thickets of young pine, impossible to penetrate,
  and there was a long shade-barred aisle down the forest. They came to an open
  oak glade, and here Molly pointed to turkey scratches on the ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fresh tracks. They&rsquo;re after acorns. Now, Jim, when we see
  turkeys, you shoot pronto,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Jim&rsquo;s four months in the West had been productive of numberless
  experiences, of late merging upon breath-arresting agitation, but he counted
  high among them this slipping through the forest, close at the stealthy heels
  of little Molly Dunn. She was a wood-mouse, as Slinger called her. Not the
  slightest sound did she make. When Jim cracked a twig or brushed against a
  bush she admonished him with finger to her red lips and a dark disapproving
  glance. Then when Jim nearly fell over a log, she whispered, &ldquo;You big
  clodhopper!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, despite his awkwardness, she led him within sixty yards of a
  flock of turkeys that appeared to Jim to cover a half-acre in extent. They
  were of all sizes, from that of a large chicken to gobblers as large round as
  a barrel.</p>

  <p>Molly cocked her rifle. &ldquo;Get ready, Mizzourie. When I count
  three&mdash;shoot. But only once.... Ready.
  One&mdash;two&mdash;<i>three</i>!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Both rifles cracked in unison. Jim seemed deafened by the crash of wings.
  The gobbler he had fired at bounced straight up, ten feet, and went lumbering
  through the woods, hard put to it to get into flight&mdash;then he flew as
  fast as the bullet that had missed him. When he disappeared Jim sought the
  others. Gone! And also the uproar had ceased. Far off he heard heavy wings
  crash through foliage. In the middle of the glade lay a dead turkey, feathers
  ruffled. Jim hurried to fetch it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Two-year-old,&rdquo; said Molly, as she surveyed the fine young
  gobbler. &ldquo;Jim, that flock&rsquo;s made up of old birds, hens, a lot of
  two-year-olds an&rsquo; yearlin&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;re shore lucky. Now come
  heah.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She led him to a log just on the edge of the glade. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll set
  down heah, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll call.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A few thin bushes partially screened them from the glade. Molly sat down
  beside Jim, and slipping a hand under his arm leaned her head on his
  shoulder. &ldquo;Oh, but this&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be fun. I&rsquo;m just
  tickled. We&rsquo;ll shore make Bud an&rsquo; Curly crawl. Now, Jim, the way
  to do is to wait a little. Listen! ... There. That&rsquo;s a hen
  squawkin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a yearlin&rsquo;
  yelpin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim not only heard these clear sounds out in the forest, but a deep
  gobble-gobble, farther away. He agreed with Molly about the fun of it; and
  whatever else it might be to her it was absolute bliss for him to have her so
  close, to feel her hand squeeze his arm, her head against his shoulder, her
  hair touching his cheek. And only a half year back he had been at odds with
  life!</p>

  <p>Molly produced a short thing that looked like a quill to Jim, but which,
  upon examination, proved to be the small wing bone of a turkey, with a hole
  through its length.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, now, you boss of the Diamond,&rdquo; she whispered, gayly.
  &ldquo;First I&rsquo;ll call the yearlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sitting up, she put the bone in her mouth, keeping the other end partly
  covered in the hollow of her hand. Then she sucked air through it, and the
  result was a perfect imitation of the yelp of the young turkey. It was
  answered immediately, not once but several times, and each reply sounded
  nearer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s shore comin&rsquo;. Now I&rsquo;ll call that fussy hen
  out there.&rdquo; And she produced a high-pitched, prolonged squawk, likewise
  a perfect counterfeit. Answers came from all sides, one of which was a deep
  gobble.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get your gun ready, Jim. Shoot restin&rsquo; on your knee. Take
  lots of time. It&rsquo;s murder, shore, but we have to eat.... Look!
  There&rsquo;s the yearlin&rsquo;. But don&rsquo;t shoot him.... Look! Over
  heah! A whole bunch&mdash;mixed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cluck-cluck, put-put, all around him! Then he saw turkeys coming on a run,
  from this side and that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Heah&rsquo;s the gobbler. Knock him, Jim,&rdquo; whispered Molly,
  as she leaned back away from him. &ldquo;Wait till he stops. An&rsquo; after
  you shoot look sharp, you may get a crack at another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The gobbler entered the glade, stalked out majestically, and suddenly
  stood motionless, head up, not forty feet from where Jim sat. He scarcely had
  to move the rifle. Even as he aimed carefully, quivering as he put pressure
  on the trigger, he could not help seeing the glossy beauty and superb
  wildness of that giant bird. He shot, and the turkey appeared to pile up with
  a great feathery roar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; whispered Molly, pointing. &ldquo;Knock this young
  gobbler. Heah. He&rsquo;s crazy, standin&rsquo; still there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim located this one and killed it. The others had vanished.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Drag in the game, Mizzourie,&rdquo; directed Molly.</p>

  <p>Hurrying to comply, Jim lifted the smaller turkey, and then lay hold of
  the giant gobbler. It was huge, and so heavy that indeed he did have to
  drag.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do so bad, then,&rdquo; said Molly, when he
  returned. &ldquo;That big gobbler is an old bird. We don&rsquo;t often fool
  one like him. Set down now, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll call again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Molly, surely you can&rsquo;t call them up again?&rdquo;
  queried Jim, in amaze.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cain&rsquo;t I? The show&rsquo;s just begun. Arch an&rsquo; I used
  to call half a day on a big mixed flock like this. But I reckon no more old
  gobblers will come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In excitement just as tingling as before Jim listened, and heard, and
  watched, under precisely the same thrilling circumstances. Molly called to
  the turkeys and whispered to him. No doubt his delight was infectious.
  Presently a string of yearling turkeys came cluck-clucking into the grove,
  and Jim, out of three shots, got two.</p>

  <p>Then again Molly began to call, and confining herself to the yelp of the
  yearling, she gave it a wailing note. Answers came from near and far, closer
  and closer. But it was long before Molly lifted a hand to indicate she had
  espied one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been callin&rsquo; too fast an&rsquo; often,&rdquo; she
  explained to Jim. &ldquo;But I was shore so anxious to have you heah
  an&rsquo; see them. We&rsquo;ll wait a little.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It turned out she did not need to call again, for a fine hen turkey
  followed on the heels of a yearling into the glade. Yet they did not come
  close. Put-put. Put-put-put. Jim made a capital shot on the suspicious hen,
  but missed the yearling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be aboot all we can pack to camp,&rdquo; said Molly.
  &ldquo;Heah&rsquo;s a string. We&rsquo;ll tie their feet together an&rsquo;
  run a stout pole through.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a load! Gee! but won&rsquo;t Bud an&rsquo; Curly be sick? ...
  Molly, this has been just glorious. I always loved to hunt. But there was
  never any game except rabbits and squirrels, and sometimes a partridge. And
  to think&mdash;all this grand sport with <i>you</i>, Molly!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, Jim. Shore I never felt so good aboot huntin&rsquo;
  before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you mind kissing me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, you put such store on my kisses,&rdquo; she replied,
  wistfully. &ldquo;I reckon they&rsquo;re not&mdash;not so precious as you
  imagine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, they are, Molly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you once&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d been kissed a lot,&rdquo;
  she went on, shamefaced, yet brave. &ldquo;Not that I was willin&rsquo;... .
  An&rsquo; now I know what love is I&mdash;I wish my lips had been for you
  alone, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Molly. You were a child. That you can feel as you do now is
  enough for me, regarding the past. You are a dear, good girl, and I
  couldn&rsquo;t begin to tell you how I love and respect you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She kissed him, then, absorbed with the seriousness of it, rather than the
  sweetness of surrender.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll let myself go, pronto, an&rsquo; eat you
  up,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>Resting often, they packed the string of turkeys down through the forest,
  across the park, into camp. Somebody whooped, and there stood Bud and Curly,
  transfixed and staring. Neither came out of his trance until Jim and Molly
  halted under the cabin shed, breathing fast, and glad to lay down their
  burden.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; ejaculated Bud, which speech,
  considering his proclivity for profanity, merely attested to his mental
  aberration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I heah you boys talkin&rsquo; aboot how Jim
  couldn&rsquo;t hit the side of a barn?&rdquo; inquired Molly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon you might of&mdash;sumthin&rsquo; like,&rdquo;
  replied Curly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a daid-center shot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. So it &rsquo;pears. But what you mean? At gurls&rsquo; hearts
  or turkeys?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon both,&rdquo; replied Molly, and she fled.</p>

  <p>Much was made of the turkey-hunt at supper-time. It appeared apropos
  inasmuch as the meal consisted of roast turkey, gravy, and mashed potatoes.
  Jim was really concerned over the gastronomic feats of the cowboys,
  especially of Bud and Curly. And the result of talk and supper was to inspire
  the two cowboys to get up before daylight to hunt for more wild turkeys.
  Molly and Jim left an hour after that, and returned with three fine birds
  before Curly and Bud got back. At length when they arrived, tired from much
  climbing on foot&mdash;which certainly was not their
  forte&mdash;empty-handed, with all kinds of excuses that implicated each
  other, they were allowed to talk some before being shown what Jim had bagged.
  Presently Jim directed their attention to the three fine gobblers hanging in
  bronze and purple splendor on the cabin wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dog-gone!&rdquo; said Bud, sagging.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Huh! Turkeys walked right in camp, so you could knock them over
  with a club?&rdquo; queried Curly, snorting fire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nope. I went out for half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This heah mawnin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, after you left. You&rsquo;ll observe they are all shot high up
  in the neck. I got them coming and going. Straight, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Curly let out a feeble groan. Bud had submitted abjectly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Boys, I hope this will be a lesson to you,&rdquo; went on Jim,
  eloquently, impressive before all the listeners. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go out
  with an old hunter, and when he kills birds claim you did it. And brag about
  your prowess!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, was you onto us&mdash;aboot them two turks, the other
  mawnin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Curly, in misery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve long known of your perfidy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw! Aw!&rdquo; yelled Curly, in pain. &ldquo;Bud, this heah is too
  much. Jim has dun fer us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; ripped out his partner in shame, &ldquo;but we can lay
  it to the root of all sorrow fer cowboys&mdash;a gurl!&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

  <p>On the following day Slinger Dunn had improved so materially that Jim
  began to hope it would be safe to move him at the end of another week,
  perhaps sooner. That forced him to consider the coming situation. Mrs. Dunn
  had been sent word by Boyd Flick that Molly was safe, and her brother mending
  favorably. Jim began to incline to a plan to take Molly also into town. The
  very good excuse of a wounded brother would suffice. How about the
  Flagerstown feminine contingent when they scented this romance? Jim indulged
  in a gleeful laugh. Uncle Jim might be destined to have his heartfelt desire
  fulfilled long before he anticipated any hope of it. But Molly was so
  young&mdash;only sixteen!</p>

  <p>Another more perturbing question, for the moment, was the continued
  failure of Hump and Uphill to appear. Probably they would show up soon with
  Jack and Cherry. Jim dismissed that, too, as something to be combated another
  and perhaps more favorable day.</p>

  <p>Early in the afternoon he slipped off alone with one of the requisitioned
  rifles, but not to hunt. He wished to have a long, lonely walk in the forest.
  It turned out, however, that he did not go far, hardly out of range of
  Jeff&rsquo;s ringing ax on a dead aspen log.</p>

  <p>He took a peep into the old log cabin where Hack Jocelyn had planned to
  hide Molly. It was full of debris, leaves, pine cones, woodmice, and insects.
  The place showed evidence of having once been lived in by human creatures.
  What had happened there? Perhaps once the very thing Jocelyn had wanted! Jim
  felt a haunting story in that lonely cabin.</p>

  <p>Then he followed the draw, up under the spreading silver branches, to a
  spot where he simply had to stop. Frost had turned the aspens gold. The
  wondrous hue blazed against sky and forest. All the tranquil little glade
  appeared to have absorbed light from the aspen leaves, that quivered so
  delicately and silently, each separate one fluttering like a golden moth.</p>

  <p>Jim sat down and gloated over these quaking aspens, and the towering pines
  and spruces. A hawk sailed across the blue opening above. A dreamy hum
  pervaded the forest. He did not wonder at a backwoodsman. Here was strange,
  full, strength-giving life. Molly Dunn seemed a composite of all that he saw
  and felt there.</p>

  <p>Deep in his soul, now that he had time and place to face it, he thanked
  the God of chance, and the higher divinity to whom all events were
  subservient, for her love and her promise. The West had dealt harshly with
  him, yet made greater amends. He had served his apprenticeship under these
  fire-spirited cowboys; and he sensed more and yet more hardships, problems,
  pangs, of that elemental range life.</p>

  <p>He had had his eye teeth cut. In the future he might hide his stern
  acceptance of labor and duty under a guise such as that of Curly Prentiss, if
  he could aspire to this prince of cowboys&rsquo; mask. But recklessness and
  boyish desire for adventure for adventure&rsquo;s sake, carelessness and loss
  of temper, deliberate seeking of trouble&mdash;all these must not only be
  suppressed, but done away with. His responsibility had quadrupled.</p>

  <p>Jim wrought over his many failings like a blacksmith hammering malleable
  iron. If he must build drift fences, he would do well to add something of
  Slinger Dunn to his conception of Curly Prentiss, in his intelligent
  acceptance of that which made a Westerner.</p>

  <p>That was the clearest of his many hours of self-teaching.</p>

  <p>Late afternoon found Jim descending the slope toward camp. He espied a
  curling column of blue smoke after he had smelled a camp fire. Saddle-horses
  in camp, grazing with dragging bridles! He quickened his pace. Probably the
  cowboys had returned. He made sure of this when he saw Cherry&rsquo;s pinto
  horse hobbling up the park.</p>

  <p>Approaching from behind the cabin, he could not see anyone until he turned
  the corner. But he had heard a merry voice and a deep laugh. There outside
  the cabin on a bench sat his uncle, holding Molly&rsquo;s hand. Jim was
  thunderstruck.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle! ... Where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo; he exploded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, son! I rode in with Locke a while ago,&rdquo; replied Traft,
  his keen eyes sweeping Jim from head to toe. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been
  lonesome, as you see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do see,&rdquo; replied Jim, and he could have shouted to the
  skies the good of what he saw. Molly did not look as if she wanted to run
  from Uncle Jim. A blush slowly rose under tear-stained cheeks.</p>

  <p>Traft exposed the back of Molly&rsquo;s little supple brown hand, on a
  finger of which the diamond sparkled, as if in gay and treacherous
  betrayal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Son, I see you&rsquo;ve been goin&rsquo; in debt for
  diamonds,&rdquo; drawled Traft.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One. Has Molly&mdash;told you?&rdquo; replied Jim, and it was his
  turn to blush.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, she only said <i>you</i> gave it to her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Molly gently disengaged her hand. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me
  I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll run back to Arch,&rdquo; she said, shyly, and fled.</p>

  <p>Traft looked up at Jim. &ldquo;You pie-eatin&rsquo;, soft-spoken,
  hard-fisted Mizzourie son-of-a-gun!&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; returned Jim, hopefully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doc Shields told me first of these doin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; went on the
  rancher. &ldquo;So Locke an&rsquo; I hooked up the buckboard an&rsquo;
  dragged a couple of saddle-horses along. We left the team at Keech&rsquo;s
  where ... but that&rsquo;ll wait. Curly told me the whole business. So did
  Bud. I had a little talk with Slinger. An&rsquo; then I got hold of Molly...
  . Jim, you&rsquo;ve done it. Winnin&rsquo; the Diamond was a real job, but
  nothin&rsquo; to that girl. It took me a minute to fall in love with her
  myself, an&rsquo; a whole hour to get the story out of her. Son, she&rsquo;s
  real Western stuff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m awful glad you like her&mdash;Uncle Jim,&rdquo;
  said Jim, and weak in the knees, he sat down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So much for that. We can come back to it later.... I&rsquo;ve got
  tough news for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle, I can stand anything now,&rdquo; replied Jim, and indeed
  felt that he could.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hump Stevens is at Keech&rsquo;s, all shot up, but I reckon not so
  bad as Slinger,&rdquo; went on Traft. &ldquo;I had him hauled to Flag. Up
  Frost got to town night before last, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s crippled. The darn
  fool reported to me before he went to a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m more relieved than surprised. I was worried. Who shot
  them, uncle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up told me he an&rsquo; Hump run plumb into some of the Hash Knife
  outfit, cuttin&rsquo; your drift fence, an&rsquo; there was a bit of a fight.
  Hump thinks he killed one of the gang. There was five of them, an&rsquo; they
  rode off with one hangin&rsquo; across a saddle. Then Up packed Hump across
  to Keech&rsquo;s an&rsquo; come on in to town.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hash Knife outfit!&rdquo; ejaculated Jim, thoughtfully. &ldquo;The
  boys used to argue. Curly always said: &lsquo;Wait till the Cibeque falls
  down on the job. Then see!&rsquo; ... Uncle, who and what is this Hash Knife
  outfit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! They&rsquo;re a heap, son. The Hash Knife used to be the
  king-pin cow outfit of central Arizona. That was twenty years ago. Now,
  it&rsquo;s got the Cibeque beat to a frazzle for hard-nut hombres,
  exceptin&rsquo; Slinger. Old-timer named Jed Stone runnin&rsquo; the Hash
  Knife. He used to ride for me, years ago. Killed one of the best foremen I
  ever had. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d hate to say how many men he&rsquo;s shot since.
  ... Wal, Jed an&rsquo; his bunch haven&rsquo;t any boss or ranch, or even a
  homestead. They ride from camp to camp, like Injuns, an&rsquo; believe me
  they eat more beef than this Cibeque outfit stole.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Their own beef or somebody else&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Jim,
  gruffly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haw! Haw! I&rsquo;ll tell that one on you, if I get hard up....
  Jim, listen to the worst! The last nine miles of your drift fence is down.
  An&rsquo; some of the aspen trees are fresh decorated with Jed&rsquo;s
  trade-mark, a plain old hash-knife cut in deep.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, the nerve of him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jim, that outfit drinks six cups of coffee a meal, to keep their
  nerve quiet, Jed bragged to me once.... Now you&rsquo;re up against a far
  worse crowd than the Cibeque. Old cowboys, gunmen, rustlers!&mdash;Wal,
  you&rsquo;ve still got up sixty miles or more of fence. An&rsquo;
  that&rsquo;ll have to do for this year. Fact is, I&rsquo;m more than
  satisfied. I&rsquo;m darn proud of you, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Uncle. But soon as I see what&rsquo;s to be done about
  Slinger and&mdash;and Molly, we&rsquo;ll go right back to
  fence-building.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No more till next spring, Jim. You don&rsquo;t savvy. That end of
  the Diamond is high, an&rsquo; this storm spelled winter. The cattle had
  drifted off before this snow came.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Snow!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. Two feet at Tobe&rsquo;s Well now, an&rsquo; deeper as you
  climb south. Tough luck, son, but don&rsquo;t ask too much. Mebbe Jed Stone
  will get his deserts this winter, though <i>that&rsquo;s</i> plumb too much
  to hope for.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw! I put such store on finishing our drift fence before the snow
  flies,&rdquo; exclaimed Jim, poignantly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was a dream, son. An&rsquo; Locke an&rsquo; I let you dream
  it.... Listen! I&rsquo;ve got an idee that may suit you, since Molly Dunn
  talked so hopefully about her brother. It seems <i>she</i> thinks you had
  good influence on Slinger. Wal, follow it up. If you can get Slinger Dunn
  into the Diamond&mdash;why, you&rsquo;ll have it all over the Hash
  Knife.&mdash;Son, it&rsquo;s turnin&rsquo; tricks like this that is genuine
  Western.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had that idea myself, Uncle! If I can only get him! Why, Molly
  would sing for joy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, then. Let&rsquo;s put our heads together. We&rsquo;ve
  got to take Slinger to town, an&rsquo; so we&rsquo;ll take Molly along. Then
  we&rsquo;ll send for her folks an&rsquo; keep them at the ranch. I
  wouldn&rsquo;t rush that kid into marryin&rsquo;, not before a year.
  She&rsquo;s backward, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;d be good for her to meet people,
  an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great! Uncle, you&rsquo;re just the finest ever!&rdquo; cried Jim,
  wildly fired with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Molly could go to school, or at least
  have private lessons, and what could not that bright girl learn in six
  months?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have some trouble talkin&rsquo; Slinger into it,
  mebbe,&rdquo; went on Traft. &ldquo;I sat talkin&rsquo; to him a little
  while. He&rsquo;s got one weakness shore, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s Molly.
  An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll gamble he has another&mdash;a ranch. Play these cards
  strong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ranch?&rdquo; queried Jim, eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore. I happen to own the Yellow Jacket. It&rsquo;s a big, wild
  range, run down, with only a few thousand head of stock. I took it over on
  notes of Blodgett&rsquo;s not long ago. Some rustlin&rsquo; down there.
  It&rsquo;s a fine winter range. Just the place for the Diamond this next six
  months. You talk up the Yellow Jacket to Dunn. Tell him you&rsquo;ll take him
  in with you as partner, or half shares, providin&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll throw in
  with the Diamond. That&rsquo;ll fetch him, unless you an&rsquo; Molly have
  him figured wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim got up trembling, and put a strong hand on Traft&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Jim! ... So this is one of the things that makes you a great
  Westerner? Oh, I&rsquo;ve heard a lot! ... I couldn&rsquo;t ask more in this
  world&mdash;than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But he choked over that utterance and rushed round the cabin to drop in
  upon Molly and Slinger. He was half sitting up and looked better, especially
  as one of the boys had shaved him, and his face had regained some of its
  clean tan. Jim swallowed hard and strove for calmness. He did not dare look
  at Molly, whose eyes he felt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Howdy, Slinger! You seem to be doing fine. I&rsquo;m sure glad. How
  about a little talk?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suits me, if you do the talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he replied.
  &ldquo;Molly is aboot talked out, an&rsquo; I never had nuthin&rsquo; to
  say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Whereupon Jim sat down next to Molly, and took time to settle himself
  comfortably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be riding you into Flag, pronto,&rdquo; began Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say, I don&rsquo;t hanker aboot thet. I&rsquo;d only meet up with
  Bray. An&rsquo; fact is, I&rsquo;ll be sorta sick fer a while.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bray won&rsquo;t get near you,&rdquo; went on Jim, warming to his
  subject. &ldquo;But Doc Shields will. We&rsquo;ll take Molly along an&rsquo;
  go right to Uncle Jim&rsquo;s ranch.&mdash;And send for your father and
  mother to come up.... You see, Slinger, it&rsquo;s this way. Molly and I will
  be getting married in a&mdash;a year or so&rdquo;&mdash;here a half-stifled
  gasp at his elbow disrupted him&mdash;&ldquo;and you know she&rsquo;s pretty
  much of a kid. We won&rsquo;t let her go back to the
  Cibeque&mdash;ever&mdash;except, of course, on visits&mdash;and you just
  ought to be where you can see her often.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I reckon I ought,&rdquo; agreed Dunn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine. I thought you&rsquo;d agree. Now, here&rsquo;s another angle.
  Do you happen to know the Yellow Jacket ranch?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shore do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What kind of a place is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, no ranch to brag aboot&mdash;only a cabin an&rsquo; corrals.
  But, Lord! what a range! Water an&rsquo; grass an&rsquo; timber!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim really needed no more than the light of Slinger&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle has turned it over to me, lock, stock, and barrel,&rdquo;
  laughed Jim. &ldquo;Only three thousand head of cattle. But great
  possibilities for development.... Now, Slinger, I want you to go in with
  me&mdash;be my partner in making a big ranch out of the Yellow
  Jacket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dunn grew quite red in the face for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Molly, is this heah fellar of yours drunk or crazy?&rdquo; he
  asked, turning to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t quite know&mdash;Arch,&rdquo; she faltered.
  &ldquo;But I reckon you can trust him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim had further impetus to his enthusiasm. A small trembling hand slipped
  into his and clung.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sure there&rsquo;s a string to the offer, Slinger. There always
  is&mdash;in business deals. Sure it&rsquo;s a big chance for you&mdash;not to
  say how wonderful for Molly. But I&rsquo;m quite selfish in the matter.
  You&rsquo;re more than worth the deal to me, provided, of course, you agree
  to my terms.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jim felt another pressing little hand stealing up around him, over his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahuh. An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s them terms, Jim Traft?&rdquo; queried
  Dunn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know Jed Stone?&rdquo; counter-queried Jim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shore ought to. Jed an&rsquo; me drawed on each other aboot a
  year ago. Reckon we was so durn scared we missed. But we hevn&rsquo;t met
  since.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know his Hash Knife outfit?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better&rsquo;n anyone who rides the Diamond.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it was Jed Stone and his outfit who cut the last nine miles
  of our fence. And he has cut his brand on the aspens. Next spring we&rsquo;ll
  go back on the job. Slinger, to complete that fence and keep it <i>up</i>, I
  need you. Savvy? Will you throw in with me and the Diamond?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gawd! Jest gimme the chanct!&rdquo; replied Dunn, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my hand. And with it is an end of the bad blood
  between us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Jim extended that hand he naturally released the little one that had
  clung tighter and tighter to his. Suddenly, while he came to grips with
  Slinger, and their eyes met in the understanding of men, this little hand
  flashed up before him to lock with the other one behind him. As he had reason
  to remember, these little members were strong, and now he had more proof of
  that. Moreover, Molly&rsquo;s arms were inseparable from them, and they
  twined and twined. &ldquo;<i>Mizzourie Jim!</i>&rdquo; she whispered. And
  between Jim and Slinger, while yet their hands gripped, intervened a pale
  little face, with wet eyes, dark in passionate gratitude, with red parted
  lips that came up and up and up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wal, Jim, I reckon thet&rsquo;ll be aboot all,&rdquo; said Slinger
  Dunn.</p>
