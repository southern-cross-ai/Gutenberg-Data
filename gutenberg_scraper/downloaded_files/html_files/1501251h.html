<h2><a name="ch00" id="ch00"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

<p>This, the last of twelve mystery stories written by the late
Annie Haynes--who died last year--was left unfinished. One of Miss
Haynes's friends, also a popular writer of this type of fiction,
offered to undertake the work of completion, and it says much for
her skill that she has independently arrived at Miss Haynes's own
solution of the mystery, which was known only to myself.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that for the last fifteen years of her
life Miss Haynes was in constant pain and writing itself was a
considerable effort. Her courage in facing her illness was
remarkable, and the fact that she was handicapped not only by the
pain but also by the helplessness of her malady greatly enhances
the merit of her achievements. It was impossible for her to go out
into the world for fresh material for her books, her only journeys
being from her bedroom to her study. The enforced inaction was the
harder to bear in her case, as before her illness she was extremely
energetic. Her intense interest in crime and criminal psychology
led her into the most varied activities, such as cycling miles to
visit the scene of the Luard Murder, pushing her way into the
cellar of 39 Hilldrop Crescent, where the remains of Belle Elmore
were discovered, and attending the Crippen trial.</p>

<p>It would be a dark and sombre picture if it were not mentioned
how this struggle with cruel circumstances was materially lightened
by the warmth of friendships existing between Miss Haynes and her
fellow authors and by the sympathetic and friendly relations
between her and her publishers.</p>

<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p>"My hat! Nan, I tell you it is the chance of a lifetime.
Battledore is a dead cert. Old Tim Ranger says he is the best colt
he ever had in his stable. Masterman gave a thousand guineas for
him as a yearling. He'd have won the Derby in a canter if he had
been entered."</p>

<p>"It is easy to say that when he wasn't, isn't it?" Anne
Courtenay smiled. "Don't put too much on, Harold. You can't afford
to lose, you know."</p>

<p>"Lose! I tell you I can't lose," her brother returned hotly. His
face was flushed, the hand that held his card was trembling.
"Battledore must win. My bottom dollar's on him. Minnie Medchester
has mortgaged her dress allowance for a year to back him. Oh,
Battledore's a wonder colt."</p>

<p>"What is a wonder colt--Battledore, I suppose?" a suave voice
interposed at this juncture. "Mind what you are doing, Harold. Best
hedge a bit. I hear Goldfoot is expected. Anyway, the stable is on
him for all it's worth."</p>

<p>"So is Ranger's on Battledore. Old Tim Ranger says it is all
over bar the shouting. Oh, Battledore's a cert. I have been telling
Anne to put every penny she can scrape together on him."</p>

<p>"I hope Miss Courtenay has not obeyed you," Robert Saunderson
said, his eyes, a little bloodshot though the day was still young,
fixed on Anne Courtenay's fair face. "It's all very well, young
man, but I have known so many of these hotpots come unstuck to put
much faith in even Tim Ranger's prophecies. I'd rather take a good
outsider. Backing a long shot generally pays in the long run."</p>

<p>"It won't when Battledore is favourite," Harold Courtenay
returned obstinately. "He ran away with the Gold Cup. It will be
the same."</p>

<p>"H'm! Well, you are too young to remember Lawgiver. He was just
such a Derby cert that he was guarded night and day and brought to
the tapes with detectives before and behind, but he sauntered in a
bad fifteenth."</p>

<p>"Battledore won't," young Courtenay said confidently. "Wait a
minute, Nan. There's young Ranger. I must have a word with him." He
darted off.</p>

<p>Robert Saunderson looked after him with a curious smile.
Saunderson was well known in racing circles and was usually present
at all the big meetings. He was sometimes spoken of as a mystery
man. Nobody knew exactly who he was or where he came from. But as a
rich bachelor he had made his way into a certain section of London
society. At the present moment he, as well as the Courtenays, was
staying at Holford Hall with the Courtenays' cousin, Lord
Medchester.</p>

<p>Rumour had of late credited Lady Medchester with a very kindly
feeling for Saunderson. Holford was within an easy driving distance
of Doncaster, and the house-party to a man had come over on Lord
Medchester's coach and a supplementary car to see the St. Leger
run. The Courtenays were the grandchildren of old General
Courtenay, who had held a high command in India and had been known
on the Afghan frontier as "Dare-devil Courtenay". His only son,
Harold and Anne's father, had been killed in the Great War. The
Victoria Cross had been awarded to him after his death, and was his
father's proudest possession. The young widow had not long survived
her husband, and the two orphan children had been brought up by
their grandfather.</p>

<p>The old man had spoilt and idolized them. The greatest
disappointment of his life had been Harold's breakdown in health
and resultant delicacy, which had put the Army out of the question.
General Courtenay was a poor man, having little but his pension,
and the difficulty had been to find some work within Harold's
powers. The Church, the Army and the Bar were all rejected in turn.
Young Courtenay had a pretty taste in literature and a certain
facility with his pen, and for a time he had picked up a precarious
living as a journalistic freelance. For the last year, however, he
had been acting as secretary to Francis Melton, the member for
North Loamshire.</p>

<p>Earlier in the year Anne Courtenay had become engaged to Michael
Burford, Lord Medchester's trainer. It was not the grand match she
had been expected to make, but Burford was sufficiently well off,
and the young couple were desperately in love.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the admiration in Saunderson's eyes as he
looked down at Anne.</p>

<p>"You could not persuade the General to come to-day?"</p>

<p>Anne shook her head.</p>

<p>"No; it would have been too much for him. But he is quite happy
talking over old times with his sister."</p>

<p>"He was a great race-goer in his day, he tells me."</p>

<p>"I believe he was an inveterate one. He still insists on having
all the racing news read to him."</p>

<p>Anne moved on decidedly as she spoke. She did not care for
Robert Saunderson. She had done her best to keep out of his way
since his coming to Holford. Unfortunately the dislike was not
mutual. Saunderson's admiration had been obvious from the first,
and her coldness apparently only inflamed his passion. He followed
her now.</p>

<p>"The Leger horses are in the paddock. What will Harold say if
you don't see Battledore?"</p>

<p>Anne quickened her steps. "I don't know. But we shall see them
all in a moment. And I must find my cousins."</p>

<p>Saunderson kept up with her, forcing their way through the
jostling crowd round the paddock.</p>

<p>"Lord Medchester's filly ran away with the nursery plate, I
hear. The favourite Severn Valley filly was not in it," he began;
then as she made no rejoinder he went on, "We shall see a
tremendous difference here in a year or two, Miss Courtenay. There
will be an aerodrome over there"--jerking his head to the
right--"second to none in the country, I will wager. And a big,
up-to-date tote will be installed near the stand. Altogether we
shan't know the Town Moor."</p>

<p>"I heard they were projecting all sorts of improvements," Anne
assented. "But it will take a long time to get them finished and
cost a great deal of money. Harold is frightfully keen on the tote,
I know."</p>

<p>"Ah, Harold!" Saunderson interposed. "I wanted to speak to you
about Harold. I am rather anxious about him. I don't like this
friendship of his with the Stainers. He ought never to have
introduced them to you. They've had the cheek to put up at the
'Medchester Arms'--want to get in touch with the training stables,
I'll bet! Stainer's no good--never has been--he is a rotter, and
the girl--well, the less said about her the better."</p>

<p>Anne recalled the red-haired girl who had seemed so friendly
with Harold just now, but she let no hint of the uneasiness she
felt show in her face.</p>

<p>"I am sure Harold does not care for her. Of course she is very
good-looking. But why do you trouble about Harold?"</p>

<p>Saunderson looked at her.</p>

<p>"Because he is your brother," he said deliberately.</p>

<p>Anne's eyes met his quietly.</p>

<p>"A very poor reason, it seems to me."</p>

<p>"Then suppose I say, because I love you, Anne?" he said
daringly.</p>

<p>Anne held up her head.</p>

<p>"I am engaged to Michael Burford."</p>

<p>"To Burford, the trainer!" Saunderson said scoffingly.</p>

<p>"No; to Burford, the man," she corrected.</p>

<p>A fierce light flashed into Saunderson's eyes. A whirl of sound
of cheering, of incoherent cries rose around them. The St. Leger
horses were coming up to the post.</p>

<p>"Battledore! Battledore!" Harold's choice was easily favourite.
Masterman's scarlet and green were very conspicuous. Under cover of
the tumult Saunderson bent nearer Anne.</p>

<p>"Michael Burford. Pah! You shall never marry him. You shall
marry me. I swear it."</p>

<p>Anne's colour rose, but she made no reply as she hurried back to
the Medchester coach. Most of the party were already in their
places, but Lady Medchester stood at the foot of the steps. She was
a tall, showily-dressed woman, whose complexion and hair evidently
owed a good deal to art. Her mouth was hard, and just now the thin
lips were pressed closely together.</p>

<p>"I hope you have enjoyed your walk and seeing Battledore," she
said disagreeably.</p>

<p>Anne looked at her.</p>

<p>"I did not see Battledore."</p>

<p>Lady Medchester laughed, but there was no merriment in her pale
eyes.</p>

<p>"I can quite understand that. Oh, Mr. Saunderson"--turning to
the man who had come up behind her young cousin--"will you show
me--"</p>

<p>Anne did not wait for any more. She ran lightly up the steps.
Her brother hurried after her.</p>

<p>"I believe one gets a better view from the top of this coach
than from the stand," he said unsteadily.</p>

<p>Anne looked at him with pity, at his flushed face, at his
trembling hands.</p>

<p>"Harold, if you--"</p>

<p>She had no time for more. Harold sprang on the seat. There was a
mighty shout. "They're off! They're off!" Then a groan of
disappointment as the horses were recalled. A false
start--Battledore had broken the tapes. Bill Turner, his Australian
jockey, quieted him down and brought him back to the post.</p>

<p>"Goldfoot was sweating all over in the paddock just now," young
Courtenay announced to nobody in particular. "He was all over the
place, too, taking it out of himself. Doesn't stand an earthly
against Battledore--he's a real natural stayer--isn't a son of
Sardinia, a Derby second and Greenlake the Oaks winner for
nothing--"</p>

<p>His voice was drowned by a great roar as the horses flashed by,
Battledore on the outside.</p>

<p>"Better than too near the rails," Harold consoled himself. "The
luck of the draw's been against him, but he doesn't want it. He'll
do, he'll do!"</p>

<p>"Battledore! Battledore!" the crowd exulted.</p>

<p>But now another name was making itself heard--"Goldfoot!
Goldfoot! Come on, Jim!"--"Goldfoot leads--No--Partner's
Pride!--No--Battledore!--Battledore!" Harold Courtenay yelled.
"Come on, Bill! He's winning, he's winning! Partner's Pride is
nothing but a runner-up."</p>

<p>Followed a moment's tense silence, then a mighty shout:
"Goldfoot's won! Well done, Jim Spencer! Well done!"</p>

<p>Anne dared not look at her brother's face as the numbers went
up.</p>

<p>"Goldfoot first," a voice beside her said. "Proud Boy second,
Partner's Pride third. Battledore nowhere."</p>

<p>Anne heard a faint sound beside her--between a moan and a sob.
She turned sharply.</p>

<p>"Harold!"</p>

<p>Her brother was leaning back in his seat on the coach. His hands
had dropped by his side, his face was ghastly white, even his lips
were bloodless.</p>

<p>Anne touched him. "Harold!"</p>

<p>He gazed at her with dazed, uncomprehending eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't look like that!" she said sharply. "Pull yourself
together! It will be all right, Harold. I have a savings box, you
know. You shall have it all."</p>

<p>"All!" Harold laughed aloud in a wild, reckless fashion that
made his sister wince and draw back hastily. "It means ruin, Anne!"
he said hoarsely. "Ruin, irretrievable ruin. That's all!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The Dowager Lady Medchester was an old lady who knew her own
mind, and was extremely generous in the matter of presenting pieces
of it to other people. She and her brother, General Courtenay, were
too much alike to get on really well together. Nevertheless, they
thoroughly enjoyed a sparring match, and looked forward to their
meetings in town and country. The house-party at Holford this year
was an extra and both of them were bent on making the most of
it.</p>

<p>This afternoon the old people were out for their daily drive,
and in the smallest of the three drawing-rooms Anne Courtenay and
her brother Harold stood facing one another, both of them pale and
overwrought.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course we must find the money. My pearls will fetch
something, and I can borrow--"</p>

<p>Anne was anxiously watching her brother's white, drawn face.</p>

<p>He turned away and stood with his back to her, staring
unseeingly out of the window.</p>

<p>"That isn't the worst. I--I had to have the money, you
understand? I was in debt. I put every penny I had on Battledore
and--more."</p>

<p>Anne stared at him, every drop of colour ebbing slowly from her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Harold? You put more--you are frightening
me."</p>

<p>"Can't you see? I stood to make my fortune out of Battledore. If
he'd won I should. I didn't think he could lose, and money of
Melton's was passing through my hands. I put it on."</p>

<p>"Harold!" Anne's brown eyes were wide with horror. "You--you
must put it back. I--I will get it somehow."</p>

<p>"I have put it back. I had to. I don't know whether Melton
suspected, but he talked of going through his accounts, and it had
to be paid into the bank." The boy's voice broke. "I went to a
money-lender and he lent me money on a bill that didn't mature till
next May. He wouldn't give it to me at first. I couldn't wait--the
money had to be replaced at once. The bill had to be backed--I knew
it was no use asking Medchester, and the money-lender wouldn't take
Stainer--else Maurice would have got it for me like a shot."</p>

<p>"I don't like Maurice Stainer," Anne interposed, "or his sister,
either. He is no good to you, Harold."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, the old shark wouldn't look at him and I couldn't
wait--or I should face exposure. I knew I could meet the bill all
right if Battledore won. He--the money-lender--suggested I should
get Saunderson's name. I knew I couldn't--Saunderson's as close as
a Jew, but I had to have the money somehow, and I was mad--mad! I
wrote the name."</p>

<p>The fear in Anne's eyes deepened.</p>

<p>"You--you forged!"</p>

<p>A hoarse sob broke in her brother's throat.</p>

<p>"I should have met it--I swear I should have met it, and it gave
me six months to turn round in. But it is too late. He has found
out--Saunderson. He has got the bill and he swears he will
prosecute. He will not even hear me."</p>

<p>"But he cannot--cannot prosecute! He is your friend."</p>

<p>"He will," Harold said hopelessly. "He is a good-for-nothing
scoundrel and he will send me to gaol and blacken our name for
ever--unless you--"</p>

<p>"Yes?" Anne's voice was low; she put her hands up to her throat.
"I don't know what you mean. Unless what?"</p>

<p>"Unless you go to him, unless you plead with him." Harold
brought the words out as if they were forced from him. "He thinks
more of you than anybody."</p>

<p>Anne threw her head back. In a swift, hot flame the colour
rushed over her face and neck and temples.</p>

<p>"Unless I ask him--that man? Do you know what that means? I--I
hate him! I am afraid of him."</p>

<p>"I know. I hate him. He is a damned brute, but--well, if I blew
my brains out it would not save the shame, the disgrace--" Her
brother broke off.</p>

<p>A momentary vision of General Courtenay's fine old face rose
before Anne, of his pathetic pride in his dead son's Victoria
Cross, in the Courtenay name. A sudden, fierce anger shook her.
This careless boy should not cloud the end of that noble life with
shame and bitter pain.</p>

<p>Harold slipped forward against the side of the window-frame.</p>

<p>"That's the end."</p>

<p>Anne watched him in unpitying silence. Then old memories came
back to her--of their early childhood, of the handsome, gallant
father who had been so proud of his little son, of the sweet,
gentle mother who had dearly loved them both, but whose favourite
had always been Harold. Her heart softened. She looked at her
brother's head, bent in humiliation. For the sake of her beloved
dead, no less than for the living whose pride he was, Harold must
be saved at whatever cost to herself.</p>

<p>She went over and touched his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I will do what I can," she promised. "I will ask him; I will
beg him. I will save you, Harold, somehow."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<p>In her room at Holford Hall Anne Courtenay was twisting her
hands together in agony. The Medchesters and their guests were
amusing themselves downstairs in the drawing-room, the gramophone
was playing noisy dance music. In the back drawing-room her
grandfather and his sister were having their usual game of bezique.
Anne had pleaded a headache and had gone to her room directly after
dinner. The hands of the clock on the mantelpiece were creeping on
to ten o'clock. In five minutes the hour would boom out from the
old church on the hill. It was no use delaying, that would only
make matters worse. She sprang up. Purposely to-night she had worn
black. She threw a dark cloak round her, and picking up a pull-on
black hat crushed it over her shingled hair. Then she unlocked a
small wooden box on her dressing-table and took out a piece of
notepaper. Across it was scrawled in Robert Saunderson's
characteristic bold black writing: "To-night at the summer-house at
ten o'clock." That was all. There was neither beginning nor ending.
Not one word to soften the words that were an ultimatum. Anne's
little, white teeth bit deeply into her upper lip as she read.</p>

<p>The summer-house stood in a clearing to the right of the Dutch
garden. From it an excellent view of the moors could be obtained
with the hazy, blue line of the northern hills in the distance. It
was a favourite resort with Lady Medchester for the picnic teas
which she favoured. That Anne Courtenay should be giving an
assignation there at this time of night seemed to her to show the
depths to which she had fallen. Saunderson had left the Medchesters
the day after the St. Leger. He had turned a resolutely deaf ear to
all Harold's appeals, and his ultimatum remained the same. He would
only treat with Anne. Anne herself must come to him, must plead
with him. To her alone he would tell the only terms on which Harold
could be saved.</p>

<p>Anne drew her cloak round her as she stole quietly down the
stairs to a side door. There was a full moon, but the masses of
fleecy cloud obscured the beams; little scuds of rain beat in
Anne's face as she let herself out. Through the open windows the
laughter and the gaiety of her fellow-guests reached her ears. She
crept silently by the side of the house into the shadow of one of
the giant clumps of rhododendrons that dotted the lawn and bordered
the expanse of grass between the house and the Dutch garden.</p>

<p>Anne looked like a wraith as she flitted from one bush to
another and finally gained the low wall that overlooked the Dutch
garden. A flight of steps led down to the garden and from there,
through a hand gate at the side of the rosery, a path went straight
to the summer-house.</p>

<p>It all, looked horribly dark and gloomy, Anne thought, as she
closed the gate. She waited uncertainly for a minute. All around
her she caught the faint multitudinous sounds of insect life that
go on incessantly in even the quietest night. Already the leaves
were beginning to fall. They lay thick upon the path and rustled
under her feet; in the distance she caught the cry of some
night-bird. Then nearer at hand there was a different sound. She
stopped and cowered against a tree, listening. What was it? It
could not be the cracking of a twig, footsteps among the withered
leaves, the dead pine-needles that lay thick on the ground? It
could not be anybody watching her--following her? Then a sudden
awful sense of fear assailed her, a certainty that something evil
was near her. For the time she was paralysed as she caught blindly
at a low branch. She listened, shivering from head to foot. Yes,
undoubtedly she could hear light footsteps, with something
sinister, it seemed to her, about their very stealthiness. Yet, as
the moon shone out from behind a passing cloud, there was nothing
to be seen, no sign of any living thing or any movement. All was
quiet, and as she stole softly to the summer-house, casting
terrified glances from side to side, she did not see a figure
standing up against the trunk of a tall pine near at hand, a face
that peered forward, watching her every movement.</p>

<p>She had expected to find Saunderson waiting for her--she told
herself that he must be--but there was no one to be seen, and
somewhat to her surprise the door of the summer-house was nearly
closed. She stopped opposite; there was something sinister, almost
terrifying, to her in the sight of that closed door, in the absence
of any sound or movement. At last very slowly she went forward,
halting between every step. Surely, surely, Saunderson must be
waiting for her?</p>

<p>"Mr. Saunderson," she whispered hoarsely, "are you there?"</p>

<p>There came no faintest sound in answer; yet surely, surely she
could catch the faint smell of a cigarette?</p>

<p>Very softly, very gingerly she pushed open the door.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"This," said Inspector Stoddart, tapping a paragraph in the
evening paper as he spoke, "is a job for us."</p>

<p>Harbord leaned forward and read it over the other's
shoulder.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Early this morning a gruesome discovery was made by a gardener
in the employ of Lord Medchester at Holford Hall in Loamshire. In a
summer-house at the back of the flower garden he found the body of
a man in evening-dress. A doctor was summoned and stated that the
deceased had been shot through the heart. Death must have been
instantaneous and must have taken place probably eight or nine
hours before the body was discovered."</p>

<p>"Look at the stop press news." Stoddart pointed to the space at
the side.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The body found in the summer-house at Holford has been
identified as that of a Mr. Robert Saunderson, who had been one of
Lord Medchester's guests for the races at Doncaster but had left
Holford the following day."</p>

<p>"Robert Saunderson," Harbord repeated, wrinkling his brows. "I
seem to know the name, but I can't place him. Isn't he a racing
man?"</p>

<p>"He would scarcely be a friend of the Medchesters if he wasn't,"
Stoddart replied, picking up the paper and staring at it as if he
would wring further information from it. "Regular racing lot they
belong to. Oh, I have heard of Saunderson. A pretty bad hat he was.
He had a colt or two training at Oxley, down by Epsom. Picked up
one or two minor races last year, but he's never done anything very
big. Medchester's horses are trained at Burford's, East Molton.
Lord Medchester's a decent sort of chap, I have heard. Anyway, a
victory of his is always acclaimed in the North. He generally does
well at Ayr and Bogside, and picks up a few over the sticks. Rumour
credits him with an overmastering desire to win one of the classic
races. His wife is a funny one--I fancy they don't hit it off very
well. His trainer, Burford, is a good sort. His engagement to a
cousin of Lord Medchester's was announced the other day."</p>

<p>"Not much of a match for her, I should say."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite decent. Burford makes a good thing out of his
training. He's a second son of old Sir William Burford and
half-brother of the present baronet. This Saunderson was pretty
well known in London society too, and I have heard that he was one
of Lady Medchester's admirers. I believe he was an American."</p>

<p>"Anyway, so long as he wasn't English, he wouldn't have much
difficulty in getting on in London society," Harbord remarked
sarcastically. "A bachelor too, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"As far as anyone knows," Stoddart answered.</p>

<p>A copy of "Who's Who" lay on the table. He pulled it towards
him. "'Saunderson, Robert Francis,'" he read. "'Born in Buenos
Aires 1888. Served in the Great War as an interpreter on the
Italian frontier. Invalided out in May 1917. Clubs, Automobile,
Junior Travellers.'"</p>

<p>"H'm! Not much of a dossier--wonder why they put him in?"
Harbord remarked.</p>

<p>"No; more noticeable for what it leaves out than for what it
puts in," Stoddart agreed.</p>

<p>"Well, I have received an S.O.S. from the Loamshire police, so
you and I will go down by the night express to Derby. From there it
is a crosscountry journey to Holford. Take a few hours, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"I wonder what Saunderson was doing in that neighbourhood when
he had left the Hall?" Harbord cogitated.</p>

<p>Stoddart shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I dare say we shall find out when we get there."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER 3</h2>

<p>"This is the principal entrance, I suppose," Stoddart said,
stopping before the lodge at Holford, and looking up the avenue of
oaks that was one of the chief attractions of the Hall.</p>

<p>As he spoke a small two-seater pulled up beside them and two men
sprang out. One of them Stoddart had no difficulty in recognizing
as the local superintendent of police; the other, a tall,
military-looking man, he rightly divined to be the Chief Constable,
Major Logston.</p>

<p>The Major looked at the two detectives.</p>

<p>"Inspector Stoddart, I presume. I was hoping to catch you. I
missed you at the station--had a break-down coming from home. This
is a terrible affair, inspector."</p>

<p>"I have only seen the bare account in the papers," Stoddart said
quietly. "Before we go any further I should very much like to hear
what you can tell us."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to give you all the details I can," Major
Logston said, entering the gates with him and leaving the
superintendent to bring up the rear with Harbord in the
two-seater.</p>

<p>"Of course we have had quantities of those damned reporters all
over the place." the Major began confidentially. "But we have told
the beggars as little as possible, and now we are not allowing them
within the gates."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded.</p>

<p>"Quite right, sir. Reporters are the very devil, with what they
pick up and what they invent. They've helped many a murderer to
escape the gallows."</p>

<p>"I entirely agree with you." The Chief Constable paused a
minute, then he said slowly, "This Robert Saunderson had been
staying at Holford quite recently. He had been one of the
house-party for the races, you know, inspector, for the St. Leger.
But he left the next day like most of the other guests, and deuce
knows why he came back. An under-gardener--Joseph Wilton by
name--was clearing up rubbish and such-like for one of those
bonfires that always make such a deuce of a stink all over the
place at this time of the year. He was round about the summer-house
and, glancing inside, was astounded to see a man lying on the
floor. He went in, as he says, to find if one of the gentlemen had
been 'took ill,' and discovered that he was dead and cold. He gave
the alarm to his fellow-gardeners and then he and another man went
up to the Hall to acquaint Lord Medchester with his discovery;
Medchester went back with them, imagining Wilton had exaggerated,
and was amazed and horrified to find not only that Wilton's story
was too true, but that the dead man was no other than Robert
Saunderson, who had so recently been his guest. Of course they got
the doctor there as soon as possible. He said the man had been dead
for hours, had probably died the night before the discovery."</p>

<p>"Presumably I should not be here if the case was one of
suicide?"</p>

<p>"Out of the question," Major Logston said decidedly. "I can't
give you the technical details, but the fellow had been shot
through the heart. Death must have been instantaneous. And the
revolver cannot be found."</p>

<p>"H'm!" The inspector drew in his lips. "Pretty conclusive, that.
Any clue to the murderer?"</p>

<p>The Chief shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not so far. The summer-house is a favourite place for tea with
Lady Medchester, so there'll be a maze of finger-prints and what
not. Oh, it won't be an easy matter to find out who fired the fatal
shot, as things look at present. I don't know whether Dr. Middleton
will be any help to you, but he is up at the Hall now. He is
attending General Courtenay, an uncle of Lord Medchester's, who had
a stroke last night, so you will be able to hear what he has to say
at once. Lord Medchester wants to see you too."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to see him," Stoddart said politely. "But first
about the body--I presume you have had it moved?"</p>

<p>"Yes. As soon as the doctor had seen it we had it taken to an
outhouse near the churchyard, which has to serve as a temporary
mortuary."</p>

<p>"Well, naturally you could do nothing else," the inspector said,
staring up at the windows of Holford Hall. "This Saunderson, now,
what was he like to look at?"</p>

<p>"Alive, do you mean?" the Chief Constable questioned. "I saw him
at Doncaster. Didn't care much for the look of him myself. Big
haw-haw sort of brute, don't you know. Pretty bad lot from all
accounts--always after the skirts. Well, here we are!"</p>

<p>Stepping inside the big portico that was over the front entrance
to the Hall, his ring was answered instantly. The two-seater stood
before the door. A young footman flung the door open and announced
that his lordship was expecting them. Stoddart joined Harbord and
the two went in together.</p>

<p>Lord Medchester received them in his study. The walls were lined
with books, but a little inspection showed that the two shelves
which had the appearance of being the most used were devoted to
racing literature. Lord Medchester was a tall, thin man in the
early forties; perfectly bald in front and on the crown, the ridge
of hair at the back was unusually thick and had the appearance of
having slipped down from the top. He glanced sharply at Stoddart as
the detectives entered, and came forward to meet them.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to see you, inspector. This--this is an
appalling thing to happen in one's grounds. And our local police
don't seem able to grapple with it at all--we look to you to find
out who killed the poor beggar."</p>

<p>"I will do my best, Lord Medchester. Will you tell me what you
know of Mr. Saunderson?"</p>

<p>"That will be precious little," said his lordship, subsiding
into a chair near the fireplace and motioning to Stoddart and
Harbord to take chairs close at hand. "I have met him out and about
for years. He was staying at Merton Towers for the Derby, and when
we were talking about putting a bit on Harkaway he gave me a tip
for Battledore for the Cup. The colt ran away with it, you know,
and I made a tidy pocketful over him. So, times being what they
are, and these damned Socialists not content with screwing every
penny they can out of you when you are alive, but dragging your
very grave from you when you are dead, I was deuced bucked with my
luck and on the spur of the moment I asked Saunderson here for the
St. Leger. He rather jumped at it, I thought, and turned up all
right. Of course we all put our shirts on Battledore and he let us
all down and ran nowhere. So I lost most of what I won at Goodwood.
I was a bit rattled, I can tell you. Not that it was Saunderson's
fault."</p>

<p>"Did he lose?" Stoddart asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, he went down on Battledore of course," his lordship
answered, "but he'd hedged on Goldfoot, lucky beggar! At least, I
thought he was lucky until this happened."</p>

<p>"He left Holford the day after the races, I understand?"
Stoddart pursued.</p>

<p>Lord Medchester nodded. "Yes, he went up to town with Colonel
Wynter, another of the men who were staying here."</p>

<p>"And you had no reason to expect him at Holford again?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, no!" his lordship said impatiently. "You might have
knocked me down with a feather when I heard he had been shot in the
summer-house; matter of fact, he had no encouragement from me to
come again. On further acquaintance I didn't exactly take a fancy
to Saunderson. Thought he was a bit of a bounder. Still, I don't
want to talk about that now the poor chap's been done in. But you
are asking."</p>

<p>"Precisely." The detective glanced at his notes and made a
hieroglyphic entry. "Now, I want to know whether he had any sort of
a quarrel with any of your other visitors--any woman got a down on
him?"</p>

<p>Glancing at him as he answered, Harbord caught a curious,
momentary gleam in Lord Medchester's eyes.</p>

<p>"He wasn't exactly a favourite, but they all seemed friendly
enough together," he replied, ignoring the latter half of the
question. "Besides, most of 'em had gone away. If they had wanted
to murder one another, they could have done it in town; no need to
come down here."</p>

<p>"Any possible love-affair with anyone at Holford?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, I should think not!" he said with a laugh that
sounded a bit forced in Stoddart's ears. "I shouldn't think
Saunderson was that sort, getting a bit long in the tooth. Besides,
there was nobody here he could have got soppy about. All of 'em
married and not the kind that are looking about to get rid of their
husbands."</p>

<p>"Nobody unmarried?" the inspector queried. "Not that that
matters. The married ones are generally the worst."</p>

<p>"Yes, there I am with you. They are if they take that way. But
you are talking about the unmarried ones. The only one in the lot
was my cousin, Miss Courtenay, and she is engaged to my trainer,
Michael Burford--no eyes for anyone else; damned nuisance
sometimes, don't you know! Be a bit more interesting in a year or
two. I made the remark to Saunderson, I remember."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much. Merely laughed. There wasn't much he could
say. Anybody could see it."</p>

<p>Stoddart got up. "Well, marriage doesn't make much difference to
some of them. I think the best thing I can do is just to have a
look round at the summer-house and then at the body. Perhaps you
would let me have a list of the house-party later on?"</p>

<p>"I'll have one made," Lord Medchester promised, getting up and
taking a position before the fireplace. "And if there's anything
else we can do you've only to let us know. It's no joke having a
man murdered at the back of your own garden."</p>

<p>That seemed to be all there was to be got out of Lord Medchester
and, as Stoddart observed to Harbord, it was not very
illuminating.</p>

<p>The doctor could only tell them two things--first, that death
had probably occurred some nine or ten hours before the body was
discovered, which would place the time round about ten o'clock the
preceding evening; and that, secondly, the automatic had not been
fired close at hand. The murderer, according to Dr. Middleton, had
probably stood outside the summer-house and fired through the open
doorway.</p>

<p>Stoddart drew his brows together as he and Harbord walked across
the lawn to the Dutch garden.</p>

<p>"Queer case!" the younger man ventured.</p>

<p>The inspector nodded.</p>

<p>"We'll just have a look at the summer-house before it gets too
dark, and interview the local superintendent. And then it strikes
me we may as well toddle back to town in the morning and
investigate Saunderson's doings. I fancy we are more likely to hit
on the clue there than here."</p>

<p>"I don't know," Harbord said slowly. "Of course he came here to
meet some one."</p>

<p>"Naturally!" the inspector assented. "One hardly imagines that
he travelled down for the sole purpose of being murdered. But the
two questions that present themselves, and which I fancy we shall
have some difficulty in answering are these: who did Saunderson
come to meet, and why did he come to Holford for the meeting?"</p>

<p>They were crossing the Dutch garden now. Harbord looked all
round before he answered.</p>

<p>"Through that gate at the side I suppose our way lies, sir. With
regard to your first question, I think it is pretty obvious the
person Saunderson came to meet must be some one in the Hall, either
a resident or a visitor. And he came, I should imagine, with some
very definite object. If it should be a love-affair it must have
been an illicit one. Therefore I should make a few careful
inquiries about any married women who may be in the house. As far
as I have ascertained they have a pretty good houseful now, as
large, if not larger, than the one they had for the St. Leger. If
there should be anyone here at the present time who was included in
the Doncaster party, I should look up that person's
antecedents."</p>

<p>"Well reasoned, Alfred. But"--the inspector looked at him with a
wry smile--"we have no proof that the murderer was a woman. As a
matter of fact I should say it is quite as likely, if not more
likely, to have been a man. Money or love, and in love I include
jealousy. As far as my experience goes nine-tenths of the murders
committed are committed for one or other of these motives. In this
case I think financial difficulties are just as likely to have led
to the death as an illicit love-affair."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they searched the place thoroughly?"</p>

<p>Stoddart shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You don't need me to tell you that when a place is used for tea
fairly often anything may be found there. Might be a dozen clues
that mean nothing. This is our way, I presume."</p>

<p>He unlatched the gate at the right-hand side of the Dutch
garden. They heard voices as they went along the path to the
summer-house.</p>

<p>The inspector frowned as he saw the downtrodden grass.</p>

<p>"Done their best to destroy any clue there might have been, of
course."</p>

<p>The summer-house stood on a little knoll in the midst of the
clearing; all around it the rhododendrons that formed the sides of
the Dutch garden had spread and were pressing closely.</p>

<p>Superintendent Mayer and another man, apparently occupied in
staring at the summerhouse, turned as the detectives
approached.</p>

<p>"I am pleased to see you, Inspector Stoddart," the
superintendent began. "This is a terrible job. We can't make
anything of it ourselves. 'Tain't believable that anybody
hereabouts would have done a thing like this."</p>

<p>"It is pretty obvious that somebody did, superintendent," the
inspector said dryly. "Still it is more than likely it was not a
native of Holford. This is where the body was found, I suppose. Can
you show me just how it lay?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can." The superintendent stepped into the summer-house.
"He lay right on his back, did the corpse. His head was over here,"
indicating a spot by the nearest leg of the rustic table. "His
feet, they were right there in the doorway. Seemed as if he had
been standing there, or maybe on the step. And I should say them as
he was expecting came right on him, maybe by a way he wasn't
looking for them."</p>

<p>The inspector surveyed the place where the dead man had lain in
silence for a minute. Then, standing on the step, he looked
round.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have been very difficult for anyone to take him
unawares. The rhododendrons come right up on all sides except the
front, it seems to me. But it rained last night in town. I expect
it was the same here. How did your unexpected assailant see to aim
at his victim?"</p>

<p>The superintendent stared at him.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But there was a moon, though it was showery most
of the time. The--the murderer must ha' waited till it shone a bit,
like, and then the gentleman's shirt front would make a decent
target."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded.</p>

<p>"Quite. Down here you say he was lying. Were his feet projecting
beyond the doorway?"</p>

<p>The superintendent scratched his head. "Sticking out, like, you
mean? No, they didn't. But I think as the murderer had searched
through his pockets and maybe been disturbed. The body had got on a
light overcoat and one of the pockets looked as if it had been
pulled out and pushed in again carelessly. I mean as it wasn't
right in like, a bit of it was left pulled out and just here by the
side of the pocket there was a notebook lying on the ground and a
paper or two, as if them that took them out had been in too much of
a hurry to put them back."</p>

<p>The inspector pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>The superintendent tramped across the summer-house and, stooping
down, drew a small leather attache-case from beneath the seat.</p>

<p>"I put 'em in this and locked 'em up." He felt in his pockets
and produced the key. "I thought you'd be wanting to see them or
I'd have taken them down to the police station," he said as he
unlocked the case and handed a pocket-book and a couple of letters
not enclosed in envelopes to Stoddart. "There's a lot of notes in
the pocket-book, so it don't look as if robbery had much to do with
it."</p>

<p>The inspector glanced at the letters first. One was merely a
business communication from a wholesale leather firm saying that
Mr. Saunderson's esteemed order should have their earliest
attention. The other was a very different affair. The detective's
eyes brightened as he looked at it. Written on good paper, it was
neither stamped nor dated, but across it was scrawled in large,
badly printed letters: "I accede because I have no choice."</p>

<p>That was all. There was no signature. Stoddart turned it over,
looked at it from every angle, and even actually smelt it before he
handed it back to the superintendent. Then he made no comment, but
he turned to his case-book and jotted down an unusually lengthy
entry. He opened the dead man's pocket-book and after a rapid
glance through it laid it on the table.</p>

<p>"Put this back in your case, superintendent. We will take it
back to the police station and go into it all carefully. Now,
before we go across to the mortuary, do you know how the deceased
got here? As he was not staying at the Hall, and presumably not in
the immediate neighbourhood, I mean? Did he come to Holford by
train?"</p>

<p>The superintendent shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not to Holford, he didn't. I have asked at the station and
nobody answering to his description was seen there last night, and
he must have been noticed if he had come, for there's precious few
passengers at Holford except the folks from the Hall. There's other
stations he might ha' come to, of course, but not hardly within
walking distance--seven or eight miles maybe, and cross-country at
that. His shoes don't look as if he had come far, either. And yet,
if he was in a car, where is the car?"</p>

<p>"H'm--well!" The inspector looked thoughtful. "We will go down
to the mortuary at once," he decided.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<p>As the Chief Constable had said, the temporary mortuary at
Holford was just an ordinary barn. Some rough trestles had been set
up in the middle under the direction of Superintendent Mayer, and
Robert Saunderson lay on them. Some one had thrown a white sheet
over the body. Superintendent Mayer tramped across and laid it
back.</p>

<p>"Looks as if he'd been surprised somehow," he commented, gazing
down on the face that, sensual and coarse-looking in life, had
gained a certain dignity in death. "Stiff and cold he'd been for
hours before we found him," the superintendent went on.</p>

<p>Standing beside him, Inspector Stoddart looked down at the dead
man. He glanced quickly over the face and form, then passed to the
light overcoat that hung over the bottom of the trestles.</p>

<p>"You have gone through the pockets, you said,
superintendent?"</p>

<p>"I have--and there's nothing in 'em to help us," that worthy
announced in a tone of assurance that made Stoddart raise his
eyebrows. "There's a letter or two, none from anywhere about here,
and the money that I showed you before. His wrist-watch too, I left
that on."</p>

<p>One of the dead man's arms was lying by his side. Stoddart
lifted it up; the watch had stopped at 9.30.</p>

<p>"We get the time of death approximately from that. Probably when
he fell the arm hit the ground heavily and stopped the watch."</p>

<p>"It might ha' been a bit fast or a bit slow, though," the
superintendent remarked wisely.</p>

<p>Stoddart's smile would have been a laugh but for the quiet
presence lying there before him.</p>

<p>Harbord at the side was going through the pockets of the dead
man's overcoat with quick, capable fingers. Suddenly he uttered a
sharp exclamation. As Stoddart and the superintendent looked at him
he held up something that gleamed for a moment in a ray of light
that filtered through the shadows of the barn.</p>

<p>Stoddart beckoned him to the door, and while the superintendent
replaced the sheet over the dead man the inspector glanced
curiously at the object his assistant had in his hand. He saw three
crystal beads linked together by a thin, gold chain.</p>

<p>Harbord looked at him.</p>

<p>"It must have dropped there when the pocket was searched."</p>

<p>The superintendent came up and elbowed them apart.</p>

<p>"No, beg pardon, it was not," he contradicted. "That wasn't in
the pocket when I searched it this morning. It must ha' been put
there since."</p>

<p>Harbord looked at him.</p>

<p>"It was the right-hand pocket beside which you found the book
and the notes, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded. "Ay, it was the right-hand pocket
sure enough, and it was pulled out, like, a bit, but the beads
weren't in it then."</p>

<p>"The chain had caught in the lining. That must have been how you
overlooked it," Harbord said shortly.</p>

<p>"It wasn't there at all," the superintendent said positively. "I
turned that pocket inside out. There was nothing there, I will
swear."</p>

<p>"Well, the thing is here now. What possibility is there of
getting it into the pocket after you searched it?" Stoddart
inquired sharply.</p>

<p>The superintendent scratched his head.</p>

<p>"I don't know. There was nobody but me and Constable Jones went
into the hut, not until the ambulance men fetched the body away. I
and the constable went across here to the barn to look round the
place and give orders about the trestles. The gardeners were seeing
to it and got a bit rattled, poor chaps. But we weren't gone more
than a few minutes before the ambulance men arrived--but what would
they go dropping glass beads about for?"</p>

<p>"Who were the ambulance men?"</p>

<p>"They weren't men as I know," the superintendent said
thoughtfully. "Not as to say well, that is. They work at the
Cottage Hospital on the hill, the two as brought the
ambulance-stretcher, as they call it. It's on wheels. His lordship,
he gave it to the hospital. They lifted him"--with a backward jerk
at the stark form under the sheet--"the two men and Jones and a
gardener that was passing. I gave a hand, steadying the stretcher
and helping when they laid it on. But I don't see--I do not
see"--pausing and endeavouring apparently to recall the scene--"as
any of them had the chance to put those beads in the pocket, even
if they wanted to, which don't seem likely."</p>

<p>It did not. As the inspector closed the door of the barn behind
them his eyes had a puzzled, far-away look.</p>

<p>"Did you know the gardener who helped you?" Stoddart inquired as
they crossed the churchyard and turned in at the private gate into
the Holford grounds.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know as I do; he isn't a Holford man," the
superintendent said, his broad, red face wearing the look of
bewilderment that had come over it when he saw the beads. "He was
just working in the rosery and saw them bring the ambulance, and
came along to find out if he could help. He were likely enough one
of the young men that's here to learn a bit of gardening from Mr.
Macdonald, and lives up at the cottage at the back of the
glass-houses."</p>

<p>"I see!" The inspector made a note in his book. "We will just
have a word with this gardener. Who is that?"</p>

<p>"That" was a young man who had come out of the Hall and was
walking a little way down the path across the lawn at a brisk pace.
Seeing them, he had hesitated a minute, and then turned off sharply
towards the big entrance gates.</p>

<p>The superintendent stared after him.</p>

<p>"That--that is young Mr. Courtenay, his lordship's cousin. I
should ha' said he didn't want to see us."</p>

<p>"So should I!" the inspector assented grimly. "But
unfortunately, as it happens, since the desire is apparently not
mutual, Mr. Harold Courtenay is a young gentleman I particularly
wish to interview. I fancy striking over here by the pine trees we
shall manage to intercept him."</p>

<p>He set off at a brisk pace, Harbord by his side, the burly
superintendent puffing and blowing behind.</p>

<p>They emerged from the grove of trees at the side of the Hall
immediately in front of Harold Courtenay.</p>

<p>That young gentleman looked amazed to see them step out on the
walk in front of him. The inspector, glancing at him keenly,
fancied that he saw discomposure mingling with the surprise.</p>

<p>He went forward.</p>

<p>"Mr. Harold Courtenay, I think? I should be glad if I might have
a few words with you."</p>

<p>Harold Courtenay glanced round as if seeking some way of escape,
but nothing presenting itself apparently resigned himself to the
inevitable.</p>

<p>"Inspector Stoddart, I think, isn't it? My cousin told me you
had come down. I am quite at your service, inspector."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Courtenay."</p>

<p>Young Courtenay was looking very ill, the inspector thought. His
face was sickly grey beneath its tan, his eyes had a scared,
furtive look, two or three times his mouth twitched oddly to one
side as the inspector watched him.</p>

<p>"Just a question or two I wanted to put to you," Stoddart went
on. "Later on there may be other things, but now I shall not detain
you more than a minute or two."</p>

<p>"That's all right," Courtenay said at once. "If anything I can
tell you will help you I shall be only too glad. I am only afraid
it won't. I had no idea even that Saunderson was likely to be in
the neighbourhood last night." He stopped and swallowed something
in his throat. "He was rather by way of being a friend of mine, you
know, inspector."</p>

<p>Stoddart nodded, his keen eyes never relaxing their watch on the
young man's face.</p>

<p>"So I have heard. When did you last see him, Mr. Courtenay?"</p>

<p>The young man hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, just a few days ago," he said vaguely. "The beginning of
the week, I think it was. Monday evening, I remember now. I called
at his flat."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you he was coming down here in the near future?"
the inspector questioned.</p>

<p>Courtenay shook his head. "Never even mentioned Holford so far
as I can remember."</p>

<p>"Did he speak of anyone or anything that could have had any
bearing on last night's tragedy?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" Courtenay said with decision.</p>

<p>"We only spoke on the most ordinary topics."</p>

<p>"Can you remember any of those topics?" the inspector
questioned.</p>

<p>Harold Courtenay waited a moment before answering.</p>

<p>"Nothing much," he said slowly. "Most of the time it was about
racing. We both of us cursed Battledore for letting us down over
the St. Leger. And Saunderson said somebody had given him a tip for
the autumn double--Cesarewitch and the Cambridgeshire, you
know--White Flower and Dark Mouth; and he said he shouldn't do it,
though the chap that told him generally knew what he was talking
about. Dark Mouth is French--he'd never fancied a French horse, he
said, since Epinard let him down over the Cambridgeshire."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him you were coming here?"</p>

<p>"N--o! I don't think so," the young man said with a momentary
indecision that did not escape the inspector's keen eyes. "No, as a
matter of fact I don't think I knew that I was coming here myself
then."</p>

<p>"When did you come?" the inspector asked. "In the afternoon of
Thursday, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by the 3.30 from Derby to Holford." There was a certain
relief in Courtenay's tone now. His eyes met Stoddart's openly.</p>

<p>"And Saunderson--when did he come?" the inspector said
quickly.</p>

<p>"Saunderson?" Courtenay stared at him. "I don't know. I don't
know anything about him. I couldn't believe it when I heard he was
lying dead in the summer-house."</p>

<p>"When did you hear?" The inspector looked straight at the young
man as he put the question.</p>

<p>"Why, when the gardener came up and told us all." Courtenay
looked down and shifted his feet about on the gravel
uncertainly.</p>

<p>The inspector brought out his notebook. "Now, Mr. Courtenay,
this is just a matter of course. I have nearly finished. What were
you doing between nine and ten o'clock last night, and where were
you?"</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock last night?" Courtenay repeated, kicking up a big
bit of gravel. "Well, the Medchesters had some neighbours in to
dinner and of course there were a few of us staying in the house,
and afterwards we had a rubber of bridge in the card-room. I meant
to take a hand, but I cut out, and after I'd watched the play a bit
I went into the billiard-room with a couple of other men and
knocked the balls about. Later on I went back to the card-room and
had a game. Landed a pound or two, too--my luck was in."</p>

<p>"How long were you in the billiard-room?"</p>

<p>Courtenay, having got up his piece of gravel, kicked it off into
the grass.</p>

<p>"Oh, it might have been half an hour or so, or maybe it might
have been a bit longer. I couldn't tell you nearer than that," he
said carelessly, but his eyes from beneath their heavy lids shot an
odd glance at the inspector as he spoke.</p>

<p>Stoddart's quick fingers were making notes. He was not looking
at Courtenay now.</p>

<p>"Who were the two men with you in the billiard-room?"</p>

<p>"Sir James Wilson and Captain Maddock," Courtenay said quickly.
"Mind, I don't say they were there all the time. We were in and
out, you know."</p>

<p>The inspector made no comment.</p>

<p>"Can you give me the names of the card-players?"</p>

<p>"Not all of them right off, I can't," Courtenay said after a
minute or two spent apparently in trying to quicken his memory.
"Old Lady Frinton was my partner, I know, and the vicar part of the
time. The others may come back to me later on."</p>

<p>"Lord and Lady Medchester, perhaps?" the inspector
suggested.</p>

<p>Courtenay shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Lord Medchester was with us in the
billiard-room a bit. Then he went off. I think a few of them were
smoking on the veranda."</p>

<p>"And Lady Medchester? Was she playing?"</p>

<p>Courtenay paused a moment.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I remember she wouldn't, though she is generally
pretty keen about it. But I don't think they played high enough for
her. She goes in for pretty high stakes in town. She just dodged
about, looking after folks. The two old people--the Dowager and my
old grandfather--were playing bezique in the small drawing-room. I
didn't see much of her."</p>

<p>"I see." The inspector produced the crystal beads from his
pocket and held them up. "Have you ever seen these before, Mr.
Courtenay?"</p>

<p>Harold Courtenay stared at them, and as he looked the colour
which had been coming back to his face ebbed away again.</p>

<p>"I--I don't know," he stammered. "I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure?" The inspector spoke suavely, but there was
a look in his eyes which Harbord knew was a danger signal.</p>

<p>Harold Courtenay wriggled uneasily.</p>

<p>"I may have done; I can't be sure. Every woman you meet wears
this sort of thing nowadays."</p>

<p>"True enough," the inspector assented, dangling the beads before
him. "And these are of no particular value. You can see that at
once."</p>

<p>"Where did you find them?" Harold Courtenay asked, his eyes
watching them as if fascinated, while the inspector dangled them
before him.</p>

<p>A curious, enigmatic smile twisted Stoddart's thin lips.</p>

<p>"Ah! That," he said as he restored the beads to his pocket, "is
my secret, Mr. Courtenay--and it will be as well if you say nothing
about them at present."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<p>"This is a queer case," Inspector Stoddart said slowly. "There
is something about it I don't understand, I can't fathom--"</p>

<p>Harbord made no rejoinder. He looked tired and worried. The two
men were sitting in the little room the inspector had engaged at
the "Medchester Arms." It was a small, unpretentious village inn,
and they had been fortunate in securing the rooms vacated that
morning by Maurice Stainer and his sister. They had just finished
their midday meal--the cold beef and pickles which, with a slice of
apple pasty, was all that Holford could produce in the way of
luncheon at the end of the week.</p>

<p>A box of cigarettes stood on the table. Stoddart stretched out
his hand and took one.</p>

<p>"There's nothing like a smoke for clearing one's brain; to my
way of thinking, nothing beats a gasper. Lord Medchester made me
take a couple of Egyptians this morning. Very good, but give me my
own gold flake."</p>

<p>"Yes, I hate those strong things," Harbord assented. "But I'd
smoke 'em fast enough if I thought they'd do my brain any good. It
seems to be made of cotton-wool lately. Young Courtenay knows
something. I am clear enough about that."</p>

<p>Stoddart drew in his lips.</p>

<p>"So do a good many other people--Lord Medchester for one. But as
to what it is, and how much there is to it, I can't make up my
mind. How did those beads come in Saunderson's pocket, and who put
them there?</p>

<p>"There were those few moments when the superintendent went to
look at the barn, but to my mind they must have been there when he
searched the body."</p>

<p>Harbord lighted a cigarette and continued:</p>

<p>"As I see things, it must have been a woman who shot
Saunderson--probably he had letters from her. He may have been
holding them over her, for he seems to have been a tolerably bad
hat where women are concerned. Then she searched his
pocket--possibly she knew they were there, and the beads look as if
they had been part of a chain, one of those long, dangling things
women wear to make up for their short skirts, maybe. A chain of
white glass beads is common enough. They are always catching on
buttons and what not, you know, sir."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't," the inspector said with emphasis on the
pronoun. "They never get the chance of catching on my buttons,
thank the Lord. But there's a snag in your theory, Alfred--the
beads were not there when the body was found."</p>

<p>"According to Superintendent Mayer," Harbord corrected. "They
were not in the bottom of the pocket, you know, sir. One of the
links of the chain had hooked itself in the lining of the pocket. I
think it would be quite easy to take papers or anything of that
sort out without feeling the beads."</p>

<p>"Only the pocket-book and papers were lying on the floor," the
inspector objected. "No use trying to make facts fit in with your
theory, Alfred. And don't make the mistake of underestimating the
superintendent's intelligence. Because he is fat and ponderous and
talks with the accent of Loamshire, you do not give him credit for
the brains he possesses."</p>

<p>"Does he?" Harbord questioned sceptically. The inspector
nodded.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. Medchester isn't much of a place certainly, but a
man doesn't become police superintendent even there without a
certain amount of ability. As for Superintendent Mayer--" He
paused.</p>

<p>"Well?" Harbord said interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Those little pig's eyes of his see further than you think,"
Stoddart finished. "Oh, there were no beads when he went through
the pocket; I feel sure of that."</p>

<p>"Then how did they get there?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" The inspector lay back in his chair and smoked his gasper.
"I should very much like to discover that. As I said just now,
there is some nasty, hanky-panky work going on here that I don't
understand at all."</p>

<p>Harbord was on the point of replying when there was a knock at
the door. The landlady of the "Medchester Arms" looked in.</p>

<p>"Joseph Wilton is asking to see you, sir. The gardener that
found the poor gentleman dead in the summer-house," she added in an
explanatory tone.</p>

<p>The inspector sat up.</p>

<p>"Show him in, please, Mrs. Marlow."</p>

<p>Joseph Wilton was a clean-looking, clean shaven man, probably in
the early forties. He was evidently in his working clothes, but
they were whole and tidy. About him there clung that indefinable
smell that always seems to hang about those who work on the
land.</p>

<p>He touched his forehead to the inspector.</p>

<p>"Afternoon, sir."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Wilton," the inspector returned politely.
"I hear that it was you who found Mr. Saunderson's body in the
summer house."</p>

<p>"It was, sir." The man hesitated a minute. "It was, sir," he
said again. "I found the poor gentleman then, and now I ha' found
this here." He put one horny hand in his trouser pocket and fumbled
for a moment or two; then very slowly he produced something that he
dangled before the inspector's amazed eyes--a long chain of crystal
beads linked together by a thin, gold chain. It had evidently been
broken and the two ends hung loose.</p>

<p>The inspector sprang up.</p>

<p>"That, by Jove! Where did you find it?"</p>

<p>"Down among the rhododendrons hard by the rosery gate, on the
right side. I was clearing out there and cutting the rhododendrons
back a bit," Joseph Wilton answered, shaking his find before the
inspector. "I showed it to Mr. Macdonald, our head gardener, and he
said I'd better bring it to you; it might be you'd want to see it,
he said."</p>

<p>"So I do," the inspector said, taking the chain in his hand and
examining it with care. "It is a thing I have wanted to see very
much indeed, Mr. Wilton. Now, should you be able to show us exactly
where you found this thing if we went back to the garden with
you?"</p>

<p>Wilton scratched his head and looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe I could, and again maybe I couldn't. I dessay I
should be within a few yards, anyway."</p>

<p>"That'll do for our purpose." The inspector crossed over to a
cupboard that was let into the wall near the fireplace and, opening
it, deposited the chain in a small box therein, and carefully
locking it dropped the key in his pocket. "Well, we will walk up
with you, Mr. Wilson, and you shall show us as near as you
can."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I'll do my best."</p>

<p>They all three went out of the "Medchester Arms" together and,
walking up the village street towards the Hall, Joseph Wilton's
pleasure at being seen by his neighbours in the company of his
obvious superiors was tempered by fear that they might imagine he
had been taken into custody.</p>

<p>"'Twould be easier, like, to cross over there through the
paddock to the blue doors and walk up to the rosery from there than
to go round by the lodge," he observed at last, pointing to a stile
by the side of the road.</p>

<p>"Well, the quicker we are the better," the inspector
assented.</p>

<p>He sprang over the stile and the other two followed. The path
across the paddock was pretty well defined and quite obviously led
to the path at the bottom of the rosery.</p>

<p>"Easily accessible, the Hall gardens," the inspector observed,
looking round. "Saunderson would have had no difficulty in getting
in."</p>

<p>"N--o!" Wilton, too, looked round. "He could ha' got in right
enough, but the keeper's lodge's round there and the dogs are often
out at night, and they might go for a stranger. I did hear, though,
that they were all out at the Spring Wood that night looking for
poachers."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! Well, later on we might have a chat with the
keeper," Stoddart remarked with a glance at Harbord. "It must have
given you a scare, Mr. Wilton, when you saw the man lying dead in
the summer-house."</p>

<p>"It did that," Wilton assented. "First when I saw some one lying
there the thought come to me that it was some tramp that had got in
and maybe gone to sleep. When I saw what it was I turned fair
sick."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder. I expect it would turn most of us," the
inspector said sympathetically. "Did you move the body at all, or
touch it in any way?"</p>

<p>Wilton shook his head.</p>

<p>"I did not, sir. I saw directly I got up to him the gentleman
was dead and cold, and I called out to Bill Griggs as was sweeping
up leaves outside on the walk, and when he had had a look we both
run up to the house to tell his lordship."</p>

<p>"You were one of those who lifted the body on to the stretcher,
I understand?" the inspector pursued.</p>

<p>"Ay! That I was, and a nasty job it was," the other agreed
slowly. "I dunno as I should care for such another."</p>

<p>"This Bill Griggs you spoke of just now, was he one of the
others to lift the body?"</p>

<p>"No, that he wasn't," Wilton said, pausing by an iron railing
that ran down one side of the rosery. "There was just the two
ambulance men and me. The superintendent he helped a bit, steadying
the head and so forth. There wasn't anybody else needed."</p>

<p>"That so?" The inspector looked at him. "Who were the ambulance
men? They would be in some sort of uniform, I presume? You would
know them?"</p>

<p>"Y--es, I did, in a manner of speaking," Wilton responded
slowly. "They was Holford men, the two of 'em. I ha' passed the
time of day with them when I've met 'em, which hasn't been often.
If you could get over those railings, sir, it'd be the nearest way
to the summer-house."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can manage that right enough," the inspector said
lightly.</p>

<p>He put his hand on the top rail and vaulted over. Harbord
followed suit, then Wilton clambered over.</p>

<p>"You are wonderfully nippy for town gentlemen," he said, gazing
admiringly at the detectives.</p>

<p>The inspector laughed.</p>

<p>"Ah, I wasn't always a town gentleman, Mr. Wilton. You've no
idea, I suppose, who the owner of the bead necklace might be?"</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"You're sure?" the inspector pressed. "Never seen it on any of
the ladies staying at the house?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I am that!" Wilton said positively. "Not that I'd notice
much what they got round their necks. Never saw 'em before so far
as I know."</p>

<p>"Bead necklaces are pretty much alike," the inspector said
thoughtfully. "I suppose we are getting near the place where you
found it?"</p>

<p>Wilton assented as he unlatched the little gate at the side of
the rosery and led the way into the Dutch garden. Right in front of
them were the rhododendrons that formed the hedge between the
garden and the clearing in the midst of which the summer-house
stood.</p>

<p>"It was up here." Wilton quickened his step until he had nearly
reached the wall forming the northern boundary of the Dutch garden.
"I left my shears here, you see. I was cutting back the bushes.
Those leaves I brushed up near there and I saw the necklace caught
on one of the lowest boughs of that there rhododendron, a fine pink
'un it is in the spring. But I couldn't reach it from here, and
there's wire along the lower part to keep the rabbits away from the
flower-beds, so I had to go to the summer-house side to get
it."</p>

<p>The inspector peered through. The rhododendrons were high and
thick and strong with the growth of years. He marvelled how Wilton
could have seen anything.</p>

<p>"Tidy distance from the summer-house, isn't it? Looks as if the
thing must have been put there on purpose."</p>

<p>"'Tain't so far from the summer-house as you think," Wilton
dissented. "Nearly right opposite here it is. And pretty straight
across it is. If anybody came down in the dark, side of those
rhododendrons, that necklace might easily get caught and pulled
off. That's how I look at it; or, again, it might ha' been thrown
there by somebody that didn't want it to tell tales," he finished
darkly.</p>

<p>"It'll tell tales all right," the inspector muttered as he and
Harbord, having marked the spot, walked off.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<p>"Only two women who were in the house-party for Doncaster were
staying at Holford Hall last Thursday," Stoddart said, meeting
Harbord in the village street outside the 'Medchester Arms.' "One
of them is Miss Courtenay, Lord Medchester's cousin, the other is a
Mrs. Williamson, the pretty young second wife of a retired Indian
colonel, to whom she is apparently devoted."</p>

<p>"That narrows matters down a little," Harbord said
consideringly. "Though of course we have no certainty that the
person who shot Saunderson was a member of the Doncaster
house-party, or of the party last Thursday, for that matter."</p>

<p>"No certainty at all," the inspector assented.</p>

<p>"In fact, there is no certainty about the whole thing except
Saunderson's death. He is to be buried to-morrow, by the way. The
coroner has given the certificate. I was about to add that four men
were included in both parties. Colonel Williamson, Mr. Harold
Courtenay--he, of course, is the young gentleman who was so anxious
to get out of our way this morning--Captain Maddock and Sir John
Linford. All of those must be interviewed to-day. If possible we
must see the ladies first."</p>

<p>"Of course," Harbord agreed thoughtfully. "There is also Lady
Medchester. Rumour credits her with a distinct penchant for
Saunderson."</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't forgotten her ladyship," Stoddart said quietly.
"But Lady Medchester is a lady of a good many affairs--still, you
can't say she wouldn't lose her head over Robert Saunderson.
However, we will get her first if we can. Lord Medchester says we
may interview the folks in the gun-room. But I fancy it will be
best to ask for Lady Medchester first and see her wherever she
wishes. It is curious that nobody appears to have a satisfactory
alibi."</p>

<p>Just inside the lodge gates they encountered Lord Medchester. He
greeted them with effusion.</p>

<p>"I was just going down to have a word with the vicar. It's about
this funeral of Saunderson's. Nobody seems to know anything about
the fellow, and he's left no directions that anybody knows of. I
think the poor chap will have to be buried down here."</p>

<p>"Hasn't he left a Will?"</p>

<p>"Haven't been able to get on the track of it if he has," Lord
Medchester said discontentedly. "They say at the bank--the United
Overseas, you know--that he was joking with the manager a week or
two ago about not having made a Will, and said he would when he had
anything to leave and anybody to leave it to. Sort of rubbishing
joke a chap does make, you know."</p>

<p>"I know," the inspector assented gravely. "Well, perhaps it will
be as well to bury him here if he hasn't expressed any wish for
anywhere else."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say I have any wish to be buried anywhere
myself," his lordship rejoined. "I'd rather stay above ground as
long as I can. And I don't want to be cremated. Beastly business
that."</p>

<p>"There is something to be said for and against," the inspector
said impartially. "We were just coming up to the Hall. You will
understand that, purely as a matter of form, we have to ask every
one who was at the Hall that night to account for his or her
movements at the time of the murder?"</p>

<p>"What!" His lordship looked aghast. "You don't mean everybody at
the Hall? Gardeners and gamekeepers, of course. And, as I said
before, the gun-room is at your service if you wish to see 'em
indoors; but you can't suspect my guests or the indoor
servants!"</p>

<p>"I don't suspect anybody, Lord Medchester," the inspector said
gravely. "But I have got to find out who shot Mr. Saunderson, and
first of all I have to find out where every one in the immediate
neighbourhood was between nine and eleven o'clock last Thursday.
Perhaps I might be allowed to begin with you? You would be, I
presume, with your guests?"</p>

<p>"Of course I was." His lordship took off his hat and mopped his
bald head. "Well, if that is how things are, I'd better walk back
with you myself. I expect some of the folks will be a bit rattled
when they know what you are up to."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not," the inspector dissented. "I shall only keep
them a few minutes if they are sensible. You, now, will be able to
tell me just who was with you at that time. That will put them out,
of course."</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know that I can." Lord Medchester replaced
his hat and turned back up the avenue with them. "Nine o'clock?
That would be just after dinner. Well, we didn't stay in the
dining-room long--some of 'em started playing auction, but I always
find that a bit slow myself, and as there didn't seem much chance
of poker or baccarat I went into the billiard-room with some of the
others. But I had only just gone in when Mr. Burford--that's my
trainer--and Captain Maddock came in and wanted a word with us.
Some of the horses were coughing, and he had taken a fancy to have
some vet he'd heard of down from town. Well, we didn't quite see
it, either of us. It would have meant a pretty pot of money, and we
were satisfied with old Tom Worseley, who'd looked after them
before. Burford, who is a pretty obstinate chap, was inclined to
argue the matter. So we went to smoke our cigarettes and talk
things over in the veranda."</p>

<p>"Well, Lord Medchester, you can at least answer for it that
neither Captain Maddock nor Mr. Burford was near the rosery during
the suspected time." The inspector cast a keen glance at the
other's face as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know that I could," he said in a worried
tone. "I was dodging about, you know, in and out from the card-room
to the billiard-room talking to one and the other. When a man has
guests he can't sit in one place all the evening."</p>

<p>"Of course he can't," the inspector agreed. They were getting
near the front door, but Lord Medchester turned off across the
grass.</p>

<p>"We'll go in by the side door and to my study. Then I will fetch
Lady Medchester."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"She won't like coming. I dare say you will find her a bit
ratty," his lordship observed confidentially. "And I don't think
she will be able to tell you anything. But that's that."</p>

<p>He took them in by the conservatory door and straight to his
study--an apartment redolent of tobacco and scattered over with
racing papers.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester did not hurry herself. Stoddart went over to the
bookshelves.</p>

<p>"Who was Lady Medchester, I wonder?"</p>

<p>He took out a Peerage and turned over the leaves rapidly. Then
he drew in his lips.</p>

<p>"H'm! Tells its own tale. Richard Frederick, fifth Viscount
Medchester... Married Minnie, daughter of Francis, Baron
Loamfield... Oh, that may account for a great deal."</p>

<p>Harbord looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, you observe she was not the Honourable Minnie.
Francis, Baron Loamfield, was about as bad as they make 'em. Lady
Loamfield couldn't stand him. But she didn't divorce him, being a
Catholic. Loamfield had any amount of mistresses and a large family
of illegitimate children. Looked after 'em, too, which is more than
some of 'em do. One of 'em is a butcher in Loamby. This Minnie, I
have heard of her, though it had slipped my memory till I saw this
paragraph. Well, Minnie was running about wild, and she took his
fancy, being both pretty and independent; he had her educated and
gave her a big marriage portion. But the Loamfield blood's in her,
and if she runs straight--well, there isn't much in heredity."</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is?" Harbord hesitated.</p>

<p>They had no time for more. Lady Medchester came quickly across
the hall and into the room.</p>

<p>"You want to speak to me?" she said abruptly.</p>

<p>"If you please, Lady Medchester." Stoddart placed a chair for
her and closed the door. A glance told him that she was not looking
well. Her make-up was not sufficient to disguise the pallor of her
face or do away with the dark circles round her eyes, and her lips,
scarlet with lipstick, were visibly trembling.</p>

<p>"You remember the night of Thursday?"</p>

<p>Lady Medchester nodded and put her handkerchief up to her
trembling lips.</p>

<p>"Of course I do. I--I wish I could forget it. But I can't. I
never shall."</p>

<p>"You had a dinner-party that night, I understand?"</p>

<p>"Of course we had. You know that. Lord Medchester told you about
it," Lady Medchester returned impatiently. She put down her
handkerchief, on which two dabs of lipstick were plainly visible,
and started twisting it about in her fingers.</p>

<p>"Could you tell us all you know about Mr. Saunderson?"</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't so much really," she began, and Harbord
wondered whether he was mistaken or whether there really was the
shadow of a great fear in the big, pale eyes with their
bistre-tinted eyelashes and eyebrows. "I met him in town this last
season fairly often, and we stayed in the same house for
Goodwood."</p>

<p>"He was an agreeable, pleasant sort of man, I understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very. I was quite pleased when my husband asked him to join
our party for Doncaster."</p>

<p>Inspector Stoddart consulted his notebook.</p>

<p>"I take it that you found him quite an agreeable visitor? But
that when he left you had no particular reason to expect to see him
in the neighbourhood again?"</p>

<p>"No, not the least." Lady Medchester's tone was growing more
assured now. "I simply could not believe it when I heard he had
been found dead in the summer-house," she added.</p>

<p>"You have not the least idea what brought him to Holford?"</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine. The only thing I can think of is"--she
stopped and swallowed something in her throat--"that he had some
important news for my husband, something about the horses, perhaps,
and came down to see him. Perhaps he knew of the short-cut from the
village that brings you out by the rosery. Then perhaps some
poacher met him and shot him."</p>

<p>"But why should Saunderson be in the village?" Stoddart
questioned.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I do not pretend to explain everything. That is
the only thing I have been able to think of."</p>

<p>"I see." The inspector consulted his notes again. "Now, Lady
Medchester, I am sure you will understand that this is merely a
formality--can you tell me just what you were doing between nine
and ten o'clock on the night of Thursday?"</p>

<p>Once more there was that odd trembling of the lips, the curious
light eyes avoided his.</p>

<p>"I was with my visitors, of course. I don't know that I can tell
you any more."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you played bridge?" Stoddart suggested.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. As a matter of fact, I had rather a headache and
I didn't feel quite up to cards. We had some music in the
drawing-room and I was there most of the evening. But of course I
went backwards and forwards to the card-room and the hall two or
three times just to see how people were getting on."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you could tell me if Mrs. Williamson and Miss
Courtenay were playing cards?"</p>

<p>Lady Medchester hesitated.</p>

<p>"I--I think Mrs. Williamson was. Miss Courtenay I know was not.
She said"--with a perceptible hesitation--"she had a headache and
went up to her room immediately after dinner."</p>

<p>The inspector made an entry in his notebook.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Courtenay?"</p>

<p>Lady Medchester wrinkled her eyebrows as if trying to
remember.</p>

<p>"I don't remember seeing much of him. He was playing bridge for
some little time. But not, I think, all the time you mention.
Probably he was in the billiard-room."</p>

<p>"In the billiard-room, I thank you," Stoddart said politely. He
waited a minute, then he dived into his pocket and produced the
crystal beads. "Have you ever seen this before, Lady
Medchester?"</p>

<p>She leaned forward and looked at it, hiding her eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," she said slowly, her mouth setting in a hard
line. "I am not sure, though. It seems somehow familiar. But, then,
so many people wear this sort of thing nowadays."</p>

<p>"It is not yours?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" Lady Medchester smiled with regained composure.
"It is not at all valuable," she added with a certain contempt in
her tone.</p>

<p>"So I imagined." The inspector dropped the beads in his pocket.
"Thank you, and I shall be obliged if you will say nothing about
the beads. That is all for this morning. I should like a few words
with Miss Courtenay."</p>

<p>Lady Medchester got up. "I will send her to you. She is
expecting the summons. Lord Medchester told us both you wanted us.
But Miss Courtenay will not have much time to spare," she added as
the inspector opened the door. "Her grandfather, whom you may have
heard of, had a stroke, and the doctors do not give us much hope.
He is not so well this morning."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear that," the inspector said politely. He
waited until she had got out of hearing. "Rather a daisy, isn't
she? I don't know that I envy Lord Medchester his wife."</p>

<p>"I don't, anyway," Harbord said bluntly. "I don't envy anybody
his wife. Mostly a damned nuisance, it seems to me."</p>

<p>The inspector looked at him.</p>

<p>"What! Turning misanthrope? This business is enough to make one
of any man. Some damn fool of a woman is always at the bottom of
it."</p>

<p>Anne Courtenay did not keep them waiting. She looked a curious
contrast to Lady Medchester in her plain, black frock, which just
left her pretty, rounded throat bare. Yet a curious look came into
Stoddart's eyes as he set a chair for her so that her face was well
in the light, while he himself remained in the shadow nearer the
fireplace.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to trouble you in the circumstances, Miss
Courtenay," the inspector began. "But I am sure you will understand
that I have no choice in the matter. I will keep you only a few
minutes."</p>

<p>Anne bent her head.</p>

<p>"It is no matter," she said quietly. "The nurses are with my
grandfather. I am only allowed to see him for a few minutes at a
time."</p>

<p>"Then I will begin at once by asking you to tell me how much you
knew of Mr. Saunderson."</p>

<p>"Very little," Anne returned, raising her eyes to the
inspector's face. "He was kind to my brother and they were very
friendly, but I am very little in town and naturally did not see
much of him."</p>

<p>"He never visited the General?" Stoddart hazarded.</p>

<p>Anne shook her head. "My grandfather receives very few visitors,
only quite old friends."</p>

<p>"I take it that you and Mr. Saunderson were strangers when you
met at the house-party here for the Doncaster races?"</p>

<p>"No, not quite that. I believe"--Anne hesitated a minute--"that
I first met Mr. Saunderson when I was staying with Lady Medchester
last spring, but I saw very little of him."</p>

<p>"And at the house-party here?"</p>

<p>"Well, naturally I saw more of him then." She paused and then
went on more quickly. "I may as well say at once that it was as
little as I could help, for I did not like Mr. Saunderson at all,
though he was a friend of my brother's, and though perhaps I ought
not to say so now he is dead."</p>

<p>"Oh, I quite understand," the inspector said sympathetically.
"Mr. Saunderson does not seem to have been a general favourite. I
suppose you did not expect to see him again when the party for the
St. Leger broke up?"</p>

<p>"I hoped I should not," Anne said candidly. "I did not think Mr.
Saunderson's influence did my brother any good."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me just what you were doing after dinner last
Thursday night?" As he spoke the inspector produced his notebook
and laid it on the table.</p>

<p>Anne considered a moment.</p>

<p>"I had a headache," she said slowly, "and it was hot downstairs,
and all the talking at dinnertime made it worse. So I went up to my
room and lay down."</p>

<p>"Did you stay upstairs all the evening?" the inspector asked
quickly.</p>

<p>A subtle change in Anne's expression did not escape him. For one
moment her eyes wavered, then the girl said quietly:</p>

<p>"I came down for a few minutes. My head seemed to be worse and I
thought the air would do me good. I went out by the side door and
walked on the terrace."</p>

<p>"How long were you there?" The inspector's tone was sharper
now.</p>

<p>"Oh, not long. There were too many people about."</p>

<p>"Too many people," the inspector repeated. "Miss Courtenay, did
you meet Robert Saunderson?"</p>

<p>Suddenly Anne shivered from head to foot, but her voice was
steady enough as she answered:</p>

<p>"Certainly not. In fact, I do not think I went out until after
the time at which he--died."</p>

<p>The inspector apparently consulted his notebook again. Harbord,
watching, saw that his fingers were merely making meaningless
strokes, and wondered.</p>

<p>Anne waited too, her brown eyes looking scared.</p>

<p>The inspector drew out the crystal beads and held them up. "Have
you ever seen these before?"</p>

<p>"Why!" Anne uttered an exclamation of astonishment as she leaned
forward and took them in her hand. "They are just like some beads I
have that I am rather fond of. Where did you get them from?"</p>

<p>The inspector countered her question by another:</p>

<p>"Is this your chain, Miss Courtenay?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," Anne said decidedly. "I saw mine in my
dressing-case only a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>The inspector dropped his on the table.</p>

<p>"Would you allow me to see your chain, Miss Courtenay?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will." Anne got up. "I will fetch it at once."</p>

<p>The inspector opened the door for her and waited while she went
across the hall and ran lightly up the stairs.</p>

<p>At the top, in the wide corridor that led to the principal
rooms, she paused and her breath came quickly. She pressed her
handkerchief to her lips and when she brought it away there were
two little spots of blood upon it.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" she whispered to herself. "What can it
mean?"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Stoddart and Harbord did not speak. Their eyes met significantly
as she came back, dangling in her hand the crystal beads.</p>

<p>She laid them beside those the inspector had thrown down.</p>

<p>"You see they are really awfully alike. There is rather more
chain between each bead in mine, and the stones are cut
differently--and there is a bead missing in yours, look at the
gap--but you have to look very closely to see the difference."</p>

<p>"You do, indeed," said the inspector, holding up the two chains
together. "Does your chain break easily, Miss Courtenay?"</p>

<p>Anne's pale lips smiled.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I have never broken it, but I should think it
wouldn't be difficult to do so. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"I asked," the inspector said slowly, "because, as you see, this
one is broken, and three of the beads from this chain"--tapping
it--"were found in the pocket of Robert Saunderson's overcoat."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER 7</h2>

<p>"Saunderson's flat is on the ground floor," the inspector said
as he and Harbord paused before the Polchester Mansions--a new
palatial block in the immediate neighbourhood of Piccadilly. "It
has been locked up and the old housekeeper sent away, and Venables
has been on guard ever since last Friday, when we were summoned to
Holford. I fancy we shall find the clue to the mystery here."</p>

<p>"If there is one," Harbord interposed.</p>

<p>Stoddart raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Certainly there is one. It is scarcely like you to be so
pessimistic, Alfred."</p>

<p>"I ought to have said if there is one that can be found,"
Harbord corrected. "We are up against a criminal who knows how to
hide his traces. And really Saunderson might have been trying his
best to help him."</p>

<p>"Or her," the inspector interjected.</p>

<p>"Or her," Harbord acknowledged the correction. "I can't help
feeling, sir, that the clue, if there is one, is connected with
those crystal beads."</p>

<p>"Well, you may be right or you may be wrong," the inspector said
judicially as he led the way into the hall.</p>

<p>The porter touched his hat and the lift-boy stood in readiness.
The inspector passed them and turned up a couple of steps to a door
at the side. A man stood before it, easily recognizable as a
policeman in plain clothes. He saluted as the inspector took a key
from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Anything to report, Venables?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Nobody has been here but the postman. And he has only
been twice. Of course the housekeeper came just now. She said you
told her to be here to-day."</p>

<p>"I did," the inspector assented. "But of course she could not
get in. What has become of her?"</p>

<p>"She has gone down to the caretaker's, sir. I expect they are
having a good old gossip. I was to tell her when you wanted
her."</p>

<p>"Well, I think we will have a look round first," the inspector
said as he opened the door and glanced about him curiously.</p>

<p>The hall was luxuriously carpeted. The inspector raised his
eyebrows as he felt the softly padded divans at each side, and then
glanced into the two good-sized rooms, one on each side of the
door. Both were well furnished, one as a sitting-room, the other as
a bedroom. Behind were a small room evidently used for smoking, a
bathroom, and a kitchen which was scrupulously neat and tidy.</p>

<p>"Did himself well, Saunderson, I should say," the inspector
remarked. "No servants but the old housekeeper, apparently; but in
these service flats they do not want much waiting on."</p>

<p>"Servants might have been in the way sometimes," Harbord
grinned. "It might have been tolerably easy to manage the
housekeeper."</p>

<p>"Quite! Now I wonder where we had better begin. I think this
looks as if it had been the most used," turning into the
smoking-room.</p>

<p>A big, padded arm-chair, leather-covered, stood near the
electric fireplace; a square, solid-looking table beside it held an
open box of cigars and a jar of tobacco. There was an array of
pipes in a rack on the wall on the other side. On another table
against the wall was a tantalus, a couple of glasses, and a siphon
of seltzer water.</p>

<p>"Looks as if he expected to come back all right, poor chap,"
Harbord commented.</p>

<p>The inspector did not answer; his keen eyes were searching every
detail of the room and the furniture. At last he walked over to the
table against the wall and took up a small morocco leather box that
stood behind the tantalus.</p>

<p>"Locked, of course!"</p>

<p>He shook it, then he set it back on the table and took a
curious-looking little steel implement from his pocket and applied
himself to the task of forcing the lock. In a very few minutes it
was done and the box lay open before them.</p>

<p>The inspector pounced at once upon a small, thick book about the
size of a pass-book, labelled outside "Memorandum".</p>

<p>"Just what I was hoping for."</p>

<p>Then, while he was bending his brows over it, Harbord glanced
over the other contents of the box. They were a heterogeneous
collection: a bundle of old letters tied together, a cheque-book, a
couple of miniatures--a fine-looking man, a girl with a sweet
wistful face--then more letters; lastly a long envelope containing
an application for income-tax.</p>

<p>The inspector uttered a sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>"This memorandum-book tells a curious story. Listen, Alfred.
'Six hundred from Lady F. paid in to Usher &amp; Snell. Two fifty
Colonel O'Brady--Usher &amp; Snell.' And so it goes on. Different
sums paid in to Usher &amp; Snell, varied occasionally by 'Paid in
to account in Imperial and Overseas.' What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"Blackmail," Harbord said laconically.</p>

<p>"Quite!" the inspector agreed. "So much the different initials
make certain. But it is Usher &amp; Snell that I am thinking
of."</p>

<p>"Usher &amp; Snell!" Harbord repeated thoughtfully.
"Money-lenders, aren't they? I have heard of them, but--"</p>

<p>"Money-lenders and sharks," the inspector said emphatically.
"What I am asking myself now is, what was Saunderson's connexion
with them? Was he in their power or was he a member of the firm, or
connected with it? More probably the latter, I imagine,
though--"</p>

<p>"If he had borrowed from them as a young man and let the debt
accumulate, he would have found it a pretty hard job to get out of
their clutches," Harbord remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, he would," Stoddart assented. "But from what I have heard
of Saunderson I should suspect he was the spider, not the fly.
However, we must pay Messrs. Usher &amp; Snell a visit, then we
shall know more than we do now. At any rate, there can be no doubt
from this book that a great part of his income was derived from
blackmail. I'll just have a squint at the cheque-book now."</p>

<p>Harbord took up the memorandum-book while Stoddart turned the
counterfoils over rapidly.</p>

<p>"Business cheques these, all of 'em. One or two biggish ones to
Owler &amp; Vigors, the jewellers in Bond Street. Some of
Saunderson's lady friends doing him in the eye, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Several cheques paid in lately are from T," Harbord remarked.
"Paid in to Usher &amp; Snell, I mean. I wonder who T is? There is
one from C. C might stand for Courtenay."</p>

<p>"Also for Cox and Carter and a few others," the inspector
remarked sarcastically. "No use, Alfred. Things can't be fitted in
like that. That book is simply a record of blackmailing
transactions, and it probably supplies a motive for the crime. The
person blackmailed may have turned, like the proverbial worm, and
shot the blackmailer instead of paying up. I think we will take a
look at the bedroom now. There may be letters there." He led the
way across the hall. Harbord followed.</p>

<p>"Saunderson kept no man, you say, sir?"</p>

<p>"No. Just the one old housekeeper to look after things and see
to his breakfast. These are service flats, so he would manage all
right. I wish he had had a man, but we must see what the
housekeeper can tell us."</p>

<p>There was nothing of the Spartan about Saunderson evidently. His
bedroom, like the rest of the flat, was extremely well furnished.
The floor was softly carpeted, a big easy-chair stood by the
electric radiator, and the satin down quilt on the bed was almost
as thick as a French one.</p>

<p>The inspector went straight over to a small inlaid table near
the window.</p>

<p>"A blotter, by Jove! Just the thing I was looking for."</p>

<p>He took it up. There were no loose papers inside, but the
blotting-paper had the appearance of having been fairly well used.
He held a sheet up to the light. At first sight it was not easy to
read anything--it was written over and criss-crossed and blotted;
but at last he made out a few words--"And unless I receive it
before Monday--"</p>

<p>The rest was just a jumble of incoherencies. The inspector took
up the next sheet. "Not with you. You must--"</p>

<p>The other two sheets yielded even less.</p>

<p>"Yours sincerely, Robert Saunderson...yours faithfully, Robert
Saunderson...If Battledore..." That was all that could be made out.
And, though, such as it was, it went to confirm the inspector's
previous opinion, in itself it proved nothing.</p>

<p>"Not much good going on here," the inspector remarked. "We will
just go through to the sitting-room. And then perhaps we might have
a word with the people in the restaurant. They must have known
Saunderson fairly well."</p>

<p>The sitting-room was expensively furnished, but it seemed to
hold even less in the way of a clue to the mystery than the other
rooms. It had the appearance of a room rarely used; a bowl of faded
flowers stood on the table, a comfortable chesterfield in the
middle of the room appeared to have been little sat upon. There was
a low book-case under one of the windows, containing a number of
doubtful-looking French novels in garish covers. On the top of the
case stood a couple of Oriental vases, and the photograph in a
frame of beaten copper of a dark, handsome woman with unshingled
hair, in the fashion of a few years previously. The inspector
looked at it, then took it out of the frame and glanced at the
back.</p>

<p>"Taken at Southampton, and some time ago by the look of it," he
said as he set it down. "Well, she is not one of the ladies at
Holford Hall. So much is certain."</p>

<p>Harbord held out a letter.</p>

<p>"I found this in one of the dressing-table drawers."</p>

<p>The inspector drew his brows together as he got a whiff of the
patchouli which emanated from the paper.</p>

<p>"Beastly stuff! I wonder why women must put this stink on their
letters. It is a woman's writing, and I think I have seen it
before," glancing at the big square envelope. "Yes! Why, the
postmark is Holford!" He drew out the enclosure and read it aloud.
It was not dated and began abruptly. "He will be out from Friday to
Monday. Come by the rosery entrance and up to the side door and I
will let you in. Yours, M."</p>

<p>"M--Minnie, Lady Medchester," said the inspector. "Well, it
looks as if what London has been saying for some time--that the
gossip about Saunderson and Lady Medchester had a solid substratum
of fact." He glanced again at the postmark. "This Friday that she
speaks of is ten days before the murder. This makes one think. I
wonder whether Saunderson went. Anyhow, he can't tell us and I am
sure Lady Medchester won't. We shall have to make inquiries. But I
don't much like the look of things. It doesn't seem probable that
the man had two lady-loves at Holford; therefore, presumably he
went there on the day of his death to meet Lady Medchester."</p>

<p>"He may have had half a dozen--and the motive of the crime may
have been jealousy," Harbord hazarded.</p>

<p>The inspector drew in his lips. "Only one person was likely to
be jealous. Lady Medchester's meretricious charms are scarcely
likely to rouse any strong feeling nowadays, whatever they may have
been in her youth."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," Harbord said rather slowly, frowning as
he spoke. "But isn't there rather a snag there, sir? You see, this
note asks Saunderson to come down on the Friday because 'he' will
be out. Would she have asked him to come again on the evening of
the murder when presumably 'he' would be certain to be at home as
they had people coming to dinner as well as others staying in the
house?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem likely on the face of it," the inspector
agreed. "But we don't know what had happened. Something may have
turned up that made a second meeting imperative. I think--I rather
think we shall have to ask Lady Medchester for an explanation of
this letter."</p>

<p>"She will probably swear it isn't hers at all."</p>

<p>"I think the internal evidence shows plainly enough that it is.
But still"--the inspector regarded Harbord with an indulgent
smile--"I have no intention of going to her bald-headed with it
just at present. But now we will have a word with the
housekeeper."</p>

<p>The housekeeper, Mrs. Draper, came to them in the hall. She was
a tall, angular-looking woman, if, with big, dark eyes that had a
scared look in them as she glanced at the detectives.</p>

<p>"You sent for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I wanted to ask you a few questions." The inspector moved
a chair forward for her. "I shall keep you only a few minutes, Mrs.
Draper. I understand you have been some time with Mr.
Saunderson?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Draper passed her apron over the chair before she sat
down.</p>

<p>"Yes, a matter of three years and a half. And I am sorry you
gentlemen should come in to find the place all in a muddle and the
London dust over everything, getting in through every chink. But if
the flat being locked up directly I heard of poor Mr. Saunderson's
death I couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you couldn't," the inspector assented heartily. "And I
know what work is. I can see the place has been well looked after.
Now, Mrs. Draper, can you tell us what took Mr. Saunderson to
Holford?"</p>

<p>The housekeeper threw up her hands.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, I couldn't. I knew he was to be away the
night, for he said to me joking, like, when he went out--'You won't
see me till tomorrow morning, Mrs. Draper.' He never was one to
stay out all night without telling me, wasn't Mr. Saunderson. But,
as to where he went, that was another matter. You might have
knocked me down with a feather when I heard he had been killed at
Holford."</p>

<p>"Do you know of anyone that had a grudge against him?" the
inspector asked.</p>

<p>"Eh, no! That I don't." Mrs. Draper stared at him. "He was
always a pleasant, joking sort of man."</p>

<p>"You know of no quarrel of any kind? Now please do think well,
Mrs. Draper," the inspector said sternly as the woman stopped and
hesitated. "We must be quite sure about this."</p>

<p>"Well, there was a bit of unpleasantness between him and a young
gentleman a week or two ago," the housekeeper said unwillingly.
"But I am sure it meant nothing, and anyway it is all over
now."</p>

<p>The inspector produced his notebook.</p>

<p>"This young man's name, please."</p>

<p>"A very nice young gentleman he is," Mrs. Draper said with
emphasis. "Well, then"--as the inspector moved impatiently--"it was
Mr. Harold Courtenay. He was a friend of the master's, too, except
for that little quarrel, and that didn't last, for I heard them
part the best of friends last Monday. I heard Mr. Courtenay call
out 'So long, old chap!' as he went off."</p>

<p>"H'm!" The inspector produced the photograph he had found in the
sitting-room. "Mr. Saunderson was rather a man for the ladies,
wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Well, I never saw anything of it if he was," Mrs. Draper said,
pleating up the edge of her coat. "He didn't have ladies coming
here after him, or anything of that."</p>

<p>"Not even this lady?" said the inspector, holding up the
photograph.</p>

<p>Mrs. Draper's change of colour did not escape him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen that one," she said slowly. "I let her in
once. And I know she was here once more, anyhow. I heard her
talking. She had that loud kind of voice, you couldn't mistake
it."</p>

<p>"Did you hear her name?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did hear it, but not to remember it," Mrs. Draper said
doubtfully. "Something beginning with D it was. Miss De something
or other. I took the lady for an actress--or a music-hall
person."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, we must look that up," said the inspector, placing
the photograph in his pocket and producing the three beads found in
Saunderson's pocket. "Was the lady wearing anything if like this
when you let her in?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Draper hesitated. "I couldn't say, sir. She had a lot of
dangling things on--I know that; but I didn't look particular. I
couldn't say more than that."</p>

<p>The inspector looked disappointed as he replaced them in the
little box.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Draper, I must take your address, and you must
notify me of any change. I shall probably want to see you again
before long."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER 8</h2>

<p>"I shall never marry. I have changed my mind."</p>

<p>Anne Courtenay's tone was dull and lifeless. She was standing in
the little drawing-room of the cottage that had been General
Courtenay's home for years and stood on a corner of the estate that
had once been the Courtenays'. The cottage and the land surrounding
it was their last remaining possession. Anne was in mourning--just
a simple black frock that suited her fair skin to perfection. That
very morning General Courtenay had been laid to his rest, and his
old sister, saddened and broken, had returned to her home in
London. Anne was feeling lonely and frightened. Her eyes were
glancing round the room now as if she feared something that might
lurk amid the gathering shadows.</p>

<p>Opposite to her stood Michael Burford. The famous trainer was a
strong-looking man--strong-looking in both senses of the word. He
was not tall; he hardly reached middle height, but on his lithe,
muscular frame there was not one ounce of superfluous fat. His
lean, dark face was tanned nearly mahogany colour; against it his
steel-blue eyes had a startling, vivid effect. Meeting their glance
fully, it was easy to realize that here was a man of indomitable
determination, a man who would always conquer in a contest of
wills, whether of man or beast. In his training career Michael
Burford had been singularly successful. No horse of his ever became
sour. Burford's colts were never led on the course blinkered or
muzzled. Very early in their training they found they had met their
master, and the sooner they realized it and submitted the better
for them.</p>

<p>He was looking at Anne now, and as he watched her face and heard
her constantly reiterated words--"I shall never marry now"--there
was no anger in his eyes, only a great pity.</p>

<p>"Why have you changed your mind, Anne?" he questioned gently.
"Don't you think you owe it to me to give me some explanation?"</p>

<p>"I can't!" Anne raised her hands, then let them fall helplessly
to her sides. "It is just that I do not mean to marry anyone. That
I must be alone--always alone--as long as I live."</p>

<p>"Why?" The steel-blue eyes kept their watch on the set white
face. "I shall not release you, Anne," Michael Burford went on
quietly. "You have promised to marry me. I shall keep you to your
promise."</p>

<p>"You can't."</p>

<p>Anne's voice sounded as if she were tired--very, very tired. Her
eyes, swollen and dark-circled, looked as though they had wept
until they could weep no more. Her slim, young figure was bent as
if she had no strength in it. The pity in Burford's eyes
deepened.</p>

<p>"Is your love for me dead, then, Anne?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded, tried to speak, but the lie refused to come.
Her throat twitched convulsively; with a gesture of utter despair
she flung her hands before her eyes.</p>

<p>Burford watched her silently for a minute. Then he moved
nearer.</p>

<p>"Anne--"</p>

<p>With a moan she put out her hands as though to push him
away.</p>

<p>"Please--go. Don't you see that I can't--"</p>

<p>Very deliberately, in spite of her best efforts to avoid him,
Burford took one of the outstretched hands. It lay in his like a
lump of ice.</p>

<p>"Tell me why you have changed your mind, Anne."</p>

<p>"I--I can't," the girl said miserably. "It is just that I have
changed, that is all. People do, you know," steadying her voice
with a supreme effort.</p>

<p>Michael Burford laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"They do, I know. But you haven't, Anne." He had captured both
hands now. "You belong to me, you are mine. I will never let you
go. I am going to marry you at once and carry you right away home
to East Molton. Is that what you are afraid of, dear? Of Anne
Courtenay becoming Michael Burford the trainer's wife?" Anne tried
to free her hands from his.</p>

<p>"No! A thousand times no!" she cried passionately. "I must go
right away--away from every one I know--where no one ever sees me."
As she spoke she wrenched her hands from Burford's grasp and
clasped them in front of her.</p>

<p>"Always in my dreams I see them, staring, watching every
movement. Never, never can I get away. Oh, the world is all
eyes--everywhere there are eyes!"</p>

<p>"I will take you away from them." Michael Burford spoke very
gravely. "You shall never be lonely or frightened again, Anne. It
is very safe at East Molton. No one will worry you there. Just we
two in the house and the horses and men outside. We will go for
long gallops over the moors, the winds that come down clean and
fresh from the north shall blow the cobwebs from our brains, and
you shall be strong and brave again."</p>

<p>Some of the terror faded from Anne's eyes. Only she, and Heaven,
knew how she longed for the home, the peace thus pictured. She had
dreamt of other careers before she was engaged--sometimes she had
thought of the stage; she had been well spoken of as an amateur
actress; but now--now she dared not face an audience, not knowing
how much people guessed, how much they knew. East Molton looked
like a paradise of peace and rest to her. Yet, she asked herself,
would she really be safe there? Would she really be safe
anywhere?</p>

<p>Burford saw the softening in her eyes and his face
brightened.</p>

<p>"You will come, Anne? You will let me take you away now, at
once?"</p>

<p>Suddenly the frozen calm of Anne's face broke up, big tears
welled up in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I--I can't. I daren't."</p>

<p>"Daren't!" Burford repeated. "That is not a word for your
father's daughter, Anne."</p>

<p>"Ah!" In spite of her tears Anne held up her head now. "It is
because of him that I am afraid. You do not know--"</p>

<p>"No." Burford's tone was very grave now. "I do not know perhaps,
but suppose I guess. Harold--"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Anne backed against the wall. "You shall not guess. It
was not Harold. It was I--"</p>

<p>There was a dawning comprehension now in Burford's eyes.</p>

<p>"Anne, I think I do know. Saunderson--"</p>

<p>"No, no!" With a hoarse cry the girl shrank from him. She pushed
herself back, her hands held out to keep him off. "You shall not,"
she panted. "I tell you, you shall not guess!"</p>

<p>"No, I will not guess," Burford said very quietly. "Because you
are going to tell me yourself, Anne. Because I know--I have known
all along that you were out the night that Saunderson died."</p>

<p>"What!" Anne's eyes were full of terror. She seemed to shrivel
up literally beneath his gaze. "How--how could you know?" she
stammered.</p>

<p>"I saw you coming in," he said gravely. "I went over to Holford
on some business with Lord Medchester, and then Captain Williamson,
who has a colt with me, came there after me. We were in the library
and the window was wide open, for it was a hot night, and I saw
you."</p>

<p>"And Captain Williamson?" Anne questioned breathlessly.</p>

<p>"He didn't see you. He was looking the other way. And he would
not have known you. I could see only a tall figure in black, but
you could not deceive me, Anne."</p>

<p>"Then--then--if you saw that," Anne spoke with difficulty, "you
know--you know why--"</p>

<p>"I know why--what?"</p>

<p>"Why I cannot marry you--why I cannot marry anyone?" Very
haltingly the words came now.</p>

<p>A sudden flame leapt into the blue eyes watching her.</p>

<p>"I see why you should marry me," Burford said steadily. "I mean
to take care of you, Anne. You can trust me."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" the stammering voice said brokenly. "But I can bring
you shame--disgrace--"</p>

<p>"I can stand them if I have you, Anne, beside me." There was no
hesitation in his tone. "But why didn't you come to me before,
Anne? Why didn't you let me help you instead?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Anne broke in with sudden passion. "I did not--I did
not--you do believe me, Michael?"</p>

<p>"I believe in you as I do in God Himself," Burford returned.
Eyes and voice were as steady as ever. "Saunderson deserved his
fate, Anne, though you had no part in it. But--Harold--?"</p>

<p>"I don't know--I don't know!" Anne moaned. "But I am
frightened--so frightened, Michael."</p>

<p>There was a tender look in Burford's eyes as he watched her.
"But now you must not be frightened any more. I am going to take
care of you--"</p>

<p>But with a cry Anne shrank from him.</p>

<p>"You can't, you can't! Nobody can. He--we must just go on to the
end. And then--oh, God help us then!"</p>

<p>"Anne!" With a quick forward movement Burford captured her
hands. "What do you mean? Do you think that Harold--?"</p>

<p>Anne interrupted him with a cry.</p>

<p>"I don't think--I daren't think. Only I am afraid--afraid of
everything."</p>

<p>"You will not be afraid with me at East Molton," Burford said
with a certainty that was in itself reassuring. "And by and by when
you are strong enough to tell me all, I think we shall be able to
help Harold. I have faith in your brother, Anne."</p>

<p>"You don't know--everything," the girl said with difficulty. "I
did not think--I never believed--that Harold would do what he has
done. But now--now, I just don't know. I don't feel--sure of
anybody--not even myself."</p>

<p>Michael Burford smiled. "I do. Of you both. And I am going to
prove it to the world by marrying you, Anne. We will never rest
till the truth about Saunderson's death is known. And then--and
then I won't even say I told you so."</p>

<p>"You--you can't!" Anne said brokenly. "Nobody can help!"</p>

<p>"We will get help," Burford returned positively. "Truth will
out. And now--when will you marry me, Anne?"</p>

<p>"I haven't said I will marry you at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have. And you are going to." Burford gave the
hands he held a little shake. "As soon as I can get the licence,
Anne. Say yes!"</p>

<p>"It--it doesn't seem any use saying no," the girl said
quaveringly.</p>

<p>"It isn't," Burford agreed as he drew her to him. "Not one bit
of good, my dear."</p>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER 9</h2>

<p>"Well, I have ascertained one thing for certain," Stoddart
exclaimed as the train steamed out of St. Pancras. He had just
arrived on the platform at the last minute and managed to spring
into the compartment where Harbord was impatiently awaiting him.
"How did you manage to get the carriage to yourself, Alfred?"</p>

<p>"Tipped the guard pretty extensively," Harbord answered
laconically. "I knew it would be money well laid out."</p>

<p>Stoddart nodded.</p>

<p>"May save time when we get to Derby. I have interviewed Messrs.
Usher &amp; Snell. I had some difficulty in getting what I wanted
from them. Began to sympathize with the dentists before I had
finished. But at last they caved in and I became fulsomely anxious
to give me all the information I wanted. Saunderson was a partner
in the firm, though his name did not appear. In fact, he seems to
have been more than a partner. I fancy he was the leading spirit in
the whole affair. Practically he <i>was</i> Usher &amp; Snell. But
of his blackmailing Messrs. Usher &amp; Snell professed entire
ignorance. The sums of money which his pass-book shows makes it
evident he was constantly paying in to their account were used
mainly in the transactions of the firm, which of course required a
large amount of capital. Saunderson also held quantities of shares
in many foreign undertakings in the name of Usher &amp; Snell. So,
you see, the motive for the murder may have been supplied in as
many different quarters as that interesting firm had clients, to
say nothing of his blackmailing transactions. Of course the
knowledge he acquired as the head of Usher &amp; Snell as well as
anything he picked up as a man about town was used to put the screw
on the unfortunate beggars. Oh, there is no doubt that Saunderson
was one of the biggest scoundrels unhung, and whoever potted him
did the world a damned good turn. It goes to my heart to try to
track the poor beggar down."</p>

<p>"Still, it wouldn't do to allow people to take the law into
their own hands," Harbord argued. "Even a money-lender has his
rights."</p>

<p>"And a blackmailer!" the inspector assented. "Well said,
Harbord. Always remember you stand for British justice."</p>

<p>Harbord did not reply. For a minute or two he watched the flying
landscape with unseeing eyes. At last he said:</p>

<p>"If it was one of Usher &amp; Snell's clients that did
Saunderson in, I shall never understand why they should have
followed him down to Holford."</p>

<p>Stoddart looked at him.</p>

<p>"As I have said before, I don't agree with you. Unless one is
tempted off the beaten track, London is the safest place in the
world. Besides, there are wheels within wheels. Saunderson had a
decent colt or two in training at Oxley. They are expected to do
well as three-year-olds. One of them, Mayfair, runs for next year's
Derby. It may have been to some one's interest to get rid of
Saunderson and render Mayfair's nomination void. Certainly it
doesn't seem much of a motive, but then half the murders that are
committed are for such very slight motives that one marvels how any
sane man or woman could risk his or her neck for such
trivialities."</p>

<p>"I suppose they always think they will not be found out,"
Harbord observed meditatively. "But if the criminal is a man in
this case where do the crystal beads come in? The chain must have
broken and the links must have fallen into Saunderson's pocket when
those letters were thrown out, and when, it seems to me, that some
paper was searched for and presumably found and taken away. Now who
could have gone through the pockets but the murderer?"</p>

<p>"Several people," the inspector said sharply.</p>

<p>"The men who found the body, for instance, or quite possibly an
earlier visitor. Though that wouldn't explain them, if one accepts
Superintendent Mayer's statement that the beads were not in the
pocket when he first arrived on the scene."</p>

<p>"I don't accept it," Harbord said bluntly.</p>

<p>"How should the beads get there afterwards?"</p>

<p>"There was the interval when the superintendent went to the
barn," the inspector went on, "but only of a few minutes. If it was
done then there must have been somebody on the watch--which doesn't
seem likely. Also, whoever might have been watching would have
known Mayer had searched the pockets and removed any papers."</p>

<p>Harbord shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"And here is another question for you," the inspector went on.
"If your theory is correct, and the three beads dropped into
Saunderson's pocket when his assailant was getting out the letter
or the paper the possession of which was the motive for the murder,
what did the woman do with the rest of the chain?"</p>

<p>"It must have been broken when the beads caught in the lining of
the pocket, and I suppose the other piece fell off."</p>

<p>"Well, it didn't fall where it was found, in the middle of the
rhododendrons at the side of the Dutch garden," the inspector
returned. "The murderess assuredly did not attempt to push her way
through that hedge. No, the chain was thrown there. That is a
certainty."</p>

<p>"But who could have thrown it?" Harbord speculated. "The woman
who wore it, whoever she was, would not have thrown her chain away;
even the silliest of 'em would have realized that it would
certainly be found, and might be a clue that would lead to her
discovery."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a book," the inspector commented. "No, certainly
the woman who wore that chain did not throw it away in the bushes.
And I do not agree with you that Saunderson was shot by a woman. I
fancy we shall find that the motive was either jealousy or the
getting out of Saunderson's blackmailing clutches. And I am
strongly of opinion that Superintendent Mayer was right and that
there were no beads in the pocket when it was searched. But how
they got there any more than the rest of the chain got among the
rhododendrons I am not prepared to say. It's a nasty case, simple
as it looks, and there'll be wigs on the green before we have
cleared it up. But I have got something--in fact, two things--here
that may interest you, though at the same time they do not appear
to have any particular bearing on the case."</p>

<p>He took up a paper that he had thrown upon the seat beside him
and turned it over. Harbord watched him curiously.</p>

<p>"Here it is," Stoddart said at last. "In the society news. It is
headed 'Romance of the Racing World.' 'Mr. Michael Burford, second
son of the late Sir William Burford, of Burleet, and Miss Anne
Frances Courtenay, only daughter of the late Captain Harold William
Courtenay, V.C., and granddaughter of the late General Courtenay,
were married, very quietly on account of the bride's mourning, at
St. John's, Downmouth, last Saturday. Mr. Michael Burford has made
himself a name as a trainer, and Miss Courtenay belongs to a
well-known racing family. The bride was given away by her brother,
Mr. Harold Courtenay, and directly after the ceremony the
newly-married couple left for North Cornwall where the honeymoon
will be spent.'"</p>

<p>"Miss Courtenay!" Harbord said doubtfully. "I thought she was
rather pat with her crystal chain. She knows or suspects something,
I am certain."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe," the inspector assented. "Possibly she saw Lady
Medchester go out and come in that night. You remember they both
had headaches and were prowling about apparently. But"--he paused
and looked out of the window silently for a minute--"one point in
favour of the people at Holford is this. Not one of the people I
have questioned has a satisfactory alibi. An alibi is the easiest
thing in the world to fake, and the least satisfactory of defences.
When I find a suspect with a nice watertight alibi I generally
devote a little special attention in that direction. But you have
not seen my second paragraph." He turned to another page of his
paper. "Here it is. 'Fatal Accident to the Hon. James Courtenay.
Sudden Death of Lord Gorth. The Hon. James Courtenay, only son of
the fifth Lord Gorth, met with a fatal accident while riding in the
Home Park at Gorth yesterday; his horse put its foot in a
rabbit-hole and pitched forward. Mr. Courtenay was thrown on his
head, and his neck was broken. Death must have been instantaneous.
He was unmarried. When the sad news was conveyed to Lord Gorth, who
had been in a delicate state of health since the death of his wife
last year, he collapsed and passed away of heart failure in a
couple of hours. The new peer is Mr. Harold Courtenay, grandson of
General Courtenay, of Afghan fame, who died on the 14th of last
month, and who was the first cousin of the fifth lord. The father
of the new Lord Gorth was the late Captain Harold William
Courtenay, V.C., who was killed at Ypres. The new Lord Gorth is
twenty-three years of age and, like his cousin, is unmarried. His
only sister is the Miss Anne Frances Courtenay whose marriage to
Mr. Michael Burford, the well-known trainer, is reported in another
column.' There!" said the detective, slapping down the paper.
"That's that."</p>

<p>"It's very interesting," Harbord said dryly. "But it doesn't
affect our case much, does it, sir?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," the inspector said slowly. "I really don't know,
but I fancy it will all work in. At any rate, neither the new Lord
Gorth nor his sister likes being questioned with regard to the
tragedy. I am afraid, too, that I shall have to intrude upon the
honeymoon to interview Mr. Michael Burford."</p>

<p>When the train drew up at Medchester and the detectives stepped
out, the first person they saw on the platform was Superintendent
Mayer. His broad, red face was shining with excitement as he made
his way to them.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you'm coom back, inspector," he said, his Loamshire
accent growing broader as he spoke. "I ha' got something for you
this time."</p>

<p>"What is it?" questioned the inspector. "Or who is it?" with a
quick glance at the superintendent's perspiring face.</p>

<p>"Well"--the superintendent cast a quick glance round--"it is one
of those poaching fellows, an' he--But maybe it will be best for
you to hear what he has to say for yourself. He came to me at the
police station an hour ago."</p>

<p>"You are holding him?"</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded. "I am that, till you've heard what he
has to say."</p>

<p>"We'll get off at once," the inspector said, beckoning to
Harbord.</p>

<p>It was but a step to the police station. Stoddart was a quick
walker and the stout superintendent had much ado to keep up with
him.</p>

<p>A constable stood at the door. The superintendent led the way to
his office.</p>

<p>"I heard this chap, Garwood by name, had been talking in the
village," he said as he opened the door, "so I sent for him. But
you shall question him for yourself."</p>

<p>Garwood sat on the edge of a chair set as close to the door as
possible. He lurched heavily to his feet as the detectives entered.
At first sight there was nothing prepossessing about the gentleman.
He was a short, thin man with a narrow face, none too clean, and
adorned with several days' growth of stubbly beard; his small, dark
eyes were set under heavy, overhanging brows, and the eyes
themselves were cunning-looking and had a trick of glancing
obliquely at anybody or anything in their line of vision. They were
so glancing at the inspector now as Mr. Garwood twisted a greasy
fur cap about in his hands uneasily.</p>

<p>"Now, Bill Garwood," the superintendent said briskly, "I want
you to tell these gentlemen what you told me."</p>

<p>Garwood cleared his throat noisily and drew the back of his hand
across his mouth.</p>

<p>"Taint much as I can tell," he said hoarsely. "An'--an if it
gets me into trouble I looks to you gents to see me out."</p>

<p>"We will look after you," the inspector said reassuringly.
"Come, my man, tell us your tale, and then, superintendent, I dare
say that man of yours would step across to the 'Arms' and get us a
tankard of ale."</p>

<p>Garwood's eyes began to shine as he glanced from one to the
other.</p>

<p>"There won't be any need for that," the superintendent broke in,
whereat Garwood's face fell. "I ha' a good tap in the house; since
these 'ere confounded temperance folks got the upper hand, 'tis the
only thing to be done, to keep a barrel on the premises."</p>

<p>"Ay, it is that," Garwood growled. "Wring all their blasted
teetotallers' necks, I would."</p>

<p>Stoddart laughed. "I'm afraid there are a good many others of
your way of thinking, Mr. Garwood. But now will you tell us what
you know of that night when Mr. Saunderson was shot?"</p>

<p>"There ain't much as I do know," the man said sulkily, shuffling
his feet about. "And afore I begin, I must tell you gents as I'm a
pore man, a pore man I ha' always been with a sickly wife an' a
heap of chillen allus with open mouths cryin' out for somethin' to
fill 'em. It's hard lines on a father when he sees the things
running about wild as would save his chillen's lives, an' him not
allowed to touch 'em."</p>

<p>"It must be," the inspector agreed sympathetically. "I think I
see now, Mr. Garwood. You were trying to pick up one or two of
those same wild things?"</p>

<p>"I were," Mr. Garwood assented, his shifty eyes turning about
from the inspector's eyes to the superintendent's. "Just a rabbit
or two, you understand. The missis, she weren't not to say well,
nor one o' the kids, and there were no work going."</p>

<p>"I--I quite see," the inspector murmured.</p>

<p>Moistening his lips, Garwood proceeded:</p>

<p>"I were in the paddock just looking round. I ha' often picked up
a fat rabbit there, an' I see a man come along in a car. He stops
it--parks it, as they calls it--on that there bit o' waste ground
by the west lodge, like. Well, then he come out and goes in the
blue doors and across the bit o' the park to the rosery. I began to
think as there might be money in it, for there's been a deal of
talk goin' about her ladyship in the village, so I went after him,
keeping my distance, you see. An' he jumped the railings an' went
on, not into the rosery, but into the bit o' waste ground beyond. I
went after him an' then found I was not the only one. It had been
raining, but now the moon were shining out like, an' I could see
the gentleman I come after quite plain; right across the grounds he
went, as if he knowed his way, but there were some one else as I
couldn't get proper, right among the bushes. I could hear a kind of
rustling, as if somebody was trying to walk quietly in among the
rhododendrons, side o' the flower garden. I waited where I was,
an'--"</p>

<p>"If anyone wanted to follow Mr. Saunderson they would have done
much better to keep out of the bushes and walk along the grass,"
the inspector interrupted.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," Garwood said slowly. "The moon were fairly
bright just then an' him as they was after would ha' bin safe to
see anyone as walked on the grass. I didn't dare go any nearer
myself. An' I went on, keepin' on the walk at the bottom of the
clearin' that brings you out through another of them little gates
on to the pine grove, and then if you turn to the right you come to
the old quarry where the pheasants are. I didn't mean to do nothin'
to them--'tain't likely. But I thought as I might come across a
rabbit--one o' those white ones his lordship sets such store by
maybe--an' it 'ud make a bit o' stew for the chillen. But I found
'tweren't such an easy job as I thought. There was a party on at
the hall, an' there was footmen and such-like strollin' about in
the pinetum, so I turned back; as I passes the clearing again I
looks up, but there weren't no one about and nothin' to be seen.
But it were drizzlin' o' rain an' the moon had gone in, an' I
stopped a minute agin the rosery gate. While I was standin' there
in the shadow some one come runnin' out o' the clearin' fast as she
could go like as some bogle was after her."</p>

<p>Garwood stopped.</p>

<p>"Go on." The inspector drew a deep breath. "Who was it? Man or
woman?"</p>

<p>"I could do with a drop o' that there beer now, guv'nor. 'Tis
dry work goin' on like this on your lone. I dunno how t' parsons
does it, but maybe they keeps a drop i' th' vestry."</p>

<p>The superintendent opened the door and beckoned to a
subordinate, who presently appeared with a foaming jug of beer and
a couple of glasses. The superintendent pushed them towards
Garwood.</p>

<p>"Help yourself."</p>

<p>The man's eyes shone. "That's the stuff," he said greedily.</p>

<p>"Well, get a move on," the inspector said impatiently. "Who was
this other person, man or woman?"</p>

<p>Garwood took a mighty draught. "I feel a bit better now, mister.
About this 'ere person. I understands there might be money in
it."</p>

<p>"There might be jail in it if you don't speak out quick, Bill
Garwood," the superintendent said sharply.</p>

<p>"You needn't be so down on a chap," Garwood grumbled. "I see who
it was plain enough, for the moon were trying to shine again.
'Twere her ladyship plain enough, cuttin' along she were, too, an'
cryin'. I see her plain when she pulled the gate open."</p>

<p>"Did you see any more of the man who went in before you?"</p>

<p>"No-a. I did not; he'd disappeared like." He took another drink
of beer. "I wor a-wonderin' how I should do the best for myself out
o' what I'd seen."</p>

<p>"Did you see anyone else?" the inspector asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Garwood scratched his head.</p>

<p>"No-a, I dunner think as 'ow I did. Only 'er ladyship--I'd swear
to 'er all right, but I couldn't tell you any more not if you kep'
me 'ere all day, gents.'</p>

<p>"I am sure you have told us a great deal, Mr. Garwood," the
inspector said politely. "And, now, I am sure you will understand
that there must be no talking or gossiping about what you saw that
night. You will be wanted later."</p>

<p>"I unnerstand." The man got on his feet and stood turning his
cap about. "Ain't there no reward given for me tellin' you all this
what happened that there night?"</p>

<p>"There is no reward offered at present," the inspector answered,
glancing at his case-book.</p>

<p>"Then I calls it a shame," Garwood said truculently. "I'd ha'
kep' my mouth shut if I'd ha' known--'er ladyship might ha' paid me
to do that. A man's got his wife and chillen to think of. I've
allus heard there was reward given for them as helped to find out
who done things."</p>

<p>"For them as helped to find out who done things--" the inspector
repeated. "I don't think you have quite done that, my man. But, as
you say, there are rewards--sometimes. There are also punishments
if a man is mistaken, or people think he is. I fancy Lord
Medchester might remember that."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10</h2>

<p>The stable at East Molton was well known in the racing world. It
had been bought from a famous North Country trainer by Sir William
Burford for his younger son. A farm-house in the immediate vicinity
which had served as a residence for his predecessor had been
altered and improved by Michael Burford, for his bride, almost
beyond recognition.</p>

<p>A big semicircle of lawn in front big enough for croquet or
tennis had a drive running round to the door, which was flanked on
each side by big stone vases filled with different flowers in their
season. At the back of the house ran a low terrace with a stone
balustrade. What had been the farmyard in the old days was now a
wide, flagged court; on the other side of it were the loose boxes
and the stables that housed Burford's precious charges. On the west
side of the house and stables was the paddock and the loose rails
where much of Burford's work was done. Beyond that again stretched
the moor where the morning gallops were taken. The grooms and
stable-boys were housed near the stables.</p>

<p>It seemed a very harbour of refuge to Anne Burford as she stood
on the steps at the front door. Though she had only been at East
Molton a week, already her eyes had lost much of their frightened
look. Her nerves, too, were steadier; no longer did she start and
glance round nervously at the faintest sound. Surely, she said to
herself, she would be safe here, safe and forgotten--no sign of any
other house was in sight. And, though every now and then some sound
from the busy life of the stable reached her ears, it was all
pleasant and familiar and home-like. As she stood there, rejoicing
in the peace of her surroundings, there came to her no premonition
of how short-lived it was to be--no faintest suspicion that even
now it was at an end.</p>

<p>The white gate at the end of the drive banged noisily. Anne
looked up. Some one--a woman--was coming towards her. As the
new-comer drew nearer, she saw that it was a tall girl, well, even
fashionably, dressed. As Anne glimpsed the red hair, peeping out
from the small pull-on hat in curls over each ear, noted the small
white face, looking almost too small for the big blue eyes, she had
a sense of familiarity, a certainty that somewhere she had
encountered that distinctly hostile gaze before.</p>

<p>Anne felt an odd desire to run away, to refuse to see this girl
whose lips were smiling, though her eyes looked hard and
defiant.</p>

<p>But Anne's desire was hardly definite enough to have become an
intention, and it was frustrated. Her visitor did not trouble to go
round by the walk, but came straight across the lawn to her.</p>

<p>"I expect you don't remember me, Mrs. Burford. And yet I know
your brother so well that I don't feel like a stranger to you," she
said in a slow, drawling voice that roused some faint memory in
Anne. "I thought you wouldn't remember me," the drawling voice went
on. "But I am going over to East Molton to see, I said to Minnie
Medchester. I am spending a few days at Holford, you know. I am
Sybil Stainer, Maurice Stainer's sister. You will have heard Harold
speak of me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard Harold speak of you," Anne found herself
repeating mechanically. An icy fear gripped her heart, paralysed
her. Certain memories were coming back to her: the red-haired girl
who had been with Harold in the paddock looking at the St. Leger
horses; the voice, Saunderson's voice--what had he said?--"The
Stainers are bad companions for Harold. The man is a spend-thrift,
a rotter, and the girl--well, the less said about her the better."
And now this same girl stood before her smiling impudently in her
face.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you are going to ask me in?" Miss Stainer
proceeded with a laugh and a slight forward movement.</p>

<p>Instinctively Anne stepped aside.</p>

<p>The other apparently accepted this as an invitation to enter.
She walked in and gazed round the wide, low hall with interest. The
quiet austerity of it, the dark-panelled walls, the old oak chest
and settle appealed to her as little as did the polished floor and
the faded colours of the prayer rug in the centre.</p>

<p>"Your house looks pretty highbrow considering all things," she
remarked. "I shouldn't have thought this would be the style of
thing Mike Burford would go in for."</p>

<p>Anne was not inclined to be effusive with her unwelcome visitor,
but she did not want Sybil Stainer there in the hall when any
minute Michael might appear, with some of the men who were
continually coming to see him on business.</p>

<p>She opened the door of the drawing-room, the prettiest room in
the house in her eyes. Like most of the house it was panelled. The
big windows and the glass door on to the lawn occupied most of one
side of the room; a piece of tapestry hung at the end opposite the
fireplace. There was a big modern chesterfield and a couple of
capacious armchairs and an old spinet stood near the fireplace. For
the rest the chairs and tables were plain and solid, and the short
curtains were of blue casement cloth. There were no knick-knacks or
pictures, but a great pink chrysanthemum stood in one corner and a
log fire burned cheerily on the well hearth.</p>

<p>"Now, this is something like!" Miss Stainer remarked, going up
to the fire and holding out her hands to the blaze. "There's a tidy
breeze coming across the moor, and I hadn't got my fur coat on. I
found it pretty cold walking up."</p>

<p>"Why did you walk up?" Mrs. Burford's tone was not
encouraging.</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to see you. I've told you so, and I thought on
the whole it would be as well we should have our first interview
without any third person," Miss Stainer returned with a loud laugh.
"At least that was why I came to that little one-eyed station of
yours. As for walking up--well, there weren't exactly any taxi-cabs
about. I got an old motor-bus that set me down at a deserted hole
they called the Four Corners. I rather hurried off, for I knew if
she had any idea where I was coming Minnie Medchester would have
insisted on sending me over in the car, and perhaps have come over
with me, and that might have been a little awkward, don't you think
so?" She drew one of the big easy chairs up to the fire as she
spoke and dropped into it. "You see, I am making myself at home,
Mrs. Burford."</p>

<p>Anne herself did not sit down, did not move nearer that cheerful
blaze on the hearth. She looked with unsmiling, sombre eyes at the
insolently defiant face opposite.</p>

<p>"Why did you come at all?" she asked, her hands clasped together
before her, gripping one another tightly as she waited for the
answer.</p>

<p>Miss Stainer's lips, red with lipstick, smiled on still, but the
menace in the blue eyes grew more definite.</p>

<p>"It isn't very friendly of you to ask that, Mrs. Burford." The
hard voice was growing softer now, a silkier note was creeping into
it that somehow made Anne shiver more than the hardness.</p>

<p>"I came because I wanted to tell you a certain bit of news
myself. Harold would have written, but I said, 'No, better let me
go, woman to woman--we shall understand one another better,' I
said. Don't you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Anne said dully. The icy fear that had gripped
her heart a few minutes ago had her in its clutches now body and
soul together.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think we shall," Miss Stainer said confidently, in that
new purring voice of hers. "We really must, you know, because"--her
eyelids flickered--"I am engaged to Harold. We shall be sisters,
you and I." She looked down with an affectation of coyness.</p>

<p>"Never!" The words burst from Anne's white I lips. "You shall
not!" she cried. "I will stop it. I--"</p>

<p>"How?" questioned Miss Stainer softly, yet with the ring of
steel beneath the softness. Somehow the fact that she was sitting
down while Anne stood, instead of placing her at a disadvantage,
seemed to put her in a position of authority.</p>

<p>"How will you stop our marriage?" she inquired again. "Harold
has always been fond of me. He is a friend of my brother's.
Formerly he had no money to marry on, no position, but now
everything is altered. Isn't it natural that he should stick to his
old love?"</p>

<p>"He shall not marry you," Anne reiterated.</p>

<p>Miss Stainer's eyes narrowed like those of a cat about to
strike. "I think he will. I fancy you will not be able to prevent
it. No, the only thing for you to do now is to bow to the
inevitable. You are going to tell people you are delighted with the
engagement. You are going to ask me to stay with you so that you
may become better acquainted with your future sister-in-law."</p>

<p>"What!" Anne laughed scornfully. "Certainly you are not going to
stay here. What do you suppose my husband would say if I suggested
such a thing?"</p>

<p>Miss Stainer shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest idea. Wouldn't he think it the most
natural thing in the world that you should ask your brother's
fiance to pay you a visit?"</p>

<p>"It would depend on the fiance," Anne said with brutal
frankness. "In this case you must remember that my husband knows
you."</p>

<p>"Ah! So he does--poor Mike Burford!" Stainer said with a
slightly contemptuous accent that brought the blood hotly scarlet
to Anne's cheeks, a flush that ebbed as swiftly as it came as the
cruel voice went on: "Then perhaps--why not?--it will be best to
tell him the truth." The amusement in the cold blue eyes grew and
strengthened. "Who was it said the truth is always the safest?" the
mocking voice went on. "Shall we try it? Will you tell him? What do
you say?"</p>

<p>"Say?" Anne cried with sudden passion. "Say I would die
first."</p>

<p>"Ah, die!" Miss Stainer said softly in that slow, drawling
voice. "We all say we should like to die when everything does not
turn out just as we have planned it should. But there are different
ways of dying. Have you ever thought of them, Mrs. Burford?" She
put up her hands and clasped her firm white throat. "One way is to
have something tight put round here--to choke and choke and never
get one's breath. It must be pretty bad that. And they do hang a
lot of people nowadays. And a man wouldn't like to have his
brother-in-law hanged."</p>

<p>"Stop!" Anne raised her clasped hands above her head, then
brought them down heavily.</p>

<p>For a second the girl before her quailed; then in a moment she
recovered herself.</p>

<p>"So I think he might wish you to welcome your sister-in-law,
Mrs. Burford."</p>

<p>Anne pulled herself together. After all, she told herself, this
girl must be talking at random. It was--it must be--the merest
guess-work.</p>

<p>"I cannot prevent my brother doing what he likes," she said
quietly, "but I can at least choose my own friends."</p>

<p>"Your own friends!" Miss Stainer laughed; aloud. "I don't want
your friendship," she said scornfully. "I should probably be bored
to extinction. But I don't mean to marry a man and have his family
look down on me. So you had better make up your mind to accept me
as Harold's wife without any more bother. You will have to do it in
the end whether you like it or not."</p>

<p>Anne did not speak. One look she gave the sneering face before
her--a look that spoke of contempt unutterable. Then her eyes
dropped. She turned towards the door.</p>

<p>Miss Stainer's face went faintly red beneath its powder. She
stood up. For a moment she looked as if she were going to pass
Anne, to go out of the house. Then she stopped, she gazed straight
into the white, haughty face before her and said in a voice that
shook with anger:</p>

<p>"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good. Saunderson's death was
a godsend--to somebody! Wasn't it, Mrs. Burford?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11</h2>

<p>"'Pon my soul, Minnie, I can't understand you." Lord Medchester
stared at his wife I and then rubbed his domed forehead with his
hands, forgetful of the fact that he had no hair. His baldness was
a continual marvel to Lord Medchester.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester sighed. It was obvious in spite of her make-up
that she had grown considerably paler of late. She was thinner,
too, and her eyes had a haunted, terrified look as she gazed
round.</p>

<p>"How much longer is this girl Stainer going to stay here?" Lord
Medchester pursued.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester did not look at him; she turned her head
away.</p>

<p>"Oh, not long. She is going on to Anne very soon."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether Burford will stand her," his lordship
commented.</p>

<p>"Well, she is going to marry Harold," Lady Medchester said
gravely.</p>

<p>Her husband shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Because Harold is going to make a fool of himself is no reason
for the rest of the world to put up with her. I should have thought
you, and Anne too, would have been moving heaven and earth to
prevent such a disastrous marriage. The girl's a rotter if ever I
saw one."</p>

<p>Still Lady Medchester did not look at him. Her eyes, gazing
straight through the window, watched the tall rhododendrons at the
side of the Dutch garden; the group of pines beyond that stood
round the summer-house where Robert Saunderson was murdered.</p>

<p>"You are not fair to her," she said in a muffled tone. "She is
not a bad sort, Sybil."</p>

<p>"Isn't she?" his lordship scoffed unbelievingly. "Then I don't
know a bad one when I see her. That's all there is to that. Who's
paying for all these clothes she's buying?"</p>

<p>Lady Medchester gave an affected little laugh.</p>

<p>"How funny you are, Medchester. How should I know? Her brother,
I should imagine."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't, then," his lordship retorted bluntly.
"Stainer's pretty well down on his uppers, I can tell you that. The
girl couldn't squeeze a penny out of him."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps the tradespeople are giving her credit as she is
going to marry a rich man. I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, I do," Lord Medchester returned.</p>

<p>"Rich man, indeed! Let me tell you that Harold will be a lucky
fellow if he manages to turn himself round this next year. These
damned death-duties take every penny you have. It's bad enough when
the estates pass from father to son. But when it's a matter of
cousins about six times removed such as Harold and old Lord Gorth,
why it is a case of skinning the eel. But I can't believe Harold
will make such a fool of himself as to marry Sybil Stainer
yet."</p>

<p>"I am sure he means to," Lady Medchester said positively. "He is
going to get a special licence and the wedding will be very soon. I
should like to have it here."</p>

<p>"What!" His lordship stuck a pair of eye-glasses on the bridge
of his Roman nose. "Well, then, I can tell you I won't have it.
Married here, indeed! I think I see myself marching up the aisle
with that Stainer girl hanging on my arm! and the choir singing the
'Voice that breathed o'er Eden,' or whatever it is they do sing.
It's no go, Minnie. And you can tell her I say so. Or I will
myself, if you like."</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" The interjection was so loud and decided that it
sounded almost like a shriek. "You must not, indeed you must not! I
won't have her feelings hurt."</p>

<p>"Sybil's feelings! She ain't got any," scoffed his lordship.
"Rhinoceros hide, I should think, or she'd have been out of here
before now. Hello! What's this chap after? Seems in a deuce of a
hurry!"</p>

<p>Lady Medchester turned her head. Her husband was looking through
the end window, which gave a view of the drive.</p>

<p>Superintendent Mayer had just come into sight, swinging along at
a trot which made his red face and rotund figure look
ludicrous.</p>

<p>"Bless my life! I wonder what he wants. I think I'll go and see.
Getting a bit fat for trotting, I shall tell him."</p>

<p>Lady Medchester stared at him.</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose he is hurrying like that?"</p>

<p>"Lord! How can I tell?" her husband responded. "Looks as if he
were a bit balmy. Anyway, I will toddle down and meet him. He may
have found something that will show who did Saunderson in."</p>

<p>"I wonder--" Lady Medchester drew a deep breath as she strained
her eyes on the hurrying figure. "I--I don't see how he could, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Don't see who could what?" his lordship responded vaguely. "Oh,
I see. Mayer couldn't find out who did Saunderson in, you mean? I
wouldn't be so sure of that. Mayer ain't such a fool as he looks,
not by any means."</p>

<p>He dashed out of the room as he spoke, banging the door to
behind him.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester's eyes widened and darkened as she stared after
him. She drew her handkerchief across her lips, rubbing off the
scarlet lipstick. "Has he found out anything? Merciful heavens,
what has he found out?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, downstairs, his lordship strolled out at the hall
door just in time to meet Superintendent Mayer.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mayer," he began genially. "Doin' the double fox-trot,
aren't you? A bit warm, I should say?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, my lord." The superintendent mopped his perspiring
face. "A warmish day it is, too, for the time of the year. I'm in a
bit of a hurry, my lord."</p>

<p>"The devil you are! Must say I thought you looked like it,"
responded his lordship. "What's up, Mayer? Spotted the blighter
that did Saunderson in?"</p>

<p>The superintendent went on mopping himself for a minute or two
without speaking. At last he said slowly:</p>

<p>"No-a! I can't say I ha' done that, my lord. Not exactly, that
is to say. But I ha' foun' out that as may help to find it
out."</p>

<p>"I'm damned glad to hear it," said his lordship heartily. "What
is it, Mayer?"</p>

<p>The superintendent eyed him doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't know as I ought to say, my lord, not just now like. It
mayn't mean anything. Then I again it may. But, my lord--"</p>

<p>"Oh, please yourself!" his lordship said somewhat huffily.
"Don't you let the beggar slip, that's all."</p>

<p>"I was a-going to say as your lordship said I might use the
phone." Superintendent Mayer's eyes were glancing sharply at the
other's face.</p>

<p>"An' I were a deal nearer here than to the police station, so I
thought I would just come on here an' see if I could get a trunk
call through. It would save time, and time is money, as your
lordship knows."</p>

<p>"I should like to catch the blighter that said so," his lordship
ejaculated wrathfully. "I have always had plenty of the one and
precious little of the other. I have never found I could change
'em."</p>

<p>"Well, it is just a saying, my lord," the superintendent agreed
politely. "There's a lot o' such, an' I don't know as there's much
sense in 'em. But about the telephone, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are welcome to use the phone as much as you like," his
lordship said graciously. "Here's the darned thing," leading the
way to the inner hall and pointing to the telephone standing on a
small table by the open window. "You may be some time getting on,
but there's a chair at hand. Sit down and take it easy after your
exertions, and when you've finished there will be a glass of beer
for you in the justice-room." His lordship went across to the
justice-room as he spoke.</p>

<p>Superintendent Mayer got his trunk call through more quickly
than he anticipated. He lowered his voice considerably, but certain
words could have I been heard distinctly if anyone had been
listening.</p>

<p>"Room 5...That Inspector Stoddart? Mayer speaking...Yes,
important--very--, best clue we've got yet...Can you come down at
once?...Could you come down to-night?...Yes. I've got a line. Sure
thing--motive? Good and plenty...Yes, the five o'clock. I'll be at
the station to meet you. That's all."</p>

<p>The superintendent rang off, and then remembering Lord
Medchester's alluring invitation to the justice-room turned his
steps there. Lord Medchester was standing with his back to him,
apparently staring with absorbed interest at a map of the county
hanging on the wall near the fireplace. He turned as he heard the
superintendent's ponderous movements.</p>

<p>"Come along, Mayer. You will be glad of something to drink. You
are a bit long in the tooth to go trotting about like a
two-year-old after murderers or what not. We are none of us getting
younger, you know. Sit down and rest yourself." He rang the bell.
"Sit down, man. The drink will be here in a moment. Did you get on
to the inspector chap?"</p>

<p>"Ay, my lord, I did."</p>

<p>He waited a minute, while a footman deposited on the table a
tray with glasses and a foaming jug of beer.</p>

<p>Lord Medchester poured out a bumping glass and pushed it across.
"Well, what did he say?"</p>

<p>"The inspector, my lord? He's coming down by the next
train."</p>

<p>Lord Medchester raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"He thinks your news important, then?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't know what it is yet--not rightly, that is to say,"
the superintendent said slowly. "But he's aware that I shouldn't
send for him if it wasn't important."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," Lord Medchester agreed. "I'm just about
consumed by curiosity, Mayer. When shall you let us into the
secret? Her ladyship will give me no peace till she knows it."</p>

<p>A slow smile overspread the superintendent's features.</p>

<p>"Ay, my lord, I know what it is myself. I expect the womenkind
be pretty much alike whether they are ladies or not."</p>

<p>"The Colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady," Lord Medchester muttered.
"Well, you would be safe in trusting me, Mayer."</p>

<p>The superintendent hesitated. He realized that beneath his
jesting manner Lord Medchester was distinctly anxious to know the
nature of his latest discovery. A Holford man born and bred, some
of the old feudal feeling still existed in him; he felt more than
half inclined to gratify his lordship. He opened his mouth to
speak, then the recollection of Inspector Stoddart's warnings as to
absolute silence regarding the case to all the inhabitants of
Holford Hall recurred to him. With a snap he shut his mouth
again.</p>

<p>"I'll do my best to let you know about it, my lord, when I ha'
spoke to the inspector," he promised.</p>

<p>His lordship smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Well, so long, Mayer. I shall look for a visit from you and
Stoddart soon after he gets here."</p>

<p>The superintendent hurried off down the drive. Lord Medchester
watched him for a minute or two, then he too went out, and crossing
towards the Dutch garden immediately caught sight of a figure
coming towards him. He frowned as he recognized Sybil Stainer's
brother, Maurice. He disliked seeing them hanging about as though
the place belonged to them.</p>

<p>Lord Medchester shook hands in a perfunctory fashion.</p>

<p>Maurice Stainer was not much like his sister. His hair, instead
of being red like hers, was sleek and dark, his eyes, too, were
dark and set rather close together under overhanging brows.</p>

<p>"I am on my way to Newcastle and was just making plans with
Sybil," Stainer explained.</p>

<p>"Lady Medchester was kind enough to ask me to stay a day or two
here on the road, but I am sorry I can't. Great disappointment," he
murmured. He seemed oddly ill at ease under Lord Medchester's
scrutiny. "But I hear there's a chance of picking up a bit on the
Pitman's Derby. They say Blue Button is a cert, and as he owes me a
tidy pocketful it's a chance of getting a bit of my own back. I
came here to-day because Lady Medchester and my sister spoke of
putting a pony or two on, and I thought it might be as well for me
to do it on the course. There's a chance the S.P. may go out, for
there's a pot of money on Tailleur, and he was tightening last
night at the Beaufort."</p>

<p>"Well, sounds a tidy sort of proposition if Blue Button is as
good as he's reckoned to be," said his lordship. "I think I must
have a bit on myself. Eh, what?" he added in an effort to make the
best of it--though what the devil Minnie was up to in encouraging
these Stainers was past his comprehension.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12</h2>

<p>"If you please, my lord, Inspector Stoddart would like to speak
to your lordship."</p>

<p>Lord Medchester was idly knocking the balls about in the
billiard-room by himself. He looked up with an air of relief.</p>

<p>"Show him in! Hello, inspector!" as Stoddart appeared.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Lord Medchester." The inspector hesitated a
moment. "I asked to see you," he went on at last, "because I
understand that Superintendent Mayer had a long interview with you
this morning."</p>

<p>Lord Medchester frowned. "Shouldn't call it a long interview
myself. He wanted to use my phone--as a matter of fact, it was to
send a trunk call through to you, I believe. And he seemed a bit
excited and beside himself, don't you know. He'd got an idea he'd
found a clue to Robert Saunderson's murderer. But he was in a
desperate hurry to tell you, inspector. Do you mean that you
haven't seen him?"</p>

<p>"I haven't, Lord Medchester. And, what is more, he can't be
found."</p>

<p>"Can't be found!" His lordship rubbed his forehead and stared.
"What are you getting at, inspector? Mayer isn't exactly the sort
of little chap to get mislaid and lost, you know--what?"</p>

<p>The inspector permitted himself a slight smile. "He is not. I
suppose he has gone to see some one at a distance. But he didn't go
home to dinner or tea. And though, as you say, he seemed very
anxious to see me he was not at the station when I arrived, and I
have had no message from him."</p>

<p>"That seems a bit queer. For he said he was in a great hurry. He
went away from here at a tremendous pace. Must have been after
something special. But I wonder he was not back to meet you. He
rang you up from here, you know, and he told me you were coming
down by the five o'clock from Euston."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you why he wanted me to come down?"</p>

<p>Lord Medchester pulled his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Seemed to think he'd got a line on Saunderson's murderer. But I
don't know any more."</p>

<p>The inspector looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"I suppose he didn't tell you what his new evidence was?"</p>

<p>"Devil a bit of it!" his lordship responded. "Just asked if he
could use the phone to save him going back to the police station.
But he was tremendously bucked, don't you know."</p>

<p>"So I gathered," Stoddart assented. "You have no idea in which
direction he would be likely to be going?"</p>

<p>His lordship shook his head. "No more than you have yourself.
Stay a minute, though--he did say something about the Empton bus,
and went off trotting down the drive like a two-year-old."</p>

<p>"And yet the lodgekeeper says she feels sure he didn't go out
that way. It seems she let him in and he promised to see her on his
way back. Said he was going to Empton and she wanted him to take a
message or something. They are old friends."</p>

<p>"Well, he seemed to be making for the lodge as hard as he could
go the last I saw of him," his lordship remarked. "Still, he might
have headed off and gone along the footpath to the Home Farm. I
have seen him talking to Tom Purling sometimes. I fancy they were
by way of being cronies. He may have gone in to ask Tom's
advice."</p>

<p>"No. I met Purling on my way up. He hadn't seen anything of the
superintendent. Was rather surprised he hadn't, for that matter. I
wonder if you would just allow me to ring them up at the station
and see if they have heard anything since I left?"</p>

<p>"Ring 'em up at once," his lordship said graciously. "I expect
you will find he is there all right."</p>

<p>But he did not turn out to be a true prophet. Inspector
Stoddart's call was answered by Mrs. Mayer, voluble and incoherent.
No, nothing had been heard of the superintendent since early
morning. Mrs. Mayer could not understand it at all. Her husband had
never been a man to stay out like that. No, he had had no letters
that morning but official ones, and he had not appeared interested
or excited in any way. He had not expressed any intention of going
up to the Hall. It was his day for Empton, a neighbouring village.
Nothing had been said of any change in his plans.</p>

<p>Nothing more was to be obtained from Mrs. Mayer, and the
inspector's face was grave as he rang off.</p>

<p>"That's what it is," Lord Medchester said with an air of relief.
"You may depend upon it that's what it is. He came up here first
and that made him late for Empton and he has been detained
there."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't that," dissented the inspector. "Jones told me
when I went up to the police station that it was the
superintendent's day for Empton and I rang them up from there. They
had been expecting him there all day and he had not put in an
appearance then. That would be round about six o'clock."</p>

<p>"That's a queer story," his lordship said, beginning to look
concerned. "I told the old chap he wasn't exactly the figure for
fox-trotting. And he'd made himself pretty hot racing about here.
He may have brought on an attack of some kind and be lying ill on
the way to Empton, or have been taken in somewhere."</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, Lord Medchester, it isn't that, either. The superintendent
meant to go by the motor-bus that goes through Empton on its way to
Loamford. He would catch the one that passes Huglin Corner at
twelve o'clock, generally had a bite of lunch before he started and
got home by another bus about 4.30 for tea. He was a man of regular
habits, was the superintendent."</p>

<p>Lord Medchester looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'was' instead of 'is', inspector?"</p>

<p>Inspector Stoddart looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I suppose I did it without thinking. Well, I
hardly know what to do next. I think I will institute a
house-to-house visitation in the village and see if anyone has seen
anything of him since he left here. If we don't find him in the
village I am afraid we shall have to go through the park and
gardens to see if we can find any trace of him about here."</p>

<p>"Go through the house if you like. I'm sure you're welcome,"
returned his lordship accommodatingly. "The poor old chap may have
tumbled down in a fit somewhere. When a fat man takes to galloping
about as he was doing this morning one doesn't know what may
happen."</p>

<p>The inspector walked sharply down the drive. It was growing
dark; just outside the gate he encountered Harbord.</p>

<p>"Any news?" he questioned.</p>

<p>Harbord shook his head. "We have been to all the likely places
we can think of--Constable Jones and I--but nobody has seen the
superintendent since early morning. Mrs. Mayer is in
hysterics."</p>

<p>"Poor soul!" said the inspector sympathetically.</p>

<p>Harbord looked at him.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, sir? I fancy somehow we are making
mountains out of molehills and that the superintendent will walk in
presently and have the laugh of us all."</p>

<p>"I don't," the inspector said, staring straight in front of him
with a puzzled look. "I can't get the hang of it; but Mayer wasn't
the sort of man to play tricks of this kind, and he was very
anxious we should come down by the earliest possible train. If some
news of him doesn't come along within the next hour, I shall get
the gamekeepers to help me, and search the park and gardens."</p>

<p>"Why?" Harbord asked in a bewildered tone. "Do you think
he--"</p>

<p>"I think nothing," Stoddart interrupted. "Except that he
undeniably was at the Hall this morning and that nobody has seen
him since--not even the lodgekeeper upon whom he promised to
call."</p>

<p>"A pity it was practically dark when we got here," observed
Harbord.</p>

<p>"I don't think it matters much," Stoddart said gloomily.
"Anyway, there will be a moon later on and we shall be able to see
our way about unless it rains all the time, as it generally seems
to in this benighted part of the world."</p>

<p>But it was not raining when the two detectives with Constable
Jones and another man from Empton left the police station for the
Hall. Not one word of Superintendent Mayer had reached them.</p>

<p>The most stringent inquiries both in Holford and Empton had
failed to find the smallest trace of the missing man. From the
moment that Superintendent Mayer left Lord Medchester and started
off down the drive he had apparently disappeared off the face of
the earth. The lodgekeeper, repeatedly interrogated, was positive
that he had not left by her gate--she had been watching for him,
she said, as he had promised to deliver a little parcel for her in
Empton. There remained, of course, the possibility that the missing
man had left the Hall by some other way, but in that case what had
become of him and where had he gone?</p>

<p>The further lodge and the rosery side of the grounds were both
fairly accessible, but both were a considerable distance from the
corner, where the Empton bus picked up the Holford passengers, and
the superintendent had had little time to spare when he left the
Hall. Why should he turn back from the drive down which he was last
seen hurrying, and which was on the direct route to the
stopping-place of the Empton bus, to leave the Hall grounds by some
other way? It was a curious problem, and the more the inspector
thought of it the less he liked the look of it. At the lodge they
found the head gamekeeper and another man awaiting them. The
lodgekeeper stood outside talking to them. As Stoddart approached
she turned to him.</p>

<p>"He never left the park, didn't the superintendent," she said in
an agitated voice. "Him and me have always been good friends, and
he never passed without stopping to pass the time of day. This
morning I wanted to send a little parcel to my girl that's married
and lives at Empton and I was going to walk down to the corner and
give it to the bus conductor. But the superintendent he said no, he
was going right past the house and he would leave it for me. 'You
have it all ready against I come back, Mrs. Yates,' he said, 'for I
may run it a bit fine.' He couldn't ha' gone by and forgotten it,
with me looking out for him all the time. No. You may take my word
for it he never left the park--not by this gate, anyway, dead or
alive."</p>

<p>"Did he seem excited when you saw him?" the inspector
inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, he did seem a bit fresh like," Mrs. Yates answered,
twisting her apron about. "The thought come to me that he had maybe
had a glass. But 'twas early in the morning for that, and he
explained himself--'I'm in for promotion, Mrs. Yates,' he said.
''Im as finds out who murdered Mr. Saunderson he's sure to get it.
An' I ha' pretty well done that,' he says."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you what he had found out, or who it was that had
shot Mr. Saunderson?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not if it was my last word he didn't. I put the
question to him. But he only laughed. 'Ay, Mrs. Yates, but that
would be tellin',' he says. He was always a man for his joke, was
the superintendent. I--I'm hoping there's no harm come to him, like
there did to that other poor gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't think of that," the inspector said, assuming a
cheerfulness he was far from feeling.</p>

<p>They all tramped in through the gate. Although the moon was up,
the trees in the drive made it dark. The gamekeeper looked at
Stoddart.</p>

<p>"Where shall we begin, sir?"</p>

<p>Stoddart waited a minute.</p>

<p>"The last place he was seen in was the turn just before you come
to that old bridge over the hollow."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's where there used to be a pool years ago," the
gamekeeper said thoughtfully. "I mind when I was a boy there used
to be talk of an old mine shaft at one end of it. My father used to
say there was more of 'em about than folks knew about, the tops
just covered over with wood, and then earth and then grass growing.
Time would come, he said, when the boards would rot and give way
and folks would fall in. I wonder--I suppose--there isn't anything
of that happened to the superintendent?"</p>

<p>The inspector wrinkled his brows.</p>

<p>"Doesn't seem likely. Why should he walk off the road when he
was in a special hurry and fall down an old coal mine that
everybody has forgotten?"</p>

<p>The gamekeeper scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Well, he hadn't any enemies as would have thrown him down--the
superintendent hadn't. We have brought lanterns, but it seems they
won't be wanted, for the moon's that bright."</p>

<p>"I dare say they will come in later," the inspector said,
staring round and vaguely noticing the dappled shadows on the grass
cast by the trees in the drive. Right round the park, masking the
high wall that stood next the high road, ran a belt of trees and
shrubs. They extended from the left side of the Dutch garden to the
front lodge. The inspector pointed to it.</p>

<p>"I think we will begin there."</p>

<p>"Shall we begin right by the lodge, inspector?" the keeper said,
beckoning to his man.</p>

<p>"Please." Stoddart nodded. "And I think we shall want your
lanterns now. The undergrowth is pretty thick and the trees make it
dark. We must see what we are doing."</p>

<p>They walked along by the side of the park, under the trees,
throwing the light of their lanterns as they passed along.</p>

<p>"Don't look as if there had been any disturbance here," the
gamekeeper remarked when they had gone a hundred yards or so.</p>

<p>The words had hardly left his mouth when the inspector uttered a
sharp exclamation. Near to them stood an overhanging copper beech;
close to it the bracken had been crushed and broken, and near the
trunk a man was lying a little on one side. At first sight he
looked as if he might be asleep. The inspector hurried forward. The
gamekeeper flashed his lantern on the quiet figure.</p>

<p>"It's him, sure enough!"</p>

<p>"Ay, sure enough!" the others echoed as they saw the broad face,
pale enough now, and the burly form of Superintendent Mayer.</p>

<p>"Eh, poor chap, he must ha' fell here and died," said Constable
Jones, blowing his nose noisily.</p>

<p>The inspector knelt down and put his hand inside the
superintendent's coat.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that he is dead," he said, looking up. "I fancy I
can detect a faint movement of the heart. We must get Dr. Middleton
here at once. Constable Jones--No, Harbord, you will be the
quickest. Send the doctor here and go on for the ambulance."</p>

<p>"I wonder now if he had a fit, like?" Constable Jones
hazarded.</p>

<p>The inspector was busy unfastening the superintendent's rather
tight collar. He did not answer for a minute, then he beckoned to
the constable.</p>

<p>"Look here!"</p>

<p>Constable Jones was not a slim man. He moved forward slowly and
ponderously and got down on his knees beside the inspector.</p>

<p>Stoddart turned back the superintendent's coat and waistcoat. On
the shirt beneath was a dull red stain extending right across.
Nearly in the middle was a small round hole.</p>

<p>Constable Jones stared at it, his eyes growing rounder.</p>

<p>"It looks as if he'd bin shot."</p>

<p>"It does that," the inspector agreed.</p>

<p>The constable's mouth dropped.</p>

<p>"But there's nobody in Holford would go out of their way to
shoot Superintendent Mayer."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? What about the person who shot Robert
Saunderson?" the inspector inquired grimly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13</h2>

<p>"Good Lord! The devil must be about the place!" Lord Medchester
ejaculated.</p>

<p>He was staring at Inspector Stoddart with an expression of utter
bewilderment.</p>

<p>They were facing one another in the study, so-called. Lord
Medchester had been fetched away from his dinner to hear the
inspector's account of the discovery of Superintendent Mayer.</p>

<p>"It is unbelievable--inconceivable!" he went on, rubbing his
bald forehead. "Another man shot close to my house. It--it's
damnable! What's the meaning of it all, inspector?"</p>

<p>"I would give a good deal to know, Lord Medchester. We can only
hope that Superintendent Mayer may be able to tell us--"</p>

<p>"Well, of course," his lordship assented. "But while we are
waiting for the superintendent to tell us the devil who shot him
may have got clean away."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," the inspector said with an odd smile. "We
shall comb out the village, and we have drawn a cordon round the
park."</p>

<p>"That's a nice, jolly sort of thing, to have a lot of damned
policemen stuck round your house. I beg your pardon, inspector, but
you know what I mean."</p>

<p>"I think I do. But on the whole the police round the house may
be better than the murderer going undiscovered."</p>

<p>"The very devil is in it, I should say," Lord Medchester
continued profanely. "And it seems to me--it really does seem to
me--that when you were trying to find the murderer of Robert
Saunderson, if you didn't do that you might at least have prevented
another man being shot."</p>

<p>The inspector coughed. "It is not so easy as it sounds; short of
making the police go about in couples it is not so easy to
accomplish. If we could only get the smallest idea of
Superintendent Mayer's discovery, which he thought had given him
the clue to Robert Saunderson's murderer, we should be in a very
different position. You cannot recollect anything that can give us
the faintest indication--put us in any way on the right track, Lord
Medchester?"</p>

<p>"Not the very least!" Lord Medchester pulled thoughtfully at his
upper lip. "I did my best to get him to tell me," he added
candidly. "But it was no use: he was as close as wax. Shouldn't
have believed it of the man myself. When he gets better he will
tell you--"</p>

<p>"Ah, when?" the inspector echoed. "The doctor has not been very
definite yet, but I'm afraid it's a bad case--a very bad case.
There is internal haemorrhage."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hardly understood. Tell Middleton to get any bigwig he
likes down from town. I will stand the racket. We must have Mayer
well again. Now I think of it, I will motor you down to the Cottage
Hospital and see what Middleton has to say."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad if you will, Lord Medchester. Two heads are
better than one."</p>

<p>As they bowled down the drive in Lord Medchester's runabout,
they did not speak at first. The inspector's brain was hard at
work. It was only a few hours before that the superintendent, full
of health and strength, had come down exactly the same way. What
had happened before he reached the lodge? How had he been lured
across the grass to the spot where he was found? These questions
rang the changes in Stoddart's mind, together with another couple.
What was--what could be--the discovery that the superintendent had
made? And was it this discovery that had led to his death?</p>

<p>When they reached the bridge over the ravine; Lord Medchester
stopped the car.</p>

<p>"There! It was here that I lost sight of him, just on the road.
Hurrying along he was, too, as if he hadn't a moment to spare.
There's a short cut through the shrubbery from here to the garden,
but possibly he didn't know it, and came the longest way round. Why
he didn't go straight on to the gate I can't imagine."</p>

<p>"No; it is but a step from here to the gate." The inspector
looked round meditatively. "And yet in this short distance a
murderer must have been lurking, waiting for him."</p>

<p>His lordship stared round apprehensively. "I wonder where the
blighter is now? Nice, cheerful thought that is of yours,
inspector."</p>

<p>Stoddart cast a strange and searching glance at his companion.
"I fancy you will be quite safe, Lord Medchester."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I shall, by Jove," his lordship said,
shrugging his shoulders. "As I look at it, it was because he had
found out who shot Saunderson that Mayer was done in. Now they know
the superintendent was with me the last thing, I suppose they think
he gave the whole show away to me. I shall be the next one they
will go for."</p>

<p>In the bright moonlight his face looked white and drawn. The
inspector smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"In that case I fancy you would not be here now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I have been sticking pretty closely to the
house so far. Her ladyship isn't well, been going into hysterics
ever since she heard Mayer was missing. What she will be like when
she knows what has happened I can't imagine. Women are like that,
scare themselves into fits. Not that there hasn't been enough to
scare anybody about here lately. She won't be well until she has
been away. I'd have taken her abroad, but she wouldn't come. Said
she wouldn't go away until Saunderson's murderer was found. I had
begun to think I should have to take her by main force. But now
there will be other things to do. We shall have to find out who
shot Mayer. You can't go away and leave the place to itself when a
man has been shot just outside your front door, can you?"</p>

<p>"No, not very well," the inspector said slowly.</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you. I think it would be wise for both you
and Lady Medchester to remain at Holford for some time at
least."</p>

<p>His lordship looked keenly at the inspector's impassive face as
he stroked his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I felt sure you would see matters in that light," he said.</p>

<p>The inspector made no rejoinder; his eyes were glancing here,
there, and everywhere; his right hand was thrust into his hip
pocket.</p>

<p>As they neared the belt of trees in which the superintendent had
been found, his fingers closed more tightly round a small, cold
object; every muscle in his hand and arm was taut and ready. Lord
Medchester was looking from side to side, starting at every
slightest sound.</p>

<p>In silence they drove through the lodge gates, where a policeman
stood on duty, and turned up the hill to the Cottage Hospital. This
was a recent erection. The land had been given by Lord Medchester
and there had been a public subscription to build the hospital
itself. Constable Jones was outside to-day walking up and down the
veranda, which faced south, and where in the daytime convalescent
patients might be seen taking a sun-bath.</p>

<p>Constable Jones saluted. The inspector jumped out of the
car.</p>

<p>"Any news?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Dr. Middleton is there now."</p>

<p>At that moment there came a burst of sobs and cries from the
hospital.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Mayer, sir," Constable Jones explained.</p>

<p>"She has been going on like that all the time--ever since she
saw Dr. Middleton."</p>

<p>"Poor soul!" the inspector said sympathetically. "You will want
to see the doctor, I expect, Lord Medchester?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I must hear what he has to say. I must speak to poor Mrs.
Mayer too."</p>

<p>He got out of the car, the inspector following. Mrs. Mayer was
huddled up in a chair in the wide hall, weeping bitterly, a
white-capped nurse was trying to calm her. She looked up as Lord
Medchester came in and made a momentary effort to rise.</p>

<p>Lord Medchester laid his hand on her shoulder. "I am so sorry
for you, my poor woman. But you must not give up hope like this,
Mrs. Mayer."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer raised her head. Ordinarily a comely, middle-aged
woman, to-day she was shaking from head to foot and her pale face
was tired and drawn and tear-stained.</p>

<p>"There isn't any hope to give up, my lord," she sobbed. "Dr.
Middleton, he said he couldn't give me any. And him the best
husband and father that ever lived. Just put out of life by that
cruel, murdering brute! Who could have killed him, my lord? If I
could get at him!" The tears momentarily forgotten, she clenched
her fists and shook them in the air.</p>

<p>"When we find him we will take care he gets his deserts," Lord
Medchester promised. "And don't you be down-hearted, Mrs. Mayer.
While there's life there's hope is a good saying. And don't you
worry about ways and means. I'll look after you until Mayer is
about again. And now I'm going to tell Dr. Middleton he is to spare
no expense, and to get down another doctor from town, the best he
can think of for the case, and special nurses that can help the
recovery. Oh, we will have the superintendent saved for you, Mrs.
Mayer."</p>

<p>A ray of hope lit up the poor woman's face. "Your lordship is
very kind. I always said there was no one like you and her ladyship
for looking after the folks in your own village."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that, but we will do our best for you
now, Mrs. Mayer. But there's the doctor; I will see you again when
I hear what he has to say."</p>

<p>Dr. Middleton had come quietly down the stairs; he held open a
door at the back of the hall, and as soon as Lord Medchester and
the inspector were inside closed it behind them. When he turned his
face was grave. Lord Medchester began at once:</p>

<p>"Well, doctor, can you save him?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. "No, from the first there was no real
chance. But now the internal haemorrhage is increasing and the
heart is weakening. It is only a question of a very short
time."</p>

<p>Lord Medchester took a few steps up and down the room.</p>

<p>"It's the most damnable thing I've heard of. But I won't give up
hope, doctor. Get a second opinion at once!"</p>

<p>"Glover is here now--from Empton, you know. His opinion
coincides with mine."</p>

<p>"Oh, Glover," his lordship said contemptuously. "Wire for some
one from town. The very best you can think of in this line."</p>

<p>"There wouldn't be time to get him here. As a matter of fact, I
know of no one anywhere to beat Amos Treherne, of Leeds. But I
doubt if there is time--"</p>

<p>"Send for him at once! Tell him it is a matter of life and
death, and that he is to take the very fastest car and driver he
can get. Deuce take the regulations. I'll pay the fine if he gets
one."</p>

<p>"I will send for him, but I must warn you that there is very
small prospect of its being the slightest use. The end may come at
any moment."</p>

<p>"Is there any chance that he will recover consciousness and be
able to tell us what devil shot him?" Medchester asked.</p>

<p>Dr. Middleton pursed up his lips. "There may be a conscious
interval before the end. It is a possibility, that is all I can
say. It is out of the question to be definite one way or the
other."</p>

<p>He hurried off to the telephone. Medchester turned to the
door.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose there is nothing more to be done, inspector. I
must get back to the house and her ladyship. Where are you off
to?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere, at present. I shall wait on the chance of the
conscious interval Dr. Middleton thinks a possibility. It is above
all things important to find out whether the superintendent
recognized his assailant. Any word he lets drop may give us the
clue."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, I'm no good at that sort of thing. I'll toddle off
now and send down to see how the poor chap gets on last thing. Come
in if you are passing, inspector, and let me know how you get
on."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will."</p>

<p>The inspector watched the other across the hall; then he went
over to the small ward on the ground floor in which the
superintendent had been placed. The door was open, a screen had
been placed round the bed. The sister came to him.</p>

<p>"Will you tell the doctor that there are signs of returning
consciousness?"</p>

<p>The inspector turned, but the doctor was close behind him and
they went in together. Mrs. Mayer was sitting by the bedside now,
her eyes fixed anxiously on her husband's face. The superintendent
was rolling his head from side to side and moving his hands
restlessly. At a sign from the doctor the nurse came forward with a
glass of some restorative, but the difficulty of getting Mayer to
swallow even a drop was great, and at last they had to desist. But
his eyes were open now and there was the light of reason in
them.</p>

<p>He looked at Stoddart; tried to speak, but no coherent words
came.</p>

<p>Dr. Middleton glanced at the inspector and then took the dying
man's hand in his.</p>

<p>"Can you tell us who shot you, Mayer?" he asked, his fingers on
the weakening pulse.</p>

<p>The listeners held their breath as the superintendent tried to
answer.</p>

<p>"Shot? Was that it?" he whispered faintly. "Some one called
me--and then--my heart--"</p>

<p>The doctor glanced sharply at Stoddart. "You had better be
quick!"</p>

<p>The inspector bent nearer. "You sent for me, superintendent. You
wanted to tell me something. Can you remember what it was?"</p>

<p>The pallor of death was settling over the superintendent's face.
"Tell--tell--" he repeated, the poor, gasping breath coming in
painful sobs, "my lord."</p>

<p>"My lord," the inspector repeated. "Was my lord there when you
were taken ill?"</p>

<p>They waited, every eye fixed upon the dying face, but no answer
came.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer laid her head on the pillow close to her husband's.
"Who was it that hurt thee, Jack? Tell us, lad!"</p>

<p>The familiar voice penetrated the dying ears. The fast-glazing
eyes sought the familiar face.</p>

<p>"Eh, Polly, lass. You and the kids--no father."</p>

<p>"Eh, lad, don't thee give up. Tell us who it was as made thee
ill."</p>

<p>But the momentary accession of strength was passing.</p>

<p>"Tell us, Jack," Mrs. Mayer urged. "Who was it?"</p>

<p>"It's hid--safe--tell my lord--you'll find--"</p>

<p>As the last word left the white lips the head slipped sideways,
the mouth opened wide with a moan. There was a dead silence. Mrs.
Mayer knelt by the bed with her face on her husband's arm. At last
the doctor laid down the hand he still held and took out his
watch.</p>

<p>"It is all over now. He is at rest, poor fellow. And you see
now, inspector, that he could tell you little more than you knew
already."</p>

<p>The inspector dissented. "I don't know about that. I really do
not know about that. What is it that's hid--and where?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>

<p>"Well, that's that," said the inspector.</p>

<p>"And so another chapter in the Holford mystery is finished."</p>

<p>He and Harbord were sitting in their room at the "Medchester
Arms." The inspector had his case-book open upon the table before
him and was going over his notes.</p>

<p>"This last affair is most unaccountable," Harbord rejoined. "Its
taking place in the park is so puzzling."</p>

<p>"Robert Saunderson was not far from the park when he was shot,"
the inspector said significantly.</p>

<p>Harbord looked at him. "The superintendent found out something
that solved the mystery of Robert Saunderson's death. Why shouldn't
we do the same? We have the same data to go upon."</p>

<p>The inspector took up a silver cigarette-case with a laudatory
inscription upon it. He toyed with it for a minute, then took a
cigarette from it, lighted it, and in leisurely fashion asked:</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that we have?"</p>

<p>Harbord got up and walked to the fireplace. "You don't think the
superintendent kept anything back?"</p>

<p>"The superintendent--and other people, possibly," Stoddart
assented.</p>

<p>Harbord drummed his fingers upon the wooden mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"It is a thousand pities Mayer did not take Lord Medchester into
his confidence. What did he mean when he said something was
'hid'?"</p>

<p>"A thousand pities he did not ring us up from the police station
instead of going to the Hall at all," the inspector agreed
dryly.</p>

<p>When Harbord spoke next it was hesitatingly and without looking
at the inspector:</p>

<p>"At any rate, somebody must have known well enough what the
superintendent had discovered." The inspector knocked the ashes
from his cigarette.</p>

<p>"You mean Who?"</p>

<p>"His murderer."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "That seems likely. The superintendent
might have been shot to prevent him stumbling on the truth as his
assailant thought."</p>

<p>"I see! But the two things are pretty much the same, aren't
they, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have gone through Mayer's movements yesterday morning
pretty thoroughly. First thing after he had had his letters he had
to make arrangements for an inquest at Twistleton--old chap who had
tumbled down dead in the street, presumably of heart disease. After
that he had to go through a report from Sergeant Thompson of
Bastow. Then he appears to have looked over his accounts, which
took him some time, he having had, as his wife said, no head for
figures. Followed an interview with Constable Jones, in which he
appears to have given no faintest hint of any discovery in
connexion with Saunderson's murder. As a conclusion he went his
usual round, which seems to have taken him pretty nearly all over
the village. He posted some letters, but I can't make out that he
stopped to speak to anybody. Several folks, with that desire to be
in the know which distinguishes so large a portion of the British
public, say that he passed the time of day with them, but nothing
more seems to have been said until he reached his old crony, Mrs.
Yates, at the lodge. Then he was, as we have heard, excited, and
throwing out hints as to his discovery which would lead to the
solving of the mystery of Robert Saunderson's death and his own
consequent promotion. Therefore, as far as we can judge, the
discovery must have been made between his leaving the police
station and reaching the front lodge, though it seems impossible to
find out at present when or how it was made."</p>

<p>"Is it certain there was nothing in his letters?" The inspector
shrugged his shoulders. "Nothing is certain, but Constable Jones
swears only five letters arrived, and all those five are on his
desk in the office. Purely official, all of them."</p>

<p>"It seems pretty much of a deadlock," Harbord said thoughtfully.
"But--"</p>

<p>The inspector looked at him. "Speak out, Alfred."</p>

<p>"Well, as far as we have got," Harbord went on diffidently,
"only three people had conversations of any length with the
superintendent. One of those three, it seems to me, must know more
than they have said."</p>

<p>"Those three being?" the inspector interrogated.</p>

<p>Harbord looked away, right through the open window, to where,
through the trees, it was possible to catch a glimpse of Holford
Hall.</p>

<p>"Well, there's Constable Jones and Mrs. Yates at the lodge
and--Lord Medchester. If all these three would speak out I think
from one of them we should get a hint of the truth."</p>

<p>The inspector raised his eyebrows. "Especially the last, eh,
Alfred?"</p>

<p>"And the first," Harbord said slowly. "We have only his account
of his interview with the superintendent, you know, sir. And he was
pretty much on the spot when Saunderson died."</p>

<p>"He was," the inspector assented. "Oh, I have had my eye on
Constable Jones, but I have gone through him pretty well with a
tooth-comb and I don't think he had anything to do with shooting
Saunderson. Besides, where's his motive? There were plenty of men,
and women too, with first-class motives for doing Saunderson in,
but Constable Jones wasn't one of them. As for Mrs. Yates, I
haven't quite made up my mind about her. Remains the last of your
three--Lord Medchester. What he knows he won't say, and how much he
knows it isn't easy to find out--and he may know nothing. As you
remarked about Constable Jones just now, we have only his account
of what took place yesterday morning between Superintendent Mayer
and himself. The same thing applies to Mrs. Yates and Lord
Medchester. But one thing is clear: whatever the superintendent
discovered was after he left the police station, or he would have
rung me up instead of coming to the Hall."</p>

<p>"Yes, one sees that," Harbord agreed. "But he doesn't seem to
have done anything but his usual trot round, and if there was
nothing in his letters how the dickens did he find out anything
about Saunderson's murder? Mrs. Mayer says he gave her not the
slightest hint of any discovery before he went out."</p>

<p>"No; whatever he found out, he found out after that, I am
convinced." The inspector glanced curiously at Harbord. "Didn't it
strike you--but I am sure it did--that there was something rather
significant about the superintendent's last words?--'Someone called
me.' Who called him?"</p>

<p>Harbord met the inspector's eye. "It makes one think, sir. We
know who Mayer had just left, but--"</p>

<p>"Exactly! But if he was called back with some ulterior motive by
the person to whom he had been talking--and we know who that
was--the question that presents itself to my mind is, why was he
allowed to leave that person at all? And we can verify that
person's alibi through Mr. Maurice Stainer."</p>

<p>Harbord looked right away from his superior now. "As I see
matters, it might have been done to establish a sort of alibi, to
show that Mayer had got out of the Hall and off the immediate
premises before he was shot."</p>

<p>The inspector considered a minute. "It might have been so, but I
think the odds are against it. It was a pretty dangerous thing to
do anyhow, and he'd have had to be pretty nippy about it. And
whatever Mayer had found out about Saunderson's murderer it must
have been fairly conclusive, or a second murder wouldn't have been
risked."</p>

<p>"'Called me,' the poor old chap said," Harbord went on, taking
up an ornament from the mantelpiece and twisting it about as he
spoke. "Has it struck you, sir, that the distance from the bridge
where he was last seen by Lord Medchester to the spot where Mayer
was found isn't great?"</p>

<p>"H'm, yes!" The inspector nodded. "But Lord Medchester says he
watched him from the house, and the bridge is a long way from the
house."</p>

<p>"Nobody came through the lodge gate after the superintendent
went up, according to Mrs. Yates," Harbord said thoughtfully, "so
that the murderer must have been in the park or in the
gardens."</p>

<p>The inspector shrugged his shoulders. "Not necessarily; the park
is quite accessible in several places. I shouldn't imagine that the
murderer would walk up to the front entrance and ring the bell; he
could come in across the Home Farm, go round by the small gate on
the edge of the wood, and up the rosery way, as Saunderson did on
the night he was murdered. Or he might have come by the
gamekeeper's cottage, through the old quarry, and across the
pinewood to the park."</p>

<p>"I wonder," Harbord said thoughtfully. "I wonder; the trainer
Burford was up here yesterday you see, sir."</p>

<p>"Michael Burford, h'm!" The inspector wrinkled his brow. "I have
made a few tentative inquiries and I can't make out any harm about
him. I will have him looked up, though. I was certain at the time
of Saunderson's death that Mrs. Burford knew more than she said,
and her brother--Lord Gorth, as he is now--was a young rotter, if
ever I saw one. I shouldn't think he had the pluck to commit one
murder, let alone two. Still, he was in with Saunderson, and a
bully like Saunderson goes too far sometimes, and even a weakling
like Gorth can turn."</p>

<p>"The proverbial worm," Harbord assented.</p>

<p>"But I think myself--"</p>

<p>Just as the last word left his lips there was a tap at the door,
and the landlady put her head in.</p>

<p>"There's a lady to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"A lady!" The inspector looked at her.</p>

<p>"Who is it, Mrs. Marlow; anybody you know?" Mrs. Marlow shook
her head. "No. She's a stranger to these parts, I should say, sir.
But she tells me her name is Saunderson--Mrs. Robert Saunderson."
The landlady lowered her voice as she spoke the name.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Robert Saunderson!" the inspector repeated. "Show her up
at once, please, Mrs. Marlow."</p>

<p>When the landlady had departed he looked across at Harbord.
"This is an unexpected development, Alfred. And yet I don't know
that I am altogether surprised. Robert Saunderson was the kind of
man who might have had a dozen Mrs. Saundersons hanging round. I
wonder where this one has sprung from?"</p>

<p>They had not long to wait. The landlady reappeared, ushering in
a tall, showily-dressed woman, quite evidently not in her first
youth. She looked from one to the other of the two detectives with
a smile that showed two rows of expensive teeth.</p>

<p>"Which of you two gentlemen is in charge of the Saunderson
case?"</p>

<p>Harbord drew back. Stoddart moved forward and pulled out a chair
for her.</p>

<p>"I am. Mr. Harbord here is my most trusted assistant. Mrs.
Robert Saunderson, is it? Not related to--?"</p>

<p>"The Robert Saunderson that was murdered in the park here," the
lady finished. "Only his wife, and wives don't count for much
nowadays--never did in Saunderson's eyes."</p>

<p>"But," the inspector hesitated, "we have so far had no knowledge
that Mr. Robert Saunderson was married."</p>

<p>"I dare say not," the lady returned. "He knew he had a better
time if he passed as a bachelor--a rich bachelor. But we were
married right enough in the Register Office up at Marylebone, a
good five and twenty years ago and more. We had a nice home in
Bayswater for a bit, then the dibs grew scarce and Bob ran off to
the Argentine, and I went back to the stage."</p>

<p>"The stage! Why, of course!" the inspector resumed. "You
are--"</p>

<p>"Tottie Delauney of the Frivolity," the lady finished for him.
"I dare say you have seen me, inspector."</p>

<p>"I have that, Mrs. Saunderson," Stoddart rejoined, "and enjoyed
your performance too. I little thought I should ever meet you and
sit chatting here like this."</p>

<p>Mrs. Saunderson bridled. Quite evidently this was the style of
conversation to which she was accustomed.</p>

<p>"He was away some time, Bob was," she went on. "And when he came
back I didn't see why he should hang up his hat in my hall, seeing
he hadn't attempted to keep me while he was away, I'd made a name
on the stage then and I liked my work, and I stuck to it. Bob, he
set up as a money-lender; he'd always done a bit of that in a small
way, but now he began to make it pay. He went out to the War for a
time, but he didn't stick that long--too fond of his own skin.
After he came back he picked up a pretty good income by his wits.
But I didn't come here to talk about that, inspector. Bob
Saunderson had his faults, but, after all, he was my husband, and
his murderer has got to be punished."</p>

<p>"He will be, if we can catch him," the inspector assured her
quickly.</p>

<p>"And if that doesn't happen to be a 'him' at all?" Mrs.
Saunderson questioned.</p>

<p>"The punishment will be about the same," the inspector returned.
"Women have their rights, you know."</p>

<p>"I know. And some of them they've lost, I guess," Mrs.
Saunderson said sharply. "I can tell you who shot him,
inspector."</p>

<p>"Can you?" Stoddart allowed no touch of surprise to appear in
his voice. "I need not say that we shall be grateful for any help
you can give us."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can help you right enough," Mrs. Saunderson said with a
nod. "The woman who shot Robert Saunderson was Anne Courtenay--Mrs.
Michael Burford she is now."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Michael Burford?" the inspector repeated. "You have some
proof of this assertion, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Proof? Bless you, I know what I'm talking about!" the lady
retorted sharply. "I saw Saunderson on the Tuesday before he was
shot. I had seen a lot about him in the papers--there was his name
in the society news every day pretty nearly. I saw he had
race-horses in training, and you can't do that on nothing. So I
thought it was his duty to do something for me. After all, it is
supposed to be a man's duty to keep his wife, though it's precious
few of 'em that do it nowadays, if you come to that. I didn't want
Bob to keep me, but I thought he ought to do his bit. So I went
over to his flat. He was nearly scared out of his skin when he saw
me; pretended he thought I was dead. And then after beating about
the bush for a bit, and looking mighty ashamed of himself, he told
me that he had deceived me and that the registrar who married us
was a friend of his and that we weren't really married at all. It
was a lie, and I knew it, but it suited my book to pretend to
believe him. So I said that if he would make me an allowance while
I was resting he could wash his past out as far as I was concerned.
Then when it was all settled he told me that there I was a girl, a
lady, he had taken a fancy to, and he meant to marry her. She was
engaged to some one else, he said, but he had got the means of
breaking it off, and he was going to do it."</p>

<p>The inspector looked inquiringly at her. "How did you know he
meant Miss Courtenay?"</p>

<p>"I went to his flat to find out," Mrs. Saunderson said, a note
of fear creeping into her voice. "When he saw I was quite friendly
like and not going to interfere with his doings, he began to talk
quite freely. And when I suggested a night-club to finish up with
he came with me like a lamb. We had cocktails and what not, and by
and by I ferreted out of him what I wanted to know. He wouldn't
tell me her name, but he said he'd got hold of her through her
brother, who was in his power. She would have to marry him, he
said, or he would send her brother to gaol. It would all be in the
papers, for she was going to give him his answer that week. I
didn't know about the murder just at first. I don't read the papers
much, bar the theatrical news and the divorces. When I did, I
didn't realize what it meant until I saw a paragraph about the new
Lord Gorth, and it said that he and his sister, Mrs. Michael
Burford, the wife of the famous trainer, had been included in the
house-party at Holford Hall, when his friend, Mr. Robert
Saunderson, had been murdered. Then I saw plainly enough how it
must have been. It was Anne Courtenay he went to meet, and it was
Anne Courtenay who shot him."</p>

<p>"That doesn't quite follow," the inspector said. "But we will
have Mrs. Burford's movements carefully looked into; and Lord
Gorth's while we are about it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Saunderson got up. "Well, with what I have told you it
ought not to be a difficult matter to bring it home to Anne
Courtenay--Anne Burford, I should say. But if you want me again I
shall be staying here a day or two. You know where to find me, I
shall be up at the Frivolity next week."</p>

<p>"I will make a note of that at once," the inspector said,
producing his notebook. "And your address in Holford, please, Mrs.
Saunderson? We might want to communicate with you at any
moment."</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Saunderson looked embarrassed; she stared from
one detective to the other. "Well, I don't know why you shouldn't
know; I am not ashamed of it. I am staying at the lodge, and I am
not ashamed of it."</p>

<p>"The lodge!" the inspector echoed. "What lodge?"</p>

<p>"Holford Hall lodge," Mrs. Saunderson returned, a shade of
defiance creeping into her voice, "and I am not ashamed of it, I
tell you. Mrs. Yates is my mother--I am not ashamed of that,
either. Miranda Yates, that's my name--was, before I was married to
Bob Saunderson leastways. I'm not ashamed of having got up in the
world."</p>

<p>"Ashamed!" the inspector repeated. "I should think not--I can
see nothing but a cause of pride in that."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I don't know about that!" Mrs. Saunderson said as she
got up and turned to the door. "But if there's anything you want me
for there I am."</p>

<p>When the door had closed behind her Stoddart looked at
Harbord.</p>

<p>"Well, this is an unexpected development. Apparently it
complicates matters considerably, though we've only got her word
for it."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, and I wouldn't believe her on her oath without
confirmatory evidence!" Harbord assented. "Nice sort of lady,
wasn't she, sir?</p>

<p>"She was that," the inspector agreed. "I can't help sympathizing
with Saunderson. If I had been fool enough to marry Tottie Delauney
I should have done my best to get rid of her."</p>

<p>Harbord laughed. "You mightn't have found it so easy, sir. What
do you think of her story?"</p>

<p>"I think it will bear a good deal of investigation, and it will
have it," Stoddart said grimly.</p>

<p>"It was she who was at the lodge yesterday, then."</p>

<p>"You didn't question her about that?</p>

<p>"No. That will come when we have inquired a little more into her
story. In the meantime--" The inspector paused, and there was a
far-away look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" Harbord queried.</p>

<p>"I think we will go over to East Molton and interview Mrs.
Michael Burford," the inspector finished.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15</h2>

<p>The inquest on the body of Superintendent Mayer was held in the
club-room at the back of the "Medchester Arms." A great crowd had
gathered round the door long before the hour fixed for the opening.
Holford folks were there in strength, for the late superintendent
was a Holford man born and bred, and all his acquaintances were
there as a matter of course. People had come by train from York and
Liverpool, and even the London papers had sent representatives. The
fact that it was the second inquest to be held at the "Medchester
Arms" within a month was much commented upon. The connexion between
the two murders was discussed, and all sorts of theories were put
forward. The general idea seemed to be that some maniac haunted
Holford Hall and gardens. A local paper created a sensation by
appearing with, "A Modern Jack the Ripper" in big head-lines across
the front page.</p>

<p>Lord Medchester, accompanied by Lord Gorth and Michael Burford,
was among the first to enter. All three were accommodated with
seats near the coroner. The jury, nine men and three women, were
sworn in, and then departed to view the body in the mortuary,
escorted by a couple of policemen from Loamford, who had been
imported to fill the vacant places at Holford. They returned
shortly, looking very white and shaken, and took their places.</p>

<p>Stoddart and Harbord sat just behind the lawyers engaged in the
case, quite near the witness-box, flanked by a bevy of
reporters.</p>

<p>The coroner glanced curiously at them as the proceedings began.
The fact had leaked out that the great London detectives who had
been at Holford to inquire into the murder of Robert Saunderson had
come down again, and had indeed been with the Holford men who found
Superintendent Mayer dying.</p>

<p>A solicitor from Empton, Mr. Robert Willet, appeared for Mrs.
Mayer and the family of the deceased, and Mr. Belton Carter watched
the case, for Lord Medchester.</p>

<p>The medical evidence was taken first. Dr. Middleton told them
that the wound could not have been self-inflicted, and said that
the superintendent had been shot by some one standing in front of
him and at tolerably close quarters. He and Dr. Glover, who
conducted the post mortem, gave the result of their investigation,
and told how certain organs had been taken from the body and sent
up to London to the Home Office pathologist for further
examination. The result, he said, might be expected in about a
fortnight.</p>

<p>At the end of Dr. Middleton's evidence, Lord Medchester was
called, and in answer to the coroner's deferential questions told
his story of the superintendent's visit to the Hall on the morning
of his death. He gave due importance to the fact that some news had
reached the superintendent which he thought might give a clue to
the assassin of Robert Saunderson, and described how he allowed
Mayer to use the telephone to summon Inspector Stoddart. The last
he saw of the superintendent the deceased was hurrying down the
drive for all he was worth, and had just reached the bridge over
the ravine. No one was more astonished than he was when he heard
from Inspector Stoddart the same evening that the superintendent
was missing. He could scarcely imagine it possible that any harm
could have happened to Mayer between the point at which he lost
sight of him and the lodge--although there was a good step between
them. Asked if he knew what could have induced the superintendent
to leave the drive and go across to the belt of trees, he shrugged
his shoulders and said he had no idea. The superintendent appeared
to be in a hurry to get off to Empton, and he, Lord Medchester,
watched him start almost running down the drive.</p>

<p>There was a distance of three-quarters of a mile between the
house and lodge, unless you went by the short cut. He himself had
gone out into the garden, where he found Mr. Stainer and talked to
him for ten minutes or so on racing prospects.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be got out of Lord Medchester, and he
stepped back to his seat near the coroner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates from the lodge was the next witness. The old woman
was shaking, and apparently on the verge of tears, as she took her
place in the box and repeated the oath. In reply to the coroner's
questions she repeated what she had told Inspector Stoddart. Then
there was a pause. The coroner glanced at his notes. Presently he
looked up.</p>

<p>"Was there any third person present when you had this
conversation with the superintendent, Mrs. Yates?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates's ruddy cheeks turned curiously white. She fumbled
with the edge of her long cloak.</p>

<p>"I don't understand, your worship!"</p>

<p>The coroner leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Were you alone with the superintendent when you talked with
him? Was anyone else there?"</p>

<p>"I--I came out, when I saw the superintendent, to open the lodge
gate," she faltered.</p>

<p>"I quite understand that," the coroner said patiently. "But when
the superintendent was telling you of the discovery he had made was
there anyone else there?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates burst into tears. "There--there was my girl,
sir--Mary Ann--Mirandy, she likes to call herself; she just came
out to pass the time of day with the superintendent for the sake of
old times."</p>

<p>"Did this daughter of yours hear all the superintendent
said?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates produced a voluminous handkerchief, and wept
copiously into it.</p>

<p>"She might ha' done," she sobbed. "She wasn't there at first but
she came running down the steps when she saw the superintendent,
she having known him from a child, like."</p>

<p>"Why haven't you told us about this daughter before?" the
coroner inquired severely.</p>

<p>After one glance at his face Mrs. Yates's sobs redoubled.</p>

<p>"I didn't know as it mattered, sir. Mary Ann, she just thought
she'd like to have a word with the superintendent. There--there
wasn't any harm in it."</p>

<p>"No harm at all," the coroner assented. "The curious thing about
it is that you have not thought fit to mention the fact that your
daughter was at the lodge to anyone."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates chokingly reiterated that she didn't know it mattered
to anybody, and the spectators, scenting a mystery, leaned forward
to get a look at her.</p>

<p>"Was this the daughter that had lived at Empton?" the coroner
asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir. That's my youngest."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates rolled her handkerchief into a damp little ball and
rubbed her eyes. "Mary Ann is my eldest, and a good girl she has
been to me in the way of sending me money."</p>

<p>"Well, when you and your daughter had had this conversation with
the superintendent, what did you do?" pursued the coroner.</p>

<p>"I went on with my jobs about the house, sir, keeping my eye on
the gate all the time to see the superintendent when he came
back."</p>

<p>"And your daughter, was she helping you with your work?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; she don't know much about house-work, don't Mary Ann,"
Mary Ann's mother went on with misplaced pride. "She was always one
for the theayter. She was tired, too, that morning and she went and
lay down."</p>

<p>"What time did she get up?" the coroner inquired sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, she came down to dinner about one o'clock." Mrs. Yates put
away her handkerchief with an air of resolution and waited.</p>

<p>Inspector Stoddart sent up a small folded note to the coroner,
who read it and then consulted his notes again. At last he said to
the usher:</p>

<p>"Call Mary Ann Yates."</p>

<p>There was quite a sensation in the court as in answer to the
usher's call Tottie Delauney made her way to the witness-box. She
had evidently got herself up for the occasion. Her pink and white
skin, her scarlet lips, and her pencilled eyebrows, making of her
face something like a mask, were quite unlike anything Holford was
accustomed to. Even her ladyship and the visitors at the Hall did
not go as far as this.</p>

<p>Miss Delauney's garments were all black. Her heavy coat of cloth
with wide collar and cuffs of black fur was opened to display what
seemed like a black satin shift, so short and skimpy was it. Her
plump neck was encircled by two rows of pearls, and her fat legs
were encased in black silk stockings.</p>

<p>The coroner stared at her. She was indeed an astonishing vision,
considered as the daughter of old Mrs. Yates.</p>

<p>"Your name is Mary Ann Yates?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"It used to be," Miss Delauney replied with what was meant to be
a bewitching smile. "But now I generally answer to 'Tottie
Delauney'."</p>

<p>"Tottie--what?" asked the coroner who was no frequenter of
theatres or music-halls, and to whom the name meant nothing.</p>

<p>"Tottie Delauney," the witness replied, raising her voice under
the impression that the coroner must be deaf. "Of the Frivolity,"
she added in explanation.</p>

<p>"Oh, an actress! Mrs. or Miss Delauney?" The coroner paused.</p>

<p>The witness looked embarrassed. "Well--Miss--we're all supposed
to be single on the stage." There was a faint titter from the
spectators, instantly suppressed by the ushers. "But, as a matter
of fact, I married years ago."</p>

<p>The coroner was getting tired of the lady. "Your real name,
please?" he rapped out.</p>

<p>"Well, it is Mary Ann Saunderson," witness replied, her eyes
dropping before the coroner's.</p>

<p>As the last word left her lips there was a sensation in court;
even the officials turned and stared at her. Only the coroner and
Inspector Stoddart remained unmoved.</p>

<p>"Any connexion of the Mr. Saunderson who was shot in Holford
gardens a month ago?" the coroner inquired.</p>

<p>"His wife," the witness assented. "Leastways his widow, I should
say now."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come forward at the time of his death?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Saunderson did not look quite comfortable.</p>

<p>"Well, I was laid up just then with flu, and I'm not one for
reading the papers at the best of times, and when I did hear--well,
I hadn't known much of Bob Saunderson for years, and the papers
said they had a clue and the murderer would be arrested in no time,
so I didn't think it was my business."</p>

<p>The coroner looked at her. "What made you change your mind?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Saunderson fidgeted beneath his scrutiny. "Well, if you
must know, I suspected that Bob had left a lot of money and, if
there wasn't any Will, I should come in for some of it. So I
thought I'd better see about things."</p>

<p>"When did you come to your mother's?"</p>

<p>"Three days ago. Last Sunday morning," Mrs. Saunderson went on
glibly. "I was resting, you understand. There'll be a new revue on
soon at the Frivolity and I am taking the principal part. We shall
start rehearsing next week, but I had nothing on for a day or two.
And, after all, he had his faults, had Bob Saunderson, but he was
my husband, and I don't see why he should be done in and nobody
punished."</p>

<p>A faint inclination to applaud this sentiment was instantly
quelled by the coroner.</p>

<p>"Well, you came down to your mother's and, you were there last
Monday--"</p>

<p>The coroner paused and, after a short conference with Inspector
Stoddart, continued:</p>

<p>"Did you see the superintendent go in through the lodge
gates?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Saunderson nodded sullenly. "Mother called me out to speak
to him. I didn't want to particularly. I used to know Bill Mayer
when I was a kid and lived next door to the Mayers. But I hadn't
seen him for years and I wasn't anxious. But Mother, she would have
me down."</p>

<p>"You heard the superintendent say he was going up to the
Hall?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he said he wanted to phone and that it would be quicker
than going back to the police station."</p>

<p>"You gathered his errand had to do with Saunderson's
murder?"</p>

<p>"He said it had," Mrs. Saunderson admitted. "He said he should
get promotion over it."</p>

<p>"Did he know you were Saunderson's wife?"</p>

<p>"No; of course he didn't!" Mrs. Saunderson said with a sudden
accession of energy. "There was nobody at Holford knew, not even my
mother."</p>

<p>"And you didn't tell him?"</p>

<p>"Not much!" Mrs. Saunderson shook her head vigorously. "I
believe in keeping a still tongue, anyhow until I see how the land
lies."</p>

<p>"What was the last you saw of the superintendent?"</p>

<p>"The last I saw of him that morning he was going up the drive
towards the Hall. I watched him round the corner where the shrubs
stick out in a point and you can't see the road any further. He
said he would call in again on his way back--as Mother told
you."</p>

<p>"And what did you do then?"</p>

<p>"I went back into the house and went upstairs and lay down.
You've got to use your legs in this world whether you like it or
not, so give 'em a bit of a rest when you can. That's what I say.
Mother was in the house all the time. I could hear her messing
about round the rooms."</p>

<p>"And you saw no more of Superintendent Mayer?" the coroner
asked.</p>

<p>"Never a glimpse! But if you want my opinion as to who murdered
Bob Saunderson--" she began.</p>

<p>"I do not," the coroner intervened sharply, "and if you take my
advice you'll hold your tongue. There's such a thing as the law of
libel!" And he ordered the witness to stand down.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER 16</h2>

<p>After a brief interrogation of Inspector Stoddart with regard to
Mayer's final halting words at the hospital, the inquest had been
adjourned pending further inquiries. The most important point to be
solved seemed to be what was the nature of the evidence that had
come to the superintendent's knowledge between the police station
and his arrival at Holford lodge and, equally important, through
what sort of channel did he receive it? What connexion had it with
his murder which so speedily followed?</p>

<p>That there was some connexion between the two murders seemed
pretty obvious; so Stoddart and his subordinate decided over a
supper of cold beef and ale at the "Medchester Arms."</p>

<p>"Same hand did both, in my opinion," the inspector remarked. "If
we find the one we find the other. Considering all the
circumstances, it's difficult to leave Lord Medchester out of it
entirely; he was on the spot when Mayer, poor chap, sent his
telephone message, and heard him mention he'd got an important clue
of some sort. And yet he was talking to Stainer when the murder was
taking place--that's true enough, for I've verified it all right.
Then, again, the arguments I used with regard to Lady Medchester
hold good with him; Mayer would never have been so pleased with the
line he'd got if it implicated either Lord or Lady Medchester. He'd
have been embarrassed, if you know what I mean. It's a puzzling
case, Harbord, so many 'might-bes' and 'couldn't-have-beens'." The
inspector took a final pull at his tankard and rose. "First thing
to-morrow morning I am going to pay a visit to Mrs. Michael
Burford, and you can come with me. I have an idea she may know more
than she lets on, though Miss Tottie Delauney--heavens above, what
a woman!--is probably overshooting the mark. Mrs. Burford doesn't
strike me as the type that would do anything desperate. But it
wants looking into."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Anne Burford was sitting down to answer her morning's letters
when the sound of well-drilled footsteps on the gravel outside drew
her eyes to the open window.</p>

<p>Her brother Harold had dined with her and her husband at East
Molton overnight, and related at some length, subject to the
corrections of his brother-in-law, what had passed at the inquest
on the previous day. His story was rather confused--a faculty for
piecing together a concise relation of events was apparently not
his, but as the evidence had led to nowhere in the coroner's court
it was not to be expected that it would lead to anywhere in
particular in Lord Gorth's less practised hands.</p>

<p>The only noticeable point about it had been that never once
during the whole story did Harold meet his sister's eyes.</p>

<p>Both of them had changed. From Anne's delicate, finely-drawn
features something of the joy of life, the sparkle of youth had
faded; but in its place there was a great peace and a tranquillity
very different from the unrest, the anxious, troubled expression
that had haunted the depths of her eyes since Saunderson had been
found dead in the summer-house. Michael Burford, although to
discover the solution of the mystery might well be beyond him, had
proved a tower of strength to lean upon in trouble.</p>

<p>Her brother had more definitely altered, suddenly transformed
from boy to man. His features, set in firmer, sterner lines, might
almost have reassured Anne's doubting heart as to a lesson learned
that would last him his life had it not been for this culminating
act of folly in his projected marriage with Sybil Stainer, whom his
sister abhorred with her whole heart. How much and how little did
Sybil Stainer know? What was it that seemed to have placed them all
in the hollow of her hand?</p>

<p>At dinner the previous evening, whenever Anne had mentioned his
engagement to Miss Stainer, Harold had shied away from the subject,
glancing at her with miserable eyes. It puzzled her. If this
marriage was as distasteful to him as she believed it to be, why
did he go through with it? In this unexpected heritage of his
surely lay salvation? With the chief actor removed he had only to
meet the bill, forged though the signature on it might be; without
the principal witness it would be difficult to prove the name a
forgery even if the question were raised.</p>

<p>There was an alternative explanation, but she turned from that
with a shudder, resolutely shutting out the shadow that had mouthed
at her ever since that terrible evening when Saunderson, with all
Harold's future in the hollow of his hand, had been found dead in
the summer-house.</p>

<p>"You've married the right man, Anne," her brother said to her
that evening as she stood on the doorstep watching him start off
into the night.</p>

<p>"Funny though--how Fate turns things upside-down sometimes. You
can count on me--all the way." With which enigmatical remark he
shot away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Anne was on her guard when the well-drilled footsteps resolved
themselves into the sturdy figures of Stoddart and his companion,
though her heart sank at the prospect of a further and perhaps more
rigid interrogation. She instantly made up her mind that no
pressure on their part should make her swerve from her original
statement. It was not the danger to herself that lay behind what
Stoddart subsequently described as her obstinate attitude. Least
said soonest mended is never more apposite than when attempting to
fence with Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"You are certain," the inspector urged with the steely glint in
his eyes that had struck terror into more than one guilty soul,
"that you neither saw nor heard anything that night in the garden
that might throw any light on the crime?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Anne rejoined firmly, though shrinking instinctively
from meeting his eyes. "I took a turn in the garden and went back
to my bedroom."</p>

<p>After all, that was true enough as far as it went, and not all
the ingenuity of the inspector could succeed in pushing it
farther.</p>

<p>"And what about your brother--Lord Gorth that is?" Stoddart
questioned, keeping his eyes fixed on her face.</p>

<p>"How do you mean? I don't understand," she replied uneasily.</p>

<p>"What was he doing that evening--while you were out in the
garden?"</p>

<p>Anne's eyes dropped a little more perceptibly.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" she said steadily. "Playing billiards or
bridge or something in the house, I suppose. I thought you found
out what he was doing when the first investigation took place."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of his relations with Saunderson?" the
inspector pressed. "Had he business dealings with him?"</p>

<p>Anne shook her head. "I don't think he liked him very much, but
then I don't think anybody did. They had a mutual interest in
racing. But wouldn't it be better to ask Lord Gorth himself?" she
added distantly. "He can tell you a great deal more about it than I
can."</p>

<p>The inspector, ignoring the rejoinder, paused in his
interrogation and glanced at a page in his case-book. Then he said
suddenly, looking Anne full in the face:</p>

<p>"Did you know Robert Saunderson was a married man, Mrs.
Burford?"</p>

<p>The shaft drawn at a venture told. Anne flushed and caught her
breath.</p>

<p>"I didn't know it--till last night," she replied haltingly,
"when my brother told me. It came out at the inquest, he said."
Then, pulling herself together, "I had never been sufficiently
interested in Mr. Saunderson to ask if he were married or not."</p>

<p>"H'm! that may be," her interrogator remarked doubtfully; then
as Anne's eyes met his he added more kindly, "Believe me, Mrs.
Burford, there is nothing like frankness on these occasions. The
police are here not only to find the guilty but to help the
innocent, and they can't do that unless the latter make a clean
breast of it. Otherwise the sheep and the goats are liable to be
rounded up together."</p>

<p>But Anne shook her head. "I can tell you nothing more," she said
stubbornly.</p>

<p>With a shrug of his shoulders the inspector turned away. There
was nothing to be gained by divulging Miss Delauney's accusation
till they had something more substantial to go on than her bare
word.</p>

<p>"What's up, Anne?" Michael Burford asked when he came in to
luncheon later on. "Anyone been bullying you again? I won't have
it." He slipped an arm round her and drew her to the window
overlooking a square-paved garden on one side of the house.</p>

<p>"The inspector has been here--questioning me again," she said
wearily.</p>

<p>"Damn him!" was the frank rejoinder. "Send him to me next time,
Anne."</p>

<p>"But he knows that you--I mean, he thinks that I--Oh," she
wailed, "he tries to trap me into saying something about Harold--"
Fearful of saying too much, even to the man who still held her
close to him, she stopped in confusion, and as the bell summoned
them to luncheon said no more.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>At Holford Hall the midday meal was also in progress, and Lord
Medchester, perceptibly chafing under conditions that were as
unwelcome as they were inexplicable, was answering in curt
monosyllables Sybil Stainer's lively efforts at conversation.</p>

<p>From his point of view the situation was becoming unbearable.
The Stainer woman, as he called her behind her back--referring to
her in his own mind in even less complimentary terms--was getting
on his nerves; it seemed they were never to be rid of her! Her
brother, undesirable as he might be, had sufficient decency not to
appear at the Hall unless specially invited to do so by Lord
Medchester himself on such occasions as made an invitation
inevitable. But his sister had planted herself on them for days,
showed no signs of going away, and was making herself at home in a
fashion that made her unwilling host wonder how on earth his wife
could stand it.</p>

<p>He had complained to her only that morning. "I found her in the
library alone. She'd had the cheek to ring the bell--ring the bell,
if you please!--and tell George when he answered it to bring her a
cocktail. I don't mind my guests having cocktails, but I object to
a woman like that ringing the bell as if the place belonged to her
and ordering the servants about. I turned my back on her and went
out of the room--damn it all!--you can't be rude to anyone under
your own roof, and in another minute I should have said something I
should have been sorry for."</p>

<p>"Well, she'll be married soon and that'll be the end of it,"
Lady Medchester had answered, "and in the meantime I can't have her
feelings hurt."</p>

<p>"Feelings!" was the contemptuous retort. "Feelings be blowed!
That sort has got no more feelings than--" His stock of similes
failing to stand the strain of the sudden call upon it, he stopped
and began again. "I can't understand you, Minnie. I may not always
have seen eye to eye with you as regards your friends, but when it
comes to a rank outsider like Sybil Stainer it's a bit too
thick!"</p>

<p>"She is going to be your cousin by marriage, so you'd better
make the best of her." Lady Medchester sighed.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it. Harold isn't such a fool--got into some
entanglement with the woman and now is too much of a gentleman to
sheer off. I'll see to it--a word in season and soon. Something's
got to be done."</p>

<p>Lady Medchester, on the point of leaving the room, looked back
quickly.</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the sort, Dick. How can you put your oar
into other people's business in that fashion! Harold is his own
master--and I have told Sybil she can be married from here in a
couple of months' time. I don't ask you to give her away; you can
go up to London and be out of it all if you want to, but I'm not
going back on my promise. If the thing has got to be why not make
the best of it?"</p>

<p>"But why the devil should it be? That's what I want to know!"
Lord Medchester asked.</p>

<p>But his wife had already left the room and closed the door
behind her.</p>

<p>So when a few hours later they and the unwanted guest met at the
luncheon-table he was not in the best of humours. He was not
accustomed to being flouted in his own house, and he rather
resented--would not have stood it had life been running a normal
course. Easy-going up to a point, hail-fellow-well-met with all and
sundry as he might be, he had his reservations, and he was inclined
to draw the line at the Stainers.</p>

<p>And here was Lady Medchester encouraging the woman as though to
see her the wife of his cousin, the new Lord Gorth, was all that
could be desired.</p>

<p>Eating the food placed before him almost automatically while he
ruminated over the crisscrossness of life--and life had hitherto
run in even and undisturbing lines--he suddenly became aware of the
fact that his wife and Sybil Stainer were discussing the
arrangements for the latter's wedding from his house as though that
event were a settled proposition.</p>

<p>"Two months is quite long enough to wait," Sybil remarked
complacently. "A long engagement is always a mistake, and Harold
and I have known one another for quite a long time now. So if that
will suit you, Minnie, we can get on with it."</p>

<p>Lord Medchester looked across the table at his wife, who avoided
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Get on with what?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Sybil means the arrangements for her wedding," Lady Medchester
replied. "I am sure you will agree with her. I have often heard you
say there is no sense in long engagements."</p>

<p>"Miss Stainer's affairs are no concern of mine," he replied
formally, as the butler poured out his customary glass of port
before leaving the dining-room. "I was speaking on general
principles."</p>

<p>"But Minnie is making my affairs your concern, Lord Medchester,"
Sybil said with an arch smile. "It can hardly be otherwise when I
am to be married from under your own roof."</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. Lady Medchester flushed violently
and kept her eyes on her plate. Lord Medchester glared from one to
the other, evidently trying to keep himself in hand. Miss Stainer
was the only one of the trio who appeared entirely unconcerned and
mistress of the situation.</p>

<p>Her host finished his port and pushed his chair back.</p>

<p>"'Pon my soul, Minnie," he said at last, red in the face, "it's
too bad to have made these arrangements without consulting me, and,
what's more, with all due respect to Miss Stainer, who is a guest
in my house, I won't have it. I don't like weddings; 'pon my soul I
don't--tomfool affairs at the best--and Harold's too young; doesn't
know his own mind; hasn't got accustomed to being a man of
affairs." He moved towards the door, still keeping his eyes fixed
on Lady Medchester, whose nervous fingers were drawing patterns
with a fork on the table-cloth. "Also," he went on, a hand on the
door-handle, "until this business is cleared up there aren't going
to be any festivities at Holford. See what I mean? Rotten bad
taste. First a man murdered in the garden, then poor old
Mayer--known him ever so long--shot within a few yards of my own
drive! And you talk of wedding marches, eating and drinking and
what not on the place. I won't have it, 'pon my soul I won't, and
that's that!" He opened the door, turned on the threshold and
repeated emphatically, "Jolly well that, and don't you forget it!"
And, having finished what for him was a very long speech, he passed
out and shut the door behind him.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester turned a pair of distressed eyes to her guest.
"He means it, Sybil. I always know when it's no use saying any
more. He seems easy-going, but once he has really made up his mind
he sticks to it--like a mule," she added after a moment's
consideration.</p>

<p>"He will have to alter it this time," Miss Stainer rejoined
calmly. "I intend to be married from here. Maurice can give me away
if you like; after all, perhaps it will look better as he's my
brother. I don't object to that. But I intend the future Lady Gorth
to make a good start on her married career and"--she looked at the
other with a meaning smile--"you, my dear Minnie, are going to do
your best towards that desirable end," and, rising, she too left
the room.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester watched her go with miserable eyes.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" she muttered. "I can't go on with it, I
can't!" Her eyes filled slowly with tears. "I didn't know there
could be such hell upon earth!" She stared unseeingly across the
deserted table. "If it goes on much longer I shall--shall face the
music and make a clean breast of it. If I only knew how much she
knows!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>

<p>It was a fine, bright morning after a wet night. The sun was
forcing its way audaciously through the lattice-windows of the
lodge, touching with gold everything within its reach, and Miss
Tottie Delauney, responding to the call of nature, was inclined to
be loquacious. Breakfast was in progress.</p>

<p>"It isn't so much what they say, mother," she began, spreading a
piece of fresh bread left by the baker in the early hours with
butter, "it's how they say it. Asks one all sorts of questions
about little things that don't matter, and when one has got
something to say worth listening to shuts one up with, 'If you take
my advice, you'll hold your tongue. There's such a thing as the law
of libel!' Sickenin' I call it. What do they want?"</p>

<p>"Well," Mrs. Yates replied slowly from behind a heavy
electro-plate teapot that was the pride of her life, and only used
on occasions such as this--a visit from the daughter who had done
so well for herself--"maybe they know as much as you do, and don't
want it talked about till they're ready. The police know more than
they let on sometimes."</p>

<p>"They didn't know I was Bob Saunderson's lawful wife,
anyway."</p>

<p>"You are not quite sure about it yourself, are you?" her mother
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Miss Delauney tossed her head.</p>

<p>"Bob was lying when he said we weren't married. I am pretty well
sure of it, and anyway I am going to pay a visit to that Register
Office--"</p>

<p>"Which the police is likely to have done already," Mrs. Yates
interpolated.</p>

<p>"And make sure," her daughter finished, ignoring the
interruption. "As long as Bob gave me an allowance and did the
right thing by me 'twas as much to my advantage as his to be
single, and I didn't care. But I bet he's left a tidy bit, and, if
he'd died without a Will, who has so much right to it as his lawful
wife? And anyway," she added, "I'm not sure I'd have let him marry
this Anne Courtenay--'twould have been a shame on any girl." A
furtive slyness crept into her eyes as she added hastily, "Though
if I'd known she was going to murder him she could have taken her
chance. He was my own husband when all's said and done."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates looked round nervously.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Mirandy," she urged. "You
never know who's listening, and with the police here, there and
everywhere it isn't safe, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Who cares? I'm not ashamed of being Bob Saunderson's wife."</p>

<p>"That wasn't what I was thinking about--though there's something
to be said about that too. But if you go talking about Miss Anne
Courtenay that was--Mrs. Burford that is--having done the murder,
you'll find yourself in trouble. A little delicate thing like her!
Besides--"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The police say whoever it was killed Mr. Saunderson did poor
Bill Mayer in too, and if you knew Mrs. Burford as well as I do
you'd know she couldn't ha' done one murder much less two. An' it's
only guess-work you're goin' on at that. You better be careful, my
girl."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates finished her tea and, pushing her chair back, reached
for a tray propped against the wall behind her and began to clear
away the breakfast things. Her daughter looked on, making no
attempt to help her mother, and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>She then rose, strolled to the window and looked out,
indifferent to the fact that the sunshine was playing havoc with
shingled hair that was in debt rather to art than nature for its
sheen, and a complexion that had seen better days. It was early for
the visits of neighbours, and a mother was hardly worth "doing up"
for.</p>

<p>"Bill Mayer's death upset my plans more than a bit," she
remarked without turning round, "and if it hadn't been for you I
shouldn't have spoken out so soon about being at the lodge. I meant
to lie low till I found out how the land lay--about me being Bob
Saunderson's wife, I mean. It was you brought me into it by calling
me out when there was no need for it to speak to Bill Mayer. I
didn't want to come, for all you told the jury I did. I could have
been here on the Q.T. and let things take their course till the
right moment arrived for me to step forward. Who knows what it was
Bill Mayer had found out?" She paused thoughtfully, then added with
a slight irritation, "You forced my hand, mother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates, one folded comer of the blue check table-cloth
between her teeth while she doubled the rest of it carefully along
the crease, was necessarily speechless for the moment, and her
daughter went on:</p>

<p>"I grant you to have that coroner man shooting questions at you
and the jury waiting with their mouths open for the answers is a
bit rattling--more especially with that Mrs. Carthorn from Empton
with legs like a pair of tongs sitting among 'em."</p>

<p>"I don't see what that has to do with it. The jury don't listen
to the evidence with their legs, Mary Ann," her mother remonstrated
without any idea of being funny. "And why shouldn't I ha' called
you out to speak to a man you'd known all your life and hadn't seen
for a month o' Sundays?"</p>

<p>"Well, anyway you did it; and when it came out afterwards that
Bill Mayer had got himself shot not more than a few hundred yards
from this house I wasn't fool enough not to speak up. They'd have
found out sooner or later I was here--you'd never have been able to
keep it to yourself, mother, when question-time began--so I went to
the police and told 'em myself; and, what's more, I told 'em Mrs.
Michael Burford killed Bob Saunderson."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates turned round from the dresser drawer in which she was
carefully bestowing the folded cloth, dismay on her face.</p>

<p>"You never told the police that!--then you're a fool, Mary Ann!
I wondered when the coroner asked me how they'd got to know about
you bein' here. Do you suppose Mrs. Burford's 'usband is going to
sit down and let you talk like that? His lordship's cousin too!
You'd ha' been a sight wiser to ha' held your tongue and let the
police find out things for themselves!"</p>

<p>Her daughter turned on her fiercely.</p>

<p>"They'd never have found out what I knew--and that's a motive
for the crime. That's what they look for first--the motive--and I
got that out of Bob when I'd got a drop of drink into him. There
was a girl who would have to marry him or he could send her brother
to gaol. That was why he wanted to make out he wasn't married to
me. I know how to put two and two together, I do. Miss Tottie
Delauney wasn't born yesterday, I can tell you. There's motive
there right enough--and the police can get on with their
business."</p>

<p>She paused, arms on hips, chin tilted, and as Mrs. Yates stared
at her dumbly added sourly:</p>

<p>"His lordship's cousin indeed! That'll not save her. Bob
Saunderson was my husband, and I'll see she gets her deserts."</p>

<p>Her mother, removing her gaze from the angry face confronting
her, glanced anxiously through the window beyond.</p>

<p>"Hush, Mary Ann!" she urged, terror driving the colour from her
face. "Don't talk like that, somebody may be listening. If it's
motive they want--what about yourself? How can you prove you didn't
know he hadn't made a Will--and who but his wife would benefit by
his death? There's motive there all right, and," she added
tearfully, "the police know already you heard Bill Mayer say he had
got a clue to who killed Mr. Saunderson. There's motive enough,
Mary Ann! There's motive enough for the two murders--and you're a
fool to talk so free!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Mrs. Yates would not have been reassured had she known that in
their room at the "Medchester Arms" the two detectives had just
arrived at the same conclusion.</p>

<p>"That Delauney woman's story wants looking into, in my opinion,"
Harbord remarked as, having lit a cigarette, he wandered restlessly
about the room.</p>

<p>"There's more than her story that wants looking into," his
superior agreed, "and one of the queer things about this case is
the absence of alibis. I've established one or two myself, but no
one seems anxious to do it on their own account. There's Miss
Courtenay, that was, for one"--he ticked them off on his fingers as
he spoke--"and Lady Medchester, with what one might say worse than
none, the two of them by their own admission absenting themselves
from the rest of the party that night, but with no witnesses
forthcoming to prove they were doing what they said they were, and
one of them, again by her own admission, strolling about in the
garden. In the light of Miss Delauney's statement that wants a bit
more looking into--and it'll get it."</p>

<p>Stoddart leaned back in an arm-chair, covered in well-worn
American cloth and slippery from the friction of more than one
generation, and stared at the faded design of unbelievably
impossible roses presented by the carpet.</p>

<p>"Young Courtenay's record--Lord Gorth as he is now--is nothing
to boast about. He says he was either in the billiard-room or
playing bridge. He gave the names of three people he was with that
evening, and I've seen them all--Lady Frinton, Captain Maddock and
Sir James Wilson. But they can none of them vouch for his having
been there all the time, and the question is, how long an interval
may there not have been when nobody saw him? Time enough possibly
to get to the summer-house and back."</p>

<p>"And if Saunderson had his claw on him the motive was
there--same as his sister, if the Delauney story is true," Harbord
supplemented, Stoddart nodded, his eyes still glued to the
carpet.</p>

<p>"Then there's Lady Medchester. I've got my own ideas about that.
There's no doubt she was there--out in the garden--for all she said
she was in her room with headache. That man Garwood will swear to
that. Now what was she doing out there at that time of night--with
guests in the house, and then saying she wasn't?" Harbord ceased
his uneasy movements and came to a halt on the hearth-rug.</p>

<p>"What would she have wanted to kill the man for?"</p>

<p>Stoddart shrugged his shoulders. "How should I know? Jealousy
perhaps. Rumour says she and Saunderson had been pretty thick, and
you can never tell what a jealous woman will do--or man, either.
But I don't believe she did it. Not, mind you," he added quickly,
"that she doesn't know something she doesn't want to let out, and
Lord Medchester too, for that matter, but neither of them, in my
opinion, murdered Robert Saunderson."</p>

<p>He paused to light a cigarette, and the other waited
expectantly.</p>

<p>"You remember Lord Medchester's account of that last interview
he had with the superintendent? Mayer had got hold of something
important--we don't know how or what as yet--and, although he said
it might lead to nothing, he had already declared in conversation
with Mrs. Yates at the lodge that his promotion on the strength of
it was pretty well assured. According to her, he was in fine
spirits--'fresh' she called it--so much so that if it hadn't been
so early in the day she might have thought he had been having a
drop!"</p>

<p>Harbord nodded, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Mayer was a Holford man," Stoddart went on, "that's to say born
and bred at Holford, although he'd been at Medchester for some
time. You know how it is in the country--the place looking on the
squire as a little tin god. Lord Medchester owns half the
countryside round here, and was a magistrate on the Bench. Do you
think"--he paused impressively--"that if the evidence he had got
hold of implicated Lady Medchester he'd have gone bald-headed to
the Hall--to use the phone or for any other reason? You bet not!
The man would have been beside himself with not knowing what to
do--torn between his duty and disinclination. He'd have gone back
to the police station rather than face Lord Medchester in the first
flush of such information. He'd want to think it over."</p>

<p>Harbord nodded slowly. "I see what you mean, and he was on the
point of telling Lord Medchester, according to the latter's
account, what it was he had found out--would have, in fact, if he
hadn't thought better of it, and was in good spirits about it too.
No"--he shook his head--"whatever it was that had come to his
knowledge it wasn't that Lady Medchester had shot Robert
Saunderson. I grant you that."</p>

<p>They were both silent. Then Harbord added: "Funny to think that
what's written on a chap's brain is no use to anybody else."</p>

<p>Stoddart smiled. "When he's dead, you mean? Exasperating too.
Half a dozen words either to Lord Medchester or Mrs. Yates might
have saved us weeks of hard work and brought a criminal to justice.
But there it is. Must have been something he heard, or there would
surely have been some record of it. But whom did he hear it
from?"</p>

<p>"He got it, whatever it was, before he met with Miss Delauney,
or it might have been connected with her."</p>

<p>Stoddart shook his head. "No, he got it, whatever it was, before
he ran up against her." He paused. "There's another reason why we
can rule Lady Medchester out. Whoever it was shot Saunderson, shot
Mayer--all the evidence points that way. The poor chap had got
something that would have given us a line on the crime, and the
murderer knew it. Well, at the time Mayer was shot Lady Medchester
was in her room, putting on her hat to go out for the day. I got it
from the lady's maid without her knowing what I was after. A
perfectly good alibi this time all right." He rose and laid a hand
on the ancient bell-pull hanging beside the fireplace. "Talking's
thirsty work, Alfred. What do you say to a mug of Mrs. Marlow's
ale?"</p>

<p>"I've known worse," the other assented heartily. "I wish it
would put something into our heads that would give us a line on
this tangle."</p>

<p>He waited till an old-fashioned toby jug, crowned with bubbling
foam, and a couple of pewter tankards stood on the table between
them and then he resumed.</p>

<p>"If--remember I say <i>if</i>--Miss Delauney's story is true--it
savours a bit too much of the film to please me--then one question
that's been worrying us might find an answer. That is, what brought
Robert Saunderson back to Holford when, his visit having come to an
end, he had ostensibly left it for good?"</p>

<p>The other nodded. "Yes; that struck me too. If Saunderson was
mixed up, so to speak, with Harold Courtenay and his sister, he
could have arranged a meeting with either or both in the
summer-house on the Q.T. From what we have discovered about
Saunderson he might well want to keep the business as secret as
possible--and if it was meeting a lady he'd hardly expect her to
travel up to London to meet him."</p>

<p>"I wonder how much Burford knows?" Stoddart took a pull at the
tankard and wiped his lips before speaking.</p>

<p>"I've wondered that before now. He married Miss Courtenay in the
middle of it all, which looks as if he thought her innocent,
anyway."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of her so much as I was of him. His alibi is
all right the night Saunderson was shot; but if Miss Delauney's
story is correct he may have got a line on what Mayer knew that
might implicate his wife. His movements on the day Mayer was shot
are open to question. He says he was away on the downs that
morning, and one of the stablemen testifies to having taken his
horse from him when he came in. But the man can't swear to where
he'd been to, and no one else either--so far as I can make out. So
long as there appeared to be nothing to bring him into this
business, I only looked into his movements on general principles,
as one might say. But if this story is true, and Saunderson was
using his hold over young Courtenay as a lever for forcing his
sister into marrying him? He didn't do it himself perhaps, but
Michael Burford comes into it good and plenty!"</p>

<p>"Gives him a motive, don't you see? Miss Anne Courtenay was
engaged to marry Mr. Michael Burford, and if the latter had got an
inkling of how the land lay--well, any man might see red and even
things up. His alibi may be sound, but the motive's there all
right."</p>

<p>Harbord looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"When a line of inquiry is more or less perfunctory," Stoddart
continued, "one may accept a plausible alibi at its face value. But
if--we must still say if--in Mr. Burford's case, motive can be
proved, weak spots in an alibi become apparent and a more rigid
investigation becomes necessary. For instance, on pushing the
matter further, if it should transpire the evidence of the helper
is based only on the fact that Mr. Burford said he had only been on
the downs it means nothing; it's easy for him to have been to
Holford in the time."</p>

<p>"Miss Delauney's story has got to be proved," Harbord objected.
"We've only got her word for what Saunderson is supposed to have
told her at the night-club, and even if that part's true we don't
know for certain that he was talking about the Courtenays."</p>

<p>Stoddart rose. "Right you are," he said with a sigh, "it's a
baffling case. So many in it--or seems so--and all of them slippery
as eels. But there's one thing, Alfred," he said, turning to the
other, who had also risen, "you remember those beads? I didn't let
anything about them come out at the inquest, and Mrs. Burford isn't
likely to have talked."</p>

<p>"Well, what about them?" Harbord asked, his eyes brightening
with interest.</p>

<p>"I've got a notion about those beads," Stoddart said
thoughtfully. "Can't tell you why, but I have an idea somebody
knows more about them than she lets on."</p>

<p>"Who?" Harbord shot the question at him.</p>

<p>"Lady Medchester," was the answer, "and I am going to make it my
business to find out. Presumably in her room with a headache, and
the same lady seen by Garwood near the summer-house that evening,
are two different propositions."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER 18</h2>

<p>Anne Burford sat with her hands before her, staring into the
empty grate.</p>

<p>Life that had seemed so full of promise, of which in Michael
Burford's love she thought she had plucked its fairest blossom, was
withering into Dead Sea fruit in her mouth. She rose every morning
with a dead weight of misery to be faced; went to bed at night
thankful another day was safely past.</p>

<p>It had nothing to do with Michael. He was all she had pictured
him, a kind, thoughtful, loving husband. Busy all day--and she
hated an idle man--in the stables, superintending the morning
gallops over the smooth, green uplands crowned with heather and
stretching away to the west, often occupied in the office with the
business side of his calling, or interviewing applicants that had
to be dealt with personally, she had no wish to intrude her own
worries and anxieties. Indeed, she felt it would not be of much use
if she did, for unless she made a clean breast of it, telling him
everything--<i>everything</i>--he would not be really in a position
to help her.</p>

<p>He knew something. He believed Harold had not committed the
murder. But how could she tell him to what extent her brother had
been involved in the events of that evening without betraying the
fact that he had been willing to sacrifice his sister's lifelong
happiness for his own salvation? How could she tell him that?</p>

<p>The more immediate worry was her prospective sister-in-law,
Sybil Stainer.</p>

<p>How much did she know about the affair of that night--and how
little? The latter point was of almost as much importance as the
first, for Anne had a suspicion that half Miss Stainer's
insinuations were pure bluff; and bluff when applied to a guilty
conscience may go far.</p>

<p>Whatever it was she had found out it was something that
mattered, something that had put Minnie Medchester, Harold,
herself, and who knew how many more, in her power. As far as she
herself was concerned, she knew well enough what she feared. If she
only had the courage to demand an explanation, or to defy her
openly, it might prove that Sybil Stainer was banking on some
slight negligible trifle, enough to give her an inkling of more
lying behind, but not enough to justify putting on the screw in the
way she was doing, and apparently doing so successfully. If Anne
had had nothing to hide--and, oh, how bitterly she wished she had
not--she might possibly have been in a position to burst Sybil
Stainer's bubble by a few well-directed questions.</p>

<p>She was not afraid for Harold, as circumstances were at the
moment. The future Lady Gorth would have no wish to bring discredit
in any form on the man whom she proposed to marry, and through whom
she would be able to satisfy her dearest ambitions. Harold now
could give her both wealth and position. And yet there must be some
screw she could turn even in regard to Harold, some lever that
could force him to fall in with her designs. For Anne had no doubt
in her mind that this marriage was as distasteful to her brother as
it was to the rest of the family, and she thanked God that her
grandfather, with his pride and fine traditions, was at peace in a
world to which it was to be hoped no Sybil Stainers were likely to
gain admittance.</p>

<p>But, if for some reason the marriage were to fall through, or
Harold refuse to go through with it, what then? If the prospective
satisfaction of personal ambition were to be changed into a desire
for revenge, what would be the woman's attitude? What was it she
knew that could be turned into an effective weapon to be directed
against Anne herself or her brother? Sitting there with miserable
eyes staring in front of her, Anne knew well there was enough and
to spare that she might know--the point was, what did she know?</p>

<p>But to that there was no answer. The police, who should be
regarded as friends by the innocent, had been transformed by
circumstances into potential enemies. Once the events that had led
to that assignation in the summer-house were known, and the
relations between herself, her brother, and Robert Saunderson made
clear, the police would see motive enough to hang a man twice over.
He might have agreed to his sister's sacrifice in the first dismay
at his own position, but what more natural than that when actually
faced with its accomplishment he should have taken any desperate
means of frustrating it?</p>

<p>She might herself believe--and did--in his innocence
unswervingly, but it would be a different matter to get the police
to see it in the same light. Also, if investigation were to be
pushed to its limits, how was she going to exonerate herself?</p>

<p>The sound of a motor-horn and the throb of a car outside,
followed by a ring of the door-bell, brought her back to
realities.</p>

<p>The next moment Lady Medchester and Miss Stainer were announced.
Anne felt thankful she was not called upon to face the latter
alone.</p>

<p>"For a newly married wife you don't look over-happy, Anne,"
Minnie Medchester remarked, with an attempt to give a free-and-easy
tone to the conversation. "I hope it doesn't portend a little rift
in the matrimonial lute? I've brought Sybil over to see you. She's
got a message for you or something of the kind. First time I've
been here since you were settled. Quite pretty"--she looked round
appraisingly and sank into an armchair--"though a bit too bare of
furniture for my taste. The last time I came you had hardly got the
furniture arranged."</p>

<p>"I am very happy, thank you," Anne rejoined, successfully
avoiding an attempt on Sybil's part to implant a kiss on her
cheek.</p>

<p>"Your looks belie it then," Miss Stainer sneered. "But we didn't
come, Minnie and I, to inquire after your health. I have brought a
message from Harold."</p>

<p>Anne raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I should have thought my brother might have been his own
messenger," she said coldly.</p>

<p>"That's a nice thing to say to his future wife! the girl he is
going to be married to in two months time. It would serve you right
if--"</p>

<p>"Now, Sybil," Lady Medchester interrupted,</p>

<p>"Anne doesn't mean to be disagreeable. It's quite natural for a
sister to be a bit jealous when her brother--her only brother--is
going to be married."</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> approve of this marriage, Cousin Minnie?" Anne
asked, looking directly at her guest.</p>

<p>The colour rushed into Lady Medchester's face and ebbed
again.</p>

<p>"Why insist on the 'Cousin,' Anne?" she said evasively. "You are
a married woman now, and there are not so many years between us
when all's said and done. It makes me feel as if I had come out of
the Ark."</p>

<p>"As 'this marriage,' as you call it, is going to take place from
Holford Hall, you may take Minnie's approval for granted," Sybil
said aggressively. "As Lady Gorth I shall have to live in this
neighbourhood, and I intend to be treated decently by Harold's
relations. Let me tell you, Anne Burford," her voice rising with
her temper, "as Lady Gorth's sister-in-law you may consider
yourself to a certain degree safe from--you know what as well as I
do. But, if anything should interfere with my marriage to your
brother, I should have no more consideration for you or your family
than that!" and she snapped her fingers as an inelegant indication
of contempt.</p>

<p>"Now, Sybil," Lady Medchester remonstrated, "what's the use of
getting excited about it? Anne will be all right when the time
comes. You can't expect Harold's relations to be overjoyed about
his marriage to--to--" She broke off awkwardly, finding herself
getting into deep water. "Well, as Lord Gorth he might have married
an American heiress and brought a bit of money into the family.
He'll want it before he's paid off the death duties."</p>

<p>"It's always the way--when a girl does well for herself,
everybody's down upon her. What's Lord Gorth or his precious sister
either, I should like to know, that they should turn up their noses
at me? The Stainers are as good as they are any day. When I'm Lady
Gorth they'll all be ready enough to eat out of my hand! I know
them!"</p>

<p>Anne winced at the blatant vulgarity, and even Lady Medchester
put up a restraining hand.</p>

<p>"Come, Sybil, don't talk such stuff. Goodness knows I'm doing
the best I can for you--the wedding to be from Holford, and your
brother to stay for the night and give you away. What more do you
want?"</p>

<p>"And Lord Medchester swearing he will have business in town that
day and won't appear at the wedding--and he head of the family!"
Sybil replied angrily.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Harold's head of his own family now, and you will
have nothing to complain of." She rose. "Give Anne your message,
and let's get back. It's getting late."</p>

<p>Miss Stainer, who was already regretting a loss of temper out of
harmony with her claim to have the whip-hand, pulled herself
together.</p>

<p>"It will be much wiser of you to be friends, Anne." The girl she
addressed winced at the use of her Christian name. "I am not one to
bear malice--but I mean to have my rights."</p>

<p>"Give the message, Sybil, and come along," Lady Medchester
urged.</p>

<p>"Harold says it will be better if you and he don't meet at
present," Sybil said with slow satisfaction. "The fact is, he
doesn't like your attitude with regard to his marriage--and me. He
thinks the less you see of one another the more likely you are to
keep the peace. Harold doesn't mean to stand any nonsense about his
future wife, I can tell you!" And with a curt nod she followed Lady
Medchester to the waiting car.</p>

<p>Hardly had the sound of it died away in the distance before the
door-bell rang again, and Anne, with a gesture of impatience and an
effort to resume her ordinary demeanour after the trying interview
with her late visitors, found herself confronted by Inspector
Stoddart, this time alone. She felt unprepared, and at the appeal
in her eyes even the stem eyes of the law appreciably softened.</p>

<p>Stoddart paused on the threshold, taking stock of the slender
lines of Anne's girlish figure, the small, piquant features, the
little hands, fingers entwining themselves nervously with one
another as he stepped into the room and closed the door behind him.
With a natural habit of appraising character and weighing the value
of evidence, a vision of Miss Delauney rose in his mind, powdered,
bedizened, all agog for the enforcement of her rights. If evidence
were to be produced wholly dependent on the statement of either of
these two women, whose word would he most readily take?</p>

<p>He had no doubt of the answer in his own mind. Moreover, he
flattered himself that after vast experience he knew a criminal
type when he met it. There would have to be considerably more
evidence forthcoming before he believed Anne Burford to be a
murderess on the word of the so-called Tottie Delauney.</p>

<p>But inquiry along the line her accusation suggested might yield
fruit. In spite of the number of possible suspects, he and Harbord
did not seem to be getting any nearer the solution. It might almost
be said they couldn't see the wood for the trees. There would be
trouble with headquarters if they did not get on a line of some
sort soon, and there would be no harm in pressing Anne for a more
detailed account of her relations with Saunderson. That in turn
might yield something suggestive with regard to Lord Gorth, whose
account of himself on the fatal evening left much to be
desired--with his acknowledged proximity to the scene of action and
an alibi whose armour was full of joints.</p>

<p>At Anne's invitation the inspector sat down.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be alarmed about, Mrs. Burford," he began.
"I have really come to ask you to do me a slight service. But first
as a mere matter of form I should like to know where you were on
the afternoon of Superintendent Mayer's death. Between eleven and
twelve o'clock in the morning?"</p>

<p>Anne's fingers relaxed their nervous grip and she raised her
eyes frankly.</p>

<p>"I was here, inspector, here in my own house. I remember it,
because my husband brought me the news of the police
superintendent's murder just before dinner that evening; he heard
it from one of the stable-men, and I hadn't been out of the house
all day. If you want corroboration," she added, smiling wanly--here
at all events she was on safe ground--"I had a friend with me and
she didn't leave until nearly half-past twelve. If you want her
name and address--"</p>

<p>But the inspector put up his hand.</p>

<p>"Time enough for that," he smiled, mentally adding another mark
in Anne's favour; he felt so sure one and the same hand had been
guilty of both murders, and if Anne could establish this alibi she
was at all events not guilty of Mayer's. "Am I right in thinking
Mr. Robert Saunderson was not a favourite of yours?"</p>

<p>"You are quite right," was the emphatic answer.</p>

<p>"Why--particularly?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly at all, I just didn't like him." The blood
rushed to Anne's face as she felt herself again on thin ice. "I
don't like--that sort of man."</p>

<p>"Nothing against him personally?"</p>

<p>Anne gulped down her scruples and shook her head. Frankness
would involve her brother; she lied bravely.</p>

<p>"And you are sure you neither heard nor saw anything suspicious
while you were taking that walk in the garden?" Then, going off
apparently at a tangent, "Were you wearing your crystal beads that
night?"</p>

<p>Anne looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"No," she said slowly. "I thought you knew--"</p>

<p>"I knew the broken string found on the scene of the murder
didn't belong to you, but you might have been wearing your
own."</p>

<p>"I wasn't," she replied, still wondering what the question had
to do with the matter, "and I have never worn them since. I hate
the sight of them: they remind me--of all I want to forget."</p>

<p>"I can quite understand that," the inspector agreed in his
matter-of-fact voice. "But I am going to ask you to wear them
again. This is what I want you to do." And drawing his chair closer
to Anne's he dropped his voice.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour or more the murmur of voices might have
been heard in that pleasant room looking out on the emerald downs,
across which Anne's husband at that moment was walking briskly
towards the house.</p>

<p>He entered the house a few minutes after Inspector Stoddart had
left and opened the door of the room where Anne was still standing,
staring thoughtfully through the window in an effort to follow the
inner working of the inspector's brain.</p>

<p>"That police chap has been here again, hasn't he? I saw him
crossing the hill towards Medchester. Hasn't been bullying you, has
he? What did he want?" her husband asked.</p>

<p>"What a lot of questions! I can't answer them all at once. He
certainly hasn't been bullying me," she replied, making light of
the visit. "He only wanted to know where I was the morning the
police superintendent--Mayer his name was, wasn't it?--was shot;
said he had to ask everybody as a matter of form."</p>

<p>"And where were you?"</p>

<p>"I was here--Rosie Meekins motored over, but wouldn't stay to
lunch, so I had my alibi pat. To find oneself in such a horrible
world of suspicion! It takes all the joy out of everything." She
flung herself into a chair and hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Michael Burford dropped on to the arm of it and drew her to
him.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, darling," he comforted. "Harold will come through
all right. The police can't take him upon suspicion alone. So far
as we know, nothing has been definitely proved against him yet. The
only thing that worries me," he added, as Anne, yielding to the
sense of security the touch of the man she loved gave her, dried
her tears, "is, why Harold is going to marry that awful woman. It
almost looks as if--"--he hesitated--"as if she knew something he
didn't want other people to know."</p>

<p>"Blackmail," Anne said tersely.</p>

<p>Burford nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>"Well, as long as she hopes to marry him, she'll keep it to
herself," his wife rejoined, and finished sadly, "poor old Harold!
Do you know," she went on, sitting up and leaning her head on the
shoulder so near her own, "whatever it is, I believe Cousin Minnie
must be in it too. Minnie has her faults--lots of them, and she
hates <i>me</i> for some reason, and always has--but she wouldn't
put up with a woman like Sybil Stainer unless she was obliged
to!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Two days later in their comfortable sitting-room at the
"Medchester Arms" Inspector Stoddart and Harbord were coming to the
same conclusion. They were quite conscious that a woman of Miss
Stainer's type would not have been tolerated unless some very good
reason lay behind.</p>

<p>"Since Garwood told his story we know Lady Medchester has
something to hide. When she said she had not been outside that
evening she lied, and people don't lie unless they have something
to lie about, and Miss Stainer may have tumbled to what it is. I'm
not quite ready to face Lady Medchester with Garwood's statement
yet, but I have found out something and it was no more than I
expected."</p>

<p>Harbord looked at him inquiringly. "What was it? Got a line on
Mayer's source of information?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "No; I wish I had. But I got an idea
Lady Medchester knew more about those crystal beads than she let
on, and I laid a trap for her. It turned out I was right--and I was
wrong."</p>

<p>"That doesn't seem to get us on much," Harbord said with a
laugh, as he lighted up. "May one ask, sir, exactly what you
mean?"</p>

<p>"What I found out was that she doesn't know as much about those
beads as she thought she did. And, as you say, it doesn't seem to
help us on overmuch. What I did was this," he went on as the other
looked at him expectantly. "I asked for another interview with Lady
Medchester, having first enlisted Mrs. Burford's help to carry out
my notion. It was arranged for this afternoon in the library at
Holford. I put a few questions to her more to mark time than for
any result I hoped to get from them, and I confess I was a bit
tempted to spring Garwood's tale on her and see how she took
it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Because so far it's a case of hard swearing between the two of
them. Garwood says she was out in the garden, she says she wasn't,
and there you are. I believe his story all right, but we've got to
get a bit more to go on."</p>

<p>"Well, what was the idea?"</p>

<p>"I had stationed Mrs. Burford outside the library door, and at a
given signal--a loud cough from me--she was to walk into the room
as if by accident, which she did--with her own string of crystal
beads hanging conspicuously round her neck." He laughed
reminiscently and lit a cigarette. "Mrs. Burford stood in the
doorway as if taken aback at finding her cousin engaged; did it to
the life, and I never took my eyes off Lady Medchester's face.</p>

<p>"When she saw Mrs. Burford standing there, the beads gleaming on
her neck, she went white as a sheet, caught her breath, and stared
till I thought her eyes would have dropped out. 'Why, Anne,' she
cried, pointed a hand at the necklace and dropped it at her side,
'where did that--Why, I thought--' and stopped short, fearful no
doubt of saying too much. 'Why, Cousin Minnie, what's the matter?'
Mrs. Burford asked, genuinely astonished, for I hadn't told her
just what I was after.</p>

<p>"Lady Medchester pulled herself together. 'The matter,' she
repeated angrily and evasively, 'when you come into the room like a
Jack-in-the-box! It's enough to startle anybody!' 'Whom do those
beads belong to, Lady Medchester?' I asked sternly. 'And why were
you taken aback at the sight of them?'</p>

<p>"She looked from them to me as if she could have killed me. 'I
haven't the least idea!' she stammered, then realizing she was
giving herself away, added, 'At least, I suppose they belong to
Mrs. Burford, as she is wearing them round her neck!'</p>

<p>"But my little trap had succeeded. I had found out what I wanted
to know."</p>

<p>"What was that?" Harbord asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Lady Medchester had imagined the beads found after the murder
belonged to Anne Courtenay," Stoddart replied slowly, "and when she
saw that string hanging round Mrs. Burford's neck she got the
surprise of her life. What I should like to know is this--why did
Lady Medchester get the shock of her life when she realized the
beads found in Saunderson's pocket did not belong to Anne
Courtenay?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER 19</h2>

<p>Mrs. Mayer was taking her trouble hardly. As she had passed out
of the depressing, whitened walls of the Cottage Hospital where her
husband had just gasped out the last words he would ever speak in
this world, she felt the light had gone out of her life. Like other
women of a certain type, she was inclined to give way to her
feelings as long as there was some hope left; but, that once swept
away, the calmness of a great despair had enveloped her, and she
had arrived at her home feeling as though the bottom had fallen out
of the world.</p>

<p>She and Bill Mayer had led such a happy life together. In that
lay her one drop of comfort. She might be suffering at the moment
more than many other wives bereft like herself, but whoever may be
the presiding genius in charge of life's scales sees to it that the
balance is kept pretty even, and at least there was no touch of
remorse in her grief.</p>

<p>She could look back over the years without any of the gnawing
regret so many wives experience in the first flush of realizing the
time has gone irrevocably for undoing any regrettable act in the
past.</p>

<p>She and her husband had had the usual tiffs of married life, and
had made them up; no one could nurse resentment long in face of her
Bill's good-humoured smile, backed as often as not by the remark
that they wouldn't be entering for the flitch of bacon that year.
But she had been a good wife to him, borne him children, and made
his home a comfortable haven to come back to after a day's work.
She had nothing to blame herself about in that way, and many a time
he had looked at her, a twinkle in his eyes, and congratulated
himself on knowing how to appreciate a good thing when he'd got
it.</p>

<p>As a husband and father no one could have asked for better.
Rising steadily in his profession step by step, he had reached the
position of superintendent by a stolid devotion to duty and
intelligence, not always apparent in country districts where
experience is necessarily more limited than in large cities. He had
won the respect of his superiors, and Stoddart had spoken no more
than the truth when he said, "Those little pig's eyes of his see
more than you think."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer was suffering from the greatest loss it is possible
for a woman to suffer in this world--that of a good husband.</p>

<p>Betty Morgan, her daughter, married to a baker and living on the
edge of the town, had been waiting for her mother when she returned
from that sad visit to the hospital. She had been hastily summoned
from her own home, and read all she needed to know in the stony
despair of her mother's eyes.</p>

<p>"He's gone," Mrs. Mayer said, dropping into a sleepless night,
and insisted on doing her share towards getting the breakfast and
putting the house straight.</p>

<p>Betty Morgan, having a husband and children to see to, caught
the eleven o'clock bus from Medchester town hall, next door to the
police station, leaving her mother with a promise to return early
in the afternoon. Both her sisters were in service, and her
brother, following in his father's footsteps, had become a
policeman; being stationed in a far-away Devonshire town, he could
only hope for leave to come home in time for his father's funeral.
She felt therefore that the care of her mother devolved for the
moment entirely upon herself, Mrs. Mayer shrinking from seeing any
kindly-intentioned neighbours in the first flush of her grief.</p>

<p>By three o'clock Betty Morgan was back at the police
station.</p>

<p>She found her mother sitting in the kitchen, hat and coat on,
and concluded with slight surprise she had been to the only decent
draper's shop the town could boast to see about mourning.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Mayer fiercely repudiated any such suggestion.</p>

<p>"Not me!" she said, adding with a curious note of defiance,
"I've been to see the place where your poor father was killed.
That's where I've been."</p>

<p>"Whatever made you do that, mother?" Betty raised her
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I? It's natural enough; and I had a feelin'
somehow"--she hesitated and pulled off her hat--"I don't know why,
but I just wanted to go and see it before every sightseer in the
place went treadin' about there. It's sacred ground to me--can't
you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps I can," the other said gently. "Not far from the
lodge, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not more than a few hundred yards. I found the spot easy enough
by the description, leastways thereabouts. I knew I was right
because--"</p>

<p>"Because why?" her daughter asked, hanging her coat and hat on a
peg in a corner.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Mayer shut her mouth with a snap and left the sentence
unfinished.</p>

<p>"Susan Yates called to me as I came back through the lodge
gates," she went on, glancing furtively at Betty, "wants to come
and see me. Very kind she was."</p>

<p>Betty nodded.</p>

<p>"But I asked her to wait a day or so," Mrs. Mayer continued. "I
don't feel up to it. She had somebody staying in the house with
her; I don't know who it was, but somebody pulled a blind down in
one of the bedrooms while we were talkin'."</p>

<p>At the inquest two days later Mrs. Mayer learnt the visitor at
the lodge had been "that there Mary Ann Yates, or Saunderson, or
Delauney, or whatever she calls herself." Her own evidence, being
practically nil, she was quickly through. After informing the court
that the superintendent had left her in the morning as usual for
Empton, and had never returned, that was all she had to tell, and
when given she had been allowed to leave the court and go home.</p>

<p>Then had come a visit from the inspector. That was two days
after the inquest, and the day before the funeral.</p>

<p>"I've come to tell you, Mrs. Mayer," Stoddart said, removing his
hat as she opened the door to him and following her into the little
parlour, "that there isn't a man in the Force who is not
sympathizing with you in your trouble. It's a bad job, that it
is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer's face hardened. She was too sore and her wound too
fresh to be able to look at things dispassionately, and in some
unreasonable fashion she was inclined to hold Scotland Yard
responsible for her husband's death. What was the good of the
police if they let honest members of their own force be murdered in
broad daylight?</p>

<p>So she nodded her head and remained silent. Inspector Stoddart
coughed and blew his nose; not because it required it, but merely
to give him time. He was not sure of what to say on occasions such
as this.</p>

<p>"I was thinking, Mrs. Mayer," he began again, "now the inquest
is over, and perhaps you may be settling down a bit, there might be
some little thing you might remember--all you've had to go through
is enough to upset anybody's memory--that maybe might give us a
line on what it was that came to the superintendent's knowledge
between his leaving you in the morning and his meeting with Mrs.
Yates at the Holford lodge gates. A lot hangs on that; and you'll
be wanting to track the villain that murdered him as much or more
than we do at the Yard. Was he to your knowledge expecting to hear
of anything?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer shook her head. Her eyes travelled uneasily round the
room, and something in her manner urged him to press the point.</p>

<p>"No," she said shortly, "there wasn't anything; not that I knew
of. But Bill kep' his business affairs, as he called them, to
himself sometimes. Not that he didn't trust me," she added
fiercely, "but he liked to get away from them--forget he was a
policeman, he used to say."</p>

<p>"I can quite understand that, and I'm sure you would have no
wish to hide anything from the Yard, Mrs. Mayer."</p>

<p>The hearty assent expected by the inspector was not forthcoming.
Mrs. Mayer dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>"Surely," he went on, slightly puzzled by her manner, "you would
keep nothing back that would help us to trace the criminal?"</p>

<p>This time the reply came eagerly enough; a look of relief
lightened Mrs. Mayer's pale blue eyes as she looked him straight in
the face.</p>

<p>"I surely would not! I'd give years of my life to catch him! But
I can't help you; I can only say what I said at the inquest--I
don't believe Bill had a thing in his mind when he started off that
morning for Empton. Mrs. Yates and that daughter of hers, besides
his lordship, talked of his being in high spirits owing to his
promotion being likely. Well, there was nothing o' that when he
left me, and if he talked like that to his lordship and sundry,
ain't it likely he'd ha' said something of it to his lawful wife?
No," as her visitor rose, "if he heard anything, as you say, it was
something he learnt that morning after he'd left and before he saw
Mrs. Yates at the lodge. You can take it from me."</p>

<p>"I suppose I must, and thank you. There'll be a bit of a pension
for you, Mrs. Mayer--the superintendent was killed while doing his
duty. Not much, I'm afraid, but it's all to the good."</p>

<p>"Thank you, inspector," she replied quietly, "but I'm not
worrying about that. His lordship'll see to it--Bill having died
inside of his own gates, so to speak. He isn't one to let a poor
woman suffer, even though my family is out in the world and all.
Still a bit of pension will be all to the good."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "If anything should turn up you'll know
where to find me," he said kindly and left, cudgelling his brains
for a solution to what appeared to be now an insoluble problem.</p>

<p>As the door closed on him Mrs. Mayer glanced round her with a
hint of secretiveness in her eyes. She was alone in the house. Her
son from Devonshire was to arrive in the evening, her daughter had
gone home to put a finishing touch to her own mourning to wear at
the funeral. Instead of going back into the kitchen where Betty had
left the potatoes for dinner peeled and ready for boiling, she
slipped up the short flight of narrow stairs into the bedroom she
and her husband had shared for so many happy years, and closed the
door softly behind her.</p>

<p>Tiptoeing across the room, although there was no one in the
house to hear her, she opened a drawer in an old-fashioned piece of
furniture standing against the wall and slipped her hand into the
back of it.</p>

<p>At the same moment the door below opened and a footstep crossed
the passage. Mrs. Mayer drew her hand back as though it had been
stung, closed the drawer as softly as she had opened it, and stood
up.</p>

<p>"There's Betty back." She stood still and her eyes filled with
tears. "I don't care," she muttered defiantly, "not if it is the
law of the land! Not if the King of England was himself to ask on
his bended knees. Yes, Betty, coming," she cried in answer to her
daughter's voice calling her from below, and with a backward glance
to make sure the drawer was safely closed she went downstairs.</p>

<p>"I saw Mrs. Yates in the town, mother," Betty said, divesting
herself of hat and coat. "She says she's coming in to see you day
after tomorrow."</p>

<p>"So long as she don't bring that daughter of hers with her I
shall be glad enough to see Susan Yates," her mother replied
without enthusiasm. "When's she coming?"</p>

<p>"I told her to look in somewhere about four o'clock and you'd
give her a cup of tea. It'll be early closing and Frank'll be
having his afternoon off, so it'll be company for you. Frank'll
want me at home."</p>

<p>"You've been very good to me, dearie," Mrs. Mayer said warmly,
"but I got to stick it out, I suppose--moving and all that. How
I'll do it, God knows! Susan Yates lost her husband a matter of
five years ago now, and his lordship let her five on at the lodge.
That's the worst of living in a police station--very nice while it
lasts, but the widow has to break up her home and clear out when
her husband leaves her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer looked round the little room and sighed. It was so
familiar, and yet with life turned grey and the pivot of her very
existence removed it all looked flat and unresponsive. The clock on
the mantelpiece that she and Bill had bought when he got promoted
to sergeant still ticked on with the same monotonous perseverance
as ever, but it seemed somehow to be telling quite a different
story. The chenille table-cloth that she had bought out of savings
on the housekeeping one year and been a surprise for her husband
who always had an eye for a bit of bright colour; the arm-chair
worn almost through to the stuffing where his elbow had rubbed it;
the broken bar round the fender which one of them had remarked
ought to be mended at least once a week since it had got broken
months before--all, everything reminded her of the companion who
was gone. Life seemed very empty.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>When Mrs. Yates paid the promised visit two days later she found
her old acquaintance a trifle more settled in her mind. The funeral
was over. It had been well attended, for Superintendent Mayer had
been respected not only by his companions in the Force, but by the
whole countryside. "Very gratifying for you, Mary," her visitor
consoled, "on foot and in cars--the mayor and the gentry all turned
out to pay respect to poor Bill's memory; and not more than they
should do, either. He died doing his duty, and what can a man do
more?"</p>

<p>The platitude seemed to bring comfort of a sort. Mrs. Mayer
nodded and poured out the tea with a hand that shook pitifully.</p>

<p>"Hard on you having to move. I was lucky that way," the other
went on. "Seems like tearing you up by the roots. Have you got a
place to go to yet, Mary? Perhaps Betty'll take you for a bit while
you have a look round?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer shook her head. "I don't hold with plumping yourself
down on other people--maybe where you're not wanted. There's a
cottage belonging to his lordship on the edge of Holford Common
he's offered me--rent free too--and I'm to move in soon as I
can."</p>

<p>"Is the new superintendent appointed yet?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but he will be almost at once, and I must get out
of this," Mrs. Mayer said drearily.</p>

<p>"You poor thing! Well, I know what you're suffering. I felt just
like that when my Tom was took. Mighty bad it is, whatever way you
look at it."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Mrs. Mayer cut her guest another
slice from the loaf and pushed the butter towards her.</p>

<p>"Your girl's with you, isn't she?" she asked after a pause.
"Funny her being married like that and you not knowing. To that Mr.
Saunderson too--and he murdered."</p>

<p>"They don't seem getting on much about who murdered him," Susan
Yates remarked. "I don't understand Mary Ann. You'd think she was
taking it to heart the way she goes on, and yet I know she
isn't--not because she was fond of him, that is."</p>

<p>"She'll get a good bit of money, won't she?" the other asked
curiously. "Bill told me as how it didn't seem there was a
Will--died intestinal don't they call it?--and the wife'll get most
of what's going."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Yates felt herself to be on thin ice and disinclined to
discuss the point. Mary Ann had done nothing so far as she knew to
establish her claims as Saunderson's widow, and, with a slippery
customer such as he had been, there was no saying whether the form
of marriage gone through at the Marylebone Register Office might
not prove to have been a sham. Saunderson himself had said it was,
but Mary Ann had not believed him. At any further reference to the
subject her daughter turned crusty and said there was time enough
to go into the rights and wrongs of it later on.</p>

<p>"She shuts herself up in her room and won't see anybody," Mrs.
Yates went on evasively, "and goes white if you so much as mention
the police. She's talked too free to the police as it is, in my
opinion, and I told her so, and ever since she keeps her mouth shut
like a mouse-trap and won't speak."</p>

<p>"That's a sight better than talking too much," Mrs. Mayer
replied with the wisdom born of many years' close contact with a
member of His Majesty's police force.</p>

<p>"Truth is, if you ask me," the other observed, "I believe she's
frightened, and it was I that did it. There's a lot of talk about
motive these days, and if it comes to motive--who's going to
benefit by Saunderson's death more than his wife?" She glanced over
her shoulder and lowered her voice. "That's what I says to her.
She'll have to face it all in the long run. It's no sort of use
trying to keep anything from the police--within reason, that's to
say."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer turned scared eyes on her visitor.</p>

<p>"Not keep anything from the police!" she echoed in a voice that
had turned shrill. "Depends what it is," with a note of defiance in
her manner. "If it don't do anybody any harm--"</p>

<p>"They'll find it out sooner or later," Mrs. Yates put in, "bound
to, and then where are you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer lowered her eyes and with nervous fingers rolled her
handkerchief into a tight ball under the shelter of the
table-cloth.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you keep anything from the police, Susan?" she asked
earnestly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates hesitated.</p>

<p>"Tom kept something back once--nothing to matter, nothing he'd
done himself--but they found it out. They always find out,
Mary."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer glanced about her nervously.</p>

<p>"There's things," she said in a thin, high voice again, "that
don't hurt anybody--I wouldn't tell the police, not for all you
could offer me!"</p>

<p>The other looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"And you the widder of a superintendent, Mary!"</p>

<p>"It's because of that I say it," was the enigmatical reply. "And
there's things I wouldn't tell the police--not if it was ever
so--and I'm not ashamed of it, either!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER 20</h2>

<p>Inspector Stoddart, sitting at his desk at Scotland Yard, had
decided to confront Lady Medchester with Garwood's statement--that
he had seen her in the gardens at Holford on the night and about
the time of Robert Saunderson's murder.</p>

<p>He had always had a suspicion she knew more than she had
admitted, and congratulated himself on the brain-wave that had
prompted the little trap he laid for her, and for which he had
invoked Anne's innocent connivance. He had been certain she knew
something about those beads; he had discovered by his ruse she did
not know so much as she thought she did. She had imagined they
belonged to Anne.</p>

<p>The inspector had no love for Lady Medchester. He felt
instinctively hers was a mean mind, secretive and vindictive. Where
it served her purpose he suspected her to be capable of going to
great lengths to gain her own ends: no scruples would be allowed to
interfere with their achievement. He could easily understand why
she and Anne had never been friends, a fact well known in the
neighbourhood; their natures were apart as the poles. He believed
Garwood's tale and wondered in his own mind whether it had been she
who had made an assignation with Saunderson that night in the
summer-house. Somebody had, that was certain, and rumour had been
pretty free in coupling their names together.</p>

<p>The definite clues they had to the crime were more or less
unsatisfactory and seemed likely to lead to nothing; the slip of
paper found in Saunderson's notebook bearing the words, "I accede
because I have no choice," was badly written in block letters and
paper torn apparently off the end of a half-sheet of so ordinary a
type that it might have been bought at any stationer's in any town,
and results from it were hardly to be hoped for.</p>

<p>There was also the note signed with the letter M, that Harbord
had found in Saunderson's flat. On reading it their minds had
simultaneously jumped to Lady Medchester, but so far there was
nothing to prove she had written it. It, too, was in non-committal
block letters, on very ordinary notepaper. Had the date suggested
in it for the proposed assignation coincided with the date of the
murder Stoddart might have been justified in taking immediate
action. But it did not; the date mentioned was considerably
previous to that of the crime, and although that did not preclude
the possibility of a second meeting having been, arranged there was
nothing to prove it. Saunderson could quite well have met a dozen
women, without making his actions any concern of the police, and if
Lady Medchester chose to deny authorship of the letter, as she
assuredly would, they had no means so far of proving it against
her.</p>

<p>His strongest asset in the case lay in her denial of having been
out in the gardens that night. Persons with clear consciences don't
need to tell lies. She had every right to go out into her own
grounds at any time of the day or night, and had she admitted the
fact in the first instance and said frankly she had seen nothing,
or, if that were not so, had told what she had seen, she would have
been believed and there would have been no more trouble about
it.</p>

<p>But she had not been frank, and had thereby immediately laid
herself open to suspicion. The fact of Lord Medchester being a
person of some importance in the county did not simplify matters.
Stoddart felt that for his own sake he must tread warily: the
authorities strongly objected to becoming embroiled with persons of
influence.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind; he would have yet another interview
with Lady Medchester, and, without warning, confront her with
Garwood's statement about her movements that night. If she could
prove an alibi so much the better; but she had made no effort to do
so in the first instance, had produced no evidence proving her own
assertion of not having left the house, and a belated explanation
born of second thoughts would have to be peculiarly unassailable to
carry any weight.</p>

<p>Then there was the matter of the beads. He intended to press
that point, to force the truth from her. He could quite understand
her astonishment at seeing the crystal beads hanging round Anne's
neck when she had thought the chain to be broken and in the hands
of the police. That was no more than he had expected.</p>

<p>But if she had imagined she recognized Anne's property in the
broken necklace found near the scene of the crime, and the three
loose beads in the dead man's pocket, why had she shown no surprise
when first confronted with them? It would almost seem it had not
been a surprise to her. The two necklaces were so much alike there
was every reason for her to have been mistaken, but why had she not
said--as she believed--the beads belonged to Anne Courtenay when
asked?</p>

<p>An instinct told the inspector it was not in order to shield her
husband's cousin.</p>

<p>Then there was Miss Delauney's story bringing Lord Gorth and his
sister into it. That, too, was, mere chatter--nothing to go
upon--and her own assertion of being married to Robert Saunderson,
by the registrar in Marylebone had had to be substantiated. Police
inquiries had disclosed the fact that Saunderson had been lying
when he said the marriage ceremony had been a sham. The record of
the marriage was there sure enough; in their own names, and no
question about it. Miss Delauney of the halls was Mrs. Saunderson
without a doubt. All these threads, apparently leading into blind
alleys, had to be followed up, and Garwood's evidence had to be
dealt with first.</p>

<p>So about four hours later Inspector Stoddart walked into the
first floor sitting-room at the "Medchester Arms," where Harbord,
with a cigarette in the corner of his mouth, was writing up a
report.</p>

<p>"Ring up the Hall," he said, flinging down his hat, "while I get
a bit of something to eat. I caught the train by the skin of my
teeth. Find out if Lady Medchester's at home and, if not, when she
will be--but don't say why you want to know. I am going to have a
word with her, and I'd as soon Lord Medchester was out of the
way."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>It was six o'clock when a footman informed Lady Medchester that
Inspector Stoddart would like to speak to her. She was writing
letters at her writing-table, and as the man delivered his message
stared straight in front of her without looking round. When she
spoke, after a perceptible pause, her face was white to the
lips.</p>

<p>"Inspector Stoddart--what does he want?"</p>

<p>"To speak to you, my lady," the man answered stolidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what about?" she asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"He didn't say. He's got the other detective--I think his name's
Harbord, my lady--with him, and says he would like to see you at
once."</p>

<p>"Tell him I can't--" she began; then with a little helpless
gesture, "I--suppose it's no good. Where's his lordship?"</p>

<p>"Gone over to East Molton, I believe, to see Mr. Burford."</p>

<p>She turned and faced the man in the doorway for the first
time.</p>

<p>"Show the inspector into the library and say I will be with him
directly." As the door closed and she was left again alone she
flung the pen angrily on the table and rose. "What is it
<i>now</i>?" she muttered. "Am I never to have any peace? Oh,
Dick!--my dear--" She broke off with a sob.</p>

<p>Moving across the room to the mirror over the mantelpiece she
drew powder and puff from a vanity-bag hanging at her wrist, and
applied it skilfully to eyes and nose. A delicate brush of geranium
to cheeks, white for the moment as chalk, and a finishing touch of
lipstick made her feel herself again, and with lips firmly set and
anything but welcome in her eyes she crossed the wide hall to the
library.</p>

<p>The detectives turned as she entered.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she said abruptly. "I suppose it's more
questions about these--these murders? I have already told you all I
can--and I have nothing further to add."</p>

<p>Stoddart drew a chair a few feet forward.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" he suggested. "A new development has
arisen, and there are one or two questions that must be asked."</p>

<p>Lady Medchester frowned at the implication that the interview
might be a long one, and shook her head.</p>

<p>"I prefer to stand, thank you. Surely there is some limit to
this continual inquisition on the part of the police! Why should an
innocent person be subjected to this sort of thing? It's not my
idea of British justice!"</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes scanned her face with so uncompromising a
look that her own dropped.</p>

<p>"The innocent?" he said coldly. "But innocence has to be
proved--and proved up to the hilt in cases of this sort." He
paused--no one knew better than Inspector Stoddart when to give his
actions a dramatic setting. "Why did you say you had spent the
hours between nine and eleven on the evening of Saunderson's murder
in your bedroom, Lady Medchester?" he asked sternly.</p>

<p>She stared at him angrily.</p>

<p>"Because I did. I can't prove it because, as it happens, I was
seen by no one between those hours. I was in my bedroom, and my
maid--"</p>

<p>Stoddart moved a step forward.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, you were seen--in the garden," he interrupted.
"Wait," as she attempted to speak, "don't make matters worse by
denying it."</p>

<p>"Who saw me--is supposed to have seen me?" she said with a
vehement gesture of denial. "I tell you I was in my room."</p>

<p>"Never mind who saw you; you were seen, that's enough. It's no
good denying it; I have my witness. If you knew no more of this
affair than you first admitted there would have been no need to
resort to subterfuge. Now, Lady Medchester, be frank--it will be
better for you in the long run--and I <i>know</i> you were in the
garden that night."</p>

<p>Bluff is an excellent servant when applied to certain types of
human nature, and it did not fail here. Lady Medchester caught at
the back of a chair to steady herself. In spite of powder and paint
she looked ten years older than when she came into the room.</p>

<p>"Tell me," Stoddart went on, pressing his opportunity, "was it
you who met Saunderson in the summer-house that night?"</p>

<p>The shock of the sudden question broke down her last
defence.</p>

<p>"It was not!" she cried emphatically. "I never went into the
summer-house at all--at least, not until--not--" dropping
helplessly into a chair.</p>

<p>"Oh--damn you!" she cried, losing all control, reverting to type
as, in a crisis, is the manner of her kind. "I did not kill
Saunderson, if that's what you think--and I don't know who did!"
she finished violently.</p>

<p>"Better make a clean breast of it, Lady Medchester," Stoddart
said evenly; experience had taught him when to turn the screw and
when to ease the strain. "Nothing that does not bear on the case
shall go any further."</p>

<p>She stifled a sob with a handkerchief rolled into a small,
compact ball, and for a moment silence reigned in the long room
from whose walls the painted eyes of her husband's forbears looked
down upon this unworthy bearer of the name. Her shoulders shook
with the effort to smother her sobs and bring herself to the point
of confession.</p>

<p>"Send him away," she said at last, nodding her head in Harbord's
direction.</p>

<p>At a signal from the inspector his subordinate went out, closing
the door softly behind him. The sight of a soul bared to the world
cannot fail to have its effect on the least thinking man or
woman.</p>

<p>Stoddart waited in vain for Lady Medchester to speak.</p>

<p>"Why did you go out in the garden that night?" he asked
gently.</p>

<p>With a deep sigh she looked up, the rouge on her cheeks riddled
with tears.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you all I know," she said slowly. "You won't
understand--no man ever would understand--and it doesn't matter,"
she added desperately. "I did go out that evening, but it was not
in order to meet Robert Saunderson."</p>

<p>"Why did you go?"</p>

<p>She sat up and pulled herself together.</p>

<p>"I went into the garden that night to spy on Anne Courtenay--as
she was then. I never liked her, perhaps because I knew she did not
like me. There was a peculiar touch of careless arrogance towards
me in her manner that got through the skin somehow--and I'm not
thin-skinned as a rule. It may have been unintentional--I don't
know. Anyway, I hated her; and I suspected that when she pleaded
headache and went to her room she was up to some game or other. So
I slipped out into the gardens and hid among the trees near the
summer-house."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. With a recollection of the rumours
concerning her and Saunderson he could read between the lines.
Jealousy was writ large all over the page.</p>

<p>"You were seen," he said shortly. "I can describe the exact spot
where you stood, if you wish."</p>

<p>Lady Medchester shook her head.</p>

<p>"No need to do that. I am telling the truth--anyhow, this
time.</p>

<p>"I had only waited a few minutes," she went on, "when sure
enough Anne Courtenay's figure flitted from the shadow of the house
into the moonlight and I held my breath. There was no doubt about
it, she expected some one to meet her."</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because instead of walking calmly into the open she darted from
one patch of shadow to another, glancing each side of her in a
nervous sort of way quite unlike her. As she came near to where I
was standing in the deep shadow her face looked pale and drawn,
even in the moonlight, and I saw she was making for the
summer-house just beyond the rose garden. At the foot of the steps
she hesitated and looked round her again. The moon went behind a
cloud, but I could still see her. She mounted slowly and pushed
open the summer-house door."</p>

<p>Stoddart listened with breathless attention. Was this going to
be the solution of the problem that had worried him by day and
interfered with his sleep at night? Somehow, he did not feel all
the exultation he would have expected. Anne Courtenay!</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"I stood still of course," was the sharp answer. "I wanted to
find out whom she expected to meet in the summer-house. She came
out again almost immediately and half ran, half tottered down the
steps; I thought she was going to fall. She caught at the gate into
the rosery to steady herself, and the moon came out again full and
I saw her face--horror-stricken, her eyes staring in front of her.
Then she ran, flinging caution to the winds, as though all the
devils in hell were after her, and disappeared into the house. And
that's all I saw."</p>

<p>She ceased abruptly, but the representative of justice had not
yet done with her.</p>

<p>"What did you do then, Lady Medchester?" he asked, keeping his
eyes steadily fixed upon her face.</p>

<p>The victim of this rigid interrogation wiped her lips with the
handkerchief folded and unfolded by her nervous fingers as she
talked, and looked round as though hoping for a means of escape.
There was none; she knew that well enough. The law had its clutch
on her; she was frightened and tired--too tired to care much what
happened to her. There was only one thing--if that could be kept
from this tormenting devil he should have the rest.</p>

<p>"I waited a moment to make sure she was not coming back," Lady
Medchester resumed, "then I went across the rosery and up the few
steps to the summer-house. I <i>had</i> to see what Anne Courtenay
had seen that had blanched her cheeks and put that look of terror
into her eyes. I pushed open the door--" She broke off with a
shiver, and for the first time looked Inspector Stoddart straight
in the face. "You must believe what I say, for I swear I am telling
the truth," she protested.</p>

<p>"What did you find in the summer-house?" he asked, unmoved.</p>

<p>"Robert Saunderson's dead body was lying on the floor," she went
on in a hard voice, her manner changing, "and at the sight of it I
knew Anne Courtenay was meeting him secretly. It was a shock." Her
eyes dropped. "Robert Saunderson and I have been friends--friends,"
she repeated with emphasis, "for some time, and I had had no idea
of it."</p>

<p>"Yet you followed her into the garden?"</p>

<p>"I guessed she was going to meet some one, and I wished to know
who it was," was the evasive reply. She covered her eyes as though
to screen them from the penetrating gaze of the man opposite her.
"I had always hated her, but I think at that moment I could have
killed her. I dare say you don't understand--it was the
deception--" She broke off.</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly," the inspector interposed. Being man as
well as policeman he felt rather embarrassed. It was so easy to
read between the lines.</p>

<p>Her hand dropped from her eyes and she continued:</p>

<p>"Self-preservation, I suppose, is the most powerful instinct we
have, and even at that moment I knew I mustn't be found alone with
Saunderson's dead body at that hour. I looked round hurriedly to
see if any weapon could be seen, and my eye was caught by something
on the floor between the body and the top of the steps. It was a
necklace of crystal beads, shining in the moonlight--broken, as
though the wearer might have stooped forward and caught it on the
door-handle. I slipped it into my pocket and crept back across the
gardens and into the house."</p>

<p>She sank back in the chair as though the narrative had come to
an end; but the inspector's questions were not finished.</p>

<p>"Did you hear any shot fired during the interval between the
entry of Mrs. Bur ford into the summer-house and her exit?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester shook her head. "I am sure no shot was fired, or
I should certainly have heard it."</p>

<p>"Are these the beads you found, Lady Medchester?" he asked,
producing the broken string from his pocket and holding them up to
view.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then how was it they were found near the scene of the
crime--three of them in the pocket of the dead man?"</p>

<p>A curious look of cunning satisfaction came into her eyes. She
gave a harsh little laugh.</p>

<p>"Because in the morning when I examined the beads I thought they
were Anne's, and that I had been a fool not to leave them where I
found them. Suspicion would have fastened on her quite naturally,
and I should have had my--" She pulled herself up abruptly.</p>

<p>Stoddart smiled; there was no need to supply the word.</p>

<p>"But," she went on, eyeing him defiantly, "I didn't see why I
shouldn't remedy the evil; there would be no harm in assisting the
ends of justice instead of hindering. I determined to put them
back."</p>

<p>She wiped her mouth again nervously. Her interrogator waited in
silence.</p>

<p>"Of course I know it was wrong of me to have done it for the
reason I did, and I'm not sure I am not sorry. But you have no
cause to complain, as my intention was to help the law; and as the
beads have turned out not to be Anne's there's no harm done.
Anyway, I went out as soon as I could leave the house without being
noticed, and from my old hiding-place in the trees saw the police
were already at work in the summer-house. They came out on to the
steps, talking; Wilton, the gardener, was with them and he pointed
in the direction of the old barn. Then the three of them walked off
and I got my chance."</p>

<p>She paused, and Stoddart noticed tiny beads of perspiration were
standing out on her forehead.</p>

<p>"I tore off three of the beads, ran across the rosery and into
the summer-house, slipped them hurriedly into Saunderson's pocket
and, throwing the remainder of the necklace into the shrubbery, got
back to the house without meeting anyone."</p>

<p>She sank back into the chair again and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Inspector Stoddart looked down at her with an inscrutable
expression in his eyes. What will a jealous woman not risk for
revenge?</p>

<p>"And as those beads do not belong to Mrs. Burford, whom do you
suppose they do belong to?" He shot the question at her
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea," Lady Medchester replied
listlessly.</p>

<p>And this time the inspector believed she was speaking the
truth.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER 21</h2>

<p>Inspector Stoddart left Holford Hall considerably worried.</p>

<p>It looked uncommonly as though Miss Tottie Delauney's story
might be true, and that Mrs. Burford had played the star part in
this sordid drama. If so, his suspicions that Saunderson and
Superintendent Mayer had been murdered by the same hand would have
to go. Mrs. Burford might possibly have shot the former, but for
the hour during which Mayer had been killed she had an unassailable
alibi.</p>

<p>He promised Harbord, who had been waiting for him in the hall,
to tell him the main points of the interview later on. He wanted to
think, and when he had that object in view had found nothing so
efficacious as solitude and a cigarette in the fresh air.</p>

<p>It was a lovely autumn day--one of those days on which it seems
good to be alive. He turned his back on the Hall with its old grey
walls shining as placidly in the last rays of the setting sun as
though no such tragedies as crime and sudden death had been enacted
under their shadow; walked through the rosery with the fateful
summer-house on his right; glanced as he passed at the shrubbery
and woods on the left where Lady Medchester had hidden herself on
that evening of tragedy; and passed on towards the boundary of the
copse.</p>

<p>What a woman! Experienced as he was in sordid crime and the
seamy side of life, he felt as though he needed cleansing after
such a contact. A woman without excuses for her mean jealousies,
and her indulgence of instincts not far removed from the brute
beast.</p>

<p>He walked slowly along the narrow path, worn by the passing of
innumerable feet through scrub and undergrowth, under the shadow of
beech and oak to a side gate leading to the high road. He was
becoming very familiar with the geography of the place, and had
purposely avoided the lodge with the possibility of being
intercepted by Mrs. Yates or her daughter and forced to talk when
he wanted to think. He had the power, so necessary in his
profession, of thinking in watertight compartments, of switching
off from one aspect of a subject before switching on to another: an
invaluable asset and one that many a time had stood him in good
stead.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester's confession--for it amounted to no less--had
not greatly advanced the case. The problem of why the beads had
been found in the murdered man's pocket after Mayer had declared
they had not been there when the body was first searched had been
solved, and he made a mental note to emphasize that fact when
retailing the story to Harbord. He rather congratulated himself on
having pulled up the latter for underrating the superintendent's
intelligence on that occasion. But they were no nearer their
ownership. They were certainly not Anne Burford's; no one would be
likely to possess two strings of beads so nearly identical. The
weapon still remained a problem. Both murders had been committed by
means of a shot, and in neither case was there any trace of the
revolver. The bullet that had killed Saunderson had been found
lodged in the wooden boards of the back wall of the summer-house.
In Mayer's case the bullet had not been found at all; it had quite
likely embedded itself in the soft ground among the roots of the
undergrowth and never would be found.</p>

<p>But Anne Burford? Was it possible?</p>

<p>He would have been prepared to go bail almost on her
straightforwardness. She had given her evidence so unhesitatingly,
so simply, with such an air of complete innocence, admitting her
presence in the garden that night, but disclaiming all knowledge of
any unusual occurrence having taken place. He would have been
inclined to doubt Lady Medchester's story--she was capable of any
malicious invention that would clear herself and inculpate the girl
she hated--if it had not been that Miss Tottie Delauney's evidence
pointed in the same direction. Although founded on statement only
and not carrying much weight in itself, each story backed the other
up.</p>

<p>Why had Anne not admitted her visit to the summer-house? A girl
might be shy of an assignation of the sort being discovered,
particularly as she was already engaged to Michael Burford, but she
might have explained the episode away very plausibly; could have
said she drifted in by accident while wandering about the gardens.
Women were ingenious at that sort of thing, and from all accounts
no one would ever have suspected her of a deliberate arrangement to
meet Saunderson secretly.</p>

<p>But she had denied the whole affair, and if she could lie once
she could go on lying, unless--Stoddart's mind was suddenly
side-tracked along another line--she was shielding some one?</p>

<p>He reached the wicket-gate leading to the high road, and leaning
his arms on the top rail stared in front of him. If Anne Burford
were shielding some one, it brought Lord Gorth into it good and
plenty. That was what Miss Tottie Delauney had said--that Anne
Courtenay had killed Saunderson to save her brother, and
herself.</p>

<p>Save him from what? Nothing incriminating Harold Courtenay had
been found among Saunderson's papers, and he seemed harmless
enough, taking him all round; not much brains perhaps--people said
he was making a foolish marriage.</p>

<p>Stoddart smiled grimly. All marriages came into that category in
his opinion; he intended to remain a bachelor. If, as they said, a
woman was at the bottom of all trouble, it was asking for it to
marry one of them. But Lord Gorth's dossier would have to be looked
into more particularly; and Mrs. Burford's, too, for that matter.
She had brought it on herself by her want of frankness.</p>

<p>Lord Gorth lived somewhere in the neighbourhood, not far away.
The inspector had never been there, but he had heard it talked
about. He decided to ring him up from the Medchester police
station. His alibi had never been satisfactory; no alibi at all
really. He had been seen that night by one or two of the guests at
various times during the evening; that was all it amounted to.
There were intervals nobody could swear to, times when he could
have slipped away to the summer-house and back again and no one
have been the wiser.</p>

<p>The little perpendicular lines between Stoddart's keen grey eyes
deepened as his thoughts travelled away from the scene of that
first tragedy and strayed to the spot where the superintendent had
been murdered. That the two crimes were closely related was
certain. He still clung to the theory that both had been committed
by the same hand, but if that were the case then Anne Burford and
her brother were both innocent. They were far enough away when
Superintendent Mayer was killed to be entirely clear of
suspicion.</p>

<p>Inspector Stoddart pulled himself up. After many injunctions to
juniors not to start a theory and then make the facts fit it, here
he was doing it himself! There was nothing to prove the criminal in
the one case to have been the criminal in the other. Circumstances
pointed that way, and that was all that could be said.</p>

<p>He felt justified in the conjecture that the criminal who fired
the shot that killed Mayer had heard him state that he knew who had
killed Saunderson. There were three persons of whom that could be
said--Mrs. Yates; the self-styled Tottie Delauney, her daughter;
and Lord Medchester.</p>

<p>But it was possible Mayer had mentioned it to some one else. He
had been in a self-congratulatory mood, finding it difficult to
keep this precious discovery to himself, as was evidenced by his
confidences to Mrs. Yates and Lord Medchester. He had very nearly
blurted out the whole secret to the latter, only restrained by the
discipline of his training in the Force.</p>

<p>Had he met anyone on his way to catch the Empton bus? Some one
who had given him a clue to the murderer--and who had then,
perhaps, regretted it and lain in wait for him on his way back?</p>

<p>These questions raced through Stoddart's brain as he stood
leaning on the wooden gate, his eyes gazing across the road at the
hedge opposite without consciously seeing it. It was growing dark;
a few stray rooks were cawing overhead, and a dove in the recesses
of the wood was coo-cooing with gentle persistence. The tall trees
beyond the hedge threw the road into shadow.</p>

<p>Stoddart was susceptible to the beauties of nature, and for the
moment the man in him outweighed the detective. He could have
consigned all criminals to the bottom of the sea. He would like to
settle on a farm and till the soil, be done with this everlasting
suspicion of his fellow-men that led him into the foul places of
the earth, and feel no longer in a perpetual state of warfare.</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette absently and threw the match away; it lay
flickering, poised on the long grass bordering the road, as he
opened the gate and passed through.</p>

<p>Glancing down, he put his foot on it, but not before something
that glittered from among the long, green blades reflected the
flame and caught his eye. Instinctively he stooped to pick it up,
and laid it on the palm of his hand, shining in the dying
light.</p>

<p>It was a crystal bead.</p>

<p>On the instant the detective was again uppermost. He stared at
it, surprised. He could: have sworn it was a bead from the broken
string that lay among the police exhibits--the string thrown by
Lady Medchester into the shrubbery, three of which she had slipped
into Saunderson's pocket. What did this mean? Surely she had not
strayed so far afield that night--what would have been her object?
Or had this single bead been dropped here by its rightful
owner?</p>

<p>Stoddart pushed it impatiently into his pocket. Every new detail
that cropped up and might be expected to throw light on the case
only seemed to add to its perplexities. He turned to the right,
heading for Medchester, then thought better of it and, re-entering
the wood through the gate, retraced his steps until he came to a
point where the footpath forked. Leaving the track he had come by
on his left, he took the other, and skirting the spot where Mayer
had been shot came out on the drive close to the lodge gates.</p>

<p>It had struck him it might be as well to find out whether Miss
Tottie Delauney had ever owned a string of crystal beads.</p>

<p>In spite of an autumnal nip in the air the window of the front
room was open, and, as the detective crossed the plot of grass with
the path running up the centre to the front door, voices raised in
discussion reached his ears. Mrs. Yates and her daughter were
apparently in slight disagreement over something.</p>

<p>"If you can't what the lawyers call substantiate your
statements, my advice to you, Mary Ann, is to hold yer tongue," was
the injunction that drifted through the window to the inspector's
ears. "I don't hold with putting things into a policeman's head.
Let them find it out for themselves--that's what I say. I was
saying to Mary Mayer when I went to see her in Medchester. 'Mary,'
I said, 'it's no manner of use trying to keep anything from the
police,' I said; 'you mark my words, they'll find it out sooner or
later without your help,' I said, 'and least said soonest mended,'
and that's what I say to you--"</p>

<p>"How you do go on, mother!" her daughter's voice broke in.
"First you tell me to keep nothing from the police--then you tell
me I talk too much. I've got nothing to hide; I told them all I
could. If they don't believe me I can't help it. I say Anne
Courtenay did my husband in, and I don't care--"</p>

<p>The window was closed suddenly from inside as the inspector
knocked at the front door. Mrs. Yates opened it.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you," she remarked without enthusiasm. "Come in,
sir--the inspector from Scotland Yard, isn't it?" She showed him
into the front parlour, where Miss Tottie Delauney was lying full
length on a cretonne-covered sofa, looking at a picture paper. She
sat up at sight of the visitor and nodded.</p>

<p>"I and Inspector Stoddart are old friends," she said
graciously.</p>

<p>It was always worth while to cultivate friendship with the
mammon of unrighteousness, she had learnt that in her precarious
profession; you never knew when a friend in high places mightn't
come in useful, and just now she was particularly anxious to
placate the authorities.</p>

<p>"Like a cup of tea, inspector?" she invited. "I'll boil a drop
of water in no time, and I dare say you've walked a good step one
way and another."</p>

<p>"I don't mind if I do, Miss Delauney," was the ready answer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates pushed a chair towards him.</p>

<p>"No news yet about who killed poor Bill Mayer?" she asked as her
daughter, ready to bestir herself when it came to her own
interests, disappeared into the kitchen.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Nothing to tell the world about; but we're
getting on. What a lot of trouble and anxiety we should have been
saved if Superintendent Mayer had told you what he knew, Mrs.
Yates."</p>

<p>"It wasn't my fault he didn't," Mrs. Yates replied
reminiscently, "but he kept his mouth shut as tight as any
oyster."</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Mayer can't help us," Stoddart observed tentatively,
thinking of the words he had heard through the open window, "not to
go by the evidence she gave at the inquest. Never said anything to
you, Mrs. Yates, that might lead you to think she knows more than
she let on?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates, with a memory of certain inscrutable words let drop
by her friend at their last meeting, flushed scarlet and turned her
face away.</p>

<p>"Never," she replied loyally. "I don't believe Mary Mayer knows
anything more than you or I do. She'd have told it quick enough if
it would help to find out who'd murdered her husband."</p>

<p>The rattle of tray and cup and saucer preceded Miss Delauney's
reappearance; she had taken advantage of her temporary retirement
to remedy the day's wear and tear with powder and lipstick, and it
was the Tottie Delauney familiar to the music-hall world that
smiled at him over the homely tea-tray. But she kept a wary eye on
him as she poured out the cup of tea and supplied him with milk and
sugar.</p>

<p>"I was in hopes you'd got news for us," she said brightly. "You
thought Bob Saunderson was speaking truth when he said our marriage
was a sham, but I bet you know better by now. I'm an honest woman,
I am--and I mean to have my rights."</p>

<p>"Certainly you'll have your rights. Every one in this case will
get their rights in the end, no doubt. What we have to find out
is--what are their rights?"</p>

<p>"Well, I know what mine are, anyway," Miss Delauney replied with
a toss of her henna-dyed head. "I shall be entitled to the half of
all poor Bob left as his wife, as there aren't any children to
provide for, and there are those who'll see I get it."</p>

<p>"Did you know he had made no Will?" The inspector shot the
question at her.</p>

<p>Miss Delauney dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," she replied after a perceptible pause. "I knew
he hadn't made a Will up to the time we parted company, but how was
I to know what he'd done since? I knew nothing about his affairs.
When I heard of the murder I came here to--to look round as it
were. Why shouldn't I? A wife couldn't do no less in my opinion."
In moments of excitement Miss Delauney was apt to revert to the
diction natural to her. "If you've come here to be asking questions
again I'm sorry I gave you a cup of tea, that I am!" she cried,
chin in air, hand on hip, a pose he felt sure had met with much
applause on many a music-hall stage.</p>

<p>"Bob Saunderson mayn't have been a pattern husband," she went on
before either of the others could speak, "but he wasn't a bad sort
take him all round, and I'll thank you police to find out who did
him in!"</p>

<p>"Now, now, go easy, Mirandy," her mother murmured uneasily.</p>

<p>Stoddart smiled. "We shall have to find out who had a motive for
doing so," he said smoothly, and Miss Delauney subsided on the edge
of a chair, a scared look creeping into her eyes. "But I didn't
come here to talk about the murder"--he put a hand in his
pocket--"as a matter of fact, I looked in to see if either of you
ladies ever had a string of beads like this?"</p>

<p>He placed the crystal bead on the table, "Where did you find
it?" Mrs. Yates asked after a pause during which both she and her
daughter glanced at it furtively as though suspecting a trap.</p>

<p>"At the edge of the wood."</p>

<p>"Not mine," Mrs. Yates said curtly. "I don't hold with those
sort of gewgaws. Waste of money, I call them."</p>

<p>"I am sure," the inspector suggested persuasively, "Miss Tottie
Delauney's admirers don't share that opinion, Mrs. Yates," and he
looked expectantly at her daughter.</p>

<p>"Mirandy likes a bit of colour," Mrs. Yates put in hastily. "She
had some beads like that only they was red as rubies and--"</p>

<p>"I'm not answering any more questions, mother," the other said
sullenly, "and I'll thank you to keep your mouth shut too."</p>

<p>"Well, somebody's missing it," the detective remarked, replacing
the bead in his pocket.</p>

<p>Having got as much--or as little--information from the two women
as he had hoped for, he walked off towards Medchester, not much the
wiser for his pains.</p>

<p>He was greeted at the hotel door by Harbord.</p>

<p>"There's a man asking for you," he informed him; "wouldn't talk
to me--said he wanted the top boss of this here murder case. He's
to call again first thing tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man?"</p>

<p>"Tramp, if you ask me. Three days' growth on his chin, and looks
as though he wouldn't recognize a piece of soap if he saw it."</p>

<p>"Umph," the inspector muttered, and added under his breath,
"What I want to meet is somebody who'll tell me whom those beads
belong to."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER 22</h2>

<p>Inspector Stoddart's visit left an atmosphere of uneasiness at
the lodge.</p>

<p>Miss Delauney's antagonism to His Majesty's police force,
developed during a career that had more than once been within
bowing acquaintance with the Law Courts, was instinctive and
ineradicable. She distrusted policemen, from the man on point duty
to the Chief of the C.I.D. In her opinion they were a prying,
meddling crowd, making a still more difficult problem of life,
which Providence, or some other potent authority, had already made
sufficiently complicated.</p>

<p>It might have afforded her a modicum of consolation had she
known that she had puzzled the inspector. It was true she had not
claimed ownership of the vagrant bead, but neither had she denied
it. His knowledge of the subject had remained exactly where it was.
On comparison it was found to match the police "exhibit" in every
particular, and was without doubt a part of the necklace thrown by
Lady Medchester into the shrubbery under the erroneous impression
that it belonged to Anne Courtenay. When he laid it on the table in
full view Miss Delauney had not flickered so much as an eyelash--he
had watched her carefully. It appeared to convey nothing to her at
all; nor to her mother, who was presumably less experienced in
histronic display.</p>

<p>However, it was not through the question direct he hoped to get
the coveted information; although the clue of the bead necklace had
been kept from public knowledge, guilt would be on its guard, and
it would be by some side-track that the owner would be
detected.</p>

<p>From small beginnings great results may arise.</p>

<p>Is there a more trite observation than that in the English
language? But like other similar axioms it is none the less true,
and if Inspector Stoddart could have foreseen what was to result
from the fact that Harbord spent the following night wide awake,
owing to an aching tooth, he would have received that information
with more interest when it was offered to him in the morning by the
sufferer.</p>

<p>As it was, although not wanting in sympathy, after suggesting an
early visit to a dentist in Medchester, he considered the situation
adequately dealt with and proceeded to other business, including
the promised visit from the tramp overnight. When by eleven o'clock
the man had failed to appear, the inspector, deciding with
indifference he had changed his mind, settled down to deal with
certain reports, and saw his colleague depart in search of relief
from one of the most cruel torments to which human flesh is
heir.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In the meantime trouble had been going on at the Hall.</p>

<p>Lord Medchester had put his foot down. In spite of persuasion
amounting almost to tears on the part of his wife he absolutely
refused to have a wedding-party at Holford. If Mr. Maurice Stainer
was not in a position to give his sister a suitable send-off, then
let Harold himself do it from Gorth, of which he was now sole
master.</p>

<p>"But," Lady Medchester remonstrated, "it's unheard of for the
bride to be married from the bridegroom's house!"</p>

<p>"It will also be unheard of that she is married from
mine--because she won't be," his lordship replied grimly, and
chuckled at his own retort. "'Pon my soul--not so bad--what?" he
laughed again. "But I mean it, Min," he added, sobering down. "I
won't have Miss Sybil Stainer playing the star part in any show
under my roof. And that's that!"</p>

<p>He left the room, followed by Lady Medchester's despairing eyes,
until the door, sharply banged, hid him from view. She sat for a
moment as though turned to stone.</p>

<p>The door reopened to admit the new Lord Gorth. He was scarcely
recognizable as the former Harold Courtenay. In appearance ten
years older, his face was white and drawn, his eyes dull, the
sparkle of youth in them faded. Little lines showed at the corners
of his eyes and his hands moved restlessly. He walked listlessly
across the room and dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>"Dick says he won't have the wedding here, Harold," Lady
Medchester said, looking at him anxiously, "and I'm afraid it's
final. Do you think you could persuade Sybil to be married quietly,
here at the village church, or even at a London Register Office?
And I suppose I may go as far as to promise a wedding cake and a
glass of champagne here after it. Surely as long as she is married
she needn't care how the ceremony is performed?" Her voice was
bitter, but Harold did not seem to notice it. "I suppose Anne
wouldn't let the marriage--" she began tentatively, but broke off
as Harold's eyes suddenly lost their apathy and flamed into
indignation.</p>

<p>"I won't have Anne asked. My God! hasn't she done enough?" he
began furiously; then pulling himself together at the surprise in
Lady Medchester's face, "Anne has suffered more than you
think--dragged into all this muck. I dare say she would have the
wedding from her house if I asked her; but I am not going to ask
her." He went on more quietly, "I'll speak to Sybil. If she
understands that Cousin Dick definitely refuses I dare say she'll
be reasonable."</p>

<p>Lady Medchester looked as though she hardly agreed with him.</p>

<p>"Life plays funny tricks sometimes," he went on after a pause.
"I suppose it's one's own fault."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be saying that, with the world at your
feet--money, title, marriage--what more do you want?" She smiled
ironically. "A veritable fairy dream, the world would say."</p>

<p>"A damnable nightmare!" he retorted.</p>

<p>"Then why are you doing it?" she asked curiously.</p>

<p>He looked at her uneasily and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Why are you trying to persuade Cousin Dick to have the wedding
from here?" he asked abruptly. "You don't want it. You don't like
Sybil."</p>

<p>The colour faded from his cousin's face.</p>

<p>"We have to do things we don't want to do sometimes," she
replied evasively. "But you must speak to Sybil and persuade her to
give up the idea of a big show. She shall stay here if she likes
and you can be quietly married at Holford Church, and go straight
away for the honeymoon after we've drunk your health. Dick can't
object to that."</p>

<p>Harold nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>"Her marriage will then have the seal of our approval," she went
on, "which, after all, is what she wants--and her brother can give
her away."</p>

<p>He moved towards the door. "Needs must when the devil drives, I
suppose. I only hope I may get Sybil to see it. If she'll be
reasonable I'll marry her in three weeks if she likes, instead of
sticking out for the two months I bargained for." And he flung out
of the room before his cousin had time to remark on the
un-bridegroom-like remark.</p>

<p>For some time there had been a tacit understanding between these
two; although not comprehending the other's secret, the mutual
knowledge that neither was any longer a free agent had established
a link between them of a sort.</p>

<p>Minnie Medchester smiled rather grimly as she resumed the
letter-writing at which she had been engaged when interrupted by
her husband's ultimatum. Harold's task of persuading his ladylove
into what he had called a reasonable frame of mind was not going to
be a light one. She had had more than one experience of Miss
Stainer's tantrums when things went wrong, and she did not envy him
his mission. It had become a sort of <i>ide fixe</i> with Sybil,
this godmothering of her by the Medchesters. It was odd she should
have sufficient intelligence to realize her prospective neighbours
in the county were not likely to hail her with enthusiasm as a
suitable wife for Lord Gorth, and yet should fail to understand
that the seal of Holford Hall's approval would never be sufficient
to outweigh her own shortcomings. The county would probably have
none of her in any case, though all the Medchesters in the world
were to take her by the hand.</p>

<p>But this was hardly a line of argument possible for the man who
was going to marry her to adopt, and Harold quailed, as many a
better man has quailed, at the prospect of tackling an angry
woman.</p>

<p>His fears proved to have been unnecessary. Either a fragment of
common sense had penetrated the thick skin of her self-esteem or
the desire for publicity on her wedding day had evaporated.</p>

<p>"I'm sick of Minnie's waverings this way and that--one day
assuring me she has that husband of hers on the end of a string,
and the next that he has put his foot down and isn't taking it up
again. What does it matter, anyway? Once I'm Lady Gorth it's me
who'll be calling the tune"--grammar was not Sybil Stainer's long
suit--"and they'll be ready enough to dance when I tell them. And
I'll make 'em dance too!" she added viciously, while the man
listening to her shivered inwardly at the crude vulgarity of her
outlook.</p>

<p>Through his own manoeuvring they were standing on the lawn in
full view of the house; no lover-like demonstrations could be
expected of him out in the open.</p>

<p>"We'll be married just as soon as you can get a licence," she
went on.</p>

<p>To strike while the iron was hot had always been her idea when
dealing with her own interests, and this suggestion of Harold's had
its advantages. Less chance of slip 'twixt cup and lip, perhaps,
and a speedy marriage would bring Anne to her bearings. No use to
kick against the pricks then.</p>

<p>"We'll be married at the church here, as Minnie says, and go
away from the Hall afterwards. No Register Office for me--church is
better style, and if you get a special licence no banns need be
called. So get a move on, Harold. I'll go up to town for a few
days--must see the last of old Maurice and get a bit of shopping
done.</p>

<p>"Buck up!" she added. "Not much of the impatient bridegroom
about you, I must say!"</p>

<p>"Played out nowadays, that sort of thing," he answered
apathetically. "I think you're wise to take Lady Medchester's
offer--"</p>

<p>She glanced at him sharply. "No need to swallow the poker," she
put in. "'Lady Medchester,' indeed! She'll be my cousin as well as
yours when we're married!"</p>

<p>"It will save trouble in the long run--a quiet wedding," he went
on as though she had not spoken, "and come to the same thing in the
end."</p>

<p>"Now look here, Harold," Miss Stainer admonished, "understand I
am not going to take any nonsense from you lying down. I know what
I know--and there's others'll know it too if you don't behave
yourself. Once I'm your wife it'll be different--"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know all that," he interrupted wearily. "What more do you
want? We'll be married whenever you like, I tell you. You had
better go and tell--Minnie"--he brought the name out with a
gulp--"you accept her offer. She'll bet glad to have it
settled--one way or the other--and I'll see about the licence."</p>

<p>He strode off, glad to have got it over without a "scene." Sybil
Stainer rather enjoyed scenes; she said it cleared the air and gave
an opportunity for getting in a home-truth or two.</p>

<p>She also knew when she was beaten, and it had been dawning upon
her for some days that, although for certain reasons she could put
the screw on Lady Medchester when she liked, it was a different
matter when dealing with Lord Medchester, and she had no idea of
losing the bird in her hand because she could glimpse a bigger one
in the bush; that is to say, she would never allow the
unsubstantial glories of a large and fashionable wedding to
endanger seriously the wedding itself.</p>

<p>Before Harold broached the subject to her she had already
decided that, as Medchester was making such an unholy fuss about
it, it would be politic to give way with regard to the manner of it
and get on with the business itself. Life, in her experience, was
so essentially a matter of ups and downs, it was foolish to tempt
Fate by asking too much.</p>

<p>As Harold drove off after his interview with Sybil Stainer, he
passed Harbord walking into Medchester in search of a dentist. He
recognized him as one of the detectives engaged on the unravelling
of the murders in which they all seemed to have become involved,
and suppressed a first kindly impulse to offer him a lift. The man
might make use of the opportunity to ask questions--questions
Harold did not want to answer. So far as that unpleasant bill with
Robert Saunderson's signature on it was concerned, that had been
settled; it had been easy enough to raise the money when he had
come into the Gorth properties and, with the principal witness
dead, there was no one to bring up awkward questions about the
signature. The name had been forged very cleverly, and Messrs.
Usher &amp; Snell, the money-lenders in whose office it had been
left, had apparently never suspected its genuineness. Saunderson
would never have let on about the forgery. He would want to keep
all the cards in his own hand till the right time came.
Circumstances, accidental or otherwise, had certainly played into
Harold's hands as far as that was concerned.</p>

<p>So he professed not to see Harbord, who, he hoped, had possibly
not seen him, little thinking that each step taken by Scotland
Yard's emissary was a step nearer the solution of the problem that
was causing them all so much distress.</p>

<p>Who is to say how far we can exercise free will, and how far we
are the puppets of an arbitrary fate? What impulse is it that makes
us choose this road or that: one perhaps leading to goals big with
opportunity; the other dwindling into an arid, barren
<i>cul-de-sac</i>, pitted with futile footsteps that never get any
further? They may both have looked fair enough at the start. What
influence lies behind the final decision?</p>

<p>There were three dentists, it appeared, in Medchester. Harbord
learnt so much from a local directory and, knowing nothing about
any of them, chose one at random. He did not suppose there was much
the matter, and the least efficient member of the dentist's craft
should be able to give him something to stay the pain till he could
get back to London.</p>

<p>He missed the first because he disliked the name--Le Mouette. He
distrusted flowery names, and it sounded foreign. So he chose the
second, bearing the simple and familiar name of Howard, and a few
minutes later was knocking at his door.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard was in but engaged; if the gentleman had no
engagement he might have to wait a little. Would he take a seat in
the waiting-room, and the maid assured him she would let Mr. Howard
know the case was urgent.</p>

<p>Harbord found himself sharing the cheerful little waiting-room
with two other unfortunates who presumably would be attended to
before his turn came. If he had not been reluctant to face another
sleepless night he might have been tempted to return to Holford
forthwith; but having got so far it seemed foolish to give way to
impatience.</p>

<p>A natural instinct, further developed by training, to observe
what was going on round him caused him to take stock of his
fellow-victims. Not much of interest to be gained there! A young
woman, nursing a swelled face, and keeping a pair of scared eyes
fixed on the door, as a lost soul might wait a summons to the
Inferno; and an elderly man deeply immersed in the pages of a
financial paper probably some days old.</p>

<p>Harbord turned to the table upon which papers old and new and a
magazine or two lay scattered in untidy profusion. He drew up a
chair and selected one at random, and had absently turned over a
few leaves before discovering it was a railway guide to the best
hotels in the North of England. He dropped it and picked up
another. The door opened, the young woman rose and followed the
beckoning finger into the Unknown--so Harbord imagined it to be
from the expression on her face.</p>

<p>One step nearer to his own turn.</p>

<p>The paper he had chanced on was the "Bysphere," and hardly
knowing what he was doing he turned the pages idly, stared at
portraits with names under them, of men in tweeds carrying golf
clubs, ladies notorious in society or stageland, a picture of the
river crowded with boats, Japanese parasols, girls with bare arms
in punts, with "Henley Regatta" beneath. This made him glance up at
the date; the paper was an issue of months ago, but it served as
well as anything else, and at that moment the maid reappeared and,
the elderly gentleman obeying the call, Harbord was left in sole
possession of the waiting-room. Anyhow it would be his turn next
now, so there would not be so much longer to wait.</p>

<p>He continued to turn over the leaves of the ancient weekly, but
his thoughts were elsewhere. He had seen Lord Gorth drive past him
outside Medchester; it had set him wondering again, in spite of the
pain he was suffering, whether that young gentleman and his sister
were really involved, entangled in the knotted threads of this
sinister problem. Things were beginning to look bad for Mrs.
Burford; he, with Stoddart, would have been almost ready to vouch
for her innocence, and yet here she was, telling lies like the rest
of them, and he was sorry--</p>

<p>His thoughts came to an end in an audible exclamation.</p>

<p>He bent over the page before him, every sense suddenly alert and
attentive. He stared at it, turning it this way and that; took it
to the window and scanned it in the better light, holding it close
to his eyes to examine it in detail. Muttered "Good God!" as
visions of a rapid rise in his profession rose before him.</p>

<p>Then returning to the table he flattened out the paper and, with
an anxious glance at the door, which might admit a witness at any
moment, he took out a penknife and rapidly detached the entire page
neatly from the rest; folded it carefully and slipped it into the
breast pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>This done, he wiped his forehead, upon which tiny beads of
perspiration stood out as the result of unusual excitement, and
realized that every trace of the pain in his tooth had disappeared!
He seized his hat, opened the door softly, and tiptoed along the
entrance passage, through the front door, into the street.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Inspector Stoddart, still busy over his
reports, was startled by the sudden and somewhat violent entrance
of his colleague.</p>

<p>"What the devil?" he began, annoyed at the interruption; but at
the sight of the other's face the words died on his lips.</p>

<p>"Sorry, sir," Harbord said, "but I've got news for you!"</p>

<p>The inspector raised his eyebrows. "Well--had the tooth out?" he
asked sardonically.</p>

<p>"Damn the tooth!" the other replied without emotion; then
lowering his voice, "I can tell you who the crystal beads belong
to!" and with a glance behind him to make sure the door was closed,
he drew the page he had cut out of the "Bysphere" from his pocket
and laid it on the table.</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER 23</h2>

<p>Mrs. Yates was setting out the breakfast things for herself and
her daughter on the morning following Harbord's remarkable recovery
in the dentist's waiting-room, and grumbling to herself as she did
it.</p>

<p>Devoted mother as she was, she was growing tired of doing the
work while Miss Tottie Delauney reaped the benefit, lolling in idle
self-indulgence while her mother washed up or swept the floors. At
the moment she was still lying in bed in the room above, while Mrs.
Yates had already been up and about for an hour or two; as she set
teacups and saucers on the kitchen table, neatly covered for the
meal by a red and white checked cloth, she was conscious that even
a mother's devotion might peter out, and had a curious sense of
futility and a wish to sit down and cry her eyes out.</p>

<p>The year was dying slowly. A thin drizzle blurred the outlines
of bush and hedge round the lodge, the big iron gates barring the
way to visitors, ghostly in the grip of the wet mist. The road
shone dark and grey, reflecting as clearly as a river the trees and
posts that bordered it. Every twig dripped moisture, the reds and
yellows of autumn that had glowed so vividly in the sunshine looked
dead and lifeless, and the quacking of a string of ducks waddling
across the road in single file, to discover what treasure the
little rill running under the far hedge might yield, added to the
general melancholy of the dismal day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates, having opened the window when she first came
downstairs to give the place an airing, shut it again with a jerk.
It was letting in more damp than air; she shivered as she put the
kettle on the fire. She was not going to wait any longer for that
lie-abed daughter of hers, nor was she going to pander to her lazy
habits by carrying a cup of tea up to her room. She had done so at
first, but now she was tired of it. There was still a draught from
somewhere, and urged by an ever-present dread, rheumatism, she went
back to the window and made sure it was properly closed.</p>

<p>As she glanced through the small, leaded panes, a figure came
into view on the road outside, looming dimly into sight through the
driving mist: the figure of a man, evidently a gentleman of the
road, walking slowly with steps that lagged, and reflected full
length by the hard, wet ground at his feet. He limped a little; his
shock of flaming red hair, with no hat to shelter it, made a bright
blot of colour against the grey hedge beyond.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates stared through the glass pane, her hand arrested
half-way to the latch of the casement. She had seen that red head
before, and the rather vacant features it surmounted. But
where?</p>

<p>Before the man had reached the centre of her field of vision she
remembered. He had passed along the road--she had seen him from the
gate--on the morning poor Bill Mayer had been shot. She had never
given him a thought since, but the sight of him shuffling along
stirred her memory, and she distinctly remembered seeing him on
that previous occasion. It was before Mayer himself had come along;
he was going towards Medchester while Mayer was coming away from
it, and what with seeing the superintendent and hearing all he had
to say, and then the disturbing news of his death, the tramp had
passed entirely from her mind. Not that it could matter much, but
the sight of him brought back the tragic circumstances of that day
with sudden poignancy.</p>

<p>She was a kind-hearted woman and the slowly moving figure
appealed so eloquently as a bit of human flotsam and jetsam,
drifting past through the murk of the autumn morning, that she
impulsively threw the window open and called to him as he passed.
He was not the sort to be invited into a spotlessly kept kitchen,
especially with the possibility of a sudden descent on the part of
the fastidious lady of the music-halls upstairs, but a cup of hot
tea passed through the window could hurt nobody. He imbibed it
greedily.</p>

<p>"Thank 'ee kindly," he said, returning it, "puts a bit o' life
into you on a morning like this. Las' time I was 'ere--" He looked
round curiously, but the closed gates barred the view into the
drive beyond, and a curtailed vision of grey, dripping branches and
a hedge already shorn of its summer foliage was all that could be
seen.</p>

<p>The man moved nearer to the window and dropped his voice.</p>

<p>"There was a murder near 'ere, wasn't there? A nark 'e was,
wasn't 'e--policeman I mean?" he asked in a hoarse whisper.
"'Appened the very day I was 'ere las'. I seed it in a picture
paper wot somebody had dropped in the road just this side o'
Mapsdale. Well, missis"--he wiped his mouth with the back of his
stumpy fingers--"they do say 'tis an ill wind wot blows nobody no
good, and maybe there's a bit waitin' for services done. Leastways
there's no 'arm in tryin'."</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?" Mrs. Yates asked sharply.</p>

<p>A sudden caution looked out through a pair of cunning little
eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll deliver the goods to the proper party, missis. I ain't
a-givin' nothin' away. Not me! Thank 'ee kindly for the tea." And,
jerking a finger towards a lock of red hair drooping disconsolately
over one eye, he shuffled off to be swallowed up immediately by the
wreathing mists.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Stoddart and his colleague were finishing a late breakfast when
Mrs. Marlow knocked at their sitting-room door later on in the
morning.</p>

<p>"A man to see you, sir, and never in my life did I see a redder
head of hair--carrots and pillarboxes are fools to it, and that's a
fact," she said volubly, her hand round the edge of the door, her
body somewhere in the background. "I said as how you were busy
eating your breakfast, and he said he'd wait--and, if you ask me,
he means it--looks as if he'd wait till the last day and then wait
some," she added thoughtfully, "though I told him--"</p>

<p>"That's all right, Mrs. Marlow," the inspector interrupted.</p>

<p>"The man who called before probably," Harbord muttered.</p>

<p>"Clear away these things and then show him up," Stoddart
finished.</p>

<p>Considerably more bedraggled than when enjoying Mrs. Yates's
hospitality outside the lodge, the red-haired tramp entered the
room and, touching his forelock, stood awkwardly by the door.</p>

<p>"Are you the man who called the day before yesterday?" the
inspector asked curtly.</p>

<p>His visitor nodded assent, finding it difficult perhaps to find
his voice in so august a presence.</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Ted Watson."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come here yesterday?"</p>

<p>The man swallowed twice, and Stoddart continued:</p>

<p>"Never mind; it doesn't matter. What do you want?"</p>

<p>The nearest publican could probably furnish the answer.</p>

<p>The tramp looked nervously from one to the other of the men
before whom he was arraigned, and then apparently plucked up
courage.</p>

<p>"It's this way, mister," he began. "There was a man shot about
here not so long ago, though I don't mind the date"--Stoddart,
suddenly alive to the possibility that the man might know
something, nodded encouragement--"a police constable
seemingly--done in 'e was--name of Mayer--"</p>

<p>"How do you know what his name was?" the inspector snapped.</p>

<p>"Saw it in the papers--it was coz of what I sees in the papers
I'm 'ere now. I knows what I knows"--the cunning in his eyes
increased and he edged nearer to where the two detectives sat by
the table--"and I'll tell what I knows, when I knows what I'll get
for it, see? That's fair."</p>

<p>The inspector looked at him sternly. "You don't make bargains
with the police, my man. What you know you'll tell, or it will be
the worse for you."</p>

<p>The man stared back truculently. "When you 'appen to ha' got
summat another party wants--" he began.</p>

<p>Stoddart tapped authoritatively on the table.</p>

<p>"Lock the door," he said to his assistant.</p>

<p>Harbord rose and made a step forward. The bluff acted like
magic: the red-haired man subsided.</p>

<p>"Now, mister, no offence," he cringed. "I'll tell what I know,
but I may tell 'ee the cop what was called Mayer promised me, 'e
did--"</p>

<p>The two detectives exchanged a rapid glance.</p>

<p>"Tell us what you know," the inspector urged more gently. "You
won't lose by it if it's worth listening to. A jug of beer, Alfred,
from Mrs. Marlow--it's dry work talking."</p>

<p>The visitor appeared to find the prospect of beer encouraging.
He grinned broadly and plunged forthwith into his story.</p>

<p>On the night when so much tragedy had been staged at Holford
Hall--the night of Saunderson's murder, though he hadn't known then
there'd been a murder--it seemed he had been on the road, making
his way to Medchester through the village of Holford. It had been a
warmish day and a bad one--that was to say, he had had no luck on
the road, and was both tired and hungry. But he wanted to get to
Medchester before night, and that evening some time after dark--he
couldn't tell what time exactly--he found himself where the road
was overshadowed by trees, and where a little gate led into what he
now knew to be Holford woods.</p>

<p>As he was about to pass on the figure of a woman appeared
suddenly on the other side of the gate, and he instinctively drew
back into the shadow on the far side of the road. For a moment the
moon shone full on her face and he would know her again anywhere.
She fumbled with the latch, glancing up and down the road
nervously, but never noticing the man cowering in the ditch
opposite. Having got the gate open, she came through, closed it
softly behind her, and went off at a run along the road.</p>

<p>Stoddart here called a halt for refreshment, and when Mrs.
Marlow's ale had been disposed of asked in which direction the
woman had run, and the tramp resumed his story.</p>

<p>The woman had run along the road towards Medchester, which went
past the lodge, and he had crept out of the shadows and followed
her. But she had stopped suddenly, so suddenly that he had only
just time to fling himself flat in the long grass beside the road
or she would have seen him. She stood in the middle of the road,
passing her hand over her neck and shoulders and peering on the
ground as if she'd lost something. She shook her dress and the bag
she had in her hand, and came a step or two back along the
road--stopped again and took a step or two in the direction she had
come.</p>

<p>Then she seemed to make up her mind, turned again and went off
along the road round a comer and out of sight.</p>

<p>"Towards the lodge?" Stoddart asked.</p>

<p>Yes, towards the lodge, or it might be Medchester, or there was
a short cut he had heard tell across the park to Holford
village--he couldn't say where she went. He got on to his feet and
followed, and when he arrived at the spot where she had hesitated
and turned round he saw something white lying on the road close to
where she had been standing.</p>

<p>He picked it up. It was a bit of paper with something written on
it; not being a scholar, and the moon having gone behind a cloud,
he couldn't tell what it was--looked like marriage lines or
something--and he hastened after the woman, thinking he might get a
shilling or two for giving it back to her. But he couldn't catch up
with her, and never saw her again.</p>

<p>"And so you've brought the paper here?" the inspector remarked.
"And time, too, considering weeks have gone by. Why didn't you take
it at once to the police?"</p>

<p>"I ain't brought it with me, coz I ain't got it," the man
replied sulkily, "and if you be kind enough to listen to me,
mister, you'll 'ear as 'ow I did take it to the police."</p>

<p>"Go on," Stoddart said shortly, with a glance at Harbord; were
they going to know at last what it was Mayer had learnt that had
cost him so great a price?</p>

<p>The man threw a suggestive glance at the empty beer jug and
continued.</p>

<p>Not catching up with the woman he had slipped the paper into his
pocket, spent the night under a convenient haystack, and resumed
his tramp in the morning; not very early because he had overslept
himself. He put the paper in his pocket and forgot all about
it.</p>

<p>Having tramped the country for he didn't remember how long, he
found himself back at Holford, heard of the murder of a bloke
called Saunderson, and thought of the slip of paper still lying
forgotten in his pocket. The police might be willing to give him a
bit for it; anyway, it was worth trying.</p>

<p>He had passed the lodge, which he knew pretty well by this time,
by about half a mile when he met a policeman walking along the road
from the direction of Medchester. A bit of a boss he was, with a
cap instead of a helmet and a bit of braid about him. He had never
seen him before, didn't--begging their pardons--see more of the
police than he was obliged to, but had learnt since the officer's
name was Mayer.</p>

<p>Thinking to save himself a visit to the police station, he had
stopped the officer and handed it over to him, with the request
that if it should prove to be of any value he wouldn't be
forgotten. It was just as well, he went on, to stand in with the
police when you didn't do yourself any harm by it, a remark that
had brought a grin to Stoddart's lips.</p>

<p>"What then?" the inspector asked shortly. "Did it seem to be of
any importance?"</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>"He seemed all dithery-like when he'd read it."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said, 'Well, I be damned!' twice over--very slow."</p>

<p>Stoddart moved impatiently. "Was that all he said? Get on,
man!"</p>

<p>"There ain't nothin' more to tell--leastways 'e told me to
report myself at the station at Medchester next mornin' at ten
o'clock and I'd probably 'ear o' something to my advantage."</p>

<p>"And did you do so?"</p>

<p>The tramp drew the back of his hand across his mouth.</p>

<p>"Not me! By evenin' it was all over the place that a man 'ad
been murdered--and a policeman at that--close to the 'Olford lodge,
near where we'd been talkin' in the mornin', so I makes myself
scarce. 'Tweren't no manner o' use gettin' mixed up in a murder
case--and havin' awkward questions asked. So I 'ops it, and let any
reward for the findin' of the paper that might be comin' to me go
'ang."</p>

<p>There was a pause; the pair of cunning little eyes wandered
vaguely round the room to come again to a halt at the beer jug. But
nobody took the hint.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing with yourself since?" Stoddart
asked.</p>

<p>"Trampin' the country--and doin' no 'arm," was the defiant
reply.</p>

<p>"Umph?" the detective looked doubtful. "Why have you come here
now?"</p>

<p>The flamboyantly red head leaned forward confidentially.</p>

<p>"I picked up a noospaper lying in the road as I was trampin'
into Mapsdale and there I reads about the inquest. 'Twas an old
noospaper--days and days. That was last Wednesday. There I sees the
policeman's name was Mayer, and as 'ow 'e'd told the lady at the
lodge 'e'd got a line on summat an' no one knew 'ow 'e'd got it. So
I thinks to meself--" He hesitated, looking doubtfully at his
interrogator. "You'll play fair, you gentlemen," he whined, "you
won't let nothink I say be used agin me? I needn't ha' come 'ere if
I 'adn't wanted to--"</p>

<p>"Tell us all you know and you'll be none the worse for it,"
Stoddart said curtly.</p>

<p>"Well," he drew back with an air of relief, "I come 'ere now
because I could see I 'ad a bit o' information and thought it might
be worth a bit o' money. Nobody knows I met the cop 'cept 'im and
me, and if you put 'im out of it there's only me--and if you arsk
me, I tell yer I believe he got a bit o' vallyble information out
o' that there bit o' paper."</p>

<p>"What did he do with the bit of paper?" Both detectives bent
forward eagerly.</p>

<p>The tramp shook his head.</p>

<p>"I can't tell yer that, gentlemen, for I knows no more than the
babe unborn. When I left 'im 'e was standin' in the middle of the
road a-readin' of it over again. I went my ways, and when I 'ears
about the murder I 'ooks it, and never 'eard no more till I picked
up the noospaper in the road outside o' Mapsdale."</p>

<p>Stoddart muttered a strong word under his breath.</p>

<p>"You didn't see him put it in his pocket? Think," he urged,
signing to Harbord to get the beer jug replenished.</p>

<p>"I didn't stop to see what 'e done with it. I tell 'ee--'e was
a-standin' in the middle o' the road 'oldin' the paper in 'is
'and--like so." He held up both hands in front of him as if
grasping a visionary slip of paper. "I turned my back to 'im,
a-walkin' along the road towards Medchester, and I went round a
corner and didn't see 'im no more. Then when I 'ears about the
murder--"</p>

<p>The inspector held up his hand. "We know all that," he said
curtly, "you 'opped it. Would you know the woman again who came
through the little gate?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that I would. I seed 'er face plain enough in the
moonlight."</p>

<p>Stoddart drew the page his colleague had cut from the
illustrated paper from his pocket and laid it on the table before
him.</p>

<p>"Anything like that?" he asked, spreading it out flat.</p>

<p>The man pushed his red-crowned head forward and studied the
picture; frowned, put his head on one side and pulled the sheet
nearer to him.</p>

<p>"That's 'er," he said shortly, "that's the face I saw in the
moonlight."</p>

<p>"You're certain?" the inspector pressed.</p>

<p>He nodded. "That's 'er all right," and added thoughtfully, "so
'elp me, Gawd."</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER 24</h2>

<p>The two detectives, having got rid of their visitor for the time
being, looked at one another with raised brows.</p>

<p>"Well," Stoddart remarked, "that's that. Pretty exasperating
about that paper, but we've got something definite to go on at
last. I'd like to know what that bit of paper was about, and
whether poor Mayer was shot for the sake of it. Seems to me,
Alfred, our theory looks like holding good--the same hand fired
both shots. Mayer knew too much."</p>

<p>He paused a moment lost in thought.</p>

<p>"I rang up Mrs. Burford," he went on, "while you were away in
Medchester and said I should like another bit of a talk with her,
but I'm not sure after this that I want it, not straight off. You
might ring up and cry off for me. The story wants a bit of thinking
out, and the sooner we get on to it the better--and keep a line on
Mr. Ted Watson."</p>

<p>The message had found Anne nearly at the end of her tether.</p>

<p>It is one thing to face a dramatic moment with calmness and
fortitude; it is quite another to face life day in day out, week by
week, the sword of Damocles suspended by the slenderest of threads,
and yet to keep up a brave, unflinching attitude towards a world
that will certainly judge you through its head rather than its
heart.</p>

<p>For Anne could gauge the situation into which by her own act she
had precipitated herself fairly accurately. Judged on the merits of
the case, to put it colloquially, she hadn't a leg to stand upon;
she was well aware of that, even though ignorant of the fact that
owing to Lady Medchester's evidence the police knew she had been in
the summer-house that night. If she stood firm in her refusal to
admit her brother's part in the meeting arranged between herself
and Saunderson--and she had every intention of doing so--her
assignation, were she to admit it, would bear inevitably a sinister
interpretation, would connect her with his death in a manner more
sinister still.</p>

<p>Over and over, round and round her brain, every conceivable
aspect of the affair revolved. Night and day she got no peace; her
last thought at night, it greeted her when she opened her eyes in
the morning; and adding the last straw to the burden was Harold's
coldness, his curt, unsympathetic message sent through a woman he
knew she detested, and, worst of all, his continued absence.
Considering all the circumstances and the supreme sacrifice she had
been prepared to make for him and for the sake of the family name,
dragged by his action through the mud, it seemed unbelievable that
he should stand aloof now that she was in trouble.</p>

<p>Not even to her husband had she divulged the true circumstances
of that night. He knew as much as she had told the police--no more.
It would be part of the reward of the trials she had faced that her
brother and the family name should go unscathed, especially in the
eyes of the man who had stood by her and whom she loved with all
her heart. Her loyalty had withstood every temptation, but when the
message came that Inspector Stoddart proposed to pay her another
inquisitorial visit she found herself at breaking point, and in
something approaching panic had flung herself into her husband's
study where he was busy over the day's correspondence, and to his
surprise and distress burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Michael," she sobbed, "I can't stand it! That inspector is
coming again, and I know I shall--shall go mad--and say something I
don't mean--and"--as he drew her on to a low seat in the window
beside him--"which probably won't be true!"</p>

<p>He slipped a protective arm round her. "Why should you mind?" he
soothed. "Whatever others may think, <i>we</i> know Harold is
innocent and, knowing that, nothing you say is likely to
incriminate him."</p>

<p>But Anne remained silent, desperately undecided whether to make
a clean breast of it to him or not. She was so passionately anxious
to keep her brother's character unstained in the eyes of the man
who had so generously joined his fortunes with her own in the
moment of her trouble. If she told him half the truth only, how
explain her presence in the summer-house that night? She was torn
two ways, shaken by slow sobs as her husband, not understanding,
tried to calm her obvious terror of being raked by the fire of
Scotland Yard methods again.</p>

<p>The truth was he himself was a little puzzled. Harold's attitude
with regard to his marriage was not the attitude of a happy
bridegroom; still less that of a man whose actions were free and
independent. He seemed rather in the position of a man forced to do
something against his will, and, although Anne continued to
reiterate her faith in his innocence, her husband found himself
subconsciously adding a question mark whenever the subject was
mentioned. There was something behind it all he did not understand,
and Michael Burford hated mysteries.</p>

<p>But the immediate necessity was to comfort Anne and soothe her
fears, and patiently he recapitulated the arguments in favour of
her brother's innocence, Anne knowing all the time he was in
possession of only half the facts, and therefore quite unaware of
the motive that might have spurred Harold into a criminal act.</p>

<p>In that lay the difficulty of her position. It was so hard that
now Harold had made good, had, as she knew privately, redeemed the
incriminating paper the moment his heritage as Lord Gorth enabled
him to raise sufficient money for the purpose, her tongue must
still remain tied as to her motive for arranging the meeting with
Saunderson that evening. The fact still remained that Harold's
misdemeanour had forced her into consenting to marry a man she
hated, and that her brother had accepted the sacrifice; further, a
knowledge of all the facts would certainly justify the police in
regarding Harold with the gravest suspicion.</p>

<p>It amounted to this, that if she were to tell Michael of her
visit to the summer-house, she must suppress the reason, and leave
it to his generosity to put upon it an innocent interpretation.</p>

<p>And now, here were her nerves giving way when she wanted all the
backing they could give, and she sobbed incoherent phrases into her
husband's broad shoulder while he silently breathed fire and
brimstone against the Yard and all its ways, and determined to pay
the detective a visit on his own account and extort from him an
explanation of his conduct and suspicions.</p>

<p>Then, at breaking point, Stoddart's second message came through,
and Anne, in an ecstasy of relief, was in danger of being overcome
by an attack of hysterical laughter. With the resilience of youth
the hope once more reasserted itself that, if only the real
murderer could be found, Harold's forgery of Saunderson's name, and
her own assignation with him might never transpire, but lie, buried
between them, till the day when according to general belief no
secrets will be hid. Such secrets, she thought optimistically,
might not loom so large in a world where all cupboards will be
opened and skeletons invited to walk out. Some of them, at all
events, might be overlooked in the crowd.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was a respite, and, to her husband's relief, Anne
dried her eyes and joyfully accepted his offer to drive her into
Medchester in the car.</p>

<p>It was a radiant autumn day, the glowing tints of beech and elm,
the more vivid for the deep blue background of an almost cloudless
sky, and in the reaction from her black hour Anne felt almost happy
as she slipped in beside Michael and pulled the door of the car to
after her. There is an exhilaration in rapid motion that will
dislodge dull care from most shoulders, and the colour began to
creep back into Anne's cheeks, the life into her eyes.</p>

<p>At the corner where the roads from East Molton and from Holford
to Medchester forked, they met the bus heading for Holford. Anne
glanced at it indifferently, little thinking that it carried with
it the key to the riddle they had all been so vainly trying to
solve, and upon which hung so much of vital importance to her own
future and to that of her brother.</p>

<p>Anne Burford was not the only woman in the neighbourhood who had
been fighting her way through an emotional storm that day, the main
difference in the situation being that whereas the one found
herself almost submerged by circumstances brought about by no fault
of her own, the other had brought them on herself, and was in
addition therefore confronted by remorse and a sense of
ill-doing.</p>

<p>It had been Mrs. Mayer's last day at her home in Medchester
police station. The new superintendent had proved to be unmarried
and, being of a kindly disposition, had begged her not to hurry
herself, but to transport herself and her belongings to other
quarters at her own convenience. So she had packed at her leisure,
and it was not until she had emptied the drawers in the
old-fashioned bureau, standing against the wall in her bedroom, of
their contents that she made an overwhelming discovery.</p>

<p>In the first flush of it she had stood, rigid, gazing into
space, her eyes filled with dismay, fear, and a sense of right
struggling for mastery. Then, coming to a sudden decision, she had
closed her lips in a thin, hard line, put on coat and hat, and with
a parcel in her hand had caught the bus for Holford.</p>

<p>Inspector Stoddart, having finished lunch at the "Medchester
Arms," was on the point of starting for the Hall when he was told
by Mrs. Marlow's maid there was some one to see him. He was
inclined to be impatient at the interruption.</p>

<p>During the last twenty-four hours events had been shaping
themselves more satisfactorily, but the whole case was still too
much in the air for any definite action to be taken. Harbord's
discovery in the dentist's waiting-room of the ownership of the
crystal beads, added to the redhaired tramp's evidence, had given
substantial grounds for a well-defined line of inquiry, but there
still remained a most important point which would have to be
established before proceeding further.</p>

<p>So when it transpired that the some one's name was Mayer, the
widow of the murdered superintendent, Stoddart decided to postpone
his visit to the Hall and to receive her in their sitting-room,
with Harbord in attendance to take notes or bear witness should
witness be required.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer was ushered in, breathless from her journey and, as
she would have said herself, upset, whether through fear or shock
it was impossible to say at first sight. She sank into the chair
placed for her by Harbord, hugging to her the parcel she was
carrying as if loath to part with it.</p>

<p>The inspector gave her time to pull herself together, then he
asked gently:</p>

<p>"Is there anything I can do for you, Mrs. Mayer?" He had always
felt sorry for the poor woman.</p>

<p>She turned a pair of frightened eyes towards him.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean any harm," she said in a low voice. "I never
thought as how it could matter. Believe me," bending forward
earnestly, "I wouldn't have done it if I'd known. I knew I didn't
ought--not to hide anything from the police--Bill he often said
that in my hearing--'Don't hide anything from the police,' he
said--and I never thinking--not knowing as how there'd ever be
anything--"</p>

<p>"I dare say it's nothing very serious, Mrs. Mayer," Stoddart
said kindly. "You tell us what it is and don't go making yourself
unhappy about it before the time. Tell us all about it in your own
way."</p>

<p>She sat straight up in the chair and placed the parcel on the
table in front of her.</p>

<p>"I've got to make a clean breast of it sooner or later, so I
suppose I may as well do it straight off," making a brave effort at
self-control. "After all, I didn't mean any harm, and you won't
forget that, inspector."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," he encouraged, "we shall be glad to hear
anything you have to say."</p>

<p>"Well, it was like this. The day after my Bill was"--she
hesitated for a word and her lip quivered--"shot, it came over me
to go and see the spot--sort of sacred--you understand--"</p>

<p>She paused again.</p>

<p>Stoddart, who was hanging on her words, convinced somehow they
were going to get the truth about Mayer's death, nodded in
silence.</p>

<p>"So peaceful it looked," she went on, her eyes becoming dreamy,
"the tree trunks rising up out of the green moss; the ground strewn
with red and yellow leaves--some of them fallen fresh in the night;
there was a bird chirruping somewhere--you'd never have thought a
man had been killed there. I just looked round, and wished the
trees and the bushes could have spoken and told me the name of the
coward who'd done it--killed a man doing his duty."</p>

<p>Again she paused, and neither of her hearers seemed inclined to
break the silence. She sighed heavily and resumed:</p>

<p>"My eyes fell on something glittering under a bush, and when I
went to see what it was I found it was the shiny peak of a cap. I
picked it up--my Bill's cap--dropped there, I suppose, and
overlooked when they took him away to the Cottage Hospital."</p>

<p>The inspector glanced at the parcel on the table.</p>

<p>"The cap was missed when they went over his clothes, Mrs. Mayer,
and a constable went back to look for it next day. Of course he
didn't find it."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, inspector, I am indeed; but it was my Bill's cap,
which I'd brushed for him and watched him put on his head when he
left me that morning. I just couldn't give it up! I know I oughtn't
to have kept it--it belonged to the Government and all that--and I
oughtn't to hide anything from the police--and Bill a policeman so
to speak himself--but there it was! I kept it and," she added
fiercely, "I meant to have kept it till my dying day in spite of
all the police in the world!"</p>

<p>Again there was silence.</p>

<p>"And why didn't you?" Stoddart asked gently.</p>

<p>"Providence is inscrutable in His ways, and He made me do the
right thing in spite of myself," she said simply. "I took Bill's
cap home with me, hid under my jacket, and I went half-way round
Medchester and in at the little garden gate at the back of the
police station instead of by the front, fearful I'd meet a
constable who'd ask me what I'd got hid. Then I wrapped it up in a
bit of clean tissue paper what Betty's--that's my daughter--new
black hat had come in, and put it away in the drawer of an old bit
of furniture that was left to Bill by an old gentleman he'd done a
good turn to when burglars got into his house. And I'd never have
told anyone, not the police nor even my own daughter that I'd got
it, if it hadn't been for--for what I found out."</p>

<p>"What did you find out, Mrs. Mayer?" Stoddart urged, as
patiently as he could. Perhaps it might amount to nothing after
all.</p>

<p>She hesitated and drawing the parcel towards her fidgeted with
the string.</p>

<p>"It was when I was packing up to come away to-day. I came to
tell you at once when I knew," she protested. "I opened the drawer
and took out the cap from the back, and I sat down in a chair and
held it in my hand and thought of how Bill had put it on that
morning, and how glad I was I had got something he had worn the
last thing before--before--"</p>

<p>"I am sure you were," the inspector said sympathetically, "and
then--?"</p>

<p>"Then I was just passing my fingers over it--loving-like--and I
found, slipped into the lining that runs round inside, a bit of
paper. I pulled it out and I saw it had something written on it,
and in a minute I remembered all the talk and the questions about
Bill having learnt something after he'd left me in the morning, and
how the coroner and the police had thought that was what he'd been
shot for, and how nobody had found out what it was, and there was I
hiding the very thing that maybe they were all looking for. It gave
me a shock, it did--and I came along here as quick as I could."</p>

<p>"The red-haired tramp! Lord, how the pieces begin to fit in!"
Harbord muttered.</p>

<p>With fingers that shook the poor woman unfastened the string,
and from the tissue paper produced the peaked uniform cap that had
belonged to her husband. She pushed it across the table to the
inspector.</p>

<p>"I never so much as looked at it--just let it be as it was," she
explained. "I knew it didn't ought to be there, not in an ordinary
way like--he never carried anything inside his cap. Didn't I know,
as gave it a brush up and put it on his head for him as often as
not! So I've brought it along. I am sorry--and a woman can't say
more."</p>

<p>Stoddart took the folded slip of paper from the strip of lining
and laid the cap back on the table. There was dead silence in the
room as he read what was written in rather faded ink. When he had
finished he turned to his colleague and for all the expression that
appeared on his features they might have been carved in wood.</p>

<p>"Ask Mrs. Marlow to give Mrs. Mayer a cup of tea before she
starts back, Alfred," he said.</p>

<p>Harbord disappeared, and Stoddart looked at the woman seated
opposite.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have kept the cap back, you know, Mrs. Mayer.
It's Government property and it's a criminal offence to hide
anything from the police that may forward the ends of justice."</p>

<p>"I know that," she admitted, "but when a woman has lost--the
best man what ever was--"</p>

<p>The words tailed off into a sob.</p>

<p>The inspector gave the cap the slightest push in her
direction.</p>

<p>"It's the paper that's wanted," he said with a gruffness assumed
possibly to hide a different emotion; turning his back, he stared
out of the window.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayer hesitated, put out a hand, and gathered the cap into
the shelter of her coat, safe from prying eyes. Then with a
grateful glance at the figure standing by the window she softly
left the room.</p>

<p>When Harbord returned his superior was scanning the slip of
paper held up in front of him.</p>

<p>"Well?" Harbord asked eagerly.</p>

<p>The other looked up with a grim smile and handed him the slip of
paper.</p>

<p>"All we want," he said tersely. "The one link that was
missing--the motive!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>Stoddart reached for his hat and coat.</p>

<p>"I am going straight off to get a warrant," he said, making for
the door.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER 25</h2>

<p>"That's the third car from the Hall you've opened the gate for,
mother."</p>

<p>Miss Tottie Delauney flattened her nose against the casement
window of the lodge and peered out into the fading light of the
autumn afternoon.</p>

<p>"What's up at the Hall? And here's another," she added as a
raucous hoot outside sent Mrs. Yates trotting through the front
door. In a moment she was back again.</p>

<p>"That was Mrs. Baily-Barton," she informed her daughter,
breathless from the effort of swinging the heavy gates to and fro.
"Her chauffeur is a son of John Nomes's that keeps the tobacco shop
in Medchester High Street. Here's another! Mirandy, go and open the
gate, there's a good girl. I can't get me breath all in a
minute."</p>

<p>"Not me!" was the casual retort. "Let 'em open it themselves.
Don't you put yourself out, mother. Chauffeur indeed! Fat and lazy!
Why can't he get out and open it himself? The machine won't run
away."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Yates was already bustling down the gravel path to the
drive, and the creak of a ponderous hinge broke into the soft purr
of the big car awaiting her kind offices inside the gates.</p>

<p>"Who was that?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Yates, returning, a hand clasped to her heart, made no
reply.</p>

<p>"Why don't you prop it open? There's no sense running in and out
like that, and I don't suppose any strays'll get in from the
road."</p>

<p>"Blest if I don't next one as comes through. There's bin a
tea-party goin' on at the Hall--so Mr. Wilton said when he passed
through to the gardens this morning--in honour of young Lord
Gorth--Mr. Harold that was--and his young lady."</p>

<p>"She's older than him, I guess, and she's older than that Mrs.
Stuck-up Burford with her nose in the air for all that I could
tell--" Miss Delauney stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"You hold your tongue, Mary Ann," her mother interposed
hurriedly, "especially when it comes to talking about yer betters.
They are going to be married to-morrow, quiet-like in Holford
Church. I do hold with going to church--seems kinder asking a
blessing--and you want all the help you can get when it comes to
husbands. That's what I say. That husband o' yours, Mary Ann--"</p>

<p>"Oh, leave him alone, mother!" was the sharp retort. "What's the
good of raking up things best forgot? Let sleeping dogs lie. The
less the police mess round the better. I gave 'em a hint and they
didn't take it--if they can't see through a stone wall I'm not the
one to make a hole in it for them. There's another car! I wouldn't
demean myself running out after them," Miss Delauney added as her
mother scrambled to her feet, "not if I was you."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose his lordship gives me my house for, rent
free?" Mrs Yates threw back at her from the door. "And what do you
suppose I should do without it?"</p>

<p>"You wait till I come into me own," Miss Delauney muttered. "I
suppose a wife has got her rights."</p>

<p>Having sped the parting guest, Mrs Yates returned to her
chair.</p>

<p>"That was Lady Darman, high and haughty she is. I wonder her
ladyship asked her. I hear his lordship's going to town and won't
be home till the end of the week. Don't hold with the marriage he
don't--so Mr. Wilton says--but her ladyship's fair set on it."</p>

<p>It had, however, been by no wish of Lady Medchester's that the
neighbourhood had been enjoying the hospitality of Holford Hall
that afternoon. Ostensibly with the object of introducing her own
acquaintances to the future Lady Gorth, invitations had been sent
out; but Lord Medchester had refused to lend his countenance to the
entertainment. He had taken himself off to London until it and the
subsequent marriage ceremony at the village church should be over.
Reluctantly admitting his jurisdiction did not extend to Church
matters, and that Miss Stainer was entitled to be married in any
church she chose, he could only express his disapproval publicly by
absenting himself and advertising the fact to all and sundry who
might be interested.</p>

<p>The party brought together with so depressing an atmosphere
inspiring it had not been a success. Those among Lady Medchester's
neighbours who had accepted the invitation had done so mainly out
of curiosity, and finding themselves entertained perfunctorily by
an apparently apathetic hostess, and treated with a sort of hostile
insolence by the woman who proposed to settle down among them, had
departed as quickly as bare politeness permitted, leaving behind
them in the large drawing-room used only for receptions of a more
or less formal nature, and insisted upon by Miss Stainer on this
special occasion, four people in varying degrees of bad temper.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester made no effort to hide her annoyance and
humiliation at the performance she had just gone through. She was
not accustomed to giving parties that were failures, and she turned
to Anne Burford, present more or less under compulsion, with an
unspoken appeal for sympathy that was very unusual in her attitude
towards her cousin.</p>

<p>Harold sat in a corner frankly in the sulks, and Miss Stainer,
the fourth occupant of the room, was trying to put a good face on
the situation by humming a tune and standing with assumed
nonchalance on the hearth-rug, warming a foot at the fire.</p>

<p>Destiny as often as not seems to set the stage for life's most
poignant dramas with a careless hand. No studied grouping of
principal actors, no background of significant details, nor play of
limelight on the stars of the piece. The scene as the act opens may
be commonplace and undistinguished, the position of the players
apparently haphazard, until the red light of tragedy transforms the
common setting of everyday life into an indelible picture.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester, at the end of her patience, looked irritably
across the room at her guest.</p>

<p>"I wish you would stop humming that thing, Sybil," she
protested, "it gets on my nerves. You were at it all the
afternoon--and out of tune at that!"</p>

<p>Miss Stainer turned sharply, a reply on her lips; but before she
could speak the door opened and before anyone realized what was
happening, unannounced, Inspector Stoddart and Harbord were
standing inside the room.</p>

<p>Lady Medchester, with a suppressed cry of terror, pressed a hand
to her heart and fell back in her chair. Anne, suddenly faced with
possible danger, crept instinctively to her brother's side; he
slipped a protective arm round her and murmured something in her
ear.</p>

<p>But Stoddart, his face cold and impassive as Anne had never seen
it, took no notice of them. He crossed to the fireplace where Miss
Stainer stood, staring at him, eyes wide and desperate, and laid a
hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sybil Stainer, I arrest you in the name of the law for the
murder of Robert Saunderson on the twenty-ninth of August last--and
I warn you anything you say now may be used in evidence against
you!"</p>

<p>There was a moment of tense silence; the movement of a hand as
if in search of a handkerchief; a sharp report--and Sybil Stainer
dropped limply at Stoddart's feet.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER 26</h2>

<p>Two days later, each with a bit of the story to tell, Inspector
Stoddart and his companion were ushered into the library at Holford
Hall, where Lord Medchester awaited them.</p>

<p>"I shall be interested to hear how you arrived at your
conclusions, inspector," he remarked, motioning them to be seated.
"To be quite frank, I never liked the woman--couldn't imagine what
the devil my wife saw in her. But it's a bit of a shake-up to have
a thing of that sort happen under your own roof--a damn sight worse
than the murder, being a woman and all that," he finished
vaguely.</p>

<p>"No need for you to go over the threads that led us nowhere,"
Stoddart began. "We'll follow up the main line of it. It seemed
such a precious tangle when we began, bringing us up against a
blank wall time and again. Where there was motive we were
confronted with a watertight alibi; and where opportunity could be
proved the motive was wanting--and murder without motive is a
senseless sort of proposition."</p>

<p>Lord Medchester acquiesced. "Give me the salient facts. What put
you on to the line eventually?"</p>

<p>"As often as not it's one part grey matter to two parts chance
that does the trick; though I will say that if the grey matter were
to be entirely absent perhaps the so-called chances wouldn't turn
up. Anyway, the first definite pointer we got was because my
colleague"--he jerked his head in Harbord's direction--"couldn't
sleep one night on account of toothache. And even then there didn't
seem to be any motive."</p>

<p>He pulled his chair a few inches nearer to his listeners, and
carefully deposited his hat underneath.</p>

<p>"No need to repeat what you know already," he went on, "but I'd
better tell you straight away there's one bit of the story will
have to come out before the evidence can be pieced together. I'm
sorry, Lord Medchester."</p>

<p>And, as considerately as the circumstances permitted, he
repeated all that Lady Medchester had told him of her part in the
affair, and her presence in the garden that night, while his hearer
sat as though turned to stone, unable to refute and loyally
reluctant to accept the statement.</p>

<p>"The difficulty all through with which we were faced," the
inspector went on hurriedly, glad to get on less delicate ground,
"was the ownership of the crystal beads. They were peculiar beads,
cut in a peculiar way, not outstandingly unique, but I had noticed
that in the broken necklace picked up in the shrubbery one of them
was missing, leaving a gap in the chain, and the bead next to the
gap was broken. A bit of a signpost that. Miss Stainer never
entered into my calculations, and I don't mind confessing now I was
taking an interest in Miss Tottie Delauney, Mrs. Yates's daughter,
who had kept her presence at the lodge so quiet and was so ready to
try and put the crime on some one else's shoulders. But there
wasn't enough to go on."</p>

<p>"There would have been opportunity there, with her headquarters
at the lodge," Lord Medchester muttered, "and, if she gets his
money, motive."</p>

<p>"True enough, especially in poor Mayer's case--to keep his mouth
shut. But nobody was forthcoming to testify to her having been near
the Hall or in the gardens that night and--well, I've had a good
bit of experience, and Miss Delauney wasn't the type that goes so
far as a murder--much less two of them. She's more the kind that's
nervous of firearms because she doesn't know which end they'll go
off at. The motive wasn't so very plain, either. She didn't care
for her husband nor his goings-on with other women, and couldn't be
sure whether he'd made a Will or not. She confessed as much. She
had persuaded him into making her an allowance, and if he had made
a Will it was quite possible she might have found herself better
off with him alive than dead. That seemed to put her out of
court."</p>

<p>Lord Medchester nodded assent. "And how did you get on to Sybil
Stainer?"</p>

<p>Stoddart smiled. "That's where this man comes in."</p>

<p>He turned to Harbord, who shook his head, being of a retiring
disposition and nothing of a spokesman. The inspector resumed:</p>

<p>"He had toothache one night, as I was telling you"--he indicated
his companion--"and went off next morning to see a dentist in
Medchester. As no appointment had been made he had to kick his
heels in the waiting-room till his turn came. And now this is, we
must admit, where chance gave a hand rather than grey matter."</p>

<p>He paused impressively. Inspector Stoddart was not wanting in a
sense of the dramatic.</p>

<p>"Harbord picked up one of the papers lying on the table at
random: an old one--a date in July. One of those illustrated papers
about people in Society. In it he came on a full page portrait and
under it was printed--'Miss Sybil Stainer, one of the stall-holders
at the Duchess of Merebank's bazaar.' And"--he paused, to give due
effect to the words--"round her neck was hanging the crystal bead
necklace, the gap on the chain, the broken bead next to it, hitting
you, so to speak, in the eye!"</p>

<p>Lord Medchester, his interest keenly aroused, bent forward
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Lord! What a bit of luck! and Harold within an ace of marrying
her!" he added under his breath.</p>

<p>"Harbord was so pleased he forgot all about his toothache, made
a dash for the door, and a bee-line for me. And that's how we first
got on to Miss Sybil Stainer.</p>

<p>"But it was only a first step," he continued. "It proved she had
been on the scene of the tragedy that night, but there didn't seem
to be any motive."</p>

<p>"How the devil did the woman know Saunderson was to be at
Holford that night?" Lord Medchester put in.</p>

<p>For an almost imperceptible moment Stoddart hesitated.</p>

<p>"Might have arranged to meet him there for aught we know," he
answered, and turning to Harbord added, "she was on the spot all
right, for, if you remember, we took the very rooms at the
'Medchester Arms' she and her brother had vacated that morning--the
day after the murder. We knew Robert Saunderson was a bit of a
blackmailer, and where that comes in you never know where you are,
low-down blackguards that they are! But we searched his papers and
not a trace could we find of any transactions with Miss Sybil
Stainer."</p>

<p>The inspector added the incident of the finding of the stray
bead by the little gate; no doubt it had lodged in her dress or bag
when the necklace broke and fell in the road as she passed through
the gate.</p>

<p>"But we hadn't seen the tramp then," he added.</p>

<p>"Not justified in making an arrest and didn't want to question
her for fear of putting her on her guard?"</p>

<p>"That's so; and while we were hesitating about forcing the
situation Providence again played into our hands."</p>

<p>The inspector proceeded to relate the story the red-haired tramp
had had to tell, confirming the silent testimony of the crystal
beads, that Sybil Stainer had been in the gardens that night; of
the paper she had dropped, of how it had lain in his pocket, and of
his meeting with Superintendent Mayer on the morning he was
shot.</p>

<p>"Then we were up against the problem of what Mayer had done with
the slip of paper handed to him by the tramp, and vanished
apparently into the blue, the contents of which Mayer had
considered too important to be divulged either to you or to Mrs.
Yates, and that had sent him posthaste to the nearest telephone.
And then," he said slowly, "Mrs. Mayer came on the scene. She came
to see me at the 'Medchester Arms.'"</p>

<p>"What had she to say?"</p>

<p>Stoddart smiled whimsically. "She was half out of her mind, poor
woman, with grief at the loss of her husband and remorse at having
cheated the law. The truth was, she had found poor Mayer's cap
lying among the bushes near the spot where he was killed, and taken
it home and hidden it, and an hour before she arrived breathless at
the 'Medchester Arms' in search of me had discovered there was a
bit of paper slipped in behind the strip of lining that goes round
inside--without a doubt the paper handed to Mayer by the tramp, and
that he must have placed there for safety."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! It's like putting a puzzle together! Get on with the
story--what had the paper to do with the murders?"</p>

<p>"It put the lid on the evidence against Miss Stainer. I always
said the two murders were done by the same hand. I take it Miss
Stainer overheard Mayer talking to you and what he said at the
telephone through the open window--you remember you found her
brother loafing about outside, though we don't connect him with the
crime. She nipped down by the short cut to intercept the
superintendent before he reached the lodge, inveigled him into the
bushes by pretending to be hurt--any pretext would have done--and
shot him with the automatic she carried in her bag, as we now know,
for use should any desperate emergency arise. She silenced Mayer,
but she didn't allow for the bit of evidence hidden in his
cap."</p>

<p>"What was the nature of that bit of evidence?"</p>

<p>"It was a copy of a marriage certificate," the inspector
replied, "a marriage that took place about four years ago in South
America, between Sybil Stainer and a man called Guido Baruta. He
seems to have vanished into the blue, but there is no record of his
death--we cabled for information. The certificate is in order right
enough, and"--he paused impressively--"the name of Robert
Saunderson was on it as witness! That was good enough!"</p>

<p>Lord Medchester stared at the speaker, his slowly working mind
labouring to put two and two together.</p>

<p>"<i>There</i> was motive, good and plenty!" Stoddart repeated.
"Nothing more wanted. Motive enough, with a brilliant marriage
hanging in the balance and Saunderson with the game in his hands so
far as she was concerned--and motive was all we wanted. A woman who
had committed one murder to gain her ends," he finished slowly,
"wasn't likely to stick at a second--and Miss Sybil Stainer meant
to be Lady Gorth in spite of all the devils in hell! She was that
sort of woman."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"There are two points in this case that need never come out,
Alfred," Stoddart remarked as they walked down the drive towards
the 'Medchester Arms.' "One of them is--What made Anne Courtenay go
to the summer-house that night? Had she an assignation with
Saunderson or was it pure accident? Do you remember the bit of
paper found on Saunderson's body--'I accede because I must'? I
always thought that was written by Anne Courtenay. But she was
shielding that young cub of a brother of hers. I'll bet that was
it, though we may never know now. Miss Stainer, of course, got a
glimpse of her in the garden, guessed her brother Harold was
financially involved with the murdered man, and played one against
the other, making each think the other had done it."</p>

<p>"Just so," Harbord agreed, "and neither of them knew how much
she knew, and both of them had something to hide." he said
thoughtfully. "The truth about that doesn't matter now."</p>

<p>"The other fact about which we may exercise a bit of
<i>suppressio veri</i>," the inspector went on with the suspicion
of a twinkle in his eye, "is the letter from Lady Medchester to
Saunderson we found in Miss Stainer's bag, taken no doubt from the
dead man's pocket-book when she took the marriage certificate--a
letter fit to scorch the hair off your head! No wonder Miss Stainer
had the writer of it under her thumb! That need never come out, for
Lord Medchester's sake; his wife can tell him her own story. He's
had his suspicions about the relations between them all through--he
was always nervous what might come out in evidence--anybody could
see that."</p>

<p>"Funny what some women will do for money and position, and what
chances they'll take!" Harbord remarked thoughtfully. "Then she
found herself in a tight place, and took the simplest way out." And
he added solemnly, "She paid the price."</p>
