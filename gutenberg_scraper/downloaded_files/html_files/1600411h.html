<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<hr>

<p>My gossiping "Notes and Sketches of New South Wales" met with a
reception so cordial and flattering, and so far beyond my own
expectations, that a grateful acknowledgment, in the shape of a
second series, became the natural and inevitable result. The delay
in its appearance has been reluctantly prolonged from year to year,
as our erratic life, and the exacting duties of the present,
precluded attention to a task which, however congenial, had only
reference to the future (for, after the completion of a work here,
fully a year must elapse ere any intelligence of its further
advancement reaches the writer); and this circumstance, so
unfavourable to any literary work, may perhaps excuse the desultory
character of the present one. Could any of my readers have marked
the fitful and uncertain progress of my notes&mdash;sometimes amidst a
Babel of busy tongues, loud on the relative merits of humming or
peg-tops&mdash;or, more often, in brief intervals between lessons in
history, geography, or arithmetic&mdash;when, turning from the mighty
records of Rome and Greece, of Caesar and Lycurgus, I have essayed
to continue the memoir of a pet opossum; or, after setting an
"ugly" sum in multiplication, have laid down slate and pencil to
finish the descriptive portrait of some delicate bush flower&mdash;they
would less marvel at omissions and discrepancies committed, than
that many more probable blunders had been avoided; and would kindly
lay aside the severity of criticism in judging so unpretending a
work.</p>

<p>The risk of typographical errors in a work which must of
necessity go through the press without its author's correction or
revision, is unavoidably great; but the comparative rarity of such
mistakes in my former volume, published under the same adverse
circumstances, encourages me to hope that the present may be as
fortunate.</p>

<p>Lest the minute, perhaps trifling, detail, entered into in some
parts, may seem inclining towards the egotistical, I should perhaps
remark that I have been induced to adopt a more personal narrative,
and to identify ourselves with the simple realities around us, just
as events truly occurred, instead of generalizing my observations,
because I have found, from my own feelings in the perusal of works
of somewhat similar character, that the interest of such
unvarnished histories is proportionally enhanced, according to the
degree of identity preserved by the narrator; and, acting upon this
hint from experience, I have unscrupulously practised the plain
matter-of-fact candour and "individuality" which we ourselves like
to find in the narratives of other dwellers in new countries.</p>

<p>The great amount of misconception and the positive
misrepresentations relative to the present social condition of this
colony, now prevalent, not in England only, but wherever the name
of Von Diemen's Land is known, also determined me to enter more
into domestic details than otherwise I might have thought it
pleasant or desirable to do. No general descriptions would so well
tend to show the truth, as the veritable chronicle of everyday
life, in our solitary yet cheerful country homes, that stand all
day with open doors, and all night without a shutter or bar or bolt
to the windows; as innocent of lawless intrusion as dwellings of a
like isolated and lonely character would be in any part of
Britain&mdash;indeed, much more so; and why our really peaceful lives
should be represented at home as invested with such terrors by day
and perils by night, as might beseem the heroes of old romance in
their most doughty days, I am wholly at a loss to conjecture, and
can only hope that my humble efforts in the cause of truth may
avail in dispelling at least some portion of the evil clouds that
at present sully and overshadow our good name.</p>

<p>I cannot refuse myself the pleasure of here repeating my
grateful and sincere thanks to our highly-esteemed friend, the
Bishop of Tasmania*, whose kind voluntary offer of his valuable
aid, as my illustrator, has enabled me to present some of our
lovely scenes to my readers in a form so well worthy of their own
beauty, and so immeasurably enhancing the interest of my written
descriptions. It is likewise right to remark, that beyond a
knowledge of the localities mentioned, his Lordship has no
acquaintance whatever with the contents of my MSS.; for my errors,
be they few or many, I am alone responsible.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Ebook editor's note: Francis Russell Nixon,
1803-1879.]</p>

<p>Of my own trifling sketches, I am perfectly aware that in their
accuracy rests their sole merit: that they are rigidly faithful, I
can honestly vouch; and as, in weaving a garland, small and
insignificant flowers, worthless in themselves, oft times aid the
general effect, so I am induced to hope, that my little drawings
may peep pleasantly out from nooks and corners of the book, which
would otherwise remain unoccupied.</p>

<p>I beseech the august body of British critics to receive my
unfeigned thanks for the unmixed meed of approval and praise
vouchsafed to my last appearance in print (and many former ones).
Not one dissentient voice mingled in the pleasant sounds of kindly
welcome which so delightfully echoed even into our far-away
solitude here and, like a singing summer breeze, spread over the
peaceful current of my tranquil happy life a bright sunny ripple of
surprise and joy; for from the generous reviewer of the mighty
"Quarterly," to the passing notices of provincial papers, every pen
seemed dipped in honey to greet my unpretending little tome of
womanly gossip.</p>

<p>Some of the Sydney papers, I have been told, kindly took
considerable pains to prove the correctness with which I had
formerly estimated their elegance and ability; but as I have never
myself met with any of their characteristic effusions, I still
remain in blissful unconsciousness of the amount of my obligation
to them.</p>

<p>The concluding paragraph of my gossiping chronicle of
experiences in New South Wales mentioned our departure from Sydney
on our way to Van Diemen's Land; and I now resume the slender
thread of my story where I then broke off*.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "Notes and Sketches of New South Wales,
during a Residence in that Colony from 1839 to 1844. London.
Murray, 1849.]</p>

<p>I return to the morning of our embarkation, when, in a
straggling procession, including the baby, the new nursemaid, the
old pointer, and sundry of our goods and chattels on trucks and
hand-barrows (the main body having been previously shipped), we
proceeded to the jetty, and bade adieu to the friends who came "to
see us out of sight." I must confess that I felt less regret than I
could have believed possible, at leaving a country which had been
my home for above a year; and if a wistful thought did stray back
to the bright and beautiful gardens, the lovely wild flowers, the
delicious fruits, and the deep blue sky of the ever-brown land,
such a thick hot cloud of dust, flies, mosquitoes, and other
detestabilities, rose in imagination before me, as threw a veil
over all such charms; and I parted from them with a stout heart,
full of hopefulness for the future, and rejoicing, above all
things, to take our baby-boy into a more temperate climate, where
the fair promise of his infancy might have some prospect of being
realized in a life of health, strength, and intelligence.</p>

<p>His good kind-hearted nurse (who, being married, could not leave
the colony with us) stood sobbing most piteously as her little
charge was borne away in the arms of a stranger, whose domestic
ties were as yet unformed, she being a starch, prim spinster,
desirous of seeing as much of the world as possible, and of showing
it a very tasteful wardrobe in return. I, too, grieved to lose my
old servant, for she was as cheerful, willing, earnest, and simple
a creature as I ever knew; albeit not perhaps the most dainty
waiting-woman in the world&mdash;for, to hear her footsteps in the
house, one might fancy some tame elephant was pacing about, and I
had often found reason to rejoice that all the rooms at Homebush
were on the ground-floor&mdash;but she was so affectionate and good,
that I should have been well pleased if her heavy footsteps could
still have followed our own. She had odd quaint notions and
expressions, too, that were very droll, uttered as they were with
such earnest seriousness. She told me once, that her former master
"was a very learned gentleman, a great scholar&mdash;<i>so</i> clever at
preaching and doctoring, and talking languages of foreign parts.
Indeed, ma'am, he did serve his time at Cambridge College for a
parson, only he didn't never take no sort of sitiwation after."</p>

<p>The vessel had dropped down the stream, and was anchored some
distance below the town; and when, at the end of our long pull, we
came alongside, the aspect of the "Sir George Arthur" was anything
but inviting. (Why will people persist in giving male names to
ships?) She, that is, "Sir George," had been employed in the
coal-trade between Sydney and the mines at Newcastle, on the Hunter
River, and bore as evident marks of her sooty calling as ever did
an old coal-boat on the Birmingham Canal; whilst the air sweeping
round her wafted over us a veritable coal-smoke odour, full of
murky reminiscences of the good old town. There she lay&mdash;as ugly,
ill-shapen, slovenly, dirty, black, disreputable-looking a tub as
ever sullied the bright blue waves of old Neptune. However, as our
present lot was cast in her&mdash;no other vessel for Hobarton offering
at the time&mdash;we went on board the mis-shapen craft, which seemed to
have been built as much as possible after the model of a brewer's
vat. The deck was as dirty as the rest, and my cabin, which was
tolerably large and convenient, so swarmed with wood-lice that I
soon began to have a tolerably vivid idea of another of the plagues
of Egypt, that of flies having been fully realized during our
sojourn in Sydney.</p>

<p>Whilst we were at dinner, a slight disturbance arose from the
abrupt entrance of certain subordinate members of the legal
profession in search of some considerate friend, who no doubt
wished to spare them the pain of parting, and had therefore quietly
shipped himself without the ceremonies of leave-taking, unless
taking French leave may be so considered; but the affectionate
interest of such friends is not easily eluded, and the poor young
man was finally compelled to forego his humane intentions, and
return to shore with his <i>friends</i>, despite the most vehement
protestations that he was somebody else.</p>

<p>I had hoped to have been able to remain on deck until we had
fairly passed through those great gates, the North and South Heads,
and could look back on the grand entrance to Port Jackson which had
so delighted me a year before; and many were the subtle deceptions
I practised on myself as to the real nature of the indescribable
symptoms which were gradually and horribly creeping over me&mdash;but
all would not do; the approaching misery made a stride with every
roll and lurch of the vessel, and a positive leap when she "went
about." My love for the picturesque waned most lamentably, and I
stowed away my sketch-book as an useless incumbrance: cliffs,
woods, snow-white beaches, and blue waves were at a deplorable
discount, and all sea scenery was so distasteful to me, that I
retreated to my berth.</p>

<p>Servants who are engaged to go a sea voyage always declare
themselves quite indifferent to seasickness&mdash;"never were the least
ill all the way from England"&mdash;and so protested my new maid; but
she proved after all to be quite as poor a sailor as myself. I was
compelled, therefore, to make some exertions in taking care of my
little boy, who appeared happily unconscious of the prevailing
indisposition.</p>

<p>Having a fair and sufficient wind, we expected to have made a
quick passage; but, owing to the vessel being (in strict accordance
with the usual colonial style of that period) only half-rigged, and
wanting top-gallant and studding sails, she progressed very slowly.
A singular disinclination to finish any work completely, is a
striking characteristic of colonial craftsmen, at least of the
"currency," or native-born portion. Many of them who are clever,
ingenious, and industrious, will begin a new work, be it ship,
house, or other erection, and labour at it most assiduously until
it is about two-thirds completed, and then their energy seems
spent, or they grow weary of the old occupation, and some new
affair is set about as busily as the former one, which, meanwhile,
lingers on in a comfortless, helpless, useless condition, till
another change comes over the mind of the workman, and he perhaps
returns to the old work, to which, if a house, he does just enough
to enable the impatient proprietors to occupy it; or if a ship, for
it to go to sea in a half-fledged condition, which is rarely
improved afterwards.</p>

<p>The thoughtful kindness of an old friend of Mr. Meredith's had
supplied us with some new novels, as suitable provision for the
voyage, and when the horrible sea-sickness had subsided into its
second stage of half-dead, half-dreamy, and wholly deplorable
stupor and helplessness, I lay and beguiled the weary time by the
fictitious miseries of the heroines; though, as their narrated
afflictions all happened on dry land, I fear my sympathy was of a
very niggardly order, perhaps closely verging on the envious.</p>

<p>Unlike our snug apartment in the "Letitia," our present rooms
were entered from the mess-cabin, the upper portion of the sliding
door and a window frame beside it being fitted with Venetian
shutters, which, as they could not by any device be induced to shut
close, were a perpetual annoyance, and kept my ingenuity constantly
at work, devising stratagems to complete the concealment they
refused to afford,&mdash;but we could not block them wholly, for want of
air.</p>

<p>My opposite neighbours naturally attracted some of my attention
and interest, as I lay contemplating the outer world of the
mess-cabin through the chinks in my shutters. The lady had, like
myself, been invisible for some days, but her indefatigable lord
was all that time a prey to the most alarming excitement, darting
constantly in and out of her cabin in a most distracting manner,
and keeping the slide-door vibrating to and fro like a pendulum.
Any one who has ever seen a boy with a live mouse in his hat,
covered over with an outspread handkerchief, and remembers the
nervous twitchings up of the corner to peep in, and the spasmodic
hiding-up again, lest the mouse should jump out, may imagine the
daily process of my worthy neighbour "over the way." Fifty times a
day would he dart out, shove the door violently to&mdash;at the imminent
peril of his fingers&mdash;and after making various stages of one, two,
and three yards towards the companion stairs, rush frantically back
again, and bolt the door inside in a most decided manner, always
limiting the aperture to the smallest possible space that he could
thrust himself through, and doing all with the greatest noise
possible, until my sufferings from these shocks became so intense,
that I could not help pitying those of the young wife to whose
solace and benefit they were especially dedicated.</p>

<p>In a berth a little beyond this abode the master of the vessel,
the "captain," who had remained there invisible for some days,
whether really indisposed, or only indisposed to do his duty, I
cannot determine; but certain it is, that he refused to go on deck,
or to take any part in the command, further than by receiving and
giving messages in his cabin. The crew were an idle unruly set, not
more than one or two among them knowing anything of seamanship, and
those very little; and the owner of the whole concern being on
board, chose to stand at the wheel himself a part of each day, and
with a knowing wink to such of the passengers as he took into his
confidence, informed them that "the captain's orders <i>was</i>,
that the wessel should be steered south half west, but I've kep'
her away a point or two to the west,"&mdash;which accounted for our
being rather close in-shore, and must have contributed greatly to
assist the invisible captain in determining the ship's position and
course. We were fortunate in having had fine weather hitherto.</p>

<p>In condemning the idleness of the crew and servants on board, I
must make one memorable exception. There was a smart, active,
good-natured boy, about ten or twelve years old, who, if ever
ubiquity fell to the lot of mortal form, possessed that property;
he was everywhere, doing everything for everybody, and apparently
in at least three places at the same time:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dick! take Mr. Smith some hot water."</p>

<p>"Dick! Mr. Jones wants his coat brushed."</p>

<p>"Dick! bring a light in the cabin."</p>

<p>"Dick! go and swab the deck."</p>

<p>"Dick! peel them 'taturs for cook."</p>

<p>"Dick! you lazy scoundrel&mdash;steward says you've not cleaned his
knives."</p>

<p>"Dick! go and water the sheep" (a whole flock formed part of the
cargo).</p>

<p>"Dick! go and help reef topsails."</p>

<p>"Dick! feed the geese."</p>

<p>"Dick! take these bones to my dog," &amp;c., &amp;c.,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The cry of Dick&mdash;Dick&mdash;Dick&mdash;resounded all day long, and poor
Dick seemed really to execute all the multifarious orders given
him, with the most unflinching alacrity and good humour. One day
Mr. Meredith inquired of the owner, if the ubiquitous Dick was an
apprentice in the ship. "Why, no," drawled forth the broad burly
personage addressed; and then he added, with a slow smile
overspreading and widening his ample countenance,&mdash;"No&mdash;he aint a
'prentice, he's a nevy o' mine, as come aboard for a holiday!"</p>

<p>Alas! for poor relations!</p>

<p>I began to make a "rule-of-three" statement of the question&mdash;if
in a cruize for a holiday, Dick has harder work and rougher usage
than any other creature on board, required the amount of Dick's
sufferings at school?&mdash;but my heart failed me&mdash;I could not work the
sum; and I comfort myself in the thought, that whatever vagrant
propensities might attack Dick in subsequent holidays, he would not
be likely to indulge them by a voyage with his uncle.</p>

<p>As we neared Cape Pillar, on the tenth day of the voyage, I made
an heroic effort to leave my berth, and went on deck for the first
time since passing the Heads. Shortly after I had taken my place
(on a comfortable steady hen-coop), and had begun to enjoy my
return to the upper air and the exhilarating scene around me, a
great sensation seemed to arise in the small community&mdash;servants
ran about and knocked up against each other in the orthodox way of
people who wish to show that they have no time to lose&mdash;then they
dived into the cabin in an agitated and important manner&mdash;presently
they reappeared, one with a cushion, another with a basket, a third
with a cloak&mdash;and after spreading these about, all again plunged
violently below. Another charge accomplished the conveyance on deck
of an umbrella, a pillow, a shawl, a book, and another umbrella.
Then came, in more slow and stately fashion, bobbing up gradually
and fitfully out of the companion, a large easy chair, in and about
and round which, as the nucleus of the whole, the other movables
were carefully disposed, and both umbrellas opened ready for active
service.</p>

<p>Finally, after another pause, heralded by a servant, half
carried by her vigilant spouse, and followed by two more servants,
came the pretty young lady herself, thickly veiled and folded in
multitudinous envelopes. She was presently seated in the easy
chair, her feet raised on a second chair, and the two umbrellas so
carefully arranged that she became again invisible, and my valiant
resolve of tottering across the deck, to offer her the common
civilities natural between such partners in calamity (our
respective husbands being on the most amicable passenger terms) was
fairly and finally extinguished. I felt wholly unequal to the
perilous task of storming such a citadel of exclusiveness, and
remained faithful to my hen-coop and more accessible
acquaintances.</p>

<p>It was a most beautiful afternoon, sunny and pleasant, with a
fair breeze, and, as we sailed along the picturesque coast of
Tasmania, the deep bays, rocky headlands, and swelling hills,
formed a charming panorama, which I roughly and hastily sketched as
we glided past. The white-cliffed Hippolyte Rocks, commonly called
by colonial seamen the "Epaulettes," rising squarely, like masses
of neat masonry above the sea, had exactly the appearance of a
fort, and I almost expected to discern a flag floating over them,
or to be startled by the flash and boom of a cannon from their
snow-white walls; but a flight of sea-birds rising from the summit
was the only token of living residents that the formidable rocks
displayed.</p>

<p>The southern promontory of Fortesque Bay appeared to be entirely
composed of upright basaltic columns, some of them standing alone,
like tall obelisks, but the greater number forming groups of mimic
towers and chimneys. The coast rises considerably towards the
south, where the mountain range terminates abruptly in the Cape
Pillar, a grand basaltic precipice, or rather an assemblage of
precipices, which, seen from the sea, every moment assume some new
and more picturesque aspect. Separated from the mainland only by a
strait of half a mile in width is Tasman's Island, a scarcely less
striking feature in this most grand scenery than the Cape Pillar.
Like it, the island is composed of basaltic columns, though on a
less stupendous scale, but exceedingly fantastic in form,
particularly on the southern side, where the taper spires and
pinnacles seem a part of some ancient Gothic edifice, some
"Lindisfarne" or "Tintern" of bygone glory; whilst, as we gained a
broader view of the cape, it assumed the appearance of a
fortification&mdash;a wall and seaward tower at the north-east end being
singularly well defined. When parallel with the strait, we gained
through it a fine view of another high basaltic promontory. Cape
Raoul, the entrance to Port Arthur being between the two; but this
was soon lost, and the island seemed to fold in, as it were, with
the westerly cliffs of the cape, until in a south view they formed
one towering stupendous mass of dark rocks, most richly tinged with
the changeful rose-colour, and purple, and gold of the sunset's
glorious hues, which shone forth in still greater lustre from
contrast with the deep chasms and ravines which were in almost
black shadow, and with the white crested billows of the blue sea,
that dashed their glittering spray high over the broken crags. It
was a scene never to be forgotten! I have heard much of the
grandeur of the "North Cape" at midnight; but I would not lose my
memory of Cape Pillar at sunset for all the icy glitter of that
more renowned scene.</p>

<p>One great omission in my meagre descriptive sketch I must here
supply, and insert the "figures," which well sustained their share
in the beauty of the scene. These were a very elegant-looking (but
I have no doubt a very dirty and disagreeable) little schooner,
which, as she kept still closer in-shore than our shapeless
unwieldy vessel could do, gave that life and interest to the sea
portion of our view, which a sailing vessel always affords;
distance lending enough of enchantment to romancify the veriest tub
that ever swam, if her sails look white in the sunshine; and the
swarming clouds of "mutton-birds" continually rising from the sea,
where they had floated unobserved, or flying, dipping, swimming,
and diving all around us&mdash;these would alone have furnished me with
ample amusement; as it was, I felt quite busy with so much to
enjoy, and only seemed to fear that I could not look about with
enough energy to observe everything.</p>

Hobarton.&mdash;Cast Anchor.&mdash;Mount Wellington.&mdash;Scenery round

<p>I HAD been asleep some hours that night, when I was awakened by
a strange and terrific noise; and instantly knew, though I had
never heard the sound before, that it was the violent flapping of a
sail blown out of the ropes. Another and another quickly followed,
and buffeted about with a noise like thunder; and the added hubbub
of voices and hurried footsteps on deck told me that some serious
disaster had occurred. I thought, with fear and trembling, of the
iron-bound coast which I had seen so near to us at sunset, and for
once found no comfort in my husband's attempts to reassure me, when
I knocked at the bulk-head of his cabin to know what was the
matter, but helplessly wept over my sleeping baby, expecting each
moment some fearful crisis; nor did my instinctive terror much
exaggerate the peril we were in. The captain of the vessel had
scarcely been seen out of his berth since the day we sailed, and
with only half a crew, and those very ignorant of their duty, it
may well be imagined that the ship could not at any time be
properly worked; but on this particular night, although bad weather
had been anticipated, only one man and a boy composed the "watch;"
and both these were shut up in the caboose drinking coffee, when a
violent squall struck the vessel, with all her canvas set, blew the
sails from the bolt-ropes, and threatened to end our voyage
somewhat speedily on the rocks of Cape Raoul, where several vessels
with every soul on board had perished before. The night was dark,
with a dense fog, and the cliffs were <i>only a mile to
leeward</i>.</p>

<p>I believe we owe our lives, so far as mortal aid availed, to the
promptitude and skill of one of the passengers. Captain Millett
(master of an American merchantman), who, when the squall struck
the vessel, rushed on deck, and gave all the necessary orders and
assistance to restore something like discipline amidst the
confusion and riot on board.</p>

<p>At last, for I thought that dreadful night was interminable, the
morning dawned;&mdash;we were in Storm Bay, which I shall ever think
very accurately named;&mdash;the weather dark, thick, and squally, with
incessant rain. The vessel's deck was so ill-joined that the dirty
water dripped through the chinks all over my bed; and, as I lay
reading, something dark fell into the border of my cap: thinking it
a drop of mud, I snatched off the cap and gave it to the servant,
when, to my horror, I discovered that it was an enormous* centipede
which had fallen upon me, a hideous, many-jointed, many-legged
green creature, about three inches long, with a forked tail, and a
railroad rapidity of progression. My horror in this instance was
soon changed to thankfulness that the dangerous reptile had fallen
where it did; for my happy little child, on whom it might have
dropped, lay sleeping close beside me, and the bite of the
centipede is often more venomous and painful than even the sting of
a scorpion.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Enormous <i>here</i>, but I am told these
amiable-looking creatures thrive best in India, and there grow to
the length of a foot or fourteen inches, and as thick as one's
finger!]</p>

<p>As the weather got slightly better, I went on deck, but all
around was very dreary; the fog hung about, and wind and rain came
in fitful gusts. Whilst I sat, vainly trying to make out something
of the surrounding scenery, Mr. Meredith and several of the other
passengers remarked to the captain, who had "turned out" at last,
that another squall was coming; and indeed I could distinctly see
the ruffled and foaming water rapidly approaching the ship.</p>

<p>"The masts will go, unless you take in sail," said some one,
growing nervous at the apathetic supineness of the captain, who,
lazily gazing aloft, and then resettling himself on a hen-coop,
muttered that he "didn't know&mdash;didn't think they would," and
accordingly no change was made.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> had better go below," said my husband, leading me to
the companion, and before I had reached the cabin, there was a loud
crash&mdash;the rattle of falling rigging and blocks knocking about,
quickly followed by a repetition of the same sounds, as the main
and mizen topmasts successively went over the side. Such an
accident a few hours before would probably have been fatal; but
now, being in smooth water, it was only productive of a little
bustle and discussion.</p>

<p>The bad weather and total discomfort of the latter portion of
our voyage prevented my enjoying the fine scenery of the Derwent,
as we approached Hobarton, sailing past Bruni Island and Iron-pot
Island Lighthouse.</p>

<p>The situation of the town is the most beautiful that can be
conceived&mdash;on the rising banks of the noble Derwent, with green
meadows, gardens, and cultivated land around it, interspersed with
pleasant country residences and farms; and, above and beyond all,
the snowy mountain peaks soaring to the very clouds. At length we
cast anchor. The rattle of the chain-cable must always be a welcome
sound at such a time, but perhaps our recent hair-breadth 'scapes
lent a still pleasanter tone to its rough music, which at the
moment eclipsed, in my estimation, the choicest concerto ever
composed; and we immediately went ashore, most thankful and
delighted to step once more on land.</p>

<p>The great difference between Sydney and Hobarton struck me as
forcibly during my first ten minutes walk as after a longer
acquaintance; and, in point of pleasantness, I must certainly award
the palm to the latter. It is a much smaller place than Sydney, but
its home-like English aspect at once won my preference.</p>

<p>Our next fortnight passed happily among relatives whom I had not
seen since childhood, and in a cool breezy climate, that reminded
us of April in England: the weather was too showery to admit of so
much out-door amusement as I could have wished; still, the cool
moist greenness everywhere was most refreshing and cheering to me;
the little gardens before and between many houses in the middle of
the town, with their great bushes of geraniums in bloom, were all
full of sweet English spring flowers, looking happy and healthy,
like the stout rosy children that everywhere reminded me of HOME;
so different to the thick white complexions and tall slender forms
so prevalent in New South Wales. The houses, too, at least the few
I entered during our short sojourn, were more snug than showy, as
if the English attribute of comfort more especially belonged to
them.</p>

<p>In the streets, carriages and equestrians were less numerous
than in Sydney, and I found that here it was not only believed
possible, but positively "fashionable," for ladies to walk about;
an improvement upon Sydney customs, which is in a great measure
attributable to the climate. The shops were numerous and good, and
the buildings neat and substantial, chiefly of brick, but many of
the newer ones of cut stone. Some of the more suburban streets, or
rather the suburban ends of them, consisting of good detached
houses standing in nice gardens, and adorned by verandas covered
with lovely plants, are very pleasant, commanding fine views of the
harbour; and from every point I visited, Mount Wellington (or Table
Mountain) forms the crowning glory of the landscape. Rising
immediately behind the town to the height of 4200 feet, with its
summit of basaltic columns covered with snow more than half the
year, its aspect is one of ever-varying, but never-decreasing
grandeur. Whether it was wreathed in fleecy vapours, dark with
rolling clouds, or stood out clear and sunlit against the blue
morning sky, I was never weary of gazing on this magnificent
object.</p>

<p>A stream flowing from the mountain through a picturesque ravine
and valley, supplies the town with water, turning a number of mills
of various kinds in its course. To a botanist, Mount Wellington
must be a treasury of gems, many rare and beautiful plants
inhabiting its wild and almost inaccessible glens and ravines. The
ascent of the mountain is long, and was formerly very fatiguing;
but the formation, for a considerable distance, of a road passable
for horses, has greatly reduced the difficulty. Several unfortunate
persons who at various times have imprudently attempted the ascent
without a guide, have never returned, nor has any vestige of them
ever been discovered; most probably they have fallen into some of
the deep chasms and fissures, and, if not killed instantly, have
lingered awhile, and died of starvation. The view from the summit
is described as surpassingly grand and beautiful, as indeed it must
be, from its great altitude and the varied and picturesque scenery
around.</p>

<p>I have been frequently told that the real Waratah is found on
Mount Wellington, and have since seen several specimens of the
flower mistaken for it&mdash;very different and inferior indeed to my
gorgeous favourite of the Blue Mountains. The Tasmanian Waratah is
a shrub or bushy tree, with handsome dark-green foliage, and bright
red flowers of loosely-clustered trumpet florets, scarcely so large
as an English woodbine.</p>

<p>We passed the chief part of our sojourn at Newtown, in the
environs of Hobarton, where many of the wealthier merchants,
government officers, and professional men have tasteful residences.
The church and the Queen's Orphan Schools are large and handsome
buildings; in the latter, children of both sexes are clothed and
educated*.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The children received into the Queen's
Orphan Schools are those of prisoners, male or female, undergoing
probation or sentence, orphans, and children deserted by their
parents; the former are admitted by order of the
Comptroller-General of Convicts, the latter through the Colonial
Secretary, with the authority of the Lieutenant-Governor. The
prisoners' children are paid for by the British Government, the
orphans and deserted children by the Colonial Government. There are
usually between 400 and 500 children in the schools; when old
enough, they are apprenticed as servants or to some useful trade.
They are superintended and instructed by the following officers&mdash;a
superintendent, at 500 per annum; a chaplain, at 50; a physician,
at 150; a purveyor, at 120; a teacher of psalmody, at 50; a
schoolmaster, at 150; a matron, at 50; a Roman Catholic master,
at 35; a matron of female school, at 130; a schoolmistress, at
60; a Roman Catholic schoolmistress, at 60. The expense of each
child, including maintenance, clothing, pay of of officers and
servants of every description, and repair of buildings, averages
from 10 to 12 per annum.]</p>

<p>The scenery around Newtown is the most beautiful I have seen on
this side the world&mdash;very much resembling that of the Cumberland
Lakes: the broad and winding estuary of the Derwent flows between
lofty and picturesque hills and mountains, clothed with forests,
whilst at their feet lie level lawn-like flats, green to the
water's edge. But the most English, and therefore the most
beautiful things I saw here, were the hawthorn hedges; those of
sweetbriar, which are, I think, more general, did not, please me
half so well, not having so much of common country home life about
them.</p>

<p>It seemed like being on the right side of the earth again, to
see rosy children with boughs of flowering "May," and to feel its
full luscious perfume waft across me. Let no one who has always
lived at home, enjoying unnoticed the years bounty of
rainbow-tinted blossoms, fancy he knows the full value of English
flowers, or the love that the heart can bear for them. I thought I
always held them in as fond admiration as any one could do, but my
delight in these hawthorn hedges proved to me how much my regard
had strengthened in absence; and as I recalled to mind the wide
brown deserts I had lately left, with their miles of "post and
rail," or more hideous "log" and "deadwood" fences, and then took
an imaginary glance over the green hawthorn hedges and elm-shaded
lanes of my own beautiful native land, I heartily wished that all
dwellers in her pleasant country places could only know and feel
what a paradise they inhabit!</p>

<p>I am often glad that I spent the first year of my antipodean
life in New South Wales, for now many things which I should not
have observed had I arrived here in the first instance, are sources
of great delight to me, as being so much more English than in the
larger colony, and I could fancy myself some degrees nearer
home.</p>

<p>In the Tasmanian gardens are mulberries, cherries, currants,
raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, apples, pears, quinces,
medlars, plums of all kinds, and peaches in abundance, growing well
and luxuriantly. Our forest trees, too, thrive admirably here, and
walnuts, filberts, and hazelnuts are becoming much more common.
Vines also succeed in sheltered aspects, but not better than in
many parts of England; the summer-frosts to which this climate is
liable frequently cut off plants which in Britain can be grown with
certainty. Even potatoes are, in some districts, considered a very
precarious crop from this circumstance, and, except in situations
near the sea-shore, are often nipped by the frosts at night,
although the weather in the day-time is as warm as in an English
June.</p>

<p>The Government Gardens here, although not comparable with those
at Sydney, are finely situated on the sloping shore of the Derwent,
and charmed me by their verdant and shady aspect. They are&mdash;for I
must again repeat my oft-used term of praise&mdash;they are
<i>English</i>-looking gardens, not rich in glowing oranges,
scarlet pomegranates, and golden loquats, nor stored with the rare
and gorgeous blossoms of India, but full of sweet homely faces and
perfumes. Great trees of a lovely blush rose were in full bloom at
the time of my visit, looking so like the rose-trees of olden days
at home, that I could scarcely believe them the growth of the
opposite side of the world.</p>

<p>The domain adjoins the gardens, and is laid out in pleasant
drives among the groves of native trees. We witnessed there the
ceremony of laying the first stone of a new Government House, on a
spot commanding views of the Derwent and the surrounding beautiful
scenery. A collation was provided on the occasion by the
Lieutenant-Governor and Lady Franklin, in a pretty rustic lodge
near the site of the new mansion, and some of the guests availed
themselves of the presence of an excellent military band to have
quadrilles on the grass, or rather in the dust, for the turf was
something of the scantiest.</p>

<p>At the period of which I am writing, Hobarton was certainly not
in advance of Sydney in point of society or intelligence, and the
constant efforts of Sir John and Lady Franklin to arouse and foster
a taste for science, literature, or art, were more often productive
of annoyance to themselves, than of benefit to the unambitious
multitude. The coarse and unmanly attacks made in some of the
public papers on Lady Franklin, whose kindness and ability, even if
not appreciated at their full value, ought at least to have met
with gratitude and respect, were most disgraceful. Unhappily the
perpetual petty squabbles and quarrels which seem to form an
indispensable part of all small communities, and were especially
rife in this little fraction of a world, occupied its attention too
exclusively to admit of any great interest being felt in subjects
not immediately connected with individual success or advantage.
That there might always be found exceptions to this rule is most
true, but their good influence, like the light of a few stars in a
clouded sky, only served to make the surrounding intellectual gloom
more apparent. Among the young ladies, both married and single, in
Tasmania, as in Sydney, a very "general one-ness" prevails as to
the taste for dancing, from the love of which but a small share of
regard can be spared for any other accomplishment or study, save a
little singing and music; and Lady Franklin's attempts to introduce
evening parties in the "conversazione" style were highly unpopular
with the pretty Tasmanians, who declared that they "had no idea of
being asked to an evening party, and then stuck up in rooms full of
pictures and books, and shells and stones, and other rubbish, with
nothing to do but to hear people talk lectures, or else sit as mute
as mice listening to what was called good music. Why could not Lady
Franklin have the military band in, and the carpets out, and give
dances, instead of such stupid preaching about philosophy and
science, and a parcel of stuff that nobody could understand?"</p>

<p>The performances at the neat little theatre in Hobarton are of a
better order than the colonies can generally boast, and most
romantic and heart-stirring are the titles of the melodramatic
pieces usually represented there. I often regretted our distance
from town when I saw such announcements as "The Maid of Genoa, or
The Bandit Merchant, with the celebrated Broad-sword Combat and
Highland Fling <i>in the Second Act</i>;"&mdash;the introduction of
apparent anomalies being made much on the pump-and-tub principle of
the immortal Crummles. Sometimes half a page of a colonial paper is
filled with startling hints of each scene, plentifully peppered
with stars, dashes, notes of exclamation, and gigantic italics,
quite distracting to read in a quiet country home, amidst peaceful
woods; and to know the while, that people in town may go and "sup
full of horrors" with "The Convict Captain, or the Nun of
Messina;"&mdash;have their very heartstrings lacerated by "The Broken
Dagger, or the Dumb Boy of the Pyrenees;"&mdash;and sit in petrified and
agonizing terror to behold the woes of the "The Bandit's Victim, or
the Black Caverns of St. Bruno!"</p>

<p>Perhaps it is scarcely fair to send forth such agitating
advertisements into far away nooks of the forest, where their
temptations are all unavailing. But wonderful is the serenity with
which repeated disappointment enables the mind to endure even such
privations! Recently one or two of Shakespeare's tragedies and some
good modem plays have been got up very respectably, and last year
the announcement of a pantomime sounded cheerily in our ears, like
a faint echo of our childhood's laughter; but we afterwards found
that its subject was wholly made up of local and personal
allusions. The superior success of melodramas over the higher order
of dramatic representations, affords an evidence as to public taste
which needs no comment. The frightful amount of <i>snobbishness</i>
which prevails here among those who might really well dispense with
the feverish terror of being said or thought to do anything
"ungenteel" or "unfashionable," is adverse to the interests of the
theatre; and accordingly the patronage vouchsafed by the alarmed
exclusives is lamentably small.</p>

<p>As balls must infallibly be popular in a place where everybody
dances, so must races claim a large share of patronage where
everybody rides, or is in some manner interested in the quality and
value of horses; and accordingly Hobarton, Launceston,
Campbelltown, Oatlands, and other places in the colony, have their
annual meetings, where "cups," "ladies' purses," "town plates,"
"sweepstakes," and such like exciting prizes, are gallantly striven
for, and fairly won, often by gentlemen-riders, and horses worthy
of them.</p>

<p>Hunting is also a favourite diversion, and occasionally the
newspapers put forth most grandiloquent narratives purporting to be
communications from "correspondents," detailing the exploits of the
"field," which usually consist of galloping over a rough country
after two or three couple of hounds (a kind of "scratch pack"),
which drive before them a poor tame deer, one of the few imported
into the colony, and placed at the disposal of the hunt, by owners
more liberal than humane. When the poor creature is completely
exhausted, it is rescued from the hounds for future torments, and
again and again chased to the very verge of existence, by the noble
and Christian worthies who enjoy the cruel sport. Perhaps I may be
told that deeds quite as cruel are considered "sport" at home, and
encouraged by the highest sanction; but that does not in the least
convince me that all the bad habits of an old country should be
scrupulously transplanted to a new one, whilst so many of the good
ones remain forgotten; and assuredly the absurd custom of
<i>hunting</i>, with all the show and pretence of earnest pursuit,
a gentle tame creature that can scarcely be <i>driven</i> away,
would be "more honoured in the breach than the observance."</p>

<p>One of these cruel exhibitions occurred only a week before our
arrival, as I am informed by a person who shared the "sport" with
about sixty others. which ended in the poor tame stag being worried
to death by the dogs, its antlers haying caught in a low tree, and
entangled it: knowing that its longer life would but have led to
greater sufferings, I rejoice that it was killed.</p>

<p>A kangaroo is sometimes hunted as a substitute for the old
country fox, and, being a wild and swift creature, is said to
afford excellent sport.</p>

<p>The dingo of New South Wales, so generally hunted there, is, I
rejoice to say, wholly unknown in Tasmania.</p>

<p>Public balls, concerts, regattas, and horticultural shows, are
also frequent, and attended fully, and most respectably. I know of
no place where greater order and decorum is observed by the motley
crowds assembled on any public occasion than in this most
shamefully slandered colony: not even in an English country village
can a lady walk alone with less fear of harm or insult than in this
capital of Van Diemen's Land, commonly believed at home to be a
moral pest-house, where every crime that can disgrace and degrade
humanity stalks abroad with unblushing front.</p>

<p>The unfounded assertions which have been made and believed in
England for some years respecting the moral and social condition of
this colony, are most astonishing: how, why, and from whom they
have originated, I am at a loss to conjecture; but that they are,
for the most part, cruelly, scandalously false, I know.</p>

<p>Not in the most moral circles of moral England herself is a
departure from the paths of propriety or virtue more determinedly
or universally visited by the punishment of exclusion from society,
than in this "Penal Colony;" nowhere are all particulars and
incidents of persons' past lives more minutely and rigidly
canvassed, than in the "higher circles" of this little community;
and nowhere are the decent and becoming observances of social and
domestic life more strictly maintained. One fact, familiar to
hundreds here, may well illustrate this assertion. I select this
particular instance, because the parties have now left the colony,
and whilst in it occupied a prominent station. A lady, the wife of
a military officer of high rank, had for some years held that place
in society to which her husband's influential position, and her own
right as a gentlewoman, entitled her. She was visited and courted,
and might select her own associates from the best families here,
until, one unlucky day, there came to the colony a person who
professed to be intimately acquainted with this lady's "birth,
parentage, and education," and somewhat officiously proceeded to
set forth in various companies a narrative of some long-past error
of her early youth; whether false or true, no one paused to
ascertain, nor to ask themselves who, amongst them all, could, if
similarly attacked, withstand such (possibly) unfounded assertions.
Her correct and unblemished conduct during her sojourn here availed
nothing; but one and all of her former devoted friends fell away,
and refused to hold any further communion with her. Is it possible
to believe that this could have been the case, were moral feeling
in Van Diemen's Land at the low ebb generally represented?</p>

<p>A residence here for the last nine years, and an intimate
acquaintance during that time with the habits and usages of the
higher and middle ranks, as well as of the free labouring
population of the country places, may, I think, in some measure
qualify me to judge how far the sweeping condemnations of the few,
are borne out by the demeanour of the many; and now, in all honest
faith and truth, I declare them to be every whit as unjust to the
people of Tasmania as they would be if cast upon those of the same
rank in England. And as, in days of yore, the doughty champion of
slandered virtue flung into the lists his mailed gauntlet, or the
glorious Bombastes hung aloft his invincible boots, even so, in
these modern days of more wordy, but not less mortal strife, do I
gently lay down my black silk mitten in the cause of fair and
wronged Tasmania!</p>

<p>Nor will I quit the subject thus entered upon, without a few
words on behalf of those whose friends are too few in number to
allow the silence of one willing voice, however feeble, when aught
<i>can</i> be said for them. I allude to the numerous prisoners of
the Crown, now forming so large a portion of our population, and
respecting whom so much discussion has of late arisen, and so
little truth been elicited. It was not my purpose to touch upon
this matter so early in these pages, because at the time of which I
am writing, I had not had the opportunities of forming an opinion
which I have since had; but having alluded to the subject, it is
perhaps best to anticipate the lapse of time so far, and briefly
glance over the general question.</p>

<p>The transportation of British criminals to Van Diemen's Land
was, as is well known, continued for many years (and until 1842)
under the "assignment system;" the prisoners brought in each ship
being "assignable" to private service as soon as they arrived. The
greater portion of them, therefore, were immediately removed and
distributed among different masters in distant places, and with
small probability that they would again be brought in contact with
their former partners in crime&mdash;thus effecting at once the first
great step towards reformation, in the breaking up of old and evil
connections and associations. The majority became speedily engaged
in various ways, chiefly in pastoral or agricultural pursuits, or
clearing land; nearly all their fellow-labourers being persons of a
like class, but in whom at least a partial improvement had already
taken place; and with these they too went on, labouring in
occupations or trades they did understand, or learning those they
did not. They had huts to live in (which were so far superior to
the wretched cabins of many labourers at home that they kept out
wind and rain), as much fuel as they chose to cut for themselves,
abundant rations of good and wholesome food, and a certain
allowance of clothing, boots, and bedding, fixed by Government.</p>

<p>After serving thus for three, four, or five years, according to
the length of their original sentence, they were, if well-conducted
and recommended, allowed a "ticket-of-leave," which enabled them to
quit their first master, if so disposed, and hire themselves for
wages to any one else in the colony who was eligible as an employer
of convicts; the police magistrate of the district granting them a
"pass" or certificate of permission to proceed to any other
specified place. This stage of their punishment appears to have
been attended with great success, restoring to them, as a reward
for past amendment, enough of independence to arouse their feeling
of self-respect and encourage them to continue improving, whilst it
reserved power in the hands of the authorities for future rewards
or punishments. So manifest are the advantages of this part of the
system, that the settlers prefer ticket-of-leave men as servants to
any other class, and if the periods of their being such were
allowed to arrive sooner and be of longer duration, the change
would in most cases benefit the men materially, aad tend, by
habituating them to the good conduct they then practise, to render
more safe and certain their ultimate reformation.</p>

<p>After remaining the allotted number of years in the
ticket-of-leave class, the deserving convicts usually received a
"conditional pardon," which permitted them the range of the
Australian colonies; and to some was granted a "free pardon," which
generally found them fully prepared to keep and value the liberty
it bestowed.</p>

<p>To this system it has of late been fashionable to attach the
term "white slavery," and other opprobrious epithets. Although
doubtless susceptible of great improvement, (as what human scheme
is not?) the results were in the main highly satisfactory, and
precisely what the Home Government and all humane persons desired
they should be, namely, the conversion, in five cases out of six,
of idle unprincipled outcasts into industrious trustworthy
servants, and the redemption of thousands, who (not strong enough
in good to resist evil entirely, yet with the better impulses of
their nature far over-balancing the worse) would, if they had
remained at home, after a first offence, have been reduced in their
degradation to suffer the contagious influence of spirits more
wicked than themselves, and so have sunk gradually but surely
downwards to the lowest depths of vice. Here, removed from the
first crushing grief of disgrace, and seeing before them the
prospect of rising again, and of building for themselves a new
character above the ruins of the old, all the latent good in them
springs into action; and, in very many instances, a life of honest
industry and an old age of decent comfort have succeeded a youth of
vice and crime.</p>

<p>For this system to produce its full amount of good in the men,
there must needs be the requisite qualifications of common sense,
probity, and humanity in the masters; and to ascertain and decide
who are and who are not really eligible as such, requires greater
diligence and more impartiality than Government agents are often
found to possess. Bad masters and severe dishonest magistrates have
devoted more men to live as bushrangers, and to die on the
scaffold, than any inherent depravity of their victims. When the
choice of persons to fill the solemn and responsible offices of
justices of the peace was guided, as it <i>was</i> here, not by
worth, fitness, or respectability, but by their very reverse&mdash;when
servility became the requisite qualification for the man who should
be pleasing to a governor&mdash;wretched indeed was the prospect of the
unfortunate prisoner dragged before such a magistrate, and little
indeed had <i>justice</i> to do with the proceedings, which wholly
depended on the venal character of the man's master, not of
himself. If his master was a useful tool of the governor, he might
fix the precise punishment he chose to have inflicted; if, on the
other hand, he was an honest unpurchaseable person, his servant,
however guilty, was either dismissed unpunished, or removed from
his service. Such things, and worse than these, were of daily
occurrence, but are happily now far less frequent; and I believe
the lingering remnants which are still found only need exposure to
insure removal.</p>

<p>In 1842 the old method of "assignment" was replaced by the
"probation system;" and the prisoners, instead of being taken into
private service direct from the ship, were subjected to a
probationary period of (supposed) hard labour and instruction,
which appears to have been <i>intended</i> by the Home Government
to advance their reformation, to render them more useful afterwards
as servants, and to benefit the colony meanwhile by the great
amount of labour available for the execution of public works. These
were good intentions, but the officers appointed to carry them out
failed signally in their task; some from determined perversity and
unpopularity, some from inability, and more from distaste and
inattention: and then the herding together of hundreds of criminals
of all classes and grades in notorious idleness, made those who
were really bad tenfold worse&mdash;and even men naturally willing and
diligent lapsed into apathetic drones; so that, when they became
eligible for service, they were found far less useful and promising
than those used to be who were assigned direct from the ships.</p>

<p>To all persons connected with the colony, this will appear an
useless repetition of things as familiar as one's alphabet; but I
do not write for colonial readers&mdash;I can tell <i>them</i> nothing
that they may not equally well discover for themselves, if disposed
to take the pains. I write to communicate such information to
general readers in England as I believe many are deficient in, and,
not being ambitious of seeming learned myself, would rather repeat
many things that everybody knows, than omit one which some require
to learn. I wish to convey to others the veritable impressions made
on my own mind by the condition and character of the convict
population here, and I could not do so intelligibly without some
slight sketch of their general position.</p>

<p>I have now lived above nine years in the colony, the wife of a
"settler," and the mistress of a "settler's" home, and during that
time we have been served by prisoners of all grades, as ploughmen,
shepherds, shearers, reapers, butchers, gardeners, carpenters,
masons, blacksmiths, shoemakers, house-servants, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
and (with one or two exceptions) served as well and faithfully as
we could desire. What more could be said by any farmer's wife at
home? Are all English labourers blameless? I can only call to mind
one instance of known dishonesty among our many men-servants (that
of a groom who stole some wine), and I believe that acts of petty
theft are far less common among them than among the generality of
servants at home. Many persons here could and would, if required,
give the same evidence which I now do; but I prefer adducing a few
facts from my own knowledge, as proof that transportation to these
colonies <i>is</i>&mdash;always excepting the probation
system&mdash;productive of reformation to many who otherwise would, in
all probability, have been utterly lost.</p>

<p>Five, ten, and fifteen years are common periods for
prisoner-servants to remain in the same service, before and after
their conditional pardon; and I lately heard of one who has for
<i>twenty-eight</i> years lived with another master in a situation
of great trust.</p>

<p>My husband's father, Mr. George Meredith, and himself, have now
on their estates five old servants, four of whom have been in their
family since 1826, and one since 1825, the latter being until
lately overseer on a large agricultural farm. One of the four
before-named was once an overseer for many years, and now rents a
farm and flock from my husband&mdash;his wife having joined him eighteen
or twenty years ago, with their family, now grown up and married;
the second was in like manner gradually promoted from one post to
another till he married, became a superintendent, and then a
tenant; the third, a good workman in an useful trade, has received
a free pardon, is now also a tenant of my father's, and working for
himself; and the fourth, after being employed, since he became
free, in whaling, sawing, splitting, and divers other avocations,
has, for the last eight years, been cook and "major domo" in our
own house, where his faithful attachment and incorruptible honesty
are appreciated as they deserve. At the very time I am writing, he
and a "ticket-of-leave" gardener are the only male persons in our
lonely house (Mr. Meredith being absent in town), and I feel no
more, perhaps even less, fear of attack or molestation, than I
should in the middle of London: firstly, because I have no idea
that robbers will come; and, secondly, because I know that, if they
did, I and my children would be defended to the uttermost by
<i>these very prisoner-servants</i>; and I think it must be very
evident, that the country cannot be the den of horrors it has of
late been painted, where a female only <i>so</i> protected can sit
in her quiet; country house, forty miles from the nearest village,
with doors and windows left open the whole day through, and sleep
safely and peacefully at night, without a bar or bolt or shutter to
a single window, every room being on the ground floor.</p>

<p>I have only particularised a <i>few</i> instances of long
service, but I could enumerate numbers of men who have lived in the
same family ten, fifteen, eighteen years, as trusted and respected
servants; some who have grown old and died on the same
establishment. Surely such distinct indisputable facts as these are
more worthy of credence, and a safer guide to the truth, than the
vague generalizing denunciations now so commonly dealt forth by the
slanderers of the colony. If I were to note all the corroborative
evidence that occurs to me, I should fill my little book with it;
in no place that I ever knew at home are houses and families left
so totally unprotected and in such perfect safety as here. In a
lone cottage, seven miles from our own, there lives, at this very
time, a lady, an educated gentlewoman, and her four young
children&mdash;the eldest only eleven&mdash;without even a man-servant in or
near the place, all being with their master on a distant farm: all
the neighbouring settlers have numerous prisoner-servants, yet she
lives undisturbed.</p>

<p>I will now quit this subject for the present, assured that if my
counter-statement has no other good effect, it will at least enable
my friends to journey on with me more pleasantly than if haunted by
those frightful anticipations for my personal safety which the
reports of the croakers must have awakened.</p>

<p>Our final destination was Great Swan Port, at the head of Oyster
Bay, on the east coast. We commenced our journey thither by a short
stage first crossing the Derwent in the ferry-boats, ourselves in
one, and our horses and vehicle in another. Colonial country roads
are not calculated for four-wheeled carriages; Mr. Meredith
therefore purchased in Hobarton a broad, stout, colonial-built
conveyance, an ingenious variety of the gig species, with a seat
behind for a servant, which seemed fully capable of enduring all
the trying exertions of the journey.</p>

<p>We drove from the ferry to Risdon (properly, I believe,
Restdown), a very lovely spot, and the residence of one of my
husband's oldest and most valued friends (T. G. Gregson, M.L.C.). I
had not seen so beautiful a view, since I left England, as that
commanded by the windows of his dining-room. Mount Wellington is
here, as in Hobarton, the chief object in the landscape, whilst the
broad bright Derwent, enlivened by sailing and steam-vessels, and
skirted by green slopes and meadow-like flats, adds greatly to the
beauty of the scene. The greater verdure of the forest trees in Van
Diemen's Land, than of those in New South Wales, here struck me
forcibly.</p>

<p>We lingered so pleasantly with our kind friends, that it was not
until the afternoon of the following day that we set forth to make
another short stage, and this was a very pleasant one, being for
the most part over a fine, newly-made Government road. From the
summit of Grass Tree Hill we had a most beautiful view of the town
and harbour, bright in the full radiance of the afternoon sun.</p>

<p>Great numbers of the singular "grass trees" <i>(Xanthorrea
arborea)</i>, of all ages and growths, short, tall, straight, and
crooked, each with its long tressed head of rushy leaves, gave a
peculiar character to the steep and rocky hills between which we
passed, and created an amusing variety in the otherwise monotonous
near scenery.</p>

<p>We proceeded to Richmond, a place named, I imagine, in true
Antipodean fashion, from its utter lack of all likeness to its
charming old-country namesake. It is a squarely-planned township,
situated in a flat valley, with a neat square-towered church and
square formal houses dispersed about its incomplete streets. A very
square many-windowed inn, seeming very new, very roomy, and very
empty, looked at us as we passed with as imploring an expression as
might be assumed by an inn of its great pretensions and stony
dignity; but fortunately we were not destined to test its
capabilities, having accepted the proffered hospitality of the then
police magistrate of Richmond, who, being a geologist and a
virtuoso, afforded us an agreeable evening in the examination of
his various collections. Many of the limestone fossils I saw here
were new to me, but as their possessor purposed forwarding a
characteristic collection either to the British Museum or the
Geological Society, the <i>savans</i> at home are doubtless
acquainted with them ere this.</p>

<p>Our friend's gatherings in the paths of science being somewhat
extensive, the room in which my maid slept was plentifully stored
with choice and rather bulky fossil specimens, and I had no easy
task, next morning, in striving to compose the feelings of the
terrified and indignant damsel, who declared she "had lain all
amongst skillintons and dead men's bones, as bad as vaultses under
churches." She had not observed the horrors over night, but was
quite positive they <i>were</i> "death's-heads and cross-bones,"
for she had had such "horrid odorous dreams." At length I succeeded
in calming her perturbation, and she resumed the charge of the
"young <i>Erkerluss</i>" (Hercules), as she termed my bouncing
baby.</p>

<p>On setting forth, our kind host directed us to proceed along a
new road, or rather track, for some distance, our beacon being "the
grand stand" On the racecourse, which was shortly to appear on our
left hand. As we drove on, I carefully looked about for at least a
humble imitation of the buildings usually erected for such
purposes&mdash;some neat little summer-house affair, perhaps, with a
white roof stuck aloft on white posts&mdash;but no such thing appeared.
At length, Mr. Meredith, from his knowledge of the country, was
convinced that our route would be wrong, if pursued further in the
direction we were then going; and on looking around again most
intently, we discovered a small post-and-rail <i>pen</i>, of common
split timber, neither smoothed nor painted, but bearing a tolerably
near resemblance to a temporary pigstye, and this was "The Grand
Stand!" I afterwards remembered having seen the one at Paramatta,
which, though far superior to this, was only calculated to hold
some half-dozen persons, and was framed in the same rough and
unpolished style.</p>

<p>The road now became quite colonial, that is, execrably bad, and
the scenery too monotonous to divert my attention for a moment from
the misery of the rough jolting we suffered, and from my cares lest
every shock should disturb or hurt my baby, whom I dared not trust
in the maid's arms for fear she might drop him out whilst saving
herself from one of the incessant jolts, which threatened fractures
and dislocations at every step.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we reached a solitary public-house, where we
purposed resting for an hour, but finding a large party of rather
riotous guests already in possession of its wretched little rooms,
we hastened on for a short distance, and paused on the next hill,
where the horses were tethered to graze, and we soon made a fire to
grill our cold meat and warm baby's food; and so, under the shade
of some sombre gum trees, had a pleasant pic-nic sort of repast,
far more to my taste than a sojourn in the unpromising dingy little
hostel we had left.</p>

<p>Here I was first initiated into the bush art of "sticker-up"
cookery, and for the benefit of all who "go a-gipsying" I will
expound the mystery. The orthodox material here is of course
kangaroo, a piece of which is divided nicely into cutlets two or
three inches broad and a third of an inch thick. The next requisite
is a straight clean stick, about four feet long, sharpened at both
ends. On the narrow part of this, for the space of a foot or more,
the cutlets are spitted at intervals, and on the end is placed a
piece of delicately rosy fat bacon. The strong end of the
stick-spit is now stuck fast and erect in the ground, close by the
fire, to leeward; care being taken that it does not burn. Then the
bacon on the summit of the spit, speedily softening in the genial
blaze, drops a lubricating shower of rich and savoury tears on the
leaner kangaroo cutlets below, which forthwith frizzle and steam
and sputter with as much ado as if they were illustrious Christmas
beef grilling in some London chop-house under the gratified nose of
the expectant consumer. "And gentlemen," as dear old Hardcastle
would have said, if he had dined with us in the bush, "to men that
are hungry, stuck-up kangaroo and bacon are very good eating."
Kangaroo is, in fact, very like hare.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, as our basket was town-packed, our
"sticker-up" consisted only of ham. The evening of this day we
reached Jerusalem, and, not having any friends in the holy city,
took up our quarters at one of the caravanserais, where we were as
little uncomfortable as we could expect to be in a place of such
limited accommodation. Jerusalem is a township of far less imposing
aspect than Richmond, and the neighbouring scenery is very
uninteresting.</p>

<p>The absurdity of giving to new little settlements like this the
names of old-world places of renown, always seems to me excessive.
Not far away from the new Jerusalem are Jericho and Bagdad; whilst
English town and country names abound, and the plain farmhouses of
settlers are often called after some of the most magnificent
palace-seats of English nobles, making the contrast, which cannot
fail to occur to one's mind, ludicrous in the extreme. I know only
three native names of places in this island&mdash;Bingarooma and
Boobyalla on the north coasts and Triabunna on the east. In New
South Wales many of the settlers have had the good sense and taste
to preserve the aboriginal names, which are always significant
(when understood), and for the most part singularly musical in
sound. Such are Paramatta, Wooloomooloo, Illawarra, Wollongong,
Wollondilly, Mittagong, Maneroo, Tuggeranong, Mutmutbilly,
Yangalara, and many more; whilst some few, it must be owned, are
more grotesque than euphonious, for instance, Jerriconoramwogwog,
Jininjininjininderry, and Jinjulluk. Yet even these are preferable
to the reiterated old names, and at any rate excite no ridiculous
comparison between great old things and little new ones.</p>

<p>Our onward road from Jerusalem was worse than any we had
hitherto traversed, being deep loose sand mingled with stones of
all sizes, and great masses of rock, over which we bumped and
jumped and jolted most perseveringly for some miles; the horses
being sufficiently tired in dragging us along at a slow foot-pace,
and through as uninteresting a tract of country as can well be
conceived. Forests of straggling dingy gum-trees
(<i>Eucalyptus</i>) were here and there mingled with an equally
dingy growth of wattle and honeysuckle-trees (<i>Acacia</i> and
<i>Banksia</i>); the ground bore very little herbage, but was
chiefly covered with coarse, harsh, reedy plants, some of which are
called "cutting grass," from the extremely sharp edges of the
leaves, which cut like glass; so sharp, indeed, that we have had
dogs severely hurt in running through them: other and more numerous
kinds are less mischievous.</p>

<p>A large tussock of this grass I have often found a very pleasant
resting-place, as, by bending sideways a portion of the upper
leaves, and seating oneself upon them, they form an elastic
cushion, well backed by the remaining upright leaves, and very
preferable to a seat on a log, which usually swarms with ants: it
is prudent to <i>poke</i> the tussock with a stick, before sitting
down on it, as snakes are not infrequently found coiled within.</p>

<p>On such a primitive kind of ottoman I very gladly rested awhile
at our usual mid-day halt in the forest, whilst the smoke of our
gypsy fire curled sluggishly upward in the still air, and the
horses eagerly rolled themselves in the damp marsh grass that
skirted the tiny spring which had made us fix upon this spot for
the halt of our little caravan.</p>

<p>Tall gaunt-looking gum-trees, with many straggling far-spreading
branches and scanty foliage, towered high above, with streamers of
loose bark hanging from all parts of them, sometimes five or more
yards long, and waving rustlingly to and fro. At least a fifth part
of the trees had either died of natural decay, or been blown down,
and lay in all directions; their massive trunks, broken branches,
and withered leaves, together with many years' accumulation of
fallen bark (which these trees shed annually) covering the earth,
and scarcely allowing the lesser plants to struggle up amongst
them. A few common shrubs grew here and there with pretty but
scanty blossoms; and, beside the precious little spring, a gleam of
real green brightened the dreary place, and the few poor reeds and
shrubs so fortunate as to dwell within its blessed influence, shot
up tall and lithe and verdant, amidst that dry, sapless,
lifeless-looking forest.</p>

<p>I was pleased to see some fern here, very similar to the common
forest-fern or brake at home; but, instead of growing tall and
spreading, it seemed Stunted and crisped with dronght, its
leaf-tips all brown and brittle, and the stems hard and
shrivelled.</p>

<p>We journeyed on through this seemingly endless region of
standing and prostrate gum-trees, frequently walking to spare our
poor child the motion of the carnage, and having continually, when
driving, to turn aside into the uncleared "bush," to travel round
some enormous tree which had fallen across the beaten track. How
little do the good people in England, whom I have heard grumble
outrageously at the sixpences extorted from them by the
turnpikes&mdash;how very little do they know the value of the roads they
so grudgingly help to maintain! If they could possibly enjoy, as we
did, the delight of making a journey of 120 miles upon one of these
free roads, I think turnpikes would ever after beam upon their
charmed eyes as the loveliest objects in the landscape, the ever
welcome tokens of level roads and easy drives, of Macadam and
civilization.</p>

<p>In the district around Hobarton, and on the direct route to
Launceston, the roads are reasonably good, and when the probation
system rendered the services of so many thousands of convicts
available to the local Government for the execution of works of
public utility, it was generally hoped that in time our colonial
highways would be considerably mended, but such expectation has
been signally disappointed. Gangs of many hundreds of men have been
located about the island in various places, but, as it would
appear, with the most careful determination on the part of their
directors that their labour should <i>not</i> be beneficial to the
colonists. Roads were begun, it is true, but generally in such
directions as were rarely traversed, and if one over a more
frequented part of the country was commenced and carried on
successfully for some time, the gangs were almost invariably
removed from it when a little further labour would have rendered it
essentially serviceable to the neighbourhood. I know positively of
more than one instance where a road between two districts was in
the course of formation, which, had it been carried through, would
have greatly enhanced the value of certain large properties; but
because the owners of these were obnoxious, upon political grounds,
to the officer then in charge of the convicts, the work was stopped
when within a short distance of the proposed terminus (a portion of
the road was left unfinished and wholly impassable), the prisoners'
barracks were dismantled and allowed to go to ruin, and the gang
removed to a distance, most probably to be kept in idleness; for,
as the officer had uncontrolled power, and rather a lengthy list of
private feuds, it became extremely difficult to plan a road, in any
quarter, which should not either directly or indirectly benefit
some of the objects of his undying and vindictive dislike; and
hence the very small amount of good effected by a very large amount
of power&mdash;hence the number of unfinished, almost useless roads and
expensive stations and barracks, built at the cost of the Home
Government, and left to go to ruin, all over the island&mdash;and hence
the unpopularity and ultimate failure of the probation system.</p>

<p>A common bush-road cleared of trees and stumps, the latter being
too frequently left in the ground, is, if on firm smooth soil, by
no means unpleasant, but where rocks intervene, or deep gullies, or
the broad stony ford of a river, or a low tract of bog or marshy
clay&mdash;which the least traffic in wet weather beats up into a
slippery tenacious batter-pudding consistency&mdash;these, in
consequence of no means being adopted for rendering them moderately
passable, become serious impediments, and with such obstacles our
colonial bush-roads are replete.</p>

<p>How some of the yawning "gullies" and rapines were passed on our
journey, is an enigma to me to this day; for sometimes their banks
were so precipitous, that I could with difficulty descend one side
and scramble up the other on foot. How the carriage was lowered
down and dragged up again, I cannot divine; but my husband and
brother, and the good horses, managed it in some mysterious way
amongst them, and regularly overtook me as I and my servant walked
on before with the child; who, after sleeping through the first
three days' easy stages with most exemplary and philosophical
indifference to the jolting, now began to intimate that his
patience was exhausted, and put in his protest against carriage
nursing most determinedly. Still, it was pleasant and comforting to
think that we <i>might</i> have been far more miserable! and, when
growing really weary, distressed, and vexed at our many petty
troubles, I used to silence my inward murmurs by the
query&mdash;<i>"Would you prefer going by sea?"</i> and instantly the
all-powerful charm of the dry land reconciled me to all present or
future annoyances that our journey might present.</p>

<p>Our resting-place, on the fourth evening of our slow and
tiresome pilgrimage, was the house of a settler at the "Eastern
Marshes," who, from being the only resident in the neighbourhood,
or for miles around, must have his well-known hospitality tried by
most of the travellers on this dreary route. Judging from the
number we met, these are, fortunately for him, not very numerous;
during two days we had only seen two shepherds and their dogs. Our
worthy host was an old acquaintance of Mr. Meredith's, and our
weary group received every attention and comfort he could possibly
provide us; and truly it is no small trial for a quiet little
household to be invaded at a moment's notice, or rather with no
notice at all, by a whole family party, hungry, thirsty, tired,
hot, cold, sick or sleepy, as the case may be, but always
troublesome to an incalculable extent, and turning the house upside
down to make up cradles for children, and "shakedowns" for
gentlemen, and causing, however reluctantly, multifarious orders to
go forth for hot water, cold water, towels, carpet-bags, blankets,
driving-boxes, mutton-chops, brandy, milk, slippers, boiled eggs,
dry wood, bread and butter, and tea, within half-an-hour driving
the bewildered serving-woman nearly beside herself, and making the
distracted master glad to escape to the stable to superintend the
arrangements for the quadrupedal part of the invading army.</p>

<p>Luckily our present kind entertainer was a bachelor, and
ourselves not very exacting guests. When there is a wife in the
case, I am always trebly grieved at occasioning such a domestic
disturbance, being tolerably well able to sympathize in her
sufferings, Yet it is not uncommon for such compulsory guests
(especially residents in towns), to lay the flattering unction to
their souls, that they confer the greatest imaginable favour on an
establishment, by turning it inside out; at the same time avowing
their conviction that "people in the country are <i>always</i> so
delighted to see <i>anybody</i>;" which is not exactly the correct
construction to put upon the almost universal spirit of kind
hospitality which prevails among settlers in the Bush, whether rich
or poor; the simplicity and regularity of their lives and
occupations rendering such interruptions far more serious than
people accustomed to lounge and idle away their days in town can
understand. How great a delight it is to welcome to the solitary
home in the wilderness, some old and valued friend, and to see the
well-known face mingle its silent tales of bygone years with all
the newer interests and affections of the present time, can only be
known when enjoyed! I believe, in truth, that to appreciate fully
and completely the blessings of happy homes, children, friends, and
books, a trial of lonely bush-life for a few years is
indispensable. Such partial solitude does the spirit good.</p>

<p>I really think that, after seeing the truly lonely houses which
we often find in these colonies, I should be puzzled to know where
a lonely house could be placed in England! I have in former days
seen what I then imagined such, and have read, with an admiring
conviction of its truth, my friend Mr. Hewitt's eloquent
description of "lone country houses" in general, and of some very
fearfully lone ones in particular; but I verily begin to disbelieve
the whole theory, and am almost prepared to assert that there is
not, and cannot be, a lone house in England, and that there is
nobody now living who ever lived in or saw such an one there!</p>

<p>Now this homestead on the Eastern Marshes might with some
semblance of truth be invested with the ghostly and robbery
qualifications of a "lonely house:" it stands all alone by itself,
on an extensive tract of low marsh land, which, even at the time of
our visit in November*, was all splashy with water, and alive with
unimaginable legions of frogs. Beyond the marsh, the forest land,
or, to use the settlers' universal term, the "Bush," commences, and
spreads away over miles and miles of inhospitable country used for
nothing but sheep-runs, usually called sheep-<i>walks</i> at home,
but in these young countries we are in such haste to "advance" and
"go ahead," that, among all other fast things, we must needs have
fast sheep, or talk of them as if they were fast, which does as
well. Mountains, hills, valleys, ravines&mdash;all are wild and
trackless as they were thousands of years ago, except where a rude
fence of brushwood indicates the boundary-line of different
properties, or the narrow thread of a sheep-path winds away amidst
the fallen trees and spreading reed-tussocks. No road passes by or
anywhere near the place, at least none that I could espy: those
travellers who go there, find their way by means of some occult
science like divination, appertaining, I presume, to the organ of
"Locality" in its most perfect development, but which I still
venerate in the blindest ignorance; for all forests here, and all
parts of them, are to me so exactly alike, that the power of
knowing which is the right way to turn round one of many thousand
similar trees seems, to my unpractised comprehension, to border on
the miraculous.</p>

<p>Leaving the Eastern Marshes the following morning, we again
pursued our way through the Bush, over as wretched roads as
heretofore, and by noon had reached the foot of the Sugarloaf
Mountain, a most formidable part of our journey.</p>

<p>A high and rugged mountain-tier wholly encompasses the fertile
district of Great Swan Port on the land side, rendering it
imperative upon us to scale it at some point; and, after much
deliberation and many inquiries as to what bridges were
broken&mdash;<i>such</i> bridges too! a Welsh pony would scarcely trust
them in their best days&mdash;and what gullies were altered by floods,
and what new fences now crossed old roads&mdash;whether such as could be
pulled down to pass through (the putting up again after passing,
being a point of honour with respectable travellers, who do as they
would be done by), and where certain slip-rails were to be found,
and where we must "look out for the bull-dog that was always
loose," and other pleasant little items of preliminary information
essential to be acquired;&mdash;after all was canvassed, the Sugarloaf
route was decided on as the best. My readers will be kind enough to
imagine, if they journey with me to the end, what the other routes
must be. There was an alternative proposed, of "taking the Thumbs
for it"&mdash;a part of the ridge with three hummocks called the "Three
Thumbs" being sometimes traversed instead of the Sugarloaf; but the
latter was finally preferred.</p>

<p>Here then, at the foot of the mountain, we first forded, and
then halted beside a beautiful picturesque stream, which, with the
whole scene, strongly reminded me of spots in North Wales, or on
the Wye above Rhaiddyr&mdash;dear old names! how pleasant it is to write
them once again, and how almost impossible to believe that thirteen
long years have passed over my head since I wrote about them first!
Huge rocks here and there interrupted the course of the bright
little river, round which it gurgled and foamed in true
trout-stream style; shrubs and trees hung over and dipped into its
clear dark shady pools, that reflected in dancing pictures the high
and frowning mountain-peaks around; exquisite flowering plants, one
a tree-veronica with bright polished foliage, and a profusion of
lovely sprays of ultra-marine eye blossoms, grew close beside us,
as we spread our repast on the broad flat mossy stones, and with
our wine cooling in the river, and our little cups brimfull of the
crystal water, we were fast growing luxurious in our notions, when,
as if to realize more fully my Welsh mountain reminiscences, a
cloud, which I had once or twice glanced at somewhat suspiciously,
poured down upon us in a veritable mountain-shower; but it soon
passed over, and the sun shone out brightly, making all the little
twinkling diamond drops in the flowers glitter and dance as if in
enjoyment of our temporary discomfiture.</p>

<p>Luncheon being finished, and knives, forks, cups, and "table
service" packed up, I set off, as usual, in advance, with the child
and nurse, to climb the mountain on foot; the road being too
distinct to be mistaken even by so obtuse a bush-traveller as
myself. We plodded on and on, sometimes pausing to listen for the
horses or carriage behind, and then hastening on again, to walk as
far as possible before it overtook us, in mercy both to the poor
horses and to the child. A most fearful ravine soon yawned before
my feet, far deeper and steeper and wider than any yet passed, and
with only a crazy bridge of long thin poles thrown across and
turfed over. Many of the poles were broken, and most of the turf
fallen away, so that it was little more than a net-work of holes;
even I could not step lightly and quickly over without risk and
fear, and I paused some minutes on the edge, hoping the carriage
party would come, that I might know if they attempted to cross, and
whether this seeming impossibility would be accomplished, as so
many others had been; but hearing nothing approach, we again
proceeded on the steepest part of the ascent. Here the road winds
to and fro along the ridge of the mountain, and most unaccountably
passes nearly over its peak, much in the same style as Major
Mitchell's Blue Mountain track. A wide extent of hills and vales,
or rather ravines, spread far around and beneath, all robed in
dim-hued forests, which in the distance looked brown and rusty, and
the nearer portions only displayed the skeleton forms of the
universal gum-trees in a more gaunt and unpleasing aspect&mdash;so gaunt
and grim and gnarled were they, with such vicious twists and
doublings in their gray-white trunks&mdash;such misshapen caricatures of
arms and legs scrambling all abroad; such odd little holes and
clefts, making squinting eyes and gaping mouths in elvish faces,
with scratchy scrubby-looking wigs of dry leaves; and they had
altogether so disreputable and uncanny an aspect, that if they had
incontinently joined over my head in a Walpurgis dancing party, it
would only have seemed a natural and suitable proceeding.</p>

<p>Here and there portions of the rocky cliffs that overhung the
road assumed strange and picturesque forms, sometimes draped with
creeping plants, or clasped around in a rugged embrace by
long-armed forest tree roots, knotted over them like mighty cables.
I was growing very weary, and the utterly helpless loneliness of
the situation I had so indefatigably walked into, began to impress
me with no very cheerful feelings, for there was no human being
within call, save my frightened maid, to have offered us
assistance, had any of the bushrangers, then said to be numerous in
the colony, chanced to pounce upon us. Even the worst of these
desperadoes are, however, generally respectful and humane towards
females. Nevertheless, I grew "horribly afeard," and my efforts to
assume an air of courageous indifference were, I have no doubt,
most grim and lamentable failures. To return, at all events, would
have been useless folly, and to stand still nearly as bad; so on we
climbed, still up, up, up, along that ever-turning and, as it
seemed, never-ending ascent, and it was not until we had got close
to the brow of the mountain that Mr. Meredith and the "caravan"
reached us.</p>

<p>A rest on the summit was as needful for the poor horses as it
was welcome to me, and a cup of sparkling water from a spring close
by was deliciously cool and refreshing to my parched lips as I sat
panting "on a log."</p>

<p>And now began the worst part of the day's journey; having with a
world of trouble succeeded in getting to the top of the hill,
naturally the next thing to be done was to get to the bottom again.
We young-country folks never adopt your mean middle courses, or go
sneaking round a hill half way down; if a thing is to be done, we
do it manfully, in the most difficult possible manner, and if
people <i>must</i> go over mountain-tiers, why of course they like
to make much of the treat, and go as high up as they can! At least
such seems to he the principle on which all mountain-roads are laid
out in this country.</p>

<p>The road by which we had ascended was a "made" one, and
tolerably good; but from the opposite side the pioneers of the
wilderness seemed to have shrunk aghast, and left their task in
sheer despair. The descent, as I viewed it, seemed all but
perpendicular. I know that people skilled in theories and
calculations say that an angle of 75 is the steepest ascent that a
man can walk up; but as no one that I know of has ascertained the
precise degree of slope for bodies to roll down, I cannot in this
instance recognise the rule. Certain it is, that our descent of the
hill-Sugarloaf might be likened to that of flies creeping down a
real one, and the whole broadside of the mountain being thickly
strewn with loose sharp stones, was rendered doubly dangerous to
traverse. My year's inactivity in New South Wales had spoiled my
good old English habits of walking, and I was too much exhausted to
crawl further on foot, so I was compelled to cling to the
carriage&mdash;I cannot say I sat in it, but crouched on the foot-rug,
clasping baby in one arm, whilst I held tightly on with the other,
not daring to glance before me at the abyss below. A strong rope
was fastened to the back of the vehicle, to which our stalwart
brother lent all his weight and strength in holding the carriage
back; my maid meanwhile led his horse (much as Mr. Winkle might
have done), at the imminent peril of her own toes; and so, with
infinite terror and no disaster, we arrived safely at the bottom.
Many times in the course of the journey we had recourse to ropes
held in the same manner on either side to prevent an upset, for the
"sidelong" hills in the bush roads not being cut or terraced to
form levels, the slope is often too great for a vehicle to traverse
without great risk of overbalancing.</p>

<p>During this memorable descent of the Sugarloaf, my attention was
called to the beautiful view which at one point appeared over the
sombre forest foreground. This was a lovely glimpse of the Pacific
Ocean, calm and sunny, with the bold precipitous cliffs of Maria
Island rising grandly in the distance, and the more varied outline
of the Schoutens stretching away to the north. Beautiful as it was,
and long as I could, under other circumstances, have gazed upon it,
I felt, and I fear somewhat ungraciously declared, that the sight
of a single chimney of our father's residence&mdash;the so desired haven
whither we were hound&mdash;would have seemed lovelier in my weary eyes
at that moment than the most exquisite scenery that mountains and
ocean ever composed.</p>

<p>Our day's progress, though occupying from eight in the morning
till five in the evening, did not exceed eighteen miles, and ended
at a small puhlic-house at Little Swan Port, where a room, not
unlike a ship's cabin in size, served us perforce as dining-parlour
and dormitory, our brother and the maid being accommodated for the
night, one in a loft, and the other on a settee in the landlady's
little kitchen.</p>

<p>The clever bed which Goldsmith celebrates as contriving</p>

<p class="poem">"A doable debt to pay,<br>
A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day,"</p>

<p>had a perfect sinecure compared with the little oblong table of
our miniature apartment, which, after officiating first in the
menial capacity of a wash-hand-stand, and then as a toilet, was
enabled, by the aid of a clean white cloth, to figure as a
remarkably compact dining-table for three&mdash;the bed, in the
character of a sideboard, sharing its somewhat crowded honours;
and, after well sustaining the dignity of a "festal board," this
accommodating piece of furniture once more subsided into a toilet
and wash-hand-stand, previously to its being finally "made up" for
the night with cloaks and shawls as a bed for the baby!</p>

<p>The landlord of our inn had been many years in the
neighbourhood, and narrowly escaped being one of the victims in the
first murderous attack made here by the aborigines on the settlers;
but more of this anon. Both he and his wife had long known our
family, and were most attentive and obliging. The good woman
persisted in loading our little table with plate after plate,
heaped up with every description of eatable she could cook,
declaring, in spite of all my remonstrances, that she knew we must
be <i>famished</i>:&mdash;toast, mutton-chops, eggs, and fried ham
followed each other in quick succession, in company with a mighty
teapot steaming and fragrant, and a comely mountain of home-baked
bread, with English bottled ale and other anti-teetotal beverages.
Our repast was, as usual on such occasions, a conglomeration of
dinner, tea, and supper, and in this instance comprised a display
of enough food for at least three sets of such meals.</p>

<p>On taking an out-of-doors survey of our quarters the following
morning, I found that the cottage was built in a somewhat singular
fashion, a portion of it being continued over a sudden slope in the
bank, at the same level as the other parts, and merely supported on
thick, rough, upright posts, giving the whole building the
appearance of leaning on its elbows to look into the river below.
It was also old enough to have acquired a nice mellow colour, with
patches of moss and creeping plants about it; and some gay bits of
curtain, or an old gown, that fluttered at the casement window,
helped out the picturesque so well, that the group of sturdy rosy
children beside it made up a sort of living "Gainsborough," quite
refreshing to contemplate. A garden, not very neatly kept, but
apparently tolerably productive, lay between the cottage and the
river, or rather estuary, little Swan Port being a considerable
inlet of Oyster Bay.</p>

<p>Passing this by a wide but not very deep ford, we commenced the
last chapter of our pilgrimage, which the execrable roads and the
impossibility of exceeding a very moderate pace with our
baby-traveller, had rendered very wearisome.</p>

<p>After we had gained the sea-coast, along which our course now
lay, the scenery became most beautiful and striking; and, after
skirting the lower portions of the seaward hills for some distance,
we gradually ascended a kind of terrace road, very rudely formed
along the side of the almost precipitous chain, correctly named
"The Rocky Hills." From this place we enjoyed a magnificent view;
behind and in front of us appeared the winding mountain road&mdash;bad
enough to traverse, Heaven knows&mdash;but very charming to look at,
just the scene for a fine group of melodramatic bandits in ambush
behind a rock, or for a string of muleteers, or a band of chamois
hunters, or Alpine herdswomen, or any other figures appropriate to
a wild rocky mountain pass. High overhead the common forest trees
grew in their wonted straggling and fantastic forms; the rocks
around us were adorned by luxuriant bushes of a delicate and
fragrant wild geranium, with small finely-veined flowers of pale
lilac, and large downy leaves, contrasted here and there with the
broad-eyed white and yellow everlastings, in their powdery woolly
foliage. Over many of the flat rocks were spread large juicy-green
mats of the pretty fig-marigold <i>(Mesembryanthemum
equilaterale)</i>, and in some places long pendent masses of the
same plant hung down, curtaining the rugged cliffs in rich living
draperies, and shading many a cool little grotto-nook with their
heavy solid verdure, and its glorious broidery of bright, glowing,
purple, starry flowers, each with its inner sun of pale gold.</p>

<p>Far below our narrow track the surf dashed against the cliffs,
its continuous roar reaching us in a hollow murmur, and the bright
waters of Oyster Bay, blue as the sky above them, spread forth in
the most perfect bay-form I have ever seen. The lofty Schouten
promontory, with its long range of craggy granite peaks, and the
Schouten Island, equally picturesque, stretching away southwards
from the point of the mainland, form the limits of the bay opposite
to the Rocky Hills, whilst round the head of this silvery blue
dainty nook of ocean lies a fine tract of low land (the estate of
Cambria), with densely-wooded tiers of hills rising behind.
Southward of the Schoutens the small island called the White Rock,
or more generally in maps, "Isle des Phoques," rises abruptly from
the sea.</p>

<p>It is not more than a mile and a half in circumference, and was
formerly the resort of a great number of seals, which have been
almost wholly destroyed; and now the only residents there are the
prodigious multitudes of sea-fowl of all descriptions, which
inhabit the crags and clefts and strange intricate caverns of this
wild and almost inaccessible rock, which rises perpendicularly from
the water, and as the waves rise and fall from twenty to thirty
feet, the only mode of access for persons visiting it is to leap
from the boat when at the top of a swell and, lighting barefooted
on the slippery rocks, scramble up them&mdash;a favourite amusement with
my husband some few years ago; and I delight now to hear his vivid
descriptions of the nights he has sometimes passed there, watching
the seals come in from the sea to suckle their young, listening to
the conversation of the "old wigs," as the males are termed, or
witnessing their fearful engagements&mdash;for they fight tremendously,
tearing each other in the most savage manner, till the thick, fat,
blubbery skin hangs about them in absolute tatters. At sunset, too,
and all night long, the sea-birds come flocking home, uttering
their ceaseless cries, and seeking their respective holes and nests
with a noisy, bustling, fearless hurry-skurry, not heeding in the
least the presence of strangers, but flying against them, or
running under their legs. And through the night strange wild sounds
are heard&mdash;the deep bark of the seals; the screams, cries, and soft
musical tones of the birds; the moaning of the wind; and hollow
booming and dashing of the sea against the rock, and in and through
and all amongst its labyrinthine caves and grottoes, that nothing
but a wave or a fish ever penetrated.</p>

<p>Farther to the south is Maria Island, chiefly composed of high
cliffs and rocks, which rise at the northern extremity in a nearly
perpendicular precipice, called the Bishop and Clerks, of about
1800 feet; the rock is a dark close limestone, and extremely rich
in large fossil shells.</p>

<p>Long and weary was our progress over the terrible "Rocky Hills;"
for, lovely as was the view around, it could not charm away my
almost painful sensations of fatigue, as I stumbled along among the
sharp stones and rocks and fallen trees, for to sit in the carriage
was even worse, adding an agony of fright to the rough motion. I
have often laughed since to think what a deplorable figure we must
have cut; but at the time it was a grave affair enough. Mr.
Meredith led the van, piloting the carriage as he best might among
the innumerable obstacles that beset it; then came poor little baby
George, in the careful arms of his stout uncle, whose horse I led
the while; and the maid brought up the rear. In about the worst
part of the road we met the wife of a neighbouring settler, calmly
seated on a fine old white horse, guiding it steadily over the
path, and carrying at the same time an infant, about the age of my
own, tucked snugly under one arm, and a sturdy little fellow about
a year older on her lap, besides numerous bundles hanging to the
pommel. I gazed at her with almost envious admiration and wonder as
she rode quietly on, quite composed and at ease, whilst I, with
thrice the apparent accommodation, was nigh fainting with
fatigue.</p>

<p>At one part of the road we found a gang of men employed in its
improvement; forming, in the mean time, greater obstacles than they
removed; and so they have continued to be employed, aided by
frequent reinforcements of new arrivals, nearly ever since; and
still, after nearly nine years, the comparatively trifling task
remains unfinished, and the Station is deserted. The mismanagement
of this gang was evident to the most casual observer; so notorious
was their idleness, that it was a common thing to see them not even
pretending to be employed, unless in making arbours of boughs to
sit under in the sun! A more sleek-looking, stout, sturdy, lazy
fraternity, I cannot conceive possible. This herding together of so
many idle men under the pretence of "doing probation," as they call
it, must be injurious to the well-disposed among them, and is no
punishment to the worthless.</p>

<p>We continued to enjoy the same view of the fine bay, and the
opposite mountains, only altered slightly by our change of position
as we advanced, losing it occasionally as our road led over the
inland ridges of the many jutting points, and regaining it as we
returned towards the sea. On one fine sandy beach, where we rested
awhile, quantities of huge whales bones lay scattered about; they
were as white as snow, from long exposure to the sun and air. The
large joints of the vertebrae make very shapely rustic seats and
footstools, when the greasy matter has all passed away from them. I
rested on one during our halt, and, as I looked around, could not
help fancying what treasures those despised bones would be in many
a fantastic <i>Londonesque</i> garden, amidst its rock-work, vases,
statues, and flower-pots.</p>

<p>We had now passed all the very bad portions of the road and,
after traversing in tolerable comfort a few more rugged hills, came
in view of the little settlement of Swansea, more commonly known in
the district as "Waterloo Point," that being the name originally
given to it; the first stipendiary magistrate here, Captain
Hibbert, 40th Regiment, having served at Waterloo.</p>

<p>The little rocky promontory jutting out into the sea, surmounted
by the flagstaff and a few whitewashed buildings, including the
gaol, police office, and magistrate's cottage, looks at a distance
like a small fort; and some mock embrasures, painted on the white
walls, have also, when seen from a distance, a right martial
aspect. The church, originally built for a school-room, remained
for some years a rough unfinished apartment, fitted up with
benches, but within the last three years it has been raised in
height and handsomely finished. The houses of three publicans and
one or two stores were the only other edifices on the "Point" above
the rank of huts; and as the soil around is too rocky and sandy to
make gardens, and all the native trees have long since been cut
down, these had but a bare and staring appearance.</p>

<p>Our poor horses seemed as well pleased as ourselves at the
delightful change from the "Rocky Hills" to a good level road, and
trotted gaily along, through the straggling township, and on
through another interval of "bush," to the ford of the "Meredith
River;" soon after passing which we turned aside from the road, and
drove to the door of our father's hospitable mansion, where, in a
long quiet sojourn among kind relations, I almost forgot the weary
journey I had made to reach them.</p>

Orchard.&mdash;Fruits.&mdash;Flowers.&mdash;Rabbits.&mdash;Black Swans.&mdash;Christmas
Day.&mdash;Pic-nic Parties.&mdash;Sponges.&mdash;Shrubs and Shells.</p>

<p>The house at "Cambria" commands an extensive view of large
tracts both of "bush" and cultivated land; and, across the Head of
Oyster Bay, of the Schoutens, whose lofty picturesque outline, and
the changing hues they assume in different periods of the day or
states of the atmosphere, are noble adjuncts to the landscape.
Below a deep precipitous bank on the south side of the house flows
a winding creek, the outlet of the Meredith River, gleaming and
shining along its stony bed, and richly fringed by native flowering
shrubs, mingled with garden flowers half-wild, poppies, stocks,
wallflowers, and bright-eyed marigolds looking merrily up, amidst
thickets of the golden wattle and snowy tea-tree; whilst, on the
higher ground, huge old gum-trees stand majestically, spreading
wide their white fantastic branches, and shiny yet sombre foliage.
At a short distance from the opposite bank of the creek stands a
thatched cottage, with its attendant outhouses, partly concealed
and shadowed by some particularly fine gum-trees, such as would be
deemed highly ornamental even in an English park, for trees of this
kind growing singly or in groups on rich land are scarcely
recognisable as of the same genus with the gaunt scraggy objects
that swarm together in the forests. The sight of this little
cottage removes, rather pleasantly, the feeling of loneliness and
isolation that generally pervades colonial country-houses, which
are most commonly built each in or near the centre of its own
estate; but in this instance the river, separating a large farm
from a little one, has attracted the owners of both to place their
houses near it. Large tracts of cleared, fenced, and cultivated
land form a nearly level plain in front, and towards the north, in
which direction the cottage, formerly the residence of our family,
peeps from its grove of wattle-trees. Steep but not very lofty
hills rise at the back of the Cambria plain, forming a small
outpost of the rocky tier that wholly environs the Great Swan Port
district on the land side, and, for want of comparatively little
labour in road-making, renders either ingress or egress a matter of
much fatigue and difficulty.</p>

<p>A large, well-built, cheerful-looking house, with its
accompanying signs of substantial comfort in the shape of barns,
stackyard, stabling, extensive gardens, and all other requisite
appliances on a large scale, is most pleasant to look upon at all
times and in all places, even when tens or twenties of such may be
seen in a day's journey; but when our glimpses of country comfort
are so few and far between as must be the case in a new country,
and when one's very belief in civilization begins to be shaken by
weary travelling day after day through such dreary tracts as we had
traversed, it is most delightful to come once more among sights and
sounds that tell of the Old World and its good old ways, and right
heartily did I enjoy them.</p>

<p>The noble veranda into which the French windows of the front
rooms open, with its pillars wreathed about with roses and jasmine,
and its lower trellises hidden in luxuriant geraniums, became the
especial abiding-place of my idleness; as I felt listless and
inactive after my year's broiling in New South Wales, and delighted
in the pleasant breezy climate of our new home.</p>

<p>Hawthorn hedges greeted me pleasantly again, with their old
remembered verdure and fragrant blossoms; and those of gorse, the
first I had seen since leaving England, would rival the growth of
that sturdy mountaineer even on its native hills. There were many
of these live fences, although the less pleasing ones of
posts-and-rails, or paling, logs, or brush were necessarily more
prevalent; and I found that the <i>un</i>accommodations of
slip-rails and gates of refractory temper were not wholly peculiar
to New South Wales.</p>

<p>Flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and horses, gave life and
interest to my veranda-diorama, and the distant road, half seen,
half hidden by the undulating ground, sometimes displayed, in
addition to its common-place traffic of bullock and horse teams, a
light cart or jaunting-car, or gig, with its living freight of
"settlers" male and female, either journeying to or returning from
the little settlement of Swansea, where there are one or two stores
of very limited pretensions, and two or three public-houses, all
the produce of the chief part of the district being shipped from
this place.</p>

<p>A large garden and orchard, well stored with the flowers and
fruits cultivated in England, were not among the least of the
charms Cambria possessed in my eyes; and the growth of fruit trees
is so much more rapid and precocious here than at home, that those
only ten or twelve years old appear sometimes aged trees. Apples
suffer severely here from the American blight, although some few
among the best kinds are wholly exempt from its attacks; the
orchard produces so great an abundance, as to afford a considerable
quantity of cider every year, which is a very pleasant summer
beverage.</p>

<p>Judging from the remarks on cider-making in "Loudon's
Encyclopaedia of Agriculture," I conceive that our Tasmanian cider
is fermented too much, so as to deprive it of too great a
proportion of the saccharine matter; as it is of a very pale
colour, and much thinner and more acid than the English and, except
by persons long accustomed to its use, is not drunk without the
addition of a large quantity of sugar, which, with a toast and a
little nutmeg, makes an extremely pleasant "cider-cup."</p>

<p>Pears succeed excellently, usually bearing an abundance of fine
fruit, as do also the medlar, quince, almond, cherry, and all the
family of plums, from the portly magnum bonum, looking like the
golden fruit of the Hesperides, and demanding to be preserved in
syrup, to the luscious bloomy Orleans, delicate green and yellow
gages, and the common damson. I have not yet seen the large prune
damson in the colony. Seedling peach-trees, which sometimes bear
the third year, usually produce an immense quantity of mediocre
fruit, useful for tarts and preserves, but the better kinds of
peach, together with the apricot and nectarine, are less plentiful.
The summer frosts are the direst foes of the gardener and
horticulturist in this island; often, when the trees are perfectly
clothed with fine blossoms, one night will destroy almost the
whole.</p>

<p>Of the smaller common fruits the gooseberry produces the most
certain crop, and bravely sustains its well-won fame in every
pleasant shape of pies and "fool," and jam, and sparkling
champagne, as in good old English homes. In moist situations
raspberries also are fine and plentiful; currants usually bear less
abundantly than in England; and strawberries are rarest of all;
both these latter being luxuriant in foliage but with a scanty show
of fruit. The Alpine strawberry seems to make itself more at home
here, and bears well. The out-of-doors vines produce grapes
scarcely equal to those grown in favourable situations without
glass at home; but here the hothouse and greenhouse supply for so
long a time a succession of the finest kinds in such beautiful
luxuriance, that the vines on outer walls are but little
valued.</p>

<p>The orchard, with its fine trees and shady grassy walks, some
broad, and straight, and long, others turning off into sly quiet
little nooks and corners, was a great delight to me. Shadowing a
bowery path and rustic bench in one place, were fine tall trees of
the beautiful English elder, rich in their noble creamy-white
clusters of most fragrant blossoms, mingling with the bright yellow
fringy flowers of the native wattle tree, which has a powerful
scent, like hawthorn, and tolerably well supplies the place of the
graceful laburnum&mdash;where that is wanting; but here it grows
nobly&mdash;large trees being gaily clad in its elegant drooping
flowers, the "golden chains" of one's childhood; and not far from
these, their ancient friend and contemporary in blossoming, the
rich purple lilac, bearing as heavy clusters as those I have so
often robbed her of in dear old England. I do not think the white
variety has yet graced these our Antipodean climes, at least I have
not yet seen it.</p>

<p>On the cool grassy banks of a little pond under the elder trees,
and overshadowed also by a thicket of filbert and hazel
bushes&mdash;which bear plenty of nuts in autumn&mdash;the New Zealand flax
flourishes; it is a noble-looking plant of the flag-kind, with long
broad leaves of prodigious toughness, and which, torn in long
strips, make excellent ties for all garden purposes, such as
binding grafts, tying up carnations, or making up nosegays.</p>

<p>The cultivated flowers here are chiefly those familiar to us in
English gardens, with some brilliant natives of the Cape, and many
pretty indigenous flowering shrubs interspersed. Most of these
latter are so hardy that I have no doubt the greater portion of
those now confined, by their English cultivators, in the greenhouse
or conservatory, would thrive better in the open air, provided they
were placed in a sheltered spot, and guarded from the biting frosts
of mid-winter&mdash;for to moderate frosts they are well accustomed
here&mdash;and, being evergreens, their varied foliage would be a
valuable acquisition in the autumn and early spring.</p>

<p>The gradual advance of the seasons is pleasantly marked, in
English gardens, by the progressive succession of flowers passing
before us like a beautiful procession, led in by the "Fair Maid of
February" and her attendant crocuses, and followed in unfailing
order by the brilliant train of spring, summer, and autumn flowers,
till the last pale chrysanthemums twine in the wreath of green old
Christmas himself: but here, even the gentle flowers rebel against
all Old World rules and customs, and so crowd one on another in the
year's pageant that we can sometimes gather spring, summer, and
autumn flowers within three months, which I, loving the old way
best, greatly lament. In favoured spots near the sea, where the
frosts are less keen than in the more inland districts, the common
red, scarlet, and large purple geraniums grow many feet high and
flower nearly all the year round; so do the crimson and pink China
roses, and the common fuchsia; whilst the double violets push up
such full bright flowers from amidst their clustering leaves that,
but for the exquisite perfume which vouches for their dear
identity, one might fancy that a blue ranunculus had been
invented.</p>

<p>Latterly, a few lovers of good flowers have introduced some of
the better and newer kinds of geraniums, pansies, picotees,
fuchsias, and other "florists' flowers," greatly to the enrichment
of our Tasmanian collections, and every new arrival flourishes most
satisfactorily in this fine climate.</p>

<p>A circular inclosure in the garden forms a small rabbit-warren,
well stocked with the common kinds, many of which, having long ago
been turned loose, their abundance all over the district is now so
great as sometimes to be troublesome and mischievous. The
fence-banks overgrown with huge gorse-bushes form admirable
retreats for the pretty little animals, and they increase so
rapidly, and make such depredations among the young turnips and
springing corn, that occasionally a proclamation of "war to the
knife" goes forth, when a troop of sportsmen and spaniels take the
field; at such times the golden-blossomed gorse-boshes do not
wholly escape, many of the most effectual "covers" being burned
down in order to dislodge the rabbits.</p>

<p>The most interesting ornaments of Cambria belonging to the
animal kingdom were, in my estimation, a pair of beautiful tame
black swans, the first of these birds that I had seen in their
native land. They seemed to live very happily in the creek below
the house, and always came at a call to be fed with bread or corn.
I cannot in conscience pronounce them to be quite equal in majestic
beauty to the white swan, but certainly few of the feathered tribe
can exceed them when on the water. Their plumage of glossy
raven-black, with a few snow-white feathers in the wings and tail,
is as elegantly grave a dress as can be conceived, and the bright
coral-red bill gives a gay air to the graceful and expressive head
and eyes. In the long slender neck I at first missed the curve that
looks so stately in the white swan, but soon got reconciled to it.
Their note is very melodious and plaintive, with a kind of
harp-tone in it, sounding very sweetly as they call to each other
over the water, or fly high overhead at night, when it seems like
an echo of music from the clouds.</p>

<p>Their nests are generally made in some low bank or islet, and
formed of a rude heap of water-weeds. The hen lays five or six
large long dingy-white eggs, and the cygnets are at first white,
being clothed only in the soft thick white down which forms the
inner garment of the swan at all ages, and to obtain which cruelty
of the most brutal kind has been and is still practised towards the
poor swans. The general custom was to take the birds in large
quantities in the moulting season, when they are most easily
captured and extremely fat; they were then confined in pens,
<i>without any food</i>, to linger miserably for a time, till ready
to die of starvation, because, whilst they are fat, the down can
neither be so well stripped off nor so effectually prepared. Troops
of people make a trade in the eggs, taking these in immense
quantities from all the known haunts of the swans, so as very
nearly to exterminate them; and, in proof of this, I had been above
two years at Swan Port before, in any of my numerous rides or
drives, my desire to see a wild black swan was gratified, though,
formerly, thousands frequented every lagoon. Even the tame pets at
Cambria were not suffered to live in peace; during our stay there,
"Jackey" was one day missing, and found shot dead, lying some short
distance down the creek; poor Matey shared the same fate some time
after, and lingered several days, after part of her bill had been
shot away.</p>

<p>I shall not he deemed to have given a satisfactory sketch of my
sable favourites, unless I add the result of my experience touching
their quality when eaten. A fine fat swan is by no means a
contemptible dish on the dinner-table, as the worthies who shot at
our tame favourites doubtless knew; dressed goose-fashion, they are
thought to taste like that bird, but I consider them superior,
being less coarsely fat, and of a more game-like flavour,
especially if served without the customary strong "illustrations"
of sage and onion bestowed upon goose.</p>

<p>My second Australian Christmas Day was passed at Cambria, and
found me just as involuntarily sceptical of the time, as I had felt
the year before in Sydney. To receive the good old-fashioned wishes
of "A merry Christmas and a happy New Year," accompanied by
bouquets of summer-flowers, from girls in white muslin frocks! and
to hear such murmured sounds in pantry and larder as "Christmas
Beef," "Christmas Turkeys," and "Mince-pies," on a glorious
Italian-skied, radiant, sunny, <i>hot</i> midsummer day! That the
anomaly was believed in here, was, however, quite evident; for,
before I was up that morning, busy hands had been at work dressing
the house all over. Holly there was none; but the picture-frames
and chimneys and sideboard were gaily and gracefully adorned with
lovely native shrubs, and a wreathy crown or garland suspended from
the drawing-room ceiling; whilst plentiful bouquets of
garden-flowers made the house bright and fragrant; and a large
family dinner party, music and dancing, and abundant mirth, all
helped to do honour to the world-beloved day; so that, although not
the real, proper, genuine <i>original</i> Christmas to me, it was a
very bright and pleasant parody upon it.</p>

<p>Pic-nic parties were very popular with our summer circle at
Cambria, and several pretty spots were successively selected as the
scenes of our rural banquets. The calm, bright, settled summer
weather of this delightful island is far better adapted for such
expeditions than the fickle climate of England, whose wayward
skies, like spoiled children, can never be found in the right
humour, but will persist in weeping most vehemently when we expect
them to smile their brightest. Here a fine morning might generally
be depended upon as heralding a fine day; indeed, weeks and months
of fair weather succeeded each other, until the farmers grew most
impatient for rain on their parching lands, and I found that my
admiration of this particular summer as a summer, was by no means
echoed by those interested in the growth of crops, for it was
unusually dry, insomuch that I began to see visions of New South
Wales in the dusty road and yellow fields that, when I first came,
lay like emeralds in the spring sunshine.</p>

<p>Our progresses to the appointed spots for our sylvan banquets
were performed in divers manners, and the marshalling forth of the
cavalcade often made as motley and busy a scene as the "Going to
the Chase" or "Return from Hawking" of many a fine old picture,
though made up of matters less essentially picturesque in
themselves. One sketch will suffice; the first object on the canvas
being a capacious open cart, drawn slowly into the courtyard by
four fine oxen, the bed of the cart filled with fresh straw. And
now the bustle of preparation, which had hitherto been confined to
kitchen, pantry, and cellar, began to manifest itself outside, as
baskets and boxes packed with clean straw or white cloths were
busily carried forth; their envelopes not wholly concealing
protruding rims of plates, corks of bottles, or the handle of a
saucepan&mdash;for potatoes boiled out of doors are well known to
possess an unusually fine flavour, at least they are always most
relished; and the presence of a gridiron or frying-pan is also
essential, giving in its use a kind of earnest reality to the
preparations, which the unfolding ready-prepared viands seems to
some deficient in. The baskets and boxes, safely stowed, were
followed by a heterogeneous collection of parasols, cushions,
shawls, and cloaks, and lastly by some of the juvenile members of
the party, deeply shadowed in curtained poke-bonnets, who being all
comfortably packed, and little misunderstandings between opposite
parasols finally adjusted, the bullock-driver thrashed the air
violently with his long ponderous whip, and the quiet docile team
moved slowly off. After a due time had been allowed for these heavy
troops to proceed in advance, the next division of the army
prepared to march, and the jaunting-car and phaeton drove up to
receive their living freight, who were usually accompanied by some
of the party on horseback; and lastly, bringing up the rear, came
our own roomy nondescript before mentioned&mdash;and as our noble steed
added to his more valuable qualities a habit of rearing and
plunging the moment one's foot touched the step, my cleverness was
tasked to the utmost to get safely on board and make a desperate
snatch at the baby, held up at arm's length; which perilous feat
accomplished, and the nursemaid packed in the excrescence behind,
away we dashed after the rest</p>

<p>A bold rocky point on the west side of the bay, one of the many
we had traversed on our last day's journey, was our destination on
one occasion; the cliffs were full of strange fantastic caves and
hollows, where the sea chafed and roared very grandly, and sent
jets of foam flying high through the narrow clefts, beneath which
it surged and swelled. Some of the upper and drier caves were
strewn thickly over with innumerable kinds of sponges, blown in
from the sea; some, great masses one or two feet thick&mdash;others,
delicate little web-work on the stems of kelp and corallines; some
branching into five or six finger-shaped portions, like a hand with
swollen joints. One smooth close kind I often found, exactly the
shape of a French roll; others were like pears or strings of
sausages. And the various colours and texture of these strange
zoophytic creations seemed infinite: many of them were so coarse as
to seem like quantities of bristles stuck together in a rough
irregular network, and from these were gradations to those so fine
that they required a microscope to detect any fibres in them. These
last had almost always smooth tubular openings passing through them
from end to end.</p>

<p>By the time I had made a collection of "particularly curious"
specimens, enough to fill a small boat had I carried them away, we
were summoned to assist at the banquet "al fresco," beneath some
trees at a little distance from my interesting sponge-museums among
the caves and cliffs, to which, after our repast, I and my
scramble-loving better-half returned, and continued our
explorations till the time for our re-embarkation and departure
arrived.</p>

<p>One of our expeditions was to the mouth of Swan Port, our way
lying along the broad smooth beach at the head of Oyster Bay, which
extends for nine miles in an unbroken sweep, and is so pleasant to
ride upon that only one vehicle, the roomy jaunting-car, was
required to carry some of the juveniles, the provisions, my maid,
and the baby; most of the party preferring to ride on horseback.
After our merry canter along the fine sands, we dispersed about the
beach, gathering shrubs or picking up shells: among the former were
some very handsome bushes, some&mdash;a species of
<i>Leucopogon</i>&mdash;bearing a very small white berry, and others a
pink and white fruit called native currants, not remarkable for
fine flavour, but very ornamental and pretty; and many of the
shells at this end of the beach were larger or altogether different
from those nearer home. The view up the winding estuary of Swan
Port, with its low islands and the dark wooded hills rising behind,
made a pleasant picture, and the ever-beautiful Schoutens rose
grandly before us.</p>

<p>These days always passed so rapidly that it was generally nearly
dark when we arrived at home, and the evenings closed with music,
dancing, and pleasant saunters in the veranda, where the bright
moonlight put to shame the artificial gleam from the open windows,
and showed my favourite view of the bay and Schoutens almost as
clearly as by day.</p>

<p>The almost daring feeling of security, as it at first seemed to
me, which is general here, would assuredly astonish any one who
should witness it whilst remembering the fearful stories they tell
now in England of our awful condition, social degradation, and so
forth. What family in England would think of living in a large lone
country-house, with French windows to the lower rooms unsecured by
a single bar, shutter, or bell, if their own and their neighbours'
servants, and, with rare exceptions, all the rural population
around them, were, or had recently been, prisoners convicted of all
varieties of crime? No one in his senses would dream of such "rash
absurdity," as it would be considered, and perhaps correctly; each
house would be a garrison, and its indwellers captives to their own
terrors. Yet such is the common custom here, in this "den of
thieves," this "gaol of the empire;" and the rarity here of
burglary or robbery of any description, as compared with their
constant occurrence at Home, proves the smallness of the risk.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-07" id="ch1-07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Bush Fires.&mdash;Their
Use.&mdash;Diamond Bird.&mdash;Robin.&mdash;Blue-Cap.&mdash;Cormorant.&mdash;Gulls.&mdash;Islands
in Bass's Straits.&mdash;Pied and Black Red-Bills.&mdash;Blue Crane.</p>

<p>During the hot dry weather of the Christmas time, very extensive
bush fires spread about the country, and were sometimes extremely
mischievous in their destruction of fences, which are very liable
to be thus burned, unless care be taken, previously to the dry
season, to clear away all fallen wood and rubbish, and to burn the
high grass and ferns for a breadth of three or four yards on either
side. The fences of sheep-runs, which extend in lines of many miles
in length, over the uncleared hills and forests, are those which
most frequently suffer; but growing crops, stacks, farm-buildings,
and dwellings are likewise sometimes swept away by the rapidly
advancing fire.</p>

<p>By day, the effect of these great conflagrations was far from
pleasant, causing an increase of heat in the air, and a thick haze
over the landscape generally; whilst from the various points where
the fires were raging, huge columns and clouds of dense smoke were
seen rising, as if from volcanoes: but at night, the scene was
often very grand; sometimes the fire might he watched, on any
rising ground, spreading onwards and upwards, swifter and brighter
as it continually gained strength, till the whole mountain side was
blazing together; and after the first fierce general flame had
passed away, and the great trunks of trees alone remained burning,
the effect resembled that of the scattered lights seen on
approaching a distant city at night. The rocky Schoutens glittered
with partial lines and trains of fire, that marked their rugged and
lofty outline like burnished gold amidst the darkness. Each night
showed some new change in the great illumination, until a heavy
fall of rain extinguished it altogether, much to the satisfaction
of all who feared its nearer approach.</p>

<p>A recent scientific writer (the Count Strzelecki), in treating
of this colony, condemns the practice of burning, as seriously
injurious to the pasturage, and seems to suppose that the custom
originated with the colonists; whereas the aborigines practised it
constantly, knowing the advantages of destroying the dense growth
of shrubs and coarse plants which cover the country in many parts,
and spring up again after the fire with young and fresh shoots,
which many of the wild animals then gladly feed on. The grass also
grows again immediately after the fires, and is greatly preferred
by by animals to the old growth; whilst, from the destruction of
tall ferns and scrub, it is rendered more accessible to them.
Sheep-owners know how serviceable occasional bush fires are, and
generally arrange to burn portions of their sheep-runs at different
times, so as to have a new growth about every three years. Where
this is neglected for a length of time, the rank luxuriance of the
great brake fern and other uneatable plants, and the accumulated
masses of dead wood, bark, and leaves, form such a body of fuel,
that when a fire does reach it, the conflagration is thrice as
mischievous in the destruction of fences as it otherwise would have
been.</p>

<p>Although every one else perpetually complained of the heat
during this glorious summer, to me it was perfectly delightful, so
lasting an impression had the scorching weather of New South Wales
left behind it. Sea-bathing was a great luxury, too, and a snug
bath, built near the house, over a nook of the salt-water creek,
sufficiently deep to afford a good plunge, enabled me to enjoy and
benefit from its invigorating effects without tasking my indolence
by taking a morning walk to the more distant sea-beach.</p>

<p>In the trees and bushes near the creek, I frequently made new
acquaintances of the bird kind, but only know a few of them by
name. Among these was that tiny flitting fairy called the Diamond
bird: it truly is a dainty little jewel; all gold and shaded amber,
with silver spots. Not less beautiful, and far more common, was my
old darling the robin, as exquisite a beau as ever, with his back
of blackest black, and his breast a living flame of scarlet; a warm
brave little heart there beats within it too, or his sparkling eye
tells no true story! With him came another of Nature's marvels of
beauty and brightness, dressed also partly in black, black
<i>bird-velvet</i>, off the same piece as robin's coat, but with a
cap and mantle of blue:&mdash;such blue! The deepest summer sky is mere
dull gray to it! This wondrous little bird is called the "superb
warbler" <i>(Malurus superbus)</i>, and superb in truth he is. So
bright, so swift, so merry, so musical as these little beings are,
sure nothing else ever was! The bluecap has a domestic contrast,
too, in his quiet-coloured little wife who, like her Old-World
namesake, Jenny Wren,</p>

<p class="poem">"Will still put on her brown gown.<br>
And never go too fine."</p>

<p>But though not dressed in as gay hues, she is as merry and
sprightly as her mate; a perfect little "dot" of a bird, (I wish
Dickens could see her!) quite round, like a ball set on two fine
black pins, with a sweet little head at one side, and at the other,
or more truly on the top, the drollest little long straight upright
tail that ever was seen. The robin and Mr. Bluecap and Jenny, are
all much alike in shape, and the way in which their indescribably
funny little tails are cocked up over their backs, sometimes almost
touching their heads, as they hop and pop about, up and down, and
in and out, cannot be imagined&mdash;it must be seen. Mr. Meredith says
they seem to him to spend their whole lives in trying to prove an
<i>"alibi,"</i> convincing you they are in one place, yet showing
themselves in another at the same instant; whilst I, in attempting
to follow with my eyes their almost invisible transits from spray
to paling, and from the paling on to the rose-bush, and then back
again to the cherry tree, always feel as if I were witnessing some
exhibition of legerdemain or conjuring, and am prepared for
surprises and mystifications without limit.</p>

<p>"Extremes meet," it is often said; but never can the axiom be
more perfectly illustrated than when a great, heavy, ugly, stupid,
gross-looking monster of a cormorant comes sousing down amongst a
party of these dainty little fairy birds, as I have sometimes seen
one, when attracted by the shoals of fish glancing in the bright
pebbly shallows of the creek. Settling himself, after much
preliminary bobbing and flapping, on a stout limb of a dead
gum-tree, he sits like a wooden effigy of a bird, watching his
prey.</p>

<p>Very different are many other of the sea birds that sometimes
visit the creek, but are more commonly seen on the beach and rocks.
All the gulls are beautiful, whether pied, gray, or white, the
latter especially; they are <i>so</i> white, and skim over the blue
sea in the distant sunlight like snow-flakes, only transformed to
bright-eyed birds as they near the shore; when their sweet mellow
cry comes floating with them, soft as the tone of a far-away
bell.</p>

<p>Although galls are not generally very tempting as articles of
food, I have heard Mr. Meredith recount his great delight at having
once, some years ago, killed nine at one shot, when he had been
shipwrecked on an island in Bass's Straits, and had lived for some
days on a miserable sort of porridge or burgoo, made of flour
recovered from the wreck, and so damaged by salt water that it
would not bake, mixed with water so strongly impregnated with alum
that it could scarcely be drunk. After this diet, meat, even though
that of a sea-bird, became valuable, and the nine gulls were a most
precious acquisition; but, being shot at dusk, they were put aside
until dawn, to be prepared for breakfast; and then, woeful to
relate, all that remained of them were two legs, the rest having
been devoured during the night by rats. A species of native rat
abounds on many of these islands, and snakes are numerous on all,
however widely separated by the boisterous sea and strong currents
that flow between them. Mr. Meredith was told by an old
"Straitsman," who had for years been wandering all about them,
hunting seals and mutton birds, that he never was on one, though
only containing a few acres, on which he did not observe snakes;
and my husband gives the same account, so far as his knowledge of
them extends.</p>

<p>On one occasion, during the sojourn on "Prime Seal Island"
before mentioned, he had observed a fine "Cape Barren goose"*
alight, and, taking his gun, was stealing warily towards it,
keeping a rock between himself and the goose, when a rustling
amongst the scrub caused him to look down, and he saw part of an
enormous snake, which was rapidly moving across, close beneath his
feet; fortunately, the loss of the goose, which he alarmed by his
precipitate retreat from the snake, was the only harm done.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The "Cape Barren Goose" frequents the island
from which it takes its name, and others in the Straits. It is
about the same size as a common goose, the plumage a handsome
mottled brown and gray, somewhat owl-like in character.]</p>

<p>Among the sea-birds, the "red-bills" are great favourites of
ours; they are so very sprightly and handsome in their clear
brilliant black and white plumage, gaily set off by their bills and
legs of the brightest coral. They run along the sands with
exceeding swiftness, always running into the water to take wing,
when alarmed by the approach of such terrific things as ourselves.
They scarcely make anything fit to be called a nest, but lay about
two eggs on the beach or sandbank, and the young ones, until able
to escape danger by flight, lie close and motionless, and thus
often evade detection; but if by chance any one approaches the
defencelesis little ones, the old birds are extremely bold and
indefatigable in their endeavours to divert his attention; flying
or running close round him, and then circling away a short distance
to entice pursuit; sometimes they flutter lamely along, as if hurt
and incapable of flight, until they have succeeded in removing the
threatened peril from the precious little babes in the sand, when,
with a backward glance and a saucy cry of triumph, away they fly,
as sound and swift as ever.</p>

<p>Besides the pied red-bills, there are some rather larger, whose
plumage is wholly black; but these, although handsome, are less so
than the others. Both species are sometimes eaten, but I rejoice to
say their flavour is too "fishy" to be generally liked; for I love
them so well whilst alive, that I grieve to have them destroyed.
The wide extent of the sea beaches here requires the presence of
all the birds that belong to, or are wont to visit them, to add
their small items of joyous animal life to the great and grand
attributes of ocean, and to people with their busy activity the
otherwise lonely strand.</p>

<p>The figures of my favourite red-bills, under the name of
"oyster-catchers," in Gould's "Birds of Australia," are less
faithful than most of his admirable plates; they are too
heavy-looking, and represent the bills and feet as orange-coloured,
instead of their real hue of pure brilliant coral-red. A beautiful
blue crane often came and sat in a bare tree over the creek,
watching the fish: I had amused myself for some mornings in
watching him with equal attention, and admiring his long elegant
neck, slender legs, large bright eyes, and lovely delicate
silvery-blue plumage, and I vainly hoped that we might still go on
quietly together; but, alas! despite my extreme discretion in not
attracting attention to my feathered companion, he was one morning
seen, doomed, shot without mercy, and a day or two after appeared
as a second-course roast, which was much praised. I did not taste
my unlucky friend; I should, however, imagine, from what I had
observed of his way of living, that the <i>post mortem</i>
examination would reveal to the palates of those who did, rather
strong evidence of his ichthyological researches.</p>

Beach.&mdash;Rivulet.&mdash;Gully.&mdash;Lace

<p>I OFTEN call to mind with great pleasure one excursion in
particular, which we made (during our sojourn at Cambria) to the
Schoutens. It was in April, when the pleasant autumn weather was
growing cool, and frequent frosty mornings denoted the approach of
the mild winter of this delightful climate, that our expedition was
planned, and as the days were "drawing in," as old ladies say, it
was advisable to make the utmost use of the daylight. Accordingly,
we rose and breakfasted before sunrise, and the crisp grass,
silvered over with hoar-frost, crunched under the horses' feet as
we drove off; our small party being arranged in the roomy
jaunting-car, drawn by a pair of horses driven tandem-wise. A box
and basket, well stored with materials for luncheon, accompanied us
and also a servant to take care of the horses. Away we went, first
through grass and turnip fields, and then humping over the tussocks
on the sandbank, until we made a descent on the glorious beach,
where, on the broad hard sands, our gallant steeds might put forth
their energies without a chorus of cries, deprecating the
bone-breaking jolts of an uneven road; and the fine "nine-mile
beach" was merrily and quickly traversed.</p>

<p>The grand view before us, of the Schouten range, grew more and
more distinct and beautiful as we advanced, and the sun rose
higher. The mountainous chain or group of the Schoutens is most
picturesquely composed; the mainland portion commences, next the
mouth of Swan Port, in three chief eminences, running nearly
parallel east and west; these are connected by a narrow isthmus of
low land running from their western side, with another group of
sublime bare granitic peaks, trending to the south, and between
which and the triple mount, the bright blue waves of the Pacific
flow into "Wineglass Bay" ("Thouin's Bay" of the published maps). A
strait, called the "Schouten Passage," separates these kindred
crags from the Schouten Island, which stretches away still farther
south, its swelling heights and almost inaccessible rocky ranges
crowned by a lofty dome-shaped mount, and its southern extremity
ending in an abrupt precipitous bluff.</p>

<p>Beyond all these, we saw Maria Island, rising high and shadowy
in the morning light, and the "White Rock" ("Isle des Phoques")
gleaming like the sail of a ship, as it caught the first sunbeams
on its steep fort-like sides.</p>

<p>Behind us, the lower view had dwindled almost to insignificance;
Swansea and the neighbouring little bays and points being almost
lost; but above them were now seen ranges of the lofty
mountaintiers in the interior, clothed in the usual sombre hues of
the forest, with the morning vapours still hanging round them in
gauzy mists, or rolling upward, brightened by the early
sunbeams.</p>

<p>On arriving at the mouth of Swan Port, we found a boat awaiting
us, and quickly deserted our jaunting-car, leaving the groom to
take care of the horses, whose comfort had also been cared for, and
a good feed of corn carried with us for them to discuss in our
absence. The cloaks and boxes being transferred to our new
conveyance, we embarked to cross over to the "Old Fishery Bay,"
where one of Mr. G. Meredith's whaling stations was formerly
situated. The view up Swan Port was now added to the grand mountain
landscape I have attempted to sketch, and most entirely I enjoyed
the new and beautiful scene.</p>

<p>The sea here was so perfectly translucent, and the white granite
sand at the bottom so bright, that on looking down, a whole world
of strange and exquisite things were clearly visible. We gazed upon
forests of broad-leaved trees of sea-weed, their strong roots
clasping the rocks some fathoms below, and their thick round stems
ascending through the clear water to within a foot or two of the
surface, spreading forth their broad, long, gracefully-curved,
slowly-waving leaves in perpetual undulations, as if each were
instinct with individual life, and all blended together in a grave
and gentle dance. Among the leaves of these marine forests glided
bright, silver-glancing, filmy-finned fish, and when we sailed past
these, and came over portions of the sand where no kelp grew, we
saw gigantic sea-stars, spreading their long arms out, purple and
red; and shells, and more fish, glancing and darting to and fro so
temptingly that our party proposed catching some; and in a moment
three or four hooks and lines were over the side, the boatmen being
well provided with such sea-stores. Before I had watched one of
them sink near the bottom, two or three others were pulled up, with
fine fish, of a kind called here "Flat-heads," a name tolerably
descriptive of their form. The head is broad and flat, the eyes
prominent, and placed on the top; the body narrows from thence to
the tail, and is armed with several strong sharp spines. So eagerly
did these poor flat-heads take the bait, that a dozen might be seen
hurrying to each hook as it was lowered, and all the fishers had to
do was, to drop their lines and pull them up again. About ten
minutes thus employed served to furnish such an abundant supply,
that it was decided we should not bestow any more time on the
sport, and we proceeded on our way.</p>

<p>The huge granite-cragged peaks seemed to rise higher and higher
as we neared them, and soon entering a lovely little bay, sheltered
on all sides save the opening by wooded crags and glittering
granite rocks, the boat's keel grated along the snow-white gravelly
beach, and we landed at the "Old Fishery." The beach was dazzlingly
white. I sat down on it, and, gathering up a handful of the shining
gravel, found that it is pure white quartz, apparently the
remaining portion of decomposed granite, the mica and felspar being
washed away, and the disintegrated quartz thrown up on the smooth
beach, like sand. The effect was most beautiful, and to me,
strange; and the clear blue water rippling in gentle waves, and
singing its soft murmuring music amongst the tiny pebbles, was so
pleasant to eye and ear, that I had half forgotten the long
scramble we had planned, when, all preliminary arrangements being
made, I was aroused from my sea-dreams.</p>

<p>An old hut, the remains of a bread-oven, and other tokens of
former habitants, would have given an air of desolation, as I think
deserted human dwellings always do, to any place less beautiful;
but all of nature was so bright and joyous, that I had not a shadow
of the sentimental, even for the cold hearth of the crazy old hut.
Numbers of whales' bones lay all around, both on the white
beach&mdash;they rivalling it in whiteness&mdash;and among the grass and low
shrubs above. A rivulet of pure fresh water gurgled down from the
mountain at the back of the station, and its little still pools lay
cool and tempting, shaded over with acacias and other lovely
shrubs. We walked for awhile beside the rivulet, crossing it from
time to time to gain the best path. Numbers of flowers were still
in blossom, the bright crimson <i>Epacris</i> being the most
conspicuous, and my hands were soon full of them.</p>

<p>We now began to climb a rather steep ascent, our purpose being
to mount up between the western and middle peaks of the Triad, and,
from the top of the gully, look over into Wineglass Bay and the
Pacific Ocean; so on we went, with high resolves for the execution
of the project. The gully varied considerably in width, and often
in the narrowest places we found huge blocks of granite had tumbled
pell-mell into the gorge, some being as large as a house, and from
that size downwards; and when the sides of the ravine were
perpendicular cliffs, it became a matter of some puzzle,
considerable difficulty, and still more amusement, to surmount the
barrier. Sometimes I could crawl beneath the rocks, if they
happened to tilt conveniently up at one side, and then what stores
of exquisite mosses and lichens and dainty delicate ferns I
detected in their dim and cool bowers! Once or twice (whether so
inspired by the genius of the place that I began to fancy myself
something less material than I really am, I know not), in squeezing
between two rocks that just left a tempting crevice, and so offered
a chance of escaping a scramble over their tops, I became firmly
jammed, and had begun to speculate on the pleasant prospect of
starvation and death, and the matter for contemplation which my
bones would furnish to some future discoverer, when by timely
assistance, or the summing up of my whole remaining strength in one
last struggle, I was extricated, and went toiling on. The first few
hundred yards so completely tired me that I felt as if I must give
up the idea of reaching the top of the gully, and sat down, weary,
breathless, and dispirited, on a log; but after resting for a few
minutes, I seemed to gain new strength, and went on resolutely,
clambering over rocks, logs, bushes, and briars, diving under huge
boulders of granite all damp and mossy, and often shrinking in
terror lest my foot should disturb some horrible venomous snake
hidden amidst the thick beds of mingled living and decayed
vegetation that filled up the lesser gullies and hollows.</p>

<p>I found that most singular and beautiful lichen, the <i>Cenomyce
retispora</i>, spreading in large white masses over the red granite
rocks, adorning the rough coarse stone with its elegant garb of
fine and delicate lace. It is white and thin, and perforated all
over with small regular apertures, like plain Valenciennes lace,
gathered and plaited and puckered up in all conceivable diversity
of turns and twists, so as to form a pretty close mass, like an
assemblage of baby's cap-borders all pressed together, and growing
about as high from the rock as the width of those same little
trimmings. There is a kind of coral found on the Tasmanian beaches
so like this lichen, that I must suppose the sea-nymphs and fairies
have modelled them both in some trial of skill; but I am quite
unable to decide which party must have been deemed victorious, both
specimens of Nature's fancy-work are so exquisitely wrought</p>

<p>The ferns, too&mdash;the green and graceful ferns&mdash;how beautiful they
were! Besides the common brake and a kind of hart's-tongue, very
similar to those of England, I gathered one or two kinds of
maiden-hair, one like the <i>Adiantum capillus Veneris</i>, but
much larger than the English species, the stem taller, and the
pinnules larger, but their slender hair-like foot-stalks as
delicate as my fragile little favourite at home. Other ferns had
broad fronds like the hart's-tongue of England, with similar
fructification, and one species was quite new to me, nor can I find
any botanical description answering to it in London's
"Encyclopaedia of Plants," that invaluable and rarely-failing
lexicon. The stem of my new fern is thin, smooth, and erect, from
ten to fifteen inches high, with two forked stalks branching off
from its top. The pinnae which proceed from them on each side are
long, very narrow, and of a very dark green. The sori extend in two
rows of small round spots down the underside of the pinnules; and
the upper side, which is only the width of the impression raised by
the sori, has the appearance of being formed of two rows of very
small green beads, which diminish to points at the narrow end. This
is but a clumsy portrait, yet I cannot sketch it better in words;
and although I gathered many specimens, they withered and dried up
before I reached home, my tin box not forming a part of our
preparations.</p>

<p>The perfect distinctness of the echoes here was a source of much
amusement to us; our names, called loudly, seemed to be taken up by
choruses of airy voices shouting back the words. I never before
heard my Christian name arranged with so many variations. A hearty
laugh roused a most unearthly supernatural peal of repetitions;
each mossy stone of the cliffs and peaks above us appeared to give
out its own independent voice, and then they all echoed each other,
till the very air seemed vibrating with mirth; and then, after we
had again and again repeated our laughing chorus, I suggested how
grand it would be to have a cannon fired in this enchanted
glen!&mdash;and Mr. Meredith tried his fowling-piece as the best
substitute at hand. The report was taken up and prolonged into a
peal of thunder, and when the loud near echoes ceased, the far-off
crags and caves rolled forth upon the air continued reverberations,
sometimes pausing for a moment, and then swelling out again, as
though the mountain genii were too deeply outraged by our
presumption to forget or forgive it; and as each told the angry
tale, others carried it away to repeat it again and again.</p>

<p>Our rough scramble up this wild gully was amply rewarded when we
reached the top, and, resting on a fantastic perch of rocks and
roots of trees, I had time to look calmly about me and enjoy the
splendid view.</p>

<p>On either side of the ravine rose the towering summits of the
mountain, bare masses of granite heaped up on high like giant
altars, or rising abruptly from belts of shrubs and trees, like
ancient fortress walls and turrets. But the downward and onward
view was like enchantment! Far below my giddy perch (from which to
the sea-level the steep craggy side of the mountain was fringed
with a various growth of forest trees and shrubs) lay, calmly
slumbering in the bright sunshine, that blue and beautiful nook of
the Pacific named Wineglass Bay. We could see the silvery circles
of the tide break on the white beach, but only a most attentive ear
could at that height detect the low whispering sound they made.
Beyond the beach, a green grassy slope ran back to the foot of the
mountains, which rose majestically to an altitude of many hundred
feet, their lower and less steep portions clothed with forests, and
their bare lofty conical peaks pointing to the clouds; countless
points and promontories stretched out into the bay, some crowned
with fantastic rocks that looked like forts and castles; these
continued one beyond another, into the clear blue distance, where
one little island stood alone, as if to mark the union of the fairy
bay with the broad, bright, blue Pacific.</p>

<p>I could scarcely draw at all for looking at the glorious scene,
and the few minutes that could be allowed for my attempt were gone
all too soon, and we began our downward progress, wherein the
stumbling and scrambling of the ascent were repeated with liberal
interest; and heated, tired, and thirsty, we again looked lovingly
into the rivulet's shady pools, and scooped up the water to
drink.</p>

<p>On reaching the beach where we had landed, we found that the
boatmen had made for us a nice dining-pavilion in a shady nook,
among some myrtle and honeysuckle trees, the boat-sail being
cleverly converted into a tent, open at one side, and the cloth
laid on the grass beneath, whilst joints of whale's vertebrae,
white and smooth and clean, were placed round for seats;&mdash;what
could be more appropriate at the "Old Fishery?"&mdash;and our chickens
and ham, rabbit-pie, tarts, fruit, cider, and wine, rendered doubly
good by our well-earned appetites, received the ample justice they
deserved.</p>

<p>After our pleasant repast, I wandered round the nearest point to
another beach, seeking shells, but found very few, the pebbly
gravel apparently grinding them in pieces as they are thrown
up.</p>

<p>The day was fast closing when we sailed back to the mouth of
Swan Port, and very soon after the jaunting-car had again taken in
its passengers, the sun set, but the horses cantered gaily along;
the "song-voiced" of our little party occasionally "rousing the
night-owl with a catch," as we rolled over the smooth hard sands.
We were compelled to walk over the sandbank for safety, it being
impossible for the driver to avoid the holes and great tussocks at
night; and so dark was it, that I had some difficulty in groping my
way after my more active companions. The lights gleaming from the
windows at home proved a welcome beacon to the weary party, and our
pleasant day's wandering closed without the most trivial drawback
to our enjoyment; indeed, for a long time I marked the day of our
Schouten expedition as the whitest day in my calendar since leaving
England; and my good husband, to whom the glorious mountains have
been familiar from boyhood, made a charming plan for taking us the
next summer in a boat, with proper appliances and means for a
sojourn, such as a tent, mattress, blankets, kettle, tin plates and
pannicans, tea, sugar, bread, and shooting, fishing, and sketching
tackle, and so go coasting round about the picturesque Schoutens,
landing wherever fancy led us, and leading a week or two of
gipsy-life; but I am sorry to say this pleasant castle in the air
never advanced beyond the ground plan, although for several
succeeding summers we promised ourselves that the next should
certainly see our project realized.</p>

<p>The fine broad sandy beach near Cambria was a constant source of
delight to me, for although our wanderings had led us over the sea
and near the sea perpetually, yet I had not until now enjoyed a
sea-side ramble for years, and many a long morning I idled
pleasantly away in sauntering on the "Long Beach," which stretches
from the Meredith River to the mouth of Swan Port: this was my
favourite haunt, and a most deceptive one too, for often when I
thought we had only rambled a very moderate distance, and turned to
retrace our steps, it seemed as if those smooth tantalizing sands
were interminable; and the few landmarks telling us the whereabouts
of our goal, the "creek," beside which lay our path from the beach
to the house, appeared to recede as we approached them. The grand
range of the Schoutens, the distant Maria Island, and the little
fort-like promontory of Swansea in the foreground, often enlivened
by the arrival or departure of small coasting vessels in the
beautiful bay, made a picture that no one could very quickly weary
of, and to me it was always charming, and always wearing some new
phase of beauty.</p>

<p>Many of the shells we found were familiar to me, my kind
relatives here having years ago supplied my cabinet at home with
specimens of the greater portion; but the pleasure of picking them
up myself in this nook of the world which I had formerly so little
dreamed of visiting in person, was by no means a contemptible
gratification, and as one day after another brought some new
representative of my old treasures before me, I became tenfold more
interested in the quest. I found that both live and dead shells of
some two or three kinds would be thrown up in considerable numbers
for some days, or even weeks, and then perhaps months would elapse
without the same species being seen at all, or but very rarely; but
by this nice distribution we had always some kinds in season.</p>

<p>As the collections of shells I made at Swan Port contained a
tolerable variety, perhaps an enumeration of them may be
interesting, although my knowledge of conchology is too limited to
enable me to determine often more than the genera.</p>

<p><i>Serpula</i>, one species, very commonly found in small masses
of multitudes of little intertwisted white-ribbed tubes, but not
containing the living worms.</p>

<p><i>Spirorbis</i>, on leaves of algae.</p>

<p><i>Pholas papyracea</i>, and, I believe, <i>P. dactylus</i>, but
only dead shells.</p>

<p><i>Solen ensis</i>, fresh and perfect shells, not alive.</p>

<p><i>Panopoea, Glycimeris</i>, dead shells.</p>

<p><i>Anatina rostrata: Tellina radiata; Tellinides.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Donax</i>, a small species.</p>

<p><i>Astarte Danmoniensis</i>, and others; one species of Astarte
being a large white, heavy, orbicular shell, with the ridges fine
as hair, smooth and close.</p>

<p><i>Cyprina, Cytherea</i>, and <i>Venus</i>, many species; one of
the latter very beautiful, from one to two inches broad, and with
four or five broad up-turned projecting ridges, fringed beneath
like the fur of a mushroom, and lengthening posteriorly into curved
spines, from a quarter to three quarters of an inch in length.
These were the most beautiful bivalve shells I found, and they were
very rare; their colour was usually white, with the fringe-linings
of the ridges a delicate blush pink. I used to compare them to a
lady's "drawn" silk bonnet, but we very seldom indeed found them
perfect, the long spines and fragile edges of the shell being
generally worn and eroded even whilst living.</p>

<p>At one time patches of the sand were nearly covered with
quantities of the fine milk-white <i>Cardium</i>, which I used to
prize so much in my, collection, that I was almost involuntarily
careful so to tread as not to crush the gracefully heart-shaped
shells.</p>

<p>In this same collection I had also many single valves of a small
<i>Arca</i> of peculiar form, one end being rounded, and the other
elongated to a point (something like <i>Pandora rostrata</i>), the
hinge consisting of numerous fine teeth. We constantly found single
valves on the beach, but sought in vain for a live or entire shell,
until one day, whilst idly picking to pieces a lump of zoophytic
sea-stuff that had been washed up amidst kelp and sponges, I found
some of the oft-sought little shells imbedded in it alive; but only
a few rewarded my subsequent searches for them, although I pursued
the quest most industriously.</p>

<p>I sometimes have found old water-worn valves of a larger Arca
(<i>Bysso-arca Noae</i>, I think), and valves of a
<i>Pectunculus</i> occur in like manner.</p>

<p>A large chestnut-brown <i>Modiola</i>, of a peculiar form, and
from three to four inches long, was among our most prized shells,
not being often found entire. I think it is nearly the same shell
as the largest of those figured as Date Muscles, from Brazil, in
Murray's "Encyclopaedia of Geography."</p>

<p>Multitudinous colonies of the small dark blue muscle covered the
rocks left exposed at low water, and clusters of a larger common
kind were continually washed up.</p>

<p>Quantities of a small, transparent, and most fragile species of
<i>Avicula</i> were repeatedly strewn over the sands; these were
most delicate pellucid little shells, like the thinnest glass, or
<i>crisp</i> goldbeaters skin, tinged with nicely-pencilled shades
of green, brown, olive, and red; but I never found one with a fish
in it, and delicate indeed must be the denizens of such dainty
domiciles; pill-boxes fitted up with cotton, wool, and cambric
paper, were all too coarse to preserve them.</p>

<p>A few small live <i>Pectens</i> (the common scallop shell), with
the upper valve flat, and the lower one concave, most beautifully
and variously marked with fine colours, were the chief objects of
our search for a week or two, and then came such shoals of them,
both large and small, that a whole nation of scallops must have
been suddenly up-turned on the beach, nearly all alive; and, as a
natural consequence of their abundance, they greatly diminished in
value. The fish within was firm, white, and well-flavoured, when
boiled, but the quantity of sand which had washed into them could
not wholly be got rid of, and prevented the otherwise nice fish
from being palatable.</p>

<p>Oysters, at Oyster Bay, may well be supposed abundant, although
they are not often obtained for the table. Enormous quantities of
dead shells are found, forming large banks, forty feet high, on two
low isthmuses, one of which unites the two groups of the Schouten
Mountains, and the other joins the northernmost of these with the
mainland. Similar banks are also found at Little Swan Fort. These
prodigious accumulations of oyster-shells appear inexhaustible, and
are very useful as lime; the coasting vessels often bring cargoes
of them across to Swansea, where they are sold to the settlers at
sixpence a bushel. Large oyster-beds still exist in the bay,
exactly opposite to the shell-banks, and after high winds, both
live and dead shells are thrown up on the two former of the
shell-banks, but not on any other beach in the vicinity. This
having doubtless been the case for centuries, the aboriginal
inhabitants would be accustomed to resort thither for the oysters,
and very probably added to the shells thus naturally collected, by
procuring the oysters also from the beds themselves, which they
could easily do, having rude bark-rafts or catamarans, and being,
like most savages, expert divers. They would naturally convey the
oysters to the nearest shore for the purpose of eating them, and
this being in both cases the adjacent shelly beach, the banks there
would gain perpetual additions from their ample repasts. This
process, continuing perhaps for ages, is too obvious an assisting
cause to be entirely passed over, although the still-continued
increase of the banks, from shells now continually thrown up,
furnishes ample reason for the surprising accumulation. In dredging
for oysters upon the sea-beds, the proportion of dead to live
shells brought up was as ten to one, leaving the profit a very
inadequate return for the labour bestowed.</p>

<p>The rafts used by the aborigines of this island must be placed
in the lowest class of such fabrics, even as the people themselves
were the lowest of the human species. They were formed of many
little bundles of gum-tree bark, tied with grass, first separately,
and then bound together in the required form, thick and flat,
without any attempt at the shape of a boat or canoe, and not
keeping the passenger above water when used, but just serving to
float him on the surface. In, or rather <i>on</i>, these, the
natives sat and paddled about with long sticks, or drifted before
the wind and tide; and in calm weather frequently crossed over from
the mainland to Maria Island; but on such occasions they provided a
little raised platform on the raft, on which they carried some
lighted fuel to kindle their fire when they arrived there.</p>

<p>In Little Swan Port beds of living oysters now exist, and on the
adjacent shore are high banks of shells, similar to those I have
mentioned; but there is no surf or "wash" in the still waters of
this estuary, to cast up shells, so that unless the one kind of
"natives" consumed the other to such an extent as to account for
the accumulation, the banks must have been up-raised from the
sea.</p>

<p>In Prosser's River, another estuary, farther south, are beds of
live oysters, but in this instance they are unaccompanied by the
usual shore banks of dead shells.</p>

<p>At "East Bay Neck," a low isthmus between Tasman's Peninsula and
the mainland, large banks of cockle-shells occur, in the same
manner as those of oysters at Swan Port, at about four or five
yards above high-water mark, and are now overgrown with grass and
rushes.</p>

<p>At "Piccaninny Point," a small rocky promontory on the east
coast, immense quantities of dead cockle-shells are constantly
thrown up after a gale; ship-loads might sometimes be collected,
but no accumulation can take place, as they are quickly broken by
the action of the waves among the rocks.</p>

<p>In Port Sorell, on the north coast, wide tracts of sand laid
bare at low water are full of dead shells, chiefly a small species
of cockle <i>(Venus) &mdash;&mdash;)</i>, which furnish the only kind of lime
used in the district, the shells being partially cleared from the
sand previously to burning them.</p>

<p>I am not aware if these little facts are worth recording for
aught beyond the evidence they afford of considerable and
geologically recent changes having occurred in many parts of the
Tasmanian coast; the shells in all the banks named being recent
species, identical with the live ones near them. Now, to return to
the Swan Port shells, from which I have rambled too far.</p>

<p>Several kinds of <i>Patella</i> were very common, one large
species having rich lustre-like rays, when held in a particular
light; and a very delicate <i>Infundibulum</i> I sometimes found
perfect, but much more frequently broken, being exceedingly fragile
and thin. An <i>Emarginula</i>, and a small species of
<i>Fissurella</i>, I also found, but these rarely.</p>

<p>Several of those strange-looking slugs called sea hares
(<i>Aplysia?</i>) were at one time thrown on the beach, and I
obtained the internal shells of two; these were very thin and
horny, and, when dried, shrank to half their original size, which
was about an inch and a half long by an inch broad, thickened at
one side. The slugs themselves were four or five inches long,
nearly black, and marked somewhat like a leech, very thick and
solid; but too little life remained in them, when found, to revive
in the water, though I immediately carried them to a little pool in
the rocks, hoping to see them perfectly recover.</p>

<p>The only land shells I have seen in this colony are two species
of <i>Achatina</i>, or possibly old and young specimens of the same
shell; the largest about an inch and a quarter long, brown, with
two bands of white; the others very similar, but much less.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith one day brought me a piece of peat-like earth, from
a drain that was being dug, not far from the sea, which was full of
small freshwater shells of various species. Many of them, such as
<i>Planorbis, Lymnaea, Paludina</i>, and <i>Cyclas</i>, were
identical with those of English brooks and pools, and with living
specimens now inhabiting those of Tasmania, but so minute, that out
of a little boxful of earth (a "percussion-cap" box) I could have
picked some hundreds of perfect shells, and the ground whence it
came was equally full for a great distance; it seemed one mass of
these fragile little shells nicely packed, with the finest and
smallest vegetable fibres all amongst them, holding the whole
together. As fresh-water lagoons formerly occupied a large space in
the immediate vicinity of this shelly peat, the only puzzle I find
in the matter is the absence of all larger shells.</p>

<p>I have found individuals of a kind of <i>Sigaretus</i>, which I
cannot identify by any description I have, although they may very
probably not be new species.</p>

<p>The <i>Haliotis</i> is much better known here. Dead, but very
perfect shells of <i>H. rubra</i> were frequently thrown up on the
beach; some, five or six inches across, and from that size, in
various gradations, down to the delicate little young ones, not
larger than a small bean, all splendidly irridescent within, unless
injured by a marine worm, which seems particularly partial to
shells of a pearly substance. It must have been one of these
delicate little pearly ones which first suggested their common name
of "Venus's ear," so nicely curled over, so thin and transparent;
but the colonists, sad matter-of-fact people that they are! who
utilitarianize everything, and attach some vulgar work-day sort of
association to all of the sublime or beautiful that they approach,
have bestowed on the creature of the rainbow-tinted pearly mansion,
the equivocal appellation of "Mutton-fish," and this with as little
reason or propriety as they have shown in most other instances of
the kind, for the animal of the <i>Haliotis</i> is scarcely eatable
under any circumstances; at least it possesses about as much claim
to be ranked among things cookable or edible as did the old boots
which we are told some of our gallant explorers have been fain to
attack in the extremity of their Polar starvation. Such was the
quality of one I tried to taste, that, whilst a leather glove or a
piece of India rubber remains to me, <i>I</i> will not ask for a
mutton fish! They are found alive on the rocks in from one to five
fathoms water, and adhere so strongly that it requires some
dexterity, and a very strong knife, inserted in a peculiar manner,
to detach the fish from the rock.</p>

<p>A handsome <i>Trochus</i>, of a light-brown colour, and slightly
rough with many small tubercles, was occasionally found; and
various species of <i>Turbo</i> abounded. Some of these, rejoicing
in the ancient name of Periwinkles, were, when boiled, pronounced
very nice by some of our party; but they looked too green and
caterpillarish, and had too strong a fishy sea-weedy sort of
flavour, to find favour with my palate.</p>

<p>The lovely <i>Phasianellae</i>, or Beauty-Snails, abounded on
these beaches, and by the infinitely varying patterns of their
markings and colours almost baffled my endeavours to find two
alike. Some were white, spirally circled round by delicate but
well-defined bands, ribands rather, of pale red, diminishing to
microscopic smallness of touch as they reached the apex of the
shell: but the more general colours were all kinds of brown, red,
and olive, blended together in beautiful patterns, some being, it
would seem, a careful imitation of Scotch plaids and ginghams, so
accurately and regularly is the design painted by the poor little
short-lived architect; the same pattern being continued and
repeated in the same shell, from the apex to the mouth, gradually
expanding in size. I am not acquainted with any other shell which
displays such great diversity of markings as this. The outer lip is
so thin, that even in live shells it is scarcely ever found quite
perfect. Their size varies from one to two and a half inches in
length, the largest being by far the most rare.</p>

<p>A shell, similar in form to the <i>Phasianella</i>, but rather
more slender, and never occurring so large as the former, is still
unknown to me by name. The exterior is smooth, usually brown, and
highly polished, with fine wavy or diagonal lines of white; but
within, it is grooved, pearly, and highly irridescent; more richly
tinged with the exquisite blue and green of the prismatic colours,
than any other shell I am acquainted with. Possibly it is a
<i>Turbo</i>; but it seems almost too long and slender to belong to
that round, portly, corpulent family.</p>

<p>A large <i>Fasciolaria</i>, a <i>Fusus, Triton cutaceus</i>, and
a common kind of <i>Murex</i>, we also found, and two species of
<i>Cassis</i>: one somewhat similar to <i>C. erinaceus</i>, but
more inflated, and the recurving outer lip marbled with touches of
deep brown on the buff ground colour of the shell. Some of these
are two inches long, and nearly as much broad. The other species of
<i>Cassis</i> is considerably less, and thicker, with a smooth
thickened outer lip, and small puckers or tubercles on the upper
part of the larger whorl. The colour of these shells is various;
some being a pale buff, others a shaded chestnut brown, and some
nearly black.</p>

<p>A pretty little white <i>Columbella</i>, common here, used to be
much collected by the female aborigines, for making necklaces; some
of which were several yards long, formed of these little shells
neatly bored, and strung closely on kangaroo sinews, and were worn
by their sable owners twisted many times round the neck, and
hanging low over the breast.</p>

<p>The shell which used to be hailed with the cry of greatest
triumph at its capture, was a <i>Volute</i>; a fine, smooth, heavy,
important-looking shell, which made the smaller fry in our baskets
comparatively insignificant. Its usual size was about three inches
or more in length, by about one and a half in breadth; its colour a
pale buff or nankin colour, and this softly clouded with dim
purple, and marked most singularly with fine brown zig-zag lines
forming deep points and angles; the symmetry and connection of
these delicate, yet bold and distinct pencillings being most
curious. The inner part of the shell, which has three plaits on the
columella, is of a deeper shade of buff, and the whole shell is
finely polished and very ornamental. I have in England seen a
figure of it, or one very similar, in the coloured plates of a
conchological work; but the artist evidently had not enjoyed my
good fortune in seeing perfect and live shells, for it was a very
sorry portrait of my favourite. The animal itself bears the same
colours and marking as its shell, but even brighter.</p>

<p><i>Cypraea castanea</i> was not unfrequently found; and a pretty
buff-coloured <i>Ancillaria</i> was one of the commonest shells in
the collections I used to receive from this place years ago,
although when rambling on the beaches myself, I did not frequently
find it.</p>

<p>One species of Cone was all we had to represent that splendid
family; nor was this one a very brilliant specimen, being usually
small, from one to two inches long, of a dull ash colour,
irregularly clouded with reddish brown.</p>

<p>I think I have now enumerated all the shells, or very nearly so,
which are found at Swan Port. In addition to shells, several
beautiful kinds of corallines were frequently thrown up in great
quantities; but, after becoming dry, my "treasures of the deep" in
this department always fell to pieces, from, as I imagined, the
drying-up of the slender animal threads which passed through and
connected the joints during life. Some of these corallines were
snow-white, others tinged with pink or green, and all most delicate
and beautiful; one might fancy that the tricksy sea-sprites had
been trying to model some of our upper-world moss and joint grasses
with the sculpturesque materials of their ocean caves.</p>

<p>Several species of <i>Echinus</i>, too, visited us occasionally,
the commonest being brown and nearly globular, with short thin
spines. Another kind, less often found, was of a flatter shape,
from one and a half to three inches across, greenish or purple in
colour, and covered with strong pointed quill-like spines half an
inch long. The third and rarest species closely resembled the
<i>Echinus mammillatus</i> (fossil) of the English chalk formation
in the general form and the large tubercles on the shell; the
spines were large shelly tubes, the size of a wheat straw,
sometimes an inch long, and the same thickness from end to end,
moving upon the tubercles as on a pivot.</p>

<p>Some of the Star-fish here were gigantic, many measuring above a
foot across; great, thick, solid, slimy, long-armed creatures, that
I found most difficult to preserve (from the quantity of moist
animal matter they contained), unless when they had been thoroughly
sun-dried on the warm sands. These had eight or ten arms each;
other smaller species had only five, and one kind had no arms at
all, but was in form a pentagon or hexagon, with the points
protruding but very slightly; the whole covered on both sides with
shelly plates and tubercles, and, when freshly caught, of brilliant
colours, orange, scarlet, and purple and varying in size from one
inch across, to two or three.</p>

<p>The sponges too, which I frequently found, were very singular;
sometimes a great mass of porous, prickly, slimy stuff lay upon the
beach, glowing in the most vivid scarlet hue that can be imagined;
and when I first saw these fiery appearances, I used to hasten
towards them, wondering what new prize awaited me. One day, having
carried a thick rolled pudding-shaped mass home, in hopes of
preserving it in its brilliant colour, I took it to the fresh water
to wash and squeeze out the slimy matter, and whilst so employed a
severe sensation of prickly tingling and stinging attacked my
hands, which became red and inflamed, and the symptoms rapidly
extended up my arms. A young relative who was helping me suffered
in a similar manner, and we felt rather apprehensive as to the
consequences of our experiment; but fortunately the discomfort of
feeling for a day or two as if we had been stung by nettles, was
the only ill result we experienced; and I have never since
attempted to take such liberties with the red rolled pudding
sponges. Indeed, my adventure with this individual sponge reminded
me very forcibly of Miss Edgeworth's story of Rosamond and the blue
jar; for the splendid colour that had so dazzled me seemed to
reside wholly in that very slimy staff I had taken such pains to
squeeze out, and when that was gone and my sponge dry, it was
merely a dull brown!</p>

<p>For some time our own future destination remained uncertain,
until it was at length arranged that Mr. Meredith should purchase a
small estate of about 1200 acres, situated seven miles inland,
north of Cambria, and adjoining, or rather forming, one corner of
the Meredith estate. The situation of "Spring Vale" had won our
admiration, although as yet the land remained in a state of nature,
and required a great outlay of money and labour to render it
habitable or profitable.</p>

<p>In May, 1841, we temporarily set up our vagrant household gods
in a house then vacant at Riversdale, which, being within three
miles of Spring Vale, formed a convenient abode for us during the
erection of our own cottage. Once again I was busily and pleasantly
occupied in making a new place look as much like an old home as
possible. The favourite pictures of dear old faces soon peopled the
strange walls with loved familiar looks. The rooms were large and
good, and though at first not too amply furnished, had a cheerful
and cosy aspect. Our little pet soon after our removal began to
trot about, and the sweet little voice, as musical as a bird's,
that went humming and carolling from room to room was, to parental
ears, a sound that would make any spot charming.</p>

<p>And now began my real experience of colonial housewifery and its
attendant troubles, although these did not prove very distressing,
and nearly all originated in servants; but, as I dislike hearing my
neighbours' long narratives of their domestics' delinquencies, I
shall not inflict a very minute detail of my individual sufferings
upon my own kind friends. Prisoner women servants are generally of
a far lower grade than the men, and at the time of which I now
write, Mrs. Bowden had not begun her admirable reformatory work
among them. My first prisoner nurse-girl was taken at random by our
agent in Hobarton, from among the herd of incorrigibles in the
female house of correction, or "Factory" as it is termed; and was
indeed a notable example:&mdash;<i>dirty</i>, beyond all imagining! she
drank rum, smoked tobacco, swore awfully, and was in all respects
the lowest specimen of womankind I ever had the sorrow to behold.
Before I had time to procure another, she drank herself into
violent fits, so that four men could not hold her from knocking
herself against the walls and floor, then went to the hospital, and
finally, got married!</p>

<p>Various fortune attended me after this memorable beginning, but
I never had such signal ill-luck again, and we have usually kept
our female servants longer than most other families; and when they
have left us, marriage has been the usual cause. One, a Highland
girl, I, in my too charitable innocence, believed to be really
good, virtuous, and honest, and truly repentant of her former
misdeeds: she was a kind nurse to our little boy, and a cheerful,
obliging servant; she remained with us six months, professing the
most devoted gratitude for our kindness to her, when, during an
illness which confined me to my bed, she took from beneath my
pillow the key of the store, and, with the assistance of the groom,
drank and otherwise disposed of some six or eight dozens of wine
and spirits. The effects of such extensive libations being soon
evident, the worthy pair were dismissed, the maid being sentenced
to six months' hard labour at the "washtubs" in the Factory, and
the man to a "chain-gang" on the roads for two years. My housemaid
was at the time in the "cells," suffering fourteen days solitary
imprisonment (or, as they term it, "<i>doing solitary</i>"), for
striking her fellow-servant, the nurse. She returned afterwards
much improved, and remained with us until she married. The
successor of my hopeful Highland protg was a short, clever,
brisk, good-tempered Yorkshire woman, who stayed with us a year and
a half, and then married comfortably. With such chances and changes
progressed my new household; but I have never since detected any
act of dishonesty in one of our servants, though all have been
prisoners. The offices of "cook" and "kitchen-maid" are here
generally filled by men, as cutting wood and carrying water we
considered to be too laborious for women.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith meanwhile was indefatigably industrious in the
improvement and civilization of our new place, "Spring Vale"&mdash;so
named from the bright springs of pure water rising in the low
lands. Early after breakfast every morning, often in winter while
the stars were yet shining in the sky, my husband rode or walked up
from Riversdale to direct and assist in the work going on, nor
returned to dinner until late in the evening; so that my days would
have been very lonely, had I not had my dear little boy to cheer
them. Still, these were days full of pleasant hopefulness, and we
looked forward with great delight to the completion of our plans,
and our final removal to our own snug home&mdash;the home in which we
purposed to live quietly through the remaining years of our sojourn
on this side of the globe.</p>

<p>But much had to be done even before the house could be begun.
Wheat was still ten shillings the bushel (the price during the
famine in New South Wales had been twenty-six shillings the
bushel), and we needed to have some of our own for the next year's
consumption and seed; May was nearly gone, and the next February
must see our first little crop ready for the sickle, on land which
as yet plough had never broken, and which was heavily timbered with
large gum-trees. To clear the ground was the first thing to be
done: oxen and implements were purchased, and men hired to fell the
trees, grub up the roots, and cut the ponderous trunks and branches
into lengths to form a "dead-wood fence," that is, a mass of timber
four or five feet thick, and five or six high, the lower part being
formed of the enormous trunks of trees, cut into logs six or eight
feet long, laid side by side, and the upper portion consisting of
the smaller branches skilfully laid over, or stuck down and
intertwisted.</p>

<p>A very old ruinous shepherd's hut served, when patched up, for
some of the labourers to live in, until the new stone one could be
built, and when this was finished, the old stonemason was to
commence our cottage. I believe that a large proportion of the
stone and brick buildings both in and around Swan Port are the work
of the same man&mdash;one of those thin, wiry, withered, erect old
people who look just the same for forty years together, never were
known to look young, and never seem to grow a month older; at all
events, I can see no difference in our old friend of the trowel
since he first began chipping the ironstone and dabbing the mortar
about in our service, nine years ago, although, when he began
working for us, I well remember feeling some misgivings as to his
living long enough to finish even the first building.</p>

<p>We had often visited and carefully noted the relative advantages
of several sites for our cottage, before making our final
selection, as we wished it to be sheltered from the prevailing high
winds, near the fresh water, and at no great distance from the
public road, which passed through our land, the shape of which was
triangular. A rocky range of high hills, or "the Tier," as it is
generally termed, forms the northern boundary; the "Swan," or "Big
River," the eastern; and the "Cygnet," or "Brushy" River, the
western; these two uniting at the south point. We finally decided
on placing our house on a rocky bank facing the south-east, at the
foot of which we purposed having our garden, whilst the stabling
and outhouses would occupy the higher level ground behind the
house.</p>

<p>I made innumerable plans, each seeming to me in its turn
perfectly unexceptionable, until my husband, with his awful
precision of compasses and calculation of "ways and means," ranged
in array against me, proved one after another their
impracticability. At last a partnership plan was concocted, to our
mutual satisfaction, combining comfort and economy with a
sufficient regard for appearance; and materials requisite for its
completion were carefully calculated and ordered. Some of these
consisted of what is here technically termed "sawed stuff" and
"split stuff by which is meant timber which is <i>sawn</i> into
regular forms and thicknesses, as flooring boards, joists, battens,
&amp;c., and that which is <i>split</i> into "posts and rails,"
slabs, or paling. Some of the species of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, or
gum-trees, are peculiarly adapted for splitting. The
peppermint-tree (<i>Eucalyptus piperita</i>) and the "Stringy Bark"
are remarkable for the perfectly straight grain which they often
exhibit, and are split with surprising evenness and regularity into
paling and boards for "weather-boarding" houses and other purposes,
in lengths of six or eight feet by one foot wide, and half or
one-third of an inch thick. The great height to which the trees
grow before the branches begin, leaves a large space free from
knots or twists of any kind; any curve in a tree renders it unfit
for splitting, but the crooked-grained wood is best for sawing,
being less liable to split whilst being worked or nailed. All
houses in the colony, with few exceptions, are roofed with split
shingles.</p>

<p>The species of gum-trees called "iron-bark" and "stringy-bark"
are extremely hard and, when well planed and polished, bear some
resemblance to oak, and are much and successfully used in colonial
shipbuilding; but the cedar of New South Wales, and the "Lightwood"
or "Blackwood" (<i>Acacia melanoxylon</i>) are used here for all
the ornamental parts of house-fittings, and, when nicely finished
and polished, are equal in appearance to mahogany, giving a far
neater aspect to a room than the painted doors, wainscots, and
window-frames used in middle-class houses in England. The lightwood
is a harder and more closely grained wood than the cedar; it is
also more finely marked, and is capable of a more perfect polish.
When growing, it is generally a very handsome tree, and the dense
foliage affords a better shade than most other Tasmanian forest
trees. It commonly attains the height of thirty or forty feet, but
in moist sheltered mountain gullies very far exceeds that size. I
have seen some upwards of a hundred feet high. The leaves are a
long oval in shape, of a dry dim texture, alike on both sides,
longitudinally veined, without any distinct midrib, and are of a
yellow green colour, which, with the round, compact, lumpish form
of the tree, gives it a slightly oak-like character in the distant
landscape, to the beauty of which a group, or a few single
lightwood trees, are a valuable addition.</p>

<p>The bark, too, is rough and compact, more like the trees of the
Old World than the riband-stripping smooth white trunks of the
gum-trees. The little round blossoms of palest yellow, which in
spring come out all over the tree, give a soft fresh bloomy aspect
to its evergreen garb, and perfume the air with their hawthorn
scent; when near an apiary, they are ever "musical with bees," and
seem to yield the busy little creatures an ample store both of wax
and honey. One singularly handsome tree of this kind we marked for
preservation, amidst the doomed throng of less eligible residents
on the piece of scrub and forest destined to become our garden. The
walls of our cottage were to be built of the common "iron-stone" of
the country, quarried from the bank where it was to stand, the
cleavage of which very conveniently separates it into flat slabs of
all sizes and thicknesses, suitable for rough stone buildings; and,
when well fitted and cemented together, and neatly faced with cut
freestone at all the corners, door and window cases, &amp;c., it
makes a most substantial fabric. Our outer walls were twenty inches
thick, and the inner ones eighteen.</p>

<p>The grove of wattle-trees speedily disappeared from the bank,
around the growing cottage, excepting a few handdsome groups or
single trees reserved for ornament; and the various details of
quarrying, burning shells into lime, sawing, and carting, all went
briskly on.</p>

<p>The first field being once cleared, fenced, ploughed, and sown,
other land underwent the same transformation. I often vainly
interceded for the life of some noble tree, which, as its tall
kindred fell all around it, looked so grand and ornamental, and so
pleasing an object in the general clearance, that I would gladly
have preserved it; but the harbour which trees in the middle of
fields afford to the opossums, and the destructive, but most
beautiful, little parrots which abound here, was always urged
against me, and the death-doom was rarely averted, even by my most
eloquent pleading: still, both our lovely rivers being skirted by
forest land and fine belts of trees, besides the numbers which
adorned the unploughed marsh and sheep-run, amply redeemed our
pretty spot from the charge of harness, usually so well merited by
colonial farms.</p>

<p>Each time that I rode or walked up from Riversdale, some evident
improvement was visible, in clearing, fencing, draining, or
building; and, as spring advanced, the sheep and cattle feeding in
the deep, long, green grass of the marshes, and the pretty little
soft white lambs skipping about, looked like a bit of England. How
beautiful were our broad deep drains, with bright cold water
bubbling up in them from countless springs, and flowing generously
along in a never-failing stream! And how often we used to stand in
our green meadows, looking into them, and talking of the dry and
parched ground of our homes at Homebush and Bathurst, as a kind of
additional zest to our keen enjoyment of the inestimable blessings
of a temperate climate and abundance of pure water!</p>

<p>Perhaps my use of the common colonial term "marsh" may be
misunderstood at home, as I remember that I myself associated it at
first with the idea of a swamp; but a "marsh" here is what would in
England be called a meadow, with this difference, that in our
marshes, until partially drained, a growth of tea-trees
(<i>Leptospermum</i>) and rushes in some measure encumbers them;
but, after a short time, these die off, and are trampled down, and
a thick sward of verdant grass covers the whole extent: such is our
"marsh"&mdash;a fine meadow of 180 or 200 acres, and green in the driest
season. The open forest land skirts it on all sides, except where
fenced corn-fields intervene, so that the horses and cattle live
most luxuriously, in sunshine or shade, as they like best, as in
many parts of the "scrub" are groups of honeysuckle-trees, so dense
that even rain can scarcely penetrate them.</p>

<p>The honeysuckle-tree (<i>Banksia latifolia</i>) is so
unreasonably named, that I must not pass it by without a remark;
nor have I quite forgiven it for disappointing me by being so
<i>unlike</i> any sort or species of the sweet old flower whose
name it so unfittingly bears. I cannot remember any Old-World tree
to which I can in any way compare it: it might be pretty well
represented by one of the tall muff-like grenadier's caps, set on a
stick; the latter being the short trunk, and the cap the dark,
thick, solid-looking foliage of the tree. The leaves are rather
small, and generally of a dull rusty olive-green, except when the
young spring shoots cast a gleam of fresher colour over the sombre
mass. The blossoms form cones, which, when in full bloom, are much
the size and shape of a large English teazel, and are of a greenish
yellow; they are scentless, until the pollen is shed, when a faint
odour, not particularly pleasant, is just perceptible; but birds
and insects seem to discover honey in them. The honeysuckle trees
grow to about thirty feet in height, and often form fine groups in
the open landscape, as, when several grow together, their formal
outline is not preserved, and in hot weather they are valuable,
from the dense shade they afford. The wood is of a singularly
fibrous texture, and is used to make "knees" in boat-building and
some other purposes, but is not very much prized for fire-wood; for
the latter purpose, wattle (<i>Acacia</i>) and shroak
(<i>Casuarina</i>) are most valued, and many of the gum-tree woods
burn well and brightly.</p>

<p>I have never seen the lovely common wattles grow so luxuriantly,
or form such ornamental trees and groves, as at Spring Vale; and I
often thought, if I could give a sly rub to Aladdin's glorious old
lamp, and order the obedient Genii to transport some of the
graceful golden-fringed trees into certain pretty gardens and
shrubberies at home, how enraptured the beholders would be! Nothing
can be more beautiful than some of them; tall and elegant, from
twenty to forty feet high, thick with their delicate "sensitive
plant" foliage, feathery and pendulous; and covered, from the very
summit to the branches that bend and sweep the ground, with the
bright canary-coloured blossoms. Canopies and roofs of gold and
jewels, such as dazzled our fancy in old fairy-tales, are no longer
fables, when, pushing aside some heavy down-bending bough, we creep
beneath, and stand within the natural bower of one of these
exquisite trees in full bloom.</p>

<p>A very beautiful species of pine, or rather, I imagine, a
cypress, grows in and near the river-beds here, in great abundance
and luxuriance, varying from nine to twenty-five feet in height; I
know not know its proper name, but here it is called "the brushy
pine." It forms a perfect cone of verdure, narrowing to a point at
the top, the deep rich green being sometimes tinged with a bluish
shade, almost like the bloom on a grape. Not a portion of the stem
is visible in a well-grown tree of this kind; but the whole is a
compact mass of foliage, more perfect in form than the most
accurately-clipped box or yew of an antique garden, and necessarily
far more beautiful, from such being the natural shape, with the
slender terminal sprays all uninjured. The cones are small, and
clustered together in brown knobs or bunches close to the branches.
Plants are entirely raised from seed, which grow well in moist and
shady situations. Our river banks are in many places absolute
groves of these very handsome trees, of all ages and heights; but
most beautiful when, as is frequently the case, they form nice
family groups of one, two, or more tall middle-aged trees, with a
rising generation of symmetrical young ones clustered around
them.</p>

<p>The spring and summer of 1841-2 wore away, and our home was
progressing, but much too slowly for our wishes; for it may well be
believed how eager we were to remove thither, and put an end to the
weary daily travel to and fro, and my long lonely days away from
all that interested me, save my children, for we had now two.</p>

<p>Sometimes I added to my little collection of portraits of the
pretty native flowers, or improved myself in sketching gum-trees,
which I found demanded far greater care in their delineation, even
in my slight pencil sketches, than I had at first been disposed to
accord them: a gaunt straggling tree, that will persist in showing
all its twisted elbows, and bare Briarean arms, with only tufts of
leaves at the fingers' ends, is quite a different affair from a
round compact oak or elm, decently apparelled in a proper quantity
of foliage. A kind of <i>Eucalyptus</i>, with long drooping leaves,
called the "Weeping Gum," is the most elegant of the family, and is
generally very well dressed. A group of these, which gracefully
drooped over and beside a blacksmith's forge, near us, always won
my admiration as I passed them on my way to Spring Vale, where some
of the <i>Eucalyptus</i> trees growing on the rich lowlands are
really very beautiful, and would be deemed so even amidst the
magnificent patriarchal oaks of an English park; large, lofty, with
dense glossy foliage, and finely grown, they have more the
character of a Portugal laurel grown into a forest tree, than
anything else I remember at Home.</p>

<p>Sometimes, but very rarely, we were so fortunate as to obtain
the loan of a new book, and great was the delight of such an
acquisition, for our reading was usually limited to the old
familiar volumes of our own small library, and the English
newspapers, with which the kindness of our home friends supplied
us. The regular transmission of the wise and witty "Examiner" has
been a source of great enjoyment to us in our exile, and serves to
keep us comparatively acquainted with the doings of the civilized
world. Reviews of charming books that one cannot procure, and
notices of glorious pictures that one will never see, are truly
often provoking enough; but yet it is pleasant to receive such
renewed proofs that the great and good of the Old World are still
labouring in their vocation for the delight of millions who, more
fortunate than ourselves in this particular, can and do enjoy in
reality what we now but dimly imagine.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the summer we joined the pic-nic parties from
Cambria; and sometimes, after exhausting my small store of the
simple airs and merry old tunes&mdash;my husband's favourites&mdash;that I
could play from memory, I resolutely dived among my old music
books, loaded the piano-desk, and filled up an evening with
somewhat lame revivals of the strains of other, although not
happier, days; but all these were indulgences in my usual sewing,
nursing, housekeeping life.</p>

<p>At first I found the business of the store-room the most novel
of my household duties, and the weekly or semi-weekly distribution
of rations the least pleasant of them, as, besides our own hired
farm-servants&mdash;who of course received their supplies from us&mdash;there
were the sawyers, stonemasons, carpenters, drainers, and fencers,
all of whom we had to supply with flour, meat, tea, sugar, salt,
soap, tobacco and "slops" (i.e., shirts, trowsers, jackets,
&amp;c.); so that accurate accounts must be kept, and I confess I
did not much admire this indispensable huckster's shop affair, the
business of which also included the giving out materials for the
building and articles for farm use, such as nails of all kinds,
rope, files, glass, glue, oil, paint, whiting, turpentine,
blankets, bed-tick, rugs, wine, and other commodities; but all this
is (or rather was at the time in question) a matter of course in a
settler's establishment.</p>

<p>Several small coasting vessels find continual employment in the
trade between Swan Port and Hobarton, in conveying the settler's
produce to the town, and bringing back the supplies they require.
The land transit being all but impracticable for a cart, no goods
are conveyed by it, except when some adventurous hawker succeeds in
forcing his weary horses across the mountain barrier; and
everything we require, from a cask of wine or ton of sugar, down to
a sheet of pins or a pair of gloves, must be brought by water to
Swansea, and thence home in our carts.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Since the above was written, the little settlement of Swansea
has so far increased in importance, that two good stores of the
"general" class are now established there, and appear to carry on a
considerable trade in grocery, drapery, ironmongery, habeerdashery,
confectionary, crockery, glass, timber, slop clothing, ale, porter,
salt beef and other provisions, flour, and <i>et ceteras</i>
infinite.]</p>

<p>Our circle of society at Swan Port was limited to two or three
individuals beyond our own family, although the population of the
district is numerically large, and comprises many industrious and
thriving settlers, who were our very good and respected neighbours,
and whose neat well-conducted farms are examples to most other
rural districts in the island. We had no inducement to go from our
home, except to our father's; and of course family visitings to and
fro formed a regular and very pleasant part of our weekly
duties.</p>

<p>The quantity of snakes which were destroyed at Spring Vale
daring this summer was truly alarming; scarcely a day passed
without Mr. Meredith's telling me on his return home that one, two,
or more had been killed by himself or the men. One day he had gone
out rabbit-shooting there with Dr. Alexander (28th Begiment), then
visiting us, accompanied by our old pointer and a favourite
spaniel. The latter, whilst hunting busily about, suddenly uttered
a short yelp, as if slightly hurt, and the next moment Dr. A. shot
a large black snake, which it was found had bitten her in the nose;
so that excision of the part was impossible. The poor little
creature went on hunting for a few minutes, when she seemed to grow
dizzy, and reeled about; then lay down, trying several times to get
up and hunt, but very soon she became violently convulsed and sick,
then foamed at the mouth, and died in less than twenty-five minutes
from the time she was bitten.</p>

<p>A short time previously to this, Mr. Meredith was on the jury at
an inquest held on a poor shepherd, servant to a settler in the
neighbourhood, who, whilst out one day with some of his employer's
family, saw a large black snake raising itself to attack him and
made a blow at it with a rotten stick, which broke off short, and
the snake, enraged but not hurt, bit his wrist. No remedies were
attempted, but the poor fellow continued his occupation, till,
feeling too ill to proceed, he went to a hut in the neighbourhood,
where one of his fellow-servants lived, who was married. These good
people did all that their kind feeling suggested, or their means
allowed, for his comfort; they laid him in their only bed, and set
up tending him all night, but he became rapidly worse and
insensible, and early in the morning died.</p>

<p>Such terrible evidence of the black snake's mortal venom was not
calculated to diminish my horror of the whole fearful tribe, and
often in walking through long tussock grass or low scrub I have
shrunk aghast, as my foot fell on some round stick, or a rustling
in the dead leaves came with a boding sound upon my ear.</p>

<p>One day as I sat at home sewing, with my eldest child playing
about on the floor, our favourite cat jumped in through an open
window, and began pawing and tossing something under a chair.
Little George immediately went towards her, and seemed highly
diverted, crawling nearer and nearer, and trying with his baby-talk
to attract my attention to his playfellow: looking down, I saw what
I supposed to be a lizard, and being vexed with the cat for hurting
the harmless little thing, drove her away, when, to my horror,
there lay a snake, writhing and curling most actively; so, holding
the child and the cat both away, I ordered the unwelcome guest to
be very summarily despatched.</p>

<p>So many "narrow escapes" from snakes are related here, that the
comparative rarity of serious accidents is perhaps the most
remarkable. Whilst at Cambria, my nursemaid, a free girl from
London, who had never seen a snake, was one day crossing the
court-yard with the child in her arms, when she saw what she
fancied was a large eel gliding along; and, calling to the cook
that one of his fish had got away, was on the point of seizing it
in her hand, when the man screamed out to her that it was a snake,
and so indeed it was, a very large one. They are apparently fond of
lurking in quiet sly comers near the house, perhaps for the purpose
of catching mice; and, to their other unpleasant propensities, I
must add a <i>penchant</i> for quail. Mr. Meredith, in walking to
Spring Vale one day, was passing quickly through some long tussock
grass, and saw a large black snake swiftly and silently gliding
along, with its glittering eyes fixed on some low object which it
seemed eagerly pursuing, without heeding his approach. The next
moment he saw a brace of quail run out from the spot and take wing,
but the snake had vanished before he could pick up a stick to
destroy it. I heard the other day, from good authority, of a snake
which was killed having four parrots quite entire, and scarcely
ruffled in plumage, taken from its stomach; the parrots in question
being, it should be added, each about the size of a thrush.</p>

<p>The quail, the sole representative here, save the rarely-coming
migratory snipe, of the delicious game of the Old World, is a
delicate little bird about half the size of the partridge, with
somewhat similar beautiful brown plumage, but they are not
generally numerous.</p>

<p>The wattle birds (<i>Anthochaera &mdash;&mdash;?</i>) are a less rare
delicacy, and I now think them very nice, although their flavour is
too peculiar to be wholly liked at first. They are extremely
pretty; about the size of a blackbird; the back plumage is dark
gray, tipped with white, with a long tail of the same colours; the
under part is lighter, with a bright shade of amber on the breast,
and a tinge of the same colour blending in other parts with the
gray. The graceful head is adorned with a pair of long pendant
ear-drops or "wattles," formed of a bright orange-coloured bag-like
membrane, about an inch and a half long, and a quarter of an inch,
or rather more, in width, pale in colour next the head, but
deepening at the end to the hue of the <i>Ecremocarpus</i>
blossoms. These, as the active merry birds dance about the
branches, and twist their heads in all kinds of elegant arch
coquettish attitudes, remind me of the long gold earrings of some
pretty, vain, fine lady. Their common note seems to be four or five
syllables of some unknown, rather guttural language, which I have
in vain tried to pronounce, so cannot be expected to spell, but it
sounds something like "cockaty-rucki! cockaty-rucki!" Their tongue
is very long, and, being divided at the end like a thin hair
pencil, is well adapted for extracting the honey from the
<i>Eucalyptus</i> blossoms which forms their chief food, and their
flavour partakes very strongly of the powerful aromatic property of
the trees. The wattle-birds are not always equally plentiful, but
about one year in three they positively abound.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith used sometimes to go out before breakfast, and in a
few minutes shoot a dozen within fifty yards of the house. When
plucked, they are found, if in proper condition, to be enveloped in
a thick layer of yellow fat, and in roasting amply "baste"
themselves. They are dressed entire, the same as woodcocks, and
form a valuable addition to the country bill of fare, which cannot
generally be accused of having too much variety.</p>

<p>The house of Riversdale, which we now occupied, being, with the
adjacent water-mill and other buildings, the centre of a large
agricultural farm, I had not many nice wild-wood walks near home.
The road leading to Spring Vale, which for the first mile passed
over a sandy forest tract, was my favourite, as the "Bush" on
either side afforded abundance of wild flowers. In spring several
kinds of white <i>Epacris</i> came out in bloom, and the shrubs,
bearing different sorts of yellow pea-blossoms, abounded: some
richly tinged and veined with scarlet or brown, their foliage,
consisting of little more than bare green spines, as difficult to
gather as gorse itself; others had leaves spined at each point,
whilst many more were rather less repulsive in their manners, yet
without being very inviting.</p>

<p>A more amiable family were the <i>Acacias</i>, or, as called
here, "wattles," so named originally, I conceive, from several of
the genus being much used for "wattling" fences or huts. A "wattle
and dab" hut is formed, in a somewhat Robinson Crusoe style, of
stout stakes driven well into the ground, and thickly interlaced
with the tough lithe wattle-branches, so as to make a strong
basket-work, which is then dabbed and plastered over on both sides
with tenacious clay, mortar, and, finally, thatched. I have also
heard of a refractory wife being occasionally subjected by her
liege lord to a process of "wattling," but this I imagine implies
an application of the acacia boughs of a totally different nature
to that above described, although, as I have been assured, it
proves, in some cases, singularly efficacious. All the acacias bear
pretty, soft, yellow fringe-blossoms; but it were needless to
describe them minutely, as, long even ere I left England, the
species most common here were to be found in every greenhouse or
conservatory.</p>

<p>One almost microscopic white flower (<i>Leucopogon &mdash;&mdash;</i>),
growing on a low shrub, was very beautiful when closely examined,
each tiny petal, scarcely the size of a small pin's head, being
exquisitely fringed with short white filaments. The bright
geranium-coloured <i>Kennedia Prostrata</i> crept along the ground,
its rusty olive-green trifid leaves being seldom noticed until, on
stooping to pick up the glowing little pea-flower, we found out the
far-spread net-work of stems and leaves belonging to it.</p>

<p>The gay clustering wattle blossoms were, whilst they lasted, my
usual substitute for the dear buttercups and daisies that fill
little hands at Home. There was, certainly, a thin, lanky-looking,
white Aster, which I tried to call a daisy, and the <i>Richea
glauca</i>, with its round yellow ball of florets, I often gathered
for my little boy, completing his small handful with the really
pretty Australian hare-bell, as blue as his own sunny eyes, and the
gay wild pink convolvulus, not brighter than his cheeks; but even
these seemed sorry substitutes for the dear old cowslips and
primroses, buttercups and daisies, woodbines and foxgloves, and the
thousand and one sweet and lovely flowers that English country
children revel in.</p>

<p>The low bushes of a small species of <i>Casuarina</i>, that grew
beside my oft-traversed path to Spring Vale, were tenanted by a
curious kind of parasitic plant; and I bestowed upon it sundry
minute investigations, in the vain hope of discovering its name and
family connections. Its multitudinous, slender, thread-like stems,
ravelled, and twisted, and woven together in hopeless entanglement,
spreading over, and round, and through the casuarina bushes, were
always traceable to one small disc or foot, fastened to a branch,
smaller discs being attached at intervals, to other limbs of the
victim, until the devouring little climber reached the summit of
the bush, and spread abroad its slight tendril arms to lay hold of
some loftier support. The stems were seldom thicker than sewing
cotton, and destitute of leaves, but very minute white starry
flowers, less than small pins' heads, made microscopic
constellations all amongst the mazy coil, and were duly succeeded
by little, long, oval-shaped berries, about one-fifth of an inch
long. I have seen several species of this kind of native parasite
since, but all are of a much larger description, covering trees of
moderate height so entirely as to hide and destroy them, and
causing them to present a most strange and often grotesque
appearance; these creepers have stems like thick cord or rope,
twisted and knotted strongly together, and so tough as with some
difficulty to be cut or broken. They are nearly, if not quite,
destitute of foliage, and bear round berries, like those of the
bryony at Home, sometimes as large as good grapes. Some persons,
with more approach to reason than most of the colonial terms can
boast, have named these plants "native mistletoe."</p>

<p>One of the loveliest climbing plants of this, or indeed of any
other country, is the native Clematis (<i>C. blanda</i>), which
joins to a luxuriant growth of handsome foliage the most abundant
and graceful display of blossoms that I have seen in any of the
beautiful tribe. The flowers are large and quite white, growing in
full handsome clusters, thickly placed, and making the most
exquisite garlands imaginable, when a single stem can be culled by
itself; but in its lavish and luxuriant wild growth, it spreads
over the near bushes, trees, or ferns, in such a rich close mass of
clustering flowers and intertwisted leaves, that I have often found
it easier to gather a mat large enough for a mantle than to
disentangle a wreath for George's little straw hat. The scent, too,
is very delicious, and the starry heads of feathery seeds in autumn
are only less beautiful than the summer flowers.</p>

<p>A dwarf species of clematis (<i>C. gentianoides</i>) grew
plentifully on a stony hill between Riversdale and Spring Vale,
reminding me pleasantly of the pretty little white wood anemone of
England. The single white flowers, on stems five or six inches
high, appear on small roots with bright green leaves; they are very
delicate and fragrant, and would probably improve or become double
by culture.</p>

<p>Once, as we were driving to Cambria, I saw at a short distance
from the road what seemed to me a bright blue silk handkerchief
spread over a tall shrub, and, on alighting to investigate the
mystery, discovered, for the first time, my now familiar friend,
the most beautiful Comesperma (<i>C. volubilis</i>), whose
exquisite gleaming blossoms formed a perfect cover to the bush they
had climbed over. The small winged flowers are produced in such
abundance, that the green stems scarcely show at all, merely
forming an intertwisted and netted groundwork for the dainty
broidery of living sapphires which they support. Often, when I have
gathered chaplets of this most exquisite creeper, I have wished I
could transfer them to the glossy hair of some of my dear young
countrywomen, and displace their mimic coronals of cambric and wire
with my bright flowers of the wild wood. The chief use I have put
them to has been to adorn my baby's caps; and between the
lace-borders, one or two slender tendrils of comesperma, covered
with blossoms, excelled all the ribbon that ever was woven.</p>

<p>The summer of this year was particularly dry, and most of the
watercourses were empty, save here and there where deep pools
occurred in their stony beds. One day a slight shower had fallen,
and I was hesitating whether it were wise for us to go for our
usual walk, as the long reedy leaves of the cutting grass, and
other plants, hold the moisture, and might wet our feet; when a
young relative, then visiting us, earnestly exclaimed&mdash;"Oh! but
<i>I</i> know where we can have a delightful walk, if we go down
the lane, and then turn and go up the bed of the river; it is sure
to be nice and dry there!"</p>

<p>Truly, thought I, we <i>are</i> at the Antipodes!</p>

<p>Sheep-shearing in November, hot midsummer weather at Christmas,
the bed of a river the driest walk, and corn harvest in February,
were things strangely at variance with my Old-World notions. The
result of our first harvest from thirteen acres was highly
satisfactory, and I went up to see the little wheat-stack, and
surveyed it on all sides with more real genuine pleasure than those
twenty times its size have given me since.</p>

<p>The satisfaction with which we urged on our works of improvement
at Spring Vale was at this time sadly checked by the distressing
and sudden death of a worthy man, formerly a prisoner, who had for
many years been a good industrious servant in the family, and was
now employed with others in "grubbing" a piece of new land which
was heavily timbered. One of the ponderous trees, of eight or nine
feet girth was, in the usual way, severed from its main supports by
a great trench being dug round the foot of the tree, and the roots
chopped through; the huge trunk was just ready to fall, and Mr.
Meredith, who was there observing the work, saw it giving way, and
called to the men to jump out of the trench, which they did, and
were all perfectly safe; but this one poor fellow, although an "old
hand" at such labour, in some strange confusion of mind, stepped
back again, exactly under the falling tree, which, gaining rapid
impetus as it came, fell, before there was a chance of snatching
him from destruction, and the whole ponderous mass crushed him to
death instantaneously. The tree was sawn through on either side as
quickly as possible, and the unfortunate man's body extricated, but
life must have become extinct in the very moment of the frightful
accident.</p>

<p>The comparative rarity of such terrible calamities in new
countries where "clearing" is perpetually going on, is even more
remarkable than their occasional occurrence; but the imprudence of
persons who pursue these needful but certainly dangerous tasks,
alone, is a wilful risk of life. Not long ago we heard of a
horrible instance of this. A poor industrious man went from home
one morning, as usual, to the piece of ground he was clearing at
some distance; but, on his not returning at night, his wife
supposed he had gone on some business he had to attend to a few
miles off, and no alarm was felt about him until the lapse of
several days, when, on a search being made, his dead body was found
on his own clearing, with one leg broken by a heavy tree which had
fallen on it. The poor creature had evidently made the most
desperate efforts to extricate himself; his hands and face were
torn and lacerated, and the broken leg almost dragged off in his
attempts to get free, but all had been in vain: he must have died
in a state of agony, starvation, and despair, absolutely frightful
to imagine; whilst if a fellow labourer had been near to saw the
tree through, all, save the fracture of the leg, would have been
avoided.</p>

<p>Many disheartening reports of the disastrous state of affairs in
New South Wales had reached us since we came to Van Diemen's Land,
and the non-appearance of various sums of money in rents, bills,
&amp;c., which were falling due to us, supplied unpleasing
corroboration of the rumours; but we were totally unprepared for
the discovery which now overwhelmed us&mdash;that some of the
insolvencies in Sydney involved the loss of all we owned in that
colony. Until now the thought of returning to England in the course
of ten or twelve years had abode with us like a pleasant, although
rather distant, prospect, which Hope's telescopic vision ever
brought nearer and more distinctly before us; but at this cruel
blow the fairy-picture shrank and faded away into the smallest and
dimmest shadow of its former self, and ever since Hope seems to
show it to us only through the wrong end of the telescope!</p>

<p>Even in so slight a description of a new country as mine is,
some notice of the aboriginal inhabitants may naturally be
expected; and although from personal observations I know nothing
respecting them, Mr. Meredith's long and disastrous experience of
their character and habits enables me to give some particulars,
which may possibly tend to a more correct estimate being
entertained at Home of the strife so long existing between them and
the colonists.</p>

<p>Seven or eight years before my arrival in this colony, the
aborigines had been removed to Flinder's Island in Bass Straits,
where large and comfortable dwellings were erected for them, and
they were well clothed, fed, and instructed at the expense of the
Colonial Government, under the care of a resident medical
superintendent, until the year 1847, when his Excellency Sir W. T.
Denison, our present lieutenant-governor, imagining that they might
be rendered more happy, and be more efficiently superintended here,
caused those remaining to be brought again to the colony, and a new
establishment has been accordingly formed on the west shore of
D'Entrecasteaux' channel, where they now are. Of the charitable and
humane feelings which actuated Sir W. Denison, but one opinion can
be entertained. How far he was justified in gratifying them by
making this change is a separate question, as the colonists,
especially those who had formerly suffered such fearful experience
of the aboriginal ferocity and cruelty, were strenuously opposed to
the measure&mdash;on the grounds that every adult man among the natives
had been actively engaged in many, some of them in hundreds, of
most brutal and unprovoked murders, and that in all probability a
return to their old haunts would lead to a renewal of the horrors
which, since their removal, have been unknown, but which in former
years rendered a residence in the colony one long series of alarms,
suffering, and loss, with the daily imminent peril of a frightful
death.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith's experience of the habits and deeds of the
aborigines extends over many years, and from the notes he has made
for me, and our frequent conversations on the subject, I shall
compile this chapter as nearly as possible in his own words. Many a
time, contrary to our usual primitive country hours, has midnight
found us still seated by our glowing hearth; I intent on hearing,
and he relating the horrors, and terrors, and hair-breadth escapes
of his younger days in the colony, when every bush within
spear-throw of the house was a source of danger, and to stir beyond
the door-sill unarmed was nothing short of <i>felo de se</i>. The
plain relation of easily-proved matters of fact may perhaps tend to
dissipate erroneous ideas as to the original enmity between the
settlers and the aborigines, who for some years after the
colonization of the island lived peaceably together, the natives
visiting the houses and stations of the colonists in the same
amicable manner as the blacks in New South Wales do now&mdash;coming and
going as it pleased them&mdash;"camping" near to the homes of the white
people, with the free consent of the latter&mdash;receiving presents of
food and other things, and not manifesting any jealous or angry
feelings.</p>

<p>In considering this subject it should also be borne in mind who
and what the early "settlers" were. They were neither pirates nor
robbers, as were many of the early dwellers in, and usurpers of,
new countries in days of yore; but British farmers and country
gentlemen, not usually considered a desperately ferocious and
blood-thirsty class, nor by any means disposed to commence
hostilities against quiet unoffending people, such as the Tasmanian
aborigines originally appeared; but purposing to till their ground
and feed their sheep without injury or molestation to the natives,
both parties being at that time so few in number, that the quantity
of land occupied by the English, and partially thinned of the wild
animals useful to the blacks, was comparatively speaking so small,
as not to be felt by them as a deprivation, even had they not
gained rather than lost by the change, in the food given them by
the settlers. No murderous propensities displayed themselves until
the arrival amongst them of a notable leader in crime and cruelty,
under whose guidance they committed their first open murder; and
ever after they seemed to hunger and thirst after the lives of the
colonists, whom they persecuted and killed with relentless and
unquenchable ferocity, as the few instances I shall cite, out of
many more that I could enumerate, will sufficiently prove. The
following passages I quote either from Mr. Meredith's own notes,
written at my request, or from my own transcriptions of his
narratives as related to me.</p>

<div style="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%">
<p>"Considerable error prevails with respect to the cause of the
hostility between the aborigines of this island and the white
population, the general impression being that it arose in
consequence of unprovoked acts of aggression and violence on the
part of the whites, than which nothing can be further from the
truth. The deadly enmity exhibited by the natives, through a series
of years, towards the colonists and their servants was, in the
first instance, unprovoked by the white population. I remember
distinctly the first act of violence of that long and fearful
tragedy&mdash;it was perpetrated by the natives, under the direction of
'Mosquito,' a native of Sydney, who had been tried there for the
cruel murder of a white woman. By an act of mistaken humanity on
the part of the Sydney Government, Mosquito was reprieved from the
gallows, and sent to this island, where he was set at liberty, and
suffered to roam about unmolested. At first the natives here showed
some jealousy towards him, but they ultimately became friendly, and
gave him a gin, or wife, named 'Gooseberry.' Mosquito generally
divided his time between them and the white people, roaming the
bush with them in the summer, and living during the winter in
Hobarton, usually called 'the camp,' in those days. Constant
friendly intercourse took place between the two races until
November, 1823, when the Oyster Bay tribe, having Mosquito at their
head, committed a cool and unprovoked murder at the stock station
of Mr. Sylas Gatehouse, at Grindstone Bay, on the east coast.</p>

<p>"Three men were at the station at the time, John Radford, and
Mormer (a native of Otaheite), Mr. Gatehouse's servants, and
Holyoake, a servant of my father's, who had been for some time in
the colonial hospital in Hobarton, and, being pronounced
convalescent, was on his way to his masters house; but having
travelled about sixty miles, and being still in a weak state of
health, he was staying at this hut a few days to rest, being still
thirty miles from home. A short time ago, whilst on my way to town,
I passed the night at the public-house which is kept by Radford, at
little Swan Port. I then took down from his lips the following
account of the whole affair:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'In November, 1823, I was in charge of stock for Mr. Gatehouse.
One Thursday morning a party of blacks came to the hut, with
Mosquito as chief. He brought me a tin pot from a deserted hut in
my charge, as he said, <i>lest any of the black fellows should
steal it</i>. They encamped at Grindstone Bay, and remained quiet
until the Saturday after. In the mean time, Mosquito came into our
hut, and got Holyoake to shave him. The tribe consisted of about
seventy-five, and until Saturday morning they all employed
themselves as usual, in hunting, fishing, &amp;c. On Saturday
morning they were having a corrobbory, dancing and singing.
Holyoake, Mormer, and I went to the sheep-yards to part some sheep;
whilst there, Mosquito called to Mormer to join him on the opposite
side of the creek, and Mormer went over to him. When we were thus
divided, the natives that were on the same side of the creek as we
were picked up their spears*, and moved towards the hut; those on
the other side doing the same.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The aborigines, when they wished to appear
unarmed, had a habit of walking without any weapon in their hands,
but very adroitly trailing their spears, which they held fast by
their toes, along the ground after them, to be picked up at any
moment they were required.]</p>

<p>"'During this movement, Holyoake and myself stood between the
natives and the hut, to which we hastened, and arrived first, when,
missing our guns, I called to Mormer to ask if he had removed the
guns, as they were not there. He said "No," and hurried towards the
hut, being then about fifty yards from it, the natives following
him. These movements brought us all together at the hut, on one
side of which was a deep creek; on another side was a brush fence;
and on the third stood the natives, with a space of ten yards left
clear, through which was our only chance of escape, as it was now
plain to us that they meant mischief, and were trying to close in
the open space. We had some valuable kangaroo dogs, and seeing
Mosquito loosing them, I called out to him, "Don't take our dogs
away!" His reply was, "I shall do as I like, now." We all then made
a run; as I was passing the corner of the fence, Black Jack speared
me in the side. After the start I never saw Mormer again; he must
have been killed at once. I continued running for seven or eight
hundred yards, when I stopped to pull my boots off; I then saw
Holyoake within fifty yards of me: he called to me to "pull a spear
out of him." I returned and pulled out the spear, but whilst doing
so, received another in my thigh, which I pulled out, and we ran
together; I often waiting for Holyoake. We ran thus for some six
hundred yards, when the blacks overtook Holyoake, and some passed
him, running after me. The last I saw of Holyoake, he was standing
throwing sticks and stones to try to keep the natives off.</p>

<p>"'Seeing I could be of no service to him, I used my speed to
save my own life, and succeeded in escaping. It was the first time
I ever knew of an encounter between the blacks and whites, and I
had been living amongst them then for three years. I believe their
sole motive for the attack was the plunder of the hut. A man named
John Kemp had been killed at Grindstone Bay previously to our
occupying the station, which was in 1821. This man lived by
himself, in charge of the provisions and stores of a sealing party,
who, on their return, found him dead, with spear-wounds in his
body, and the stores all stolen.'</p>

<p>"Radford was chased about three miles by the natives, and made
his way to another stock station at Prosser's Plains, distant about
twenty-five miles from the scene of the murder. Thence the
intelligence was conveyed to Mr. Gatehouse, who lived at Pittwater,
and he at once proceeded with a body of armed men in chase of the
natives, to avenge the murder of his servant.</p>

<p>"The natives in the mean time moved on towards the north, and
reached my father's residence, where, as the late murder was
unknown, their appearance created no alarm. Mosquito, who spoke
tolerable English, came to our house and said he understood the
governor had given Mr. Meredith the land thereabouts, and requested
permission to encamp on it, promising that neither he nor any of
his tribe would frighten the cattle or commit any damage.
Permission was given, and the tribe remained encamped within two
hundred yards of my father's house for six or seven days, when they
departed, and went about two miles farther, to the house of Mr.
Talbot, who then lived at Oyster Bay, where the like favour was
sought by Mosquito, and permission to encamp was given by Mr.
Talbot's overseer.</p>

<p>"On the same evening, Mr. Gatehouse and his armed party arrived
in pursuit, but so eager was he to take vengeance for the death of
his servant, that he gave orders to 'fire' before he was within
gunshot of the blacks, and although all the guns were loaded with
buck-shot, not a single native was killed, nor do I believe one was
wounded. On the first discharge of the guns, the natives plunged
into a lagoon, on the banks of which they were encamped, and by
diving and swimming alternately, reached the opposite bank, and
escaped, with only the loss of their weapons (consisting of spears
and waddies) and the chief of their dogs. After this the tribe
separated into two parties, one of which attacked Mosquito and
wounded him severely, after which he came alone to the house of a
settler near us; and, although the murder was then well known, he
was suffered to go away unmolested.</p>

<p>"I have been somewhat minute in the detail of this transaction,
because it was in fact the commencement and the cause of that
deadly feud that ever after existed between the natives and the
white people on this side of the island; the former murdering
numbers of the latter, both old and young, male and female, with
indiscriminate fury, and, owing to their extreme cunning, activity,
and stealthy cat-like nature, retaliation was all but impossible. I
know of only <i>one</i> instance, in which a native lost his life
by the hands of a white man; the occasion was this:&mdash;my father had
lost three horses, and two men were dispatched to look for them.
During their search, they fell in with a tribe of natives, who
instantly gave chase; one of our servants was armed with a pistol,
and the other with a gun. The natives ran in two lines, one on
either side of the men, with the view of surrounding them, and when
parallel with them, began throwing their spears. The man who had
the pistol then cocked it, and pulled the trigger, but it missed
fire; on this the natives yelled, and ran with increased energy,
calling to each other to close the lines, and surround their
victims; at this juncture the man who had the gun fired at the
foremost native, and shot him dead; the others ran to their fallen
companion, and our men escaped, being then within 600 yards of a
farm-house, where they were reinforced by the farmer's sons, and
returned to the place where the black was shot. The other natives
had dragged his body into a hollow tree, and covered it with dead
wood, hut none of them were then to be seen. To complete my story,
I should add, that the horses were all found, but two of them were
dead, one having thirteen spears in its body, and the other only
one; but that one had penetrated the heart.</p>

<p>"I do not dwell on the above solitary instance of the death of a
native by the hands of white men, with the view of inducing any one
to believe that the colonists would not have retaliated more
frequently if they could. The natives, under the guidance of
Mosquito, commenced and carried on what they intended should prove
a war of extermination, both of man and beast. They spared neither
age nor sex; the aged woman and the helpless child alike fell
victims to their ferocity; and the feelings of the whites towards
them in consequence may easily be imagined. For a space of some
months, during which time I noted down their proceedings, the
number of murders of white people which came to my knowledge
<i>averaged eight a week</i>; and many doubtless occurred which I
never heard of.</p>

<p>"In several instances, the lives of white people were saved by
the native women, who would often steal away from the tribe, and
give notice of an intended attack. On one occasion one of our
boat's crews had landed for the night on the shore of Great Swan
Port, made their preparations for supper, and lighted a fire, when
two native women came stealthily to them, warning them to hurry
away, as the tribe was hidden behind the nearest bank, only waiting
till the moon rose to make a descent upon them. Accordingly, the
men hastily gathered up their paraphernalia, and decamped to their
boat, but had scarcely pushed out into deep water before they saw
the enemy come stealing down, one black figure after another
gliding past their fire, evidently with the intention of
surrounding them.</p>

<p>"The disappearance of all the young children among the natives
compels us to the inference that they were destroyed; doubtless on
account of the difficulty of conveying them about in the rapid
flights from place to place which the blacks now practised in the
perpetration of their murders. No white people ever found or killed
any children that I am aware of, and few after this time were seen
with the tribes; the dreadful conclusion seems therefore
unavoidable.</p>

<p>"Colonel, now Sir George, Arthur, arrived here as
Lieutenant-governor in 1824, shortly after the first murders, and
my father immediately proposed to him plans for the conciliation
and temporary coercion of the natives, warning him that unless some
effectual means were at once adopted, the murderous habits of the
latter would for a time be fearfully destructive to the colonists,
and eventually cause their own extermination. The advice was
disregarded, but the result verified its wisdom.</p>

<p>"It will suffice to mention here two or three from among the
many fatal outrages committed by the blacks in our immediate
neighbourhood. After the murder at Grindstone Bay, the natives
remained quiet for some months, and people had begun to recover
from their suspicions and dread of them, when they murdered another
of our servants. Two of my father's stock-keepers, Robert Gay and
David Raynor, lived together in a hut near the head of Moulting
Bay*, in Swan Port, Gay being in charge of the place.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Moulting Bay, so named from the number of
black swans which formerly frequented it in the <i>moulting</i>
season, is amusingly enough marked on some modem maps as "<i>Port
Moultan</i>."]</p>

<p>"One morning, in the winter of 1824, Raynor rode out after
cattle, purposing to remain out all night, but from some cause he
changed his plans, and returned home in the evening. On approaching
the hut, he was surprised that the dogs did not come out barking as
usual, and, thinking that his mate had very imprudently left home
and gone hunting in his absence, rode up to the door somewhat
angrily, when he found some kangaroo-skins, which were always kept
inside, scattered about. On entering, he found the hut in great
disorder, and the stores of food, &amp;c., all gone. Then, looking
round, he saw numbers of prints of naked feet, showing that many
persons, male and female, had been trampling about, and being by
this time convinced that the natives had been there, he grew
alarmed, and rode off again to the next station, reporting the
circumstance. This was near the farm of Mr. John Amos, who, with a
party of armed men, went with Raynor to his hut the following
morning. Poor Gay's foot-prints were soon distinguished, as he had
worn boots, whilst the blacks' feet (traces of which there were
many, evidently in pursuit of him) were naked. About four hundred
yards from the hut was a creek, in which the body of Gay was found,
covered over with sticks; on being drawn out, many spear-wounds
were discovered, and one spear remained in one of the feet, having
been driven through his thick boot-sole into the foot; but for this
one spear he might probably have escaped, being a very swift
runner, and this fatal weapon must have struck him when flying at
full speed from his murderers. All his finger-joints were broken,
and the body brutally mutilated, according to the usual custom of
the blacks, when not hurried or disturbed in their deeds of horror.
Everything, of any value, that the hut had contained was
stolen&mdash;stores, dogs, all were gone, and not a native was to be
seen or heard of in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"This same David Raynor had another narrow escape some years
after. He was coming home on horseback, driving wild cattle near
the Apsley River, and not a native was in sight, when two spears,
thrown at him, gave the first intimation of their vicinity; one
struck into the thick padding of the saddle behind his leg, and the
other carried off the red woollen sailor's cap he wore, and pinned
it to the side of a bullock in the herd at some distance beyond.
Raynor then rode for his life, and the terrified cattle flew in all
directions; but some short time after the bullock, which he had
described as being speared, was found with a deep spear-wound in
the side, then nearly healed.</p>

<p>"Within a fortnight from the time of Gay's murder, the same
tribe went to my father's whaling-station at the mouth of Swan
Port; they hailed the boats, and the men took them in, and,
thinking they would gain some reward for capturing the murderous
savages, pulled across the bay homewards, and then kept the native
party, consisting of six men and four or five women, for two or
three days, intending to send them by a vessel to the governor;
but, whilst arrangements were being made for conveying them safely
and unharmed on board, they effected an escape&mdash;some ran one way,
some another, and pursuit was vain; but one of the women was
slightly hurt in the confusion, and rushed into the sea, where she
swam and dived for some time, before she could be induced to come
ashore. Her wound was carefully dressed by a surgeon who chanced to
have arrived, and considerable anxiety was entertained lest it
should prove worse than it then seemed; a bed was made up for her
in a warm hut, and she was finally left for the night. Early in the
morning the hut was visited, to see how the patient fared; but,
though the door had been closed and fastened, the chimney had not,
and up it the dark lady had gone.</p>

<p>"John Raynor, another of three brothers, all in my father's
service, was one morning out hunting, and, about nine o'clock, sat
busily skinning a kangaroo which his dogs had just caught, when
suddenly the animals yelled, as they always did whenever they saw
or scented the blacks, and, on looking round, he perceived some of
them near him. He jumped up and ran, but instantly received two
spears, one in his breast, which he pulled out readily, and another
in his back, which he wrenched at, and broke off short. He still
ran as fast as he could, until, coming to a large log, he tripped,
and fell over it in such a manner as to conceal him, for he knew
nothing more, until, coming to himself at night, he by degrees
recalled the circumstances, and with some difficulty made his way
home. He remained ill for some time from the wounds he had
received, but ultimately recovered, and went to Hobarton. On his
return thence, when within four miles of Grindstone Bay (the scene
of the first murder), he was passing through a thick close scrub of
wattle-trees, when a number of the natives, who were hidden among
them, rushed out and knocked him down, completely stunning him with
blows from their waddies.</p>

<p>"Stock-keepers were then living at the Grindstone Bay station,
and, three days after the attack upon Raynor, these men saw
something approaching their hut, which at last they discerned to be
a man, but, from his reeling staggering gait, they believed him to
be drunk. He advanced slowly along the path, sometimes creeping on
all fours, and sometimes walking, with a rolling unsteady pace.
With great effort and difficulty he climbed over the fence near the
hut, and then they found it was poor Raynor, cruelly maimed and
wounded, with one eye knocked out, and the other quite blind, his
frightful sores all festering, and alive with maggots! The poor
fellow had awakened from his long stupor, and, on recovering his
recollection, had crawled along the path, which was fortunately
tolerably well beaten; and so, after unimaginable agony and toil,
he had contrived to reach the hut. Every kind attention was paid to
him, and he was afterwards carefully conveyed to the Hobarton
Hospital, but he died there.</p>

<p>"About the year 1827 the natives made a most determined attack
upon the cottage-home of a settler at Great Swan Port, named
Buxton, who was himself absent at the time; but his wife, four
daughters, and two sons (one aged fifteen, the other a child), were
at home, the only other inmates being a servant man, and a person
travelling on the east coast, who was resting on his journey. The
cottage was, like those usually inhabited by the early settlers,
built of turf, with a thatched roof. Early in the morning of a
summer's day, the family was alarmed by the peculiar yelling of the
dogs, denoting the near approach of the natives. On looking out,
the place was discovered to be wholly surrounded by a large body of
them, and as, unhappily, they were not then accustomed to approach
the white people with any but hostile purposes, their appearance
produced no small amount of terror and dismay, especially as, from
some inadvertence or neglect, the besieged family had no means of
defence, being wholly deficient either of arms or ammunition (I
forget which). Still, the natives durst not rush into the hut, and
the inmates remained prisoners within from the early morning until
four in the afternoon, when the blacks, being resolved to dislodge
them by some means, set fire to a brush fence which ran close
beside the hut, and could not fail, if it continued burning, to
ignite the thatch. As the fire approached, some of the party were
obliged to go out and extinguish it, when the traveller received a
spear in his back, and the servant one in his stomach, from the
wound of which he died. This success greatly emboldened the blacks,
who immediately came nearer, and got into the trees close to the
cottage, whence they began throwing fire-sticks on to the thatch,
and set fire to it; but Mr. Buxton's eldest son succeeded in
putting it out, and regained the hut without being wounded. A party
of the natives below now made a fire on the ground, and carefully
burned the ends of spears, so as to carry fire with certainty, and
these they began to hand up to the others in the trees. The
wretched group in the cottage now believed themselves inevitably
doomed; death in its most horrible shape seemed awaiting them at a
few seconds' distance, and all hope of escape had departed, for the
two dwellings nearest to them, whence alone they could expect
succour, were severally fifteen and twenty-seven miles off. Yet was
a rescue at hand, even at the doors! A party of twelve or fourteen
soldiers, in search of bushrangers then very numerous, came up at
this fearful juncture; and the instant they were seen, the whole
besieging army of natives <i>vanished</i>&mdash;rapidly and silently as
the shadows of a hideous dream, and in a few seconds not one was to
be found near the place. The traveller who had been speared was a
sufferer for some time, but he eventually recovered.</p>

<p>"Some time after this event, a terrible tragedy was perpetrated
at Jericho, where my father had a quantity of cattle in the care of
a stock-keeper named Gough, who lived in a hut with his wife and
his two little girls; and a mile distant from him, an old couple
named Mortimer occupied another small hut. One morning about eleven
o'clock, Gough and his servant, being at home, saw old "Mother
Mortimer" coming towards them as fast as she could run, and calling
out to beg and beseech them to go quickly to her hut, for that the
blacks had set it on fire, and she wanted Gough to save some of her
little property, her husband being away from home. Gough and the
man took their guns and ran off on the charitable errand, whilst
the old woman stayed with Mrs. Gough. They found Mortimer's hut
totally burned to the ground, and everything destroyed, but not a
single native was visible. Gough immediately feared that they had
gone, or certainly would go, to his own home, and ran back again at
the top of his speed; but too late to save his unhappy family from
the brutal blacks. The first object that met his sight was the body
of his young wife, pierced with many spears, and her brains knocked
out. A little beyond lay the old woman Mortimer, her head cloven in
two with an axe. Near the hut he found his eldest girl, her head
beaten to pieces; and near her the youngest, stunned with blows on
the head, and otherwise dreadfully hurt, but still alive and
moaning. As usual, the natives had vanished.</p>

<p>"The poor little girl who recovered said that her father was
only just out of sight when the natives came, proving the truth of
Gough's suspicions that the attack on Mortimer's hut was a mere
ruse to secure his absence from his own, which they could then
plunder at their ease, and probably the main body was concealed
round his hut, only awaiting his departure to begin the attack. The
terrified women had shut themselves and the children in the hut,
and the blacks threw spears at them through the windows (the panes
of glass in which were pierced with round holes, as if balls had
been fired through them). The natives then came down the chimney,
and old Nancy Mortimer struck at their legs with the axe, whilst
Mrs. Gough tried to escape by the door, but they were then directly
murdered. The hut was stripped of all the stores.</p>

<p>"Not far from this last place, in the pretty valley near the
present 'London Inn,' a small farmer named Hooper, with his wife
and either seven or eight young children, lived in a hut placed
between two rocky hills, near a stream of fresh water. One day,
some persons went to see Hooper, and were surprised at not finding
him or any of the children about, or at work as usual, and
proceeded towards the cottage, where, lying all round, frightfully
mangled and full of spears, were the dead bodies of Hooper, his
wife, and <i>all</i> their children. As usual with the savages,
when not disturbed in their work of fiendish butchery, they had
cruelly mutilated their helpless victims, hammered their bones in
pieces, broken their fingers, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>"A black woman some time after told the whole of their plans and
schemes to achieve this terrible murder; she said that a party of
them had for three days kept watch unseen on one of the rocky hills
close to the cottage, intending to wait there until Hooper went out
to work without his gun, which he usually carried, as was the
general and necessary custom in those days of terror. One unhappy
day he <i>did</i> go out without it, and instantly the descent was
made and the massacre effected with the terrible success they
anticipated.</p>

<p>"At a hut in St. Paul's Plains six or eight men were living
together, being shepherds and other servants of a neighbouring
settler; one morning they found their hut surrounded by forty or
fifty natives. The men had several guns, but only a few rounds of
ammunition; still, with only common presence of mind and courage,
they would have been in no immediate danger; but, in the extremity
of their terror, they lost all prudence, and began firing whilst
the blacks were still beyond the range of the guns, so that before
they could do any execution their powder was all spent. Even then,
had they remained in the hut, the natives could not have known
their want of powder, and would probably have kept off; but,
panic-stricken at the bare idea of the natives&mdash;so intensely had
their atrocities excited the terror of the white people&mdash;the
frightened men agreed to 'make a run for it,' and putting this
hopeless expedient into practice, they all started from the hut
together. The blacks, soon perceiving that they made no attempt to
shoot, instantly closed round and knocked them down, and killed
them all except one, who escaped into the tier of mountains near
the station, running so far that he totally lost himself, and could
not find his way back for three days. Within two hours after the
murder I passed the station, walking slowly, and leading my horse,
which had fallen lame; and as I went by at a short distance, I
wondered why none of the men usually there were then to be seen
about. I left my lame horse at the farm of a settler near, and
walked on homewards. The following day I came upon the
freshly-deserted camp-place of the tribe, some miles nearer to Swan
Port, in which direction they, like myself, were hastening; but
fortunately we did not meet. A dray was sent to the St. Paul's
station the day after the murder, with provisions and stores, when
the dead bodies were discovered."</p>
</div>

<p>But enough of these harrowing details! Surely I need transcribe
no more; nor would I have particularised even these, but in the
hope of making known something of the real state of affairs as
formerly existing between the aborigines and the colonists, which
is so greatly misunderstood in England; where, as I well know, the
white people are most erroneously believed to have been the
aggressors. I verily begin to think there is some peculiarity in
the atmosphere around Van Diemen's Land, which is adverse to the
transmission of truth, for somehow or other all accounts carried
home partake of the same distorted or wholly imaginative character.
Nor can I marvel at wrong impressions concerning the treatment of
the blacks being received in England, when even in the colony some
persons of education and supposed common sense were, some years
ago, actually cheated or quizzed into the belief that the settlers
made a regular practice of catching the natives, and boiling them
down to feed pigs! I shall close this most unpleasant chapter with
Mr. Meredith's brief account of the final capture of the
blacks.</p>

<div class="newspaper">
<p>"The outrages committed by the natives continued without any
attempt on the part of the Government to suppress them, <i>beyond
the formal publication, in the Government Gazette, of a
proclamation, commanding the natives not to pass from the west to
the east of a certain imaginary line drawn through the island in a
north and south direction!</i> The use of such a medium as a
printed proclamation in a Gazette to address a horde of savages,
who could not speak the English language, far less read it, would
not have occurred to any governor less gifted with sagacity than
Col. Arthur; and with that notable experiment he contented himself
until the year 1829, when the whole male population of the colony,
capable of bearing arms, was called out for the purpose of driving
the natives on to Tasman's Peninsula. Many, whose better sense
informed them of the impossibility of such a scheme succeeding,
joined in the 'Black War,' as it was called, from the fear of being
deprived of their assigned servants, and cut off from all chance of
receiving additional grants of land; such being the manner in which
Lieut-Governor Colonel Arthur, now Sir George Arthur, exhibited his
displeasure towards those settlers who differed with him as to the
policy of his local acts. As was foretold from its commencement,
the 'Black war' proved an utter failure, and cost the colony
27,000! Except in the transfer of large sums of money to the
contractors favoured by Government, matters remained as before the
expedition was undertaken, until a person named Robinson, a
bricklayer by trade, but an active and intelligent man, undertook
and performed the singular service of bringing every aboriginal
man, woman, and child, quietly, peaceably, and willingly into
Hobarton, whence they were shipped to Flinder's Island, which is
between forty and fifty miles in length, twelve to eighteen in
width, and abounding with the smaller species of kangaroo, &amp;c.;
the coasts are plentifully supplied with fish, and in addition to
this abundance of their natural food, the natives were provided at
the expense of the colony with dwellings, ample rations of flour
and meat, bedding, clothes, garden implements, seeds,
fishing-tackle, and all things which could be necessary for their
present or improved condition; besides medical attendance, and the
means of careful and judicious instruction in all things fitting or
possible for them to learn.</p>

<p>"From the time of Mr. Robinson's extraordinary capture, or
rather persuasion of the natives to follow him, a complete change
took place in the island; the remote stock stations were again
resorted to, and guns were no longer carried between the handles of
the plough. The means of persuasion employed by Mr. Robinson to
induce the natives to submit to his guidance have ever been a
mystery to me. He went into the bush unarmed, and, accompanied by
an aboriginal woman, his sole companion, met the different tribes,
and used such arguments with them as sufficed at length to achieve
his object, after having occupied many months in its pursuit. He
received some reward from the local Government, although not nearly
adequate to the merits of his service. He alone, unassisted in any
way, accomplished what Colonel Arthur, with the aid of the
military, and all the male population of the island, and an
expenditure of 27,000, had failed to do. The debt of gratitude the
colony owes to Mr. Robinson can never be overpaid; by his capture
of the natives, he saved the lives of thousands of defenceless
persons, and was the means of restoring that prosperity to the
colony which the accumulating number of murders was fast
undermining."</p>

Magpies.&mdash;Black Magpies.</p>

<p>By the end of August, 1842, our cottage had advanced so far
towards completion, that we could live in it; and, without waiting
for anything further, we began the welcome business of removal
thither. Never, perhaps, did the unpleasant process of changing
one's house appear so delightful. The very carts and drays as they
started off, loaded with the heterogeneous contents of our abode,
had, in my eyes, quite a cheerful and jaunty air, as they went
nodding along; and the promiscuous arrangement of chair and table
legs looked as if scarcely restrained from a dance on the spot. My
piano, carefully replaced in its English case, and laid upon a dray
well padded with bags full of straw, and drawn by six oxen, moved
away with a grave and solemn demeanour, as if conscious how
important a part it played in the procession, and would probably be
much scandalized at the riotous and unmusical conduct of certain
small pigs, who, with their portly maternal parent, occupied
another vehicle in the train.</p>

<p>On the following morning, after breakfast, our horse-cart came
to the door, and received its precious freight, consisting of the
children, the mamma, the nurse, and the cat, the latter safely tied
up in a bag, greatly to dear little George's amusement and
mystification. Portfolios, desks, workboxes, books, toys, and such
"small deer," completed the load, and so we arrived at last at our
new home. How busy everybody immediately became, what sounds of
brooms and scrubbing-brushes, of mops and pails; what hammering and
unpacking went noisily on, may well be imagined; but so merrily and
rapidly went on the work, that even on the first night we were
tolerably snug, and in another day or two were truly "at home."</p>

<p>Our walls were still damp, from their own great thickness, and
the fresh plaster, one coat only of which we waited to have put on
before removing, purposing to finish the interior in summer.
Certainly the scores and crossings of the plasterers trowel were
not ornamental, and the dark colour of the walls might seem
somewhat gloomy; but as soon as they dried sufficiently, I had a
remedy at hand for all their unsightliness; I hung up the old
pictures once again, and heartily welcomed them to, as I then
believed, their last Australian home.</p>

<p>Too many useful and necessary things had hitherto demanded
attention and labour, to allow of any merely ornamental work being
done; and I dare say any one else (especially if unaccustomed to
the transformations of a new country), who looked at our lonely
dwelling, and the scrubby thickets and dead wood all around it, and
the high heavy log-fence which then stood just in front, would
bless himself that it was not his fate to inhabit such a
wilderness; but to us&mdash;seeing it as we did through the decorative
medium of our own plans and projects&mdash;all was bright and hopeful.
In looking at the house, we knew exactly where the veranda would
"come in," and where the climbing roses, and vines, and clematis,
would be trained over it; and when we surveyed the view from the
windows, the coarse reality of scrub and log-fence was nicely
softened by the "mind's eye" view of the green sloping lawn, and
neat well-laid out garden beyond, which formed part of our
arrangements, and which was already well stocked with choice
fruit-trees from the Cambria orchard.</p>

<p>The work of clearing away the scrubby trees and wood in front
furnished Mr. Meredith with occupation for many an afternoon, and,
with strong gloves on, I enjoyed lending a helping hand to the
task; whilst even little George was delighted to carry sticks to
the heaps, and earn scratched knees and torn pinafores in the
service. Our piles of wood and leaves made grand bonfires at night,
and the streams of bright flames and sparks; rising amidst the
masses of dark honeysuckle trees, illuminated the whole scene with
a wild and most picturesque glare of light.</p>

<p>We had not been located at Spring Vale more than a fortnight or
three weeks, when an unusually heavy fall of rain set in, and
continued for some days. The rivers on either side of us rose very
rapidly, as they both descend from steep mountains, whose narrow
rocky gorges pour down an enormous accumulation of water. Our low
lands were soon entirely flooded, forming a great lake, and the
chief of the cattle and sheep were with difficulty saved, and
driven to the dry ground; but some calves and sheep were drowned,
despite the utmost care, as the rivers, breaking forth at different
points, formed temporary islands, where the poor frightened
creatures retreated for safety, until swept away by the increasing
and rapid overflow of the water.</p>

<p>About two o'clock on the first day of the flood, we heard a
great noise of "Coo-ee-ring," in the direction of the ford over the
Swan River, and our servants, on going down, found that a man, in
attempting to cross on horseback, had been so frightened by the
breadth and roaring of the water, that he had slipped off the
horse, and, with some difficulty, scrambled into a tree, then in
the middle of the stream. Mr. Meredith hurried down to see what
could be done for him, and at this time he might, with common
presence of mind and the assistance offered him, have walked on
shore, as, although broad and rapid, the water was not yet deep;
but nothing could induce him to make the attempt, although he
entreated that the horse, which had safely swam out, might be
"turned in again towards him;" for what purpose, it were difficult
to say, as when be was on its back before he could not keep his
seat. The river was now rising and spreading with terrific
rapidity; each moment the chances of escape grew less, and the
cowardly fellow's situation more dreadful. All aid was soon
impracticable, as the huge masses of timber that came rushing
along, and the hidden boughs and stakes in the scrub that now
formed part of the river's bed, would have instantly disabled the
stoutest swimmer, and no boat could be obtained.</p>

<p>The rain still poured down in torrents, with a cold southerly*
wind, and the dim gray twilight fast darkened into night, over as
dreary a scene as can well be imagined. The tree in which the
unfortunate man had taken refuge was, just at nightfall, swept away
by the torrent; and, half-drowned for the second time, he luckily
contrived to lay hold of another tree, as he was washed along,
which, although slender, and shaking under him with the force of
the water, served him better, having a forked branch in it, on
which he could rest one foot at a time; and so the poor wretch
clung to it, wet to the skin, and nearly frozen in the cold night
wind. Our servants, who would willingly have risked their own lives
for his had there been a chance of success, made up a fire against
a great gum-tree on the nearest bank, and three or four of them
determined to remain there the whole night to keep up the fire, and
shout to him, "to cheer him up a bit," as they kindly said; and
another party did the same on the other side the river.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The cold rain is of course from the south in
this hemisphere, although it still seems strange, even to me, to
speak of it as such.]</p>

<p>It was late before we could think of going comfortably to bed,
whilst a fellow-creature remained near us in such a wretched and
awful condition; for it seemed scarcely possible that he could
"hold on" till morning. And at intervals, all through the dreary
night, amidst the gusts of wind, the pelting rain, and the deep
loud roaring of the flood, which now encompassed our little hill on
three sides, I could hear the shouts of our people, as they hailed
the poor wretch, both to comfort him, and to assure themselves by
his replies that he had not dropped into the river. At length
morning came, and showed him still clinging to the tree, in the
midst of the vast, broad, turbulent, rushing torrent. The man's
master, and several other settlers from the neighbourhood, came to
see what could be done, but all shrunk from the idea of perilling
their own lives in so hopeless a risk. Mr. Meredith, who had also
been down to the river, had returned to the house, and we were at
breakfast, when a hasty footstep came along the hall, then a loud
sob was heard, and the nursemaid burst into the room, crying
bitterly.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well! what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir! if you please, sir, <i>Bill's up a tree too!</i>" And
on inquiry, we found that one of our good old servants had
foolishly suffered himself to be flattered and persuaded that "he
was the man to fetch the poor fellow out, if any man could," and
had, with thorough kindness, but most insane folly, attempted to
swim out to him: the eddying current had swept him away, dashed him
against some hidden logs so as to hurt him severely, and left him
barely strength to grasp a tree a little nearer our bank than the
other, and clamber into it; so that now there were two, instead of
one, to be extricated.</p>

<p>Devices innumerable were discussed and dismissed in turn; the
day wore away, and our poor fellow said he could not "hold on" much
longer. Long lines had been prepared, but none could be thrown far
enough to reach the trees; and after gathering together and sending
down every cord and twine and fishing-line in the house, for
another trial, I could not rest at home, for I knew that Mr.
Meredith would not allow a faithful old servant to perish in the
cause of humanity, even if he risked his own life to save him. The
rain had abated, and I ran down to a bank on the water's edge,
whence I could see both the unfortunates clinging to their trees,
their clothes saturated with wet, and their frightful position more
than realizing my belief of its horrors. The river roared and
boiled along beneath them, carrying down with it huge trees, whole
lines of fencing, blocks of wood, and branches of all sizes, which,
as they dashed against the slender trees, made them shake as though
they were giving way too.</p>

<p>At last a man on the opposite bank, after innumerable failures,
succeeded in shooting from a gun a stick, to which a long fine line
was attached, and to the end of this a strong rope. After many
trials, the stick fell in the tree where the first man was hanging,
and be hauled in the twine until he caught the rope, which he tied
round his body, and, after some hesitation, obeyed the command to
throw himself into the river. The people on the bank hauled away
manfully at their end of the rope, but the current was so strong,
that the man was carried down some distance, and kept so long under
water, that I thought he must be drowned; but he reappeared, and
was dragged through a thick half-submerged scrub, safe to land,
where the good people had prepared hot tea, and fire, and dry
garments, and I soon lost sight of him among the bustling group
that closed round him.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith having now completed his plan for rescuing "Bill,"
took a tall pole, and, carrying with him a long line coiled up,
waded off towards him, swimming being impracticable, from the
quantities of submerged and driving logs and sticks; three of the
men followed him, with similar poles to hold themselves up by
against the current, whilst our friend Mr. Jukes, of the "Fly,"*
took the command of the coil of rope, more in-shore. Having gained
a great heap of wreck collected round a tree some distance from the
bank, Mr. Meredith climbed into this tree, and from it managed to
throw the line on to the tree where our servant was, who hauled it
in, till he got hold of the rope, which he tied round him, and then
dropped into the water. He was soon drawn through the broad deep
channel to the heap of wreck, and from thence the men held him up
and guided him ashore. I waited no longer, but ran quickly home to
prepare dry clothes, warm blankets, and the wherewithal to comfort
the "inner man" of the dripping party, who soon followed me,
thankful that our poor servitor's thoughtless expedition had not
had a more serious result than the joking advice of his companions,
"not to go a bird's nesting that way again."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Who, in the narrative of his wanderings, has
not condescended to immortalize our pleasant island of Tasmania,
and tells me that no one will read what any one may write about it.
<i>I</i> hope to find his prophecy not <i>quite</i> true.]</p>

<p>Some days elapsed before the rivers retired sufficiently within
their usual bounds, for persons to cross them safely. Another
flood, but of less magnitude than this, occurred in the following
November; but, beyond the annoyance such visitations always
occasion, by cutting off communication and destroying fences, its
consequences were not very important.</p>

<p>These rivers of ours, so terrible when swollen with winter
rains, on the melting of the mountain snows (snow being unknown in
nearly all the lower parts of this delightful island), dwindle to
mere brooks during the summer months, and are often wholly lost
sight of, except in a few deep shady pools. One of these, in the
Cygnet River, was called the "Big Pool," though, as in every river
in almost every district, there are some half-dozen bearing the
same not very definite or descriptive name. I proposed to
distinguish this by some more characteristic one, such as Lake
Cygnet, or the Dryad's Mirror. It is very deep, the banks appear
nearly perpendicular, and the water has a deep blue colour as you
gaze down into it, but is so clear and still, that the forest which
encircles it may see each knotted and twisted gum-tree, and each
tall and thickly-verdant lightwood and wattle, reflected as in a
mirror; and indeed I can only account for the singular arching-over
of the fine old trees, by the fancy that they had for ages so loved
to bend down and gaze on themselves in the calm deep water, that
they had at last grown into their present position.</p>

<p>The wild unspoiled beauty of the place made it a great favourite
with us, and I rarely went there without seeing some new bird or
insect, or finding a shrub or flower which I did not know before.
Several beautiful species of ferns grew here luxuriantly, in the
dark moist nooks; and the trunks and twisting roots of the old
trees were clad in mosses and lichens of various form, and
infinitely varying colour.</p>

<p>That beautiful shrub, the "Sweet Bay" of the colonists
(<i>Prostanthera lasianthos</i>), grew here to the height of
fifteen or even twenty feet, with its handsome sprays and clusters
of white purple-pencilled flowers, thrown into fine relief and
contrast by the deep rich green of the elegant foliage; and the
starry clematis wove its bower of emerald and silver among the
branches, in many a quiet shadowy nook, where the noon-day sun
might only find tiny loopholes in the high leafy screen above, to
peer down into our sylvan haunts.</p>

<p>The beautiful black cockatoos seemed to share in our admiration
of this spot, for we often found a large party of them in the tall
trees near the pool, and sometimes in the dead boughs of fallen
ones which formed a sort of barrier at either end of it, and seemed
to furnish the cockatoos with good store of grubs and insects, to
judge by the pleasant and congratulatory tone of their
conversation. These are like the black cockatoos of New South
Wales, except that the top-knots and tails of the latter are
trimmed with crimson, whilst my more intimate and familiar friends
of Spring Vale had their jetty garb more delicately varied by a
pale and lovely shade of canary-yellow, or rather pure primrose
colour. Their cry is much more pleasing than that of the white
cockatoo, and instead of being, like that bird, a great pest to the
farmer, they are quite harmless, never molesting the richest crops
of grain, but only visiting old dead or dying trees, and picking
out of them the large white grubs, which form their chief food.
These grubs are often three or four inches long, and proportionably
thick; perfectly white, smooth, and rather glossy; more like models
of grubs in white wax, than living things; the aborigines eat them
greedily, and I have heard that some English people do so, and say
they taste like nuts or almonds! They change to gigantic moths, of
most exquisite plumage, their principal colours being those of the
owl and hawk tribe, among birds, but charmingly varied and shaded;
the <i>feathers</i> are of extraordinary length, so that the
insect's legs and head have the appearance of being clothed in long
rich fur garments, and their wings, some of which have beautiful
large pink eyes or spots in them, look as if Titania's busy sprites
might comb and dress them like hair.</p>

<p>The cockatoos search for these dainty morsels with great
avidity; the strength of their beaks is enormous; I have often
watched them at work in a tree, tearing away first the bark in
great strips, and then large pieces of the wood; and on going
afterwards to examine the chips they have left, have truly
marvelled at their dexterity and perseverance, for the grub is
often deep in the wood, and a great thickness must be torn away
before it can be dislodged. They are right merry craftsmen, too,
and call out cheerfully and kindly to one another, as they ply
their work, discoursing, doubtless, on the quality and obstinate
resistance of their prize. They are usually seen in parties of from
five to ten or fifteen, and always give me the idea of most
friendly, clever, good-humoured birds; and, accordingly, we took
them under our especial protection, never suffering them to be
molested near us, so that they grew comparatively tame, and would
sit pecking in trees quite close to the house, and let us approach
them tolerably near, to observe their polite bowings and
curtseyings, as they gravely moved about, with their elegant golden
crests alternately raised or depressed; but if we still lessened
what they deemed a prudent distance, the whole party took wing. The
cockatoos appeared to roam about during the day to considerable
distances, but we generally saw them flying home at night in the
same direction. I have often wished to procure a young bird to rear
tame, yet allowing it perfect liberty, but have never heard of any
one who had found or seen a nest. One of our servants offered to
procure me one very readily, but on inquiring how he meant to
achieve the capture, I found his notable expedient was to fire at
one very near to him, and "wing it," which not being exactly the
treatment I contemplated for my tame pet, I declined the
proposal.</p>

<p>My conscience half reproaches me for suffering even the
beautiful black cockatoos to take precedence, in this gossiping
chronicle, of our yet more prized and beloved friends, the common
magpies, the merriest, handsomest, most harmless and entertaining
birds that can be conceived. As every one on our land was
prohibited from destroying them, or, indeed, any birds, save
parrots, hawks, and crows, we had generally a large assemblage near
the house; and their sweet songs, warbled forth at intervals during
the whole day and night, reminded me pleasantly of the note of the
English blackhird. Many of the full, rich, deep tones are exactly
similar, although the magpie's song has less variety of cadence:
still, it is, alone, an ample refutation of the assertion made by
some unobservant person, and echoed by many thoughtless ones, that
"the Australian birds have no song," than which nothing can be more
untrue, for many of them have very sweet notes; and any one who
would do as I have often done&mdash;sit quietly down in a woody retired
spot, and, without noise or motion, listen to the countless voices
warbling all around him, in every variety of tone and key, would
soon become convinced that the Australian, or at all events the
Tasmanian, birds, not only sing, but sing very pleasingly; and, of
all the choir, the magpies take the highest rank.</p>

<p>They are very beautiful birds, too, with a good deal of the form
and air of the English magpie, but with a shorter tail. The
plumage, of the glossiest black and most brilliant silvery white,
is elegantly contrasted and arranged, and their bright intelligent
eyes, and graceful demeanour, seem to denote a degree of refinement
rather above their neighbours. In the summer, and when the nights
are moonlight, at whatever hour I have chanced to awake, I have
heard them carolling away as if it were just sunrise, and often,
with a sleepy wonder, marvelled when, or if ever, they tucked their
busy heads beneath their wings, and went to sleep like other
birds.</p>

<p>Our servants used to complain that my handsome friends would
persist in pecking the meat, when the oxen or sheep were freshly
killed, and were hanging outside, and I have myself observed them
examining it with most minute attention; but on two of them being
shot for the offence, I was so much grieved, and gave such
peremptory orders that so unwonted an outrage should never again be
perpetrated, that they have peeped into our beef and mutton ever
since with impunity.</p>

<p>Sad and melancholy creatures are the tame magpies so often seen
here, cooped up in wretched cages made of an old tea-chest or
soap-box, with a few bars on one side, and hung up against a hut,
where they forget their own "wood-notes wild," and learn to swear,
or to whistle "Jim Crow;" their dim, soiled, ragged feathers, and
lack-lustre expression, scarcely suffering one to believe them of
the same race as the bright merry wild magpies.</p>

<p>The black magpie has very much the aspect of a crow, being
jet-black all over, saving only a small bar of white on the wings
and tail; it is a far less agreeable guest than its pied namesake,
being very destructive in corn-fields. Just as the blade is
springing well up, these mischievous birds descend in flocks, and,
with their long powerful bills, dig up and devour the rooted grain,
so that they sometimes cause great loss to the farmer, and our
firelocks had a full share of their unwelcome patronage. They have
several notes or cries, but none are very musical. They usually
associate in large parties, although their slovenly stick-nests are
solitary. Some persons like these birds when cooked; but, after
exhausting all my culinary skill upon them in roasts, stews,
curries, and pies, I have finally given them up as not cookable, or
rather as not relishable when cooked. Whether it be the
<i>crowish</i> look they have which gives us unpleasant fancies
about them, or that the flesh really possesses the flavour we
attribute to it, I am not quite decided, but our prejudice against
them is too strong to be overcome. No one would think of eating one
of the other magpies, as they are known to devour meat, besides
their usual food of worms, grubs, &amp;c.</p>

Haunts.</p>

<p>During the summer and autumn of this year, (1842-3), we effected
many of our purposed improvements: the veranda was built, the
log-fence in the front was removed, and a more distant paling
supplied its place sloping down the hill, so as to include some
nice wattle-trees in our "lawn," so called; although I much
question if its smoothly-shaven namesakes at home would own kindred
with the piece of long-bearded, wild, uneven grass and weeds, which
we affectionately so designated. The cottage being placed on a
rocky bank, the soil close around it was not adapted for a garden
(our principal one was at the foot of the slope, in a rich flat),
and my indispensable flower-borders were consequently formed with
some labour. Many cartloads of stones and rocks had to be carried
away, and a quantity of rich earth and manure carted in: the
borders were then laid out on a very simple plan, and edged with
thyme, almost the only substitute here for the bright, clean, neat
box-edging used in England. Roses of various kinds, geraniums, and
a host of other good old flowers, were soon planted, and another
pleasant source of interest and occupation opened to me. Of the
latter I had, indeed, no lack, between the care of my household and
our dear children; and besides these there were chickens, and
ducks, and turkeys to rear; butter, cream, cheeses, and other
country comforts to make; calves to pet; mushrooms to seek, and
convert into ketchup (these being frequently very abundant and
fine); and a whole catalogue of pleasant busy little idlenesses to
indulge in, that carried one week after another with reproachful
celerity.</p>

<p>Then our long rambling rides or walks often occupied the longest
half of the day, especially if Master George were of the party,
trotting along on foot, with occasional interludes of
"pick-a-back," on papa's shoulders. Sometimes our corn-fields had
to be visited, the wheat and oats growing most luxuriantly.
Sometimes we went to look at the turnips, wherein lay our hopes of
fat beef for winter; or to see the potatoes, which we were told
were certain not to succeed, many farmers here having ceased to
grow them, the summer frosts being destructive; ours, however,
promised well, and we gladly anticipated the luxury of having an
abundance of them, after having been compelled to do wholly without
them, and to adopt all kinds of unsatisfactory substitutes. The
terrible potato disease had not at this time been heard of; nor do
I think it has yet really appeared in this colony.</p>

<p>Quantities of the pretty downy-leaved wild Geranium grew in this
same potato field, which was part of a large inclosure on the bank
of the Swan River; and beneath the broad belt of majestic trees
which skirted it, forming a continuous grove beside the water, I
used to find store of lovely shrubs and flowers, and tangles of the
wild native raspberry, the only thing I have yet seen really like
an eatable fruit that these strange unfinished countries produce.
One might fancifully believe that the Australian colonies were
discovered too soon, and that Nature&mdash;that familiar term which we
so often use to spare the light or irreverent mention of the Great
Divine mover and guide of all&mdash;had not completed her design; and
that the dry seedy trees and juiceless herbs of Australia would, in
a few more ages, have changed into kindlier and better things; and
the great impenetrable reedy desert, which spreads over thousands
of miles in New Holland, would, perhaps, then have been uplifted
into hills and mountains, whose fresh streams and grassy valleys
might have supported a population commensurate with the immense
extent of territory: but the charm is broken! Art and invention,
and busy, gold-digging, mammon-worshipping men have intruded ere
the great task was accomplished.</p>

<p>But the raspberry seems to have been brought nearer to
completion than most things here, and were the fruit more abundant,
it would be of great value; but when we found what we called "a
quantity" of raspberries, there were never so many as I should have
wished to gather for George alone, so that they are scarcely worth
mentioning, except for their great beauty. The leaf and stem
resemble those of the blackberry, but are smaller and slighter,
never shooting up great thick stalks covered with spines like
sharks' teeth, such as I remember among my blackberry haunts at
home, but slender and weak; the blossoms small, with the bright,
pinkish, lilac petals turning inwards to the centre; and the
berries of a bright clear transparent scarlet, like the berries of
the woody nightshade. Their flavour is pleasant, but not comparable
to that of the garden raspberry.</p>

<p>Our old pointer, Don, always accompanied us in our rides and
walks, and sometimes started a brush kangaroo, giving chase most
gallantly, though without the remotest chance of catching his
hopping game, which went bounding off, over tussocks and logs,
through scrub, and under or over everything in its way, in a
half-flying style, most marvellous and incomprehensible to our good
old English dog, who, after a long chase, used to come panting back
to us, wagging his tail, and <i>looking</i> his apologies for the
failure, as plainly as if he said, "'I really beg your pardon,
master, but the hares I used to hunt at home have not the ugly
trick of hopping which these practise, and positively, I don't
understand it!"</p>

<p>My beautiful spaniel, "Dick Swiveller," generally shared the
chase and the disappointment, but, being a Tasmanian by birth,
perhaps the puzzle was less to him.</p>

<p>English sporting dogs point the kangaroo as they do any other
game, and Don always chased the creatures most determinedly, but in
vain; until one day, when, in hunting a rabbit, he jumped over a
great old fallen tree, and hit upon a poor kangaroo that was asleep
under its shelter. Don, although quite as much astonished as the
kangaroo, killed it on the spot, and when his master carried home
the prize, followed it closely, smelling and gently licking it, and
then looking up at me, telling me with his expressive, honest, old
face, how great a triumph had at last thrust itself upon him. Poor
fellow! he hunted more than ever after this glorious affair, and
several times disturbed a fine brush kangaroo very near our house,
chasing it often across our path, and once as we stood still in a
shady part of the public road, listening to the <i>thud, thud,
thud</i>, of its measured jumps as it approached us: the beautiful
gentle-looking deer-faced creature leaped almost against us, and
then instantly turning short round, hopped over a log, and away
into the thick scrub, but at no violent speed; he had been pursued
by old Don too often to deem that necessary, and, as usual, away
went Don and Dick after him, and with the same result. The dogs
used here to hunt the kangaroo have the shape and general character
of the greyhound, hut are very much larger in size, and coarser
altogether, uniting great strength with speed.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned the kangaroo, perhaps my most systematic
method will be to give a short description of the indigenous
animals of Tasmania, rather than introduce stray sketches of them
in the accidental manner in which I have made their
acquaintance.</p>

<p>I commence with the largest, the Great or Forest Kangaroo
(<i>Macropus giganteus</i>), the "Forester" of the colonists, which
I have not yet seen in its wild state. Many years ago they were
very numerous, and might constantly be observed feeding in the
day-time on the open country in groups of from five to twenty. The
oldest and heaviest male of the herd was called a "Boomer,"
probably a native term. When chased, these patriarchs of the
forest, being large and heavy, were always the least swift, and
consequently most frequently taken until at length the great boomer
kangaroo has become in all the inhabited districts an extinct
animal. The females, and younger males, or "bucks," are much less,
the elderly gentlemen alone attaining the great size described by
the early settlers. So many idle vagabonds have been in the
constant habit of roaming about with packs of twenty or thirty huge
dogs each, to procure kangaroo skins for sale, that the forest
species is now very rarely seen. An excellent Act of Council was
introduced by Sir Eardley Wilmot, and passed into law, tending to
the partial protection of the kangaroos, preventing persons from
hunting on Crown lands without licences, which are granted by the
police magistrates. If the latter always took the proper means to
ascertain the characters of those who apply for licences, and
conscientiously refused to grant them to men of known bad
character, the benefit conferred by this Act would be very great.
But as many of the so-called "kangarooers" are notorious cattle and
sheep stealers, the want of proper discrimination in the
magistrates is productive of infinite evil, and in some instances
not only neutralizes the effect of the Act, but adds to the
mischievous power of the vagabond "kangarooers" by permitting their
location on any of the Grown lands, however close to private
property, thus enabling them to carry on their nefarious
transactions with success and impunity.</p>

<p>Formerly, the size attained by the old "boomers" was enormous;
the hind quarters frequently weighed (when skinned and dressed)
from 70 to 90 lbs., and the whole animal from 120 to 160 lbs. These
were large powerful creatures, measuring in their common position
about five feet in height; but when they rise on their toes, with
the strong thick tail serving as a prop and support, they stand
above six feet high. When brought to bay, the old boomers fight
very resolutely, and if one can take up his favourite position, in
water about three feet deep, so that the dogs must swim to reach
him, he can keep off a whole pack. As each dog swims up, the
kangaroo lays him under water with his hand-like fore paws, holding
him down until another claims his attention, and so disposes of one
after another until the dogs are exhausted; and sometimes he tears
them dreadfully with the long sharp solid claws of his fore feet,
which he uses most adroitly, ripping and cutting in any direction
with sure effect. It is, I believe, generally supposed that they
inflict the most severe wounds with the hind feet, but this is not
the case until they are overcome and thrown down; as, when fighting
erect, they always raise themselves on their hind toes. Their
general colour is dark gray, or ash colour, lighter beneath. Mr.
Meredith, on one occasion, long ago, saw a pure white kangaroo, and
more recently we heard of another white one having been seen:
these, I imagine, are albinos, which seem to occur occasionally
among all animals.</p>

<p>The ordinary jump of the large kangaroo is about sixteen feet;
and they can clear a four-rail fence, about five feet high, in
their course, without any visible alteration or exertion.</p>

<p>All the species of kangaroo are easily tamed, and become as
familiar as any other domestic animal; but as all dogs here are
accustomed and trained to hunt and kill them, pets of this kind are
certain, sooner or later, to come to an untimely end. One which was
reared here some time back at last stood higher than the woman it
belonged to, and used to accompany her whenever she left home, just
as a dog would do, hopping along by her side in a most friendly and
companionable manner; but one day, meeting some strange dogs, it
was unfortunately hunted and killed. The young of all species of
kangaroo are commonly called Joeys, without regard to sex, but I am
not aware if this is a corruption of some native name, or one
bestowed by the early colonists.</p>

<p>The Brush Kangaroo (<i>Macropus Bennettii</i>) stands three feet
high in its usual position, with the hind elbow or heels bent up.
Its colour is dark iron-gray, lighter beneath. The doe, like that
of the forest species, has one young one at a time, which she
carries and shelters in the pouch, until the baby so much outgrows
its cradle, that the long legs and tail poke out.</p>

<p>The sweet gentle expression of face peculiar to the kangaroo
tribe is most beautiful and winning; their eyes are full, dark, and
soft, and the erect, animated, widely-open ears, in perpetual
motion, give at the same time a keen and yet timid expression to
the head. I never had so good an opportunity of observing the
different species of kangaroo, as in the collection which Sir
Eardley Wilmot kept as pets in a wooded and bushy paddock close to
Government House, Hobarton, where, within the paling fence, they
enjoyed their liberty, and being tolerably accustomed to visitors,
allowed themselves to be looked at very composedly; but in their
perfectly wild state, a passing glance is all that can be obtained.
The habits of the brush kangaroo are different from those of the
forester; they are never seen feeding in herds by day, and if two
or three chance to be started from the same vicinity, they all set
off in different directions. Usually they are not seen until roused
from the bush log or tussocks they have been crouching in, like a
hare in her form: their common average jump is about twelve
feet.</p>

<p>I have now (1850) two young brush kangaroos, Joey and Beppo,
living in a grassy inclosure close to the house, and associating
with my poultry very amicably; though they sometimes slily creep
after the peacock, as if with the intention of biting his long
gorgeous train, when it looks green in the sunshine, supposing it
perhaps to be some new vegetable. They are fed with green food,
bread, or corn, and are fond of new milk. They hold grass or leaves
in their hands, and eat very daintily and elegantly, never seeming
in any hurry, but helping themselves with a degree of refinement
and deliberation that might offer a salutary example to some nobler
animals. For a year I had only "Joey," and an old hen turkey
annoyed him exceedingly at one time, in her stupid terror lest he
should hurt her chickens, and chased him round the inclosure at a
furious pace; but by putting the old lady under a coop, I restored
poor "Joey's" peace and tranquillity. Both he and little Beppo
(which we have reared this year in the house like a pet kitten)
sleep some hours during the day, under the bower of boughs over
their kennel, and hop about and feed chiefly in the night-time.</p>

<p>The Wolloby is the species next in size to the Brush Kangaroo in
this colony; the name is usually spelled Wallaby, but the full
native pronunciation can only be correctly represented by using the
o instead of the a. In the aboriginal languages of these colonies,
the vowels are sounded peculiarly full and round.</p>

<p>The wolloby, in its common position, stands about two feet high;
the fur is gray, mingled with a brown tan colour, and is much
softer than the larger kangaroo's, being more like that of the
opossum. These animals frequent thickets and the dense close scrubs
near rivers and watercourses, where they baffle the most active
dogs by winding and popping in and out, like a rabbit in a
furzebrake. In chasing kangaroos, or, as it is technically termed,
"kangarooing," large powerful dogs are used; but in thickly-wooded
and scrubby places, a sharp clever <i>little</i> dog is also
required, to put the game out of the thickets, where the great dogs
could not penetrate. The wolloby and brush kangaroo often visit
gardens and fields at night, to banquet on the dainties they find
there; and by far the greatest portion of those destroyed are
caught in snares set for the purpose, in the tracks or "runs" they
frequent. There is, it would seem, about the same difference in the
habits of the forest, brush, and wolloby kangaroos, as that
existing between those of the deer, the hare, and the rabbit.</p>

<p>The Kangaroo-Rat (<i>Hypsiprymnus murinus</i>) is a pretty
little animal about thirteen inches in height, with grayish fur,
harsher than that of the kangaroo, and the face has more of a
<i>rattish</i> expression; nevertheless it is certainly a pretty
animal, and so easily tamed as to be frequently made a pet,
gambolling and frisking about the house, and following those who
caress it, like a favourite dog or cat. In their natural state they
eat grass, and also scratch and barrow at night for roots, and have
unluckily a very clever trick of digging their own potatoes, or
rather those of the settlers, which they appropriate without
scruple. They form warm nests of dry grass on the ground,
well-sheltered, and open at one side only. A prejudice exists
against eating their flesh, which is well-flavoured and whiter than
that of the true kangaroos, the latter being dark-coloured, lean,
tender, and more similar to hare than any other meat I am
acquainted with, and is undoubtedly excellent, when hung for a
sufficient length of time, and properly dressed. A very rich gravy
soup is often made from it, and a colonial dish called a "steamer,"
consisting of the meat and some good bacon finely minced, and
stewed in rich gravy, is also good; but the hind-quarters roasted,
with hare-stuffing and currant jelly, form a dish that Dr.
Kitchener himself would have applauded, and which now is generally
considered a dainty even here, especially by our town-friends. Yet
I have had servants who looked upon our eating kangaroo as
something absolutely monstrous, and turned away in horror at the
thought of partaking of what they expressively designated as
<i>"just a wild beast!"</i> A haunch of tiger or a wolf-chop would,
in their estimation, be quite as reasonable and proper food; but
fortunately they could always find an abundance of tame mutton in
our kitchen to console their outraged sensibility.</p>

<p>The kangaroo-rat is not by many persons considered fit to be
eaten, nor have I ever had one cooked, for we partake the common
prejudice&mdash;whether caused by the name, and the unpleasant
association of ideas inseparable from it, I know not; but as it is
a prejudice which serves to save the lives of the poor little
animals, I have not the slightest desire to have it removed.</p>

<p>Of the Bandicoot, two species are found here: one (<i>Perameles
Gunnii</i>) is of a light brownish ash-colour, half as large again
as a full-sized rat, and somewhat broader in proportion; the other
(<i>Perameles obescula</i>) is rather less, and its colour an ashy
fawn, striped with light gray.</p>

<p>One of our servants lately found two young striped bandicoots,
pretty little soft creatures like great mice, and brought them to
the children for pets. We kept them for some weeks, feeding them on
bread, milk, and raw potatoes; one was accidentally hurt, and died;
the other I turned out into the garden, thinking to bestow rather a
luxurious life upon him, amidst potatoes, fruit, and other good
things: but I could not prevail on him to accept his liberty; he
took up his abode in the parlour, and soon found a warm snug bed
among the multifarious contents of a deep work-basket, where he lay
coiled up all day, and grumbled and bit at any one who disturbed
him until his usual time of rising, about dusk, when he regularly
bounced out of the basket, ran to the corner where his saucer of
fresh milk was always placed, nibbled his bread or potato, and
scampered about all the evening like a great tame mouse, running
under our chairs and over our feet and dresses, and up the folds of
them, with confiding boldness, but not allowing any one to lay hold
of him. His end, poor little fellow, was, I fear, a violent one,
for I strongly suspect my demure tabby cat must have evaded our
wonted vigilance and gained access to the parlour during the time
poor Cooty was awake; for one morning, to the children's great
regret, his bed was cold and empty, and he was no more seen amongst
us.</p>

<p>The Porcupine (<i>Echidna</i>) is fully four times the size of
an English hedgehog, covered on the back with spines three or four
inches long, which protrude from a coat of thick grayish fur; its
feet have long toes, with long strong claws, and, instead of a
mouth and teeth, a long narrow round bill appears to complete its
extraordinary visage. It usually weighs five or six pounds, being
exceedingly fat. Persons who are partial to sucking pig like the
flesh of the porcupine, which somewhat resembles it, but is too
rich for most palates. These creatures are found in wet springy
ground, where they probably feed on tadpoles, worms, and ants. They
burrow in the earth, and often frequent hollows in moist rocks, and
if pursued or hemmed in, make their escape by scratching a hole and
sinking into it. Mr. Meredith once brought one from the Schoutens
to Swan Port, and on landing put it down on the broad open beach,
where, being left for a few moments, it burrowed down into the sand
and vanished in an incredibly short space of time, scarcely leaving
a trace behind.</p>

<p>On another occasion one was found by the dogs on one of the
rocky hills of the tier, and was safely carried down to me in a
covered tin boiler. Knowing the mysterious subterranean habits of
my new friend, I was not a little puzzled how to accommodate him
without losing him; and, as a temporary arrangement, he was
deposited at the bottom of a wooden churn, which I thought
sufficiently deep to prevent his absconding. Shortly after, on
going to look at my captive, I found him, as is shown in my sketch,
clinging by his long claws to the top of the churn, with his
conical head peeping over. The duck-like bill is nearly as thin and
round as a tobacco-pipe, and about two inches long, and gave an
indescribably droll kind of pursed-up whistling expression to the
strange creature's face, as his bright little eyes peered about him
from out their furry nooks; the short broad tail, thickly beset
with spines, like the back and sides, being spread out in a fan
shape, not unlike that of a lobster. I was very curious to watch
the ways of this anomalous little animal for a while, and to keep
it confined for that purpose; but there was something so pitiful,
though absurd, in the pleading, helpless, puzzled look of its queer
face, as it seemed prying into mine, that was to me quite
irresistible, knowing, as I well did, the difficulty, not to say
impossibility, of keeping it alive, far less making it happy; so I
at once carried it to my garden, let it crawl away, and saw it
immediately commence a sidling kind of motion, casting up a
circular ridge of earth, beneath which in a few seconds it had
effectually screwed itself out of sight. I hoped it would have
taken up its abode there, but we never could find a sign or vestige
of it afterwards.</p>

<p>The Wombat (<i>Phascolomys &mdash;&mdash;</i>), like the porcupine, is
eaten and relished by some persons, but is fatter and coarser, with
a strong rank flavour. It is a most harmless, helpless, inoffensive
animal, by no means agile, and falling an easy prey to its
pursuers, if cut off from its retreat to the rocky hollows and
crevices in which it lives, and which it squeezes into, through a
smaller opening than would be supposed capable of admitting its fat
squab body. Its head resembles that of the badger, but with a
rounder snout. It has very small eyes, strong bristly whiskers,
very short ears, short legs, short tail, and long coarse gray hair.
Its body is broad and flat, and weighs from 30 lbs. to 50 lbs., and
the creature's whole aspect betokens slowness and inactivity.</p>

<p>The children of a settler at the river Mersey had a pet wombat,
which lived with them for some time, and used to play with them,
and follow them about with great docility and good temper. They
made it a bed on a box, with a piece of blanket to cover it, and it
was often seen to scratch the blanket snugly round it, and pull it
up when slipping away, in the most cosy and civilized manner
possible. Having also a <i>penchant</i> for making its way into any
other bed from which a scrap of blanket or rug hung down to serve
as a climbing ladder, it became an object of dislike to the
servants, and the worthy farmer determined, much to the grief of
the children, to part with the favourite, which, like all other
favourites, was fast gaining foes. He carried it away a
considerable distance, put it down in the forest, and returned home
with the story of his success; but ere the evening was ended, a
certain well-known scratching sound was heard at the door, and the
delighted children opened it for their poor weary wombat, who had
found his way home to them again. A second time he was conveyed
away, and to a greater distance, but still he came back; the third
time the farmer carried him across the Mersey in a boat, and left
him on the opposite bank of the broad deep river, quite secure now
that the business was finally settled. His poor friend was,
however, still of a different opinion, and by the time the boat had
touched the home shore, the creature bad found a huge fallen tree,
which lay half across the stream, and had crawled to the extreme
end of it, wistfully gazing upon his departing friends, who,
thinking it quite impossible that he could cross the intervening
portion of the river, went away home. How the heavy fat thing
<i>did</i> cross, no one knows, but he arrived as usual that night,
and, as may be imagined, his kind-hearted master did not try again
to drive him away. Unfortunately, he was at last accidentally
burned, from creeping too close to the hot ashes of the hearth,
and, in mercy to his sufferings, was killed.</p>

<p>Wombats are generally found on rocky places, especially the
summits of mountains and gullies, where their haunts are mostly
inaccessible. Their chief food consists of the roots of the
grass-tree and other plants, to procure which they leave their
rocky fastnesses at night, and visit neighbouring marshy flats,
where they scratch for their living, like the porcupine and
bandicoot. The skin of the wombat is so thick and tough that the
teeth of large dogs are seldom strong enough to penetrate it, and
are not unfrequently absolutely pulled out in the effort, so that
some of the hunters of the Bush are in the habit of punishing their
dogs for meddling with a wombat; and after a few such lessons, the
dogs content themselves with barking round the harmless creature
when they find one, and its stout natural coat befriends it like a
suit of armour.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1-15" id="ch1-15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">The "Devil."&mdash;Native
Cat.&mdash;Tiger-cat.&mdash;Native Tiger, or Hyena.&mdash;In at the
Death.&mdash;Musk-rat.&mdash;Platypus.&mdash;Opossum Mouse.&mdash;Kangaroo Mouse.</p>

<p>The "Devil" is the name universally given here to the
<i>Dasyurus ursinus</i>, and, as I have never heard any other
appellation applied to this very ugly, savage, mischievous little
beast, I must be permitted to use the one hitherto bestowed on it.
This species is entirely black; another kind (<i>D. macrourus</i>),
sometimes called "Spotted-tail," has a white tip to the tail, and a
white stripe, extending down the throat and between the forelegs,
towards which it sometimes spreads, forming three limbs of a cross:
the pied species is rather less than the other, and not so
numerous, but in all other respects they are alike. The body is 18
or 20 inches long, and the head forms nearly a third of this, being
large, broad, and flat, apparently very destitute of brains. The
jaws open to a terrific extent, nearly to the back of the enormous
head, and are armed with large powerful teeth, like those of a dog.
The tail is so stiff and unpliant, as to seem more like a wooden
than a real one; when the animal runs, the tail sticks straight
out. The feet resemble those of a dog, but the paws are more spread
out, and have large strong claws. The creature has an awkward
wobbling gait, and its pace is slow, as compared with that of most
other wild animals. Mr. Meredith has at different times caught
them, by fairly running them down; one of these was full grown, and
ran for three-quarters of a mile, when, just as Mr. Meredith came
close up with it, it suddenly stood still, and snapped at his legs,
as he, unable to stop himself, jumped over it; he, however, soon
killed it. The other two were younger ones, and were killed after a
much shorter chase.</p>

<p>The devil's cry is a little like that of the opossum, but sounds
ill-natured and spiteful, instead of the pleasant merry chuckle of
the latter. The devils are often fearfully destructive, killing
great numbers of lambs. At one of my father's stations on the
Apsley River, north of Swan Port, the shepherds caught in a
pitfall, during one winter, no less than a hundred and forty-three
devils. They frequently appear to roam about in small packs, and,
if a lamb he killed by one, the sheep are immediately removed to a
distance, and traps set in the run; these are generally successful,
and seven, eight, or more of these animals are caught in quick
succession, after which months may elapse without the same spot
being infested with them again. They, like the more valuable native
animals, are gradually becoming rare in all the occupied parts of
the island. A dead one, which was brought for me to see, so swarmed
with <i>fleas</i>, that they formed a continuous brown under-coat
all over its body, amongst the coarse, harsh, black hair; and the
place on the veranda, where it was laid down for a few moments,
became covered with them in such myriads as to force me with all my
natural-history inquisitiveness to make way for mops and buckets of
cold water.</p>

<p>The "Native Cat" of New South Wales, which I formerly described,
is another species of <i>Dasyurus</i>, and the "Tiger-cat" of this
island, I imagine, belongs also to this ferocious family. It is
larger than the "native cat," and its colour is a handsome chestnut
brown, spotted with white. Its habits are of the same savage
destructive kind as those of the rest of its kindred.</p>

<p>The "Native Tigers" (<i>Thylacinus cynocephalus</i>) are yet
more to be dreaded among sheep than the "devils;" but, fortunately,
they are far less numerous. The tiger is a large powerful animal,
about the size of the largest kind of sheep-dog, but more muscular.
I have the skin of one, measuring 4 feet 6 inches from the nose to
the end of the back, the tail being 1 foot 10 inches long in
addition, compressed laterally, and set on more like that of a
kangaroo than that of a dog. The hind legs have the lower joints
peculiarly short, more so than those of a greyhound, and the animal
frequently rests the whole joint on the ground, even when in a
standing position*.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The woodcut of this creature in "Murray's
Encyclopaedia of Geography" is a good portrait of it; the best I
have yet seen.]</p>

<p>The first opportunity I had of noticing the animal alive, was
when a shepherd in the neighbourhood came to show us one about
two-thirds grown, which he had caught in a snare. Having killed the
mother and caught the cub, he came to show his prize, and receive
the usual tribute of money or tobacco, which is always given for a
tiger killed or taken. He had the animal secured by a chain and
collar, and when it was to be carried off, slipped a strong bag
very adroitly over its head and shoulders, pushed the hind legs in,
and fastened it. I pitied the unhappy beast most heartily, and
would fain have begged more gentle usage for him; but I was
compelled to acknowledge some coercion necessary, as, when I softly
stroked his back (after taking the precaution of engaging his great
teeth in the discussion of a piece of meat), I was in danger of
having my hand snapped off.</p>

<p>I obtained a place for this tiger in Sir Eardley Wilmot's
collection; but its untamable ferocity and savageness resisted all
endeavours to civilize and tame it, and, in consequence, the
carefully-stuffed skin was eventually preserved, instead of the
living form of my ungentle protg.</p>

<p>I believe the tigers are truly untamable, and in that respect,
if in no other, merit the name sometimes given them of Native
Hyena; at least, I know several instances in which young ones have
been kept and reared up kindly (chained, of necessity); but they
never could be approached with safety, even by those who daily fed
them; and so, on the whole, are perhaps rather ill adapted for
pets. Their colour is very light brown, handsomely marked across
the hind-quarters with ten or twelve straight bands of black, the
hindmost ones about an inch wide on the top of the back, and
tapering off on either side. The stripes become narrower and less
distinct as they approach the shoulders, where they cease entirely.
The head is much like that of a dog, and would be far from ugly
were its expression less savage. The ears are short, open, broad,
and erect, and look very soft; but I did not attempt to touch them,
my previous attentions having been so rudely repulsed. The feet are
also like those of a dog, and the legs thick and muscular; but the
tiger is by no means so swift as its appearance would indicate.</p>

<p>The common pace of the tiger is a measured, steady canter, and,
from various anecdotes I have heard, it appears that they pursue
the object of their chase wholly by scent, and win (literally) "in
the long run" by their long endurance. On one occasion Mr. Adam
Amos, of Swan Port, had made his way, by a new track, to the top of
the encompassing tier of mountains which separate the Swan Port
district from the interior; after he had travelled for some time
along the ridge of one of the numerous narrow steep "saddles," as
they are termed, among the hills, the ground became so rocky that
the fat cattle he was driving could not proceed any further, and he
and his party encamped for the night. The next morning, about
daybreak, they prepared to return, and were getting breakfast, when
a brush kangaroo came dong the ridge where they were, and hopped
past, within a few yards of their fire. In ten minutes after this,
a female tiger came cantering along in the same line, with her nose
close to the ground, scenting out the kangaroo, and passed round
the fire exactly in the same track, not noticing the cattle-party,
who were observing the chase with some curiosity. About twenty
minutes now elapsed, when two young tiger-whelps appeared, holding
the same course, and, passing round the fire, went on after their
mother, who, with her steady pace, would finally run down the more
swift but less enduring kangaroo, and the cubs, following on her
track, if not actually "in at the death," were no doubt in
excellent time for the dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith, whilst one day gathering wild cattle, having
followed them into a thick scrub, dismounted, and sat down for a
while to let his horse rest after the hard chase; shortly after, on
hearing a loud heavy crashing amongst the sticks, he thought that
some of the cattle had turned in that direction, when a very large
tiger burst through the thicket, and came close by him, paused an
instant to look at him, and then, dropping its nose again to the
ground, followed on along the track of the cattle. They will, when
hard pressed by hunger, attack even man. A servant being engaged,
some years since, in a thick scrub, cutting "tea-tree" poles, an
old tiger came up, and would have attacked him, but, being weak and
apparently half-starved, was quickly knocked down and secured, and
the man brought him home, where he was chained up and well fed, and
so lived for some time. Being old and nearly toothless, the poor
beast had been unable to procure his usual food, and was thus
rendered daring and desperate.</p>

<p>The Musk-rat is a pretty little harmless animal, common in most
rivers in Van Diemen's Land, and I have often watched them swimming
about of an evening. They live in holes, which they burrow in the
river-banks, and seem to be of similar habits to the English
water-vole, but are fully twice its size. Their fur is soft, and of
a reddish brown, paler beneath; the tail is well furred, like the
body, and is white at the end, like that of the ring-tailed
opossum. The head is an enlarged portrait of the water-vole, with
similarly rounded nose, and long whiskers, very pretty and
gentle-looking: an odour of musk pervades the whole animal. The
noise they sometimes make, when playing in a river on a dark night,
would half induce one to fancy a shoal of porpoises were
floundering there, instead of these frisky little creatures;
plopping in from the high bank, scuffling along the water, and
splashing loudly about, they seem to glory in their agile
nimbleness; and I have often regretted that the darkest nights were
the seasons of their chief revels, when they could only be heard
and not seen; for a musk-rat, swimming staidly and stilly across
the river in the dim twilight, evidently charged with business of
grave import, wears a totally different aspect from the mad,
frolicsome, dissipated fellows of the night's revelry. One morning,
in passing along a path near a creek, we espied one of them couched
under a log, amongst some scrub; he had, doubtless, stayed out too
late over night, and was overtaken by daylight before he could
reach home. Be this as it may, the opportunity of seeing one of his
species on dry land was too rare to be neglected, and he very
quietly permitted our scrutiny, only creeping more closely under
the log when we threw leaves or chips at him to make him move, and
uttering, by way of remonstrance, a sound something similar to that
of the opossum. As soon as we left the place, we saw him dart
across the path in the direction of the creek.</p>

<p>Another species of water-rat frequents the river Mersey, on the
north coast of Van Diemen's Land, which is like the musk-rat in its
habits, form, and size, but has no white spot on the tail, nor is
it at all scented with musk.</p>

<p>The Platypus (<i>Ornithorhyncus paradoxus</i>) is not common in
Tasmania, but a few are found in some of the northern rivers, the
Mersey, Forth, &amp;c., precisely similar to those in New South
Wales.</p>

<p>The two rarest and most beautiful little animals in the island
are commonly known as the kangaroo mouse and the opossum mouse. Of
the latter, I have seen three specimens, and most lovely, soft,
curious little things they are; about the size of, or rather larger
than, an English dormouse, with gray fur, soft as down, bright,
full black eyes, wide transparent mouse-like ears, and prehensile
tail, naked on the under side. The little face has the gentle
expression of most of the kangaroo and opossum tribe; but during
the daytime it is so snugly nestled round in its warm fur, and the
closely-curled tail laid so carefully over it, that until the
little creature is disturbed, it looks like a round gray ball,
which, on being gently moved, gives to view the delicate little
head; and this, looking imploringly at the intruder, utters a low
kind of grumbling sigh, and tucks itself out of sight more
completely than ever. At night it grows more lively, and, when so
kept as to permit in some measure the display of its natural
habits, is very active and graceful. A few fresh branches hung from
the ceiling of a room, with the box or cage in which the mouse is
kept placed among them with its door open, form a contrivance that
sometimes answers, if the house be free from cats; the elegant
movements of the agile sprightly little creature are then
exceedingly amusing.</p>

<p>In their natural state, they inhabit holes in trees where they
form exquisitely neat nests of grass and fibres, lined with soft
down or web, and are seldom discovered until the tree is felled
which contains their tiny habitation. Of the three I have seen, one
was so found at "The Bogs," on the Swan Port tier, and given to our
friend Mr. J. B. Jukes, who, I believe, kept it alive on board the
"Fly" for nearly a year. Another jumped out from an old charred
tree at Port Sorell, which Mr. Meredith set fire to; he caught the
mouse and brought it to me in his hat; but, after looking at it
awhile, we gave the poor little terrified panting creature its
liberty, near its old haunt. The third was chopped out, nest and
all, from a tree which one of our servants was cutting up for
firewood, near the same place, and this one travelled to Hobarton
in a tin wafer-box, lined with flannel and wool, to join Sir
Eardley Wilmot's collection of native animals. During the time I
kept it, it frisked about merrily at night, and ate heartily of
bread slightly moistened and well sugared. I also provided it with
fresh green food and rose-leaves, but the bread and sugar alone
were eaten.</p>

<p>A fourth specimen was destined for me by our head shepherd, who
kept it for some time in his hut, where it lived in a tin canister
on the chimney-piece, going in and out of its small dwelling as it
pleased, and becoming quite tame; but being allowed so much
liberty, it apparently wished for more, and ran away.</p>

<p>The female has several young ones at a time, which are most
beautiful diminutive little morsels of animal life.</p>

<p>The Kangaroo Mouse I only know from description, never having
been fortunate enough to see one. I believe it is much more slender
and long in the limbs than the opossum mouse, but with the same
general appearance and habits. One was lately caught near the
Mersey by the settler whom I have already mentioned as having the
tame wombat; seeing the little animal darting between his feet, he
closed them at the instant and captured it. This was a female, with
seven young ones in her pouch; all suffered the usual sad fate of
such prizes, being doomed to imprisonment, and in a short time they
died.</p>

<p>All the opossum tribe, when in a state of captivity, are very
fond of sugar, and if suffered will eat it to excess. They will
also eat tea-leaves, tobacco, and meat, all of which are unnatural
to them; and I have no doubt that the usual very early deaths of
tamed opossums are chiefly owing to such injudicious variety of
food.</p>

<p>These "mice," as we call them, belong, I believe, to the genus
<i>Phascogale</i>, and are marsupial, and with the pouch opening
anteriorly, as is the case in all those which sit upright, jump on
the hind feet, and use the fore-paws as hands, such as the kangaroo
and opossum families.</p>

Sluggish.&mdash;My Tame Opossum.&mdash;Mischievous Pranks.&mdash;The Opossum at
Supper.&mdash;Awful Thunder-Storm.&mdash;Varieties of Opossum.&mdash;The
Ring-tailed Species.</p>

<p>Having in my former "Sketches" alluded to the common opossums,
which are alike denizens of New South Wales and Tasmania, I need
not minutely describe them again, but must beg to point out what
seems to me a lamentable error in the account given of their habits
in a recent and generally very interesting work*, of which only a
few of the earlier numbers have reached us. They are there
described as <i>"sluggish and stupid!"</i> Perhaps I ought, in the
first place, to acknowledge my own former ignorance in calling them
"opossums" at all, seeing that the zoologically learned have
demonstrated them to be "Phalangers," as I learn from the work in
question; but it is so hard to know a thing suddenly by a new name,
whilst every day brings the familiar use of the old one, by which
the creatures are known here, that I fear it will be long ere I
learn to adopt readily the new and proper appellation of my old
favourites.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "The Pictorial Museun of Animated Nature."
London: Charles Knight and Co.]</p>

<p>And now as to their sluggishness and stupidity. That a poor
imprisoned animal, shut up in a small box or cage, fed on
unwholesome and unnatural food, and removed to an ungenial climate,
where it is never permitted to enjoy the free use of its limbs, may
seem stupid, is very possible, especially if only observed in the
daytime. When in its natural state, it is always fast asleep in its
nest in some dark hollow tree, or coiled up in a thick tussock or
bush; but this same creature, in its own mild climate, and in full
possession of its liberty and health, is as far removed from the
"sluggish" or "stupid" as any in the whole glorious creation; and
if the unconscious writer of that sad libel could mark, as I have
done, the scampering, climbing, and chattering, and the headlong
frolicsome gambols of the woolly elves in our forests on a
moonlight night, or witness the havoc which morning shows, after
their exploits in the harvest-field, which was over-night as neatly
laid out as a newly-set chess-board, he would instantly re-cast his
unfair paragraph. At harvest-time they are specially provoking: I
have seen one of our fields left in the evening ready for the next
day's carting; the rich heavy sheaves nicely set up and "capped" in
compact shocks, running in even lines from end to end (and in a
"paddock" of thirty acres and upwards, as this was, the sight is a
most pleasant one), and I have visited the same field in the
morning, to be reluctantly convinced that my favourite opossums
were really the mischievous imps they are considered. Scarcely a
line of shocks remained as it was, but numbers of them lay
prostrate, the sheaves scattered, the hands untied, and the heavy
corn beaten and trampled down, partly eaten, and scratched about in
woeful waste and disorder. The chief scenes of the destruction were
within wide circles round several very large dead gum-trees, which
had been "ringed" and left to perish (a ring of bark taken off all
round causes a tree to die, although the breadth of an inch left
entire saves it); and up and down these trees, and among their
great bare branches, and round about amongst the shocks of corn, it
appeared that the maddest of the revel had gone on. No doubt the
kangaroos had been of the party, and had taken their share in the
mischief, but the opossums were pronounced to be the principal
delinquents.</p>

<p>I kept one of the common species tame for some months, and know
their troublesome activity but too well. One of our servants, when
out at night shooting them, killed two does, each having a young
one in her pouch, and these he brought to me. They were then about
two-thirds the size of an English squirrel, grayish brown,
soft-furred, sweet-faced little creatures; and I, as delighted with
my prize as a child, directly ordered a large tea-chest to be made
into a cage, with thin bars, and a door at one side to put them in.
As the man went on preparing the new abode, he observed
quietly,&mdash;"Ah! ma'am, I've known a many people as kep' tame
'possums, but never a one as wasn't glad to be quit of 'em
again!"</p>

<p>This, however, I treated as a most unworthy prejudice on the
part of our good servitor, and diminished nothing of my zeal for
the comfort of my poor little orphan pets. I gave them a warm bed
of wool and fresh hay, in which they completely hid themselves
during the day, clasping each other with their paws and tails into
one round ball. I fed them with bread soaked in milk, and slightly
sweetened, but for the first few evenings I had to give it to them
very carefully with a small spoon, not noticing their sharp little
claws and teeth; and afterwards they fed themselves, picking a
piece out of the saucer and holding it in their fore-paws, which,
as well as the hind feet, have the toes so long and slender as to
seem just like fingers, and in these little creatures the texture
and colour of the skin was soft and fair, quite a delicate pink,
like a baby's fingers. They grew fast, and played with each other
at night, as well as their roomy cage would permit, and after a
time began to eat fresh young ears of corn, grass, parsley,
&amp;c., in addition to their constant meal of bread and milk. One
day, when I was clipping the thyme-edging of my flower borders, I
unfortunately offered them a small bit of it in blossom. One of
them refused it, but the other ate a young sprig about two inches
long, and coiled itself to sleep again. A friend who dined with us
that day, hearing me mention having given some thyme to the
opossum, immediately said that it would die, as he had known others
killed in a similar manner. At night, when the cage was as usual
carried in from the veranda to the hall, I saw that the one which
had eaten the thyme was ill, and would not touch its food; its eyes
were dim, its nose hot and dry, and its stomach frightfully
distended. My attempts to remedy the evil I had so unconsciously
done were all unavailing, and I put the poor little creature back
into its cage, hoping, but not expecting, to see it recover; its
companion seemed greatly distressed and puzzled by its sad
condition, and tried to rouse it up to play as usual, but it grew
worse, and in the morning was dead.</p>

<p>The survivor continued growing and thriving well, and soon got
so clever as to open the fastening of his cage and let himself out
into the hall, as soon as he had finished supper, and then such a
scampering and scrambling and leaping and scuffling began, as no
decent household, who did not keep "tame 'possums," ever heard
before! Up the wall, and along the row of hat-pegs, knocking off
all the hats and parasols to begin with; then, before you have time
to catch a glimpse of the madcap, down he pops, and, with a
half-jumping half-cantering sort of run, takes advantage of the
door being left ajar for a moment, to frisk past you into the
parlour; then climbing up the back of a chair, he twiris his long
tail over the top, and swings by it gently to and fro, looking
about him the while with a sly upturned face, till suddenly he
takes aim at the sideboard, springs upon that, kicking off anything
in his way, such as a stray decanter or flower-vase, and runs round
the raised back to the centre scroll-work, where he sits a moment
or two, and, while glancing round with his bright, glittering,
black eyes, you see he is plotting new mischief, though he pretends
to be wholly engaged in combing his whiskers with a fore-paw, or
surveying the curling end of that mysterious
proboscis-finger-hook-like tail. Some one moves or speaks, and off
he flies, with a slide along the piano, and a scramble round the
architrave of the door, and there he is, hooked up above it to a
picture-frame; dangling again by his tail for a second or two,
before that sudden <i>plop</i> down to the floor, and the quick
scamper up the drawn curtains by his claws, till he secures a safe
and unmolested seat on the top of the cornice, whence he
complacently surveys all below: and all this in a quarter of the
time it will take to read it! Never surely was there such a
beautiful, graceful, innocent-faced, sly, wicked little piece of
mischief! If my open work-box were on the table, he made it a rule
to spring up, hook his tail to the lid, and straightway upset the
whole apparatus, flying before the scattered contents into a
corner, and peeping out like a sly, spoiled, half-shy,
half-frightened child; or if, determined not to notice him, we sat
still and silent, he would slily climb the back of my chair and
gently claw my shoulder or bite my elbow; whilst his favourite
method of attracting Mr. Meredith's attention was to bite his toe,
or pull the skirt of his coat, and then scamper off to hide
himself, only to return the next moment and repeat the game. He
stood in some awe of the cat, with whom he frequently tried to
establish a pleasant and playful understanding, but in vain.
Mistress puss possibly considered him a rival in her share of my
affections, and always repulsed his advances very rudely: when she
merely clawed at him, he ran away; but if she forgot herself so far
as to spit or growl, he instantly turned back, and looked at her
very earnestly, as if debating within himself how such an indignity
should be received, or whether the offensive demonstrations were
really directed to him!</p>

<p>At last we made a rule, never to admit Willy* of an evening,
until we were disposed to be idle; for to read, write, or work,
with this spirit of fidget in the room, was impossible; and he was
restricted to the hall and passage, with a fresh young wattle-tree
(perpetually renewed), set upright in a stand, for his especial
comfort: this was a kind and clever contrivance of his masters,
that our favourite might enjoy something of his native habits, in
swinging amongst the branches. Perhaps the drollest thing was, to
see him at supper, after he had attained the size of a cat, and was
quite independent in his ways and manners. His tree stood close
beside the table where his cage and saucer of bread and milk were
placed at night, and as he hung like a great live pendulum, swaying
about from a high branch, he would stretch out one hand, and,
taking a piece of bread, proceed very composedly to eat it, with
his head hanging down, nd his hind legs uppermost. The sight of my
little playfellow swallowing his food in this topsy-turvy style,
was enough to give any one a fit of indigestion at least.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The name used by the natives of New South
Wake for the opossum.]</p>

<p>Willy fully appreciated the honour of being admitted to our
society, and used to make clamorous demands to be let in, long
before the appointed hour, by running round the architrave of the
parlour door, and crying angrily from the top; one night, as if to
spite us, he contrived to slip into our bedroom unknown to the
housemaid, who had orders to keep the door shut. We had missed him
for some time, and, on going into our room and looking about, I saw
the bright wicked eyes peeping at me over the cornice of the bed,
and could soon have dislodged Master Willy; but, as Mr. Meredith
had no objection to his company, he remained, keeping up such a
ceaseless scamper up and down the curtains, rattling the rings, and
scuffling about, that sleep was out of the question, and I feared
lest he might jump down on George's cot, and awake him in a fright;
so, striking a light, and putting on strong gloves, I watched my
opportunity, and, seizing his tail the next time it appeared, I
gently disengaged his claws and handed him into the passage, where
he grumbled and scampered round the door-case till I fell
asleep.</p>

<p>One evening when the weather was very sultry, with constant
lightning and distant thunder, Willy failed to make his usual
disturbance, and I searched for him in vain. He had eaten his bread
and milk, and was gone, no one knew whither; chimneys, pantry,
beds&mdash;every place was examined, but no Willy could be seen, and we
gave him up for lost, when, in returning along the hall, I saw
something long and dark, hanging from one of Mr. Meredith's hats,
against the wall; this proved to be Possy's tail, and all the rest
of him lay tightly screwed up in the crown of the hat. I would not
have him disturbed, and we never heard him move until near
daylight. The tempest increased to a fearful height; I never heard
so awful a thunder-storm, and the lightning was for seven or eight
hours literally incessant; the flashes, blue and blindingly vivid,
seemed to come several at once, and the simultaneous peals of
thunder were deafening; their tremendous and closely-successive
explosions, loudly reverberated by the surrounding mountain tiers,
were truly terrific*.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The aborigines of New South Wales have a
great dread of thunder and lightning, and their words for these
phenomena are singularly expressive, especially when uttered in
their significant and earnest manner. They call lightning "mik''ka"
(very short and sharp), and thunder is "moo'rooboo'rooboroy," with
a lengthened rumbling pronunciation.]</p>

<p>Willy, with animal instinct, had doubtless known that a storm
was at hand, and as, if in the forest, he would have lain quiet in
his hollow tree, so, although well housed, he sought a place of
close concealment, nor tried any of his wonted vagaries, until the
storm had passed over.</p>

<p>Latterly he often opened his cage (which was fastened by a
leather loop over a nail), before the time at which it was usually
carried indoors; but I felt no apprehension of losing him, as he
always cantered into the house, our front door leading to the
veranda and garden, being always open during the day. One evening,
the servants were otherwise occupied, and I, having fed Willy in
the veranda, forgot him, until after the door had been shut for the
night, and then, on seeking him, I found that my "bird was flown,"
and the cage opened as usual. After this, we almost nightly heard
an opossum on the roof, and various things left about, outside,
were tossed over, very much in Willy's scrambling style, so that we
believed the house to be still visited by its old inmate; but,
though tempted with saucers of fresh sweet bread and milk for many
nights, he never returned to his old cage: nor, I must candidly
own, should I have desired to recover my pretty plague, could I
have felt certain he was safe and happy; for I <i>had</i> sometimes
acknowledged that keeping one "tame 'possum" had given me quite a
sufficient insight into their manners and habits in a domestic
state.</p>

<p>If any of my readers find this memoir of a pet "Phalanger"
somewhat prolix, they must attribute my tediousness to my zeal for
science, and my desire to make known whatever knowledge I may
possess on this interesting subject: judging from the work before
alluded to, which is the only recent book on natural history I have
perused, these creatures are not very well known. Should I ever
return to dear old England, I seriously contemplate bringing with
me a large "consignment" of young opossums, for the especial solace
and consolation of such of my friends as are now constrained to
pamper apoplectic lap-dogs, asthmatic cats, spiteful parrots, and
disgusting apes; confident that, by so doing, I shall confer an
inestimable benefit on society in general, and benevolent maiden
ladies in particular.</p>

<p>The black, golden, and gray opossums are, I imagine, distinct
varieties, although identical in nature and habits. Our barn and
stack-yard were often visited by them, and sometimes they came
boldly about the house early in the night; one evening Mr. Meredith
shot two very large ones in a wattle-tree within six yards of the
kitchen door.</p>

<p>The "Ring-tailed Opossum" of Van Diemen's Land <i>(Phalangista
viverrina)</i> is a smaller species than the common one, and still
more elegant and agile, although I have seen them the size of a
full-grown cat. Like their kindred, they sleep by day and play by
night, when they hop and swing among the branches of trees with
even a greater degree of rope-dancer buoyancy than the others. One
which was kept at Cambria some years since, was occasionally
admitted to the dining-room at dessert time, and once, desiring to
lower himself down over the tables-edge, and at the same time hold
on to it, he clasped the end of his tail tightly round the stem of
a wine-glass, and boldly swung off, woefully surprised to find his
frail support and himself on the floor together.</p>

<p>The ring-tails are gray, the under parts being of a lighter
shade than the back, and about two inches at the tip of the tail is
white; they seem to possess more sagacity than most of their kind,
as they are never caught sleeping on the ground in the daytime, a
situation in which so many opossums are killed by dogs.</p>

Hen.&mdash;Bittern.&mdash;Presents of Pets.</p>

<p>I well remember the extreme wonder and amusement with which,
years ago, we read in England the accounts of chasing the wild
cattle here, and, with something bordering on incredulity, heard of
"milking cows leaping five-barred gates like fox-hunters." I have
since discovered that there was no romance whatever in the story,
for some of our wild herd here would in the Bush outstrip the
fleetest horse; and when "yarded," that is, put in a stock-yard of
massive logs, five or six feet high, would frequently clear the
top-rail at a bound. I dreaded the periodical "collecting of
cattle," more than any other duty attendant on the farming
operations; suffered great anxiety while it lasted, and always
thankfully rejoiced to see "Master," men, and horses return home
without serious injury, after one of their campaigns of a week or
fortnight's duration; a station at some distance from home being
the usual centre of attention. The poor horses rarely escaped being
hurt by severe falls, besides being nearly ridden to death. Not
that a helter-skelter chase is the method adopted, for, if the
cattle are once suffered to start off at the top of their speed,
they become perfectly mad, and very little chance remains of
regaining them that day at least. The utmost care and skill are
required to avoid alarming them; and the grand object is, not to
make them run, but to prevent their doing so. Four horsemen are
usually sufficient to collect a small herd of two or three hundred
cattle.</p>

<p>When near the place where they expect to find a herd, they ride
quietly and silently along in "Indian file," through the Bush, and
the first person who discovers the cattle gives a low whistle, when
all stop, and, observing their position, separate, and endeavour to
surround them, but more especially to cut off their retreat into a
thicket or swamp, or other hiding-place, where pursuit would be
impossible; the chief endeavour being to get them into a piece of
open country, where the stock-riders can circle them round and
round, so as to narrow the space they occupy, and get them to
stand, which is the great difficulty, and care is taken not to
scare or alarm them in any way. Sometimes one or two or more dart
away and, if not recovered immediately, are suffered to gallop off,
as, whilst pursuing them, the rest might be lost. Other "lots"
belonging to the herd are collected and joined to these, and the
whole driven, or rather manoeuvred, in the direction of the station
or stockyard, where the calves are to be branded with the mark of
the owner, and steers, cows, and "beef" selected for use. On
approaching a "scrub," with only a narrow cattle-path through it,
one or two of the stock-keepers ride on ahead to the clear ground,
so as to be in readiness to check the cattle when they emerge upon
it, otherwise they would again set off at full speed. They are then
conducted along; with one horseman ahead, to keep them from going
too fast, one on each side, and one behind; and if this, the proper
routine, can be observed, the gathering is thought to be very
easily accomplished.</p>

<p>Horses accustomed to the task understand the whole programme as
well as their riders, and will pursue a run-away beast through an
intricate forest, or avoid the attacks of the infuriated animals,
with the most nimble adroitness.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, these wild animals have a strong repugnance
to enter a gate, and care is taken, on their approach, to leave all
open and clear for them, and to remove out of sight all dogs,
people, and everything that is likely to alarm them. I have often
seen the drove selected for use, and not considered wild, as
compared with many others, brought within a few yards of the
gateway leading to our farm-yard several hours before they could be
got through it. They would often approach tolerably near, as if
about to trot quietly in, when, with a start and a snort, they
would burst off, some one way, some another, through the river,
into the scrub, "o'er the hills and far away," and the poor weary
horses be compelled to gallop furiously after them, till the "lot"
was again collected, and perhaps with the same result, again and
again. Sometimes a party of more civilized animals were turned out
to meet and mix with the strangers, who might possibly be beguiled
into rushing in with them altogether, but this plan would only
answer occasionally.</p>

<p>Extreme activity, nerve, and presence of mind are essential in
the business of the stock-yard, where fifty or more of these raging
creatures are pent up together and it is necessary for persons to
go in amongst them to draft certain of them off, "rope" them (i.e.
catch them by flinging a noose over their heads), &amp;c.,
avoiding, as they best may, the apparently inevitable fate of being
impaled on some pair of the entangled mass of horns threatening
them on all sides, the only mode of escape being by a leap over the
stock-yard itself, when a stumble, or a moment's hesitation, might
be fatal.</p>

<p>Some of the cows from such a herd are very troublesome before
they can be quietly milked, and it is necessary to have a kind of
pillory, called a "milking bail," in which, without hurting them,
their heads are held fast, and a leg of the refractory ones tied
also, to prevent them from injuring both themselves and the milkman
who, with the aid of this simple contrivance, seldom fails in soon
making them quiet. Sometimes they have an incorrigible desire to
run away back to the hills, leaving their calves, and the rich
pasture, and a life of ease, to go galloping about with the
herd.</p>

<p>"Milkmaids" are out of the question among such cattle as these,
so that the pictures, so common at home, of buxom damsels tripping
about with pails and three-legged stools, would find few living
resemblances here.</p>

<p>A number of cattle together is here usually termed a "mob," and
truly their riotous and unruly demeanour renders the designation in
this case far from inapt; but I was very much amused at first, to
hear people gravely talking of "a mob of sheep," or "a mob of
<i>lambs</i>," and it was some time ere I became accustomed to the
novel use of the word. Now, the common announcements that "the
cuckoo hen has brought out a rare mob of chickens," or that
"there's a great mob of quail in the big paddock," are to me
fraught with no alarming anticipations.</p>

<p>December being, with us, midsummer as well as Christmas, brought
with its warm sunny weather the summer tasks of sheep-washing and
shearing. The former part of the business was easily and
efficiently performed in a bright running pool in the Swan River;
and as we had as yet no suitable buildings erected for the latter,
a temporary boarded floor was laid in a stable, around which the
sheeppens and yards were arranged with hurdles. This brought the
busy scene rather close to the house, but in our young
establishment we could not have all things fit at first, and I was
too well pleased with the progress already made to find room for
complaint. Master George was, of course, in a great state of
delight, and tumbled over hurdles, got knocked down by the sheep,
hugged the dogs, made friends with the good-natured shearers and
shepherds, and got in everybody's way with impunity, as long as
the, to <i>him</i>, charming disturbance lasted.</p>

<p>The lambs of our flock were all shorn at the same time as the
old sheep, a far more humane method than that usually practised
here; most persons choosing to leave the lambs' fleeces to grow a
month or two longer, so as to obtain a larger "clip," thus
stripping the poor animals of their warm natural clothing just as
the cold autumnal and wintry weather approaches; and, although
great numbers of lambs perish miserably in consequence, the cruel
and short-sighted custom is still obstinately adhered to by many,
to whom interest. if not humanity, might teach a wiser course. We
had the satisfaction of seeing our fat frisky lambs with good warm
winter coats on again by the time they needed them, and their
healthy lusty condition was an ample compensation for the temporary
sacrifice of a few pounds of wool.</p>

<p>Sheep-shearing ended on the 11th of January, and harvest began
on the 26th of the same month. Heavy and luxuriant were the crops
our new land yielded us, and most pleasant it was to see wide
fields of golden grain waving in the sunshine, and rows of sturdy
reapers busily plying their gleaming sickles, where, only the year
before, we had with difficulty threaded our tortuous way through
scrub and forest.</p>

<p>And pleasant, too, was it to see the goodly stackyard fast
filling with the plenteous store, hard by the little spot where our
first modest wheat-rick had gladdened our grateful hearts. Now,
instead of one small one, five large portly stacks stood in brave
array, and the erection of a capacious barn and straw-yard gave the
finishing touch to that portion of our farm arrangements.</p>

<p>The extra "hands" engaged for the harvest each received a dollar
(4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>.) a day, with the same unlimited allowance as
our own servants, of meat, flour, vegetables, tea, and sugar, and a
bottle of wine a day each. To each of our own men, Mr. Meredith
gave 2 after harvest, as a reward and encouragement for good
behaviour and diligence. These were prisoners, not better than the
average; but they were industrious, well-conducted men, who, though
under strict discipline, needed not a day's punishment whilst in
our service*.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Wages were at that time high, good ploughmen
and farm-servants receiving from 35<i>l</i>. to 40<i>l</i>. a-year,
with rations, &amp;.; but as wheat was then worth 10<i>s</i>. a
bushel, and wool 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a pound, the farmer's
prospects were far better than since (1847-8-9), with wages from
10<i>l</i>. to 15<i>l</i>., wheat 3<i>s</i>., and wool
10<i>d</i>.]</p>

<p>Numbers of the beautiful bronze-winged pigeons frequented our
corn-fields and stubble, affording Mr. Meredith a little shooting,
in which murderous diversion I must not deny being an accomplice,
for, by walking up the lands of the field, I put up the birds,
whilst he shot them as they flew over towards the scrub. They are
considerably larger than the common tame pigeon, and their plumage
is a soft purplish dove-colour, with a reddish glow upon the
breast, and the resplendent prismatic hues on the wings from which
they are named. In some the preponderating gleam is green, and in
others red, but always bright and lustrous, like a peacock's back,
or a pearly shell in the sunshine. They have pretty pink feet and
ruby-ringed eyes. I have often thought of trying to domesticate
some, by rearing them with my tame pigeons; their rich, plumage and
handsome shape would be very ornamental. A friend of ours had one
so tame that it flew about his house, sat on his shoulder, and,
when he went from home, would accompany him for a considerable
distance, and then fly back again. The poor bird was at last
accidentally destroyed, to its master's great regret.</p>

<p>When cooked, the bronze-winged pigeon is excellent, being plump,
tender, and well-flavoured, very nearly the size of a good
partridge, and here, where those birds are not to be had, is our
best substitute for them. The meat on the breast is of two distinct
colours, white and brown, in two separate layers.</p>

<p>A few quail bred among the corn, but they are always scanty in
number; the native vermin, as well as hawks and snakes, and cats of
the domestic breed, become wild, are all terribly destructive to
them.</p>

<p>Before the marshes were drained, snipe were often plentiful in
them, but are now very rare.</p>

<p>Our dogs often found a bird commonly known here as a native hen,
and chased it out of the scrubs or long grass; but unless a gun
came to their aid, they did not often succeed in catching one, for
the bird is exceedingly swift afoot. It is something like a common
fowl in shape and size, of a dusky copper-tinged colour, with long
powerful legs, and dark, generally tough flesh. It is eaten and
relished by some persons when skinned and nicely stewed, but
requires good cooking to render it palatable. The noise the native
hens make at night exactly resembles that made in setting a
saw!</p>

<p>One evening Mr. Meredith was looking for wild ducks beside the
river, when a rustling flight from the tall sedges near induced him
to fire, and he shot a fine bittern, much to our regret, for we had
long known by the strange "boom," heard at night, that we had one
for a neighbour, and would not willingly have had it destroyed. Its
long fringed neck and crest, and tall slender legs, reminded me of
the heron, and, for old acquaintance' sake, I should have rejoiced
in having it about us alive. Its plumage is a sober brown, with
markings and shades of darker and lighter hues, altogether much
more grave and ancient-looking than the bright array of the blue
cranes.</p>

<p>All kinds of wild things used to be brought to me by our
servants, for pets, until the very unlooked-for ways in which I
disposed of most of them had the desired effect of damping their
well-meant ardour in making captures. One man brought me a hatful
of beautiful young quail, which he found among the corn, and I felt
very much tempted to try to rear them; but knowing that such
experiments usually ended fatally for the poor little birds, I
contented myself with looking at the lovely, tiny, little helpless
things, and had them straightway carried carefully back to the
place whence they were taken, so that the old birds might find them
again, and, as the young brood was well-grown, fledged, and active,
I am fain to hope they did.</p>

<p>Another man brought me a nest of wild ducks, which, by the time
he had drank the tumbler of wine I gave him, I had determined to
dispose of exactly as I did the quail. A third caught for me a pair
of robins, but my love for the bright little birds is much too
great to permit me to imprison them, or indeed any others. Birds in
cages are to me most distressing and melancholy objects; I never
keep pets that must be so utterly deprived of their freedom; for my
pleasure in possessing them would be outweighed tenfold by the
sight and knowledge of their unhappiness.</p>

<p>One family of birds may invariably be found in this island
wherever there is grain for them to steal, and these are the
handsome, merry, impudent, wicked, rainbow-plumag'd, thieving
parrots. The common kind, attired in shaded green, with a yellowish
breast, and a few blue feathers in the wings and tail, is the most
daring and incorrigible. These beset the stack-yard in legions,
literally covering some of the ricks, and terrible is the havoc
they commit, clawing off the thatch and scooping caverns beneath,
into which they retreat when attacked, and peep out in the most
provoking way imaginable, crying continually
"cushee&mdash;cashee&mdash;cushee!"&mdash;and, when assailed by volleys of sticks
or stones, will often only bob down their round saucy heads, or hop
aside to avoid a blow, and go on coolly pecking the ears of corn
they hold in their claws, as if the assault were a most unprovoked
and unwarrantable one.</p>

<p>They are not deemed worth powder and shot, but may be knocked
down with sticks, and when skinned are tolerably good in pies.</p>

<p>All our parrots here have long tails, and are what I should in
England have called parroquets. The stuffed specimens in museums,
and in Gould's magnificent work on Australian birds, have probably
made the chief of them familiar to my readers. The Rose-hill, or
Rosella parrot, is the gayest of the family indigenous to Tasmania;
the brightest and most positive colours are distributed over its
brilliant attire with such startling contrasts as would be
unpleasantly gaudy in anything but a bird. Only imagine a lady
dressed in a scarlet turban, green shawl, scarlet and yellow
stomacher, green dress (a different shade to the shawl), and long
purple train, edged with sky-blue! Yet all these clear and distinct
colours are united in this bird's radiant plumage. A group of them
daintily pacing about in the sunny garden, climbing among the
plants, picking flower-seeds, and performing all the elegant,
affected, coquettish antics which only parrots can do, is a sight
that well repays me for the loss of many a half-hour which I cannot
but waste in watching them.</p>

<p>They are very easily tamed to follow their master about the
house, or sit on his hand; but they cannot be taught to speak or
sing so well as the larger kinds of parrots: I have never heard any
here which are comparable, in point of accomplishments, to the
large gray and green parrots I used to know in England.</p>

<p>The most exquisite of all the Tasmanian species is the little
green parakeet, which is not much larger than a fat sparrow. Its
plumage is of two colours only, green and red, but the green is a
living emerald, and the red is like that of moist coral; it is
sparingly displayed about the head and tail. A flock of these
radiant little creatures skimming past&mdash;for they fly very swiftly,
and are much more shy than the larger species&mdash;can scarcely be
exceeded in beauty by the gorgeous lories of New South Wales. They
appear to live on the honey of flowers, chiefly gum-blossoms, and
are very short-lived in captivity, none, that I have heard of,
surviving more than a year.</p>

<p>The ground parakeet is a singular species, never being seen to
perch on a tree, but always alighting on the ground. Its colour is
clear bright green, barred and spotted with black; it is described
to me as very beautiful, but it is so rare that I have not yet seen
it.</p>

<p>I had feared that we should suffer much alarm and annoyance from
snakes at Spring Vale, judging from the numbers destroyed there
during the first year of its occupation as a farm; but, with the
exception of one found in the stable litter, and two killed in the
cellar at different times, we saw none very near the house; and the
number destroyed by the men on the farm was not a quarter so large
as during the previous year.</p>

<p>A very thick black snake was brought home one day, and, on being
opened, was found to contain a nearly full-grown kangaroo-rat,
quite entire, all but the head, which was already digested; the
snake was not quite four feet long, and the kangaroo-rat measured
ten inches in length, with proportionate girth.</p>

<p>Several well-authenticated instances have been related to me of
snakes being killed, which had half-swallowed other snakes very
little smaller than themselves, the lower portions of which were in
process of digestion in the devourer's stomach, whilst the yet
unswallowed half hung out of its mouth. One of these was discovered
by a boy treading on it, when, to his horror, the reptile instantly
coiled itself round his leg, but without biting him, and, on a
person coming to his aid, it was found that the snake's mouth was
fully occupied and distended by the body of another snake.</p>

<p>The extreme coolness with which some persons will attack snakes
is, to me, perfectly terrible. One of our men-servants had a
peculiar talent in this way, and would, after peeping into a
snake's hole, thrust in his bare hand and arm, deliberately draw
out the deadly inmate, by the tail, and, holding it up for a few
seconds, swing it round, and dash its head to pieces against a tree
or log, with as much <i>sang froid</i> as any one else would crack
a whip!</p>

<p>It is said that when a snake is held up by the tail, and gently
swung round and round, it cannot turn up its head so far as to bite
the hand. I can hardly imagine any one trying the experiment.</p>

<p>Considerable interest has been excited here lately by the
wonderful performances of a prisoner named Underwood, who professes
to have the power of "charming" any kind of snake, so as to render
it gentle and innoxious; and he has exhibited his extraordinary
faculty before the Lieutenant-Governor, the Bishop of Tasmania,
several medical men, and many others of the most intelligent
persons in the colony, all of whom bear testimony to his evident
power over the reptiles. He handles the most venomous snakes with
impunity, tying them in knots, or putting them in his bosom, and
suffering them to make their way down over his body, taking them up
from the leg of his trousers. All such feats, however, are merely
surprising; but he also declares that he possesses an effective
antidote for the bites of all venomous reptiles; it consists of a
liquid, a drop or two of which is to be immediately applied to the
wound. I believe that its efficacy has been tolerably well tested,
and Underwood has obtained permission from the Government to
compound and sell his antidote for his own advantage. He says he
learned the secret of its composition when at Callao, and would
disclose it if his pardon were granted to him in return. Should the
remedy prove really as valuable as at present represented, the
inestimable benefit it confers on all dwellers in these and other
snake-infested countries does indeed demand a most generous
reward.</p>

<p>Many years ago Mr. John Amos, one of the oldest settlers in Swan
Port, whilst ploughing, with his feet bare, accidentally trod upon
a large black snake, close to its head: with admirable and
surprising presence of mind, knowing it could not hurt him while in
that position, he let go of the plough, and stood fast, whilst the
reptile twined itself tightly round his leg and struggled to get
away; but he held on stoutly until a knife could be brought to cut
off the snake's head, and free him from a situation which very few
would have nerve enough to endure, notwithstanding the prudence of
doing so.</p>

<p>Differences of taste are proverbially great, but perhaps in few
instances more strikingly shown than in the choice of tame pets,
some persons patronizing hens, some mice, and some monkeys, and it
seems even snakes have their patrons, for Mr. Meredith was once
absolutely horror-stricken at seeing an old servant exhibit to him
a tame snake, which he kept in an old tea-kettle; and, when
desirous of enjoying its company, would take off the lid, put his
hand in, and pull out his strange friend as unconcernedly as a boy
would fetch out a tame guinea-pig! The precaution of a cork was
adopted, to prevent the possibility of the reptile's absconding by
going up the spout.</p>

<p>The black snake seems unable to give many mortal bites in quick
succession, the venom, as it would appear, becoming exhausted. Some
years since a large snake was seen to bite three dogs, one after
the other, as they attacked it in turn. The dog first bitten died
almost immediately; the second in about two hours; and the third,
after being very ill for some time, eventually recovered.</p>

<p>I am not aware how many kinds of snakes infest Van Diemen's
Land. Most of those killed come under the two denominations of
"black" and "diamond" snakes, but I have observed varieties in the
shades and marking of their skins, which probably constitute
several distinct species; both these are sometimes found five feet
in length, but more commonly three-and-a-half, and four feet. A
smaller kind of snake, of a green colour, is also known, but is
less common.</p>

<p>In examining the heads of snakes, the venomous fangs are
distinctly visible, two or three being placed together on each side
of the upper jaw; and, in a newly-killed snake, they can be raised
or depressed with a pin or needle, the bag of venom at their base
being also seen. The teeth, when examined with a microscope, appear
transparent, with a tube traversing nearly their whole length, and
opening on the side, leaving one-fifth of the tooth like a solid
point, which pierces the thing bitten, whilst the venom-bag,
squeezed by the pressure of the tooth, ejects the poison through
the tube into the wound. The mechanism of this terrible weapon of
destruction very much resembles that of the spines of the
stinging-nettle.</p>

<p>The length of the venomous fangs in the head of a snake which
Mr. Meredith destroyed a few days since was about the sixth of an
inch. We were walking over a wooded rocky point above the
sea-beach: I had lingered a moment behind, gathering flowers, and
was hastening on again, when a very large diamond snake darted
almost from beneath my feet; when struck with a stick, and severely
hurt, it turned fiercely upon us, with its hideous head flattened
out, and its throat distended, looking as nothing but a snake can
look; unable to reach us, it seized its own body in its teeth, and
held it tenaciously for some seconds; then, suddenly loosing,
fastened on another part, and bit again in a most savage and
determined manner.</p>

<p>Several kinds of little harmless lizards are found here, similar
to those in New South Wales; one of them frequented our dining-room
at Riversdale, often amusing me, when I have been sitting alone and
silent, by its swift movements, and adroit capture of flies on the
floor and wainscot, into a crevice of which it disappeared when
alarmed.</p>

<p>Another description of lizard is here vulgarly called the
"blood-sucker," and is supposed to be venomous, but I think this is
probably an error, the extreme ugliness of the unlucky little
reptile being, with most persons, deemed ample evidence against it.
Its body is dark gray, marked with black above and white beneath;
in shape it is broad and squat, rather toad-like in aspect; both
the body and the long tail are rendered somewhat formidable by
longitudinal rows of larger scales than the rest, set up like
spines. The head of one species of blood-sucker is hooded, of the
other, bare, but both are very ugly. They are six or eight inches
long.</p>

<p>Some of our spiders form most ingenious nests of gum-leaves,
webbed together at the edges. I annex a sketch*, which I made long
ago, from a very pretty nest formed of five green leaves, perfectly
closed up at both ends. After I had had it some days, a flock of
tiny spiders came out and ran about. I have often, since then, seen
what appeared, at a first glance, to be a spider's web scattered
full of coarse pepper, hanging to the threads, but the slightest
touch transformed the grains each to an active little spider. The
two other clever nests, each formed of a single gumleaf (see
immediately below), were also the habitations of spiders. Ground
spiders are likewise very numerous, with beautifully-formed cells,
in the earth, but they are less often seen with doors to their
houses than those of New South Wales.</p>

<p>Next to my perpetual horror of snakes, I may rank among minor
colonial troubles the annoyance suffered from the various
depredators amongst our poultry. Hens which would not sit in the
fowl-house, but chose to select their own nests in the Bush, were
frequently taken by native cats, and most often just as the young
brood was hatched. A trap, baited with some meat of rather high
scent, was sometimes successful in catching the delinquent, but as
often failed. Hens with young broods under coops were in great
danger at night, even though I always took the precaution of
placing them close to the house. We well knew, by their cries, when
cats were near them, and many a midnight sally to the rescue took
place in consequence. One poor partlet was attacked thrice in the
same night; and, being unable to see and shoot the enemy, Mr.
Meredith left a lighted lantern in front of her domicile, to
prevent further molestation; but in the morning we found she had
been so much hurt, that it was necessary to kill her. The thin,
wiry, native cat had, apparently, squeezed itself in and out
through the bars of the coop.</p>

<p>Cats of the common domestic breed are now wild in the colony in
considerable numbers, and are fully as destructive among poultry as
the native vermin. One, which had been reared on the farm a demure
and respectable kitten, and had taken to disorderly and predatory
habits in her mature age, committed sad havoc among my half-grown
chickens and sitting hens, and for a time eluded all our vigilance.
One evening Mrs. Puss was detected stealing crouchingly along under
the shadow of a fence, when a shot from a gun, so often vainly
devoted to her service, in a moment cut short her hopes of
"chicken-fixings."</p>

<p>The hawks, as a matter of course, rank prominently among my
poultry-perils, and I truly grieve that they are so terribly
mischievous, for their noble stately beauty almost disarms one's
enmity; and, shameless freebooters and tyrants as they are, I
cannot help sorrowing for every one that I see killed.</p>

<p>The common brown hawk of this island is a noble and powerful
bird and, when perched, stands sixteen or seventeen inches high,
with an immense span of wing. The plumage of the back and tail is
rich hazel-brown, barred with a darker shade, and that of the
breast a soft pale tint of gray, warming into fawn-colour, also
barred across with deeper hues: very grave, but exceedingly
beautiful; a chaste, quiet, tasteful dress, well suiting a bird of
his ancient and aristocratic race.</p>

<p>"Old times are changed" for the glorious-eyed bird; in these
railroad days, and this matter-of-fact colony, the once favoured of
courts, and the caressed of rank and beauty, is simply regarded as
an arrant thief and most impudent marauder. Very many were killed
at Spring Vale. During one of our morning rambles round the fields,
Mr. Meredith shot four; the first was one of a pair, which rose
from a dead bandicoot, or other like delicacy on the ground, as we
passed. After shooting another at some distance farther on, two
more appeared, high overhead, approaching the place, and Mr.
Meredith, having reloaded his gun, flung the dead bird high in the
air, when instantly the two stooped towards it, and the two
barrels, fired in quick succession, killed them both.</p>

<p>The boldness of hawks in pursuit of their prey is well known,
and I have seen them follow our fowls or tame pigeons so close to
the house, that, as the frightened creatures darted within for
protection, the hawk's wings nearly brushed the door.</p>

<p>The crows, too, were most audacious in their forays for eggs and
chickens; the former species of theft I might perhaps have been
tempted to overlook, by my admiration for their beautiful sable
plumage, and their identity of kind with their English brethren;
for, to resemble anything which speaks to me of <i>Home</i>, is a
royal road to my favour. But after procuring, with some pains and
trouble, a set of white turkey-eggs, and after all the cares and
anxieties inseparable from the duties of poultry-rearing&mdash;after
seeing my eight interesting little chickens thriving well, and
beginning to chase ants and grasshoppers on their own
account&mdash;after all this, could human patience (<i>feminine</i>)
endure to see one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four successively pounced upon, and
carried squeaking away by the same grave, solemn-looking culprit?
So the gentleman in black was one day ignominiously shot, in the
act of chasing a young chicken into a wattle-bush, and his body
formally nailed to a tree, near which I usually placed my young
broods, as a rather pointed moral lecture to his surviving
relatives on the fatal consequences of such evil courses.</p>

<p>A very amusing and pretty bird, here called the miner, often
assisted us in detecting the hawk, when the latter had taken refuge
in a tree out of sight. These miners, or minors (for the etymology
of the name has often puzzled me), are nearly the size of a
blackbird; their plumage is a delicate French gray, with darker
shades on the wings and tail, and a little black cap, and touches
of yellow about the head; and their general air and expression are
extremely piquant and saucy. They are evidently great gossips,
perpetually hunting out and interfering with every bird in the
neighbourhood; and a whole troop may frequently be seen chasing a
marauding hawk or egg-stealing crow, flying all round in the
busiest manner, and uttering their quick, sharp, distinct cry of
"Thief! thief! thief!" Their own morals being none of the purest,
we might expect them to be chary of abuse; but, apparently, their
individual experiences in theft only render them the more alert in
detecting the peccadilloes of their brethren, and we have often
traced out our poultry foes through their agency.</p>

<p>Their depredations in orchards are really serious, and their
impudence is so imperturbable, that nothing short of mortal
wounding will scare them from their stolen banquet. A fine bearing
cherry-tree, one of our richest prizes from the Cambria orchard,
was planted close to one end of the veranda, in the belief that
there the fruit would be safe, as persons were constantly passing
to and fro; but our busy friends took up their daily abode in it as
soon as the cherries began to ripen, and continued to partake of
our store, in the proportion of the lion's share, as long as any
remained. Yet was it well worth the loss of a few cherries to
witness the impudent <i>nonchalance</i> of these miners&mdash;how they
would hop and creep about the branches, and, instead of flying off
when pelted with gravel or shouted at, would pop out their
bright-eyed saucy heads from amidst the clustering leaves, and cry
"thief! thief!" as loudly as ever, straightway making a fresh
onslaught on the fruit with such honest-looking confident
assurance, that I almost began to doubt whether they or we were the
rightful proprietors of it.</p>

<p>A rather suspicious circumstance occurred one day, not
reflecting much credit on the miner as a kind or charitable
neighbour. Mr. Meredith, in shooting at a wattle-bird in the top of
a high tree, only winged it, and, as it fluttered down, it alighted
in a bush, whither he watched it whilst reloading his gun, and then
ran to the spot, where he found the wounded wattle-bird fluttering
and struggling in the claw of a miner, which would not loose its
hold until struck and driven away.</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of the great comet of this year (1843),
which we first saw on the 5th of March*, was a glorious incident in
our somewhat monotonous life here; which, with its ever-recurring
digging, clearing, and "grubbing," ploughing, sowing, and reaping,
perhaps does tend to make our thoughts savour "of the earth.
earthy;" but this stupendous visitant gave them, for a time, a
loftier impetus.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Ebook editor's note: "The Great Comet of
1843, formally designated C/1843 D1 and 1843 I, was a long-period
comet which became very bright in March 1843 (it is also known as
the Great March Comet). It was discovered on February 5, 1843 and
rapidly brightened to become a great comet.&mdash;<a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Comet_of_1843" target=
"_blank">Wikipedia</a>"]</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith determined to measure the apparent length the comet
subtended on the sky, although we did not possess a single fit
instrument for such a purpose. But not even Sir James South, or her
Majesty's Astronomer Royal, ever set about an investigation with
more zeal and high resolve! Firstly, there was made, with all
possible accuracy, a "cross-staff" and plummet, and thus we
proceeded to work:&mdash;At night, and when the comet was brightest,
with the nucleus just above the mountain tier, we "set up our
instruments" (i.e., laid them on a chair), on the lawn. My office
was that of worthy Master George Seacoal, "to bear the lantern,"
carefully darkened until required. When my better and cleverer half
had fairly shot the nucleus, at which he took deliberate and deadly
aim with the cross-staff, I brought the lantern to bear on the
latter, and marked with a pencil where the thread of the plummet
fell; ascertaining the altitude of the extremity of the tail in
like learned and scientific manner: and then, after taking the
respective bearings by the compass, also aided by the lantern, and
repeating the whole ceremony twice or thrice, to test the accuracy
of the results, our astronomical observations ended for the night.
If not very grave or dignified, the style of the proceeding was
infinitely diverting; and, as it eventually proved, some of the
greater lights among the learned here were less correct than we and
our lantern, for, after the comet's length had been calculated, and
published in the colonial papers, to our no small mystification, as
23 only, it was finally declared to be 42, the same result as
that we had arrived at in our primitive method of measurement,
which was, of course, highly gratifying and satisfactory.</p>

<p>The popular responsibilities of comets in general are known to
be heavy and various, and this being a comet of such vast and
startling dimensions, had naturally a great deal to answer for,
with some of the simple good people around us. If the sun shone
pleasantly out, the comet was bringing "terrible hot weather;"&mdash;if
a shower of rain fell, the comet brought that too, and would most
probably favour us with a flood;&mdash;if the hens ceased laying, the
comet had frightened them;&mdash;if an apple-tree died, the comet had
blighted it;&mdash;and, whatever domestic accident occurred, whether a
baby cut a tooth, or its mother spoiled a batch of bread, it was
"all along of that comet!"</p>

<p>To us its rapid progress was a source of great interest; night
after night we traced it, changing its direction, and traversing
one constellation after another, waning in brightness as it
receded, until first a doubt arose whether we <i>could</i> discern
it, and then came the reluctantly-acknowledged certainty that we
could <i>not</i>. We felt as if some friend and companion, who had
for a while spoken to us, with stirring eloquence, of the glory of
Nature, and of Nature's God, had departed from beside us.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith had long projected an excursion to show me the
river Apsley and the eastern coast north of Oyster Bay, about
thirty miles distant from Spring Vale; and this year, after
harvest, we arranged our little plan, which involved the necessity
for an absence from home of two nights. I fabricated for myself a
nondescript kind of valise or knapsack, to hang over the pommel of
the saddle and fasten with the girths, which contained, in
marvellously small space, the essentials for a travelling toilette,
besides a pocket telescope and sketch-book; and, mounted on the
gentle and beautiful Arab dedicated in her old age to my especial
service, I set forth with Mr. Meredith, on a fine autumn afternoon
early in March, to cross the tier, and remain the night at the
house of a settler eight miles on our way, so as to enable us to
reach the coast and return thither the following day.</p>

<p>On the verge of our own land we passed the cottage and busy
blazing forge of our tenant the blacksmith, whose forty acres had
yielded him a good return; and a bonny wheat-stack, a well-filled
garden, and oxen, poultry, and pigs in plenty, made a pleasant show
of homely comforts all about it. Beyond this, the road entered on
the property of the Amos family, who deserve honourable mention at
the hands of any chronicler of this island, as being among the best
farmers it contains. I know not any spot here which so vividly
recalls to my mind the scenery and character of an English village,
as the group of homesteads and the surrounding cultivated land
occupied by different members of this family. The substantial
buildings include several good houses (now embosomed in Home-like
gardens), a large water-mill on the bank of the Swan River, barns,
and all other requisites; and the strong neat fences, in many
places lined with thick hedges of sweetbriar, the perfectly-cleared
and well-farmed land, and the air of abundance and comfort
pervading the whole, form a most striking contrast to the slovenly,
improvident style of farming prevalent in some other parts of the
colony.</p>

<p>Shortly after fording the river, we began to ascend the hills,
over which a very rough and stony track passes, certainly not
worthy to be called a road, as by all, save colonial travellers, it
would be pronounced totally impassable.</p>

<p>We gained a few very pretty peeps of wild mountain scenery,
wherever the dense forests around afforded an open vista;
particularly a foreshortened view of the Schoutens, which was very
beautiful, with a foreground of densely-wooded hills and ravines
glowing in the full-golden radiance of an afternoon sun. In due
time we crossed a "saddle" of the tier, and began to descend again,
traversing some very wild and picturesque glens and gullies, where
the "Oyster-Bay pine" flourishes in great luxuriance. This species
of tree is only known within a well-defined boundary, of about
forty miles from north to south in this particular district; it is
not found either northward of the Apsley River, or south of Oyster
Bay, or in any other explored part of the island. It is a very
handsome tree, not so densely verdant as the "scrub" or "bushy
pine" before described, but much more lofty and picturesque, and so
perfectly straight and taper, that the larger trees resemble the
entire mast of a vessel, from deck to sky-sail. The lower branches
curve downwards, and turn up again, with a most graceful bend; the
cones are small each consisting of four or five hard scales, and a
few small ones between them; they grow in clusters, sitting close
to the branches, and their polished dark brown shells are
beautifully conspicuous amongst the vivid green foliage.</p>

<p>Although known here universally as pines, yet I imagine that
both this tree and the "brushy pine" belong to the cypress family.
Some of the largest grow to the height of from 90 to 120 feet, but
the average size varies from 30 to 80 feet. They are found on the
most rocky hills and gullies, and, being useful for many purposes,
are much thinned in the more accessible regions. As I did not
penetrate beyond these, I have not seen the finest specimens, but
the common road-side groups of them are very beautiful. We
frequently sent men and teams into the tiers for pine spars to make
ladders, rafters, fence-rails, &amp;c., and, when sawn and well
laid, they make excellent floors.</p>

<p>Emerging from this region of woods and glens, we came out at the
head of Moulting Bay (so named in days of yore, when swans were
abundant), and reached the house which was our night's destination.
It commands a fine view of the ever-grand Schoutens, Great Swan
Port, two conspicuous eminences called "St. Peter" and "St. Paul"
(or more commonly "the two Peterses"), and various other hills and
inlets.</p>

<p>We set forth again early the following morning, and cantered
briskly along through thick woods of gum, pine, and wattle trees,
and then, climbing another rugged stony hill, came in view of an
extensive lagune, a drained flat of rich land, formerly a
fresh-water marsh or lake, but now chiefly under cultivation: the
owner of it has a good house-garden and farm buildings on the slope
of a hill commanding a fine view; also a large orchard, producing a
hundred or more hogsheads of cider annually.</p>

<p>The next pleasing object in our landscape was the river Apsley,
a deep, clear, beautiful river of fresh water, which, if it went on
its way like other orderly rivers, and rolled its waters onward to
the ocean, would be of the greatest advantage to the neighbouring
settlers in shipping their produce; but, after running for a
considerable distance of sufficient depth to float a frigate, it
suddenly makes a full stop, and finishes off abruptly in a low
flat, over which, when floods occur, the superabundant waters flow
into the bay, and the river itself is no more seen: the produce of
the adjacent farms has thus to be conveyed some miles overland to
the east coast.</p>

<p>The striking change in the outline of the hills as we advanced,
gave quite a different character to the scenery here; instead of
widely-spread sloping hills, fine wooded ridges of most picturesque
form, and with almost precipitous sides, bounded the prospect in
every direction. Many bright flowers enlivened the Bush, among
which the most conspicuous were, the large crimson epacris and a
small snow-white-blossomed "tea-tree" (<i>Leptospermum
&mdash;&mdash;?</i>)</p>

<p>We soon reached my father's sheep station on the Apsley, where
the overseer in charge had a considerable quantity of land cleared,
neatly fenced, and under cultivation. His barn-yard displayed some
comely stacks of wheat, the produce of the recent harvest; and his
cottage, garden, goats, pigs, poultry, and a swarm of sturdy,
healthy, shouting children, made a pleasant busy scene to greet us
after our quiet ride through the silent, wild, primeval
forests.</p>

<p>Being anxious to achieve our chief purpose of reaching the sea
in good time, we declined for the present the hospitable offers of
the overseer's wife, but promised to call on our return; and, again
plunging into the forest, journeyed on as usual along a bush road,
which after some distance quitted the dark "trap" rock we had
hitherto travelled over from Spring Vale, and entered upon a range
of granite hills, comparatively low in some parts, but rising in
others to a considerable elevation. From the last of these we
gained a view of the magnificent Pacific, which truly then deserved
its name! It was pure intense blue, even to the beach, where the
little waves rippled on fine sand, white as driven snow. This
beautiful beach extended for a distance of many miles along the
coast, only interrupted by crags and huge heaped-up masses of
granite, sparkling like gems in the sunshine, as the transparent
blue waves broke in endless dazzling succession, and the feathery
spray flew high over the rocks.</p>

<p>Long high headlands stretched away to the north, in the vicinity
of the river Douglas and St. Patrick's Head, and a bright bare
granite island, called Diamond Isle, lay almost close in-shore. The
creeping plant called here the "Macquarie Harbour Vine," spread its
long chaplets of broad verdant leaves in a thick net-work over the
high sand-bank above the beach, together with the common
Mesembryanthemum (known here as "pigs' faces") and a few low green
shrubs, vividly contrasting with the more sombre tints of the lofty
mountains behind, all thickly clothed with wood, except where some
grotesquely-shaped granite mass protruded in the form of an ancient
tower or rampart.</p>

<p>We dismounted and walked along one beach in the hope of finding
shells, but saw scarcely any; then rode over an intervening point
to another beach, when we left the horses tied to a shady tree, and
enjoyed a scramble amongst the rocks, which were very beautiful,
exhibiting great variety of colour and crystallization: in some of
the masses were cubes of red felspar nearly two inches square, with
equally large scales of mica; in some places the granite contained
schorl, and was covered with large black patches of that mineral. A
very minute red lichen clothes some of the rocks so completely as
to appear at first their natural colour, whilst numbers of the
bright deep little pools among the crags were gay with
many-coloured sea-weeds; vivid green, rose, crimson, purple, and
other less showy hues floating together, gay and changing as a
living kaleidoscope. Some of the Algae were new to me.</p>

<p>Remounting our horses, we rode on over another point, to another
beach, close to which a spring of pure fresh water rises in a green
grassy hollow, and here Mr. Meredith unsaddled and tethered the
horses to graze, whilst we sat under a scrubby old honeysuckle
tree, and comfortably discussed our own luncheon, in as lovely and
lonely a spot as can well be conceived. This important matter
satisfactorily disposed of, we again rode forwards and southwards
to "Wabb's Boat Harbour," where a granite island lying very near to
the main-land affords shelter to the narrow channel between them,
which is much frequented by the small vessels visiting this part of
the east coast to receive the corn, wool, and other produce of the
settlers*.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The recent discovery (1849) of a coal-field,
supposed to be of great extent, near this place, will no doubt
speedily effect a great change in the aspect of the neighbourhood,
especially if the promised Government tramroad be formed, for the
conveyance of the coal to Wabb's Harbour for shipment. A company
has been formed for working the coal, and operations are expected
to begin immediately.]</p>

<p>This little harbour of refuge being the only shelter in a
stretch of many miles of rocky coast, it is often occupied during
the winter as the station of a whaling establishment, although at
the period of our visit all was silent and deserted. Skeletons of
huts and skeletons of whales stood side by side, and with greasy
barrels in long and black array, and remains of putrid carcasses
steaming in the sunshine, formed one scene of dirt, desolation, and
disgust, contrasting powerfully with the clean bright crags,
snow-white beach, and the pure brilliant character of the
surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>As we looked over the rocks into the still deep water of the
little strait, great numbers of cray-fish were seen clawing about
amongst the floating kelp, rather provokingly, for we had no means
whatever of catching any, and they are particularly nice, although
I suppose they act in the capacity of sea-scavengers in this place,
their presence here in such quantities being, at the least,
suspicious. They resemble the lobster in flavour, size, and shape,
except that they are destitute of the large claws, and the
back-shell is very rough with sharp tubercles; their colour is a
dull dark red, which becomes the common lobster-red when boiled. A
string with a piece of raw meat, or even a bit of red rag, is a
sufficient decoy to bring the cray-fish to the surface, when they
must be seized with the hand and pulled out. They are plentiful in
many parts of the coast, where the water is deep and still, with a
rocky bottom.</p>

<p>Bidding a reluctant farewell to the blue Pacific, we turned
homewards, traversing a better road than we had done in coming, the
decomposed granite forming a fine white gravel path across the
hills.</p>

<p>On arriving again at the Overseer's cottage, we found the
unfailing mark of hospitality&mdash;a steaming tea-pot of gigantic
capacity, ready to give us welcome. The good wife had been busy
too, making that favourite bush dainty, a "fat cake," which was hot
and brown, and of a most savoury and unctuous smell, although
rather too rich for my inexperienced palate (its composition being
that of pie-crust, with abundance of dripping or "fat" kneaded into
it, and then being made about an inch and a half thick, it is baked
slowly in the frying-pan); but the nice bread and tea were very
acceptable, and we discussed those, and all matters connected with
the farm and the garden, and the large family of small clean sturdy
children, at the same time.</p>

<p>We reached our resting-place of the previous night about sunset,
and rode home the following morning, two nights' absence from our
little boy seeming to me a scarcely excusable act; and divers
visions of perils from nursery-fires, snakes, ponds, horses' heels,
and cows' horns, had begun to haunt me most reproachfully, when, as
we neared the gate, the joyous little voice came ringing forth to
greet us, praying for a ride before me on "old Dainty," which being
duly granted, our pleasant little excursion was happily ended.</p>

<p>Although our new garden had been planned, and many trees planted
in it, even before our removal from Riversdale, it was not neatly
and artistically finished until the June of the present year,
1843.</p>

<p>A great lightwood tree, very green and well-formed, grew at the
lower end, and a drain, through which a bright clear stream always
flowed, traversed one side; the banks were well planted with
raspberries, currants, stone-fruit trees, and nuts, whilst in nice
moist corners we cherished some weeping willow cuttings, and
encouraged a few groups of the elegant white-blossomed tea-tree to
grow up in kindly companionship with the strangers.</p>

<p>The valuable gifts we received from the paternal orchard at
Cambria included the finest kinds of grafted fruit trees of all
sorts, many of them bearing well, so that even before our garden
was finished it yielded us fruit, and at once assumed a pleasant
and promising aspect when made neat and trim: the walks, smoothly
laid, and sown with English grass-seeds, showed green and fresh,
and in fancy I saw the China-rose cuttings I had carefully planted
<i>vis--vis</i> beside them at intervals, grown up into verdant
and blooming arches and bowers. But my speculations on the future
glory of our garden were suddenly checked by a tremendous winter
flood, or rather two successive floods early in July, which caused
the rivers to overflow in new places, and drove a raging roaring
torrent directly through our neat, precise, and just-completed
garden.</p>

<p>Among minor losses and troubles, I do not remember one which
ever annoyed and grieved me so much as this. We had been so long
striving to achieve what we now saw ruthlessly destroyed, that my
eyes grew dim with positive tears, as I stood watching the
resistless stream come sweeping on, driving the stout paling fence
before it, bending down and uprooting tree after tree&mdash;plum, and
peach, and apple&mdash;and washing off whole beds of vegetables and
flowers. Finally, after surging heavily for some time against the
ponderous deadwood fence at the bottom of the garden, it burst the
massive barrier, which it flung open on either side like great
gates, and rushed uninterruptedly onwards to the Swan River. About
the middle of the flood, we saw the "seed-lift," which the man
sowing had left the day before in a wheat field nearly a mile
distant, come sailing along over the drowned flower-borders, till
it lodged in the boughs of a cherry tree; and this told very
plainly that the work of destruction was carried on to a still more
serious extent elsewhere. We afterwards found that eight or nine
acres of rich ploughed land had been washed away out of one field,
and three acres out of another, leaving the unploughed subsoil
smooth as a floor.</p>

<p>Two of our men-servants, with their wives and one child, lived
in a cottage about half a mile from us, on a little plot of land
which they cultivated for themselves, and on which, at the time Mr.
Meredith measured it for them, not a trace or vestige of flood or
"wreck" was visible, such indications being always accurately
observed in choosing a building-site; but during this terrible
inundation (the highest known here for nineteen years), the water
rapidly rose round them, leaving the cottage awhile as on an
island, until towards night, when it flowed over the floor, and,
all retreat to the higher ground being cut off, the men proceeded
to set up a kind of perch or rude platform in the nearest tree,
upon which they hoisted their few stores and clothes, and then
helped the terrified women and child up also, the woman who had no
child carrying her favourite cat with her for safety; and thus they
passed the dismal night, water rushing and roaring all below, and
the rain still pouring heavily down.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, our shepherd, in taking his last circuit to
see that the sheep were safe, hailed the two men from a distance,
as he saw them wading about, with the help of long poles, and
learned something of the state of affairs, although the noise of
the water prevented his comprehending much that they told him. Both
of the women had been my servants, one being the nurse who was so
much affected when "Bill" was "up a tree" in the former great
flood, and I was truly concerned to learn that she was now "up a
tree" herself; but no aid could be safely afforded them until day
dawned, and the waters fell, which they did during the night, so
that the poor, wet, cold creatures contrived to make the
ever-comforting "pot o' tea" before daylight, and soon after were
able to re-enter their soppy dwelling, which their dog had never
quitted, having made himself as comfortable as circumstances would
permit on the top of the bed-place.</p>

<p>After the flood had wholly subsided, and we could again walk
about, we found that the Swan River had risen between twenty and
thirty feet above its ordinary level, and that several spots which
we had formerly thought of as sites for our cottage had been
overflowed to a considerable depth, and heaps of wreck, huge
ponderous trees, and pieces of fencing, left on the banks at a
scarcely credible height above the usually placid river. My poor
garden was long ere it recovered from the devastation, and the
necessity of making another broad drain through it, and of laying
down a portion of the borders in a long grass-plot, to prevent
future floods from carrying away the soil, considerably affected my
favourite plan.</p>

<p>Not long after this watery desolation, we were visited by one of
the most furious gales of wind I ever remember, and as Mr. Meredith
had started for. Hobarton the day previous, and was then travelling
through the Bush, where, in such a tempest, trees are continually
falling, and huge limbs of others are rent off, and driven about
with terrific force, I felt no small degree of apprehension on his
account. So many reports of damage done around our own homestead
poured in upon me, that I resolved to sally forth and superintend
the preventive and remedial forces in person, though sorely
buffeted and breath-spent in the attempt.</p>

<p>The barn displayed a miserable appearance; the thatch, rent off
by yards, left nothing but bare rafters between our threshed corn
and the threatening skies; and the mischief, so far from abating,
was still making rapid progress. All the stacks were likewise
stripped "to windward," and partly ripped open; pig-sties, stable,
cowsheds, calf-pens, and all such buildings, perfectly neat in the
morning, exhibited now a most dishevelled and deplorable condition;
whilst fences blown down in all directions, laid the corn-fields
open to the forays of horses, sheep, and cattle. Many and ingenious
were the contrivances proposed and put in practice to arrest the
injuries on all sides, the gale raging with unwearied vigour and
intensity until nightfall, when it moderated a little, and relieved
my apprehensions lest the house itself might he unroofed.</p>

<p>When, from the state of the markets or other causes, it becomes
desirable to thresh corn out speedily, we young farmers, who have
not yet erected a threshing machine, are obliged to hire one of
those which are kept to go out to work in most districts (the
"char-women" of their species); those who employ such assistance
paying threepence or fourpence per bushel for all the grain
threshed, and furnishing twelve men and some or all of the four
horses required in the operation, which must be hard and weary work
for the poor animals; and I always rejoiced when the business was
over, and the deafening, clattering, factory-like din, and the
suffocating clouds of dust, subsided together, and the great
reeling rumbling machine rolled away from our peaceful home.</p>

<p>The month of November is the chief season for our Tasmanian wild
flowers, and consequently the pleasantest time of the year for a
ramble in the "Bush," and our many long wandering walks made me
acquainted with various new faces among the delicate and fragrant
denizens of our woods and meadows.</p>

<p>The notion that our flowers have no scent is as ridiculous as
the idea that our birds have no song; both assertions must have
been made by people too much prejudiced to admit the natural
impressions of their senses. Without enumerating the less
conspicuous blossoms of the colony, there is the wattle or acacia
tribe, contending species multitudinous, and <i>all</i> fragrant,
if English hawthorn or meadow-sweet be fragrant, both of which they
resemble in perfume, and are, like them, almost too strongly
scented to be pleasant for any length of time in a closed room,
although out of doors the rich odour is most delicious. All the
<i>Eucalyptus</i> family hear an abundance of bloom, in
constellated wreaths of starry flowers, sweet as the rich honey
which the labouring bees suck from the crystal stores that lie deep
within the fringe-bordered cups; and as you pass a tree full of
blossom, the fragrance it diffuses seems to hang around so
lusciously as to be almost palpable to taste as well as smell.</p>

<p>The <i>Epacrida</i> are here usually called heaths, although we
have not any true heaths in the island; all of them bear
honey-laden flowers of sweet scent, but not very powerful. The
lovely <i>Epacris pulchella</i> is well known in English
green-houses, and the crimson and white varieties are scarcely less
beautiful, growing as they do here in such lavish abundance.</p>

<p>A little purple flower, which is equally common, so vividly
recalls to my mind, both by its scent and colour, an Old-World
favourite, that I always know it as the native Lilac (<i>Tetratheca
juncea</i>). The flowers have four petals, partially closed, so as
often to give them a bell-shape; the stamens, united in a spire,
are black or nearly so; the flowers form pendulous clusters of six
or eight; the foliage is small and hard, and the slender stems are
from six to eighteen inches high. It grows in every part of the
colony with which I am acquainted, and flowers in November and
December: I have sometimes found specimens nearly white, and some
pink; hut the usual colour, and the universal scent of this lovely
little flower, are those of the lilac blossoms.</p>

<p>Another very fragrant flower is the common white lily,
<i>Diplarrhaena Moraea</i> which is as universal a guest here as
the daisy in England, but more especially occupying rocky gravelly
banks, where its great tussocks of long reedy leaves flourish all
the year round, and in the spring and summer are abundantly adorned
with the elegant white flowers. These are much of the Iris form,
the three larger petals snowy white, and the small inner ones
delicately tinted with yellow and lilac. Each lasts one day only,
but they appear in a long succession, emerging singly or in pairs
from the sheath, which terminates the long slender stalk, where the
little buds lie closely hidden, like shy young birds, till fully
fledged to flutter and dance in the breezy sunshine.</p>

<p>Our children always exult in the first bunch of lilies they can
find for me, and bring them home in great triumph. The lilies are
our true heralds of summer, and seem to me the most generous and
loveable of all our wild flowers.</p>

<p>The sadly prosaic, dull, matter-of-fact habits of mind, and
apathetic want of observation, which characterize so large a
proportion of colonial young people, are to me lamentable, and we
guard against such habits in our own children as we would against
the symptoms of some mortal distemper of the body, at the same time
offering perhaps the best antidote in the shape of our own opposite
habits and active interest in all things around us.</p>

<p>One day, very long since, whilst engaged in drawing one of our
commonest wild flowers, with the name of which I was then
unacquainted, I accidentally made a discovery, which seemed to
render my botanical immortalization inevitable, until, shortly
after, I found that my new wonder had been known, printed, and
published in England years before! The flower was the <i>Stylidium
(graminifolium?</i>), and whilst sketching it, I gently raised the
singular central column of one blossom with my pencil, in order to
examine its form more accurately, when, the instant it was touched,
it leaped over to the other side of the flower, as if I had
suddenly moved some hidden spring which previously confined it.
Greatly surprised and interested, I touched the colunms of all the
other blossoms, and all performed the same jump with greater or
less vigour; and, believing in my simplicity that what was so new
to me must be also new to every one else, I was prepared to receive
the honours due to my wonderful discovery, until a chance reference
to page 1480 of "Murray's Encyclopaedia of Geography," published in
1834, nipped all my vain aspirations in the bud.</p>

<p>The <i>Stylidium</i>, or, as we named it, the "Hair-trigger," is
common all over the colony; the flower stem springs from a low tuft
of grassy leaves, and grows from a foot to eighteen or twenty
inches high, the upper half of it being adorned with purplish pink
flowers, which succeed each other during several months in
summer.</p>

<p>Many very pretty orchidaceous flowers dwell amidst our woods and
wastes; among these the golden <i>Diuris</i> holds a conspicuous
place, with its singular long-petalled bright yellow flowers,
grotesquely marked with rich brown and, as they are viewed in
different positions, may he fancied to be dragons' heads, snakes,
or nondescript creatures with long horns and beards. <i>Diuris
umbellata</i> has darker amber blossoms, also clouded with patches
of brown.</p>

<p>Some of the Thaladenias are yet more fantastic; one, viewed in
front, always reminds me of the picture of an ancient court jester,
with a tall conical cap, gay crimson doublet, and long
party-coloured legs; but I never could persuade any one else to see
more than the likeness of a spider in this odd little flower. Other
species of Thaladenia are pale lavender colour, pink, &amp;c. One
small kind, very delicate in form, and daintily shaded pink and
white, has an unpleasant odour very similar to that of mutton-bird
feathers.</p>

<p>I have often found the curious little <i>Neottia Australis</i>,
The stem is ten or fifteen inches high, with one or two small
leaves at the base, and a multitude of little bell-shaped flowers
without foot-stalks, circling closely round and round the twisted
stem, corkscrew-wise, to the top; each flower being partially
sheathed in a curving green leaf or bract; the tiny bells are
bright pink outside, and white within, with a pleasant but slight
odour, like new hay. In the same meadow where this little beauty
dwelt, I have also found an eccentric relative of an old Home
friend, namely, the forked-leaved sun-dew of Australia (<i>Drosra
binata?</i>).</p>

<p>Every one knows the common English species of the sun-dew, with
its rosette of round leaves sitting close to the soil, and
sparkling like a cluster of little rubies, as the light glistens on
its dew-tipped crimson fringe; but its Tasmanian cousin is totally
the reverse of this compact character. The plants I have gathered
have usually six or more leaf stalks springing from the root, of
from two to six inches long, the leaf seeming merely a continuation
of the stalk, divided into two thin portions, forming a fork of one
or more inches in length, and the whole greatly resembling in shape
an old bent pitchfork with a crooked handle, for the leaf stems
have always some twist or bend in them. The forked leaf is richly
adorned with the fringe of crimson threads and sparkling dew-jewels
peculiar to this curious family of plants; the young leaves first
appear like closely-curled tendrils; the flower is white, very
similar to that of the English sun-dew. In the bright pools of the
Cygnet River I have seen the plant growing much more luxuriantly
than on land, the flower-stalk being a foot and a half high, and
the leaf fork three inches long.</p>

<p>On the banks of these same bright pools, too, dwells the
loveliest of all the Tasmanian flowering shrubs, the <i>Banera
rubiaefolia</i>, more commonly known as the native rose. Its dear
green foliage is nicely disposed in starry circles round the
slender waving stems, and the exquisitely-delicate flowers which
appear among them are something like a wild rose or apple-blossom
in form, but are smaller and far more airy and slender in
character; whilst the closed, round, red buds are the prettiest
little coy green-hooded fairies imaginable. The flowers are a soft
rosy pink, passing into white towards the centre of each petal and
the anthers are golden yellow. After gathering a few sprays of the
native rose, I always glance around, and rarely in vain, to find a
Tea-tree, and straightway pillage its snow-laden pyramids of some
dainty little branches, which form a lovely contrast, in their
chaste lily-like purity, with the blushing little rose.</p>

<p>The tea-tree (<i>Leptospermum</i>) blossoms may be somewhat
likened to those of hawthorn, in their individual form, although
longer; but, instead of being grouped in detached clusters, they
form tall continuous pinnacles of flowers, most graceful in form
and motion, and charmingly enhanced by the rich myrtle-like foliage
and the scarlet-brown tints of the sepals, shown between the bases
of the white petals.</p>

<p>Grouped with these is often seen another handsome shrubs which I
used to call a Yellow Metrosideros, but is, I believe, the Crested
Calistemon; its great bottle-brush flowers of pale yellow, and its
long sharp-pointed leaves, show well beside the more delicate
proportions and tints of its gentle neighbours.</p>

<p>The steep rocky banks of the rivers, as they recede among the
mountains, produce many beautiful shrubs, which are wholly absent
from the more level parts of the country. Our pretty Cygnet River
often afforded me a treat in the discovery of some new flower. One,
which we especially admired, was a species of <i>Hovea</i>, a long,
scanty, scrambling kind of shrub, with a very large proportion of
stem, and only the terminal sprays adorned with much foliage, the
leaves being small, oval, and of the darkest green, with a rusty
down on the under side; but the clusters of small papilionaceous
flowers were of the loveliest pale lilac or French gray colour,
with an eye of deep violet, whence slender veins of the same hue
went wandering over the whole flower. We were at great pains to
remove some of these plants, but they grew in such wild, craggy
places, and with their strong iron-wiry roots so knotted round and
amongst the rocks, with no apparent soil near them, that the task
was a somewhat tough one; and of the four we succeeded in
detaching, only one, planted in a hole in the rocky bank by our
cottage, survived the removal.</p>

<p>Many of these mountain shrubs are more beautiful in their
seed-time than whilst in flower, as their berries are very
ornamental. One very prickly bush bears inconspicuous little
greeny-white flowers, succeeded by quantities of berries, the size
of currants, but painted like peaches, shaded and tinted with the
brightest and clearest hues, with a soft tempting bloom on them;
but, alas! the beauty is to the eye alone! The apples on the Dead
Sea shore are not more deceptive in promise than my pretty
peach-berries of Tasmania.</p>

<p>A very handsome shrub, or small tree, the <i>Notelia</i>, bears
glossy bright berries of a rich morone crimson, deepening to black;
the leaves of this shrub are also beautiful, being long, and of a
deep, rich, polished green. Some species of <i>Leucopogon</i> bear
transparent berries, called native currants, but none of all these
are good to eat.</p>

<p>Wandering among my favourite river-side dingles and dells over
again on paper is so pleasant, that for my own part I could very
complacently loiter on, until every leaf and blossom I loved were
duly presented to my readers; but, remembering that paper and ink
can make at best but a sorry description of my bright sweet
flowers, and their wild, still, beautiful dwelling-places beside
the rippling river, or under the cypress shade, I must leave them,
although reluctantly; for I would fain show how wondrously fair
they are, and how possible it is to enjoy their beauty, and the
beauty of much more in this favoured land, without a thought or
dream of the horrors and terrors, and other uncomfortable
inventions, which it seems customary now to associate with the idea
of poor Tasmania.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">
Improvements.&mdash;Fishing.&mdash;Water-fowl.&mdash;Bush-rangers.&mdash;Who's
there?&mdash;Domestic Security.</p>

<p>Our pleasant little home had assumed a tolerably civilized
aspect by the summer of 1843-4. The principal rooms were plastered
and finished; the veranda erected along the front was by this time
partially hidden by roses, native clematis, and other plants; the
garden was thriving and productive; and behind the house, on the
same bank, stood a goodly barn, surrounded by other farm-buildings.
A granary was built of wood, supported some feet from the grund on
thick posts, in the vain hope of excluding the destructive little
mice from the corn; but in an incredibly short time they infested
it, as they do every building in the colony, and I think to a
greater degree than in England, our mild climate here no doubt
favouring their more rapid increase. Even our fields abound with
the little creatures, and in barns and stacks they literally swarm.
Bats I have heard of as having been seen here, but am happy in not
yet having myself made their acquaintance.</p>

<p>Among other of our improvements, a rampart of huge logs and an
embankment were raised, to defend the garden, in future, from the
devastating sweep of the river-floods, by restricting the entrance
of the water to a certain breadth, and preventing the wide tearing
rush of the torrent: to shut out the flood was impossible, but the
spread of the still water did comparatively little mischief,
especially after the main track of the floods had been laid down
with English grass-seed, which in time made a firm sward, and saved
the soil from being washed away and scooped in holes.</p>

<p>Our bright rivers often yielded us a nice dish of fish, for
which, however, we were most frequently indebted to the skill and
patience of some of our servants, not being ourselves much skilled
in the "gentle craft." When we did make an onslaught among the
delicate trout that abounded in the Cygnet's crystal pools, I much
suspect our proceedings would be pronounced positively heretical by
any proper orthodox angler. Walking across the verdant grassy
marshes (<i>Anglic</i> meadows) to the Cygnet River, each armed
with a "stick and a string," and some lean raw mutton for bait, we
selected our several pools, some of which were as much as four
yards across! George being stationed beside his papa or me, we
began to bait and bob; our rods being sticks, four or five feet
long, and our lines not much longer.</p>

<p>The chief charm consisted in our being able to see distinctly
down into the pool, and watch every movement of our finny victims;
and great was the excitement when, from amidst the waving shelter
of some long-tressed clustering water weeds, the round head and
winding body of a wriggling eel would glide into the sunlight, and
manoeuvre round the bait among the lesser fry, which instantly lost
value in our eyes, as every energy was devoted to the capture of
the greater prize, the achievement of which won a shout of delight
from George. The trout we usually caught were a small species, from
four to nine inches long, and very nice and delicate. A larger and
less firm kind of fish, called "Black fish," was also numerous; but
these seldom began to bite until after sunset, when the mosquitoes
began to bite too, so vehemently that I could not remain after that
time. Poor little George's bare legs were terribly attacked, and we
were thus driven home just as the proper fishing time approached,
for our men always began to fish after dark, lighting fires on the
banks of the large pools in the river, and often remaining out half
the night, having excellent sport.</p>

<p>Fine bream abound in the lower parts of the Swan River, where
the salt water prevails, and a small delicate fish, called
"cucumber fish," from its peculiar odour, is sometimes found in
great abundance in the rocky pools and basins higher up towards the
mountains.</p>

<p>Of the water-fowl of this colony, many species, like the poor
swans, have been so much destroyed and disturbed as to be almost
exterminated in most of the settled districts; we rarely see more
than a few wild ducks or teal in a season, although formerly every
lagune teemed with them, and with legions of bald coots, but the
latter are now so rare, that I have not yet seen one. The musk duck
is a large, heavy, beautiful bird, of dark sombre plumage, pervaded
with a strong scent of musk; of these I have seen two only, and
those were dead.</p>

<p>The mountain duck is a magnificent creature, with the clear blue
and chestnut brown of the kingfisher, added to all the bright
metallic hues of its other plumage. Sea-eagles, gannets, gulls of
various species, pelicans, divers, shags, cormorants, kingfishers,
and other aquatic birds, frequent most rivers and inlets in greater
or less abundance, in proportion to the populousness of the
vicinity, and the disturbance they suffer.</p>

<p>In December, 1848, our then new governor. Sir Eardley Wilmot,
paid Swan Fort a passing visit, in a tour he made on the east
coast, and I, a true lover of my native Warwickshire, naturally
felt more than common interest and pleasure in welcoming one so
well and deservedly esteemed at home, to our lowly abode in his new
dominion. Another connecting link seemed woven at once between my
new home and my old one; little did we then dream it would be so
soon and so cruelly broken!</p>

<p>Several parties of bush-rangers excited considerable alarm about
this time, and some of them came into our immediate neighbourhood,
robbing remote shepherds huts of food and clothing, and attacking
other dwellers in lonely places. One night, or rather morning,
about two o'clock, a violent rapping and thumping was heard at our
kitchen door, and of course the first half-dreaming thought was of
"Bush-rangers," although they are not in the habit of besieging
houses exactly in that style. Nevertheless, a parley was held (with
bolted doors), and the noisy visitor proved to be a settler from a
small farm about three miles distant, whose cottage had been
ransacked, and himself and servants "bailed up." As soon as he
could escape, he ran to warn us and other neighbours to be on our
guard against his lawless guests, who were, he supposed, still
lurking about. The fact, well known around us, that plenty of
loaded fire-arms were always kept ready for use in our house, may
have preserved us from like disturbances.</p>

<p>For several months at this time, ominous rumours were constantly
floating about, of the deeds and desperation of these marauding
parties, most of whom, it appeared, were making their way towards
our neighbourhood, in the belief that they would be able to seize
and take off some of the coasting vessels, which were always
trading to and fro, or lying at anchor at Swansea or Wabb's
Harbour; but no abduction of the kind took place.</p>

<p>A small party of soldiers was stationed on our farm, as being a
central situation, whence all the upper portions of the district
were readily accessible, in case the robbers were again heard of;
but no opportunity occurred for the display of their military
prowess, although the persevering activity they exhibited during
their abode at Spring Yale, in the capture and demolition of eggs
from our poultry-house, gave us a most impressive conviction of
their foraging capacities.</p>

<p>During this season of alarms, Mr. Meredith, who had been
detained at an out-station, was returning home on a Sunday morning,
and called at the house of a settler on the way. He found the doors
closely shut and fastened, and knocked stoutly for admittance.
Presently a face appeared at a window, and, beside the face, there
peeped out also the muzzle of a double-barrelled gun; whilst, from
within the door, a voice, accompanied by the peculiar click of
cocking a pistol, demanded "who was there, and what was wanted."
The peaceful cause of this warlike display being instantly
admitted, was ushered into the family sitting-room, where morning
prayers had just been read, and on the table (round which the old
gentleman and his wife and their patriarchal assemblage of sons and
daughters and grandchildren bad been seated) lay, side by side,
bibles, prayer-books, guns, pistols, and an old yeomanry sword: it
was like a meeting of the Covenanters of old. A report had, as it
appeared, reached them that morning, that a most daring and
notorious fellow, whose name had been the terror of the whole
country population for months, had been seen near their house, and
hence the preparations for defence in case of an attack, which,
however, was never made.</p>

<p>Fortunately this unpleasant condition of things was not destined
to continue. A new chief police magistrate arrived, in the person
of Mr. F.Burgess and, in an incredibly short time, his active
vigilance and well-organized system of pursuit effected an entire
change; so that, instead of parties of armed absconders being
tamely permitted to harass the defenceless country settlers for
months and even years together, their escape was so rapidly and
invariably succeeded by their recapture and punishment, that the
terrors of bush-ranging became absolutely almost forgotten in the
colony; and at the very time when the ridiculously-exaggerated
accounts of our lost and outraged condition were being diligently
circulated at Home, every country house in the island, however
lonely, was in far less danger of molestation and robbery than
those of any English city. How well I remember the nightly
preparation at Home, the fastening and barring of shutters,
locking, bolting, and chaining of doors, sticking up of spring-hung
bells, and all the elaborate defences of English houses, both in
town and country! whilst the loneliest dwelling here has neither
shutter nor bell, the French or sash windows are merely closed with
hasps, and the outer doors with a single bolt; and on many
occasions our lower windows have been left open, and the front door
unfastened all night.</p>

<p>It seems doubly hard on us, not only to suffer the odium of
receiving the majority of England's felons here, but also to have
the credit of keeping them as worthless as we get them; and, so far
as one small voice may serve to disprove it, I am by no means
disposed to let the false and injurious impression continue
dominant. True it is, and must be, that, out of the many thousand
convicts sent hither, some do remain wholly incorrigible; but, for
each one of such, are there not scores of good, willing men, who,
thankful for the opportunity afforded them here of leading a new
life, and enjoying in abundance all necessary comforts, are quiet,
orderly, industrious, and trusty servants? If this be not generally
the case, then we must have been singularly fortunate; but I
believe the old axiom, that "good masters make good servants,"
meets with more corroborative cases here than elsewhere. The low
mean spirit which loves to domineer over and taunt its fallen
brother with the perpetual upbraidings of his errors and
degradation, does more than check his onward struggles towards
amendment&mdash;it drives him forcibly back, and perchance further on
the road to perdition than he ever went before.</p>

Carriage."&mdash;A Conjurer.&mdash;Departure.&mdash;Passage over the
Tier.&mdash;"Hop-pole Bottom."&mdash;Economy of Government Officials.&mdash;Mount
Henry.</p>

<p>I HAVE before alluded to the heavy and calamitous losses which
the almost universal insolvency in New South Wales, and the
unprincipled conduct of persons whom we believed trustworthy, had
inflicted upon us. For a time we had ardently hoped, and earnestly
striven, to remedy the consequences; and, had the prices of farm
produce continued even moderate, we should, probably, have
succeeded; but wheat at 28<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a bushel was a sorry
help to remove mortgages at 10 per cent.</p>

<p>Reluctantly&mdash;most reluctantly&mdash;did we at last acknowledge the
necessity for some new plan of exertion; but having once resolved,
we lost no time in endeavouring to carry out our determination. Our
kind friend Sir Eardley Wilmot offered Mr. Meredith the police
magistracy of a newly-formed and remote district: it was accepted
thankfully; and, just as the pretty and loved home of our creation
was assuming an appearance, and a reality too, of comfort and
completeness, and all the rough and arduous work of a new place was
merging into mere pleasant cheerful occupation, we were destined to
leave it to the care of a few small tenants, the farm servants and
overseer. Unsettled as our former life had been, we had taken up
our abode at Spring Vale with the comfortable feeling that
<i>there</i> our wanderings had finally ceased, our weary wayfaring
ended. The conviction that all was about to begin again, came upon
my heart with most sorrowful and dispiriting anticipations; I felt
as if there were some evil spell upon us, dooming us always to go
on wandering, as if for us earth had not a home.</p>

<p>Our new settlement was to be in a district called Port Sorell,
of which previously we had scarcely so much as heard. We found that
it occupied the central portion of the north coast, about 150 miles
from Swan Port; and its sea-side viciity was a potent charm in
reconciling us to our migration thither.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith set out to enter upon his new duties in the
beginning of May, leaving me at Spring Vale with our two children.
My husband's letters descriptive of the new country were indeed
discouraging: the scenery, except that on the sea-borders, was one
vast dreary forest&mdash;damp, dark, and dismal; the inhabitants, with a
few exceptions, miserably poor, so that the contrast to our
comfortable and substantial neighbours of Swan Port was somewhat
striking. Another unpleasant peculiarity I soon perceived&mdash;that of
the extreme wetness of the climate, for every letter I received,
whether one or more reached me in a week, contained some similar
paragraph, such as, "The rain has not ceased for four days;" "It is
raining heavily;" or, "I have just come in, wet through." The place
seemed to be the constant scene of a partial deluge.</p>

<p>The impracticability of a winter transit for our children and
myself, and the difficulty Mr. Meredith found in procuring a
residence for us, combined to delay his arrangements for our
removal; and at the end of June he came home for a brief visit, and
again returned to Port Sorell, without being able to end, as I had
hoped he would, my lonely sojourn in single uncomfortableness. Most
dreary were the long winter evenings, which had never seemed long
before, and perfectly intolerable were the floods, when they
prevented my receiving the "post."</p>

<p>My chief occupation was the gradual packing up and removal of
our goods and chattels down to Swansea, in readiness for the vessel
which was to take them round to Port Sorell, and as the winter
rains rendered the roads and rivers often quite impassable, and
always nearly so, we could only cart down small loads at a time.
Accordingly all articles not essentially useful, such as pictures,
&amp;c., were first taken down and put away in cases, then most of
our books, and by degrees every piece of furniture that could be
spared, until the baby was put to sleep first in a drawer, and,
when the drawers departed, in a clothes-basket.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August, when I was in daily expectation of
Mr. Meredith's arrival, to take us back with him to Port Sorell,
one of our terrible floods arose; the inundated lowlands became, as
usual, one vast lagune, and the raging rivers swept angrily along
in swollen rapid torrents. Knowing that the streams on the inland
side of the mountain-tier frequently show no indication of rising,
even when ours are flooded, I feared greatly for my husband's
safety, as he could not arrive near home before late in the
evening, and then might rashly venture into danger. I had scouts
out until after dark, and the head shepherd, a faithful old servant
(albeit formerly a <i>prisoner</i>), went wading across the flooded
lands, up to his middle in water, hoping to meet or hear his
master, so as to assist him; but he at length came in, satisfied
that no one who knew the place as Mr. Meredith did would attempt to
cross the flooded Cygnet that night; and I tried to persuade myself
that it was so, although more than half inclined to feel cross with
the good man for giving up his watch, and very much disposed to go
forth in the pelting rain and resume it myself, when the noise of a
finger lightly tapping at the window sent me in one bound to the
door, where, wet and dripping as a merman, stood my own good
man!</p>

<p>Instantly the whole quiet household was joyously astir; and when
the streaming guest had been all comfortably arrayed and refreshed,
he told his story, as benighted wanderer should. The whole country
was partially under water, and the Cygnet River formed a wide
outspread stream, with several deep channels, and broad intervening
shallows, all which he had to traverse in the dark, on foot; it
would have been impossible to ride, as he trusted to his memory of
certain fallen trees to aid him in crossing some of the channels.
In one or two instances, after cautiously wading to the spot where
he remembered a fallen tree-bridge, it was not to be found, except
by <i>probing</i> the gully with the pole he carried, when the log
was discovered two or three feet under water: at length the last
deep channel was crossed, the inundate marsh splashed through, and
he gained our terrace-like bank.</p>

<p>As one preparation for our transit, a strong easy vehicle,
something of the jaunting-car genus, on invention of Mr.
Meredith's, which had been some time in progress, was now quickly
completed, and fully answered our expectations. The seat, a
<i>dos--dos</i>, and very roomy for four persons, being made
movable, to shift on the body, according to the number conveyed,
enabled the weight to be always placed centrally over the axle; and
this arrangement, with four excellent springs, and high wheels,
gave an easy uniform motion like that of a good Stanhope, instead
of the agonizing spasmodic shaking to and fro of the cars commonly
in use here, which have only two springs, and are the most perfect
instruments of torture conceivable. The springs and axle were
procured from a good coachmaker, the body was very neatly made and
painted by our own carpenter; a neighbouring blacksmith and
wheelwright, who was quite an artist of a Vulcan, made the wheels
and remaining ironwork, and put all together; whilst the cushions
displayed my proficiency in the upholstery department: so that our
"family carriage" was truly home-made, and did us all infinite
credit; not the least useful part of it being a large square box,
fitting in beneath the double seat, and capable of containing a
very tolerable travelling equipment for our party. All Long Acre
could not have furnished us with a conveyance so well adapted to
the service we required; whilst its perfect originality, and the
curiosity and diversity of opinions it excited, were infinitely
amusing. Its first appearance in public was on the occasion of our
farewell visit to Cambria, when the rivers were still almost
dangerously high; but our stout tandem, good horses, and skilful
driver overcame all obstacles.</p>

<p>An itinerant conjurer, who was engaged to perform before the
party in the evening, afforded our George the extremest delight.
He, unsophisticated child of the Bush, had never beheld anything of
the kind before, and gazed with fascinated astonishment, as each
respectably ancient piece of legerdemain was exhibited, clapped his
hands with joy at the disclosure of the impromptu pancake, shouted
aloud when a cauliflower tumbled from his papa's hat, and
contemplated the fire-eating process with a comical mixture of
curiosity and horror; but the climax of his mystification and
amazement arrived when the pistol, which George had seen properly
loaded with a ball, was deliberately fired in the necromancer's
face&mdash;and, coolly taking the bullet from his mouth, the marvellous
man showed it, slightly flattened, to the spectators! Poor little
boy! I began to debate within myself whether such a blissful state
of ignorance deserved more my commiseration or my envy. Not that
<i>I</i> was an uninterested witness of the good old tricks; they
were too pleasant, as reminders of bygone times, and my own
childish wonderment, to seem at all despicable now.</p>

<p>Returning home the following day, our final arrangements were
made, and next morning we set forth from our dear cottage-home, to
cross the mountain-tier to the north, in order to get into the main
road to Launceston. Our party consisted of Mr. Meredith and myself,
the two children and nursemaid in the car, our old house-servant on
horseback, and several others to assist us over the tier.</p>

<p>For the first five or six miles our road was comparatively good;
we then reached a ford of the Swan River at the foot of the hills,
where a saddle-horse was waiting for me; George also was mounted
before one of the men on horseback, the baby carried by another,
whilst Mr. Meredith and a third led the tandem horses, with the
nearly empty car, up the steep ascent. After a fatiguing climb of
several miles, we paused for a few minutes on a high point of the
mountain range, whence we gained a last beautiful farewell view of
the grand Schoutens. We then continued our journey over rough
abrupt masses of rock, varying from the size of a waggon to that of
a hat-box, heaped together in one chaotic wilderness of mounts and
ravines, thickly covered with both growing and fallen timber.</p>

<p>By about three in the afternoon we had accomplished the descent
of the mountains, and forthwith prepared for dinner. The horses
were taken out to graze, a fire made to leeward of our grassy
dining-table, and our commissariat unpacked, which contained a cold
turkey, ham, cakes, wine, &amp;c., and we brought that best relish,
a good appetite, to the banquet. This over, the supernumeraries
from Spring Vale and the horse I had ridden over the tier turned
again homewards, and we journeyed on, through bogs, logs, mud-pits,
and quagmires, as we best might, in a hollow denominated "Hop-pole
Bottom," which, being full of deep holes of water and fallen
timber, was perilous to traverse, after so much rain, and amply
tested the safe qualities of our stout vehicle, and the strength
and docility of our good horses.</p>

<p>In this valley, the first sign of a human abode we had seen
since passing the Swan River greeted us in the shape of a large
assemblage of huts and other buildings, almost like a village,
erected for the accommodation of a Probation road-party, who the
neighbouring settlers innocently expected would have made the
fearful track we had traversed conveniently passable; but,
according to the usual custom of the late Comptroller-General, the
convicts were ordered for removal elsewhere, so soon as all the
expense of building their abode had been incurred by the
Government, and without their being suffered to become useful, as
they might and ought to have been in this and many other places:
thus affording another notable instance of the obstinate reckless
obstructiveness of the officer in question.</p>

<p>"Mount Henry," a hill of picturesque outline, but provoking
situation, lay before us, and our road, or rather track, made
four-fifths of a circuit round it, affording us a long series of
monotonous views; "Mount Henry" being to us, as Salisbury Cathedral
was to Mr. Pecksniff's pupils, the object of contemplation from all
points of the compass. The short twilight ceased ere we approached
our destination for the night, which was the cottage of a friendly
settler acquaintance; but after manifold groping examinations of
fences, in search of an entrance gate, we at length succeeded in
making our way on foot into a ploughed field, and thence to the
garden gate, not without being in some jeopardy from the numerous
dogs of all kinds and sizes, which our nocturnal invasion had
aroused to full vigilance and wrath. Our kind reception
within-doors seemed doubly pleasant after so rough a salutation
without, and the hospitable attentions of our good friends were not
a little enhanced by the fatigue and difficulty of our past day's
journey.</p>

<p>The first part of our next days journey was through a beautiful
valley, between fine ranges of wooded hills, one of which, from its
high round form, is named "Saint Paul's Dome." Our road lay along
the opposite declivity, overlooking the vale, with its snug farms
and cottages, green lawn-like fields, and the bright winding river
("Saint Paul's River") outspread in fair array below us.</p>

<p>We had frequently to get out of the car, whilst Mr. Meredith
drove it over some dangerous gully or steep ravine, and then, with
his and the manservant's help, we scrambled over too, and reseated
ourselves; but as sometimes we were obliged to seek for logs or
stones, to build a foot-bridge or make stepping-places over brooks
or creeks, these interruptions greatly delayed us. One most
horrible black morass spread out before us over a length and
breadth of some acres, rendering any avoidance of it by walking
over utterly hopeless, and, after a brief contemplative pause, Mr.
Meredith urged the horses straight on. In they plunged, nearly up
to the shafts, in a sable sea of something very like bird-lime; and
I cannot now remember, without horror, my (by no means groundless)
dread lest we should be smothered, or that the traces should break,
as the good horses dragged, and struggled, and floundered on; but
at last they rose again upon the hard ground, and pulled us safely
out.</p>

<p>As we drove pleasantly along "Saint Paul's Plains," fully
appreciating the comfort of hard firm ground, albeit sometimes
rough with rocks, my attention had for some minutes been engrossed
by the graceful outlines of the distant hills on our left, and in
watching the changes of effect caused by the passage of clouds
across the sunlight, when, on looking again to the right, I
involuntarily uttered a cry of astonishment and delight:&mdash;beyond a
sort of promontory, in which one hilly range abruptly ended, had
arisen, as if by enchantment, a living picture of the snowy Alps! a
distant lofty expanse of crag, and battlement, and peak, all white
and dazzling in silvery snow, amidst which the steep sides of some
mighty buttress-like rocks showed black as jet, and the deep blue
unclouded sky crowned this glorious scene; which, I suppose, was
yet the more charming to me as being wholly unexpected. My new
mountain friend was the Tasmanian Ben Lomond, the lordly chief of a
great mountain group in the north-east of our beautiful island.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="ill-14" id="ill-14"></a><img alt="" src=
"1600411h-images/14-BenLomond.jpg">
</p>

<p class="caption">Ben Lomond, from St. Paul's Plains.<br>
[From a sketch by the Bishop of Tasmania.]</p>

<p>We drove on, still along the plains, with no living thing near
us, save the wild birds and some scattered sheep; the grand snowy
mountain changing, but not waning, in its stately beauty as we
proceeded. Soon after midday we halted in a little isolated grove
of trees, affording both shade from the sun and shelter from the
wind (which sweeps keenly across these wide plains), and also
yielding us some dry firewood, a bright fire being, whether needed
or not, an indispensable part of a bush bivouac. I contrived to
gain time for a slight hasty sketch of Ben Lomond before the order
for our onward march was given. For foreground there was the wide
plain, only varied by a few stray straggling trees, and one or two
indistinct tracks across it; beyond, ranges of hills, covered with
sombre forests, rose dark and abruptly, and above these the
snow-clad summit of Ben Lomond rested against the clear blue
sky.</p>

<p>Changes of the same landscape accompanied us in the afternoon,
until near the lonely inn where we intended sleeping; and, just as
we had alighted to walk down the steep rocky bank of the "Stony
Creek," we heard a hearty joyous cry of "Here they are! Here's the
master!" and two of our own servants, who had gone with a cart-load
of our trunks and bedding to Campbell Town, and were staying a
night at the inn on their way back, came running to meet us, ready
to carry the children, or lead the horses, or draw the car
themselves, if it would benefit us, all eager alacrity and good
humour.</p>

<p>On the top of the high bank, and facing another high hill which
rose before it, stood the narrow tall brick house, which rejoiced
in the sign of the "Deoch an dorich" (my Gaelic is most probably
ill-spelt). Being very new, the sepulchral odour of fresh plaster
was rather predominant within, varied at intervals by a gush of
fragrance from yet more recent paint; and the parlour was drearily
cold and cheerless, fire never having been as yet introduced to the
new hearth, whilst all entrance of sunshine was carefully prevented
by a grenadier regiment of tall geraniums and fuchsias, trained and
woven upon high triangular wooden ladders, reared against the
windows, apparently with the laudable purpose of enabling the
flowers to peep over the opposite hill; the lower panes being also
defended by an outpost of spiteful prickly cactuses, forming a
compact <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>. Still, when the chimney had smoked
its best to dislodge us, and finally given up the attempt as
hopeless, and a blazing fire in some measure thawed the icy
vault-like atmosphere, we found our quarters by no means
despicable, especially when the customary dinner-tea-and-supper
meal overspread the ample table, and the pleasant fumes of tea and
coffee overcame even the damp plaster and fresh paint.</p>

<p>"Mine host" of the "Stirrup-cup" did us good service the
following morning, by accompanying, or rather preceding us, on
horseback, to show us a way through the Bush by which we could
avoid a notoriously dreadful boggy lane in the neighbourhood. We
had still some unpleasant "creeks" and watercourses to traverse,
but all were easily passed, and soon aftter noon we, to our great
joy, emerged on the fine main road, and felt all difficulties at an
end for a while. Sitting on the bank, we discussed our luncheon,
and then smoothly and merrily drove along the hard broad metalled
road through Epping Forest to the Snake Banks, where we halted for
the night at a very good comfortable inn, with the sign of the
"Eagle's Return" on the signboard; and in a duplicate copy over the
door of each room, the same design appeared, representing an eagle
pecking at a very bare bone. What hidden meaning might be attached
to this picture, I am not aware, but the feeling it naturally
excited was one of compassion, that the noble bird, whose "return"
seemed an event of some interest and importance, should not have
found better fare to welcome his arrival.</p>

<p>Whilst the waiter was bringing in dinner, I observed him
endeavouring to drive something out of the room, and thinking it
was our spaniel, I said, "Do not drive the dog out, let him
stay."</p>

<p>"Oh! ma'am, if you please it's our missis's tame jackass, and
he's sometimes so rude, he gets upon the gentlemen's heads; I'd
better put him out, if you please, ma'am."</p>

<p>But the jackass did not seem inclined to be so easily dismissed,
and I had the pleasure of his amusing company for some time.
Talking a little, and hopping about a great deal, the poor bird
appeared very happy, and was equally entertaining. It had perfect
liberty, and flew in and out and all about the house at pleasure;
sometimes chattering upon the banisters upstairs, and then flying
out to hail the arrival of new guests.</p>

<p>The bird so ridiculously named a jackass is about the size and
shape of a starling, with dark shaded brown plumage, and, being
easily reared and tamed, is often kept as a pet; it learns to
whistle tunes, and to say a few words tolerably plainly, and is a
merry sociable bird when allowed its freedom, as this one was,
which seemed quite a popular character in the establishment.</p>

<p>The arrival of the mail and other coaches was a great event for
George, to whom the whole busy affair of changing horses was a most
amusing novelty; and I confess I was far from an apathetic
spectator myself, for the bright handsome vehicles, the good
horses, and orthodox-looking guards and coachmen, were all pleasant
lively reminders of Home, although now, I fear, almost obsolete
there. The substitution of hideous smoking steam-engines, dark
tunnels, and sooty stokers, for the gay, brisk, well-horsed coach,
is, in my mind, as unpleasant an offering upon the altar of utility
as the equally-prevalent change from beautiful graceful sailing
vessels to clumsy thick-chimneyed sputtering steamers. The saving
of horse-torture would, however, be a weighty argument, with me, in
favour of steam and iron, were not the luckless omnibus and
cabhorses driven more furiously and mercilessly then ever, in
consequence of the generally-accelerated speed of travelling.
Doubtless we far-off colonists are apt to think of English railways
with feelings a little embittered by the unnecessary fatigues and
deprivations we suffer here, from the lamentable mismanagement of
an amount of labour which, if wisely and honestly directed, would
leave us little to envy, in the item of roads, in any country. But
in the present state of things, the contrast is tryingly great,
between English people at home, for whom journeys on turnpike roads
like bowling-greens are now too tardy and difficult, and English
colonists here, who (except the few residing near the one main
road) have little else but mountain and bog in a state of nature to
scramble over, whether for business or pleasure; so that the most
amiable of us cannot restrain an occasional growl, or a wish,
however bootless, that the despised turnpike-roads of the mother
country could, like other despised and condemned things, be
transported hither as a bequest to her daughter.</p>

<p>We left the Snake Banks after a night's sojourn, and drove on to
Perth; the whole of the land on either side being inclosed for
sheep-runs, farms, pleasure-grounds, and gardens, with pleasant
houses and cottages seen at intervals, and my grand favourite Ben
Lomond lifting his snowy head above all the eastward scenery. On
our left lay a wide extent of inclosed and cultivated lowland,
dotted with houses and settlements, beyond which the great western
range of mountains stretched in a long dark shadowy chain of
snow-crowned peaks and wide bleak moorland heights, which may be
considered as the vertebrae of our Tasmanian mountain system, which
sends out limbs that traverse most of the eastern half of the
island, and almost wholly occupy the western. Embosomed in these
dreary mountain wilds are several large and beautiful lakes, of
whose lonely grandeur and picturesque scenery I have heard their
explorers speak in terms of high admiration; and in the summer,
numerous flocks of sheep are sent to depasture in the grassy
valleys and lowland in their vicinity.</p>

<p>We entered the flourishing town of Perth on the south-east, over
a handsome stone bridge of eight arches, with bold stone parapets,
and quite an imposing aspect, more like a good old English bridge
than the usually flimsy colonial constructions, which seem for the
most part built on the principle of children's card-houses, for the
pleasure of seeing them tumble down again. The broad rapid river,
the signs of population and industry on its banks, the many good
finished buildings around, and many more in progress, gave a
pleasant cheering aspect to the place; and during the hour's halt
we made at one of the inns, whilst the horses rested, we walked
down, after luncheon, to the bridge, to sketch and look about more
at our leisure; we then drove on to Launceston.</p>

<p>After living for five years in the "Bush," and having a personal
acquaintance with nearly every human being we were in the habit of
meeting on the road, and almost with every team of cattle, I found
quite a childish amusement in seeing so many new people, new
horses, and new vehicles of all descriptions, as we approached the
town. Neat suburban cottages, veritable "cottages of gentility,"
with coach-houses complete, abounded by the road-side, with their
strips of garden and smart green gates. Carts full of cut wood were
travelling townwards for sale, a sure indication of our advance
towards a denser population. Brewers', bakers', and other
trades-peoples' errand carts were jogging about; waggons nodded
drowsily along, loaded with the furniture of hapless people,
"flitting" like ourselves; gigs, pony chaises, phaetons, and Irish
cars of all kinds, all full of people, in spruce dresses, driving
briskly to and fro, mingled with numerous equestrians of all
grades, and divers quadrupeds being led forth towards Campbell
Town, in readiness for a grand "hunt" on the morrow.</p>

<p>Nor were we, whilst observing, unobserved. Many a curious glance
and earnest stare were bestowed on our original turn-out; the good
horses, correct harness, and clever character of the whole, rather
enhancing the interest awakened by the novelty of our carriage
itself, and the family group it contained, with our handsome little
dog gravely looking out in front; and then the wandering eyes next
rested on our short stout old servant, in his new suit of velveteen
and tall shiny black hat, with his shot-belt and double-barrelled
gun carried rather defiantly than otherwise, and mounted on a horse
too tall to be easily ascended in haste: altogether, we must have
borne unmistakable evidences of our country rearing, and I can only
hope that we proved as amusing to the good folks we met as they did
to us.</p>

<p>From the brow of a hill down which the road passes into
Launceston, we commanded a full view of the town and adjacent
"swamp" (as it is, for a miracle, rightly named). Dense fogs are so
prevalent in this ill-situated place, that I believe there are not
many days in the year when this view can be enjoyed; the usual
prospect which awaits the expectant traveller on this spot being a
rolling mass of thick white vapour, below which, as if at the
bottom of a mighty steaming cauldron. lies, he is told, the
populous town of Launceston, which, as we saw it unveiled, with its
shipping along the wharf, and the far winding river lying bright in
the sunshine, formed really a very pretty picture. The beauty,
unhappily, is only perceptible at a distance, and on entering the
town vanishes entirely amidst the dirty streets, where the handsome
churches and other buildings, and good large well-stored shops, are
interspersed with mean squalid hovels, unpleasant even to pass.</p>

<p>We found roomy apartments prepared for us at a quiet hotel, and
took up our abode there for two or three days, Mr. Meredith having
business to arrange. The portion we occupied had been added since
the original building of the house, and, from some contrivance or
whim, the windows of our drawing-room, which were not above a yard
high, rested nearly on the ground, so that the only comfortable way
of looking out was by sitting on the floor beside them, a mode of
proceeding much more congenial to George's tastes than my own.</p>

<p>So far we had had no choice as to our mode of transit, but now
the question arose, whether we should go on the remaining sixty or
seventy miles by land, or take a passage in one of the little
coasting vessels, and ship the car with us, sending the horses
overland, the way, for <i>road</i> there was none, being deemed by
every one but Mr. Meredith as totally impracticable for the tandem.
<i>He</i> said he could drive over it, having carefully noted all
the difficulties in his former journeys, and gave me my choice. In
furtherance of my decision, we went to the wharf, and looked down
into two of the Port Sorell vessels: they were very small, very
dirty, and gave out such a potent compound odour of stale tobacco,
grease, and bilge water, that I stepped back and gave my
casting-vote for a land progress; thinking that even a night's
lodging in the forest, under or within the hollow trunk of an old
gum tree, would at any rate be a cleaner and sweeter kind of
penance than an incarceration, perhaps for a week or more, in
either of the cabins I had peeped into.</p>

<p>Accordingly, our business being ended, we remained no longer in
Launceston, but gladly drove out again on the third afternoon of
our sojourn, though half drowned in a pelting thunder-shower which
fell just as we started; and, after a boggy progress for ten miles,
we stayed for the night at the little village of Carrick, where we
found the neatest of all possible inn-parlours, and the prettiest
and most obliging of all nice amiable landladies (a colonial Mrs.
Lupin, with teeth and eyes that a duchess might have envied), and
were as cosy and comfortable as we could desire.</p>

<p>Having an hour's daylight to spare, Mr. Meredith took me down
the muddy road to see an old mill of which he had become enamoured
in his lonely journeys this way; nor was I at all disappointed in
it. All buildings in these new countries are so completely the
things of yesterday, and generally look so glaringly and
obtrusively new and discordant amidst the surrounding scenery, that
it is especially pleasant to see anything of human work which has
really mellowed into something like an harmonious character, and so
this crazy old weather-board mill won its way to our admiration. We
stood on the rather frail wooden bridge which the road crosses, and
looked up the narrow rocky bed of the stream, which came foaming
and chafing down towards us, overshadowed in many places by
graceful bending trees, and an infinite number of lovely flowering
shrubs, growing on the steep banks and little islets of the noisy
turbulent river, the "Liffey," a tributary of the Meander. A
portion of the water turned aside a short distance above these
rapids was conveyed along a wooden trough, supported on stout tall
mossy props, which displayed an infinite variety of angles,
according to their respective lengths and the inequalities of the
ground. This "lead" brought the water to the mill, where it poured
down in a glassy sheet on the dark shining old-fashioned overshot
wheel, that brought to my mind the many old water-mills I had loved
to loiter beside at Home; and, as the vexed stream flowed onwards,
lodging its creamy wreaths of foam on the rushes as it hurried
along, it seemed like the strange links of a dream, to unite the
long-ago with the more recent scenes of my life; till it rushed
madly down a little ravine, and tumbled again into the parent
stream, carrying all my retrospective romance along with it, and
leaving me ready to walk back to tea. Since my visit a tall, sharp,
grievously-neat, new mill has taken the place of the picturesque
old wooden building, and I am thankful that I am never likely to
pass through Carrick again.</p>

Forest.&mdash;Midday Halt.&mdash;Leech.&mdash;Night Ride.&mdash;Difficulties of the
Road.&mdash;Safe Arrival.</p>

<p>Leaving our neat inn and our pretty hostess after breakfast the
following morning, we struggled on through the quagmire roads as we
best might, sometimes waiting whilst the servant rode on ahead to
fathom the depth of any very threatening bog before we ventured
into it, but generally trusting to good driving and stout horses to
pull us through.</p>

<p>A bridge over the South Esk had a toll-house and gate upon it,
and this would have been a pleasant scrap of Old-World ways had the
road in the vicinity been worth paying for; but as, on the
contrary, it appeared to me that we deserved rather a handsome
premium for enduring the risk and misery it involved, the charge
seemed adding insult to injury.</p>

<p>The snow, which lay thick and white along the higher ridges,
gave a piercing keenness to the bleak southerly wind, as it blew
aside cloaks and shawls and furs; the poor children looked pinched
with cold, through all their mufflings, and we were glad to sit by
the inn fire to thaw, when we stopped for a few minutes at
Westbury, a watery, dreary, muddy place, and the coldest part of
the island I have yet visited.</p>

<p>The roads became gradually but evidently worse as we approached
the forest. Often I thought we must relinquish the idea of taking
the car further, and travel on upon the horses in the best way we
could, but still we advanced, and before evening reached Deloraine,
on the river Meander.</p>

<p>We passed through a great part of the settlement, which, with
its recently-erected raw brick and wooden buildings, has very much
the character of the ugly irregular suburbs of some fast-growing
manufacturing town, with square patches of ground fenced for
gardens, but as yet producing little besides a scattered crop of
brick ends, old mortar-pits, and sawdust, with here and there a
huge black stump remaining unburned, to tell of the departed
forest.</p>

<p>A singularly picturesque wooden bridge crossed the Meander here,
formed of several piers of logs supporting the causeway, each of
the piers being built of even logs laid crosswise in a square,
partially bedded into each other at the comers, but leaving space
between each so as to offer less resistance to the water when
floods occurred. The causeway and railing of the bridge were
considerably out of repair when we crossed it, but the ponderous
piers had every appearance of stability; and the river was then
considered very high. Since then a heavy flood of rain came,
bringing down immense quantities of fallen trees from a
neighbouring "clearing," which blocked up the openings of the
bridge, and the tremendous weight of the timber and the body of
impeded water behind it entirely carried away the whole fabric. It
has been replaced by a new one, which I have not seen.</p>

<p>Close to the bridge was our destined inn, a square red-brick
house, looking older than most others in the settlement, and the
property of its landlord, a tolerably wealthy man, but who, finding
his circumstances thriving, and his inn receiving abundant custom,
seemed to think all improvement in attendance or refinements in
accommodation wholly unnecessary; yet he practised genuine
liberality in the <i>stable</i> department&mdash;a golden virtue in
country innkeepers.</p>

<p>A good fire was our first desideratum on our arrival, and then,
being warmed, we requested to be fed. A large round table stood in
the middle of the parlour we occupied, and presently the elderly
good wife of our host came in with a huge loaf of bread in her
arms, which she deposited in the middle of the bare table, and
hurried off (to fetch a tray or dish and a tablecloth, as I
innocently supposed); but in a few seconds she returned, carrying
an enormous cheese, which promptly descended, with a heavy sound,
beside the loaf, also on the bare wood; then I began to understand
the style of things a little better, and looked on in no small
amusement to see what would follow. Next came a heap of large blue
plates (the dear old inexhaustible "willow pattern "), and on these
a fearful mass of gigantic wooden-hafted knives and forks; then a
very small tea-tray, with a very large crockery teapot, and a tall
shaking tower of capacious blue cups and saucers, skilfully packed
together; with some table-spoons of German silver, or some other
equally unpleasant composition. A basin of black sugar, and some
coarse salt, completed the display, until the entrance of a great
dish of hot fried mutton-chops and rashers of salt pork.</p>

<p>Spirits and excellent English bottled ale and porter are kept in
the meanest public-houses in the colonies; but of their wine, the
white is cape, and the port of that peculiar vintage for which
"Punch" gave us the recipe some years ago, prescribing a decoction
of logwood, brown paper, and old boots.</p>

<p>Some cases of well-stuffed native birds adorned our parlour, and
after tea we had a most unexpected and unlikely treat in such a
place, being the company of a very large and excellent musical box,
which played some brilliant airs from new operas very
pleasingly.</p>

<p>We were dismayed the following morning to find a thick heavy
rain falling in a steady determined way, as if to preclude all
chance of our proceeding; and our host prognosticated "a big
flood," which was a remarkably cheering and pleasant augury! Our
breakfast was the tea over again, minus the cheese, and I obtained
a few eggs for our own servant to boil for us, frying being the
only popular mode of cooking them here.</p>

<p>We had slept very comfortably ourselves, "with everything sweet
and clean, though bare and rough in the extreme, and the other beds
looked equally well; but when poor George came to me, the odour of
the abominable "mutton-bird" pillow on which he had lain was most
sickening; and it is retained so strongly in the hair, that the
most elaborate washing, aided by "Macassar" and Eau de Cologne, is
all unavailing: time alone will remove it. I believe a little
careful preparation renders these offensive feathers quite
inodorous, but, being cheap, they are used commonly without. It is
impossible to be in the same room with any person, or even any
garment, that has passed the night on such a bed, without being
most unpleasantly aware of the scent.</p>

<p>As I could not find any books to read, save the "Newgate
Calendar," I sat at the window sketching the bridge, whilst the
rain forbade our walking about.</p>

<p>The worst thirty miles of our journey now lay before us&mdash;the
passage through the forest; and, as it seemed scarcely possible to
achieve it in one day, short as they were at that season, we
thought of hiring some mattresses and blankets from Deloraine, and
sending them to a vacant cottage which we had permission to use,
ten miles on the way, that we might rest a night there, and divide
the stage; but the account we received of this place, which was in
the "care" of an Irish stock-keeper, and the abode of untold
legions of all varieties of vermin, put a stop to that plan. The
only other house on our way was but four miles beyond Deloraine,
but even that distance it was desirable to subtract from our last
long stage; and a note to the hospitable owner, requesting the aid
of a night's lodging, speedily brought him in person, as its reply,
to escort us back with him at once. Just as we were starting, our
groom arrived from Port Sorell, with Mr. Meredith's saddle-horse,
equipped with a side saddle, which enabled me to travel more
pleasantly, and also to lighten the car. Four miles of boggy,
rocky, slippery, sloppy progress brought us to our new friend's
cottage, where all that the kindest hospitality could suggest was
done for our comfort.</p>

<p>Bidding a grateful adieu to our worthy entertainer the next
morning, we set forth on our last day's pilgrimage, about eight
o'clock, with a slight drizzling rain falling, which happily did
not increase, and at intervals wholly ceased, but the day continued
damp and gloomy.</p>

<p>We plodded on, through dreary woods and swampy plains, now
fording a lagune, now scrambling over a gully, till a steep channel
containing a broad stream of black liquid mud lay before us,
bearing the cheerful appellation of "Dead Cow Creek." Setting down
the children and the maid, Mr. Meredith drove into it, and our poor
leader instantly disappeared, all but his head; but floundering on,
he emerged, and the wheeler went in, and finally the car; all
clambering safely out again, in process of time, on the opposite
bank. The maid crossed over by walking along the rails of an
adjoining fence; the children were carried; and I made my way down
the bank of the gully, till I found a place narrow enough for my
horse to jump across. Then we hastened on again, for many such
obstacles beset us, and our general progress could very rarely
exceed a walk.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on passing through a gate near to a lonely stock-hut,
we were surrounded by fifteen or twenty great fierce dogs, growling
and barking furiously; but before any worse effect was produced
than that of making our valiant little dog, Dick, look as bold and
angry as if he seriously contemplated fighting the whole party
himself, they were called off by the stock-keepers, who very
civilly offered us some refreshment, and were very anxious that I
would at least take a "pot o' tea;" but it was too early for
luncheon, and I am not sufficiently imbued with the genuine bush
predilections to admire the composition usually known here as
"tea," among the labouring class.</p>

<p>Soon after passing the hospitable stockmen, we reached the
Avenue Plain, which in summer must be a beautiful spot, but was
then covered with water, from a few inches to a foot or more deep.
Its name tolerably well describes it; a wide, long, open space,
intervening between the belt of fine verdant lightwoods and other
trees skirting the river "Rubicon" and the great forest; so that it
is a grassy flat, surrounded by high wood, and in summer is a
valuable grazing ground. We did not pass the Rubicon until some
time after, and then crossed only a branch of the classic stream,
of very insignificant dimensions.</p>

<p>From the Avenue Plain we turned aside, and at once plunged into
the dark forest. Gigantic gum-trees rose on every side, and in
every variety that such tail, straight, bare, gaunt things can
exhibit; for handsome as <i>single</i> gum-trees frequently are,
and thick-foliaged and massive in their sombre hues, those which
grow clustered in the forests are almost invariably ugly, and these
were so close together that it was only possible to see around for
a short distance, and so destitute of leaf or branch for a height
of fifty or seventy feet, that nothing but timber seemed to shut in
the view, except where a stray lightwood or wattle brought the
welcome relief of foliage to the drear gray wall of upright trunks.
Unhappily, they were not all upright; the fallen ones giving us
infinitely more trouble than the serried ranks standing; the car
often having to make long dtours to get round them, amidst dead
wood, holes, bogs, and all imaginable obstacles.</p>

<p>At last, for every mile of our difficult progress through this
dismal, dreary, and most monotonous forest seemed like a dozen
leagues at least, we made our mid-day halt for nearly an hour;
watered and fed the horses, for whom we had brought some oats from
Deloraine, and made a good fire to cook our provisions and make
some tea, which, being hot, was more coveted than the ale or wine
we had with us. Everything around us was cold, damp, dark, and
gloomy. Hideous fungi, of all varieties of shape and colour,
clustered beneath the wet half-charred logs, or inside the hollow
trees, as if they knew themselves to be unfit to meet the light of
day, or even the twilight of the forest, so disgusting were they,
in their livid, bloated, venomous-looking swarms.</p>

<p>Our allotted rest was soon over, and we set forth again; on, on
went the car, jolting, bumping, and splashing along, over logs,
rocks, lagunes, and bogs; whilst, as I followed its erratic course,
I often reined up my horse, and waited, almost breathlessly, to
watch its passage over some unusually threatening "bad bit of
road," but providentially no accident happened.</p>

<p>Occasionally we came to some semblance of a bridge, rarely more
than the skeleton, the holes and gaps in which had to be
temporarily stopped with leafy boughs of trees and shrubs and
bundles of cut reeds and grass, so that the horses feet might not
slip through in crossing. All these delays hindered us exceedingly,
and we found the short winter afternoon advancing fast, whilst we
were yet far from our destination. A few plants of the beautiful
large crimson epacris began to appear at intervals, and soon became
abundant; but before, behind, and on all sides, spread the dreary
vast forest, an interminable continuance of the same sombre
desolate picture, till I began to doubt if the existence of meadows
and open country were not altogether a mere pleasant fiction.</p>

<p>I was riding at some distance from the car, when I heard a
scream from the nursemaid, and, on hurrying up, found her in great
terror and wonder to know what could have hurt the baby, who was
bleeding fast from a wound beneath the chin, evidently the bite of
a leech. These creatures are very numerous in such damp cold places
as those we were traversing; our dogs were often afterwards seen
with several hanging to their legs whilst out hunting; and one had
probably been brushed into the car from some of the moist shrubs,
and, after satisfying its appetite, had dropped off again, for it
could nowhere be found.</p>

<p>Soon after this little fright, a horseman was seen approaching
us, who proved to he a kind friend's servant, coming to meet us and
assist us in any way he could; and as he was a clever "bushman,"
and a most useful intelligent fellow, we were right glad of his
addition to our party.</p>

<p>By the time we arrived in sight of a lonely stock-hut, supposed
to be six miles from our future residence, the sun set; and as to
drive in the dark through the standing forest and over the
prostrate one was a sheer impossibility, it had been determined to
leave the car here, in the care of our old servant and his gun,
until the morning, and make our way on in the dark on horseback.
Our new ally, "Sydney Bill," led the way, and kindly volunteered to
take charge of the baby, who had at last wearied of his jolting
journey, and for some time had cried piteously; but his new
rough-looking nurse held him so tenderly, and the walk of the quiet
horse was so much more easy a motion than the unequal one of the
car, that the poor weary child went quietly to sleep for the
remainder of the journey, and worthy "Bill" won my enduring
thankfulness. Mr. Meredith took George before him, on his fine tall
horse, and rode next in the cavalcade; I followed, and the maid and
boy, mounted on the tandem horses, closed the procession. We
proceeded in "Indian file," endeavouring to keep on the narrow
track of little more than a foot wide, which was all the road our
bush-route displayed.</p>

<p>In the forest the usual half twilight is after sunset so rapidly
changed to perfect darkness, that my somewhat short-sighted eyes
soon lost Mr. Meredith, whose dark horse and dark clothes were
undistinguishable to me from the rest of the palpable gloom around;
and I several times got off the track until I sent the groom on
before me, and as the horse he rode was a light gray, I could then
just discern a patch of something less black than the surrounding
inky void, moving ahead, which I followed with literally blind
confidence. Every now and then my husband's voice reached me,
giving some direction or warning; sometimes sounding from below,
crying, "Mind this steep gully! When at the bottom, keep to the
right for a few paces, then turn to the left, or you will be in the
bog!"</p>

<p>A little farther on came another mud-hollow, and with it the
good advice, not easy to follow in the dark, "Keep in the middle
here!&mdash;there are deep holes on both sides!"</p>

<p>Shortly after, a quick, sharp "coo-ee!" and "Stoop your head
well&mdash;here are some very low branches to go under," and as I could
not possibly know the exact whereabout of these treacherous boughs,
I lay almost with my face on the horse's neck, till the next order
arrived from head-quarters, with directions for the mastery of some
new difficulty.</p>

<p>I soon learned to trust more to the sagacity of my good horse
than to my own inferior instinct, and, in some way or another, he
scrambled safely through all the gullies, and jumped well over all
the innumerable logs; and as I could not see one of them, my ride
was altogether a series of surprises and mystifications, which
would have been amusing enough, had I felt less weary; but I had
been ten hours on horseback, tiresomely creeping at a foot pace,
and had become so thoroughly chilled, cramped, and drowsy, as to be
scarcely capable of feeling the reins in my hand, and began to fear
that I should drop off my horse before we arrived at our
destination.</p>

<p>Sometimes, looking straight upwards, I could catch a passing
glimpse of a few bright stars, showing that anywhere but in the
horrible forest it was a fair clear night; but whilst we were
buried in that waste of wood, groping our way like the explorers of
some subterraneous world, we were shut out, or rather shut in, from
all cheering skyey influences. I scarcely know anything more
thoroughly wearisome, both to mind and body, than a slow progress
through these dreary dark forests, with their huge, tall, gaunt,
bare, half-dead trees, standing around you in apparently the same
hideous skeleton shapes, however far you go; as different from the
verdant, leafy, shadowy depths of an English wood as a decaying
misshapen skeleton is from a perfect human form in vigorous
life.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the loud barking of several dogs came most pleasantly
upon our ears, and in a few more paces a span of starry sky opened
out before us, and the outline of some building was visible.</p>

<p>"Here we are at last!" cried my husband, but it seemed unlikely
we should be there long, for half a dozen immense dogs were raging
round us, apparently only discussing who should be eaten up first,
until their master, our valuable assistant "Bill," called them off,
and we reached the garden gate of our new domicile. The poor
children, both fast asleep, were quickly carried in, beside a good
fire, and I followed as soon as I could walk, for, on first
alighting from my horse, I was too much cramped with cold to
stand.</p>

<p>The good bachelor friend from whom Mr. Meredith had rented the
cottage (and our friend Bill's estimable master) having kindly left
us his furniture until some of our own should arrive, we managed
admirably, making children's beds of car cushions, cloaks, &amp;c.;
nothing seemed worth thinking a trouble or annoyance, now that our
difficult and weary journey was safely over.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-10" id="ch2-10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">General Sketch of
"Lath Hall."&mdash;Cockatooers.&mdash;Poverty at Port
Sorell.&mdash;Potatoes.&mdash;Port Sorell Horse-keeping.&mdash;Fences.&mdash;Dutch
Barns.&mdash;Model Stables.&mdash;Police Station.&mdash;Pleasant Sea
View.&mdash;"Clarissa."&mdash;Cottage Sites.</p>

<p>I was somewhat curious, the next morning, to judge for myself of
the situation of our new dwelling, after the very unfavourable
accounts Mr. Meredith had given me, but I found his descriptions
most faithful. The cottage occupied the top of a slight slope,
which was so far cleared that the chief of the great trees had been
cut down, but not cut up, and the enormous dead trunks, lying over
and under and across each other, made a most melancholy foreground
to the everlasting forest, which bounded the narrow view on all
sides, like a high dense screen. Two avenues, which had been cut
through it in front of the house, gave distant peeps of two other
cottages on two other slopes, and gum-trees again, behind. No one
who has any regard for health would, I should think, venture to
live in the hollows or flats of the forest, which seem the very
strongholds of ague, miasma, and all the other pleasant progeny of
swampy woods.</p>

<p>From the back of the house, the close dense forest was the only
view; so close, that any one looking for sky from the kitchen door
must gaze up to the zenith for it! Altogether, as may well be
imagined, our new home was not a cheerful one in its external
characteristics; and we soon found it to be exceedingly damp
throughout, and very cold. The walls were built of upright "slabs,"
that is to say, of thick pieces of rough split timber, six or seven
inches broad, two or three inches thick, and about nine feet high,
fastened to logs at the bottom, and wall-plates at the top. These
slabs were lathed and thinly plastered within, and lathed, but not
plastered, without; whence, as the cottage had no name, I bestowed
upon it the sobriquet of "Lath Hall." The slabs were in many places
some inches apart, and the inside plaster displayed multitudes of
capacious crevices, which enabled the external air to keep up a
friendly and frequent communication with that within. Five doors
and a French window, all opening into our only parlour, were not
calculated to diminish the airiness of the apartment.</p>

<p>By suspending a thick curtain across one recess, we screened off
three doors at once; and another curtain hung over another door,
excluded a copious volume of wind from an opposite corner.</p>

<p>Fortunately, fire-wood was abundant, and our liberal use of it
in every room which possessed a hearth contributed not a little to
clear the near portions of the forest of masses of dead wood.</p>

<p>The instalment of our household goods which had been sent
overland to Launceston safely reached us in about a fortnight after
our own arrival, and the main body in some weeks afterwards, but in
a most deplorable condition&mdash;broken, dismembered, and destroyed;
casks of well-packed china and glass produced little besides
fragments, and all the furniture was maimed, wounded, and
disfigured for life. We found, on inquiry, that when the goods were
put on board the vessel engaged to convey them from Swan Port to
Launceston, her captain and crew were all alike intoxicated, and
tumbled our unlucky goods pell-mell into the vessel's hold; and
hence the serious and very annoying loss we suffered.</p>

<p>"Lath Hall" being about five miles inland from the police office
and township on the shore of Port Sorell, I took an early
opportunity of accompanying Mr. Meredith in one of his daily rides
thither, to see what manner of place the coast of our new district
might be, for I certainly was not enamoured of the inland portion I
had seen. Our way lay through the forest, dark, dismal, and dreary
as ever, for about three miles; the only variety of scene was
afforded by a few wretched-looking huts and hovels, the dwellings
of "cockatobers," who are not, as it might seem, a species of bird,
but human beings, who rent portions of this forest from the
proprietors or their mortgagees, on exorbitant terms, and vainly
endeavour to exist on what they can earn besides, their frequent
compulsory abstinence from meat, when they cannot afford to buy it,
even in this laud of cheap and abundant food, giving them some
affinity to the grain-eating white cockatoos.</p>

<p>The mere clearing off the timber from such land usually costs at
least 10 an acre, and the impracticability of a man without
capital clearing it, paying rent for it all the while, and
maintaining himself and family till the crop comes in, is too
evident to any rational mind to need a comment.</p>

<p>The common course is this:&mdash;Some industrious servant who has
saved a few pounds from his wages, if he has been so unusually
fortunate in this peculiar district as to receive his earnings, or
a man with a little money and farm stock, blindly agrees to pay a
high annual rent for a piece of dense forest, covered with the
heaviest timber, the land itself being of the richest description.
With a large portion of his small capital, he builds a hut for his
family, and then goes on clearing a field for the plough. Meantime,
nothing is coming in, and money for food constantly going out;
rent-day comes round, and if the remaining savings are enough, they
pay the rent; if not, the cart, plough, or bullocks must go as
well. The coming crop is offered as security for other inevitable
debts, and is swept off when harvested, leaving only the promise of
the next to carry on the work with until it comes; and when it
does, in all probability the demands exceed the receipts; the sad
finale being that the wretched family goes forth again, bereft of
every shilling they possessed, and the place where their all lies
buried is let as an "improved property" to some other adventurer at
an advanced rental. Until I came into the district of Port Sorell,
I could not conceive such poverty as I saw there, to be possible in
this land of plenteousness; nor is there, I imagine, in the whole
island a similarly-conditioned neighbourhood. It was something
quite new again to me, to find the poor people around us thankful
for any victuals or other little helps we could give them, such as
our comfortable small settlers of Swan Port would have scorned to
accept had they been offered. One poor industrious man near us
declared afterwards that the scraps of meat and rusty bacon,
&amp;c., he had from our kitchen were all he had to eat during one
winter, except some cabbages from his garden; every saleable kind
of produce, such as wheat, potatoes, &amp;c., having gone in part
payment of his debts and rent. As compared with the extremities of
famine recently suffered by thousands of our miserable
fellow-creatures in Ireland and England, a winter's subsistence on
cabbages may not appear to merit much commiseration; but here,
where good fresh meat sells for twopence or twopence-halfpenny a
pound, and is used thrice a day in every labourer's or shepherd's
hut, besides tea and sugar, and abundance of good wheaten bread,
vegetable diet is felt as an unusual hardship.</p>

<p>Much of the penury of Port Sorell may he traced to the high
price which was obtained for potatoes some few years ago. Those
persons who cultivated them in this district sold their crops one
year for 10 and 12 per ton, and as the produce varies from six to
ten tons an acre, according to soil and aspect, the simple people
fancied they had nothing further to do but plant and dig potatoes,
and count gold, (if indeed such gains as they expected <i>could</i>
be counted!) not taking into consideration the possibility of a
depreciation of prices. Lavish expenditure in clearing,
cultivating, and building was rapidly made; little estates were
mortgaged beyond their value, for funds to carry on the
improvements; and, after the whole small population of the
neighbourhood had become deeply involved in the fatal potato
speculation, prices sank, more rapidly even than they had risen,
and, instead of 12, the faithless root fetched only 5<i>s</i>. or
10<i>s</i>. the ton. At the period of our residence at Lath Hall,
they were deemed scarcely worth even carriage. Horses and pigs were
fed on them, and some scores of cart-loads, stored in an inclosure
on one side of the cottage we occupied, were deemed worthless, and
left there to perish, until the insufferable odour arising from
their putrescence compelled us to require their removal.</p>

<p>On Mr. Meredith's first arrival in the district, he one day
called at the cottage of a settler, who very civilly inquired,
"Would you like your horse put in the stable, Mr. Meredith?"</p>

<p>"No, I thank you," was the reply, "he will do quite well where I
left him."</p>

<p>"Then," rejoined Mr. Smith, "shall I send him a few
potatoes?"</p>

<p>Such an extraordinary suggestion as offering a dish of potatoes
to a horse seemed very like a quiz; but the grave earnestness of
the querist proved his perfect sincerity, and, on inquiry, Mr.
Meredith was duly initiated into the Port Sorell style of
horse-keeping; a bucket of small raw washed potatoes being as usual
a "feed" there, as a "quartern of oats" at Home, and the animals
seem to relish and thrive on them.</p>

<p>And now to return to our cockatooers' farms, from which the
great potato question has too long detained me. Four or five of
these little excavations in the forest lay near our route to the
beach; each with its one or two small patches of cultivation,
surrounded by the forest wall (like a child's garden of a foot
square, with a paling a yard high), and a low dilapidated hut and
some hovels, usually crouching in one corner of the clearing,
shadowed from all but a vertical sun by the gigantic tree-barrier
around.</p>

<p>In a place where timber of the best descriptions for sawing or
splitting is so superabundant as it is here, we should expect to
see particularly good fences, as, if the labour of making posts and
rails were too expensive, a perfect rampart of a dead-wood fence
might be erected with ease, and the advantage of saving labour in
clearing the ground: but the common fences all through Port Sorell
would convey the idea that timber was an almost unattainable
article; for, save in one or two instances, I rarely saw any but
the most deplorable imitations of brush fences ever attempted, and
as these are no defence against the inroads of cattle on the
growing corn, perpetual disputes and bickerings arise, which a
little good fencing would wholly prevent. Undoubtedly, uncertain
tenure and small gains tend not a little to such negligence in
tenants, but the proprietors are scarcely better farmers
themselves.</p>

<p>At one time I engaged a "cockatooer's" wife in the neighbourhood
to come to our house two days in the week, to wash and iron, and
gave her 5<i>s</i>. each time and her board; but she shortly sent
me word she could not come again, as she must stop at home to keep
the cattle off the wheat. A day or two after, I had the curiosity
to go and look at the fence of their field. It consisted of a few
boughs of shrubs laid on the ground, varying from a few inches to
two feet in height, and at intervals forked sticks were stuck up
with long thin "tea-tree" poles, like fishing-rods, resting in the
forks, and these by no means continuous. It would not have kept a
sheep out, in any one place, far less resist the determination and
strength of half-wild cattle. Yet these people were content to
plough and sow, and then leave their crop with no defence but the
vigilance of an old woman; whilst a couple of men and a team of
oxen would in less than a week put such a wall of logs round it as
should be impregnable for years, and had this been done, I need not
have lost my washerwoman, nor she her wages.</p>

<p>The majority of the barns in the district exhibit an equal
economy of timber and industry. The most popular are denominated
Dutch barns, and consist of a roof, supported on posts, with the
sides and ends open. I have also seen stables there, constructed in
the same style, but with the spaces between the posts walled up
with heaps of manure two or three feet thick! The least tidy kind
of rough wall I have observed in any other part of the colony has
been "wattle and dab," or turf at the least; it remained for the
ingenious indolence of Port Sorell to invent this odoriferous
composite order of rural architecture.</p>

<p>Some few bits of the forest scenery on our way to the beach
were, from being less dense, much more pleasing than the rest,
especially where magnificent lightwoods, rich in colour and
foliage, and the symmetrical native cherry trees
(<i>Exocarpus</i>), in their close massive cypress-like shape, and
full deep-shaded green hue, made pleasant pictures amongst the more
dreary realities of the eternal <i>Eucalyptus</i> trunks above, and
the harsh olive green ferns below. A few flowers appeared here and
there, seeming rather like things gone astray from a fairer home,
than constant dwellers beneath the dark gum-tree trunks.</p>

<p>After passing one or two swampy plains tolerably bare of
trees&mdash;crossing "Muddy Creek," a clear fresh-water rivulet in a
deep hollow&mdash;and descending the next hill, a most welcome line of
blue water appeared over the distant trees, and we entered a more
open country of undulating grass land, with belts and groups of
leafy trees scattered about, more like a Swan Port sheep-run, than
the Port Sorell forest; and soon we reached the police station, the
situation of which seemed to me singularly beautiful, after our
forest-den, commanding a view of the calm blue waters of the port,
its pretty rocky islets, and long wooded points, with the open sea
(Bass's Straits) beyond, bounded on the east by the beautiful range
of the Asbestus Mountains, and on the west by the West Head of Port
Sorell, and Carbuncle Island (usually rendered Cary-bunckle). Two
or three little vessels, including my odoriferous friends of the
Launceston wharf, lay at anchor in the port. The name of one of
these was for some time a problem to us: first we heard of a
package come for us by the "Clara Say;" then the name changed to
the "Clara Say oh!" and then into the "Claret Sea," which in due
time was absorbed in the "Pharisee," an odd name for an honest
little schooner, we thought, until a sight of her stern-board
announced to us that she bore, in reality, the soft and romantic
appellation of "Clarissa!" Nor is Port Sorell alone ingenious in
such distortions: I have known the "Sesostris" spoken of as the
"Sea Ostrich;" the "Vansittart" transformed to the "Fancy Tart;"
and a man in New Zealand being ordered to name a vessel the
"Crocodile,"actually painted, launched, and registered her as the
"Crooked Eye!"</p>

<p>A boat, pulling swiftly out to one of the vessels, and numerous
flocks of gulls and red-bills busily flying to and fro, or fishing
in the shallows, added just enough of life and motion to the calm
glorious view and the bright clear sunshine, which in itself was
reviving and comforting, after the watery vapoury kind of twinkle
which reached our forest gloom. I sunned myself delightfully on the
sandy beach, till Mr. Meredith's business was over, and then we
visited three different spots, which he had thought of as pleasant
sites for our own cottage. The first was a natural terrace, with a
conical hill behind, commanding at high water a fine view of the
port, and with good fresh water in the vicinity; but at low tide,
the view chiefly consisted of reedy mud-flats and sand-banks, which
was not pleasant. The second spot was most beautiful; a rocky but
well-sheltered and woody point, with a view both of the port and
its islands, and the open sea; with the Asbestus Mountains
opposite; everything in point of beauty, but deficient in the
requisite of fresh water,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"Water, water, everywhere,<br>
But not a drop to drink."</p>

<p>And our miserable experience of drought in New South Wales made
us especially covetous of an abundant supply. Reluctantly, we rode
away to the third selected point. This was a prominent corner of a
natural terrace, which we had traced along for some distance, close
to a running stream of good water, and with as lovely a view as
from the spot we had last left, although as yet only seen by
glimpses through the great trees; but we fully appreciated the
capabilities of the place, and decided that there we would erect
our cottage, as soon as the land could be officially surveyed for
the Government, the allotments advertised in the Government
Gazette, and purchased at the public sale, all which involved an
inevitable delay of some months.</p>

<p>Wooden houses are built with such rapidity that we hoped to
remove into ours within a year, including all expected hindrances;
but even that seemed a long time to live so completely "under the
shade of melancholy boughs."</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Our New
Neighbours.&mdash;Golden Rule for Ladies.&mdash;Touchstone and
Audrey.&mdash;Veterinary Conversation.&mdash;Excursions.&mdash;Walk to the
"Sisters."&mdash;Sea-Birds.&mdash;Pelicans and Porpoises, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of our new district were highly delighted at
having their frequent prayers for a resident police magistrate at
length granted, and the full measure of popularity was accorded to
him; whilst I was enabled to judge of the degree of reflected
lustre which I enjoyed, by the number of calls which succeeded my
arrival: by the time these complimentary visits were over, and in
due order returned, I had grown quite weary of answering the same
questions over and over again. I soon discovered that, although we
had a more numerous list of <i>visitors</i> than at Swan Port, we
had not gained in point of <i>society</i>.</p>

<p>All the residents were farmers, of greater or less degree, and
all "esquires," if not in their own right, by their own assertion,
which was often very amusing, and, for all common purposes, did as
well. In America, military titles seem the especial ambition of the
shop-keeping and agricultural classes, and "majors," "colonels,"
and "generals" abound on all sides; but in our peaceful island, all
such redundant ambition tends towards one point of glory, and
"esquire" is the coveted and demanded distinction, <i>asked
for</i>, when not accorded without, and now so universally applied,
that its omission will soon begin to be the really honourable
distinction of a colonial gentleman.</p>

<p>One crying fault of the "ladies" prevails far more in colonial
than in English society&mdash;I allude to that most absurd fallacy,
which seems to imagine that a lady ought to be discovered by any
chance visitor, at any hour of the day, fully arrayed in her newest
attire, and in a state of smartness and precision as regards
flounces, ribbons, and collars, which is wholly and utterly
incompatible with any kind of domestic occupation or duty
whatsoever.</p>

<p>Now the prevalence of this monstrous belief is productive of
many evils; not the least of which is, the delay which almost
invariably takes place in the appearance of the ladies of any
family on whom one calls in the country; and the period allotted
for a friendly chat thus passes in a dreary survey of a formal
drawing-room, or in constrained talk with the unhappy master of the
house, who is in a fidget of anxiety and impatience at the absence
of wife and daughters. Thus, unless we determine to let our own
dinner spoil, or to omit some other intended visit, we are
compelled to take leave in five minutes after the entrance of our
fair friends, whose recently-smoothed hair, horizontally-folded
dresses, and red damp hands, attest with painful certainty the
trouble which our kindly-intended call has occasioned them.</p>

<p>I know I am on dangerous ground, and that I might almost as
safely "patter in a hornet's nest," as show myself so manifestly a
traitor in the camp; yet a little exposure of such follies ofttimes
effects so much improvement, that I do not hesitate to take my
share of responsibility in the attempt. The golden rule by which
all such troublesome transformations may be rendered unnecessary
is, of course, to avoid ever being untidy or slatternly, let our
occupation be what it may.</p>

<p>My own criterion of propriety in every-day dress is a very
simple one. Of all persons living, I consider my husband to merit
my first and chiefest respect; and if my attire is such as I deem
neat and proper to be worn in <i>his</i> presence, I do not think I
ought to suppose it unfit to appear in before indifferent people or
strangers. And it seems to me far more pleasant to imagine one's
lady-friends notably busy in a morning, as good country housewives
must be and are, than to conceive such useless impossibilities as
ladies (some of whom in this place, I know, keep no female servant)
dressed in new silks or muslins at noon, and seated on a sofa,
doing nothing! To my simple notions, the latter is intensely
contemptible, whilst the former is right and respectable; and
whatever may be thought of my heretical opinion by my fair
acquaintances themselves, I am quite sure that the husbands,
fathers, and brothers, are all on my side of the question.</p>

<p>The children, too! such an expenditure of soap and hair-oil as
is deemed indispensable before they can be introduced to strangers!
and then ten to one but the poor innocents put their mamma in an
agony by instantly informing you that "This is my best frock!" or
that "Bobby mustn't come in, he's dirty!" Whereas, if no attempt
were made to make things appear finer than they really are, all
this vexation would be spared, and the pleasant little dirt-pie or
pebble-pudding which the little party were happily discussing,
would proceed without interruption.</p>

<p>One of our neighbouring "esquires"one day asked Mr. Meredith
what he called the horse he was then riding; he replied, "Oh, this
is Touchstone, and that," pointing to mine, "is Audrey."</p>

<p>"Ah!" rejoined the querist thoughtfully&mdash;"Yes, I see;
Touch-stone&mdash;oh, yes, he <i>does</i> touch the stones, to be sure,
but still I think Top-log would have been better, for he's a rare
one to leap!"</p>

<p>Our unlucky <i>penchant</i> for classical or Shakespearian names
for favourite horses or dogs, often led to a similar display of
incorrigible innocence in our acquaintance, very few of our Port
Sorell friends being literary characters. A lady, whilst looking
over a scrap-book, with which I had essayed to amuse her during
part of a dreary visit, appealed to me for some explanation of one
of Liverseege's exquisite Shakespeare scenes which passed her
comprehension, and I began trying to <i>remind</i> her of the
situation it represented, by a rough sketch of the well-known
characters and locality of the play; but she woefully checked my
valuable illustrations by exclaiming; "Oh, no, indeed, I don't
remember anything about it; I never read Shakespeare, I never
could."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, some local matter became the topic of
conversation, and, thinking that was perhaps a more congenial
theme, I addressed a common-place remark to my fair guest as to her
opinion of the affair; but was again repulsed and reproved by "I
don't know, indeed, I never trouble <i>my</i> head with reading
newspapers; I've something else to do." The very truth being, as I
opine, that such heads pass through life in the enjoyment of almost
absolute sinecures.</p>

<p>I was sometimes rather startled by the very <i>veterinary</i>
character of the conversation prevalent among some few young and
(otherwise) lady-like women of our acquaintance. Good and fearless
horse-women themselves, their whole delight seemed to be in the
discussion of matters pertaining to the stable; and when meeting
any young lady friend from a distance, the first questions were not
enquiries after parents, sisters, brothers, or friends: no, nor
even the lady-beloved talk of weddings and dress; but the discourse
almost invariably took a "turfy" turn, that was, to say the least,
unfeminine in the extreme.</p>

<p>As the swampy road between "Lath Hall" and the port became
tolerably hard in summer, we frequently drove down with the
children, to pass the day on the sea beach, both as a great treat
and a sanitary measure also; for we felt how impossible it must be
to live long in that dark dank place, surrounded with such masses
of growing and decaying vegetable matter, without the children, at
least, feeling the injurious effects. The perceptible change in the
atmosphere as we left the forest was always striking. On a cool
day, the air around our cottage was damp and chilly, on a warm one,
close and oppressive, and always seemed heavy, as if vapour-laden;
but as soon as we emerged from the woods upon the open land, the
fresh light sea-breeze brought us new life and vigour; the very act
of breathing was a pleasant sensation, and we all heartily enjoyed
our little excursions.</p>

<p>One day we had established the children and the maid in a nice
rocky nook under some lovely box-trees (a species of our tribe of
myrtles), where George could either pick shells or pull flowers,
or, what children still more delight in, scoop up "mountains" of
sand on the broad smooth beach; and as the water was at its lowest
ebb, Mr. Meredith and I determined to walk across to one of the
islands called the "Sisters," which we had often wistfully gazed at
from the shore.</p>

<p>The lovely beach we mostly frequented formed at high water the
margin of a bright bay, nestled amidst rocks and wooded banks; but
the tide receded so far that, at low water, an expanse of hard
sand, nearly half a mile broad, was left bare and dry, and
apparently extended to the islands, whither we boldly directed our
course; but, as we approached, a broad deep channel became visible,
lying between us and our goal. Skirting it round for some distance,
we found a shallow place, scarcely ankle deep, and, resolving not
to be so lightly foiled in our purpose, began to step across it,
when we found ourselves on a quicksand, and had to be tolerably
active to get safe through. Once on the island, objects of interest
abounded. Sea-birds in flocks were around us; gray and white gulls
uttering their plaintive cry overhead, as they floated along with
one bright eye bent upon us; busy merry redbills, circling us round
and round, repeating their sharp impatient notes; swift-footed
little sand-larks skimming rapidly over the beach, like gray and
white balls, whirled along in succession; and grand demure
ponderous pelicans, in their silvery white and raven gray plumage,
sitting asleep, or standing like statues on the broad smooth sands.
Silently and stealthily we stepped nearer and nearer to see them
better; but our curiosity&mdash;as curiosity so often does&mdash;defeated its
own object, and aroused the pelicans to a full belief of their
peril in allowing us to advance so far. Their process of taking
flight was to me exceedingly droll; they began by making a short
jump on both feet, then another, and another, and another, each
jump becoming longer and higher, and their wings becoming gradually
expanded, till they finally bounded up from the ground and soared
away; and to see eight or ten of these immense birds hopping along
in this measured and deliberate style, with their grave and
imposing aspect and long pouched bills, was the most comic piece of
solemnity I ever witnessed.</p>

<p>After the pelicans took flight, a shoal of porpoises came
floundering by, plunging and splashing most delightfully; then we
went prying amongst the crevices of the rocks, and in the clear
pools, gazing at the myriads of beautiful starfish and
<i>Echini</i>, and heedlessly scrambling over the sea-weedy crags
in search of oysters, until a chance look towards the shore showed
us the returning tide flowing rapidly in, and our retreat almost
cut off; but by instantly decamping, and fording our quicksand
channel, then considerably above a foot deep, we escaped all harm
save a good wetting, and by the time we had walked to the car, and
were ready to drive home, my somewhat mermaidish garments had
become nearly dry in the sun and wind.</p>

Ferns.&mdash;Natural Temple.&mdash;The Tallow-tree.&mdash;Sassafras.&mdash;Mischances

<p>Mr. Meredith used often to make long explorations in the
neighbourhood of our cottage, sometimes to shoot ducks or a
kangaroo, and as frequently merely for a new walk. One day he
returned with such an armful of beautiful shrubs and ferns, and
such exciting accounts of the singularly beautiful spots where he
found them, that I waited impatiently for his first leisure day,
that I might go with him into the new and wondrous world he had
discovered, and see its treasures growing there.</p>

<p>Accordingly on the first opportunity we set forth; we rode on
horseback for two miles of forest, and then arriving at a "scrub,"
so thick and close that our horses could go no further, we left
them with the servant, and proceeded on foot. We soon struck into a
cattle path, which was a beaten though very narrow track underfoot,
and so far a passage above, that the shrubs gave way on being
pushed, but instantly closed again. Long pendulous streamers of
tangled gray lichen hung like enormous beards from the trees, and
on horizontal branches formed perfect curtains of some feet in
depth. Funguses of all kinds protruded from the dead, damp, mossy
logs and gigantic fallen trees that lay in our path, and the deep
soft beds of accumulated decaying leaves and bark that one's feet
sank into were damp and spongy, and chill, even on a warm summer
day.</p>

<p>The nettles of this colony are the most formidable I have ever
encountered, both in size and venom, and in this primeval scrub
they flourished in undisturbed luxuriance, often rising far above
our heads, and forming quite a tree-like growth, armed with a
fierce array of poisoned spears, with which they ruthlessly
attacked my arms and ankles; a thin print dress being a poor
defence against their sharp and most painful stings, from which I
suffered severely for some days after this scramble. A friend of
ours once rode after some cattle into a mass of these nettles,
which spread over a large space of ground. His horse became so
infuriated by the pain of the nettle-stings, that he threw himself
down amongst them to roll, which of course increased the poor
animal's torture, and his master could neither lead nor drive him
out; the creature was rendered mad and furious by pain, and in a
short time died in convulsions.</p>

<p>Our cattle-track at length brought us into the enchanted valley
Mr. Meredith had discovered, and not in my most fantastic
imaginings had I ever pictured to myself anything so exquisitely
beautiful! We were in a world of fern-trees, some palm-like and of
gigantic size, others quite juvenile; some tall and erect as the
columns of a temple, others bending into an arch, or springing up
in diverging groups, leaning in all directions; their
wide-spreading feathery crowns forming half-transparent green
canopies, that folded and waved together in many places so closely
that only a span of blue sky could peep down between them, to
glitter on the bright sparkling rivulet that tumbled and foamed
along over mossy rocks, and under fantastic natural log bridges,
and down into dark mysterious channels that no eye could trace out,
under those masses of fern trunks and broad green feathers
overarching it; and all around, far above the tallest ferns, huge
forest trees soared up aloft, throwing their great arms about in a
gale that was blowing up there, whilst scarcely a breath lifted the
lightest feather of the ferns below; all was calm and silent beside
us, save the pleasant music of the rivulet, and the tiny chirping
of some bright little birds, flitting about amongst the
underwood.</p>

<p>I had brought my sketch-book, and although despairing of
success, sat down under a fern-canopy to attempt an outline of some
of the whimsical groups before me, whilst Mr. Meredith and Dick
went to look for a kangaroo, the former giving me the needless
caution not to wander about, lest I should be lost, a catastrophe
for which I seem to possess a natural aptitude in the "Bush."</p>

<p>I soon relinquished my pencil, and shut my book, half in disgust
at my own presumption in attempting for an instant a subject so far
beyond my poor abilities; and, fastening my handkerchief to the
trunk of my canopy fern-tree, I ventured to make short excursions
from it on all sides, taking care not to go out of sight of the
handkerchief. Sometimes I could go as much as ten yards, but this
was in the clearest place; generally the view closed in about five
or six.</p>

<p>The stems of the fern-trees here varied from six to twenty or
thirty feet high, and from eight inches diameter to two or three
feet; their external substance being a dark-coloured, thick, soft,
fibrous, mat-like bark, frequently netted over with the most
delicate little ferns, growing on it parasitically. One species of
these creeping ferns had long winding stems, so tough and strong
that I could rarely break them, and waving polished leaves, not
unlike harts-tongue, but narrower. These wreathed round and round
the mossy columns of the fern-trees like living garlands, and the
wondrously-elegant stately crown-canopy of feathers (from twelve to
eighteen feet long) springing from the summit, bent over in a
graceful curve all around, as evenly and regularly as the ribs of a
parasol.</p>

<p>Whilst making one of my cautious six-yard tours, a fine brush
kangaroo came by me, and was instantly out of sight again; and then
I heard a whistle, which I answered by a "<i>coo</i>-ee" and Dick
soon bounded to me, followed by his master. We then shared our
sandwiches with the little birds and the ants and drank of the
bright cool rivulet, and again went on exploring. In one place we
found a perfect living model of an ancient vaulted crypt, such as I
have seen in old churches or castles, or beneath St. Mary's Hall in
Coventry. We stood in a large level space, devoid of grass or any
kind of undergrowth, but strewn with fern leaflets like a thick,
soft, even mat. Hundreds&mdash;perhaps thousands&mdash;of fern-trees grew
here, of nearly uniform size, and at equal distances, all straight
and erect as chiselled pillars, and, springing from their living
capitals, the long, arching, thick-ribbed fern-leaves spread forth
and mingled densely overhead in a groined roof of the daintiest
beauty, through which not a ray of light gleamed down, the solemn
twilight of the place strangely suiting with its almost sacred
character. Openings between the outer columns seemed like arched
doors and windows seen through the "long-drawn aisle," and stray
gleams of sunshine falling across them were faintly reflected on
the fretted vault above us.</p>

<p>Danby <i>might</i> paint the scene; or perhaps one of
Cattermole's wondrous water-colour pictures done on the spot might
convey some tolerable idea of its form and colouring, but a mere
slight sketch were wholly useless.</p>

<p>After reluctantly leaving our temple in the wilderness, we
wandered some time longer amidst the grand and beautiful scenes
around, and I made a collection of small ferns and other plants new
to me.</p>

<p>We noticed one very ornamental shrub, usually known as the
"Tallow-tree" (from the viscous greasy pulp of the berries),
growing here very abundantly, and in great luxuriance; but every
one we found was growing out of a fern-tree, the foster-parent in
most cases appearing exhausted and withering, whilst the nursling
throve most vigorously. It seemed, generally, as if a seed had
lodged in the soft fibrous rind of the fern-tree, and had sprung up
into a tall, strong, erect stem, at the same time sending out
downward shoots, that eventually struck into the earth; but we
could not find one plant growing in and out of the earth, although
I am aware that the tree is not always a parasite. Many of the
stems were a foot through, and their great, coiling, snaky
root-shoots clasped about the poor old hoary fern-trees. These
tyrant parasites are very handsome. with rich, dark green, glossy
leaves, and red blossoms, succeeded by most brilliant
orange-coloured berries, which, when ripe, split open, and the case
flying back partially displays the bright red cluster of seeds
within, like a little pomegranate with an orange-peel husk.</p>

<p>The beautiful Tasmanian sassafras-tree is also a dweller in some
parts of our fern-tree valley, but not in those we explored on the
present occasion. The flowers are white and fragrant, the leaves
large and bright green, and the bark has a most aromatic scent,
besides being, in a decoction, an excellent tonic medicine. The
wood is hard and white, with scarcely any visible grain, but is
marked or shaded with light brown in irregular occasional streaks.
Thinking that it must partake the pleasant fragrance of its bark, I
procured some to make boxes of, but found it quite devoid of scent
after the bark was removed. A block of it furnished Mr. Meredith
with an excellent material for a beautiful toy sailing-boat, which
he carved out of it for George; and the fine, close, velvety
texture of the wood seems admirably adapted for carving of any
kind. The sawyers and other bush-men familiar with the tree call it
indiscriminately "saucifax," "sarserfrax," and "satisfaction."</p>

<p>We found no small difficulty in getting out of our vale of
enchantment; indeed, I began to think that, having really forced an
entrance into Fairy Land, the wicked sprites had bewitched us, so
that we must perforce remain there. No returning cattle-track could
be discovered, the scrub was too dense to observe the position of
the sun, and its unbroken entanglement was most fatiguing to force
one's way through. Several times we took a wrong direction, and,
after a long combat with briars and nettles, were forced to "try
back" again. The heat and oven-like closeness of the air were most
depressing to strength and spirits, and once or twice I sank down
almost exhausted; but after a brief rest I grew more resolute, and
pushed on after my husband.</p>

<p>The impossibility of seeing what was beneath our feet caused me
to suffer many unwelcome surprises, by stumbling over logs, falling
into holes, and like mischances; but at length we succeeded in
scrambling once again into light and sunshine, and very thankfully
mounted our horses and rode home, the pleasure of our day's
exploring having so immeasurably overbalanced the fatigue, that I
promised myself several more pilgrimages to the same shrine, which,
alas, were never performed.</p>

<p>I never saw the lovely native clematis growing so luxuriantly as
among the Fort Sorell forests. There, over the universal
undergrowth of ferns, this beautiful climber often spread over a
space many feet broad and long, in a richly-woven mantle of leaf
and flower, or, clinging to some slender tree, formed a tangled
covering all over it, with long starry chaplets waving about. The
bright blue <i>Comesperma</i> was equally abundant, but its abode
was usually in drier and more open places.</p>

<p>Myriads of strangely-shaped orchidaceous flowers bloomed in all
situations, and included various species of yellow and brown
<i>Diuris</i>, lilac, pink, and blue kaladenias, various in form as
in colour; and one very eccentric individual of the orchis family,
with a very long dark-brown lower lip, in the centre of which rose
a large protuberance like a nose. I have shown my drawing of it to
many persons, but none had ever seen the plant, or could tell me
its name. I also found three varieties of a singular green orchis,
of a helmet-shape, growing singly, on rather tall slender
footstalks. One of these had a long feather-like appendage
protruding from the opening in front.</p>

<p>A beautiful shrub, with flowers and leaves very much resembling
the laburnum, formed thickets in some of the damp hollows near us,
and many other ornamental shrubs abounded, whilst ferntrees were
plentiful near most of the rivulets; but, though very Oriental and
palm-like in their aspect, they were not comparable, in point of
beauty or magnitude, with those of our charmed dell.</p>

Eagle.&mdash;White Hawk.&mdash;White Cockatoos.&mdash;Superb Warblers'
Nest.&mdash;Strange Insect.&mdash;Venomous Guests.&mdash;Burning Trees.&mdash;Stinging
Ants.&mdash;Flies.&mdash;Wood Tick.</p>

<p>Few varieties of birds enlivened our forest gloom; the most
numerous were the crows and black magpies; but none of the
sweetly-singing pied magpies are seen nearer Port Sorell than the
Avenue Plain; and much as I missed my pleasant merry friends, I
could not but applaud their taste in frequenting any part of the
island rather than this most dreary and disagreeable district.</p>

<p>Now and then, two, three, or four lordly eagles might be seen
soaring grandly high overhead at the same time, and once we saw as
many as seven together, and marvelled much what so grave an augury
portended. As all things edible were scarce in the vicinity, we
sometimes thought that our goats, with their young kids, might
possibly attract the attention of the eagles; but I must freely
exonerate them from all charge of theft&mdash;they never molested any of
our live stock. I cannot give an equally good character to their
disreputable kinsfolk, the hawks, who were bolder and more
rapacious than any I had seen before, coming and sitting quite
composedly on the very hen-house itself, and swooping into the
veranda after my pet guinea-fowls with insufferable audacity.</p>

<p>White hawks, so rare in most parts of the island, were numerous
here; they are most superb birds, with plumage soft as satin, and
whiter even than snow; and radiant piercing eyes, so bold and
bright! I often wished to procure a young one to rear tame, but I
suppose that a revolt amongst my poultry would certainly have
ensued, on the installation of such a favourite. The Tasmanian
eagle is a very large and noble bird, of grand and majestic aspect;
but prejudice is here very strong against him, and scores of
instances are currently related of his destructive predilections
for young lambs, sucking pigs, and other dainty morsels; we,
however, give very little credence to these ungenerous stories, as
none of the narrators have been able to say that they themselves
saw the offence committed.</p>

<p>One of our shepherds (at Swan Port), having on one occasion
wounded an eagle slightly in the wing, caught it, and brought it to
me: had I refused to keep the poor thing, it would immediately have
been put to death; I therefore let him leave it, and for some days
it was tethered by the leg to a large coop, and plenty of food
given to it, but it ate nothing&mdash;parrots, chickens, rabbits, and
offal were all alike untouched. I then supposed that my noble
captive was too heroic to eat whilst in that fettered condition,
and after having the feathers of one long beautiful wing cut, I set
him at liberty in the garden; but, although daily tempted by fresh
food, he ate nothing for <i>three weeks</i> from the time of his
capture, and I began to despair of keeping him alive, when one day,
to my great joy, a piece of fresh liver conquered his heroism, end
he devoured it greedily. After that he always fed heartily, and
roamed about the garden for some months, but never became tame
enough to eat from our hands. One day a servant whom I had
entrusted with a gun to shoot rabbits, saw my poor eagle sitting on
a fence a short distance from the house, and believing it to be a
wild one, shot it, much to my vexation.</p>

<p>The beak and talons, and indeed the whole form and aspect of the
bird, denote enormous strength, and the span of the extended wings
is from seven to nine feet, so that it would be a formidable
adversary to almost any creature it determined to attack. I have
heard a story here of a child two years old being carried some
distance by an eagle, and then dropped, with its head severely
injured; but I am unwilling to place any reliance on the tale.</p>

<p>The two neighbouring dwellings which we used to peep at through
the streets or avenues cut in our girdle of forest, had some
meadows and corn-fields on a rich marsh that spread out below them,
and in our walks we often saw great flocks of white cockatoos
thickly scattered about like sheep, eating up the springing grain.
Unlike the clever, harmless, black cockatoos, the white ones are
exceedingly mischievous, devouring immense quantities of corn; and
they are so cunning and sagacious, that it is very difficult to
approach them with a gun. One pair which had been shot near us was
brought me as a present. They were very large handsome birds, of
snow-white plumage, with crests and lower tail-feathers of the most
pure and delicate yellow. Knowing that they feed wholly on grain,
and are commonly eaten in New South Wales, I had them roasted, and
we found them excellent, being young and tender, very much like a
fat wild duck; but I believe youth is an indispensable requisite in
a cooked cockatoo, the elderly birds being of rather leathery
texture.</p>

<p>Very few parrots visited us, and those were of the common green
kind, the least beautiful of all. Wild ducks and quail were
tolerably plentiful, but we neither saw bronze-winged pigeons nor
wattle-birds.</p>

<p>One or two pairs of "Superb Warblers" lived close to the garden
fence, and for a long time I tried in vain to discover their nest.
We often fed them, and they came boldly about us, but always
baffled me when I endeavoured to watch them home. At last I felt
quite sure I had found the grass tussock containing one nest, but
although this was not above two feet across, I was some time still
ere I discovered the entrance, for of course I would not disturb
anything, and the little creatures were so artful and cautious, and
in such a sad state of fluttering chirping trepidation when I was
peeping about, that they distracted my attention, as they naturally
intended to do. At last, I accidentally looked directly into the
little tube of woven grass and web that served them as hall and
ante-room&mdash;several blades of reeds waved before it, but still, on
gazing intently down into the dark little cavity, I espied two or
three little gaping mouths, and heard a faint small chirp. The two
tiny parents of these tinier babies (which could not be much bigger
than peas) were all the time flying round and round me, in most
distressing terror, almost brushing my face with their delicate
wings in their anxiety to drive me away; and the instant I drew
back, both darted into the nest to see if all was right at home.
Poor little flutterers! they need not have feared me. I only
confided the secret of their abode to my husband, and so fearful
was he of disturbing them, that I could not induce him to go near
enough to examine the nest. In due time we had the pleasure of
seeing the whole miniature family out together; the old birds in a
great state of importance and flutter, feeding their droll brown
little offspring most assiduously.</p>

<p>"Come here, and look at a strange insect," said Mr. Meredith,
one day when we were in the garden; and I went, and looked, and
looked again, all over the low young cherry-tree to which he
pointed.</p>

<p>"I cannot see any insect; where is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! look for it; it is at least eight inches long, so you
surely ought to find it!"</p>

<p>And searching again, more narrowly than before, and following
the direction of his glance, I observed something like a few dry
sticks or twigs, hanging in a loose irregular angular style from
one of the sprays, which, on a closer view, proved to be a living
creature, so exactly the colour and apparent texture of a dead
stick, that I could scarcely credit its being anything else, and
carefully took it off the tree, before being quite convinced. I
suppose&mdash;for I am woefully unlearned in entomology&mdash;that it was one
of the animated straw genus. The body was of a dull brown, and
about six inches long, and little more than a quarter of an inch
thick, with one or two folds just like the joints of a dead reed or
twig; the head had prominent eyes, and two long feelers, like thin
dead rushes, which being in a line with the body, added nearly
three inches to its apparent length. The six legs were like thin
dead rushes too, about four inches long, divided into three joints
and ending in a clawed foot. Rather nearer to the head than the
tail were two very short small wings, like the bladebones of
unfinished shoulders, evidently quite inefficient as instruments of
flight to the long body and legs. The creature seemed in a
half-torpid state when I captured it, and eventually became rigid,
when I ventured to believe it really dead, and preserved it, until
devoured by insects, and utterly destroyed. Some persons who saw it
told me they had seen other specimens, with large handsome wings;
but their kind promises to procure me one were never fulfilled.</p>

<p>Any one fond of entomology, or the study of the Crustacea, might
have enjoyed great opportunities and facilities at "Lath Hall,"
where fine lively scorpions were in the frequent practice of
perambulating our parlour walls, particularly near the fireplace;
and interesting full-grown centipedes, of a most venomous green
hue, and rarely less than four inches in length, gracefully
meandered in the folds of the window-curtains, our dressing-room
(usually by us denominated "the tank," from its icy dampness) being
their favourite haunt; and as in all the rooms save one, which we
allotted to George and the maid, the wide-apart "slabs" of the
floors afforded ample space for a lobster to pass through, the
entrance of any of the insect tribe was a matter of no marvel
whatever. My chiefest terror was, lest snakes should come in too;
but although many large ones were seen and killed very near the
house, I never saw one within it.</p>

<p>Tarantulas straggled along with impunity in all directions,
unless so near that I apprehended their crawling on me; and then
the idea of those eight great long woolly hairy legs, and that fat
black body, traversing any portion of my own person, generally
conquered my humanity, and the intruder died.</p>

<p>One of our few amusements was burning trees down, and no one
would marvel at such an occupation becoming quite an exciting
pursuit, had they seen how cruelly the tall gaunt trees shut out
the morning sun. In winter, if the sun rose at half-past seven, not
a glance of his glorious face reached our chilly den before ten
o'clock: we seemed to be living, as they say Truth does, at the
bottom of a well, and we did what we could to excavate an opening
towards the sunshine.</p>

<p>Selecting our victim-tree, we first made up a bundle of the
driest leaves, grass, and bark inside, if it were partially hollow,
as was generally the case; and after lighting this with a
lucifer-match, and fanning up a bright blaze, we carried to it
quantities of loose wood and bark, the latter commodity being very
abundant everywhere, the gum-trees shedding their outer skin
yearly, which lies about in all directions, some of it like
gigantic pieces of cinnamon, many feet long, and some sorts in
wider and flatter flakes, but all highly combustible. When a good
heap rose against the first tree, and the fire grew too fierce to
approach, we carried a "fire-stick" to another, and made up our
blazing pile there too, pursuing the same system with five or six,
by which time the first fire required replenishing. Many of the
logs that we dragged to our fires were the abodes of numerous kinds
of ants, most of which <i>nip</i> rather sharply, but of some the
sting is venomous and agonizing in the extreme.</p>

<p>We were busily employed in this way one evening (the working
party consisting of the papa, mamma, and George, with the nursemaid
and baby Charles looking on), when a piercing shriek from poor
George alarmed us with the idea that a snake had bitten him; he
sprang up into the air twice or thrice, far higher than he could
have jumped with his utmost exertion at another time, and then
rolled on the ground still shrieking fearfully. I carried him away
from the spot, and then saw the cause of the mischief; a large
black ant, above an inch long, was on the poor child's instep,
still stinging him through his sock. Their sting is very long, and
Mr. Meredith describes the pain as resembling what we may imagine
would be that of a sharp red-hot iron forced into the flesh. In
twenty minutes or half an hour it abates, and gradually goes away,
leaving a blister like a mosquito-bite. On another occasion, the
luckless boy had one of these horrible creatures in the leg of his
trousers, and before it could be removed, he was severely stung in
nine places. I have frequently detected them running over me, but
have always escaped being stung. Once, as I lay on the sofa
reading, I observed one very deliberately walking along my collar,
carrying an enormous buzz-fly in his nippers.</p>

<p>A species of ant somewhat smaller than these, black, with yellow
forceps, is as much or more to be dreaded, as they sting with equal
severity, and can jump a considerable distance in pursuit of any
one who molests them.</p>

<p>Our burning trees often formed very beautiful objects at night,
sometimes taking the semblance of ruined towers, with windows and
loopholes defined in glowing fire, and showers of sparks falling
from the summit. Some would burn internally to a great height, and
then burst forth in volumes of flame, many feet from the ground,
throwing out great jets, like gigantic fireworks, lighting up all
the surrounding gloom.</p>

<p>I have not yet alluded to one of the most constant and
unpleasant pests to which these colonies are subject, namely, the
great brown disgusting buzz-flies, which continue to torment us all
the year round, and in summer swarm most offensively and
destructively. Our old English blue-bottle fly is, it is most true,
a very noisy fellow, and seems fond of dissipated company, in
butchers' shops, &amp;c., and in summer sometimes greatly disturbs
one's lonely reverie, by testing the hardness and reverberatory
powers of our ceilings and windows in his riotous bumping flight
about a room. But here, his brown ill-looking relatives are not
content, like him, with a summer reign,&mdash;they bump about us the
twelve months through, and in numbers incalculable. Now, as I
write, some forty or fifty are careering through the room. knocking
up against the windows, and buzzing most abominably; whilst the
difficulty of excluding them from the larder, and the destruction
they occasion in it, are two important items in the catalogue of
colonial household plagues. The small house-fly is here, as
elsewhere, very troublesome too; but though these swarm in immense
numbers during the summer months, they are more endurable than the
"brown buzzes."</p>

<p>A new kind of small fly has appeared in Van Diemen's Land within
the last few years, which is generally known as the "Port Philip
fly," and supposed to have been brought from thence. It closely
resembles the common house-fly; but, instead of the outspreading
sucker-proboscis of the latter, its head is furnished with a
tapering black tube, the narrow end of which it inserts, with a
sharp piecing bite, into the skin of men or animals, and commences
sucking the blood most actively, often leaving a drop on the
surface of the skin. To horses it is a terrible torment, and seems
chiefly to abound in the vicinity of stables and straw-yards.</p>

<p>One of the insects which I most dreaded was the "wood-tick," an
unpleasant-looking creature, very much resembling those which
infest sheep, but possessing a great <i>penchant</i> for a
residence under the human skin, into and beneath which it eats its
way until nearly hidden from sight, without any pain to the person
attacked for the first several hours, so that it often escapes
notice until the intolerable aching of a large portion of the body
surrounding it leads to the detection of the insect, which must
then be pulled or cut out. These ticks live among wood, and are
sometimes brought into the house with the fuel. I have frequently
seen them on my dress or habit, when walking or riding in the
"Bush," and have on two occasions been bitten: once on the throat,
by a small one which had been several hours at work; it had buried
its head entirely, and required a strong pull with tweezers before
it could be extracted, the creature being as hard as bone, and very
toughly jointed. I felt very little pain afterwards on this
occasion; but the second of the insidious little miners, which also
attacked me on the neck, was a much larger specimen, and it had
begun to cause a most distressing ache in my shoulder, neck, and
arm, which I attributed to rheumatism, until, on passing my hand
over my dress, I detected its round hard body. which was too firmly
attached for me to pull it away myself. After it was removed, I
suffered great pain and numbness in the arm and shoulder for
several days.</p>

Church-Building.&mdash;Public Worship.&mdash;Deficiency of Religious
Instruction.&mdash;Rustic Costumes.&mdash;Leather "Leggings."&mdash;Progressive
Love-tokens.&mdash;Marriage.</p>

<p>At the period of our arrival, no church had been as yet erected
at Port Sorell, and the roads of the district were so impassable
from bogs, for nine months of the twelve, that had there been one,
no congregation could have met oftener than ten or twelve Sundays
in the year. Still, the absence of all semblance of a place of
public worship for members of the Church of England (whilst, even
in a yet poorer neighbouring settlement, an Independent chapel and
minister were maintained, chiefly by poor sawyers) became too
glaring to continue; and it was proposed to erect a cheap wooden
building by means of subscriptions. This design, after considerable
delay, was carried out: one person subscribing so many "slabs;"
another, a certain quantity of weather-boards; a third, the
requisite "sawed stuff;" a fourth, the shingles; a fifth, the
blacksmith's work; a sixth, the "lend" of a bullock-team, and so
on; very few payments being made in money. Unfortunately, instead
of being placed on the township, in the centre of the population,
where a glebe and burial-ground might have been obtained from the
Government, the little building was set up on a private property,
too much encumbered with mortgages for the requisite gift of the
site to be legally made without considerable expense, and
consequently the consecration could not take place; but when merely
the rough shell was set up, our energetic and accomplished Bishop
came down and assisted at the first celebration of Divine service,
before a larger congregation than could have been expected in such
a place.</p>

<p>Nearly a year elapsed before any clergyman was appointed; and
then service was only performed on one Sunday in a month, by the
missionary chaplain of Deloraine, the Rev. Montagu Williams. He
came to Port Sorell, a distance of forty miles, at the end of every
fourth week, to officiate on the Sun day morning at the little
church, and in the afternoon at the police office.</p>

<p>Such, and so rare, are the opportunities for public worship in
the wilds of Tasmania!</p>

<p>Surely the munificent gifts and bequests which so many pious
persons at Home make for the purposes of church-building and
endowment, in towns and cities where scores of churches already
stand, might be extended to such a far-away nook as this island,
where, from the peculiar condition of a large number of the
inhabitants, the need of instruction is so great, and the means so
small! The amount of good which might be effected by the ministry
of truly Christian conscientious clergymen would be very great
indeed.</p>

<p>Did the power and the means of supplying such rest with our
earnest-hearted and benevolent prelate, it were well for us all,
but more especially for the poor and ignorant of his diocese. But,
if persons ever so notoriously unfit for holy orders are appointed
here from Home, his judgment and conviction of the impropriety and
mischief of such appointments cannot effect a change unless their
commission of errors be as glaring as their omission of duties. We
must, therefore, patiently endure the evil, knowing meanwhile that,
with the same means, an infinite amount of good would result, under
different circumstances.</p>

<p>I have often remarked the difference which exists between the
outward aspect of farm labourers here and in England: whether
attributable to the various trades and callings here amalgamated
into the same occupations, or to the sea-voyage, or to both of
these together, I know not; but certain it is, that no British
village ever sent forth such nondescript toilettes as I have seen
here on a Sunday. Latterly, the increase of country shops in the
colony, and the variety of cheap ready-made coats of all shapes,
fabrics, and prices, have caused wonderful innovations in the dress
of all classes, although still permitting a great display of
original taste.</p>

<p>Red or blue flannel serge shirts are universally worn by
labourers in cold or wet weather as a working dress, generally
hanging loosely over other garments, or fastened blouse-wise by a
leather belt; and when these are new and bright, they are sometimes
permitted to form part of the Sunday outfit.</p>

<p>The stock-keepers seem a perfectly distinct class in point of
dress, a subject which I conceive costs them some pains, from the
ingenious incongruities often displayed; all evidently aiming at
something dashing, and of rather a sporting cast. We have often
wondered where such oddly-cut and thoroughly queer-looking coats,
hats, and other garments were procured, until a little circumstance
which occurred lately threw some light on the interesting subject.
Mr. Meredith was one day in a Jew slop-seller's shop in Launceston,
making some purchases for our servants, when a labouring man came
in, and desired to see some black hats. Immediately the counter
displayed a selection of the most unaccountable shapes, chiefly
very tall, and with scarcely any brims; but as even those were
deemed too broad by the customer, he went away in search of
narrower ones, the shopman remarking, "Oh! I see you are quite a
dandy! you want to be <i>too</i> flash altogether."</p>

<p>And in reply to Mr. Meredith's inquiries, he said that they were
obliged to keep these extraordinary articles for such men, who
would buy no other, and were as fastidious and particular "as any
fine lady;" whilst we, in our innocence, had commiserated them for
being victimized by the shopkeepers, and having goods foisted upon
them which were otherwise unsaleable.</p>

<p>Having thus touched on the delicate topic of taste in dress, I
must not confine my observations to the servants, whilst their
masters in many instances are yet more removed from the customary
aspect of persons in the same station at Home. The true gentleman,
whether at home or abroad, is as certain to avoid any uncouth
peculiarity of attire, as the ambitious "snob" is to adopt it; and
colonial country life exemplifies the fact abundantly. The most
striking feature in the costume of such worthies on the north side
of our island is a description of rough brown leathern casing for
the legs, neither trouser, gaiter, nor boot, but a loose, wrinkled,
bagging, dirty, slovenly, hedger-and-ditcher kind of envelope, worn
both in winter and summer, and usually slung to the waist by a
multitude of straps and a belt, looking like a surgeon's dressing
for a fracture, ill put on; and in dirty weather the loose puckers
about the ankles serve as such capacious receptacles for mud, that
the exit of visitors so arrayed is the signal for the entre of the
housemaid, to remove the evidences of their sojourn from carpets
and floors. When these hideous leggings are companioned (as I
<i>have</i> seen them, and on <i>soi-disant</i> esquires, too) by a
hat of white felt or black oil-skin, a striped shirt, with a blue
serge one by way of blouse, and a tremendously heavy long whip in
full play, the refined and <i>recherch</i> effect of the
combination may be imagined!</p>

<p>As to the tender question of <i>esquirearchy</i>, I am convinced
that the only prudent principle now is, to bestow the envied title
on every one alike&mdash;on the friend you invite to partake your
dinner, and the butcher from whom you bought it. All this has a
strong affinity to some of the ways of the "far West," not a little
aided in effect by an odd use of old words, and a puzzling
adaptation of new ones which, although less racy and graphic than
some of our American friends' ingenious coinages, are essentially
un-English.</p>

<p>As all my prisoner women-servants have had suitors in plenty, I
have sometimes been amused by quietly observing the growing
symptoms of the tender passion, as exemplified (in their class of
life) by the unfailing presents and love-tokens offered by the
enamoured swain as symbols of his sincere attachment, and signs of
progress made. The campaign not unfrequently opens with the bold
demonstration of a gay print gown, especially if the arrival of a
hawker's cart at the kitchen-door has afforded so excellent an
opportunity for the display of rustic gallantry. The presentation
of a bonnet and ribbons I look upon as a decidedly serious advance,
and in some cases a few yards of calico often give a grave aspect
to the affair; a shawl, too, is considered a very affecting thing,
and I have known a lace cap on the head exercise a mighty influence
over the heart; but the grand conclusive stroke of all, the true
love-philter, the unerring omen that bids me seek a new handmaiden,
is&mdash;when the bolt of Cupid comes wrapped in flannel! Print gowns
and new bonnets are, no doubt, shrewd pleaders; ribbons and lace,
too, are insinuating things; and shawls and calico may mean much;
but when the courtship takes the shape of flannel, I know the work
of wooing has sped&mdash;the damsel's heart is won; and that the next
thing will be John's awkward round-about request for leave to "keep
company with Mary;" which is very quickly followed by Mary's
sheepish presentation of the "memorial for marriage," with&mdash;"If you
would please, ma'am, to ask the master to please to recommend us!"
And married they are, shortly after, if the lover is in a situation
to maintain a wife, which the superior powers very rightly desire
to know, before authorizing the marriage.</p>

<p>We had thought it sufficiently unpleasant to be located for a
whole summer in the forest, although during that time we could
occasionally make a <i>sortie</i> from our wooden walls, and
breathe the sea-air. But the approach of winter, and the conviction
that the whole of its dreary days must pass before we could finally
escape from our Castle Dismal, was in truth a severe trial of
endurance. If even sunshine lost its brightness in that sombre
forest gloom, what a thrice-dreary aspect did it wear in those
days, and weeks, and months of almost incessant rain! Sometimes it
rained very hard, and sometimes harder still; sometimes like a
continuous thunder-shower, and sometimes in one mighty sheet of
water, like an upper ocean that had burst its bounds. The ground
was always something wetter than a bog, and most often resembled a
flooded river: such were the pleasant varieties we enjoyed; and
when Mr. Meredith's horse used to be brought in a morning for him
to ride down to the police-office, it came beside the veranda for
him to embark, as a boat would alongside a ship, for a lagune lay
between the house and the garden gate, where he usually mounted;
and the whole road he had to traverse was an alternation of deep
water, shallower water, and bogs.</p>

<p>Four pouring months at length wept themselves out; spring found
me slowly recovering from a severe illness and, by way of
restorative, brought us the official intelligence that the intended
reductions in the police department, consequent on the low
condition of the Government finances, would inevitably include the
magistracy of Port Sorell&mdash;a pleasant climax to our troubles! more
especially as our own cottage was begun, on the land we had
purchased, and must be paid for, whether required or not. Spring,
under these circumstances, became rather more melancholy than even
winter itself; but happily the sky of our changeful fortunes was
subsequently brightened by the intelligence that the threatened
reductions were postponed <i>sine die</i>, and the hope that our
pleasant sea-side home would receive us before autumn.</p>

<p>A kind invitation at this time from the Lieutenant-Governor, our
good and valued friend, Sir Eardley Wilmot, to visit him in
Hobarton, promised us a most pleasant and welcome change of scene
and society; and we accordingly arranged for our temporary
excursion, and our final departure from "Lath Hall" at the same
time; determining to take up our abode, on our return, in the new
cottage by the sea, however unfinished it might be, rather than
dive again into the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>Rapidly and most cheerfully was the work of packing-up proceeded
with, and within a week from the first consideration of our
removal, I and the children and the nursemaid were, one bright
morning at eight o'clock, sitting on the deck of the smart little
cutter the "Hope" (of about 15 tons), which was cleaned out and
furbished up especially for our accommodation, and bound to
Launceston expressly in our service, Mr. Meredith remaining behind
to complete the dismantling of "Lath Hall," and purposing to ride
up and meet us in town.</p>

<p>A fair wind carried our little vessel into Port Dalrymple by ten
o'clock, when we got into smooth water; a very welcome change after
the heavy swell we had suffered from during our short sail through
the straits, which knocked our little bark about very roughly, and
occasioned us considerable indisposition.</p>

<p>Launceston lies about forty miles from the sea-coast, and the
voyage thither, up the Tamar, is very monotonous. George Town is a
scattered little settlement on the low shores of a small but secure
cove at the mouth of the estuary, a few miles above the lighthouse;
on the opposite shore, near Kelso Bay and York Town, are some
productive farms and gardens, but the George Town side is a mere
barren, sandy waste, producing nothing. Although situated several
miles from the sea, George Town is sometimes frequented by families
from the interior of the island for the summer pleasures of bathing
and boating, the weekly visit of the steamer from Launceston giving
every facility of access.</p>

<p>The scenery on the Tamar is of the tamest possible description,
although the river forms many fine bends in its course. The land on
the banks is generally low, but yet rising sufficiently to shut out
any distant view. Here and there the quiet smooth little slopes
unexpectedly display a feeble attempt at the romantic, in a few
protruding rocks of very mild and subdued aspect; the most striking
point is named "Brady's Look-out," after a notorious bush-ranger of
years gone by, who is said to have been "planted" (i.e., concealed)
there for some time; but the tokens of busy industry which meet the
eye at several bends of the river are pleasanter subjects for
contemplation. Here stands a large well-built steam flour-mill,
with its owner's comfortable cottage, garden, and out-buildings;
and, close by, a very pretty little church: there is a busy
shipwright's establishment, with one fine vessel nearly ready to
launch, another standing in its skeleton, and all the surrounding
methodical confusion of new boats and old boats of all sizes, large
and small, timber of all descriptions, smoking and
pleasant-smelling pitch cauldrons, neat cottages and workshops, and
a busy buzz of voices, and sounds of hammering and singing coming
cheerfully towards us as we glide along.</p>

<p>Heavily-laden clumsily-shaped wood-boats toiled slowly up the
stream, carrying fuel to Launceston, and making our progress seem
rapid by comparison, until some neat, sharp, smart, whaleboat, with
its well-feathered oars and clever lug sail, darted past us in the
most provoking manner, and almost proved us to be resting
motionless on the water. The wind had become so light and fitful
that we scarcely seemed to make any way, and I began to think about
making up our beds on board for the children; but a few friendly
puffs came to our aid, and at sunset we were in sight of
Launceston, which, viewed from the water at a proper distance, and
no doubt a little beautified in my eyes by my anxious desire to
reach it, looked positively pretty.</p>

<p>The situation of the town seems to me very ill-chosen, as at a
short distance below it the river is crossed by a bar, over which
laden vessels of any large size cannot pass; and accordingly when
ships come in, they are compelled to anchor below the bar, until so
far unloaded as to permit their crossing it, when they take up
their position at the town wharf, until about to sail again, and
then they drop down past the provoking bar, before completing their
cargo. The placing a shipping port in such a position, when, for
forty miles below, the river is navigable for a "seventy-four,"
seems an unaccountable blunder, and one which, combined with the
unhealthy situation, must, it would seem, eventually lead to the
decline of the town of Launceston, and the selection of some more
eligible locality for the site of our northern metropolis.</p>

<p>The channel at the bar is so narrow that two vessels cannot
cross it together, and we had to wait until another of the coasting
craft had preceded us; the little "Hope" looking very humble indeed
beside three great merchantmen which were waiting there to unload,
their huge black sides towering up above us like great walls, and
the people on their decks looking down as if they were on a tall
housetop and we in the street below.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when we reached the wharf, and our little
vessel was then compelled to take up a berth outside of the steamer
and two other vessels, across the decks of which we passed to the
shore, not without my suffering enough terror and anxiety for a
life in the few minutes of our transit; the spaces between the
vessels, and the deep water below, gaping like open traps to seize
something precious belonging to me. Our good "skipper" (who knew
how anxious I had been to get on shore), and all sorts of strange
men, immediately began running off in the most kind but provoking
way with my children and our baggage. I saw trunks, carpet-bags,
and bedding dodging about in the fitful gleams, like things
possessed; and, utterly despairing of being able to control matters
any longer on board, I followed in the wake of a conspicuous roll
of mattresses, until I found myself beside a heap of my
property&mdash;children, maid, and trunks&mdash;all safely huddled together
on the wharf, guarded by the "Hope's" mate, who soon called a cab
for us. With a stodge of small folks and small packages inside, and
a pile of trunks and bedding following, we drove to our hotel,
highly pleased at having had so quick a passage, for vessels are
often a fortnight in going this short distance (about sixty miles),
owing to contrary winds, fogs, and other obstacles; and Mr.
Meredith, to provide for such an untoward delay, had insisted on my
packing up a commissariat large enough for a voyage to New Zealand
at least, which became an acceptable and additional perquisite to
the "Hope's" good people.</p>

<p>At four the next morning we took our seats in the coach for
Hobarton, and arrived there the same evening soon after eight, a
distance of 120 miles. The fearfully fast driving was the chief
drawback to the pleasure of the journey: the scenery is in many
parts very beautiful, but the feeling of terror with which I was
possessed, lest the constantly-threatened upset should take place,
left me little power to appreciate or enjoy it. The unfortunate
horses are flogged unmercifully, and driven for the greater part of
the way, up hill and down, and often down very steep hills, too, at
a furious gallop. No such precaution as locking a wheel is ever
heard of! The result has been shown with terrible regularity by the
paragraphs of the weekly papers, recording "serious and fatal
accidents," fractures and injuries of all kinds sustained by the
passengers, all consequent on the senseless and pernicious system
so obstinately pursued.</p>

<p>Between two and three months passed very pleasantly at Hobarton
(Mr. Meredith joining me occasionally, when he could leave Port
Sorell), in our delightful sojourn at Government House, with the
late&mdash;alas! that he is gone!&mdash;kind-hearted, witty, generous Sir
Eardley Wilmot, and in visiting our relatives and other friends in
the vicinity.</p>

<p>The utter and flagrant falsehood of the cowardly and cruel
accusations made by anonymous slanderers against our late
Lieutenant-Governor has long since been so well exposed, that I
should pass over all allusion to so lamentable a topic, and one so
painful now to touch upon, but that our visit happened to take
place at the very time when, as it was wickedly declared, <i>"No
ladies ever visited at Government House!"</i> Such affirmations are
always best met by simple facts. Mr. Meredith and myself, and two
other families (husbands, wives, and children), were resident
guests there. Sir Eardley Wilmot's agreeable dinner-parties were
attended by all whom he thought worthy or desirable to invite; and
a ball, the cards for which were issued during our stay, and only
gave the short notice of one day and a half, was thronged by all
the visitable world of Hobarton and the vicinity, the company very
possibly including some of the heartless maligners themselves,
although I am rather tempted to believe that the reports emanated
from disappointed suitors for admission to Government House. Candid
and open-hearted, perhaps even to a fault, in this world of
hypocrisy, highly refined and witty himself, and keenly
appreciating wit and intelligence in those around him, Sir Eardley
Wilmot rarely took prudent pains to disguise his feelings of
indifference towards the dull, the pompous, or the vulgar, and
consequently created some mortal foes, who, added by the ready
credulity of a puritanical minister, aimed but too surely the
assassin's blow at his honour and peace of mind.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>After so perfect a seclusion as I had lived in for years, it was
exceedingly pleasant to find myself once more in society; and the
change which, during those five years, had taken place in the
thoughts and habits and general tone of conversation among the good
Hobartians, though perhaps scarcely perceptible to themselves, was
agreeably evident to me.</p>

<p>Among other more important matters, I found that the prevalent
fashionable epidemic, instead of betraying symptoms of the ancient
Berlin-wool influenza or the knitting disorder, had taken an
entirely new turn, and that a landscape-sketching and water-colour
fever was raging with extraordinary vehemence among the usually too
placid and apathetic sons and daughters of Tasmania. The infection
had been originally brought by Mr. Prout, the fame of whose very
clever water-colour drawings of the scenery in New South Wales, and
the celebrity he attained there, had prepared for him a glad
welcome in Van Diemen's Land; and the exquisite art which he taught
and practised so well at once became <i>the</i> fashion <i>par
excellence</i>. All the young ladies, and many elder ones,
immediately discovered (or coveted, which is nearly the same) a
great taste for drawing, and all commenced taking class lessons
from Mr. Prout in out-of-doors sketching. Stationers' shops and
fancy repositories were straightway stripped of all their pencils,
colours, and sketch-books, and Mr. Front's absence from Hobarton
for the summer vacation alone prevented me from joining his
disciples.</p>

<p>An exhibition of paintings, drawings, engravings, &amp;c., was
opened after I left town, composed of contributions from the
collections of the residents and the works of colonial amateurs and
artists. I greatly regretted not being able to see it, but the
knowledge that such a thing was achieved at all was exceedingly
pleasant, and seemed a good omen of future advancement; and from
all accounts of the exhibition which I read and heard, it was a
highly satisfactory and creditable beginning. One more having taken
place since, I trust we may anticipate that they will be continued
at intervals, if not regularly.</p>

<p>There are some pretty fern-tree thickets at the foot of Mount
Wellington, and I visited one with a large party; but after seeing
our perfectly wild and untrodden fern valley at Port Sorell, this
oft-frequented one, the beloved of sketching and pic-nic parties,
seemed almost uninteresting. The ferns, as they ever are, were
verdant and graceful, though rather small, and the gurgling brook
was pretty; but the empty champagne bottles which bristled beside
the rocks, and the corks and greasy sandwich papers lurking amongst
the moss, savoured considerably more of the creature comforts than
the picturesque.</p>

<p>Regattas, balls, dinner-parties, and pic-nics wear so much the
same aspect wherever they flourish in English society, and
Tasmanian society is, I rejoice to say, so essentially English,
that a chronicle of my pleasant sojourn in our antipodean
metropolis might serve for a chronicle of any equally pleasant
sojourn in any nice town of the United Kingdom, and so, needless to
particularize in a gossip chiefly devoted to less civilized
matters.</p>

<p>The great number of very comfortable carriages which ply for
hire both in Launceston and Hobarton is an essential public
convenience, and a great advance from olden times, when the one or
two vehicles of the kind in town would he engaged on a ball night
to convey thirty or forty parties each. Now, long strings of smart
clean cabs (so called, though more of the chaise and barouche
species) stand in several of the public thoroughfares, and can be
as cheaply hired as similar carriages could be in England: at the
time I was there, 1<i>s</i>. per mile, or 3<i>s</i>. by the hour,
was the usual fare.</p>

<p>My nursemaid had become far too much enamoured of the charms and
gaieties of the city to think with any composure of a return to the
solitude of bush life, and I found it requisite to supply her
place. She had been my first trial of the effects of Mrs. Bowden's
system of female discipline on board the "Anson," and for a year
and a half had been all I could desire in a servant, irreproachable
in her conduct, clean, cheerful, and industrious, until the visit
to town, and the greater opportunities for showing her pretty face,
caused neglect of her duty, and an alarming exhibition of pink silk
stockings, thin muslin dresses, and other town vanities. I again
applied to Mrs. Bowden, and had again cause to appreciate the value
of her influence, not so much in the fitness of the woman I
selected for the situation she was to fill (for at first she was
awkward and uncouth in the extreme), as in the almost miraculous
change which must have been wrought in her to fit her for any
decent occupation whatever. She had, as I afterwards discovered,
been reared amidst the worst of the bad&mdash;had been imprisoned in
some dozen different gaols, and no sooner liberated than, partly
from destitution, partly from inveterate habit, she had sinned
again, to be again punished. At last she was transported, and after
remaining the usual period (six months, I believe) under Mrs.
Bowden's government, she came to me a willing, orderly, thankful
creature, and remained with us a year and a quarter, when she
married comfortably. How different to her former wretched, lost
condition!</p>

<p>Simply judging from the superior usefulness, willingness, and
orderly, decent, sober demeanour of the women I have taken from the
"Anson," over all others of their unfortunate class that I have
known, I must believe the system pursued there by Mrs. Bowden to be
an excellent and effective one, and rendering the greatest possible
benefit to the colony generally.</p>

<p>The women always seem to feel great gratitude and reverence for
Mrs. Bowden, which her earnest solicitude for their well-doing, and
her own exalted character and endowments, well deserve; they also
express much attachment to her female assistants, or "officers," as
they are termed. Once, soon after my first "Anson" girl had
arrived, I was going to write to Mrs. Bowden, and called Jane to
ask if she would like me to say anything from her, when I received
this somewhat startling reply,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! if you please ma'am, to give my best thanks and duty to
Mrs. Bowden, and my kind love to all the officers!"</p>

<p>Eight or nine pounds a year are the wages I have always given to
the female prisoner-servants at first, raising them afterwards, if
deserved. Free women expect much higher terms, are not a whit
better, but often worse than the prisoners, and are under less
control. <i>All</i> are certain of marrying, if they please;
<i>proposals</i> are plentiful, inconveniently so, indeed,
sometimes, to masters and mistresses, when tidy handmaidens are
wooed, won, and married in such quick succession that new servants
have constantly to be sought, and their passage paid. But a
suitable marriage is so probable and legitimate a means of
reformation, that we never place obstacles in the way of such good
intentions. Those prisoner-women who settle in the country, with
few exceptions, behave well and industriously. I know many wives of
this class who keep their husbands' little cottages as clean and
tidy as any honest English village dame could do, and wash or sew,
to earn a little money themselves. An addiction to <i>drink</i> is
the chief temptation to be feared; if they resist that, all goes
well. Many of them have no family, and the spare shillings and
pounds are only too likely to go to the publican or the "sly grog
seller," which is still worse, being illegal as well as wrong. The
temperance-pledge and the savings-bank seem to be the two most
efficient lifeboats, in such chances of moral wreck; but it is only
the naturally determined and resolute among the well-meaning who
have courage to adopt them. Religious instruction, if adequate,
would do much; the beneficial influence of really conscientious,
sincere Christian ministers would be immense, among the lower
classes in the country here&mdash;those who would go among the poor and
ignorant, and win them back to the right path by earnest gentle
counsel and kindly admonition; whose own lives, pure and simple
themselves, should be ever before their erring brethren as a living
testimony of the great Example they preach; those who would be seen
more often on the poor man's threshold than at the rich man's
table; who would practise charity as well as preach it, and watch
that no beam obscured their own eye, whilst spying out the mote in
their brother's. I have, I know, before alluded to this subject;
but the lamentable inadequacy of the means of instruction for the
lower classes in this colony is so great, that the fact can
scarcely be too often reiterated. The deficient number even of
<i>professors</i> of religion, and the sad apathy and indifference
of some among them, ask most urgently for a change.</p>

<p>In January, 1846, we returned home by the coach as far as
Launceston, passing through, on our way, the populous settlements
and towns of Brighton, Bagdad, Green Ponds, Cross Marsh, Oatlands,
Ross, Campbelltown, and Perth, all containing good churches and
inns, and the greater number displaying shops of various kinds, and
many substantial houses; whilst nearly the whole length of the road
traverses inclosed and cultivated land, and constantly leads us
past comfortable country houses, farms, and cottages, proving a far
greater amount of improvement and change from a wild state than our
beautiful island is credited with at Home.</p>

<p>Pausing but a day in Launceston, we proceeded in the steam-boat
to George Town, expecting to find our little friend the "Hope"
there, and in three or four hours more to reach Port Sorell. But a
perverse westerly wind, which had been blowing for some days, still
continued, and after waiting idly two days at George Town, without
a symptom of any change, Mr. Meredith was obliged to return home;
and, as I decidedly declined the alternative of remaining with the
children and maid at a dull little inn, we determined to make our
way across, over Badger Head, a track which was described to us as
all but impassable.</p>

<p>A kind settler at Kelso Bay, opposite George Town, to whom Mr.
Meredith applied for assistance, promised us the loan of a
horse-cart and two riding horses, and on the third morning of our
reluctant sojourn we took a boat, and crossed over Port Dalrymple,
to the pleasant home of our new friend. and shortly set forth on
our route, the servant and children occupying the cart. I had not
even put on a shawl, knowing so well the torment of any dispensable
encumbrance in a fatiguing scramble like the one we
contemplated.</p>

<p>A very rough road led us for some miles through bush and swamp,
and finally brought us near to the sea-beach at the foot of the
dreaded Badger Head. Here we found two of the constables and our
groom awaiting us, Mr. Meredith having sent a foot messenger to
them the day before; but we could not have our own horses brought
to meet us, there being no safe means of crossing them over the
deep broad channel of Port Sorell, on the western shore of which
lay the settlement and our house, whilst Badger Head was some dozen
miles eastward from it. The cart, which had brought the children so
far, now went home again, and the men carried them onwards up the
steep ascent. The horses were led up, with many a perilous plunge
and desperate effort, scrambling like goats to keep a footing; and
I clambered and climbed along, brave in the resolution of well
accomplishing the task I had voluntarily undertaken, and
anticipating a succession of such difficulties, if not greater
ones. On gaining a tolerably level space, I inquired of our
servant, "How much more of the road is as steep as the last bit?"
And I began to think how much good heroism had been needlessly
aroused in me, when he replied, "Oh! ma'am, that 's all, except one
ugly gully, a few miles further on."</p>

<p>The brow of the hill we had gained commanded a most glorious
sea-view; east and west of us lay broad smooth sandy beaches,
stretching away for miles, with the long white ridges of the
in-coming tide breaking in five or six successive lines of snowy
spray; and the deep sea beyond, blue as the heavens, lay heaving
and sparkling in the sunshine. Several distant vessels were in
sight, looking not half so big as the gulls and red-bills that
circled and screamed beneath us. It was a Tasmanian version of
Edgar's gaze from Shakespeare's cliff, only lacking the samphire
gatherers.</p>

<p>The wild wide moorland tracts of the Asbestus Hills, which we
now passed over, were but thinly wooded, the chief growth being the
lesser kind of grass tree, with its tall clubs sticking up like a
vast assemblage of long rusty pokers, with the handles downwards. A
great part of the land had been recently burned, and the beds of
light ashes made a most unpleasant dust as we passed along.</p>

<p>The "ugly gully" was easily passed. Mr. Meredith, choosing to
avoid the precipitous descent commonly known, explored a new way
for us higher up, the only obstacles we found being the dense,
strong, interwoven masses of tall shrubs and ferns which completely
occupied it, and through which we pushed our way on foot, with some
exertion certainly, but with perfect success; and again walked on,
over grass-tree moorlands, as before.</p>

<p>On reaching a bright little spring of fresh water in a ravine
near the beach, about three in the afternoon, we rested to eat our
sandwiches, and determined to send back from thence our good
friend's horses, as it was then early enough for them to reach home
by dark, and if we had taken them on to the shore of Port Sorell
they must have been tethered all night in the Bush, a very sorry
guerdon for the good service they had done us!</p>

<p>We rested about an hour, and had then five miles to walk to the
point where the police boat would meet us; and, so long as we
continued on the hard smooth beach, our progress was easy and
pleasant, but an abominably rough, scrubby, soft sand-bank of a
mile wide, which we were wrongly advised to cross, instead of
following the course of the beach, was a sad fatigue and difficulty
at the end of our journey: a right gladsome sight, therefore, was
her Majesty's trim boat, lying off "Dead Man's Point," just at
twilight, ready to receive our weary party. Crossing to the police
office, we took up our abode for the night in Mr. Meredith's
private room, every member of the establishment being ready and
eager to assist and serve us; and our good old servant soon came
down from our unfinished cottage, with such a wonderful basket of
cold roast wild ducks, chicken, ham, eggs, bread, butter, and
"sundries," as proved that the new kitchen had well begun its
duties by preparing for our reception.</p>

<p>The next morning we breakfasted at Poyston, our new home, named
after my husband's birthplace in Wales. Since I had last visited
it, the exterior had been completed, and the trees cleared away
towards the sea, opening a most lovely view of the port and its
fairy islands, the bold bluff of Badger Head, the grand Asbestus
range of mountains, and the open sea; the western end of the
picture being closed by some wooded rocky points and intervening
sandy beaches.</p>

<p>My old longing for a home on the sea-coast was now realized;
and, rough as everything necessarily was at first, we enjoyed the
change from the dark forest to the bright sea-shore too intensely
to feel any trifling discomforts. Nearly all the furniture was
packed and stowed away in one room, so the first breakfast was
spread on the hall table, with packing-cases and trunks for
seats.</p>

<p>Our house, which contained large good rooms, was built of wood,
with chimneys of brick; the tall thick "slabs" were weather-boarded
on the outside, and wholly bare within as, had they been lathed and
plastered at once, their inevitable warping and shrinking would
have cracked and destroyed the plaster. The ceilings were all done
in a corduroy pattern, being neatly boarded, with a narrow batten
over each joint, and all well whitewashed; a method much more
expeditious and durable than plastering, and, in a country cottage,
by no means unsightly.</p>

<p>Our inner walls, of the bare, rough, split timber, full of gaps
and crevices, maintained a more universal system of ventilation
than even those of "Lath Hall;" yet we all remained wholly
unvisited by colds of any kind during the autumn and winter, which
passed before the cottage was finished, although, when the wind
blew from the north-east (our only exposed quarter), we could
scarcely keep candles alight in the house. Strong westerly gales
are very prevalent on this coast, but from these our cosy nest was
completely sheltered by an amphitheatre of high wooded hills
behind.</p>

<p>We kept some goats and their pretty mischievous kids, purposing
to have a large herd of them in time, both for milk and meat, cows
requiring better pasture than our sandy scrubs yielded, and the
Port Sorell mutton having a particularly unpleasant flavour,
probably from some prevailing plant eaten by the sheep. With goats
for neighbours and playfellows, it was perfectly useless to make
any attempt at gardening, until a strong close paling-fence was put
up; and this being done, and a stable, fowl-house, and goat-shed
built, we began to look quite civilized and settled in our new
home. An old gardener in the neighbourhood resolving to go to Port
Philip, we purchased his whole stock of trees, flowers,
thyme-edging, raspberry canes, strawberry plants, pot-herbs,
&amp;c., and so gave our young inclosure a two-years old aspect at
once.</p>

<p>We also commenced keeping bees, which thrive well at Port
Sorell, the abundance of sweet wild flowers there affording them
most dainty food, judging from the quality of the honey they make;
some of which, from hives kept in the Bush, far from all gardens
and ill-flavoured flowers, exceeds in fine delicate flavour any
other I ever tasted, the famed honey of Narbonne not excepted. Such
portions of the virgin honeycomb as become candied, and cut solid,
like cheese, are the nicest of all sweetmeats. Numbers of bees are
now wild in many parts of the island, and hollow trees are
frequently found in the bush filled with honeycomb.</p>

<p>Several species of wild native bees or wasps are also numerous;
and, some time ago, I wrote Home a few observations I had made on
their ways and habits, which, as they do not seem to have crept
into print, I shall insert, rather than recast the substance of the
paper anew.</p>

<p>In the warm summer days, during our residence at Port Sorell,
and more particularly in the evenings, we had often noticed a large
kind of black fly darting in and out of the house with a loud,
sharp, whizzing noise; and, on a more attentive observation, we
found a most tragic addition made to our list of antipodean
contrarieties&mdash;nothing less than the discovery of a savage and
sanguinary war carried on by flies against spiders, and pursued
with such vigour that one would believe the Tasmanian flies were
bent on avenging the tyrannies and grievances suffered at the hands
of the spiders by the whole winged-insect family all the world
over.</p>

<p>We had observed the forcible and noisy abduction of many an
unlucky web-spinner, before I could satisfactorily make out what
became of them, as the frequent seizures made, apparently by the
same fly, forbade the conclusion that they were forthwith devoured;
but, by dint of sundry watchings and pursuits of the flies, and by
eking out and piecing together my various small scraps of
information and discovery, I at length acquired a tolerable
knowledge of the habits and practices of my busy black
neighbours.</p>

<p>In size and shape they exactly resemble a large English wasp,
but are wholly black, and possess formidable stings, a quarter of
an inch long. They build very remarkable cells or nests of earth,
finely tempered, and formed in layers of tiny mud-pats, like a
swallow's nest. Many of these were placed in a small wooden
out-house, between the upright studs and the weather-boarding of
the wall; several were formed on a shelf in the porch, where some
small pieces of wood lying heaped together offered convenient
nooks; and one wasp, resolving to have a more costly lodgment than
his friends, took possession of a meerschaum pipe-bowl which lay on
the same shelf, and very snugly laid out his house in its interior.
All the nests I have examined are arranged in the same manner, the
whole fabric being from two to four inches long, and rather less
than an inch broad; the external shape of the mansion, whether
square, triangular, or pentagonal, depending a good deal on the
site chosen. When completed, no aperture is left; but on being
opened, three or four cells are usually found, two or three
containing each a soft white chrysalis in a cocoon of white web,
and the largest apartment of the mansion is devoted to the purposes
of a larder, and is always found full of spiders, of all varieties
of size, colour, and kind, all closely and neatly packed together,
with their legs trussed up, so as to occupy the smallest possible
space. The strangest part of the affair is, that the spiders are
not dead, but remain perfectly soft and flexible in every part;
and, on being exposed to the sun and air, and stirred, a feeble
movement is evident in them, as though they were paralysed or
stupefied in some manner, so as to be unresisting victims and good
fresh meat at the same time. The store-house is thus well supplied,
doubtless for the benefit of the chrysalis tenantry, on their
awakening to the knowledge of life and appetite.</p>

<p>I have rarely been more interested by any new insect than by
these black wasps, ungentle and ferocious though they be; for there
is a daring dashing energy and brisk industry about their ways and
doings that is very amusing and perfectly original. The bee&mdash;dear
little hard-working persevering fellow that he is&mdash;can still afford
time for many a coquettish peep into blossoms and buds that he
deigns not to taste; and, even when arrived at home with his two
pannier-baskets loaded with their heaped-up golden treasure, can
stay for a few moments' friendly hovering to and fro, and pleasant
exchanges of hum and buzz with his helpmates. The ant&mdash;whose ways
of thrift and industry even Solomon bids us to "consider and be
wise"&mdash;never takes a straight road, but with a lump of plunder in
her nippers thrice her own size, runs hither and thither, up straws
and round sticks, or may be into a labyrinth of a violet root,
where she plays at bo-peep with you for ten minutes before going
forward again, and seems to get on in such a perversely round-about
way, that I have only been cured of my inclination to put her
straight, by the conviction (after many trials, when anxiously
striving to trace out the marauders of my bee-hives) of the utter
hopelessness of such attempts.</p>

<p>But the black wasp has none of these wandering weaknesses of
character: solitary, stern, ruthless, and resolute, he goes about
his work of cell-building and spider-catching. If you chance to be
near his chosen place of abode, you may see him dart past with a
bit of mud or a victim, and a shrill sharp <i>whizz-izz-izz</i> is
continued for some seconds or a minute, during the operation of
packing away his load, when forth he darts again, straight and
swift as an arrow, and the next moment very probably invades the
peaceful retreat of some cobwebbed recluse, who until now, safe
from brooms and housemaids, has meshed and devoured his flies in
comfort, but is at length seized, trussed, and packed up
half-alive, by the dark avenger.</p>

<p>The varieties of wasps or wasp-like flies, which we noticed
around Poyston, were very numerous. One is marked with alternate
black and golden stripes, very similar to the English wasp, but
more soft and downy-looking. Another is red, long and slender, with
four long wings and a prodigious sting, which it can protrude
nearly half an inch from a kind of double sheath beneath the tail.
Another species, partially red, frequented the sandy paths of the
garden, where several of them were generally seen darting along,
flying straight up and down the walks. I have often followed them
nearly round the garden, without their ever quitting the path, or
rising more than a foot from the surface. Sometimes they would stop
at a hole in the sand, possibly their nest, and after poking down
into it, head foremost and tail up, for a minute or more, they made
a great skurry of dust over the opening, so as entirely to conceal
it, and flew on again.</p>

<p>Without enumerating many more members of this family, of whom I
know little more than their outward aspect, I shall mention one
more, which has interested me nearly as much as the architect wasp
first described, and has caused me to waste infinitely more time in
vain attempts to pry more narrowly into its domestic privacy.</p>

<p>At "Lath Hall" I had been annoyed to find that the multiflora
rose-trees which adorned the veranda, had, towards autumn, become
quite disfigured, by having large round pieces scalloped out of
nearly every leaf; five or six great scallops being made in each,
leaving the middle fibre entire. First I attributed the mischief to
caterpillars, and then to grass-hoppers, but never found any on the
trees. At length the frequent buzzing of a large bee-like fly
attracted my attention; and on watching its movements I detected it
in the act of snipping out a piece of rose-leaf, rolling it up,
grasping it in its legs, and flying off. After this I observed the
work going on in the same manner daily for some time. Plants,
raised from cuttings of these same rose-trees, grew around the
porch at Poyston, and these were used by the same busy workmen in
the same manner, besides other kinds of roses, and the leaves of
the cherry, acacia, and other trees. This wasp or bee has a pair of
forceps, acting precisely like scissors; and very many times I have
closely observed him snipping out, with a quick clean cut, the
piece of leaf, which is usually about the third of an inch broad
and long. Six or eight seconds suffice for the cutting, when the
piece of leaf is most nimbly and adroitly rolled up and clasped by
the feet and legs, as the wasp flies away. I have frequently
started off when the wasps took flight, and given chase to them,
hoping to find out whither all the leaves were carried, and how
they were used; but the depredators always proved too clever for
me, and glanced out of sight, leaving me to come panting back
again, vainly vowing to be more agile and sharp-sighted next
time.</p>

<p>Having often found these insects busy gathering honey, I
imagined they must have a hoard or nest somewhere near, but never
found any. An intelligent young person who lived with me at this
time as nursery governess told me she had often found the nests,
which were holes in the ground, filled with bits of leaves, in
which small portions of some sweet sticky stuff were folded up and
stuck together, only one or two wasps seeming to inhabit each hole.
This species, like all my other acquaintances of the wasp-kind
here, has a long sting, and precisely the head and antennae of the
English wasp.</p>

<p>A totally different species from any of these frequented the
wide sandy sea-beaches at Fort Sorell; these latter were large
bulky formidable insects, with great stings like the others, and
were often seen on a warm day, darting about in twos and threes,
just above the surface of the sand. One of them would sometimes
hover over the same spot for a minute or two, when another would
suddenly dart to the place, and the first wasp instantly took up
his station at some distance, hovering as before, until he either
displaced another, or was superseded in his turn; and the same
dance of "change sides and back again" went on as long as we
watched them; but what they were doing, or how they got their
living, remained an undiscoverable mystery to me.</p>

<p>It is only just to all these long-stinged wasps, to add, that
neither we nor our children nor servants were ever stung by any of
the fraternity, although we frequently chased and captured them for
examination; but always with a due dread of their threatening
weapons of defence, and a careful restoration of their liberty when
our curiosity was satisfied.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Fish.&mdash;The
Blue-head.&mdash;Sting-ray.&mdash;Bathing.&mdash;Crabs.&mdash;Shells.&mdash;Echini.&mdash;Starfish.&mdash;Sea
Anemones.&mdash;Handsome Cuttle-fish.&mdash;Jelly-fish, &amp;c.&mdash;A Marine
Mrs. Gamp.&mdash;Elephant-fish.</p>

<p>One luxury which we enjoyed at Poyston was an abundance of
excellent fish, with which the old fisherman supplied us twice or
thrice a week, to our mutual advantage, for he had few good
customers besides, and the impossibility of obtaining even
tolerably good meat or poultry rendered the addition of fish to our
bill of fare a great acquisition. Excellent flounders (of a much
better kind than I remember at Home,) a few soles and guard-fish,
plenty of fine bream, and quantities of flat-heads, composed the
general assortment, which now and then included a few oysters, but
not any crayfish.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith and George often went out fishing in our own nice
little boat, the "Sea Egg," but they seldom found wind, and tide,
and time, and all other marine influences so propitious as to do
much injury to old Donald's trade, a few flat-heads or blue-heads,
or a young shark, being their usual booty.</p>

<p>The blue-head is among fish what the rose-hill parakeet is among
birds, a miracle of gay colours. It is a large thick fish, with
patches of the most vivid blue and orange about the head, and
touches of crimson, green, &amp;c., in other parts. It is not very
good eating, being, when cooked, almost as soft and watery as
mashed turnips.</p>

<p>Great numbers of small sharks were often seen in the port, close
in-shore, in such shallow water that we have thought they must be
soon aground; and legions of the great ugly sting-rays were always
gliding about, now and then turning up their finny elbows as they
passed by us or hurried after their prey. Some of them were of an
enormous size, and once our boat grounded on one, and it was only
when the living island swam away that it was discovered not to be a
shoal. We frequently watched numbers of these great fish in the
clear channels, looking, when lying motionless, like black rocks,
or masses of kelp, and sometimes moving so slowly as still to
deceive the eye, whilst at other times dozens and scores of them
would come close by us, in water only deep enough to cover
them.</p>

<p>The long barbed bone or "sting" in the tail of these unsightly
creatures is from three to six or eight inches long, and capable of
inflicting a fearful wound, each of the numerous barbs being jagged
at both edges like the teeth of a saw, and lacerating frightfully
where it strikes. No savage warrior ever invented a more horrible
weapon, and I think some of the hideous implements of destruction
brought from the South Sea Islands are made upon its model. A poor
man near Port Sorell, in trying to catch some sting-ray by driving
them on shore, had one of the stings struck through his thigh, and
broken there, and it was with considerable danger cut out, having
passed close to one of the great arteries.</p>

<p>Fortunately, neither sharks nor sting-rays ever visited us when
bathing, a luxury we enjoyed to perfection here. Mr. Meredith had a
large rustic bower of wattled boughs built for my use on a great
flat rock, which made an admirable 'tiring-room, in a sheltered and
retired nook of our pretty bay, where we could almost pluck
flowering shrubs with one hand, and fish out sea-weed with the
other. At first I fear the sea-gulls, as they flew over, must
sometimes have been scared by piteous cries from within of "Don't
put <i>me</i> in, mamma, please don't!" but these vain
remonstrances soon ceased, and the plaintive voices changed to
joyous shouts, as my young ones splashed about like wild ducks, to
the grave amazement of the baby, who watched such terrible
proceedings with evident apprehension.</p>

<p>Many a pleasant day was spent in long walks or rides, or boating
expeditions in the neighbourhood, and scarcely one passed without
our rambling on the beach. The three children spent half their days
there winning bright eyes, rosy cheeks, and untold baskets of ocean
treasures&mdash;shells, corals, and kelp, which were afterwards strewn
around the house in all directions. The ever faithful Dick was
their constant playmate, and also a black Newfoundland dog, named
Pluto, who at first, when a soft fat puppy, used to ride down to
the sands with Charlie in his little carriage, and after growing a
great powerful dog, would good-naturedly insist on helping to pull
it himself, and a rope was tied on for him, which he took in his
mouth, and trotted along with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>At certain times of the tide, the broad beach used to he covered
with little purple crabs, as busy stuffing sand into their
waistcoat pockets as my old friends of the Homebush drains; and
after the crabs had finished their odd repast, the surface of the
beach was seen thickly strewn with tiny round pellets of sand, the
size of duck-shot, showing how vast an amount of labour the busy
little things had accomplished, to be all washed out again by the
next wave. We were all careful not to crush the poor crabs, and
often they were so thick as to make it difficult to avoid them.
Pluto, who was not troubled with philanthropy, used to distress the
children by squashing the little animals with his great paws, or
picking them up in his huge mouth to play with; whilst our
beautiful Dick kept us in constant alarm lest, with his
indefatigable nose, he should hunt out the sea-birds' nests, that
we knew were close around, and disturb or kill the young ones,
which it was our great delight to have safely reared, and added to
our beach companions.</p>

<p>One most noble shell is sometimes found on this coast, a species
of volute or <i>Cymhiola</i>, ten inches or more in length, and
five or six in diameter, of a shaded buff colour, beautifully
marked with zigzag lines of brown, smooth on the outside, and
highly polished within, with three plaits on the columella, and the
outer lip thin and sharp. I have only seen five of these shells,
three of which I procured myself. One had been dead some time,
being covered with serpula inside; the other two had not so long
parted from their inhabitants as to have also lost the odour which
their remains had left behind, and were fresh handsome shells.</p>

<p>Sometimes we found a few smaller volutes of the same kind as at
Swan Port, but usually more perfect, being alive; occasionally we
captured a lovely Venus, in a marvellous array of ridges and
spikes. At some seasons the beach abounded with fine brown
date-muscles, alive also, and the <i>Haliotis</i>,
<i>Sigaretus</i>, and <i>Stomatella</i> were also found, the former
abundantly, and often very large.</p>

<p>A delicate species of <i>Terebratula</i> lived on the reefs,
some distance below low-water mark, and I obtained a few live
shells, bat never found any cast on the sands. One most beautiful
<i>Trigonia</i> was given to me, as having been picked up on the
Badger Head beach, but I was never so fortunate as to find another
there.</p>

<p>Coralines abounded, the same as those of Swan Port, and a far
greater quantity of the delicate lace-coral, in pieces from two to
six or eight inches broad, but too brittle to bear packing.
Occasionally, but only rarely, a piece of beautiful pink coral
appeared among the common kinds.</p>

<p>Several species of <i>Echini</i> frequented the reefs around us,
and in the summer we often invaded their bright rocky pools, to
make acquaintance with them. At low tide we could run across the
wide sands on to several of the reefs, with merely wetting our feet
(which no true sea-side scrambler ever pauses to think about,
albeit a fearful extension of shoemakers' bills is the result); and
then most delightful was it to peer down through the clear water of
the countless basins and hollows in the rocks, and see whole
families of <i>Echini</i>, all unconscious of our alarming
presence, rolling to and fro on their ever-moving <i>chevaux de
frise</i> of spines, and various species of star-fish, some with
short arms, some with long ones, and many with no arms at all, but
with merely obtuse corners to their pentagon or hexagon shapes, all
most brilliant in colour, and shining amidst floating kelp and
through the sunny water, like great marigolds, poppies, and purple
anemones; whilst the real sea-anemones, of many bright colours,
clustered up and down the rocks, those above water closed up, and
looking like the transparent red lollipops which children call
"cherries," and the submerged ones spreading out their filmy rays
like starry flowers, the mimic petals or arms of which clasp
tightly around an intruding finger, as if believing it to be some
dainty jelly-fish or other pleasant comestible. I have often
watched both these <i>Actinia</i> and the star-fish eating soft
jelly-like sea creatures, and have marvelled at the celerity with
which they dispatched their meal.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith and George once found some very beautiful
<i>Asteriae</i> on one of the reefs, and carried one home to me;
but, despite all their care, it was very much broken before it
arrived. The body, hexagonal in shape, was not larger than a
shilling, but the arms were at least twelve inches long, and not
more than an eighth of an inch broad, consisting of one series of
small shelly scales or plates, with two short feelers to each
scale; each arm looking like a very long centipede. Although so
much injured, it moved when touched, and then emitted a bright pale
blue phosphoric light, which trembled all over it for several
seconds, but became gradually fainter, till it was no longer
emitted. We never found the same species again.</p>

<p>Very many of the black sea-slugs, or sea-hares, whose shell is
known as the <i>Parmophorus Australis</i>, also dwelt in our
reef-pools, and dead shells were often thrown on the beach. The
airy shells of a beautiful <i>Spatangus</i>, as thin and white as
cambric paper, were also very plentiful, but I never found the
creature within them, though very curious to see the animal which
could inhabit an abode so fragile that I could scarcely breathe
upon it without wafting it away, although some were the size of a
good orange.</p>

<p>During one of our boating expeditions to the islands, we found a
very handsome individual of a very ugly family, being a species of
cuttle-fish, in a coat of bright salmon-colour, profusely trimmed
and embroidered with brown, and the multitudinous arms each dotted
with two lines of buttons (i.e., <i>suckers</i>) as thickly as the
jacket of a lady's page. We tried to send this creature out from
his bower of kelp into clearer water, to gain a better view of him;
but his extraordinary arms always reappeared where we least
expected them, and seemed to be many feet in length, gliding and
writhing amidst the kelp forest like a colony of snakes. Some time
afterwards I found a smaller specimen of the same creature washed
ashore on the sands, and, as it was still alive, I carried it to a
deep rocky pool that it might recover; but the horrible sensation
of all the strong suckers fastening round my bared wrist and hand
was only just endurable, and I gladly felt it loosen its tenacious
hold, and glide off into the water.</p>

<p>At some seasons the beach used to be thickly strewn with what
are called "jelly-fish," left by the receding tide; most of them
being the size of a large dinner plate, and not unlike a great mass
of encrusted glass, with a large star pattern within, of pink or
purple. When seen swimming they resemble an expanded umbrella, with
a cluster of long fringed arms extending from its convex centre.
During a short voyage in Bass's Straits, the myriads I have seen of
these jelly umbrellas were perfectly astonishing; every wave
passing the vessel contained five or six, and their bright soft
irridescent colours of pink, purple, blue, and crimson, seen
glancing in the rapid water, were most beautiful.</p>

<p>Several species of curious bony fish are found at Port Sorell.
One, about four inches long, is called the dog fish, from the
accurate resemblance which its head bears to that of a pointer.
Another, which we named the porcupine fish, is about eight inches
long, and is armed all over with sharp strong spines. We preserved
some of these excellently by suspending them by a thread, near an
ant-hill, and in a short time all the skin and form of the fish
became dry and hard, whilst the busy little insects had disposed of
all the more perishable matter.</p>

<p>One very singular fish, the size and shape of a large egg
somewhat compressed at the sides, was arrayed in a complete suit of
white bony armour, beautifully embossed and engraved, with sharp
fins and tail, and a mouth like a small whistle. It is sometimes
found dead and dry among the heaps of old kelp and shells on the
sand-banks, but I never saw one either alive or fresh.</p>

<p>A large skeleton of a hideously ugly fish, which none of us
knew, was brought me by one of the constables (all of whom used to
do their best to contribute to my heterogeneous collections of
oddities). Its heavy bony head was more than half of the whole
fish, with a large under-jawed bull-dog mouth, and the body
tapering sharply off from it, being altogether about two feet long.
Mr. Meredith said it somewhat resembled a fish called by whalers
"an Old Nurse," and then we decided that it must be the Mrs. Gamp
of the ocean. If my lame description is unintelligible to the
ichthyologically learned, I can direct them to an admirable
portrait of my ugly friend, in Cruikshank's Comic Almanack for
1843, for he has drawn it to the life, in the astonished fish which
rushes full in the light from his submarine steamer, to gaze upon
the portentous visitant with supercilious indignation.</p>

<p>On passing our fisherman's hut one morning, we found him quite
busy, wheeling in a quantity of unsaleable fish to enrich his
little potato garden, and we detained one, of a kind new to us, to
examine. It was a large fish, nearly three feet in length, and
about five inches deep, with a singular bony head, from which a
narrow bony process extended in front, like a very prominent Roman
nose, with a turn-up at the point of it; from the end of this hung,
outspread, a soft fleshy heart-shaped membrane, three or more
inches long. The mouth was placed at some distance behind this
pendulous apparatus, which looked like a bait, with which this odd
fish was perpetually angling for himself. A long, strong, sharp
spine proceeded from the front of the dorsal fin; and the vertebrae
continued through the upper lobe of the tail, tapering finely to
the end. I have rarely seen a more singular fish.</p>

<p>We continued to improve our pleasant sea-side home in various
ways, by enlarging the house and garden, by having our rooms
plastered and papered, by making some log-bridges across watery
hollows in the sand bank, for our winter walks to the beach, and by
marking an avenue through the wood, in the direction of the police
station, which was partly cleared at our own expense, and partly by
the occasional labour of watch-house prisoners; and, when
completed, opened a beautiful vista, ending in a distant view of
the station, and the woods and mountains behind, as shown in my
little sketch from our garden, shown below.</p>

<p class="caption">View from the Garden, Poyston.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Port Sorell vessels (small schooners and
cutters of from fifteen to forty tons) added considerably to the
life and interest of our sea view, especially when any friend or
long-expected package was known to be on board; and as the reefs
and channels of the entrance to the port are rather intricate, we
frequently watched the little craft with great anxiety.</p>

<p>We took great interest in a small schooner, which the builder of
our cottage (a generally useful native genius) commenced after
nearly finishing our house; <i>perfect</i> completion of a task we
found was impossible to him.</p>

<p>The "Hope" cutter, which I have before mentioned, was also the
work and property of our worthy neighbour, but she had been sent to
sea at first without a rudder-case, and sailed without that
apparently indispensable appendage ever afterwards. His new
schooner was very cleverly and accurately modelled after the brig
"Scout," formerly a slaver, and the fastest sailing vessel in these
colonies. We could readily distinguish her from all the other ships
seen passing through the Straits, bound for, or leaving Launceston,
by her superior speed, and were much grieved lately to learn that
the beautiful vessel had been wrecked.</p>

<p>We often visited our ingenious neighbour to see how his vessel
got on, and anticipated the launch with great interest; but, as I
fully expected, something was left undone, or was not done quite
enough, in the laying down of the "ways," and instead of dashing
boldly into the water, when we were all assembled to see her, the
gallant "Harriet" stuck fast, and was unsatisfactorily and
ingloriously shoved off in the evening tide, with no one to look at
her.</p>

<p>Having by means of the "Mosquito craft" of the vicinity constant
opportunities of communication with Launceston, we commenced
subscribing to a library there, which, although not very extensive,
seemed to promise us a twelvemonth's supply of reading; but after
exchanging our books about four times, and sending in vain for
more, I discovered that our supply was finally cut off; the whole
collection of books having been sold by auction! and we were once
more reduced to the chance volumes we could borrow, and our own
rare and scanty acquisitions from Home.</p>

<p>When living in a new country, and in great measure apart from
the advantages of civilized life, it is no small solace and
pleasure to possess the habit, apparently so natural, but in
reality very rare (at least <i>here</i>), of deriving interest and
amusement from the perusal of whatever page of the great book of
Nature lies open to us; and strange indeed must be our destiny, if
we are ever without some instructive and wondrous passage before
us, telling of the beneficence and wisdom of Him who alike hath
fixed the track of the mysterious comet through the illimitable
immensity of space, and decreed the shape in which the little bees
shall make their tiny cells!</p>

<p>In old countries, where every change of season, every
successively-opening flower, and every insect that flutters the
frailest wing in the sunshine, has attracted the study of
naturalists and philosophers for centuries, we can always refer to
books for information respecting all that interests us, or excites
our curiosity. But here, if we would learn from Nature, we must
strive to read her own untranslated history, and no one who has not
tried can tell how pleasant a book it is. Sometimes, it is true, we
should like a book of reference, when some quite new bird or flower
proves too profound an enigma for our small acquirements. Such was
a lovely little creature like a large humming-bird, which came
daily to suck honey from the trumpet-flowers of the
<i>Ecremocarpus</i> creeper round our porch and garden fence. It
never perched, but remained on the wing, hovering and sipping the
honey with its long hairy tongue, and uttering a low murmuring
sound as it skimmed about. Its plumage was chiefly brown and fawn
colour, with a long beardlike shadow on the throat. I was quite
glad to see the <i>Ecremocarpus</i> honey made useful to something,
for I had often thought it a pity that the mouth of the flower was
too small for the entrance of a bee, whilst so well stored with
sweets; and the little bird came as if on purpose to show me that
all in Nature must he right and good.</p>

<p>A pair of little gems of diamond birds had their nest in the
bank near our cottage. Mr. Meredith found the hole one day, and
thought it belonged to a snake, but whilst peeping about it, one of
the alarmed little birds flew out, almost in his face. We visited
it several times afterwards and, on looking steadily into the dark
little nest, could just discern the baby-birds within, and often
saw the beautiful little parent pair flying or creeping in and
out</p>

<p>Some gigantic dragon flies, larger than the diamond birds, often
visited us; and had, I imagine, emerged from their former more
humble condition of existence in our fish-pond, as we saw many in
its vicinity. I always admired their handsome tribe, but was rather
shocked one day to see a very large one snap up a poor
heavily-laden bee, and fly off with it Had I seen many such
captures, a declaration of war against the great dragon flies must
have followed, but it was a solitary outrage, so far as I know.</p>

<p>Numbers of my old favourites, the gorgeously-attired green
frogs, also abode in our pond and brook, and in warm summer days
were wont to bathe luxuriously in the sunshine, with their moist
gold-threaded heads and backs, and great calm eyes, gleaming like
jewels; and as they sit thus, they keep up a kind of friendly
conversational croak with each other, each exclamation being
apparently the result of great effort. The speaker suddenly
collapses his portly body, and at the same instant inflates a large
white speckled pouch beneath the under jaw, which expands to the
size of a small hen's-egg, whilst the croak is going on&mdash;the sound
and the inflation ceasing together; and in the space of a minute
the process begins again. The appearance of a party of frogs thus
conversing, seated a few feet apart, over a pond or lagune, is most
gravely ridiculous; but a spectator must wait for some time,
motionless and silent, before the discourse begins, the approach of
any noise or movement, however slight, causing the whole solemn
assembly to plop under water.</p>

<p>To our favourite household troops of goats, horses, dogs, cats,
tame swans, and poultry, we had now rather a droll addition in a
flock of tame rabbits, the progeny of one pair given to the
children by our gardener. These had for some time been kept in a
hutch, but we decided on giving them their liberty, and had a
capacious cage made of paling for them at one corner of our
paddock, and put them in it, with a daily supply of food, intending
that they should burrow out into the Bush and go free, but still
have their safe cage as a retreat from dogs or other molestations.
They very soon availed themselves of the liberty we gave them, and
scratched their way out, but, instead of going into the Bush,
straightway came back and took up their abode under the kitchen,
burrowing an entrance beneath the massive wooden sleepers, and no
doubt finding a warm and roomy apartment ready for their reception,
as the floor of the kitchen was raised above a foot from the level
ground. Here they continued to live, and bred numbers of young
ones, which were of all colours, though the old pair were black,
and in the evening, a troop of all sizes, black, brown, gray, buff,
and white, used to come out and frolic all about us: the old ones
were so tame as to jump into our laps as we sat down; and very
often used in play to scratch the children's faces, who had taught
them to take bread from their lips. The young ones very rapidly
spread abroad, and colonized the whole neighbourhood. We, or rather
our spaniel, Dick, found several at one or two miles distance from
home. Our garden was so well fenced that only very juvenile bunnies
could gain admittance there, and as we had not anything else they
could possibly injure, and abundance of food for them, we greatly
enjoyed our novel kind of rabbit-warren; the only trouble connected
with it being our constant fear lest strangers coming to the house
should inadvertently tread upon our bold little favourites, which
were always trooping about.</p>

<p>The poor old doe fell a victim to the kittenish propensity for
play of an Arab colt we had; he used to run after everything, and
pawed over dogs, fowls, or anything he could overtake, as a kitten
would a ball, and in an unhappy hour, with one playful stroke of
his fore-foot, broke a hind leg of our old bunny, so that we were
compelled, after ineffectual attempts to set the bone, to let our
poor pet be killed as an act of mercy. We never before kept tame
rabbits, but these free and sociable ones were exceedingly
interesting, and their evening gambols, when the whole family party
was assembled, were most graceful and diverting.</p>

<p>I had one day a most unwelcome present brought to me by one of
our constables, who, poor man, had taken infinite pains to obtain
it, but had wofully mistaken what he conceived to be my wishes in
the matter. Hearing that I wanted to procure an owl, he brought me
a most magnificent one, but alas! it was dead, and my wish was to
have one, or, still better, a pair, alive, to put them in
undisturbed possession of two great lofts in the gabled roof of our
house, where they and their progeny might benefit us and themselves
by carrying on the mousing business, and gratify us occasionally by
a glimpse of their ghostly shapes winnowing silently around in the
twilight.</p>

<p>The poor dead bird was a most noble specimen of his order, about
fifteen inches in height, and of a broad comely figure, with the
proper great heart-face, and very large eyes; the plumage gray and
fawn-colour, barred with brown, beautifully soft and downy.</p>

<p>I since had one of the small Tasmanian owls alive, and kept it
for some months, feeding it on mice, birds, and raw meat, but I
could not tame it in the least. It tore and bit any one it could
reach, and always greeted our approach with a savage
<i>chop-chopping</i> of its beak, that sounded most defiant and
ferocious. It was a very handsome bird, six or seven inches high,
with dark plumage, and very quick, savagely-bright eyes. Finding I
could not by any means render it sociable and friendly, I
determined to set it free, hoping it might possibly remain about
the house or garden; but the emancipation, so kindly meant, proved
fatal. Unaccustomed to procure food for itself, and teased and
attacked by crowds of other birds, it sat moping in a high tree for
a day or two, until pecked blind, and almost in pieces; and I only
recovered my perverse pet in time to see it expire in its old
cage.</p>

<p>The Mawpawk, More Pork, or Mope Hawk, is common in most parts of
the colony, and utters its peculiar two-syllable cry at night, very
constantly. Its habits are those of the owl, and its rather hawkish
appearance partakes also of the peculiarities of the goat-sucker
tribe. The bird is ten or twelve inches long, and the head forms
more than a third of this; the mouth, bristling with strong
whiskers, opens to the very back of the head, and displays a
cavern, apparently capable of accommodating a whole family of mice
at once. The eyes are large and hawk-like, the plumage dark and
dusky, and the bird's flight is silent as that of the owl. We often
listen to them at night, as they answer each other's cry, sometimes
from a tree close beside us, and then from the distant woods. The
sound does not really resemble the words "more pork," any more than
"cuckoo," and it is more like the "tu-whoo" of the owl than
either.</p>

<p>The summer bush fires in these forest regions sometimes rage to
a fearful extent, from the great masses of dead wood, bark, and
scrub which accumulate though successive seasons. During our abode
at "Lath Hall" I once suffered great alarm from the very near
approach of the bush fires, which, in those dense and lofty
forests, have a most terrific appearance, as the volumes of lurid
smoke come rolling onwards, and tree after tree bursts into flame;
whilst the frequent thundering fall of some mighty trunk, and the
crackling and hissing of the blazing mass, are as terrible to hear
as to behold. By anticipating the approach of the great body of
fire, and carefully burning and beating out the low scrub, ferns,
and grass beside fences, or for a considerable breadth in the
probable track of the conflagration, any serious mischief may
frequently be prevented; but when a high wind prevails at the same
time, immense flakes of fire are carried along by it, and falling
in distant places, or perchance on thatched roofs, spread the
devastation with terrible rapidity.</p>

<p>We had on one occasion a fearful drive home from the house of a
friend with whom we had spent the day, and during our stay one of
these tremendous forest fires had traversed the road we had to
repass in returning, leaving the whole country in flames. As we
drove along, great burning trees came toppling and crashing down on
both sides, and some fell directly across our track, compelling us
to make a dtour in the Bush, where we feared the horses would burn
their feet in the hot ashes, the terror of the poor animals
increasing our own peril not a little. The air was like a furnace
and thick with smoke, and fiery fragments of leaves, sticks, and
bark were falling around and about us. I have not often felt more
awed by any impending danger than during that scorching drive, nor
more devoutly thankful for our preservation than when at last we
emerged from the terrible dominions of the tyrannical Fire King,
into the cool olive-green avenue of our forest road, and once more
breathed air instead of smoke.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith was absent from home when the bush fires in the
near vicinity of Poyston seemed to me threatening its speedy
destruction, and my intense terror was consequently uncomforted by
his better experience; nor was I aware at the time, that he had,
before leaving home, taken the wise precaution of burning the ferns
over the whole of a wide span of forest land around us, although I
knew it had been partially done. The appearance of the
rapidly-advancing fire was indeed such as to appal a stouter heart
than mine, when at last, after many disregarded entreaties from my
frightened women servants, I went out to look at it. Overhead, a
thick black rolling cloud of fire-speckled smoke shut out the sky;
and behind, the mighty array of flames whence it came rose high
over the tallest of those giant trees, in tongues and spears of red
blaze, bright even at noonday, and wreathed about the trunks and
branches, devouring every leaf and fragment of bark as it went
crackling on. The wind blew the fire directly towards our
apparently devoted house, which, almost wholly composed of resinous
wood, dry as tinder after the summer's heat, would have burnt like
touch-paper. I began to count up our carpets and blankets,
intending to have them all soaked in the brook, and laid over the
roof to prevent its becoming ignited by the falling flakes, and I
had our small stock of gunpowder ready to bury in the garden, under
the camp oven, if the danger increased. The two men servants went
to beat out the fire so as to prevent its crossing a narrow gully
at the back of our inclosure, and I dispatched George and the
nurse-girl to the police station for more men to help them, the
fire meanwhile evidently making rapid progress, and the horrid
crackling becoming louder and nearer.</p>

<p>A reinforcement from the station, of the district constable and
two others, enabled our party to spread out so as to keep a wide
extent of the ground-fire under control, but not without having
their clothes burned in the effort, and I had my share of active
business in serving out tea, grog, and flannel shirts. A sudden
shift of the wind providentially aided our endeavours and, before
night, the body of the fire was raging onwards in a different
direction, but still leaving so much behind as to render a
night-watch requisite; nor did we feel quite safe until the
following evening, when the alarming appearances had to a great
degree subsided.</p>

<p>These extensive fires must no doubt destroy great numbers of
snakes; and if they were of no other service, that alone would
plead their pardon for many mischievous deeds. The poor opossums,
too, I fear, must suffer martyrdom in crowds, and quantities of
small vermin and insects; but the chief service of the bush fires
is the rapid and wholesome consumption of heaps of vegetable
matter, that would otherwise accumulate to excess on such rich damp
soil and, in their slow process of decomposition, fill the air with
unhealthy vapours.</p>

Resignation.&mdash;Removal.&mdash;Voyage.&mdash;Contrary Breeze.&mdash;Great
Peril.&mdash;Anchor at George Town.&mdash;Overland Journey to Swan
Port.&mdash;Arrival of the Harriet.&mdash;Riversdale.-Improvements.&mdash;The
Veranda.&mdash;Pigeons and Fowls.&mdash;Plenty without
Profit.&mdash;Conclusion.</p>

<p>The apparently uncertain continuance of all police appointments
in the colony, and the strong inducements we had to return to Swan
Port, at length decided us in favour of a removal from Port Sorell.
Mr. Meredith sent in his resignation of the police magistracy
accordingly, and had the gratification of receiving, both from his
Excellency Lieutenant-Governor Sir. W. T. Denison, and from the
Chief Police Magistrate, flattering testimonies of their high
estimation and approval of his past services, and kind expressions
of regret that they were to cease.</p>

<p>As we had to transport ourselves, children, and servants,
together with our furniture, horses, dogs, bees, favourite fowls,
and other matters&mdash;a very menagerie of clanjamphry&mdash;Mr. Meredith
engaged our graceful friend the "Harriet" schooner to convey us
direct to Swan Port, all but the horses, which were sent overland
with the groom; my own especial gray Arab and her pretty foal
having been carefully taken across previously.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith's successor at Port Sorell gladly agreed to
purchase our house, land, &amp;c.; our preparations for departure
were, therefore, very speedily effected, although not without many
regrets at leaving our comfortable home, and its most beautiful
sea-view, which, so far from becoming indifferent to us, by long
use, seemed ever to acquire some new charm.</p>

<p>Yet, having once rooted ourselves up, ready for a
transplantation, delays became provoking, and after waiting two
days on board, and receiving more "last visits" from the few valued
friends we were leaving behind, we finally set sail, on a day
universally considered of ill omen&mdash;in seafaring matters, at
least&mdash;on Friday evening, February 22, 1848. Our good neighbour,
the builder and owner of the vessel, had at the eleventh hour
suddenly relinquished his intention of going with us, and left the
command to a very unworthy representative, a careless, lazy fellow,
lately hired, whose chief vocation seemed to be dozing and smoking,
and who could not even rouse himself enough to get out of the port
at high water, but dawdled about on shore until we very narrowly
escaped another night's detention, and, by some mismanagement in
the narrowest and most dangerous part of the intricate channel
amongst the reefs and islands were, for a short time, in
considerable peril.</p>

<p>The following morning, when Mr. Meredith went on deck, hoping to
find that we had made good progress during the night, as we had had
a fair breeze the evening before,&mdash;what was his annoyance to
discern that our lazy "skipper" had afterwards hove the vessel to,
and gone to sleep, during the greater part of the night, and so
lost us at least thirty or forty miles of our voyage.</p>

<p>By the time I thought of rising we were making tolerable way
through the Straits, and the vessel's motion had become so
unpleasantly lively, that I found it desirable to make my ascent to
the deck as quickly as possible, and try to ward off the
approaching return of indisposition. My nursemaid, as a matter of
course, was totally useless, having given herself up a voluntary,
or at all events an unresisting victim, to sea-sickness, and lay on
the deck refusing all aid or remedy; so Mr. Meredith and our good
old servant-man made their first essay in the nursery department by
putting George and Charlie into their respective garments, but with
an ingenious variation of back and front, tapes and buttons, which
did infinite credit to their powers of invention. However, I was
very thankful even for such aid, baby Owen's toilet being quite as
much as I could safely undertake myself. The poor children were all
very ill, and nothing but a most resolute determination saved me
from sharing the same fate. I sat on deck all day, facing the fresh
breeze, nursing the baby, and endeavouring to keep every thought
busy with the passing clouds, the distant shore, the shoals of
strange jelly-fish sailing along beside us, or anything, rather
than suffer myself to admit the real truth, that I felt very far
from well; and thus I continued all day without becoming worse.</p>

<p>The wind had been veering round for some hours, and at last
settled to a strong breeze from the north-east, the most directly
adverse point for us. We passed "Tenth Island" and "Ninth," or
"Gun-carriage Island," both of them barren and rocky, with low
scrub and sand; and we were very anxious to reach "Waterhouse
Island," where we could anchor safely, until a change of wind
enabled us to weather Cape Portland, and then a breeze from any
point of the compass, except due south, would carry us down the
east coast to Oyster Bay. But the contrary breeze grew yet stronger
towards night, and the vessel pitched and rolled horribly; the
children suffered exceedingly, and poor Charlie, who had only
recently recovered from a dangerous illness, became seriously ill
and exhausted. The vessel, perfect as were her form and sailing
capacities, had she been properly rigged, had only her fore and aft
canvas, without square sails, and could not therefore be properly
worked, even by skilful hands, whilst those we had on board were
ignorant and helpless in the extreme.</p>

<p>A thick dark night, a contrary wind blowing half a gale, and a
rocky reefy lee-shore, added to these disadvantages, made me
petition my husband most earnestly for a run back to George Town,
whence we could proceed overland with our children; and, about
eleven o'clock, I had the great, but I must confess unexpected,
satisfaction of hearing that the order had been given and we were
soon hurrying back most rapidly, bounding before the gale towards
the Tamar.</p>

<p>Knowing the inattention and recklessness of the "Master" (and
which knowledge alone induced him to turn back), Mr. Meredith went
on deck frequently to see that all was right. Once, as he stood
gazing at the lighthouse, the point for which we were steering, he
suddenly lost the light for a long interval, much longer than its
period for revolving; then it reappeared, as if from behind some
dark body, and again vanished. He then thought there must be an
island which intervened, and asked the master if he knew how "Tenth
Island" bore from us then?</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir!&mdash;We re leaving Tenth Island two or three miles on
the port quarter."</p>

<p>Still my husband's suspicions were not at rest, and he took the
man forward with him to look out again. By this time the vessel had
rapidly approached "Tenth Island"&mdash;for such it was&mdash;the roar of the
heavy surf was distinctly audible on the rocks, and there remained
barely time to alter our course, ere we swept close past the white
gleam of the breakers on the cliff.</p>

<p>Had we driven onwards another two minutes in the direction we
were going, not one of us had survived to tell the tale:&mdash;and with
a devout and grateful heart did I most earnestly thank God for our
signal deliverance from such a fearful death! I knew nothing of our
danger until it was past, yet even then it was horrible to think
of, and a light welcome sound was the rumble of the cable as we
cast anchor at George Town, about one on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Leaving our servant as our supercargo on board the "Harriet" to
proceed to Swan Port when the wind served, we exchanged our cabin
accommodation for snug apartments in a quiet little inn, and took
our passage from thence on Monday afternoon in the steamer for
Launceston. Her Majesty's ship "Rattlesnake" had also arrived on
Saturday night, and several of her officers and midshipmen were
fellow-passengers with us in the steamboat.</p>

<p>A very pleasant voyage up the Tamar brought us in the evening to
Launceston and our old hotel; whence, the following afternoon, we
proceeded in the mail to Campbell Town: and here began the real
difficulties of our progress; our own good horses were comfortably
grazing at Swan Port, and our peerless tandem cart lay dismembered
in the hold of the "Harriet;" Mr. Meredith consequently made a
voyage of inquiry the next morning in search of some strong vehicle
that could be hired to convey us across the tier, a weary journey
of nearly sixty miles, over the same rough track described in our
pilgrimage <i>to</i> Port Sorell. A spring cart was at length
obtained, and in it we proceeded on our slow and weary way. On the
third evening of our journey, we arrived and halted awhile at our
old home of Spring Vale, where we pressed one of our own stout
horses into our service, and had the pleasure of being welcomed
with a shout of delight from some of our old servants.</p>

<p>Our pretty cottage and the garden we had made and cultivated
with so much care and pride, were unworthily tenanted by people who
kept cattle and horses tethered to our choice fruit-trees, and had
even erased the very form of the garden. Ragged disreputable sheds
were set up in front, and slovenly brush fences behind; but I am
happy to say it has since, in the occupation of our servants, under
our own care, recovered much of its old neatness.</p>

<p>We made a pleasant sojourn at Cambria, our father's hospitable
home, where we joined a right patriarchal assemblage of our own
"kith and kin" then Visiting there, and contributed our triad of
boys to the merry group of grandchildren already met. We waited ia
anxious expectation for the "Harriet's" arrival, and as one week
after another went by without intelligence of her, began to fear
the worst for our valued old servant and our goods and chattels;
but at length, after being driven about the straits in every
direction but the right one, and paying involuntary visits to
Circular Head, and other out-of-the-way localities, they contrived
to cast anchor at Waterloo Point. As soon as our goods were landed,
we took up our abode once more at Riversdale, where the
commencement of a garden and orchard had brought a pleasant
alteration on its former appearance and comfort, and where we have
happily passed the last two years, busy in all farm matters, and in
effecting every practicable improvement in all around us.</p>

<p>If these unpretending chronicles of our Tasmanian life seem to
have lingered long in the recording, the perpetual enticements and
beguilements of pleasant country occupation must hear the
blame.</p>

<p>I could not possibly sit down quietly to write whilst I had my
new garden entirely to remodel; and my anxious wish to leave all
things in their places that were growing luxuriantly, so as to
prevent too much evidence of newness, and at the same time to turn
all the straight dirt-walks into gracefully curved turf ones, and
to have a nice grass plat in front, was not very easily fulfilled,
and cost me many runs up stairs, to contemplate the effect of my
plans from the upper windows, before my clever old gardener and I
could finally accomplish our task, the result now being highly
satisfactory. A rustic wooden bridge leading to the orchard over a
long fish-pond in the garden is also one of our useful
embellishments, and a thatched octagon summer-house, nicely placed
beneath a fine old lightwood tree near the pond, will, when covered
with creeping roses, ivy, jasmine, and passionflowers, be very
ornamental too, though at present the popular opinion of my taste
in erecting it seems somewhat divided. A spacious veranda, erected
this summer, along the front of the house, is the most important
and essential addition of all; in this country, a good veranda is
like an extra sitting-room; and, as an airy play-place for children
on a warm or rainy day, is invaluable. We hope that some of our
numerous families of swallows will take, of rather make, apartments
in it next summer. Last year we were prevented from using our
little boat for some months, although the Swan River is a
delightful place for sailing, because a pair of confiding little
swallows had built their nest in it, as it lay on the cross beams
of a shed in the yard; and we could not dream of disturbing them
till the young ones were grown up; then the boat was removed at
once, lest another brood should claim our forbearance. Our veranda
also forms my only substitute for a green-house, and in this
climate such partial shelter is sufficient for the cultivation of
most plants which must be wholly protected during an English
winter.</p>

<p>From the front window of our dining-room, where I now sit, I
look through the veranda over the grass plat and flower borders,
now past their summer beauty, but still gay with noble hollyhocks,
carnations, tiger lilies, and other autumn flowers. A hawthorn
hedge, and some graceful white-blossomed acacias, overhang two
ranges of beehives, and conceal the paling fence, behind which
passes the public road; and beyond its other hedge, which is of
gorse, lie sweet fields of clover, where the children's five pet
lambs, and some favourite horses or cows, lead a luxurious life.
Beyond these, again, is another gorse hedge, and other larger
meadows, also fenced with a grand <i>chevaux de frise</i> of gorse,
with some emerald bright English willows, forming lofty clumps on
one side; and in spring, giving us a pleasant home-like interest in
marking their gracefully deepening green, amidst the unchanging,
dull, olive natives of the soil. Still again beyond flows the Swan
River, a noble broad stream, sixty yards or more in width, but only
visible to us from the house when a heavy flood spreads it over the
meadows. On the opposite bank of the river lies a small farm, some
of the whitewashed buildings just showing through a fine belt of
trees; and, bounding the whole, rises a woody ridge of steep rocky
hills, only used as a sheep-run, and a very poor one.</p>

<p>From our side-window, through the passionflowers, roses, and
jasmine trained round it, and over a gay little flower-garden
below, we look up the public road, through the district. Opposite
the entrance to our farm-yard stands our blacksmith's forge, whilst
the mill, barn, stack-yard, cow-sheds, stabling, dairymen's
cottages, and other buildings, fill up the side-view, and complete
the extensive farm homestead. A dovecote on a high wooden pillar,
safe from cats, but alas! not always so from hawks, is the abode of
a large and handsome family of tumbler-pigeons; and a capacious
yard beyond, well stocked with portly porkers, if not adding much
to the ornamental character of the scene, gives by no means an
unsubstantial promise of creature comforts. The common barn-door
fowls are our most profitable kind of poultry, being more hardy and
requiring less tending than most others. Turkeys were apt to wander
away into the bush, where they are killed by the native vermin;
Guinea fowls generally become wild; geese do not commonly thrive so
well as at home; and ducks, very successful on some farms, are on
others always carried off by disease.</p>

<p>From the two hives of bees which survived the long confinement
of the voyage from Port Sorell (one hive died entirely, not having
enough honey to maintain them so long), we have now twenty-three,
besides five that I have given away; and as we always drive the
bees into a new hive when we take the honey, instead of smothering
the swarm with brimstone, &amp;c., our stock will soon be much
larger. Whether the system of driving them into an empty hive would
answer in the severe winters of England, I am not aware; but here,
we perform the operation early in February (which answers to August
at Home), and the bees collect a good store again before winter,
and are even then rarely kept prisoners three days together without
fresh food. Here the wide extent of English clover fields, and the
long, long lines of glorious gorse edges, added to all the usual
bush and garden flowers, seem admirably suited to the good little
honey-makers. At Poyston the young swarms always gave us great
trouble to hive them, from their tendency to fly swiftly away, and
we lost many in this manner; but here we have now even left off
performing the usual tin-dish-and-key concert, on the rising of a
swarm, for without any interference they settle within a few feet,
or at most a few yards of the parent hive. One little bush of
Chrysanthemums has had four swarms light in it within a month, and
an old peach-tree has been similarly favoured; so that we have come
to the conclusion that our bees are of peculiarly domestic and
contented habits. The honey-comb of this year is much of it, not
figuratively, but literally, as white as snow, and the honey
colourless as liquid crystal, and of most delicate flavour.</p>

<p>Our fine dairy of beautiful cows, and our busy hives of good
little bees, fully realize to us that scriptural picture of rural
luxury&mdash;"A land flowing with milk and honey;" the only alloying
drop of gall being the absence of all possibility of turning any of
our surrounding abundance to pecuniary profit. Our fat grass-fed
beef and small delicious mutton&mdash;equal to any "Welsh" ever
tasted&mdash;sell at <i>two-pence halfpenny</i> a pound; our wheat at
3<i>s</i>. the bushel; oats scarcely saleable at 1<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>.; and barley not in demand at all, most brewers here
concocting their compounds from damaged sugar. Were colonial
distillation permitted by the Government, it might become a
profitable means of disposing of the surplus grain; but the fear
lest the finance department should suffer by any diminution of the
duties now so largely paid on imported spirits, prevents that boon
being accorded to the colonists; and they, unable to make the
business of grain-growing pay its own expenses, must soon do
generally, as so many have already done, lay down their luxuriant
corn-fields in grass and clover, for the production of wool,
cheese, and butter, and cultivate no more corn than their own
establishments require to consume; and this in a country suited
beyond most others for the production of excellent wheat and other
grain. Wool seems the only staple commodity of the colony that can
be made to pay even its expenses, and a short time since the prices
for that were exceedingly low, nor have they yet become adequately
remunerative to the sheep-farmer.</p>

<p>I have now retraced my Colonial life from first to last: from
the period of my leaving England in 1839, to the present month of
February, 1850; and as I fold up the last leaves of my Tasmanian
chronicle, and wish my little book a safe voyage to dear old
England, I cannot ask or desire a more cordial welcome for it than
that which greeted its predecessor; and I heartily hope it may be
deemed deserving of one as kind.</p>
