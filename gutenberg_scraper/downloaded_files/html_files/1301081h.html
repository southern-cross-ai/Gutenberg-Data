  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">1.&mdash;AN ALLY</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY J.R. SKELTON</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol LII, Jul 1920, pp
  126-132</h3>

  <p>THERE was nothing of the traditional explorer about Jim Craddock. He was
  not a strong, silent man with a stern brown face and marked absence of flesh,
  but he was a first "chop" hand at the game, all the same. Moreover, he wrote
  no books, he contemplated nothing in the way of geographical discovery to
  London societies, but his knowledge of Central Africa was extensive and
  peculiar, and if there was a remote corner of the Dark Continent where
  threepence was to be made, then assuredly Craddock was the man to find it.
  For the most part he was a freelance, though when times were bad he was not
  averse to enlisting under the banner of some trading company or as a guide to
  the sporting "blood" in search of big game. Usually, however, he preferred to
  work on his own, because this course allowed him to travel about just as he
  pleased, generally in the company of the humorist who carefully camouflaged
  himself under the name of Jan Stewer&mdash;a sort of left-handed compliment
  to the county that had given him birth. But, as to the rest, Stewer said
  nothing, except occasionally to hint that, like the Van Diemen's Land
  convicts in the old days, he had left his country for his country's good. It
  was only occasionally and in boastful moments that Stewer ever alluded to the
  fact, and then only in the presence of Craddock. He was a big strong bull of
  a man, with a marvellously cool nerve and a certain whimsical humour in time
  of danger that rendered him invaluable.</p>

  <p>Craddock himself was small and lean and brown, with a merry eye and a
  fearsome taste for music which would have driven anybody but Stewer wild. He
  travelled the world with a sort of accordion arrangement of his own
  invention, and it was his proud boast that this weird instrument had had a
  more soothing effect on the gentle native than anything in the way of melody
  that had ever been heard on the Dark Continent. And now he was up amongst the
  Moghis, with an entirely fresh arrangement for capturing the senses of that
  somewhat turbulent people. It took the form of a gramophone with some
  exceedingly fine records, mostly of operatic stars.</p>

  <p>Craddock and his friend were in that part of the world more or less by
  accident. They had been having an exceedingly bad time lately, and it had
  become necessary to seek fresh woods and pastures new, and, moreover, reports
  had reached Craddock to the effect that there was much ivory in that remote
  spot. This rumour, however, proved to be false, and, beyond a certain amount
  of exceedingly inferior rubber, there seemed to be little or nothing to
  recompense the friends for the risks that they were undoubtedly running. But
  this fact troubled Craddock not at all, and they wre not having a bad time.
  There was a prospect of more rubber in the spring, and, moreover, Bomba, the
  chief of the Moghis, was as friendly as they had any right to expect. They
  had no camp followers and very little in the way of ammunition, but they
  managed to make themselves understood, and from the very first the gramophone
  was the pronounced success that Craddock had confidently prophesied.</p>

  <p>Nothing of this kind had ever appeared in those remote wilds before, and
  the dusky Bomba was amazingly impressed. After the first feeling of terror
  had worn off, and the tribe had come back timidly to the outside of
  Craddock's hut, there was a constant clamour for the devil voices. Certainly
  the great Caruso never had a more flattering or attentive audience.</p>

  <p>"It's a real good egg, old man," Craddock told his friend. "I told you it
  would be, if we could only get the beggars to listen."</p>

  <p>They were sitting in the moonlight in front of the hut, smoking their
  pipes after a most successful day, in which the gramophone had been greatly
  in evidence, and, consequently, Craddock was in the best of spirits. But
  Stewer appeared to be just a little dubious.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's all right up to now," he murmured; "but it ain't quite so
  lovely in the garden as you think. You're such a sanguine beggar, Jim. Old
  Bomba's all right, but I don't like the look of that chap Sambi."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Sambi?" Craddock asked. "What can he do? He's only
  a sort of second-in-command, after all."</p>

  <p>"Very likely; but he's got a big following here, and if he can down the
  old man and take his place, he'll do it. He's got quite a lot of the medicine
  men of the tribe on his side, and if those chaps like to kick up a bobbery,
  then the old man's number's up for sure."</p>

  <p>"But how should this concern us?" Craddock asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm just coming to that," Stewer went on. "About that gramophone of
  yours. Sambi wants it. He'd give his ears for it. He offered me two elephants
  for the machine yesterday."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Craddock asked. "Two elephants? Where's he going to get 'em
  from? Why, there isn't an elephant within five hundred miles!"</p>

  <p>"I know, and that's just what makes me so uneasy. I ain't afraid of a
  shindy, as you know, but seeing that we two are alone, and that we've only
  got a pair of Mauser pistols between us, I'm not asking for any trouble. And,
  besides, I don't like that chap's eye. A cross-eyed nigger isn't pretty to
  look at, and Sambi is a rotten specimen of the breed. Last night, after you
  were asleep, Sambi came into the tent, and I'm sure he'd have walked off with
  the machine if I hadn't been awake. Directly I challenged him he was off like
  a hare, and no doubt he thinks I didn't recognise him, for I didn't mention
  it to him this morning&mdash;I thought it would be wiser not to. But he was
  after the gramophone all right, and he will stop at nothing to get it."</p>

  <p>Craddock chuckled over his pipe.</p>

  <p>"The beggar's welcome," he said. "But the machine isn't much good without
  the records and the needles, and I've taken precious good care of those. I'm
  not quite so careless as you think, Jan. These chaps don't know even that a
  needle is necessary, and, as to the records, I put 'em in their waterproof
  case down our well every night. I don't believe it will hurt them to get wet,
  but never mind about that. If Sambi gets hold of the goods, he won't be able
  to make the slightest use of them. Don't you get meeting trouble half-way,
  Jan. Besides, it ain't like you to talk in this way."</p>

  <p>Stewer professed himself to be satisfied, but, all the same, he was
  anything but easy in his mind. For the next day or two he kept a close eye
  upon the wily and elusive Sambi, and the more he saw of that oblique-eyed
  individual, the more sure he was that trouble was looming in the distance.
  There were many mutterings and whisperings in corners between the
  second-in-command and the picturesque-looking ruffians who represented the
  medicine men of the tribe. There were occasions, too, in the evenings, when
  the natives sat in a circle round the Englishmen's hut and listened
  enraptured to some of the finest voices in the world, and at all of these
  Sambi was present, with those oblique, greedy eyes of his fixed with an
  intense longing on the gramophone. And two days later the gramophone was
  missing from Craddock's hut.</p>

  <p>There was an immense outcry, of course, there were weepings and wailings
  and loud lamentations, such as usually accompanied the death of the chief,
  and at the same time Sambi was missing. He had gone up country somewhere, so
  Bomba said, to hold a palaver with a neighbouring tribe which looked like
  giving trouble. That there was a good deal of truth in this, Craddock knew,
  because he had heard the matter discussed before, but in the light of what
  Stewer had told him he could see plainly enough that the wily Sambi was
  intent upon killing two birds with one stone. He appeared to be greatly
  concerned at the disappearance of the devil box, but he knew perfectly well
  that it must come back to him in the course of a day or two.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's quite all right," he told Stewer. "Sambi's got it right enough,
  and he's taken it up country with him. He'll come back presently with some
  fairy story about having found the gramophone in the bush, and probably
  suggest that a few poor wretches should be sacrificed. Now, you see if I
  ain't a true prophet. Sambi is no fool, and it won't take him long to realise
  that 'Hamlet' is a poor play with the Dane left out."</p>

  <p>It turned out exactly as Craddock had foreseen, for Sambi put in an
  appearance three days later with an air of vast importance and a little more
  obliquity of vision than usual, and proceeded to make a pompous declaration.
  He told the secretly amused Craddock that he had found the gramophone hidden
  away in a deserted hut far in a back country, and that he had discovered and
  punished the culprit, As a matter of fact, there were three culprits
  altogether, and they had all paid the dread penalty, which, as Stewer
  subsequently remarked, was probably the only true statement in the veracious
  narrative.</p>

  <p>"Very good, very good, Sambi," Craddock said approvingly. "You have done
  the State some service&mdash;I mean, you are a nut in the detective line. I
  hope you enjoyed the gramophone. It must have cheered you amazingly on your
  diplomatic errand."</p>

  <p>Sambi grinned somewhat uneasily. He was not entirely deficient of a sense
  of humour, and he seemed to grasp the fact dimly that his leg was being
  pulled. Then he shook his head mournfully.</p>

  <p>"No spirit make it good," he said. "Me turn and turn the brass god at the
  end of the box, but no voice he come."</p>

  <p>"I hope the fool hasn't broken the spring," Craddock said sotto voce, "Oh,
  that's all right, Sambi. The gods of the white man are a bit shy of a nigger.
  Perhaps I'll teach you some day. But look here, old son, what about that
  mission of yours? How are the Wambas coming along?"</p>

  <p>Sambi immediately launched into a long explanation. Literally translated,
  the Wambas were particularly hot stuff, and never quite happy without their
  annual dust-up with their good neighbours, the Moghis&mdash;in fact, this
  little excursion appeared to take the same place with them as the annual
  visit to the seaside in more civilised climes. Sambi had apparently crossed
  the border with a view to settling some outstanding dispute, which apparently
  he had failed to do. According to his own account, there had been a violent
  eruption of party feeling, in which the Speaker of the Wamba House of Commons
  had lost his head in consequence of some personal remark he had made to the
  Leader of the Opposition, and, indeed, if Sambi was to be believed, he had
  narrowly escaped with his own life. Beyond a doubt the annual campaign was
  near at hand.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if the beggar was lying?" Craddock remarked to Stewer, when they
  were alone again. "Oh, I know these people are always having these little
  differences of opinion, but somehow I have the impression that Sambi is
  lying. I can't get out of my head that in some way the gramophone is at the
  bottom of it, I can't see how, but that's my idea."</p>

  <p>But apparently Sambi was telling the truth, for there were a great many
  signs during the next few days that a crisis was at hand. Bomba called his
  braves together round the council fire, and for many hours the air was
  rendered hideous with the din of conflicting opinions. An almost unholy calm
  fell on the protagonists, after which Bomba made his braves an impassioned
  speech. He stood there, a fine figure of a man in all his war-paint, with the
  scarlet cummerbund about his ample waist supporting a veritable battery of
  obsolete weapons. The women and children were sent to the interior,
  provisions were collected, and at dawn the following morning the hideous din
  of tom-toms proclaimed the fact that the motley army was setting forth with a
  view to putting a proper respect into the thick heads of the Wambas.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a Wild West circus," Stewer laughed. "Upon my word, I've half
  a mind to take a hand at the game myself. Anything's better than loafing
  around here like this. Don't you think it would be just as well if we made
  tracks before they get back? It might save a painful parting, and we're not
  making our salt here."</p>

  <p>"Oh, let's see it through," Craddock suggested. "But as to going along,
  that's quite another story. At any rate, we shall have the village to
  ourselves for the next week or so, and we shall be able to do as we like. Our
  friend Sambi is safe for the present, at any rate."</p>

  <p>With that, Craddock knocked out his pipe and strolled into the hut for the
  usual siesta. He was followed a moment or two later by Stewer, and there they
  lay on their grass beds till late in the afternoon. It was an exceedingly hot
  day, and they were grateful for the peace and quietness after the constant
  din that kept the village in a state of turmoil throughout the day. And as
  Craddock lay there asleep, he began to dream strange things. He dreamt that
  he was being tortured, that his ankles and knees and wrists were bound with
  green hide thongs which seemed to be cutting into his very bones. The pain
  became so great at last that he woke to a dim realisation of the fact that
  this thing was true. He was lying on the flat of his back, bound exactly in
  the way he had seen in his uneasy slumbers. A thin rope of green hide was
  about his feet and ingeniously carried to his hands, which were kept some two
  feet apart by a piece of tough split bamboo, through which the thong was
  threaded so that it was impossible for him to get his hands together and work
  with his fingers on the green hide. It was as if a splint had been placed
  there, and even Craddock was bound to admire the exceedingly neat piece of
  work. He was forced to recognise the fact that he was absolutely helpless,
  and, in addition to this, he was drowsy and heavy, with a racking pain in his
  head and a bead of moisture on his forehead. He was so overcome that it was
  some little time before he realised that he was suffering from the effect of
  a powerful drug. He managed to drag himself to a sitting position presently,
  and looked somewhat drearily around him.</p>

  <p>Presently he caught the eye of his companion, who was in precisely similar
  case. Then Stewer assumed a sitting position with some considerable
  difficulty, and the two regarded one another with blank faces.</p>

  <p>"Well, we're up against it now all right," the Devonian said. "Great
  James, what a head I've got on me!"</p>

  <p>"Well, we're companions in misfortune there," Craddock grinned. "Say,
  sonny, what do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," Stewer said. "Looks to me as if we had got an enemy
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>Craddock laughed cheerfully. This was the sort of situation in which he
  came out at his best.</p>

  <p>"Now, that's very bright of you," he said. "But where's the nigger in the
  fence? There's not a man within miles of the village, and I don't suppose for
  a moment that the women are responsible for this little jest."</p>

  <p>"Then whom do you suspect?" Stewer asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's an easy one," Craddock replied. "We've got to thank our
  ingenious friend Sambi for this. Yes, that's right. Sambi for a million. The
  more I think of it, the more plain it becomes. He walked off with the
  gramophone under pretence that he was off on some political mission. If he
  had understood the thing, he would never have come back; but because he had
  no records and no needles, he was done, and that's why he came back with that
  interesting little story about finding the thing in the woods and laying out
  the chaps that pinched it. The chap's mad to get hold of the machine, and
  this is how he means to do it. Everybody is away, and his little game is to
  torture us ingeniously until we are compelled to show him how it will work.
  Then he'll slope off with the whole apparatus, and probably plant himself
  down upon some simple unsophisticated tribe, and&mdash;well, it's pretty
  plain, old bird, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Stewer nodded emphatically. He was of entirely the same opinion as his
  friend, and therefore was fully alive to the gravity of the situation. These
  were a fairly gentle people they were amongst, but, after all, they were
  primitives, and both the captives knew only too well what was likely to
  happen now that Sambi's cupidity was fairly roused. Beyond doubt he had
  deserted his companions in the field, and had come back to the village with
  one great object smouldering in the back of his mind. It was just possible,
  as Craddock explained to Stewer, that there was no trouble with the Wamba
  tribe at all, but that Sambi had invented the whole thing with a view to
  getting rid of Bomba and all the rest of the crew whilst he put his plan of
  campaign into execution.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile tney sat there stewing and sweating in the heat of the still
  afternoon, tugging in vain at their bonds and struggling for freedom. But
  though it was possible to crawl across the floor until they came in personal
  contact with one another, the devilish contrivance of those bamboo splints
  rendered every effort futile. And, to add to their futile fury, they could
  see on the shelf under the eaves of their hut their two revolvers and case of
  spare ammunition; but in their present helpless condition the weapons might
  have been a thousand miles away.</p>

  <p>"It's no use," Craddock gasped presently. "We shall have to wait. Sambi is
  bound to come along presently, and we might be able to compromise with
  him."</p>

  <p>Stewer grunted as he thought reluctantly of the useless pipe and tobacco
  in his pocket, whilst Craddock dragged himself to the door of the hut and
  stood blinking up at the sunshine. There was not a soul to be seen and not a
  sound to be heard, for the women and children had been removed in case of
  trouble on the frontier, and even the dogs had followed them. In a curious,
  detached sort of way Craddock stood there watching a colony of great white
  ants working about the base of a hill of dead vegetable refuse which they had
  thrown up just outside the hut. It was not a pleasant sight, because it
  recalled memories of old stories which he had heard in his wanderings. He
  knew, for instance, that one of the persuasive methods of the natives was to
  tie up a prisoner to a stake driven in the centre of an ant hill and leave
  him there to his reflections. If he remained long enough, he would be eaten
  bit by bit by those ferocious white ants, or driven mad by the torture of
  them. It was a thought that turned Craddock cold. He could see himself
  standing there, with those diabolical little brutes crawling all over him and
  gradually eating into his very vitals. For there were hundreds of thousands
  of them in one of those big heaps, to say nothing of the fact that they were
  the best part of an inch long.</p>

  <p>And yet, even as Craddock lingered there, contemplating this dread
  tragedy, something of a plan was forming in his mind. It was when danger
  stared him in the face that he was at his best and brightest. He just turned
  to say something of this to Stewer, when the grinning Sambi hove in sight. He
  appeared to be on the best of terms with himself, for a vast smile seemed to
  split his face in twain and displayed a set of teeth that a mastiff might
  have envied.</p>

  <p>"Well, you black rascal," Craddock cried, "what's the meaning of this? You
  cut these cords!"</p>

         "'You black rascal,' Craddock cried, 'what's the meaning of this?'">
  </div><br>

  <p>Sambi grinned pleasantly and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No cut," he said. "We sit down and palaver."</p>

  <p>With a murderous feeling in his heart, Craddock complied. There was
  nothing to gain by a display of passion, and it was just possible that by
  diplomacy he would be able to achieve his ends.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," he said. "Now, then. I know pretty well what you want,
  you rascal, but you can't make us give you the best part of the devil box.
  Still, I'm ready to make a bargain with you."</p>

  <p>"That is all good," Sambi grinned. "You give me the voice of the moon
  children, and the little god that rubs him on the chest and makes him talk,
  and presently I send one of the women to free you. You give me those, and the
  round black things that shine in the sun, and we are friends."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and what then?" Craddock asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, then I travel to the country beyond the rains with the devil
  box&mdash;to a far country where they make me king and there is much million
  ivories. You say 'Yes,' and it's done."</p>

  <p>Craddock replied vigorously enough, in a sort of vernacular, to the effect
  that he was not taking any. He half expected some passionate outburst on
  Sambi's part, but it did not come. The wily nigger merely grinned and pointed
  significantly to the ant heap outside the hut. It was clear enough to
  Craddock now that Sambi had lured the tribe off on a wild-goose chase, so
  that he could work out the plot at his leisure.</p>

  <p>"All good," Sambi said. "I give you food, but not the pipe, and in the
  morning you will think better of it."</p>

  <p>He did not express himself quite so clearly, but that was the meaning. He
  lingered long enough to assure himself that the bonds of his prisoners were
  sound, after which he lounged out of the hut, to return a little later with
  food, which he placed on the floor for his captives to assimilate as best
  they might.</p>

  <p>"What was the brute driving at?" Stewer asked. "I can't follow the lingo
  as well as you do. I know he was trying to drive a bargain with you over the
  gramophone, and I could see you weren't taking any. If you don't, what's
  going to be the upshot of the business?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing very pleasant," Craddock grinned. "That black scamp's worked the
  whole thing out in his mind, and very cleverly he has done it. But he's a
  long way from getting the gramophone yet."</p>

  <p>"And if he doesn't?" Stewer queried.</p>

  <p>Craddock indicated the ant heap and elaborated the stories he had heard in
  connection with it.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!" Stewer shuddered. "Sounds worse than the torture in the 'Mikado.'
  But you're not going to let it go as far as that, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite," Craddock said between his teeth, "but very nearly. I never
  was beaten by a nigger yet, and I'll be hanged if I'm going to start now. If
  only one of us could get rid of the hide through this splint, by wearing it
  away or cutting it, we should be free in five minutes. Once that happened, we
  should have our revolvers again, and Sambi's path of glory would end in
  something abrupt in the way of a grave. See my meaning?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see your meaning plainly enough," Stewer grunted, "but how's it
  going to be done?"</p>

  <p>"But it ain't impossible," Craddock said. "Only the remedy is a desperate
  one, and I suppose you have heard of the expedient called taking a hair from
  the dog that bit you? Now, that's exactly what I'm going to do. I am going to
  suffer a little to save us from suffering a lot, if you understand what I
  mean. And when the moon goes down this evening, I'll show you. I'm going to
  teach that confounded nigger a lesson."</p>

  <p>With that, Craddock shut his teeth grimly and refused to say any more. But
  presently, as the night began to wear thin, and the moon slid behind the
  dense foliage at the back of the village, he crept out into the open and for
  a moment contemplated the conical mass of rubbish of which the ants' nest was
  composed. Then quite deliberately he lay down on his stomach and buried his
  two arms, with the long splint between them, in the crown of the nest. With
  sudden enlightenment Stewer watched him. He knew that Craddock, with his
  indomitable pluck and cheery courage, meant to keep his arms buried there
  until the little white devils in the nest had eaten their way through the
  thong that had been woven between the two holes at the end of the bamboo
  cane, and, stolid as he was, Stewer gasped with admiration at Craddock's
  amazing fortitude.</p>

  <p>"Here, come out of it!" he cried. "It isn't worth while. Better let Sambi
  have the gramophone a thousand times over."</p>

  <p>"I never was beaten by a nigger yet..." Craddock began, and then his voice
  trailed off into a whisper. Already the little white insects, raging
  furiously at this assault upon their citadel, were swarming all over his
  arms, until the blood began to stream from a hundred tiny punctures. And
  still he held on, suffering untold agonies, knowing full well that, if he
  could only hold up for a little longer, the white foe would cease to rage,
  and turn its attention to the succulent green hide with which he was bound.
  It was half an hour or more before Craddock, straining at his bonds, felt
  them relax like a piece of elastic. Then, with a fine effort, he snapped the
  last threads of green hide and rose to his feet with a pair of forearms
  dripping red.</p>

  <p>"There!" he said, as he staggered giddily towards the hut. "Didn't I tell
  you it would be all right? But, my aunt, I wouldn't go through that again for
  all the gold in Africa! But no nigger&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With that he fainted, and it was some moments before he came to himself
  again. He stripped himself to the buff, and, after carefully removing every
  ant from his clothing, proceeded to cut Stewer's bonds. This being done, he
  dressed those raw and bleeding arms of his, and then, though writhing in
  pain, sat down to await the dawn and Sambi's coming.</p>

  <p>He came in due course, with a grin upon that ebony face of his, to find
  his prisoners squatting on the floor much as he had left them the night
  before.</p>

  <p>"You are ready for me now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That is so," Craddock drawled, as he turned over on his left side and
  covered Sambi with a revolver. "I guess you've hit it, my friend. I was never
  beaten by a nigger yet, and I'm too old to begin now."</p>

  <p>Sambi, with all the fatality of his clan, folded his hands over his
  capacious stomach and waited for what was coming to him.</p>

  <p>"My lord is a great man," he said, "and his days will be long on the
  earth. And behold, I am ready"</p>

  <p>With that Craddock shot him neatly and artistically through the centre of
  the forehead, and he collapsed without a sound on the floor of the hut.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a good job done," Stewer said. "And what's the next item on
  the programme?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not quite sure," Craddock said. "Shall we bury him and say
  nothing about it, or shall we wait here till Bomba comes back, and tell him
  the whole story? If we bury him properly, those chaps, when they come back,
  may think that he was killed in battle; but my idea is to clear out
  altogether and leave them to draw their own conclusions. What do you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Clear," Stewer said laconically. "Quick!"</p><br>

     name="story2">2.&mdash;THE MYSTERY OF ROOM FIVE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 25 Dec
  1920</h3><br>

  <p class="first">GERALD NETTLESHIP, private inquiry agent and general
  investigator, pending a promised appointment in connection with the Secret
  Service, and whilom a public schoolboy, regarded his pretty wife Ella with
  frank admiration. For she apparently had solved part of the problem that was
  worrying him sorely. If they could get hold of this five hundred pounds then
  the matter of the furnished flat they so greatly coveted would be solved, and
  they would have a house of their own instead of passing the approaching
  Christmas in lodgings. It had to be a cash transaction because the outgoing
  tenant&mdash;a friend of Nettleship's&mdash;was an Australian returning to
  his ranch after the war, and wanted the money. And Ella Nettleship was
  explaining how the desired sum might be obtained, and because she too had
  earned her living, till Gerald married her, in a private detective office, he
  listened with all due respect. He had been away in Manchester on business for
  the last week, and this new development had come as a startling surprise to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Directly I read the notice in the <i>Times</i>," she said, "I went round
  and saw Sir Percival Kennelly at once. Very fortunately he was at home, and
  when I told him who you were and what we were both doing he was awfully
  nice&mdash;quite a dear, in fact? He at once agreed to give us a chance of
  getting to the bottom of the mystery, and offered a voluntary fifty pounds
  towards expenses. So, as you were away, I went down to The Grange at
  Overstrands and put in two days, investigating matters. And I believe, I
  really believe, Gerry dear, that I am on the track of the miscreants. As to
  the occult side of the mystery, we can rule that out at once."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Nettleship laughed. "By Jove, 500 pounds reward! And nothing
  much in the way of expense. Good Heavens! I'd like to see you presiding over
  the turkey in our own flat at Christmas. Would you mind running over the
  details once more, Ellie?"</p>

  <p>Ella proceeded to explain that the Grange at Overstrands was the property
  of Sir Percival Kennelly, a somewhat impoverished Baronet, who owned some
  considerable property on the East Coast, where he had sunk all he could raise
  in a golf course that had splendid possibilities, and that he was using the
  Grange as a dormy house in connection with the golf course, and he had
  obtained a license to sell all kinds of drinks. Until the course was perfect,
  and he could devote the beautiful old Grange for the use of golfers alone, he
  ran it as an ordinary public-house, with a bar where anybody could procure
  liquid refreshment. The house was in charge of a steward called Chiffner, an
  old retainer, who was quite beyond suspicion, and yet for some time past the
  most extraordinary things had been happening in the bedrooms of the old house
  after the golfing guests had retired for the night, so that the place was
  getting a bad name, and it looked as if much harm was being done to the links
  that a little time back appeared likely to become so popular. As this was a
  serious matter to Sir Percival, he had offered the reward of 500 pounds in
  the <i>Times</i> to any one who could solve the mystery. And before calling
  in the police he had offered Ella Nettleship a chance of earning the money
  wherewith to consummate the dream of spending the forthcoming Christmas in
  the flat upon which her heart was set.</p>

  <p>So she had gone down to Overstrands ostensibly as a golfer, and had spent
  two nights in the Grange, where she had made her business known to the
  steward Chiffner, whom her detective instinct told her that she could
  implicitly trust. And there she ascertained that all the trouble arose in
  Room Five, and nowhere else. And in Room Five, sooner or later, Ella was
  going to pass the night. It was in this ancient apartment with its old
  portraits and pictures that the series of outrages had taken place. There
  were stories of ghosts and shadowy figures in the dead of night, and tales of
  visitors frightened out of their wits, to say nothing of various valuables
  missing, all of which was playing the very deuce with the golf club. And on
  no occasion had the locked door of Room Five been tampered with.</p>

  <p>"What's the next move?" Nettleship asked, when he had mastered the story.
  "Shall we go down there in Christmas week on the suggestion of playing golf,
  and put up at the Grange? And why not engage Room Number Five, and see what
  is likely to happen?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know," Ella murmured, "that is exactly what I thought of doing,
  but not quite in the way that you mean. We shan't eat our turkey in the flat
  this Yuletide, after all, but we shall have the money to take the flat over
  before Sladen starts for Australia, which will come to the same thing. No,
  we'll go down to the Grange on Christmas Eve, arriving very late&mdash;too
  late, in fact, to book a room at the hotel there, because they will have all
  gone. And I go on alone in a car, reaching the Grange about 11 o'clock. I
  tell Chiffner, who is more or less in my confidence, that I have had a
  breakdown, and he puts me in the haunted room for the night. In fact, that is
  all arranged with Chiffner."</p>

  <p>"And what about me?" Nettleship asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I am expecting to meet my husband there, but he had been
  detained, and will probably get down by another car some time before morning.
  Now, mind, I have been in practically every bedroom of the Grange, and have
  taken measurements, and in Room Five I found that it is, without apparent
  reason, some nine feet narrower than the others in the same wing. What do you
  make of that?"</p>

  <p>"Sounds like a clue," Nettleship muttered. "Is the place lighted by
  electricity, and does the haunted bedroom, where you are going to wait for
  me, boast an electric bell?"</p>

  <p>Ella explained that there was no modern lighting, and that the bell was a
  pneumatic one with a long flex over the bed. So that if anything happened
  when she was supposed to be sleeping in the haunted room a ring at the bell
  would bring Nettleship hot-foot to her assistance. He would have to arrange
  to be hidden in the bar after the general company there had departed, all of
  which could be done with the connivance of the faithful Chiffner. With an
  arrangement like this Ella declared that she would be quite safe in Room
  Number Five if the 'ghost' in search of valuables made a raid on the mystery
  room in the night, as he was pretty sure to do when the apartment was
  occupied. So it was eventually arranged that Nettleship should go down to
  Overstrands under the pretence of golf and spy out the land.</p>

  <p>And this he did, and as it was midweek found little difficulty in
  obtaining a room in the Grange itself. There he made friends with Chiffner,
  who, of course, was already in Ella's confidence. He played a little golf,
  but contented himself with asking a good many questions about people in the
  neighbourhood, especially such locals as made use of the public bar, which
  the owner of the Grange still retained until he had all his arrangements
  made.</p>

  <p>Nettleship was looking over his 'Evening News' on the following afternoon,
  when he read something that brought him up all standing. "Have a look at
  this," he cried. "More trouble at the Grange last night. But read it for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Ella snatched up the paper and read as follows: "We have to report another
  mysterious occurrence at the Grange, Overstrands. Last night a travelling
  American on a golfing holiday presented himself at the Grange, there being
  only one room unoccupied, and that the mysterious Room Five, expressed
  himself anxious to sleep there, and that the story had no terrors for him.
  Moreover, he proclaimed the fact that he was armed, and an expert with a
  revolver. Two hours after he had retired, the steward was aroused by loud
  groans that appeared to proceed from the haunted chamber. On bursting the
  door open the unfortunate American was found unconscious, with a wound over
  his left breast. Up to the time of going to press, he had not recovered
  consciousness, and his condition is considered critical."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that?" Nettleship asked. "My dear girl, you really
  must not face a risk like that."</p>

  <p>But Ella was obdurate. She was going through it now, whatever happened,
  and she pointed out the fact that no such surprise could possibly overtake
  her. It was shortly before ten o'clock on Christmas Eve, therefore, that an
  imperious lady, giving the name of Somerset, arrived at The Grange in a car,
  and explained in a haughty way that she had been delayed on the road by an
  accident. The steward was apologetic, and declared he had no room to spare,
  except the notorious Number Five, and that he could not expect the lady, in
  the circumstances, to take that.</p>

  <p>"What nonsense," the visitor cried, "show me up to the room at once. Put
  my golf bag in the corner there, and carry my dressing-bag and jewel case
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>Chiffner protested, all in vain, and presently the door of Room Five
  closed on the imperious lady, who was not seen again. Down in the bar a
  little later, the habitues were filing out through the front door. Just as
  this was closing on them a man walked in, as if he were a guest there, and
  followed the steward eagerly into the deserted bar.</p>

  <p>"Well, Chiffner," he demanded, "how is everything going? I suppose my wife
  turned up?"</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir," Chiffner said. "Mrs. Nettleship, otherwise Mrs.
  Somerset, is up in her bedroom. It all worked beautifully. Everybody in the
  bar heard the conversation, especially the bit about the jewel-case."</p>

  <p>"And what about your American visitor?" Nettleship asked. "Is he still
  here?"</p>

  <p>Chiffner explained that the unfortunate man had been taken away in an
  ambulance, and that he was still unconscious.</p>

  <p>"'I am very sorry to hear that," Nettleship said. "But we are near the end
  of the trouble. Now then, get all your servants off to bed, and we will sit
  here until the bell rings. I should think that might be in about an hour. I
  don't suppose the man we are after will wait longer than that. Of course, he
  was in the bar when my wife arrived, and he won't be able to resist the lure
  of that jewel case."</p>

  <p>But more than an hour elapsed, and a clock outside was striking one when
  there came quick metallic ripple, and the little red star, bearing the number
  five on the indicator, agitated violently. Nettleship jumped to his feet,
  which he had encased in rubber-soled shoes, and raced up the staircase, until
  he stood outside number five. Chiffner, who followed, remained as directed,
  at the head of the stairs, whilst Nettleship gently pushed the door open an
  inch or two. That it was not properly closed was part of the programme.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Ella had gone to bed gaily enough, and she proceeded more or
  less leisurely to set out her toilette-table and open her dressing-case. The
  jewels&mdash;theatrical, specially borrowed for the occasion&mdash;were
  placed somewhat ostentatiously on a side table between the two windows. By
  the feeble light of a couple of candles she glanced carelessly about her. The
  fire, which had been lighted, had nearly gone out, nor did Ella make an
  attempt to restore the cheerful blaze. She looked round the room, with its
  fine oak panelling, and the half-length portraits let into the walls, and,
  even with her fine courage and resolution, she shivered slightly as she saw
  the sombre eyes of a certain Sir Godfrey Kennelly apparently turned upon her
  with a reproachful gleam. But she recovered quickly enough, for she was not
  there to worry about dead-and-gone Kennellys, so she proceeded leisurely to
  remove her dress and let down her hair. It was a bit strange, perhaps, in
  doing this that she stood close against the wall, right under the portrait of
  the famous Sir Godfrey, and then, instead of removing the rest of her
  clothing, she donned a nightdress over the costume she was wearing, and, with
  every semblance of being ready for the night, threw herself on the bed and
  blew out the candle.</p>

  <p>And there for an hour or more she lay in the pitch darkness pondering over
  the situation, and quite ready and eager for what was going to happen next.
  All this time she held in her right hand a little silver-plated revolver, and
  in the hollow of her left palm she gently caressed the bulb of the pneumatic
  bell.</p>

  <p>She was not in the least frightened, but merely strung up and ready for
  instant action. She knew that her husband was downstairs, because she had
  heard the bolt of the front door shot home twice, which was the signal to her
  that Nettleship put in an appearance, as arranged. And, moreover, according
  to plan, the bedroom door was not quite closed, and, from time to time she
  could just catch the sound of voices below. Gradually, as she lay there, with
  her eyes wide open, and her senses keyed up to the highest point, she began
  to make out, in the very dim light, the outline of certain objects in the
  bedroom. And so she lay there, until she began to be haunted with an uneasy
  dread that all these delicately laid plans were going to miscarry. Was it
  possible, perhaps, that 'the ghost' might be afraid to try another coup so
  soon after the successful raid on the unfortunate American?</p>

  <p>And just when Ella was beginning to make up her mind that the solution of
  the mystery would have to be postponed, there came a slight noise that might
  have been made by a rat behind the wainscot, and, after that, somewhere about
  the place where she judged the portrait of Sir Godfrey to be, two tiny points
  of brilliant flame radiated into the room, thin and keen, like a pair of
  lances. They moved slowly, much as slender searchlights might have done, Ella
  caught sight of them, all that fine courage and resolution returned.</p>

  <p>Here were the eyes, those sinister eyes looking out from the notorious
  portrait as more than one unfortunate occupant of the room had professed to
  see them. And those eyes had been responsible for more than one tragedy. But
  upon this occasion, however, they were exercising no hypnotic effect upon the
  woman who lay there watching them from the bed. As Ella lay perfectly still,
  watching intently, the eyes moved lower down, until they remained some five
  feet or so from the oak-panelled wall. It was only just for a moment that
  they seemed to hesitate there, for they advanced slowly into the room, and
  swept with brilliant intensity across the bed.</p>

  <p>Ella Nettleship, with half-veiled eyes, lay as still as death until the
  lights were switched off in the direction of the dressing-table. Here they
  concentrated for a second or two, and it seemed to Ella that she could see a
  hand stretched out in the direction of her jewel case. Evidently she was not
  wrong, for she saw the lure lifted from the table, and, with that, she gently
  pressed the bulb in the palm of her hand.</p>

  <p>Then she lay perfectly still for possibly ten seconds before she heard the
  door of the bedroom creak, and it seemed to her that she could catch the
  sound of her husband's heavy breathing. And if she were right, it was up to
  him now to do the rest. Then something whizzed across the room, there came a
  choking sort of cry from the direction of the dressing table, and, after a
  short struggle, a mighty object collapsed with a dull thud on the floor.
  Followed a rush across the room, and a heavy impact as two bodies came
  together, and immediately there was a grunt and a groan as the intruder and
  the newcomer grappled with one another. A curse broke out of somewhere in the
  centre of the velvety darkness, and then another cry that seemed to be
  squeezed out of the centre of the gloom with more groans that stopped
  suddenly in the midst of a heavy fall. But assuredly those curses did not
  proceed from Nettleship's lips, and with this comfortable feeling, Ella
  reached out her hand for the box of matches on the little table by the side
  of the bed, and lighted her pair of candles.</p>

  <p>As the flare lifted and dimly illuminated the room, Ella saw a strange
  sight. A man was lying on the floor by the dressing-table with Nettleship
  standing over him. Around the unfortunate intruder's neck was a cord, at the
  end of which were two brass balls that seemed to be twisted so tightly that
  the man lying there could barely breathe. But be that as it might, he was
  absolutely helpless, and Nettleship, breathing heavily, was bending over him
  with the air of a conqueror.</p>

  <p>"You can get up, Ella," he gasped triumphantly. "I've got him all right.
  That was a real lucky shot of mine with a lasso. I could just make out the
  shape of his head in the gleam of those little torches that he has fastened
  to his mask, and I chanced it. So you see that my two years amongst the Texas
  cowboys were not wasted. Here, come along, Chiffner."</p>

  <p>The steward came promptly enough, for, standing outside, he had heard all
  that was going on. He helped to remove the choking lasso from the throat of
  the man lying there, and lifted him to his feet. He cried out suddenly,
  "Gaylor!" he exclaimed. "It's Jim Gaylor."</p>

  <p>"Ah, precisely as I had expected," Nettleship exclaimed. "Ella, this is
  Mr. James Gaylor, the son of the late baronet's butler. A regular bad lot,
  and only recently back in the neighbourhood after a long term of penal
  servitude. When I learnt this fact from Chiffner, I was pretty sure who was
  at the bottom of all the trouble. I can't understand why they didn't suspect
  it before. You see, as he was born here, he must have known all about the
  house and the secret passage leading from the back of the old monastery to
  the back of this room."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know it, sir," Chiffner said.</p>

  <p>"Well, as you have only recently come here to look after the place, how
  should you? You are quite right, Ella, when you said there was a missing
  space of eight feet, and that is right behind Sir Godfrey's portrait, which
  is painted on a sliding panel. This chap knew all about it, and very good use
  of his knowledge he has made. All these months he has been able to play the
  ghost of the haunted room, and well he has done it, for he has done no work
  since he came out of gaol, and he seems to have had plenty of money to spend
  in the bar downstairs. He hung about there, night after night, waiting for
  some one to take Room Five, and once he knew that a visitor was there, then
  the rest was easy. Chiffner, you had better telephone to the police station.
  I can look after this man till you come back."</p>

  <p>The unfortunate Gaylor seemed to be taking no interest in the proceedings.
  He lay on the floor, weak and helpless, and evidently still suffering deeply
  from the cruel pressure of the lasso about his throat.</p>

  <p>Ella smiled up into her husband's face,</p>

  <p>"You have done splendidly," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, in a way I have," Nettleship said. "But most of the credit belongs
  to you. It was you who found out all about that missing space, and gave me
  the clue to the secret entrance to the house. Well, I managed to find that,
  and when I discovered that one of the men who came to drink here was the son
  of the late baronet's butler it seemed to me that I knew exactly where to put
  my hand on the criminal. You see, he was just the sort of man to know all
  about the mysteries of the house, and his past made him suspect. Now, let's
  get him out of the way, and go quietly to bed. This ought to be a rattling
  good Christmas for us, and when it is over we'll just go back to London and
  get into that little flat of ours without further delay."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY DUDLEY TENNANT</h3>

  296-302</h3>

  <p class="first">SERGEANT DONALD MACNAUGHT, B Section, Frontier Police, came
  out of the Superintendent's office with his head in the air and the assurance
  that the commission provisionally promised him was as good as in his pocket.
  True, he was a stranger in the Harris Fork district, having been moved there
  quite recently for a specific purpose, and this was undeniably a drawback out
  there in the wild, where local knowledge is a big asset in the tracking down
  of criminals. But then Macnaught had a proper conceit of himself, which
  usually goes with a Scotchman who happens to be born in Belfast. And,
  moreover, Superintendent Donovan had given him a free hand, so it was up to
  him to justify himself and, in the course of time, emerge triumphantly in the
  silver stripes that marked the higher rank.</p>

  <p>And, so far as the ambitious Sergeant could see, the matter was pretty
  plain sailing. He had laid his plans before the Superintendent, after a
  careful study of the map, and the great man had been pleased to nod his
  approval. Beyond question, the quarry, in the shape of that reckless
  desperado Jimmy Hayes, had been marked down only the day before in the
  settlement on the far side of the foothills which were known as Eagle Ridge.
  Hayes had come there in one of his meteoric flights, ostensibly to bury his
  wife, but really to display himself in his most heroic light to an admiring
  community which, be it whispered, tendered to the desperado its entire
  sympathy. They were a wild, rather lawless lot out there, and brute force was
  a ritual. Besides, Jimmy Hayes was a man of undeniable courage and resource,
  a sort of Western Robin Hood, with a dash of Claude Duval, and in his more
  conventional days had been exceedingly popular. Then the wild blood in him
  had broken out, away down west at Dingo City, where he had found himself
  involved with a set of gamblers who had the temerity to try and rob him under
  the guise of a friendly game of poker. There had been trouble over that, and
  Hayes had got away, leaving one man for dead. That was merely an incident. He
  lay low till that was forgotten, then returned to Harris Fork, where he was
  in partnership with a sort of hybrid Jew called Marks&mdash;a partnership
  which for a time was exceedingly successful. This was owing almost entirely
  to Hayes's courage and resource, and it might have ended in fortune on both
  sides but for the fact that Hayes had journeyed once more to Dingo City,
  where there had been more trouble with his old antagonists, and where another
  of them had bitten the dust. There was a hue and cry after this, so that for
  many months it was impossible for Hayes to show himself at Harris Fork, and
  after a time rumour had it that he was dead.</p>

  <p>At any rate, Harris Fork saw him no more for the best part of a year,
  during which his wife did not hear from him, though she always declared that
  he would come back one of these days.</p>

  <p>She was a little, fragile flower of a woman, totally unfitted for those
  high, cold altitudes, with their terrible winter of snow and frost, but there
  was no denying her courage and her hopefulness that some day, when the
  partnership would be dissolved, she and Hayes could go down South. The
  partnership was dissolved, after Hayes's disappearance, by Marks, who cut it
  abruptly short with the statement that he had lost money over it, and that,
  so far as he was concerned, Mrs. Hayes could shift for herself. In other
  words, he robbed her in the most cold-blooded fashion, so that she had to go
  out into the settlement and get her own living. And this she did until the
  hard work became too much for her, and just as winter was setting in, she
  died&mdash;murdered, the women said, to put money in the pockets of a
  scoundrel.</p>

  <p>And then, on the day of her funeral, Hayes put in a dramatic appearance.
  Where he came from and how he knew what had happened, nobody could tell. He
  just appeared out of nowhere by the side of the grave, and when the ceremony
  was over he set out, with a cold grey eye and a grim line between his brows,
  to look for Marks. But Marks had somehow got to know what had happened, and
  he was nowhere to be found. He was found at last, and what Hayes regarded as
  an ill-directed shot smashed his shoulder-blade. Hayes probably left him for
  dead, and promptly disappeared. He would have stayed, in the ordinary course
  of events, and faced the music, but as there was a warrant out against him on
  two other charges, he probably realised the slenderness of his chances and
  vanished.</p>

  <p>Within an hour the Superintendent at Harris Fork was in full possession of
  the facts. He may have had his own ideas on the subject, but his duty was
  plain. He had to arrest Hayes, and, as he himself was wanted elsewhere, he
  had placed the matter in Macnaught's hands. The Sergeant worked it all out.
  He himself would ride over in the direction of Harris Fork, and two sections
  were telegraphed to meet him from the frontier on the far side of Eagle
  Ridge. They would thus take the criminal between them, and the rest would be
  easy.</p>

  <p>So Macnaught mounted his horse and started out to cross fifteen miles of
  broken mountain country between the station and Eagle Ridge. He had his map
  in his hand, and a photograph of the criminal, together with his description.
  He glanced at it again as he jogged along. Hayes, according to the printed
  matter, was a big, well-knit man, apparently about forty, with a clean-shaven
  broad face. The characteristics were not particularly marked, but it was good
  enough for Sergeant Macnaught, and he was feeling on good terms with himself
  as he made his way between the rocky passes to the high ground, with its
  fringes of pine, and visions of promotion lay before him. He was a kindly
  man, was Macnaught, despite the grim current of blood in his veins, because,
  you see, his mother had been Irish, and there were times when the sentimental
  mood dominated him.</p>

  <p>He was not thinking of that now&mdash;he was thinking what the
  Superintendent had said, and he was just a little uncertain in his mind as to
  the weather. For the first big snows of the year were due, there had been a
  hard frost last night, and the weather has a great deal to say to the puny
  schemes of men in that wild North-West Territory. In the ordinary way the
  ride to Eagle Ridge was in the nature of a picnic, but if the snow came, then
  it might end in a race for life.</p>

  <p>And over the high ground beyond, at the back of the nodding pines which
  looked down on Eagle Ridge, there were broken ragged splashes of cloud that
  gradually marshalled themselves together till the blackness of the pines was
  no blacker than the sky beyond. And then, when Macnaught was about half-way,
  the snow came down in earnest.</p>

  <p>It began with fine particles like spray; then, as the wind increased, it
  howled and swirled round Macnaught's head till his eyes were blind and he
  could see but a few feet in front of him. It was as if the whole world had
  been blotted out in a deluge of white&mdash;a howling, roaring world with a
  wind thrumming in the pines like harp-strings. It went on until the horse
  pul]ed up and, trembling in every muscle, refused to go any further.
  Macnaught dropped out of the saddle and sheltered himself as best he could
  behind his faithful beast. He stood there for an hour, until he was frozen to
  the very marrow, until every object in the dreary landscape was wiped out,
  and until he had not the remotest notion where he was. The white spindrift
  was knee-deep, and still creeping upwards like a tide, and then for the first
  time Macnaught recognised his peril. He turned his back to the wind and
  looked in the direction whence he had come&mdash;that was, as far as he could
  look any way. So far as he was concerned, he might have been inside the
  Arctic Circle. He dared not go back; to go forward was equal madness. But
  ever and again a torn wrack in the cloud showed the crest of pines on the
  distant hill, and he knew, at any rate, that Eagle Ridge lay over there. So
  he struggled on, walking his horse with increasing difficulty at every step,
  until he could move no further, then he fell helplessly to his knees, and the
  horse rolled over by his side.</p>

  <p>How long this had been going on he did not know. He could only guess, by
  the fading light, that it was late in the afternoon, and that, unless a
  miracle happened, he would never see Harris Fork again. A certain dumb apathy
  filled him, a certain carelessness as to the future. Well, he had done his
  best, and there was an end of it. He would not be the first Mounted Policeman
  who had perished by the wayside in the execution of his duty.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that he slept a little, and that presently he woke with
  something calling him. The wreaths of snow were still volleying round his
  head, the white battalions of the gale were still screaming in his ears, and
  he was frozen to the very soul. But surely someone was calling to him, some
  voice in his ear beckoning him on? Then he recognised the sound as that of
  the bark of a dog.</p>

  <p>A dog meant human companionship, a sledge, perhaps, and the thought of it
  galvanised Macnaught into life He struggled to his feet and yelled at the top
  of his voice. Then the dog barked again, and something that sounded like a
  faint "Hello!" was borne on the breast of the gale. Again Macnaught shouted,
  and this time a man unmistakably replied.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," the voice said. "I'll find you."</p>

  <p>It seemed an unconscionably long time&mdash; indeed, it was upwards of an
  hour&mdash;before two hands were placed under Macnaught's arms and he was
  dragged to his feet. As if conscious that help was at hand, the horse rose,
  too. And then followed a breathless struggle for life, which ended in another
  hour in front of a black cavity in the hillside &mdash;in other words, a cave
  with its back to the wind, into which Macnaught was dragged, together with
  his weary charger. Something trickled down his throat, he was conscious of
  warmth and the cuddling caress of furs, and then he realised that he was in a
  bit of a cave in which a fire was burning, and that a big man, with a
  careworn face and a brown beard streaked with grey, was looking at him in a
  kindly fashion.</p>

  <p>"That was a close call," the stranger said.</p>

  <p>"Aye, it was that," Macnaught replied. "But for you, I was down and out
  all right, and I'm not going to thank you. You must have had a bit of a
  struggle getting me here."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are here," the stranger said. "And now let me give you
  something to eat. You snuggle up in those furs whilst I fry a rasher of
  bacon. This isn't going to last long; we'll have the frost back before
  daylight."</p>

  <p>Macnaught ate presently and got his pipe going. Then he and his rescuer
  began to talk. The other man had been caught on his way through a pine path
  whence he was going down to the plain and the milder climate on the other
  side of the divide. He had been trading up at Eagle Ridge, and had, perhaps,
  been a little too anxious to get through the pass before the first snows
  fell. Luckily for him, he had his provisions and his dogs, and he had hit the
  cave in the hillside just at the psychological moment. His name, it appeared,
  was Prosser, and he was principally concerned in the fur trade. Then, under
  his eyes, he glanced casually at Macnaught's uniform.</p>

  <p>"Policeman, ain't you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's so," Macnaught admitted. "I was on my way to Eagle Ridge on
  business."</p>

  <p>The other man appeared to be interested.</p>

  <p>"I think I can guess," he said. "After Jim Hayes, ain't you?"</p>

  <p>There was no occasion to deny the fact, so Macnaught admitted it. He
  wanted to know if the other knew anything about the criminal.</p>

  <p>"I have met him," Prosser said. "Fact is, Jim and I were quite good
  friends at one time. He's not a bad sort, but has a devil of a temper, and is
  quite reckless of consequences when he is roused. I was down at Dingo City,
  and saw both those troubles he was in there. And you can take it from me,
  stranger, that it wasn't his fault either time. And as to that poisonous
  scoundrel Marks, I ain't blamin' Jim in the least. When you know how he
  suffered at that man's hands, and how his wife's death was entirely due to
  that villain, you would have been sorry for Jim, policeman though you
  are."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for him now," Macnaught said. "But then my private opinion has
  got nothing to do with it. If half I hear is true, Marks asked for all he
  got."</p>

  <p>"Aye, he did that," Prosser said. "I knew Mrs. Hayes well, and a dearer
  little woman But I'm not going into that. So you expect to get hold of Jim,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Sure to," Macnaught said laconically. "He must have been mad to have come
  back like that."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know," the other man drawled, as he sucked thoughtfully at
  his pipe. "Jim was sure fond of that pretty little wife of his. And I think,
  Sergeant, if you had ever seen her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Prosser broke off and stared intently into the stove as if he could see
  visions. He stroked his beard with the streaks of grey in it, and his eyes
  had a far-away look in them.</p>

  <p>"I knew Jim Hayes pretty well," he went on, "and I knew what he had to put
  up with. A plucky little woman, she was, and never said a word when Jim made
  up his mind to come up here prospecting in the mines. Not as he ever meant to
  stay. His idea was to make a fortune and get South, and he was in a hurry,
  too, because he could see what the winters hereabouts were doing for his
  missus. And then he struck it, him and Marks together, and he did all the
  work and took all the risk&mdash;he had plenty of that, let me tell
  you&mdash;until he won through and made Marks's fortune. Then there was that
  trouble down in Dingo City. He ought never to have got into that by rights,
  but, as I am telling you, he was always a headlong, impulsive sort of fool,
  and he wasn't quite as good at poker as he thought he was. But he wasn't
  going to be robbed, all the same, and that was the cause of the trouble. Then
  he must needs go back there again, right amongst 'em, and that time he had to
  fight for his life, whatever folks may say. And if the Sheriff hadn't been in
  it, and hadn't been half afraid of the gang, no more would have been heard of
  it; but they made it out wilful murder, and Jim, he had to fly. Couldn't come
  back any more, couldn't see his wife, though he wrote to her&mdash;wrote her
  a letter that she never got, because Marks saw to that. And when he heard the
  truth, it was too late. He came back to attend his wife's funeral and kill
  Marks, and, if I know anything of Jim, he's plum sorry he didn't succeed. I
  am telling you all this, Sergeant, because I know you are after Jim&mdash;I
  knew it as soon as I saw your uniform. You were going to catch him between
  two fires the other side of Eagle Ridge, and, but for this storm, you
  probably would have done so. Now, isn't that right?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly right," Macnaught agreed. "But I doubt if we shall do it now.
  He's probably perished in this storm, and, after what you have told me, I am
  not sorry, though, mind you, there was promotion waiting for me."</p>

  <p>"If you succeeded, eh? Well, perhaps you will yet."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, it's no pleasant job, mine," Macnaught said in half
  extenuation.</p>

  <p>"I see&mdash;you have got to do as you are told?"</p>

  <p>"That's right," Macnaught agreed. "But never mind about Hayes. You saved
  my life. It was a million to one against my getting through, and almost that
  against us finding our way here. And you must have known that, though you
  didn't mind taking your life in your hands with about as much chance of
  finding me as if I had been no more than a flake of snow. But you did it, and
  I don't know how to thank you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Prosser said casually. "It's more thanks to the
  dog than to me."</p>

  <p>He indicated the well-fed dog and the horse standing patiently in the
  corner, and refused to hear any more. So they sat there in the warmth, half
  buried in their furs, listening to the dying storm outside, and conscious
  presently of the increasing cold. Then Prosser rose and looked outside into a
  still white world where the wind had died to nothing, and overhead the stars,
  like spilt sheaves of golden grain, burned against a sky of granite.</p>

  <p>"It will be fine going in the morning," Prosser said. "Hard as iron in an
  hour or two, by which time, with any luck, I'll be through the pass down on
  to the plains. But it will come back again. It will come again before
  noon."</p>

  <p>With that he turned in, and the two men slept. It was broad daylight and
  well into the marrow of the morning before Macnaught crept out of his furs,
  only to find that Prosser and his team had gone. They must have been gone for
  some time, for the stove had burnt low, and the bacon which Prosser had
  cooked for his guest's breakfast lay tepid in its pan. Macnaught wondered at
  this sudden flight, until he recollected his host's prophecy that the storm
  would break again before long. Outside, the snow was frozen so hard that the
  tracks of the sledge were none too well marked. Over behind Eagle Ridge there
  was a violet haze, and near at hand a faint murmur within the pines that
  warned Macnaught of what was coming in the near future. So he hurried through
  his breakfast and slung himself on the back of his horse presently, and
  crossed the frozen plain in the direction of the settlement. He hurled along
  almost recklessly, for long before he reached Eagle Ridge the white cohorts
  were dancing about his head, so that he made the town and the big general
  store there with some difficulty. No sooner was he inside, seated in front of
  the stove, before the storm came down again in earnest. He sat there, turning
  over the events of the past few hours in his mind, and hoping that Prosser
  was through the pass before the demons of the air broke out again.</p>

  <p>There were half a dozen men seated round the stove, members of the
  settlement, hard, lean settlers, miners and others, discussing the weather in
  their slow and deliberate way, when the door of the store was flung open and
  three men entered. Macnaught recognised them at a glance. They were the
  sergeant and two troopers who had been told off to help him. One look into
  their faces, and Macnaught knew that they had failed. And the other men
  seated round the stove looked, too. They wanted no one to tell them what this
  detachment of Mounted Police was doing in Eagle Ridge. Macnaught saw a smile
  pass from face to face, a smile of quiet triumph, as he knew, and an
  indication that these people here were all on the side of Hayes. And they
  knew that justice had been baffled.</p>

  <p>"Hello! So you've got here?" Macnaught's fellow-sergeant greeted him. "Any
  luck?"</p>

  <p>"Most infernally lucky to get here," Macnaught said.</p>

  <p>"Same here," the other man responded. "The storm caught us last night, and
  we had to stop. Question, where is he now? Any of you men seen Jim
  Hayes?"</p>

  <p>Again the slow smile went round the stove like a mental telegraphy. The
  police had failed, and every man listening rejoiced in the fact. A lean
  individual seated in a corner turned slowly to the questioner.</p>

  <p>"Not since yesterday morning," he drawled. "Jim, he come unexpected, just
  out of nowhere, as it might be. And we 'uns here thinkin' him dead, and not
  one of us expecting him. He didn't come as you 'uns come now, sitting round
  the stove and passin' the time o' day. He come and stands by the side o' the
  grave where we was burying that wife o' his. It were yesterday mornin', an'
  most of us had turned out, because, you see, Jim's wife, she were sort o'
  popular, an' there wasn't one of us as wasn't ready to lend her a helpin'
  hand. She'd have died earlier, she would, but for some of us."</p>

  <p>"Well, get on," the Sergeant said impatiently.</p>

  <p>"You asked for facts an' I'm givin' 'em you, pard," the old man went on.
  "If ever a woman was murdered, it were Jim Hayes's wife. And who murdered
  her? It were that pesky skunk of a Marks&mdash;him as is lyin' in his hut now
  with a bullet through the shoulder that ought to have killed him, the dirty
  swab. Not as we knew it, because we didn't know as the claim had turned out
  so well. But we know it now, because yesterday, Jim he up and told us."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do get on!" the Sergeant exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm comin' to it all right, mister. There we was round the grave of
  the whitest little woman in the State, and she done to death by Marks because
  he thought her husband was gone, and that he could rob her of what was her
  due, and she working to keep body and soul together, and half dying o' the
  cold! And if we'd only known it, we'd have had his black heart out o' him
  long ago!"</p>

  <p>The Sergeant stirred impatiently, but nothing seemed to disturb the even
  tenor of the speaker.</p>

  <p>"We was standin' round the grave," he said, "an' parson, he just spoke his
  last piece, when there comes a man pushing his way through the crowd, right
  and left, and he stands by the side o' the grave an' looks down at it
  sorrowful like, though his face was hard enough as if it had been frozen. And
  there 'e stands, and we wonderin', till I looks at 'im again, with his bowed
  head and bent shoulders, and that brown beard o' his with the streaks o' grey
  in it, an' I says to myself: 'By the livin' Moses, if it ain't Jim Hayes!'
  An' Jim Hayes it was&mdash;aye, Jim right enough."</p>

  <p>The old man paused, with some sense of the dramatic values, and gazed
  triumphantly around him. Macnaught sat there, the illumination almost
  blinding him.</p>

  <p>"Stop a moment," he said, in a voice that he hoped was steady. "How long
  had Jim Hayes had a beard? From our description of him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know nothin' about that," the old man said obstinately. "He used
  to be smooth-faced, but he's got a beard now right enough, and it was Jim,
  too. I calls out, and the others see I was right, an' Jim, he turns to us
  when it was all over, and he asks where Marks was, and when we'd heard his
  story we told him. So he lays out for Marks, an' late in the afternoon he got
  him. Left him for dead. Then he gets his team together and off he goes. And
  that's the truth, Sergeant, as any man around the stove will tell you."</p>

  <p>A long silence followed, whilst every man was turning the problem over in
  his mind. Either Hayes had got away down the pass in the direction of the
  valleys on his way to the frontier, where he would be safe, or he had been
  caught in the big storm and had perished. As to this, they would know in
  time. But the one man there who could have told them everything sat sucking
  at his dead pipe and stared into the stove.</p>

  <p>For Macnaught knew that Hayes had got away in safety, and, so far as he
  was concerned, there was one incident in the chronicles of the North-Western
  Police that would never be told.</p>

     name="story4">4.&mdash;THE BROKEN LUTE</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY HOWARD K. ELCOCK</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. LIII, May 1921, pp
  604-609</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE strange and tragic disappearance of Eugene Lastaire
  created quite a sensation even outside musical circles. It was too big a
  thing for the newspapers to miss, and accordingly they made the most of it.
  From such meagre information as the Press could gather, Lastaire had left
  London for a remote village in Devonshire after a somewhat unpleasant
  interview with Dennie Morthoe at the National Opera House. Everybody knew
  Morthoe was the lessee of that famous building, and one of the leading
  impresarios in Europe. A rich man himself and a musician of undoubted power
  and genius, Morthoe's great ambition was to form a school of opera of his
  own, and for this purpose he had sunk a vast fortune in the National Opera
  House, where he had gathered around him a collection of the most famous
  singers and musicians in the world. And not the least amongst these was
  Eugene Lastaire.</p>

  <p>He had come to Morthoe a few months before, without reputation and without
  introduction, from one of the big schools of music on the Continent. What his
  nationality was, Morthoe had never gathered, for on that point Lastaire was
  both shy and secretive. That there was native blood in his veins Morthoe had
  not the slightest doubt. All he could gather was that this <i>proteg</i> of
  his had drifted westward from somewhere on the American coast in the
  neighbourhood of the Gulf of Florida, and that he had picked up a certain
  amount of education where he could find it. He was very dark&mdash;so dark,
  indeed, that the suggestion of negro blood in his veins was apparent to most
  people, which might have accounted for his sensitive nature. But this
  mattered little or nothing to a broad-minded and cosmopolitan musician and
  sportsman like Morthoe. It was enough for him that Lastaire was a great
  musical genius, with an almost boundless future before him. Like most
  pioneers, he had had to struggle hard; but Morthoe saw to it from the first
  that he had his chance, so that within a few months the discerning critics
  began to point Lastaire out as the coming man. And, indeed, one or two of his
  compositions had already carried him a long way.</p>

  <p>It was at this point that he came to Morthoe with a first complete act of
  a new opera which aroused Morthoe to a high pitch of enthusiasm. The
  wonderful colour and melody of the work appealed strongly to him, for here
  was not only a great musical attainment, but a breadth and originality that
  promised fine things in the future.</p>

  <p>Morthoe had literally jumped at it. If the opera finished as it had begun,
  then without doubt the new work would see the light at the National Opera
  House. Lastaire was advised to go away and devote his whole time to the
  completion of his masterpiece.</p>

  <p>With this commission in his pocket, he went down to the north coast of
  Devon, where he worked on the opera day and night, writing and publishing
  musical trifles in the meantime as a kind of relaxation. And it was one of
  these slight melodies of his that led up to the tragedy.</p>

  <p>It was only a little trifle in the way of a folk song, a weird, haunting,
  curious bit of work, full of original touches and alive with the fire of
  genius. It had been published by a West End firm, and immediately jumped into
  popularity. A few days later a letter from Sir John Follett, the well-known
  English composer, had appeared in <i>The Times</i>, in which letter Follett
  deliberately accused Lastaire of stealing one of his own original melodies.
  Sir John's work had not yet been published, but he was able to prove on
  pretty conclusive evidence that he was the composer of the work that Lastaire
  had published. And naturally a man so prominent before the public and of such
  high standing was believed in preference to the passionate protest made by
  Lastaire that his melody had been inspired by some rude folk song that he had
  heard in his youth in the huts of the aborigines on the Gulf of Florida; but
  as he had no evidence to prove this, and as ho was in direct conflict with
  the great English composer, he suffered. Works of his were sent back by
  publishers, and it looked as if Lastaire's star was setting almost before it
  had begun to rise.</p>

  <p>That a man of Lastaire's temperament should take the thing greatly to
  heart was only natural. Seeing himself baffled and defeated, not to say
  disgraced, and knowing that what he said was true, he had turned his back on
  London and gone into Devonshire. He had refused to see Morthoe, who still
  believed in him, and who, in spite of everything, was quite prepared to carry
  out his promise so far as the opera was concerned.</p>

  <p>A day or two later Lastaire disappeared. He had gone for a lonely walk
  along the cliffs on a stormy afternoon, and he had never returned. His stick
  and hat were found, but though the days went on, no single trace of the
  missing musician had been discovered. Morthoe went down there himself to
  investigate, but, however, without result. And so a month passed, and
  Lastaire was beginning to be forgotten.</p>

  <p>And then a strange thing happened.</p>

  <p>One morning Sir John Follett burst into Morthoe 's office at the National
  Opera House in a great state of excitement. His kindly, rosy face showed
  signs of every concern, the eyes behind the gold-rimmed spectacles were full
  of remorse. He flung himself into a chair opposite Morthoe.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the matter?" Morthoe asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear fellow," Follett said, "I hardly know how to tell you. I have
  behaved like a scoundrel, an absolute scoundrel! How on earth I came to
  forget it, I don't know. Look here, Morthoe, I feel like a thief! I am a
  thief! I have stolen a man's reputation!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are talking of Lastaire!" Morthoe cried.</p>

  <p>"I am. Now, you know what I told you. You know what I wrote to <i>The
  Times</i>. When I sent off that letter, I honestly believed every word of it.
  It wasn't true, Morthoe, it wasn't true! I feel as if I had that poor young
  man's blood on my soul! I murdered him!"</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it," Morthoe said soothingly.</p>

  <p>"What is there to tell? You know as much about it as I do. I thought that
  Lastaire had managed to get sight of that melody of mine one day he called at
  the School of Music. He could have done so easily enough. And you know I
  proved that my melody was written before he thought of his. And now I am not
  so sure. Not so sure! I know that I have done him an injustice. My dear
  fellow, my melody wasn't original."</p>

  <p>"What on earth " Morthoe began.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was like this. Late last night I was looking over a pile of
  yellow manuscript that I bought years ago in Scotland. It's quaint stuff, and
  must have been written I don't know how many centuries ago&mdash;folk
  melodies from the Hebrides, melodies that go back to the beginning of music,
  melodies played on a sinew stretched on a bone&mdash; and quite unconsciously
  I must have adapted the disputed song from those manuscripts. You know how
  things go round and round in your mind till you begin to think they are your
  own&mdash;sort of unconscious plagiarism. Poets and novelists have done it,
  and why not musicians? I have compared my music with the source from which I
  obtained it, and the similarity is remarkable."</p>

  <p>"That's very strange," Morthoe said. "And yet I don't know. Music, like
  language, must have come from somewhere. Some genius invented it in the Dark
  Ages, and it must have spread from continent to continent, very likely in the
  glacial period, before the great oceans were formed. I shouldn't be surprised
  if the folk music of the world had come from a common stock."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's the point." Follett said eagerly. "I am an Englishman, and I
  learnt my music in London. I wonder how much of my work has been inspired by
  this old folk stuff, if I only knew it? And all the time I have been priding
  myself that it is my own! I have done Lastaire an injustice. I don't doubt
  for a moment that he was telling the truth when he said that melody of his
  had been adapted from an air played on a tom-tom or suchlike instrument in
  some native village away yonder on the Gulf of Mexico. And here am I, past
  the meridian of life, cruel enough to kill a genius! That's what it comes to,
  Morthoe. I murdered that wonderful genius of yours. I am a thief, a charlatan
  living upon my musical memory! I can't tell you how distressed I am. What can
  I do? I can only write a letter to <i>The Times</i>, deploring my mistake,
  and do my best to give the dead man back his reputation. He was a genius,
  Morthoe."</p>

  <p>"He was indeed," Morthoe sighed, "and if things had gone all right, he
  would have stood before the world as the composer of the most magnificent
  opera we have had for the last twenty-five years. I say that because I know,
  because I have the first act in my safe yonder. I have never shown it to a
  single soul, and I don't suppose I ever shall now&mdash;unless, perhaps, I
  play it as a fragment&mdash;because I should never be vandal enough to give
  anybody the commission to complete it. I was going to take that opera round
  the world. It was going to be the great new work with which I was proud to
  identify myself. The tour is all complete. We are going to Paris and
  Stockholm and Milan, thence to America and Australia, and come back to Long
  Beach and those famous winter resorts along the coast of Florida. We shall
  start in about six months' time, and probably be away for three years. It's
  the biggest world's tour undertaken by an operatic company. And, after what
  you have told me, I would give half what I possess to know that Eugene
  Lastaire was going with us. He was to have superintended the production of
  his own opera and, of course, conduct it. The rest of the time I had engaged
  him for first violin in the orchestra. This is a shocking business, Follett."
  "It is indeed," Follett groaned. "I am entirely in your hands, Morthoe. I'll
  do anything you like." "Yes, but what can you do?" Morthoe asked. "You can
  only write what you have told me to <i>The Times</i>, and do the best you can
  to rehabilitate the poor chap's memory." And so itcame about that the musical
  papers and others were flled for some days with the strange story that Sir
  John Follett had to tell. Reams were written on old folk songs, and one of
  the daily papers went so far as to print the facsimile of Follett's song and
  the crabbed inspiration from which it was derived. Undoubtedly a great
  reaction had begun in Lastaire's favour, and his memory was held to have been
  cleansed of all suspicion and dishonour.</p>

  <p>But unfortunately all this could not bring the dead man back to life
  again. Naturally enough, in a few days the incident was forgotten, except by
  Morthoe and one or two friends who had liked Lastaire, and were genuinely
  grieved over the mistake that had caused him, in a moment of despair, to lay
  violent hands upon himself. And so the time went on. Months passed, and the
  great world's tour of the Morthoe International Opera Company was drawing to
  a close. They had been all over Europe and the colonies in one long blaze of
  triumph, and at length they had reached the fashionable town of Long Beach,
  where all that counts in America had gathered for one of the most brilliant
  winter seasons that that famous spot had ever experienced. Big as Long Beach
  was, it was not big enough to detain Morthoe more than three nights.</p>

  <p>On the third night it was his intention to conduct "La Bohme" himself, as
  he had conducted "Pagliacci" at the opening performance, filling up his time
  during the day with fishing in the bay, a sport of which he was passionately
  fond. The hotel in which he was staying was full of sportsmen, all of whom
  were there for the tarpon fishing, and with some of these Morthoe had gone
  out each morning until the last day of his stay there, when he took a boat
  and a native, and went out alone.</p>

  <p>It was a perfect morning, with a light breeze blowing from the west, an
  ideal day for the sea. Here and there along the bay little islands and
  peninsulas were dotted, green oases in that glorious sea, where the few
  original natives who were left plied their craft and tilled their ground much
  as their forefathers had done any time since the world began. They were
  inviting little islands, these&mdash;indeed, some of them were of
  considerable extent&mdash;only a mile or two from the mainland, and therefore
  in close touch with the shore.</p>

  <p>Morthoe sat there in the boat with a sort of glad feeling that he was
  alive, his mind intent on his sport, which, by the contrariness of things,
  was anything but good. He had not as yet succeeded in hooking one of the big
  silver fish to his own rod, and, as time was short, he was loth to leave that
  delectable corner of the earth until he had added to his sporting
  experiences.</p>

  <p>The copper-coloured native working the boat shook his head gently. So far
  as Morthoe could gather from his jargon, he was deploring the fact that the
  wind was in the wrong direction for tarpon fishing, and that it would have
  been better if there had been a ripple on the water. But it lay now in one
  sheet of gold and opal and pallid blue right away to the misty horizon, where
  a few smudges of cloud were drifting inland from the sea. There was nothing
  else to do but to sit quietly in the boat, smoking and idling the time away
  until perhaps late in the afternoon a breeze would spring up, and then it
  might be possible to land a fish that was worthy of the occasion.</p>

  <p>Morthoe sat there dreaming, with his pipe between his lips, after a
  luxurious luncheon and a glass or two of champagne. He was seated in the bow
  of the boat, making himself as comfortable as possible on a pile of
  sailcloth, and half asleep, when he suddenly sat up and looked at the dusky
  native in the stern. The man was gazing out to sea with eyes almost as sleepy
  as Morthoe's own, his lips were parted as he crooned a peculiar melody gently
  to himself .</p>

  <p>And Morthoe recognised it instantly. It was the very air that had been the
  cause of all the trouble between Follett and Lastaire. Very quietly Morthoe
  sat there until the last bar was finished. There was no question about it.
  Beyond doubt, thousands of miles away from London, he was listening to a
  melody that had cost one man's life, and the melody, moreover, which was
  common to that languid sun-kissed coast and the rude salt breezes of the
  Hebrides. With a curious feeling upon him and with a voice not altogether
  steady, Morthoe addressed his guide.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get that from, Sammy?" he said slowly. "I mean, who taught
  you the song you are singing?"</p>

  <p>The native showed his yellow teeth in a grin.</p>

  <p>"Nonebody taught me, sah," he said. "We all knows him. Him come from
  nowhere. Him sung by little piccaninnies as soon as dey knows anything.
  Fousands and fousands of years they sung him dese parts."</p>

  <p>"What's it called?" Morthoe asked.</p>

  <p>"Not called nothing, sah. Got no name, same as gentleman an' Sam here. You
  give me half dollar, an' I sing you more."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Morthoe said good-naturedly. "Go on."</p>

  <p>For the best part of an hour he listened, with an attention that Sam found
  decidedly flattering, to little snatches of queer haunting melody that
  sounded strange and yet familiar. Here and there Morthoe could undoubtedly
  pick out an air that bore a queer resemblance to more than one classical bit;
  but all this was as nothing to the startling discovery that there, floating
  on the heart of the glorious summer sea, he had found proof positive of the
  truth of Lastaire's statement.</p>

  <p>He came back to himself presently, to the realisation of things, and the
  fact that a strong breeze had come up from behind a bank of black cloud
  sliding along the horizon, and that the boat was dipping and pitching on the
  sea, that carried white crests as far as the eye could reach. The whole
  character of the afternoon had changed, and Sam, deeply interested in a
  conscientious endeavour to earn his half dollar, had not noticed it. Then he
  ceased to chant in that monotonous way of his and got the oars out.</p>

  <p>By this time there was not a craft in sight&mdash;all the rest of the
  fishermen had put in long ago&mdash;and along the beach the surf was
  screaming and beating in huge waves. Every moment now the sea was getting
  higher.</p>

  <p>Five minutes ago they had been safe enough, and now, to all appearances,
  they were in dire peril. With the tide against them, they could not beat
  inshore; there was nothing for it now, so far as Morthoe could see, but to
  run before the gale and make for one of those little green islands on the
  sea.</p>

  <p>"We're in danger, aren't we?" Morthoe asked.</p>

  <p>"Much danger for you, sah," Sam said coolly. "We no get back&mdash;can't
  be done. Then we make for one of de banks, an' when boat bump all to pieces
  on sand, you swim."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," Morthoe said between his teeth. "I'm a fair swimmer, Sam.
  but I don't think I'd have much chance in a surf like that. What about
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sam all right," that worthy grinned. "Sam swim before he walk. You no
  worry 'bout Sam."</p>

  <p>"I'm not," Morthoe said. "Now push on."</p>

  <p>They pushed on accordingly through a white whirl of water in the direction
  of one of the green patches, which was now blurred and indistinct behind a
  curtain of flying foam and torrents of rain. They lurched forward, buffeted
  here and there by the wind, and carried over and over again out of their
  track by powerful cross-currents, so that a score of times they were swept
  past the beach that Sam was making for, and where he knew that the shelter of
  the curving shore might afford a possible landing for his passenger. For
  himself, he cared not at all; he knew every trick and turn of the tide and
  every swirl of the ocean current as he knew the palm of his own hand. He
  might be tossed presently like a cork on the surface of that boiling sea, but
  he had no doubt that the time would come when he would find himself with his
  feet on firm ground again. And so they struggled on, drifting here and there
  until darkness fell and they lay in the heart of the violet night with the
  storm halloing round them. There was no word spoken, for they were both busy
  enough in baling out the boat. And then presently, when Morthoe was beginning
  to wonder how much longer this was going on, something seemed to strike him
  and toss him as if he had been no heavier than a feather, and when he came
  down again he was struggling and fighting for his life in a howling waste of
  water. The boat had come down violently on the sands, and in the twinkling of
  an eye had been torn to matchwood.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301081h-images/TheBrokenLute.jpg"
         title="...fighting for his life in a howling waste of water.">
  </div><br>

  <p>With the desire to live strong within him, Morthoe struck out wildly,
  fighting in the darkness, half blind and breathless for what seemed to him to
  be hours. Then his knees encountered something soft and yielding, and a
  moment later he struggled to his feet. A big wave, rushing up the beach,
  caught him violently in the back and tossed him headlong on to a dry spit of
  sand. By some blind instinct he scrambled forward until, so far as he could
  see, he stood under the shadow of a fringe of palms, and then it began to be
  borne upon him that he was safe. A little while later he started to make his
  way inland, with the object of finding some habitation.</p>

  <p>He was not in the least cold, for the night was soft and warm, nor was he
  conscious of any particular feeling of fatigue. He did not know what time it
  was, he did not much care. It could not be very late yet, because he could
  see the big electric arcs all along the fringe of the mainland, and the
  lights glittering redly in the hotel windows. He smiled to himself as he
  thought of the story he would have to tell on the morrow. Then just in front
  of him he saw a light glowing in what he took to be the window of a small
  native house. He hastened towards it, with the idea of food and dry clothing
  uppermost in his mind, then suddenly paused just outside, as the sound of
  music struck on his ear.</p>

  <p>Somebody inside the hut was playing the violin, and playing it exceedingly
  well. And, strangely enough, the melody that wailed from those strings was
  the same that Morthoe had heard that afternoon, and the same that had led up
  to the tragedy of Lastaire.</p>

  <p>With a curious feeling of tightening across the chest and a strange
  premonition that something was about to happen, Morthoe crept forward and
  opened the door of the hut. In the excitement of the moment he did not even
  stop to knock.</p>

  <p>He saw a neat little room, lighted by one oil lamp that hung from the
  ceiling. He saw a heap of MSS. littered on the side-table, and a man with a
  violin in his hand standing before a sheet of music propped up in front of
  him. Very silently Morthoe crept forward.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Lastaire!"he said. "Thank God, I have found you at last!"</p><br>

     name="story5">5.&mdash;THE MASTER'S VOICE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 5 Nov
  1921</h3><br>

  <p class="first">EVERARD DIX was exceedingly sorry, but so far as he could
  see there was no help for it, as he explained to his friend, Max Clayton, as
  they sat over a cigar in the former's comfortable flat after dinner. Max
  Clayton was a writer of some repute, with aspirations in the direction of the
  stage, and Everard Dix had promised to finance the new comedy which was
  destined to mark an epoch in the history of the drama. And so on.</p>

  <p>"It's a blow," Clayton murmured. "It's a blow, and there's no getting over
  it. But I know you too well to think that you would let me down without some
  very good reason."</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's reason enough, all right," Dix groaned. "And I owe you an
  explanation. Now, you know what my business is, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, something to do with paper, I believe," Clayton said vaguely.
  "Something in the City."</p>

  <p>"Yes, we make paper, but only of a peculiar kind. It's the sort of stuff
  that bank notes and exchequer bonds and all those kind of things are printed
  on. With the possible exception of the Bank of England note paper, there is
  nothing like it, and we have always boasted that it cannot be forged. And
  that, my dear chap, is where we made a mistake, and that, indirectly, is why
  I can't let you have the money."</p>

  <p>"That is interesting. Go on."</p>

  <p>"Recently we lost one or two big contracts in America because a clever
  gang there have been extensively forging gold dollar bonds on a splendid
  imitation of our paper. Most of our paper has been supplied to a firm called
  Goldsack, in Liverpool, who are probably the biggest printers of Government
  and bank securities in the world. Amongst their secrets is a marvellous ink,
  the ingredients of which are only known to the heads of the firm themselves,
  and with that ink, plus our paper, we were able to laugh at forgers. But not
  now. My idea was to get a new paper that would only take the Goldsack ink,
  and that if the printing was tampered with the forgery would be detected at a
  glance. And I managed it."</p>

  <p>"Then what have you got to worry about?" Clayton asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, my idea was to get a paper that would show forgery by heat or
  damping, so that they would change colour. In other words, supposing you
  warmed one of those securities, or wetted it with a moistened finger, the ink
  would change colour, that is on a genuine bill. If the thing was a forgery
  then there would be no change. And I did it."</p>

  <p>"Well," Clayton said. "If you've done that you ought to be a jolly sight
  better off than ever."</p>

  <p>"I did it, and sent on a specimen of the work to Goldsack's in Liverpool.
  But it never got there. Three specimens went through the post, and none of
  them were delivered. Then we tried registering. The postman who delivered the
  registered letters was waylaid in a business lane in Liverpool, and robbed of
  his bag. That had been fairly early in the morning, before people were about,
  and not so difficult as it sounds. I telephoned Goldsacks, but I'm not quite
  sure they believe my story. Our paper is perfect, and I can do all we claim
  in connection with Goldsack ink. But I can't get the specimen up to
  Liverpool. I don't want to go myself, because those chaps will be watching
  me, and I don't feel inclined to trust anybody else. Now, can't you think of
  some scheme to get to Goldsack's without incurring the suspicions of those
  rascals? I don't want them to know anything about it. I want to make them
  feel that we have dropped the whole business, as it is too dangerous to go on
  with. You are an ingenious-minded chap, who has written a good many clever
  stories&mdash;can't you show me a way? It's worth thinking about, even if
  only for your own sake."</p>

  <p>Clayton helped himself to a fresh cigar, and smoked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Did you ever read a story of Poe's called 'The Purloined Letter'?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I can't cay I have," Dix said languidly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, that's a pity. It's all about a clever political Johnny who
  stole a compromising letter which he had to use daily, and which he hid from
  the police, who were searching for it day and night. They couldn't find it,
  because he had put it in a place where everybody could see it. It doesn't
  sound very much told in bald words, but it is one of the most convincing
  stories, in the English language."</p>

  <p>"I begin to see your drift," Dix said more enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Here, let me have a chance. And if you'll give me a dummy parcel, a kind
  of forgery of what I have to deliver, put up in a separate envelope with your
  seal on it, then I think I can properly fool those chaps. It's just as well,
  perhaps, in that envelope, to write a few lines to the effect that you have
  done the best you could, but that you regret to say that so far your efforts
  have not been crowned with success, and that in the meantime you are sorry
  that pressure of other business&mdash;well, you know what I mean. Give me
  that, and the real thing in another sealed envelope, and if I fail, well, I
  do."</p>

  <p>Dix smiled behind his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear chap, don't be absurd," he said. "You must come to grief.
  Why, you couldn't keep it secret for five minutes. Everybody would know what
  you are going to do, and you will be robbed of that paper long before you get
  to Liverpool. Besides, you have been in and out of my office every day for
  the last fortnight, and if there is treachery, as I suspect, then the foe
  will be certain to have a tip, and keep their eye on you if it gets known
  that you are even contemplating going to Liverpool. Oh, it's impossible."</p>

  <p>"Look here," Clayton said eagerly. "I can only fail, like the rest of
  them. I want to walk into your office in my own inconsequent way, and ask you
  before your staff if you've got the stuff ready for me, as I propose to go to
  Liverpool, say, the day after to-morrow. You can frown and look annoyed, and
  take me into your private room, and there hand over to me the real thing. But
  the skeleton envelope must reach me without any one being any the wiser. I
  wonder if you'll give it to me to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can, of course."</p>

  <p>"Then let me have it, and I will go to Liverpool by the night mail the day
  after to-morrow, having first come round to your office openly as arranged.
  Then, on the following evening, you dine with me at the Caf Royal, and see
  me into a taxi on the way to Euston. Before I go, I shall openly ask the
  waiter to give me one of those glass flagons of special whisky they keep, and
  you will see me throw it into the bag by my side. Then all you've got to do
  is to go quietly to bed, and I'll come round within a week and collect that
  thousand pounds as per contract. Oh, you needn't worry, I'm not going to
  fail."</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," Dix said finally. "I'll make up a parcel now for you to
  take away, and the next scene of the comedy had better take place in my outer
  office after lunch on Thursday afternoon, which I think is the day you
  propose to go to Liverpool."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">There were a score or more of clerks in the outer office as
  Clayton entered, on the following Thursday, including Dix himself, who had
  apparently just come back from lunch. Clayton hailed him in his usual free
  and easy style in a voice that could be heard all over the office.</p>

  <p>"Well, here I am," he cried. "And I haven't much time to lose. I might,
  with any luck, be able to meet you this evening at the Caf Royal for a
  mouthful of dinner before I catch the Liverpool express, but it is only a
  sporting chance, and if I am not there by 8 o'clock don't you wait. You had
  better give me those papers now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dix frowned, and appeared to bite his lip. He glanced somewhat uneasily
  round the crowded office, and signified to Clayton to follow him into his
  private room.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know what you are doing," he said, dubiously. "I have put
  myself into your hands, as I said I would, but it looks to me as if you were
  simply asking for trouble. Didn't I tell you I suspected treachery in the
  office?"</p>

  <p>"It's all a part of the programme," Clayton explained. "And all a part of
  the scheme I hinted at the other night. The master's voice, and all the rest
  of it. Now, give me that other parcel. I suppose it's all right. I guess you
  have got the genuine article this time?"</p>

  <p>"Sure thing!" Dix responded. "And if you are successful you get the
  cheque, and I make&mdash;well, goodness knows how much. But tell
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a single word, my boy. Now, you turn up at 8 o'clock, and don't worry
  yourself any more about it until you see me in London again."</p>

  <p>It was a little after 8 that Clayton bustled into the Caf Royal, and took
  a seat at a table where Dix was already waiting him. He was, apparently, in
  the highest spirits, he spoke freely in that somewhat strident voice of his,
  he did ample justice to a good dinner, and subsequently turned to the waiter
  with an order for one of those special flagons of whisky for which the house
  is famous. It came presently in the form of a little round flat bottle, the
  sort of thing that used to be called a pocket pistol, and this Clayton
  dropped carelessly into the kitbag that stood by the side of his chair. Half
  an hour later he got into a taxi, and made his way to Euston station. There
  he entered the express train, and placed this bag in a corner seat inside a
  first class corridor carriage. Then, as there was plenty of time to spare, he
  walked off down the long platform, apparently in search of papers. The
  guard's whistle had already gone when he boarded the train again and took his
  seat in the carriage.</p>

  <p>The compartment was no longer empty. On one side of him was a well-dressed
  woman, more or less elaborately clad in furs, and on the opposite side a
  youngish man, well turned out and aristocratic-looking, who carried about him
  a subtle suggestion of the army. Just as the train was about to move out of
  the station the inspector came to examine the tickets, and the man on the
  opposite seat suggested that the inspector would be the richer by half a
  crown if he placed a reserved label on the carriage window next to the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>"I hope you don't mind, sir," he said, as he turned smilingly to Clayton.
  "You see, we shan't be in Liverpool till 4 o'clock in the morning, and my
  wife and I hope to get a little sleep. People are fond of wandering about in
  these corridor trains from one compartment to another&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly," Clayton said. "That's rather a good idea of yours. I
  never thought of that. But, then, you see, I am not much of a traveller."</p>

  <p>There was a certain amount of fitful conversation afterwards between the
  three occupants of the carriage, then gradually it ceased, and Clayton's
  companions appeared to slumber. It was nearly 12 o'clock before the dramatist
  reached his bag down from the rack, and proceeded to take a liberal portion
  of the special whisky from his flask, which he diluted in a travelling cup
  with a small quantity of soda. Then he finished his cigar, made himself as
  comfortable as possible, and in turn closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>When he came to himself again the train had come to a standstill,
  apparently in some terminus, and Clayton came out of a confused dream to find
  that a porter was standing over him. Then, in a dazed kind of way, he heard
  the man's voice.</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir," he said. "But this train 'as been in for quite ten
  minutes. I shouldn't 'ave known you'd been 'ere at all, sir, only I 'appened
  to look into the carriage to see if there was any stray newspapers lying
  about. You must 'ave been very sound asleep."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I was," Clayton admitted. "You don't mean to say that it is
  past 4 o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes past, sir. But aren't you well?"</p>

  <p>"I do feel most uncommonly stupid," Clayton said. "Here, take my bag and
  put it on a taxi."</p>

  <p>Clayton stumbled out of the carriage in a dazed sort of way, and lurched
  along the deserted platform very much like a man who is getting over a fit of
  intoxication. His head was aching, and there was a nasty taste in his mouth.
  But this was not troubling him much, nor the fact discovered later on that
  the sealed packet which he had carried in the breast-pocket of his overcoat
  was missing. Apparently his travelling companions had vanished some time
  before, without making any attempt to wake him, and Clayton's thoughts were
  just a little confused as he drove along through the streets in the direction
  of the Adelphi Hotel. There he registered and went straight to bed, where he
  remained till well into the afternoon, by which time he was practically
  himself again. He partook of a hearty lunch, and then called for the local
  directory. He was busy for most of the afternoon and the best part of the
  evening, but apparently so pleased was he with the result of his labours that
  it was early in the following week that he made his way back to London again.
  During that time he made no attempt whatever to communicate with Dix, and it
  was Wednesday afternoon before the found himself free to call up Dix on the
  telephone, making an appointment to meet his friend at the latter's flat at 7
  o'clock in the evening.</p>

  <p>"Are you quite alone there?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Dix said. "I am using the private 'phone of my own office. Yes,
  I'll see you at 7 o'clock; in fact, you'd better come round to dinner."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Clayton said. "And you mind it's a jolly good dinner,
  too, because I've earned it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have, have you?" Dix asked. "Why on earth didn't you send me a
  wire, or call me up on the telephone. I've been worried to death about
  you."</p>

  <p>"Not good enough," Clayton explained. "You might have been out, and
  possibly the very man in your employ whom you suspect might have answered the
  telephone. But I'll tell you all about it when we meet this evening. Ring
  off."</p>

  <p>Dix did so reluctantly. He was waiting in his flat impatiently enough for
  Clayton to put in an appearance, which the latter did all in good time,
  though he refused to say a single word till he had done ample justice to a
  good dinner, and was lying back in his chair with a choice cigar between his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Now then, out with it," Dix said. "Or I shall do you a violence. Did you
  manage it?"</p>

  <p>"In one word, I did," Clayton replied. "I handed over that skeleton
  security to old Goldsack himself, and gave him a pretty general idea of what
  was going on. When the old chap properly realised what a desperate gang we
  had been up against he was properly impressed. Of course, he treated me as
  your confidential agent, and I was permitted to see all the tests that your
  work was put to. No, you needn't ask any questions, they were all absolutely
  successful, and Goldsack told me that in future they would have no hesitation
  in using your new paper for all their best impressions. So you see I did get
  the thing through, as I said I should, and, what's more, those enemies of
  yours have gone off under the impression that all your efforts have been
  failures, and that they can return to the States under the happy delusion
  that they can continue their forgeries with impunity. Well, if the American
  police do their duty, the whole of the gang will be laid by the heels before
  many months are up. The best thing you can do is to sack the people you
  suspect, because you are likely to have some pretty fat orders from old
  Goldsack at an early date."</p>

  <p>Dix drew a long breath of relief.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right," he said. "My dear fellow, you have put me under
  an obligation that I can never repay. Of course, you shall have the money for
  your comedy, and more if necessary, and even then I shall be in your debt.
  But I don't quite understand how you worked it, all the same."</p>

  <p>"Well, I came here to tell you," Clayton said. "And it's very simple,
  after all. Now, I knew perfectly well, from what you told me, that I should
  be followed to Liverpool. One of your clerks gave the game away after I was
  in your office last week, and we were shadowed to the Caf Royal. In my
  overcoat pocket I had the dummy parcel, and in the lining of my kit bag was
  the real thing. When we were at the Caf Royal I spotted the people who were
  after us. They were seated at the next table, and heard every word we said.
  They saw me take that parcel out of my overcoat pocket and put it back again.
  And, of course, they heard me order that whisky. When I got to Euston station
  I posted the genuine papers to myself, after taking them out of my kit bag
  and re-addressing them to the Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool, to make sure. When I
  returned to my carriage, there, sure enough, were the two people, a man and a
  woman, who had been dining at the Caf Royal. Of course, they'd seen me put
  my kit bag in the corner of the carriage, but they didn't mind that. And I
  didn't mind the man tipping the guard to put a reserved notice on the
  carriage, because he said he and his wife wanted to sleep. Directly after we
  got to the Caf Royal they also ordered a flagon of whisky, which, no doubt,
  they doctored on the way to Euston with the dope they had prepared for me,
  and when my back was turned, and my kit hag proving to be unlocked, the
  flagons were changed. You see, that prevented any violence, which people of
  that sort always avoid if they can. So, apparently, I walked into their trap
  with my eyes open, and when I was under the influence of the drug they took
  the bogus envelope out of my overcoat pocket, and, of course, from their
  point of view, all was lovely in the garden."</p>

  <p>'"That stuff might have killed you," Dix exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, those kind of people don't go in for drama like that. I guessed I
  was going to be drugged, and took the stuff because I wanted these people to
  know that I was insensible when they robbed me, and not shamming. And,
  besides, it was experience. I know now what it feels like to be drugged, and
  therefore, if ever I write about it, I shall do so at first hand. So you see,
  like a conjurer, I forced my card on those people, and they took it quite
  innocently. So there you are, that's the whole story. Anybody could have done
  it."</p>

  <p>"Could they, indeed!" Dix murmured admiringly. "Well, I beg to differ.
  But, at any rate, you have earned your money, and I shall be only too pleased
  to pay it to you."</p><br>

  <p class="first">"IT seems to me," said the first conspirator, with the air
  of a man who makes a discovery, "it seems to me that we are lost."</p>

  <p>"If you are discovered," murmured the second conspirator, "you are
  lost."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, dramatically speaking, perhaps," the third conspirator put in.
  "All right on the stage, don't you know, but not here. If we are discovered
  we are saved. Driver, where are we?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't ask me, gents all," the chauffeur said with absolute
  detachment. "I dunno. Somewhere in the neighbourhood of Regent's Park, though
  I ain't bettin' on it. 'Ackney coach,' 'ansom and taxicab man and boy for
  thirty year, and I never saw such a fog afore."</p>

  <p>He spoke the truth&mdash;nobody had. Never had there been such a fog since
  London began. Four mild January days without a breath of wind had been
  followed by one of the most disastrous fires the Thames-side had ever known.
  Thousands of barrels of petroleum had lifted their dense pall of smoke into
  the heavy clouds, and now the falling fog had drifted the heavy, suffocating
  mass over the metropolis like some funeral pall. Like the plague of Egypt,
  the darkness could be felt.</p>

  <p>Now, whatever atmospheric disaster the Fates have in store, the business
  of London must go on. Shops and offices must be attended to, and at all
  hazards the City of London must be achieved. The three conspirators had
  reached their offices some way, they had managed to get off those letters,
  and, perhaps for the first time in their lives, had no anathema for the
  telephone. For the rest, they shared a flat on the north side of Regent's
  Park, and, with the help of the gods, had all and sundry found their way back
  to dinner. You cannot easily discourage a stockbroker.</p>

  <p>They should have been contented as they were; they had been wrong to
  attempt so heavy an overdraft on the bank of fate. They should have sent down
  to the floor below and asked Leckie&mdash;also safe back from the
  city&mdash;and been happy with an evening at bridge.</p>

  <p>But they were young and ardent and flushed with success, and the black
  throat of the fog had no terrors for them. At any cost they were going to
  Lady Shoreham's fancy dress ball. There was not much more than a mile to go,
  their dresses were ready, and they really fancied themselves as three more or
  less picturesque anarchist conspirators. The dresses had a touch of the
  Mephistophelean, with vivid red slashed here and there; they wore black wigs,
  and their faces were masked. Also, they were three exceedingly well-set-up
  young men, with all the matchless audacity which is so necessary for success
  in the air of Copthall Avenue. They dreamt of the day when the big coup would
  come off, of the hour of the exclusive information when the big men would
  shiver and wonder what the trio would do next.</p>

  <p>The inspiration had yet to come.</p>

  <p>They managed to find a taxi right enough. A sovereign if he got them to
  Shoreham House within the hour, which offer in times of lesser stress would
  have been generous. The driver was inclined to be pessimistic, but he would
  do his best. Moreover, he had taken nothing all day. He fumbled his way along
  at a snail's pace, his heart in his mouth all the time. By the intervention
  of Providence he ran over nobody, he collided with no light standards,
  but&mdash;in ten minutes he was hopelessly lost, and appealed imploringly to
  all and collectively who passed to tell him where he was. The conundrum was a
  popular one that night, but, alas! the chosen who could answer it were
  few.</p>

  <p>From out of the denseness of the fog came strange sounds. There were
  little cries of alarm, bleats of apology, the tinkle of metal on metal, and
  once the crash of broken glass. The first conspirator, who rejoiced in the
  name of Dick Willoughby, put his head out of the window.</p>

  <p>"This is very interesting," he said. "Do you remember the ingenious excuse
  made by the city clerk for not getting to business during one foggy spell? He
  sent a telegram, you know: 'Sorry cannot reach offices to-day, as I have not
  yet got home yesterday!' Not bad, eh?"</p>

  <p>Nobody laughed. The other conspirators, Bond and Machen, were getting
  anxious. It was just past 10, and apparently they were farther from their
  destination than ever. It was gradually being borne in on them that there was
  going to be no destination&mdash;if they escaped spending the night in a cab
  they would be lucky.</p>

  <p>"I wish I was well out of this," Bond muttered.</p>

  <p>A moment later and he nearly had his way. Out of the fog, barely a yard
  away, loomed another taxi; the driver pulled sharply to the left up a steep,
  grassy bank. What the grassy bank was doing there, apparently in the middle
  of the road, did not come for a moment within the area of speculation. For
  the fraction of a second, or so it seemed, the tension was great. Then the
  taxis cleared; there was an outline of white posts and rails, and the cab
  came to a standstill, apparently in a field.</p>

  <p>"Now, where the dickens are we?" Willoughby asked.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere out in Surrey, governor," the chauffeur growled, "unless some
  'umorist 'as gone and shoved a tennis lawn down 'ere. Anyway, we're on grass
  inside somebody's gate. No doubt there's a 'ouse a bit farther on if one
  could only see it. Still, I'm in your 'ands."</p>

  <p>Willoughby's mind was made up. In the vernacular of his clan, he was fed
  up with the whole thing. Besides, it was just possible that he stood on the
  edge of adventure, just a chance that destiny would waft a little excitement
  to them.</p>

  <p>"Turn out, boys," he commanded. "We are going to throw ourselves on the
  mercy of the court. In other words, we are going to find the house and ask
  shelter for the night. Driver, here is your sovereign. If you like to look
  for another fare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not me, sir," the chauffeur said philosophically. "I am safe 'ere, and
  'ere I stay. Inside the keb with me bit of supper an' packet of fags. Don't
  you worry about me."</p>

  <p>They promised faithfully that they wouldn't, and went their way.
  Apparently the grounds about the house were fairly extensive, for the
  adventurers passed another tennis lawn before they reached what looked like a
  beacon gleam against the thickness of the fog. The trio were actually inside
  the porch before they realised the fact that the front door was hospitably
  open.</p>

  <p>"Let's enter the house first and ring the bell afterwards," Machen
  suggested.</p>

  <p>The suggestion was sufficiently unconventional to suggest itself to the
  others. They passed from the darkness and desolation of the gloom into a
  large square hall brilliantly lighted, warm and inviting. Never had a refined
  and luxurious English home looked so alluring before. A great wood fire
  crackled on the open hearth, there were trophies of the chase on the polished
  floor, some remarkably good pictures hung on the panelled walls. High up were
  stags' heads and racks of guns and a 'varsity oar, with a dark blue blade and
  Magdalen College arms mounted on a shield. The whole atmosphere was inviting
  and cosy to the last degree.</p>

  <p>"Well, thank Heaven we've struck the trail of a sportsman," Bond
  exclaimed. "Let's hope that the proud possessor of all this splendour was in
  the Oxford boat with you, Willoughby. Golf clubs, too. Any odds the chap is a
  plus player. Ring the bell, Machen."</p>

  <p>Machen complied vigorously. The ripple of it could be heard afar off. And
  no response came to the second and third summons. Willoughby laughed.</p>

  <p>"An adventure, by George!" he cried. "Money on it, we're alone in the
  house. All the household has gone and lost itself in the fog. In my mind's
  eye I can picture the catastrophe. The hero failed to materialise for dinner.
  Being a fine sportsman, probably he is as handsome as a Greek god. He has a
  young and beautiful wife who is devoted to him. She went to look for him and
  lost herself. Then the butler went to look for her; and the cook followed the
  butler; and so on. Regular house that Jack built game."</p>

  <p>"The fact remains that we are alone in the house," Bond said thoughtfully.
  "I refuse to connect tragedy with a place like this. Let's explore.
  Dining-room first. If they've left us some supper the measure of my gratitude
  will know no bounds. To be candid, I'm confoundedly hungry."</p>

  <p>There were no less than five rooms leading from the hall. A blaze of light
  glittered everywhere, and everywhere was the same pleasing suggestion of
  comfort and luxury. The big dining-room was oak panelled throughout; there
  were racing and sporting cups on the old buffet, a fine army of gold-topped
  bottles, and on the table, with covers laid for half a dozen guests, a cold
  supper that suggested the Savoy or the Ritz at their best. Bond's mouth
  watered as he looked at it.</p>

  <p>"Now, this is touching," he said. "This is really thoughtful. It is far
  more than I had expected. In the circumstances, they will hardly expect us to
  wait. Hallo."</p>

  <p>The speaker wheeled suddenly round as there came to his ear a choking
  sound from the region of the doorway. He was just in time to grab a
  scared-faced page boy by the shoulder. Evidently the youth was fully under
  the impression that his last hour was come.</p>

  <p>"What does all this mean?" Bond demanded. "Where are the servants, and
  you&mdash;er&mdash;your employer?"</p>

  <p>"Master and missis couldn't get back," the stricken page gasped. "Got
  caught in the fog this side of Croydon. They sent a telegram; and if anybody
  turned up to supper the butler was to explain. They were to have supper first
  and go to Lady Shoreham's after."</p>

  <p>"Then where's the butler and all the rest of them?"</p>

  <p>"Next door, sir. The people are away, and the servants are giving a party.
  It's all right, sir&mdash;indeed, it is. You see, we expected nobody in this
  fog, and&mdash;and I went to see a friend on the other side. Left me in
  charge, they did. And if anybody turned up I was to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My boy," Willoughby said kindly, "have no fear. It's a festive time, when
  one forgives&mdash;well, anything. Only show me the telegram, not necessarily
  for publication, but as a&mdash;very good. Mr. Everest will understand. We
  are his guests. And I am quite sure that he would not like us to wait. We are
  not going to disturb the servants; we are going to let them enjoy themselves.
  The lot of the average domestic is hard, and it is the duty of the rich, like
  ourselves, to treat them with every consideration. Let them come back when
  they like. We will wait upon ourselves. Put the cigars and cigarettes handy
  on the table, and go your way. That will do, George."</p>

  <p>The page vanished. He was young; he came evidently from the country; his
  scruples were satisfied. And it would probably be ages before the servants
  returned.</p>

  <p>"How did you get at the name of our esteemed host?" Machen asked.</p>

  <p>"Idiot!" Willoughby explained. "I guessed that the name would be on the
  telegram. That was why I demanded to see the missive. Everest was in the boat
  the year after I came down. Gordon Everest, he is, and a year ago he married
  Miss Wanstead, only daughter of the Master of the Riding Hunt. Any amount of
  money, and a real good chap to boot. He'll laugh like anything when he hears
  of this little adventure of ours. Come and sup.; let us sample the flowing
  bowl. And may this not be the end of our night's adventures. We deserve
  something to make up for our disappointment. Bond, oblige me by opening one
  of those bottles. Here's to the gods of happy chance. May they never desert
  us in the the hour of adversity."</p>

  <p>He helped himself generously to Perigord pie&mdash;it would have been bad
  taste, he explained, not to do due justice to Gordon Everest's hospitality.
  They ate gaily enough, despite the fact that they wore their masks, for
  Willoughby had insisted on that. He liked to be guarded against possible
  surprises, and at any moment the garrison was liable to invasion. And
  Willoughby liked to be ready. A man who means some day to be a Napoleon of
  the Stock Exchange must be like that.</p>

  <p>"To our host and hostess," Bond cried, emptying his champagne glass and
  reaching for a cigarette. "May they live long and prosper. Upon my word, I am
  sorry they are not here. I am sorry for some of the other would-be roysterers
  at present wading about in this fog. How many are there of them at the
  present moment, like little Tommy Tucker, singing for their supper? Really,
  we ought to consider ourselves fortunate, brethren. We ought to stand by the
  gate and proffer hospitality to the passers-by. What say?"</p>

  <p>Willoughby and Bond regarded the suggestion as an excellent one. All the
  same, Willoughby did not seem to be quite easy in his mind. He had a fancy
  for exploring the servants' quarters. The matter that troubled him he did not
  disclose to the others. He came back presently more cheerful&mdash;he was
  more cheerful still after a telephone call and a whispered conversation with
  some body at the other end of the line.</p>

  <p>"Now I feel better," he proclaimed.</p>

  <p>"You fellows leave too much to chance. The man armed is he who&mdash;who
  gets his blow in first. Ah! here they are. Now for it!"</p>

  <p>A pink and white individual, clothed in a certain dignity and evening
  dress of sorts, came with none too much ceremony into the room. He was
  followed by a female of uncertain age, and anything but uncertain obesity, in
  black satin and many gold brooches. It needed no amazing foresight to
  distinguish these as the butler and cook to the establishment.</p>

  <p>"So you've condescended to come back at last, Odgers," Willoughby said
  coolly. "Unless I am mistaken, that is Mrs. Marus behind you. You don't
  recognise me, Odgers?"</p>

  <p>The butler frankly confessed himself at a disadvantage. The pink
  indignation had faded from his cheeks. Mrs. Marus's hysterical desire for the
  police was no longer uppermost in her mind. Here were no audacious burglars,
  taking advantage of the fog. And Odgers had passed all his prosaic life in
  good houses, and flattered himself that he recognised a gentleman when he saw
  one.</p>

  <p>"We will remain anonymous, Odgers," Willoughby went on calmly. "Were I to
  remove my mask, you would know me&mdash;I mean all of us&mdash;at once. You
  see, we are more fortunate than Mr. Everest and your mistress&mdash;we have
  got here; and here we propose to stay. If your master manages to struggle
  home before daylight, or what passes for daylight, we will excuse them. We
  esteem ourselves fortunate in obtaining shelter and supper. You had better
  all go to bed, Odgers. No, I will answer the telephone. In all probability
  that is Mr. Everest calling."</p>

  <p>Willoughby advanced calmly into the hall and took down the receiver. For a
  moment he seemed to listen to some message of grave import.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," he said. "What? Absolutely. What! Oh, yes, we got here all
  right. But it was pure blind luck, I assure you. Eh? Go any farther? Not
  much. It's the unkindest fog London has ever seen. Where? Between Croydon and
  Clapham? A decent place? Well, you're lucky, old boy. You might still be
  prowling about the roads in the car. Yes, we are all three of us here. I
  fancy Odgers took us for burglars at first. We had a fancy to sup in our
  masks. Why, Ethel? Oh she's all right. Tell Odgers what? Oh, yes; certainly.
  Pyjamas in the back of the linen cupboard? Oh, for us. Thanks, old chap. So
  long."</p>

  <p>Odgers looked relieved. Nothing had been said as to his escapade.</p>

  <p>"You need not be alarmed as to your master and mistress," Willoughby said,
  as he hung up the receiver. "They have reached a place of safety. And I did
  not say anything about the supper party of yours, Odgers. Two of us will
  sleep in your master's room and one in the dressing-room. The
  pyjamas&mdash;but you heard what Mr. Everest said. You had better retire,
  Odgers, and leave the house to us."</p>

  <p>Odgers raised no objection. On the whole, he was disposed to regard
  himself as well out of it.</p>

  <p>"Well, you are a wonder!" Bond said admiringly. "I've been dreading the
  return of the vassals of the house. How on earth did you manage it,
  Willoughby!"</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, it's nothing," Willoughby said modestly. "I wanted to get
  into the kitchen, because I felt quite sure that I should find the insurance
  cards there. They were in a dresser drawer&mdash;John Odgers, and Mary Marus,
  widow, and all the rest of them. Now, obviously, Odgers was the
  butler&mdash;with a name like that he couldn't be anything else. And Mary
  Marus must be the cook. Hence the easy familiarity with which I had their
  names on the tip of my tongue."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear chap, Everest himself on the 'phone?" Machen protested.</p>

  <p>"There was no Everest on the 'phone. I faked that call. There is an
  extension in the dining-room, and I rang up by lifting the extension
  receiver. I was afraid you would see me do it. My conversation with my good
  friend Gordon Everest was purely imaginary. I had to make the genial Odgers
  feel quite at his ease, and I flatter myself that I did so. We're absolutely
  safe now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll get on all right," Bond said admiringly. "But you always were
  a genius for finding the most ingenious way out of a scrape. Pity there are
  not four of us here to make up a table at bridge."</p>

  <p>"Let's go out and find somebody," Machen suggested. "All we need is two or
  three balls of string, with an end tied to the front door, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Willoughby held up a hand as a mysterious tapping was heard on the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Here's your fourth at bridge," he said, "knocking to come in. Hope he
  plays 'auction.' Well?"</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, gents." A hoarse voice broke the silence as the window was
  opened. "I'm your driver. Been sittin' in my keb for the last hour or more
  'alf asleep. I thought I 'eard somebody callin' and I got up. A gent was
  standin' by the gate in the fog. Dismissed 'is keb, 'e 'ad; came an' said as
  the man was a fool. And now 'e&mdash;well, 'e don't know where 'e are."</p>

  <p>"This is the hand of Providence," Willoughby said solemnly. "What's he
  like, driver?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, as far as I can make out, 'e's rather old and thin, and in
  some kind of fancy dress. 'E&mdash;;"</p>

  <p>A shout of laughter drowned the rest of the sentence.</p>

  <p>"On his way to Lady Shoreham's dance for a dollar!" Bond shouted. "Well,
  he's come to the right place. The people who live in this house are friends
  of ours, cabby. We owe you something for bringing us here, if only by
  accident. Show the gentleman in."</p>

  <p>The wayfarer came, tall and thin and extra cadaverous by reason of his
  close-fitting tights and black jerkin. He looked exceedingly bad-tempered;
  his hard mouth was set firm and savagely.</p>

  <p>"This is a nice thing!" he exclaimed. "A nice thing to happen in a city
  like London! I presume you people have been kept from Lady Shoreham's dance
  by the fog. I you happen to know me&mdash;;"</p>

  <p>An exclamation was on Bond's lips, but Willoughby laid a hand with a grip
  to it on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"We have none of us the pleasure, Sir," he said. "This, sir, is my house.
  I am Lord Bollinger, at your service. This is Colonel Kinlock, and here is my
  cousin, the Honourable John Driver."</p>

  <p>Machen chocked slightly, but Willoughby was perfectly grave.</p>

  <p>"We were also prevented from going to the dance," he went on, "so we
  supped here, and kept our masks on, trying to snatch a gaiety we do not feel.
  You said your name was&mdash;;"</p>

  <p>"Smith," the stranger gabbled. "John Smith. Really, you are very kind, and
  supper would be acceptable. I presume you have such a thing in the house as a
  telephone. I have to send a message to my broker. I expected to meet him at
  the dance, but he would hardly turn out in this weather. I will 'phone him to
  his own house, as I have to get to Liverpool, on my way to America to-morrow.
  Business in a mild way, you understand."</p>

  <p>Willoughby led the way to the telephone, and appeared to close the door
  behind him. All the same, he stood so that he could hear every word that
  passed. So could the other two, who had suddenly grown grave and silent The
  air of the Stock Exchange on them now.</p>

  <p>"What's that, what's that!" came the raucous voice in the hall. "Not come
  home? What! Prefer to stay in the City, as the fog is so thick! Very full all
  day to-morrow. Quite right. Ring off, please. .. Hallo! Is that the Exchange?
  Give me 01707 City. .. That you, Starley? You know whose speaking! Yes, it's
  me, 'Wigs on the green.' Thought I'd give you the password. I'm going to
  Liverpool and New York. Sell W's. Sell and sell as long as you have anybody
  to buy. That'll do. Ring off."</p>

  <p>"Nice old beauty, isn't he!" Bond whispered. "Let's murder him and bury
  him in the cellar. He'd have a fit if he only knew who we really are. Can't
  we manage to&mdash;;"</p>

  <p>"We can," Willoughby said grimly. "We are going to make a jolly good thing
  out of this. We are acting on exclusive information. Old Gregory Hicks, who
  likes to call himself John Smith for the moment, has opened a great bear raid
  on W's which mean to the initiated Western Atlantic Rails. The old fox is off
  tomorrow to manipulate the stock across the water. He little thinks that he
  has delivered himself into the hands of three of the astutest intellects in
  Throgmorton Street, where&mdash;Soft! Here he comes."</p>

  <p>Mr. John Smith, alias Gregory Hicks, one of the most grasping and
  unscrupulous millionaires who ever commanded respect in the City, came back
  looking on better terms with himself. He even went so far as to crack a joke
  or two, for he was not devoid of a sense of humour. He did not repudiate the
  Perigord pie, neither did he refuse the wine when it was red. But he refused
  to play bridge, and was glad enough an hour later to find himself in the
  dressing-room and a spare pair of pyjamas. There were baize doors on the
  landings, and Willoughby noted the fact with gratitude as he came down the
  stairs and reached for the 'phone.</p>

  <p>"You must get him," he said. "Ring and ring, till you do. Give me your
  name and address and I'll send you a tenner for your trouble. What? You don't
  call that bribery. .. Oh, thanks, that you, Pallart? It's Willoughby. And
  it's Willoughby full of inside information. Now, listen carefully. Quite sure
  you've got all that? Now start out early to-morrow morning and sell till
  you're blind and blue in the face. Work the telephone or the cable all over
  England and the Continent."</p>

  <p>"I'm in it, and Bond and Machen, and we're good for all we're got between
  us, and that's about 30,000. It would be downright flying in the face of
  Providence to miss a chance like this. Do we mind if you come in? Why, of
  course not. The more the merrier. Only do it boldly. So long."</p>

  <p>In the dining-room Machen promptly opened a bottle of champagne. The three
  of them removed their masks, their faces were glad with smiles.</p>

  <p>"Here's to Dame Fortune, who never, never deserts the bold," he said.
  "Willoughby, founder of our fortune, I look towards you. They say that the
  hour always produces the man&mdash;and it has. One drink and then we'll be
  off. We must not tempt Fortune too far. I dare say our cabby wouldn't
  mind&mdash;;"</p>

  <p>"The fog is lifting," Machen said from the window.</p>

  <p>Without another word they crept silently from the room, the richer for a
  fine evening's adventure on the wings of chance, and the richer also by the
  sum of something that was to prove over a hundred and fifty thousand
  pounds.</p><br>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 21 Apr
  1923</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MR. LEON BEN ISRAEL had been waiting in his office in Silver
  Square, Hatton Gardens, for Inspector Rhys, of Scotland Yard, with an
  impatience that almost amounted to frenzy.</p>

  <p>"There, one thing at a time," the Inspector said. "Now, let me see if I've
  got the facts right. The night before last, about 5 o'clock, when you were
  closing down for the day, two strangers called upon you. At that moment, your
  three assistants were upstairs, and you were alone in this room, where we are
  talking now. I think your safe was open."</p>

  <p>"That is quite right," Ben Israel said. "My safe usually is open about 5
  o'clock. You see, I always lock it myself, and set the combination before I
  leave."</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," Rhys replied. "Mind you, that's a habit of yours
  that any smart thief could find out."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose it is," Ben Israel reflected. "Well, I was quite alone
  when they came in, and, as they appeared to be gentleman, I had no
  suspicious. I was just about to secure the safe when they fell upon me
  suddenly and what you call knocked me out. But they were not quite quick
  enough, because I got my hands on one man's face, and I must have twisted his
  nose pretty well off. After that, I remember no more till I found two of my
  clerks bending over me and, as soon as I was equal to it, we went through the
  safe. Now, strange, to say, Inspector, there was nothing missing with the
  exception of a pearl which I had in a tiny wooden box. Good Lord, they might
  have taken fifty thousand pounds worth of stuff, but they didn't&mdash;only
  the pearl."</p>

  <p>"Was it a very valuable stone?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Ben Israel groaned. "One of the finest in the world. It was
  pledged with me for a comparatively small sum, a week or two ago, and I took
  it without question. You will perhaps remember, Inspector, that a little time
  back Princess Zenia of Monarcho lost a pearl necklace in the Cranleigh
  Restaurant where she was dining. I don't mean to say that she actually lost
  it, because, as a matter of fact, the string, if I may so call it, gave way,
  and the pearls were scattered all over the floor. They were all picked up,
  with the exception of one, but that one was the finest of the lot, and was at
  the base of the necklace. Of course, somebody stole it. But when that pearl
  was pledged with me, I had no thought of the Princess. It was only
  afterwards, when I heard the details, that I came to the conclusion that I
  had the missing pearl in my safe. You may say that I ought to have given it
  up, indeed, I meant to, but not at a loss to myself, if I could help it, and
  that's about all there is to it, Inspector. I want you to find, for me, the
  men who robbed me, and, when you have done that. I shall be quite
  content."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I expect you would," the Inspector said drily. "You don't seem to be
  aware of the fact that a reward of two thousand pounds is offered for the
  missing pearl, and it's long odds that you didn't advance that much of
  it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ben Israel groaned dismally.</p>

  <p>"I didn't," he confessed. "So if you can find those men and get the pearl
  back. I shall be fortunate."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no doubt, no doubt," Rhys said. "But you can't arrest prisoners
  without some sort of clue. Now, tell me, did those chaps leave anything
  behind them?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not quite sure as to that," Ben Israel said. "I certainly found
  something that struck me as rather curious, but how it came into my office, I
  can't tell."</p>

  <p>With that, the eminent jeweller took a small object, wrapped in a piece of
  tissue paper, from a drawer in his desk. It had the appearance of a glass
  marble, opaque for the most part, with a tiny medallion in the centre of
  green enamel, slightly flecked with blue. Rhys examined it with keen
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Where did you find this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, close to the safe. I don't know if, but it looks very much to me like
  an artificial eye."</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what it is," Rhys announced. "And a very fine piece of
  work, too. I am not going to say that one of those men dropped it during the
  attack upon you, but it looks very much as if something of the sort had
  happened. If you don't mind, I'll take this with me, because it might prove a
  valuable clue. Now, tell me, who pawned that pearl with you?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that I don't know," Ben Israel said mournfully. "He had every
  appearance of being a gentleman, tall and well-dressed, with a neat, black
  moustache, and a scar over one eye. That's all I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's not bad for a start," the Inspector said. "Don't make any
  sort of statement, and don't allow those reporter fellows to get anything out
  of you. It's just possible that, in a day or two, I shall have something
  important to tell you."</p>

  <p>With that, Inspector Rhys made his way thoughtfully westward and came, at
  length, to a house, not far from the Admiralty Arch, where he stopped, and
  giving his name, was admitted presently into the presence of a little man in
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Dr. Johnson," he said. "I come to you for a bit of advice.
  I know that you are a specialist as far as artificial aids are concerned, and
  that you have done a good deal during the war to supply our unfortunate men
  with the necessary equipment. Artificial eyes, for instance."</p>

  <p>"That's quite in my line," the little man said.</p>

  <p>"So I am told. Now, there were a good many men in the Army of doubtful
  antecedents who are now at liberty. Some of these, of course, must have lost
  limbs or eyes, and a good many of them, no doubt, came to you for advice.
  Now, will you kindly look at this."</p>

  <p>With that, Rhys took the eye from his pocket, and handed it across to the
  little Professor. The latter examined it with the eye of an expert before he
  passed it back again.</p>

  <p>"A very fine piece of work," he said. "There's only one man in London who
  could have turned out an eye like that. You see how cleverly those little
  flecks of blue are mingled with the grey of the iris. It must have been
  faithfully copied from the owner's remaining eye. You would like to know who
  made it?"</p>

  <p>"I came for no other purpose," Rhys said. "If you can tell me, you are
  furthering the interests of justice."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, in that case, I have no further scruples. The man who made that
  eye is called Elias, and he works alone in a little shop in Mead-street, off
  the Tottenham Court Road. It is the third house on the left hand
  side&mdash;you can't mistake it, and perhaps you had better mention my
  name."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, and the inspector was on his way to the street in
  question. He found an old-fashioned shop, very small and stuffy, as if it had
  been overlooked in the general improvements and forgotten. As Rhys stepped
  inside, he noticed at a bench in the back of the shop a small, dried-up
  looking individual working under a powerful light with a shade over his eyes.
  He seemed to be doing something with a delicate instrument, and was so
  engrossed that Rhys had to speak twice before the old man looked up and
  noticed his presence.</p>

  <p>"I am Inspector Rhys, of Scotland Yard," the officer said. "And I have
  been sent to you by Dr. Johnson, who tells me that you can give me certain
  information. He says you are the best artificial eye maker in London, and
  that all the fine work for our wounded soldiers passed through your hands.
  Now, without any further argument, did you happen to make this?"</p>

  <p>The old man's eyes lighted up as he saw the little object that Rhys laid
  on the desk before him.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," he said. "I made that. That is my workmanship, sure, and one
  of my biggest triumphs, if I may say so. It is no easy matter to get those
  little points of colouring."</p>

  <p>"Then you know, who this was made for?"</p>

  <p>"Most assuredly I do. The man came to me with an order from a Government
  Department, and I not only made that eye, but I did all the enamel colour
  work before it was fired. All the work was done here, in this room, day by
  day, with the patient sitting on that chair yonder."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you can tell me his name?"</p>

  <p>Elias reached down a slender-looking volume from a shelf over his desk,
  and proceeded to turn over the leaves.</p>

  <p>"Yes, here it is," he said presently. "Though really there was no occasion
  to look. The man that eye was made for is called Calgar, and he lost his own
  eye not long before the war finished. He used to be a lieutenant, but got
  into trouble and was dismissed from the service. Rather a bad lot, I should
  say. It's a funny thing, but he came to me, only two days ago, for a fresh
  eye. He said he had lost the one I made for him, and that was evidently the
  truth, because that bit of glass you brought me was the original eye that I
  made. Now I am making another one for him. Here it is, Inspector. For some
  reason or another he wanted the back of it hollowed out. He said the original
  eye was a bit heavy, so you see, I am making a hollow eye, and if he doesn't
  find that comfortable, I suggest that he should fill it with some sort of
  hard wax. It's only a fad, of course."</p>

  <p>Rhys, however, was not quite so sure of that, but he made no comment, and
  asked no questions, except as to where the man Calgar was to he found. He
  gave a hint to the effect that there was something serious behind this
  investigation, and warned Elias that he might find himself in trouble if he
  mentioned the fact that the Inspector had been to see him. All he wanted now,
  was the address to where the new eye was to be sent, and that Elias should
  communicate with him on the telephone directly the orb in question was in the
  post.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you where he lives," Elias said. "He is at a little flat in
  Carlisle Gardens with a gentleman called Massinger. I believe he is some sort
  of relation."</p>

  <p>Rhys said nothing, but there was a sort of twinkle in his eye as he heard
  the name of Massinger. With a few final words of warning to the ancient
  artist in artificial eyes, he made his way back to Scotland Yard and at once
  called in one of his assistants.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Walton," he said. "I've got that Silver Square safe robbery in
  hand. I may say I have got it so far in hand as to be practicably sure who
  the men are who made that assault upon Leon Ben Israel. Also I know why they
  did it. But, before I go any further, I must have a little more information.
  I have discovered that in a flat in Carlisle Gardens dwells a certain
  individual called Massinger. Ever heard of him? It's in your line, you know,
  and I want you to find out."</p>

  <p>"Massinger, Massinger," Walton mused. "Oh, if it's the Massinger I know,
  then that's just his game. I had him in hand twice previous to 1914, and he
  slipped out of rather a nasty business because he volunteered for service.
  Till quite lately I haven't heard of him. But I know he was demobilised two
  or three months ago, and I gather, from what you say, sir, that he is up to
  his old tricks again."</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure of it," Rhys said. "Well, there you are, Walton. I want
  you to find out all that this chap has been doing lately, and, if you can,
  whether he was dining at the Cranleigh Restaurant the night that the Princess
  Zenia of Monarcho was there and lost a pearl from her famous necklace. Wait a
  minute, that's not quite all. I am told that Massinger has a friend staying
  with him&mdash;a man called Calgar who is blind in one eye. He had, or has,
  an artificial one. Now, off you go, and get all this information for me as
  soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Walton drifted into the office quite late the same evening with a fair
  budget of news for his chief. Massinger was living in a Carlisle Gardens
  flat, apparently in a condition of considerable prosperity. This was all the
  more strange, because, a little while back, he had been compelled to accept
  the hospitality of one of the Rowton Houses. Now he had the flat furnished,
  and was sharing it with a man called Calgar. Calgar had not been out the last
  day or two, in consequence of a slight accident, to all of which Rhys
  listened with placid satisfaction. It was quite plain to him that he was on
  the right track now, and equally clear that Calgar was more or less in hiding
  until the artificial eye that Elias was making for him could be
  delivered.</p>

  <p>But there was a good deal to be done yet. In ordinary circumstances it
  would have been an easy matter to arrest Massinger and Calgar, and confront
  them with Ben Israel, but then the eminent jeweller had told the Inspector
  that his office was dimly lighted at the time of the assault, and that he was
  not prepared to identify his assailants. Therefore, it would be necessary to
  wait until he was in a position to strike a vital blow. And there was some
  hurry, too, because, on the following morning, Walton turned up with a fresh
  piece of information to the effect that Massinger and Calgar were giving up
  the flat in a day or two, and that already they had secured their passage to
  America.</p>

  <p>This was somewhat disturbing. It pointed to the fact that those two shady
  individuals were leaving their country for a long term, and that, beyond the
  shadow of a doubt, they were taking the big pearl with them. On the other
  side of the water they would be able to get a good price for it, and no
  impertinent questions asked, provided they could smuggle it across, which
  would be no easy matter, considering the cleverness of the Customs House
  officials. That was, unless they could devise some ingenious hiding place for
  the pearl, which, no doubt, they had done. And Rhys smiled to himself as he
  recalled the various bits of information that he had gathered during the last
  few days. He began to see, quite plainly, where the pearl would be hidden,
  and before he slept that night he had worked out the drama to the last
  detail. All he had to do now, was to wait until the telephone message from
  Elias arrived, and that came all in good time.</p>

  <p>It reached him the following afternoon, about four o'clock. The message
  ran to the effect that the new eye had been posted that morning, shortly
  after ten, and that it would probably reach Calgar somewhere near four
  o'clock the same afternoon. Almost on the top of this information came a
  further piece of news from Walton to the effect that Massinger and Calgar had
  packed up their belongings and were turning the flat over to the agents
  before noon the next day. They had ordered something rather special in the
  way of a dinner from an adjacent restaurant, which meal they intended to
  partake of in the seclusion of the flat.</p>

  <p>It was about half-past ten before Rhys set out for Carlisle Gardens, and a
  little later he was shot up to the fifth floor in the lift. He rang the bell
  at No. 17, and was not at all surprised when Massinger himself came to the
  door. Evidently there were no servant left, or this would not have happened.
  Nor was Rhys long in realising that he had found the man he wanted. He saw a
  tall, slim, well-set-up individual with a slight, black moustache and a scar
  over his left eye. Massinger looked superciliously at his visitor and
  demanded to know what he wanted. Very dexterously Rhys inserted his foot
  inside the door and pushed his way into the hall.</p>

  <p>"What the devil does this mean?" Massinger demanded.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better take it quietly," Rhys said. "There is my card,
  from which you will see that I am representing Scotland Yard. Moreover, my
  business is not entirely with you&mdash;I also want to see your friend,
  Calgar."</p>

  <p>"Calgar? Calgar?" Massinger bluffed. "Really, I don't know what you are
  talking about."</p>

  <p>"It really isn't the slightest use," Rhys said, almost pityingly. "The man
  I speak of is in the dining-room. The Preston Restaurant people sent in a
  dinner for two to-night. You had better take it quietly, because, you see, I
  have got three of my men downstairs waiting if there's any trouble. I want
  you and Calgar on a charge of stealing a pearl from the Cranleigh restaurant
  on the night of the third instant, and also for fraudulently pawning the same
  with Mr. Leon Ben Israel, of Golden Square. Also, on a charge of robbing that
  gentleman with violence. Let me see, isn't that the dining-room door? Yes, I
  thought so. Now, will you be good enough to precede me, and, if you are
  foolish enough to try any violence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's not in my line," Massinger said insolently. "Of course, I know
  all about that lost pearl from the papers, and if you can find it here, you
  are welcome to keep it, as far as I am concerned. Come along and get it
  over."</p>

  <p>In the dining-room Calgar was seated, smoking a cigarette and sipping his
  liqueur. Rhys noted with intense satisfaction that Massinger's accomplice was
  wearing his new eye. He introduced himself to that individual, and stated his
  business as crisply as he had done to Massinger.</p>

  <p>"Now then," he said, "don't let's waste any further time. I know
  everything. I even know what a part Mr. Elias, of the Tottenham Court road,
  has played in this clever business. Calgar, would you be good enough to
  remove that new artificial eye of yours, or shall I call up my men and have
  it removed by force?"</p>

  <p>There was no fight in either of the criminals as this remark fell from
  Rhys's lips. They stared at one another in consternation and then after a
  little prodding, Calgar, slowly and reluctantly, removed his false eye. As
  Rhys had expected, the hollow in the back had been filled with some hard
  waxen compound, which gave a little as Rhys crushed the thin, fine glass
  between his thumb and forefinger. As he did so, the missing pearl rolled out
  on the table and Rhys coolly dropped it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Very neat, gentlemen," he said. "Very neat. And now perhaps you will put
  on your hats and come along with me."</p><br>

     name="story8">8.&mdash;EARLY CLOSING DAY</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 5 Apr
  1924</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE MAN in the white waistcoat and undeniable spats was
  pleased to approve of the Major, and in this his wife was graciously pleased
  to agree. As a rule the Vellacotts were particular with regard to their
  friendships, as benefitted second generation people, with offspring at
  Winchester and Magdalen College, Oxford, but the Major had a way with him
  that few people could resist. And the Majestic Hotel at Sandbourne did not
  take everybody in.</p>

  <p>"I like this place very much," the Major remarked to Vellacott after
  dinner on the Saturday night, they having had a day on the links together.
  "Like you, I have dropped into the habit of running down here for the
  week-end: The golf is none too good, as you know, but it is convenient to
  town, and we can't all run to Rolls-Royce cars."</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant bit of chaff and touched Vellacott on the soft spot,
  because he was proud of his Rolls-Royce car in which he always made his
  weekend journeys to Sandbourne. In the city he was a dealer in bullion and
  specie, to say nothing of occasional excursions in the realms of pawnbroking,
  which latter transactions were restricted severely to advances upon family
  jewels, collections of historic plate, and the like. A little later he found
  himself talking freely and eloquently on the subject of city business, to one
  who appeared to be as interested and intelligent listener.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the Major, pulling at his cigar. "Yes. Do you know, Vellacott,
  I was precious near going into the city myself once. I wish I had now.
  Certain anxieties, of course, but no adventures, and no
  risks&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"Ah, there you are wrong," Vellacott said eagerly, "Why, my dear fellow,
  handling valuables as we do, we've got to be on the alert the whole time.
  Only last year we were very nearly done out of twenty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't thought of that," the Major said. "I suppose your strong room is
  like a bank. All sorts of patent locks, and ingenious devices, and all that
  sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Vellacott winked across his whisky and soda.</p>

  <p>"You never can tell," he said. "My strong room is especially built in the
  basement, and goes right under the pavement, flush with the curb. Moreover,
  on top is a round sheet of glass just like a coal chute, about eight inches
  thick, and the police have been told that the electric light is burning in
  the strong room every night, and if the light goes out, they will know there
  is something wrong. But still, there are times&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite so, quite so," the Major said. "It's rather funny that you
  should introduce this subject, because I am rather interested in a device
  suggested to me by a young friend of mine for getting even with the sort of
  gentry you speak of. You see, I was an engineer myself, and I am rather a dab
  at mechanics. If I had the capital, I should try and develop it."</p>

  <p>At the mention of the magic words "capital," and "development," Vellacott
  pricked up his ears. He was never averse to a proposition in which the risk
  was small, and the profit proportionately great. He leaned eagerly
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it," he said. "If you have got a decent thing, I can
  introduce the capital."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this," the Major said. "In a few words, it is an entirely
  new form of burgular alarm. One of those simple things that the wonder is it
  has never been thought of before. You attach it to your telephone at night,
  and by leaving the receiver off the hook, a bell rings at the other end of
  the wire if the door of the room where the telephone is, indeed, the
  slightest interruption sets the telephone going. Now, suppose, for instance,
  you had a private wire from your office to your house at Sutton&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have," Vellacott cried. "I have,"</p>

  <p>"So much the better. I suppose a good many of your city magnates have
  private wires? Well, in that case, you might be disposed to try it. I can
  carry a wire from your 'phone into the vault, and if the door of the vault is
  opened, my device will give you instant warning in your private house. I
  suppose I need not ask if you have got an extension of your telephone at home
  into your bedroom? You have? Very well, then. In that case, if anything was
  wrong, you would be instantly aroused in the middle of the night&mdash;call
  up Scotland Yard, and within a couple of minutes, the police are on the spot.
  This is rather a lucky day for me, I think. Some of these days, when you have
  half an hour to spare, I'd like to give you an experimental test. What about
  Saturday afternoon, when the office is closed?"</p>

  <p>Vellacott beamed pleasantly on his companion.</p>

  <p>"Now, do you know, that sounds real good," he said. "If only your
  invention is not too expensive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Less than five pounds," the Major interrupted. "We should open a sort of
  central office to which all you city men should subscribe, and where an extra
  wire from each big office would converge and be numbered. Now, by another
  simple device those wires would give an alarm in that central office, where a
  couple of operators would be at work all night, and those wires would be
  numbered. All the operator had to do is to call up Scotland Yard, and tell
  them that something is wrong, say, with number ten. What do you think?"</p>

  <p>"Think!" Vellacott cried with an enthusiasm rare at his time of life, "I
  think you've got a fortune there! Don't mention it to anybody else. I'll
  speak to my&mdash;er&mdash;friend in the city, and he'll find the money fast
  enough. Now, how long do you think it would be before we could try the
  thing?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," the Major said. "I might manage to get the machine
  itself ready within a week. Yes, I'm quite sure I can. But one part will take
  a little longer. Still, I can get the instrument itself inside your strong
  room. But I shall have to see it first. But isn't it rather a shame for me to
  rob you of you week-end holiday?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all, not at all," Vellacott said, "Now, shall you by any chance be
  down here next week-end?"</p>

  <p>The Major rather thought he would. He would probably turn up by the Friday
  afternoon, as usual, and thereupon, Vellacott made a proposal. They would
  dine together on Friday night, and, run up to London in the car after an
  early breakfast on the Saturday morning. If they started early enough, they
  could be in the city, inspect the strong room, and be back at the Majestic in
  time for lunch, after which they could play a well earned round of golf in
  the afternoon. To this suggestion the Major gave a cordial consent, and
  therefore, on the following Saturday morning, a little after eight o'clock,
  the two set out together in the Rolls-Royce car, and in due course arrived at
  the palatial offices in Moorgate-street.</p>

  <p>"I have said nothing to my partner," Vellacott explained. "Neither have I
  mentioned the matter to my manager. This is the sort of thing that it is not
  well to talk about until it is accomplished. Now, come along, and have a look
  at the strong room."</p>

  <p>With that, Vellacott dived down a flight of stone steps, and opened a
  massive door, which led into a room some twelve feet square. A light was
  burning in the room, and, overhead, the Major could see the disc of thick
  plate glass that Vellacott had explained to him. Round the strong room, on
  three sides, were small doors, and sliding trays faced with steel, and these,
  Vellacott had explained, contained not only masses of bullion, but some of
  the finest treasures in the world.</p>

  <p>"I suppose every tray is locked?" the Major asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," Vellacott said. "You see, if anybody could get through that
  door, they could get into the trays easily enough."</p>

  <p>The Major asked no more questions, pertinent or otherwise. He took from
  his pocket a dainty little foot rule, and a note book, which he was
  exceedingly busy with for the next few minutes. There was something so
  businesslike about him that even Vellacott was impressed. Then he looked up
  from a mass of figures, and smiled with the air of a man who is quite pleased
  with himself, though he vouchsafed no information.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later the two emerged from the vault and made their way into
  Moorgate-street, where the big car was awaiting them. Almost in front of the
  palatial premises of Vellacott and Co., a small group of workmen had
  congregated in the street. There were four of them altogether, and in their
  peaked caps was the badge of the Universal Electricity Company, the great
  corporation which supplied that part of London with its electric power. They
  had with them a closed-in truck, from the depths of which they had produced a
  sort of collapsible canvas tent, together with a mass of technical
  instruments, which the Major regarded with a favourable eye. It was evident
  that something had gone wrong with one of the cables, and that the gang of
  workmen was there to repair it. The Major stood watching them whilst waiting
  for his companion, and, presently he made a technical remark or two to the
  foreman.</p>

  <p>"I am rather glad these chaps are here," he said to Vellacott when the
  latter emerged. "They have given me an idea. I find that the main cable is
  close to the kerb, and upon my word, I think it would be possible to run a
  tunnel for my apparatus inside the channel. That would give me just what I
  want without disturbing existing arrangements. Um&mdash;yes, that's a
  rattling good idea."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all very well," Vellacott grumbled. "But these fellows are
  always pulling the streets about. Hi, foreman, I hope you are not going to be
  very long over this job."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so, sir," the foreman said, civilly enough. "I hope we
  shall finish to-night. If not, it will be some time to-morrow morning. That's
  why we came to-day, so as not to interfere with you gentlemen in business
  hours."</p>

  <p>With that Vellacott turned away, and, before long, the big car had left
  London behind it. It was a beautiful morning, and Vellacott was looking
  forward eagerly to his afternoon's golf. He had little or nothing on his
  mind, business was not pressing, and it was just possible that he might take
  Monday off as well.</p>

  <p>"I'll telephone my partner first thing in the morning," he said. "I
  suppose you are staying on for the present?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," the Major said. "As a matter of fact I was down here all
  last week. If this invention comes off, then I and a plus golfer of my
  acquaintance are buying a furnished bungalow close to Sandwich. If it does
  materialise, I shall be pleased if you will come down and join us
  occasionally."</p>

  <p>Vellacott replied emphatically that he would. They were discussing the
  question on the Monday morning before setting out for the day's golf, when a
  pert page boy in a veritable rash of buttons solemnly summoned Vellacott to
  the telephone. He came back a moment or two later, white, trembling, and
  almost incoherent, and in striking contrast to the Major, who lay back in a
  comfortable armchair enjoying his second after-breakfast cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, what's wrong?" the latter asked solicitously.</p>

  <p>"The most awful thing," Vellacott gasped. "Our strong room was broken into
  between closing time on Saturday afternoon and the early hours of this
  morning. Nearly fifty thousand pounds' worth of valuables stolen. They only
  found out about a quarter of an hour ago when my partner got into the
  office."</p>

  <p>"I've got it," the Major cried. "Depend upon it, those men we saw in the
  road were not bona fide workmen at all, but a gang of audacious thieves, led
  by some technical expert."</p>

  <p>"It looks like it," Vellacott groaned. "But how did they manage it? How on
  earth did they manage to get through the walls of the safe?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's easy enough," the Major explained. "They came along with a
  covered truck, which very likely had been stolen from the Universal
  Electricity Company, and it would be very easy to get hold of a set of
  badges. See, the whole thing looks so workmanlike and methodical that the
  police would suspect nothing. When things are done in this cool way, people
  take it for granted. But don't forget that the offices of the Universal
  Electricity Company would be probably closed at one o'clock on Saturday,
  after which all the employees would be away and those chaps would have all
  Saturday afternoon and all Sunday to work. Then once down the manhole, within
  a foot of the outer wall of your strong-room, it wouldn't have taken long to
  clear all the earth away, and expose the steel side. And don't forget that
  those chaps had got a tent over the hole, under cover of which they could
  work without the slightest fear of interruption. They could make as much
  flame and as much smoke as they liked, because that always goes with
  electrical repairs."</p>

  <p>"The safe," Vellacott moaned. "The safe. With a solid foot of
  radio-steel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, into which the flame of an acetylene welding plant would eat as if
  the steel were so much rotten cheese. And, mind you, those plants are
  portable. You may depend upon it that those chaps have been planning this
  coup for months. Really, the more I think of it, the more I admire them. And
  then again, look how cleverly they arranged to carry off the swag! They carry
  it in that covered cart of theirs, and put all their tools on the top, then
  they coolly push the cart through the streets of London for miles until they
  come to their lair. Nobody would notice them, nobody would take the slightest
  heed of a Corporation cart going through the streets in broad daylight. You
  have been the victim of an absolutely priceless fraud."</p>

  <p>"I have," Vellacott groaned. "I have. But I mustn't sit here. I must be
  off to London at once."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose you must," the Major said reluctantly. "If you are going
  up in the car, I'll come along with you."</p>

  <p>"That's very good of you," Vellacott said gratefully. "To tell the truth,
  I feel too shaky to go alone."</p>

  <p>Apparently, the Major's diagnosis had been correct, for when the two
  silent voyagers reached Moorgate-st. the police had already come to their own
  conclusions. Inquiries at the offices of the Universal Electricity Company
  elicited the fact that no employees of theirs had been near Moorgate-st. on
  the previous Saturday. But a covered cart and certain plant were missing from
  their stores, and these had been discovered a few minutes ago by the police,
  abandoned somewhere in the north of London. It was a powerful little plant,
  and given the necessary time was strong enough to have eaten its way through
  the dome of St. Paul's.</p>

  <p>"Neat, very neat," the Inspector said, half-admiringly. "No one seems to
  have seen these men, at least, not near enough to identify them. It's very
  hard to spot a man when he's smothered in grease and dirt, but one of my men
  says that their leader was a tall man and wore a black moustache."</p>

  <p>"Ah, there you are," the Major put in presently. "Now I happened to be
  waiting for Mr. Vellacott, and, having nothing to do exchanged a few words
  with the foreman. He was a fair, blue-eyed man, with a scar on his left
  cheek, and was as clean shaven as I am. As to the others, I didn't notice
  them. But if I can do anything now, or at any future time, you can command my
  services. If you ran lay your hand on the right man, I can identify him fast
  enough."</p>

  <p>There was little more to be said or done. For the moment the thieves had
  got clean away with the spoil, and though the Inspector seemed to be
  confident enough he had really little hope of effecting a capture. It was a
  dreary afternoon that the Major spent with Vellacott, and night closed down
  at length with nothing in the way of a clue.</p>

  <p>"Are you going back to Sandbourne?" the Major asked.</p>

  <p>Vellacott shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not," he said. "I have 'phoned my wife to return by train,
  and she is coming. I may get down to Sandbourne at the end of the week, but
  it is very doubtful. I simply couldn't play golf in my present distracted
  state of mind."</p>

  <p>"That's natural enough," the Major agreed. "And if this little speculation
  of mine comes off I hope to see you at Sandwich."</p>

  <p>And with that they parted. Vellacott to look after his business and the
  Major to transact some pressing affair which took him somewhere down into the
  East End. It was late the following evening when he found himself once more
  in the Majestic at Sandbourne, and, after having partaken of an exceptionally
  good dinner, he repaired to his bedroom, where he wrote the following
  letter:&mdash;-</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Morrison,&mdash;I have the greatest pleasure in
  telling you that I have been eminently successful with regard to that little
  business of mine. I am not disposed to go into details, because they don't
  matter, in any case, but I told you that I strongly objected to becoming one
  of the Poorer Poor when there are so many Richer Rich knocking about. They
  are not bad fellows to dine and play golf with, but that wouldn't prevent
  them from squeezing the last farthing out of you tomorrow morning if you ran
  up against them in business. It was one of these genial swine who caused me
  to leave the Indian Army some years ago, with considerable celerity and
  secrecy, and you are one of the few men who know the story. But I swore to
  get my own back one of these days, and I have done it&mdash;never mind
  how.</p>

  <p class="letter">To cut a long story short, you can conclude negotiations
  for the purchase of that bungalow, and, if you will telephone me here any
  time within the next two or three days. I will send my cheque along for my
  share. Some good golf and an occasional run up to town will satisfy my
  requirements for the future. So let me know directly you are ready. All the
  best, Yours, aye,</p>

  <p class="letter">Philip Medway.</p>

  <p class="letter">P.S.&mdash;I want to ask one of my friends down to Sandwich
  shortly. He's five handicap, and not a bad chap as business men go. He's one
  of the Richer Rich, but not quite so infernally so as he was last
  week.</p><br>

     name="story9">9.&mdash;THE BLINDWORM</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 7 Jun
  1924</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MARTIN HOUSE for the first time in a lurid life was
  conscious of a fear. It was as if some high tension wire in his mechanism had
  suddenly relaxed, throwing his whole mental machinery out of gear. Just for
  an instant, and then he was himself again.</p>

  <p>Still, the precious diary had gone&mdash;two minutes before it had been
  lying on the library table in its tin case, with the folio leaves neatly
  bound with wire clips, just as House had brought it back from the neverlands,
  from the interior of Brazil, where no white man had ever set foot before.
  Some day, that nightmare story would be told, but there was much to be done
  first, and the harvest of the great adventure to be reaped. And if some enemy
  behind the financial scene had got away with that priceless diary with its
  treasured secrets, then those five scalding, blistering years, were as
  dust.</p>

  <p>One moment, and House was himself again. He rang the bell, and Herad, the
  butler, entered. He stood there the very pink and model of what a
  well-trained servant should be. He might have been cast in a mould and
  carefully dried in the sun. There was nothing about James Herad to suggest
  the fires of adventure.</p>

  <p>"Did you ring, sir?" he asked with the right shade of deference. "I
  thought I heard the bell, sir."</p>

  <p>"Close the door, Jim," House said in a whisper.</p>

  <p>James Herad had heard that tone before. He had heard it on the reeling
  deck of a sloop in the South Pacific, he had heard it when he stood with a
  service rifle in his hand, when he was hot, spent, and raging with thirst,
  with a murderous mob of Pathans within twenty feet of the crumbling stockade
  and death was grinning in his bloodshot eyes. And Herad was an understanding
  man.</p>

  <p>"Is it trouble, Captain?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Jim, my big diary has been stolen. I was working on it when Rogers passed
  the window and called to me. He seemed rather upset about something, so I
  stepped through the window and stood not more than a minute talking to him on
  the terrace. It seems that a rat has gnawed a hole in the back of one of the
  small reptile houses, and the two Martinique blindworms are nowhere to be
  found. They are probably hidden away in the mossy slope by the summer house
  overlooking the sea. But never mind about them now. When I got back in here
  the diary was gone."</p>

  <p>"Somebody in the house then," Herad suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not a doubt about that, Jim. But who? Captain Haines and Mr. Swainson I
  would go bail for, and as to Mr. Milton you know how harmless and helpless he
  is. See that nobody leaves the house without being watched. Get Rogers to
  help you. He was with us out yonder, and is to be relied on thoroughly. Keep
  a strict eye on the village post office. The thief might try to mail the
  diary to some accomplice. It would have to go by parcel post, as, with the
  tin case, it weighs about ten pounds. Call up Mr. Bly for me on the
  'phone."</p>

  <p>House sat down a little later with a big black cigar to think matters
  over. The loss of the diary would mean something like ruin to him and his
  daughter Etne. Practically all that he had in the world had been sunk in the
  purchase of the pretty little estate on the Sussex coast, which he had
  invested in when he returned from that wild adventure in higher Brazil. He
  and Bly and the rest had realised their fondest hopes there, and at the
  present moment, were in negotiation for the Government concessions necessary
  to turn that daring raid through hitherto unexplored territory, into
  substantial advantage. Two companies had already been formed, and the cash of
  scores of trusting friends invested in the promising adventure. But if
  certain unscrupulous business men in the city, whom House feared, got wind of
  what was still more or less in the air, then the whole airy fabric might
  collapse altogether.</p>

  <p>This blow had been dealt him by somebody under his own roof, and there the
  sting lay. The servants were absolutely innocent, House was quite convinced
  of that. Both Herad and Rogers were true as steel. The same remark applied to
  Effie, his daughter. There only remained, then, Captain Haines and his wife,
  and John Swainson and his, and House had known these men for years both in
  India, where Haines held a commission in the Gurkhas, and had married the
  only child of a wealthy Calcutta merchant. There remained only one, Aubrey
  Milton, who was by way of being a sort of protegee of House's, a mild,
  harmless kind of youth with no money to speak of, and a burning desire to
  become another Robert Louis Stevenson. He had given birth to a slim volume of
  poems of the inevitable neurotic type, and he was anxious for House to find
  him some light, congenial employment in Fiji or elsewhere, where he could
  bask in a tropical climate and witch the world with noble penmanship. He had
  come to House with a letter of introduction from a recently deceased old chum
  of the pioneer's of Australia, and it was characteristic of House that he had
  given Milton the run of his establishment. House could not see Milton with
  nerve enough to steal anything more dangerous than a pin.</p>

  <p>And yet the daring and audacious thief was in the house somewhere. House
  said nothing of his loss, and watched his guests with a stealthy furtiveness
  of which he was half ashamed. But watch as he would, the next two days
  pending the arrival of his friend and partner, Eldon Bly, he could detect
  nothing by so much as the flicker of an eyelid.</p>

  <p>Bly arrived late on the third night, when most of the party had retired
  for the evening. He came, alert, vigorous, a little atomy of a man, with a
  thin hawk-like nose, and a restless black eye, that seemed to see everything.
  A distinguished career in the Indian Police had preceeded his partnership
  with House since when the two men had been inseparable, and now their
  fortunes were bound up in the concessions which they were still negotiating
  with a none too honest South American Republic. Bly went straight to the
  point.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had the main facts from you on the 'phone," he said rapidly. "The
  danger is plain. If the Mason gang got hold of that diary, we are done. They
  have the money behind them, and can outbid us with those Government
  officials."</p>

  <p>"Right," House interrupted, "but some information has reached London from
  here. Not much, because the lookout has been too keen, but enough to justify
  Mason in inspiring his reptile rag, the 'Financial Post' with an article on
  our companies. And the same group are actually booming our El Maduros shares.
  I expect they are looking forward to controlling that venture before long.
  Perhaps you would like to see it. I've got the paper here."</p>

  <p>But, strangely enough, the paper in question, which had been on the
  library table most of the day, was not to be found. Evidently some one
  interested in such matters had removed it, and Bly was disposed to regard
  this as significant.</p>

  <p>"Who could have taken it?" he asked. "What about the poet chap you were
  speaking of?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Milton," House smiled. "He's only a child. What's puzzling me, is how
  the thief, whoever he is, managed to convey to the Mason gang that he had the
  diary, and give them the information on which that 'Post' article was
  based."</p>

  <p>"What about the telephone?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord. I had forgotten all about that," House cried. "The thief might
  have managed that when we were playing tennis. I think you are right, old
  man, as usual. He 'phoned that he had got hold of the diary, and as an
  earnest of the fact he gave them such information as would enable them to
  print that article. But Mason's lot are more or less powerless until they can
  handle the diary itself, and so long as it is still near at hand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's our safeguard," Bly said thoughtfully. "The thief has not moved
  for fear of rousing suspicion. He has hidden the diary somewhere, and is
  content to wait until the scent grows cold. Now just think what happened on
  the morning you lost the book. Were you enticed to leave this room?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't," House explained. "Rogers came along the terrace in a great
  state because he had lost those two Martinique blindworms you gave me. He
  knew they were the only pair ever seen in England, and how rare they were,
  and I was very angry with him. However, it was a rat that was to blame. Ate a
  hole in the back of the hutch. We've got one back but the other has vanished
  completely."</p>

  <p>"Bad luck," Bly murmured. "Though I could never understand your craze for
  running a sort of menagerie here."</p>

  <p>"None of them dangerous," House pleaded. "Besides, it reminds me of old
  times. I wasn't with Rogers more than a minute, but when I got back here the
  diary was gone."</p>

  <p>Bly pondered the point for some time in silence. One thing was
  certain&mdash;the thief was in the house.</p>

  <p>"I should like to sleep on it," Bly said. "Is the same old woman still in
  charge of the village post office?"</p>

  <p>House nodded absently. If Bly was seized with one of his happy
  inspirations as seemed probable from the more or less inconsequent question
  about the village post office, he was not in the least likely to be
  communicative until he was more sure of his ground. He moved about amongst
  the other guests the next day, exchanging notes with Haines and Swainson,
  both of whom he knew, and he made himself agreeable to Aubrey Milton, who
  struck him as being the last possibility in the way of an ass. The man seemed
  to be perfectly harmless, a weed of a creature, full of little mannerisms and
  affectations just as one might expect in the minor poet and would-be literary
  man sighing for the congenial atmosphere wherein to write the masterpiece
  that was to set the world ablaze. His vapid manner, his silly eyeglass that
  constantly fell from his watery orb, and his flowing tie, a la Byron, palled
  on Bly presently, and he ceased to sharpen his wit on the unconscious
  Milton.</p>

  <p>The 'Mute Inglorious Milton' retired presently to his favourite alcove on
  the edge of the cliffs behind the reptile house, where he was supposed to be
  engaged on the first of the great novels which was in time to shake the
  literary world to its foundations.</p>

  <p>"A lovely spot, an ideal writing place, Mr. Bly," he simpered. "I am
  looking forward to having you all to myself there this afternoon, and talking
  about those amazing scenes of tropical beauty with which you are so familiar.
  Ah, the inspiration of them! I shall never rest until I also have seen them
  with these eyes."</p>

  <p>"I shall enjoy it immensely," Bly said drily.</p>

  <p>He strolled away from the tennis ground presently and made his way towards
  the village, mooning along with the air of a man whose mind is an absolute
  blank. He gazed absently into the windows of the village shops until he
  drifted into the general store that did duty as the post office. It was quite
  empty as it generally was at that time of day, and the old lady in the horn
  spectacles behind the counter hailed him eagerly as an old acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"Bless me if it ain't Mr. Bly," she exclaimed, "How be you, sir? Come down
  to see the captain again, yes, yes."</p>

  <p>Bly sprawled over the counter talking in his most genial manner. Then
  gradually he contrived to lead the gossip into the channel he desired. Has
  Mrs. Lacy a general post office directory by any chance? He wanted the
  telegraphic registered address of a firm in London whose code he had
  forgotten. It was a long address, and he didn't want to waste money on
  superfluous words. Mrs. Lacey had unfortunately nothing of the kind but she
  was in sympathy with what Mr. Bly was asking for. And surely some of those
  addresses were strange reading. The captain&mdash;meaning House&mdash;sent
  off some funny ones now and then. But there was one gentleman who came in a
  few days ago and sent off a telegram, to a place in London with a registered
  address that fairly gave the good-natured old gossip the creeps. Of course
  she ought not to talk about it, but then Mr. Bly was different to most
  people, and he would not mention the fact. But the man she was speaking of
  had actually sent a wire addressed to 'Bloodshed, London.' Fairly made her
  creep, it did.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man?" Bly asked with a quizzical smile. "Did he look like
  a pirate? Was he armed?"</p>

  <p>Bly's tone was jocular, but he was really interested.</p>

  <p>"You're a rare gentleman for your joke," the old lady laughed. "I couldn't
  rightly say, sir. In motoring things, he were, and them goggles. And he sent
  that telegram, he did."</p>

  <p>It was all quite wrong, of course, but Bly stayed there until he had
  contrived to have a good look at the original copy of the wire addressed to
  'Bloodshed, London.' With the thin spidery writing clearly photographed on
  his mental retina, he strolled back to the house shortly before lunch time,
  just as Milton was crossing the tennis lawn on his way back from the alcove
  on the edge of the cliffs where he had presumedly been working. Bly retraced
  his steps until he came to the secluded spot which was immediately behind the
  range of glass houses, originally an aviary, where House kept his snakes and
  the few South American animals that formed his menagerie. In the alcove was a
  newspaper or two, and some sheets of original manuscript which Bly rightly
  judged to be in Milton's handwriting. He smiled in a pleased manner as he
  unblushingly read the poem on which the budding genius had been working. Then
  he folded up one of the newspapers and placed it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>A little way off, Rogers was at work. He looked up and touched his hat as
  Bly approached. These two were old friends, and had been in many a tight
  place in the bad lands of unexplored Brazil together.</p>

  <p>"Very pleased to see you again, sir," Rogers said. "We've lost one of them
  snakes of yours, I'm sorry to say, sir."</p>

  <p>"Ah, so Mr. House told me. It's rather a pity, seeing that the Martinique
  blindworm is practically unique. I understand that you found the other one. I
  wouldn't give it up yet, Rogers."</p>

  <p>"I haven't, sir," Rogers said. "He's probably hiding in the long mossy
  grass by the alcove. We haven't had any rain for over a month, and Sally, as
  I call her, must have moisture. She could snuggle down in that thick moss and
  hide for days, but when the rain comes she'll come back to be fed; that's if
  she's alive still."</p>

  <p>Rogers moved off to his work, and for a moment Bly stood earnestly
  regarding the small square of thick mossy turf in front of the alcove.
  Undoubtedly the blindworm had come that way, when it had escaped, in
  preference to crossing the asphalt that surrounded the menagerie on the other
  three sides, and doubtless, had buried itself in the thick carpet of moss
  that underlay the course turf. Then Bly's keen trained eye made out the
  grooved track the snake had made in crossing the open ground. The track
  stopped suddenly and vanished underground. Prone on his face, Bly fumbled in
  the moss and parted it carefully with his fingers, using them as a comb. In
  the sunshine something glistened like a thin piece of rope made of gold and
  shimmering blue and emerald. Then there was a hiatus of an inch or two, and
  then the jewelled rope began again, to end once more some twelve inches
  further on in nothing. It was like a string of jewels on a broken thread,
  fractured in three places. But only eyes as keen as those of Bly would have
  detected it.</p>

  <p>He gently touched the severed edges, and at the same time was careful not
  to move them. In that moment a fine flash of illumination had come to him,
  and, if he were not altogether mistaken, he had not only solved the mystery
  of the missing diary, but found the thief at the same time. It was one of
  those instances of luck that generally go to the man with the intimate
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>It was nearly teatime before Bly had his chance to speak to his host alone
  in the library.</p>

  <p>"Well," the latter asked eagerly, "I could see that you were on to
  something by the look in your eye when you came in to lunch. Mean to say that
  you have got to the bottom of it?"</p>

  <p>"I believe I have," Bly said modestly. "But I can tell you more about that
  when I have had a look at your copy of the post office directory of
  registered telegraphic addresses. After that I want a strip of thin cardboard
  about a foot long and some three inches wide. Yes, I think that the diary is
  safe now."</p>

  <p>House asked no questions. He knew Bly better than that. He produced the
  book that Bly required, and waited for further instructions. They were not
  long in coming.</p>

  <p>"Look up 'Bloodshed, London,'" Bly snapped. "I think that they will prove
  to be old friends of yours."</p>

  <p>"Mason, Blood, and Evershed," House announced presently. "That's the firm
  that Mason is head of. And a very fine nom de plume, too. Is this what you
  expected to get?"</p>

  <p>"I should have been a bit sick otherwise," Bly said drily. "About a week
  ago somebody staying in this house sent a wire to Mason addressed to his
  firm, to the effect that the sender was staying in these parts for the
  present, and that he would communicate through the usual channel, but
  'Bloodshed, London,' was on no account to try and reach the party who sent
  the wire from here. I know what I am talking about because I have seen the
  original wire, thanks to my friendship with Mrs. Lacy, of the post office.
  Now which of the men who are staying here arrived on a motor cycle?"</p>

  <p>"Swainson did over a week ago, his wife coming by train. Mil&mdash;arrived
  here the same night, and so did Haines."</p>

  <p>"Is the poet man enough to mount a petrol driven machine?"</p>

  <p>"Yen, I think he had Swainson's out one morning for an hour just after he
  came," House explained, "But why?"</p>

  <p>"All in good time," Bly laughed. "Now get me that piece of cardboard, and
  go back to your guests again as if nothing had happened. If I am successful,
  just before dinner, as I expect to be, I will give you the tip and directly
  after dinner I want you to join me in the library for a few minutes. So
  long."</p>

  <p>Bly vanished with his slip of cardboard, and House was left to possess his
  soul in patience as best he could. But in due course, he caught a triumphant
  gleam in Bly's eye and joined him in the library, leaving the guests enjoying
  their after dinner smoke on the terrace. Bly said nothing, but pointed to a
  square object on the table, a tin box that had apparently just been dug out
  of the wet ground. House gasped in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"The diary!" he gurgled. "Good Lord, Bly, how&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"Presently," Bly smiled. "Meanwhile there is something else to be done.
  Ask the poet to come this way."</p>

  <p>House beckoned to Milton through the open French window, and that
  individual drifted in with his inane smile and the usual suggestion of aloof
  superiority that marked him always. But, as his shallow blue eyes lighted on
  the tin case on the library table in the direction of the door, it was a
  different man altogether who turned a fighting face towards Bly. The
  dilletante had vanished, a man of action suddenly stood in his place.</p>

  <p>"No, you don't," Bly said between his teeth. "You stay here if you want to
  keep a whole skin, my friend. Now then&mdash;how long has your name been
  Aubrey Milton, and how did you contrive to get that forged reference from the
  late Mr. Brightwell, of Sydney? Come, you know what I mean&mdash;the letter
  of introduction that gave you the entree into this house?"</p>

  <p>"Really, I don't understand you," Milton drawled. "Mr. Brightwell was an
  old friend of my father's and I stayed with him in Australia. If you doubt my
  bona fides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We will come to that presently," Bly said grimly. "In the meantime, let
  me ask you a further question. And don't forget that I am in a position to
  force a reply. How long have you been in the pay of Mr. George Mason, of the
  firm of Mason, Blood, and Evershed? What did he offer you in exchange for Mr.
  House's diary?"</p>

  <p>"Never heard of the man," Milton said indifferently.</p>

  <p>Bly turned with a look almost of regret to House.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry," he murmured, "but I am afraid that we shall have to make a
  police matter of this after all. You'll have to give this man into custody,
  House. Of course you want to avoid a scandal, but there are limits. I'll look
  after this chap whilst you call up the police at Brighton on the
  telephone."</p>

  <p>Milton wilted slightly. But he was game still, and in spite of it all Bly
  respected the new Milton far more than the old one.</p>

  <p>"Think again," Bly said almost pleasantly, "think again."</p>

  <p>"Well, put your cards on the table," Milton snapped.</p>

  <p>"Right. About a week ago, just after you got here, you sent a wire to
  Mason, the scoundrel who is trying to ruin your host, the effect that you
  were safely landed here and would communicate in due course, but that Mason
  was not to try and get you here. You borrowed Mr. Swainson's mackintoshes and
  goggles, so that the sender of the message should not be recognised, but you
  wouldn't deny your own handwriting on the message. Then you managed to get
  hold of that diary, which Mason had heard of through the treachery of a clerk
  once in our employ, and very cleverly you did it. You are a brilliant
  psychologist, Mr. Milton. And your acting is uncommonly neat. Most men would
  have bolted with the diary, but you knew better than that. You hid it
  instead, waiting for the thing to blow over. And I found it by the merest
  accident in the world."</p>

  <p>"So I see," Milton said quite pleasantly. "You are too many for me, Mr.
  Bly. I am on Mason's staff, and I volunteered to lay hands on the diary,
  which would have meant a fortune to the firm. Incidentally, perhaps one for
  myself. But how on earth&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Heard enough, House?" Bly interrupted. "Better pitch this chap out, and
  tell the others he was suddenly called away. Motor him over to Brighton,
  what?"</p>

  <p>Milton departed presently, unconcerned to the last and quite without
  shame. He had failed in his mission when on the very verge of success, and
  that was the one thing that worried his predatory soul. He was easy and
  smiling to the last, and seemed to bear no malice. There was something almost
  fine in the way in which he asked House to convey his regrets to the others
  that he had not the time to make his own adieux.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's a pretty scoundrel for you," House cried.</p>

  <p>"Let's hope it will be the last," Bly smiled. "My dear old chap, you have
  a perfect magnetism for the average rotter. They come round you like flies.
  And you are no fool either. Any rascal can get the tale over you. I can call
  to mind a score of Miltons."</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that," House grinned. "Tell me how you managed to touch
  bottom over this business."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't very difficult up to a certain point," Bly said as he lighted a
  cigarette. "Moreover, I had luck. And I didn't suspect Milton at first
  because he played his idiotic part so well that he fairly deceived me. But
  somebody in the house was pulling the strings, and somebody in the house was
  in possession of the diary. From the precautions you took it was obvious that
  the book was still on the premises. All the same, I thought that I could get
  something from old Mrs. Lacey, at the post office, and I did. I found out
  that somebody in these parts had sent a wire to 'Bloodshed, London,' which
  turned out on investigation to be Mason, Blood, and Evershed, the people we
  have most to fear. I contrived to see the original of that telegram, and made
  a mental photograph of the handwriting. A little later on, in the alcove
  where our ci devant poet worked, I found some of his manuscript. It was the
  handwriting of the telegram. That, of course, was blind luck. So was the
  finding in the same place of the copy of the 'Financial Post' you couldn't
  lay your hands on. So there was the thief properly earmarked."</p>

  <p>"But how about the diary?" House demanded eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I'm just coming to that," Bly went on. "I knew then who had the diary.
  That was something to the good. Then I ran into Rogers, who told me all about
  the missing Martinique blindworm. The other one had been found in the moss on
  the open patch by the alcove. It occurred to me that perhaps the mate was
  lying perdu in the damp, so I had a look for it. I found the track, and then
  as suddenly lost it. Then I found the worm dead, and, moreover, cut into
  three pieces with some blunt instrument, probably a spade. After it had
  buried itself in the moss, somebody had plunged a spade into the turf for
  some reason, not once, but at least three times. Why? To dig a hole. Why did
  somebody want to dig a hole there? It came on me like a flash. To bury the
  diary there. Close to the spot where Milton passed most of his time. I should
  never have found the snake, only the brilliant sunshine was full upon the
  place, and I just caught a glimpse of the glittering gaudy skin. Then with my
  strip of cardboard, I felt for the slender parting in the mossy turf, where
  the spade had done its work, and, surely enough, the cardboard went in quite
  easily. Up came the loose covering of moss, and there in a hollow lay the
  diary in its tin case. Of course, Milton had no idea, when using his spade,
  that he was cutting through one of the rarest snakes in the world. And the
  blindworm was too deep in the moss for him to see it wriggling, or, perhaps
  he was nervous and in a desperate hurry. And that's all there is to it,
  partner."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10">10.&mdash;THE MAN WHO RANG THE BELL</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 20 Sep
  1924</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE BODY of Stephen Kelland had been found at half-past two
  in the morning, and Mrs. Larner, the old lady with whom the dead man had
  lodged, had gone off to the police station without arousing her neighbours.
  She was a grim, strong-minded old body, but if ever she had a weakness for
  one of her lodgers, it was for the dead man, who, up to yesterday, was acting
  editor of the "Mireshire County Herald."</p>

  <p>On Thursday and Friday nights, which were publishing days, the dead man
  Kelland rarely reached home before 2 o'clock in the morning. Usually he let
  himself in with his latch key, and found his way to his room, which was at
  the back of the house, leading off the garden, where he rang a bell that
  communicated with the back basement apartment, where Mrs. Larner slept.
  There, over her bed, facing the window, she had a master switch with which
  she was in the habit of turning on the electric light when Kelland rang his
  bell, which she invariably heard, being a light sleeper, and so the light
  remained for precisely half an hour, at the end of which period it was turned
  off again, whether Kelland was in bed or not. It was one of the old lady's
  fads, a rule she would as soon have broken as she would the tables of the
  Commandments.</p>

  <p>All this she explained to Venner as he sat opposite her in the ground
  floor sitting-room. She informed him that Kelland had come in just after 2,
  as she plainly heard, that he had fastened up the front door and gone into
  his own room. He rang as usual, a good long ring, which she heard
  immediately. Then the bell stopped more abruptly than usual, and was
  immediately followed by a heavy fall overhead. She would not have
  particularly noticed this, she said; the thing that aroused her suspicion was
  the fact that the light was not switched on in the room overhead. She knew
  that because her bed faced the window, looking into the back basement, and as
  this was lighted with white tiles so as to give as much illumination as
  possible, she would have noticed at once if the electric bulb in Mr.
  Kelland's sitting-room had been turned on. She had waited ten minutes without
  the darkness being broken, and then, feeling somewhat alarmed, she had
  slipped on part of her clothing and gone up the kitchen stairs to
  investigate.</p>

  <p>"You can leave us now," Inspector Venner said. "Dr. Hack and myself will
  make the examination. Doctor, this is no suicide."</p>

  <p>"Out of the question," the doctor responded. "You see, the poor fellow was
  standing on the right-hand side of the fireplace with his right hand on the
  bell, and was killed in the act of ringing it. Of course, I cannot speak
  quite definitely as yet, but a bullet from some weapon struck him immediately
  below the shoulder, and seems to have deflected through the heart. If I had
  found a revolver here with one chamber discharged, I should still be certain
  it was murder. No man could have shot himself in that way; there must have
  been somebody in the room."</p>

  <p>The detective crossed the room to the open window, the blind of which was
  up, and the two old-fashioned casements thrown wide apart. Immediately
  underneath was the white tiled basement, some 10ft. deep, into which it would
  have been impossible for an assassin to have dropped, or indeed gained the
  room by that means, without arousing the landlady from her sleep in her back
  basement bedroom which had originally been used as a scullery.</p>

  <p>"Nobody came or went this way," he said. "And if you look, you will see
  the switch by the door is still pushed up. No doubt Mr. Kelland came into the
  room and walked across to the fireplace to ring up his landlady without first
  pressing down the switch. I suppose that is rather a loud bell that rings
  down there in the basement."</p>

  <p>With that, Venner crossed the room again and pressed his finger on the
  button. The clang that responded rang all over the house. With a little nod
  of approval, the police officer crossed to the window again and looked out
  through the still open window to the little old-world garden which faced,
  some 50 yards away, a similar avenue of houses, so that the two were back to
  back. They were situated in the ancient part of Padbury, and had been built
  perhaps a hundred years before. A party wall divided the two sets of gardens,
  a wall only a few feet in height.</p>

  <p>"Did you know anything of the dead man?" Venner asked the doctor. "Was he
  a patient of yours by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"Slightly tubercular," Hack responded. "That is why he always made a point
  of living practically behind open windows. I don't suppose his windows were
  ever closed. He was very careful about that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>For some time after the doctor had left. Venner stood thoughtfully gazing
  out of the open window at the back of the houses in Watersmeet-avenue. They
  were houses built precisely on the same lines as those in Mayfield-avenue,
  and doubtless they both had been built at the same time. They were quite
  respectable houses, with basements, and two stories over, and each had its
  neat little garden in which the inhabitants appeared to take considerable
  pride. There were very few trees, the garden consisting mainly of flower beds
  and grass plots, with here and there a small greenhouse, with its back to the
  wall. It was quite a long time before Venner turned away and began a close
  examination of the sitting-room; all to no effect.</p>

  <p>By this time the whole town was seething with excitement. Everybody was
  open-mouthed and everybody more than anxious to throw some light upon the
  mystery. But it was not till late in the afternoon, that Venner hit upon one
  of the residents in Watersmeet-avenue who was really in a position to tell
  him something worthy of note.</p>

  <p>This was a retired seafarer named Kelly, who lived in Number 14, as a
  lodger who occupied a sitting-room at the back of the house, almost
  immediately facing that in which the tragedy had taken place. He had heard
  something, and had gone round to the police station to give his information.
  Confronted with Venner, he told his apparently simple story.</p>

  <p>"You see, it was like this," he said. "I am a rotten sleeper, always have
  been. I am a great sufferer from asthma, and all yesterday and last night I
  had one of my worst attacks. From midnight till nearly three this morning I
  sat in my sitting-room with the window wide open, leaning out struggling for
  breath."</p>

  <p>"And you saw something?" Venner asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I can't rightly say that I saw something, but some time after
  two o'clock I heard what sounded like a shot. I did not take much notice, but
  I don't think anybody else heard it, because I saw no lights anywhere, and
  heard nothing moving."</p>

  <p>"And that is all?" Venner asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is all I can tell you, sir."</p>

  <p>It was really a baffling mystery, but the old man could tell Venner no
  more. How had it been possible for the murderer to shoot down his victim in
  the pitch blackness of the sitting-room? And again, if Kelland had been
  murdered by a shot fired from the garden through the open window, how could
  the assassin be so sure of his aim? The mere fact that he was intimately
  acquainted with the ways and habits of his victim could not help him to that
  extent.</p>

  <p>One thing, there was plenty of time. He walked back to the gardens in
  Mayfield-Avenue, and made a further examination of the basement outside Mrs.
  Larner's bedroom. It was some ten feet deep, and not more than four wide,
  enclosed on either side with a wall of polished white tiles, so that anybody
  down there would be held a prisoner unless he had something to stand on, so
  as to get a grip on the railing above his head. And there was nothing in the
  basement of any kind whatever. Certainly the assassin had not gone that way.
  He could not have shot his enemy and rushed down the basement stairs and out
  into the garden without attracting the attention of Mrs. Larner, who was wide
  awake at the time. And so Venner was forced to the conclusion that the
  murderer had not been in the house at all. He must have shot Kelland from the
  garden and escaped.</p>

  <p>But this only made the problem harder still. It was, therefore, necessary
  at this point to try back a little, to make further inquiries, which Venner
  proceed to do. He elicited the fact that the dead man had only held his
  important post for the last few months, and that in the opinion of the office
  he had more or less supplanted one Barwick, who had by no means taken the
  set-back lying down. The proprietor of the "County Herald," Raymond
  Barringford, confirmed this. Venner found him at his country seat, just
  outside the town, and was received with every courtesy.</p>

  <p>"I am terribly distressed over this dreadful business," he said. "If I had
  known a week ago what I know now, I should have got rid of both Kelland and
  Barwick."</p>

  <p>"You were dissatisfied with both of them, then?"</p>

  <p>"By no means. On the contrary, I had the highest opinion of Stephen
  Kelland, and I am bound to say that Barwick does his work exceedingly well.
  But he is jealous and easily touched, and extremely ready to take offence.
  One of those morbid sensitive natures that torments itself, and in his way
  quite a genius. He has a wonderful flair for the short story, and if he were
  not so morbid and prurient in his work, he might have gone far. That is a
  grievance of his against the editorial fraternity generally, but really some
  of his work is frankly disgusting."</p>

  <p>"There was no quarrel between these two?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Barwick is not the man to openly quarrel with anybody.
  I hope you don't suspect that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't suspect anybody," Venner interrupted. "I am not far advanced
  enough for that. And you may rest assured that anything you have said to me
  will be treated as confidential."</p>

  <p>With that, Venner went back to Padbury very little wiser than he came.
  Then he repaired once more to the lodgings of the dead man and spent half the
  morning in the garden. He was about to turn away when a voice suddenly hailed
  him. It was a voice that seemed to come from nowhere, and one that that
  addressed him on terms that sounded like flippant familiarity.</p>

  <p>"Hello, hello," it said. "Morning cocky."</p>

  <p>Venner looked up to see a grey parrot seated on an overhanging bough, and
  evidently deeply enjoying his own demoniacal wit. Its head was on one side,
  and its little round, wicked eye twinkled with sly malice. Then the bird flew
  away and seemed to disappear through an open window opposite. Venner went
  back to the house and called Mrs. Larner up from the basement.</p>

  <p>"To whom does that parrot belong," he asked. "It seems to be an
  exceedingly clever bird."</p>

  <p>"Yes, isn't he a wonder, sir?" the old lady said. "He belongs to Mr.
  Barwick. I believe Mr. Barwick's family has had him for years. Jacko, they
  call him. He comes here just as if the place belongs to him, and I suppose in
  a measure it does, because Mr. Barwick lived here in Mr. Kelland's rooms a
  long time before the poor gentleman came to Padbury. Jacko flies all over the
  place, and everybody is glad to see him. In fine weather he lives in the
  gardens, but if it is cold or wet, he always comes back to his own rooms. You
  see, Mr. Kelland's window was always open, so there was no trouble about
  that."</p>

  <p>Venner sighed deeply and thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so Mr. Barwick used to live here, did he? Occupying Mr. Kelland's
  rooms? Why did he leave?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, sir, we couldn't get on together very well. I have my own
  queer notions, and Mr. Barwick, he couldn't put up with them. I am all for
  economy, and Mr. Barwick, he didn't know the meaning of the word. He would
  come in late, and thought nothing of leaving his electric light on all night.
  So I had that master switch put in, and Mr. Barwick he gave me notice."</p>

  <p>"Was he very late of nights?" Venner asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, not so late as Mr. Kelland used to be on Thursday and Friday
  nights. But Mr. Kelland didn't mind. He used to laugh at me in a good-natured
  way, and said he should put me in a book some day. So Mr. Barwick
  left&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where does he lodge now?" Venner asked.</p>

  <p>"Just opposite, sir, in Watersmeet-avenue. There is his window, as you can
  see for yourself."</p>

  <p>"Dear me, this is really interesting," Venner said thoughtfully. "Now,
  Mrs. Larner, I want you to do something for me. I want you to go into Mr.
  Kelland's room and ring the bell&mdash;I mean the bell that sounds in your
  bedroom. A good, long ring, if you won't mind."</p>

  <p>As the old lady moved off to comply with this request, Venner strolled up
  as far as the end of the garden, where he stood in a listening attitude. At
  the end of a few seconds the electric bell trilled out sharp and clear, and a
  moment later Venner was on his way to the police station.</p>

  <p>"Well, how are you getting on?" his Deputy Inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"I think I am getting on very well indeed," Venner said. "But before I can
  go any further I want something done. I want you to make it possible for me
  to have the run of Number 15, Watersmeet-avenue, for a couple of hours or so,
  without anybody being any the wiser."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">It was three days later when Venner strolled into Padbury
  Station with the intention of catching a train that left Padbury just before
  noon for Castleford, the country town, where the connection with the London
  express was made. He arrived a minute or two after Peter Barwick, who stood
  by the booking office, taking a first return to town. Five minutes later,
  they were seated in the same carriage together, and Venner saw to it that
  they were not interrupted. He also saw, with some interest, that Barwick was
  accompanied by a solid leather portmanteau, some three feet long. These men
  had spoken to one another more than once in the last day or so, and it was
  not difficult to drift into a pleasant conversation.</p>

  <p>"A few days' holiday, eh?" Venner asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Barwick explained. "I am going to town on the firm's business. I
  shall be back on Monday with any luck."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am very pleased to have met you like this, because we shan't be
  interrupted, at any rate, not between here and Castleford. And there is
  something important I want to say to you."</p>

  <p>Barwick looked up sharply, with a shade of suspicion in those brooding,
  sombre eyes of his.</p>

  <p>"Anything I can do I am sure," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought you would say that," Venner replied. "It is about that
  unfortunate man, Kelland. We have three quarters of an hour before us, and I
  think I shall be able to say all I want to in that time. Now, in the first
  place I want to know why it was that you shot Stephen Kelland."</p>

  <p>It was an unexpected homethrust, of the deadliest nature, but it did not
  seem to move Barwick in the slightest. He did not even change colour, and
  those moody eyes were quite steady.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to incriminate myself?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Venner replied. "You can refuse to reply if you like.
  When you arrive at Castleford I shall hand you over to the county
  authorities, and, so far as I am concerned, the case in at an end. You can
  speak, or you can remain as silent as you please."</p>

  <p>"I admit nothing," Barwick said quietly. "Perhaps if you will put your
  cards on the table we can come to an understanding. Oh, I know when I am
  beaten, Mr. Venner."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Venner said. "I will give you a general outline of my case.
  You were bitterly jealous of your late colleague, and you brooded over what
  you fancied to be your wrongs until the thing became an obsession with you.
  To begin with before you disagreed with Mrs. Larner, you occupied the rooms
  where Kelland died. You know all about the old lady's fads and habits, and
  you were perfectly aware of the fact that Kelland came home very late on
  Thursday and Friday nights. I understand that you got off on those evenings
  long before Stephen Kelland could leave. Now, you were in a back sitting
  room, some fifty or sixty feet away from Kelland's open window, and waiting
  for him to come back on the night of the murder. You knew the geography of
  Kelland's room as well as he knew it himself. You knew that he was in the
  habit of coming into the house in the dark and going straight to the bell and
  ringing it for the light to be turned on. With your intimate knowledge and
  your late military work, all you had to do was to train a rifle on the spot
  where you knew Kelland would stand when he had his fingers on the bell, and
  pull the trigger. Very possibly you had the rifle fixed in position on the
  window ledge, having trained it before it was dark. There was just the chance
  that you might not have killed your victim, but that was a small risk, and
  you were ready to take it. Directly you heard that bell sound in Mrs.
  Larner's basement you shot. It was a most brilliant criminal idea, and was
  unfortunately successful. But there was one thing you overlooked.</p>

  <p>"Did I?" Barwick asked, dully. "What was that?"</p>

  <p>"The evidence of the bullet. It was fired from a B.S.A. rifle which you
  had hidden away in your rooms, and, if I am not mistaken, you have the weapon
  in your portmanteau there in sections. You are going to get rid of it, but I
  think it would have been much safer if you had done that in Padbury. However,
  there never was a criminal yet who never made a mistake, and that is the
  small percentage that always runs in favour of the police. I am going to take
  possession of that portmanteau and hand it over to the chief constable at
  Castleford. I found the box of cartridges in the chimney of your bedroom when
  I searched your lodgings the day before yesterday."</p>

  <p>"And that is your case?" Barwick asked, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is my case," Venner said.</p>

  <p>"Then there is no more to be said. At least, except so far as I like to
  make a confession. But there is one question I should like to ask you. Did
  that confounded parrot of mine give me away?"</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent, yes," Venner said. "But I think I could have managed
  without that evidence. Now, if you have anything to say I shall be glad to
  hear it, if not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Barwick said with a queer twisted smile. "I will take
  my chance, and, honestly, I don't care whether I live or die. Well, here we
  are at Castleford, and, if I am not mistaken, there is the chief constable
  standing on the platform. I am a clever man, Mr. Venner, but not quite so
  clever as you. And there lies the whole tragedy. Now, then, put the handcuffs
  on&mdash;I am quite ready."</p><br>
