<p class="first">THE day Mr. Reeder arrived at the Public
Prosecutor's office was indeed a day of fate for Mr. Lambton
Green, Branch Manager of the London Scottish and Midland
Bank.</p>

<p>That branch of the bank which Mr. Green controlled was situate
at the corner of Pell Street and Firling Avenue on the 'country
side' of Ealing. It is a fairly large building and, unlike most
suburban branch offices, the whole of the premises were devoted
to banking business, for the bank carried very heavy deposits,
the Lunar Traction Company, with three thousand people on its
pay-roll, the Associated Novelties Corporation, with its enormous
turnover, and the Laraphone Company being only three of the
L.S.M.'s customers.</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoons, in preparation for the pay days of
these corporations, large sums in currency were brought from the
head office and deposited in the steel and concrete strong-room,
which was immediately beneath Mr. Green's private office, but
admission to which was gained through a steel door in the general
office. This door was observable from the street, and to assist
observation there was a shaded lamp fixed to the wall immediately
above, which threw a powerful beam of light upon the door.
Further security was ensured by the employment of a night
watchman, Arthur Malling, an army pensioner.</p>

<p>The bank lay on a restricted police beat which had been so
arranged that the constable on patrol passed the bank every forty
minutes. It was his practice to look through the window and
exchange signals with the night watchman, his orders being to
wait until Malling appeared.</p>

<p>On the night of October 17th Police Constable Burnett stopped
as usual before the wide peep-hole and glanced into the bank. The
first thing he noticed was that the lamp above the strong-room
door had been extinguished. The night watchman was not visible,
and, his suspicions aroused, the officer did not wait for the man
to put in an appearance as he would ordinarily have done, but
passed the window to the door, which, to his alarm, he found
ajar. Pushing it open, he entered the bank, calling Malling by
name.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Permeating the air was a faint, sweet scent which he could not
locate. The general offices were empty and, entering the
manager's room in which a light burnt, he saw a figure stretched
upon the ground. It was the night watchman. His wrists were
handcuffed, two straps had been tightly buckled about his knees
and ankles.</p>

<p>The explanation for the strange and sickly aroma was now
clear. Above the head of the prostrate man was suspended, by a
wire hooked to the picture-rail, an old tin can, the bottom of
which was perforated so that there fell an incessant trickle of
some volatile liquid upon the thick cotton pad which covered
Malling's face.</p>

<p>Burnett, who had been wounded in the war, had instantly
recognised the smell of chloroform and, dragging the unconscious
man into the outer office, snatched the pad from his face and,
leaving him only long enough to telephone to the police station,
sought vainly to bring him to consciousness.</p>

<p>The police reserves arrived within a few minutes, and with
them the divisional surgeon who, fortunately, had been at the
station when the alarm came through. Every effort to restore the
unfortunate man to life proved unavailing.</p>

<p>'He was probably dead when he was found,' was the police
doctor's verdict. 'What those scratches are on his right palm is
a mystery.'</p>

<p>He pulled open the clenched fist and showed half a dozen
little scratches. They were recent, for there was a smear of
blood on the palm.</p>

<p>Burnett was sent at once to arouse Mr. Green, the manager, who
lived in Firling Avenue, at the corner of which the bank stood; a
street of semi-detached villas of a pattern familiar enough to
the Londoner. As the officer walked through the little front
garden to the door he saw a light through the panels, and he had
hardly knocked before the door was opened and Mr. Lambton Green
appeared, fully dressed and, to the officer's discerning eye, in
a state of considerable agitation. Constable Burnett saw on a
hall chair a big bag, a travelling rug and an umbrella.</p>

<p>The little manager listened, pale as death, whilst Burnett
told him of his discovery.</p>

<p>'The bank robbed? Impossible!' he almost shrieked. 'My God!
this is awful!'</p>

<p>He was so near the point of collapse that Burnett had to
assist him into the street.</p>

<p>'I &mdash; I was going away on a holiday,' he said
incoherently, as he walked up the dark thoroughfare towards the
bank premises. 'The fact is &mdash; I was leaving the bank. I
left a note explaining to the directors.'</p>

<p>Into a circle of suspicious men the manager tottered. He
unlocked the drawer of his desk, looked and crumbled up.</p>

<p>'They're not here!' he said wildly. 'I left them here &mdash;
my keys &mdash; with the note!'</p>

<p>And then he swooned. When the dazed man recovered he found
himself in a police cell and, later in the day, he drooped before
a police magistrate, supported by two constables and listened,
like a man in a dream, to a charge of causing the death of Arthur
Malling, and further, of converting to his own use the sum of
£100,000.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the first remand that Mr. John G.
Reeder, with some reluctance for he was suspicious of all
Government departments, transferred himself from his own office
on Lower Regent Street to a somewhat gloomy bureau on the top
floor of the building which housed the Public Prosecutor. In
making this change he advanced only one stipulation: that he
should be connected by private telephone wire with his old
bureau.</p>

<p>He did not demand this &mdash; he never demanded anything. He
asked, nervously and apologetically. There was a certain wistful
helplessness about John G. Reeder that made people feel sorry for
him, that caused even the Public Prosecutor a few uneasy moments
of doubt as to whether he had been quite wise in substituting
this weak-appearing man of middle age for Inspector Holford
&mdash; bluff, capable and heavily mysterious.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was something over fifty, a long-faced gentleman
with sandy-grey hair and a slither of side whiskers that
mercifully distracted attention from his large outstanding ears.
He wore half-way down his nose a pair of steel-rimmed pince-nez,
through which nobody had ever seen him look &mdash; they were
invariably removed when he was reading. A high and flat-crowned
bowler hat matched and yet did not match a frockcoat tightly
buttoned across his sparse chest. His boots were square-toed, his
cravat&mdash;of the broad, chest-protector pattern&mdash;was
ready-made and buckled into place behind a Gladstonian collar.
The neatest appendage to Mr. Reeder was an umbrella rolled so
tightly that it might be mistaken for a frivolous walking cane.
Rain or shine, he carried this article hooked to his arm, and
within living memory it had never been unfurled.</p>

<p>Inspector Holford (promoted now to the responsibilities of
Superintendent) met him in the office to hand over his duties,
and a more tangible quantity in the shape of old furniture and
fixings.</p>

<p>'Glad to know you, Mr. Reeder. I haven't had the pleasure of
meeting you before, but I've heard a lot about you. You've been
doing Bank of England work, haven't you?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder whispered that he had had that honour, and sighed
as though he regretted the drastic sweep of fate that had torn
him from the obscurity of his labours. Mr. Holford's scrutiny was
full of misgivings.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said awkwardly, 'this job is different, though I'm
told that you are one of the best informed men in London, and if
that is the case this will be easy work. Still, we've never had
an outsider&mdash;I mean, so to speak, a private
detective&mdash;in this office before, and naturally the Yard is
a bit&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I quite understand,' murmured Mr. Reeder, hanging up his
immaculate umbrella. 'It is very natural. Mr. Bolond expected the
appointment. His wife is annoyed&mdash;very properly. But she has
no reason to be. She is an ambitious woman. She has a third
interest in a West End dancing club that might be raided one of
these days.'</p>

<p>Holford was staggered. Here was news that was little more than
a whispered rumour at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>'How the devil do you know that?' he blurted.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder's smile was one of self-depreciation.</p>

<p>'One picks up odd scraps of information,' he said
apologetically. 'I&mdash;I see wrong in everything. That is my
curious perversion&mdash;I have a criminal mind!'</p>

<p>Holford drew a long breath.</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;there is nothing much doing. That Ealing case is
pretty clear. Green is an exconvict, who got a job at the bank
during the war and worked up to manager. He has done seven years
for conversion.'</p>

<p>'Embezzlement and conversion,' murmured Mr. Reeder.
'I&mdash;er&mdash;I'm afraid I was the principal witness against
him: bank crimes were rather&mdash;er&mdash;a hobby of mine. Yes,
he got into difficulties with moneylenders. Very
foolish&mdash;extremely foolish. And he doesn't admit his error.'
Mr. Reeder sighed heavily. 'Poor fellow! With his life at stake
one may forgive and indeed condone his pitiful
prevarications.'</p>

<p>The inspector stared at the new man in amazement.</p>

<p>'I don't know that there is much "poor fellow" about him. He
has cached £100,000 and told the weakest yarn that I've ever
read&mdash;you'll find copies of the police reports here, if
you'd like to read them. The scratches on Malling's hand are
curious&mdash;they've found several on the other hand. They are
not deep enough to suggest a struggle. As to the yarn that Green
tells&mdash;'</p>

<p>Mr. J.G. Reeder nodded sadly.</p>

<p>'It was not an ingenious story,' he said, almost with regret.
'If I remember rightly, his story was something like this: he had
been recognised by a man who served in Dartmoor with him, and
this fellow wrote a blackmailing letter telling him to pay or
clear out. Sooner than return to a life of crime, Green wrote out
all the facts to his directors, put the letter in the drawer of
his desk with his keys, and left a note for his head cashier on
the desk itself, intending to leave London and try to make a
fresh start where he was unknown.'</p>

<p>'There were no letters in or on the desk, and no keys,' said
the inspector decisively. 'The only true part of the yarn was
that he had done time.'</p>

<p>'Imprisonment,' suggested Mr. Reeder plaintively. He had a
horror of slang. 'Yes, that was true.'</p>

<p>Left alone in his office, he spent a very considerable time at
his private telephone, communing with the young person who was
still a young person, although the passage of time had dealt
unkindly with her. For the rest of the morning he was reading the
depositions which his predecessor had put on the desk.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the Public Prosecutor
strolled into his room and glanced at the big pile of manuscript
through which his subordinate was wading.</p>

<p>'What are you reading&mdash;the Green business?' he asked,
with a note of satisfaction in his voice. 'I'm glad that is
interesting you, though it seems a fairly straightforward case. I
have had a letter from the president of the man's bank, who for
some reason seems to think Green was telling the truth.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder looked up with that pained expression of his which
he invariably wore when he was puzzled.</p>

<p>'Here is the evidence of Policeman Burnett,' he said. 'Perhaps
you can enlighten me, sir. Policeman Burnett stated in his
evidence&mdash;let me read it:</p>

<p>"'Some time before I reached the bank premises I saw a man
standing at the corner of the street, immediately outside the
bank. I saw him distinctly in the light of a passing mail van. I
did not attach any importance to his presence, and I did not see
him again. It was possible for this man to have gone round the
block and come to 120, Firling Avenue without being seen by me.
Immediately after I saw him, my foot struck against a piece of
iron on the sidewalk. I put my lamp on the object and found it
was an old horseshoe. I had seen children playing with this
particular shoe earlier in the evening. When I looked again
towards the corner, the man had disappeared. He would have seen
the light of my lamp. I saw no other person, and so far as I can
remember, there was no light showing in Green's house when I
passed it."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder looked up.</p>

<p>'Well?' said the Prosecutor. 'There's nothing remarkable about
that. It was probably Green, who dodged round the block and came
in at the back of the constable.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder scratched his chin.</p>

<p>'Yes.' he said thoughtfully, 'ye--es.' He shifted
uncomfortably in his chair. 'Would it be considered indecorous if
I made a few inquiries, independent of the police?' he asked
nervously. 'I should not like them to think that a mere
dilettante was interfering with their lawful functions.'</p>

<p>'By all means,' said the Prosecutor heartily. 'Go down and see
the officer in charge of the case: I'll give you a note to
him&mdash;it is by no means unusual for my officer to conduct a
separate investigation, though I am afraid you will discover very
little. The ground has been well covered by Scotland Yard.'</p>

<p>'It would be permissible to see the man?' hesitated
Reeder.</p>

<p>'Green? Why, of course! I will send you up the necessary
order.'</p>

<p>The light was fading from a grey, blustering sky, and rain was
falling fitfully, when Mr. Reeder, with his furled umbrella
hooked to his arm, his coat collar turned up, stepped through the
dark gateway of Brixton Prison and was led to the cell where a
distracted man sat, his head upon his hands, his pale eyes gazing
into vacancy.</p>

<p>'It's true; it's true! Every word.' Green almost sobbed the
words.</p>

<p>A pallid man, inclined to be bald, with a limp yellow
moustache, going grey. Reeder, with his extraordinary memory for
faces, recognised him the moment he saw him, though it was some
time before the recognition was mutual.</p>

<p>'Yes, Mr. Reeder, I remember you now. You were the gentleman
who caught me before. But I've been as straight as a die. I've
never taken a farthing that didn't belong to me. What my poor
girl will think&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Are you married?' asked Mr. Reeder sympathetically.</p>

<p>'No, but I was going to be&mdash;rather late in life. She's
nearly thirty years younger than me, and the best girl that
ever&mdash;'</p>

<p>Reeder listened to the rhapsody that followed, the melancholy
deepening in his face.</p>

<p>'She hasn't been into the court, thank God, but she knows the
truth. A friend of mine told me that she has been absolutely
knocked out.'</p>

<p>'Poor soul!' Mr. Reeder shook his head.</p>

<p>'It happened on her birthday, too,' the man went on
bitterly.</p>

<p>'Did she know you were going away?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I told her the night before. I'm not going to bring her
into the case. If we'd been properly engaged it would be
different; but she's married and is divorcing her husband, but
the decree hasn't been made absolute yet. That's why I never went
about with her or saw much of her. And of course, nobody knew
about our engagement, although we lived in the same street.'</p>

<p>'Firling Avenue?' asked Reeder, and the bank manager nodded
despondently.</p>

<p>'She was married when she was seventeen to a brute. It was
pretty galling for me, having to keep quiet about it&mdash;I
mean, for nobody to know about our engagement. All sorts of
rotten people were making up to her, and I had just to grind my
teeth and say nothing. Impossible people! Why, that fool Burnett,
who arrested me, he was sweet on her; used to write her
poetry&mdash;you wouldn't think it possible in a policeman, would
you?'</p>

<p>The outrageous incongruity of a poetical policeman did not
seem to shock the detective.</p>

<p>'There is poetry in every soul, Mr. Green,' he said gently,
'and a policeman is a man.'</p>

<p>Though he dismissed the eccentricity of the constable so
lightly, the poetical policeman filled his mind all the way home
to his house in the Brockley Road, and occupied his thoughts for
the rest of his waking time.</p>

<p>It was a quarter to eight o'clock in the morning, and the
world seemed entirely populated by milkmen and whistling
newspaper boys, when Mr. J.G. Reeder came into Firling
Avenue.</p>

<p>He stopped only for a second outside the bank, which had long
since ceased to be an object of local awe and fearfulness, and
pursued his way down the broad avenue. On either side of the
thoroughfare ran a row of pretty villas&mdash;pretty although
they bore a strong family resemblance to one another; each house
with its little forecourt, sometimes laid out simply as a grass
plot, sometimes decorated with flower-beds. Green's house was the
eighteenth in the road on the right-hand side. Here he had lived
with a cook-housekeeper, and apparently gardening was not his
hobby, for the forecourt was covered with grass that had been
allowed to grow at its will.</p>

<p>Before the twenty-sixth house in the road Mr. Reeder paused
and gazed with mild interest at the blue blinds which covered
every window. Evidently Miss Magda Grayne was a lover of flowers,
for geraniums filled the window-boxes and were set at intervals
along the tiny border under the bow window. In the centre of the
grass plot was a circular flower-bed with one flowerless rose
tree, the leaves of which were drooping and brown.</p>

<p>As he raised his eyes to the upper window, the blind went up
slowly, and he was dimly conscious that there was a figure behind
the white lace curtains. Mr. Reeder walked hurriedly away, as one
caught in an immodest act, and resumed his peregrinations until
he came to the big nursery gardener's which formed the corner lot
at the far end of the road.</p>

<p>Here he stood for some time in contemplation, his arm resting
on the iron railings, his eyes staring blankly at the vista of
greenhouses. He remained in this attitude so long that one of the
nurserymen, not unnaturally thinking that a stranger was seeking
a way into the gardens, came over with the laborious gait of the
man who wrings his living from the soil, and asked if he was
wanting anybody.</p>

<p>'Several people,' sighed Mr. Reeder; 'several people!'</p>

<p>Leaving the resentful man to puzzle out his impertinence, he
slowly retraced his steps. At No. 412 he stopped again, opened
the little iron gate and passed up the path to the front door. A
small girl answered his knock and ushered him into the
parlour.</p>

<p>The room was not well furnished; it was scarcely furnished at
all. A strip of almost new linoleum covered the passage; the
furniture of the parlour itself was made up of wicker chairs, a
square of art carpet and a table. He heard the sound of feet
above his head, feet on bare boards, and then presently the door
opened and a girl came in.</p>

<p>She was pretty in a heavy way, but on her face he saw the
marks of sorrow. It was pale and haggard; the eyes looked as
though she had been recently weeping.</p>

<p>'Miss Magda Grayne?' he asked, rising as she came in.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'Are you from the police?' she asked quickly.</p>

<p>'Not exactly the police,' he corrected carefully. 'I hold
an&mdash;er&mdash;an appointment in the office of the Public
Prosecutor, which is analogous, to, but distinct from, a position
in the Metropolitan Police Force.'</p>

<p>She frowned, and then:</p>

<p>'I wondered if anybody would come to see me,' she said. 'Mr.
Green sent you?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Green told me of your existence: he did not send me.'</p>

<p>There came to her face in that second a look which almost
startled him. Only for a fleeting space of time, the expression
had dawned and passed almost before the untrained eye could
detect its passage.</p>

<p>'I was expecting somebody to come,' she said. Then: 'What made
him do it?' she asked.</p>

<p>'You think he is guilty?'</p>

<p>'The police think so.' She drew a long sigh. 'I wish to God I
had never seen this place!'</p>

<p>He did not answer; his eyes were roving round the apartment.
On a bamboo table was an old vase which had been clumsily filled
with golden chrysanthemums, of a peculiarly beautiful variety.
Not all, for amidst them flowered a large Michaelmas daisy that
had the forlorn appearance of a parvenu that had strayed by
mistake into noble company.</p>

<p>'You're fond of flowers?' he murmured.</p>

<p>She looked at the vase indifferently.</p>

<p>'Yes, I like flowers,' she said. 'The girl put them in there.'
Then: 'Do you think they will hang him?'</p>

<p>The brutality of the question, put without hesitation, pained
Reeder.</p>

<p>'It is a very serious charge,' he said. And then: 'Have you a
photograph of Mr. Green?'</p>

<p>She frowned.</p>

<p>'Yes; do you want it?'</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>She had hardly left the room before he was at the bamboo table
and had lifted out the flowers. As he had seen through the glass,
they were roughly tied with a piece of string. He examined the
ends, and here again his first observation had been correct: none
of these flowers had been cut; they had been plucked bodily from
their stalks. Beneath the string was the paper which had been
first wrapped about the stalks. It was a page torn from a
notebook; he could see the red lines, but the pencilled writing
was indecipherable.</p>

<p>As her foot sounded on the stairs, he replaced the flowers in
the vase, and when she came in he was looking through the window
into the street.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' he said, as he took the photograph from her.</p>

<p>It bore an affectionate inscription on the back.</p>

<p>'You're married, he tells me, madam?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am married, and practically divorced,' she said
shortly.</p>

<p>'Have you been living here long?'</p>

<p>'About three months,' she answered. 'It was his wish that I
should live here.'</p>

<p>He looked at the photograph again.</p>

<p>'Do you know Constable Burnett?'</p>

<p>He saw a dull flush come to her face and die away again.</p>

<p>'Yes, I know the sloppy fool!' she said viciously. And then,
realising that she had been surprised into an expression which
was not altogether ladylike, she went on, in a softer tone: 'Mr.
Burnett is rather sentimental, and I don't like sentimental
people, especially &mdash; well, you understand, Mr.&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Reeder,' murmured that gentleman.</p>

<p>'You understand, Mr. Reeder, that when a girl is engaged and
in my position, those kind of attentions are not very
welcome.'</p>

<p>Reeder was looking at her keenly. Of her sorrow and distress
there could be no doubt. On the subject of the human emotions,
and the ravages they make upon the human countenance, Mr. Reeder
was almost as great an authority as Mantegazza.</p>

<p>'On your birthday,' he said. 'How very sad! You were born on
the seventeenth of October. You are English, of course?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm English,' she said shortly. 'I was born in
Walworth&mdash;in Wallington. I once lived in Walworth.'</p>

<p>'How old are you?'</p>

<p>'Twenty-three,' she answered.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder took off his glasses and polished them on a large
silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>'The whole thing is inexpressibly sad,' he said. 'I am glad to
have had the opportunity of speaking with you, young lady. I
sympathise with you very deeply.'</p>

<p>And in this unsatisfactory way he took his departure.</p>

<p>She closed the door on him, saw him stop in the middle of the
path and pick up something from a border bed, and wondered,
frowning, why this middle-aged man had picked up the horseshoe
she had thrown through the window the night before. Into Mr.
Reeder's tail pocket went this piece of rusted steel and then he
continued his thoughtful way to the nursery gardens, for he had a
few questions to ask.</p>

<p>The men of Section 10 were parading for duty when Mr. Reeder
came timidly into the charge room and produced his credentials to
the inspector in charge.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, Mr. Reeder,' said that officer affably. 'We have had
a note from the P.P.'s office, and I think I had the pleasure of
working with you on that big slush* case a few years ago. Now
what can I do for you?...Burnett? Yes, he's here.'</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Slush&mdash;forged Bank of England
notes.]</p>

<p>He called the man's name and a young and good-looking officer
stepped from the ranks.</p>

<p>'He's the man who discovered the murder&mdash;he's marked for
promotion,' said the inspector. 'Burnett, this gentleman is from
the Public Prosecutor's office and he wants a little talk with
you. Better use my office, Mr. Reeder.'</p>

<p>The young policeman saluted and followed the shuffling figure
into the privacy of the inspector's office. He was a confident
young man: already his name and portrait had appeared in the
newspapers, the hint of promotion had become almost an
accomplished fact, and before his eyes was the prospect of a
supreme achievement.</p>

<p>'They tell me that you are something of a poet, officer,' said
Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>Burnett blushed.</p>

<p>'Why, yes, sir. I write a bit,' he confessed.</p>

<p>'Love poems, yes?' asked the other gently. 'One finds time in
the night&mdash;er&mdash;for such fancies. And there is no
inspiration like&mdash;er&mdash;love, officer.'</p>

<p>Burnett's face was crimson.</p>

<p>'I've done a bit of writing in the night, sir,' he said,
'though I've never neglected my duty.'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' murmured Mr. Reeder. 'You have a poetical mind.
It was a poetical thought to pluck flowers in the middle of the
night&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The nurseryman told me I could take any flowers I wanted,'
Burnett interrupted hastily. 'I did nothing wrong.'</p>

<p>Reeder inclined his head in agreement.</p>

<p>'That I know. You picked the flowers in the dark&mdash;by the
way, you inadvertently included a Michaelmas daisy with your
chrysanthemums&mdash;tied up your little poem to them and left
them on the doorstep with&mdash;er&mdash;a horseshoe. I wondered
what had become of that horseshoe.'</p>

<p>'I threw them up on to her&mdash;to the lady's window-sill,'
corrected the uncomfortable young man. 'As a matter of fact, the
idea didn't occur to me until I had passed the house&mdash;'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder's face was thrust forward.</p>

<p>'This is what I want to confirm,' he said softly. 'The idea of
leaving the flowers did not occur to you until you had passed her
house? The horseshoe suggested the thought? Then you went back,
picked the flowers, tied them up with the little poem you had
already written, and tossed them up to her window&mdash;we need
not mention the lady's name.'</p>

<p>Constable Burnett's face was a study.</p>

<p>'I don't know how you guessed that, but it is a fact. If I've
done anything wrong&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It is never wrong to be in love,' said Mr. J.G. Reeder
soberly. 'Love is a very beautiful experience&mdash;I have
frequently read about it.'</p>

<p>Miss Magda Grayne had dressed to go out for the afternoon and
was putting on her hat, when she saw the queer man who had called
so early that morning, walking up the tessellated path. Behind
him she recognised a detective engaged in the case. The servant
was out; nobody could be admitted except by herself. She walked
quickly behind the dressing-table into the bay of the window and
glanced up and down the road. Yes, there was the taxicab which
usually accompanies such visitations, and, standing by the
driver, another man, obviously a 'busy.'</p>

<p>She pulled up the overlay of her bed, took out the flat pad of
bank-notes that she found, and thrust them into her handbag,
then, stepping on tiptoe, she went out to the landing, into the
unfurnished back room, and, opening the window, dropped to the
flat roof of the kitchen. In another minute she was in the garden
and through the back gate. A narrow passage divided the two lines
of villas that backed on one another. She was in High Street and
had boarded a car before Mr. Reeder grew tired of knocking. To
the best of his knowledge Mr. Reeder never saw her again.</p>

<p>At the Public Prosecutor's request, he called at his chief's
house after dinner and told his surprising story.</p>

<p>'Green, who had the unusual experience of being promoted to
his position over the heads of his seniors, for special services
he rendered during the war, was undoubtedly an ex-convict, and he
spoke the truth when he said that he had received a letter from a
man who had served a period of imprisonment with him. The name of
this blackmailer is, or rather was, Arthur George Crater, whose
other name was Malling!'</p>

<p>'Not the night watchman?' said the Public Prosecutor, in
amazement.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, it was Arthur Malling. His daughter, Miss Magda
Crater, was, as she very truly said, born at Walworth on the 17th
of October, 1900. She said Wallington after, but Walworth first.
One observes that when people adopt false family names, they
seldom change their given names, and the 'Magda' was easy to
identify.</p>

<p>'Evidently Malling had planned this robbery of the bank very
carefully. He had brought his daughter, in a false name, to
Ealing, and had managed to get her introduced to Mr. Green.
Magda's job was to worm her way into Green's confidence and learn
all that she could. Possibly it was part of her duty to secure
casts of the keys. Whether Malling recognised in the manager an
old prison acquaintance, or whether he obtained the facts from
the girl, we shall never know. But when the information came to
him, he saw, in all probability, an opportunity of robbing the
bank and of throwing suspicion upon the manager.</p>

<p>The girl's role was that of a woman who was to be divorced,
and I must confess this puzzled me until I realised that in no
circumstances would Malling wish his daughter's name to be
associated with the bank manager.</p>

<p>'The night of the seventeenth was chosen for the raid.
Malling's plan to get rid of the manager had succeeded. He saw
the letter on the table in Green's private office, read it,
secured the keys&mdash;although he had in all probability a
duplicate set&mdash;and at a favourable moment cleared as much
portable money from the bank vaults as he could carry, hurried
them round to the house in Firling Avenue, where they were buried
in the central bed of the front garden, under a rose bush&mdash;I
rather imagined there was something interfering with the
nutrition of that unfortunate bush the first time I saw it. I can
only hope that the tree is not altogether dead, and I have given
instructions that it shall be replanted and well fertilised.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said the Prosecutor, who was not at all interested
in horticulture.</p>

<p>'In planting the tree, as he did in some haste, Malling
scratched his hand. Roses have thorns&mdash;I went to Ealing to
find the rose bush that had scratched his hand. Hurrying back to
the bank, he waited, knowing that Constable Burnett was due at a
certain time. He had prepared the can of chloroform, the
handcuffs and straps were waiting for him, and he stood at the
corner of the street until he saw the flash of Burnett's lamp;
then, running into the bank and leaving the door ajar, he
strapped himself, fastened the handcuffs and lay down, expecting
that the policeman would arrive, find the open door and rescue
him before much harm was done.</p>

<p>'But Constable Burnett had had some pleasant exchanges with
the daughter. Doubtless she had received instructions from her
father to be as pleasant to him as possible. Burnett was a
poetical young man, knew it was her birthday, and as he walked
along the street his foot struck an old horseshoe and the idea
occurred to him that he should return, attach the horseshoe to
some flowers, which the nurseryman had given him permission to
pick, and leave his little bouquet, to so speak, at his lady's
feet&mdash;a poetical idea, and one worthy of the finest
traditions of the Metropolitan Police Force. This he did, but it
took some time; and all the while this young man was
philandering&mdash;Arthur Crater was dying!</p>

<p>In a few seconds after lying down he must have passed from
consciousness...the chloroform still dripped, and when the
policeman eventually reached the bank, ten minutes after he was
due, the man was dead!'</p>

<p>The Public Prosecutor sat back in his padded chair and frowned
at his new subordinate.</p>

<p>'How on earth did you piece together all this?' he asked in
wonder.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"I have that perversion," he said. 'It is a terrible
misfortune, but it is true. I see evil in everything...in dying
rose bushes, in horseshoes &mdash; in poetry even. I have the
mind of a criminal. It is deplorable!'</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02">II. &mdash; THE TREASURE
HUNT</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Flynn's</i>, 22 November 1924</h3>

<p class="first">THERE is a tradition in criminal circles that
even the humblest of detective officers is a man of wealth and
substance, and that his secret hoard was secured by thieving,
bribery and blackmail. It is the gossip of the fields, the
quarries, the tailor's shop, the laundry and the bakehouse of
fifty county prisons and three convict establishments, that all
highly placed detectives have by nefarious means laid up for
themselves sufficient earthly treasures to make work a hobby and
their official pittance the most inconsiderable portion of their
incomes.</p>

<p>Since Mr. J.G. Reeder had for over twenty years dealt
exclusively with bank robbers and forgers, who are the
aristocrats and capitalists of the underworld, legend credited
him with country houses and immense secret reserves. Not that he
would have a great deal of money in the bank. It was admitted
that he was too clever to risk discovery by the authorities. No,
it was hidden somewhere: it was the pet dream of hundreds of
unlawful men that they would some day discover the hoard and live
happily ever after. The one satisfactory aspect of his affluence
(they all agreed) was that, being an old man&mdash;he was over
50&mdash;he couldn't take his money with him, for gold melts at a
certain temperature and gilt-edged stock is seldom printed on
asbestos paper.</p>

<p>The Director of Public Prosecutions was lunching one Saturday
at his club with a judge of the King's Bench&mdash;Saturday being
one of the two days in the week when a judge gets properly fed.
And the conversation drifted to a certain Mr. J.G. Reeder, the
chief of the Director's sleuths.</p>

<p>'He's capable,' he confessed reluctantly, 'but I hate his hat.
It is the sort that So-and-so used to wear,' he mentioned by name
an eminent politician; 'and I loathe his black frock-coat, people
who see him coming into the office think he's a coroner's
officer, but he's capable. His side-whiskers are an abomination,
and I have a feeling that, if I talked rough to him, he would
burst into tears&mdash;a gentle soul. Almost too gentle for my
kind of work. He apologises to the messenger every time he rings
for him!'</p>

<p>The judge, who knew something about humanity, answered with a
frosty smile.</p>

<p>'He sounds rather like a potential murderer to me,' he said
cynically.</p>

<p>Milord, in his extravagance, he did Mr. J.G. Reeder an
injustice, for Mr. Reeder was capable of breaking the
law&mdash;quite.At the same time there were many people who
formed an altogether wrong conception of J.G.'s harmlessness as
an individual. And one of these was a certain Lew Kohl, who mixed
bank-note printing with elementary burglary.</p>

<p>Threatened men live long, a trite saying but, like most things
trite, true. In a score of cases, when Mr. J.G. Reeder had
descended from the witness stand, he had met the baleful eye of
the man in the dock and had listened with mild interest to divers
promises as to what would happen to him in the near or the remote
future. For he was a great authority on forged bank-notes and he
had sent many men to penal servitude.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder, that inoffensive man, had seen prisoners foaming
at the mouth in their rage, he had seen them white and livid, he
had heard their howling execrations and he had met these men
after their release from prison and had found them amiable souls
half ashamed and half amused at their nearly forgotten outbursts
and horrific threats.</p>

<p>But when, in the early part of 1914, Lew Kohl was sentenced
for ten years, he neither screamed his imprecations nor
registered a vow to tear Mr. Reeder's heart, lungs and important
organs from his frail body.</p>

<p>Lew just smiled and his eyes caught the detective's for the
space of a second&mdash;the forger's eyes were pale blue and
speculative, and they held neither hate nor fury. Instead, they
said in so many words:</p>

<p>'At the first opportunity I will kill you.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder read the message and sighed heavily, for he
disliked fuss of all kinds, and resented, in so far as he could
resent anything, the injustice of being made personally
responsible for the performance of a public duty.</p>

<p>Many years had passed, and considerable changes had occurred
in Mr. Reeder's fortune. He had transferred from the specialised
occupation of detecting the makers of forged bank-notes to the
more general practice of the Public Prosecutor's bureau, but he
never forgot Lew's smile.</p>

<p>The work in Whitehall was not heavy and it was very
interesting. To Mr. Reeder came most of the anonymous letters
which the Director received in shoals. In the main they were
self-explanatory, and it required no particular intelligence to
discover their motive. Jealousy, malice, plain mischief-making,
and occasionally a sordid desire to benefit financially by the
information which was conveyed, were behind the majority. But
occasionally:</p>

<p>'Sir James is going to marry his cousin, and it's not three
months since his poor wife fell overboard from the Channel
steamer crossing to Calais. There's something very fishy about
this business. Miss Margaret doesn't like him, for she knows he's
after her money. Why was I sent away to London that night? He
doesn't like driving in the dark, either. It's strange that he
wanted to drive that night when it was raining like blazes.'</p>

<p>This particular letter was signed 'A Friend.' Justice has many
such friends.</p>

<p>'Sir James' was Sir James Tithermite, who had been a director
of some new public department during the war and had received a
baronetcy for his services.</p>

<p>'Look it up,' said the Director when he saw the letter. 'I
seem to remember that Lady Tithermite was drowned at sea.'</p>

<p>'On the nineteenth of December last year,' said Mr. Reeder
solemnly. 'She and Sir James were going to Monte Carlo, breaking
their journey in Paris. Sir James, who has a house near
Maidstone, drove to Dover, garaging the car at the Lord Wilson
Hotel. The night was stormy and the ship had a rough
crossing&mdash;they were half-way across when Sir James came to
the purser and said that he had missed his wife. Her baggage was
in the cabin, her passport, rail ticket and hat, but the lady was
not found, indeed was never seen again.'</p>

<p>The Director nodded.</p>

<p>'I see, you've read up the case.'</p>

<p>'I remember it,' said Mr. Reeder. 'The case is a favourite
speculation of mine. Unfortunately I see evil in everything and I
have often thought how easy&mdash;but I fear that I take a warped
view of life. It is a horrible handicap to possess a criminal
mind.'</p>

<p>The Director looked at him suspiciously. He was never quite
sure whether Mr. Reeder was serious. At that moment, his sobriety
was beyond challenge.</p>

<p>'A discharged chauffeur wrote that letter, of course,' he
began.</p>

<p>'Thomas Dayford, of 179, Barrack Street, Maidstone,' concluded
Mr. Reeder. 'He is at present in the employ of the Kent Motor-Bus
Company, and has three children, two of whom are twins and bonny
little rascals.'</p>

<p>The Chief laughed helplessly.</p>

<p>"I'll take it that you know!" he said. 'See what there is
behind the letter. Sir James is a big fellow in Kent, a Justice
of the Peace, and he has powerful political influences. There is
nothing in this letter, of course. Go warily, Reeder&mdash;if any
kick comes back to this office, it goes on to
you&mdash;intensified!'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder's idea of walking warily was peculiarly his own. He
travelled down to Maidstone the next morning, and, finding a bus
that passed the lodge gates of Elfreda Manor, he journeyed
comfortably and economically, his umbrella between his knees. He
passed through the lodge gates, up a long and winding avenue of
poplars, and presently came within sight of the grey manor
house.</p>

<p>In a deep chair on the lawn he saw a girl sitting, a book on
her knees, and evidently she saw him, for she rose as he crossed
the lawn and came towards him eagerly.</p>

<p>'I'm Miss Margaret Letherby&mdash;are you from&mdash;?' She
mentioned the name of a well-known firm of lawyers, and her face
fell when Mr. Reeder regretfully disclaimed connection with those
legal lights.</p>

<p>She was as pretty as a perfect complexion and a round, not too
intellectual, face could, in combination, make her.</p>

<p>'I thought&mdash;do you wish to see Sir James? He is in the
library. If you ring, one of the maids will take you to him.'</p>

<p>Had Mr. Reeder been the sort of man who could be puzzled by
anything, he would have been puzzled by the suggestion that any
girl with money of her own should marry a man much older than
herself against her own wishes. There was little mystery in the
matter now. Miss Margaret would have married any strong-willed
man who insisted.</p>

<p>'Even me,' said Mr. Reeder to himself, with a certain
melancholy pleasure.</p>

<p>There was no need to ring the bell. A tall, broad man in a
golfing suit stood in the door-way. His fair hair was long and
hung over his forehead in a thick flat strand; a heavy tawny
moustache hid his mouth and swept down over a chin that was long
and powerful.</p>

<p>'Well?' he asked aggressively.</p>

<p>'I'm from the Public Prosecutor's office,' murmured Mr.
Reeder. 'I have had an anonymous letter.'</p>

<p>His pale eyes did not leave the face of the other man.</p>

<p>'Come in,' said Sir James gruffly. As he closed the door he
glanced quickly first to the girl and then to the poplar avenue.
'I'm expecting a fool of a lawyer,' he said, as he flung open the
door of what was evidently the library.</p>

<p>His voice was steady; not by a flicker of eyelash had he
betrayed the slightest degree of anxiety when Reeder had told his
mission.</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;what about this anonymous letter? You don't take
much notice of that kind of trash, do you?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder deposited his umbrella and flat-crowned hat on a
chair before he took a document from his pocket and handed it to
the baronet, who frowned as he read. Was it Mr. Reeder's vivid
imagination, or did the hard light in the eyes of Sir James
soften as he read?</p>

<p>'This is a cock and bull story of somebody having seen my
wife's jewellery on sale in Paris,' he said. 'There is nothing in
it. I can account for every one of my poor wife's trinkets. I
brought back the jewel case after that awful night. I don't
recognise the handwriting: who is the lying scoundrel who wrote
this?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder had never before been called a lying scoundrel, but
he accepted the experience with admirable meekness.</p>

<p>"I thought it untrue,' he said, shaking his head. 'I followed
the details of the case very thoroughly. You left here in the
afternoon&mdash;'</p>

<p>'At night,' said the other brusquely. He was not inclined to
discuss the matter, but Mr. Reeder's appealing look was
irresistible. 'It is only eighty minutes' run to Dover. We got to
the pier at eleven o'clock, about the same time as the boat
train, and we went on board at once. I got my cabin key from the
purser and put her ladyship and her baggage inside.'</p>

<p>'Her ladyship was a good sailor?'</p>

<p>'Yes, a very good sailor; she was remarkably well that night.
I left her in the cabin dozing, and went for a stroll on the
deck&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Raining very heavily and a strong sea running,' nodded
Reeder, as though in agreement with something the other man had
said.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;I'm a pretty good sailor&mdash;anyway, that story
about my poor wife's jewels is utter nonsense. You can tell the
Director that, with my compliments.'</p>

<p>He opened the door for his visitor, and Mr. Reeder was some
time replacing the letter and gathering his belongings.</p>

<p>'You have a beautiful place here. Sir James&mdash;a lovely
place. An extensive estate?'</p>

<p>'Three thousand acres.' This time he did not attempt to
disguise his impatience. 'Good afternoon.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder went slowly down the drive, his remarkable memory
at work.</p>

<p>He missed the bus which he could easily have caught, and
pursued an apparently aimless way along the winding road which
marched with the boundaries of the baronet's property. A walk of
a quarter of a mile brought him to a lane shooting off at right
angles from the main road, and marking, he guessed, the southern
boundary. At the corner stood an old stone lodge, on the inside
of a forbidding iron gate. The lodge was in a pitiable state of
neglect and disrepair. Tiles had been dislodged from the roof,
the windows were grimy or broken, and the little garden was
overrun with docks and thistles. Beyond the gate was a narrow,
weed-covered drive that trailed out of sight into a distant
plantation.</p>

<p>Hearing the clang of a letter-box closing, he turned to see a
postman mounting his bicycle.</p>

<p>'What place is this?' asked Mr. Reeder, arresting the
postman's departure.</p>

<p>'South Lodge&mdash;Sir James Tithermite's property. It's never
used now. Hasn't been used for years&mdash;I don't know why; it's
a short cut if they happen to be coming this way.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder walked with him towards the village, and he was a
skilful pumper of wells, however dry; and the postman was not dry
by any means.</p>

<p>'Yes, poor lady! She was very frail&mdash;one of those sort of
invalids that last out many a healthy man.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder put a question at random and scored most
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>'Yes, her ladyship was a bad sailor. I know because every time
she went abroad she used to get a bottle of that stuff people
take for sea-sickness. I've delivered many a bottle till Raikes
the chemist stocked it&mdash;"Pickers' Travellers' Friend,"
that's what it was called. Mr. Raikes was only saying to me the
other day that he'd got half a dozen bottles on hand and he
didn't know what to do with them. Nobody in Climbury ever goes to
sea.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder went on to the village and idled his precious time
in most unlikely places. At the chemist's, at the blacksmith's
shop, at the modest building yard. He caught the last bus back to
Maidstone, and by great good luck the last train to London.</p>

<p>And, in his vague way, he answered the Director's query the
next day with:</p>

<p>'Yes, I saw Sir James: a very interesting man.'</p>

<p>This was on the Friday. All day Saturday he was busy. The
Sabbath brought him a new interest.</p>

<p>On this bright Sunday morning, Mr. Reeder, attired in a
flowered dressing-gown, his feet encased in black velvet
slippers, stood at the window of his house in Brockley Road and
surveyed the deserted thoroughfare. The bell of a local church,
which was accounted high, had rung for early Mass, and there was
nothing living in sight except a black cat that lay asleep in a
patch of sunlight on the top step of the house opposite. The hour
was 7.30, and Mr. Reeder had been at his desk since six, working
by artificial light, the month being March towards the close.</p>

<p>From the half-moon of the window bay he regarded a section of
the Lewisham High Road and as much of Tanners Hill as can be seen
before it dips past the railway bridge into sheer Deptford.</p>

<p>Returning to his table, he opened a carton of the cheapest
cigarettes and, lighting one, puffed in an amateurish fashion. He
smoked cigarettes rather like a woman who detests them but feels
that it is the correct thing to do.</p>

<p>'Dear me,' said Mr. Reeder feebly.</p>

<p>He was back at the window, and he had seen a man turn out of
Lewisham High Road. He had crossed the road and was coming
straight to Daffodil House&mdash;which frolicsome name appeared
on the door-posts of Mr. Reeder's residence. A tall, straight
man, with a sombre brown face, he came to the front gate, passed
through and beyond the watcher's range of vision.</p>

<p>'Dear me!' said Mr. Reeder, as he heard the tinkle of a
bell.</p>

<p>A few minutes later his housekeeper tapped on the door.</p>

<p>'Will you see Mr. Kohl, sir?' she asked.</p>

<p>Mr. J.G. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>Lew Kohl walked into the room to find a middle-aged man in a
flamboyant dressing-gown sitting at his desk, a pair of pince-nez
set crookedly on his nose.</p>

<p>'Good morning. Kohl.'</p>

<p>Lew Kohl looked at the man who had sent him to seven and a
half years of hell, and the corner of his thin lips curled.</p>

<p>'Morning, Mr. Reeder.' His eyes flashed across the almost bare
surface of the writing-desk on which Reeder's hands were lightly
clasped. 'You didn't expect to see me, I guess?'</p>

<p>'Not so early,' said Reeder in his hushed voice, 'but I should
have remembered that early rising is one of the good habits which
are inculcated by penal servitude.'</p>

<p>He said this in the manner of one bestowing praise for good
conduct.</p>

<p>'I suppose you've got a pretty good idea of why I have come,
eh? I'm a bad forgetter, Reeder, and a man in Dartmoor has time
to think.'</p>

<p>The older man lifted his sandy eyebrows, the steel-rimmed
glasses on his nose slipped further askew.</p>

<p>'That phrase seems familiar,' he said, and the eyebrows
lowered in a frown. 'Now let me think&mdash;it was in a
melodrama, of course, but was it "Souls in Harness" or "The
Marriage Vow"?'</p>

<p>He appeared genuinely anxious for assistance in solving this
problem.</p>

<p>'This is going to be a different kind of play,' said the long-faced Lew through his teeth. 'I'm going to get you,
Reeder&mdash;you can go along and tell your boss, the Public
Prosecutor. But I'll get you sweet! There will be no evidence to
swing me. And I'll get that nice little stocking of yours,
Reeder!'</p>

<p>The legend of Reeder's fortune was accepted even by so
intelligent a man as Kohl.</p>

<p>'You'll get my stocking! Dear me, I shall have to go
barefooted,' said Mr. Reeder, with a faint show of humour.</p>

<p>'You know what I mean&mdash;think that over. Some hour and day
you'll go out, and all Scotland Yard won't catch me for the
killing! I've thought it out&mdash;'</p>

<p>'One has time to think in Dartmoor,' murmured Mr. J.G. Reeder
encouragingly. 'You're becoming one of the world's thinkers,
Kohl. Do you know Rodin's masterpiece&mdash;a beautiful statue
throbbing with life&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That's all.' Lew Kohl rose, the smile still trembling at the
corner of his mouth. 'Maybe you'll turn this over in your mind,
and in a day or two you won't be feeling so gay.'</p>

<p>Reeder's face was pathetic in its sadness. His untidy sandy-grey hair seemed to be standing on end; the large ears, that
stood out at right angles to his face, gave the illusion of
quivering movement.</p>

<p>Lew Kohl's hand was on the door-knob.</p>

<p>'Womp!'</p>

<p>It was the sound of a dull weight striking a board; something
winged past his cheek, before his eyes a deep hole showed in the
wall, and his face was stung by flying grains of plaster. He spun
round with a whine of rage.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder had a long-barrelled Browning in his hand, with a
barrel-shaped silencer over the muzzle, and he was staring at the
weapon open-mouthed.</p>

<p>'Now how on earth did that happen?' he asked in wonder.</p>

<p>Lew Kohl stood trembling with rage and fear, his face yellow-white.</p>

<p>'You&mdash;you swine!' he breathed. 'You tried to shoot
me!'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder stared at him over his glasses.</p>

<p>'Good gracious&mdash;you think that? Still thinking of killing
me, Kohl?'</p>

<p>Kohl tried to speak but found no words, and, flinging open the
door, he strode down the stairs and through the front entrance.
His foot was on the first step when something came hurtling past
him and crashed to fragments at his feet. It was a large stone
vase that had decorated the window-sill of Mr. Reeder's bedroom.
Leaping over the debris of stone and flower mould, he glared up
into the surprised face of Mr. J.G. Reeder.</p>

<p>'I'll get you!' he spluttered.</p>

<p>'I hope you're not hurt?' asked the man at the window in a
tone of concern. 'These things happen. Some day and some
hour&mdash;'</p>

<p>As Lew Kohl strode down the street, the detective was still
talking.</p>

<p>Mr. Stan Bride was at his morning ablutions when his friend
and sometime prison associate came into the little room that
overlooked Fitzroy Square.</p>

<p>Stan Bride, who bore no resemblance to anything virginal,
being a stout and stumpy man with a huge, red face and many
chins, stopped in the act of drying himself and gazed over the
edge of the towel.</p>

<p>'What's the matter with you?' he asked sharply. 'You look as
if you'd been chased by a busy. What did you go out so early
for?'</p>

<p>Lew told him, and the jovial countenance of his room-mate grew
longer and longer&mdash;</p>

<p>'You poor fish!' he hissed. 'To go after Reeder with that
stuff! Don't you think he was waiting for you? Do you suppose he
didn't know the very moment you left the Moor?'</p>

<p>'I've scared him, anyway,' said the other, and Mr. Bride
laughed.</p>

<p>'Good scout!' he sneered. 'Scare that old person!' (He did not
say 'person.') 'If he's as white as you, he is scared! But he's
not. Of course he shot past you&mdash;if he'd wanted to shoot
you, you'd have been stiff by now. But he didn't. Thinker,
eh&mdash;he's given you somep'n' to think about.'</p>

<p>'Where that gun came from I don't&mdash;'</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and the two men exchanged
glances.</p>

<p>'Who's there?' asked Bride, and a familiar voice answered.</p>

<p>'It's that busy from the Yard,' whispered Bride, and opened
the door.</p>

<p>The 'busy' was Sergeant Allford, C.I.D., an affable and portly
man and a detective of some promise.</p>

<p>'Morning, boys&mdash;not been to church, Stan?'</p>

<p>Stan grinned politely.</p>

<p>'How's trade, Lew?'</p>

<p>'Not so bad.' The forger was alert, suspicious.</p>

<p>'Come to see you about a gun&mdash;got an idea you're carrying
one. Lew-Colt automatic R.7/94318. That's not right. Lew-guns
don't belong to this country.'</p>

<p>'I've got no gun,' said Lew sullenly.</p>

<p>Bride had suddenly become an old man, for he also was a
convict on licence, and the discovery might send him back to
serve his unfinished sentence.</p>

<p>'Will you come a little walk to the station, or will you let
me go over you?'</p>

<p>'Go over me,' said Lew, and put out his arms stiffly whilst
the detective rubbed him down.</p>

<p>'I'll have a look round,' said the detective, and his 'look
round' was very thorough.</p>

<p>'Must have been mistaken,' said Sergeant Allford. And then,
suddenly: 'Was that what you chucked into the river as you were
walking along the Embankment?'</p>

<p>Lew started. It was the first intimation he had received that
he had been 'tailed' that morning.</p>

<p>Bride waited till the detective was visible from the window
crossing Fitzroy Square; then he turned in a fury on his
companion.</p>

<p>'Clever, ain't you! That old hound knew you had a
gun&mdash;knew the number. And if Allford had found it you'd have
been "dragged" and me too!'</p>

<p>'I threw it in the river,' said Lew sulkily.</p>

<p>'Brains&mdash;not many but some!' said Bride, breathing
heavily. 'You cut out Reeder&mdash;he's hell and poison, and if
you don't know it you're deaf! Scared him? You big stiff! He'd
cut your throat and write a hymn about it.'</p>

<p>'I didn't know they were tailing me,' growled Kohl; 'but I'll
get him! And his money too.'</p>

<p>'Get him from another lodging,' said Bride curtly. 'A crook I
don't mind, being one; a murderer I don't mind, but a talking
jackass makes me sick. Get his stuff if you can&mdash;I'll bet
it's all invested in real estate, and you can't lift
houses&mdash;but don't talk about it. I like you, Lew, up to a
point; you're miles before the point and out of sight. I don't
like Reeder&mdash;I don't like snakes, but I keep away from the
Zoo.'</p>

<p>So Lew Kohl went into new diggings on the top floor of an
Italian's house in Dean Street, and here he had leisure and
inclination to brood upon his grievances and to plan afresh the
destruction of his enemy. And new plans were needed, for the
schemes which had seemed so watertight in the quietude of a
Devonshire cell showed daylight through many crevices.</p>

<p>Lew's homicidal urge had undergone considerable modification.
He had been experimented upon by a very clever
psychologist&mdash;though he never regarded Mr. Reeder in this
light, and, indeed, had the vaguest idea as to what the word
meant. But there were other ways of hurting Reeder, and his mind
fell constantly back to the dream of discovering this peccant
detective's hidden treasure.</p>

<p>It was nearly a week later that Mr. Reeder invited himself
into the Director's private sanctum, and that great official
listened spellbound while his subordinate offered his outrageous
theory about Sir James Tithermite and his dead wife. When Mr.
Reeder had finished, the Director pushed back his chair from the
table.</p>

<p>'My dear man,' he said, a little irritably, 'I can't possibly
give a warrant on the strength of your surmises&mdash;not even a
search warrant. The story is so fantastic, so incredible, that it
would be more at home in the pages of a sensational story than in
a Public Prosecutor's report.'</p>

<p>'It was a wild night, and yet Lady Tithermite was not ill,'
suggested the detective gently. 'That is a fact to remember,
sir.'</p>

<p>The Director shook his head.</p>

<p>'I can't do it&mdash;not on the evidence,' he said. 'I should
raise a storm that'd swing me into Whitehall. Can't you do
anything&mdash;unofficially?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder shook his head.</p>

<p>'My presence in the neighbourhood has been remarked,' he said
primly. 'I think it would be impossible to&mdash;er&mdash;cover
up my traces. And yet I have located the place, and could tell
you within a few inches&mdash;'</p>

<p>Again the Director shook his head.</p>

<p>'No, Reeder,' he said quietly, 'the whole thing is sheer
deduction on your part. Oh, yes, I know you have a criminal
mind&mdash;I think you have told me that before. And that is a
good reason why I should not issue a warrant. You're simply
crediting this unfortunate man with your ingenuity. Nothing
doing!'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder sighed and went back to his bureau, not entirely
despondent, for there had intruded a new element into his
investigations.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder had been to Maidstone several times during the
week, and he had not gone alone; though seemingly unconscious of
the fact that he had developed a shadow, for he had seen Lew Kohl
on several occasions, and had spent an uncomfortable few minutes
wondering whether his experiment had failed.</p>

<p>On the second occasion an idea had developed in the
detective's mind, and if he were a laughing man he would have
chuckled aloud when he slipped out of Maidstone station one
evening and, in the act of hiring a cab, had seen Lew Kohl
negotiating for another.</p>

<p>Mr. Bride was engaged in the tedious but necessary practice of
so cutting a pack of cards that the ace of diamonds remained at
the bottom, when his former co-lodger burst in upon him, and
there was a light of triumph in Lew's cold eye which brought Mr.
Bride's heart to his boots.</p>

<p>'I've got him!' said Lew.</p>

<p>Bride put aside the cards and stood up.</p>

<p>'Got who?' he asked coldly. 'And if it's killing, you needn't
answer, but get out!'</p>

<p>'There's no killing.'</p>

<p>Lew sat down squarely at the table, his hands in his pockets,
a real smile on his face.</p>

<p>'I've been trailing Reeder for a week, and that fellow wants
some trailing!'</p>

<p>'Well?' asked the other, when he paused dramatically.</p>

<p>'I've found his stocking!'</p>

<p>Bride scratched his chin, and was half convinced.</p>

<p>'You never have?'</p>

<p>Lew nodded.</p>

<p>'He's been going to Maidstone a lot lately, and driving to a
little village about five miles out. There I always lost him. But
the other night, when he came back to the station to catch the
last train, he slipped into the waiting-room and I found a place
where I could watch him. What do you think he did?'</p>

<p>Mr. Bride hazarded no suggestion.</p>

<p>'He opened his bag,' said Lew impressively, 'and took out a
wad of notes as thick as that! He'd been drawing on his bank! I
trailed him up to London. There's a restaurant on the station and
he went in to get a cup of coffee, with me keeping well out of
his sight. As he came out of the restaurant he took out his
handkerchief and wiped his mouth. He didn't see the little book
that dropped, but I did. I was scared sick that somebody else
would see it, or that he'd wait long enough to find it himself.
But he went out of the station and I got that book before you
could say "knife." Look!'</p>

<p>It was a well-worn little notebook, covered with faded red
morocco. Bride put out his hand to take it.</p>

<p>'Wait a bit,' said Lew. 'Are you in this with me fifty-fifty,
because I want some help?'</p>

<p>Bride hesitated.</p>

<p>'If it's just plain thieving, I'm with you,' he said.</p>

<p>'Plain thieving&mdash;and sweet,' said Lew exultantly, and
pushed the book across the table.</p>

<p>For the greater part of the night they sat together talking in
low tones, discussing impartially the methodical book-keeping of
Mr. J.G. Reeder and his exceeding dishonesty.</p>

<p>The Monday night was wet. A storm blew up from the south-west,
and the air was filled with falling leaves as Lew and his
companion footed the five miles which separated them from the
village. Neither carried any impedimenta that was visible, yet
under Lew's waterproof coat was a kit of tools of singular
ingenuity, and Mr. Bride's coat pockets were weighted down with
the sections of a powerful jemmy.</p>

<p>They met nobody in their walk, and the church bell was
striking eleven when Lew gripped the bars of the South Lodge
gates, pulled himself up to the top and dropped lightly on the
other side. He was followed by Mr. Bride, who, in spite of his
bulk, was a singularly agile man. The ruined lodge showed in the
darkness, and they passed through the creaking gates to the door
and Lew flashed his lantern upon the keyhole before he began
manipulation with the implements which he had taken from his
kit.</p>

<p>The door was opened in ten minutes and a few seconds later
they stood in a low-roofed little room, the principal feature of
which was a deep, grateless fire-place. Lew took off his
mackintosh and stretched it over the window before he spread the
light in his lamp, and, kneeling down, brushed the debris from
the hearth, examining the joints of the big stone carefully.</p>

<p>'This work's been botched,' he said. 'Anybody could see
that.'</p>

<p>He put the claw of the jemmy into a crack and levered up the
stone, and it moved slightly. Stopping only to dig a deeper
crevice with a chisel and hammer he thrust the claw of the jemmy
farther down. The stone came up above the edge of the floor and
Bride slipped the chisel underneath.</p>

<p>'Now together,' grunted Lew.</p>

<p>They got their fingers beneath the hearth-stone and with one
heave hinged it up. Lew picked up the lamp and, kneeling down,
flashed a light into the dark cavity. And then:</p>

<p>'Oh, my God!' he shrieked.</p>

<p>A second later two terrified men rushed from the house into
the drive. And a miracle had happened, for the gates were open
and a dark figure stood squarely before them.</p>

<p>'Put up your hands, Kohl!' said a voice, and hateful as it was
to Lew Kohl, he could have fallen on the neck of Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>At twelve o'clock that night Sir James Tithermite was
discussing matters with his bride-to-be: the stupidity of her
lawyer, who wished to safeguard her fortune, and his own
cleverness and foresight in securing complete freedom of action
for the girl who was to be his wife.</p>

<p>'These blackguards think of nothing but their fees,' he began,
when his footman came in unannounced, and behind him the Chief
Constable of the county and a man he remembered seeing
before.</p>

<p>'Sir James Tithermite?' said the Chief Constable
unnecessarily, for he knew Sir James very well.</p>

<p>'Yes, Colonel, what is it?' asked the baronet, his face
twitching.</p>

<p>'I am taking you into custody on a charge of wilfully
murdering your wife, Eleanor Mary Tithermite.'</p>

<p>'The whole thing turned upon the question as to whether Lady
Tithermite was a good or a bad sailor,' explained J.G. Reeder to
his chief. 'If she were a bad sailor, it was unlikely that she
would be on the ship, even for five minutes, without calling for
the stewardess. The stewardess did not see her ladyship, nor did
anybody on board, for the simple reason that she was not on
board! She was murdered within the grounds of the Manor; her body
was buried beneath the hearthstone of the old lodge, and Sir
James continued his journey by car to Dover, handing over his
packages to a porter and telling him to take them to his cabin
before he returned to put the car into the hotel garage. He had
timed his arrival so that he passed on board with a crowd of
passengers from the boat train, and nobody knew whether he was
alone or whether he was accompanied, and, for the matter of that,
nobody cared. The purser gave him his key, and he put the
baggage, including his wife's hat, into the cabin, paid the
porter and dismissed him. Officially, Lady Tithermite was on
board, for he surrendered her ticket to the collector and
received her landing voucher. And then he discovered she had
disappeared. The ship was searched, but of course the unfortunate
lady was not found. As I remarked before&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You have a criminal mind,' said the Director good-humouredly.
'Go on, Reeder.'</p>

<p>'Having this queer and objectionable trait, I saw how very
simple a matter it was to give the illusion that the lady was on
board, and I decided that, if the murder was committed, it must
have been within a few miles of the house. And then the local
builder told me that he had given Sir James a little lesson in
the art of mixing mortar. And the local blacksmith told me that
the gate had been damaged, presumably by Sir James's car&mdash;I
had seen the broken rods and all I wanted to know was when the
repairs were effected. That she was beneath the hearth in the
lodge I was certain. Without a search warrant it was impossible
to prove or disprove my theory, and I myself could not conduct a
private investigation without risking the reputation of our
department&mdash;if I may say "our,"' he said apologetically.</p>

<p>The Director was thoughtful.</p>

<p>'Of course, you induced this man Kohl to dig up the hearth by
pretending you had money buried there. I presume you revealed
that fact in your notebook? But why on earth did he imagine that
you had a hidden treasure?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder smiled sadly.</p>

<p>'The criminal mind is a peculiar thing,' he said, with a sigh.
'It harbours illusions and fairy stories. Fortunately, I
understand that mind. As I have often said &mdash; '</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03">III. &mdash; THE TROUPE</a></h2>

<h3>First published as "A Place on the River" in <i>Flynn's</i>, 6 December 1924<br>
<br>
Reprinted as "The Troupe" in <i>The Grand Magazine</i>,
January 1925</h3>

<p class="first">THERE was a quietude and sedateness about the
Public Prosecutor's office which completely harmonised with the
tastes and inclinations of Mr. J.G. Reeder. For he was a
gentleman who liked to work in an office where the ticking of a
clock was audible and the turning of a paper produced a gentle
disturbance.</p>

<p>He had before him one morning the typewritten catalogue of
Messrs. Willoby, the eminent estate agents, and he was turning
the leaves with a thoughtful expression. The catalogue was newly
arrived, a messenger having only a few minutes before placed the
portfolio on his desk.</p>

<p>Presently he smoothed down a leaf and read again the
flattering description of a fairly unimportant property, and his
scrutiny was patently a waste of time, for, scrawled on the
margin of the sheet in red ink was the word 'Let,' which meant
that 'Riverside Bower' was not available for hire. The ink was
smudged, and 'Let' had been obviously written that morning.</p>

<p>'Humph!' said Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>He was interested for many reasons. In the heat of July
riverside houses are at a premium: at the beginning of November
they are somewhat of a drug on the market. And transatlantic
visitors do not as a rule hire riverside cottages in a month
which is chiefly distinguished by mists, rain and general
discomfort.</p>

<p>Two reception: two bedrooms: bath, large dry cellars, lawn to
river, small skiff and punt. Gas and electric light. Three
guineas weekly or would be let for six months at 2 guineas.</p>

<p>He pulled his table telephone towards him and gave the agents'
number.</p>

<p>'Let, is it&mdash;dear me! To an American gentleman? When will
it be available?'</p>

<p>The new tenant had taken the house for a month. Mr. Reeder was
even more intrigued, though his interest in the 'American
gentleman' was not quite as intensive as the American gentleman's
interest in Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>When the great Art Lomer came on a business trip from Canada
to London, a friend and admirer carried him off one day to see
the principal sight of London.</p>

<p>'He generally comes out at lunch time,' said the friend, who
was called 'Cheep,' because his name was Sparrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Lomer looked up and down Whitehall disparagingly, for he
had seen so many cities of the world that none seemed as good as
the others.</p>

<p>'There he is!' whispered Cheep, though there was no need for
mystery or confidence.</p>

<p>A middle-aged man had come out of one of the narrow doorways
of a large grey building. On his head was a high, flat-crowned
hat, his body was tightly encased in a black frock coat. A
weakish man with yellowy-white side-whiskers and eyeglasses, that
were nearer to the end than the beginning of his nose.</p>

<p>'Him?' demanded the amazed Art.</p>

<p>'Him,' said the other, incorrectly but with emphasis.</p>

<p>'Is that the kind of guy you're scared about? You're crazy.
Why, that man couldn't catch a cold! Now, back home in
T'ronto&mdash;'</p>

<p>Art was proud of his home town, and in that spirit of
expansiveness which paints even the unpleasant features of One's
Own with the most attractive hues, he had even a good word to say
about the Royal Canadian Police&mdash;a force which normally, and
in a local atmosphere, he held in the greatest detestation.</p>

<p>Art 'operated'&mdash;he never employed a baser word&mdash;from
Toronto, which, by its proximity to Buffalo and the United States
border, gave him certain advantages. He had once 'operated' in
Canada itself, but his line at that period being robbery of a
kind which is necessarily accompanied by assault, he had found
himself facing a Canadian magistrate, and a Canadian magistrate
wields extraordinary powers. Art had been sent down for five
years and, crowning horror, was ordered to receive twenty-five
lashes with a whip which has nine tails, each one of which hurts.
Thereafter he cut out violence and confined himself to the
formation of his troupe&mdash;and Art Lomer's troupe was famous
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>

<p>He had been plain Arthur Lomer when he was rescued from a
London gutter and a career of crime and sent to Canada, the
charitable authorities being under the impression that Canada was
rather short on juvenile criminals. By dint of great artfulness,
good stage management and a natural aptitude for acquiring easy
money, he had gained for himself a bungalow on the islands, a
flat in Church Street, a six-cylinder car and a New England
accent which would pass muster in almost any place except New
England.</p>

<p>'I'll tell the world you fellows want waking up! So that's
your Reeder? Well, if Canada and the United States was full of
goats like him, I'd pack more dollars in one month than Hollywood
pays Chaplin in ten years. Yes, sir. Listen, does that guy park a
clock?'</p>

<p>His guide was a little dazed.</p>

<p>'Does he wear a watch? Sure!'</p>

<p>Mr. Art Lomer nodded.</p>

<p>'Wait&mdash;I'll bring it back to you in five
minutes&mdash;I'm goin' to show you sump'n'.'</p>

<p>It was the maddest fool thing he had ever done in his life; he
was in London on business, and was jeopardising a million dollars
for the sake of the cheap applause of a man for whose opinion he
did not care a cent.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was standing nervously on the sidewalk, waiting for
what he described as 'the vehicular traffic' to pass, when a
strange man bumped against him.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, sir,' said the stranger.</p>

<p>'Not at all,' murmured Mr. Reeder. 'My watch is five minutes
fast&mdash;you can see the correct time by Big Ben.'</p>

<p>Mr. Lomer felt a hand dip into his coat pocket, saw, like one
hypnotised, the watch go back to J.G. Reeder's pocket.</p>

<p>'Over here for long?' asked Mr. Reeder pleasantly.</p>

<p>'Why&mdash;yes.'</p>

<p>'It's a nice time of the year.' Mr. Reeder removed his
eyeglasses, rubbed them feebly on his sleeve and replaced them
crookedly. 'But the country is not quite so beautiful as Canada
in the fall. How is Leoni?'</p>

<p>Art Lomer did not faint; he swayed slightly and blinked hard,
as if he were trying to wake up. Leoni was the proprietor of that
little restaurant in Buffalo which was the advanced base of those
operations so profitable to Art and his friends.</p>

<p>'Leoni? Say, mister&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And the troupe&mdash;are they performing in England
or&mdash;er&mdash;resting? I think that is the word.'</p>

<p>Art gaped at the other. On Mr. Reeder's face was an expression
of solicitude and inquiry. It was as though the well-being of the
troupe was an absorbing preoccupation.</p>

<p>'Say&mdash;listen&mdash;' began Art huskily.</p>

<p>Before he could collect his thoughts, Reeder was crossing the
road with nervous glances left and right, his umbrella gripped
tightly in his hand.</p>

<p>'I guess I'm crazy,' said Mr. Lomer, and walked back very
slowly to where he had left his anxious cicerone.</p>

<p>'No&mdash;he got away before I could touch him,' he said
briefly, for he had his pride. 'Come along, we'll get some eats,
it's nearly twel&mdash;'</p>

<p>He put his hand to his pocket, but his watch was gone! So also
was the expensive platinum albert. Mr. Reeder could be heavily
jocular on occasions.</p>

<p>'Art Lomer&mdash;is there anything against him?' asked the
Director of Public Prosecutions, whose servant Mr. J.G. Reeder
was.</p>

<p>'No, sir, there is no complaint here. I have come
into&mdash;er&mdash;possession of a watch of his, which I find,
by reference to my private file, was stolen in Cleveland in
1921&mdash;it is in the police file of that date.
Only&mdash;um&mdash;it seems remarkable that this gentleman
should be in London at the end of the tourist season.'</p>

<p>The Director pursed his lips dubiously.</p>

<p>'M--m. Tell the people at the Yard. He doesn't belong to us.
What is his speciality?'</p>

<p>'He is a troupe leader&mdash;I think that is the term. Mr.
Lomer was once associated with a theatrical company
in&mdash;er&mdash;a humble capacity.'</p>

<p>'You mean he is an actor?' asked the puzzled Director.</p>

<p>'Ye--es, sir; a producer rather than actor. I have heard about
his troupe, though I have never had the pleasure of seeing them
perform. A talented company.'</p>

<p>He sighed heavily and shook his head. 'I don't quite follow
you about the troupe. How did his watch come into your
possession, Reeder?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded. 'That was a little jest on my part,' he
said, lowering his voice. 'A little jest.'</p>

<p>The Director knew Mr. Reeder too well to pursue the
subject.</p>

<p>Lomer was living at the Hotel Calfort, in Bloomsbury. He
occupied an important suite, for, being in the position of a man
who was after big fish, he could not cavil at the cost of the
groundbait. The big fish had bitten much sooner than Art Lomer
had dared to hope. Its name was Bertie Claude Staffen, and the
illustration was apt, for there was something very fishlike about
this young man with his dull eyes and his permanently opened
mouth. Bertie's father was rich beyond the dreams of actresses.
He was a pottery manufacturer, who bought cotton mills as a side-line, and he had made so much money that he never hired a taxi if
he could take a bus, and never took a bus if he could walk. In
this way he kept his liver (to which he frequently referred) in
good order and hastened the degeneration of his heart.</p>

<p>Bertie Claude had inherited all his father's meanness and such
of his money as was not left to faithful servants, orphan homes
and societies for promoting the humanities, which meant that
Bertie inherited almost every penny. He had the weak chin and
sloping forehead of an undeveloped intellect, but he knew there
were twelve pennies to a shilling and that one hundred cents
equalled one dollar, and that is more knowledge than the only
sons of millionaires usually acquire.</p>

<p>He had one quality which few would suspect in him: the gift of
romantic dreaming. When Mr. Staffen was not occupied in cutting
down overhead charges or speeding up production, he loved to sit
at his ease, a cigarette between his lips, his eyes half closed,
and picture himself in heroic situations. Thus, he could imagine
dark caves stumbled upon by accident, filled with dusty boxes
bulging with treasure; or he saw himself at Deauville Casino,
with immense piles of mille notes before him, won from fabulously
rich Greeks, Armenians&mdash;in fact, anybody who is fabulously
rich. Most of his dreams were about money in sufficient
quantities to repay him the death duties on his father's estate
which had been iniquitously wrung from him by thieving revenue
officers. He was a very rich man, but ought to be
richer&mdash;this was his considered view.</p>

<p>When Bertie Claude arrived at the Calfort Hotel and was shown
into Art's private sitting-room, he stepped into a world of heady
romance. For the big table in the centre of the room was covered
with specimens of quartz of every grade, and they had been
recovered from a brand-new mine located by Art's mythical brother
and sited at a spot which was known only to two men, one of whom
was Art Lomer and the other Bertie Claude Staffen.</p>

<p>Mr. Staffen took off his light overcoat and, walking to the
table, inspected the ore with sober interest.</p>

<p>'I've had the assay,' he said. 'The johnny who did it is a
friend of mine and didn't charge a penny; his report is
promising&mdash;very promising.'</p>

<p>'The company&mdash;' began Art, but Mr. Staffen raised a
warning finger.</p>

<p>'I think you know, and it is unnecessary for me to remind you,
that I do not intend speculating a dollar in this mine. I'm
putting up no money. What I'm prepared to do is to use my
influence in the promotion for a quid pro quo. You know what that
means?'</p>

<p>'Something for nothing!' said Art, and in this instance was
not entirely wide of the mark.</p>

<p>'Well, no&mdash;stock in the company. Maybe I'll take a
directorship later, when the money is up and everything is plain
sailing. I can't lend my name to a&mdash;well, unknown
quantity.'</p>

<p>Art agreed.</p>

<p>'My friend has put up the money,' he said easily. 'If that guy
had another hundred dollars he'd have all the money in the
world&mdash;he's that rich. Stands to reason, Mr. Staffen, that I
wouldn't come over here tryin' to get money from a gentleman who
is practically a stranger. We met in Canada&mdash;sure we did!
But what do you know about me? I might be one large crook&mdash;I
might be a con man or anything!'</p>

<p>Some such idea had occurred to Bertie Claude, but the very
frankness of his friend dispelled something of his
suspicions.</p>

<p>'I've often wondered since what you must have thought of me,
sittin' in a game with that bunch of thugs,' Art went on, puffing
a reflective cigar. 'But I guess you said to yourself, "This guy
is a man of the world&mdash;he's gotta mix." An' that's true. In
these Canadian mining camps you horn in with some real tough
boys&mdash;yes, sir. They're sump'n' fierce.'</p>

<p>'I quite understood the position,' said Bertie Claude, who
hadn't. 'I flatter myself I know men. If I haven't shown that in
"Homo Sum" then I've failed in expression.'</p>

<p>'Sure,' said Mr. Lomer lazily, and added another 'Sure!' to
ram home the first. 'That's a pretty good book. When you give it
to me at King Edward Hotel I thought it was sump'n' about
arithmetic. But 'tis mighty good poetry, every line startin' with
big letters an' the end of every line sounding like the end word
in the line before. I said to my secretary, "That Mr. Staffen
must have a brain." How you get the ideas beats me. That one
about the princess who comes out of a clam&mdash;'</p>

<p>'An oyster&mdash;she was the embodiment of the pearl,' Bertie
hastened to explain. 'You mean "The White Maiden"?'</p>

<p>Lomer nodded lazily.</p>

<p>'That was grand. I never read poetry till I read that; it just
made me want to cry like a great big fool! If I had your gifts I
wouldn't be loafin' round Ontario prospecting. No, sir.'</p>

<p>'It is a gift,' said Mr. Staffen after thought. 'You say you
have the money for the company?'</p>

<p>'Every cent. I'm not in a position to offer a single
share&mdash;that's true. Not that you need worry about that. I've
reserved a few from promotion. No, sir, I never had any intention
of allowing you to pay a cent.'</p>

<p>He knocked off the ash of his cigar and frowned.</p>

<p>'You've been mighty nice to me, Mr. Staffen,' he said slowly,
'and though I don't feel called upon to tell every man my
business, you're such a square white fellow that I feel sort of
confident about you. This mine means nothing.'</p>

<p>Bertie Claude's eyebrows rose.</p>

<p>'I don't quite get you,' he said.</p>

<p>Art's smile was slow and a little sad.</p>

<p>'Doesn't it occur to you that if I've got the capital for that
property, it was foolish of me to take a trip to Europe?'</p>

<p>Bertie had certainly wondered why.</p>

<p>'Selling that mine was like selling bars of gold. It didn't
want any doing; I could have sold it if I'd been living in the
Amaganni Forest. No, sir, I'm here on business that would make
your hair stand up if you knew.'</p>

<p>He rose abruptly and paced the room with quick, nervous
strides, his brow furrowed in thought.</p>

<p>'You're a whale of a poet,' he said suddenly. 'Maybe you've
got more imagination than most people. What does the mine mean
for me? A few hundred thousand dollars' profit.' He shrugged his
shoulders. 'What are you doing on Wednesday?'</p>

<p>The brusqueness of the question took Bertie Claude aback.</p>

<p>'On Wednesday? Well, I don't know that I'm doing
anything.'</p>

<p>Mr. Lomer bit his lip thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'I've got a little house on the river. Come down and spend a
night with me, and I'll let you into a secret that these
newspapers would give a million dollars to know. If you read it
in a book you wouldn't believe it. Maybe one day you can write
it. It would take a man with your imagination to put it over.
Say, I'll tell you now.'</p>

<p>And then, with some hesitation, Mr. Lomer told his story.</p>

<p>'Politics, and all that, I know nothing about. There has been
a sort of revolution in Russia by all accounts, and queer things
have been happenin'. I'm not such a dunce that I don't know that.
My interest in Russia was about the same as yours in Piketown,
Saskatchewan. But about six months ago I got in touch with a
couple of Russkis. They came out of the United States in a hurry,
with a sheriff's posse behind them, and I happened to be staying
on a farm near the border when they turned up. And what do you
think they'd been doing?'</p>

<p>Mr. Staffen shook his head.</p>

<p>'Peddling emeralds,' said the other soberly.</p>

<p>'Emeralds? Peddling? What do you mean&mdash;trying to sell
emeralds?'</p>

<p>Art nodded.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. One had a paper bag full of 'em, all sizes. I
bought the lot for twelve thousand dollars, took 'em down to
T'ronto and got them valued at something under a million
dollars.'</p>

<p>Bertie Claude was listening open-mouthed.</p>

<p>'These fellows had come from Moscow. They'd been peddlin'
jewellery for four years. Some broken-down Prince was acting as
agent for the other swells&mdash;I didn't ask questions too
closely, because naturally I'm not inquisitive.'</p>

<p>He leant forward and tapped the other's knee to emphasise his
words.</p>

<p>'The stuff I bought wasn't a twentieth of their stock. I sent
them back to Russia for the rest of the loot, and they're due
here next I week.'</p>

<p>'Twenty million dollars!' gasped Bertie Claude. 'What will it
cost you?'</p>

<p>'A million dollars--two hundred thousand pounds. Come down to
my place at Marlow, and I'll show you the grandest emeralds you
ever saw&mdash;all that I've got left, as a matter of fact. I
sold the biggest part to a Pittsburg millionaire for&mdash;well,
I won't give you the price, because you'll think I robbed him! If
you like any stone you see&mdash;why, I'll let you buy it, though
I don't want to sell. Naturally, I couldn't make profit out of a
friend.'</p>

<p>Bertie Claude listened, dazed, while his host catalogued his
treasures with an ease and a shrewd sense of appraisement. When
Mr. Staffen left his friend's room, his head was in a whirl,
though he experienced a bewildered sense of familiarity with a
situation which had often figured in his dreams.</p>

<p>As he strode through the hall, he saw a middle-aged man with a
flat-topped felt hat, but beyond noticing that he wore a ready-made cravat, that his shoes were square-toed and that he looked
rather like a bailiff's officer, Bertie Claude would have passed
him, had not the old-fashioned gentleman stood in his way.</p>

<p>'Excuse me, sir. You're Mr. Staffen, are you not?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Bertie shortly.</p>

<p>'I wonder if I could have a few moments' conversation with you
on&mdash;er&mdash;a matter of some moment?'</p>

<p>Bertie waved an impatient hand.</p>

<p>'I've no time to see anybody,' he said brusquely. 'If you want
an appointment you'd better write for it.'</p>

<p>And he walked out, leaving the sad-looking man to gaze
pensively after him.</p>

<p>Mr. Lomer's little house was an isolated stone bungalow
between Marlow and the Quarry Wood, and if he had sought
diligently, Mr. Lomer could not have found a property more
suitable for his purpose. Bertie Claude, who associated the river
with sunshine and flannelled ease, shivered as he came out of the
railway station and looked anxiously up at the grey sky. It was
raining steadily, and the station cab that was waiting for him
dripped from every surface.</p>

<p>'Pretty beastly month to take a bungalow on the river,' he
grumbled.</p>

<p>Mr. Lomer, who was not quite certain in his mind what was the
ideal month for riverside bungalows, agreed.</p>

<p>'It suits me,' he said. 'This house of mine has got the right
kind of lonesomeness. I just hate having people looking over
me.'</p>

<p>The road from the station to the house followed parallel with
the line of the river. Staring out of the streaming windows, Mr.
Staffen saw only the steel-grey of water and the damp grasses of
the meadows through which the road ran. A quarter of an hour's
drive, however, brought them to a pretty little cottage which
stood in a generous garden. A bright fire burnt in the hall fire-place, and there was a general air of cosiness and comfort about
the place that revived Bertie's flagging spirits. A few seconds
later they were sitting in a half-timbered dining-room, where tea
had been laid.</p>

<p>Atmosphere has an insensible appeal to most people, and Bertie
found himself impressed alike by the snugness of the place and
the unexpected service, for there was a trim, pretty waiting
maid, a sedate, middle-aged butler, and a sober-faced young man
in footman's livery, who had taken off his wet mackintosh and had
rubbed his boots dry before he entered the dining-room.</p>

<p>'No, the house isn't mine: it is one I always hire when I'm in
England,' said Mr. Lomer, who never told a small and unnecessary
lie; because small and unnecessary lies are so easily detected.
'Jenkins, the butler, is my man, so is the valet; the other
people I just hired with the house.'</p>

<p>After tea he showed Bertie up to his bedroom, and, opening a
drawer of his bureau, took out a small steel box, fastened with
two locks. These he unfastened and lifted out a shallow metal
tray covered with a layer of cotton-wool.</p>

<p>'You can have any of these, that take your eye,' he said.
'Make me an offer and I'll tell you what they're worth.'</p>

<p>He rolled back the cotton-wool and revealed six magnificent
stones.</p>

<p>'That one?' said Mr. Lomer, taking the largest between his
finger and thumb. 'Why that's worth six thousand
dollars&mdash;about twelve hundred pounds. And if you offered me
that sum for it, I'd think you were a fool, because the only safe
way of getting emeralds is to buy 'em fifty per cent. under
value. I reckon that cost me about'&mdash;he made a mental
calculation&mdash;'ninety pounds.'</p>

<p>Bertie's eyes shone. On emeralds he was something of an
expert, and that these stones were genuine, he knew.</p>

<p>'You wouldn't like to sell it for ninety pounds?' he asked
carelessly.</p>

<p>Art Lomer shook his head.</p>

<p>'No, sir. I've gotta make some profit even from my friends!
I'll let you have it for a hundred.'</p>

<p>Bertie's hand sought his inside pocket.</p>

<p>'No, I don't want paying now. What do you know about emeralds
anyway? They might be a clever fake. Take it up to town, show it
to an expert&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'll give you the cheque now.'</p>

<p>'Any time will do.'</p>

<p>Art wrapped up the stone carefully, put it in a small box and
handed it to his companion.</p>

<p>'That's the only one I'm going to sell,' he explained as he
led the way back to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Bertie went immediately to the small secretaire, wrote the
cheque and, tearing it out, handed it to Mr. Lomer. Art looked at
the paper and frowned.</p>

<p>'Why, what do I do with this?' he asked. 'I've got no bank
account here. All my money's in the Associated Express
Company.'</p>

<p>'I'll make it "pay bearer,"' said Bertie obligingly.</p>

<p>Still Mr. Lomer was dubious.</p>

<p>'Just write a note telling the President, or whoever he is, to
cash that little bit of paper. I hate banks anyway.'</p>

<p>The obliging Bertie Claude scribbled the necessary note. When
this was done, Bertie came to business, for he was a business
man. 'Can I come in on this jewel deal?'</p>

<p>Art Lomer shook his head reluctantly. 'Sorry, Mr. Staffen, but
that's almost impossible. I'll be quite frank with you, because I
believe in straightforward dealing. When you ask to come in on
that transaction, you're just asking me for money!'</p>

<p>Bertie made a faint noise of protest.</p>

<p>'Well, that's a mean way of putting it, but it comes to the
same thing. I've taken all the risk, I've organised the
operation&mdash;and it's cost money to get that guy out of
Russia: aeroplanes and special trains and everything. I just hate
to refuse you, because I like you, Mr. Staffen. Maybe if there's
any little piece to which you might take a fancy, I'll let you
have it at a reasonable price.'</p>

<p>Bertie thought for a moment, his busy mind at work.</p>

<p>'What has the deal cost you up to now?' he asked.</p>

<p>Again Mr. Lomer shook his head. 'It doesn't matter what it's
cost me&mdash;if you offered me four times the amount of money
I've spent&mdash;and that would be a considerable sum&mdash;I
couldn't let you in on this deal. I might go so far as giving you
a small interest, but I wouldn't take money for that.'</p>

<p>'We'll talk about it later,' said Bertie, who never lost
hope.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased, and the setting sun flooded the river
with pale gold, and Bertie was walking in the garden with his
host, when from somewhere above them came the faint hum of an
aeroplane engine. Presently he saw the machine circling and
disappearing behind the black crown of Quarry Wood. He heard an
exclamation from the man at his side and, turning, saw Art's face
puckered in a grimace of annoyance and doubt.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I'm wondering,' said Art slowly. 'They told me next
week...why, no, I'm foolish.'</p>

<p>It was dark. The butler had turned on the lights and drawn the
blinds when they went indoors again, and it was not difficult for
Bertie to realise that something had happened which was very
disturbing to his host. He was taciturn, and for the next half-hour scarcely spoke, sitting in front of the fire gazing into the
leaping flames and starting at every sound.</p>

<p>Dinner, a simple meal, was served early, and whilst the
servants were clearing away, the two men strolled into the tiny
drawing-room.</p>

<p>'What's the trouble, Lomer?'</p>

<p>'Nothing,' said the other with a start, 'only&mdash;'</p>

<p>At that moment they heard the tinkle of a bell, and Art
listened tensely. He heard the parley of voices in the hall, and
then the footman came.</p>

<p>'There's two men and a lady to see you, sir,' he said.</p>

<p>Bertie saw the other bite his lip.</p>

<p>'Show them in,' said Art curtly, and a second later a tall
man, wearing the leather coat and helmet of an airman, walked
into the room.</p>

<p>'Marsham! What in hell &mdash; !'</p>

<p>The girl who followed instantly claimed Bertie Claude's
attention. She was slim and dark, and her face was beautiful,
despite the pallor of her cheeks and the tired look in her eyes.
The second of the men visitors was hardly as prepossessing: a
squat, foreign-looking individual with a short-clipped beard, he
was wrapped to his neck in an old fur overcoat, and his wild-looking head was bare.</p>

<p>Art closed the door.</p>

<p>'What's the great idea?' he asked.</p>

<p>'There's been trouble,' said the tall man sulkily. 'The Prince
has had another offer. He has sent some of the stuff, but he
won't part with the pearls or the diamonds until you pay him half
of the money you promised. This is Princess Pauline Dimitroff,
the Prince's daughter,' he explained.</p>

<p>Art shot an angry look at the girl.</p>

<p>'Say, see here, young lady,' he said, 'I suppose you speak
English?'</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>'This isn't the way we do business in our country. Your father
promised&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My father has been very precipitate,' she said, with the
slightest of foreign accent, which was delightful to Bertie's
ear. 'He has taken much risk. Indeed, I am not sure that he has
been very honest in the matter. It is very simple for you to pay.
If he has your money to-night&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To-night?' boomed Art. 'How can I get the money for him to-night?'</p>

<p>'He is in Holland,' said the girl. 'We have the aeroplane
waiting.'</p>

<p>'But how can I get the money to-night?' repeated the Canadian
angrily. 'Do you think I carry a hundred thousand pounds in my
pistol pocket?'</p>

<p>Again she shrugged, and, turning to the unkempt little man,
said something to him in a language which was unintelligible to
Mr. Staffen. He replied in his hoarse voice, and she nodded.</p>

<p>'Pieter says my father will take your cheque. He only wishes
to be sure that there is no&mdash;' She paused, at a loss for an
English word.</p>

<p>'Did I ever double-cross your father?' asked Art savagely. 'I
can't give you either the money or the cheque. You can call off
the deal&mdash;I'm through!'</p>

<p>By this time the aviator had unrolled the package he carried
under his arm, placed it on the table, and Bertie Claude grew
breathless at the sight of the glittering display that met his
eyes. There were diamonds, set and unset; quaint and ancient
pieces of jewellery that must have formed the heirlooms of old
families; but their historical value did not for the moment occur
to him. He beckoned Art aside.</p>

<p>'If you can keep these people here tonight,' he said in a low
voice, 'I'll undertake to raise all the money you want on that
collection alone.'</p>

<p>Art shook his head.</p>

<p>'It's no use, Mr. Staffen. I know this guy. Unless I can send
him the money to-night, we'll not smell the rest of the
stuff.'</p>

<p>Suddenly he clapped his hands.</p>

<p>'Gee!' he breathed. 'That's an idea! You've got your cheque-book.'</p>

<p>Cold suspicion showed in the eyes of Bertie Claude.</p>

<p>'I've got my cheque-book, certainly,' he said,
'but&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Come into the dining-room.' Art almost ran ahead of him, and
when they reached the room he closed the door. 'A cheque can't be
presented for two or three days. It certainly couldn't be
presented to-morrow,' he said, speaking rapidly. 'By that time we
could get this stuff up to town to your bankers, and you could
keep it until I redeem it. What's more, you can stop payment of
the cheque tomorrow morning if the stones aren't worth the
money.'</p>

<p>Bertie looked at the matter from ten different angles in as
many seconds.</p>

<p>'Suppose I gave them a post-dated cheque to make sure?' he
said.</p>

<p>'Post-dated?' Mr. Lomer was puzzled. 'What does that mean?'
And when Bertie explained, his face brightened. 'Why, sure!' he
said. 'That's a double protection. Make it payable the day after
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Bertie hesitated no more. Sitting down at the table he took
out his cheque-book and a fountain pen, and verified the
date.</p>

<p>'Make it "bearer",' suggested Art, when the writer paused,
'same as you did the other cheque.'</p>

<p>Bertie nodded and added his signature, with its characteristic
underlining.</p>

<p>'Wait a second.'</p>

<p>Art went out of the room and came back within a minute.</p>

<p>'They've taken it!' he said exultantly. 'Boy,' he said, as he
slapped the gratified young man on the shoulder, 'you've gotta
come in on this now and I didn't want you to. It's fifty-fifty&mdash;I'm no hog. Come along, and I'll show you something
else that I never intended showing a soul.'</p>

<p>He went out into the passage, opened a little door that led
down a flight of stone steps to the cellar, switching on the
light as he went down the stairs. Unlocking a heavy door, he
threw it open.</p>

<p>'See here,' he said, 'did you ever see anything like
this?'</p>

<p>Bertie Claude peered into the dark interior.</p>

<p>'I don't see&mdash;' he began, when he was so violently pushed
into the darkness that he stumbled.</p>

<p>In another second the door closed on him; he heard the snap of
a lock and shrieked: 'I say, what's this!'</p>

<p>'I say, you'll find out in a day or two,' said the mocking
voice of Mr. Lomer.</p>

<p>Art closed the second door, ran lightly up the stairs and
joined footman, butler, trim maid and the three visitors in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>'He's well inside. And he stays there till the cheque
matures&mdash;there's enough food and water in the cellar to last
him a week.'</p>

<p>'Did you get him?' asked the bearded Russian.</p>

<p>'Get him! He was easy,' said the other scornfully. 'Now, you
boys and girls, skip, and skip quick! I've got a letter from this
guy to his bank manager, telling him to&mdash;' he consulted the
letter and quoted&mdash;'"to cash the attached cheque for my
friend Mr. Arthur Lomer.'"</p>

<p>There was a murmur of approval from the troupe.</p>

<p>'The aeroplane's gone back, I suppose?'</p>

<p>The man in the leather coat nodded.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'I only hired it for the afternoon.'</p>

<p>'Well, you can get back too. Ray and Al, you go to Paris and
take the C.P. boat from Havre. Slicky, you get those whiskers off
and leave honest from Liverpool. Pauline and Aggie will make
Genoa, and we'll meet at Leoni's on the fourteenth of next month
and cut the stuff all ways!'</p>

<p>Two days later Mr. Art Lomer walked into the noble offices of
the Northern Commercial Bank and sought an interview with the
manager. That gentleman read the letter, examined the cheque and
touched a bell.</p>

<p>'It's a mighty big sum,' said Mr. Lomer, in an almost awe-stricken voice.</p>

<p>The manager smiled. 'We cash fairly large cheques here,' he
said, and, to the clerk who came at his summons: 'Mr. Lomer would
like as much of this in American currency as possible. How did
you leave Mr. Staffen?'</p>

<p>'Why, Bertie and I have been in Paris over that new company of
mine,' said Lomer. 'My! it's difficult to finance Canadian
industries in this country, Mr. Soames, but we've made a mighty
fine deal in Paris.'</p>

<p>He chatted on purely commercial topics until the clerk
returned and laid a heap of bills and bank-notes on the table.
Mr. Lomer produced a wallet, enclosed the money securely, shook
hands with the manager and walked out into the general office.
And then he stopped, for Mr. J.G. Reeder stood squarely in his
path.</p>

<p>'Pay-day for the troupe, Mr. Lomer&mdash;or do you call it
"treasury"? My theatrical glossary is rather rusty.'</p>

<p>'Why, Mr. Reeder,' stammered Art, 'glad to see you, but I'm
rather busy just now&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What do you think has happened to our dear friend, Mr. Bertie
Claude Staffen?' asked Reeder anxiously.</p>

<p>'Why, he's in Paris.'</p>

<p>'So soon!' murmured Reeder. 'And the police only took him out
of your suburban cellar an hour ago! How wonderful are our modern
systems of transportation! Marlow one minute, Paris the next, and
Moscow, let us say, the next.'</p>

<p>Art hesitated no longer. He dashed past, thrusting the
detective aside, and flew for the door. He was so annoyed that
the two men who were waiting for him had the greatest difficulty
in putting the handcuffs on his wrists.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said Mr. Reeder to his chief, 'Art always travels
with his troupe. The invisibility of the troupe was to me a
matter for grave suspicion, and of course I've had the house
under observation ever since Mr. Staffen disappeared. It is not
my business, of course,' he said apologetically, 'and really I
should not have interfered. Only, as I have often explained to
you, the curious workings of my mind &mdash;'</p>

MARBLE</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Flynn's</i>, 20 December 1924<br>
<br>
Reprinted as "The Telephone Box" in<br>
<i>Dime Mystery Book Magazine</i>, Mar 1933</h3>

<p class="first">MARGARET BELMAN'S chiefest claim to Mr. Reeder's
notice was that she lived in the Brockley Road, some few doors
from his own establishment. He did not know her name, being
wholly incurious about law-abiding folk, but he was aware that
she was pretty, that her complexion was that pink and white which
is seldom seen away from a magazine cover. She dressed well, and
if there was one thing that he noted about her more than any
other, it was that she walked and carried herself with a certain
grace that was especially pleasing to a man of aesthetic
predilections.</p>

<p>He had, on occasions, walked behind her and before her, and
had ridden on the same street car with her to Westminster Bridge.
She invariably descended at the corner of the Embankment, and was
as invariably met by a good-looking young man and walked away
with him. The presence of that young man was a source of passive
satisfaction to Mr. Reeder, for no particular reason, unless it
was that he had a tidy mind, and preferred a rose when it had a
background of fern and grew uneasy at the sight of a saucerless
cup.</p>

<p>It did not occur to him that he was an object of interest and
curiosity to Miss Belman.</p>

<p>'That was Mr. Reeder&mdash;he has something to do with the
police, I think,' she said.</p>

<p>'Mr. J.G. Reeder?'</p>

<p>Roy Master looked back with interest at the middle-aged man
scampering fearfully across the road, his unusual hat on the back
of his head, his umbrella over his shoulder like a cavalryman's
sword.</p>

<p>'Good Lord! I never dreamt he was like that.'</p>

<p>'Who is he?' she asked, distracted from her own problem.</p>

<p>'Reeder? He's in the Public Prosecutor's Department, a sort of
a detective&mdash;there was a case the other week where he gave
evidence. He used to be with the Bank of England&mdash;'</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped, and he looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I don't want you to go any farther, Roy,' she said. 'Mr.
Telfer saw me with you yesterday, and he's quite unpleasant about
it.'</p>

<p>'Telfer?' said the young man indignantly. 'That little worm!
What did he say?'</p>

<p>'Nothing very much,' she replied, but from her tone he
gathered that the 'nothing very much' had been a little
disturbing.</p>

<p>'I am leaving Telfers,' she said unexpectedly. 'It is a good
job, and I shall never get another like it&mdash;I mean, so far
as the pay is concerned.'</p>

<p>Roy Master did not attempt to conceal his satisfaction.</p>

<p>'I'm jolly glad,' he said vigorously. 'I can't imagine how
you've endured that boudoir atmosphere so long. What did he say?'
he asked again, and, before she could answer: 'Anyway, Telfers
are shaky. There are all sorts of queer rumours about them in the
City.'</p>

<p>'But I thought it was a very rich corporation!' she said in
astonishment.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>'It was&mdash;but they have been doing lunatic
things&mdash;what can you expect when a halfwitted weakling like
Sidney Telfer is at the head of affairs? They underwrote three
concerns last year that no brokerage business would have touched
with a barge-pole, and they had to take up the shares. One was a
lost treasure company to raise a Spanish galleon that sank three
hundred years ago! But what really did happen yesterday
morning?'</p>

<p>'I will tell you to-night,' she said, and made her hasty
adieux.</p>

<p>Mr. Sidney Telfer had arrived when she went into a room which,
in its luxurious appointments, its soft carpet and dainty
etceteras, was not wholly undeserving of Roy Masters'
description.</p>

<p>The head of Telfers Consolidated seldom visited his main
office on Threadneedle Street. The atmosphere of the place, he
said, depressed him; it was all so horrid and sordid and rough.
The founder of the firm, his grandfather, had died ten years
before Sidney had been born, leaving the business to a son, a
chronic invalid, who had died a few weeks after Sidney first saw
the light. In the hands of trustees the business had flourished,
despite the spasmodic interferences of his eccentric mother,
whose peculiarities culminated in a will which relieved him of
most of that restraint which is wisely laid upon a boy of
sixteen.</p>

<p>The room, with its stained-glass windows and luxurious
furnishing, fitted Mr. Telfer perfectly, for he was exquisitely
arrayed. He was tall and so painfully thin that the abnormal
smallness of his head was not at first apparent. As the girl came
into the room he was sniffing delicately at a fine cambric
handkerchief, and she thought that he was paler than she had ever
seen him&mdash;and more repellent.</p>

<p>He followed her movements with a dull stare, and she had
placed his letters on his table before he spoke.</p>

<p>'I say. Miss Belman, you won't mention a word about what I
said to you last night?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Telfer,' she answered quietly, 'I am hardly likely to
discuss such a matter.'</p>

<p>'I'd marry you and all that, only...clause in my mother's
will,' he said disjointedly. 'That could be got over&mdash;in
time.'</p>

<p>She stood by the table, her hands resting on the edge.</p>

<p>'I would not marry you, Mr. Telfer, even if there were no
clause in your mother's will; the suggestion that I should run
away with you to America&mdash;'</p>

<p>'South America,' he corrected her gravely. 'Not the United
States; there was never any suggestion of the United States.'</p>

<p>She could have smiled, for she was not as angry with this
rather vacant young man as his startling proposition entitled her
to be.</p>

<p>'The point is,' he went on anxiously, 'you'll keep it to
yourself? I've been worried dreadfully all night. I told you to
send me a note saying what you thought of my idea&mdash;well,
don't!'</p>

<p>This time she did smile, but before she could answer him he
went on, speaking rapidly in a high treble that sometimes rose to
a falsetto squeak:</p>

<p>'You're a perfectly beautiful girl, and I'm crazy about you,
but... there's a tragedy in my life...really. Perfectly ghastly
tragedy. An' everything's at sixes an' sevens. If I'd had any
sense I'd have brought in a feller to look after things. I'm
beginning to see that now.'</p>

<p>For the second time in twenty-four hours this young man, who
had almost been tongue-tied and had never deigned to notice her,
had poured forth a torrent of confidences, and in one had, with
frantic insistence, set forth a plan which had amazed and shocked
her. Abruptly he finished, wiped his weak eyes, and in his normal
voice:</p>

<p>'Get Billingham on the 'phone; I want him.'</p>

<p>She wondered, as her busy fingers flew over the keys of her
typewriter, to what extent his agitation and wild eloquence was
due to the rumoured 'shakiness' of Telfers Consolidated.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham came, a sober little man, bald and taciturn,
and went in his secretive way into his employer's room. There was
no hint in his appearance or his manner that he contemplated a
great crime. He was stout to a point of podginess; apart from his
habitual frown, his round face, unlined by the years, was marked
by an expression of benevolence.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Stephen Billingham, managing director of the Telfer
Consolidated Trust, went into the office of the London and
Central Bank late that afternoon and, presenting a bearer cheque
for one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, which was duly
honoured, was driven to the Credit Lilloise. He had telephoned
particulars of his errand, and there were waiting for him
seventeen packets, each containing a million francs, and a
smaller packet of a hundred and forty-six mille notes. The franc
stood at 74.55 and he received the eighteen packages in exchange
for a cheque on the Credit Lilloise for £80,000 and the 150
thousand-pound notes which he had drawn on the London and
Central.</p>

<p>Of Billingham's movements thenceforth little was known. He was
seen by an acquaintance driving through Cheapside in a taxicab
which was traced as far as Charing Cross&mdash;and there he
disappeared. Neither the airways nor the waterways had known him,
the police theory being that he had left by an evening train that
had carried an excursion party via Havre to Paris.</p>

<p>'This is the biggest steal we have had in years,' said the
Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions. 'If you can slip in
sideways on the inquiry, Mr. Reeder, I should be glad. Don't step
on the toes of the City police&mdash;they are quite amiable
people where murder is concerned, but a little touchy where money
is in question. Go along and see Sidney Telfer.'</p>

<p>Fortunately, the prostrated Sidney was discoverable outside
the City area. Mr. Reeder went into the outer office and saw a
familiar face.</p>

<p>'Pardon me, I think I know you, young lady,' he said, and she
smiled as she opened the little wooden gate to admit him.</p>

<p>'You are Mr. Reeder&mdash;we live in the same road,' she said,
and then quickly: 'Have you come about Mr. Billingham?'</p>

<p>'Yes.' His voice was hushed, as though he were speaking of a
dead friend. 'I wanted to see Mr. Telfer, but perhaps you could
give me a little information.'</p>

<p>The only news she had was that Sidney Telfer had been in the
office since seven o'clock and was at the moment in such a state
of collapse that she had sent for the doctor.</p>

<p>'I doubt if he is in a condition to see you,' she said.</p>

<p>'I will take all responsibility,' said Mr. Reeder soothingly.
'Is Mr. Telfer&mdash;er&mdash;a friend of yours. Miss &mdash;
?'</p>

<p>'Belman is my name.' He had seen the quick flush that came to
her cheek: it could mean one of two things. 'No, I am an
employee, that is all.'</p>

<p>Her tone told him all he wanted to know. Mr. J.G. Reeder was
something of an authority on office friendships.</p>

<p>'Bothered you a little, has he?' he murmured, and she shot a
suspicious look at him. What did he know, and what bearing had
Mr. Telfer's mad proposal on the present disaster? She was
entirely in the dark as to the true state of affairs; it was, she
felt, a moment for frankness.</p>

<p>'Wanted you to run away! Dear me!' Mr. Reeder was shocked. 'He
is married?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no&mdash;he's not married,' said the girl shortly. 'Poor
man, I'm sorry for him now. I'm afraid that the loss is a very
heavy one&mdash;who would suspect Mr. Billingham?'</p>

<p>'Ah! who indeed!' sighed the lugubrious Reeder, and took off
his glasses to wipe them; almost she suspected tears. 'I think I
will go in now&mdash;that is the door?'</p>

<p>Sidney jerked up his face and glared at the intruder. He had
been sitting with his head on his arms for the greater part of an
hour.</p>

<p>'I say...what do you want?' he asked feebly. 'I say...I can't
see anybody...Public Prosecutor's Department?' He almost screamed
the words. 'What's the use of prosecuting him if you don't get
the money back?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder let him work down before he began to ply his very
judicious questions.</p>

<p>'I don't know much about it,' said the despondent young man.
'I'm only a sort of figurehead. Billingham brought the cheques
for me to sign and I signed 'em. I never gave him instructions;
he got his orders. I don't know very much about it. He told me,
actually told me, that the business was in a bad way&mdash;half a
million or something was wanted by next week...Oh, my God! And
then he took the whole of our cash.'</p>

<p>Sidney Telfer sobbed his woe into his sleeve like a child. Mr.
Reeder waited before he asked a question in his gentlest
manner.</p>

<p>'No, I wasn't here: I went down to Brighton for the week-end.
And the police dug me out of bed at four in the morning. We're
bankrupt. I'll have to sell my car and resign from my
club&mdash;one has to resign when one is bankrupt.'</p>

<p>There was little more to learn from the broken man, and Mr.
Reeder returned to his chief with a report that added nothing to
the sum of knowledge. In a week the theft of Mr. Billingham
passed from scare lines to paragraphs in most of the
papers&mdash;Billingham had made a perfect getaway.</p>

<p>In the bright lexicon of Mr. J.G. Reeder there was no such
word as holiday. Even the Public Prosecutor's office has its
slack time, when juniors and sub-officials and even the Director
himself can go away on vacation, leaving the office open and a
subordinate in charge. But to Mr. J.G. Reeder the very idea of
wasting time was repugnant, and it was his practice to brighten
the dull patches of occupation by finding a seat in a
magistrate's court and listening, absorbed, to cases which bored
even the court reporter.</p>

<p>John Smith, charged with being drunk and using insulting
language to Police Officer Thomas Brown; Mary Jane Haggitt,
charged with obstructing the police in the execution of their
duty; Henry Robinson, arraigned for being a suspected person,
having in his possession housebreaking tools, to wit, one cold
chisel and a screwdriver; Arthur Moses, charged with driving a
motor-car to the common danger--all these were fascinating
figures of romance and legend to the lean man who sat between the
press and railed dock, his square-crowned hat by his side, his
umbrella gripped between his knees, and on his melancholy face an
expression of startled wonder.</p>

<p>On one raw and foggy morning, Mr. Reeder, self-released from
his duties, chose the Marylebone Police Court for his recreation.
Two drunks, a shop theft and an embezzlement had claimed his rapt
attention, when Mrs. Jackson was escorted to the dock and a
rubicund policeman stepped to the witness stand, and, swearing by
his Deity that he would tell the truth and nothing but the truth,
related his peculiar story.</p>

<p>'P.C. Ferryman No. 9717 L. Division,' he introduced himself
conventionally. 'I was on duty in the Edgware Road early this
morning at 2.30 a.m. when I saw the prisoner carrying a large
suit-case. On seeing me she turned round and walked rapidly in
the opposite direction. Her movements being suspicious, I
followed and, overtaking her, asked her whose property she was
carrying. She told me it was her own and that she was going to
catch a train. She said that the case contained her clothes. As
the case was a valuable one of crocodile leather I asked her to
show me the inside. She refused. She also refused to give me her
name and address and I asked her to accompany me to the
station.'</p>

<p>There followed a detective sergeant.</p>

<p>'I saw the prisoner at the station and in her presence opened
the case. It contained a considerable quantity of small stone
chips&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Stone chips?' interrupted the incredulous magistrate. 'You
mean small pieces of stone&mdash;what kind of stone?'</p>

<p>'Marble, your worship. She said that she wanted to make a
little path in her garden and that she had taken them from the
yard of a monumental mason in the Euston Road. She made a frank
statement to the effect that she had broken open a gate into the
yard and filled the suit-case without the mason's knowledge.'</p>

<p>The magistrate leant back in his chair and scrutinised the
charge sheet with a frown.</p>

<p>'There is no address against her name,' he said.</p>

<p>'She gave an address, but it was false, your worship&mdash;she
refuses to offer any further information.'</p>

<p>Mr. J.G. Reeder had screwed round in his seat and was staring
open-mouthed at the prisoner. She was tall, broad-shouldered and
stoutly built. The hand that rested on the rail of the dock was
twice the size of any woman's hand he had ever seen. The face was
modelled largely, but though there was something in her
appearance which was almost repellent, she was handsome in her
large way. Deep-set brown eyes, a nose that was large and
masterful, a well-shaped mouth and two chins&mdash;these in
profile were not attractive to one who had his views on beauty in
women, but Mr. J.G. Reeder, being a fair man, admitted that she
was a fine-looking woman. When she spoke it was in a voice as
deep as a man's, sonorous and powerful.</p>

<p>'I admit it was a fool thing to do. But the idea occurred to
me just as I was going to bed and I acted on the impulse of the
moment. I could well afford to buy the stone&mdash;I had over
fifty pounds in my pocket-book when I was arrested.'</p>

<p>'Is that true?' and, when the officer answered, the magistrate
turned his suspicious eyes to the woman. 'You are giving us a lot
of trouble because you will not tell your name and address. I can
understand that you do not wish your friends to know of your
stupid theft, but unless you give me the information, I shall be
compelled to remand you in custody for a week.'</p>

<p>She was well, if plainly, dressed. On one large finger flashed
a diamond which Mr. Reeder mentally priced in the region of two
hundred pounds. 'Mrs. Jackson' was shaking her head as he
looked.</p>

<p>'I can't give you my address,' she said, and the magistrate
nodded curtly.</p>

<p>'Remanded for inquiry,' he said, and added, as she walked out
of the dock: 'I should like a report from the prison doctor on
the state of her mind.'</p>

<p>Mr. J.G. Reeder rose quickly from his chair and followed the
woman and the officer in charge of the case through the little
door that leads to the cells.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Jackson' had disappeared by the time he reached the
corridor, but the detective-sergeant was stooping over the large
and handsome suit-case that he had shown in court and was now
laying on a form.</p>

<p>Most of the outdoor men of the C.I.D. knew Mr. J.G. Reeder,
and Sergeant Mills grinned a cheerful welcome.</p>

<p>'What do you think of that one, Mr. Reeder? It is certainly a
new line on me! Never heard of a tombstone artist being burgled
before.'</p>

<p>He opened the top of the case, and Mr. Reeder ran his fingers
through the marble chips.</p>

<p>'The case and the loot weighs over a hundred pounds,' said the
officer. 'She must have the strength of a navvy to carry it. The
poor officer who carried it to the station was hot and melting
when he arrived.'</p>

<p>Mr. J.G. was inspecting the case. It was a handsome article,
the hinges and locks being of oxidised silver. No maker's name
was visible on the inside, or owner's initials on its glossy lid.
The lining had once been of silk, but now hung in shreds and was
white with marble dust.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Mr. Reeder absently, 'very interesting&mdash;most
interesting. Is it permissible to ask whether, when she was
searched, any&mdash;er&mdash;document?' The sergeant shook his
head. 'Or unusual possession?'</p>

<p>'Only these.'</p>

<p>By the side of the case was a pair of large gloves. These also
were soiled, and their surfaces cut in a hundred places.</p>

<p>'These have been used frequently for the same purpose,'
murmured Mr. J.G. 'She evidently makes&mdash;er&mdash;a
collection of marble shavings. Nothing in her pocket-book?'</p>

<p>'Only the bank-notes: they have the stamp of the Central Bank
on their backs. We should be able to trace 'em easily.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder returned to his office and, locking the door,
produced a worn pack of cards from a drawer and played
patience&mdash;which was his method of thinking intensively. Late
in the afternoon his telephone bell rang, and he recognised the
voice of Sergeant Mills.</p>

<p>'Can I come along and see you? Yes, it is about the bank-notes.'</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the sergeant presented himself.</p>

<p>'The notes were issued three months ago to Mr. Telfer,' said
the officer without preliminary, 'and they were given by him to
his housekeeper, Mrs. Welford.'</p>

<p>'Oh, indeed?' said Mr. Reeder softly, and added, after
reflection: 'Dear me!'</p>

<p>He pulled hard at his lip.</p>

<p>'And is "Mrs. Jackson" that lady?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes. Telfer&mdash;poor little devil&mdash;nearly went mad
when I told him she was under remand&mdash;dashed up to Holloway
in a taxi to identify her. The magistrate has granted bail, and
she'll be bound over to-morrow. Telfer was bleating like a
child&mdash;said she was mad. Gosh! that fellow is scared of
her&mdash;when I took him into the waiting-room at Holloway
Prison she gave him one look and he wilted. By the way, we have
had a hint about Billingham that may interest you. Do you know
that he and Telfer's secretary were very good friends?'</p>

<p>'Really?' Mr. Reeder was indeed interested. 'Very good
friends? Well, well!'</p>

<p>'The Yard has put Miss Belman under general observation: there
may be nothing to it, but in cases like Billingham's it is very
often a matter of cherchez la femme.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder had given his lip a rest and was now gently
massaging his nose.</p>

<p>'Dear me!' he said. 'That is a French expression, is it
not?'</p>

<p>He was not in court when the marble stealer was sternly
admonished by the magistrate and discharged. All that interested
Mr. J.G. Reeder was to learn that the woman had paid the mason
and had carried away her marble chips in triumph to the pretty
little detached residence in the Outer Circle of Regent's Park.
He had spent the morning at Somerset House, examining copies of
wills and the like; his afternoon he gave up to the tracing of
Mrs. Rebecca Alamby Mary Welford.</p>

<p>She was the relict of Professor John Welford of the University
of Edinburgh, and had been left a widow after two years of
marriage. She had then entered the service of Mrs. Telfer, the
mother of Sidney, and had sole charge of the boy from his fourth
year. When Mrs. Telfer died she had made the woman sole guardian
of her youthful charge. So that Rebecca Welford had been by turns
nurse and guardian, and was now in control of the young man's
establishment.</p>

<p>The house occupied Mr. Reeder's attention to a considerable
degree. It was a red-brick modern dwelling consisting of two
floors and having a frontage on the Circle and a side road.
Behind and beside the house was a large garden which, at this
season of the year, was bare of flowers. They were probably in
snug quarters for the winter, for there was a long green-house
behind the garden.</p>

<p>He was leaning over the wooden palings, eyeing the grounds
through the screen of box hedge that overlapped the fence with a
melancholy stare, when he saw a door open and the big woman come
out. She was bare-armed and wore an apron. In one hand she
carried a dust box, which she emptied into a concealed ash-bin,
in the other was a long broom.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder moved swiftly out of sight. Presently the door
slammed and he peeped again. There was no evidence of a marble
path. All the walks were of rolled gravel.</p>

<p>He went to a neighbouring telephone booth, and called his
office.</p>

<p>'I may be away all day,' he said.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Mr. Sidney Telfer, though the detective
knew that he was in the house.</p>

<p>Telfer's Trust was in the hands of the liquidators, and the
first meeting of creditors had been called. Sidney had, by all
accounts, been confined to his bed, and from that safe refuge had
written a note to his secretary asking that 'all papers relating
to my private affairs' should be burnt. He had scrawled a
postscript: 'Can I possibly see you on business before I go?' The
word 'go' had been scratched out and 'retire' substituted. Mr.
Reeder had seen that letter&mdash;indeed, all correspondence
between Sidney and the office came to him by arrangement with the
liquidators. And that was partly why Mr. J.G. Reeder was so
interested in 904, The Circle.</p>

<p>It was dusk when a big car drew up at the gate of the house.
Before the driver could descend from his seat, the door of 904
opened, and Sidney Telfer almost ran out. He carried a suit-case
in each hand, and Mr. Reeder recognised that nearest him as the
grip in which the housekeeper had carried the stolen marble.</p>

<p>Reaching over, the chauffeur opened the door of the machine
and, flinging in the bags, Sidney followed hastily. The door
closed, and the car went out of sight round the curve of the
Circle.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder crossed the road and took up a position very near
the front gate, waiting.</p>

<p>Dusk came and the veil of a Regent's Park fog. The house was
in darkness, no flash of light except a faint glimmer that burnt
in the hall, no sound. The woman was still there&mdash;Mrs.
Sidney Telfer, nurse, companion, guardian and wife. Mrs. Sidney
Telfer, the hidden director of Telfers Consolidated, a masterful
woman who, not content with marrying a weakling twenty years her
junior, had applied her masterful but ill-equipped mind to the
domination of a business she did not understand, and which she
was destined to plunge into ruin. Mr. Reeder had made good use of
his time at the Records Office: a copy of the marriage
certificate was almost as easy to secure as a copy of the
will.</p>

<p>He glanced round anxiously. The fog was clearing, which was
exactly what he did not wish it to do, for he had certain acts to
perform which required as thick a cloaking as possible.</p>

<p>And then a surprising thing happened. A cab came slowly along
the road and stopped at the gate.</p>

<p>'I think this is the place, miss,' said the cabman, and a girl
stepped down to the pavement.</p>

<p>It was Miss Margaret Belman.</p>

<p>Reeder waited until she had paid the fare and the cab had
gone, and then, as she walked towards the gate, he stepped from
the shadow.</p>

<p>'Oh!&mdash;Mr. Reeder, how you frightened me!' she gasped. 'I
am going to see Mr. Telfer&mdash;he is dangerously ill&mdash;no,
it was his housekeeper who wrote asking me to come at seven.'</p>

<p>'Did she now! Well, I will ring the bell for you.'</p>

<p>She told him that that was unnecessary&mdash;she had the key
which had come with the note.</p>

<p>'She is alone in the house with Mr. Telfer, who refuses to
allow a trained nurse near him,' said Margaret, 'and&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Will you be good enough to lower your voice, young lady?'
urged Mr. Reeder in an impressive whisper. 'Forgive the
impertinence, but if our friend is ill&mdash;'</p>

<p>She was at first startled by his urgency.</p>

<p>'He couldn't hear me,' she said, but spoke in a lower
tone.</p>

<p>'He may&mdash;sick people are very sensitive to the human
voice. Tell me, how did this letter come?'</p>

<p>'From Mr. Telfer? By district messenger an hour ago.'</p>

<p>Nobody had been to the house or left it&mdash;except Sidney.
And Sidney, in his blind fear, would carry out any instructions
which his wife gave to him.</p>

<p>'And did it contain a passage like this?' Mr. Reeder
considered a moment. '"Bring this letter with you"?'</p>

<p>'No,' said the girl in surprise, 'but Mrs. Welford telephoned
just before the letter arrived and told me to wait for it. And
she asked me to bring the letter with me because she didn't wish
Mr. Telfer's private correspondence to be left lying around. But
why do you ask me this, Mr. Reeder&mdash;is anything wrong?'</p>

<p>He did not answer immediately. Pushing open the gate, he
walked noiselessly along the grass plot that ran parallel with
the path.</p>

<p>'Open the door, I will come in with you,' he whispered and,
when she hesitated: 'Do as I tell you, please.'</p>

<p>The hand that put the key into the lock trembled, but at last
the key turned and the door swung open. A small night-light burnt
on the table of the wide panelled hall. On the left, near the
foot of the stairs, only the lower steps of which were visible,
Reeder saw a narrow door which stood open, and, taking a step
forward, saw that it was a tiny telephone-room.</p>

<p>And then a voice spoke from the upper landing, a deep, booming
voice that he knew.</p>

<p>'Is that Miss Belman?'</p>

<p>Margaret, her heart beating faster, went to the foot of the
stairs and looked up.</p>

<p>'Yes, Mrs. Welford.'</p>

<p>'You brought the letter with you?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder crept along the wall until he could have touched
the girl.</p>

<p>'Good,' said the deep voice. 'Will you call the
doctor&mdash;Circle 743&mdash;and tell him that Mr. Telfer has
had a relapse&mdash;you will find the booth in the hall: shut the
door behind you, the bell worries him.'</p>

<p>Margaret looked at the detective and he nodded.</p>

<p>The woman upstairs wished to gain time for
something&mdash;what?</p>

<p>The girl passed him: he heard the thud of the padded door
close, and there was a click that made him spin round. The first
thing he noticed was that there was no handle to the door, the
second that the keyhole was covered by a steel disc, which he
discovered later was felt-lined. He heard the girl speaking
faintly, and put his ear to the keyhole.</p>

<p>'The instrument is disconnected&mdash;I can't open the
door.'</p>

<p>Without a second's hesitation, he flew up the stairs, umbrella
in hand, and as he reached the landing he heard a door close with
a crash. Instantly he located the sound. It came from a room on
the left immediately over the hall. The door was locked.</p>

<p>'Open this door,' he commanded, and there came to him the
sound of a deep laugh.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder tugged at the stout handle of his umbrella. There
was a flicker of steel as he dropped the lower end, and in his
hand appeared six inches of knife blade.</p>

<p>The first stab at the panel sliced through the thin wood as
though it were paper. In a second there was a jagged gap through
which the black muzzle of an automatic was thrust.</p>

<p>'Put down that jug or I will blow your features into
comparative chaos!' said Mr. Reeder pedantically.</p>

<p>The room was brightly lit, and he could see plainly. Mrs.
Welford stood by the side of a big square funnel, the narrow end
of which ran into the floor. In her hand was a huge enamelled
iron jug, and ranged about her were six others. In one corner of
the room was a wide circular tank, and beyond, at half its
height, depended a large copper pipe.</p>

<p>The woman's face turned to him was blank, expressionless.</p>

<p>'He wanted to run away with her,' she said simply, 'and after
all I have done for him!'</p>

<p>'Open the door.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Welford set down the jug and ran her huge hand across her
forehead.</p>

<p>'Sidney is my own darling,' she said. 'I've nursed him, and
taught him, and there was a million&mdash;all in gold&mdash;in
the ship. But they robbed him.'</p>

<p>She was talking of one of the ill-fated enterprises of Telfers
Consolidated Trust&mdash;that sunken treasure ship to recover
which the money of the company had been poured out like water.
And she was mad. He had guessed the weakness of this domineering
woman from the first.</p>

<p>'Open the door; we will talk it over. I'm perfectly sure that
the treasure ship scheme was a sound one.'</p>

<p>'Are you?' she asked eagerly, and the next minute the door was
open and Mr. J.G. Reeder was in that room of death.</p>

<p>'First of all, let me have the key of the telephone-room&mdash;you are quite wrong about that young lady: she is my
wife.'</p>

<p>The woman stared at him blankly.</p>

<p>'Your wife?' A slow smile transfigured the face. 'Why&mdash;I
was silly. Here is the key.'</p>

<p>He persuaded her to come downstairs with him, and when the
frightened girl was released, he whispered a few words to her,
and she flew out of the house.</p>

<p>'Shall we go into the drawing-room?' he asked, and Mrs.
Welford led the way.</p>

<p>'And now will you tell me how you knew&mdash;about the jugs?'
he asked gently.</p>

<p>She was sitting on the edge of a sofa, her hands clasped on
her knees, her deep-set eyes staring at the carpet.</p>

<p>'John&mdash;that was my first husband&mdash;told me. He was a
professor of chemistry and natural science, and also about the
electric furnace. It is so easy to make if you have
power&mdash;we use nothing but electricity in this house for
heating and everything. And then I saw my poor darling being
ruined through me, and I found how much money there was in the
bank, and I told Billingham to draw it and bring it to me without
Sidney knowing. He came here in the evening. I sent Sidney
away&mdash;to Brighton, I think. I did everything&mdash;put the
new lock on the telephone box and fixed the shaft from the roof
to the little room&mdash;it was easy to disperse everything with
all the doors open and an electric fan working on the
floor&mdash;'</p>

<p>She was telling him about the improvised furnace in the green-house when the police arrived with the divisional surgeon, and
she went away with them, weeping because there would be nobody to
press Sidney's ties or put out his shirts.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder took the inspector up to the little room and showed
him its contents.</p>

<p>'This funnel leads to the telephone box&mdash;' he began.</p>

<p>'But the jugs are empty,' interrupted the officer.</p>

<p>Mr. J.G. Reeder struck a match and, waiting until it burnt
freely, lowered it into the jug. Half an inch lower than the rim
the light went out.</p>

<p>'Carbon monoxide,' he said, 'which is made by steeping marble
chips in hydrochloric acid&mdash;you will find the mixture in the
tank. The gas is colourless and odourless&mdash;and heavy. You
can pour it out of a jug like water. She could have bought the
marble, but was afraid of arousing suspicion. Billingham was
killed that way. She got him to go to the telephone box, probably
closed the door on him herself, and then killed him
painlessly.'</p>

<p>'What did she do with the body?' asked the horrified
officer.</p>

<p>'Come out into the hot-house,' said Mr. Reeder, 'and pray do
not expect to see horrors: an electric furnace will dissolve a
diamond to its original elements.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder went home that night in a state of mental
perturbation, and for an hour paced the floor of his large study
in Brockley Road.</p>

<p>Over and over in his mind he turned one vital problem: did he
owe an apology to Margaret Belman for saying that she was his
wife?</p>

MELODRAMA</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was Mr. Reeder who planned the raid on Tommy
Fenalow's snide shop and worked out all the details except the
composition of the raiding force. Tommy had a depot at Golders
Green whither trusted agents came, purchasing Treasury notes for
£7 10s. per hundred, or £70 a thousand. Only experts could tell
the difference between Tommy's currency and that authorised by
and printed for H.M. Treasury. They were the right shades of
brown and green, the numbers were of issued series, the paper was
exact. They were printed in Germany at £3 a thousand, and Tommy
made thousands per cent. profit.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder discovered all about Tommy's depot in his spare
time, and reported the matter to his chief, the Director of
Public Prosecutions. From Whitehall to Scotland Yard is two
minutes' walk, and in just that time the information got
across.</p>

<p>'Take Inspector Greyash with you and superintend the raid,'
were his instructions.</p>

<p>He left the inspector to make all the arrangements, and
amongst those who learnt of the projected coup was a certain
detective officer who made more money from questionable
associations than he did from Government. This officer 'blew' the
raid to Tommy, and when Mr. Reeder and his bold men arrived at
Golders Green, there was Tommy and three friends playing a quiet
game of auction bridge, and the only Treasury notes discoverable
were veritable old masters.</p>

<p>'It is a pity,' sighed J.G. when they reached the street; 'a
great pity. Of course I hadn't the least idea that Detective-Constable Wilshore was in our party. He is&mdash;er&mdash;not
quite loyal.'</p>

<p>'Wilshore?' asked the officer, aghast. 'Do you mean he "blew"
the raid to Tommy?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder scratched his nose and said gently, that he thought
so.</p>

<p>'He has quite a big income from various sources&mdash;by the
way, he banks with the Midland and Derbyshire, and his account is
in his wife's maiden name. I tell you this in
case&mdash;er&mdash;it may be useful.'</p>

<p>It was useful enough to secure the summary ejection of the
unfaithful Wilshore from the force, but it was not sufficiently
useful to catch Tommy, whose parting words were:</p>

<p>'You're clever, Reeder; but you've got to be lucky to catch
me!'</p>

<p>Tommy was in the habit of repeating this scrap of conversation
to such as were interested. It was an encounter of which he was
justifiably proud, for few dealers in 'slush' and 'snide' have
ever come up against Mr. J.G. and got away with it.</p>

<p>'It's worth a thousand pounds to me&mdash;ten thousand! I'd
pay that money to make J.G. look sick, anyway, the old dog! I
guess the Yard will think twice before it tries to shop me again,
and that's the real kick in the raid. J.G.'s name is Jonah at
head-quarters, and if I can do anything to help, it will be
mud!'</p>

<p>To a certain Ras Lal Punjabi, an honoured (and paying) guest,
Mr. Fenalow told this story, with curious results.</p>

<p>A good wine tastes best in its own country, and a man may
drink sherry by the cask in Jerez de la Frontena and take no ill,
whereas if he attempted so much as a bottle in Fleet Street, he
would suffer cruelly. So also does the cigarette of Egypt
preserve its finest bouquet for such as smoke it in the lounge of
a Cairo hotel.</p>

<p>Crime is yet another quantity which does not bear
transplanting. The American safe-blower may flourish in France
just so long as he acquires by diligent study, and confines
himself to, the Continental method. It is possible for the
European thief to gain a fair livelihood in oriental countries,
but there is no more tragic sight in the world than the Eastern
mind endeavouring to adapt itself to the complexities of European
roguery.</p>

<p>Ras Lal Punjabi enjoyed a reputation in Indian police circles
as the cleverest native criminal India had ever produced. Beyond
a short term in Poona Jail, Ras Lal had never seen the interior
of a prison, and such was his fame in native circles that, during
this short period of incarceration, prayers for his deliverance
were offered at certain temples, and it was agreed that he would
never have been convicted at all but for some pretty hard
swearing on the part of the police commissioner sahib&mdash;and
anyway, all sahibs hang together, and it was a European judge who
sent him down.</p>

<p>He was a general practitioner of crime, with a leaning towards
specialisation in jewel thefts. A man of excellent and even
gentlemanly appearance, with black and shiny hair parted at the
side and curling up over one brow in an inky wave, he spoke
English, Hindustani and Tamil very well indeed, had a sketchy
knowledge of the law (on his visiting cards was the inscription
'Failed LL.B.') and a very full acquaintance with the science of
precious stones.</p>

<p>During Mr. Ras Las Punjabi's brief rest in Poona, the police
commissioner sahib, whose unromantic name was Smith, married a
not very good-looking girl with a lot of money. Smith Sahib knew
that beauty was only skin deep and that she had a kind heart,
which is notoriously preferable to the garniture of coronets. It
was honestly a love match. Her father owned jute mills in
Calcutta, and on festive occasions, such as the Governor-General's ball, she carried several lakhs of rupees on her
person; but even rich people are loved for themselves alone.</p>

<p>Ras Lal owed his imprisonment to an unsuccessful attempt he
had made upon two strings of pearls the property of the lady in
question, and when he learnt, on his return to freedom, that
Smith Sahib had married the resplendent girl and had gone to
England, he very naturally attributed the hatred and bitterness
of Smith Sahib to purely personal causes, and swore
vengeance.</p>

<p>Now in India the business of every man is the business of his
servants. The preliminary inquiries, over which an English or
American jewel thief would spend a small fortune, can be made at
the cost of a few annas. When Ras Lal came to England he found
that he had overlooked this very important fact.</p>

<p>Smith, sahib and memsahib, were out of town; they were, in
fact, on the high seas en route for New York when Ras Lal was
arrested on the conventional charge of 'being a suspected
person.' Ras had shadowed the Smiths' butler, and, having induced
him to drink, had offered him immense sums to reveal the place,
receptacle, drawer, safe, box or casket wherein 'Mrs.
Commissioner Smith's' jewels were kept. His excuse for asking,
namely, that he had had a wager with his brother that the jewels
were kept under the Memsahib's bed, showed a lamentable lack of
inventive power. The butler, an honest man, though a drinker of
beer, informed the police. Ras Lal and his friend and assistant
Ram were arrested, brought before a magistrate, and would have
been discharged but for the fact that Mr. J.G. Reeder saw the
record of the case and was able to supply from his own files very
important particulars of the dark man's past. Therefore Mr. Ras
Lal was sent down to hard labour for six months, but, what was
more maddening, the story of his ignominious failure was, he
guessed, broadcast throughout India.</p>

<p>This was the thought which distracted him in his lonely cell
at Wormwood Scrubbs. What would India think of him?&mdash;he
would be the scorn of the bazaars, 'the mocking point of third-rate mediocrities,' to use his own expression. And automatically
he switched his hate from Smith Sahib to one Mr. J.G. Reeder. And
his hate was very real, more real because of the insignificance
and unimportance of this Reeder Sahib, whom he likened to an
ancient cow, a sneaking weasel, and other things less
translatable. And in the six months of his durance he planned
desperate and earnest acts of reprisal.</p>

<p>Released from prison, he decided that the moment was not ripe
for a return to India. He wished to make a close study of Mr.
J.G. Reeder and his habits, and, being a man with plenty of
money, he could afford the time, and, as it happened, could mix
business with pleasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Tommy Fenalow found means of getting in touch with the
gentleman from the Orient whilst he was in Wormwood Scrubbs, and
the handsome limousine that met Ras Lal at the gates of the
Scrubbs when he came out of jail was both hired and occupied by
Tommy, a keen business man, who had been offered by his German
printer a new line of one-hundred-rupee notes that might easily
develop into a most profitable side-line.</p>

<p>'You come along and lodge at my expense, boy,' said the
sympathetic Tommy, who was very short, very stout, and had eyes
that bulged like a pug dog's. 'You've been badly treated by old
Reeder, and I'm going to tell you a way of getting back on him,
with no risk and a ninety per cent profit. Listen, a friend of
mine&mdash;'</p>

<p>It was never Tommy who had snide for sale: invariably the
hawker of forged notes was a mysterious 'friend.'</p>

<p>So Ras was lodged in a service flat which formed part of a
block owned by Mr. Fenalow, who was a very rich man indeed. Some
weeks after this, Tommy crossed St. James's Street to intercept
his old enemy.</p>

<p>'Good morning, Mr. Reeder.'</p>

<p>Mr. J.G. Reeder stopped and turned back.</p>

<p>'Good morning, Mr. Fenalow,' he said, with that benevolent
solicitude which goes so well with a frock coat and square-toed
shoes. 'I am glad to see that you are out again, and I do trust
that you will now find a more&mdash;er&mdash;legitimate outlet
for your undoubted talents.'</p>

<p>Tommy went angrily red.</p>

<p>'I haven't been in "stir" and you know it, Reeder! It wasn't
for want of trying on your part. But you've got to be something
more than clever to catch me&mdash;you've got to be lucky! Not
that there's anything to catch me over&mdash;I've never done a
crook thing in my life, as you well know.'</p>

<p>He was so annoyed that the lighter exchanges of humour he had
planned slipped from his memory.</p>

<p>He had an appointment with Ras Lal, and the interview was
entirely satisfactory. Mr. Ras Lal made his way that night to an
uncomfortably situated rendezvous and there met his new
friend.</p>

<p>'This is the last place in the world old man Reeder would
dream of searching,' said Tommy enthusiastically, 'and if he did
he would find nothing. Before he could get into the building, the
stuff would be put out of sight.'</p>

<p>'It is a habitation of extreme convenience,' said Ras Lal.</p>

<p>'It is yours, boy,' replied Tommy magnificently. 'I only keep
this place to get-in and put-out. The stuff's not here for an
hour and the rest of the time the store's empty. As I say, old
man Reeder has gotta be something more than clever&mdash;he's
gotta be lucky!'</p>

<p>At parting he handed his client a key, and with that necessary
instrument tendered a few words of advice and warning.</p>

<p>'Never come here till late. The police patrol passes the end
of the road at ten, one o'clock and four. When are you leaving
for India?'</p>

<p>'On the twenty-third,' said Ras, 'by which time I shall have
uttered a few reprisals on that cad Reeder.'</p>

<p>'I shouldn't like to be in his shoes,' said Tommy, who could
afford to be sycophantic, for he had in his pocket two hundred
pounds' worth of real money which Ras had paid in advance for a
vaster quantity of money which was not so real.</p>

<p>It was a few days after this that Ras Lal went to the Orpheum
Theatre, and it was no coincidence that he went there on the same
night that Mr. Reeder escorted a pretty lady to the same place of
amusement.</p>

<p>When Mr. J.G. Reeder went to the theatre (and his going at all
was contingent upon his receiving a complimentary ticket) he
invariably chose a melodrama, and preferably a Drury Lane
melodrama, where to the thrill of the actors' speeches was added
the amazing action of wrecked railway trains, hair-raising
shipwrecks and terrific horse-races in which the favourite won by
a nose. Such things may seem wildly improbable to blase dramatic
critics&mdash;especially favourites winning&mdash;but Mr. Reeder
saw actuality in all such presentations.</p>

<p>Once he was inveigled into sitting through a roaring farce,
and was the only man in the house who did not laugh. He was,
indeed, such a depressing influence that the leading lady sent a
passionate request to the manager that 'the miserable-looking old
man in the middle of the front row' should have his money
returned and be requested to leave the theatre. Which, as Mr.
Reeder had come in on a free ticket, placed the manager in a very
awkward predicament.</p>

<p>Invariably he went unaccompanied, for he had no friends, and
fifty-two years had come and gone without bringing to his life
romance or the melting tenderness begot of dreams. In some manner
Mr. Reeder had become acquainted with a girl who was like no
other girl with whom he had been brought into contact. Her name
was Belman, Margaret Belman, and he had saved her life, though
this fact did not occur to him as frequently as the recollection
that he had imperilled that life before he had saved it. And he
had a haunting sense of guilt for quite another reason.</p>

<p>He was thinking of her one day&mdash;he spent his life
thinking about people, though the majority of these were less
respectable than Miss Margaret Belman. He supposed that she would
marry the very good-looking young man who met her street car at
the corner of the Embankment every morning and returned with her
to the Lewisham High Road every night. It would be a very nice
wedding, with hired motor-cars, and the vicar himself performing
the ceremony, and a wedding breakfast provided by the local
caterer, following which bride and bridegroom would be
photographed on the lawn surrounded by their jovial but
unprepossessing relatives. And after this, one specially hired
car would take them to Eastbourne for an expensive honeymoon. And
after that all the humdrum and scrapings of life, rising through
villadom to a little car of their own and Saturday afternoon
tennis parties.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder sighed deeply. How much more satisfactory was the
stage drama, where all the trouble begins in the first act and is
satisfactorily settled in the last. He fingered absently the two
slips of green paper that had come to him that morning. Row A,
seats 17 and 18. They had been sent by a manager who was under
some obligation to him. The theatre was the Orpheum, home of
transpontine drama, and the play was 'The Fires of Vengeance.' It
looked like being a pleasant evening.</p>

<p>He took an envelope from the rack, addressed it to the box
office, and had begun to write the accompanying letter returning
the surplus voucher, when an idea occurred to him. He owed Miss
Margaret Belman something, and the debt was on his conscience. He
had once, for reasons of expediency, described her as his wife.
This preposterous claim had been made to appease a mad woman, it
is true, but it had been made. She was now holding a good
position&mdash;a secretaryship at one of the political head-quarters, for which post she had to thank Mr. J.G. Reeder, if she
only knew it.</p>

<p>He took up the 'phone and called her number, and, after the
normal delay, heard her voice.</p>

<p>'Er&mdash;Miss Belman,' Mr. Reeder coughed, 'I
have&mdash;er&mdash;two tickets for a theatre tonight. I wonder
if you would care to go?'</p>

<p>Her astonishment was almost audible.</p>

<p>'That is very nice of you, Mr. Reeder. I should love to come
with you.'</p>

<p>Mr. J.G. Reeder turned pale.</p>

<p>'What I mean is, I have two tickets&mdash;I thought perhaps
that your&mdash;er&mdash;your&mdash;er&mdash;that somebody else
would like to go&mdash;what I mean was&mdash;'</p>

<p>He heard a gentle laugh at the other end of the phone.</p>

<p>'What you mean is that you don't wish to take me,' she said,
and for a man of his experience he blundered badly.</p>

<p>'I should esteem it an honour to take you,' he said, in terror
that he should offend her, 'but the truth is, I
thought&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I will meet you at the theatre&mdash;which is it?
Orpheum&mdash;how lovely! At eight o'clock.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder put down the instrument, feeling limp and moist. It
is the truth that he had never taken a lady to any kind of social
function in his life, and as there grew upon him the tremendous
character of this adventure he was overwhelmed and breathless. A
murderer waking from dreams of revelry to find himself in the
condemned cell suffered no more poignant emotions than Mr.
Reeder, torn from the smooth if treacherous currents of life and
drawing nearer and nearer to the horrid vortex of
unusualness.</p>

<p>'Bless me,' said Mr. Reeder, employing a strictly private
expression which was reserved for his own crises.</p>

<p>He employed in his private office a young woman who combined a
meticulous exactness in the filing of documents with a complete
absence of those attractions which turn men into gods, and in
other days set the armies of Perseus moving towards the walls of
Troy. She was invariably addressed by Mr. Reeder as 'Miss.' He
believed her name to be 'Oliver.' She was in truth a married lady
with two children, but her nuptials had been celebrated without
his knowledge.</p>

<p>To the top floor of a building in Regent Street Mr. Reeder
repaired for instruction and guidance.</p>

<p>'It is not&mdash;er&mdash;a practice of mine
to&mdash;er&mdash;accompany ladies to the theatre, and I am
rather at a loss to know what is expected of me, the more so
since the young lady is&mdash;er&mdash;a stranger to me.'</p>

<p>His frosty-visaged assistant sneered secretly. At Mr. Reeder's
time of life, when such natural affections as were not atrophied
should in decency be fossilised!</p>

<p>He jotted down her suggestions.</p>

<p>'Chocolates indeed? Where can one procure &mdash; ? Oh, yes, I
remember seeing the attendants sell them. Thank you so much,
Miss&mdash;er&mdash;'</p>

<p>And as he went out, closing the door carefully behind him, she
sneered openly.</p>

<p>'They all go wrong at seventy,' she said insultingly.</p>

<p>Margaret hardly knew what to expect when she came into the
flamboyant foyer of the Orpheum. What was the evening equivalent
to the square-topped derby and the tightly-buttoned frock coat of
ancient design which he favoured in the hours of business? She
would have passed the somewhat elegantly dressed gentleman in the
correct pique waistcoat and the perfectly tied butterfly bow,
only he claimed her attention.</p>

<p>'Mr. Reeder!' she gasped.</p>

<p>It was indeed Mr. Reeder: with not so much as a shirt-stud
wrong; with a suit of the latest mode, and shoes glossy and V-toed. For Mr. Reeder, like many other men, dressed according to
his inclination in business hours, but accepted blindly the
instructions of his tailor in the matter of fancy raiment. Mr.
J.G. Reeder was never conscious of his clothing, good or
bad&mdash;he was, however, very conscious of his strange
responsibility.</p>

<p>He took her cloak (he had previously purchased programmes and
a large box of chocolates, which he carried by its satin ribbon).
There was a quarter of an hour to wait before the curtain went
up, and Margaret felt it incumbent upon her to offer an
explanation.</p>

<p>'You spoke about "somebody" else; do you mean Roy&mdash;the
man who sometimes meets me at Westminster?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder had meant that young man. 'He and I were good
friends,' she said, 'no more than that&mdash;we aren't very good
friends anymore.'</p>

<p>She did not say why. She might have explained in a sentence if
she had said that Roy's mother held an exalted opinion of her
only son's qualities, physical and mental, and that Roy
thoroughly endorsed his mother's judgment, but she did not.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Mr. Reeder unhappily. Soon after this the orchestra
drowned further conversation, for they were sitting in the first
row near to the noisiest of the brass and not far removed from
the shrillest of the wood-wind. In odd moments, through the
thrilling first act, she stole a glance at her companion. She
expected to find this man mildly amused or slightly bored by the
absurd contrast between the realities which he knew and the
theatricalities which were presented on the stage. But whenever
she looked, he was absorbed in the action of the play; she could
almost feel him tremble when the hero was strapped to a log and
thrown into the boiling mountain stream, and when the stage Jove
was rescued on the fall of the curtain, she heard, with something
like stupefaction, Mr. Reeder's quivering sigh of relief.</p>

<p>'But surely, Mr. Reeder, this bores you?' she protested, when
the lights in the auditorium went up.</p>

<p>'This&mdash;you mean the play&mdash;bore me? Good gracious,
no! I think it is very fine, remarkably fine.'</p>

<p>'But it isn't life, surely? The story is so wildly improbable,
and the incidents&mdash;oh, yes, I'm enjoying it all; please
don't look so worried! Only I thought that you, who knew so much
about criminology&mdash;is that the word?&mdash;would be rather
amused.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was looking very anxiously at her.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid it is not the kind of play&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, but it is&mdash;I love melodrama. But doesn't it strike
you as being&mdash;far-fetched? For instance, that man being
chained to a log, and the mother agreeing to her son's
death?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder rubbed his nose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'The Bermondsey gang chained Harry Salter to a plank, turned
it over and let him down, just opposite Billingsgate Market. I
was at the execution of Tod Rowe, and he admitted it on the
scaffold. And it was "Lee" Pearson's mother who poisoned him at
Teddington to get his insurance money so that she could marry
again. I was at the trial and she took her sentence
laughing&mdash;now what else was there in that act? Oh, yes, I
remember: the proprietor of the saw-mill tried to get the young
lady to marry him by threatening to send her father to prison.
That has been done hundreds of times&mdash;only in a worse way.
There is really nothing very extravagant about a melodrama except
the prices of the seats, and I usually get my tickets free!'</p>

<p>She listened, at first dumbfounded and then with a gurgle of
amusement.</p>

<p>'How queer&mdash;and yet&mdash;well, frankly, I have only met
melodrama once in life, and even now I cannot believe it. What
happens in the next act?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder consulted his programme.</p>

<p>'I rather believe that the young woman in the white dress is
captured and removed to the harem of an Eastern potentate,' he
said precisely, and this time the girl laughed aloud.</p>

<p>'Have you a parallel for that?' she asked triumphantly, and
Mr. Reeder was compelled to admit that he knew no exact parallel,
but&mdash;</p>

<p>'It is rather a remarkable coincidence,' he said, 'a very
remarkable coincidence!'</p>

<p>She looked at her programme, wondering if she had overlooked
anything so very remarkable.</p>

<p>'There is at this moment, watching me from the front row of
the dress circle&mdash;I beg you not to turn your head&mdash;one
who, if he is not a potentate, is undoubtedly Eastern; there are,
in fact, two dark-complexioned gentlemen, but only one may be
described as important.'</p>

<p>'But why are they watching you?' she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>'Possibly,' said Mr. Reeder solemnly, 'because I look so
remarkable in evening dress.'</p>

<p>One of the dark-complexioned gentlemen turned to his companion
at this moment.</p>

<p>'It is the woman he travels with every day; she lives in the
same street, and is doubtless more to him than anybody in the
world, Ram. See how she laughs in his face and how the old so-and-so looks at her! When men come to his great age they grow
silly about women. This thing can be done to-night. I would
sooner die than go back to Bombay without accomplishing my design
upon this such-and-such and so-forth.'</p>

<p>Ram, his chauffeur, confederate and fellow jail-bird, who was
cast in a less heroic mould, and had, moreover, no personal
vendetta, suggested in haste that the matter should be thought
over.</p>

<p>'I have cogitated every hypothesis to its logical
conclusions,' said Ras Lal in English.</p>

<p>'But, master,' said his companion urgently, 'would it not be
wise to leave this country and make a fortune with the new money
which the fat little man can sell to us?'</p>

<p>'Vengeance is mine,' said Ras Lal in English.</p>

<p>He sat through the next act which, as Mr. Reeder had truly
said, depicted the luring of an innocent girl into the hateful
clutches of a Turkish pasha and, watching the development of the
plot, his own scheme underwent revision. He did not wait to see
what happened in the third and fourth acts&mdash;there were
certain preparations to be made.</p>

<p>'I still think that, whilst the story is awfully thrilling, it
is awfully impossible,' said Margaret, as they moved slowly
through the crowded vestibule. 'In real life&mdash;in civilised
countries, I mean&mdash;masked men do not suddenly appear from
nowhere with pistols and say "Hands up!"&mdash;not really, do
they, Mr. Reeder?' she coaxed.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder murmured a reluctant agreement.</p>

<p>'But I have enjoyed it tremendously!' she said with
enthusiasm, and looking down into the pink face Mr. Reeder felt a
curious sensation which was not entirely pleasure and not wholly
pain.</p>

<p>'I am very glad,' he said.</p>

<p>Both the dress-circle and the stalls disgorged into the foyer,
and he was looking round for a face he had seen when he arrived.
But neither Ras Lal nor his companion in misfortune was visible.
Rain was falling dismally, and it was some time before he found a
cab.</p>

<p>'Luxury upon luxury,' smiled Margaret, when he took his place
by her side. 'You may smoke if you wish.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder took a paper packet of cigarettes from his
waistcoat pocket, selected a limp cylinder, and lit it.</p>

<p>'No plays are quite like life, my dear young lady,' he said,
as he carefully pushed the match through the space between the
top of the window and the frame. 'Melodramas appeal most to me
because of their idealism.'</p>

<p>She turned and stared at him.</p>

<p>'Idealism?' she repeated incredulously.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>'Have you ever noticed that there is nothing sordid about a
melodrama? I once saw a classical drama&mdash;"Oedipus"&mdash;and
it made me feel sick. In melodrama even the villains are heroic
and the inevitable and unvarying moral is "Truth crushed to earth
will rise again"&mdash;isn't that idealism? And they are
wholesome. There are no sex problems; unpleasant things are never
shown in an attractive light&mdash;you come away uplifted.'</p>

<p>'If you are young enough,' she smiled.</p>

<p>'One should always be young enough to rejoice in the triumph
of virtue,' said Mr. Reeder soberly.</p>

<p>They crossed Westminster Bridge and bore left to the New Kent
Road. Through the rain-blurred windows J.G. picked up the
familiar landmarks and offered a running commentary upon them in
the manner of a guide. Margaret had not realised before that
history was made in South London.</p>

<p>'There used to be a gibbet here&mdash;this ugly-looking goods
station was the London terminus of the first railways&mdash;Queen
Alexandra drove from there when she came to be married&mdash;the
thoroughfare on the right after we pass the Canal bridge is
curiously named Bird-in-Bush Road&mdash;'</p>

<p>A big car had drawn level with the cab, and the driver was
shouting something to the cabman. Even the suspicious Mr. Reeder
suspected no more than an exchange of offensiveness, till the cab
suddenly turned into the road he had been speaking about. The car
had fallen behind, but now drew abreast.</p>

<p>'Probably the main road is up,' said J.G., and at that moment
the cab slowed and stopped.</p>

<p>He was reaching out for the handle when the door was pulled
open violently, and in the uncertain light Mr. Reeder saw a
broad-shouldered man standing in the road.</p>

<p>'Alight quickly!'</p>

<p>In the man's hand was a long, black Colt, and his face was
covered from chin to forehead by a mask.</p>

<p>'Quickly&mdash;and keep your hands erect!'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder stepped out into the rain and reached to close the
door.</p>

<p>'The female also&mdash;come, miss!'</p>

<p>'Here&mdash;what's the game&mdash;you told me the New Cross
Road was blocked.' It was the cabman talking.</p>

<p>'Here is a five&mdash;keep your mouth shut.'</p>

<p>The masked man thrust a note at the driver.</p>

<p>'I don't want your money&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You require my bullet in your bosom perchance, my good
fellow?' asked Ras Lal sardonically.</p>

<p>Margaret had followed her escort into the road by this time.
The car had stopped just behind the cab. With the muzzle of the
pistol stuck into his back, Mr. Reeder walked to the open door
and entered. The girl followed, and the masked man jumped after
them and closed the door. Instantly the interior was flooded with
light.</p>

<p>'This is a considerable surprise to a clever and intelligent
police detective?'</p>

<p>Their captor sat on the opposite seat, his pistol on his
knees. Through the holes of the black mask a pair of brown eyes
gleamed malevolently. But Mr. Reeder's interest was in the girl.
The shock had struck the colour from her face, but he observed
with thankfulness that her chief emotion was not fear. She was
numb with amazement, and was stricken speechless.</p>

<p>The car had circled and was moving swiftly back the way they
had come. He felt the rise of the Canal bridge, and then the
machine turned abruptly to the right and began the descent of a
steep hill. They were running towards Rotherhithe&mdash;he had an
extraordinary knowledge of London's topography.</p>

<p>The journey was a short one. He felt the car wheels bump over
an uneven roadway for a hundred yards, the body rocking
uncomfortably, and then with a jar of brakes the machine stopped
suddenly.</p>

<p>They were on a narrow muddy lane. On one side rose the arches
of a railway aqueduct, on the other an open space bounded by a
high fence. Evidently the driver had pulled up short of their
destination, for they had to squelch and slide through the thick
mud for another fifty yards before they came to a narrow gateway
in the fence. Through this they struck a cinder-path leading to a
square building, which Mr. Reeder guessed was a small factory of
some kind. Their conductor flashed a lamp on the door, and in
weatherworn letters the detective read:</p>

<p>'The Storn-Filton Leather Company.'</p>

<p>'Now!' said the man, as he turned a switch. 'Now, my false-swearing and corrupt police official, I have a slight bill to
settle with you.'</p>

<p>They were in a dusty lobby, enclosed on three sides by
matchboard walls.</p>

<p>'"Account" is the word you want, Ras Lal,' murmured Mr.
Reeder.</p>

<p>For a moment the man was taken aback, and then, snatching the
mask from his face:</p>

<p>'I am Ras Lal! And you shall repent it! For you and for your
young missus this is indeed a cruel night of anxiety!'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder did not smile at the quaint English. The gun in the
man's hand spoke all languages without error, and could be as
fatal in the hands of an unconscious humorist as if it were
handled by the most savage of purists.</p>

<p>And he was worried about the girl: she had not spoken a word
since their capture. The colour had come back to her cheeks, and
that was a good sign. There was, too, a light in her eyes which
Reeder could not associate with fear.</p>

<p>Ras Lal, taking down a long cord that hung on a nail in the
wooden partition, hesitated.</p>

<p>'It is not necessary,' he said, with an elaborate shrug of
shoulder; 'the room is sufficiently reconnoitred&mdash;you will
be innocuous there.'</p>

<p>Flinging open a door, he motioned them to pass through and
mount the bare stairs which faced them. At the top was a landing
and a large steel door set in the solid brickwork.</p>

<p>Pulling back the iron bolt, he pushed at the door, and it
opened with a squeak. It was a large room, and had evidently been
used for the storage of something inflammable, for the walls and
floor were of rough-faced concrete and above a dusty desk an
inscription was painted, 'Danger. Don't smoke in this store.'
There were no windows except one some eighteen inches square, the
top of which was near the ceiling. In one corner of the room was
a heap of grimy paper files, and on the desk a dozen small wooden
boxes, one of which had been opened, for the nail-bristling lid
was canted up at an angle.</p>

<p>'Make yourself content for half an hour or probably forty
minutes,' said Ras Lal, standing in the doorway with his
ostentatious revolver. 'At that time I shall come for your
female; to-morrow she will be on a ship with me, bound
for&mdash;ah, who knows where?'</p>

<p>'Shut the door as you go out,' said Mr. J.G. Reeder; 'there is
an unpleasant draught.'</p>

<p>Mr. Tommy Fenalow came on foot at two o'clock in the morning
and, passing down the muddy lane, his electric torch suddenly
revealed car marks. Tommy stopped like a man shot. His knees
trembled beneath him and his heart entered his throat at the
narrowest end. For a while he was undecided whether it would be
better to run or walk away. He had no intention of going forward.
And then he heard a voice. It was Ras Lal's assistant, and he
nearly swooned with joy. Stumbling forward, he came up to the
shivering man.</p>

<p>'Did that fool boss of yours bring the car along here?' he
asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>'Yas&mdash;Mr. Ras Lal,' said Ram with whom the English
language was not a strong point.</p>

<p>'Then he's a fool!' growled Tommy. 'Gosh! he put my heart in
my mouth!'</p>

<p>Whilst Ram was getting together sufficient English to explain
what had happened, Tommy passed on. He found his client sitting
in the lobby, a black cheroot between his teeth, a smile of
satisfaction on his dark face.</p>

<p>'Welcome!' he said, as Tommy closed the door. 'We have trapped
the weasel.'</p>

<p>'Never mind about the weasel,' said the other impatiently.
'Did you find the rupees?'</p>

<p>Ras Lal shook his head.</p>

<p>'But I left them in the store&mdash;ten thousand notes. I
thought you'd have got them and skipped before this,' said Mr.
Fenalow anxiously.</p>

<p>'I have something more important in the store&mdash;come and
see my friend.'</p>

<p>He preceded the bewildered Tommy up the stairs, turned on the
landing light and threw open the door.</p>

<p>'Behold&mdash;' he said, and said no more.</p>

<p>'Why, it is Mr. Fenalow!' said Mr. J.G.</p>

<p>One hand held a packet of almost life-like rupee notes; as for
the other hand&mdash;</p>

<p>'You oughter known he carried a gun, you dam' black baboon,'
hissed Tommy. 'An' to put him in a room where the stuff was, and
a telephone!'</p>

<p>He was being driven to the local police station, and for the
moment was attached to his companion by links of steel.</p>

<p>'It was a mere jest or a piece of practical joking, as I shall
explain to the judge in the morning,' said Ras airily.</p>

<p>Tommy Fenalow's reply was unprintable.</p>

<p>Three o'clock boomed out from St. John's Church as Mr. Reeder
accompanied an excited girl to the front door of her boarding-house.</p>

<p>'I can't tell you how I&mdash;I've enjoyed tonight,' she
said.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder glanced uneasily at the dark face of the house.</p>

<p>'I hope &mdash; er &mdash; your friends will not think it
remarkable that you should return at such an hour &mdash; '</p>

<p>Despite her assurance, he went slowly home with an uneasy
feeling that her name had in some way been compromised. And in
melodrama, when a heroine's name is compromised, somebody has to
marry her.</p>

<p>That was the disturbing thought that kept Mr. Reeder awake all
night.</p>

MAMBA</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE spirit of exploration has ruined more
promising careers than drink, gambling or the smiles of women.
Generally speaking, the beaten tracks of life are the safest, and
few men have adventured into the uncharted spaces in search of
easy money who have not regarded the discovery of the old hard
road whence they strayed as the greatest of their
achievements.</p>

<p>Mo Liski held an assured position in his world, and one
acquired by the strenuous and even violent exercise of his many
qualities. He might have gone on until the end of the chapter,
only he fell for an outside proposition, and, moreover,
handicapped himself with a private feud, which had its beginning
in an affair wholly remote from his normal operations.</p>

<p>There was a Moorish grafter named El Rahbut, who had made
several visits to England, travelling by the banana boats which
make the round trip from London River to Funchal Bay, Las Palmas,
Tangier and Oporto. He was a very ordinary, yellow-faced Moor,
pock-marked and undersized, and he spoke English, having in his
youth fallen into the hands of a well-meaning American
missionary. This man Rahbut was useful to Mo because quite a lot
of German drugs are shipped via Trieste to the Levant, and many a
crate of oranges has been landed in the Pool that had, squeezed
in their golden interiors, little metal cylinders containing
smuggled saccharine, heroin, cocaine, hydrochlorate and divers
other noxious medicaments.</p>

<p>Rahbut brought such things from time to time, was paid fairly
and was satisfied. One day, in the saloon bar of 'The Four Jolly
Seamen,' he told Mo of a great steal. It had been carried out by
a group of Anghera thieves working in Fez, and the loot was no
less than the Emeralds of Suliman, the most treasured possession
of Morocco. Not even Abdul Aziz in his most impecunious days had
dared to remove them from the Mosque of Omar; the Anghera men
being what they were, broke into the holy house, killed two
guardians of the treasure, and had got away with the nine green
stones of the great king. Thereafter arose an outcry which was
heard from the bazaars of Calcutta to the mean streets of Marsi-Karsi. But the men of Anghera were superior to the voice of
public opinion and they did no more than seek a buyer. El Rahbut,
being a notorious bad character, came into the matter, and this
was the tale he told to Mo Liski at 'The Four Jolly Seamen' one
foggy October night.</p>

<p>'There is a million pesetas profit in this for you and me, Mr.
Good Man,' said Rahbut (all Europeans who paid on the nail were
'Mr. Good Man' to El Rahbut). 'There is also death for me if this
thing becomes known.'</p>

<p>Mo listened, smoothing his chin with a hand that sparkled and
flashed dazzlingly. He was keen on ornamentation. It was a little
outside his line, but the newspapers had stated the bald value of
the stolen property, and his blood was on fire at the prospect of
earning half a million so easily. That Scotland Yard and every
police head-quarters in the world were on the look-out for the
nine stones of Suliman did not greatly disturb him. He knew the
subterranean way down which a polished stone might slide; and if
the worst came to the worst, there was a reward of £5,000 for the
recovery of the jewels.</p>

<p>'I'll think it over; where is the stuff?'</p>

<p>'Here,' said Rahbut, to the other's surprise. 'In
ten&mdash;twenty minutes I could lay them on your hands, Mr. Good
Man.'</p>

<p>Here seemed a straightforward piece of negotiation; it was
doubly unfortunate that at that very period he should find
himself mixed up in an affair which promised no profit
whatever&mdash;the feud of Marylou Plessy, which was to become
his because of his high regard for the lady.</p>

<p>When a woman is bad, she is usually very bad indeed, and
Marylou Plessy was an extremely malignant woman. She was rather
tall and handsome, with black sleek hair, boyishly shingled, and
a heavy black fringe that covered a forehead of some
distinction.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder saw her once: he was at the Central Criminal Court
giving evidence against Bartholomew Xavier Plessy, an ingenious
Frenchman who discovered a new way of making old money. His
forgeries were well-nigh undetectable, but Mr. Reeder was no
ordinary man. He not only detected them, but he traced the
printer, and that was why Bartholomew Xavier faced an
unimpassioned judge, who told him in a hushed voice how very
wrong it was to debase the currency; how it struck at the very
roots of our commercial and industrial life. This the debonair
man in the dock did not resent. He knew all about it. It was the
judge's curt postscript which made him wince.</p>

<p>'You will be kept in penal servitude for twenty years.'</p>

<p>That Marylou loved the man is open to question. The
probabilities are that she did not; but she hated Mr. Reeder, and
she hated him not because he had brought her man to his undoing,
but because, in the course of his evidence, he had used the
phrase 'the woman with whom the prisoner is associated.' And Mr.
John Reeder could have put her beside Plessy in the dock had he
so wished: she knew this too and loathed him for his
mercifulness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Plessy had a large flat in Portland Street. It was in a
block which was the joint property of herself and her husband,
for their graft had been on the grand scale, and Mr. Plessy owned
race-horses before he owned a number in Parkhurst Convict
Establishment. And here Marylou entertained lavishly.</p>

<p>A few months after her husband went to prison, she dined
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with Mo Liski, the biggest of the gang leaders
and an uncrowned emperor of the underworld. He was a small,
dapper man who wore pince-nez and looked rather like a member of
one of the learned professions. Yet he ruled the Strafas and the
Sullivans and the Birklows, and his word was law on a dozen race-tracks, in a score of spieling clubs and innumerable
establishments less liable to police supervision. People opposing
him were incontinently 'coshed'&mdash;rival leaders more or less
paid tribute and walked warily at that. He levied toll upon
bookmakers and was immune from police interference by reason of
their two failures to convict him.</p>

<p>Since there are white specks on the blackest coat, he had this
redeeming feature, that Marylou Plessy was his ideal woman, and
it is creditable in a thief to possess ideals, however unworthily
they may be disposed.</p>

<p>He listened intently to Marylou's views, playing with his thin
watchguard, his eyes on the embroidery of the tablecloth. But
though he loved her, his native caution held him to reason.</p>

<p>'That's all right, Marylou,' he said. 'I dare say I could get
Reeder, but what is going to happen then? There will be a squeak
louder than a bus brake! And he's dangerous. I never worry about
the regular busies, but this old feller is in the Public
Prosecutor's office, and he wasn't put there because he's silly.
And just now I've got one of the biggest deals on that I've ever
touched. Can't you "do" him yourself? You're a clever woman: I
don't know a cleverer.'</p>

<p>'Of course, if you're scared of Reeder &mdash; !' she said
contemptuously, and a tolerant smile twisted his thin lips.</p>

<p>'Me? Don't be silly, dearie! Show him a point yourself. If you
can't get him, let me know. Scared of him! Listen! That old bird
would lose his feathers and be skinned for the pot before you
could say "Mo Liski" if I wanted!'</p>

<p>In the Public Prosecutor's office they had no doubt about Mr.
Reeder's ability to take care of himself, and when Chief
Inspector Pyne came over from the Yard to report that Marylou had
been in conference with the most dangerous man in London, the
Assistant Prosecutor grinned his amusement.</p>

<p>'No&mdash;Reeder wants no protection. I'll tell him if you
like, but he probably knows all about it. What are you people
doing about the Liski crowd?'</p>

<p>Pyne pulled a long face.</p>

<p>'We've had Liski twice, but well organised perjury has saved
him. The Assistant Commissioner doesn't want him again till we
get him with the blood on his hands, so to speak. He's
dangerous.'</p>

<p>The Assistant Prosecutor nodded.</p>

<p>'So is Reeder,' he said ominously. 'That man is a genial
mamba! Never seen a mamba? He's a nice black snake, and you're
dead two seconds after he strikes!'</p>

<p>The chief inspector's smile was one of incredulity.</p>

<p>'He never impressed me that way&mdash;rabbit, yes, but snake,
no!'</p>

<p>Later in the morning a messenger brought Mr. Reeder to the
chief's office, and he arrived with that ineffable air of apology
and diffidence which gave the uninitiated such an altogether
wrong idea of his calibre. He listened with closed eyes whilst
his superior told him of the meeting between Liski and
Marylou.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' he sighed, when the narrative came to an end. 'I
have heard rumours. Liski? He is the person who associates with
unlawful characters? In other days and under more favourable
conditions he would have been the leader of a Florentine faction.
An interesting man. With interesting friends.'</p>

<p>'I hope your interest remains impersonal,' warned the lawyer,
and Mr. Reeder sighed again, opened his mouth to speak,
hesitated, and then: 'Doesn't the continued freedom of Mr. Liski
cast&mdash;um&mdash;a reflection upon our department, sir?' he
asked.</p>

<p>His chief looked up: it was an inspiration which made him
say:</p>

<p>'Get him!'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded very slowly.</p>

<p>'I have often thought that it would be a good idea,' he said.
His gaze deepened in melancholy. 'Liski has many acquaintances of
a curious character,' he said at last. 'Dutchmen, Russians,
Jewish persons&mdash;he knows a Moor.'</p>

<p>The chief looked up quickly.</p>

<p>'A Moor&mdash;you're thinking of the Nine Emeralds? My dear
man, there are hundreds of Moors in London and thousands in
Paris.'</p>

<p>'And millions in Morocco,' murmured Mr. Reeder. 'I only
mention the Moor in passing, sir. As regards my friend Mrs.
Plessy&mdash;I hope only for the best.'</p>

<p>And he melted from the room.</p>

<p>The greater part of a month passed before he showed any
apparent interest in the case. He spent odd hours wandering in
the neighbourhood of Lambeth, and on one occasion he was seen in
the members' enclosure at Hurst Park race-track&mdash;but he
spoke to nobody, and nobody spoke to him.</p>

<p>One night Mr. Reeder came dreamily back to his well-ordered
house in Brockley Road, and found waiting on his table a small
flat box which had arrived, his housekeeper told him, by post
that afternoon. The label was addressed in typewritten characters
'John Reeder, Esq.' and the postmark was Central London.</p>

<p>He cut the thin ribbon which tied it, stripped first the brown
paper and then the silver tissue, and exposed a satiny lid, which
he lifted daintily. There, under a layer of paper shavings, were
roll upon roll of luscious confectionery. Chocolate, with or
without dainty extras, had an appeal for Mr. Reeder, and he took
up a small globule garnished with crystallised violets and
examined it admiringly.</p>

<p>His housekeeper came in at that moment with his tea-tray and
set it down on the table. Mr. Reeder looked over his large
glasses.</p>

<p>'Do you like chocolates, Mrs. Kerrel?' he asked
plaintively.</p>

<p>'Why, yes, sir,' the elderly lady beamed.</p>

<p>'So do I,' said Mr. Reeder. 'So do I!' and he shook his head
regretfully, as he replaced the chocolate carefully in the box.
'Unfortunately,' he went on, 'my doctor&mdash;a very excellent
man&mdash;has forbidden me all sorts of confectionery until they
have been submitted to the rigorous test of the public
analyst.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Kerrel was a slow thinker, but a study of current
advertisement columns in the daily newspaper had enlarged to a
very considerable extent her scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>'To see if there is any vitamines in them, sir?' she
suggested.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder shook his head.</p>

<p>'No, I hardly think so,' he said gently. 'Vitamines are my
sole diet. I can spend a whole evening with no other company than
a pair of these interesting little fellows, and take no ill from
them. Thank you, Mrs. Kerrel.'</p>

<p>When she had gone, he replaced the layer of shavings with
punctilious care, closed down the lid, and as carefully re-wrapped the parcel. When it was finished he addressed the package
to a department at Scotland Yard, took from a small box a label
printed redly 'Poison.' When this was done, he scribbled a note
to the gentleman affected, and addressed himself to his muffins
and his large teacup.</p>

<p>It was a quarter-past six in the evening when he had unwrapped
the chocolates. It was exactly a quarter-past eleven, as he
turned out the lights preparatory to going to bed, that he said
aloud:</p>

<p>'Marylou Plessy&mdash;dear me!'</p>

<p>Here began the war.</p>

<p>This was Wednesday evening; on Friday morning the toilet of
Marylou Plessy was interrupted by the arrival of two men who were
waiting for her when she came into the sitting-room in her
negligee. They talked about fingerprints found on chocolates and
other such matters.</p>

<p>Half an hour later a dazed woman sat in the cells at Harlboro
Street and listened to an inspector's recital of her offence. At
the following sessions she went down for two years on a charge of
'conveying by post to John Reeder a poisonous substance, to wit
aconite, with intent to murder.'</p>

<p>To the last Mo Liski sat in court, his drawn haggard face
testifying to the strength of his affection for the woman in the
dock. After she disappeared from the dock he went outside into
the big, windy hall, and there and then made his first
mistake.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was putting on his woollen gloves when the dapper
man strode up to him.</p>

<p>'Name of Reeder?'</p>

<p>'That is my name, sir.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder surveyed him benevolently over his glasses. He had
the expectant air of one who has steeled himself to receive
congratulations.</p>

<p>'Mine is Mo Liski. You've sent down a friend of
mine&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Mrs. Plessy?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;you know! Reeder, I'm going to get you for
that!'</p>

<p>Instantly somebody behind him caught his arm in a vice and
swung him round. It was a City detective.</p>

<p>'Take a walk with me,' he said.</p>

<p>Mo went white. Remember that he owed the strength of his
position to the fact that never once had he been convicted: the
register did not bear his name.</p>

<p>'What's the charge?' he asked huskily.</p>

<p>'Intimidation of a Crown witness and using threatening
language,' said the officer.</p>

<p>Mo came up before the Aldermen at the Guildhall the next
morning and was sent to prison for three weeks, and Mr. Reeder,
who knew the threat would come and was ready to counter with the
traditional swiftness of the mamba, felt that he had scored a
point. The gang leader was, in the parlance of the law, 'a
convicted person.'</p>

<p>'I don't think anything will happen until he comes out,' he
said to Pyne, when he was offered police protection. 'He will
find a great deal of satisfaction in arranging the details of
my&mdash;um&mdash;"bashing," and I feel sure that he will
postpone action until he is free. I had better have that
protection until he comes out&mdash;'</p>

<p>'After he comes out, you mean?'</p>

<p>'Until he comes out,' insisted Mr. Reeder carefully.
'After&mdash;well&mdash;um&mdash;I'd rather like to be unhampered
by&mdash;um&mdash;police protection.'</p>

<p>Mo Liski came to his liberty with all his senses alert. The
cat-caution which had, with only one break, kept him clear of
trouble, dominated his every plan. Cold-bloodedly he cursed
himself for jeopardising his emerald deal, and his first step was
to get into touch with El Rahbut.</p>

<p>But there was a maddening new factor in his life: the bitter
consciousness of his fallibility and the fear that the men he had
ruled so completely might, in consequence, attempt to break away
from their allegiance. There was something more than sentiment
behind this fear. Mo drew close on fifteen thousand a year from
his racecourse and club-house victims alone. There were pickings
on the side: his 'crowd' largely controlled a continental drug
traffic worth thousands a year. Which may read romantic and
imaginative, but was true. Not all the 'bunce' came to Mo and his
men. There were pickings for the carrion fowl as well as for the
wolves.</p>

<p>He must fix Reeder. That was the first move. And fix him so
that there was no recoil. To beat him up one night would be an
easy matter, but that would look too much like carrying into
execution the threat which had put him behind bars. Obviously
some ingenuity was called for; some exquisite punishment more
poignant than the shock of clubs.</p>

<p>Men of Mr. Liski's peculiar calling do not meet their
lieutenants in dark cellars, nor do they wear cloaks or masks to
disguise their identities. The big six who controlled the
interests serving Mo Liski came together on the night of his
release, and the gathering was at a Soho restaurant, where a
private dining-room was engaged in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>'I'm glad nobody touched him whilst I was away,' said Mo with
a little smile. 'I'd like to manage this game myself. I've been
doing some thinking whilst I was in bird, and there's a good way
to deal with him.'</p>

<p>'He had two coppers with him all the time, or I'd have coshed
him for you, Mo,' said Teddy Alfield, his chief of staff.</p>

<p>'And I'd have coshed you, Teddy,' said Mr. Liski ominously. 'I
left orders that he wasn't to be touched, didn't I? What do you
mean by "you'd have coshed him"?'</p>

<p>Alfield, a big-shouldered man whose speciality was the
'knocking-off' of unattended motor-cars, grew incoherent.</p>

<p>'You stick to your job,' snarled Mo. 'I'll fix Reeder. He's
got a girl in Brockley; a young woman who is always going about
with him&mdash;Belman's her name and she lives nearly opposite
his house. We don't want to beat him up&mdash;yet. What we want
to do is to get him out of his job, and that's easy. They fired a
man in the Home Office last week because he was found at the "95"
Club after drinking hours.'</p>

<p>He outlined a simple plan.</p>

<p>Margaret Belman left her office one evening and, walking to
the corner of Westminster Bridge and the Embankment, looked
around for Mr. Reeder. Usually, if his business permitted, he was
to be found hereabouts, though of late the meetings had been very
few, and when she had seen him he was usually in the company of
two glum men who seated themselves on either side of him.</p>

<p>She let one car pass, and had decided to catch the second
which was coming slowly along the Embankment, when a parcel
dropped at her feet. She looked round to see a pretty, well-dressed woman swaying with closed eyes, and had just time to
catch her by the arm before she half collapsed. With her arm
round the woman's waist she assisted her to a seat providentially
placed hereabouts.</p>

<p>'I'm so sorry&mdash;thank you ever so much. I wonder if you
would call me a taxi?' gasped the fainting lady.</p>

<p>She spoke with a slightly foreign accent, and had the
indefinable manner of a great lady; so Margaret thought.</p>

<p>Beckoning a cab, she assisted the woman to enter.</p>

<p>'Would you like me to go home with you?' asked the sympathetic
girl.</p>

<p>'It would be good of you,' murmured the lady, 'but I fear to
inconvenience you&mdash;it was so silly of me. My address is 105,
Great Claridge Street.'</p>

<p>She recovered sufficiently on the journey to tell Margaret
that she was Madame Lemaire, and that she was the widow of a
French banker. The beautiful appointments of the big house in the
most fashionable part of Mayfair suggested that Madame Lemaire
was a woman of some wealth. A butler opened the door, a liveried
footman brought in the tea which Madame insisted on the girl
taking with her.</p>

<p>'You are too good. I cannot be thankful enough to you,
mademoiselle. I must know you better. Will you come one night to
dinner? Shall we say Thursday?'</p>

<p>Margaret Belman hesitated. She was human enough to be
impressed by the luxury other surroundings, and this dainty lady
had the appeal of refinement and charm which is so difficult to
resist.</p>

<p>'We will dine <i>tête-à-tête</i>, and after&mdash;some people
may come for dancing. Perhaps you have a friend you would like to
come?'</p>

<p>Margaret smiled and shook her head. Curiously enough, the word
'friend' suggested only the rather awkward figure of Mr. Reeder,
and somehow she could not imagine Mr. Reeder in this setting.</p>

<p>When she came out into the street and the butler had closed
the door behind her, she had the first shock of the day. The
object of her thoughts was standing on the opposite side of the
road, a furled umbrella hooked to his arm.</p>

<p>'Why, Mr. Reeder!' she greeted him.</p>

<p>'You had seven minutes to spare,' he said, looking at his big-faced watch. 'I gave you half an hour&mdash;you were exactly
twenty-three minutes and a few odd seconds.'</p>

<p>'Did you know I was there?' she asked unnecessarily.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;I followed you. I do not like Mrs. Annie
Feltham&mdash;she calls herself Madame something or other. It is
not a nice club.'</p>

<p>'Club!' she gasped.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>'They call it the Muffin Club. Curious name&mdash;curious
members. It is not nice.'</p>

<p>She asked no further questions, but allowed herself to be
escorted to Brockley, wondering just why Madame had picked upon
her as a likely recruit to the gaieties of Mayfair.</p>

<p>And now occurred the succession of incidents which at first
had so puzzled Mr. Liski. He was a busy man, and almost regretted
that he had not postponed putting his plan of operation into
movement. That he had failed in one respect he discovered when by
accident, as it seemed, he met Mr. Reeder face to face in
Piccadilly.</p>

<p>'Good morning, Liski,' said Mr. Reeder, almost apologetically.
'I was so sorry for that unfortunate contretemps, but believe me,
I bear no malice. And whilst I realise that in all probability
you do not share my sentiments, I have no other wish than to live
on the friendliest terms with you.'</p>

<p>Liski looked at him sharply. The old man was getting scared,
he thought. There was almost a tremble in his anxious voice when
he put forward the olive branch.</p>

<p>'That's all right, Mr. Reeder,' said Mo, with his most
charming smile. 'I don't bear any malice either. After all, it
was a silly thing to say, and you have your duty to do.'</p>

<p>He went on in this strain, stringing platitude to platitude,
and Mr. Reeder listened with evidence of growing relief.</p>

<p>'The world is full of sin and trouble,' he said, shaking his
head sadly; 'both in high and low places vice is triumphant, and
virtue thrust, like the daisies, underfoot. You don't keep
chickens, do you, Mr. Liski?'</p>

<p>Mo Liski shook his head.</p>

<p>'What a pity!' sighed Mr. Reeder. 'There is so much one can
learn from the domestic fowl! They are an object lesson to the
unlawful. I often wonder why the Prison Commissioners do not
allow the convicts at Dartmoor to engage in this harmless and
instructive hobby. I was saying to Mr. Pyne early this morning,
when they raided the Muffin Club&mdash;what a quaint title it
has&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Raided the Muffin Club?' said Mo quickly. 'What do you mean?
I've heard nothing about that.'</p>

<p>'You wouldn't. That kind of institution would hardly appeal to
you. Only we thought it was best to raid the place, though in
doing so I fear I have incurred the displeasure of a young lady
friend of mine who was invited to dinner there to-morrow night.
As I say, chickens&mdash;'</p>

<p>Now Mo Liski knew that his plan had miscarried. Yet he was
puzzled by the man's attitude.</p>

<p>'Perhaps you would like to come down and see my Buff
Orpingtons, Mr. Liski? I live in Brockley.' Reeder removed his
glasses and glared owlishly at his companion. 'Say at nine
o'clock to-night; there is so much to talk about. At the same
time, it would add to the comfort of all concerned if you did not
arrive&mdash;um&mdash;conspicuously: do you understand what I
mean? I should not like the people of my office, for example, to
know.'</p>

<p>A slow smile dawned on Liski's face. It was his faith that all
men had their price, whether it was paid in cash or terror; and
this invitation to a secret conference was in a sense a tribute
to the power he wielded.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he came to Brockley, half hoping that Mr.
Reeder would go a little farther along the road which leads to
compromise. But, strangely enough, the elderly detective talked
of nothing but chickens. He sat on one side of the table, his
hands clasped on the cloth, his voice vibrant with pride as he
spoke of the breed that he was introducing to the English fowl-house, and, bored to extinction, Mo waited.</p>

<p>'There is something I wanted to say to you, but I fear that I
must postpone that until another meeting,' said Mr. Reeder, as he
helped his visitor on with his coat. 'I will walk with you to the
corner of Lewisham High Road: the place is full of bad
characters, and I shouldn't like to feel that I had endangered
your well-being by bringing you to this lowly spot.'</p>

<p>Now, if there is one place in the world which is highly
respectable and free from the footpads which infest wealthier
neighbourhoods, it is Brockley Road. Liski submitted to the
company of his host, and walked to the church at the end of the
road.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, Mr. Liski,' said Reeder earnestly. 'I shall never
forget this pleasant meeting. You have been of the greatest help
and assistance to me. You may be sure that neither I nor the
department I have the honour to represent will ever forget
you.'</p>

<p>Liski went back to town, a frankly bewildered man. In the
early hours of the morning the police arrested his chief
lieutenant, Teddy Alfield, and charged him with a motor-car
robbery which had been committed three months before.</p>

<p>That was the first of the inexplicable happenings. The second
came when Liski, returning to his flat off Portland Place, was
suddenly confronted by the awkward figure of the detective.</p>

<p>'Is that Liski?' Mr. Reeder peered forward in the darkness.
'I'm so glad I've found you. I've been looking for you all day. I
fear I horribly misled you the other evening when I was telling
you that Leghorns are unsuitable for sandy soil. Now on the
contrary&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Look here, Mr. Reeder, what's the game?' demanded the other
brusquely.</p>

<p>'The game?' asked Reeder in a pained tone.</p>

<p>'I don't want to know anything about chickens. If you've got
anything to tell me worth while, drop me a line and I'll come to
your office, or you can come to mine.'</p>

<p>He brushed past the man from the Public Prosecutor's
Department and slammed the door of his flat behind him. Within
two hours a squad from Scotland Yard descended upon the house of
Harry Merton, took Harry and his wife from their respective beds,
and charged them with the unlawful possession of stolen jewellery
which had been traced to a safe deposit.</p>

<p>A week later, Liski, returning from a vital interview with El
Rahbut, heard plodding steps overtaking him, and turned to meet
the pained eye of Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>'How providential meeting you!' said Reeder fervently. 'No,
no, I do not wish to speak about chickens, though I am hurt a
little by your indifference to this noble and productive
bird.'</p>

<p>'Then what in hell do you want?' snapped Liski. 'I don't want
anything to do with you, Reeder, and the sooner you get that into
your system the better. I don't wish to discuss fowls,
horses&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Wait!' Mr. Reeder bent forward and lowered his voice. 'Is it
not possible for you and me to meet together and exchange
confidences?'</p>

<p>Mo Liski smiled slowly.</p>

<p>'Oh, you're coming to it at last, eh? All right. I'll meet you
anywhere you please.'</p>

<p>'Shall we say in the Mall near the Artillery statue, to-morrow
night at ten? I don't think we shall be seen there.'</p>

<p>Liski nodded shortly and went on, still wondering what the man
had to tell him. At four o'clock he was wakened by the telephone
ringing furiously, and learnt, to his horror, that O'Hara, the
most trustworthy of his gang leaders, had been arrested and
charged with a year-old burglary. It was Carter, one of the minor
leaders, who brought the news.</p>

<p>'What's the idea, Liski?' And there was a note of suspicion in
the voice of his subordinate which made Liski's jaw drop.</p>

<p>'What do you mean&mdash;what's the idea? Come round and see
me. I don't want to talk over the phone.'</p>

<p>Carter arrived half an hour later, a scowling, suspicious
man.</p>

<p>'Now what do you want to say?' asked Mo, when they were
alone.</p>

<p>'All I've got to say is this,' growled Carter; 'a week ago
you're seen talking to old Reeder in Lewisham Road, and the same
night Teddy Alfield is pinched. You're spotted having a quiet
talk with this old dog, and the same night another of the gang
goes west. Last night I saw you with my own eyes having a
confidential chat with Reeder&mdash;and now O'Hara's gone!'</p>

<p>Mo looked at him incredulously.</p>

<p>'Well, and what about it?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Nothing&mdash;except that it's a queer coincidence, that's
all,' said Carter, his lip curling. 'The boys have been talking
about it: they don't like it, and you can't blame them.'</p>

<p>Liski sat pinching his lip, a far-away look in his eyes. It
was true, though the coincidence had not struck him before. So
that was the old devil's game! He was undermining his authority,
arousing a wave of suspicion which, if it were not checked, would
sweep him from his position.</p>

<p>'All right, Carter,' he said, in a surprisingly mild tone. 'It
never hit me that way before. Now I'll tell you, and you can tell
the other boys just what has happened.'</p>

<p>In a few words he explained Mr. Reeder's invitations.</p>

<p>'And you can tell 'em from me that I'm meeting the old fellow
to-morrow night, and I'm going to give him something to remember
me by.'</p>

<p>The thing was clear to him now, as he sat, after the man's
departure, going over the events of the past week. The three men
who had been arrested had been under police suspicion for a long
time, and Mo knew that not even he could have saved them. The
arrests had been made by arrangement with Scotland Yard to suit
the convenience of the artful Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>'I'll "artful" him!' said Mo, and spent the rest of the day
making his preparations.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock that night he passed under the Admiralty Arch.
A yellow mist covered the park, a drizzle of rain was falling,
and save for the cars that came at odd intervals towards the
palace, there was no sign of life.</p>

<p>He walked steadily past the Memorial, waiting for Mr. Reeder.
Ten o'clock struck and a quarter past, but there was no sign of
the detective.</p>

<p>'He's smelt a rat,' said Mo Liski between his teeth, and
replaced the short life-preserver he had carried in his
pocket.</p>

<p>It was at eleven o'clock that a patrolling police-constable
fell over a groaning something that lay across the sidewalk, and,
flashing his electric lamp upon the still figure, saw the carved
handle of a Moorish knife before he recognised the pain-distorted
face of the stricken Mo Liski.</p>

<p>'I don't quite understand how it all came about,' said Pyne
thoughtfully. (He had been called into consultation from head-quarters.) 'Why are you so sure it was the Moor Rahbut?'</p>

<p>'I am not sure,' Mr. Reeder hastened to correct the mistaken
impression. 'I mentioned Rahbut because I had seen him in the
afternoon and searched his lodgings for the emeralds&mdash;which
I am perfectly sure are still in Morocco, sir.' He addressed his
chief. 'Mr. Rahbut was quite a reasonable man, remembering that
he is a stranger to our methods.'</p>

<p>'Did you mention Mo Liski at all, Mr. Reeder?' asked the
Assistant Public Prosecutor.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder scratched his chin.</p>

<p>'I think I did&mdash;yes, I'm pretty certain that I told him
that I had an appointment with Mr. Liski at ten o'clock. I may
even have said where the appointment was to be kept. I can't
remember exactly how the subject of Liski came up. Possibly I may
have tried to bluff this indigenous native&mdash;"Bluff" is a
vulgar word, but it will convey what I mean&mdash;into the belief
that unless he gave me more information about the emeralds, I
should be compelled to consult one who knew so many secrets.
Possibly I did say that. Mr. Liski will be a long time in
hospital, I hear? That is a pity. I should never forgive myself
if my incautious words resulted in poor Mr. Liski being taken to
the hospital&mdash;alive!'</p>

<p>When he had gone, the chief looked at Inspector Pyne. Pyne
smiled.</p>

<p>'What is the name of that dangerous reptile, sir?' asked the
inspector. '"Mamba," isn't it? I must remember that.'</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07">VII. &mdash; THE STRANGE
CASE</a></h2>

<h3>First published as "The Weak Spot" in <i>The Grand Magazine</i>, May 1925</h3>

<p class="first">IN the days of Mr. Reeder's youth, which were
also the days when hansom cabs plied for hire and no gentleman
went abroad without a nosegay in the lapel of his coat, he had
been sent, in company with another young officer from Scotland
Yard, to arrest a youthful inventor of Nottingham who earned more
than a competence by methods which were displeasing to Scotland
Yard. Not machines nor ingenious contrivances for saving labour
did this young man invent&mdash;but stories. And they were not
stories in the accepted sense of the word, for they were
misstatements designed to extract money from the pockets of
simple-minded men and women. Mr. Eiter employed no fewer than
twenty-five aliases and as many addresses in the broadcasting of
his fiction, and he was on the way to amassing a considerable
fortune when a square-toed Nemesis took him by the arm and led
him to the seat of justice. An unsympathetic judge sent Mr. Eiter
to seven years' penal servitude, describing him as an
unconscionable swindler and a menace to society&mdash;at which
Willie Eiter smiled, for he had a skin beside which the
elephant's was gossamer silk.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder remembered the case chiefly because the prosecuting
attorney, commenting upon the various disguises and subterfuges
which the prisoner had adopted, remarked upon a peculiarity which
was revealed in every part which the convict had played&mdash;his
inability to spell 'able' which he invariably wrote as though he
were naming the victim of Cain's envy.</p>

<p>'There is this identity to be discovered in every criminal,
however ingenious he may be,' the advocate had said. 'Whatever
his disguise, no matter how cleverly he dissociates one role or
pose from another, there is a distinguishable weakness common to
every character he affects, and especially is this observable in
criminals who live by fraud and trickery.'</p>

<p>This Mr. Reeder remembered throughout his useful life. Few
people knew that he had ever been associated with Scotland Yard.
He himself evaded any question that was put to him on the
subject. It was his amiable trait to pretend that he was the
veriest amateur and that his success in the detection of
wrongdoing was to be traced to his own evil mind that saw wrong
very often where no wrong was.</p>

<p>He saw wrong in so many apparently innocent acts of man that
it was well for his reputation that those who were acquainted
with and pitied him because of his seeming inadequacy and
unattractive appearance did not know what dark thoughts filled
his mind.</p>

<p>There was a very pretty girl who lived in Brockley Road at a
boarding-house. He did not like Miss Margaret Belman because she
was pretty, but because she was sensible: two terms which are as
a rule antagonistic. He liked her so well that he often travelled
home on the cars with her, and they used to discuss the Prince of
Wales, the Labour Government, the high cost of living, and other
tender subjects with great animation. It was from Miss Belman
that he learned about her fellow-boarder, Mrs. Carlin, and once
he travelled back with her to Brockley&mdash;a frail, slim girl
with experience in her face and the hint of tragedy in her fine
eyes.</p>

<p>So it happened that he knew all about Mr. Harry Carlin long
before Lord Sellington sent for him, for Mr. Reeder had the gift
of evoking confidences by the suggestion rather than the
expression of his sympathy.</p>

<p>She spoke of her husband without bitterness&mdash;but also
without regret. She knew him&mdash;rather well, despite the
shortness of their married life. She hinted once, and
inadvertently, that there was a rich relation to whose wealth her
husband would be heir if he were a normal man. Her son would, in
due course, be the possessor of a great title&mdash;and
penniless. She was at such pains to rectify her statement that
Mr. Reeder, suspicious of peerages that come to Brockley, was
assured of her sincerity, however great might be her error. Later
he learned that the title was that borne by the Right Honourable
the Earl of Sellington and Manford.</p>

<p>There came a slack time for the Public Prosecutor's office,
when it seemed that sin had gone out of the world; and Mr. Reeder
sat for a week on end in his little room, twiddling his thumbs or
reading the advertisement columns of The Times, or drawing
grotesque men upon his blotting-pad, varying these performances
with the excursions he was in the habit of making to those parts
of London which very few people choose for their recreation. He
loved to poke about the slum areas which lie in the neighbourhood
of the Great Surrey Docks; he was not averse from frequenting the
north side of the river, again in the dock areas; but when his
chief asked him whether he spent much time at Limehouse, Mr.
Reeder replied with a pathetic smile.</p>

<p>'No, sir,' he said gently, 'I read about such places&mdash;I
find them infinitely more interesting in the pages of
a&mdash;er&mdash;novel. Yes, there are Chinese there, and I
suppose Chinese are romantic, but even they do not add romance to
Limehouse, which is the most respectable and law-abiding corner
of the East End.'</p>

<p>One morning the Public Prosecutor sent for his chief
detective, and Mr. Reeder obeyed the summons with a light step
and a pleasant sense of anticipation.</p>

<p>'Go over to the Foreign Office and have a talk with Lord
Sellington,' said the Prosecutor. 'He is rather worried about a
nephew of his. Harry Carlin. Do you know the name?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder shook his head; for the moment he did not associate
the pale girl who typed for her living.</p>

<p>'He's a pretty bad lot,' explained the Prosecutor, 'and
unfortunately he's Sellington's heir. I rather imagine the old
gentleman wants you to confirm his view.'</p>

<p>'Dear me!' said Mr. Reeder, and stole forth.</p>

<p>Lord Sellington, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
was a bachelor and an immensely rich man. He had been rich in
1912 when, in a panic due to certain legislation which he thought
would affect him adversely as a great landowner, he sold his
estates and invested the larger bulk of his fortune (against all
expert advice) in American industrial stocks. The war had trebled
his possessions. Heavy investments in oil lands had made him many
times a millionaire. He was a philanthropist, gave liberally to
institutions devoted to the care of young children; he was the
founder of the Eastleigh Children's Home, and subscribed
liberally to other similar institutions. A thin, rather sour-faced man, he glared up under his shaggy eyebrows as Mr. Reeder
sidled apologetically into his room.</p>

<p>'So you're Reeder, eh?' he grumbled, and was evidently not
very much impressed by his visitor. 'Sit down, sit down,' he said
testily, walked to the door as though he were not certain that
Mr. Reeder had closed it, and came back and flopped into his
chair on the other side of the table. 'I have sent for you in
preference to notifying the police,' he said. 'Sir James speaks
of you, Mr. Reeder, as a gentleman of discretion.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder bowed slightly, and there followed a long and
awkward pause, which the Under-Secretary ended in an abrupt,
irritable way.</p>

<p>'I have a nephew&mdash;Harry Carlin. Do you know him?'</p>

<p>'I know of him,' said Mr. Reeder truthfully; in his walk to
the Foreign Office he had remembered the deserted wife.</p>

<p>'Then you know nothing good of him!' exploded his lordship.
'The man is a blackguard, a waster, a disgrace to the name he
bears! If he were not my brother's son I would have him under
lock and key to-night&mdash;the scoundrel! I have four bills in
my possession&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped himself, pulled open a drawer savagely, took out a
letter and slammed it on the table.</p>

<p>'Read that,' he snapped.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder pulled his glasses a little farther up his nose (he
always held them very tight when he was really using them) and
perused the message. It was headed 'The Eastleigh Home for
Children,' and was a brief request for five thousand pounds,
which the writer said he would send for that evening, and was
signed 'Arthur Lassard.'</p>

<p>'You know Lassard, of course?' said his lordship. 'He is the
gentleman associated with me in my philanthropic work. Certain
monies were due for land which we purchased adjoining the home.
As you probably know, there are lawyers who never accept cheques
for properties they sell on behalf of their clients, and I had
the money ready and left it with my secretary, and one of
Lassard's people was calling for it. That it was called for, I
need hardly tell you,' said his lordship grimly. 'Whoever planned
the coup planned it well. They knew I would be speaking in the
House of Lords last night; they also knew that I had recently
changed my secretary and had engaged a gentleman to whom most of
my associates are strangers. A bearded man came for the money at
half-past six, produced a note from Mr. Lassard, and that was the
end of the money, except that we have discovered that it was
changed this morning into American bills. Of course, both letters
were forged: Lassard never signed either, and made no demand
whatever for the money, which was not needed for another
week.'</p>

<p>'Did anybody know about this transaction?' asked Mr.
Reeder.</p>

<p>His lordship nodded slowly.</p>

<p>'My nephew knew. He came to my house two days ago to borrow
money. He has a small income from his late mother's estate, but
insufficient to support him in his reckless extravagance. He
admitted frankly to me that he had come back from Aix broke. How
long he had been in London I am unable to tell you, but he was in
my library when my secretary came in with the money which I had
drawn from the bank in preparation for paying the bill when it
became due. Very foolishly I explained why I had so much cash in
the house and why I was unable to oblige him with the thousand
pounds which he wanted to borrow,' he added dourly.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder scratched his chin.</p>

<p>'What am I to do?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I want you to find Carlin,' Lord Sellington almost snarled.
'But most I want that money back&mdash;you understand, Reeder?
You're to tell him that unless he repays&mdash;'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was gazing steadily at the cornice moulding.</p>

<p>'It almost sounds as if I am being asked to compound a felony,
my lord,' he said respectfully. 'But I realise, in the peculiar
circumstances, we must adopt peculiar methods. The black-bearded
gentleman who called for the money would appear to have
been'&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;'disguised?'</p>

<p>'Of course he was disguised,' said the other irritably.</p>

<p>'One reads of such things,' said Mr. Reeder with a sigh, 'but
so seldom does the bearded stranger appear in real life! Will you
be good enough to tell me your nephew's address?'</p>

<p>Lord Sellington took a card from his pocket and threw it
across the table. It fell to the floor, but he did not apologise.
He was that kind of man.</p>

<p>'Jermyn Mansions,' said Mr. Reeder as he rose. 'I will see
what can be done.'</p>

<p>Lord Sellington grunted something which might have been a
tender farewell, but probably was not.</p>

<p>Jermyn Mansions is a very small, narrow-fronted building and,
as Mr. Reeder knew&mdash;and he knew a great deal&mdash;was a
block of residential flats, which were run by an ex-butler who
was also the lessee of the establishment. By great good fortune,
as he afterwards learned, Harry Carlin was at home, and in a few
minutes the man from the Public Prosecutor's office was ushered
into a shabby drawing-room that overlooked Jermyn Street.</p>

<p>A tall young man stood by the window, looking disconsolately
into that narrow and lively thoroughfare, and turned as Mr.
Reeder was announced. Thin-faced, narrow-headed, small-eyed, if
he possessed any of the family traits and failings, the most
marked was perhaps his too ready irritation.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder saw, through an open door, a very untidy bedroom,
caught a glimpse of a battered trunk covered with Continental
labels.</p>

<p>'Well, what the devil do you want?' demanded Mr. Carlin. Yet,
in spite of his tone, there was an undercurrent of disquiet which
Mr. Reeder detected.</p>

<p>'May I sit down?' said the detective and, without waiting for
an invitation, pulled a chair from the wall and sat down
gingerly, for he knew the quality of lodging-house chairs.</p>

<p>His self-possession, the hint of authority he carried in his
voice, increased Mr. Harry Carlin's uneasiness; and when Mr.
Reeder plunged straight into the object of his visit, he saw the
man go pale.</p>

<p>'It is a difficult subject to open,' said Mr. Reeder,
carefully smoothing his knees, 'and when I find myself in that
predicament I usually employ the plainest language.'</p>

<p>And plain language he employed with a vengeance. Half-way
through Carlin sat down with a gasp.</p>

<p>'What&mdash;what!' he stammered. 'Does that old brute dare
&mdash; ! I thought you came about the bills&mdash;I
mean&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I mean,' said Mr. Reeder carefully, 'that if you have had a
little fun with your relative, I think that jest has gone far
enough. Lord Sellington is prepared, on the money being refunded,
to regard the whole thing as an over-elaborate practical joke on
your part&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But I haven't touched his beastly money!' the young man
almost screamed. 'I don't want his money&mdash;'</p>

<p>'On the contrary, sir,' said Reeder gently, 'you want it very
badly. You left the Hotel Continental without paying your bill;
you owe some six hundred pounds to various gentlemen from whom
you borrowed that amount; there is a warrant out for you in
France for passing cheques which are usually described by the
vulgar as&mdash;er&mdash;"dud." Indeed'&mdash;again Mr. Reeder
scratched his chin and looked thoughtfully out of the
window&mdash;'indeed I know no gentleman in Jermyn Street who is
so badly in need of money as your good self.'</p>

<p>Carlin would have stopped him, but the middle-aged man went on
remorselessly.</p>

<p>'I have been for an hour in the Record Department of Scotland
Yard, where your name is not unknown, Mr. Carlin. You left London
rather hurriedly to avoid&mdash;er&mdash;proceedings of an
unpleasant character. "Bills," I think you said? You are known to
have been the associate of people with whom the police are a
little better acquainted than they are with Mr. Carlin. You were
also associated with a race-course fraud of a peculiarly
unpleasant character. And amongst your minor delinquencies there
is&mdash;er&mdash;a deserted young wife, at present engaged in a
City office as typist, and a small boy for whom you have never
provided.'</p>

<p>Carlin licked his dry lips.</p>

<p>'Is that all?' he asked, with an attempt at a sneer, though
his voice shook and his trembling hands betrayed his
agitation.</p>

<p>Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>'Well, I'll tell you something. I want to do the right thing
by my wife. I admit I haven't played square with her, but I've
never had the money to play square. That old devil has always
been rolling in it, curse him! I'm the only relation he has, and
what has he done? Left every bean to these damned children's
homes of his! If somebody has caught him for five thousand I'm
glad! I shouldn't have the nerve to do it myself, but I'm glad if
they did&mdash;whoever they may be. Left every penny to a lot of
squalling, sticky-faced brats, and not a bean to me!'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder let him rave on without interruption, until at
last, almost exhausted by his effort, he dropped down into a deep
chair and glared at his visitor.</p>

<p>'Tell him that,' he said breathlessly; 'tell him that!'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder made time to call at the little office in Portugal
Street wherein was housed the head-quarters of Lord Sellington's
various philanthropic enterprises. Mr. Arthur Lassard had
evidently been in communication with his noble patron, for no
sooner did Reeder give his name than he was ushered into the
plainly furnished room where the superintendent sat.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural that Lord Sellington should have as his
assistant in the good work so famous an organiser as Mr. Arthur
Lassard. Mr. Lassard's activities in the philanthropic world were
many. A broad-shouldered man with a jolly red face and a bald
head, he had survived all the attacks which come the way of men
engaged in charitable work, and was not particularly impressed by
a recent visit he had had from Harry Carlin.</p>

<p>'I don't wish to be unkind,' he said, 'but our friend called
here on such a lame excuse that I can't help feeling that his
real object was to secure a sheet of my stationery. I did, in
fact, leave him in the room for a few minutes, and he had the
opportunity to purloin the paper if he desired.'</p>

<p>'What was his excuse?' asked Mr. Reeder, and the other
shrugged.</p>

<p>'He wanted money. At first he was civil and asked me to
persuade his uncle; then he grew abusive, said that I was
conspiring to rob him&mdash;I and my "infernal charities"!'</p>

<p>He chuckled, but grew grave again.</p>

<p>'The situation is mysterious to me,' he said. 'Evidently
Carlin has committed some crime against his lordship, for he is
terrified of him!'</p>

<p>'You think Mr. Carlin forged your name and secured the
money?'</p>

<p>The superintendent spread out his arms in despair.</p>

<p>'Who else can I suspect?' he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder took the forged letter from his pocket and read it
again.</p>

<p>'I've just been on the phone to his lordship,' Mr. Lassard
went on. 'He is waiting, of course, to hear your report, and if
you have failed to make this young man confess his guilt, Lord
Sellington intends seeing his nephew tonight and making an appeal
to him. I can hardly believe that Mr. Carlin could have done this
wicked thing, though the circumstances seem very suspicious. Have
you seen him, Mr. Reeder?'</p>

<p>'I have seen him,' said Mr. Reeder shortly. 'Oh, yes, I have
seen him!'</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Lassard was scrutinising his face as though he were
trying to read the conclusion which the detective had reached,
but Mr. Reeder's face was notoriously expressionless.</p>

<p>He offered a limp hand and went back to the Under-Secretary's
house. The interview was short and on the whole disagreeable.</p>

<p>'I never dreamt he would confess to you,' said Lord Sellington
with ill-disguised contempt. 'Harry needs somebody to frighten
him, and, my God! I'm the man to do it! I'm seeing him to-night.'</p>

<p>A fit of coughing stopped him and he gulped savagely from a
little medicine bottle that stood on his desk.</p>

<p>'I'll see him to-night,' he gasped, 'and I'll tell him what I
intend doing! I've spared him hitherto because of his
relationship and because he inherits the title. But I'm through.
Every cent I have goes to charity. I'm good for twenty years yet,
but every penny&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped. He was a man who never disguised his emotion, and
Mr. Reeder, who understood men, saw the struggle that was going
on in Sellington's mind.</p>

<p>'He says he hasn't had a chance. I may have treated him
unfairly&mdash;we shall see.' He waved the detective from his
office as though he were dismissing a strange dog that had
intruded upon his privacy, and Mr. Reeder went out reluctantly,
for he had something to tell his lordship.</p>

<p>It was peculiar to him that, in his more secretive moments, he
sought the privacy of his old-fashioned study in Brockley Road.
For two hours he sat at his desk calling a succession of
numbers&mdash;and curiously enough, the gentlemen to whom he
spoke were bookmakers. Most of them he knew. In the days when he
was the greatest expert in the world on forged currency notes, he
had been brought into contact with a class which is often the
innocent medium by which the forger distributed his
handicraft&mdash;and more often the instrument of his
detection.</p>

<p>It was a Friday, a day on which most of the principals were in
their offices till a late hour. At eight o'clock he finished,
wrote a note and, phoning for a messenger, sent his letter on its
fateful errand.</p>

<p>He spent the rest of the evening musing on past experiences
and in refreshing his memory from the thin scrap-books which
filled two shelves in his study.</p>

<p>What happened elsewhere that evening can best be told in the
plain language of the witness-box. Lord Sellington had gone home
after his interview with Mr. Reeder suffering from a feverish
cold, and was disposed, according to the evidence of his
secretary, to put off the interview which he had arranged with
his nephew. A telephone message had been sent through to Mr.
Carlin's hotel, but he was out. Until nine o'clock his lordship
was busy with the affairs of his numerous charities, Mr. Lassard
being in attendance. Lord Sellington was working in a small study
which opened from his bedroom.</p>

<p>At a quarter-past nine Carlin arrived and was shown upstairs
by the butler, who subsequently stated that he heard voices
raised in anger. Mr. Carlin came downstairs and was shown out as
the clock struck half-past nine, and a few minutes later the bell
rang for Lord Sellington's valet, who went up to assist his
master to bed.</p>

<p>At half-past seven the next morning, the valet, who slept in
an adjoining apartment, went into his master's room to take him a
cup of tea. He found his employer lying face downward on the
floor; he was dead, and had been dead for some hours. There was
no sign of wounds, and at first glance it looked as though this
man of sixty had collapsed in the night. But there were
circumstances which pointed to some unusual happening. In Lord
Sellington's bedroom was a small steel wall-safe, and the first
thing the valet noticed was that this was open, papers were lying
on the floor, and that in the grate was a heap of paper which,
except for one corner, was entirely burnt.</p>

<p>The valet telephoned immediately for the doctor and for the
police, and from that moment the case went out of Mr. Reeder's
able hands.</p>

<p>Later that morning he reported briefly to his superior the
result of his inquiries.</p>

<p>'Murder, I am afraid,' he said sadly. 'The Home Office
pathologist is perfectly certain that it is a case of aconitine
poisoning. The paper in the hearth has been photographed, and
there is no doubt whatever that the burnt document is the will by
which Lord Sellington left all his property to various charitable
institutions.'</p>

<p>He paused here.</p>

<p>'Well?' asked his chief, 'what does that mean?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder coughed.</p>

<p>'It means that if this will cannot be proved, and I doubt
whether it can, his lordship died intestate. The property goes
with the title&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To Carlin?' asked the startled Prosecutor.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>'There were other things burnt; four small oblong slips of
paper, which had evidently been fastened together by a pin. These
are quite indecipherable.' He sighed again. The Public Prosecutor
looked up.</p>

<p>'You haven't mentioned the letter that arrived by district
messenger after Lord Sellington had retired for the night.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder rubbed his chin.</p>

<p>'No, I didn't mention that,' he said reluctantly.</p>

<p>'Has it been found?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder hesitated.</p>

<p>'I don't know. I rather think that it has not been,' he
said.</p>

<p>'Would it throw any light upon the crime, do you think?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder scratched his chin with some sign of
embarrassment.</p>

<p>'I should think it might,' he said. 'Will you excuse me, sir?
Inspector Salter is waiting for me.' And he was out of the room
before the Prosecutor could frame any further inquiry.</p>

<p>Inspector Salter was striding impatiently up and down the
little room when Mr. Reeder came back. They left the building
together. The car that was waiting for them brought them to
Jermyn Street in a few minutes. Outside the flat three plain-clothes men were waiting, evidently for the arrival of their
chief, and the Inspector passed into the building, followed
closely by Mr. Reeder. They were half-way up the stairs when
Reeder asked:</p>

<p>'Does Carlin know you?'</p>

<p>'He ought to,' was the grim reply. 'I did my best to get him
penal servitude before he skipped from England.'</p>

<p>'Humph!' said Mr. Reeder. 'I'm sorry he knows you.'</p>

<p>'Why?' The Inspector stopped on the stairs to ask the
question.</p>

<p>'Because he saw us getting out of the cab. I caught sight of
his face, and&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. The sound of a shot thundered through the
house, and in another second the Inspector was racing up the
stairs two at a time and had burst into the suite which Carlin
occupied.</p>

<p>A glimpse of the prostrate figure told them they were too
late. The Inspector bent over the dead man.</p>

<p>'That has saved the country the cost of a murder trial,' he
said.</p>

<p>'I think not,' said Mr. Reeder gently, and explained his
reasons.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, as Mr. Lassard walked out of his office, a
detective tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>'Your name is Eiter,' he said, 'and I want you for
murder.'</p>

<p>'It was a very simple case really, sir,' explained Mr. Reeder
to his chief. 'Eiter, of course, was known to me personally, but
I remembered especially that he could not spell the word "able,"
and I recognised this peculiarity in our friend the moment I saw
the letter which he wrote to his patron asking for the money. It
was Eiter himself who drew the five thousand pounds; of that I am
convinced. The man is, and always has been, an inveterate
gambler, and I did not have to make many inquiries before I
discovered that he was owing a large sum of money and that one
bookmaker had threatened to bring him before Tattersall's
Committee unless he paid. That would have meant the end of Mr.
Lassard, the philanthropic custodian of children. Which, by the
way, was always Eiter's role. He ran bogus charitable
societies&mdash;it is extraordinarily easy to find dupes who are
willing to subscribe for philanthropic objects. Many years ago,
when I was a young man, I was instrumental in getting him seven
years. I'd lost sight of him since then until I saw the letter he
sent to Lord Sellington. Unfortunately for him, one line ran: "I
shall be glad if you are abel to let my messenger have the
money"&mdash;and he spelt "able" in the Eiter way. I called on
him and made sure. And then I wrote to his lordship, who
apparently did not open the letter till late that night.</p>

<p>'Eiter had called on him earlier in the evening and had had a
long talk with him. I only surmise that Lord Sellington had
expressed a doubt as to whether he ought to leave his nephew
penniless, scoundrel though he was; and Eiter was terrified that
his scheme for getting possession of the old man's money was in
danger of failing. Moreover, my appearance in the case had scared
him. He decided to kill Lord Sellington that night, took
aconitine with him to the house and introduced it into the
medicine, a bottle of which always stood on Sellington's desk.
Whether the old man destroyed the will which disinherited his
nephew before he discovered he had been poisoned, or whether he
did it after, we shall never know. When I had satisfied myself
that Lassard was Eiter, I sent a letter by special messenger to
Stratford Place&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That was the letter delivered by special messenger?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>'It is possible that Sellington was already under the
influence of the drug when he burnt the will, and burnt too the
four bills which Carlin had forged and which the old man had held
over his head as a threat. Carlin may have known his uncle was
dead; he certainly recognised the Inspector when he stepped out
of the cab, and, thinking he was to be arrested for forgery, shot
himself.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder pursed his lips and his melancholy face grew
longer.</p>

<p>'I wish I had never known Mrs. Carlin&mdash;my acquaintance
with her introduces that element of coincidence which is
permissible in stories but is so distressing in actual life. It
shakes one's confidence in the logic of things.'</p> <hr>

INVESTORS</a></h2>

<p class="first">THERE are seven million people in Greater London
and each one of those seven millions is in theory and practice
equal under the law and commonly precious to the community. So
that, if one is wilfully wronged, another must be punished; and
if one dies of premeditated violence, his slayer must hang by the
neck until he be dead.</p>

<p>It is rather difficult for the sharpest law-eyes to keep tag
of seven million people, at least one million of whom never keep
still and are generally unattached to any particular domicile. It
is equally difficult to place an odd twenty thousand or so who
have domiciles but no human association. These include tramps,
aged maiden ladies in affluent circumstances, peripatetic members
of the criminal classes and other friendless individuals.</p>

<p>Sometimes uneasy inquiries come through to head-quarters.
Mainly they are most timid and deferential. Mr. X. has not seen
his neighbour, Mr. Y. for a week. No, he doesn't know Mr. Y.
Nobody does. A little old man who had no friends and spent his
fine days pottering in a garden overlooked by his more gregarious
neighbour. And now Mr. Y. potters no more. His milk has not been
taken in; his blinds are drawn. Comes a sergeant of police and a
constable who breaks a window and climbs through, and Mr. Y. is
dead somewhere&mdash;dead of starvation or a fit or suicide.
Should this be the case, all is plain sailing. But suppose the
house empty and Mr. Y. disappeared. Here the situation becomes
difficult and delicate.</p>

<p>Miss Elver went away to Switzerland. She was a middle-aged
spinster who had the appearance of being comfortably
circumstanced. She went away, locked up her house and never came
back. Switzerland looked for her; the myrmidons of Mussolini,
that hatefully efficient man, searched North Italy from
Domodossola to Montecattini. And the search did not yield a thin-faced maiden lady with a slight squint.</p>

<p>And then Mr. Charles Boyson Middlekirk, an eccentric and
overpowering old man who quarrelled with his neighbours about
their noisy children, he too went away. He told nobody where he
was going. He lived alone with his three cats and was not on
speaking terms with anybody else. He did not return to his grimy
house.</p>

<p>He too was well off and reputedly a miser. So was Mrs. Athbell
Marting, a dour widow who lived with her drudge of a niece. This
lady was in the habit of disappearing without any preliminary
announcement of her intention. The niece was allowed to order
from the local tradesmen just sufficient food to keep body and
soul together, and when Mrs. Marling returned (as she invariably
did) the bills were settled with a great deal of grumbling on the
part of the payer, and that was that. It was believed that Mrs.
Marting went to Boulogne or to Paris or even to Brussels. But one
day she went out and never came back. Six months later her niece
advertised for her, choosing the cheapest papers&mdash;having an
eye to the day of reckoning.</p>

<p>'Queer sort of thing,' said the Public Prosecutor, who had
before him the dossiers of four people (three women and a man)
who had so vanished in three months.</p>

<p>He frowned, pressed a bell and Mr. Reeder came in. Mr. Reeder
took the chair that was indicated, looked owlishly over his
glasses and shook his head as though he understood the reason for
his summons and denied his understanding in advance. 'What do you
make of these disappearances?' asked his chief.</p>

<p>'You cannot make any positive of a negative,' said Mr. Reeder
carefully. 'London is a large place full of strange, mad people
who live such&mdash;um&mdash;commonplace lives that the wonder is
that more of them do not disappear in order to do something
different from what they are accustomed to doing.'</p>

<p>'Have you seen these particulars?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>'I have copies of them,' he said. 'Mr. Salter very
kindly&mdash;'</p>

<p>The Public Prosecutor rubbed his head in perplexity.</p>

<p>'I see nothing in these cases&mdash;nothing in common, I mean.
Four is a fairly low average for a big city&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Twenty-seven in twelve months,' interrupted his detective
apologetically.</p>

<p>'Twenty-seven&mdash;are you sure?' The great official was
astounded.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded again.</p>

<p>'They were all people with a little money; all were drawing a
fairly large income, which was paid to them in bank-notes on the
first of every month&mdash;nineteen of them were, at any rate. I
have yet to verify eight&mdash;and they were all most reticent as
to where their revenues came from. None of them had any personal
friends or relatives who were on terms of friendship, except Mrs.
Marting. Beyond these points of resemblance there was nothing to
connect one with the other.'</p>

<p>The Prosecutor looked at him sharply, but Mr. Reeder was never
sarcastic. Not obviously so, at any rate.</p>

<p>'There is another point which I omitted to mention,' he went
on. 'After their disappearance no further money came for them. It
came for Mrs. Marting when she was away on her jaunts, but it
ceased when she went away on her final journey.'</p>

<p>'But twenty-seven&mdash;are you sure?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder reeled off the list, giving name, address and date
of disappearance.</p>

<p>'What do you think has happened to them?'</p>

<p>Mr, Reeder considered for a moment, staring glumly at the
carpet.</p>

<p>'I should imagine that they were murdered,' he said, almost
cheerfully, and the Prosecutor half rose from his chair.</p>

<p>'You are in your gayest mood this morning, Mr. Reeder,' he
said sardonically. 'Why on earth should they be murdered?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder did not explain. The interview took place in the
late afternoon, and he was anxious to be gone, for he had a tacit
appointment to meet a young lady of exceeding charm who at five
minutes after five would be waiting on the corner of Westminster
Bridge and Thames Embankment for the Lee car.</p>

<p>The sentimental qualities of Mr. Reeder were entirely unknown.
There are those who say that his sorrow over those whom fate and
ill-fortune brought into his punitive hands was the veriest
hypocrisy. There were others who believed that he was genuinely
pained to see a fellow-creature sent behind bars through his
efforts and evidence.</p>

<p>His housekeeper, who thought he was a woman-hater, told her
friends in confidence that he was a complete stranger to the
tender emotions which enlighten and glorify humanity. In the ten
years which she had sacrificed to his service he had displayed
neither emotion nor tenderness except to inquire whether her
sciatica was better or to express a wish that she should take a
holiday by the sea. She was a woman beyond middle age, but there
is no period of life wherein a woman gives up hoping for the
best. Though the most perfect of servants in all respects, she
secretly despised him, called him, to her intimates, a frump, and
suspected him of living apart from an ill-treated wife. This lady
was a widow (as she had told him when he first engaged her) and
she had seen better&mdash;far better&mdash;days.</p>

<p>Her visible attitude towards Mr. Reeder was one of respect and
awe. She excused the queer character of his callers and his low
acquaintances. She forgave him his square-toed shoes and high,
flat-crowned hat, and even admired the ready-made Ascot cravat he
wore and which was fastened behind the collar with a little
buckle, the prongs of which invariably punctured his fingers when
he fastened it. But there is a limit to all hero-worship, and
when she discovered that Mr. Reeder was in the habit of waiting
to escort a young lady to town every day, and frequently found it
convenient to escort her home, the limit was reached.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hambleton told her friends&mdash;and they
agreed&mdash;that there was no fool like an old fool, and that
marriages between the old and the young invariably end in the
divorce court (December v. May and July). She used to leave
copies of a favourite Sunday newspaper on his table, where he
could not fail to see the flaring head-lines:</p><br>

<p class="headline">OLD MAN'S WEDDING ROMANCE<br> WIFE'S PERFIDY
BRINGS GREY HAIR<br> IN SORROW TO THE LAW COURTS.</p><br>

<p>Whether Mr. Reeder perused these human documents she did not
know. He never referred to the tragedies of ill-assorted unions,
and went on meeting Miss Belman every morning at nine o'clock,
and at five-five in the afternoons whenever his business
permitted.</p>

<p>He so rarely discussed his own business or introduced the
subject that was exercising his mind that it was remarkable he
should make even an oblique reference to his work. Possibly he
would not have done so if Miss Margaret Belman had not introduced
(unwillingly) a leader of conversation which traced indirectly to
the disappearances.</p>

<p>They had been talking of holidays: Margaret was going to
Cromer for a fortnight.</p>

<p>'I shall leave on the second. My monthly dividends (doesn't
that sound grand?) are due on the first&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Eh?'</p>

<p>Reeder slued round. Dividends in most companies are paid at
half-yearly intervals.</p>

<p>'Dividends, Miss Margaret?'</p>

<p>She flushed a little at his surprise and then laughed.</p>

<p>'You didn't realise that I was a woman of property?' she
bantered him. 'I receive ten pounds a month&mdash;my father left
me a little house property when he died. I sold the cottages two
years ago for a thousand pounds and found a wonderful
investment.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder made a rapid calculation.</p>

<p>'You are drawing something like 12 and a half per cent.,' he
said. 'That is indeed a wonderful investment. What is the name of
the company?'</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I can't tell you that. You see&mdash;well, it's
rather secret. It is to do with a South American syndicate that
supplies arms to&mdash;what do you call them&mdash;insurgents! I
know it is rather dreadful to make money that way&mdash;I mean
out of arms and things, but it pays terribly well and I can't
afford to miss the opportunity.'</p>

<p>Reeder frowned.</p>

<p>'But why is it such a terrible secret?' he asked. 'Quite a
number of respectable people make money out of armament
concerns.'</p>

<p>Again she showed reluctance to explain her meaning.</p>

<p>'We are pledged&mdash;the shareholders, I mean&mdash;not to
divulge our connection with the company,' she said. 'That is one
of the agreements I had to sign. And the money comes regularly. I
have had nearly £300 of my thousand back in dividends
already.'</p>

<p>'Humph!' said Mr. Reeder, wise enough not to press his
question. There was another day to-morrow.</p>

<p>But the opportunity to which he looked forward on the
following morning was denied to him. Somebody played a grim
'joke' on him&mdash;the kind of joke to which he was accustomed,
for there were men who had good reason to hate him, and never a
year passed but one or the other sought to repay him for his
unkindly attentions.</p>

<p>'Your name is Reeder, ain't it?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder, tightly grasping his umbrella with both hands,
looked over his spectacles at the shabby man who stood at the
bottom of the steps. He was on the point of leaving his house in
the Brockley Road for his office in Whitehall, and since he was a
methodical man and worked to a time-table, he resented in his
mild way this interruption which had already cost him fifteen
seconds of valuable time.</p>

<p>'You're the fellow who shopped Ike Walker, ain't you?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder had indeed 'shopped' many men. He was by profession
a shopper, which, translated from the argot, means a man who
procures the arrest of an evildoer. Ike Walker he knew very well
indeed. He was a clever, a too clever, forger of bills of
exchange, and was at that precise moment almost permanently
employed as orderly in the convict prison at Dartmoor, and might
account himself fortunate if he held this easy job for the rest
of his twelve years' sentence.</p>

<p>His interrogator was a little hard-faced man wearing a suit
that had evidently been originally intended for somebody of
greater girth and more commanding height. His trousers were
turned up noticeably; his waistcoat was full of folds and tucks
which only an amateur tailor would have dared, and only one
superior to the criticism of his fellows would have worn. His
hard, bright eyes were fixed on Mr. Reeder, but there was no
menace in them so far as the detective could read.</p>

<p>'Yes, I was instrumental in arresting Ike Walker,' said Mr.
Reeder, almost gently.</p>

<p>The man put his hand in his pocket and brought out a crumpled
packet enclosed in green oiled silk. Mr. Reeder unfolded the
covering and found a soiled and crumpled envelope.</p>

<p>'That's from Ike,' said the man. 'He sent it out of stir by a
gent who was discharged yesterday.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was not shocked by this revelation. He knew that
prison rules were made to be broken, and that worse things have
happened in the best regulated jails than this item of a smuggled
letter. He opened the envelope, keeping his eyes on the man's
face, took out the crumpled sheet and read the five or six lines
of writing.</p><br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Reeder</span> &mdash;
Here is a bit of a riddle for you.</p>

<p class="letter">What other people have got, you can have. I
haven't got it, but it is coming to you. It's red-hot when you
get it, but you're cold when it goes away.</p>

<p class="letter">Your loving friend,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Ike Walker</span> (doing a
twelve stretch because you went on the witness stand and told a
lot of lies.)</p><br>

<p>Mr. Reeder looked up and their eyes met. 'Your friend is a
little mad, one thinks?' he asked politely.</p>

<p>'He ain't a friend of mine. A gent asked me to bring it,' said
the messenger.</p>

<p>'On the contrary,' said Mr. Reeder pleasantly, 'he gave it to
you in Dartmoor Prison yesterday. Your name is Mills; you have
eight convictions for burglary, and will have your ninth before
the year is out. You were released two days ago&mdash;I saw you
reporting at Scotland Yard.'</p>

<p>The man was for the moment alarmed and in two minds to bolt.
Mr. Reeder glanced along Brockley Road, saw a slim figure, that
was standing at the corner, cross to a waiting tramcar, and,
seeing his opportunity vanish, readjusted his time-table.</p>

<p>'Come inside, Mr. Mills.'</p>

<p>'I don't want to come inside,' said Mr. Mills, now thoroughly
agitated. 'He asked me to give this to you and I've give it.
There's nothing else&mdash;'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder crooked his finger.</p>

<p>'Come, birdie!' he said, with great amiability. 'And please
don't annoy me! I am quite capable of sending you back to your
friend Mr. Walker. I am really a most unpleasant man if am
upset.'</p>

<p>The messenger followed meekly, wiped his boots with great
vigour on the mat and tiptoed up the carpeted stairs to the big
study where Mr. Reeder did most of his thinking.</p>

<p>'Sit down, Mills.'</p>

<p>With his own hands Mr. Reeder placed a chair for his
uncomfortable visitor, and then, pulling another up to his big
writing table, he spread the letter before him, adjusted his
glasses, read, his lips moving, and then leaned back in his
chair.</p>

<p>'I give it up,' he said. 'Read me this riddle.'</p>

<p>'I don't know what's in the letter&mdash;' began the man.</p>

<p>'Read me this riddle.'</p>

<p>As he handed the letter across the table, the man betrayed
himself, for he rose and pushed back his chair with a startled,
horrified expression that told Mr. Reeder quite a lot. He laid
the letter down on his desk, took a large tumbler from the
sideboard, inverted it and covered the scrawled paper. Then:</p>

<p>'Wait,' he said, 'and don't move till I come back.'</p>

<p>And there was an unaccustomed venom in his tone that made the
visitor shudder.</p>

<p>Reeder passed out of the room to the bathroom, pulled up his
sleeves with a quick jerk of his arm and, turning the faucet, let
hot water run over his hands before he reached for a small bottle
on a shelf, poured a liberal portion into the water and let his
hands soak. This done, for three minutes he scrubbed his fingers
with a nail-brush, dried them, and, removing his coat and
waistcoat carefully, hung them over the edge of the bath. He went
back to his uncomfortable guest in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>'Our friend Walker is employed in the hospital?' he stated
rather than asked. 'What have you had there&mdash;scarlet fever
or something worse?'</p>

<p>He glanced down at the letter under the glass.</p>

<p>'Scarlet fever, of course,' he said, 'and the letter has been
systematically infected. Walker is almost clever.'</p>

<p>The wood of a fire was laid in the grate. He carried the
letter and the blotting-paper to the hearth, lit the kindling and
thrust paper and letter into the flames.</p>

<p>'Almost clever,' he said musingly. 'Of course, he is one of
the orderlies in the hospital. It was scarlet fever, I think you
said?'</p>

<p>The gaping man nodded.</p>

<p>'Of a virulent type, of course. How very fascinating!'</p>

<p>He thrust his hands in his pockets and looked down
benevolently at the wretched emissary of the vengeful Walker.</p>

<p>'You may go now, Mills,' he said gently. 'I rather think that
you are infected. That ridiculous piece of oiled silk is quite
inadequate&mdash;which means "quite useless"&mdash;as a
protection against wandering germs. You will have scarlet fever
in three days, and will probably be dead at the end of the week.
I will send you a wreath.'</p>

<p>He opened the door, pointed to the stairway and the man slunk
out.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder watched him through the window, saw him cross the
street and disappear round the corner into the Lewisham High
Road, and then, going up to his bedroom, he put on a newer frock-coat and waistcoat, drew on his hands a pair of fabric gloves and
went forth to his labours.</p>

<p>He did not expect to meet Mr. Mills again, never dreaming that
the gentleman from Dartmoor was planning a 'bust' which would
bring them again into contact. For Mr. Reeder the incident was
closed.</p>

<p>That day news of another disappearance had come through from
police head-quarters, and Mr. Reeder was waiting at ten minutes
before five at the rendezvous for the girl who, he instinctively
knew, could give him a thread of the clue. He was determined that
this time his inquiries should bear fruit; but it was not until
they had reached the end of Brockley Road, and he was walking
slowly up towards the girl's boarding-house, that she gave him a
hint.</p>

<p>'Why are you so persistent, Mr. Reeder?' she asked, a little
impatiently. 'Do you wish to invest money? Because, if you do,
I'm sorry I can't help you. That is another agreement we made,
that we would not introduce new shareholders.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder stopped, took off his hat and rubbed the back of
his head (his housekeeper, watching him from an upper window, was
perfectly certain he was proposing and had been rejected).</p>

<p>'I am going to tell you something. Miss Belman, and I
hope&mdash;er&mdash;that I shall not alarm you.'</p>

<p>And very briefly he told the story of the disappearances and
the queer coincidence which marked every case&mdash;the receipt
of a dividend on the first of every month. As he proceeded, the
colour left the girl's face.</p>

<p>'You are serious, of course?' she said, serious enough
herself. 'You wouldn't tell me that unless&mdash;. The company is
the Mexico City Investment Syndicate. They have offices in
Portugal Street.'</p>

<p>'How did you come to hear of them?' asked Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>'I had a letter from their manager, Mr. de Silvo. He told me
that a friend had mentioned my name, and gave full particulars of
the investment.'</p>

<p>'Have you that letter?'</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>'No; I was particularly asked to bring it with me when I went
to see them. Although, in point of fact, I never did see them,'
smiled the girl. 'I wrote to their lawyers&mdash;will you wait? I
have their letter.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder waited at the gate whilst the girl went into the
house and returned presently with a small portfolio, from which
she took a quarto sheet. It was headed with the name of a legal
firm, Bracher &amp; Bracher, and was the usual formal type of
letter one expects from a lawyer.</p><br>

<p class="letter">'<span class="smcap">Dear Madam,</span>' it
ran, 'Re--Mexico City Investment Syndicate: We act as lawyers to
this syndicate, and so far as we know it is a reputable concern.
We feel that it is only due to us that we should say that we do
not advise investments in any concern which offers such large
profits, for usually there is a corresponding risk. We know,
however, that this syndicate has paid 12 and a half per cent. and
sometimes as much as 20 per cent., and we have had no complaints
about them. We cannot, of course, as lawyers, guarantee the
financial soundness of any of our clients, and can only repeat
that, in so far as we have been able to ascertain, the syndicate
conducts a genuine business and enjoys a very sound financial
backing.<br> 'Yours faithfully,<br></p>

<p class="letter">'<span class="smcap">Bracher &amp;
Bracher</span>.'</p><br>

<p>'You say you never saw de Silvo?'</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>'No; I saw Mr. Bracher, but when I went to the office of the
syndicate, which is in the same building, I found only a clerk in
attendance. Mr. de Silvo had been called out of town. I had to
leave the letter because the lower portion was an application for
shares in the syndicate. The capital could be withdrawn at three
days' notice, and I must say that this last clause decided me;
and when I had a letter from Mr. de Silvo accepting my
investment, I sent him the money.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>'And you've received your dividends regularly ever since?' he
said.</p>

<p>'Every month,' said the girl triumphantly. 'And really I think
you're wrong in connecting the company with these
disappearances.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder did not reply. That afternoon he made it his
business to call at 179, Portugal Street. It was a two-story
building of an old-fashioned type. A wide flagged hall led into
the building; a set of old-fashioned stairs ran up to the 'top
floor,' which was occupied by a China merchant; and from the hall
led three doors. That on the left bore the legend 'Bracher &amp;
Bracher, Solicitors,' and immediately facing was the office of
the Mexican Syndicate. At the far end of the passage was a door
which exhibited the name 'John Baston,' but as to Mr. Baston's
business there was no indication.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder knocked gently at the door of the syndicate and a
voice bade him come in. A young man, wearing glasses, was sitting
at a typewriting table, a pair of dictaphone receivers in his
ears, and he was typing rapidly.</p>

<p>'No, sir, Mr. de Silvo is not in. He only comes in about twice
a week,' said the clerk. 'Will you give me your name?'</p>

<p>'It is not important,' said Reeder gently, and went out,
closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>He was more fortunate in his call upon Bracher &amp; Bracher,
for Mr. Joseph Bracher was in his office: a tall, florid
gentleman who wore a large rose in his buttonhole. The firm of
Bracher &amp; Bracher was evidently a prosperous one, for there
were half a dozen clerks in the outer office, and Mr. Bracher's
private sanctum, with its big partner desk, was a model of shabby
comfort.</p>

<p>'Sit down, Mr. Reeder,' said the lawyer, glancing at the
card.</p>

<p>In a few words Mr. Reeder stated his business, and Mr. Bracher
smiled.</p>

<p>'It is fortunate you came to-day,' he said. 'If it were to-morrow we should not be able to give you any information. The
truth is, we have had to ask Mr. de Silvo to find other lawyers.
No, no, there is nothing wrong, except that they constantly refer
their clients to us, and we feel that we are becoming in the
nature of sponsors for their clients, and that, of course, is
very undesirable.'</p>

<p>'Have you a record of the people who have written to you from
time to time asking your advice?'</p>

<p>Mr. Bracher shook his head.</p>

<p>'It is a curious thing to confess, but we haven't,' he said;
'and that is one of the reasons why we have decided to give up
this client. Three weeks ago, the letter-book in which we kept
copies of all letters sent to people who applied for a reference
most unaccountably disappeared. It was put in the safe overnight,
and in the morning, although there was no sign of tampering with
the lock, it had vanished. The circumstances were so mysterious,
and my brother and I were so deeply concerned, that we applied to
the syndicate to give us a list of their clients, and that
request was never complied with.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder sought inspiration in the ceiling.</p>

<p>'Who is John Baston?' he asked, and the lawyer laughed.</p>

<p>'There again I am ignorant. I believe he is a very wealthy
financier, but, so far as I know, he only comes to his office for
three months in the year, and I have never seen him.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder offered him his flabby hand and walked back along
Portugal Street, his chin on his breast, his hands behind him
dragging his umbrella, so that he bore a ludicrous resemblance to
some strange tailed animal.</p>

<p>That night he waited again for the girl, but she did not
appear, and although he remained at the rendezvous until half-past five he did not see her. This was not very unusual, for
sometimes she had to work late, and he went home without any
feeling of apprehension. He finished his own frugal dinner and
then walked across to the boarding-house. Miss Belman had not
arrived, the landlady told him, and he returned to his study and
telephoned first to the office where she was employed and then to
the private address of her employer.</p>

<p>'She left at half-past four,' was the surprising news.
'Somebody telephoned to her and she asked me if she might go
early.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' said Mr. Reeder blankly.</p>

<p>He did not go to bed that night, but sat up in a small room at
Scotland Yard, reading the brief reports which came in from the
various divisions. And with the morning came the sickening
realisation that Margaret Belman's name must be added to those
who had disappeared in such extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p>He dozed in the big Windsor chair. At eight o'clock he
returned to his own house and shaved and bathed, and when the
Public Prosecutor arrived at his office he found Mr. Reeder
waiting for him in the corridor. It was a changed Mr. Reeder, and
the change was not due entirely to lack of sleep. His voice was
sharper; he had lost some of that atmosphere of apology which
usually enveloped him.</p>

<p>In a few words he told of Margaret Belman's disappearance.</p>

<p>'Do you connect de Silvo with this?' asked his chief.</p>

<p>'Yes, I think I do,' said the other quietly, and then: 'There
is only one hope, and it is a very slender one&mdash;a very
slender one indeed!'</p>

<p>He did not tell the Public Prosecutor in what that hope
consisted, but walked down to the offices of the Mexican
Syndicate.</p>

<p>Mr. de Silvo was not in. He would have been very much
surprised if he had been. He crossed the hallway to see the
lawyer, and this time he found Mr. Ernest Bracher present with
his brother.</p>

<p>When Reeder spoke to the point, it was very much to the
point.</p>

<p>'I am leaving a police officer in Portugal Street to arrest de
Silvo the moment he puts in an appearance. I feel that you, as
his lawyers, should know this,' he said.</p>

<p>'But why on earth &mdash; ?' began Mr. Bracher, in a tone of
astonishment.</p>

<p>'I don't know what charge I shall bring against him, but it
will certainly be a very serious one,' said Reeder. 'For the
moment I have not confided to Scotland Yard the basis for my
suspicions, but your client has got to tell a very plausible
story and produce indisputable proof of his innocence to have any
hope of escape.'</p>

<p>'I am quite in the dark,' said the lawyer, mystified. 'What
has he been doing? Is his syndicate a fraud?'</p>

<p>'I know nothing more fraudulent,' said the other shortly. 'To-morrow I intend obtaining the necessary authority to search his
papers and to search the room and papers of Mr. John Baston. I
have an idea that I shall find something in that room of
considerable interest to me.'</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock that night before he left Scotland Yard,
and he was turning towards the familiar corner, when he saw a car
come from Westminster Bridge towards Scotland Yard. Somebody
leaned out of the window and signalled him, and the car turned.
It was a two-seater coupe and the driver was Mr. Joseph
Bracher.</p>

<p>'We've found de Silvo,' he said breathlessly as he brought the
car to a standstill at the kerb and jumped out.</p>

<p>He was very agitated and his face was pale. Mr. Reeder could
have sworn that his teeth were chattering.</p>

<p>'There's something wrong&mdash;very badly wrong,' he went on.
'My brother has been trying to get the truth from him&mdash;my
God! if he has done these terrible things I shall never forgive
myself.'</p>

<p>'Where is he?' asked Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>'He came just before dinner to our house at Dulwich. My
brother and I are bachelors and we live there alone now, and he
has been to dinner before. My brother questioned him and he made
certain admissions which are almost incredible. The man must be
mad.'</p>

<p>'What did he say?'</p>

<p>'I can't tell you. Ernest is detaining him until you
come.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder stepped into the car and in a few minutes they were
flying across Westminster Bridge towards Camberwell. Lane House,
an old-fashioned Georgian residence, lay at the end of a
countrified road which was, he found, a cul de sac. The house
stood in grounds of considerable size, he noted as they passed up
the drive and stopped before the porch. Mr. Bracher alighted and
opened the door, and Reeder passed into a cosily furnished hall.
One door was ajar.</p>

<p>'Is that Mr. Reeder?' He recognised the voice of Ernest
Bracher, and walked into the room.</p>

<p>The younger Mr. Bracher was standing with his back to the
empty fire-place; there was nobody else in the room.</p>

<p>'De Silvo's gone upstairs to lie down,' explained the lawyer.
'This is a dreadful business, Mr. Reeder.'</p>

<p>He held out his hand and Reeder crossed the room to take it.
As he put his foot on the square Persian rug before the fire-place, he realised his danger and tried to spring back, but his
balance was lost. He felt himself falling through the cavity
which the carpet hid, lashed out and caught for a moment the edge
of the trap, but as the lawyer came round and raised his foot to
stamp upon the clutching fingers, Reeder released his hold and
dropped.</p>

<p>The shock of the fall took away his breath, and for a second
he sprawled, half lying, half sitting, on the floor of the cellar
into which he had fallen. Looking up, he saw the older of the two
leaning over. The square aperture was diminishing in size. There
was evidently a sliding panel which covered the hole in normal
times.</p>

<p>'We'll deal with you later, Reeder,' said Joseph Bracher with
a smile. 'We've had quite a lot of clever people here&mdash;'</p>

<p>Something cracked in the cellar. The bullet seared the
lawyer's cheek, smashed a glass chandelier to fragments, and he
stepped back with a yell of fear. In another second the trap was
closed and Reeder was alone in a small brick-lined cellar. Not
entirely alone, for the automatic pistol he held in his hand was
a very pleasant companion in that moment of crisis.</p>

<p>From his hip pocket he took a flat electric hand-lamp,
switched on the current and surveyed his prison. The walls and
floor were damp; that was the first thing he noticed. In one
corner was a small flight of brick steps leading to a locked
steel door, and then:</p>

<p>'Mr. Reeder.'</p>

<p>He spun round and turned his lamp upon the speaker. It was
Margaret Belman, who had risen from a heap of sacks where she had
been sleeping.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I've got you into very bad trouble,' she said, and
he marvelled at her calm.</p>

<p>'How long have you been here?'</p>

<p>'Since last night,' she answered. 'Mr. Bracher telephoned me
to see him and he picked me up in his car. They kept me in the
other room until to-night, but an hour ago they brought me
here.'</p>

<p>'Which is the other room?'</p>

<p>She pointed to the steel door. She offered no further details
of her capture, and it was not a moment to discuss their
misfortune. Reeder went up the steps and tried the door; it was
fastened from the other side, and opened inward, he discovered.
There was no sign of a keyhole. He asked her where the door led
and she told him that it was to an underground kitchen and coal-cellar. She had hoped to escape, because only a barred window
stood between her and freedom in the 'little room' where she was
kept.</p>

<p>'But the window was very thick,' she said, 'and of course I
could do nothing with the bars.'</p>

<p>Reeder made another inspection of the cellar, then sent the
light of his lamp up at the ceiling. He saw nothing there except
a steel pulley fastened to a beam that crossed the entire width
of the cellar.</p>

<p>'Now what on earth is he going to do?' he asked thoughtfully,
and as though his enemies had heard the question and were
determined to leave him in no doubt as to their plans, there came
the sound of gurgling water, and in a second he was ankle-deep.</p>

<p>He put the light on to the place whence the water was coming.
There were three circular holes in the wall, from each of which
was gushing a solid stream.</p>

<p>'What is it?' she asked in a terrified whisper.</p>

<p>'Get on to the steps and stay there,' he ordered peremptorily,
and made investigation to see if it was possible to staunch the
flow. He saw at a glance that this was impossible. And now the
mystery of the disappearances was a mystery no longer.</p>

<p>The water came up with incredible rapidity, first to his
knees, then to his thighs, and he joined her on the steps.</p>

<p>There was no possible escape for them. He guessed the water
would come up only so far as would make it impossible for them to
reach the beam across the roof or the pulley, the dreadful
purpose of which he could guess. The dead must be got out of this
charnel house in some way or other. Strong swimmer as he was, he
knew that in the hours ahead it would be impossible to keep
afloat.</p>

<p>He slipped off his coat and vest and unbuttoned his
collar.</p>

<p>'You had better take off your skirt,' he said, in a matter-of-fact tone. 'Can you swim?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>He did not ask her the real question which was in his mind:
for how long could she swim?</p>

<p>There was a long silence; the water crept higher; and then:
'Are you very much afraid?' he asked, and took her hand in
his.</p>

<p>'No, I don't think I am,' she said. 'It is wonderful having
you with me&mdash;why are they doing this?'</p>

<p>He said nothing, but carried the soft hand to his lips and
kissed it.</p>

<p>The water was now reaching the top step. Reeder stood with his
back to the iron door, waiting. And then he felt something touch
the door from the other side. There was a faint click, as though
a bolt had been slipped back. He put her gently aside and held
his palms to the door. There was no doubt now: somebody was
fumbling on the other side. He went down a step and presently he
felt the door yield and come towards him, and there was a
momentary gleam of light. In another second he had wrenched the
door open and sprung through.</p>

<p>'Hands up!'</p>

<p>Whoever it was had dropped his lamp, and now Mr. Reeder
focused the light of his own torch and nearly dropped.</p>

<p>For the man in the passage was Mills, the ex-convict who had
brought the tainted letter from Dartmoor!</p>

<p>'All right, guv'nor, it's a cop,' growled the man.</p>

<p>And then the whole explanation flashed upon the detective. In
an instant he had gripped the girl by the hand and dragged her
through the narrow passage, into which the water was now steadily
overrunning.</p>

<p>'Which way did you get in, Mills?' he demanded
authoritatively.</p>

<p>'Through the window.'</p>

<p>'Show me&mdash;quick!'</p>

<p>The convict led the way to what was evidently the window
through which the girl had looked with such longing. The bars had
been removed; the window sash itself lifted from its rusty
hinges; and in another second the three were standing on the
grass, with the stars twinkling above them.</p>

<p>'Mills,' said Mr. Reeder, and his voice shook, 'you came here
to "bust" this house.'</p>

<p>'That's right,' growled Mills. 'I tell you it's a cop. I'm not
going to give you any trouble.'</p>

<p>'Skip!' hissed Mr. Reeder. 'And skip quick! Now, young lady,
we'll go for a little walk.'</p>

<p>A few seconds later a patrolling constable was smitten dumb by
the apparition of a middle-aged man in shirt and trousers, and a
lady who was inadequately attired in a silk petticoat.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">'The Mexican company was Bracher &amp; Bracher,'
explained Reeder to his chief. 'There was no John Baston. His
room was a passage-way by which the Brachers could get from one
room to the other. The clerk in the Mexican Syndicate's office
was, of course, blind; I spotted that the moment I saw him. There
are any number of blind typists employed in the City of London. A
blind clerk was necessary if the identity of de Silvo with the
Brachers was to be kept a secret.</p>

<p>'Bracher &amp; Bracher had been going badly for years. It will
probably be found that they have made away with clients' money;
and they hit upon this scheme of inducing foolish investors to
put money into their syndicate on the promise of large dividends.
Their victims were well chosen, and Joseph&mdash;who was the
brains of the organisation&mdash;conducted the most rigorous
investigation to make sure that these unfortunate people had no
intimate friends. If they had any suspicion about an applicant,
Brachers would write a letter deprecating the idea of an
investment and suggesting that the too-shrewd dupe should find
another and a safer method than the Mexican syndicate
afforded.</p>

<p>'After they had paid one or two years' dividends the wretched
investor was lured to the house at Dulwich and there
scientifically killed. You will probably find an unofficial
cemetery in their grounds. So far as I can make out, they have
stolen over a hundred and twenty thousand pounds in the past two
years by this method.'</p>

<p>'It is incredible,' said the Prosecutor, 'incredible!'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder shrugged.</p>

<p>'Is there anything more incredible than the Burke and Hare
murders? There are Burkes and Hares in every branch of society
and in every period of history.'</p>

<p>'Why did they delay their execution of Miss Belman?'</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder coughed.</p>

<p>'They wanted to make a clean sweep, but did not wish to kill
her until they had me in their hands. I rather suspect'&mdash;he
coughed again&mdash;'that they thought I had an especial interest
in the young lady.'</p>

<p>'And have you?' asked the Public Prosecutor.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder did not reply.</p>
