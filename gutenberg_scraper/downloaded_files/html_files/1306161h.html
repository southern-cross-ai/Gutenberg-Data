  <h2><a name="ch-0"
     id="ch-0"></a>FOREWORD.</h2>

  <p class="first">"HISTORIES," said Hare, "used often to be stories. The
  fashion now is to leave out the story."</p>

  <p>I have not, I hope, in recording the doings of the Black Avons, sacrificed
  history for the sake of romance. A right reading of history frequently offers
  us a solution to our present-day problems. It is a truism that history
  repeats itself, and it is a curious fact that we can find parallels for
  almost every political and national situation of to-day, if we delve into the
  story of the past.</p>

  <p>I have endeavoured in the course of these narratives, which comprise the
  history of a fictitious family, to be honest, not only in my conclusions, but
  honest also to myself. We live too near to the great events of the immediate
  past to understand properly the true significance of that terrible conflict
  which drew into the field of war the civilized nations of the earth. Many of
  us are blinded by prejudice and suspicion, and may have forgotten that the
  spectre of military Germany was the successor to one as hideous and as
  terrifying, the spectre of an armed France, bent to the will of Napoleon
  Bonaparte.</p>

  <p>The day must come, sooner or later&mdash;and history supplies inexorable
  proofs&mdash;when there will be a change in the orientation, not only of
  British policy but in the policies of the great nations of Europe. War and
  peace are no longer the playthings of despots. The widespread of education to
  which a great band of men and women have devoted their lives, has largely
  paralysed political machinery and has substituted the intelligent reasoning
  of the masses. As the fate of great parties is in the hands of the educated
  mass, so is the question of peace and war.</p>

  <p>This little book is an unpretentious effort to present in story form some
  of the factors which determined the growth of British dominion. It is
  necessarily incomplete since it was impossible that I could bring into a
  short story all the factors that went to the making of our history. My only
  hope is that the stories may interest the student and lead him into the field
  of research&mdash;a field which holds many treasures for the diligent
  seeker.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-1"
     id="ch-1"></a>I. &mdash; I GO TO COURT.</h2>

  <p class="first">I BEGIN by setting forth the meaning and reason of the
  writing&mdash;as all chroniclers of the Avon family must do&mdash;by virtue
  of an oath sworn in Winchester in the year of our Lord one thousand one
  hundred and thirty-nine, being some years after the first Henry's death (that
  so-called Lion of Justice). For five hundred years there hath appeared in
  every century an Avon whose locks were the colour of jet and whose skin was
  swarthy, and because such appearance hath marked troublous days in the
  history of England (as was well prophesied by Hugh de Boisy, a saintly man of
  Winchester), it was covenanted in these words, and so sworn before the altar
  in the presence of the Bishop, John de Blois, own brother to King Stephen,
  and a number of Christian gentlemen; to wit:</p>

  <p><i>"He of the Avons who be most scholarly shall keep faithful chronicle of
  such events and curious or terrible happenings in the land of England which
  shall run with the life of a black Avon, we Avons here assembled in the great
  church at Winchester believing that, by the mysterious working of God, which,
  being ignorant and humble folk, we do not wot, it is ordained that the coming
  in of a black Avon is a portent or presage of Greater Glory for our land.
  Therefore shall be ever in our family one who shall be taught to write so
  that the black Avon when he doth appear shall be marked and his name
  immortalized to the Glory of God and the honour of the Avons who shall
  subsist hereafter."</i></p>

  <p>Now when this oath was sworn there were but few clerkly men in the noble
  families, but nowadays, of the hundred and fifty-seven grown men and women of
  our race, there are as many as ten who can write fairly and near to eighty
  who can sign their names. Let us humbly thank God that He hath given
  enlightenment to His children.</p>

  <p>I was born in the reign of the eighth Henry whom men called Bluff King
  Hal. The morn of my birth was the day when Anne Boleyn, who was mother of the
  great Elizabeth, was brought to the scaffold for her many wickednesses, and
  because of my father's admiration for the King (he approving of such terrible
  methods though he was a good husband and father), I was called Henry.</p>

  <p>My father was a man of fortune, being Lord of the Manor of Beverleigh,
  near the town of Norwich, and he was a true Catholic who yet approved the six
  articles. I have heard it said by foolish young people that King Henry
  brought Protestantism and the ways of the German Luther into England. Such is
  the ignorance of these wights that they believe the king abolished the Roman
  Catholic religion. In truth Henry hated all Protestants, and I mind as a boy
  seeing three preachers of the reformed religion hanging upon one gibbet on
  the top of Norwich Castle.</p><img src="1306161h-images/TBA1-image-1.gif"
        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>For Henry did but deny to the Pope the headship of our Church and
  substitute himself therefor. And though he gave the Bible in the English
  tongue to every church, where it was chained to a pillar (as I have seen
  myself in many cathedrals and churches), yet as soon as he did find that the
  common people construed the Holy Scriptures to their own circumstances, then
  were the Bibles closed to them.</p>

  <p>And many monasteries such as were rich, they say, he confiscated to the
  distress of the common people, who looked to the monks in their sickness and
  sorrow and had employment of them. Most of these monastery holdings was
  arable land which the peasants tilled, and when, as was the fashion in these
  times, the new holders of the land turned them to pasture for their sheep,
  there was misery and starvation in England, and honest labourers, having
  neither food nor work to procure the support of their families, joined with
  robbers and rebels, or else were branded or hanged as beggars.</p>

  <p>The young boy Edward, sixth of that name to rule England, came to the
  throne in 1547 when I was eleven, and well I remember the bonfires we lit and
  tended, though there was sorrow enough for great Henry's death, and
  throughout the land (as my father has told me) an uneasiness of spirit,
  partly I think, because the people dreaded what might come about from the old
  King's will as to the succession, and partly because of the rising tide of
  discontent against the enclosuring of land which went on in our eastern
  counties to an extent beyond reason. The price of English wool was high, and
  the Flanders merchants could never get enough. So the great lords and the
  landowners began to take further pastures, enclosing common land which fed
  the peasant's flocks and on which he grew his food.</p>

  <p>My father lived in style at Beverleigh Manor, the home of our family, and
  my heart grows wanting for the old place with the great avenues of oaks and
  its broad meadows.</p>

  <p>Here came the gentry of the county, and I have seen two score when we sat
  at midday to dinner.</p>

  <p>We kept a hearty table: mutton and young lamb, boars' heads and fat
  capons, with cunning pasties of venison and wild duck; large chines of beef
  and gallons of ale, cool and fragrant from the buttery.</p>

  <p>Of those who came&mdash;and they were not the most welcome&mdash;I
  remember Robert Ket and William his brother. My father had some business with
  him, or he would not have come at all.</p>

  <p>Particularly do I remember Robert, a noisy man of ruddy countenance, whom
  some of the gentry spoke of as "the tanner," though he lorded the Manor at
  Wymondham. He was a fresh-coloured, blusterous, talkative man, with great
  ideas about the wrongs of the people.</p>

  <p>"This be the time when we would have a Black Avon among us," he said, in
  his broad, rustic way. "That from me, young master! For they do say
  hereabouts in Norfolk:</p>

  <p class="poem">"'Red Avon a Lord,<br>
  Black Avon a Sword'</p>

  <p>"and 'tis a sword we want and a right stout man to stand before these
  villains who enclose our lands that their sheep should browse and ours should
  starve! Ye'll see the day, young master, when the people of England will take
  sword and torch as they did in our forefathers' days."</p>

  <p>"And be hanged, Master Ket," quoth I, "even as they."</p>

  <p>He looked with gloom at this.</p>

  <p>"You have the learning of a grown man, Master Henry Avon," he said. "But
  still I say: pray God sends us a Black Avon, for the Black Avons are on the
  people's side."</p>

  <p>I liked him well enough, though his bull voice frightened me. Better I
  liked Anna Lyle (or de Lisle, as some say, she being of a French stock), his
  little ward, a quiet little maid with whom I oft-times played battledore and
  a kind of tennis. She was fair as I, though less learned in the matter of
  foreign tongues.</p>

  <p>My memories of my home are vivid yet indistinct, as though I see it
  through a screen in which great rents are cut, so that some part of it is
  like as it were seen through a fog, and some most clear, even as to-day I may
  look out of my window and see the fields of Charing, where the church of St.
  Martin's-in-the-Field stands proudly amidst the cottages of the country
  folk.</p>

  <p>My father was, as I say, well respected by the gentry, both for his
  learning, which was considerable, and his soldierly qualities, which were
  notable. He had served in war against France under His Grace the Duke of
  Suffolk, being squire at that time to Sir Edward Seymour, who afterwards was
  made Earl of Hertford, and about the time of which I write was styled Duke of
  Somerset. This association was to influence my life, for at the age of
  eleven, after the coming in of the young king, when the Duke of Somerset was
  appointed Protector, my father begged a place at Court for me, which was most
  graciously granted, I being promised Page of the Presence to His Grace.</p>

  <p>"I doubt not you will find the Duke a kindly man, for this he has always
  been," said my father; "though as to his politics I have my own view. Yet it
  seems that he does not show the spirit and sureness which marked him in
  certain of his campaigns. King Henry went far enough with the Catholics, but
  Somerset goes farther. So that he will have a new religion here, to the hurt
  of the people, who see not the fine adjustings of such high matter, but know
  only one way to come to the presence of God, and, if that be denied them,
  will fight for it."</p>

  <p>I told him thereupon all that Robert Ket had said to me, but this he
  dismissed angrily.</p>

  <p>"Ket had better look to his fine manor at Wymondham," he said
  threateningly.</p>

  <p>Two days before I set forth on my journey to London, my father told me,
  walking on the terrace of our house:</p>

  <p>"Watch you well, my son, Dudley, Earl of Warwick, who is at Court no
  friend of the Duke's, if all the stories I hear be true. You will find him
  none too gentle of speech, but he is a good soldier. Speak to him and tell
  him you are of our stock, for we were together in the Scottish Wars, and he
  owes me a whole throat, for I cut down the Scottish gentleman who would have
  murdered him at Pinkie."</p>

  <p>With my head buzzing with advice and admonitions, messages to old
  companions in arms, injunctions, warnings and the like, set I out from the
  city of Norwich one fair morning in May, my horse's head turned towards
  London, and two packhorses, my man Dick, and a gentleman of Norwich who was
  making the journey to London, being my companions. I wore my new suit, a
  doublet of fine red cloth, a greatcoat lined with fur, such as had come into
  fashion in Henry's day, leather riding boots to my calves, embroidered about
  the top in an ancient but very becoming fashion. I also wore my flat cap of
  velvet, which was then new-fangled, but later was worn by all the gentry.</p>

  <p>My father at parting gave me seven shillings, the like of which sum I had
  never possessed in my life, and this I carried in a little bag attached to my
  belt. He was to allow me ten pounds a year for my keep and lodging, a large
  sum, and one rarely allowed to a younger son; so that, with the prospect of
  life at court and all the wonderful and stirring experiences which lay ahead
  of me, I set out with a light heart and came, at the end of nine days, to
  London.</p>

  <p>The Court was at Greenwich, a palace which the young king greatly
  favoured. After a night spent amidst the bewilderment of a great city, I took
  barge next morning and was rowed past the great shipyards of Deptford to the
  beautiful palace where Edward was born.</p>

  <p>I arrived too late to be seen by His Grace, but the next morning presented
  myself at his chambers and was kindly received by him, as my father had
  predicted. He was a man of over forty, and I can well believe the stories
  that I was told from the crowd of courtiers, pages and esquires with whom I
  mixed that morning, that he was sore distrait. All the time he spoke with me,
  which he did most courteously, his fingers were running through his locks,
  his eyes absent.</p>

  <p>"Well indeed do I remember Sir John Avon," he said. And then, stroking his
  little beard, he seemed of a sudden to bring his mind to me and my visit.
  "There is no place for thee in my entourage," he said, and, seeing my face
  fall, he seemed at haste to rouse my drooping spirits. "But my lord Warwick
  spoke to me yesternight that he needed a clerkly page."</p>

  <p>He then cross-examined me about my learning, and, sending for one of his
  gentlemen, bade him take me to the Earl of Warwick. As I was leaving his
  presence, he said:</p>

  <p>"I'd like you best black, Master Avon! For I have need in these days of
  resolute swordsmen and balanced minds."</p>

  <p>I knew he was talking about that famous Harry Avon of long ago, about whom
  my ancestor, Sir Thomas Avon of Chichester, had written.</p>

  <p>I was puzzled that he should have sent me to the Earl of Warwick, for it
  was common gossip that between these gentlemen, who were the most important
  of the sixteen noblemen which formed the Council of the Regency, no great
  love was lost; though they had fought together in Scotland in the opening
  months of His Majesty's reign: the Scottish Wars, as you know, being caused
  by the refusal of the great Scottish lords to have our Edward made husband to
  Mary, the young Queen of Scots, who was now fled into France and married to
  the Dauphin.</p>

  <p>Can it be (I have wondered) that the Lord Protector, as the Duke of
  Somerset was called, should desire that a member of my family, known to be
  loyal to His Grace, should be a spy upon his rival? Some such thought had the
  Earl of Warwick when I presented myself to him at his lodgings.</p>

  <p>He was a dour, suspicious man, unfriendly of countenance, and had a way of
  half-closing his eyes when he looked at you as though he doubted every word
  you spoke.</p>

  <p>"It is true, boy, that I need a page," he said, and then examined me as to
  my learning, and at the end gave me a letter which was written in the Greek
  and which I read for him in good English. It was signed "Jane," and little I
  knew, as I read that word, meaningless to me, that the tiny hand which had
  written so fairly was that which one day would push back her hair that the
  cruel headman's axe should have full play. For this Jane was the Lady Jane
  Grey, ward of the Earl of Warwick, daughter of the Marquis of Dorset, who
  later took the title of Duke of Suffolk; and when his lordship told me that
  this had been written by one who was a year younger than myself, I took doubt
  of my own learning.</p>

  <p>"Why sent the Duke you to me?" he asked, when he had put away the letter.
  "Am I so poor in friends that my servants must be commended to me by His
  Grace?"</p>

  <p>And then I think he remembered, for, with an impatient "Tut"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"True, I spoke to the Duke. What is your name, young master?"</p>

  <p>And when I told him, his crooked eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"Thou art no black Avon, I see," he said with a laugh. "Therefore I must
  fear more your pen than your sword!"</p>

  <p>With this he handed me to his secretary, directing him to find lodging for
  me; and I was sent forth to a tailor, that I might be fitted with the Warwick
  livery proper to my station.</p>

  <p>In the months that followed I swear that he tested me well; for from time
  to time various fellows came to me pretending that they were favourable
  towards the Duke of Somerset, and saying that it would be well if His Grace
  were informed of what happened in the Earl of Warwick's cabinet, where they
  knew I was in constant attendance, for the secretary made use of me for the
  writing and reading of letters, and the making of fair copies of his
  correspondence with certain noble gentlemen of the kingdom. But to all these
  tempters and spies I returned a scornful answer, and presently his lordship
  came to regard me with friendliness, and on many occasions I carried letters
  for him to the highest in the land.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-2"
     id="ch-2"></a>II. &mdash; THE KING.</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was not until after I had been six months in his service
  (my position being well pleasing to my father, who sent me a present of ten
  yards of velvet and a crown piece when he heard of my appointment) that I had
  the pleasure to see the King's Majesty. The Court was at Greenwich, and I
  went in attendance on my lord. It was a warm autumn day, I well remember, and
  the cool breezes of the river were very delectable after the heat and smother
  of town.</p>

  <p>We went by barge from Westminster, passing Baynard's Castle and the great
  Tower of London, which stood up grimly by the water's edge, and after a long
  row I came for the second time to the village of Greenwich and the great
  palace that stands at the foot of a steep green hill, well covered with
  trees. We arrived in time to hear Archbishop Cranmer preach his daily sermon.
  The King, who loved this sermonizing, though he was but a boy, had had an
  open-air pulpit made, and here in the air we sat and listened, and I'll swear
  that none enjoyed this Cranmer so much as the King, who seemed to drink in
  every word, a look of eagerness on his peaked and sickly face. The sermon
  lasted for two hours and a quarter, until such of us as were standing were
  ready to drop.</p><img src="1306161h-images/TBA1-image-2.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Cranmer had a great influence over the King, and was at that time at the
  height of his power. The new English prayer-book had been printed, and also
  the forty-two Articles of Faith, which were afterwards reduced to
  thirty-nine.</p>

  <p>It was strange to believe that this boy, who was ten&mdash;two years
  younger than myself&mdash;could bring himself to such an understanding of the
  holy mysteries which formed the subject of the Archbishop's discourse. The
  Archbishop spoke to me after the ceremony. He was a saintly man with a long
  beard, a gaunt expression and eyes of singular lustre. Throughout the sermon
  the Lord Protector Somerset had stood on one side of the King's chair, and my
  master on the other, and it seemed to me that they vied with one another as
  to who should offer the most acceptable interpretation of the preacher's
  words.</p>

  <p>A few days after, my master sent for me, and I found him pacing up and
  down his great room, a heavy frown on his face, his hands clasped behind his
  back. He looked at me with his usual suspicion, and then took up a letter
  from the table.</p>

  <p>"Place this in the pocket of your doublet, Henry Avon," he said, "and go
  you straight away to Chelsea, to the house of the Lord Admiral. To him this
  letter must be taken, and to him only. You understand?"</p>

  <p>I had heard a great deal of the Lady Elizabeth, who was the King's sister,
  and by some accounted the most learned woman in the kingdom, though she was
  then at the most tender age of fourteen. I have heard my lord Warwick say
  that she was second only in brilliancy to Lady Jane Grey, but that she was
  more flighty and less godly.</p>

  <p>He sent me a man-at-arms to attend me, because on the previous day a band
  of robbers had attacked a traveller on the lonely road across Blackheath, and
  I must ride on my errand as I had to call at the Tower to leave dispatches
  with the Lieutenant, for I had missed the tide.</p>

  <p>I reached the City in safety and made my way through Temple Bar towards
  Chelsea. Near to the limits of the City, in that part of London which is
  called the Strand, I saw the builders, a very multitude of men, working at
  the great palace which is to be called Somerset House, and on which they tell
  me the Lord Protector had already spent one hundred thousand pounds. There
  was great murmuring about the Duke's ambition and his self-conceit, which
  took the shape of this grand building, which was to be greater than any royal
  palace. Some say that the money had come from the monasteries which he had
  suppressed, and there was a bitter feeling against him, especially in the
  western parts of England.</p>

  <p>I came to the house of Lord Seymour of Sudeley, who was the Protector's
  younger brother and his most ambitious enemy; and because of the importance
  of my dispatch I was taken immediately by his page into the great library. I
  do not think that my lord expected that I should be shown in to him, but
  rather that I should wait in an antechamber, for when the door opened he was
  standing near a window looking upon the garden, and by his side was a slim,
  girlish figure, and his arm was about her shoulder, and there was so much
  tenderness in his gaze that I had thought that this might be his daughter,
  for his wife, who was Katharine Parr, and the last of the great Henry's
  wives, was newly dead.</p>

  <p>He turned with a sharp exclamation; his hand fell to his side.</p>

  <p>"How now, sir!" he said angrily, speaking to his page. "Did I not tell
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then he checked himself with a laugh, and addressed me most
  kindly.</p>

  <p>As he read the letter which I handed to him with a bow, I had time to
  examine this turbulent man, who was Lord High Admiral of England and was, by
  common repute, in league with the very pirates of the western coast it was
  his business to destroy. He was a man of singularly beautiful countenance,
  and well I can understand the fascination which he exercised. The lady I
  looked at more timidly. She was, I think, slightly older than I, but she was
  still a child, gracious of figure and very beautiful, with her fair,
  transparent skin, and her red hair, which had no covering. She was taller
  than I, and if she had any imperfection it was that she stooped a little. Who
  she was I did not guess, until my lord handed the letter to her.</p>

  <p>"What say you to this, Elizabeth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Princess Elizabeth, the King's sister! Looking back over all these
  years, I try to remember my emotions when I gazed for the first time upon
  that princess who was destined to be the greatest Queen that the world has
  ever known.</p>

  <p>She read the letter quickly, and her red lips curled for a second in a
  smile, as she handed it back to the Admiral. I know not to this day what that
  dispatch contained, but I think it may have been that some rumour had reached
  my lord Warwick, and that he had written to warn the Admiral against his
  plans; for in those days the Protector's younger brother was renewing his
  suit with the Princess Elizabeth. You will remember that, when the great
  Henry died, by his will he left the Crown to his son by Jane Seymour, Edward,
  next to Mary his daughter, whose mother was Catharine of Aragon, and in the
  third line of succession, failing issue, to Elizabeth, the daughter of Anne
  Boleyn. Now the King was sick, and none believed that he would reach
  manhood's estate; while as to Mary, she was approaching middle age and had no
  husband.</p>

  <p>I have another reason for believing that this letter had to do with
  Seymour's ambitious plot, for, as the Princess handed him back the letter,
  she said:</p>

  <p>"His Grace will have your head for it, Thomas, it seems!"</p>

  <p>Whereupon he laughed.</p>

  <p>"There are things that I would less care to lose," he said significantly,
  and this brought a smile to the red lips.</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Elizabeth drily, "if you did lose your head so often as
  you lose your heart, you would be a sorry servant of the King's Majesty!"</p>

  <p>It was some three weeks after that I saw the sister of her highness. Sir
  Thomas Gresham, a great merchant of London and a Lord Mayor, had presented to
  the King a pair of the first silk stockings that were ever seen in these
  realms, and the King desired that these should be taken to the Princess Mary,
  with whom he had been at variance, because she so strongly opposed the new
  Reformation; and the Lord Warwick, who missed no opportunity of bringing
  himself favourably to the notice of the Princess, so contrived that the
  present should be taken by him.</p>

  <p>I was one of the company that went with him into Essex, where the Princess
  Mary was for the time being in residence. There are many who speak ill of the
  Princess who became Queen, and speak of her in tones of horror and
  abhorrence. But to me, who saw her now for the first time, and who knew her
  as Queen, she was a sad and pitiable figure. Her youth had been blasted by
  the calumnies of her father. Save the Howards, she had few personal friends.
  She was insulted, almost starved for money, and could only reach King Henry's
  good graces by defaming her own mother. She had been persecuted for the
  convictions which she honestly held; she had seen the teachers of her
  religion ill-treated or murdered. Small wonder that, at the age of thirty,
  this woman, with her heavy face and her cold, repressive manner, should have
  been soured of the world which had treated her so ill.</p>

  <p>My lord Warwick she did not trust: that was clear to me from the
  beginning. She saw through my master's flattery, his suave pleasantries, and
  was silent and attentive whilst he told her of the King's health.</p>

  <p>"I trust that God will preserve for many years the life of my good
  brother, his highness," she said coldly, when he had finished. "Now tell me,
  my lord, what is the news of England? For here I am, without any guidance of
  public affairs; and except that I know the monasteries are being despoiled,
  and that my lord Somerset hath imposed a new prayer-book upon the people
  which they will not have, I know little."</p>

  <p>She knew enough, it seemed, for she told him afterwards many horrid
  stories, of how certain evil men had destroyed the images in the churches and
  had paraded their villages in the sacred vestments.</p>

  <p>"It seems that we are drifting towards Protestantism of a villainous
  kind," she said. "And were my lord Somerset an archangel, he could not take
  God from the ignorant peasantry and substitute another."</p>

  <p>Returning to London, I rode by my lord Warwick's side, and he told me that
  he had never known the Princess so bold of speech, and this fact seemed to
  trouble him. For he guessed that the Princess Mary was better informed as to
  the King's health than he had wist.</p>

  <p>"These be troublesome days, Henry," he said, as we rode through the rank
  and foul marshland which is called Moorfields, and came into the City by Old
  Gate, or, as the common people say, 'Aldgate.'</p>

  <p>"There is no stability in the land, and it seems that my lord Protector
  has ears only for the flatterers who tell him one thing whilst all England is
  telling him another."</p>

  <p>Trouble indeed there was! In the west the opposition to the new
  prayer-book roused the countryside, and the Protector had need to call in
  German mercenaries before the western rising was suppressed. At the same time
  there arose, to my alarm and fear, a rebellion in Norfolk, and long before
  confirmation of this news came, I knew that Robert Ket was behind it all. And
  so it proved; for Robert and his brother William had led a party from
  Wymondham, which had gathered size like a snowball, until he had fifteen
  thousand men encamped on Mousehold Heath, and levied tribute on the
  countryside. Many were the encounters and skirmishes which occurred between
  the gentry and the Kets, in one of which, to my incalculable sorrow, my dear
  father was slain by a yeoman named John Ward, who was afterwards hanged for
  it.</p>

  <p>As the dispatches came through, my lord Warwick grew more and more
  impatient and fretful, for the Protector had gone north with an army to
  suppress the rebellion and had done no more than parley with Robert Ket,
  offering him a free pardon and the redress of his grievances (which were the
  enclosuring of the land) to which Robert replied that, since he had done no
  harm, he required no pardon. For he was the kind of man, as the saying is,
  who knew not where was enough.</p>

  <p>There were meetings of the Council almost every day, and one morning I was
  awakened by the Groom of Chambers and told to prepare myself to accompany my
  lord Warwick into Norfolk. A large army of gentlemen and soldiers were
  assembled, and with these we marched with great rapidity into Norfolk, to
  find Robert Ket in possession of the fair city of Norwich and unwilling to
  parley. Though I doubt me that Warwick would have kept his promise, yet he
  did send a kind enough message to the rebels, repeating the Protector's
  promise of pardon, and when this was rejected my lord ordered the storming of
  the city, in which affair I had my first experience of warfare; though, if
  the truth be told, I was in no danger since I rode by my lord's side
  throughout the day, and entered the city with him when the walls were taken,
  and Robert Ket and his brother were prisoners, Robert being hanged on the
  castle and his brother William on the church door of Wymondham.</p>

  <p>I had no more time than to ride across to my father's house, to find that
  he had already been buried in the family vault, and that my elder brother,
  Geoffrey, ruled in his place. I remember that morning especially because,
  apart from the sad nature of my pilgrimage to my father's grave, my brother
  Geoffrey, a sturdy, quiet fellow, with no stomach for soldiering, though he
  had served in the Scottish Wars, told me that he had received news from our
  uncle, Sir William Marston, who has an estate in Hampshire, that he had a son
  born to him who was "black of locks from his birth, with a skin darker than
  any I have seen...a lusty child, in all ways <i>parfait</i>."</p>

  <p>In this queer, troubled setting did I learn of the coming of the Black
  Avon of my time; and though my heart was rent with sorrow, and my head
  buzzing with all the wonders of my late experience, yet I felt a strange
  thrill in me, such as some great astronomer might feel when he discovers in
  the firmament a new and a brilliant star.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="ch-3"
     id="ch-3"></a>III. &mdash; THE PASSING OF EDWARD.</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN we came back to London there was news enough. Lord
  Sudeley, the High Admiral, had been arrested by his brother and committed to
  the Tower. Parliament was preparing a Bill of Attainder, that strange,
  terrible invention of the eighth Henry, whereby a man, without trial, may be
  condemned to death by a Parliamentary Bill. The Bill was passed and his head
  fell soon afterwards, the charge against him being treason, in that he had
  planned to marry the Princess Elizabeth and had plotted to overthrow his
  brother, the Protector; making cannon for himself, which was against the law,
  since all ordnance was by law the King's, and even coining his own money for
  his treacherous purpose.</p>

  <p>When my lord Warwick heard this news, he became very grave, for he himself
  had corresponded with the Admiral, and in these days men's lives hung upon a
  thread, and one of any two who had influence with the King walked
  everlastingly in the shadow of the scaffold.</p>

  <p>Yet Warwick had no cause for fear, for his star was in the ascendant, and
  every day it seemed that the influence of the Lord Protector was waning.</p>

  <p>The Princess Elizabeth was removed to Hatfield and placed in the
  guardianship of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, who strove most desperately to have her
  confess that she was party to the Admiral's plot. By confronting her with the
  statements of her servants, some of which were not creditable to her as a
  woman, though they had no bearing upon her ambition as a Princess, he sought
  to destroy that self-control, that brilliance of sense which was her
  surprising quality; but all this without success.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that I made the acquaintance of the third great
  woman it was my especial privilege to meet in those stirring times. There
  came once to stay with my lord at his country house, when I was in
  attendance, the Duke of Suffolk, his wife and his daughter, who was the ward
  of my lord of Warwick. It was I who held the stirrup of this young lady when
  she dismounted from her palfrey at the door of the great hall, and these two
  hands supported for the space of a second that martyred form which to think
  of, even at this distant time, is to bring me near to tears. There was no
  more dainty lady, no sweeter face, no more lovely mind, than my lady Jane
  Grey, so gracious she was to all creatures, high and low, so well learned
  that Master Roger Ascham was abashed by her knowledge (and he the greatest
  tutor of the age). Her father I do regard as being the most contemptible
  figure in all history, though I speak with a bitter prejudice, as I well
  realize. Nor do I think more of her mother, who bullied her from cockcrow to
  dusk, with her "Come, Jane," and "Go, Jane," till the poor girl's life was
  scarce worth living.</p>

  <p>They were ambitious, these people, beyond understanding. The lure of the
  Crown of England was always before their eyes, and to them their daughter was
  but an instrument for the gratification of their inordinate desires.</p>

  <p>During the years that followed I saw the growth of my lord Warwick's idea,
  which was first to take Somerset's place as Protector of the realm, and then,
  at Edward's death, to set aside Henry's will and put Jane Grey upon the
  throne; though the claim was of the slightest.</p>

  <p>The Duke of Suffolk had married Mary, the widow of Louis XII., and
  daughter of Henry VII. These latter had a daughter, Frances, who married
  Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, whose daughter was Lady Jane. Jane's grandmother
  was therefore the sister of Henry VIII., and on this shaky foundation was the
  great plot erected.</p>

  <p>To get rid of Somerset was easy; and I, who was a witness of the turns and
  twists, and an eavesdropper of whisperings, saw the end come long before the
  great Protector was arrested and sent to the Tower. My lord Warwick had now
  the King's ear, and in a few days had got himself made Duke of
  Northumberland. The fall of Somerset was not acclaimed as my lord had
  expected, for the Protector had done much to check the enclosuring of land,
  and had brought into operation the Poor Law, whereby collections were to be
  made in each parish for the benefit of the needy. Against this was the issue
  of the second prayer-book in the year of his taking, and this went farther
  towards Protestantism than its predecessor; so that, whilst the labourers
  were appeased, the clergy and the nobility were still further enraged against
  the Protector.</p>

  <p>The King liked him well enough, and was averse from bringing in a Bill of
  Attainder, and presently Somerset was released and again joined the Council.
  My lord feared him, and so did all who had consented to his arrest. We lived
  in those days of Somerset's return, walking, as my lord said, upon a razor's
  edge, and again was the young boy persuaded to send his uncle back to the
  Tower, this time never to emerge, for the Duke of Northumberland, my master,
  secured a warrant for his rival's death, and the head of the Protector fell,
  on a charge of conspiracy too paltry for me to set forth, because of the
  absurdity of it.</p>

  <p>I was by this time on such good terms with the new Protector that often we
  discussed the most intimate matters of State, and he would pass to me the
  gossip that he had heard.</p>

  <p>"The people take Somerset's death with little interest," he told me.</p>

  <p>And, when I asked him what the King had said, he replied that the King had
  shown him his diary, in which he had written:</p>

  <p>"This day the Duke of Somerset had his head cut off between eight and nine
  o'clock in the morning."</p>

  <p>"And as for Princess Elizabeth," he went on, "it is reported to me that
  when Her Highness was told this afternoon that Somerset had been brought to
  the block, she merely shrugged her shoulders and said: 'This day has died a
  man of much wit but little sense.'"</p>

  <p>Of my own fortune at this time it is only necessary to say that I had been
  advanced from the post of page to that of personal secretary to certain
  members of the Council, and I had reason to be grateful thereafter that I had
  not been accepted by His Grace as a member of his own household.</p>

  <p>The King's health was failing. He remained at Greenwich all the year,
  1552-1553, and I saw little of him. This I did not regret, for he was to me
  very colourless, and was, moreover, obsessed by theologies. But my
  master&mdash;for I still called him such, since he had placed me where I was
  and I had worn his livery&mdash;was with His Majesty all the time; and I know
  that some of the members of the Council were very feared of this, not knowing
  where Northumberland's ambition would lead him, for he was a man greatly
  mistrusted and even hated, and when the news came that the King was dying,
  and that Northumberland had been closeted with him hour after hour, and that
  a certain document had been signed by the King's Majesty, there was a feeling
  of excitement which seemed to communicate itself to the very people in the
  streets, so that the citizens of London gathered about my lord's house, as
  though they realized that from here would come the great news. For Edward was
  popular by reason of his piety and youth and because he had, under the
  Protector, set up schools where the poor might be taught.</p>

  <p>Duty called me to Greenwich on the day of that fatal week when much would
  happen of such great importance to England. I learned at Greenwich for the
  first time that the paper which was signed by the King, and by all the great
  men and the judges, was to this effect: that Mary and Elizabeth were not born
  in true wedlock and that the throne was to be left to his cousin, Lady Jane
  Grey.</p>

  <p>It was a broiling hot summer's day, as I sat in the antechamber of the
  Duke's apartments, overlooking the broad river, and envying the little boys I
  saw bathing from the green banks, when the door opened suddenly and the Duke
  came in.</p>

  <p>He was very pale; his hands were trembling.</p>

  <p>"Send me the sergeant-porter," he said. "And look you, Henry Avon, go in a
  manner so that no one will guess that anything is toward."</p>

  <p>He called me back when I reached the door and said in a low
  voice:</p><img src="1306161h-images/TBA1-image-4.gif"
        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>"The King is dead, but none must know this. I will have the head of any
  man who bruits this abroad."</p>

  <p>All the exits of the palace were guarded, and gathering a body of
  soldiers, the Duke set forth post haste to seize the person of Mary and
  confine her to the Tower.</p>

  <p>Who carried the news that the King was dead, I know not. It was well
  enough understood that His Majesty was <i>in extremis</i>. And perhaps the
  gentlemen who had Princess Mary in charge were well enough informed as to the
  Duke's intentions. It is certain that when he arrived at the place where Mary
  should have been found, the cage was empty and the bird had flown to the Duke
  of Norfolk.</p>

  <p>Northumberland came back in a great sweat and we repaired straight away to
  London, there to discover that the Lady Jane Grey had been brought thither,
  and well do I remember that interview. I shall never forget that white-faced
  girl, standing in the great council-room at Whitehall, as Northumberland
  strode in.</p>

  <p>"My lord," she said, and her voice was very calm and resolute, "why have
  you brought me here?"</p>

  <p>"To make thee Queen, Jane," he said, and straightway knelt and kissed her
  hand.</p>

  <p>But she snatched it away.</p>

  <p>"Queen I will never be," she said breathlessly. "Oh God! my lord, what
  madness is this?"</p>

  <p>"Queen you are," said His Grace grimly.</p><img src=
  "1306161h-images/TBA1-image-5.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>And Queen she was proclaimed that night to the silent Londoners, who
  raised not so much as a cheer. One small apprentice boy indeed cried: "Long
  live Queen Mary!" for which his ears were nailed to the pillory and
  afterwards cut off, as I saw myself.</p>

  <p>Thus came Lady Jane Grey to the throne of England, with sorrow in her
  heart and a fore-knowledge of her doom. Though she could not have been
  ignorant of Northumberland's purpose, for a few months before he had in great
  haste married her to his son, Lord Guildford Dudley, a boy of no other merit
  than that he loved Jane.</p>

  <p>Mad indeed was Northumberland&mdash;mad and drunk with the lust for power;
  for he had none behind him, the Council being rebellious, the very judges who
  witnessed Edward's will already protesting that they did so under duress.</p>

  <p>His first task was to secure the person of Mary, and to this end he
  gathered an army and marched against the Duke of Norfolk, getting no further
  than Newmarket before he found his men deserting. I saw him in Whitehall
  before he departed, and never again did I see his face. He had hardly left
  London when the Council met, repudiated the will by agreement, and proclaimed
  Queen Mary, and I heard no more until there came the Duke's steward to me,
  saying that his master had been put into the Tower and was in mortal peril of
  death for treason.</p>

  <p>I did not love Northumberland, yet he had some qualities which were very
  pleasing, and to this day I am pained to think that he recanted his religious
  beliefs and grovelled to Mary for his life, though without any result. The
  headman was already sharpening his axe.</p>

  <p>It was well for me that my fortune was not bound up with that of
  Northumberland, and that the gentlemen to whom I was secretary liked me well
  enough to forget that I ever held the Duke's confidence. I went forth with
  the Council to meet the new Queen when she came to London. She was then
  thirty-six, but looked older. I slipped away from the magnificent party which
  had gone out to meet her, and, standing near Aldgate, watched her coming in.
  First came the citizens' children, walking before her, magnificently dressed.
  Afterwards followed gentlemen habited in velvets of all sorts, some in black,
  some in white, some in yellow, violet and carnation. Others wore satins or
  taffetas, others damasks of all colours, having plenty of gold buttons.
  Afterwards followed the Mayor with the City Companies and the chiefs or
  masters of the several trades. After them the lords, brilliantly habited in
  the most splendid clothing. Next came the ladies, married and single, in the
  midst of whom was the Queen herself, mounted on a small, white, ambling nag,
  the furnishings of which were fringed with gold thread. About her were six
  lackeys, wearing dresses of gold. The Queen herself was dressed in violet
  velvet, whilst behind her rode the Princess Elizabeth with her retinue.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-4"
     id="ch-4"></a>IV. &mdash; LADY JANE GREY.</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is strange indeed that such matters as treason and the
  punishment thereof, the comings and goings of Queens, of wondrous changes in
  the State Government, should have so little effect upon an humble secretary
  as I. For all went as before, save that the work was heavier.</p>

  <p>Lady Jane Grey had already been conveyed to the Tower, but the new Queen
  had scarcely seated herself upon the throne than she ordered that the lot of
  the Lady Jane should be made as comfortable as possible. For she knew well
  enough what part Northumberland had played, with what reluctance this young
  girl had obeyed her father-in-law. Indeed, I found the Queen's Majesty very
  tender of heart, for all her sourness and the bitterness of her terrible
  experience; and even if she feared, as she had reason to fear, the
  discontented elements in her realm, yet she took not the most drastic steps
  against them unless such were absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>And so Lady Jane was removed to the King's house in the Tower, where she
  had her body-servants and her table, sitting at the head thereof. For her
  father, the Duke of Suffolk, imprisonment was not long. The Duchess, his
  wife, succeeded in obtaining his release. And I think that Lady Jane also
  might have come out if her selfish father had not joined Sir Thomas Wyatt in
  a rebellion against Mary, which was so successful that the rebels came up
  against London Bridge, across which they were not suffered to pass, but,
  making a wide detour through Kingston, reached London on the other side,
  where they were defeated.</p>

  <p>The presence of Suffolk in this conspiracy sealed my poor lady's fate. An
  order was issued for execution, I carried it with my own hands to the
  Lieutenant at the Tower, and remained within that gloomy fortress for the
  night, more sleepless than she, more fearful than that great heart, who
  feared nothing but God.</p><img src="1306161h-images/TBA1-image-6.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>That morning she had spent in prayer, and only once did she lose her
  self-control, and that before she was taken out by the Lieutenant; when
  somebody spoke of the Duke of Northumberland, her father-in-law, her face
  flushed and an angry little frown gathered on her smooth brow. (She was, you
  remember, a child of sixteen).</p>

  <p>"Woe worth him!" she said bitterly. "His ambitions have brought my stock
  to this calamity!"</p>

  <p>Dudley, her boy husband, was taken out first to Tower Hill, and from the
  windows of the King's house where we were assembled, she saw his mutilated
  body carried in on a rough bier.</p>

  <p>She would not see her husband that morning, fearing the pain of parting.
  The block was set upon a little mound within the lower, at the spot where
  another queen (Anne Boleyn) had suffered, and she walked with unfaltering
  steps to the place of her death.</p>

  <p>"I die in all innocency, a Christian woman."</p>

  <p>I think those were her last words. I carried back to the Council the
  certification of her death, signed by the Lieutenant's own hand, and in my
  long ride I saw not London that day for tears.</p><img src=
  "1306161h-images/TBA1-image-7.gif"
        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>What fate was hers seemed also to threaten Princess Elizabeth, who was
  committed to the Tower because of the Wyatt rebellion and the whisper that
  she had been privy to it. The Princess went by water, and the Traitor's Gates
  were opened to receive her: a circumstance which caused the Princess the
  greatest anger.</p>

  <p>"I marvel what the nobles mean by suffering me, a princess, to be led into
  captivity the Lord knoweth wherefore: for myself I do not," she said, as the
  barge brought her down the river, and, when she landed: "Here lands as true a
  subject as ever landed at these stairs!"</p>

  <p>Well indeed she might fear, though she did not show it, for on these
  stairs had landed her mother (half mad with fear), her suitor, the Lord High
  Admiral, and the Lady Jane Grey, now dead in the Tower.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-5"
     id="ch-5"></a>V. &mdash; MARY.</h2>

  <p class="first">THOSE years which followed the coming of Mary are to me as a
  bad dream. For myself, I was secure in Whitehall, having been appointed Clerk
  of certain Registers, which brought to me forty pounds a year, which with the
  twenty pounds I received from my brother, placed me in a very fair position
  of prosperity.</p>

  <p>It was well known that when Mary came there would be a match with Philip
  of Spain, and that the Reformation would pass, perhaps never to return. For
  here was Elizabeth in the Tower, and God knew what morning would dawn with
  the news that her head had been smitten from her body, as certain bishops
  would have had it. They tried in all manner of ways to get her to confess she
  was in good harmony with Sir Thomas Wyatt.</p>

  <p>The Queen, no sooner settled on her throne, sent to Rome and had over the
  Cardinal Pole, who was related to her, and from him received forgiveness for
  the heresy of England. Cranmer, Ridley and Latimer went to the Tower, and
  Bonner came out of that place. Master Cranmer recanted to save his life,
  though it was of no avail; and in the end shook off from him the burden of
  his weakness, became Protestant once more, and, bound to the stake at Oxford,
  stretched out the hand which had signed his recantation, that this offending
  member should first be burnt. Ridley and Latimer also died by this horrid
  means. And it is said (for I was not there to be sure that such a saying was
  made) that Latimer bade his brother bishop to be of good cheer, saying: "This
  day we will light a candle in England which, please God, shall never go
  out."</p>

  <p>Yet it is a wicked folly to say of Mary that she burnt these martyrs out
  of her own hatred for the Reformation. She did no more than restore the
  heresy laws, as, indeed, she was bound to do by reason of her faith, and what
  came after was in logical sequence. She might restore monastery lands, as she
  did, but little she did for the peasant, nor could she restore the prosperity
  of the guilds which Somerset and Edward had despoiled, these guilds being the
  associations which helped the needy of their own craft.</p>

  <p>Five bishops, twenty-one clergy, eight gentlemen, eighty-four artisans, a
  hundred labourers, fifty-five women and four children died at the stake
  during those years of Mary's reign. That the Princess Elizabeth would have
  gone to the block also, but for the intervention of the Queen's husband,
  Philip II. of Spain, is certain.</p>

  <p>For all they say of her, the Queen's Majesty had a kindly heart. She
  spared Lady Jane for four months, until the Duke of Suffolk took up arms for
  his daughter; and had she confined her burnings to the bishops and left alone
  the common people, England would have thought little less of her. She charged
  all judges to deliver the law as between herself and the people, with no
  prejudice in her favour because she was Queen, or against them because they
  were poor. But for the burning of these common folk the people hated her.
  Even Catholics were amongst those who murmured at the cruelty of her
  commissioners, and there were whispers abroad, which came to my ears, that it
  would be better for England if Mary died and Elizabeth came to us as
  Queen.</p>

  <p>The Princess Elizabeth I saw but once. She had been removed from the Tower
  and taken to Woodstock, and there I attended, in my capacity as clerk, to
  take certain accounts from her. She had grown into a beautiful girl, with a
  merry eye, and a sharp tongue that had no sting in it.</p>

  <p>"I know you well, Master Avon," she said.</p>

  <p>And when I had congratulated her, with such delicacy as I could muster,
  upon her change of lodgings, for she had recently come from the Tower, she
  answered:</p>

  <p>"One prison is as like another as one wall is like another. I'd as lief be
  a milkmaid singing at my work as be Madame Elizabeth, Lady of Woodstock!"</p>

  <p>She asked after the health of her sister, and for such news as I could
  give her of the Court. I told her there was great unhappiness in the land
  because of the burnings, and she grew grave at that. She said that she owed
  much to the offices of King Philip of Spain, and enquired of me whether it
  was true His Majesty had gone abroad (which he had, leaving the Queen for as
  much as eighteen months at a time). And I took the opportunity, though it
  were treason to do so, to speak of my kinsman, William Avon, who was then
  only eight.</p>

  <p>"When, at the Queen Majesty's death, which God put off for many years, you
  become Queen of these realms, Madame Elizabeth, I would ask for a place for
  William."</p>

  <p>And I told that he was a Black Avon, and the story of them, which she
  already knew.</p>

  <p>She gave me messages to take to Mr. Cecil, who was her dear friend, and,
  as Lord Burleigh and Marquis of Salisbury, ruled her kingdom for her for many
  years. Also to Robert, Earl of Essex, who, she told me, had befriended her in
  her greatest need and had even pledged his estates to help her.</p>

  <p>At this time we were at war with France, a war which the Queen's marriage
  with Philip II. had precipitated, and which ended with the loss of Calais. I
  saw little of King Philip, and I fear me that for him the marriage was no
  more than a piece of diplomacy, for he was more away from the Queen than with
  her.</p>

  <p>Mary, who was never well, was troubled greatly by affairs of State. She
  was, moreover, a true daughter of her Church, and although, through Philip's
  influence, Protestantism had been stamped underground in England, there was
  in Scotland, across the border, a growing movement to carry the Reformation
  of Edward VI. to a farther extent than ever the Lord Protector had dared.
  Chief of these revolutionaries was one Master John Knox, whom I remember
  having seen at Court in the days of the late king: a hard-faced, bitter man,
  with a rasping, terrifying tongue. He had in his composition some of the
  granite of his native land.</p>

  <p>The Queen of Scotland was also named Mary. She had married the Dauphin of
  France, her kingdom being administered by her mother (the third Mary), Mary
  of Guise. And at this growing revolt, Protestantism in England took heart of
  grace, and began to show above the ground. In the midst of her troubles Her
  Majesty was seized with a grievous illness, from which she did not recover;
  and an hour after her death I was riding with a company of gentlemen to
  Hatfield to announce to Madame Elizabeth that her sister was dead and that
  she reigned in her stead.</p>

  <p>We rode not alone. The way to Hatfield was crowded with courtiers, who, as
  soon as they knew that Mary was dying, hastened to pay their shallow court to
  coming majesty.</p>

  <p>A month after Queen Elizabeth came to the throne, it was my good fortune
  to be recommended, as I believe, by Her Majesty personally, to Sir William
  Cecil, so that I may say that in my short term of life&mdash;I was then
  twenty-two&mdash;I had been well recommended to two great statesmen. Mr.
  Secretary evidently knew my history, for when I came to his apartment to
  present myself he said, with a twinkle in his eye:</p>

  <p>"God forfend, Mr. Avon, that your new master shall go the way of your old,
  for I like not the thought that your fortune was bound with His Grace of
  Somerset and His Grace of Northumberland."</p>

  <p>I hastened to assure the Secretary that I had not served the Duke of
  Somerset, and that if I had had dealings with Northumberland, that was by the
  accident of my position as Secretary to certain gentlemen who served on the
  Council of the Regency.</p>

  <p>"Right well I know that, Mr. Avon," he said, clapping me on the shoulder.
  "Now Her Majesty has told me of a certain blackamoor of your house, and has
  commanded me that he shall be brought to Court. Do you make the necessary
  arrangements."</p>

  <p>That day, in great haste, I wrote to my uncle Sir Thomas, and told him of
  Mr. Secretary's words, and received from him by special post a letter saying
  that William was sick, it was feared, of the smallpox (though it was happily
  discovered after that it was but a fever of youth), and this I duly reported
  to Sir William, who asked me again to remind him, which I did just as soon as
  our troublous times were passed.</p>

  <p>It was not until six years later, however, that the Black Avon came to
  Court. Not, it is true, to do any great deeds, for it was ordained that he
  was but to be a witness rather than a maker of history. Yet I thank God that
  a Black Avon has lived in my time, or else this advertisement of the Tudor
  reigns, slight as it is, would not have been written.</p>

  <p>This, then, I tell you, that in these pages I do not seek the
  aggrandisement of my family at the expense of truth, and shall interpolate no
  romance so that it would appear that an Avon saved England, or that our
  family was well favoured by princes, so that I can only speak of one
  adventure of his, when he stood in the Cabinet of the Queen of Scots and saw
  my lord Ruthven work his murderous will upon her secretary. And so to my
  narrative.</p>

  <p>Six years is little enough time in the history of a nation, yet in that
  six years the Queen had accomplished miracles, for she had reconciled
  Catholic with Protestant, and had re-established Protestantism in such a
  manner that the Catholics took little offence; and had so treated the Roman
  Catholics that Protestantism was not alarmed.</p>

  <p>That she loved the Protestants I shall never believe; or that she unduly
  favoured Catholicism is equally unbelievable. She was a woman who feared God
  and had strong feeling about religion, yet she once said in my hearing:</p>

  <p>"I mislike these men who plague our earthly state that they may achieve a
  heaven of their own designing."</p>

  <p>Although of the reformed religion, she stood for many of the customs of
  the old Church. I remember once, when she was entertained by the wife of the
  Archbishop of Canterbury, Elizabeth, who hated the notion of married clergy,
  and opposed it at all times, had a sting in her speech for her at her
  farewell.</p>

  <p>"And you, Madame, I may not call you; Mistress I am ashamed to call you;
  and so I know not what to call you. But howsoever, I thank you!"</p>

  <p>She had a very great breadth of mind, and once, at a Council, I remember
  Sir Nicholas Throckmorton urging her to dismiss some Catholics from the
  Council because of their religion. Elizabeth turned in her seat at the head
  of the table in a fury.</p>

  <p>"God's death, villain!" she exclaimed. "I will have thy head for
  that!"</p>

  <p>Yet she did not hesitate, when men like the Bishop of Rochester and Bishop
  Bonner, having been deprived of their sees, petitioned her to join battle
  with them as to whether the Roman Church had first planted the Catholic faith
  within the realm.</p>

  <p>"The records and chronicles of our realm testify the contrary," she said.
  "When Augustine came from Rome, this our realm had bishops and priests
  therein. It is well known to the wise and learned by woeful
  experience&mdash;they being martyrs for Christ, put to death because they
  denied Rome's usurped authority&mdash;how your Church entered therein by
  blood."</p>

  <p>The Queen's one care in those days (as I well know) was to keep France out
  of Scotland, and mostly to stave off war and to keep at arm's length the
  French. Mary Queen of Scots was married to Francis II. of France who died
  shortly after he ascended to the throne, leaving Mary to return to Scotland
  and her uncouth realm. Her people trusted her not at all and hated her
  religion, interrupting and mocking her at her first mass.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-6"
     id="ch-6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE QUEEN OF SCOTS.</h2>

  <p class="first">BETWEEN Mary of Scots and Elizabeth there was no great
  friendship. Yet in our Queen's mind was a fear that Mary, by reason of her
  religion and her association with France, might lean towards a French
  alliance, to the danger of our realm. It was for this reason she proposed one
  of her favourites as a husband for Mary, who, rejecting the offer, chose Lord
  Darnley, son of the Earl of Lennox: a tall youth, with a dull, stupid face
  and a liking for pleasure. Strange stories came through from Scotland. They
  said the Queen hearkened more to her private secretary than to her
  councillors, and that the King was jealous of the influence of this David
  Rizzio, an Italian and very accomplished on the guitar as well as in the ways
  of crafty statesmanship.</p>

  <p>The Queen's Majesty was perturbed by these stories, and often came to my
  lord Burleigh's cabinet, from which I was often dismissed whilst they talked
  together in private. This, I understand, was the mind of Elizabeth: that
  while she disliked Mary of Scots, both for her ways of living (for she was no
  angel), she deemed it not good policy that she should support the Queen's
  enemies, the common people of Edinburgh, and such of the lords as railed
  against her, and put up tickets* secretly and by night, defaming her.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[*Tickets = placards.]</p>

  <p>We were in the beginning of this crisis when there came a new visitor to
  Court. I shall not readily forget that morning when the Black Avon appeared.
  It was in the month of February and London lay under a pall of snow, so that
  no gentleman went abroad except in a heavy coat lined with fur, and ladies
  who had to come from the country to be in attendance on the Queen found their
  coaches unable to move across the Hounslow Heath because of the great drifts
  which filled the holes in the road and brought about the ruin of their
  carriages.</p>

  <p>I was in Lord Burleigh's cabinet when a page brought me news that a young
  gentleman desired to see me, and, as we expected that day a dispatch from my
  lord Bedford and Sir Thomas Randolph, who were at Berwick watching the events
  in Scotland, where it was rumoured that the Queen of Scots was at issue with
  her husband Darnley, I bade the boy bring the gentleman to me.</p>

  <p>He returned, followed by one at the sight of whom my jaw dropped. A tall
  stripling, broad of shoulder, yet slim-waisted. Young, yet in the manner and
  countenance grave. His hair, cut short was as black as the raven's, his skin
  the olive tint of a Spaniard's. From head to foot he was dressed in black,
  and there was no jewel either hanging to his ear (such as gentlemen wore in
  these days) nor on his breast. Only the hard glitter of a sword-hilt showed
  at his side.</p>

  <p>"I am William Avon," he said simply.</p>

  <p>In another instant I took him in my arms.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, Black Avon!" said I. "Behold in me thy faithful chronicler!"</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that my lord came in and stood stock still at the
  sight of us. Flushing, I brought my kinsman to his notice.</p>

  <p>"I give you welcome to Court, Mr. Avon," said the great Cecil, and took
  his hand. "Well do I remember as a boy reading of your illustrious
  forbears."</p>

  <p>The Queen had many favourites, but none approached in point of affection
  Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and it had been Lord Burleigh's policy
  never to attempt to supplant one favourite by another more to his own liking.
  I do not think that once he interfered with the Queen's private friendships,
  otherwise the coining of the Black Avon might have seemed an attempt on the
  part of my lord to oust Lord Leicester. For the Queen took an instant liking
  to my kinsman when he was presented at audience.</p>

  <p>"By my faith you are black enough, Mr. Avon," she said, with a twinkle in
  her fine eyes. "As black indeed as some of the Jesuit priests that my lord
  Burleigh loves to hang at Tyburn! Now tell me, Mr. Avon, what colour is your
  mind?"</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty," said my kinsman, "I am not long enough at Court to know
  the colour of your Majesty's livery."</p><img src="1306161h-images/TBA1-image-10.gif"
        style="float:left"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>I think the Queen liked that, for she was very quick to detect sincerity,
  and wise in the ways of flattering courtiers. The Black Avon had not been a
  week at Court before he proved that he had the qualities of his ancestors:
  for, one night, between Westminster and the City, he was attacked by three
  footpads out of Alsatia (the which is a haunt of outlaws and cut-throats near
  by the Black Friars) who rushed at him with drawn swords, and such was his
  cleverness of fence that he killed the three of them.</p>

  <p>He had, I was pleased to see, all the qualities which had distinguished
  the men of his colouring: a courage of conviction, and a mind, as has been
  said of them, like "a balance of steel." One afternoon at Greenwich the Queen
  spoke bitterly against the Jesuit order, which was stirring up strife both in
  England and, with more success, in Ireland. William said nothing until the
  Queen challenged him.</p>

  <p>"Madame your Majesty," he then said, "it seems a strange and terrible
  thing that He who came to bring peace to the world should have through the
  ages been served by princes of great uncharity. In the olden days of the
  Romans the Caesars burnt Christians for their sport, and many terrible
  stories have been told about the number that died for their faith. Yet His
  Grace the Duke of Alva, in the Netherlands, hath killed ten times more for
  Christ's sake than did Nero because of his beastly gods. The Christianity, be
  it Catholic or Protestant, which seeks to do hurt, is no longer a religion
  but a tyranny."</p>

  <p>'Twas a bold thing to say before my lord Burleigh, who was hanging Jesuits
  whenever he could find them, but the Queen took no offence. How much he was
  in favour I did not know until one day in March he came to me and told me
  that he had been charged with a very secret mission and was leaving that
  night for Berwick. I think he was more frank with me than he would have been
  with any other man, because of our love for one another, for he told me that
  he was carrying secretly a letter to the Queen of Scots, warning her of
  certain devilish plots which were afoot against her peace and security. He
  was charged also by the Queen to convey a message to Mary, but of this he
  would not speak.</p>

  <p>He left London that afternoon, and of his adventures in the realm of
  Scotland I must now tell, as he told me.</p>

  <p>He travelled post, carrying with him an order, over the name of the lord
  Burleigh, that enabled him to secure relays of horses, and he arrived at
  Berwick without mishap. Here he lodged for the night with my lord Bedford and
  Sir Thomas Randolph, to whom he carried a letter, and in the morning set
  forth across the border and came without adventure to Edinburgh, where he
  lodged at a house in the Cowgate, in the house of Mr. Robert Melville, who,
  although a Scotsman, was in the pay of my lord Burleigh. This being
  necessary, for our Ambassador, Sir Thomas Randolph, had been ordered to leave
  the realm of Scotland because Mary regarded him as an enemy.</p>

  <p>On the morning of March 8th the Black Avon rode alone through the foul
  streets of Edinburgh to Holyrood House, where the Queen was in residence.</p>

  <p>"Her Majesty has not yet arisen," said the Steward of the Household, and,
  taking him into one of the grim and cold antechambers of the castle, left
  him.</p>

  <p>William wondered why this course had been taken, and, suspecting
  treachery, loosened his sword. But presently the steward came back with a
  tall young man, whom my kinsman instantly recognized as the King, Henry
  Darnley. "King" I call him, though he was no king, for Mary had refused him
  the Crown Matrimonial and he was no more than the Queen's husband.</p>

  <p>Darnley greeted him fairly and with every courtesy.</p>

  <p>"Our steward tells us that you have come a long journey, Mr. Avon, and
  bear letters from Her Majesty the Queen our sister, to our dear wife."</p>

  <p>Now William carried two letters, one for public display, and one to be
  conveyed privily to the Queen of Scots, telling her of the plot that was
  toward. And that letter which was public, he instantly drew from his doublet
  and handed with a bow to Darnley, who, without any pretence, opened it,
  though it was addressed to the Queen's Majesty. There was a look of trouble
  in his eyes as he broke the seal, but as he read his face grew relieved.</p>

  <p>"This I will convey instantly to Her Majesty," he said, "but she has not
  yet arisen. For, as you know, good Mr. Avon, Scotland expects an heir and Her
  Majesty at this moment is not as well as we could wish."</p>

  <p>Very civilly he asked William to come to dinner with his gentlemen, and
  this my cousin accepted, hoping that he should be able to see the Queen and
  deliver the private message he had for her.</p>

  <p>He rode back to Mr. Melville, who was anxiously waiting to hear the result
  of his visit to Holyrood House, and when he had told that worthy gentleman
  how the King opened the letter, Master Melville was in some distress.</p>

  <p>"There is a plot afoot," he said, "and it may involve the life of the
  Queen's Majesty. See you, Mr. Avon, that this letter is given to her before
  the night."</p>

  <p>He then showed William a bond, which had been signed by Lord Darnley on
  the one part, and on the other part by the Earl of Argyll, the Earl of
  Murray, the Earl of Glencairn and others, whereby those gentlemen agreed to
  get for Darnley the Crown Matrimonial: that is to say, that he should be King
  as Mary was Queen, and that they should be enemies to his enemies.</p>

  <p>"The blow may fall at any time now," said Mr. Melville. "Rizzio is doomed,
  and it would be no hard fate for him, for he is a foreigner and too much of a
  woman for our liking, with his carollings and lutings. But, likely as not,
  the Queen will die too, and Darnley and the lords will be set up over
  us."</p>

  <p>William had little knowledge of Scottish politics, but he was one who had
  the power of grasping a situation and he spent the morning interviewing other
  Scottish gentlemen to whom he bore letters, and he found that there was in
  Scotland a party bitterly hostile to the Queen and to her religion, and that
  it was rare indeed to meet in that city a man who did not hate Mary and love
  John Knox, the preacher, who had openly denounced her.</p>

  <p>That her life was free from suspicion, he could not believe. She was a
  woman with no great moral principles and of exceeding vanity.</p>

  <p>He dined that day with my lord Darnley and certain nobles who had been
  mentioned in the bond, but there was no sign of the Queen or any of her
  gentlewomen, and he was leaving the castle in great perturbation of mind when
  a gentlewoman, passing him rapidly, murmured:</p>

  <p>"Have you the letter for Her Majesty?"</p>

  <p>For a moment he hesitated, thinking this might be a trap of Lord
  Darnley's, but that instinct which has always been the possession of his kind
  told him that she was a friend.</p>

  <p>He quickened his step and kept pace with her. "No, madam," he said in a
  low voice, "it is in a safe place."</p>

  <p>"Come hither at the sixth hour," she said hurriedly. "I will admit you by
  the small postern and take you to the Queen's presence."</p>

  <p>And then she turned and walked quickly along a narrow passage that led
  from the main hall, and he did not see her again.</p><img src=
  "1306161h-images/TBA1-image-11.gif"
        style="float:right"
        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>That her precaution was justified my kinsman discovered when he found
  himself being followed by two men obviously in Darnley's service. But happily
  at six o'clock it was dark and a thin mist lay over this wretched city; he
  was able to steal to the postern gate the Queen's woman had described, and
  was instantly admitted. He followed her up a winding staircase and, she
  opening a door, he found himself in a small room where supper was laid, and
  where most of the gentlemen and ladies of the Queen's private entourage had
  gathered. Here he met Mr. Arthur Erskine, the Earl of Bothwell, also Lord
  Robert Stewart, brother to the Earl of Murray who spoke to him fairly and
  made most kind enquiries about his journey from London.</p>

  <p>Presently a little door opened and there came in a lady whom he instantly
  recognized, from the miniature which Queen Elizabeth wore attached to a gold
  chain about her waist, as the Queen of the Scots. Going forward, he knelt to
  her and kissed her little hand.</p>

  <p>Behind her was Rizzio, the Italian, a man of slight build with a gentle
  face, and large, tender eyes, whom he saw at a glance, by the trim of his
  beard, was a foreigner.</p>

  <p>The Queen received William graciously, and, taking the letter from his
  hand, made to open it, but, changing her mind, placed it in a pocket which
  was cunningly cut in the fold of her dress.</p>

  <p>"It gives us great happiness to receive so fine a gentleman from the
  Queen's Majesty," she said, looking admiringly at William, as I guess, though
  this in his modesty he would never say.</p>

  <p>And then she asked him what place he held at the Court, and when she
  learned how humble a one it was, asked him his religion.</p>

  <p>"There will always be a place for you at my table, Master Avon," she said.
  And then, seeing that he still wore his sword, she smiled: "May one of my
  gentlemen relieve you of that weapon?" she asked. "For I like not well that
  gentlemen should wear dagg* or sword at meat."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* dagg = small pistol.]</p>

  <p>And much against his will, William agreed and allowed the sword to be
  carried to an outer room where the gentlemen had left their cloaks. And I
  think it was well for him that this happened; for though he was right quick
  with his sword, he might have had little chance with the bloody-minded men
  who were soon to appear in that little room.</p>

  <p>The Queen seated him two places from her. She spoke little, seeming
  oppressed&mdash;indeed there was a great oppression on the meal. None spoke
  gaily, or, if they spoke at all, it was with forced humour. It seemed as
  though the very shadow of death lay upon them all.</p>

  <p>And right truly their humour was tuned to the occasion, for they were but
  half way through when the door opened and, looking round, William saw Henry
  Darnley. He recognized my kinsman, and for a second started and turned pale.
  And then, as the Queen greeted him, he came without a word and sat at her
  side.</p>

  <p>"My lord, you come late for supper." said Mary, uneasily it seemed.</p>

  <p>Darnley made no answer, but his eyes for ever were glancing towards the
  way he had entered, and presently the reason of it appeared, for the door was
  pulled open with great violence and clamour, and there came into the room the
  lord Ruthven, with certain of his squires and men, and they were armed in
  warlike fashion.</p>

  <p>"How now, my lord!" said Mary, rising in agitation. "What means this
  strange sight?"</p>

  <p>For there had come in after Lord Ruthven yet more men who carried swords
  in their hands.</p>

  <p>Ruthven did not answer her, but, fixing his eyes upon the pale secretary,
  beckoned.</p>

  <p>"David, I need thee," he said harshly, and there could be no mistaking the
  menace in his voice.</p>

  <p>Instantly William Avon was on his feet, smelling treason, but somebody at
  his side pulled him down and a woman's voice whispered in his ear:</p>

  <p>"Have done, young sir. Can you fight swords with your hands?"</p>

  <p>In the meantime Rizzio had risen and slipped behind the Queen. She fixed
  her angry eyes upon her husband, and he for his part could not meet them.</p>

  <p>"What means this, my lord? Know you anything of this enterprise?"</p>

  <p>He did not look at her, hanging his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he muttered, "before God I know nothing of this."</p>

  <p>The Queen glowered at Ruthven and pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Go forth, my lord," she said, "under pain of treason. Void this room of
  your presence."</p>

  <p>Ruthven for a second hesitated, and then, lurching towards the Queen,
  struck at the cringing secretary over her shoulder. She screamed and stepped
  back; somebody threw over a table, and one of the men at arms gripped the
  Italian and dragged him forth, whilst another, with a cocked pistol pointing
  at the Queen's heart, held her at bay, and thus they dragged the secretary
  through the narrow doorway, and William saw the rise and fall of their
  glittering daggers as they struck at the dying man before they flung him on
  the stone stairs to die.</p>

  <p>The Queen stood against the wall, her face white, her dark eyes shining
  with a malignity beyond understanding, and presently Ruthven came back, hot
  and bloodstained.</p>

  <p>"I tell you this, Mary," he said, "that if we have offended you, then, by
  God! you have offended us with your intolerable tyranny! For you have taken
  this David in council, and through him have maintained the ancient religion,
  putting upon the Council also my lord Bothwell, who is a traitor!"</p>

  <p>By this time the lord he had named, also my lord Atholl and Sir James
  Balfour, who were in the cabinet at supper when Darnley had arrived, had made
  their escape. Though it would appear that it would have been the blessing of
  God if one at least of these had broken his neck as he slid by a cord down
  the castle wall.</p>

  <p>All the time my kinsman, William Avon, had watched this scene powerless,
  had seen most horrid murder done, and had been insulted, and must needs stand
  quiet. (Afterwards, I asked whether his blood did not boil).</p>

  <p>"For Rizzio, yes, for the Queen, no," quoth he, in his cold practical way.
  "For mark me, Henry, this Queen had death in her eyes when she spoke to
  Darnley, and well I know she was capable of taking care to herself."</p>

  <p>The King and the Queen had angry speech. Words passed between them,
  accusations and counter-accusations, which it is not seemly to write about.
  But at the end, though Rizzio lay on the stairs, with fifty-six wounds
  gaping, she and her prince went away together, seemingly well reconciled.</p>

  <p>Next morning William made preparations for his departure, and none said
  him nay, though Melville warned him that, once Darnley gave thought to the
  matter, he would not easily pass out of the realm. And so this proved, for
  three leagues south of Edinburgh town he was overtaken by two gentlemen, who
  spoke him civilly and told him that they were of the household of Lord
  Ruthven, who desired that he should return with them. It chanced that he
  recognized the speaker as one of those who had come into the Queen's cabinet
  and had struck at Rizzio.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," said this man in the French manner, his name being de Croc,
  the same as, but no relation to, the French Ambassador to Mary's Court,
  "Monsieur, because of stories that may run across the border, and all manner
  of hateful prejudices which may be excited, it is desirable that you should
  return to Edinburgh with us, so that you may have speech with the King. Which
  will be to your profit."</p>

  <p>William Avon laughed, and I think when he laughed he was most
  dangerous.</p>

  <p>"God save you, gentlemen, go your way," he said; "for I am in the service
  of the greatest prince in Christendom, her excellent Majesty, Queen
  Elizabeth, and I tell no tales except the truth. This I tell you, though I
  speak not willingly with murderers."</p>

  <p>"Fellow," said the other hotly, "it was no murder we did but the execution
  of divine justice."</p>

  <p>"So be it," said William Avon, as he half-turned his horse's head. "Then I
  will say that hangmen and headsmen are not to my taste."</p><img src=

        title="Illustration">

  <p>As he spurred back his horse, they drew on him, but before their swords
  were pointed, his was out, and he was on foot. They thought they had him at a
  disadvantage. Three passes, and Ruthven's man toppled over with a groan; but
  his friend, having no heart for the business, turned and galloped away as
  fast as spurs could force him.</p>

  <p>Taking the dead man's horse, my cousin rode on. He had intended to lie at
  a little village that night, and well for him that he changed his mind; for
  my lord Darnley sent a troop after him with orders to take him dead or alive,
  and as he crossed the English border the dust of the column showed against
  the sky not three miles behind him.</p>

  <p>The Earl of Bedford had already received some news of the dreadful deed,
  and when William had told the full story, my lord sent him off to bed while
  he wrote his dispatches, and four hours later my kinsman was on his way to
  London.</p>

  <p>The Queen was at Westminster when the "Black Avon" arrived, and he
  hastened to her with the dispatch. He told me afterwards that he found her
  alone with Lord Burleigh, and that before the dispatch was read she asked him
  to tell her briefly what had happened, for she knew by his quick return that
  something unusual had happened.</p>

  <p>She spoke no word when he told of the murder, though my lord Burleigh was
  greatly troubled, and when he had finished she looked at the picture of Mary
  which she carried at her waist and nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"Had I been you, my good sister," quoth she, "I would have snatched
  Darnley's dagger and killed him where he stood!"</p>

  <p>Of the dead Italian she said nothing, regarding him, I think, as a bad
  servant who had brought the Queen's name into disrepute. Indeed, her anger
  was for Darnley and not for the murderers, since, when some of them took
  refuge in England, and Mary sent her a letter asking that they be turned out,
  she did no more than order Sir John Foster, who was Lieutenant of the
  Marches, to have them sent away from the town in which they had taken refuge;
  and this she did in such a leisurely fashion that no harm came to them.</p>

  <p>William came to lodge with me and told me more than was in the dispatch,
  such as what the Queen had said to Darnley, and Darnley to her.</p>

  <p>"There is a woman, Harry," said he, "who will one day be acclaimed martyr,
  because, God knows! she is heading for utter ruin. And like as not, the block
  or the assassin's knife will end her. And men and women will weep over her,
  pitying her sad plight. Yet, if she were a man and without beauty, she would
  be execrated for her vileness, for her wanton soul is full of malice and
  wickedness. When last I spoke to her she dashed the tears from her eyes and
  said to me: 'No more weeping. I live only to avenge my David!'"</p>

  <p>"There are stories of her which I could not bring myself to tell the
  Queen's Majesty," he went on. "As for Darnley, he is a drunken sot, full of
  self-indulgence, with nothing in him but gross animal, and if he does not
  betray the men he conjured to do this deed, my name be not Avon!"</p>

  <p>William's judgment was ever exact, for Darnley did most horribly betray
  the conspirators, so that in their desperation they sent to Mary, from the
  safe place to which they had fled, the very bond he had signed, though Mary
  needed no assurance.</p>

  <p>It became abundantly clear to Lord Burleigh that Mary would not rest until
  she had the lives of those who slew Rizzio, and he felt it was necessary
  there should be somebody in Scotland to whom his agents might report. Of this
  matter he spoke with me.</p>

  <p>"We need a young man of resolute courage," he said, "and I have a mind to
  send your kinsman, William, into Scotland, though his head will fall if
  Ruthven or Bothwell find him there. How old is your cousin, Mr. Avon?"</p>

  <p>I told him twenty. Indeed, I thought he was much younger until he had
  appeared at the Court, for it will be remembered that I had heard of his
  birth on the day that Robert Ket was captured in Norwich. But it seems that
  the news my brother gave to me was very old, and that the boy had been born
  years before I had heard of his existence.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a good age," mused my lord; "an age when danger seems attractive,
  and fear is a word for older men to explain."</p>

  <p>It was some days before he sent for William, and I was present at the
  interview. My lord came straight to the point.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Avon, I am sending you into Scotland, and peradventure sending you to
  the block, for all I know. For it is certain that you have displeased Prince
  Henry's friends (though they call Darnley the King), and the Earl of Bedford
  tells me that there is a price upon your head."</p>

  <p>He saw my cousin smile and his eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>"That will not deter you from going back into Scotland," he said, "and
  collecting information from such of my agents, of whom I will give you a list
  and to whom I will give you letters, though you must memorize their names
  lest they fall into the hands of the Queen. I have a great desire to know
  what is going forward in that accursed country, particularly what steps the
  Queen will take to avenge the death of her friend."</p>

  <p>The Black Avon rode out of London that night in the guise of a traveller
  who was making for the north, carrying under his doublet six letters, which
  were addressed to A, B, C, D, E and F, the letters standing for certain names
  which he had committed to his memory; and with him went nothing more awful
  than a led horse which trotted at his side and carried on its back his
  slender possessions.</p>

  <p>His journey north was adventurous enough, for he was hardly outside Barnet
  before three footpads came out of a dense thicket and demanded his purse.
  Having no mind to stay and explain their killing and his own identity, the
  Black Avon laid about him with the flat of his sword, and put the villains to
  flight. South of York he came upon four outlawed men, two of whom were
  branded in the face and in the hands, and he found these more difficult to
  deal with, and might have been overcome, but the Sheriff of York rode on to
  the scene and with him his men, and two of the outlaws were hanged out of
  hand to a tree under which William had been fighting for his life.</p>

  <p>He reached the border without further mishap, avoiding Berwick, and taking
  one of those paths which the cattle-stealers know so well, he came eventually
  to Glasgow, a small town on the Clyde, where he was hospitably received by
  one of Lord Burleigh's agents.</p>

  <p>It is well known that my lord had spies in every important city and town
  in Scotland; but of late they had feared to write to him, and since the
  retirement of the English Ambassador from Edinburgh, there had been little
  news come through to London save what Mr. Melville sent.</p>

  <p>"Rizzio had better not died," said Mr. Macpherson, who was a furrier and
  silk merchant; "for we now have Lord Bothwell at the Queen's ear. They say
  she thinks more of him than she did of Davie."</p>

  <p>"Where is Darnley?" asked William, it being his first instruction to
  discover the whereabouts of the Queen's husband; for in England all manner of
  wild rumours were abroad.</p>

  <p>"He is here in Glasgow," was the answer. "Sick, some say, of the smallpox,
  but others, that he has been poisoned by the Queen. And certainly his illness
  was a very sudden one. You came at a good time," Mr. Macpherson went on. "The
  Queen is on her way here from Edinburgh to visit the King, and you will look
  upon as black-hearted a lady as ever held sceptre."</p>

  <p>William found an excuse to go out of Glasgow to a small village through
  which the Queen would pass, and here, through the windows of a tavern, he saw
  Mary and her retinue. She looked as black as thunder and he learnt that she
  had been vexed by having received a message on the road from the Earl of
  Lennox, Lord Darnley's father. After the cavalcade had passed, William made
  his way back to the town of Glasgow and sought for many days that followed,
  information as to what was passing between the Queen and her husband. He did
  not know that the King was to be removed to Edinburgh until after Darnley had
  already left his lodgings.</p>

  <p>William learned that Darnley's destination was Edinburgh. But there was a
  talk, which came through Mr. Macpherson, that Mary would not have her husband
  in the palace, but that he was to be lodged outside the city, in a place
  which had been specially prepared, because she feared the smallpox, and that
  he might give it to the child, which had been born after Rizzio's murder and
  the which was one day to be James I., King of England. With this information
  in greater detail, William went ahead to gain news at Edinburgh, first
  changing into the costume of a road monk, such as were to be seen, by the
  Queen's pleasure, in various places in Scotland. It was no great advantage to
  my kinsman, adopting such a disguise. He met black looks and scowling faces
  everywhere, yet, because the Queen was on the road, no landlord dare refuse
  him admission to their inns.</p>

  <p>The Black Avon reached Edinburgh eight days after he had left Glasgow, for
  his progress had been very slow; and there he found Mr. Melville was not in
  town, and he had recourse to interviewing another agent, who was in such
  terror of discovery that he loudly denied he had any dealings with Lord
  Burleigh. However, my kinsman found a many people who were against the Queen,
  and from one of these he learned that a lodging for the King was being
  prepared at Kirk o' Fields, a lonely and horrid place which stood between two
  ruins just south of a hamlet of ill fame known as Thieves Row. Into this
  bleak and hideous old house, furniture was moved, tapestries were hung to
  hide damp and discoloured walls, and to this place came the King of
  Scotland.</p>

  <p>From the very first, William saw that a sinister plot had been laid, and
  made efforts to find somebody favourable enough to the King to prevent it.
  But, if Mary was unpopular, so also was Darnley, who had betrayed his friends
  and ill-treated those who at this moment might best have served him.</p>

  <p>It was a time of anxiety for the Black Avon, for it was rumoured that one
  of Queen Elizabeth's spies was in the City, and the Earl of Bothwell sent his
  men to search lodgings and examine all suspicious strangers, so that William
  was obliged to move from one house to another, sometimes to sleep in the
  open, with no other protection from the bitter cold of February than his
  broadcloth cloak.</p>

  <p>He could learn nothing except that the Queen went to and fro from Holyrood
  to Kirk o' Fields, and that some nights she slept in this low place. Then he
  heard there was to be a wedding of one of her servants, and that the Queen
  would not sleep in the house of her husband that night, and he guessed the
  evil deed that was toward.</p>

  <p>He was living now in that Thieves Row of which I have spoken, being
  accepted by the denizens of the squalid neighbourhood by the story he told,
  that he had escaped from prison. He spent his nights patrolling round the
  house where the King lay; and on that night when Mary absented herself, he
  was standing in the shadow of the wall, wondering whether it might not be a
  good thing to climb over it and warn Darnley of his danger, when he heard the
  tramp of armed feet, and crept to the shadow of some bushes under the wall.
  He counted twenty armed men, and saw by their dispositions that they were
  surrounding the house. None, however, came near the wall where he crouched
  under the bush, and this gave him cause for wonderment. Presently he heard a
  great commotion in the yard of the house, a cry for help, a few sobbing
  words, and then silence. Careless of danger, he leapt up from his concealment
  and measured the height of the wall. He had crouched to spring, when there
  came a terrific explosion that flung him into a ditch, where he lay
  half-stunned for a minute or two. When he recovered, he heard a great
  commotion. People were running from Thieves Row and from the houses about,
  and he saw the soldiers rapidly disappearing into the darkness. The house had
  been blown up. But Darnley had not been killed thereby. He, too, had heard
  the tramp of feet, and had tried to escape. But Bothwell's creatures had
  caught him in the yard and had strangled him with the sleeves of his own
  jacket.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to do now but to make his way back to England by the
  shortest route; and, after many perilous adventures, William reached London,
  to learn that the Queen was at Greenwich. Here he repaired on horseback and
  interrupted Her Majesty as she was dancing with her courtiers. She listened
  with a white face whilst he told her of the murder, and then, with an
  oath&mdash;for our Queen did not hesitate at that&mdash;she left the
  ball-room, and he did not see her again for two days.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth had no doubt that Queen Mary had planned it all; and when, after
  this, Mary married the Earl of Bothwell (pretending that she was forced
  thereto by being carried off by the Earl of Bothwell's men), there was little
  doubt that England was a dangerous place for Mary of Scots if she came
  thereto. And come she did, for the lords, enraged by the Bothwell marriage,
  gathered their retainers and fighting men and went up against Bothwell and
  Mary and defeated them, so that Mary was forced to flee to Carlisle after
  having escaped from the Isle of Loch Leven, to which the Scottish lords had
  confined her. Then it was that Elizabeth refused to receive her at Court
  unless she cleared herself of the charge against her, that she was
  responsible for the death of her husband. And when a commission was formed to
  enquire into the matter, Mary would give no evidence, pleading her royal
  state as being superior to the law. So that she lingered in one confinement
  after another, until having intrigued against the Queen's Majesty, claiming
  that the English throne was hers by right, Parliament demanded her death, to
  which my royal mistress most sadly and reluctantly agreed.</p>

  <p>It was after Mary's coming that my influence with Lord Burleigh enabled me
  to procure the restoration of the little estate of Mistress Anna Lyle, which
  had been attainted during the treason of her guardian, Robert Ket; and this
  sweet lady I married at the church of St. Bride's, my lord Burleigh and many
  ladies and gentlemen of the Court being present, including my kinsman, Sir
  William Avon, who had succeeded to the estate of his father and had been
  knighted by her Majesty on the recommendation of the Earl of Leicester, the
  Queen's favourite courtier.</p>

  <p>The Black Avon was now well established at Court, and friendly, not only
  with my lord of Leicester, but with the Earl of Essex, so well beloved by
  Elizabeth, and many of the great adventurers who arose in these days. He had
  a lodging in St. James', to which came all the famous men of the earth. For
  here I met, in the years that followed, Sir Francis Drake, that great seaman,
  Frobisher and my lord Howard, a valiant sailor, and Master Walter Raleigh,
  who made such a sensation at Court because he brought back from the isle of
  Tobago a certain dried weed which the natives put into a pipe of curious
  fashion, and, having lighted it, inhale the fumes. Many of these "pipes"
  fashioned in dried clay Mr. Raleigh gave to my kinsman, who soon became
  proficient in the art of making and swallowing the smoke. For my own part, I
  only tried this barbarous practice once and I was so deathly sick that never
  again did I inhale the poison.</p>

  <p>My kinsman, being a gentleman of the town, came to know many other famous
  persons, and once he took me, in company with my lord Leicester, to see a
  masque which was being performed in Southwark. The theatre, which had no
  resemblance to the theatres of the ancient Greeks, was a high wooden building
  called the "Globe." It was roofless, the masque being performed on a platform
  in the open air, and when I went there the galleries about were crowded with
  gentlemen from the Court, whilst in the pit was a goodly crowd of citizens,
  watching the antics of the fellows on the stage. This play was called
  "Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark" and was written by a man named Will
  Shakespeare, who owned the "Globe" and who was known to the Black Avon. Once
  we supped with him at a tavern in Southwark and met many of his friends,
  including a Ben Jonson and a Christopher Marlowe, who were also writers of
  note, though as to Marlowe, I am told, he was too fond of his bottle to be of
  any account.</p>

  <p>I found Shakespeare a very well-spoken gentleman, in great favour with my
  lord of Southampton. He spoke of his home, which was at Stratford in
  Warwickshire, and he seemed indeed a very amiable man to be following such a
  vagabond profession.</p>

  <p>"What think you of our other William of Avon?" my kinsman asked as we came
  away from the tavern that night.</p>

  <p>When I told him, he laughed.</p>

  <p>"This man will be remembered when my lord of Leicester is forgotten," he
  said: a very preposterous statement, it seemed to me.</p>

  <p>Of all that happened through the many years that followed, I remember best
  (and this is my latest memory, peradventure) the great fear that possessed
  England when the King of Spain, making an oath to humble the English pride,
  fitted out his great Armada, that was styled invincible. Well he had reason
  to hate us. We had checked him at every turn; we had sent our soldiers to
  help the people of the Low Countries, who for generations had endured the
  tyranny and horror of his rule. For Philip of Spain, and his lieutenant, the
  Duke of Alba, had put to death more than a hundred thousand people in the
  Netherlands in order to establish his rule and the rule of the Pope. It is
  said, and I think this is true, that Pope Pius V. gave him authority to
  destroy every heretic, man, woman and child. And Spain was further incensed
  because Elizabeth would have no Spanish match nor marry the husband of her
  dead sister. In Holland, where that very gentle knight, Sir Philip Sidney,
  was slain, the Black Avon moved from triumph to triumph. It was in the last
  battle, which broke the power of Spain, that gallant fight with the great
  Armada, that he earned for himself undying honour.</p><img src=

        alt="Illustration"
        title="Illustration">

  <p>Drake had singed the King of Spain's beard when he had attacked the
  shipping in Cadiz Harbour, thereby throwing back the preparation of the
  Armada for a whole year. The Black Avon was with him then, in one of those
  ships that hovered about the coast of Spain, destroying every vessel that
  carried the Spanish colours. But despite all these happenings, which but
  served to irritate the Spanish people, the Armada sailed out of Lisbon on May
  20th, 1588, one hundred and thirty ships of the line with eight thousand
  seamen and nineteen thousand soldiers, appearing off the Lizard on July 19th.
  My lord Howard of Essex was in command of the English fleet, and under him
  were Drake, Frobisher, Hawkins, Fenner and Raymond. The first news which came
  to London by courier was bad. Howard was wind-bound at Plymouth, and the
  Armada had passed into the Channel, but at last the Admiral got his ships
  worked out of the Sound, thirty ships of the line, with forty more
  merchantmen and the like, against a hundred and thirty.</p>

  <p>The Spanish ships were little more, so it seems, than great castles of
  wood floating on the water. We touched them first off St. Alban's Head, and
  then off St. Catherine's, Isle of Wight, the ship on which the Black Avon
  sailed being wrecked by gunfire, but he was rescued with most of his men.
  With little hurt the Armada came off Calais, expecting there to meet thirty
  thousand of the Duke of Palma's soldiers from the Netherlands. But by the
  mercy of God they were not ready, though many think that if they had been
  there would be thirty thousand less enemies of Britain alive at this day. For
  that night Howard sent fire ships drifting with the tide into the Calais
  roads. The great Armada scattered in a panic, and by the evening were flying
  northward into storms, on to the rocks of Scotland and Ireland. Of that fleet
  only fifty-three went back to Spain.</p>

  <p>The Armada was sighted on the day we went down to Tilbury, where tens of
  thousands of English volunteers were drawn up for the Queen's inspection.
  Attended only by my lord Burleigh, though she had been threatened that
  treachery was toward and she might be struck down by some of the very
  soldiers she commanded, she rode along the lines, and then, reining back her
  horse, addressed that armed multitude.</p>

  <p>"I know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman, but I have the heart and
  soul of a king&mdash;and of a King of England too! And I think foul scorn
  that Palma or Spain or any prince of Europe should dare invade the border of
  my realm, to which, rather than that any dishonour should grow by me, I
  myself would take up arms&mdash;I myself will be your general, judge and
  rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field."</p>

  <p>One more picture I have of the Black Avon and of our great Queen. He had
  been advanced to a place in the Council, and he was there by her side when
  they carried her in in her great chair, wan and wasted, and put her at the
  head of the Council table. The men she had loved so well, Burleigh, Essex,
  Leicester, had passed; Drake was dead in Nombre Dios Bay, and the great
  captains of war, who had loved her and whom she had loved, had passed into
  the realms of pious memory.</p>

  <p>She was sick to the death, not having slept in a bed for months, yet the
  black eyes shone out of that gaunt face with the same resolution, though her
  pale lips could frame no word.</p>

  <p>The Black Avon knelt by her side, and one&mdash;think it was Sir Robert
  Cecil&mdash;asked her whether it was her wish that James, the son of Mary,
  Queen of Scots, who had been in our Queen's care almost since he was born,
  should be the new king.</p>

  <p>She tried to speak but could not; closed her eyes, and we thought she had
  gone.</p>

  <p>Sir William Avon&mdash;he was grey in his hair now&mdash;repeated the
  question gently.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "will you raise your hand if you desire that the son of
  James of Scotland should be our King?"</p>

  <p>Slowly the hand rose and fell, and she moved no more.</p>

  <p>The great Elizabeth was dead.</p>
